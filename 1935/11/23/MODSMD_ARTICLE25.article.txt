# Army of Workers To Manage Crowds
## 
### ART STOKES 
Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock,
"middle of the night'' to most stu
dents, the first contingent of the
B.A.C.'s Big Game workers will re
port for duty.
From that hour on, more and
mere Stanford, junior college, and
high school students will report un
til at game time 1500 workers will
he assisting the 1)0,000 spectators.
lo handle the 25,000 automo
biles which will jam Peninsula
highways and pour onto the cam
pus, more than 400 men, mostly
Stanford students, will he used.
The crew will include traffic di
rectors, captains, and barrier
guards.
The coveted ushers' jobs—inside
the stadium where there will be a
chance to see the game—will be
filled mostly by high school and
jayseo students, but among the 700
in the crew of ushers, stair crews,
and inside guards wili be a few
Stanfordites.
The rest of the huge force is com
posed chiefly of concessions work
ers, program salesmen, and "peanut
butchers."
Then, fur "extraordinary" serv
ices, just to help along the hordes,
Jake liwin, manager of the B.A.C.
ticket department, says a number of
special crews will be provided.
There will he lost ticket crews,
where those who want in can ex
plain that they must have lost
their ducats as they got out of the
car; lost and found crews, to hunt
coats, and cars, and babies; am
bulance crews; tow - car crews;
crews to help people get in the
stadium, others to help them out;
wheelchair-pushers, and first-aid
crews.
To the hungry who fail to supply
their own lood, the concessionaires
will sell sandwiches, pop, peanuts,
says Irwin, "are hard on people's

1 stomachs."
Except for the ushers, most of
the workers will miss the game.
Such crews as those handling traf
fic will work until released, which
may be at the half or later; others
will work in shifts, while barrier
crews will work straight through
until the game ends.
Irwin says preparations have been
i going oft for more than six months;
in fact, plans for improvements
started at the last Big Game. Frint
: ing of tickets, applications, signs,
maps, and programs has been done
in a volume that "no one would be
lieve if they were told."
