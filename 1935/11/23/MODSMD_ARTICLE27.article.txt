j PARIS. Nov. 21 (JP). — Premier;
Mussolini of Italy today was de- j
scribed by French officials as ir.dif- j
ferent to any Franco-British peace j
suggestions until Marshal Pietro Ba- |
■ doglio, new cornmander-in-chief of i
Italian forces in Africa, "had a j
chance to win a few battles."
This skepticism was reflected in I
other authoritative quarters as'
Franco - British negotiations began ;
in Quai d'Orsay. Maurice Peterson, >
Ethiopian expert of the British For- '
eign Office, and Maurice St. Quen
tin, Africa expert for the French ;
government, arranged a conference j
toward peace proposals.
But these conversations, informed ;
circles agreed, were "just to keep |
the door open and show the world
France and Britain are fulfilling!
their obligations" to the League of !
Nations to seek peace.
Previously sources close to Pre- j
rnier Laval took hope that the ar- j
rival of Peterson made the chances
for peace look less precarious.
