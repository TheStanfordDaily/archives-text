## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Goal Posts Cost $57,975 a Pair Forty Years of Tradition and History Packed Into One Little Football Game 
### 
It's Big Game time againâ€”with its glamor
and spirit, with two nervous yet inspired teams
lighting for whatever certain type of suprem
acy football is designed to measure, with old
grads bringing back to the campus stories of
"how it used to be," with civilians of Stanford
and California loudly boasting before the
game, madly cheering during the game, and
either celebrating or personally heartbroken
after the game.
All of these are characteristic of Big Game
day, the year's most gala occasion in the vicin
ity of Palo Alto or Berkeley, depending 011 the
scheduled site of festivities.
Nearly 90,000 people, some of them stu
dents, some alumni, some interested fans, and
some uninterested spectators who come to get
their glamor second hand, have paid nearly
$300,000 into the coffers of the Stanford and
California athletic departments.
From the logic standpoint, the whole thing
would seem horribly overdone, all out of pro
portion. Big Game, however, goes deeper
than that. In it is wrapped up 41 years of
tradition, 11 years of accumulated rivalry,
for the most part friendly, between the two
"big" schools of Western United Stales.
The business of Big Game fluctuates only

slightly throughout the years as one team,
then the other, claims gridiron supremacy. It
reaches its peak in a year such as this when !
the two are evenly matched, but either the
Indian or the Bear could be a "100-to-l shot"
without materially altering the tradition, his
tory, and glamor involved.
Aside from being a spectacle of tradition
and color, Big Game annually throws a chal
lenge at the undergraduates of the opposing
colleges. It demands a show of unparalleled
spirit, win or lose. It further demands a show
of sportsmanship; this law, although occasion
ally violated by one side or the other, has come
to he an inalienable portion of the liig Game
code.
l'or two short hours Stanford and California
collectively forget their problems and individ- j
ual troubles and worry more about the success
of Monk Moserip's field goal than approach
ing finals, more about the accuracy of Floyd !
Blower's pass than next month's rent.
And another llig Game adds itself to the
long list that has made lip a tradition that goes !
inexplainably deep into every Stanford or i
California man's feeling, a tradition of foot- j
hall rivalry equalled only by Yale and Har
vard, surpassed by none.
