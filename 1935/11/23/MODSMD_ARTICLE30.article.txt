# Big Game Gaieties Caper Before Capacity Crowd
## 
### 
Appeal of Ihe Big (lame Gaieties does not
need expression in words. The sell-out three
days in advance of presentation attests to the
place Ibis student-written, student-acted —and
his year, student-directed—revue has come to
hold.
Vearlv 'the Gaieties, livelier, timelier, and
employing a larger cast than any of its fellow
productions pays the freight for the rest of
Stanford's drama schedule.
No matter bow well done, the usual three
net play fails to Jill the Farm's antiquated
Assembly Hall; but the Gaieties seldom misses.
Capacity throngs usually iile out well pleased
with student wit, and with student songs in
their ears.
Advance predictions, familiarly enough, de
clare the current edition will be "as good as,
or better than" any of its forerunners.
Sentimental old-timers will probably never
see another Gaieties in the old Assembly Hall
if they fail to obtain seals for tonight. Next
vear, barring mishap, Gaieties will have
moved—with all other Stanford dramatics—
lo the new Memorial Hall.
That structure, although ultra-modern,
comfortable, and well planned will seat about
two hundred less than the present hall. The
time is probably not far away when increasing
enrolment and sustained interest will neces
sitate a two-night stand for the Gaieties.
