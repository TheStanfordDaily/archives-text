## GO AHEAD, HATE US, CAL 
### 
Of this edition of The Daily . . . two thousand
copies will find their way to the Berkeley campus . . .
so ... to loyal sons and daughtei-s of the Golden
Bear we say . . . Dear Cal:
* * * *
If you aren't out dancing a merry Hallelujah around
the campanile today, a sorry lot you are. If you are
n't shouting "Stamp out the Stanford! Crush the
Cards! and Frustrate the Farm!" we're disappointed in
you. And if you aren't harboring bloody thoughts and
muttering "Hate Stanford," balmy days have de
scended upon you.
* * # #
Aren't the odds in your favor? Money on the line
at 7 to 5 for Cal is a reality for the first time in
years. The assumption of long standing that nothing
in cleats out here on (he coast could balk Messrs.
Hamilton, Grayson and Moscrip is actually being
doubted. If such a thing as spirit exists at the East
Bay education factory, it ought to be hitting the
ceiling today.
f * * # *
Down here we have it in print that. Stanford teams
arc better than California's, that Stanford coaches arc
more clever, that Stanford women are better looking,
that Stanford men are better dressed, that the Cali
fornia campus is a heterogeneous display of ram
shackle buildings, that blue and gold is an extremely
ill-chosen color combination, that all Californians are
typical movie collegians. Something of a sentiment of
that order prevailed last night when we gathered in
rally to chant "Down with the Golden Bear."
* $ * *
We on the Farm, as well as the paying public, ex
pect Cal rooters to come down here tomorrow with a
"Hate Stanford" attitude. And if the Bears win, we
expect a joy-drunk mob to demolish goal posts, cost
ing, as is indicated at the top of the page, $57,975 a pair,
even though last year you denied us the privilege of
that act of violence by setting up cross-bars of iron.
* * * *
If you win tomorrow, Cal, glory and the Rose Bowl
is yours. We'll stand meekly while you gloat in
glee before us. We'll admit defeat at the hands of a
better team. And we'll resolve to cheer for you down
at Pasadena on New Year's day. But if you get stop
ped, after all the drum thumping about the mighty
Golden Beai's, ignominy will be yours again and
you'll have to go far to find a shoulder to cry upon!

If you win tomorrow, Cal, glory and the Rose Bowl
is yours. We'll stand meekly while you gloat in
glee before us. We'll admit defeat at the hands of a
better team. And we'll resolve to cheer for you down
at Pasadena on New Year's day. But if you get stop
ped, after all the drum thumping about the mighty
Golden Beai's, ignominy will be yours again and
you'll have to go far to find a shoulder to cry upon!

Of this edition of The Daily . . . two thousand
copies will find their way to the Berkeley campus . . .
so ... to loyal sons and daughtei-s of the Golden
Bear we say . . . Dear Cal:
* * * *
If you aren't out dancing a merry Hallelujah around
the campanile today, a sorry lot you are. If you are
n't shouting "Stamp out the Stanford! Crush the
Cards! and Frustrate the Farm!" we're disappointed in
you. And if you aren't harboring bloody thoughts and
muttering "Hate Stanford," balmy days have de
scended upon you.
* * # #
Aren't the odds in your favor? Money on the line
at 7 to 5 for Cal is a reality for the first time in
years. The assumption of long standing that nothing
in cleats out here on (he coast could balk Messrs.
Hamilton, Grayson and Moscrip is actually being
doubted. If such a thing as spirit exists at the East
Bay education factory, it ought to be hitting the
ceiling today.
f * * # *
Down here we have it in print that. Stanford teams
arc better than California's, that Stanford coaches arc
more clever, that Stanford women are better looking,
that Stanford men are better dressed, that the Cali
fornia campus is a heterogeneous display of ram
shackle buildings, that blue and gold is an extremely
ill-chosen color combination, that all Californians are
typical movie collegians. Something of a sentiment of
that order prevailed last night when we gathered in
rally to chant "Down with the Golden Bear."
* $ * *
We on the Farm, as well as the paying public, ex
pect Cal rooters to come down here tomorrow with a
"Hate Stanford" attitude. And if the Bears win, we
expect a joy-drunk mob to demolish goal posts, cost
ing, as is indicated at the top of the page, $57,975 a pair,
even though last year you denied us the privilege of
that act of violence by setting up cross-bars of iron.
