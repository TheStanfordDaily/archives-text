# "TWO AT A TIME"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I was much surprised to find that
"Two Fainting Females" had sum
moned enough artificial courage to
answer my criticism of their partici
i pation in card stunts.
May I slightly alter their sugges
: tion for a female-proof box so that
i the proposed box will enclose the
] entire female rooting section. This
j will protect others as well as my
i self from that jangle of female
j voices which occurs at exciting parts
' of the game.
As to my virile strength, I am
j willing to prove this point in actual
combat with the hysterical young
meddlers, with the Daily editor as
J referee. I'll fight them two at a
1 time or in single combat, with no
smelling salts allowed.
j Finally, it wouldn't surprise me
j at all if some gentleman should ask
! my assistance in removing from the
( stadium this very pair of fainting
i females who write so boldly in a
cloistered study room, after they
have collapsed under pressure dur-
I ing the card stunts.
Sincerely,
A Rough Who Has Gone
Leave me out of these personal
I conflicts.â€”Ed.
