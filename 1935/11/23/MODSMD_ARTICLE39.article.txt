| The Editor, Sir:
... I am not trying to strike a
"complaining" note, as Frosh num
ber "two" intimates; what I am try
ing to do is to see if there isn't
some way that a plan could be
worked out so the frosh in the fu
ture would know something about
; the candidates running in the fresh-
I man election.
Certainly I read the Daily, but I
I noticed the name of the frosh wa
! ter-polo captain more than 1 did
that of Fuller or Florence Brown.
You also would get your name in
; the paper for murdering your aunt,
; but that isn't any sign that you
I would make a good class president.
: Perhaps the Assembly method,
j with a presentation of the candi
| dates, would be the thing. We have
all seen and heard of the virtues of
the upper division officers by this
| method, and why couldn't this be
! done for tlie lower division before
I election time?
