# Fair Sex Lacking in Grid 'Savoir Faire'

### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Gone are the days when a fancy
fenimo felt duty bound to attend
games clad as for a tea and leaving
brains behind t.hem. Such remarks
as, "Oh, that cute little ball! Why
do they all jump on it so?" have
gone into the discard along with
bustles and beauty-marks.
Now at least one out of every
five co-eds can predict intelli
gently whether the play will be a
pass or a kick, and call fouls be
fore the announcement is made.
The white-shirt rule for rooting
sections has eliminated the necessity
for high heels and frills. But the
feminine contingent isn't perfect.
And we'd like to register the fol
lowing specific gripes:
Why do supposedly intelligent
women still gaze down, enraptured,
at some thug in football clothes and
say, "I do wish Tiny would send
in Bill—he sits in my history sec
tion, and he has the cutest profile!"
Or how about the dizzy dame on
your right who chooses the mo
ment when the home team is on
the two-yard line, third down,
and Grayson taking the ball on a
line plunge, to apply lipstick?
And she of the insatiable appetite,
who first buys peanuts, then candy,

then gum, then cigarettes, and you
have to pass her dime meekly over
to the aisle and pass back the change
and the food. And then lend her
matches. To top it all, she usually
drifts peanut shells over all the sur
sounding territory, including your
freshly cleaned coat.
Ever bought a program? If you
did, didn't the dame in front of
you borrow it to look lip her pets,
and then keep it as an eye shade?
Probably.
Another terror is the near-sight
ed woman who wants to look up
friends in the crowd. You, of course,
have to look for them. And there
you are, craning your neck re
luctantly, when the first touchdown
is scored, looking for Susie Jane
Sears, of whom you never heard
nor wanted to.
Less purposefully obnoxious,
but still a menace, is the co-ed
who thinks she'll lie cold and has
had girl scout training—she wants
to be prepared. So she brings a
sweater, wears a coat, carries a
white jacket to put on during the
stunts, has cigarettes, purse, hat
which she doesn't wear, program,
and thus takes lip at least two
seats.
