# RUNNERS LEAD U.C.L.A
## 
### 
The California cross-country team
that lost to Stanford 23-32 yester
day afternoon placed six men ahead
of U.C.L.A.'s best runner in a meet
on the southern campus recently.

In 1800 football was a simple cam
pus sport without rules or regula
tions and was played in a haphazard
manner by eastern colleges.
