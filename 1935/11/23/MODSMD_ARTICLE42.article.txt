' THE CRUSADES"
At tlii? Stanford Theater
A Bloody, shouting, fight
ing, powerful, "The Cru
sades" is the most moving
and effective of Cecil B.
De Mille's recent film epics. Re
ligion is again the theme, back
grounded by the story of western
Christendom's crusade to recover
its Holy City from the conquering
Saracens.
Though historic facts have been
twisted and condensed for the sake
of unity, the effect suffers none. The
underlying moral that only peace
will win for mortals the Kingdom of
God is coupled with a love story
full of emotion and jealousy to pro
duce little short of a masterpiece.
Richard the Lion-hearted (Henry
Wilcoxon: superbly cast) marries
Princess Berengaria (Loretta Young:
really an actress, beautiful, almost
angelic) in return for food for his
starving forces. Despite interna
| lional jealousies, the two finally
I learn and pledge "true love."
Some will believe '"The Crusades"
! at its best when men are fighting.
The storming of Acre by the cru
j sudors, hundreds of them, is rivaled
in magnificent action and intensity
only by the cavalry battle on the
' fields outside of Jerusalem. Armor
' ed horsemen bearing the Cross oT
Christianity clash with the warriors
of the Crescent of Islam. And fol
lows the most brutal and bloody of
recent film struggles. The weak
; hearted won't enjoy it.
