# Today's Tilt Decides Bid To Pasedena
## Official Invitation To Be Issued Monday After Telegraph Poll 
### 
Stanford's victory over Califor
nia today was considered among
high officials to virtually cinch her
bid to represent the West for the
third successive year in the Pasa
dena Rose Bowl.
The Indians needed a fairly de
cisive victory over the Bears today
to counteract the early season
upset by U.C.LA.. and it was pre
dicted just after the game that tho
Pacific Coast Conference officials,
representative of the ten confer
ence schools, would not hesitate
in again choosing Tiny Thornhill's
Cardinals.
A telegraphic poll between now
and Monday morning of officials of
the Pacific Coast Conference will
officially settle what, today's Big
Game unofficially decided regarding
the Pasadena game on January 1.
Votes of tho officials must bo in
the hands of Professor Hugh Willitt,
University of Southern California
representative, before noon on
Monday.
Professor Willitt will officially ex
tend the invitation sometimo Mon
day afternoon.
The Eastern opponent in the
Pasadena classic will be chosen,
as has been the custom in the past,
but the western representative.
With announcement from both
Dartmouth and Princeton, two
most logical eastern contenders,
that they would not accept the
hid, the field was thrown wide
open to any of several Eastern,
Middle Western, and Southern
universities.
Southern Methodist — whoso ae
rial circus defeated U.C.L.A., 21 to 0,
and thus eliminated the Bruins from
consideration for the Western invi
tation —paired with another Texas
school, Texas Christian, as two of
the seven undefeated teams in the
country before today's games. Ei
ther of these two might receive the
bid to represent the East.
Notre Dame, although beaten
once and tied once, is still con
sidered to have an excellent
chance, to get the invitation.
Pittsburgh's Panthers, also
beaten and tied, were under sur
veillance of AI Masters and Bill
Monohan, graduate managers of
Stanford and California, as pros
pective Pasadena opponents.
In tho 20 years tho Tournament
of Roses has been held, Stanford
has received the bid five times,
while California has represented the
West thrice. The Indians have won
only once, tied once, and lost three
times, while the Bears have a rec
ord of on" victory, a tic, and a loss.
