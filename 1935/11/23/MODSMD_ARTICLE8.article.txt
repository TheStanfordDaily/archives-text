## Indians Run Wild to Get 2 Touchdowns During First Period Grayson, Coffis Tally in Opening Quarter, After Bears Threaten Cardinals' Goal Line; Redskins Hold Early Lead 
### 
STANFORD STADIUM, Nov. 23.—Completely fulfilling
expectations for the 1935 season, Stanford's Indians, for the
most part playing in their last Big Game, drove two first quar
ter touchdowns to set up a 13 to 0 victory that saw California
! not only beaten, but stopped cold.

Thrills .started early as Bob Brit -
tingham dropped on a Stanford
fumble in the first minute of play
to set up a Bear i mining and pac
ing attack that, ended when Hank
Sparks' attempted field goal from
the 6-yard line was wide.
Soon after, Stanford opened her
first touchdown drive on her own
20. Twelve well-mixed plays
were good for 79 yards to give
Grayson a fourth-down chance to
make a touchdown from a yard
of!'. The Portland Boomer barely
sneaked over; Monk Moscrip's
field goal was good. Score: Stan
ford 7, California 0.
Several minutes later Wes Muller
recovered Perry Schwartz's fumble
on the Bear 29-yard line to set up
the next. Stanford score. Bones
Hamilton lost one, then Grayson
passed to Hamilton, who lateraled
to Bill Paulman for a first down on
the 12-yard line.
Grayson picked up three at
tackle, and then failed to gain.
Little Jimmy Cofiis sailed through
Larry Lutz on a reverse on second
down to scorc standing up. Mos
crip's conversion fry was wide,
and the scorc was Stanford 111,
California 0.
Stanford spent the remainder of
i lie first quarter and the early part
of the second in California territory.
Towards the end of the period Floyd
Blower of the Bears found a hole
than gave him a 26-yard gain to the
Stanford 44, and then kicked to t.he
Cardinal 13.
Seconds before half time, Cali
fornia climaxcd a threat with two
incomplete passes over the Stanford
poal line, which gae the Indians
possession on the 20 as the half
ended.
The third quatl'M' for the most,
pari was played harmlessly enough
in midfield and shallow Stanford
territory, neither team scoring so
much as a first down. Intermittent.
California passes were stopped
without completion.
California fumbled on her
Stanford recovered and then fum
bled on the 21 to Rive the ball back
to the Bears for the only excitement
during this period.
Superior Stanford line play
served to prompt. Stanford's two
first half touchdown marches, and
ibr inspired Cardinal line, playing
i!s best game of the season, stopped
California's line attack cold.
Monk Moscrip and Keith Top
| ping, Indian ends, rushed passers
I Floyd Blower and Don Fowler so
fa: ! that they had little chance to
pick out their receivers or to time
their throws. They both proved dis
tinct threats throughout, on run
ning plays as well as in the pitching
department, however.
