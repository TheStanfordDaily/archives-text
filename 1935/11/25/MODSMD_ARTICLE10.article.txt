# Capacity Audience Applauds Gaieties
## S.A.E. and Kappa Skits Win Annual Awards 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
An audience that jam-packed the
Assembly Hall to the gills, if as
sembly halls have gills, witnessed
the 1935 Big Game Gaieties Friday
night.
Only lack of adequate reheai'sal
kept it from being an excellent show.
Two more days of intensive work,
and it would ha've been the best
Gaieties of recent years.
By far the greater number of
marks, however, are on the credit j
side of the ledger. Let's examine j
that first.
The Credit Side
First sell-out in many years, the (
Gaieties was, as we predicted in our i
column, lush with music. Five .
tunes, "Freshman Glide," "Wind and !
the Rain," "Falling Star," "What ;
Makes You Think I Do?" and "It's j
Just the Principle of the Thing" i
have commercial possibilities, and a !
number of others, ranging from j
Frank O'Neill's travesty, "There Are j
No Chi Omegas in Bombay," rem- j
iniscent of Noel Coward's "Mad j
Dogs and Englishmen," to the exotic j
"Night Cry," are good examples of j
the stuff of which the best revues !
are made.
Clean as a Boston edition of j
"Ulysses," and kept so by much the j
same process, the 1935 Gaieties i
proved once and for all that a show
can be risible without being risque.
S.A.E. Opera Tops
Fred Clark's baby killing panto- 1
mime, the antics of Esther the horse, j
Darwin Pcavy's three tumblers :
(whose feats seem to get bigger and :
better every year), and the BA.C.
skit stand out as the high spots of
the show, except for the very best
skit of all, which was the really
clever SA.E. opera.
Right here let us get up and cheer '
for two newcomers, Shirley Jones '
and Bob Mallett, a lass and a lad !
with real stage personality and the j
ability to put themselves over.
That Jones gal knows how to sell !
a song, believe you me, and though |
not all of Mallet's imitations of ra- i
dio stars were good, one couldn't j
help sitting there and liking the boy
and what he did. We can stand a |
lot more of both of them.
:
Weaver Best Solo
Of the old standbys, only Doodles j
Weaver was up to snuff, and he gave
what was perhaps the best perform- !
ance of his peculiar career. Neither
Jim Copp nor Ernie Heckscher were, !
unfortunately, as good as they have j
been.
Before leaving the credits, let's j
put on the record three cheers and a i
"bravo" for the staging of "Wind |
and the Rain"—best we've seen in I
the "Doomed Barn."
