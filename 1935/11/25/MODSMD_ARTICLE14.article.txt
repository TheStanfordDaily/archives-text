## Revolution May Spread Over Entire Nation 
### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 2£ (/P).— j
An uprising seemingly led by non
commissioned officers of the Army |
is raging in four states in northeast- j
em Brazil, unofficial reports to this I
capital said tonight.
Informed observers said the re- j
volt, if unchecked, might conesiv- j
; bly develop into a Socialist-Anti- j
Imperialist movement, suspected of j
forming for several months. Fears I
were expressed that such a devel- |
opment would embrace the entire !
nation.
The more persistent reports cen- ;
to red the disorders in the states of j
Rio Grande Do Notre and Alagoas. |
Commercial airlines altered their j
schedules along the North Brazilian i
coast.
