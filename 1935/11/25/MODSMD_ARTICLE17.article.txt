# Indians Likely Choice In Today's Bowl Vote
## Indians Crush California, 13-0 Before 90,000 Sustained Drive Leads To Easy Touchdown 
### 
They were tired of hearing "migh-
Ity California" shouted on every
; side.
j So they went into the Stanford
! Stadium last Saturday afternoon,
j headed the toboggan for a band of
hopeful Bears, crushed them be
| neath, and sailed on their way —
! perhaps to the Rose Bowl and at
least to a conference tie.
It was a magnificent display of
i football that those Indians gave
when they rolled Cal under to the
tune of 13-0. It was the kind of
game every Stanfordite hoped for.
It was a decisive, convincing vic
tory.
| California played a fine, clean, un-
I wavering ball game. Every Stan
ford man was filled with those words

as they talked it over in the dressing
room afterwards.
But it was Stanford's day, and the
Cards feeling that they put the af
fair on ice with their offensive game
in the first quarter, settling down to
three remaining periods of defen
sive ball.
And thus Stanford's "sophomore
wonders" played to their third Big
Game victory and wound up their
Indian conference football days
with a sparkling climax. It was a
60-minute ball game for six Indian
stalwarts.
Two of those were Stanford's
All-Americans—men who showed
they had it last year and men who
did it again Saturday. Boh Gray
son was the usual great Grayson.
Bob Reynolds was, for the first
time in some weeks, the Reynolds
of last Big Game time.
And Jimmy Coflis and Bill Paul
man of the sophomores were out
standing. As were Bones Hamilton,
Wes Muller, Keith Topping, and
Monk Moscrip—to do the job of
paying compliments would require
the listing of every man who played
a second in that ball game.
Saturday's success lay largely
in a quick Indian start. It was
not long after the opening kick,
fans were still settling in their
seats, when Stanford started the
80-yard touchdown drive that
backed Cal against the wall.
Blower had just kicked into the
end zone, Stanford taking possession
on the 20. On the first play it was
Grayson through right tackle for
25 yards. Then Grayson passed to
Hamilton for 5, and a Hamilton run
netted 7 more.
A reverse to Coflis was good for
12, and another pass, Grayson to
Hamilton, added another 12. The
ball rested on California's lf)-yard
marker.
