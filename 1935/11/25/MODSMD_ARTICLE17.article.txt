# Indians Likely Choice In Today's Bowl Vote
## Indians Crush California, 13-0 Before 90,000 Sustained Drive Leads To Easy Touchdown 
### 
They were tired of hearing "migh-
Ity California" shouted on every
; side.
j So they went into the Stanford
! Stadium last Saturday afternoon,
j headed the toboggan for a band of
hopeful Bears, crushed them be
| neath, and sailed on their way —
! perhaps to the Rose Bowl and at
least to a conference tie.
It was a magnificent display of
i football that those Indians gave
when they rolled Cal under to the
tune of 13-0. It was the kind of
game every Stanfordite hoped for.
It was a decisive, convincing vic
tory.
| California played a fine, clean, un-
I wavering ball game. Every Stan
ford man was filled with those words

as they talked it over in the dressing
room afterwards.
But it was Stanford's day, and the
Cards feeling that they put the af
fair on ice with their offensive game
in the first quarter, settling down to
three remaining periods of defen
sive ball.
And thus Stanford's "sophomore
wonders" played to their third Big
Game victory and wound up their
Indian conference football days
with a sparkling climax. It was a
60-minute ball game for six Indian
stalwarts.
Two of those were Stanford's
All-Americans—men who showed
they had it last year and men who
did it again Saturday. Boh Gray
son was the usual great Grayson.
Bob Reynolds was, for the first
time in some weeks, the Reynolds
of last Big Game time.
And Jimmy Coflis and Bill Paul
man of the sophomores were out
standing. As were Bones Hamilton,
Wes Muller, Keith Topping, and
Monk Moscrip—to do the job of
paying compliments would require
the listing of every man who played
a second in that ball game.
Saturday's success lay largely
in a quick Indian start. It was
not long after the opening kick,
fans were still settling in their
seats, when Stanford started the
80-yard touchdown drive that
backed Cal against the wall.
Blower had just kicked into the
end zone, Stanford taking possession
on the 20. On the first play it was
Grayson through right tackle for
25 yards. Then Grayson passed to
Hamilton for 5, and a Hamilton run
netted 7 more.
A reverse to Coflis was good for
12, and another pass, Grayson to
Hamilton, added another 12. The
ball rested on California's lf)-yard
marker.
Hamilton at. right guard for four.
Paulman made one. Grayson went
through right guard and was forced
W. W. Monahan, California grad
uate manager, according to the
Associated Press last night, reiter
ated his prc-game stand that in
ease of a tie or defeat "California
would expect utmost consideration
in the vote of Conference mem
bers.
He added, "As far as California
is concerned, we will be very glad
to leave it up to the Conference.
Whatever the decision is, we'll
stand on it."
Secret votes are to be cast by the
faculty ' athletie representative of
each Conference university. All bal
lots, under conference regulations,
must be submitted to Willitt before
noon today. Willitt, nevertheless,
was confident that he would be able
to determine the official outcome of
the poll by 11 oclock today.
The team that receives the west
ern bid is accorded the option of in
viting any eastern opponent that it
wants.
With Dartmouth having gone down
to a smashing defeat at the hands of
Princeton, two eastern teams loom
as the most logical candidates. They
are New York University, provided
that she triumphs over Fordham on
Thanksgiving Day, and Notre Dame.
The Southwest's contender prob
ably will be the victor in the South
ern Methodist-Texas Christian tus
sle this week.
Princeton and Minnesota are the
only other undefeated squads in the
East. Princeton will not accept the
bid under any circumstarices, since
she has previously charged commer
cialism in the Tournament of Roses;
and Big Ten regulations prevent
Minnesota's acceptance.
Temple, North Carolina, and Yale
are considered remote possibilities,
but each is worth some considera
tion on the part of the West's repre
sentative.
