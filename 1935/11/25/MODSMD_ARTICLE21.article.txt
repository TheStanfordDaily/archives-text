# Students Adept at Strange Vocations

### PHYLLIS WHITE 
If Stanford were suddenly cut off
from the rest of the world, exccpt
for food and a few other necessities,
life at the Farm could still go mer
rily on. Data of the Student Em
ployment Agency shows that most
of the activities indispensable to
modern living can be performed by
some Stanford student.
Does the shower leak? Mrs.
Irene Overly, head of the agency,
can supply a student plumber and
pipe layer to fix it. Do the dress
suit pants need pressing'' A valet
is at your service. Is somebody
giving a party? liefer him to the
student magician, song writer,
sleight -of - hand performer, or
companion for elderly people, who
can keep great-aunt Sally amused.
If anything is broken, call Mrs.
Coverly's office. Whether it's a trac
tor, a flat tire, golf clubs, or bows
and arrows, somebody can be found
to mend them. One boy specializes
in bill collecting, another in phar
macy. Trembling A.S.S.U. election
candidates can rely upon the serv
ices of a trained campaign speaker.

There arc experts in boat repair,
entymology, glass blowing, taxider
my, and salad mixing. One versatile
student combines the care of horses
and blasting. A willing traveling
companion can also recase and mend
books.
Reinforced steel work is popu
lar among the "he-men." and the
Farm even boasts one genuine
wire-fence contractor. There are
a (ruck driver, with his own truck,
a telephone installator, a tin-smith,
and a Morse-code operator.
The students are willing to teach
as well. In addition to the regular
academic tutors, there arc bridge and
knitting teachers; the knitting teach
er, to conciliate the rough element,
is a girl. Two of the most original
occupations arc nursery work—par
ticularly the care of rose bushes—
and window decorating.
And we must not forget the hoards
of Stanford males who spend their
summers hashing at California re
sorts, working on trans-Pacific
freighters, or serving as forest
rangers.
