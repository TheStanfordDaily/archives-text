Social activity, big sister to the
Big Game, performed a near-mir
acle last week as it transformed the
traditionally reserved Stanford cam
pus as well as a considerable portion
of the peninsula into a seething
whirl of conviviality.
As thousands of alumni, par
ents, friends, and candid observ
ers thronged the Farm, living
groups polished the silverware,
dusted oIT the piano, and threw
wide the doors. Fraternities and
sororities held reunions at which
old grads told tales of by-gone
Cardinal glories while hosts and
visiting Cal rooters discussed the
Big Game.
Punctuating the rounds of spon
taneous activity were a number of
scheduled dances and parties which
drew capacity attendance. A crowd
of more than a thousand students
danced to the music of Eddie Fitz
patrick and his Club Deauville or
chestra at the annual two-hour pre
game jolly-up Friday afternoon.
Most of the 1700 people who
packed the Assembly Hall Friday
night to see the Big Game Gaie
ties moved over to the Women's
Gym after the show for dancing to
the tunes of Freddie Nagel and his
Gaieties orchestra. The affair,
sponsored by the A.S.S.U., began
shortly after midnight.
Toyon and Branner Halls jointly
sponsored a glad-sad jolly-up in the
Toyon lobby following the classic
grid battle Saturday. Frank Brown's
student band furnished the music,
and refrsehments were served to the
300 guests.
