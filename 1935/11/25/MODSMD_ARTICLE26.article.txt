# Conference Chiefs To Cast Ballots for New Years' Game
## California's Hopes Fall Following Stanford's Decisive Victory Masters Sure of Bid Outcome of Poll May Be Known at 11 o'clock 
### Herb Diamond 
Stanford's decisive victory over
California was regarded as virtual
assurance that the Indians would
represent the West in the New
Years Day East-West football classic
at Pasadena's Rose Bowl.
Until Coach Tiny Thornhill's
Cardinals defeated the Bears in
the Big Game, U.C. had stood out
as the unanimous choice for the
honor. Thus the result of Satur
day's tussle foreshadowed a close
vote when officials representing
ten Pacific Coast Conference uni
versities cast their ballots in a
telegraph poll this morning.
Unofficial reports from Southern
California observers predicted that,
the Indians would be chosen as a
result of today's balloting.
A1 Masters, graduate manager of
the Stanford 8.A.C., is already for
mulating plans for the Rose Bowl
ticket sale. "I can't possibly see how
the Conference officials can vote for
anyone but Stanford to represent
them in the Rose Bowl," he com
mented.
"We are only tied with Califor
nia in Conference standings, of
course, but considering that we
are tied and that Stanford l>eat
California beyond any question of
'breaks,' I don't think the Confer
ence could justly give the hid to
the Bears over the team that beat
them."
Professor J. C. Hinsey, Stanford's
faculty athletic representative and
one of the Conference voters, was of
the opinion: "Inasmuch as we de
feated California so badly, the only
fair thing is for us to get the invita
tion to the Rose Bowl. We won de
cisively enough to deserve the bid,
which has become strictly between
California and Stanford."
At Berkeley, Professor Thomas
Putnam, faculty athletic representa
tive, expressed the belief that "Cali
fornia did not play up to her abili
ties."
"Before the game," he continued,
'the feeling at California was that if
Stanford beat us decisively there
would be no question as to who
should get the Rose Bowl bid. Now,
however, many Californians do not
believe the beating was decisive.
Some think it was, and some do not.
"I felt the thing was pretty de
cisive, but that feeling was pos
sibly the result of disappointment.
Last night, I wouldn't have even
considered voting for California
to represent the Coast Conference
in Pasadena, but my opinion pos
sibly may he forced to melt in
with that of the other university
officials before we send in our
vote."
Professor H. C'. Willitt of the Uni
versity of Southern California, Coast
Conference president, was reported
as stating, however, that there was
no way of "predicting authoritative
ly" the outcome of the vote.
"It's now a wide open affair," he
added.
out Oil the 10. Grayson, with Stan
ford needing inches for a first down,
dove over to the eight.
On the first down Grayson hit
right guard for two, and on the next
pJay was held for one. Then Bones
slipped through for four more yards
and Bobby smashed into the line to
score. Moscrip's conversion was
good.

L.A. are tied with one defeat
apiece.

ence points and lias had 7 points

33.
Stanford and California are un
defeated outside of the Conference;
U.C.L.A. lost, 21 to 0. to Southern
Methodist, and consequently is
virtually out of the running.
Stanford's only loss was by 1
point. California's loss was by 13
points.
Stanford defeated the team that
beat U.C.L.A.; California defeated
the team that beat Stanford: and
U.C.L.A. defeated the team that

Stanford is defending Confer
ence champion, and has again tied
for the title, so has not been de
throned.
On the other hand, the Indians
have lost the last two Rose Bowl
games.
