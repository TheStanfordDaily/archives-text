## 
### 
Though having scarcely had time
to cool off from the excitement of
Big Game week-end, Stanford stu
dents are already anticipating
Thanksgiving vacation, which be
gins Thursday and lasts for the re
mainder of the week.
For the many Stanfordites who
plan to go south during the holi
days to enjoy Mother's Thanks
giving turkey, mince pie, and a
generally hilarious time, the
Southern Pacific Company is put
ting on special round-trip rates of
$115 and 510.45. The train leaves on
Wednesday, November 27, at 7:150,
and returns at the same time Sun
day night.
The Farm, however, will not be
deserted, as many are staying on the
campus. Some intend to have one

bang-up time before finals. "Thank
heavens late leaves for these four i
days won't count on my quota," one
Roble lass was heard to remark.
Others, not only bookworms and
average raisers, plan as does one
anxious freshman, to "read (he
last six weeks' work and write a
couple of term papers.'' Less am
bitious students will simply catch
up on much-needed sleep.
Those who do remain on the cam
pus can have Thanksgiving dinner at 1
the main dining room at the Union
Irom 12:30 to 2, o'clock by phoning
3136 for reservations. After this, the
dining room will be closed until De- !
cember 2, but the Cellar will be open j
daily from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Va- j
rious living groups will make their
own arrangements for meals dur- j
ing the holidays.
