# Italians Call British Fleet War Menace
## 
### 
ROME, Nov. 24 (/P). —Italy's pre- 1
paredness against a possible clash j
with Great Britain continued to
night—overshadowed, but not halt
ed. by war with Ethiopia and the
sanctions siege in Europe.

British declarations have brought
| some reassurance to Italy for con

tii.ued peace in the Mediterranean.
But the British fleet remains, Italian
naval experts say, as much of a
thieat as ever.
It is clustered about Alexandria,

too far away for planes to fly from
Italy to bomb the warships and re
turn. But if that physical separa
tion makes for peace, Italian observ
i rs contend the actual presence of
the fleet makes "incidents" possible.
Two things contribute to re
\ive (he rtalo-British anxiety.
First, the economic boycott of
Italy by 51 League nations is
blamed on Great Britain by Ital
ians, and each hardship increases
Italian bitterness.

Second. II Duce is continuing his
physical and moral defensive
measures.
However fantastic the idea of a
British-Italian war over Ethiopia
may seem, Mussolini has not hesi
tated to recognize the danger long
ago he warned the League of Na
tions ihiit military sanctions would
mean war.
