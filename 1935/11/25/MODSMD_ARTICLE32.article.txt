# Cal Water Poloists Down Indian Team 7-5
## Stanford Team Third on Coast As Season Ends Game Extended Three Extra Periods Before Cards Weaken 
### Herb Diamond 
Stanford's 1935 water polo season
was brought to a dramatic finish
Saturday morning when Coach Nort
Thornton's Indian varsity went
down before a smashing California
onslaught only after four extra pe
riods of play had ensued.
The final score of this tightest
of water polo's tight Big Games
was 7-5. Earlier in the day the
Papooses were clowned, 10-4, by
the undefeated Bear Cubs.
Saturday's tussle had loomed as
the all-important conflict as far as
the Cardinals and Berkeleyites were
concerned. Its x'esult gave Califor
nia runner-up honors in the Pacific
Coast Conference, while Stanford
was forced to be content with third
place in the same league. The
mighty Uclan septet that downed
both Stanford and California two
weeks ago is the undisputed Coast
leader, and is now wearing the Con
ference crown for the first time.
In the past 23 years of Indian -
Bear competition, the U.C. tank
â€¢sters had never triumphed over
the Cardinals in Encina Pools.
Stanford had maintained a tradi
tional supremacy that until Sat
urday had never been threatened.
By reason of Saturday's victory
and another win earlier in the sea
son, the Berkeley mermen cinched
their claim for second place in the j
league the Indians have held for the
past 2 2 out of 23 yearsof Stanford-
U.C. rivalry.
The battle that filially resulted
in Stanford's downfall, however,
will give the Golden Bears some
thing to remember. The Cardinals
had gotten away to an early two
goal lead, but late in the first half |
the Bears tallied twice to make the
count 2-2 at the close of that pe
riod.
During the tight second half, each !
of the squads held the other to but
a .single tally. Thus at the end of the 1
game's ordinary duration the score !
stood 3-3.
Extra periods, three of them, J

were added but at the end of the
third the count was still tied, 5-5. It
was only in the fourth period that
the Berkeleyites opened an attack
that proved too much for the dogged
Indian defense. U.C. collected two
goals in quick succession to make the
final result 7-5.
At the end of the melee Coach
Thornton lauded his charges for
the air-tight ball game they had
played until the final gun.
That the game resolved itself into
a tooth and nail battle is evidenced
by the relatively large number of
fouls and penalties credited to both
squads. Both of the aggregations
were set upon triumphing and both
displayed a relentless attack.
