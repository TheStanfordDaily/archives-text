# Bugge's Fencers End Foil Season With One Defeat
## 
### 
What might be callod the first
chapter of the Stanford varsity fcnc- !
ing season has closed with three
matches won, two by the forfeit
method, and one match lost.
The fall quarter fencing season is [
taken up by five-man foils meets !
among five bay area teams which
compete annually for the Heron tro
phy.
The Olympic Club won the tro
phy this year after handing Coach
Elwyn Bugge's varsity its only de
feat of the season. The Cards de- I
feated California in play, and were |
credited with matches which Funke's
Academy and the Italian Club were
forced to forfeit.
A post-season match is being ar
ranged with Funke's Academy to
replace the one that was called off
when the city aggregation was un- ,
abie to appear here.
Captain Dick Ferguson led the !
foilsmen, aided by Louis Lataillade, i
Dwight Stror>g. Langan Swent, Jack
Lesley, and John Reichmuth.
Next quarter a second series of
meets under auspices of the F.L.A. j
are scheduled. Possible return of
former Captain Jerry Bowen to the
Stanford team has brightened the
squad's chances.
