# Drof. Downs Daily Cal In Score Casts
## 
### 
"Will the room please come to
order?"
It was Mr. Sylvestre Joseph
Drofnats, doing a brother and
sister act, while twanging dis
consolately upon a double en
tendre. .
"If the Dionne Quintuplets
will please pour themselves
back into five people, we will
proceed with the business of
how I, Sylvestre J. Drofnats, in
his I-swan song predicted Stan
ford to win 17-7, while the Cal
sports forecaster came out for a
Cal 20-7.
Because of a Cal co-ed's nine
man line, Stanford did not make
as large a score as Drofnats
predicted, but Drofnats is hap
py in his ignorance. The synco
pating seer missed only two
predictions this week, one of
which was the Oregon-Wash
ington upset, and the Oregon
State-Montana tie. One close
call was the Notre Dame 20-13
victory over S.C., which the
seer-sucker predicted at 20-7.
and the U.C.L.A.-Loyola 13-6
game, forecasted at 14-6.
