## 
### 
TODAY'S GAME
Sunken Diamond: 4 p.m., Zete
| vs. Fiji.
Two intramural teams last night
i visualized that old silver football
j championship cup setting on the
house mantel picce for the coming
' season; tonight one of these teams
will be arguing about which corner
I of the mantel the trophy is to grace.
: while the other will be disappointed
at having come so near but yet so
j far.
The cause is the final game of the
i 1935 intramural football season,
when Zeta Psi meets Phi Gamma
Deita for the University champion
ship this afternoon at 4 o'clock on
j the sunken diamond grid.
The game should be interesting
! and closely contested. The Zetes
are a husky bunch of boys that
play lose, chance-taking ball,
while the Fijis are also husky, but
concentrate on a smooth, conserv-
I ative game.
| Howell Turner, who slings a bas
ketball and football with the same
I form and class, leads the Zete at
i tack, .while "Doormouse" Dunn is

) the Zete line mainstay.
I

j of the 1935 intramural season, is
j the Fiji scoring threat, while Lee
j Irclan is a potent pass catcher.

j who have served throughout the
; season will select the all-intramural
I seven.
