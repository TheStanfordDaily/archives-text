						Clean, Hard Game Climaxes Brilliant Three-Year Career for 'Vowing Sophs' 
### 
Stanford's "Vowing Sophomores," now sen
iors, who Saturday played and won their last
Rig Game, today await word from Professor
Hum!' Willitt of U.S.C. concerning the Pacific
Coast Conference's selection of the West's
Rose Howl representative.
For, if Stanford should he elected, its seems ■
probable, those seniors could point to a three
year career seldom equaled and prohahly 1
never excelled, with the possible exception j
of the California Wonder Teams of the early
'twenties, in Pacific Slope football annals.
Ninety thousand impressed spectators paid j
tribute to these seniors who finished their j
three-year period of eligibility—after over- j
coming an ominously threatening "senior !
slump" at the top of the ladder, the spot they |
were determinedly heading for as far back as i
1932, when they were "just a bunch of cocky ,
frosh."
The Indians, convincingly living up to j
every capability, played a brilliant brand of '
football Saturday that left little doubt as to '
Ihe justification of their claim to Coast grid- :
iron supremacy.
The "Vowing Sophs" did not defeat Cali
fornia all by themselves. Far from it. But j
those "sophs" are personally responsible for :
probably the biggest three years in Stanford
football history, taken as a whole, .lust as
determined!v and as surelv as Hobby (iravson 1

reached the goal in that fourth-down punch
Saturday, this group of seniors battered
through to their even more diJlicult self-ap
pointed goal of three lull years at the top of
the peak.
The game itself was played as football
should be played hard, clean, and brilliant.
Roth teams showed a sportsmanship that has
rarely been equaled in the Rig Came; each
showed a complete mastery of the fundamen
tals of football. For both of these factors,
"Slid)" Allison, in his first year as California's
head coach, and Stanford's "Tiny" Thorn
hill deserve much credit.
Stanford's edge was solely a result of the
added experience and the exceptional team
work and brilliance the "greatest of Stanford
teams," after three years of playing together,
was in a position to show over a group of
California sophomores that are making an
earnest bid to follow in the footsteps of those
"Vowing Sophs."
Whether they get the Rose Howl or not, and
whether they should win or lose at Pasadena,
Hobby (iravson, Hones Hamilton, Monk Mo
scrip, Keith Topping, Hob Reynolds, Wes Mid
ler, Larry Rouble, Woody Adams, Hob Black,
Frankic Alustiza, Claude Callaway, and oth
ers on the senior list will look on their college
gridiron careers with the satisfaction of "a
job well done."
