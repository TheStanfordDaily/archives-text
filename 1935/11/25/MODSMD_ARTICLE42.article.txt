# Stanford Prefers to Ignore the "Lesson"
## 
### 
In taking exception hisl Friday to a pre
vious editorial of the Stantohd Daily which
dealt with dill'erent types of ."spirit," the Daily
Ciilifornian concluded:
"UY can think of nothing liner than to
have the California students </o (town to the
Farm tomorrow <m<t show Stanford's little
la<ties and f/entlemen just what real spirit
is. It would seem they need a lesson."
Stanford men do not necessarily lay any
claim to being "real" gentlemen in any deep
sense; Stanford women, not usually termed
"little ladies," also have no particular lire
tensions.
Hut, Cal editors please note: Stanford's
conception of "real spirit" does not include
throwing apple-cores and oranges at success
ful rivals standing before one's own section;
it does not include mass Hitlerite salutes to
an opponent's hymn; il does not include de
struction of the seats in an opponent's sta
dium.
