The Rose Bose Joes,
Gentlemen:
Stanford regrets exceedingly the fact that the Rose
Bowl contest is tainted with Commercialism and de
grading to the spirit of competitive sport for which
our institution has always been justifiably proud. We
find it inconsistent with the ideals of intercollegiate
athletics for our team to play in this degrading con
test, but if we get the bid, we 11 accept it.
Yours,
Stanford Indians,
Beriberi happy.
Back to School.
The cute title fellow who was conducting a scrim
mage in front of the Stanford rooting section Saturday
was Jim Castle, Berkeley heavyweight boxer, who was
paying an informal call on Stanford with the purpose
of conducting a single-handed raid on the Stanford
Union Cellar Axe.
The officer with the little jacket of blue was all for
conking the cuticle upon the conticle, but kind-hearted
Targhetta and the B.A.C. boys decided to try reason
ing with him. The final result was that the local mili
tia carried him kicking and screaming to an ambulance,
where they tied him down to a stretcher.
Back to School.
Dame Rumor has it that one of the administrative
departments of the University had an H-woman sta
tioned in a S.F. hotel in case accidents will happen.
The H-woman's sole call came about a quarter to 1.
"Oh, Miss H-woman," wailed the voice over the
phone, "I'm in such an embarrassing position. My es
cort took a dive and I forgot to bring my $5.
The voice was male.
It is because of the Thanksgiving vacation th»t
Our Hasher selected this as Back' to School week.
There were other reasons, too.
