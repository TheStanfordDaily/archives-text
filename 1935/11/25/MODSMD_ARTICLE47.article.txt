# Bull Session
## THE 						MORNING AFTER 
### 
Last night about 15,000 people were drunk, 25,000
lit, and 20,000 "high." They bought booze, cigarettes,
places at tiny tables, and 10,000 square feet of dance
floor for a part of a total $1,500,000 expenditure. Yes
terday they had a collective headache as dividend from
(hat fortune. Today, some of the bolder ones to whom
Big G&me Night was only a trial, still have their fore
heads hanging over their eyes and their ears crack
ing as if from a wild elevator-ride.
The addicts of the insidious drug Grid-aine were an
unmoral bunch the last 48 hours, but they were not
immoral. It is characteristic of the American people
that they must have a justification for their orgies.
They frown collectively on the man who gets pie
eyed just for the enjoyment of it. When dissipation is
in order, they first seek a nice healthy reason to back
up their healthy drunks and not-so-healthy hangovers.

Because their reasons for helling are so often blown
\ up to fit, it is questionable how many of "The Night's"
] banjo-eyed blottos really were drowning a sorrow or
celebrating a victory. Actually, many a grizzled old
; ster, blood-pressure and gallstones notwithstanding,
I dissolved himself into temporary Nirvana because he
wanted to, not because the right or wrong team won.
He will repeat the procedure December 31, officially
because it's New Year's, actually because members of
society have seemingly a mutual agreement that they
will not criticize each other for getting pie-eyed that
particular night.

Sociologists and social psychologists could make a
| hum-dinger study of this strange American charac—
1 teristic. They might debate the very interesting ques-
I tion involved: morally justifying the morally unjus
tifiable.
For there can be no question that the joys of the
processed grapes and grains are morally taboo in our
i civilization. Outspoken worship or dissipation, frank
; indulgence in joys of the flesh, is not only an ancient
! paganism, but outlawed practice. We have steadfast
ly clung to the idea that while we can and may in
dulge, we must have a conscionable reason for doing
so.

Many fleshly gourmets, men of intellectual and
I spiritual attainment, see an alarming vestige of puri
tanism in this social more of ours. It would be far
more healthy, and far more indicative of healthy social
j conditions, they say, for us to look at the matter of
physical joy from a rational viewpoint. It signalizes a
j certain moral decadence, they hold, for us to continue
| in the old satisfaction, but feel a compulsion to justify
; them with new social reasons.
They look hopefully to the day when fleshly happi
; ness will be totally disassociated from such raison-d'
etres as the Big Game; when men who get drunk will
do so frankly because they want to, but possibly less
frequently than they do now; when they will not in
j sist that two touchdowns, made or lost, is the reason
' for revelry. —Bob Eisenbach
