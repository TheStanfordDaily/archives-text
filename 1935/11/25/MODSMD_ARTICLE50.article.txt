### 
At the Stanford Theater
B Warner Bros, finally con
sented to lend Dick Powell to
a rival producer (20th Cen- I
tury-Fox) and "Thanks a >
Million" is the result. That the new |
studio has apparently increased the j
crooner's conceit and exaggerated !
more fully his "while-singing" ges
ticulations may or may not add to
Powell's popularity.
Fred Allen, whose appearance is as j
dry as his humor, proves what Jack I
Benny failed to do—that radio come- I
dians can be as funny on the screen '
as on the air. "Town Hall Tonight" '
fans won't want to miss Allen in
this. Second best of the movie's cast \
are the Yacht Club Boys and their i
songs. Paul Whiteman's appearance :
is short enough to be negligible.
Producer Darryl Zanuck has at
tempted to get away from the back- |
stage plots that have predominated !
film musical fare. But this fluke
election story in which Powell runs j

for governor is too disjointed and
runs into too many blind alleys to be
completely successful.
