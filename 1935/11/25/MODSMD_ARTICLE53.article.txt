# FINEST, YET LOUSIEST

The Editor, Sir:
We've probably been treated to
| the finest display of fighting foot
| ball flare on the greensward and the
! poorest priming of pep in the rooting
I section that we shall ever hope to
| witness on the Farm . . .
Perhaps it was that we were sit
ting on the Stanford side of the sta
dium and had the Cal yells flung
j directly in our faces; perhaps it was
! that the Stanford rooters were far
| outnumbered from across the Bay;
| perhaps it was more than that; and
perhaps that is why the man-on
the-street and the sports writers
would rather see a fighting school
I win than one whose spirit seems so
blase.
Now we are no exponent of that
synthetic enthusiasm which is en- i
gendered by Hollywood, but we do '
j heartily believe in a sincere spirit j
â–  which comes from a personal inter
est in what the team is doing, an
I interest which grows from knowing
the men on the squad. . . .
