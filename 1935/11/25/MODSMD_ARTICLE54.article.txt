# MEET THE FROSH PREXY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have read that someone in our
Class of '39 doesn't know either Flor
ence Brown or me. I can at least
say this in reply. I hardly blame the
frosh in question for being disgusted,'
for I am forced to agree with him on
his attitude.
No one has ever consulted me
about anything to do with the presi
dency. No one of any official ca
pacity has ever personally told me

that I was president. If the frosh in
question really would like to meet
Florence Brown and me, he may find
me in 231 Encina, and I'm sure that
I could arrange an introduction to
the secretary-treasurer.
