# Eastern Team Selection Held For Few Days
## 
### 
Stanford's Eastern opponent for
the 1936 Rose Bowl game probably
will not be selected until after next
Saturday, Graduate Manager Alfred
R. Masters announced today.
Many of the Eastern and South
ern teams still considered in the
running for Stanford's invitation will
not have completed their schedules
until after games Thursday or Sat
urday.
Notre Dame, despite a loss and a
tie, is among the leaders in the race
for Stanford's bid, but Coach Elmer
Layden is reported opposed to ac
cepting. New York University, who
takes a tough hurdle on Thanks
giving when she meets Fordham s
Rams, is another strong possibility
in the East.
Pittsburgh, who plays Carnegie
Tech on Thanksgiving Day, and
North Carolina, who meets Virginia
at the same time, are other teams
still in the race, and Masters and
Coach Tiny Thornhill will watch
their activity before granting the
invitation.
Texas Christian and Southern
Methodist, two undefeated Texas
schools, either of which is consid
ered a good bet for the bid, meet in
Fort Worth on Saturday; the winner
here may possibly be invited.
