# Monk's Knee Still Locked From Injury
## 
### 
Monk Moscrip was still unable to
bend his knee joint at 2 o'clock this
afternoon, following an operation by
Dr. Fritz Rolh this morning, and
the extraction of nearly a pint of
blood from the joint yesterday.
Said Dr. Fritz Roth: Moscrip's
knee is no different from any other
injured knee. After being locked
in that manner it's certain to be
sore. There is great uncertainty as
to the possibility of his playing for
the combination of injured knee and
broken jaw, though not serious, is
likely to keep him off the field.
