# Seniors See Bowl Victory In Third Try
## 
### 
As news of the Bowl bid was con
veyed to football team members and
prominent students, reactions ex
pressed their pleasure at this recog
nition of Stanford's football domi
nance in the West, and the chance
which would be given to impress
Eastern sportswriters.
Larry Rouble: If we play, we're
going to win this time. We want to
play a darn good team this year.
Monk Moscrip (speaking from his
hospital bed): I'd like to play an
Eastern team because Eastern sports
writers think Stanford is no good.
Bob Reynolds: I believe Southern
Methodist would accept, and they
would be the best contenders against
us. If they are beaten Saturday, I'd
prefer Notre Dame or N.Y.U.
Frank Alustiza (from Lane Hos
pital): I think Notre Dame would
be the best team rather than South
ern Methodist. I'll be out for Thanks
giving, and I'll be down South for
the game. I was as optomistic as the
rest of the fellows regarding our
getting the bid.
Wally Brooke: The Rose Bowl bid
as a whole means national recog
nition of Stanford's Western foot
ball supremacy. It would have been
better, though, for us to have con
sulted the team regarding accep
tance before unconditionally con
tracting for a New Year's Day ap
pearance. After all, he's taking
away their Christmas vacation, and
they should have been sounded out.
