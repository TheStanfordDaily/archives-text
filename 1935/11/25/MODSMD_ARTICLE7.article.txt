# Psychologist Will Speak on Learning
## 
### 
Speaking on the learning ability
of adults, Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard, pro
fessor of psychology, will discuss the
psychological laws that determine
one's capacity for learning on the
Stanford Radio Hour over station
KGO at 8 o'clock tonight.
Dr. Hilgard, who has done consid
erable research in the field of learn
ing, claims ihat it is a misappre
hension that older people cannot
learn as rapidly as young people, and
that this statement contains just
enough truth to prevent these older
people from attempting to acquire
new facts and skills.
