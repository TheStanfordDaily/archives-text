# Hilgard Declares Learning Capacity Retained by Adults
## 
### 
Although psychologists have es
tablished the fact that intelligence
rnd the capacity to learn new ma
terials reaches its peak somewhere.-
between 15 and 20 years of age, the
adult in the la.si decades of life has
a wealth of experience upon which
l'i draw, and his wisdom may more
than make up for his slightly less
ened speed, pointed out Dr. Ernest
Hiigard in a talk on "Adult Learn
ning" over station KGO last night.
The belief has be com? common
that "you cannot teach ;n old dog
new tricks," and because of this
many people over 50 are afraid to
i (tempt to learn new skills for fear
jf being ridiculed, he said.
Four principles important in eco
nomical learning are: the desire ti
ieurn, understanding of the situa
tion in which learning is to occur,
repetition and practice, and the im
portance of providing some meas
ure of progress as learning pro
ci eds.
In conclusion, Professor Hiigard
.'{.id that psychology teaches as that
our capacity to learn does not di â€¢
minish enough with age to provide
excuses for failure to learn new
things.
