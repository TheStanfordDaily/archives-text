## Indians Want Chance To Redeem Losses 
### 
Upon hearing of Stanford's bid to
the Rose Bowl, members of the
football'team and various campus
leaders expressed pleasure that the
Indians were going to have a chanco
to show their strength at the New
Year's Day game, and that the
'"vowing sophs" would be able to
show that they could win a Rose
Bowl game. Some views follow:
Coach Tiny Thornhill: I think the
kids are more or less anxious to
play down at Pasadena. From the
way they have spoken they seem to
want to go to the Bowl. They want
to redeem themselves down there
after the two losses which they have
suffered.
Phil Coghlan, chairman of the
Rally Committee: The third time
must be the charm. This time I am
certain they will win, after our
showing in the Big Game.
Dick Stark, yell king and chair
man of t.he Cardinals: I am glad we
were selected for the Rose Bowl,
chiefly because we defeated Cal in
.spirit as well as number of points.
Oui Christmas vacation was ruined
last year but we can redeem our
selves New Year's Day.
Jimmy Coffis: I am glad that we
are going to get this chance to show
everybody that we really can do
something in a Rose Bowl game.
Bones Hamilton: If the B.A.C. ac
cepts the bid, I am sure that it wjII
be the ambition of all the seniors on
the team to do well because of their
previous bad showings.
Jeanne Keesling, president or
Panhellemc Council: I think it is
wonderful. They certainly deserve
the honor. I have never seen Stan
ford play a better game than Sat
urday.
Dorothy Sweet, women's chair
man of Rally Committee: I am sura
that the Rally Committee will be
glad to continue activities at the
Rose Bowl game.
Mercedes Bergmann, president oi
Women's Conference: The Rose
Bowl bid is the climax to a hard
fought season and is the last op
portunity for the "fighting sophs"
to prove their right to a high na
tional standing. Lot's all go down
and see them do it in a game that
should top their brilliant football
career.
YVally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president:
The team as a whole have shown
themselves perhaps the greatest
bunch of all-Americans—on and
off field—that Coast football has
produced. They deserve the award.
Perhaps a Rose Bowl rrlly would
show the student body's sincerity.
Chick Franich, junior football
managep: The football managers
are all set to win some more
sweaters.
Don Liebendorfcr, B.A.C. News
Service director: I am tickled to
death that we got the bid.
Bob Gros, student manager: Thoy
wanted it, they worked like hell
for it, they deserved it —they got it.
Joe Vigna: The Los Angeles news
papers are for our playing South
ern Methodist. 1 join them in hop
ing that we'll get that team. I un
derstand neither Minnesota nor
Princeton, wiil come to the Rose
Bowl.
Wes Muller: The third one is the
churm.

to show their strength at the New
Year's Day game, and that the
'"vowing sophs" would be able to
show that they could win a Rose
Bowl game. Some views follow:
Coach Tiny Thornhill: I think the
kids are more or less anxious to
play down at Pasadena. From the
way they have spoken they seem to
want to go to the Bowl. They want
to redeem themselves down there
after the two losses which they have
suffered.
Phil Coghlan, chairman of the
Rally Committee: The third time
must be the charm. This time I am
certain they will win, after our
showing in the Big Game.
Dick Stark, yell king and chair
man of t.he Cardinals: I am glad we
were selected for the Rose Bowl,
chiefly because we defeated Cal in
.spirit as well as number of points.
Oui Christmas vacation was ruined
last year but we can redeem our
selves New Year's Day.
Jimmy Coffis: I am glad that we
are going to get this chance to show
everybody that we really can do
something in a Rose Bowl game.
Bones Hamilton: If the B.A.C. ac
cepts the bid, I am sure that it wjII
be the ambition of all the seniors on
the team to do well because of their
previous bad showings.
Jeanne Keesling, president or
Panhellemc Council: I think it is
wonderful. They certainly deserve
the honor. I have never seen Stan
ford play a better game than Sat
urday.
Dorothy Sweet, women's chair
man of Rally Committee: I am sura
that the Rally Committee will be
glad to continue activities at the
Rose Bowl game.
Mercedes Bergmann, president oi
Women's Conference: The Rose
Bowl bid is the climax to a hard
fought season and is the last op
portunity for the "fighting sophs"
to prove their right to a high na
tional standing. Lot's all go down
and see them do it in a game that
should top their brilliant football
career.
YVally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president:
The team as a whole have shown
themselves perhaps the greatest
bunch of all-Americans—on and
off field—that Coast football has
produced. They deserve the award.
Perhaps a Rose Bowl rrlly would
show the student body's sincerity.
Chick Franich, junior football
managep: The football managers
are all set to win some more
sweaters.
Don Liebendorfcr, B.A.C. News
Service director: I am tickled to
death that we got the bid.
Bob Gros, student manager: Thoy
wanted it, they worked like hell
for it, they deserved it —they got it.
Joe Vigna: The Los Angeles news
papers are for our playing South
ern Methodist. 1 join them in hop
ing that we'll get that team. I un
derstand neither Minnesota nor
Princeton, wiil come to the Rose
Bowl.
Wes Muller: The third one is the
churm.
Upon hearing of Stanford's bid to
the Rose Bowl, members of the
football'team and various campus
leaders expressed pleasure that the
Indians were going to have a chanco
to show their strength at the New
Year's Day game, and that the
