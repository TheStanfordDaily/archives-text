# Indians Discuss Bid To Bowl as Officials Search for Opponent
## Team Will Meet Tonight To Consider Plan Of Acceptance; T.C.U., Southern Methodist, Notre Dame Best Eastern 'Bets' 
### GORDY FROST 
It's Stanford in the Rosi Bowl for the third consecutive year as word
conies from Professor Hugh C. Willitt that once again the Cardinal Red
has been selected to uphold coast honors in the 21st annual New Year's
Day classic at Pasadena.
Tonight at 7 o'clock Coach Tiny Thornhill will gather his hand to
gether in the Union to talk over plans of acceptance. And following that
meeting Graduate Manager A1 Masters will file the official wire to Pro -
fessor Willit to express the opinions and unified thanks of Tiny's gathering.

• Willitt refused to reveal the ex
act vote thai decided the bid for
Stanford but he did make this state
ment: "Stanford is ■the choice of
the conference for the Rose Bowl
game but the voting was not unan
imous." While he declined to en
large on the subject it was under
stood that the Indians received
seven votes, one more than tho
necessary majority. California re
ceived three.
Tiny was joyous when he heard
the news yesterday. Said he: "Tho
boys certainly will be glad to have
another crack at the Rose Bowl.
Maybe it will be different for us
from the last two games there."
Thornhill continued: "It will
probably be three or four days be
fore we make a choice. With so
many colleges turning down invi
tations before they get them, we'll
have to find out who would ba
willing to come."
L;ist night Tiny had no idea who
would be asked. Since no unde
feated Far Ed Mem team playing a
rcpiesentaHve schedule signified in
tention to « ccept, the field lias
greatly dwindled.
There was talk of asking tho
Notre Damo Ramblers, whose
season record is marred with
only one tic and one defeat. And
some thought of Pittsburgh with
a similar record for the season.
But since Notre Dame was tho
one team to beat the Tigers tho
fn\orite here of course would be
the big Green team.
N.Y.U. is undefeated in the East.

bui because of a weak schedule it
is considered an unlikely candidate.
Thus one of the two undefeated
teams, Texas Christian and South
ern Methodist, in the Lone Sta
state, stands a good chance to draw
tho bid. Satiuday they will meet,
and that game will decide which
would be considered.
Weighing ;.ll these matters,
Thornhill, the team, AI Masters,
i.nd other B.A.C. officials and coach
es will scour the field, announce
their decision early next week.
