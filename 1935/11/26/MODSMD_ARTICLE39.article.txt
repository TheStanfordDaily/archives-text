# Farm Joins World in Carnegie Celebration
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Yesterday Ihe world celebrated |
the centenary of one of the great- I
est philanthropists that ever lived |
—Andrew Carnegie. Colleges and j
universities, institutes and libraries |
which have received his benefac- j
tions joined in giving praise to the
man who during his lifetime gave
away $350 000,000.
Three activities on the Stan
ford campus owe their origin to
the Carnegie Corporation of New
York, which was founded after
Mr. Carnegie's death to carry on
his benefactions—the Food Re
search Institute; the Division of
Plant Biology, Carnegie Institute
of Washington; and the research
in occupational interests, under
the supervision of Professor E.
K. Strong, Jr. The latter received
its final installment last week, a
gift of $6,000.
To most students it may be a
surprise that Slanford has such a
well equipped and advanced work
shop for the study of plant biology;
and some, perhaps, for it is not on
the beaten track, may never have
noticed the building, which was
erected in 1929 on Governor's Lane
near the practice field of the Wom
en's Gym.
hi the ultra-modern structure
there are facilities for advanced
work which are being utilized at
the present.time in the study of
plant hormones and plant colora
tion.
The Food Research Institute is
almost exclusively a research de

partment, with its departmental
library and staff of directors who
arc engaged primarily in research
rather than teaching. The prin
ciple lines of work now being
carried on are: (1) An analysis
of the vyorld wheat situation;
(2) A study of fats and oils; (3)
An analysis of the agricultural
situation, foreign and domestic;
(4) A study of the prices of va
rious foodstuffs; and (5) A study
of the chemistry of food sub
stances.
