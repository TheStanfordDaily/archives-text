## 
### 
Stanford's worry over the re
turn of Monk Moscrip to his Palo
Alto Hospital bed following the
Big Game was mixed with joy last
night following an announcement at
Stanford Lane Hospital that the op
eration on Frankie Alustiza's in
jured eye was a "complete success."
Moscrip, all-American end for
the Indians, left the Satur
day with a broken jaw, bruised
hand, and a badly injured knee.
Chief concern over his condition
is hased 011 the extent of the
knee injury.
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician,
operated on Moscrip yesterday
morning for a locked knee joint,
after a pint of blood had been re
moved from the joint Sunday.
Although Moscrip was unable to
bend the knee last night, Dr. Roth
said that did not indicate the op
eration was unsuccessful. He re
ported any knee "after having been
locked is certain to be sore."
Whether Moscrip can play New
Year's Day is a matter of eonjcc
ture and depends upon the re
sponse of (he knee to treatment.
The jaw break is not serious
enough to keep Monk oil the turf.
Meanwhile with the removal of
bandages from Alustiza's eye,
Frankie reported he could see
' 0.K." While he cannot focus the
eye at present, it was said at Lane
Hospital that was merely a matter
of training the vision.
Dr. Hans Barkan, who performed
the delicate operation, indicated
final results would be known only
after Alustiza resumes his normal
active life.
