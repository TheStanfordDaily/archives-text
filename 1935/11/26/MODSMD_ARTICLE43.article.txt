# Fijis Win 1935 Mural Football Title
## Zetes Lose In Overtime Grid Battle Bill Newsom Shoots Pass To Bayer for Victory; Turner, Ginn Star 
### Phil Klauber 
The spectators were even grog
giei than the two teams after the
finish of yesterday's championship !
touch football game in which Phi
Gamma Delta defeated Zeta Psi by
the margin of the well known split
hair.
The teams played through the
tegular game time to a 6-6 tie. !
In such cases intramural rules
call for five alternate plays for
each team, starting from the 50-
yard line.
On the 'iist Fiji play a short pass
took the ball for a 2-yard gain. ;
Then three incomplete passes by
Zc tes and three by Fijis brought up
the next-to-last Zcte play, with Phi
Gamma Delta still leading by two j
yards.
Howell Turner dropped back,
as he hud done so many times j
during the afternoon, and whip
ped a |>;iss far down the field, far
over Maury Ginn's head.
But Ginn is a speedy guy and he j
put on the pressure. He tore down j
ji'st in time to grab the oval about j
knee-high and fell clutching it on j
the Fiji 25-yard line.
A hopeless case for Fijis, to '
make 25 yards in one play. The
looting section yelled, "Send in
Newsom," so Bill unwound his |
sore hip and went in for the final
play of the game he left 5 min
uses before.
Newsom stood 15 yard»s back i
scrimmage, on his own 10, and took [
the pass from Center Al Davis. He i
quickly dropped back to his goal j
line, laid back that right arm, and '
let go.
The pass would put Blower to
shame—so yards in the air to
where Laury Bayer and two effi
cient Zcte backs were waiting.
The three jumped in the air to
gether, and for some reason, prob
ably because it was in the cards,
Bayer fell to the ground with the
ball in his arms, on the Zete 47-
yard line.
One more Zete pass, blocked as
it left Turner's hand, and the game
was over, the players and specta- i
tors lying about the greensward
trying to recover.
The game proper was Fiji in i
the first half, with passes click- [
iug from Newsom and Davis to
Irelan, Goulter, and Bayer for
good gains, and one, Davis to Ire
lan, yielding a touchdown. Davis'
placement failed.
In the second half the Zetes re- |
tahated with their touchdown, scor
ing on Turner's pass to Willie Spen
< er. Gordy Dunn failed to convert. 1
Fiji takes over the championship
vacated by Sequoia Hall.
