AFTER U.C.L.A.
THE lill) WAS DIM
So it's the Rose Bowl again for
Stanford!
Some weeks ago, just after the
Uclan game, \*e were writing words
of optimism, columns of talk on
how "Stanford could reach the
Rose Bowl if—" And tnere were
many who believed the "if" so
strong Stanford couldn't overcome
it.
But everything worked out in
apple pie order. U.C.L.A. was
bowled over by Cal, Stanford
beat Washington, California beat
Washington, and then Stanford
beat California. Ilad it worked
out any other way we'd probably
have been congratulating some
one else on their receiving of the
bid last night.
The Uclan defeat by that one
point did a lot to put Stanford in
the spot she holds today. For had
not the Bruins upset our tribe of
naturally - confident Indians, its
p-ettv certain that Washington,
U.S.C., or California would have
pulled the stunt.
As it was Stanford took the jolt,
saw dreams of a third Rose Bowl
bid go dim, then came back with
undefeatable fire at Seattle to dump
the Huskies and start the trail back
up.
But even then there was an
other slip back down. It hap
pened when Stanford went to Los
Angeles to meet the men of Troy,
with some of that old overconfi
dence still present. And at the

I same time (he Trojans decided
they'd upset the dope and wipe
out the Cards. It took Stanford
SJ) minutes to finally slip through
with their 3-0 victory.
And thon we knew certainly that
• it would be a real battle with Lho
Golden Bears unless the Indians
came through with their best ball
: game of the season. And that they
I clid -
UP AND DOWN
ALL SEASON
It was an up-and down foolbaH
year for the Red. Three c;f the tell—
; tale gannes have been won by'
Monk's kicking. Three times has
Stanford barely eked through on
the swing of a toe. Every major
game has been a scare.
But through it all there were
those who still believed Stanford
host on the coast, though they
agreed that in most of her games
the Indians did not play up to full
ability.
Eut this last one was a different
, tlory. Stanford was set to really
show what she had and every one
of those 89,000 at the game will
agreed that they succeeded. It was
a great end to a sometimes uncer
tain season. And this Rose Bow!
bid caps it off.

While fans were busy talking over
j varsity football happenings of the
week-end, a pair of plenty capable
\ seven-man : ptramural squads were
putting on a real battle yesterday
afternoon right here in our own
back yard.
It was the final game of the tour
ney in which 39 teams have played
; in sum to'.al of 87 games since Sep
tember. Ana if you don't believe
I that's a lot of football, ask Giff
Myers, head of the committee, or
one of the referees. Eighty-seven
football games!
Last night in the final the Fijis

! managed to barely eke out a win
over the Zcte team in an over
time game that would run par
allel with the U.S.C.-Stanford
game in thrills per second. All
14 of the men in that tussle were
clever football players, with set
plays, and definite plans of at

It was an up-and down foolbaH
year for the Red. Three c;f the tell—

Monk's kicking. Three times has
Stanford barely eked through on
the swing of a toe. Every major
game has been a scare.
But through it all there were

agreed that in most of her games
the Indians did not play up to full
