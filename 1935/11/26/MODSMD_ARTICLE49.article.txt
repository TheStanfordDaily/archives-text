# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press And the Rose Bowl Invitation Makes It Complete for Stanford's 'Men of '36' 
### 
Another brief ride in the limelight of the |
nation's interest is oll'ered Stanford with the
proffering yesterday of the Hose Howl hid to
the University hv the Paeilie Coast Confer
ence. For the third straight year the Indians
are asked to represent the West—the first
team in the country ever to receive an invita
tion to play three consecutive panics in the
Bowl.
It is with even heightened pride that Stan
lord can point to its total number of New
Vear's Day participations. Prior to 191(> when
the Pasadena encounter was inaugurated,
Stanford had played Michigan on New Vear's
Day. The coming contest will be the twenty- '
first Hose Howl game; it may be Stanford's J
sixth participation.
Thus it can be seen that despite the "Won- j
der Teams" of California, the Mighty Tro- *
jans of S.C.'s palmier days, and the occasional |
llare-ups of Northern teams, the Western '
grid has been dominated for the past twenty
years by the men from the Farm, who have i
been in almost one Hose Howl game out of :
every three played.
The record book shows that, by scores, j
Stanford lias not been a howling success. Hut j
in the fading memory of those who saw the j
games are many instances of the powerful
play, moral victories, but none too good luck j
of the Indians.

Notre Dame's famous Four Horsemen were
the first opponents of the Cardinals. Although
Stanford outplayed the South Hend men in
almost every department of the game, the
latter by clever use of breaks and tumbles
chalked up a decisive 27-10 win on the hooks.
This was the game that gave to Krnie Nevers,
playing with two broken ankles, his football
immortality.
In 1927, two years later, the Cards were
back again. They oulgaincd and scored on a
dogged Alabama team which was able to come
hack in the last quarter to gain a 7 7 tie. The
next year say Stanford's only Howl win—7 0
over a not overly ferocious Pitt Panther.
Within the current era are the Columbia
and Alabama losses. As sophs, the present
seniors lost a heart-breaker to Columbia in
a field that was literally a sea of mud. Two
plays netted the Lions 7 points. Four quarters
of light and yardage and fumbles left the In
dians with a goose-egg. Last year's 29-13
Alabama debacle, as sponsored by Messrs.
Howell and Hutson, is still a live memory.
So again the men of ','}(> may lead a Stan
lord team Pasadena-ward. To the footballers,
it means not only a chance to refurbish their
prestige and Stanford's, but more days of
sweating practice, and another ruined vaca
tion. To them, Stanford men everywhere owe
gratitude for the fame their work, light, and
sportsmanship has brought the University.

Another brief ride in the limelight of the |
nation's interest is oll'ered Stanford with the
proffering yesterday of the Hose Howl hid to
the University hv the Paeilie Coast Confer
ence. For the third straight year the Indians
are asked to represent the West—the first
team in the country ever to receive an invita
tion to play three consecutive panics in the
Bowl.
It is with even heightened pride that Stan
lord can point to its total number of New
Vear's Day participations. Prior to 191(> when
the Pasadena encounter was inaugurated,
Stanford had played Michigan on New Vear's
Day. The coming contest will be the twenty- '
first Hose Howl game; it may be Stanford's J
sixth participation.
Thus it can be seen that despite the "Won- j
der Teams" of California, the Mighty Tro- *
jans of S.C.'s palmier days, and the occasional |
llare-ups of Northern teams, the Western '
grid has been dominated for the past twenty
years by the men from the Farm, who have i
been in almost one Hose Howl game out of :
every three played.
The record book shows that, by scores, j
Stanford lias not been a howling success. Hut j
in the fading memory of those who saw the j
games are many instances of the powerful
play, moral victories, but none too good luck j
of the Indians.

Notre Dame's famous Four Horsemen were
the first opponents of the Cardinals. Although
Stanford outplayed the South Hend men in
almost every department of the game, the
latter by clever use of breaks and tumbles
chalked up a decisive 27-10 win on the hooks.
This was the game that gave to Krnie Nevers,
playing with two broken ankles, his football
immortality.
In 1927, two years later, the Cards were
back again. They oulgaincd and scored on a
dogged Alabama team which was able to come
hack in the last quarter to gain a 7 7 tie. The
next year say Stanford's only Howl win—7 0
over a not overly ferocious Pitt Panther.
Within the current era are the Columbia
and Alabama losses. As sophs, the present
seniors lost a heart-breaker to Columbia in
a field that was literally a sea of mud. Two
plays netted the Lions 7 points. Four quarters
of light and yardage and fumbles left the In
dians with a goose-egg. Last year's 29-13
Alabama debacle, as sponsored by Messrs.
Howell and Hutson, is still a live memory.
So again the men of ','}(> may lead a Stan
lord team Pasadena-ward. To the footballers,
it means not only a chance to refurbish their
prestige and Stanford's, but more days of
sweating practice, and another ruined vaca
tion. To them, Stanford men everywhere owe
gratitude for the fame their work, light, and
sportsmanship has brought the University.
