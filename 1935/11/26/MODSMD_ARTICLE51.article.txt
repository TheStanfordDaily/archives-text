# Final Meeting of Year
## 
### 
Knthusiastic over Stanford's receipt of the
Rose Howl bid, Daii.y scribblers yesterday
dispensed with their regular meeting,
pounded typewriters, published an extra by
o'clock. The last stall' meeting of the year
19,'t.j, therefore, will be held at 1:150 o'clock
today with editorial board convening a half
hour earlier.

1 lie Diiilij Mini insists lhat the reason Sing
Sing challenged the Army football team is to
prove that the pen is mightier than the sword.
