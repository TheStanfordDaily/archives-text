Harlow Rothert, alumni secretary, got a call from
President Wilbur a few weeks before the Big Game.
"What is the matter, Rothert, my tickets are located

Subsequent observation revealed that Dr. Wilbur
had sent in a check for $3.30 tickets.
Tickets for the Gaieties were plenty scarce last
week. But one gentleman was also plenty anxious to
scare one up. He came into the Dramatic Manager's
office Friday afternoon, explained that he had come
all the way up from the South at the suggestion of
his freshman daughter and he'd be damned if he'd
be kept out. The dramatic manager said he was
sorry and smiled nicely.
The visitor then whipped out a .32 pistol and said
he was sorry and smiled nicely.
The dramatic manager broke into a cold sweat,
said he w;>s sorry, smiled nicely, and said, well, he'd
see what he could do.
