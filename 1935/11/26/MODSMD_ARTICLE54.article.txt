## GET IN THOSE LAST KICKS 
### 
The end draws nigh . . . and through the furious
furor of another Rose Bowl bid . . . those obsessed
with the ambition to achieve honor via the grade
sheet way . . . see the imperative need to apply a
last polish on the figurative classroom apples whose
sheen often bedazzles professors into leniency in
passing out marks.

At this stage, with only two weeks of classes re
maining, old timers in the game of collegiate pork
barreling will tell you that the utmost discretion
must be exercised if satisfactory results for efforts
expended are to be achieved. It seems that profes
sors are particularly sensitive and wary near the
close of a quarter. Whereas during early weeks al
most any gesture such as staying awake in class and
laughing promptly at the right cues will suffice to
shine the apple, as exams draw near, the obvious
must be abandoned and the most subtle tricks of the
apple polisher are in order.

Of course no one should be so naive as to think
that a professor can't recognize apple polishing when
he is exposed to it. He is aware, but not impervious
to it. When a student contributes a bit of informa
tion to his course, asks him to a club tea, or bends
over backward to be ultra pleasant whenever he
meets him, a professor considers it in the same vein
as a citizen receiving cigars from an office seeker.

If a woman has a Petty Pippin-like figure, it is
a coui'teous gesture for her to grace the front row of
the classroom. If you happen to know a professor's
pet interest or hobby, it is always crafty to toss the
ox about it in odd moments. And if a course is of a
Technical nature, it is always wise to have a confi
dential interview with the prof where you can appeal
to him. as an authority, for help in ironing out some
real or trumped up difficulty.

What a prof appreciates and rewards is a reason
able amount of polishing during the first and middle
part of a quarter with but a gentle dose at the end.
For example, if a student hasn't shown Ihe teacher
any attention up until now, it is useless to try to
make up for lost time. But if you've been getting
in a few licks through October and November, now
is the time for a final flourishing swipe.

One would be surprised at the number of pro
fessors who recognize the inadequacy of the whole
grading system, and pass out their marks with tongue
in check, twinkle in eye, on the basis of what they
think the students expect. And there's nothing like a
few well-timed licks on the apple io let a prof know
whether or not you're gunning for a grade.
