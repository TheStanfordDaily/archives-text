### 
; The Editor, Sir:
j As you know, there is a chapter
; of the Student League for Indus
j trial Democracy on the campus,
| which has been duly recognized by
i the administration. Last week, rep
resentatives of this chapter ap
peared before the Executive Com
mittee for the authorization to is
sue regularly a publication repre
, senting a considerable section of
student opinion which, at the pres
ent time, is inarticulate.
It was explained that our pros
pective paper would endeavor to
i deal with problems peculiar to
i Stanford students and would un
[ dertake to organize students in or
der to give the fullest possible ex
-1 pression to their immediate needs.
More specifically, we pointed out,
attempts would be made to secure a
reduction of Union Cellar prices.
Of course, we intended to deal with
general student and world prob
lems, such as war, in the same
manner as is now done by scores
iof liberal and progressive organ
. izations elsewhere.
