# EX COMMITTEE'S SIDE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A brief summary of Executive
Committee's action concerning
L.l.D.'s ridiculous accusation would
be most appropriate. After a
week's investigation of the prob
lem of an extra publication on the
campus I came to this conclusion:
There are certainly rightful rea
-1 sons for opinions expressed con
trary to many of the existing cam
pus conditions. Among the most
vital of these problems is the ques
tion of the Union—its organization
and prices.
I feel that the best way to tackle
i this problem is through our Stu
dent Round Table Group. The
L.I.D. wants the expression to take
place lirst through a fly-by-night
publication. They are by all the
j rules of free speech entitled to
their viewpoints in this question—
; provided they know something of
which they are talking. The Round
: Table will have all the Union
Board of Governors, the Exccu-
I live Committee, the L.I.D. and any
interested students together in a
; discussion—earnestly attempting to
dfal with the problem in an in-
I foimcd logical way.
Regarding Ex Committee's action

of the meeting in question:
As a representative committee
elected by Ihe studen's we are
given constitutional power to
create or dissolve any campus or
ganization r.nd to adopt certain
rules for student control. We are
thu;; within our right in demand
ing "that any organization desir
ing to publish on Stanford campus
be recognized as a permanent or
ganization—that they submit plans
for financing and organization to
Executive Committee." It is quite
plain that in order to protect our
three publications, The Stanford
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral, we
should know how any new groups
will finance a paper. They should
no try to cut-throat our publica
tions in advertising, and above all
they must show us they aren't
financed by an outside group simply
using students to place their propa
ganda on the campus. Fly-by
night publications published once
or twice have in the past died out—
leaving behind an uninformed, un
finished, and biased opinion.
I am not accusing L.I.D. of this.
I am simply stating that this has
happened in the past and that the
Executive Committee wants some
assurance that it cannot happen
again. We have not said "no pub
lishing." It is rather that any group
must live according to rules. The
L.1.D., comparable to a little boy
who is punished for a failure to
comply with some school rules and
cries his eyes out, is acting quite
silly.
They have three alternatives:
(1) They can publish without sanc
tion of the Executive Committee
ond will fall under Dr. Wilbur's
heavy hand if what they publish is
false and uninformed; (2) They can
express theii "gripes" through "Vox
Campi" in The Daily. This is a bet
ter way for temporary dissatisfac
tion; (3) They can conform to our
constitutional rules and publish on
the campus.
We are thus not suppressing "flee
speech." Free speech doesn't mean
uninformed speech.

My action in breaking a tie-voto
on Executive Committee is per
fectly constitutional and, 111 fact, the
last Executive Committee meeting
un; nimously instructed me to dis
regard this "cry-baby" accusation.
The Executive Committee mem
bers are, of course, not infallible,
but attempt ... to act wisely.

lem of an extra publication on the
campus I came to this conclusion:
There are certainly rightful rea
-1 sons for opinions expressed con
trary to many of the existing cam
pus conditions. Among the most
vital of these problems is the ques
tion of the Union—its organization
and prices.
I feel that the best way to tackle
i this problem is through our Stu
dent Round Table Group. The
L.I.D. wants the expression to take
place lirst through a fly-by-night
publication. They are by all the
j rules of free speech entitled to
their viewpoints in this question—
; provided they know something of
which they are talking. The Round
: Table will have all the Union
Board of Governors, the Exccu-
I live Committee, the L.I.D. and any
interested students together in a
; discussion—earnestly attempting to
dfal with the problem in an in-
I foimcd logical way.
Regarding Ex Committee's action

of the meeting in question:
As a representative committee
elected by Ihe studen's we are
given constitutional power to
create or dissolve any campus or
ganization r.nd to adopt certain
rules for student control. We are
thu;; within our right in demand
ing "that any organization desir
ing to publish on Stanford campus
be recognized as a permanent or
ganization—that they submit plans
for financing and organization to
Executive Committee." It is quite
plain that in order to protect our
three publications, The Stanford
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral, we
should know how any new groups
will finance a paper. They should
no try to cut-throat our publica
tions in advertising, and above all
they must show us they aren't
financed by an outside group simply
using students to place their propa
ganda on the campus. Fly-by
night publications published once
or twice have in the past died out—
leaving behind an uninformed, un
finished, and biased opinion.
I am not accusing L.I.D. of this.
I am simply stating that this has
happened in the past and that the
Executive Committee wants some
assurance that it cannot happen
again. We have not said "no pub
lishing." It is rather that any group
must live according to rules. The
L.1.D., comparable to a little boy
who is punished for a failure to
comply with some school rules and
cries his eyes out, is acting quite
silly.
They have three alternatives:
(1) They can publish without sanc
tion of the Executive Committee
ond will fall under Dr. Wilbur's
heavy hand if what they publish is
false and uninformed; (2) They can
express theii "gripes" through "Vox
Campi" in The Daily. This is a bet
ter way for temporary dissatisfac
tion; (3) They can conform to our
constitutional rules and publish on
the campus.
We are thus not suppressing "flee
speech." Free speech doesn't mean
uninformed speech.

My action in breaking a tie-voto
on Executive Committee is per
fectly constitutional and, 111 fact, the
last Executive Committee meeting
un; nimously instructed me to dis
regard this "cry-baby" accusation.
The Executive Committee mem
bers are, of course, not infallible,
but attempt ... to act wisely.
