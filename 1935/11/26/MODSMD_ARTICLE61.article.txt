# WINDS DYING DOWN?

The Editor, Sir:
The League fox- Industrial Dem
ocracy is writing the Ex Commit
tee, asking for more definite and
formal reasons for the refusal to
authorize the League's proposed
publication.
We think students are entitled to
know that President Brooke, in a
manner quite without precedent,
took the initiative and laid down !
the barrier by proposing that for
this and all future proposed stu- j
dent publications, it would be nec- I
essary for a petition to outline in
detail financial arrangements and
editorial policy, and gain the ap
proval of Ex Committee on both.
Only sjx committee members
felt prepared to vote on such an i
effort to suppress dissenting opin
ion. After considerable hesitation,
the vote was deadlocked at 3 to 3, ;
and the deciding vote to ban the |
publication was cast by President
Brooke.
Can it any longer be said that |
the winds of freedom blow upon |
our campus?

Tcti Weems, and Charley Agnew.
all orchestra leaders, are all Deii.s
Sigs. (But not all from the same
chapter.)
