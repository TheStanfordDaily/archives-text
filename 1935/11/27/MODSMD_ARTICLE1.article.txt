# Six Debaters Reach Semifinals, Seek To Retain Coast Crown
## Spring-Luhmann, Harper-Shreve, Gruenberg-Hartmann Win Twelve Teams Left Validity of Supreme Court Decision Argued 
### 
A possibility that Stanford may
retain for another year the Pacific
Coast debate championship won
last year by Dave Mellinkoff and
Bill Rogers at Salt Lake City, loom
ed last night. All three of Stan
ford's varsity teams entered in the
debate tournament of the Western
Teachers of Speech at San Fran
cisco qualified for the semi-finals,
according to word received from
Wayne Richardson, varsity debate
manager.
From a field of over 200 debate
teams which started in the com
petition Monday morning, 12
teams survived five rounds of
debates in the varsity vision by
last night. The sixth or semifinal
round is scheduled to be held to
night.
The th ree Cardinal varsity teams
were those of Bob Hartmann and
Max Gruenberg, Willard Spring
and Mill Luhmann, and Robert
Harper and Charles Shreve.
That all of Stanford's varsity rep
resentatives would reach at least
the semi-finals in this large tour
nament was ascertained by the var
sity intrasquad debate tournament
in which the three teams sent to
the city emerged victorious through
five rounds of debates in a four
week period from a field of 23
teams.
The four other Stanford teams,
two frosh and two women's, did
not fare so well, for all four were
not able to reach the semifinals.
Members of the frosh teams were
John Moskovics, Max Sittenfeld,
Charles Corker, and Phil Halla.
In the two women's teams were
Benita Calmenson, Phoebe Grosch,
Helen Curran, and Virginia
Slater.
All debates are being held on the
Pi Kappa Delta question, "Re
solved: that Congress should be per
mitted by a two-thirds majority
vote to over-ride any decision of
the Supreme Court declaring a
congressional law unconstitutional."
Finals of the tournament will be
held this afternoon. All debates
are at San Francisco State Teach
ers College, and Stanford's delega
tion stayed over at the William Tay
lor Hotel. Last night Debate Coach
Lee Chapin treated Stanford's 14
debaters and debate manager to a
chop suey dinner.
