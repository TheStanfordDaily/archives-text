# Moscrip May Play in Rose Bowl Contest
## 
### 
Monk Moscrip, who suffer
ed a broken jaw, a cracked
knee cartilage, and a bruised
hand in the Big Game, was im
ported as greatly improved by
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician,
last night.
Moscrip was operated on for
a locked knee joint Monday
morning. Last night ne was
able to bend his knee and Dr.
Roth expressed the opinion
that, since his other injuries
are not serious, he would
probably be fit for action in
the Rose Bowl game.
Bones Hamilton has been
treated for a recurrence of the
leg injury that sent him out of
the U.C.L A. tilt last month.
His condition, however, is not
likely to keep him from hold
ing down his right halfback
post on New Year's Day, it
was said last night.
