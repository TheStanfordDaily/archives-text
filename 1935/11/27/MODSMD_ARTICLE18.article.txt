# Laboratory Makes Own 100-Mile Gale
## 
### Jim Hurst 
A 100-mile gale made to orck'i!
That's what Professor Everett P.
Lesley boasts of his wind tunnel i;.
the Guggenheim Aeronautics Lab.
He has a big tube 8 feet in
diameter through which he blows
his gale. At one end the tube ex
pands and lias at its mouth a 12-
foot fan which sucks the air
through at 10 miles per hour.
Strangely, (his makes it move 100
ii.p.h. at the 8-foot part of the
tube.
in the nam w part Professor Les
ley hangs a scale model of the air
plane or wing he is testing with six
wires running up to the floor above.
Here he has automatic electrically
balanced scales which measure the
different lorces acting on the plane
when the wind blows past it. In
♦ his way he c.n tell just how it
would act if it were actually mov
ing through ihe air.
Is your new car rt*ali> stream
lined? Professor Lesley will tell
you that it is not. Tests have
shown that the most extreme of
today's .popular cars are not moio
linn 10 or 1." per cent better in

effective streamlining than those
of 10 years ago.
He wiil alo tell you that over
half the power your car develops
at 60 m.p.h. is used to overcome
wind resistance. And that it really
is possible to reduce this greatly by
m iking revolutionary changes in
the construction and shape of the
automobile.
When you catch up with sound
you're moving pretty fast. But
• that's what happens in propello''
to ting in the Guggenheim Lab.
One of Proicssor Lesley's most
difficult problems is that the tips
of the propcllors get up to a speed
greater than the velocity of sound,
introducing numerous complica
tions in taking measurements.
When in l'/2fi the Guggenheim
Fund for the Promotion of Aero
nautics gave Stanford $200,000, the
old wind tunnel, which stood on
•he concrete floor now used as i
parking j-pac > just north of the Un
ion, was replaced by the present
<ne in tho building behind th™
clock tower. In ten years a great
e'ea! of private and commercial re
-<;trch has been carried on there.

He wiil alo tell you that over
half the power your car develops
at 60 m.p.h. is used to overcome
wind resistance. And that it really
is possible to reduce this greatly by
m iking revolutionary changes in
the construction and shape of the
automobile.
When you catch up with sound

One of Proicssor Lesley's most
difficult problems is that the tips
of the propcllors get up to a speed
greater than the velocity of sound,
introducing numerous complica

A 100-mile gale made to orck'i!
That's what Professor Everett P.
Lesley boasts of his wind tunnel i;.
the Guggenheim Aeronautics Lab.
He has a big tube 8 feet in
diameter through which he blows
his gale. At one end the tube ex
pands and lias at its mouth a 12-
foot fan which sucks the air
through at 10 miles per hour.
Strangely, (his makes it move 100
ii.p.h. at the 8-foot part of the
tube.
in the nam w part Professor Les
ley hangs a scale model of the air
plane or wing he is testing with six
wires running up to the floor above.
Here he has automatic electrically
balanced scales which measure the
different lorces acting on the plane
when the wind blows past it. In
♦ his way he c.n tell just how it
would act if it were actually mov
ing through ihe air.
Is your new car rt*ali> stream

you that it is not. Tests have
shown that the most extreme of
today's .popular cars are not moio
