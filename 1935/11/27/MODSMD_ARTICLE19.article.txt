# L.I.D. Given Approval for Local Paper
## Ex Committee Permits League To Publish 'Student Opinion' 
### 
After three weeks of discussion,
Ex Committee last night granted
L.I.D. permission to publish a cam
pus newspaper, "Student Opinion."
Elizabeth De Vinny appeared to
represent ihe organization which,
she stressed, is "not a tentacle of
an insidious Red network."
Last week the executive group
had said that to publish a paper
the organization must prove its
permanence and submit plans for
policy and finance.
The L.1.D., she said, was recog
nized in 1932. The paper will be
financed by members, and will not
compete for advertising. "As long
as people are going to find out what
liberal ideas are anyway, they might
as well learn now," contributed
Adrienne Johnston. The paper will
be published.
STUDENT INSTITUTE of Pa
cific Relations was granted $25, to
meet expenses of their annual
Thanksgiving conference.
COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT of
a claim against the University was
made. "I have often spoken in a
light and jocular vein," began Bob
Gros, "but I wish to be taken se
riously in this momentous question."
He asked to be appointed to make a
compromise settlement with Julias
Schenkel, not to exceed $10, for
stolen property immediately pre
ceding the Big Game bonfire.
"What property?" inquired Ster
ling Cottrell.
"Well, a house. He demanded
$15," replied Gros. "This is espe
cially grave, as Mr. Schenkel owns
a picnic ground and the picnic sea
son is coming on." Fullenwider op
posed the grant. "No human sym
pathy," observed Jack Hanson,
feelingly.
