# Artists View Fechin's Work
## 
### 
From all over the bay region
artists and other interested visitors
have come to the Stanford art gal
lfly to see the paintings now on
\ lew.
The exhibition, the work of Nico
lai Fechin, is the strongest example
of one man's work ever held at the
fiallcry, accoiding to Pedro de Lj
laos, director.
Fechin has a mastery of his me
dium and a diversity of subjects
seldom equaled among modern art
isis. From qu; int Taos Pueblo come
the settings for many of Fechin's
paintings. Manuel, Grandma Cel
iim, the "Corn Dancer," and others,
are almost living proofs that Fechin
knews his medium and his subjects.
The Feclrn exhibit will complete
its month's engagement December
!â€¢. Tlie gallery is open every day
from 10 to 5 o'clock. There is no
admission charge.
