# Union's Prices Upheld by Roth
## Student Leaders Discuss Matter at Round Table 
### 
Denial that the University "ex
ploits" students through operation
of the Union was expressed by
Comptroller A. E. Roth last night at
the student leaders' round table on
"Tlie Union—lts Prices and Organ
ization."
"It is foolish to say the Uni
versity exploits anyone, since the
Union is run by the students and
no one gets any profit," Mr. Roth
told students and the Union Board
of Governors. "We think it is le
gitimate to operate at sufficient
profit to pay for improvements in
the future."
Mr. Roth pointed out all Union
units buy the best possible food,
have competent help, and efficient
managers, and said such services
obviously cost more than those pro
vided by private restau ran tours.
Labor costs more, he said, because
student help is used and is paid 7
to 15 per cent more than other help
would cost. Another matter in
volved in costs is the fact that the
Union operates only eight months a
year and during that time must
build reserves to run the plant 12
months.
Suggestions made by students
present inciudcd paying hashers
in cash, revision of buying meth
ods—with present system called
by Mr. Roth the best available,
and providing more food for the
same cost.
Christine Ricker, director of din
ing halls, agreed size of portions
probably can bo increased, but said
the difficulty is in deciding what
portion each person wants in
creased.
Mr. Roth explained disbursements
of profits include placing of a cer
tain sum in the reserve for im
provements and turning over of 75
per cent to aid in paying for the
new cheater.
