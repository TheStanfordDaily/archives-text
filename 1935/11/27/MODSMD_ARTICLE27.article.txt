# Eastern Rose Bowl Team Still Unknown
## Princeton Not YetRuledOut; Irish Favored Poor Schedule Weakens Chance of N.Y.U. For Invitation Seek Unbeaten Team Southern Methodist Or T.C.U. May Come 
### 
Silence surrounded Stanford's
B.A.C. yesterday as the current
question "Who will the opponent
be?" was repeated again and again
from one corner of the football
world to the other. Not a word came
from Graduate Manager A1 Masters'
office to satisfy inquiries.
It is understood, however, thai
there still may be some hope of
Princeton accepting the eastern
bid. No declination from officials
of the eastern school has been
made. Only the statement in Tlui
Daily Princetonian indicated that
the Tigers would not consider
acceptance.
Several B.A.C. officials openly fa
vored Notre Dame but at the same
time argued in favor of an unde
feated team, if one could be ob
tained that had played a repre
sentative schedule. Princeton would
fill those qualifications.
N.Y.U. was considered doubt
ful because of a poor schedule
and, if Princeton really is sincere
in her declination, the only re
maining undefeated candidates to
play in the New Year's Day classic
are Southern Methodist and Texas
Christian.
Those two teams meet Saturday
in the Big Game of the South
to decide which would receive the
honor if Stanford officials decide to
award it to the Southwestern cham
pion.
But a hitch lies there, too. For
both those teams have games 011
December 7, much too late for
Stanford to wait for the outcome,
and to take a chance that the east
em Ro.se Bowl squad might: be
tripped up three weeks before the
big affair, is too great.
So the situation remained at a
standstill. No likely candidate
.stood out, and several were given
thought, but all officials preferred to
wait a few days for developments.
