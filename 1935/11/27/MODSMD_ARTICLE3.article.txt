## Loyal Troops March On Insurgents at Natal

RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 26 (/Pi.
â€”Loyal federal troops drove reb
els from their stronghold at So
corro, State of Pernambuco, today,
the government was advised.
This important victory, the gov
ernment claimed, gave it control
of Pernambuco, one of two re
volt-torn states in the northeast.
Federal troops were marching on
the chief remaining rebel strong
hold, Natal, State of Rio Grande Do
Norte. A bombing squadron was
ordered to accompany them.
Insurgents driven from Socorro,
one of three important towns
held since Sunday by the leftist
revolters, fled northwest of Ileifc
(Pernambuco) and prepared for
a stand, the governor of Pernam
buco reported. Socorro fell after
22 hours of fighting.
Estimates of the number of dead
in the uprising, which the govern
ment says is communist-inspired,
ranged from 40 to (>O.
Government officials said a plot to
enlist the first cavalry regiment,
stationed at Rio de Janeido, in the
communist rebellion was blocked.
Lt. Lauro Fontoura was arrest
ed early today on a charge of at
tempting to incite a revolt, in
conjunction with the northeastern
uprising.
Troops moved into the affected
area as the government maintained
vigilance in other states, which were
quiet. The nation is under a "state
of siege," a measure rushed through
parliament last night.
