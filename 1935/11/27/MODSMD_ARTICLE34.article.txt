## 
### R. B. Jones 
This ensuing bit of dabble and
data was collected from the results
of an inquiry tour to learn of the
doings and undoings of Stanfordite>
over the "gobbler" week-end.
Roble Hall, first stop: "I'll be
here; my folks won't let me come
home for fear I'll be in the rest home
again," said the interrogated young
frosh sophisticate with daring in her
tone and a mouthful of peanuts.
A young sorority woman hurry
ing toward the swimming pool wi'S
approached, asked the stocic ques
tion, and left nonplussed. She said:
"My people are English descent

| ant' they don't celebrate any of!
those Turkish holidays."
Encina men had only two an- ;
swers to the Thanksgiving inquiry: |
. ' Life is to give," or "I'm goin' ;
booming!"
Ir; more learned circles the same \
question was askedâ€”a Phi Bete re
i sponded: "What do you think!" il:s |
intelligence wis amazing.
A fraternity man with a slight j
huskiness in his cautious, crafty 1
whisper dared reply: "My brothers
and I are planning some illegal so- ;
rority rushing," and with that he
i stealthily crept away.
