### 
The Editor, Sir:
. . . Much to my amazement and
mortification, several (designating
more than a goodly number) un
gentlemanly slugs from California
attempted to snatch my cheering
hat. Now, oeing an ardent Stanford
rooter and all mat sort of thing, I
wish to express my ideas concern
ing future incidents which may
prove similar in nature.
In short, I wish to suggest at
ihir. time thai ail rooting bonnets
bo reinforced with a chin strap, not
unlike those employed in retaining
a Boy Scout hat. Thus, and mind
jou, thus only may the Stanford
rooter be safe fiom the impetus of
the Berkeley Bears.
Mournfully yours,
Hatless Harry
