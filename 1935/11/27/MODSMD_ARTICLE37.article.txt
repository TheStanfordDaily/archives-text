The Editor, S' •:
Although last Saturday's Big
Game showed a strong spirit of ri
valry between supporters of the
University of California and Stan - I
lord University, we would like to j
mention one incident that proved,
to our group at least, that all feei- ;
ing between the schools was friend
ly and not vindictive.
Coming down from Berkeley, wc j
Mopped for lunch at a Hamilton
Street tea room, just across from the
jJost office. The waiters, who were
Stanford students, certainly showed
the cordial hospitality to be ex
pected of members of a host school, j
After lunch the proprietor, seeing
we looked lt>s", offered us his car '
and even provided us with a driver
to take all eight of us to the sta
dium, so that we would be able *•> I
get there early and without any j
p 'i'king problem.
In spite of any disappointment we
may have felt at the outcome of tho I
t/ame, we certainly came away with
a pleasant remembrance of Stan
ford hospitality . . .
