# Texas Christian-S. M. U. Tilt May Settle Bowl Bid
## Princeton Defends Rating Against Yale 
### Bob Farrell 
Top billing for the* football week
end goes to the Southern Methodist -
Texas Christian battle in Fort
Worth. This pair is among the
leaders in the contest for the east
ern Rose Bowl invitation, and pro
viding Tiny Ihornhill and his once
more-laughing boys do not choose
tin ir opponent before Saturday, the
winner may be the Pasadena-bound
bunch.
S.M.U. is a known quantity,
having experimented on U.C.L.A.
very decisively two weeks back
in the Coliseum. Their intricate
pass-juggling is now famous.
T.C.IJ. has two powerful hacks,
and liy all means a strong line,
hut we know very little of what
they really have got.
The other important clashes are
evenly divided between Thanksgiv
ing Day and Saturday.
N.Y.U., still undefeated and an
other possiblr Rose Bowler, meets
the aggressive, nover-say-die Ford
ham tomorrow in New York.
Princeton, charger of "commercial
ism in the Rose Bowl" and clean
slater, tackles Yale, another good
team but hardly so consistently
outstanding.
Big Interest around here is the
aggression of Washington State,
led by resourceful Ed Goddard,
into Ke/ar Stadium and the con
test with Edward Madigan's Mo
raga Gaels, it is hard to pick
tliis one.
Oregon State is back in Lincoln,
playing Nebraska tomorrow. Other
games of interest for one reason or
another: Cbrnell-Penn, Missouri-
Kansas, Alabama-Vanderbilt, Ten
nessee - Kentucky; Colorado-Den
ver. Saturday: Dartmouth-Colum
bia, Army-Navy, and L.S.U.-Tu
lane.
