MORE THAN A
MILE OF FILM
Saturday was a big day for news
! reel photographers. The live big
companies were all on the spot io
j "'shoot" the Big Game and during
j i/.e course <1 the afternoon ex
i posed approximately 1400 feet p'-v
j c ach.
But that wasn't ill of it.
They're '.till going. k'esterday
j afternoon Tiny Thornhill and Boh
Grayson went before the lens—a
process which has become almost
daily occurrence since the tri
! mnph over those Golden Bears.
| As Tiny obeyed orders to "smile,"
| "look this way," and "now look over
| here" for the Pathe News yester
i day he watched every move, lest he
! make a slip. For he won't soon for
| get a little incident that happened
j back in 1933 just after ihe "sopho
j more wonde won their first Rose
j Bowl bid.
i Photographers were driving them
i all (coaches and team) r-jarly mad.
! Every day it was the "look this
I way," "how about a smile, Tiny,'
j and so on for hours. One camera
! man was ext •emely persistent, fie
j had Thornhill running through the
j shots time and again. It was as it
j Tiny were turning movie star for
j good. Over and over he went
| thi ough the part.
Finally he got just a trifle
burned. So when he was told to
make a salute he quite jokingly
1 thumbed his nose at the camera
man just to make the shot no good.
I But a few weeks later he nearly
I went through the roof of a local
| theater. For there was Tiny Thorn
| K• 11 tumbing his nose while "Stan
ford Red Marches On"! That's one
T ny tells on himself.
MORE LETTERS,
BID SUGGESTIONS
And still mail pours into the
B.A.C. Now most of the letters are
suggesting opponents for the Rose
i Bowl. So far Duke, Ohio Stare,
rootle Dame, Minnesota, T.C.U.,
S.M.U., have all been given plug:,
snme by letr, some by telegram.
As far as actual choice is con
cerned Tiny and the rest of the
officials wear slill as undecided as
ever last night as to whom they
might select. That there is stiil
some hope Princeton might ac
cept, is a curient belief of several
who might know.
I Among the suggestion letters a v
several others informing Tiny how
lucky he was to win the ball game,
j how much better California is, that
j the game went on breaks, that
Stanford looked rotten, etc., etc.
But they don't seem to hurt
Thornhill's feelings a bit. He con
losses belief :n the old •dage: "li's
only the truth that hurts."—-Frost
