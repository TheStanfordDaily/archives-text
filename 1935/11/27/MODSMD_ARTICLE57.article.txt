## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Opportunities Present Themselves For Branching Out in Two Other Directions

While construction on the new theater is
prompting public speaking and dramatics de
partment to anticipate ;i more desirable posi
tion on the Stanford curriculum than they
heretofore have held, announcement has been
made that the University may branch out in
another line and acquire a school of dentistry.
The College of Physicians and Surgeons in
San Francisco is organizing plans for secur
ing a heavy enough endowment to permit the
college to be annexed to Stanford. Dr. Hay
Lyman Wilbur has indicated that the move,
which Ikis been under consideration for some
lime, would be acceptable to the University.
The proposed union is a significant indica
tion of the Farm's desire to branch out in the
number of fields of learning it oilers. Along
•with a dental school, Stanford could increase
her prestige and materially further this policy

in two other lines —by establishing a School
of the Air and building up her music depart
ment.
The Farm is ideally located for instruction
and practical experience in aeronautics and
aviation, and a Stanford School of the Air
would be in line with the Universitv's pro-
I
j gressive program.
The new theater will provide the music de
{ partmcnt, at present not up to the pur estab-
I lished by Stanford's other cultural courses of
study, with the same facilities and opportuni
ties to develop that it oilers dramatics and
public speaking.
While the University is widening its scope,
it might go two steps farther and employ the
double advantage of space and a complete,
; new theater to develop in the badly neglected
; fields of aeronautics and music.
