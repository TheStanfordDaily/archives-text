Delegates to the Student Institute of Pacific
Relations from nearly every Bay Region col
lege and university during Thanksgiving will
hold round table discussions at Asiloinar on
various topics of international concern among
the Pacific countries.
Although the Institute does not attempt to
draft any resolutions or to arrive at any con
clusions on these timely questions, the annual
meetings help to promote international good
feeling among students.
Regarding the Student Institute, David
Starr Jordan, one of the original founders,
said "The more people who come together
on an intelligent international basis the better
it will be, for the contacts they make will do
much to create it better understanding of
each other's attitude toward world affairs.
Youth movements such as the Student Insti
tute of Pacific Relations are useful in the long
run, though there may be a good deal said
and done at such meetings that is not wise.
Nevertheless it is a way of gaining wisdom
and understanding to guide one in the fu
ture."
Her part in this annual Student Institute
is just one example <>l the genuine interest
Stanford has always shown in promoting
Pacific international goodwill.
