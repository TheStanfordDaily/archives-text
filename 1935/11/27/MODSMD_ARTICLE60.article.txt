## COLOR-WHEEL POLICE 
### 
Tabloid yellow and tea pink—these are (he colors of
new examination papers, for lei. it be known that tho
blue book is not alone.
Purportedly at the insistence of a student govern
ing group, and obviously lo foil students who copy
their exams before coming to class, the university
has» substituted ex books of various colors. You and
I won't know what color our particular prof will
pick, so we won't be able to copy our ex in advance.
It's as beautifully simple as that.
It will lower the class average by preventing
scholastic outlaws from grade-:acketeering.
It will give all us honest guys a break.
It will make the most disastrous kind of cheating
a practical impossibility.

And what the University must realize it will also
do is kill the Honor Code. For with the complement
ing of tho blue book goes not only printer's items, but
the whole fabric of Stanford's vaunted scholastic hon
esty. By finding it necessary to resort to this method
of chromatic policing, the University finally admits
that the Honor Code is a fiction.
There can be no other interpretation. For it is
obvious that cheating must exist to be prevented. And
besides foiling the few who do cheat, it automatically
says to the rest of us, "Here's a check you can't gei
around." It assumes, in short, that many of us might
cheat, and takes steps to prevent us from doing so.

The new system is the fir.it sign of the return of
enforced honesty. Again, to cheat or not to cheat is no
longer a matte rof honor, but a matter of which is the
most efficient, the method of cheating or ir.e Univer
sity's method o( stopping it.
True, there are those of us who would never be
tempted to cheat even though the University openly
admitted that it would attempt to maintain honesty
by pure might. But there are a tremendous number
at Stanford to whom the Honor Code is sum and
substance of their ethics, who perhaps were pre
vented from a career of scholastic crime by the Uni
versity's benevolent recognition of their integrity.
When Stanford is not willing to content itself with
the personal policeman within members of this group
and insists on placing its own guard on their hon
esty, there is nothing to prevent them from making
honors the spoils of war between the administration's
all-seeing eye and their individual cleverness.
Furthermore, if the University is going to kill the
Honor Code, why not do a £ood job? Why not put in
proctors, friskers to meet us :<t the door, concealed
watchers to record our surreptitious peeking. For a
person killed by a fine stiletto is just as dead as one
smashed by a steam-roller. —Bob Eiscnbach
