| Damon Runyon, last year a foe of Stanford

! true) concerning the beating the Indians
I would take in last year's Rose Howl game,
climbs out of the pile of Eastern charges of
"commercialism" with a defense of the Pasa

To quote: "Just to straighten out some of
the boys who have a greatly mistaken idea of
the matter, and have never bothered to in
-1 form themselves, the Rose Rowl game belongs
to the Pacific Coast Conference which has just
as much football class from the standpoint of
I ethics, and otherwise, as any other college
conference in the country, and maybe a little
more."
Specifically, El Runyon suggests that the
Rose Rowl committee nominate definite eli
| gihles early in the season, and then select the
Eastern opponent much in the same manner
as the Coast Conference chooses the West's
representative. This, the columnist believes,
would elevate the class of the game by elimi
nating the ever-increasing snubs by Eastern
teams that are sounded out as to whether they
would accept the bid or not.
If the Rose Rowl is to regain its popularity
in the East, some such means of selection will
have to be adopted; snubs directed at the
Pasadena game gradually are giving it a na
tion-wide "black eye" from which it may have
difficulty recovering.
