Headline in Paly Times:
Two Bach Numbers
Will Open Recital
And Chief Zink will perform upon the marimba.
Headline in North Carolina paper:
Duke Upsets Tar Heels
In Southern Mud Classic
As Rain Fails To Stop.
And hurricane goes through guard for 10 yards.
Speaking of headlines, the Daily Cal headed their
story something like: "Cards Get Bowl Bid." and then
spent hours in fasting and prayer hoping that their
typesetter would drop his "R's."
One mora week and ten more days
And I'll be out of the calaboose.
In one more week and ten more days
Thar'll be no hullabaloose.
I can sit me down and introspect
And retire from hurly, burly.
An eight o'clock will mean I do
My Christmas shopping early.
