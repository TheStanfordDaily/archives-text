# DIANA'S DIARY

### THE CO-ED SHOPPER 
Dear Diary; Since this is the lull
before the storm—meaning finals—
I've been doing some serious think
ing about Christmas shopping. The
home town isn't Podunk, lowa, but
it hasn't smart shops like Paly. So
I'm doing my shopping early and
have managed to check a few off
the- list. MARIAN SEIMAS, 534
Ramona, has feminine gifts in lin
gerie, hosiery, gloves and bags that
arc hard to equal. And ideas for
both sexes are at the UNIVERSITY
PHARMACY, 134 University where
Lf.ntheric, Yardley, and Alexanddra
r.e Markoff display cosmetic and
shaving sets. 'Bout the best Christ
mas gift I can give some people is a
tip about the ASSOCIATED STEN
OGRAPHERS, 422 Bryant. Their
rates and efficiency makes it the
place for typing term papers and
theses. I would if I could—go horn°

| for Thanksgiving — but since I
i can't, I'm assuring the family I have
| n't forgotten Ihem by having flow
ers for the dinner table wire home
by the FLOWER SHOP, 175 Uni
versity. I'm consoling myself with
a new Quad outfit from MARY
ELIZABETH'S, 119 University. It'.;
I one of those "Gadabout" suits that
) are man-tailored and come in
matching or contrasting shades of
i brown, blue, and gray. With it
j there's a smart sports hat with ii
droopy brim. For all the gals who
aic left on Ihe Farm for the holi
days, I'm recommending JEROLD'S,
22;) Hamilton, as the place to ea .
It combines ;> quiet, sophisticated
atmosphere with elegant food. I
must be of! now to LYDIA'S, 460
University, for one of her Stanford
Specials — shampoo, finger wave,
1 and color rinse for 75 cenis.
