# Spanish Travel Movies Shown
## Moorish Palaces, Fights Featured in Films 
### 
Moorish palaces in Granada, bull
fights in Seville, and religious pro
cessions in Toledo were shown in
the silent motion pictures of Spain
in the Assembly Hall last night un
der the direction of the Spanish-
American Society.
Tracing a travel tour through the
principal cities of Spain, the film
began with modern Barcelona, go
ing through Valencia, Granada, Se
ville, Toledo, and Madrid. Most un
usual to a western audience were
the ancient ox carts and farm
houses on the outskirts of every
city.
The home of Blasco Ibanez in a
suburb of Valencia was screened, as
were historic cathedrals and pic
turesque buildings. Architecturally
perfect were the Moorish palaces
and fountains of Granada. Then in
Toledo, Palm Sunday was cele
brated with a festive religious pro
cession.
Spanish customs in the towns and
cities contrast decidedly with the
peaceful life of the surrounding
country. But everywhere the his
toric past mingles imperceptibly
with the modern present. Madrid
is the best example of this fusing.
