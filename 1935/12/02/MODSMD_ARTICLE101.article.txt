# DEFENDS CAL "SPIRIT"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Referring to your charges of so
called unsportsmanlike conduct at
the Big Game of the California
rooting section, did it ever occur to
,\ou that the everlasting chant of
the Stanford rooters of "Poor Cal'"
was anything but good sportsman
ship? . . .
This incessant chant, which got
'<n the nerves of the general ticket
buying public, seemed to be the
on'y thing the Stanford boys had
m the way of a yell. . . .
We fail to s<:e any insult in the
so-called "Nazi'' salute—to the pub
!c it looked more like a friendly
"hail" to the victors.
The sportsmanship at Berkeley is
no whit different from what it is at
Stanford—they are just a bunch of
pood kids with the same type of
ideas as the kids at Stanford, and
certainly all the good sportsmen in
the state are not confined to the
Stanford campus.

No charges of unsportsmanlike
conduct were made by The Daily.
Garbled press reports were to
blame for such inference.—Ed.
