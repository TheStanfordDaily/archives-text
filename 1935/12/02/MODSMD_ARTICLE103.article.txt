# NOT FIVE BUT HUNDREDS

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford is going to have a Speak
ers' Bureau, but not with only "five
members who will receive requests
from various organizations for
Stanford entertainment" as was an
nounced in Wednesday's paper. You
evidently confused the Speaker's
Review Board — that will pass on
speakers' qualifications — with the
Speakers' Bureau itself.
Tlie former board includes five
members: the president of the As
sociated Students, Wally Brooke; a
faculty adviser, yet to be chosen;
two debaters; and the bureau man
ager. The Speakers' Bureau will
have as many good speakers as will
s'gn up. The following have already
signed: John Morrcll, Gib Hollo
way, George Halloran, John Mur
phy, Ed Shuck, Willard Spring, Carl
Bat row, Robert MallcU, Rupert
Prohme, and Joel Stein. There will
be a real place for women speak
ers, too. The bureau's membership
will not be limited to five. Rather,
we look for an organization of a
hundred or more.
