Radical activities were claimed by Brazilian authorities to have been
the cause of a bloody four-day revolt in northern provinces, in which
nearly 150 were killed. Soldiers equipped with gas masks (lop) and
artillery of the federal government were rushed north to stamp out the
rebellion. (Associated Press Photo.)
