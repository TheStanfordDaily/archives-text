# Gauge Lab Performs 'Hair-Splitting' Feats
## 
### Jim Hurst 
If you asked Professor Merrill S.
Hugo how long your ruler is, his
leply would probably be something
like (his:
"It's 12.02471 inches long, within
four millionths of an inch."
It sounds a bit extravagant, per
haps, to try to measure millionths of
r.n inch, but that's exactly what
Professor Hugo does every day in
his gauge laboratory. He can take
a human hair split into 30 parts and
tell just how thick any one part is.
Here's how he does it! Care
fully packed away in velvet lined
cases he has many sets of steel
blocks of assorted sizes. The lengths
of these have been calibrated by the
United Stales Bureau of Standards,
and serve as a standard of reference
for the whole Pacific Coast.
By piling these blocks up until
his instruments show they are the
same height as the object being
measured, Professor Hugo can get
an exact value for its length or
thickness. The measuring faces of
the blocks are so smooth that when
Iwu of them are properly "wrung'

| together it takes 200 pounds to pull
directly apart a pair of one-inch
cubes.
There is another device in the
, «augc lab which will measure the
length of a bar of steel so accurately
that the expansion caused by plac
ing the hand around the bar for a
moment makes a very noticeable
change in the indicator. To give
some idea of just what this accu
racy means, the length of the Quad
1 —1000 feet—bears the same ratio to
the thickness of an ordinary sheet
ni drawing paper as does-one foot
to the smallest object that can be
measured in the guage lab.
In the near future Professor Hugo
; hopes to establish an absolute unit
of measurement of his own which
will be independent of the Bureau
of Standards. This means he will
have an inch-length standard that
is as accurate as any the govern
ment has. At the present time the
Stanford gauge lab performs in
valuable service to West Coast
:n; nufacturers by testing and cali
brating the gaug»s so essential to
| modern mass production.
