## Indians Meet S.M.U. In Pasadena Game; Harvard Wire Hoax Cambridge Paper Sends Daily Explanation Of Puzzling Incident 
### Herb Diamond 
Last week Stanford B.A.C. offi
cials were puzzled, if not greatly
surprised, upon receipt ot a tele
gram from Harvard University ;
v/hich stated regretfully that the j
Crimson was unable to accept the j
Indians' invitation to appear in the i
Rose Bowl.
For more than a few reasons j
Graduate Manager A1 Ma>Â»ters
had cause to be troubled. He was
tor tain that Stanford bad invited
no grid squad to the New Year's
Day conflict; also no indication j
liad been given to the effect that
Harvard had or would get the
bid; and, finally, lie had not even !
communicated with Wiiliam J. !
Bingham, Crimson faculty ath
letic representative.
A fast check-up with telegraph ,
officials revealed Ihat the wire, j
signed with the name of Henry j
Clark, actually had been Kent from j
Cambridge. But when nothing more j
was heard from Harvard, the whole I
affair was diagnosed as a hoax.
And such was actually proved !
I the case yesterday when The Stan
] ford Daily received the following j
telegram from Stanley Salmen, of j
The Harvard Crimson:
"Telegram groundless accord- !
ing to Bingham although Har- ;
vard-Yale agreement forbids j
intersectional championship and '
post-season - games. No Henry |
1 Clark on Crimson. Probably ;
Lampoon hoax. With our rec- ;
ord obviously no undergraduate I
sentiment. Last Harvard Athletic
Association correspondence re
fused 1932 post- season game."
Thus whatever niysterv might
have grown out of the first tele
gram was officially cleared up.
The "undergraduate sentiment"
! referred to in the second telegram
j retracted the statement in the first
! message which announced that
! Harvard undergraduate sentiment
j definitely favored participation in
the clash at Pasadena. Moreover,
1 the entire incident was laid to the
i Harvard Lampoon, campus humor
j publication.
