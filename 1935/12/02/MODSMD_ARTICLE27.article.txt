## Princeton Stands Firm Texans Asked Following Win Over T.C.U. 
### Gordy Frost 
Undefeated Southern Methodist
University will play Stanford in the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
The invitation, climaxing a week
of silence on the matter, was is
sued last night by Graduate Man
ager Alfred Masters, who telephoned
to Dallas, talked to S.M.U.'s James
Stewart, athlctic manager. Less
than an hour later a return call
from Texas officials announced ac
ceptance of the bid-
Masters expects to contact the
Mustang officials again today or
tomorrow in arrangement of pub
licity, tickets, and other incident
als of the meeting.
Princeton was never contacted by
Stanford officials, Masters explained
last, night, since it was understood
that the Tigers had no thought of
accepting an invitation should it be
issued.
In a telegram to The Daily, Bill
Carlile, editor of The Daily
Princctonian, confirmed that be
lief, saying: "Because of an agree
ment with Yale and Harvard to
the effect that none of the liig
Three- would play a post-season
game, it was indicated that Prince
ton will not consider an invitation
to represent the East against Stan
ford."
Masters declared last night that
in selection of S.M.U. he chose the
available team that would give
Stanford the best ball game on New
Year's Day.
He reports that in Los Angeles,
where he spent the week-end
"feeling-out" the situation, all sides
were in favor of a S.M.U.-Stanford
meeting.
"Since the Mustangs staged
their spectacular aerial victory
over U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles sev
eral weeks ago. Southern Califo
nians have been clamoring for
another opportunity to see them
in action." was the way he ex
pressed it, and they will have that
chance on New Year's Day.
It cannot help but be a sensal ional
affair. With Stanford strong on the
ground, meeting S.M.U., whose ae
rial circus has created much com
ment there promises to be plenty
action.
A victory will mean much to
Stanford. In the past two years
the Indians have played twice and
lost twice on the Pasadena grid.
This time they arc on the spot.
And similarly will it mean much
to S.M.U, for long have the Mus
tangs hoped for this opportunity to
break into the national football
spotlight.
All indications point to a great
football spectacle on New Year's
Day.

break into the national football
spotlight.
All indications point to a great
football spectacle on New Year's
Day.
Undefeated Southern Methodist
University will play Stanford in the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
The invitation, climaxing a week
of silence on the matter, was is
sued last night by Graduate Man
ager Alfred Masters, who telephoned
to Dallas, talked to S.M.U.'s James
Stewart, athlctic manager. Less
than an hour later a return call
from Texas officials announced ac
ceptance of the bid-
Masters expects to contact the
Mustang officials again today or
tomorrow in arrangement of pub
licity, tickets, and other incident
als of the meeting.
Princeton was never contacted by
Stanford officials, Masters explained
last, night, since it was understood
that the Tigers had no thought of
accepting an invitation should it be
issued.
In a telegram to The Daily, Bill
Carlile, editor of The Daily
Princctonian, confirmed that be
lief, saying: "Because of an agree
ment with Yale and Harvard to
the effect that none of the liig
Three- would play a post-season
game, it was indicated that Prince
ton will not consider an invitation
to represent the East against Stan
ford."
Masters declared last night that
in selection of S.M.U. he chose the
available team that would give
Stanford the best ball game on New
Year's Day.
He reports that in Los Angeles,
where he spent the week-end
"feeling-out" the situation, all sides
were in favor of a S.M.U.-Stanford
meeting.
"Since the Mustangs staged
their spectacular aerial victory
over U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles sev
eral weeks ago. Southern Califo
nians have been clamoring for
another opportunity to see them
in action." was the way he ex
pressed it, and they will have that
chance on New Year's Day.
It cannot help but be a sensal ional
affair. With Stanford strong on the
ground, meeting S.M.U., whose ae
rial circus has created much com
ment there promises to be plenty
action.
A victory will mean much to
Stanford. In the past two years
the Indians have played twice and
lost twice on the Pasadena grid.
This time they arc on the spot.
And similarly will it mean much
to S.M.U, for long have the Mus
tangs hoped for this opportunity to
break into the national football
spotlight.
