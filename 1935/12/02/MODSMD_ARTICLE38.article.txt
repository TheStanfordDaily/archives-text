Two army fliers escaped death or

crashed into a barn after being j
forced down by fog and ice on the i
wings.
Cadet Pilot P. E. Armspaugh and j
Sergeant J. E. Gazek were en route '
from Cleveland to Boiling Field,
Washington, D.C., and seeking an ;
emergency landing field. The ship j
struck first in a plowed field,;
bounded in the air, and leaped
across a highway into the barn.
