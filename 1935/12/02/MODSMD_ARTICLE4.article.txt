### 
MANILA, Dec. 2 (Monday) (/P). —
The China Clipper hopped off from
Manila Bay at 2:52 a.m. today (10:56
a.m. Sunday, San Francisco time)
for her return flight to the United
States with the Orient's first load of
trans-Pacific air mail.
The big flying boat left three
hours ahead of her tentative
schedule because she was flying
against the sun and Captain E. C.
Musick wanted to get under way
before dawn.
A 60-hour flying schedule to Ala
meda, 8000 miles away, lay ahead.
She is due to arrive there Decem
ber 6, just when her sister ship, the
Philippine Clipper, is to take off for
its first hop to the Philippines.
The return flight was started just
two and a half days after the China
Clipper sailed in to complete her
maiden air mail voyage across the
Pacific, which also required 60 hours
of flying.
Only Captain Musick and his
crew of eight was aboard. Pan-

however, the Clipper would pick
up other company employees at
Wake and Midway islands for
transportation to Honolulu.
These employees have been on the
job nine months at the mid-Pacific
air bases. On her westward flight
the China Clipper carried men from
Honolulu to relieve them.
Pan-American officials said the
Clipper planes wolild make at least
five trips before undertaking to
carry regular passengers.
