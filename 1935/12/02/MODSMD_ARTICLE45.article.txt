PARIS, Dec. 1 (/Pi. — Diplomatic
souices said tonight Premier Pierre
Laval had met a "blank wall" in
his efforts to persuade Premier
Benito Mussolini of Italy to make a j
peaceful gesture before December |
12 in order that France might seek !
postponement of a League of Na- [
lions oil embargo.
Officials said hopes for a peace- I
ful settlement of the Ethiopian war
had dropped to a new low in view
of the Italo-British deadlock over oil J
sanctions and the tension in the j
Mediterranean Sea.
In diplomatic circles it was re
ported Mussolini not only had re- !
fused to halt his military advance
into Ethiopia or to withdraw more
troops from Libya, but had re
peated his warning that Italy |
would consider the oil ban an
unfriendly gesture and had threat-, 1
cned to send back the Libyan
division he withdrew some i
weeks ago.
Officials said France is resigned |
to the oil sanction, to be considered J
at a meeting of the league com- j
mittee of 18 in Geneva Decem

They were convinced that unless
il Duce shows a willingness to talk !
settlement before that date there I
will be little hope of bringing peace
in Africa before spring.
Mussolini's refusal to make a
friendly gesture before the com
mittee muetL'ig, it was thought,
would assure Franco-British co
operation on the sanction.
