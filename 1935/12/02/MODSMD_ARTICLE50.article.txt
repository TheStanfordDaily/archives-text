### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (:P).â€”'The |
government requested a loan of |
$900,000,000 tonight to finance the
winter work relief peak and in
crease the treasury's store of ready
cash.
If (lie full $900,000,000 is raised, ;
the nation's public debt will be
pushed to a new all-time high of
about $30,500,000,000, since it
stood at $29,641,(506,134 on No
vember 27.
A statement by Secretary Mor- ,
genthau offered for cash subscrip- j
tion an issue of $450,000,000 in 2 : U
per cent 10-year Treasury bonds
and an equal amount of IM> per cent
five-year Treasury notes.
In addition, holders of $418,000,- |
000 in 2V2 per cent Treasury notes [
maturing December 15 were of
fered (he privilege of exchanging
these securities for either the new
bonds or notes.
The secretary's announcement in- j

eluded the proviso, however, that |
the total of the new issues may be j
incieased in direct proportion to the
amount of the maturing notes ex
changed.
Thus, if, as would normally be j
the case, 80 per cent of th<? matur- j
ing notes, or about $335,000,000, are j
offered for exchange, the total of
the newly issued securities would
be increased by a like amount to
more than $1,200,000,000. The re
mainder would be redeemed in cash, j
This would bring the total of j
such borrowings since the pres
ent fiscal year began last July 1 |
to more than 81,700,000,000.
It would leave, according to Pres- j
ident Roosevelt's latest estimates, 1
fome $862,000,000 to be borrowed in
the remaining six months of the
fiscal year. The chief executive's
figures were based upon a presump
tion the $5,145,000,000 allocated for ,
recovery and relief would be spent.
