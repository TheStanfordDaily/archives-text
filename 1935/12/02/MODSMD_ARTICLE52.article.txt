WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (/Pi.â€”A I
i 1935 business census intended to j
! provide an up-to-date chart of the
| entire economic structure of the na
tion has been initiated as a $7,784,000 I
work-relief project.
Authoritative sources reported
today, however, that tho launching
I of the program had been marked by
a sharp argument between the
Census Bureau and WPA. It cul
minated in a declination by census
officials to hire a heavy staff of
tabulators immediately for the di
rect purpose of thinning out the
i relief rolls.
