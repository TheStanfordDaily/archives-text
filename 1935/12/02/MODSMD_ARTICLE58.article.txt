# Pros and Cons Of Prohibition Debated Again
## Both Sides Ready For Renewal of Fight 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (/P).â€”Two
years after repeal, the two sides of
the question are marshaling forces
again for new battles over prohibi
tion.
With pledge-signing campaigns
and social activities, temperance
leaders are directing their efforts
now mainly to educating young
people against "the dangers of
drinking."
One prominent leader of the tem
perance movement predicted in an
off the record statement that na
tional prohibition would return
' within 10 years" if the 'evils" of
repeal were not corrected.
The repeal advocates, who be
came quiet after the passage of the
21st amendment, are rousing again
to meet the new temperance drive.
Some once-active forces on both
sides have withdrawn from the
fight, disbanded or turned to other
fields.
