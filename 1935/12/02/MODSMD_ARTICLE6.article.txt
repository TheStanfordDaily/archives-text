PITTSBURGH. Dec. 1 (/P).â€”Six
year-old Edward Brugas chatted to
night with his anxious parents about
Santa ClauA and school while the
white corpuscles of his blood stream
fought a strange poison that already
has taken the lives of his brother
and sister.
Coroner W. J. McGregor said he
believes the poison had been ab
sorbed from a metal container by
cabbage which the Brugas family
had for dinner on November 16.
