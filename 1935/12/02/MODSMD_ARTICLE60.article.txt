## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA. Dec. 1 </P).—
The fate of young Jesse Livermore
Jr., 16-year-old scion of a prominent
family, rested in "the lap of the
gods" today.
Figthing against death from a
bullet assertedly fired by his mother,
Mrs. Dorothea Wendt Livermore, in
the climax of a mother-son drinking
bout at their Montecito mansion, the
boy was believed "slightly better" at
Cottage Hospital.
"But we can't tell yet what will
happen—his chances rest in the lap
of the gods," Dr. Irving Wills, at
tending physician, said.
Thirty blocks from the hospital,
locked in a drab dormitory cell in
the county jail, was the youth's
bobbed-haired mother, the one-time
girl bride and now the ex-wife of
Jesse Livermore Sr., spectacular
Wall Street plunger.
Nervous, distraught, and suffering
from an upset condition, she con
, tinually asked about her son.
