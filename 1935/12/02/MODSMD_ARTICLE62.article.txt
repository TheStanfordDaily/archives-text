Pickford technically is now an em
ployee of the national government,
having accepted a post on the county
advisory board of the National

ambitions for a political career,
"I'm a little too busy trying to be
a worthwhile human being," she
replied. "That's a full-time career,
nowadays."
And it was for that very reason,
she said, that she replied in the af
firmative recently when Judge Ben
Lindsey, famous for his work in the
juvenile courts, asked her to accept
a position in the national youth |
movement.
