# THE 						TOBOGGAN SONG
## 
### 
(Tune: "Put on Your Old Gray Bonnet")
Get on the Big Red Toboggan—
The Injuns are a-joggin',
And they'll take California for a r<de;
Hear the Bear a-roarin'
Over Stanford's scorin' . . .
Berkeley's on the downhill* slide!
* Can substitute the adjective Thornhill
. as a variant.
Grayson
Git along, Bobby Grayson—
Stanford's score needs a bracin'—
Git along to that California goal!
Oh the Bear's a-runnin'
For the Injuns are gunnin'—
California's in the hole!
Moscrip
Oh, the Golden Bear's a beauty
But he's scary of the bootie
That adorns Monk Moscrip's deadly toe —
For our Monk's a kicker
Who has proved a sticker
For the best Coast teams you know.
Hamilton
Oh. the pigskin's a-moving
To the Bear goal, and proving
There's a Stanford player known as Bones,
Who's a "Big Game" hunter
And a sure-shot punter—
Hence those California fnoans!
Reynolds
Oh, we'll hitch "Horse" Reynolds
To the Big Red Toboggan,
For we know he's rarin' for the job:
Hear the ol' Horse a-neighing!
California's a-praying—
For the Bears can't stop Our Bob!
Muller
Keep your spioe stiff, Muller—
The Cardinal's our color,
And today we'll hang it in the sky;
For the Blue and Gold's a-trailing
And the Golden Bear is failing . . .
So we'll hung his hide up HIGH!
Rouble
Attaboy, Larry Rouble—
No California boob'll
Catch Our Larry loafing with the ball . . .
For he'll rate his glory
When they write the story
Of the old Big Game this fall!
Adams
Take the pigskin, Woody . . .
Give him hell where he stood—he
Never should have gotien in your way:
Oh, the Bear halfback'll
Ne'er forget your tackle
Till his golden wedding day!
Topping
Git your gun, Keith Topping!
Keep the old Bear a-hopping—
It's a dead-sure cinch the Reds'll win;
Down the field he's tracking
(Hear his backbone cracking!)
Watch us wear the old Bear's skin!
Beedle
Yonder goes Dale Beedle
Through the eye of the needle—
He's a wow at diving through a hole!
Every plunge Dale's making
The Cardinal's a-taking
Nearer California's goal!
Paulman
Oh, the Bear's due to fall, men!
He'll sure trip over Paulman
When our Bill goes tearing 'round the end . . .
So goodbye, California—
Don't say we didn't warn ya
All about our Indian friend!
Alustiza
Sure we miss Alustiza—
But we all know thjit he's a-
Looking on from the sidelines while we win;
So we'll hop the Red Toboggan
And we'll send the Bear a-sloggin'
While we watch old Owl-Eyes grin!
Coflis
Watch our microscopic CofTis
Do the duties of his office,
Which include the .-.kinning of the Bear-
And he does said skinning
(For the Big Game's winning)
In a style that proves he's THERE!
Vigna
Take the ball with you, Vigna . . .
The Golden Bear has seen ya,
And he's making backtracks for his den!
Don't let gold-plating blind you,
For the Injuns are behind you
With the vim of Stanford men.
