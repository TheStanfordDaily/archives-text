# Indian Poloists Upset Arizona Four
## Last Period Flurry Gives Varsity Win Cardinals' 5-to-3 Victory Over Wildcats Wipes Out Earlier Loss 
### Phil Ward 
When a college team succeeds in
jolting the University of Arizona :
four into the losing side of the
| ledger, that team in one thrust es
lablishes itself as one of the out
i standing aggregations in the West.
The Indian squad did just that
last Saturday afternoon in Tucson
by defeating the Ari/.onans, 5 to 3,
after having dropped the first of
j a two-game series on Thanks
giving Day, 10 to 2.
Going into the series as decided i
] underdogs after taking it on the
chin from their hosts in five sue- j
; cessive games last season, the Cardi
nals turned the trick during the sec
j ond contest as they staged an In-
I dian uprising to break a lie in the j
! last ehukker wiih a two-goal flurry.
The additional handicap of be
! nig mounted on Arizona ponies,
j with which they were entirely j
unfamiliar, also faced the Stan
j ford team, composed p[ Leon
I Derby, Carl Beal, "Rammy"
; liasmussen, Bob Fullerton, and
I alternate Johnny Dwyer.
The players, along with their
I coach, Captain Haydon Grubbs, re-
J t umed to the campus this morning
! and will start practice immediately
iin preparation for the Midwiek
I Junior Polo Tournament to be held
lin Pasadena over the Christmas
j holidays.
