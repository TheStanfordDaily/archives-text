# Boston Pros Beat Pirates

### 
BOSTON, Dec. 1 (#•). —Boston's
sadly battered Redskins completed
their National Pro League home
season today by putting on a bril- j
liant fourth-period rally to gain a
13 to 3 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates in a heavy snowstorm.
The Redskins, whose previous vie- j
tory came in their opening game last j
September, appeared doomed to
their ninth consecutive setback until
they made their surprising and be- i
lated stand.
Armand Niccolai, former Du- 1
quesne place-kicking star, had boot- !
ed over one of his six field goal at
tempts, in the second period from
the 27-yard line, and Pittsburgh's
three points seemed enough to de- j
cide the game until the last five I
minutes of play.

Delaware has a portion of a
c h cle for its northern boundary. It
is drawn with a radius of 12 miles, (
from the center of the town of 1
New Castle.
