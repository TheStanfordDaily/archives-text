HERE'S A REAL
( OMPLIMENT
The Kansas City Star is known
throughout the country for con
sei vativeness. Last week the Star's
sports editor, C. E. Mcßride, wrote
words of praise, far from conserva
tive, about Stanford's Ail-American
Bobby Grayson. Coming from one
cf America's sports editors whose
viewpoint is impartial, the following
paragraphs of praise carry weight:
"Bobby Grayson, the greatest
hack in football.
"Naturally Stanford undergrads
and grads believe that but they
have a right considerable sup
porting army, including this
wiiler, if (hat makes any differ
ence to anyone.
"Football is iilied to the outer
brim with wonderful backfield
stars this season, but in my book
Bobby Grayson of Stanford leads
the pack.
"By way of emphasizing just
how complimentary such a rating
is let us sketch through a mention
of some of the marvelous hacks of
1935 football—
"Bobby Wilson, 130 pounds of
Southern Methodist dynamite;
F-uivid of Marquette; Jay Berwan
ger, Chicago, an all-American solo
ist if ever there was one; Bill
Shakespeare, Notre Dame, worth
all-American for any team; Jump
ing Joe Williams, Ohio State;
George Roscoe, Levois, and Siedel
of Minnesota; Chuck Cheshire of
U.C.L.A.; and Bones Hamilton of
Stanford; Pilney of Notre Dame and
A1 Barrabas of Columbia; LeVan
ci Princeton; Haines and Cain of
Washington; Blower of California;
Carideo of Notre Dame; Harry Shu
ford of S.M.U., Goddard of Wash
ington State, and Sammy Baugh of
T.C.U." (Of less importance, Mc-
Bride listed a dozen others, which
for lack of space, are not repeated
here.)
He continues: "And Bobby
Grayson is greater than any or
these.
"There is no way of proving
that, so if you have another to
offer in place of Grayson with
the same descriptive words we
have no desire to argue the mat
ter, but we slick with our choice.
"Bobby Grayson, football's
greatest running back . . . and
how he can smack down oppos
ing ball carriers when he surges
in to meet them."
We agree with you perfectly, C.E.,
perfectly. —Frost

HERE'S A REAL
( OMPLIMENT
The Kansas City Star is known
throughout the country for con
sei vativeness. Last week the Star's
sports editor, C. E. Mcßride, wrote
words of praise, far from conserva
tive, about Stanford's Ail-American
Bobby Grayson. Coming from one
cf America's sports editors whose
viewpoint is impartial, the following
paragraphs of praise carry weight:
"Bobby Grayson, the greatest
hack in football.
"Naturally Stanford undergrads
and grads believe that but they
have a right considerable sup
porting army, including this
wiiler, if (hat makes any differ
ence to anyone.
"Football is iilied to the outer
brim with wonderful backfield
stars this season, but in my book
Bobby Grayson of Stanford leads
the pack.
"By way of emphasizing just
how complimentary such a rating
is let us sketch through a mention
of some of the marvelous hacks of
1935 football—
"Bobby Wilson, 130 pounds of
Southern Methodist dynamite;
