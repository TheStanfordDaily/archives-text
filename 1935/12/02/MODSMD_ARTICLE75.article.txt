# Brilliant Wins in South Close 1935 Soccer Season
## Indians Beat L.A. Jaysee, Bruin Teams Underdog Card Varsity Takes 3-0, 2-1 Upsets Despite Injuries 
### 
Winding up their season by play
ing two of their best games, Stan
ford's varsity soccermen defeated
Los Anyeles Junior College, 3 to 0,
and U.C.L.A., 2 to 1, in the south
during the vacation.
Both games were played on the
field belonging to Victor McLag
len, soccer-loving movie actor.
The Indians downed L.A.J.C.
Thanksgiving Day and took the
measure of the Bruins Saturday.
With their line-up riddled by
injuries, the Cards were under
dogs in both contests, but came
through with soccer at least equal
to that which they showed Big
Game day in losing to California,
2 to 1.
As the Bears defeated the south
ern junior college team Saturday
by the same score as Stanford did
Thursday, Dick Bullis' men might
have given California all the com
petition she could handle in her
last game.
A banquet for coaches and play
ers of all four teams officially closed
the season Saturday night.
