| "California Here We Come"
1 croaked 20,000 Southern Methodist
i rooting voices as the Mustangs went
shower-ward after the hectic 20-14
victory over Texas Christian at Fort
Worth Saturday.
The S.M.U. rooters meant tha(
by their victory they remained the
nation's only eligible unbeaten
team to play Stanford in the Rose
Bowl. Whether they cheered in
vain or not wil! be decided soon
by AI Masters.
The game sounded over the radio
| more like a cross-country juggler's
act or a kids' game of keep-away
then a championship grid war. For
the country's greatest passer—Sam
my Baugh—was pitching for T.C.U.,
and many other agile athletes were
! snaring them and throwing others—
laterals and forwaids.
In another tilt which was called
by Biick Morse "the IhrUlingest
of the season," Babe Hollingbery
gesticulated and worried his team
into a 7-7 tie with Slip Madigan's

[ Galloping Ghosts of Moraga, 2-1
1 favorites in the betting.
Hollingbery was helped in no
; small way by the antics of his prize
halfback, Ed Goddard, and by Mel
JJohansen, sub center from Enuin
; claw, Washington, who booted the
| conversion that tied the score.
I In the East, Army capitalized on
three breaks and made one sus
tained drive, motored b> halfback
Monk Meyer, to subdue Navy,
28-G, in a victory that was not as
one-sided as it sounds.
Holy Cross rounded out their un
defeated season by toppling Boston
College, 20-6. Fordham trounced
N.Y.U., 21.-0, on Thanksgiving Day
;to render Ihe latter no longer a
choice for Rose Bowl honors.
Al Barabas. the fellow who
licked Stanford in Pasadena two
years ago. starred in his last game
i with Columbia, to upset Dart
j mouth 13-7.
Other results: Ucla 13, Idaho 6.
I Princeton 38, Yale 7; Georgia Tech
- 19, Georgia 7; L.S.U. 41, Tulane 0.
