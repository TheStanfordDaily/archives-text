## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Ex Committee Gives Its Slight Impetus To Democracy's Need of Free Speech 
### 
"Democracy is safe only where men are
free to discuss public questions and to criti
cize the government," I nited Press reports
Harvard Professor Thomas N. Carver as be
lieving, after he addressed the Western Di
vision of the t .S. Chandler of Commerce in
Honolulu Saturday.
"It is only where freedom of speech and of
the press are permitted and safeguarded and
where the abuses of government can be ex
posed to merciless publicity that the common
man is safe," Dr. Carver told the business
men.
With Fascism rampant in several Euro
pean nations and astute observers expecting
Communism there v»hen the dictatorships fall,
no middle - of - the - road, sane course seems
open to Western civilization save Democracy.
As Dr. Carver pointed out, and as many have
propounded before liini, tree speech and ac
tive resentment of governmental oppression
by the common people are the life-blood of a
functioning democracy.
I>v their very nature, universities are so
constituted that they can and should be in the
fore of the light for free expression. Fostering
of that faculty is ;t prime university function.
Stanford must have had something of the
sort in mind when it adopted "Die Lull der
Frieheit Weld" (the wind of freedom is blow
ing.) as the I'niversity motto.

Reconsidering the L.l.D.'s request for an
organ of student opinion, the Ex Committee
last week showed itself as a friend of the right

' of dissent. While realizing thai L.1.1), opinion j
might not coincide with their own, Ex Com
inittee granted the L.1.1), the right to publish
theirs, after assuring itself that the organi- !
zation's permanence and financial plans war
ranted the action.
The Administration has not publicly an
nounced any action sanctioning or opposing
the paper, since as yet it is considered a stu- i
dent matter. After publication, the paper will
be subject to usual I'niversity executive con- j
trol. The Administration, no foe to liberalism, !
is not likely to interfere with the publication
as long as it stays within the bounds of truth
and "decency.
Responsibility now rests upon the L.1.1), to
make the most of its right to publish minority
i views. While it can do good by attacking
j vulnerable spots, it can eradicate itself by j
! criticizing without investigating, by denounc
ing without truth, or by surpasing the bounds
; of decency.
A poor auspice would be to select "Student
j Opinion" as the title of the forthcoming pub
lication, when the paper will not really be that,
I but merely the opinion of ;i minority section j
! of the A.S.S.U.
If, as Dr. Carver points out, free speech is
a necessity for democracy, the Ex Committee ,
has aligned itself with groups throughout the I
land striving to maintain that underlying !
principle of American society. The burden
j now lies upon local L.1.1), members to do their
part as a minority group in a forceful but
i acceptable manner.
