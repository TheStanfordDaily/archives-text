# Bull Session
## LULL IN THE STANFORD SCRAMBLE 
### 
It's a well kown . . . but not fully appreciated . . .
fad that when the familiar bells . . . whistles . . . and
chimes . . . burst into noi.se at noon a week from
next Friday . . . official Stanford activity will cease
for probably the longest mid-year period in 40 years.
* a »;i
Twenty-three consecutive days without roll calls
and assignments. For this we can give thanks for
the 29 students from New York, the 15 from Penn
sylvania, the 14 from Massachusetts, the 11 from Con
necticut, the two from Maine, and for the prowess of
11 football players.. To allow enough time for every
student to go home at Christmas was the principal
reason for this longest of academic lulls. The Rose
Bowl gets credit for a day.

While a gleeful bull session on the subject of the
long vacation was being carricd on last night, some
one presume d to offer one of those ultimate bits of
reasoning, and declared that tlu> University was wast
ing the students' tim? with prolonged vacations. Four
years to get a college education? That's hypocrisy.
It takes less than 22 months of going to school and more
than 25 months of vacation. That, at least, is what
the calendau shows.
* * «
It a student talks i.o President Wilbur long enough,
he is almost sure to hear him say, "Most students don't
realize that they can >.*o through college in three
years. He means, of course, that a Stanford college
term is not thief quarters, but four. Actually the
ground can be covered in a whole quarter less if a
student can carry 17 units in a load.
♦ • + *
Suppose, it it is not too revolting, that colleges
were put upon a business-like six-day a week basis
with no Saturdays off and only one-day vacations at
Christmas, the Fourth of July, and Thanksgiving.
I hen how long would ii take to get that all-important
degree? On the present basis of 15 units a quarter, it
would take exactly two years, two months, and three
days.
But if one should seriously advocate such a scheme
he would be branded as ludicrous lame-brain, and
his plan as farcical. To suggest that a college student
spend even the gre iter part of h s time at his school
work is tc<> absurd to be considered. One must have
time to cultivate those all-important "associations,"
and bask in the "'cultural atmosphere" of an institu
tion of higher learning. Besides the strain of con
tinuous study would be too great a burden for fiery
young 20-year-olds. And the fact that there won't
be three-week vacations when college is left behind
of course doesn't have any bearing on the matter

Twenty-three consecutive days without roll calls

11 football players.. To allow enough time for every
