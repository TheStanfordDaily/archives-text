In Connie's opinion, it's the
: FUR impression that counts.
Maybe that's why so many
: smart people have been cry
ing their eyes out for kid
: caracul ascots to top off their
suits, coats, and dresses. The

I Peter Piper
: No, this isn't a "tobacco
: pouch" even if Connie has
named it "Peter Piper." It's
a handbag, that's what, and
a lady's bundle of elegance,
: Indeed. Luscious suede, black
or brown, with golden eye
[ lets, spiked ends, and a silken
draw-string. The pay-off for
it in the "first place" would
be nigh unto $10, but Connie,
"copy-catted" the number for
: $2.9.>. Inside zipper part con
s' tains mirror and coin purse.
: A nice enough gift for any

Ashes may be good for the
moths in Oriental rugs, but
they're certainly no asset to

miss them. Italian pottery
