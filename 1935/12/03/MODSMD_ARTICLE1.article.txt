LONDON, Dec. 2 {A*).â€”The British government, with Europe tense as
a result of sanctions developments, announced tonight immediate reorgani
zation of anti-aircraft defenses in the London area.
The action follows expansion of the Royal Air Force recently.
A division of four-unit aircraft groups was formed, each group larger ;
than an infantry brigade. Headquarters of each group will he established

where it can best co-operate withi
the Royal Air Force.
Predictions that oil shortly will
be added to the list of sanctions
against Italy were made freely in
authoritative quarters tonight after
a three-hour session of the Cabinet.
No Decisions Told
The Ministers struggled with com
plicated international issue's, includ
ing the threatening question of oil,
and domestic matters, on the eve of
the opening of parliament. They ad
journed without announcing their
decisions.
Pcacc Unlikely
II is most unlikely, it was said in
authoritative circles, that there will
be any developments for peace be
fore a meeting December 12 of a
league committee of 18 to consider
an oil embargo against warring Italy.
Possibility of developments now
for peace rest wholly in the hands
of Premier Laval of France who,
it was said here, is making a su
preme effort to get some peace
concessions from Premier Musso
lini before Laval confers Satur
day with Sir Samuel Iloare, Brit
ain's Foreign Secretary.
