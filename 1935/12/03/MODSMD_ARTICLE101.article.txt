HOLD YOUK HATS. FOLKS!
Finals are almost here and we're almost there.
"There," if you please, doesn't mean the Christ
mas hearth. It means in or out—of Stanford, high or
low—in the Bawlout. Portended by more than the
weather or the lines in your hand is the fact ttast
"Dor Tag" is in the offing. Characteristically those
of us who have skidded down the months since sunny
September 23 on tlie rubber mounting of procrastina
tion find the seals of our scholastic pants uncom
fortably hot.

And whether in the high, low, or close classifica
tion, we are tearing home for the books. Some of us
will merely round off the rough spots, steady our
selves as we slide into the grading machine. Others
will go into the business of making convolutions
wholesale, mental riflings to fit the bore of the .scholas
tic cannon. Stil! others, gifted with a photographic
mind and a super-spsed perception lens, will flip the
pages and retain a lasting and perfect image of a
term's thought and work.
Regardless of our varying mental mechanics, the
final result will level us all. For the University will
grade us not on how we got the dope, but the fact
that we have it —for three hours.
* * * <
Arid more importantly, most of us, probably all of
our family and friends, many potential employers, wdl
grade us likewise on the possession of those bare facts
and their delivery on schedule. There is no thought
of the time when the perfect image of the photographic
mind will have faded, when the mental rifling will have
worn away, when the ordered pile of well-learned
knowledge will be eroded into a hardly perceptible
mound.
There is no thought, moreover, of what will be
left .it that far-off day when we should be enjoying
the vaunted benefits (if a college education. There is
no confession that ihe neat facts we slammed down
on paprr will have slipped us entirely, that we will
fumble on junior's elementary algebra and get our
mental stimulation in a bridge table argument.
There is little anticipation, less provision, for the
actual end result of our four yea.'s sis social appren
tices. And that end, old grads will tell you, is not
encyclopedic knowledge or the sterile smugness of
the "well-informed," but the tinv, comforting flash
of recognition while listening to someone else. It is
the pleasure of realizing "I've heard of that," and
offering some pathetically small, perhaps garbled
addition to the stream of conversation.
Those who have gone before tail us that the little
momcn ary flashes of recognition are worth the battle.
We might as well believe them.

the pleasure of realizing "I've heard of that," and
offering some pathetically small, perhaps garbled
addition to the stream of conversation.
Those who have gone before tail us that the little

Finals are almost here and we're almost there.
"There," if you please, doesn't mean the Christ

low—in the Bawlout. Portended by more than the
weather or the lines in your hand is the fact ttast
"Dor Tag" is in the offing. Characteristically those
of us who have skidded down the months since sunny
September 23 on tlie rubber mounting of procrastina

will merely round off the rough spots, steady our
selves as we slide into the grading machine. Others

mind and a super-spsed perception lens, will flip the
pages and retain a lasting and perfect image of a

Regardless of our varying mental mechanics, the
final result will level us all. For the University will
grade us not on how we got the dope, but the fact

worn away, when the ordered pile of well-learned
knowledge will be eroded into a hardly perceptible
mound.

fumble on junior's elementary algebra and get our
mental stimulation in a bridge table argument.
There is little anticipation, less provision, for the
