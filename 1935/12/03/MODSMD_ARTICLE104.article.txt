# HURRY! HURRY!

Yesterday was positively the first day of De
cember.
The Gloomy Moor, one of Our Hasher's old fa
vorites, started passing his pin around the Pi Phi
house again. The wandering ornament finally came
to rest on the dress of one of the sophomore wonder
team. Another brilliant chapter was then added to
the tempestuous affairs of the dark one. For 14 con
secutive days, the two patronized the S.F. ballrooms,
but they decided they weren't seeing enough of
each ether. Arrangements were made for the two to
walk to their class in the morning. So at 8 o'clock
Wednesday morning, while inside his fraternity house,
the Moor was tiding his last shoelace, ihe sophomore
was pacing up and down in front of his fraternity
hou.se, wailing for the Moor to make his appearance.
