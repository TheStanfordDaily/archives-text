extensive debate in Ex Committee last week, ihe
deep-thinking student leaders decidcd nothing was to
be done but pay the owner $10 for his loss. So a
letter asking the gentleman if that would be satisfac
tory was dispatched. The answer came back:
"Mr. Robert Gros:
"Received your letter in regards to check covering
loss of "small house" and will except same, but money
alone cannot reembur.se me for loss of so useful a
convenience and ihe only way I can excuse the loss
is that it was done in bonfire enthusiasm. Hoping
the next time the students need wood they will choose
a less useful piece of architecture,
Yours truly,
