## THE 						LONDON THEATER 
### 
(Continued)
The two most popular plays of
ihe moment are comedies, superbly
acted and well directed.
For the first time in London's,
theatrical history, its two greatest
actresses tread the boards in the
same play and really share honors
without clashing at the back-drop.
Dames Sibyl Thorndyke and Marie
Tempest appear in a light and clever
comedy called "Short Story."
Dame Tempest, famous for her
timing, points her comedy with a
subtle finesse which completely con
trols the audience; Dame Thorn
dyke, as a poor but proud and
grand-glorious lady, captures an
equal share of laughs by a broadly
comic characterization.
The play itself is trivial and will
px-obably not cross the Atlantic with
any degree of success. The plot
centers around the third angle of
the eternal triangle, which here
happens to be an English impres
sion of an American girl, played
well enough by Ursula Jeans.
The other play, "Call It a Day,"
stars Fay Compton and Owen
Nares. Here acting honors go hand
in hand with those due C.' L. An
thony, the playwright. Miss An
thony scored a major hit with "Au
tumn Crocus," and if I don't miss
my guess, "Call It a Day" will be
in the first ten best plays of 1933.
The story covers the Hilton fam
ily's emotional activities from early
morning until the last light is
switched off in the master bedroom
with the day's adventures settled.
Each member of the house, in
cluding the servant staff, is faced
with an unusual infatuation quite
by accident; tho solution in each
case is reached by nightfall. Char
acter is solidly built in nine swift'y
moving scenes.
Noel Coward will bring a series
of one-act plays to London later on
