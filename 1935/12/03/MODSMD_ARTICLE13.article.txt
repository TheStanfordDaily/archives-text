# No Gain Seen for Japanese in China

### John Rice 
"Japan will gain nothing through
expansion in Northern China," Ya
mato Ichihashi, professor of Japa
nese history and government, told
The Daily last night. "The people
are poverty-stricken and starving
not only because they pay such
enormous taxes to the nationalist
government but also because of the
disastrous and frequent crop short
ages."
The people of Hopei, Northern
China province, have been pay
ing huge sums in annual taxes
on the promise of the nationalist
government that the money
would be spent in welfare work
for their territory, said Irhihashi.
When the relief did not come, the
llopeians tried to appeal to the
Japanese and thus avoid paying

! the exorbitant taxes.
Many a plausible excuse has been
made for these demands for aid,
but the professor doesn't believe any
(of them really valid. That both
China and Japan would benefit jf
the communists were driven from
the territory was one of the excuses.
"Foreign powers have no rea
son to he apprehensive at Japan's
move." stressed Ichihashi. "Jap
; an has greatly improved condi
, lions in Manrhoukuo. That prov
ince's trade with other nations
lias been materially increased by
Japan's work."
Historians have seen that North
ern and Southern China have never
been able to get along together,
concluded the professor. He sees
little hope of unity under any gov-
I et nment.
