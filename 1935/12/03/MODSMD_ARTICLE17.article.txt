### 
Tomorrow will bo the final day
that students will be able to pur
chase rooters' tickets for the Rose
Bowl game in Pasadena on New
Year's Day. The sale which opened
yesterday will be open today and
tomorrow until 5 o'clock, and after
that B.A.C. official say there will be
no more available. Approximately
500 of the tickets were sold yester
day. The ducats cost $1.10.
J. C. Irwin, ticket manager of the
8.A.C., announced last night that
the gate number is not marked on
the tickets, because of a change in
the arrangement of the fence, but
that all students who hold rooters'
tickets in sections 4 and 5 should
enter Gate C. Irwin advises that
students write this down on their
tickets at the time of purchase, so
that they will be able to avoid con
fusion on the day of the game.
Students desiring to work at the
game are requested to sign employ
ment cards at the B.A.C. offices on
either Thursday, Friday, or Satur
day of this week, after sale of root
ers' tickets has been closed. Appli
cations for work will not be ac
cepted from any students whose
cards have been punched, showing
the purchase of a rooter's ticket.
A possibility that students may
obtain special train rates to Pasa
dena for the game was seen yester
day by Bob Gros, student man
ager.
Gros said there probably will not
be sufficient demand to insure a
special train, but he is negotiating
with J. H. Larky, Southern Pacific
passenger agent, for a special stu
dent rate to the game. However, if
sufficient students desire a special
train, it can be obtained, Gros says.
