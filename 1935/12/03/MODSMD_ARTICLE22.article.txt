# Spaeth Derides Jazz Tonight
## 'Tune Sleuth' To Speak On Modern Music 
### 
■
! Debunking modern music, the :
' "Tune Detective," Dr. Sigmund
j Spaeth, will lecture on "Jazzmania" |
! in the Assembly Hall tonight at
| 7.30 o'clock.
"Jazz," says Dr. Spaeth, "and mod- |
crnism in general, is a distortion of !
the conventional." He proceeds to |
! show how all the organizing fac- j
! tors of music can be distorted to ]
! produce new, exciting effects. He j
] will also give his opinion of the fu- j
i ture possibilities of some of the bet
j ter elements in the modern move- j
! ment.
A well known figure on screen, j
j stage, and radio, Dr. Spaeth is not j
only an authority on music, but j
holds a Ph.D. degree from Prince
ton University, was music critic!
for the New York Evening Mail for
four years, and has written 13 i
books.
In his lecture, the speaker will j
j give a study of the entire modern |
| jazz tendency as it appears, not;
! only in all the arts, but in life it- j
self. Much of his talking will be
I done informally at the piano, and he ■
1 will punctuate his remarks with
| snatches of music and song.
