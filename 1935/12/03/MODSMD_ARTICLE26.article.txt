### 
I
As the hustle and hustle of selecting a Rose Bowl opponent subsided
yesterday, Tiny Thornhill and B.A.C. officials swung into action, an
nounced their plans of action for the coming Southern Methodist-Stanford
I battle in the Hose Bowl 011 New Year's Day.
They set down the following

■ course:
1. Tiny himself will leave Stan
ford tonight for College Station,
Texas, to scout S.M.U. as she
plays Texas A. and M. next Sat
urday. From there he may go to
Los Angeles to see U.S.C. play
Pittsburgh, but this latter move
is still undecided.
i 2. Stanford varsity players will
work out informally for the next two
weeks. Tiny has instructed each man
to govern his own training, and to
take workouts when convenient.
3. On December 14, following fi
nals, the team will reassemble for
practice on the Farm training grid.
At this time signal play and per
haps a few scrimmage sessions will
be in order.
4. On the night following
Christmas. Stanford headquarters
will he moved to Los Angeles
where the squad will continue
workouts until game time.
5. Men who live in Southern Cali
fornia will be permitted to leave on
December 24, the day before Christ
mas, in order that they may spend
the Yuletide at home.
6. And the grand reunion of all
forces is scheduled for December
27, at the Los Angeles headquar
ters. At which hotel the team will
base its operations in the southern
city is still undecided.
Thus the Stanford army carefully
1 laid down plans of attack as the
j third consecutive Indian Rose Bowl
battle looms not far distant on the
j horizon.
On the coming Saturday Stan
ford will forget all about a future
meeting with S.M.U. and do some
prayerful rooting for the oppo
nent-to-be. For the whole success
of the New Year's Day meeting
depends upon that game Saturday
i between the Mustangs and Texas
A. and M.
The Aggies lost to Texas Christian
by but one touchdown, 19-14, and
may seriously threaten S.M.U. Stan
ford lays her cards and hopes on the
Mustangs to keep their undefeated
! record until New Year's Day.

As the hustle and hustle of selecting a Rose Bowl opponent subsided
yesterday, Tiny Thornhill and B.A.C. officials swung into action, an
nounced their plans of action for the coming Southern Methodist-Stanford
I battle in the Hose Bowl 011 New Year's Day.
They set down the following

■ course:
1. Tiny himself will leave Stan
ford tonight for College Station,
Texas, to scout S.M.U. as she
plays Texas A. and M. next Sat
urday. From there he may go to
Los Angeles to see U.S.C. play
Pittsburgh, but this latter move
is still undecided.
i 2. Stanford varsity players will
work out informally for the next two
weeks. Tiny has instructed each man
to govern his own training, and to
take workouts when convenient.
3. On December 14, following fi
nals, the team will reassemble for
practice on the Farm training grid.
At this time signal play and per
haps a few scrimmage sessions will
be in order.
4. On the night following
Christmas. Stanford headquarters
will he moved to Los Angeles
where the squad will continue
workouts until game time.
5. Men who live in Southern Cali
fornia will be permitted to leave on
December 24, the day before Christ
mas, in order that they may spend
the Yuletide at home.
6. And the grand reunion of all
forces is scheduled for December
27, at the Los Angeles headquar
ters. At which hotel the team will
base its operations in the southern
city is still undecided.
Thus the Stanford army carefully
