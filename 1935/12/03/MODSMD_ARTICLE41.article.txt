### 
TIENTSIN, Dec. 2 (YP). â€”American j
intervention today ended a brief i
Japanese uprising. It was an indi- I
vidualist effort, strictly nonpolitical.
A Japanese, apparently drunk, |
invaded the matron's office of Vic
toria Hospital, fired a revolver, and
threatened to go amuck.
Dr. J. W. Colbert, an American,
ended his "occupation" by knocking
him out and turning him over to
police.
