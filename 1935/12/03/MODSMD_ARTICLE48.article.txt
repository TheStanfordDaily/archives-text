# Independent Study Gaining Popularity
## Rita Szekeres 
### 
Many a Stafford student has
found independent study a boon to
learning. Progressing at his own
speed along lines which particularly
interest him, the conscientious stu
dent learns twice, sometimes three
times as much as his class-bound
fellows.
Lower Division independent j
study, more properly called indi
vidual study, lias become increas- ;
ingly popular. In fact, this fall al
most 100 sophomores wanted to
carry on the work in elementary
economics 'and political science.
Lack of funds limited the number
actually "going on independent" in I
these courses to 33.
Independent study necessarily
costs the University much more per
student than regular class study. !
Individual (or with others in i
small groups) conferences with in- I
structors add amazingly to the drain i
on administration coffers. Rocke- I
feller Foundation, through its gen- i
eral education board, saw the bene
fits of independent work in more !
elementary studies, granted the Uni
versity $100,000 in 1931 to expand
the plan to Lower Division courses. !
Since the grant, 1,054 Lower Divi
sion students have helped spend the I

money under lhe guidance of 31
instructors.
Today more thrn 100 freshmen
will be allowed to proceed inde
pendently in History of Western ,
Civilization. Half that number be- |
gin individual study immediately in
! sophomore history.
j To proceed independent of lec- !
tures and sections, a student must 1
| admittedly show above-average !
work in a subject. Unusual inter
| est is an obvious requirement, for
: the work is more extensive.
