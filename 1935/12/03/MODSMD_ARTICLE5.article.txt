# Elmore Speaks On Roman Poet
## Discusses Horace's Life, Poems on Radio 
### 
A brief glimpse of the Roman poet
Horace after an interval of 2000
years shows him as a significant and
appealing figure, said Dr. Jefferson
Elmore in a talk during the Stanford
Radio Hour last night. As long as
men have a place for poetry and
insight and geniality of spirit it is
safe to say that he will not be out
of fashion.
The great poet was born Decem
ber 8, in 64 8.C., so that the two
thousandth anniversary of his birth
will be celebrated within this week.
His birthplace was the town of Ve
nusia on the southeastern coast of
Italy. Being the son of an ex-slave
he had a great handicap in an aristo
cratically organized society.
In spite of this he had the best
possible education in Rome and later
in Athens, where he met Marcus
Brutus, and served under him in
the army for several years. Return
ing to Rome, his poetical works were
greatly admired by the emperor Au
gustus.
In putting his ideas into effect.
Horace used short poems, usually
about 25 lines in length, which
greatly added to their artistic cffect.
In their subject matter these poems
reflect various aspects of the poet's
life and character.
