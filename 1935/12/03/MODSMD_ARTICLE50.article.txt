# Soccer Team Ends Season Third Place
## Cards Play Best Game In South Against U.C.L.A., L.A.J.C. 
### 
Following two victories over U.C.
L.A. and Los Angeles Junior Col
lege during vacation, Stanford soc
cermen completed their 1935 season
with five wins, one tie and four
defeats, placing third in the league
behind U.S.C. and California.
Victories over Los Angeles Jun
ior College, 3 to 0, and U.C.L.A.,
2 to 1, in the south during vaca
tion climaxed a season of steady
improvement for the Indian soc
cer team. Coached by Dick IJullis,
a student like themselves, the
Stanford kickers played their
best games of the season during its
last week.
Dave Sloane, star halfback, gave j
the Cards a 1-0 lead in the Bruin ;
tilt Saturday with a beautiful 25- i
yard kick in the first quarter. Karl 1
Schaupp's goal in the third period I
won the game, as the Uclans scored I
a few minutes later.
Itch Hall, Pete Knecht, and Ma
rio Si nines kicked the Stanford !
goals in the L.A.J.C. contest on j
Thanksgiving Day. All were made j
in the first half, Bullis' men had
little trouble with the jaysees; !
so all the reserves making the trip ;
south were used in the last two \
quarters.
Soccer experts in Southern Cali
fornia, including Victor McLaglen, i
on whose field both games were j
played, agreed that Stanford showed
the best teamwork of the four elev
ens which appeared. California also
played the Uclans and L.A.J.C., and I
displayed several individual stars. |
Barney Vicrling, captain and
fullback, and Herb Sawyer, right
in.'ide. are on crutches with an in- .
jurcd knee and a sprained ankle, '
respectively. Bob Hall had six
stitches taken below his right eye
after being kicked.
Stanford opened the season with |
little practice under its collective
f-occcr belt. Losses to U.S.F. and
San Mateo J.C. and a scoreless tie
with San Jose State were results of j
October games. November saw
improved Indian team, which de- i
feated San Mateo, 2 to 0, and San
Jose, 3 to 1. California trounced the
Cards, 5 to 0. at Berkeley in the first J
of the Bear series. '
Hitting their full stride, the In- I
dians conquered San Jose, 3 to 1,
on November 20, and barely lost
to the Gold and Blue eleven by a
2-1 margin on Big Game day.
The line-up which played most
was composed of Paul Helms, goal;
Captain Barney Vierling and Jim
McCormick, fullbacks: Bob Hall,
George Hatch, and Dave Sloane, [
halfbacks: Chuck Parker and Ed i
Nightingale, wings; Pete Knecht and
Herb Sawyer, inside; and Karl
Schaupp, center forward. Helms, 1
Vierling, Hall, Hatch, Sloane, Night- I
ingale, and Schaupp were outsfand- j
