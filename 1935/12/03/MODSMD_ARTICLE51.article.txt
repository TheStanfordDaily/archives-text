# Pasadena Tussle Heads New Years Day Grid Program
## 
### 
With the gridiron wind-up just
I about played out after last Satur
! day's games, only a few straggling
j extra-season tilts and the regular
i big-time championship games re
i main of the 1935 season.
Heading the list is the Rose Bowl
classic, with Stanford and Southern
' Methodist fighting for a mythical
j world's championship on New Year's
j Day.
The flossy Mustang passing attack
being what it is, it will take much
i ushing by Ends Monk Moscrip and
Keith Topping, some fast second
ary defense work by the backfield
j and We.s Muller, ;.nd enough scoring
punch to win the game from the
| never-stop Texans.
At the same time in New Orleans'
: Tulanc Memorial Stadium will be
j enacted the annual Sugar Bowl
j fracas. L.S.U., with the rousing
I 41-0 win over Tulane last Satur
day, has already cinches the south
ern bid, and Nebraska, Holy Cross,
Fordham, and Marquette are in line
! for the other spot.
Third big game on 1936's birthday
! is the East-West Shrine encounter,
j with lots of ail-Americans from all
| sections of the land battling for
i charity. Men from Cal, such as
i Larry Lutz, Don Fowler, and the
i Brittingham boys will be available
for this tilt, and likewise other out
j standing seniors from the other
I coast, Rocky Mountain, and Texas
team.
Then there is the National Cath
olic battle, to be played in Kezar
j Stadium either late this month or
| early next. Holy Cross is prac
! tically a certainty to represent the
East, and Santa Clara, St. Mary's.
| Gonzaga, Loyola, P.U., and U.S.F.
j are the eligible Coast teams.
Next Saturday will be a top
notch game in San Francisco when
the near-Rose Bowl Texas Chris
' tians meet Santa Clara. There will
be much passing and open field
work, for T.C.U.'s Sammy Baugh is
the nation's finest passer, while
' Clipper Smith's Broncos also boast
j a wide open attack.
