lIIS THIRD GREAT SEASON
NEARLY FINISHED

In less than a month—and by the time the next issue of The Daily
rolls off the presses—Claude E. Thornhill will have wrapped up his third
season as head coach at Stanford University and marked it "sealed."
And in those three years Tiny and his two assistants, Ernie Ncvcrs
and Jim Lawson, have worked more magic with Indian gridiron des
tinies than has been shown for a similar period in the history of Farm
football.
First it. was in 1933 that Tiny took over the reins from Pop Warner
to moke his first stab at the head job of Card football. It wasn't a bright

season that loomed ahead that fall of three years back.
Stanford had sophomores, good sophomores, but ac
cording to Pop's system they would be held over for
a year of "seasoning" on the grays.
Tiny decided to try it differently. In the first game
of that season against San Jose State, two untried var
sity ball players played their first games for Stanford
—Monk Moscrip and a swell frosh back, Bobby Gray
son.
And that started it. Every usable man on the
strong freshman team of 1932 was given his chance.
No waiting until a man was a junior. Play him as
soon as you can, was Tiny's motto. And that's what
he did.
Before long Bones Hamilton, Bob Reynolds, Claude
Callaway, Frankie Alustiza, and Earl Hoos were
added. And a little later they were joined by Wes

Muller, who played grays the year before and Keith Topping, a made
over basketball center.
During this time Woody Adams, Shelley Bronstein, Larry Rouble,
Alex Trompas and Johnny ReLsner wei'e all gaining much part-time
experience.
As the curtain dropped on the 1933 season it was Stanford's "sopho
more wonders"—the team that in one year rose from insignificance to
beat California and rcceivc the Rose Bowl bid.

THAT WAS JUST
THE START

But they weren't through—not by any means. The following season —
last year—they started the same thing over again. Some of the old
"gang" was gone, some new names were in their places, but it was
essentially the team that started green a year before.
A season marred only by one tie, Santa Clara early in the year, and
again Stanford was back in the Rose Bowl. From all sides came con
gratulations to Thornbill and the "sophomore wonders" for doing it
twice.
And today they are in that same spot again. Only now it's for receiv
ing that cherished bid THREE consecutive times that, we hand out our
words of praise. But that's not all.
In the three years that this outfit (and they are really all one. Tiny
and the team) have been lighting for the Red only four defeats mar
an otherwise perfect record. Two of those losses were on the last two
fateful New Year's Days, when Rose Bowl competition either proved
to be a case of "too many passes" or "too much rain."
The two other defeats came in the regular line of play. In 19.33, the
first year of the new regime, Washington swept to victory on a mud laden
field. And the U.C.L.A. one-point loss of this season was the fourth.
Two ties, the one with Santa Clara, and a scoreless game with North
western during their first season, are the only other blemishes on the
record. And that's a real record!
Yes, from purely the football-playing standpoint, Tiny, his assist
ants, and the team that he has worked with ever since his appointment as
head coach, have been overwhelmingly successful.

BUT THEY'VE DONE MORE
THAN WIN GAMES

There is something more than that, something that has made itself
more obvious than ever this season. That's Tiny's democratic system.
No moaning from alumni, no gripes from players; they all have put their
whole-hearted okay on Tiny's handling of Stanford football.
There's a feeling of friendship between the team, Thornbill, and stu
dent followers that cannot be denied. Practice sessions are not boring
drills, lor team members alone. They, under Tiny, have become some
thing more. Outsiders are invited, the squad jokes as it works, Tiny is
always there to bellow out a good natured wise-crack.
There is some sort of spirit, an undefinable thing, that has been built
up between the coaches and team during these past three years. Of it,
Stanford may well be proud.

ONE BIG JOB STILL
AIIEAt) THIS SEASON

During the next three weeks this whole outfit faces a tough assign
ment if ever there was one. The job of whipping back into game condi
tion, arousing themselves menially to a point where S.M.U.'s powerful
team will be forced to take a defeat, will not be easy.
Twice has Stanford slipped in the New Year's Day classic. This time
all the coast has put the Indian on the spot, demanded a victory. Tiny,
his system, his "sophomore wonders" will face a great team, undefeated,
untied, keyed for a victory over the "great Stanford."
Eight of Stanford's eleven (if Monk can start) will he making their
last stand for the Red. And that same eight—Grayson, Hamilton, Top
ping, Moscrip, Muller, Rouble, Reynolds, and Adams—will he getting
their last crack at the western classic of all football classics—the an
nual Rose Bowl game.
Stanford is confident that they will "make the grade," that they will
wind up brilliant gridiron careers with the fitting climax.
See you there on New Year's. —Frost.
