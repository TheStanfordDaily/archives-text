# Perkins Talks To Gulf Strike Board
## 
### 
HOUSTON, Tex., Dec. 2 (A 3 ).â€”
Miss Frances Perkins, Secretary of
Labor, conferred briefly here today
with the board she appointed to at
tempt a settlement of the Gulf-wide
strike of members of the Interna
tional Longshoremen's Association.
She said she believed the strike
could be settled notwithstanding the
setback in the negotiations result
ing from refusal of Houston steam
ship men to participate in confer
ences unless spokesmen for inde
pendent longshoremen's organiza
tions likewise were allowed to par
ticipate and the meetings were op
ticipate and the meetings were
opened to the public.
