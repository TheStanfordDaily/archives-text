## 
### 
Monk Moscrip was limping around 1
(he Quad to classes yesterday, but j
it is still a question whether or not
he will play in the Rose Bowl.
The battered flonkman, often men
tioned for ail-American honors, has
a long road to travel before his!
cracked knee cartilage, fractured I
jaw, and bruised hand recover from j
the beating they took in the Big !
Game.
Monk will probably be on hand I
December 15, though, when the In- |
dians resume daily practice, to see
if he can withstand the pressure of
competition.
