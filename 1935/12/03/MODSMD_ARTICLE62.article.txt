### 
ROME, Dec. 2 (A 3 ). —Italian busi
ness leaders said today trade was J
slackening and problems of labor
and business credit were develop
ing as result of League of Nations' |
sanctions.
They said imports and exports, '
which normally total about 1,000,- ;
000,000 lire (about $80,000,000)
monthly, were being cut severely.
They suggested that if this trade |
were only halved, the reduction j
would be equivalent to the wages
paid monthly to nearly 1,000,000 j
men.
Small firms manufacturing for ex- |
port or dependent upon foreign
material, said these leaders, may j
soon be confronted with a critical j
situation unless they can use their
facilities for oth'jr types of work.
Nine hundred of Italy's mothers
and widows of war dead, "mobil- !
ized" by Premier Mussolini, took II !
Duce's program of resistance to
sanctions to the nation's communi
ties today.
