# Explorer Dies Defying 'Curse'
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 2 OP). â€” Dr.
James H. Breasted, noted Egyptol
ogist, who exposed himself to the
so-called "curse"' upon violators of
a Pharaoh's tomb, died today of a
blood infection.
He was taken off the liner Conte
di Savoia last Thursday and speeded
to Presbyterian Hospital suffering,
a ship's doctor paid, from a recur
ring attack of malarial fever.
Hospital officials said the 70-year
old archaeologist succumbed to a
"hemolytic streptococcic infection."'
He had derided several times the
force of a curse found by him and
21 other scientific diggers in the
tomb of King Tutankhamen.
Inscribed on the walls of the
crypt were these words:
"Death shall come on swift wings
to him that toucheth the tomb of
the Pharaoh."
Of the 22 who first looked on the
inscription after the tomb's seal
was broken in 1922, seven have
died.
