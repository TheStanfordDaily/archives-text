# Medieval Dramas Read By Freshmen, Faculty
## 
### Dave Botsford 
God spoke in ihe Little Theater
last night.
But Mrs. Noah, not God, gave the
Americanized medieval mystery
plays which were read by Western
Civilization freshmen and instruc
tors the life and kick they needed
to leave a sparse audience more
than pleasantly satisfied.
Cantankerous Mrs. Noah of "Noah
and the Ark" threatened to kick
husband Noah "into the middle of
next week"; finally, after he avert
ed God's flood, pledged faith in him
with a sigh and '"What a man!"
In this nagging part, Mary Eliz
abeth Sachse showed the most dra
matic ability of the cast. In '"The
Sacrifice of Isaac" she showed a
peeper, more emotional side as
Abraham (yes, a "she" talks a "he"

i part).
"Second Shepherd's Play," most
famed of the plays, was read by in
structors. Reduced to one-fifth of
the original, Hugh Baker's trans
lation gave the funniest cracks to
Oscar Winther, shepherd "stooge."
Beverly McAnear's interpretation of
Mak, the rogue who attempted to
pass off a stolen sheep as his wife's
(Emery Fast's) deformed baby,
sounded much like Raymond Wal
burn of the movies.
Virgil K. Whilaker, English in
structor, made the translation of
"Noah and the Ark," the freest,
most modern. Cora Lee Beers
stuck closest to the medieval lang
uage with "The Sacrifice of Isaac."
The whole thing must have been
a lot of fun for the cast, but the
i academic value isn't too obvious.
