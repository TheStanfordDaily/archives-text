# Art Gallery To Show Paintings
## Display To Include Oils On Paper, and Pastels 
### 
Three at the Art Gallery
are promised by Pedro de Lemos,
director, for this month and Jan
uary. They will include examples
of oil paintings, pastels, and "alu
minum-painting."
The most interesting exhibit
will be of the works of Anton
Blazck, who has developed a new
method of painting on aluminum.
The paintings are extremely mod
ern, in keeping with their back
grounds, and have a scintillating,
metallic quality which is very
unusual.
Jane Rehnstrand, head of the art
department of Wisconsin State Col
lege, will be represented in the sec
ond exhibit by oil paintings exe
cuted on paper, instead of on can
vas. This method does away wilh
the long period of drying necessary
for ordinary oil paintings, which
keeps most artists from working
continuously on nils.
The third exhibit features the
work of Corrine Malvern of Los
Angeles, whose subject-matter is
largely made up of Southern Cal
ifornian and Oriental types. Her
pastels all have the qualities of
oils.
These exhibits are of interest to
the general public, Mr. de Lemos
stated, but are of even more in
terest to artists, since they show
three now methods of painting.
