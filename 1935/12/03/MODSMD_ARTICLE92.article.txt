For all lower division students
v,ho are now m iking out their pro
grams for next quarter, and who
are looking forward to a suitable
major field in the University, a 74-
page bulletin entitled, "Univer
sity Training and Vocational Out
lets," is recommended by the Voca
tional Guidance Committee.
The bulletin, which is available
for 15 cents at the Registrar's Of
fice, comprises a summary of the
vocational guidance lecture series
given in 1934-35 by representatives

of each school and department of j
the University.
Four pages are devoted to each
bcture, outlining current trends in
that particular field of study, the
scholastic training programs in ef
fect at Stanford, and the vocational :
outlets for graduates with such j
study.
Students will be assisted by this
bulletin to make an intelligent
choice of a major field of study
within the University, and of a vo
cational goal harmonious with such j

! training.
A cross-index of the various vo
j cations represented or mentioned
within the pages forms a feature
of the publication. Aside from the
lectures themselves, the questions
and answers given during the series
j are included, besides four selected
references on each particular sub
ject for further reading.
Dr. C. Gilbeit Wrenn, assistant
registrar and vocational counsellor,
edited the bulletin, which was pub
i lished last June.
