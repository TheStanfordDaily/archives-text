### 
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Dec. 2 (/P).—
Brains, beauty, personality and style
—that's all men students at the Uni
versity of Rochester ask of their
brides.
Of course, the little woman also
should know how to cook, sew, and
be well versed in all domestic arts
"until we m?ke enough to hire help."
She should be generous, a good
hostess, have a sense of humor and
the -desire to improve her mind, a
campus survey showed.
