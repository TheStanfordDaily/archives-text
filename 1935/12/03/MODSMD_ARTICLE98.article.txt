# Cave-in Imprisons Treasure Hunters
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2 (4').â€”Tons
of rock fell in a tunnel used by
treasure hunters 80 feet under
ground today, entombing one of six
men in the shaft at the time of
the cave-in.
After being imprisoned, tempo
rarily, by the slide, five of the gold
seekers dug their way out, then
turned their efforts to rescuing
Ed Olinger, 41, whose body was pin
icried under two large tunnel tim
bers that kept the falling rock from
crushing him.
