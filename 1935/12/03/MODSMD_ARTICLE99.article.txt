## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Pacific Coast Conference Has Chance To Justify Its Existence Next Week 
### 
Faculty athletic representatives and gradu
ate managers of ten Western schools which
arc figuratively bound together as the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Athletic-Conference will
meet in San Francisco next Monday and
Tuesday to discuss matters of policy and
schedule-making for the next year.
As it now is constituted, the Conference at
tempts to choose a football champion, deter
mines a basketball champion on an efficient
elimination basis, and ignores most of the
less commercialized sports. Other Confer
ence duties include the drafting of rules of
play and rules of eligibility, arranging of
schedules, and hiring of officials.
Hut that is about the extent of its worth.
Obviously, the remedy is either abandonment
of the Conference entirely or building it up
so it is something more than a figurative body
that only theoretically determines the title in
a couple of sports and completely ignores the
other fields of athletic endeavor, one that sets
up regulations which it has no means of en
forcing.
The Conference would do well to seriously
consider revamping itself. Specifically, the
Daii.v suggests:
1. That the officials bring up the possibility
of revamping the Conference track meet next
spring. Recent objections to this from sev
eral Northern universities on financial and
climatic grounds seemingly are not justifjea

tion enough to prohibit consideration.
2. That they look into the feasibility of '
bringing the minor sports earnival back into !
existence.
o. That they attempt to reorganize football, !
so that the games and the championship are |
more representative of the entire Conference, j
4. That they look over the Conference by- j
laws with an eye to junking the rulings that ;
either have become obsolete or that have '
proved too difficult of enforcement.
f>. That tbey hold a thorough house-clean- j
ing in which they bring all agreements and
regulations up to date.
(i. That they face the facts of 1935, as they J
are at present in the ten Conference schools.
Geographically, the Pacific Coast Confer
ence is the largest of any intercollegiate ath
letic leagues in the country, with the exception j
of the I.C. 1-A. and N.C.A.A. In many respects
this size makes it altogether too unwieldy; an
otlicial "Big Four" arrangement among the j
lour major California universities would be
much more practical for ordinary purposes.
The Conference does possess, however, ,
some advantages over an arrangement of this
sort it offers a unified control over a large |
area, and a more representative scope for the I
scheduling of games. Hut these advantages
will become overshadowed if the Conference ;
does not justify its existence by bringing itself
up to date and reviving some <>f the functions >
that originally made it a useful organization.

Faculty athletic representatives and gradu
ate managers of ten Western schools which
arc figuratively bound together as the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Athletic-Conference will
meet in San Francisco next Monday and
Tuesday to discuss matters of policy and
schedule-making for the next year.
As it now is constituted, the Conference at
tempts to choose a football champion, deter
mines a basketball champion on an efficient
elimination basis, and ignores most of the
less commercialized sports. Other Confer
ence duties include the drafting of rules of
play and rules of eligibility, arranging of
schedules, and hiring of officials.
Hut that is about the extent of its worth.
Obviously, the remedy is either abandonment
of the Conference entirely or building it up
so it is something more than a figurative body
that only theoretically determines the title in
a couple of sports and completely ignores the
other fields of athletic endeavor, one that sets
up regulations which it has no means of en
forcing.
The Conference would do well to seriously
consider revamping itself. Specifically, the
Daii.v suggests:
1. That the officials bring up the possibility
of revamping the Conference track meet next
spring. Recent objections to this from sev
eral Northern universities on financial and
climatic grounds seemingly are not justifjea

tion enough to prohibit consideration.
2. That they look into the feasibility of '
bringing the minor sports earnival back into !
existence.
o. That they attempt to reorganize football, !
so that the games and the championship are |
more representative of the entire Conference, j
4. That they look over the Conference by- j
laws with an eye to junking the rulings that ;
either have become obsolete or that have '
proved too difficult of enforcement.
f>. That tbey hold a thorough house-clean- j
ing in which they bring all agreements and
regulations up to date.
(i. That they face the facts of 1935, as they J
are at present in the ten Conference schools.
Geographically, the Pacific Coast Confer
ence is the largest of any intercollegiate ath
letic leagues in the country, with the exception j
of the I.C. 1-A. and N.C.A.A. In many respects
this size makes it altogether too unwieldy; an
otlicial "Big Four" arrangement among the j
lour major California universities would be
much more practical for ordinary purposes.
The Conference does possess, however, ,
some advantages over an arrangement of this
sort it offers a unified control over a large |
area, and a more representative scope for the I
scheduling of games. Hut these advantages
will become overshadowed if the Conference ;
does not justify its existence by bringing itself
