# Gridders Sail For Hawaii After 7-0 Win Over Mustangs
## Stanford Ends Season Rating Third Place In Country; Coast's First 
### 
With their Rose Bowl victory
stowed away, and a I'ating of third
in the country in football prowess
laid aside with it, Stanford's 1935
gridders climbed off the Red Tobog
gan, called a great season to a close,
and split up for the first time since
Tiny Thornhill ran their first drill
last September.
Ten of them stepped on hoard I
the S.S. I.inline last Friday noon I
to swing out over the Pacific to
Hawaii, where they will make up
part of Pop Warner's aggregation
of picked U.S. football stars to see
action against two island teams, (
the University of Hawaii, and the
Honolulu All-Stars. Grayson,
'I odd, Reisncr, AdaJms, Rouble,
Topping, Reynolds, Larsen, Carl
son, and Black make up the group.
Most of Stanford's traveling sen
iors have registered for winter
quarter with arrangements made
allowing them to make up work
when they return to Stanford late
this month.
But still ringing in the ears of
all, both on the high seas and
hack on the Farm, were the vic
tory cheers of a joyous Pacific
Coast following who had seen
Stanford rope and tic, for the first
time, Southern Methodist's raging
Mustangs in the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.
For (he third consecutive time
Stanford represented the West in
that classic and this time Stanford
proved the adage "three's a charm"
and did not fail.
Records of great achievement can
be written after the names of every
man who upheld the Red in that
game but some stand out. Keith
Topping's splendid play at end,
rushing and foiling the Mustang's
passers. Bill Paulman's sparkling
kicks and interceptions. Jimmy
Coffis' fine work at safety and pass
catching. Monk Moscrip's charac
teristically great play. Wess Mul
ler's wonderful play at the center
of the line.
Stanford started early in the
first quarter of that great game
before the greatest of Rose Bowl
crowds. Stanford found herself
slipping into the much-dreaded
hole. Then came the play that
was most probably the turning
point of the game.
Bill Paulman got off his now
famous 62-yard quick kick which
Moscrip and Topping coaxed down
to the 10-yard line before killing
the roll. The Texans were forced to
kick and Jim Coffis returned the
punt 19 yards to the 41.
On the very next play little Jim
my made a sensational running
catch of Hamilton's pass to take the
ball to the S.M.U. 19. Grayson went
around end for 6, Hamilton made 12,
and then Bill Paulman on a quar
terback sneak took it over. Mos
c: ip's conversion was perfect.
From that time on, Stanford
fought to hold that lead. Little
Bobby Wilson proved (o be every
thing lie was cracked up to be and
had Stanforditcs breathing hard
more than once.
But the Mustangs' only real scor
ing threat came in the second quar
ter when three passes carried them
from their own 26 to the Stanford
5-yard line. But on the first play
Finley fumbled on an attempted re
verse, Topping recovered, and the
air attack went for naught.
However, in that drive was the
most spectacular play of the af
fair. Wilson passed to Shuford,
who lateraled to Tipton, who lat
cralcd to Finley, who, after howl
ing over three tacklcrs, was fi
nally dropped on the 5.
But aside from that one time
S.M.U. stayed well away from the
Cardinal goal. The pass defense of
Grayson, Coffis and Hamilton, plus
ihe rushing of Topping and Moscrip,
stopped the farm famed aerial cir
cus.
All in all, it appeai-ed to be a casg
of a harder charging line, a strong
pass defense, better kicking in the
pinches, better tackling, pius a de
termination not to lose that car
ried Stanford over the team that
had won 13 straight games.

had Stanforditcs breathing hard
more than once.
But the Mustangs' only real scor
ing threat came in the second quar
ter when three passes carried them
from their own 26 to the Stanford
5-yard line. But on the first play
Finley fumbled on an attempted re
verse, Topping recovered, and the
air attack went for naught.
However, in that drive was the
most spectacular play of the af
fair. Wilson passed to Shuford,
who lateraled to Tipton, who lat
cralcd to Finley, who, after howl
ing over three tacklcrs, was fi
nally dropped on the 5.
But aside from that one time
S.M.U. stayed well away from the
Cardinal goal. The pass defense of
Grayson, Coffis and Hamilton, plus
ihe rushing of Topping and Moscrip,
stopped the farm famed aerial cir
cus.
All in all, it appeai-ed to be a casg
of a harder charging line, a strong
pass defense, better kicking in the
pinches, better tackling, pius a de
termination not to lose that car
ried Stanford over the team that
had won 13 straight games.
With their Rose Bowl victory
stowed away, and a I'ating of third
in the country in football prowess
laid aside with it, Stanford's 1935
gridders climbed off the Red Tobog
gan, called a great season to a close,
and split up for the first time since
Tiny Thornhill ran their first drill
last September.
Ten of them stepped on hoard I
the S.S. I.inline last Friday noon I
to swing out over the Pacific to
Hawaii, where they will make up
part of Pop Warner's aggregation
of picked U.S. football stars to see
action against two island teams, (
the University of Hawaii, and the
Honolulu All-Stars. Grayson,
'I odd, Reisncr, AdaJms, Rouble,
Topping, Reynolds, Larsen, Carl
son, and Black make up the group.
Most of Stanford's traveling sen
iors have registered for winter
quarter with arrangements made
allowing them to make up work
when they return to Stanford late
this month.
But still ringing in the ears of
all, both on the high seas and
hack on the Farm, were the vic
tory cheers of a joyous Pacific
Coast following who had seen
Stanford rope and tic, for the first
time, Southern Methodist's raging
Mustangs in the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.
For (he third consecutive time
Stanford represented the West in
that classic and this time Stanford
proved the adage "three's a charm"
and did not fail.
Records of great achievement can
be written after the names of every
man who upheld the Red in that
game but some stand out. Keith
Topping's splendid play at end,
rushing and foiling the Mustang's
passers. Bill Paulman's sparkling
kicks and interceptions. Jimmy
Coffis' fine work at safety and pass
catching. Monk Moscrip's charac
teristically great play. Wess Mul
ler's wonderful play at the center
of the line.
Stanford started early in the
first quarter of that great game
before the greatest of Rose Bowl
crowds. Stanford found herself
slipping into the much-dreaded
hole. Then came the play that
was most probably the turning
point of the game.
Bill Paulman got off his now
famous 62-yard quick kick which
Moscrip and Topping coaxed down
to the 10-yard line before killing
the roll. The Texans were forced to
kick and Jim Coffis returned the
punt 19 yards to the 41.
On the very next play little Jim
my made a sensational running
catch of Hamilton's pass to take the
ball to the S.M.U. 19. Grayson went
around end for 6, Hamilton made 12,
and then Bill Paulman on a quar
terback sneak took it over. Mos
c: ip's conversion was perfect.
From that time on, Stanford
fought to hold that lead. Little

teristically great play. Wess Mul
ler's wonderful play at the center
of the line.
Stanford started early in the
first quarter of that great game
before the greatest of Rose Bowl
crowds. Stanford found herself
slipping into the much-dreaded
hole. Then came the play that
was most probably the turning
point of the game.
Bill Paulman got off his now
famous 62-yard quick kick which
Moscrip and Topping coaxed down
to the 10-yard line before killing
the roll. The Texans were forced to
kick and Jim Coffis returned the
punt 19 yards to the 41.
On the very next play little Jim
my made a sensational running
catch of Hamilton's pass to take the
ball to the S.M.U. 19. Grayson went
around end for 6, Hamilton made 12,
and then Bill Paulman on a quar
terback sneak took it over. Mos
c: ip's conversion was perfect.
From that time on, Stanford
fought to hold that lead. Little
Bobby Wilson proved (o be every
thing lie was cracked up to be and
had Stanforditcs breathing hard
more than once.
But the Mustangs' only real scor
ing threat came in the second quar
ter when three passes carried them
from their own 26 to the Stanford
5-yard line. But on the first play
Finley fumbled on an attempted re
verse, Topping recovered, and the
air attack went for naught.
However, in that drive was the
most spectacular play of the af
fair. Wilson passed to Shuford,
who lateraled to Tipton, who lat
cralcd to Finley, who, after howl
ing over three tacklcrs, was fi
nally dropped on the 5.
But aside from that one time
S.M.U. stayed well away from the
Cardinal goal. The pass defense of
Grayson, Coffis and Hamilton, plus
ihe rushing of Topping and Moscrip,
stopped the farm famed aerial cir
cus.
All in all, it appeai-ed to be a casg
of a harder charging line, a strong
pass defense, better kicking in the
pinches, better tackling, pius a de
termination not to lose that car
ried Stanford over the team that
had won 13 straight games.
