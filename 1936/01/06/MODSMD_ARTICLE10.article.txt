# World Spins On As Campus Sleeps Through Long Vacation
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
While Stanford students partied, |
slept the clock around, and were I
j careful to read only the comic pages :
of newspapers, the world continued !
to unreel a tangle of news, like a
ball of knitting cotton on a spindle, j
During (be three sabbatical
weeks of late breakfasts Europe
was thrown into a frenzy, Ethiopia
received its first full taste of Ital
ian hot-stufT, a play-boy fooled
j G-men, a movie-star died, and
! the United States received an in- i
! suit from its most famous son.
First off is the famous Hoaro- 1
Laval debacle, which nets Great
Britain just what she wanted, puts
I Sir Samuel into a dubious physical
! decline, and neatly drops Premier i
Laval into the diplomatic scrap-pile.
As the distance from the original
; "breach of faith" increases, it be
comes increasingly evident to ob
servers that the "error" of England's
1 foreign minister in haggling for
i Italo - Ethiopian peace outside the
League clearing house was in reality
: a superbly clever trick, a trick which
netted an incalculable profit for
1 England. France became the crushed

fulcrum of Britain's lever, which co- 1
alesced Mediterranean forces against
Italy and set the League for a head
to-hcad fight with II Duce.
Meanwhile, Italian bombers
whose deadly holiday wishes for
Haile Selassie missed the Negus
did not miss newspaper corre
spondents in Dessye, Ethiopia.
Originally intending to kill the
emperor in an air-raid over that
city, Italian bombs are reported
to have wrecked a Seventh Day
Adventist hospital and injured a
newspaperman. Although mere
racks of bones after their fight
with various Ethiopian diseases,
newsmen are still elephantine in
loyalty—and memory.
In the U.S.A. crime of the comic
opera and tragic variety took the
front pages and held them. First off
was the "kidnapping" of Caleb
Milne IV, scion of a wealthy social
ite New York and Philadelphia fam
ily. After he had harassed his rela
tives with kidnap notes, ransom de
mands, tortured their minds with the
ingenuity of a de Medici, he was
found four days later, gagged and
bound. Days afterward, when final

"clean-ups" had gone over the wires,
he confessed that his terrible experi
ence, replete with tortures, was all
a fake, that he had tied himself up,
that he had done it as a publicity
stunt to get a job as a writer or
actor.
Thelma Todd, why slu* killed
herself, or who killed her, is still
top front at this writing, and still
a Los Angeles grand jury can't
piece together the stories of
friends and acquaintances, stars,
extras, cafe managers, as to just
why she was found dead in a ga
rage.
Hardest and most resounding slap
in the face to these United States
came from Charles A. Lindbergh,
who took refuge in England and
hope in Scotland Yard as the exe
cution of Bruno Hauptmann became
imminent, and still more imminent,
possible clemency from the Gover
nor of New Jersey. The inescapable
inference, one that is popularly re
garded as a fact, is that Lindy and
his family felt safer in a country of
quick justice, than in one where jus
tice has not only stopped, but has
shifted into reverse.

In the U.S.A. crime of the comic

was the "kidnapping" of Caleb

ite New York and Philadelphia fam

tives with kidnap notes, ransom de
mands, tortured their minds with the
ingenuity of a de Medici, he was
found four days later, gagged and
bound. Days afterward, when final

"clean-ups" had gone over the wires,
he confessed that his terrible experi
ence, replete with tortures, was all
a fake, that he had tied himself up,
that he had done it as a publicity
