# Nearly 1000 To Register Late
## Only 2864 Report Friday Because of Game 
### 
Because of the Rose Bowl game
and the first Friday registration in
several years approximately 800
students have postponed their day
of reckoning until today. Only
2864 registered last Friday and Sat
urday—2o62 men and 802 women,
as compared with a total of 3191
! after the first day of registration a
year ag0 —2286 men and 905 women,
i Dr. J. P. Mitchell, registrar, ex
pects some 800 or 1000 more students
to register in the next two or three
days, probably to exceed the total
i for winter quarter a year ago and
I approach the 3894 who registered
| last quarter. It is a general rule
| that the winter term is never as
high as the fall term preceding, but
the new high set last fall implies
' that this term should be a new high
S for winter quarters, according to
Dr. Mitchell.
The privilege of l'egistering late
j will cost $2 today, as it did last
j Saturday. Tomorrow it will be $3
j and Wednesday $4.
