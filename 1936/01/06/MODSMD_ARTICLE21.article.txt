"How're yuh goir.' to keep him
down on the Farm?"
"Keep who?"
Why Monk Moscrip, of course.
Remember when he was on the
football team? They used to call
him the guy with the "educated
toe." Now (hold your_ hats, girls)
Monk's one jump from becoming a
movie idol.
He was dragged from the Rose
Bowl into a movie studio, and the
test made there of the famous Mos
crip profile and the Moscrip voice,
"looks good," movie executives
told the Associated Press yester
day.
Reports are that Monk needed the
support of Ernie Nevers to quiet a
case of Klcig jitters, and get him
to look the camera in the eye, and
say "Tiny Thornhill is a swell
coach."
Though movie executives reserved
definite contract offers, apparently
until Monk gets his diploma, if and
when he's signed he'll follow in the
steps of Johnny Mack Brown, who
entered the movies following the
game wilh Alabama in 1928.
