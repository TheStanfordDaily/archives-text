### 
Switching rooms at the first of
j the quarter, a regular occurrence
up the Itovv, may involve more
than a mere moving of furniture
and personal belongings, accord
ing to a report from one of the
sorority houses.
Two husky hashers were called
in recently by these co-eds to
move one of the beds to its new
location. The hashers huffed and
puffed, finally raised ihe bed from
the floor, and started to carry it
down the hall.
The bed was not yet made and
one of the gentlemen made a re
mark concerning the rumpled
condition of the covers and the
lateness of the hour. Just then a
curly head emerged from between
the sheets, and a surprised voice
wanted to know: "Did somebody
say something?"
Duke University women are now

approved places.
