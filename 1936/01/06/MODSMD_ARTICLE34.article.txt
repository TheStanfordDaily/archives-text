NO ALIBIS
TIIIS TIME •
It was great to watch 'em crush
the Mustangs on New Year's Day—
ii was wonderful to boast of vie- j
tory that night—but the big thrill,
for a lowly Stanford sportwriter,
comes this morning when for the
first time in three years this column
can blaze forth into the New Year
sans alibis.
No, they can't point Farmward
and query "what was wrong in !
the Hose Bowl?" any more. P'or
Stanford's lads really went to
town last Wednesday and the
football world concedes that fact.
It's the Indians' turn to crow.
The shouting has almost died
away by this time and more words
of praise for those who made three
the charm are a trifle passe so we'll
let the job of dealing out compli- j
ments go for now.
This much is certain —if justice
were done to those men who gave
up their holidays, stuck around the 1
Farm working out twice a day, and
finally whipped S.M.U. in the Rose
Bowl it would take more inches of
copy than this column could ever j
devote.
On only one point has Stanford
been criticized. Some sports com- '
mentators have accused the In
dians of playing colorless football.
They wanted to see more passes,
more open play. And perhaps
they are right in their belief that
the game lacked some of the rapid
fire action that was expected.
But Stanford isn't the one to
look to on that score. For, if you 1
remember, the Indians opened up
full blast in that quarter and passes
were the vogue. In fact, it was a
pass that was largely responsible
for Stanford's score.
NOTHING DULL
ABOUT CARDS' START
There wasn't anything dull about
the Cards' offense in those first few
minutes of that game. And natur
ally, after taking the lead, Stan
ford tightened up, played conserva
tive ball.
Stanford went into Pasadena's
Arroyo Seco last week to win a
Rose Bowl game. Stanford opened
with a crushing thrust—just as
in the California game—and that
did the trick. That happened to
be the way the Indians won their
tough ball games this season and
it has proven, as the records show,
a reliable system.
Let 'em scream—those fellows
who wanted more spectacular play
—but they've got to admit thai
Stanford won and that's what Stan
ford set out to do. —Frost
play did Stanford win Saturday's
tilt with Nebraska. Two field goals
by Moore and a field goal and a free
throw by Luisetti overcame the
Cornhuskers' lead and gave Stan
ford a 42 to 39 victory.

Stanford went into Pasadena's

it has proven, as the records show,
a reliable system.

It was great to watch 'em crush
the Mustangs on New Year's Day—

tory that night—but the big thrill,
for a lowly Stanford sportwriter,
comes this morning when for the
first time in three years this column

Stanford's lads really went to

The shouting has almost died
away by this time and more words

This much is certain —if justice
were done to those men who gave
up their holidays, stuck around the 1

On only one point has Stanford
been criticized. Some sports com- '
mentators have accused the In
dians of playing colorless football.
They wanted to see more passes,
more open play. And perhaps
they are right in their belief that
the game lacked some of the rapid
fire action that was expected.
But Stanford isn't the one to
look to on that score. For, if you 1
remember, the Indians opened up
full blast in that quarter and passes
were the vogue. In fact, it was a
pass that was largely responsible
for Stanford's score.
NOTHING DULL
ABOUT CARDS' START
There wasn't anything dull about
the Cards' offense in those first few
minutes of that game. And natur
ally, after taking the lead, Stan
