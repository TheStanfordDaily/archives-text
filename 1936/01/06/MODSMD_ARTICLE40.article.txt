# Conference Schedule Indignation Quieted

Since the first sudden flare-up by
the smaller schools, reaction to the
Pacific Coast Conference's "freeze
cut" has been almost negligible. A
threatened political fight by sup
porters of the teams frozen out has
failed to materialize as yet.
Losing the U.S.F. game from her
football schedule, Stanford will
meet Oregon and Washington State,
two conference foes, in place of the
Dons. In accordance with the move
made at the Conference meeting on
December 9, seven of the circuit's
ten teams, including the Indians,
will each play seven opponents in
round-robin fashion.
Idaho and Montana, the two most
remote teams, have been partially
frozen out, like the "independents,"

and will play only four and five
conference games, respectively.
Washington State undertakes the
toughest schedule, playing all the
nine other schools in the circuit.
Bay Region football loses the
California-Santa Clara tussle, as
well as the Stanford-U.S.F. game.
The Indian-Bronc tilt and the Bear-
Gael encounter remain as important
games of this type in Northern
California.
As a result of the "freeze-out,"
Stanford will make two northern
trips next fall, for the first time in
many years. The Cards will clash
with Washington State in Pullman
October 3, and meet Oregon State
at Corvallis November 14.
The conference action was revo
lutionary, intended to make the big
Pacific Coast loop a compact or
ganization with a real champion.
The move, which closely parallels
a policy advocated by The Daily, I

the football freeze-out, the confer
