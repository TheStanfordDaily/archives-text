### 
In the all-league water polo se
lections made by a vote of the i
coaches of California, U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Stanford teams, Bill
Woodard at guard and Bob Has
lacher at goalie were the only two >
Indians honored with first-string
berths. Wally Wiget at sprint and
Bill Clemo in one of the forward
positions were also honored Cards !
as they drew down second-string
spots in the vote.
U.C.L.A. gained top honors, plac
ing three of her men in the top po- '
sitions, while California furnished ]
the players for the other two places '
and U.S.C. failed to have a man se- |
lected.
Woodard gained the honor for
the second successive year, while |
Ilaslacher was mentioned for the j
second team in the selections last
year. Melvin Sellers of U.C.L.A.
was picked for the sprint position
for the third successive year.
According to Nort Thornton, In
! dian coach, Stanford is not at pres- I
ent planning to send a team East to [
try for the Olympic Games but the j
outstanding Stanford players will
probably have a chance to make the
i trip as the Olympic Club of San
1 Francisco is scouting around for the
| best possible combination and is in
viting both California and Stanford
poloists to try for their team.
