With the long-sought Rose Howl victory
under their belts, Stanford's mighty football
ers of the class of '30 closed their record book
of collegiate football and sailed to Hawaii on
a well-earned trip.
Behind them they left a mass of arguing
partisan sportswriters, each striving to prove
that the Rose Bowl did or not decide the
championship of the country.
To Stanford it does not matter. II is suffi
cient to know that for three years the athletic
ability of these men has kept the Universiy
in the limelight. Some may decry the fact
that the repute of universities has to rest
partly 011 the prowess of its athletes rather
than exclusively 011 its scholars.
Hut in the competitive, emotional America
of today college athletics do make a college
known. It is, then, with justifiable pride that
Stanford can point to the record of its foot
ballers, and of such as lien Eastman and Law
son Little, and with truth say that they have
kept the name "Stanford" high in the public
estimation.
Not only in reputation has Stanford gained
by the attendance here of these gridiron
greats, but also in actual dollars and cents.
Nor is this a matter to be hidden or hypocriti
cally ignored. Because it has been Stanford's
lot to have a team that bows to none, its in
come from football has stayed at a high level.

Such income has been put to good use in
building parts of the University. The Wom
en's Gym, the Pavilion, Branner Hall, all rest
011 the sweat of football men.
Further, the record left behind by the out
going gridinen has been a credit to Stanford
in another way. There has never been a time
when all who knew them have not proclaimed
them good sports and gentlemen—playing the
game for what it was worth, and playing it
cleanly.
Their final bid for fame was a fitting finis
to their Stanford football career in this re
spect. Although so-called experts pronounced
the victory over Southern Methodist as color
less, there was 110 need for it to be otherwise.
Once "Vowing Sophs" and "Laughing
Boys," the outgoing men became "Serious
Seniors." They knew they had a job to do —
win a victory to erase the Columbia and Ala
bama disappointments. And they did the job
—maybe not colorfully, but coolly and thor
oughly and cleanly.
In the years to come, when Stanford grid
iron supremacy may be temporarily obscured,
the gameness and sportsmanship of her ath
letes can still bring recognition to the Univer
sity. To the outgoing men whose ability and
sportsmanship have rellccted credit upon the
University, Stanford can do 110 less than oiler
her heartfelt thanks.
