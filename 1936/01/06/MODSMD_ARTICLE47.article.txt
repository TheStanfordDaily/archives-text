# A 						Loss to Be Felt As Stanford Grows
## 
### 
Both because of the vital part lie had played
in the founding and growth of the University
and because of the example he had set for
members of 44 graduating classes, the death
last week of Timothy Hopkins, one of the
original trustees, is a loss that will be felt
more and more with the continued growth of
Stanford as a university.
Mr. Hopkins spent more than half of his
lifetime in the interest and service of Stan
lord. His gifts established the transportation
library and Hopkins reading room in the main
library and the Hopkins Marine Station, and
he was instrumental in creating the Stanford
Convalescent Home; the Founding Grant
named Mr. Hopkins a trustee in ISBS and from
that time until his death he had been in close
contact with the development of the Uni
versity.
His whole life has been a story of accom
plishment and success. At 24 he was ap
pointed treasurer of the Southern Pacific, and
he has been an administrative officer of many
corporations since.
A close associate of Senator and Mrs. Stan
lord, Mr. Hopkins will remain immortal in the
University's memory. Hut more than that, his
life has served and will continue to serve as
an incentive to Stanford students, whose ears
ring, as they approach graduation, with tales
of hardship and "tough breaks" that confront
the youth who is preparing for a career. The
memory ol Timothy Hopkins, philanthropist
and financier, always will have a meaning to
the true Stanford man.
