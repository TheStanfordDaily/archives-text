# Breaking All Custom For a Better Paper
## 
### 
Once again in the same volume the Sian
fohd Daily breaks with tradition and prece
dent and for the second time revamps its
makeup and appearance. As was the case in
the lirsl change, the latest one seems certain

to bring down the condemnation of the staid
and of those hopelessly stuck in the rut of
custom.
At the first of last quarter when (he present
volume of the Daily started, the entire type
dress was changed, from the top of page one
to the bottom of page four. Then with today's
paper, what is known as llush-left heads have
replaced the former slanting heads which are
common newspaper style.
Undoubtedly some of the typographical in
novations are not to he found on other news
papers. The changes arc perhaps contrary to
established custom in the Fourth Estate. That
is granted, but what difference does it make?
Style after all is merely a matter of opinion.
The Daily merely experiments in an at
tempt to put out the best possible paper, in
novating whenever necessary, whenever it is
felt that such innovation will help to achieve
this end, regardless of established custom or
precedent.
