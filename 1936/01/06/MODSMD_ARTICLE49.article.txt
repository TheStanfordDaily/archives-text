# Our Hasher Sez:

Just in case somebody thought this was a Happy
New Year, may I point out that rushing begins this
week?
Rushing is carried on under the principle that
nature abhors a vacuum. First they have to fill the
sorority house. Then they have to fill the girls. The
trouble with a hashing job, in short, is that it is too
filling.
This is Monday, January 6. School starts today.
That is, school starts today. The students start to
morrow.
Five thousand new red pencils for the faculty and
five new flavors for blue books: peppermint, winter
grecn, vanilla, coumarin, asafoctida, will be provided
by the million dollars or so the university collects
in late registration fees. iTour bucks will be slapped
on the 3,950 students who didn't come back Friday.
The 50 who did were members of The Daily staff,
who assembled yesterday afternoon, to write this
morning's paper about the 3,950 who didn't get
back. Unofficial prognosticaiors figured out the toll
will be at least two bucks lor late registration, plus
the added two dollars for signing up late in P.E.
courses.
It is said that if we don't get invited to the Rose
Bowl next year, we'll start one of our own, just to
collect on the dough. It is also rumored that the
B.A.C. did not lose money on the Bowl.
Except in the case of bew'niskered grandfather from
Covina who persuaded a B.A.C. ticket-taker to let
children in arms free into the rooting section. The
ticket-taker later explained that the man's bald head
dazzled him.
The Stanford drum major at the Bowl indignantly
claimed that the S.M.U. band stole a march on him.
Stanford scouts were reported seen trying to sign
up Ted Lewis after the game. We're not going to
let an outside band win another moral victory in the
Rose Bowl. As an added attraction the B.A.C. will
oiler a complete, new floor show.
