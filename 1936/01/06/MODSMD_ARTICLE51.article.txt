SEATTLE, Jan. s.—Seven to nothing . . . ringing
out of 100,000 loudspeakers up here in the Northwest
. . . sent Stanford-respect stock up and up . . . but in
the aftermath your correspondent went interviewing
. . . went inquiring into that venerable question . . .
"What do other universities think of us down on
the Farm."
* * *
Naturally, after the Pasadena spectacle, general
opinion runs to "Ah, Stanford, bringers of glory to
the West," but pulling the drapes on grid glory for
the moment, unsullied opinion was found. Repre
sentatives of populous University of Washington,
mill-race encircled University of Oregon, God-for
saken Washington State College, and ambitious little
Oregon State College were found and queried. They
were honest folk, everyone, ,\nd outspoken.
* * * *
From pretty, blonde Frances Walsh, a Theta at
Washington State, we heard: "Pullman students con
sider Stanford as a university to be high-hattish.
We think people go there for an education, and be
cause they work so hard, they get delusions of
grandeur. But it's a funny thing—a fellow trans
ferred from Stanford to Washington State last year
and somebody in our house tried to get him a date.
The offer was ignored like a history lecture until it
was mentioned that he was from Stanford. Then
about 10 girls jumped up and battled to go out with
him."
* * * *
"The average Stanford man has a Phi Betish look
about him." That, says Joe Krivanek, student jour
nalist, is the opinion of Univeisity of Washington stu
dents. We recognize that Stanford is essentially an
'intellectual' school, and because of that we picture
the students as conservative, serious Oxfordian types."
Because Joe has a nice delusion, this Stanford man
didn't undertake to disillusion him.
« * # *
These statements are honest and typfcal opinions.
They're fantastic, some of them, but most significant,
many of them are out-dated. The North hasn't yet
heard about the deflated scholastic average, the low
ered entrance requirements, and the forced accept
ance of more and more women. When they talk foot
ball up here, Stanford is tops. When they talk plain
college it's a different story.

SEATTLE, Jan. s.—Seven to nothing . . . ringing
out of 100,000 loudspeakers up here in the Northwest
. . . sent Stanford-respect stock up and up . . . but in
the aftermath your correspondent went interviewing
. . . went inquiring into that venerable question . . .
"What do other universities think of us down on
the Farm."
* * *
Naturally, after the Pasadena spectacle, general
opinion runs to "Ah, Stanford, bringers of glory to
the West," but pulling the drapes on grid glory for
the moment, unsullied opinion was found. Repre
sentatives of populous University of Washington,
mill-race encircled University of Oregon, God-for
saken Washington State College, and ambitious little
Oregon State College were found and queried. They
were honest folk, everyone, ,\nd outspoken.
* * * *
From pretty, blonde Frances Walsh, a Theta at
Washington State, we heard: "Pullman students con
sider Stanford as a university to be high-hattish.
We think people go there for an education, and be
cause they work so hard, they get delusions of
grandeur. But it's a funny thing—a fellow trans
ferred from Stanford to Washington State last year
and somebody in our house tried to get him a date.
The offer was ignored like a history lecture until it
was mentioned that he was from Stanford. Then
about 10 girls jumped up and battled to go out with
him."
* * * *
"The average Stanford man has a Phi Betish look
about him." That, says Joe Krivanek, student jour
nalist, is the opinion of Univeisity of Washington stu
dents. We recognize that Stanford is essentially an
'intellectual' school, and because of that we picture
the students as conservative, serious Oxfordian types."
Because Joe has a nice delusion, this Stanford man
didn't undertake to disillusion him.
« * # *
These statements are honest and typfcal opinions.
They're fantastic, some of them, but most significant,
many of them are out-dated. The North hasn't yet
heard about the deflated scholastic average, the low
ered entrance requirements, and the forced accept
ance of more and more women. When they talk foot
ball up here, Stanford is tops. When they talk plain
college it's a different story.
