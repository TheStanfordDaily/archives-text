"AH WILDERNESS"
At the Stanford
A For once the cinema has
outdone itself with a fine
adaptation. Eugene O'Neill's
comedy success, "Ah Wil
derness," in its screen form is an
example of Hollywood scenario
writing and direction as it should
be. Director Clarence Brown
squeezes every ounce of humor
from his production and serves a
savory dish to theater-goers. Sea
soned with a first-rate MGM cast,
O'Neill's tale of adolescent love at
the turn of the cerjtury has few
weak moments if any.
Eric Linden, although his name is
buried in the billing, is the star and
hands in a finished performance as
the seventeen-year-old lover and
radical. Cecilia Parker plays op
posite him with restraint and polish.

Wallace Beery, nominally the star,
has a bit part as an amiable drunk
ard in love with Aline MacMahon,
while Lionel Barrymore as the
small-town newspaper publisher is
outstanding.
The story tells of Linden, who
disappointed in love, gets tight in
loose company and quotes Swin
burne. His condition pains his
mother and embarrasses his father;
but it provides ample amusement
for the audience. So, too, does pai*-
ental disapproval of the books he
reads which include Shaw, Wilde,
Omar, and Marx.
For those who want to go back to
1906 for 72 minutes, *'Ah Wilder
ness" will provide a delightful ve
hicle.
