NEW YEAR'S EVE ITEM: That
fellow, Jack Hylton, ertswhile Brit- ;
ish band loader, singing "The Mu- i
sic Goes Round and Round" with
George Olsen's orchestra at Chi
cago's College Inn.
AS PREDICTED in this column ,
early last fall, NBC has revived its '
second Pacific Coast network. What
used to be called the Orange is now
called the Pacific Coast Red, and
what used to be the Gold is now the
Pacific Coast Blue. Personally, we
preferred the old names.
The Coast Blue is made up of
KECA, KGO, KEX, KJR, and KGA. |
Its revival has been a foregone con
clusion ever since it was abandoned.
Proximate cause was Woodbury's
request for a Sunday evening spot
when the Orange net had hung out
radio's S.R.O.—A.T.G., meaning all
time gone. 'j
Incidentally, NBC had better get !
after the telephone company. The
tone on the northwest leg of the j
new net is terribly distorted.
TIT FOR TAT: Woodbury, dis- |
satisfied with Ring Crosby, fired
him. Kraft, dissatisfied with Paul
Whitcman, fired hjm and h|necj
Crosby. So Woodbury hired White- 1
man. First broadcast last night at
8:30 over the new Coast Blue net
work.
