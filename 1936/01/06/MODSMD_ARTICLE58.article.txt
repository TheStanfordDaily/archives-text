# ALABAMA WISHES WELL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last year when I came to Cali
fornia to see the Alabama-Stanford
game I met many Stanford students
at the Cocoanut Grove . . I never
before met a finer group of people,
but I have no idea who they were.
I was feeling so good that night
. . . I do remember one girl
who asked me for my autograph.
I still do not know why. I gave her
a noise maker with my name
signed on the handle.
My purpose in writing you is to
see if you could get me the names
of these students . . .
My main reason for writing to
you is this: I hope Stanford beats
the day-lights out of Southern
Methodist University . . .

P.S.: Tell Coach Tiny Thornhill
that we are rooting for Stanford to
come through . . .
Thanks. Sorry you weren't there.
Ed. note.
