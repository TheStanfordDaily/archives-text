# Overweight? Maybe It's Your Iliac

"Fatty, fatty!" If you are among
the unfortunate ones falling in that
category, take heart. Refer your
tormentors to Dr. Helen B. Pryor's
'width weight" tables and stop
v/orrying about your weight. You
may be perfect according to your
bi-iliiac measurement.
If so, go ahead and order your
cream-puffs, because nothing can
he done — it's the measurement
an oss the crest of the hip hones
and hence, unchangeable.
According to Dr. Pryor's survey
this measurement is one of the four
principal factors in weight, the other
three being sex, age, and height.
Dr. Pryor, assistant director of
physical education for Sianford
women, believed that the matter of
weight was overstandardized and to
rectify this she evolved the theory of
bone measurement as an important
and determining factor in weight.
"Many children," Dr. Pryor
stated, "are erroneously termed
"overweight" or "underweight"
by doctors and school examiners,
with the resultant stuffing or un
derfeeding by over-anxious par
ents developing into a definite be
hnvior problem."

| Altogether Dr. Pryor measured
10,000 children, young people, and
adults over a period of five years.
At first 63 body measurements
were taken, until Dr. Pryor deter
mined that the bi—iliac at the hip
! bones most nearly correlated Ihe
correct weight.
The Pryor system has been
used entirely at Stanford for
over a year in physical examina
tions. I)r. Charles E. Shepard of
the Men's Physical Education De
partment has undertaken the
measurement of Stanford men,
and two years ago Dr. .!. C. (Jeiger,
director of public health in San
Francisco, conducted a survey of
4500 families on relief and discov
ered that there were surprisingly
few cases of actual malnutrition.
Dr. Pryor's theory has aroused in
ternational interest and has been
adopted by such institutions as
i Liverpool University, Harvard, and
Yale. Orphanages and tubercu
losis associations throughout the
United States have taken it up, and
the public health services of
Charleston, South Carolina, Winnet
ka, Illinois, Little Hock. Arkansas,
Salt I ..akc City, and Detroit, use it
| (. xclusively.
