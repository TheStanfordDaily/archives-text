# Vienna Boys Choir Athletic When They're Not in Concert
## 
### 
The Vienna Choir Boys, who come to Stanford tomorrow evening
as the second attraction of the Concert Series, are a rohust group of
youths.
They are devoted to basketball, swimming, and soccer, and often take
time out while traveling to engage in a game of football on some nearby
â™¦ athletic field.

j Although the boys lccently ap
' peared in "The Big Broadcast," they
do not favor American movies. The
; language barrier is 100 much for
I them, but whenever they are able
j to find a German film ihey greet it
j enthusiastically.
They love concerts, symphony
J performances, and chamber music,
| but they cannot make out Amer
| ican comic sections. Show them an
{ American rotogravure section full
I of pictures of aviators, ships, and
j i ll the daring exploits fo the mod-
I ern world, however, and they make
i a wild scramble for it.
Started in 1498
The choir originated in 1498, just
I .six years after the discovery of
j America, at the command of Em
| peror Maximilian of Austria. It
j has continued generation after gen
eration, growing from eight boys to
eighty. From their ranks have
: come the great composers, Schubert,
1 Mozart, and Haydn.
The Vienna Choir Boys come to
the campus after a tour of Austra
lia. Tickets for the concert, which
j will be given in the Pavilion to
i morrow night at 8:30 o'clock, are on
j .sale at the Concert Series Office in
the Old Union.
