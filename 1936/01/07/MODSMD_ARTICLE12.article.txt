# Union Ends Decibel Riots By Payoff
## 
### 
Time was when you could get
\ one thing for nothing in the Un
ion Cellar. That one thing was
decibels, which, in case you didn't
; know, is what the engineering de
partment and Fred Allen call
i noise.
] Many times, when you didn't
get indigestion, you got aural dys
i pepsia, listening to all the plates
and knives and forks and waiters
| carrying on during the noon hour.
I And now, in its most recent
economy move, the Union has
| closed down on free goods. For
| $12(i0 they have cornercd the deci
i bel market, spending that amount
on sound-proof panelling for the
| ceiling of the soda-fountain
! room.
Now there isn't any more ex
j ruse for those waiters. They can
hear themselves think, so they'll
know when they've Stopped.
