# Reg Dancers To Hear New Tunes
## Bud Bernhardt and Cab Callaway Feature Affair 
### 
Favorite Gaieties' tunes will be I
revived at the winter quarter regis- j
tration dance Friday in the Worn- i
en's Gym after the Stanford- ,
U.C.L.A. basketball game. Bud
Bernhardt, popular campus crooner,
will sine, "The Wind and the Rain,"
and "The Principle of the Thing.'
Shirley Jones, Cab Calloway and
Larry Randall will also repeat their
numbers from the show.
Besides the old tunes, Fred Nagel j
and Pete Knecht have arranged a
new instrumental novelty number
by Mac Gordon, "Throw It Away," (
which, Nagel says, ought to be as I
popular as "The Music Goes Round |
and Round," which it resembles.
Postponed because of the death of
Timothy Hopkins and late registra
tion, the Reg Dance will last four
hours instead of the usual three. ;
Admission will still be $1 per couple.
Gordy Heche is acting as dance
chairman in the absence of Win- j
stead Weaver, who has gone to
Honolulu with the football team.
Students staying home from the |
Honolulu junket may get their du
cats for the "dollar opera" today
at the A.S.S.U. office. Tickets will
be on saie for the rest, of the week.
