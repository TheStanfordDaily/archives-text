WASHINGTON, Jan. <i (/P).—
The Treasury announced tonight
tin* blanket suspension of all col
lections of taxes and payments
under the AAA.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (JP). —
President Roosevelt and immediate
aides agreed today to ask funds to
pay off farmers for performance un
der AAA contracts entered into
prior to today's Supreme Court de
cision invalidating the Act.
The President went over the
majority and minority court opin
ions in a two hour session with
Attorney General Cummings, Sec
retary Wallace and Congressional
agricultural leaders. The confer
ence said no decision was reached
on new legislation.
A further study is to be made.
Chairman Jones, Democrat, Texas,
of the House Agricultural commit
tee, stated:
"Regardless of all elsq we feel
it is necessary to have an appro
priation to take care of the moral
obligation to pay farmers who en
tered into contracts with the AAA
in good faith prior to today."
Cummings said it "might be pos
sible ' to pass a law forbidding all
suits for the refund of processing
taxes paid, but said he "did not
know ye!, whether this could be
done retroactively."
To more specific questions re
garding (he effect of the opinion on
the processor's right to seek re
fund of processing taxes, Cummings
said:
"We don't know. We will have
to read the opinion very closely
before we can make any decision
on those matters."
