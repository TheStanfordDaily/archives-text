## Wally Brooke To Head Western Board Of National Organization 
### Dave Botsford 
Abolishment of compulsory R. O.
T. C. in American universities, as
suggested by the Nye-Kvale bill
now before Congress, was ap
proved almost unanimously by the
National Student Federation of
American at its holiday meeting in
Kansas City, Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U.
president and Stanford representa
tive to the assembly, told The Daily
yesterday.
Brooke said the Federation would
join a strong lobby to fight at Wash
ington for the abolishment bill.
President Brooke was elected to
head the Federation's advisory
board for the Far Western region.
Mercedes Bergmann, Women's
Conference president, also repre
sented Stanford. She was the first
woman ever to represent the Farm
at (he national meeting.
During its four-day session, the
Federation's 150 student leaders dis
i ussed and debated prominent na
tional bills and national govern
ment action as it concerned the
youth of the country.
Brooke, Marijean McKay of (he
University of Florida, and Tom
Ncblctt, Federation president, de
bated over a national radio net
work the success of student gov
ernment .and college courses in
training students for future civil
and political life. No decision was
rendered.
After long, heated quarrels and
c-i.scussion the student body leaders
resolved to back up the Amateur
Athletic Union in its stand that the
United States should allow her ath
letes to enter the Olympics this
summer, Brooke said.
Aubrey Williams, national direc
tor of the National Youth Adminis
tration, explained the Roosevelt ad
ministration's student aid attempts.
Some of the delegates complained
the students themselves were not
; mply represented on the NYA ad
visory board, 'out the assembly went
on record as approving the NYA.
The condemnation of William
Randolph Hearst and his enter
prises was not unanimous, said
Brooke, because some of the
members argued that such action
could do little actual good.
