# Bookstore Banner Says Indians Won, 14-0, in Rose Bowl
## 
### 
You'd think the bookstore would
know better, being so good at fig
ures, but late yesterday they were
still trying to tell us that Stanford
. beat the surreptitious Smoos, 14-0.
I That score is on a banner hung in
! the show-window, and it's not a
j mistake—just a prediction, a sample,
one might say, of what an eastern
, tent-maker thinks of the Stanford
i team.
It's a good sample, too, according
ic Miss Marion Coyle, who dispenses
banners. Furthermore, if you don't
like it, you can order a banner with
any score you please, including the
right one. There's a high limit of
j four figures per team, however, be
j cause there isn't room for more.
