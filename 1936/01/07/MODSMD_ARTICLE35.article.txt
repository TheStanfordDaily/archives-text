## 
### 
Basketball, mongrel sport invent
ed to pass the time of footballers
and baseballers between seasons,
will rise to Olympic dignity at Ber
lin this year, Coach John Bunn told
a Stanford Radio Hour audience
over KGO last night.
Many sports, including football,
are indebted to basketball for many
of their plays, he said. The forward
pass he cited as an example of this
unacknowledged borrowing.
An experiment in a Yale dor
mitory showed there were more
germs in a room after it had been
i.wept than before.
