# Coach Sees Good Season For Tankmen
## Stanford All-Americans Face Strong Winged O, S.C., California Squads 
### Herb Diamond 
With heavy workouts scheduled to
continue, Coach Nort Thornton's
yearling and varsity swimming
squads, each replete with all-Amer
ican aces, is rapidly rounding into
shape for the current season.
Thornton is highly optimistic in
discussing the possibilities for
Stanford's !!).'{(» aggregation, hut
local competitive forces he fears
more than a I idle. That the In
dians rank high on the Coast
aquatic ladder is of little doubt;
however, such outstanding teams
as California, U.S.C., Y.MX'.A.,
and the Olympic Cluh must he
reckoned with before predicting
any championships for the Red
skins.
Six stellar sprint men — Jack
Kuhn, Henry Godman, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, Jack Vifaert, Martin Scatena,
and Bill Lhamon—should give an
enviable account of themselves in
this season's battles. Together they
constitute one of the strongest forces
ever assembled in intercollegiate
competition. Godman, who returns
to the fold after a year's absence,
now wears the 50-yard Junior Pa
cific Association crown He has also
been accorded all-American honors
and is currently rated tenth among
the nation's fastest sprinters
While in prep school, Vibert
carried oil top honors in the 50,
100, and 200-meter free style
events. Also among his recent
achievements are Pacific Coast
A.A.U. championships in the 100-
meter distance and also the 220;
Hob Walker, a transfer from
Golden Gate Junior College,
joins Thprnton's charges as a na
tional 400-meter back stroke rec
ord holder. Mason Lctleau and
Hob Eticrine will be counted on to
holster Stanford's power in the
hack stroke events also.
Tom Boothe, varsity diver, should
be able to compete favorably with
any and all aerial acrobatic compe
tition; Vibert and Bob Hoover are
almost equally strong in the 220;
and Kuhn and Don Peterson will
provide ample talent in the 440.
Heavy workouts are scheduled for
the next few week-ends, with the
first of these set to get under way at
11 o'clock Saturday morning when
frosh, varsity, and reserves will
tangle.

more than a I idle. That the In
dians rank high on the Coast

Six stellar sprint men — Jack
Kuhn, Henry Godman, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, Jack Vifaert, Martin Scatena,
