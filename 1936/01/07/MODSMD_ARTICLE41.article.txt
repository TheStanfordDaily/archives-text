### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (/P)—A
treasury deficit exceeding one bil
lion dollars—without counting un
estimated new relief costs — was
forecast to congress by President
Roosevelt today for the next fiscal
year.
Unprecedentedly, he withheld a
complete budget estimate on how
much the government would spend
in the 12 months beginning July
1. For the present he listed $6,752,-
606 370 but said later requests for
work-relief money would be forth
coming.
He gave notice that next year's
deficit—and the public debt—would
mount accordingly.
Just now, Mr. Roosevelt foresaw
a debt at the end of 1936-37 period
of $31,351,638,737.
