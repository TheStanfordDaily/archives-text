NEW REGIME
FOR CONFERENCE

Stanford will be eye witness to
one of the newest of football "ex
periments" next season when the
newly formed "big eight" of the
Pacific Coast opens, its round robin
of grid warfare.
Undoubtedly this reorganized
Pacific Coast Conference will be
a great success—that is to its par
ticipants. The very idea of each
major conference team playing
every other seems to be the solu
tion to a long needed reorganiza
tion within tiie local conference.
When the annual scheme-mak
ing meeting of the league heads was
held last month, it was hardly be
lieved that the bosses would break
eld precedent and actually do some
thing. And when they swung open
the doors and blazed fjorth with
out warning their drastic new sched
ule it struck like a thunderbolt.
The "independents"—St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, U.S.F., CJonzaga, and
Loyola—were furious. And cer
tainly they had a right to beef.
But the conference meeting was
to make plans for the good of
conference teams, and that was
.just what was done.
For in that move the strongest
conference in the country was
formed and where formerly there
was a loosely knit federation now
is created a real league, well or
ganized, uniform.

TOUGH BREAK
FOR "INDEPENDENTS"

By the time the California game
rolls around next season the In
dians and Bears will have played
Ihe same number of games and the
same opponents.
There will he no "breathers,''
and both will have been through
equally tough schedules. It will
be a great improvement over the
slip-shod method of scheduling in
the past.
But in the achieving of the per
fect set-up for major conference
teams someone had to take it in
(he neck and the "independents"
got the bad end of the deal. It is
tough that it had to v ork out that
way, for the Santa Clara-California
game and the U.S.F.-Stanford meet
ing were gaining in popularity with
every year.
However, the damage done will
be offset by the good in this new
action, and despite threats of re
prisals and even legislative ac
tion made by the outraged sup
porters of "independents" who
have made an appeal to Governor
Frank Merriam to take hand in
the situation, it is probable that
the new league will go on.
No longer is the Pacific Coast
Conference a farce. Dreams of the
greatest football league in America
are coming true. —Frost

TOUGH BREAK
FOR "INDEPENDENTS"

By the time the California game
rolls around next season the In
dians and Bears will have played
Ihe same number of games and the
same opponents.
There will he no "breathers,''
and both will have been through
equally tough schedules. It will
be a great improvement over the
slip-shod method of scheduling in
the past.
But in the achieving of the per
fect set-up for major conference
teams someone had to take it in
(he neck and the "independents"
got the bad end of the deal. It is
tough that it had to v ork out that
way, for the Santa Clara-California
game and the U.S.F.-Stanford meet
ing were gaining in popularity with
every year.
However, the damage done will
be offset by the good in this new
action, and despite threats of re
prisals and even legislative ac
tion made by the outraged sup
porters of "independents" who
have made an appeal to Governor
Frank Merriam to take hand in
the situation, it is probable that
the new league will go on.

NEW REGIME
FOR CONFERENCE

Stanford will be eye witness to
one of the newest of football "ex
periments" next season when the
newly formed "big eight" of the
Pacific Coast opens, its round robin
of grid warfare.
Undoubtedly this reorganized
Pacific Coast Conference will be
a great success—that is to its par
ticipants. The very idea of each
major conference team playing
every other seems to be the solu
tion to a long needed reorganiza
tion within tiie local conference.
When the annual scheme-mak
ing meeting of the league heads was
held last month, it was hardly be
lieved that the bosses would break
eld precedent and actually do some
thing. And when they swung open
the doors and blazed fjorth with
out warning their drastic new sched
ule it struck like a thunderbolt.
The "independents"—St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, U.S.F., CJonzaga, and
Loyola—were furious. And cer
tainly they had a right to beef.
