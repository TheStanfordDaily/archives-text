# Drama Post Vacant; Hardy Leaves School
## Dramatic Council Will Appoint New Manager 
### 
Dramatic Mjanager Rex Hardy
will submit his resignation to Dra
matic Council tomorrow afternoon.
Hardy stated his intention to re
sign last night because he is not
registered this quarter, and will not
be in attendance at the University.
He will leave for the South in a
few weeks where he has accepted a
position for the remainder of the
quarter. However, he expects to be
back spring quarter. His absence
will automatically make him ineli
gible to hold the position in the
spring.
Hardy will recommend a man to
fill the position to Dramatic Council.
They will then appoint the new Dra
matic Manager, who need not neces
sarily be the man Hardy recom
mends, and the appointment will be
subject to Ex Committee's approval.
Whether or not Dramatic Council
will choose Hardy's successor this
afternoon, in time for Ex Commit
tee's review this evening, is not
known at this writing.
Should Ex Committee disapprove
of the Council's choice, the matter
will be returned to them for the se
lection of another man, since Ex
Committee can not fill the position,
but has only the power to accept
or reject Dramatic Council's ap
pointment.
