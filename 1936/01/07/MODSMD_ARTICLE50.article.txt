# Card Athletes Get Set For Olympics Try
## Old Timers Train With Present Star for Honors 
### 
Ben Eastman will not be the only
Stanford man trying out for the
1936 Olympic Games at Berlin. Be
sides the tall, blond "Blazer,"
v.orld middle distance champion,
who is almost a cinch for the team, I
six or eight other Cardinal track
stars of the past and present and
several swimmers will probably en
ter the sectional tryouts.
Here Laborde, giant weight man i
who, with Eastman, Bill Miller, and
''Nellie" Gray, composed Stanford's :
"Big Four'' in the 1932 games, tossed
the discus over 150 feet recently in j
San Francisco, and is a good bet to
repeat. Miller, pole vault champion
four years ago, and Gray, who
placed in the shot put, will not en- I
ter this year.
Lyman, Mottram May Try
Ex-Indian greats of slightly more
recent vintage who may represent
Lncle Sam at Berim include John
ny Lyman, '34, weight heaver, and
Johnny Mottram, '35, javelin ace.
Lyman is studying chemistry in
Germany now, and has been put- ,
ting the shot 54 feet in practice
there. If he returns to the United
States in time for the tryouts, he
should again be second only to Jack
Torrance, if to anybody. "220-foot" j
Mottram will definitely represent
the Olympic Club.
Even '3(i'ers Have Chance
Sam KJopstock in the high hur
dles, Humbert Smith in the high
jump, Jim Reynolds in the weights,
and possibly Chuck Nimmo, dis- 1
tance man, and Phil Levy, another â– 
weight tosser, are those of the '36
track team with the best chances to
compete in the games.
Nort Thornton's varsity and
frosh swimming teams include ;
several prospects for the tryouts. j
Henry Godman in the 100 meters, I
Jack Vibert on the four-man, 800-
meter relay quartet, and Don I
Towne, star frosh breast-stroker, all j
have good chances if they improve (
enough. Ernst Brandsten is groom- ;
ing Tom Boothe, a senior, and Roy I
Winkleman, '39, for platform div- !
ing.
