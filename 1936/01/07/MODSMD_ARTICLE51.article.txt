# Thousands Cheer As Mustangs Roll Home
## 
### 
The kind of crowds that might j
have turned out for Roosevelt in I
1933 greeted the Texas Mustangs as j
their special train rolled through the*)
Lone Star state to the Southern
Methodist University campus.
A crowd estimated at 25,000 jam- ;
med the Union Station at Dallas i
yesterday and cheered the 7-0 los
ers in the Rose Bowl classic on New
Year's Day. The celebrants were
quite different in spirit and num
ber from those who greeted the vic
torious Indians at Palo Alto.
