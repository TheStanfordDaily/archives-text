# Indian Hoop Team Full of Ace Players
## 
### Warren Breed 
By Warren Breed

Notwithstanding the fact that
Angelo "Hank" Luisetti is being
acclaimed by all hands as a Bobby
Grayson of basketball, critics these
ciays preceding the opening of the
Conference, set for Friday night, are
prone to overlook that there are at
least a half-dozen others who are
capable of playing a lot of basket
ball along with Hank.
So far it has been I!aiik who
has scored most of the points in
the fiine Raines already played,
and it is Hank who is indefatig
able 011 the defense. But in the
same starting line-up with* him
there are four other sweet cagÂ«rs,
men who would have been Luiset
tis in the past decade of Stanford
hoop mediocrity.
Of course there arc the oldsters,
Captain Dinty Moors and Howell

Turner, the "veteranss" of the team.
Both were regulars last year and
both were high in all-Coast ratings
last winter. And both will be on
hand next year.
At center is the tall Art Stoefen.
Art works with Turner and Luisetti
in bringing the ball down the court
on a quick break and, although this
is his first year of college ball, he is
already smooth enough to work in
with the others. His height lets him
in for much tipping work, and
Luisetti's set-ups come many times
light from the Stoefen finger-tips.
The fifth spot is so far no-man's
job. Bob Zonnc worked in that
position most of the fall quarter,
John Calderwood started most of
the games there, and Sparky Rob
ertson scored the most points from
there. Coach John Bunn has not
made up his mind just who is
going to get the call for the
U.C.L.A. games here this week
end. The former was an L.A. all
city man and the last two were
stars at San Mateo and Santa Rosa
Jaysces.
Going beyond, Bunn has for first
line reserves men like Bill Quade,
frosh star and sub last year; Ken
Bell and Ken Nobs, twe-year veter
ans; Duane Edmonds, all-Confer-,
ence from Moran's; H. B. Lee and
Nelly Heath, '34 frosh regular
guards.
Friday night the campus will not
enly see its "New Deal" basketball
team in action for the first time, but
will see the new three-ring tip-off
idea, which will eliminate an ex
cess of bodily contact of floor
jump-balls.
