# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press While Ranting At Reds In Colleges Hearst Forgets American Principles 
### 
Meeting of the American Student Union in
Columbus afforded America's most vociferous
Tory a new chance to lash out again against
the bogey of Communism. Mr. Hearst found
that lliis group had "absorbed into its bosom
all that is poisonous in American college life"
and rejected everything that is "liberal," viz.,
"the doctrine of individual liberty and aggres
sive dynamic Americanism."
Without attempting to support or disclaim
the pledges and beliefs of the Student Union,
it might be worth while to point out just how
un-American the self-proclaimed American,
Mr. Hearst, is in his mouthings. In proclaim
ing for liberty his editorials either forget or
ignore the basic point of democracy—freedom
to express opinions.
It is no freedom of expression at all which
allows Hearst and Co. to print what they will
for the consumption of millions but would
stillc such leftist but pathetically small mi
norities as the American Student Union.
In the editorial of yesterday morning, Mr.
Hearst look a sensible stand in branding as a
"foolish gesture the action of the convention
in endorsing the "Oxford Oath" which calls
for pledgers refusing to come to the defense
of the United States even if it is attacked.
But the issue is not that Mr. Hearst stum

bles across one or two worthy points in the
course of one of his tirades against collegiate
Reds. The point is that the slight handful that
constitutes the radical element in the nation's
colleges, and the somewhat larger number
who sympathize with them, should have the
right to express themselves to the full.
The worth and need of free speech in a de
mocracy has been pointed out time and again
by this country's leaders. And educators have
often proclaimed that there is 110 more obvi
ous place for unhampered expression to exist
than within the nation's colleges.
Since words are but a feeble mode of chang
ing the course of the world, the underlying
theory seems to he "Let 'em talk; they can't
hurt anybody, and maybe their wild clamors
will prod the conservative powers - that -be
mildly in the liberal direction."
Vet Mr. Hearst urges that all radical ex
pression with its well-known tonic elfects be
strangulated. Then America would stagnate,
not have the dynamic quality he claims he
wants for it. The Student Union, it appears
then, is closer to "the doctrine of individual
liberty and aggressive, dynamic American
ism" than the publisher who claims they have
rejected that doctrine.
The latter, it seems, merely subscribes to
the "aggressive" part.

ing the course of the world, the underlying
theory seems to he "Let 'em talk; they can't
hurt anybody, and maybe their wild clamors
will prod the conservative powers - that -be
mildly in the liberal direction."
Vet Mr. Hearst urges that all radical ex
pression with its well-known tonic elfects be
strangulated. Then America would stagnate,
not have the dynamic quality he claims he
wants for it. The Student Union, it appears
then, is closer to "the doctrine of individual
liberty and aggressive, dynamic American
ism" than the publisher who claims they have
rejected that doctrine.
The latter, it seems, merely subscribes to
the "aggressive" part.
Meeting of the American Student Union in
Columbus afforded America's most vociferous
Tory a new chance to lash out again against
the bogey of Communism. Mr. Hearst found
that lliis group had "absorbed into its bosom
all that is poisonous in American college life"
and rejected everything that is "liberal," viz.,
"the doctrine of individual liberty and aggres
sive dynamic Americanism."
Without attempting to support or disclaim
the pledges and beliefs of the Student Union,
it might be worth while to point out just how
un-American the self-proclaimed American,
Mr. Hearst, is in his mouthings. In proclaim
ing for liberty his editorials either forget or
ignore the basic point of democracy—freedom
to express opinions.
It is no freedom of expression at all which
allows Hearst and Co. to print what they will
for the consumption of millions but would
stillc such leftist but pathetically small mi
norities as the American Student Union.
In the editorial of yesterday morning, Mr.
Hearst look a sensible stand in branding as a
"foolish gesture the action of the convention
in endorsing the "Oxford Oath" which calls
for pledgers refusing to come to the defense
of the United States even if it is attacked.
But the issue is not that Mr. Hearst stum

bles across one or two worthy points in the
course of one of his tirades against collegiate
Reds. The point is that the slight handful that
constitutes the radical element in the nation's
colleges, and the somewhat larger number
who sympathize with them, should have the
right to express themselves to the full.
The worth and need of free speech in a de
mocracy has been pointed out time and again
by this country's leaders. And educators have
often proclaimed that there is 110 more obvi
ous place for unhampered expression to exist
than within the nation's colleges.
Since words are but a feeble mode of chang
ing the course of the world, the underlying
theory seems to he "Let 'em talk; they can't
hurt anybody, and maybe their wild clamors
will prod the conservative powers - that -be
mildly in the liberal direction."
