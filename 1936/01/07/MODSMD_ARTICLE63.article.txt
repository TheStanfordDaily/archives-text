# A 						$5,000 Investment In Students and Peace
## 
### 
The announcement early this week by Ed
die Cantor, noted screen and radio comedian,
that he will award a .$5,000 scholarship for
Ihe best essay on "flow Can America Stay Out
of War?" has already met with considerable
interest and support on the Stanford campus.
Stanford has long been considered one of
the nation's leading universities in the fight
for peace this reputation originated with Da
vid Starr Jordan, who made the furtherance
of international goodwill one of bis main ob
jectives; and the University was again recog
nized as a leader in this fight two years ago
when it received the FIDAC peace award.
Both Cantor's purpose and his sentiments
in sponsoring the contest deserve support.
The essays submitted may furnish a construc
tive and practical suggestion for insuring
American non-participation in a future world
war, and Cantor's belief in that publicity
given the contest will further the cause of
peace. In connection with his announcement,
the comedian said:
"Like most people in this country, I'm a
rabid peace advocate. I'm certain that the
winning letter will be one worthy to bring
before millions of Americans as another link
in the strong chain of peace."
In this statement, Cantor is entirely correct.
A definite public sentiment against war neces
sarily is a pre-requisite for further develop
ment in the movement to insure peace.
