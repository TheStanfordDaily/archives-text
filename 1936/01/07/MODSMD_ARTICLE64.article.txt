### 
Several nationally known Stanford athletes
and athletic teams have begun training with
a renewed purpose during the past month as
the Farm looks forward to the 193(> Olympic

Games in Berlin next summer.
Ben Eastman, Gordy Dunn, and other
names familiar on the Farm make the Ama
teur Athletic Union's decision to support
American participation a matter of personal
interest to the Stanford campus.
But while America's youth begins its Olym
pic preparation, a few die-hard groups are
continuing their prejudiced light, doomed as
it is to failure, by taking pot-shots at the Mer
lin-bound American forces. The latest move
of the "snipers" was to incorporate an "Amer
ican Goodwill Union to Preserve the Olympic
Ideal," which is planning an international
meet to rival the Gaines next summer.
Since the American Olympic Committee,
however, has definitely secured the support
of the A.A.U. and the N.C.A.A. these protests
can only be a nuisance, and they will be grad
ually brushed aside as Game-time approaches.
Stanford's athletes can safely continue their
trek toward the final tryouts, and several of
tliein undoubtedly will be included in Ihe
United States' traveling squad next July.
