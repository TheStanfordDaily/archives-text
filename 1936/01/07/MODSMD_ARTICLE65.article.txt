The local wiseguys can hardly wait the two or
three weeks until the Bawlout is published. When it
comes out they will go up and down the columns
and laugh themselves sick at the names of the home
towns of our registered scholars. A name like Black
well Corners, or Prairie Junction, or Los Angeles
will keep them laughing clear through a Stanford
Radio Hour.
There used to be a very, very clever duck indeed
who didn't want to have the administration communi
cate with his parents in case of "sickness." So he
made up all kinds of bright and original names like
Skunkvilte, Whimpyburg, or Whatsita U.
One time he registered from the comparatively
mosaic spot of Juneau, Alaska. Several months after
l he Bawlout was published that quarter, he got a fan
letter from the wilds of New York from a soul
starved adolescent, who wanted to know how it felt
to live in the frozen north amongst Esquimaux, polo
bears, and reindeer. Legend does not state whether
or not the eccentric answered by saying that the sub
arctic flora and fauna of Roble Hall kept him from
getting homesick.
Every quarter he put down a different town in his
little Bcrtillion registration booklet and every quar
ter the Bawlout appeared with the funny names. The
demand for the little buff volume jumped by leaps
and so forth. Administration tycoons were consid
ering putting in illustrations, upping the price to 20
cents, put the picture of a physics major on the cover
and selling the Bawlout on the Quad.
But the boom couldn't last. This very, very clever
duck kept accumulating 15 units every three months
end was bound to graduate. Finally, his last quarter
came. Everyone lay in wait. When the Bawlout was
announced, a mob lined up in front of the cashier's
window that has been exceeded in modern times
only by the NYA breadlines. They all nervously
thumbed the pages. And there it was. True to ex
pectations it was the supreme effort. The duck had
registered from Weedpatc'n, Calif.
A roar went up that shook the University. A mob
of admirers rushed to congratulate the genius. A little
sadly and with a touch of pathos, the very, very
clever duck disclaimed all credit, admitting that not
i nly is there a Weedpatch in California, but that he,
the very clever duck, lived there.
