## NATIONAL HOBBY-1936 
### 
When grandpop was a lady-killer, the current
crazes were Mission furniture, Anna Held, and the
bunny-hug. Today the national hobby is sending
junior to college. Experts may deem this comparison
inept, but they cannot deny the fact that an over
whelming number of parents are sending their sons
to more and more junior colleges, colleges, and uni
versities so that, the new generation may have a
"better chance" than the old one.
Invariably, families hope to see their sons sitting
behind mahogany desks making a noise like a million
dollars going down a coal-chute by playing organ on
pearl push-buttons. As for following in father's foot
steps—doing a manual job well and supporting a
family in ordinary decency—not for our Willie, they
promise themselves. For Willie, by gum, is going to
be an industrial tycoon with a collapsable opera hat
and a sleek and snooty V-12.
* * * *
The nation's proud papas and mamas have devel
oped a conditioned reflex against plumbing, carpen
tering, and like professions. Just suggest that their
son, while a nice boy, would make a good electrician
but an outstandingly poor executive, and their hands
automatically fly up in horror.
"Willie is really a smart boy," they will tell you.
"And he's going to college if we have to steal to
send him."
* ♦ iH *
For university training is almost invariably con
sidered as the open sesame to the President's office
and the social register. Somehow, sitting four years
in a classroom, owning a diploma, is all you need to
get to the top, they believe. That the academic pro
cedure is not the fountain of the bountiful life, that
social science majoring is anything but a guaranty
of success, is a truth that has not yet fully pene
trated the national mind. God knows how many
years it will take to convince struggling fathers and
ambitious mothers that their Willie hasn't the aca
demic knack, that education guarantees nothing, and
that there isn't enough room at the top of the na
tion's economic and social structure for 120,000,000
big-shots.
* # * *
And even after that bitter truth has been swal
lowed, it will take more years for the nation to realize
that ability to do a physical job and do it well is one
of the most liberal bounties this society or nature
can bestow.
Then, perhaps, and then only, will the colleges
return to their status as mind trainers, and then wiil
the trade school spring up, both developing the traits
peculiar to the individual. When that day comes, we
will see the end of the fish-out-of-water grad, who
knows little and can do nothing, and his replacement
by the worker-with-his-hmds, who may also know
little, but who can do something.

The nation's proud papas and mamas have devel
oped a conditioned reflex against plumbing, carpen
tering, and like professions. Just suggest that their
son, while a nice boy, would make a good electrician
but an outstandingly poor executive, and their hands
automatically fly up in horror.
"Willie is really a smart boy," they will tell you.
"And he's going to college if we have to steal to
send him."

For university training is almost invariably con
sidered as the open sesame to the President's office
and the social register. Somehow, sitting four years
in a classroom, owning a diploma, is all you need to
get to the top, they believe. That the academic pro
cedure is not the fountain of the bountiful life, that
social science majoring is anything but a guaranty
of success, is a truth that has not yet fully pene
trated the national mind. God knows how many
years it will take to convince struggling fathers and
ambitious mothers that their Willie hasn't the aca
demic knack, that education guarantees nothing, and
that there isn't enough room at the top of the na
tion's economic and social structure for 120,000,000
big-shots.

And even after that bitter truth has been swal
lowed, it will take more years for the nation to realize
that ability to do a physical job and do it well is one
of the most liberal bounties this society or nature
can bestow.
Then, perhaps, and then only, will the colleges
return to their status as mind trainers, and then wiil
the trade school spring up, both developing the traits
peculiar to the individual. When that day comes, we
will see the end of the fish-out-of-water grad, who
knows little and can do nothing, and his replacement
by the worker-with-his-hmds, who may also know
little, but who can do something.

When grandpop was a lady-killer, the current
crazes were Mission furniture, Anna Held, and the
bunny-hug. Today the national hobby is sending
junior to college. Experts may deem this comparison
inept, but they cannot deny the fact that an over
whelming number of parents are sending their sons
to more and more junior colleges, colleges, and uni
versities so that, the new generation may have a
"better chance" than the old one.
Invariably, families hope to see their sons sitting
behind mahogany desks making a noise like a million
dollars going down a coal-chute by playing organ on
pearl push-buttons. As for following in father's foot
steps—doing a manual job well and supporting a
family in ordinary decency—not for our Willie, they
promise themselves. For Willie, by gum, is going to
be an industrial tycoon with a collapsable opera hat
and a sleek and snooty V-12.
