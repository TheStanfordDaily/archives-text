"THE MUSIC GOES HOUND and
Round," that jazz classic which is
sweeping the country to the delight
or dismay of its various hearers,
was written by three gentlemen
yclept, from left to right, Farley,
Hodgson, and Reilly.
Farley picked up an odd species
of horn in a hock shop one day, and
took it with him to New York's
Onyx Club, where he and Reilly
were playing. That evening a blonde
at one of the "ringside" tables, who
happened to be rather high, yelled,
"How the heck do you play that
thing," at Farley.
"Why," he replied, 'I blow
through here, the music goes down
and around and it comes out here.
Then I push the first valve down,
and the music goes down and
around, and it comes out here."
Then Farley suddenly realized the
swing to the words. So he and
Reilly got together afterwards to
set the thing to music. They did,
and sent the result to Hodgson, in
Chicago, who revised it and tight
ened it up. Then, after getting the
number copyrighted, they sold it to
a publisher for a price which netted
Ihem $1000 apiece.
Not only that, but the team gets
3 cents on each piano copy sold, G
cents on each orchestration, and
one-third of all moneys received for
recording rights.
TOM- COAKLEY, as we tried to
tell you yesterday but had no space
to do so, returns to the Frantic to
night. at the usual increase in prices,
probably. He brings back with him

Virginia Haig, Frank Burton, and
Carl Ravazza as vocalists. The
broadcast is on KFRC at 10:30.
SUGGESTION: With all the the
aters going in for "Bank Night,"
"Free Car Night," "Amateur Night,"
etc., it might be a good idea for
some pioneering theater manager, us
an innovation, to stage a "Mo
lion Picture Night."
