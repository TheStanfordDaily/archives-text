# Students Ballot On Disposition Of Book Store Profits
## Alternatives to Cumbersome Rebate System Considered by Ex Committee 
### 
The future of Hook Store rebates will he decided by a student body
vote in February, concluded Ex Committee in last night's session. Pos
sible alternatives *to the expensive and impractical refund system are
donating the sum to the theater, to student organizations, to the scholar
ship fund, or to a free circulating library.

Professor Everett Lesley, speaking<
for the board of directors, explained
the co-operative basis of the store.
The problem now, he says, is to find
a better way to dispose of inevi
table profits.
"This is all very bewildering, acv
tuaily having money offered to us,"
admitted Bob Gros. "I favor schol
arships. Mr. Hoover thinks the Re
publicans may got in, and if *NYA
stops we'd have more needy stu
dents." Frank Fullenwider elaimed
that a fiction library would be
more equitable method of distribu
tion.
Lesley Requested an A.S.S.U.
expression of opinion. "I)o elec
tions mean anything?" objected
Fullenwider. "We're all elected
officers, so I can speak freely."
Only two members agreed to an
A.S.S.U. vote. "This shows a ten
deney of democratically chosen offi
cers toward Fascism," gloomily pre
dicted Sterling Cottrell. Three
more immediately assented.
DRAMATIC MANAGER for the
remainder of the year will be George
Lindahl. Dramatic Council yester
day accepted the resignation of
Hardy, who wiil not be in school
this quarter. Ex Committee rati
fied its recommendation.
MEMBERSHIP of Ex Committee
continues intact. Hank Luisetti,
thought in danger because of a
minus Bawlout rating, may remain
on (he board because he was plus
when elected. Bobby Grayson, due
to miss at. least four meetings, is
still a member because registered
this quarter.
"Grayson has a substitute any
way—why not use Fred Williams
on Ex Committee?" came from the
sidelines.
INTERNATIONAL COMMIT
TEE will be headed by Bill Mingst,
who replaces Henry Tani. "Two stu
dents were recommended," observed
Wally Brooke. "One can't take it."
"Now I'm all mingst up," pun
ned Fullenwider..
"Our friend is elected," con
cluded Brooke.
"Who? Fullenwider?" said Gros,
waking. "I didn't know he had a
friend."

The future of Hook Store rebates will he decided by a student body
vote in February, concluded Ex Committee in last night's session. Pos
sible alternatives *to the expensive and impractical refund system are
donating the sum to the theater, to student organizations, to the scholar
ship fund, or to a free circulating library.

Professor Everett Lesley, speaking<
for the board of directors, explained
the co-operative basis of the store.
The problem now, he says, is to find
a better way to dispose of inevi
table profits.
"This is all very bewildering, acv
tuaily having money offered to us,"
admitted Bob Gros. "I favor schol
arships. Mr. Hoover thinks the Re
publicans may got in, and if *NYA
stops we'd have more needy stu
dents." Frank Fullenwider elaimed
that a fiction library would be
more equitable method of distribu
tion.
Lesley Requested an A.S.S.U.

tions mean anything?" objected
Fullenwider. "We're all elected
officers, so I can speak freely."
