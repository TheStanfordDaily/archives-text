# Bonus To Be Voted On Friday
## Bill Authorizes Payment To Vets Immediately 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (/P). â€”A
veterans' organization bonus bill,
slightly amended as to its financing
features, tonight was steered toward
a house vote Friday which Demo
cratic leaders conceded would ap
prove it by "an overwhelming ma
jority."
Members of the appropriations'
committee said they had no ob
jection to laying aside the inde
pendent offices appropriation bill,
which is to come up tomorrow for
general debate.-
That opened the door for the ways
and means committee to ask for a
rule on the bonus tomorrow, bring
it up for House discussions Thursday
and a vote Friday.
The bill would authorize im
mediate cash payment of the bo
nus, but offer a 3 per cent interest
inducement to veterans not to
cash their adjusted service certifi
cates until 1945, the maturity date
under existing law. It would pro
vide no specific method of pay
ment.
The ways and means committee
decided to knock out one provision
that would have refunded all inter
est paid by veterans r. i loans on the
certificates but. kept another that
would cancel all unpaid interest on
such loans.
Representative Vinson, Democrat,
Kentucky, one of the backers of the
legislation, said the refund would
have amounted to $7,000,000 and that
the cancellation will cost $288,000,-
000. He said the additional cash
outlay immediately on enactment of
the bill, backed by the American
Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars,
and Disabled American Veterans,
still would be around $1,000,000,000.
