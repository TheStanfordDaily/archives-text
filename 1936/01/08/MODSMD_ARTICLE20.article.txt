# Pettus Tells Of Chinese Flora
## Landscape Artists Make Small Areas Seem Vast 
### 
Just as the Chinese landscape [
painter can "bring in a thousand |
; miles within a foot of paper," so the j
j Chinese landscape architect sug
| gests acres of scenic land within
[ the confines of a small garden, cx
i plained Dr. William B. Pettus in the
j Assembly Hall last night.
Dr. Pettus, president of the Cali- :
fornia College in Peking, presented j
J slides from his own collection of i
i Chinese landscape paintings and I
I photographs of Peking gardens.
Unlike our own geometrically
designed, one - planed gardens,
Chinese gardens rarely contain
flowers and are irregularly laid
J out. Bright-tiled tea-houses, wa
i terways, and picturesque rock
I groups are emphasized, pointed
out Dr. Pettus.
The outside world concealed by
trees and naturalistic fences, the
Chinese garden furnishes a retreat
for the scholar and the thinker who
desire the benefits of travel and yet
j cannot leave home.
| Arranged in multiple planes, the
i gardens of China bear a resem
blance, to her landscape paintings.
, Chinese paintings have been un
justly criticized, I)r. Pettus said. !
for their lack of perspective. The !
aim of the artist, however, is not
to present a scenic photograph, i
but rather the series of impres
sions he has received after weeks
of contemplation.
Whereas Chinese gardens are rel- |
atively inaccessible, those of Japan '
I are not, explained Dr. Pettus. Japa-
I nese gardens, modeled on those of j
| her older neighbor, contain greater !
I expanses of sod, noisier streams, and |
I more flowering trees.
