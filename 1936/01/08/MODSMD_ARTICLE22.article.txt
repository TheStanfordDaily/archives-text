Since its start in 1927, tho Stan
ford Graduate School of Business
has always managed 1o find good
positions for its graduates, ac
cording to Professor Paul Holden, in
ch&rge of making the placements.
Though no job is guaranteed by the
school, even in the last four "de
pression" classes, all graduates
have been placed either before
school is out or by the middle of
the summer.
Graduates of the school, which
offers a two-year course, have
entered all fields of business, but
in the past few years there has
been a change in vogue from
such financial phases of business
as bond-selling, popular in the
prosperous years before 1929, to
such non-linancial aspects, as
manufacturing and distribution.
Tho Graduate School of Business,
stated Professoi Holden. is of
course not yet old enough for a
large portion of our men to have
"arrived" at prominent positions,
though an appreciable number past

I the fifth year oui of the school have
reached important executive posi
tions in large organizations. Clif
ford Schink, treasurer of the C.
i and I-I. Sugar Company of San
Francisco; Dudley Swim, secretary
treasurer of the National Investors'
Corporation; and Clifford Ander
| son, vice-president of ihe Crown
Iron Works of Minneapolis, may be
cited as examples.
In 1927 there were only two grad-
I uates of the school and until 1330
| there were nevei more than ten.
Places arc found for .students
I all over the United S tatcs. Of
; the last class, one-half settled in
I* San Francisco, one-fourth in oth
er parts of California, and one
fourth in various other states,
"n the last two years," continued
Holden, "there have been occasions
wh n we have had more positions
open to graduates than we have had
men to fdl them. In addition, there
ha.s been a grov. ing demand for
graduates who have been out sev-
I eral years and had specific types of
I practical experience."

Graduates of the school, which
offers a two-year course, have
entered all fields of business, but
in the past few years there has
been a change in vogue from
such financial phases of business
as bond-selling, popular in the
prosperous years before 1929, to
such non-linancial aspects, as
manufacturing and distribution.
Tho Graduate School of Business,
stated Professoi Holden. is of
course not yet old enough for a
large portion of our men to have
"arrived" at prominent positions,
though an appreciable number past

I the fifth year oui of the school have
reached important executive posi
tions in large organizations. Clif
ford Schink, treasurer of the C.
i and I-I. Sugar Company of San
Francisco; Dudley Swim, secretary
treasurer of the National Investors'
Corporation; and Clifford Ander
| son, vice-president of ihe Crown
Iron Works of Minneapolis, may be
cited as examples.
In 1927 there were only two grad-
I uates of the school and until 1330
| there were nevei more than ten.
Places arc found for .students
I all over the United S tatcs. Of
; the last class, one-half settled in
I* San Francisco, one-fourth in oth
er parts of California, and one
fourth in various other states,
"n the last two years," continued
Holden, "there have been occasions
wh n we have had more positions
open to graduates than we have had
men to fdl them. In addition, there
ha.s been a grov. ing demand for
graduates who have been out sev-
I eral years and had specific types of
I practical experience."
