# Vienna Choir Boys To Appear Tonight
## Franz Schubert Will Be Featured in Concert At Basketball Pavilion 
### 
An outstanding feature of to
night's concert by the Vienna Choir
Boys, to be given at 8:20 in the Pa
vilion, will be a rendition of Franz
Schubert's operetta, "A Song from
Old Vienna."
The Vienna Choir Boys are the
second attraction on the student
concert series. The group, which
has a history dating hack five cen
turies, comes from Vienna. Its
members were, until after the
War, proteges of the Austrian Im
perial family, and even yet they
arc quartered in the old Wilhelm
cnenberg Castle, in whose cham
bers once breathed the nobility of
the llapsburg dynasty.
Each year the choir goes on tour,
one which takes them to most of
the European capitals, and, in re
cenc years, to America. One of their
unique traditions is to give a fare
well concert for their admirers in
the Vienna railway station just be
fore their train pulls out.
The members of the choir are
choien by rigid competition from
the best boy singers in Austria.
Foity of them are housed in the old
castle, where they work, study,
play, eat, and sleep under the di
rection of their tutors.
When their voices change, as
they inevitably do since castrati
have been banned from the or
ganization, they are assigned to
duties about the castle, are main
tained for three years, and future
employment secured for them.
Only 22 of the 40 are in the com
pany which appears at Stanford to
night, however. In addition to the
Schubert operetta, they will sing
arias and choruses by Wagner and
Mozart, as wpII as national chor
uses and Christmas songs.
