# Widespread Attacks Lash Roosevelt Talk
## Gen. Johnson, Hitting at Speech, Warns Against Danger of Class Conflict 
### 
Warning against an impending
class conflict which may bring a
crisis in the coming political cam
paigns, General Hugh Johnson,
former NRA administrator, yester
day lashed out in sharp criticism at
I resident Roosevelt's message to
Congress.
General Johnson, speaking at a
meeting in Chicago, declared the
rift "will result from the oppos
ing alignments of big business and
administration leaders unless an
understanding is reached." These
indictments follow a series of sim
ilar statements which the former
relief chief has made since his
resignation in 1934.
In attacking President Roose
velt's speech, Johnson said:
"Perhaps the least considered
sentence was on unemployment:
'Shall we say your problem was
local, except -that perhaps the
federal government, as an act of
mere generosity will be willing
to pay to your city or your county
a few grudging dollars, etc.'
"'1 he best answer to that is the
Democratic platform to which the j
.peaker had pledged himself 300!
per cent to get elected: 'Extension of
the federal credit to the states to
provide unemployment relief when
ever the diminishing resources of
the state made it impossible for
then to provide for the needy.'
"All this is cheap and indefens
ible. But if business is 97 per cent
against this administration, then it
is natural for this administration to
draw the battle lines on exactly the
issue presented by business."
Johnson declared that "one by
one, there has been removed from
this administration practically
every important official who has
smj first-hand knowledge of busi
ness in this country or any par
ticular sympathy with it. One by
one, on the other side, there has
been side-tracked from spokes
manship for business, pratcically
every important person who fias
any sympathy for this administra
tion.
"What is the inevitable result of
this alignment in the coming cam
paign? It is . . . class conflict. It is
civil war."
To remedy the situation, General j
Johnson advised business leaders to
go to the President and ask him
what he intends ot do, and said they j
should be received "with every sin- |
cere assumption of good faith, more !
than half-way, with no lurking sus- j
picion that they were emissaries of
evil.

every important person who fias
any sympathy for this administra

"What is the inevitable result of
this alignment in the coming cam
paign? It is . . . class conflict. It is
civil war."
To remedy the situation, General j
Johnson advised business leaders to
go to the President and ask him
what he intends ot do, and said they j
should be received "with every sin- |
cere assumption of good faith, more !
than half-way, with no lurking sus- j
picion that they were emissaries of
evil.
Warning against an impending
class conflict which may bring a
crisis in the coming political cam
paigns, General Hugh Johnson,
former NRA administrator, yester
day lashed out in sharp criticism at
I resident Roosevelt's message to
Congress.
General Johnson, speaking at a
meeting in Chicago, declared the
rift "will result from the oppos
ing alignments of big business and
administration leaders unless an
understanding is reached." These
indictments follow a series of sim
ilar statements which the former
relief chief has made since his
resignation in 1934.
In attacking President Roose
velt's speech, Johnson said:
"Perhaps the least considered
sentence was on unemployment:
'Shall we say your problem was
local, except -that perhaps the
federal government, as an act of
mere generosity will be willing
to pay to your city or your county
a few grudging dollars, etc.'
"'1 he best answer to that is the
Democratic platform to which the j
.peaker had pledged himself 300!
per cent to get elected: 'Extension of
the federal credit to the states to
provide unemployment relief when
ever the diminishing resources of
the state made it impossible for
then to provide for the needy.'
"All this is cheap and indefens
ible. But if business is 97 per cent
against this administration, then it
is natural for this administration to
draw the battle lines on exactly the
issue presented by business."
Johnson declared that "one by
one, there has been removed from
this administration practically
every important official who has
smj first-hand knowledge of busi
ness in this country or any par
ticular sympathy with it. One by
one, on the other side, there has
