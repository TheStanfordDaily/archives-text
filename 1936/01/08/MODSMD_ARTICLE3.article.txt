# Financial Big Shots Own New Cars
## 
### 
Of course it means nothing, and
we say so first off to avoid a crit
ical Hash-back, but the fact re
mains (.as facts always do), that
there are five new cars parked
outside the Old Union.
Which iruth is amazing and
amusing because they belong to
Wally Brooke, Bob Gros, Miss Inez
Stevens, secretary in the A.S.S.U.
office, Imogen Aten, A.S.S.U.
bookkeeper, and Mrs. Tess Kelly,
also a Unionizer.
"It was Christmas," explains
Gros. "Or maybe they were New
Year's presents."
"It's still a good feature," we
said. "Five people who watch
student money roll in—and out—
have new cars. Beautiful!"
