# Morgan Talks Before Senate
## Reveals Wilson Aided American Allies' Loans 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (/P). â€”
With J. P. Morgan seated placidly
before it, the Senate Munitions
Committee filled an important gap
in world war history today with a
disclosure that Woodrow Wilson
himself removed obstacles to the
first of many American loans to
allied nations.
From the head of the powerful
house of Morgan, however, there
came assertions also that German
acts, and not the lending of Amer
ican dollars, drew this country into
the war.
The financier and his associates
at the same time readily told the
committee that the sympathies of
the American banking fraternity lay
actively with the Allies from the
start, and, as quickly as diplomatic
barriers were removed, the loans
began to flow in increasing volume.
