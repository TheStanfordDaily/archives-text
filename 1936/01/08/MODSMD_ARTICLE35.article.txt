# Faculty Members Score Congressional Address

When questioned last night con
cerning his opinion of the message
delivered by President Roosevelt to
Congress last Friday night, Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell of the De
partment of Political Science said
that although he enjoyed the speech,
he found several faults with it.
"In the first place," said Mr.
Cottrell, "the attack which the
President made upon the busi
ness interests of the country was
quite uncalled for, and had no
place in a message to Congress.
Besides this the only recommend
ation which he made was concern
ing the necessity for the neutral
ity of this country in case of a
further outbreak of hostilities in
Europe.
"He quite ignored such important
factors as the bonus. In addition,
the only policy which the President
outlined was that there should be
no additional taxes levied by the
government."
• Professor Cottrell added that the
greater part of the address was de
voted to launching the President's
campaign for re-election.
Professor Edward M. Ilulme of
the Department of History, upon
being questioned on the same sub
ject, said that although there has
been much criticism of the Presi
dent's references to European af
fairs, he does not think they were
strong enough to do any harm, and
may possibly do some good.
Hulme said the chief reference to
affairs in this country was the state
ment that certain vested interests
are stubbornly opposed to further
government control as well as to
government entry in the production
of light and power.
"I approve completely of this
statement," continued Hulme, "and
I hope that it will enable many
more voters to see just how things
stand and to vote accordingly."
The third professor interviewed
was Charles N. Reynolds of the
Department of Economics. In the
(opinion of Professor Reynolds,,
"messages" to Congress, which
are broadcast to the public, are
always basically political speech
es. This is even more true when
the talk comes at a time near the
end of the first term of a presi
dent who is seeking re-election,
Mr. Reynolds said.
"However," said Reynolds, "I
think the President was a little
more frank than is customary in
similar circumstances. I have my
doubts as to the effects of the Presi
dent's message as a political speech.
He laid himself open to criticism by
making such a 'fighting talk'."

been much criticism of the Presi
dent's references to European af
fairs, he does not think they were
strong enough to do any harm, and
may possibly do some good.
Hulme said the chief reference to
affairs in this country was the state
ment that certain vested interests
are stubbornly opposed to further
government control as well as to
government entry in the production
of light and power.
"I approve completely of this
statement," continued Hulme, "and
I hope that it will enable many
more voters to see just how things
stand and to vote accordingly."
The third professor interviewed
was Charles N. Reynolds of the
Department of Economics. In the
(opinion of Professor Reynolds,,
"messages" to Congress, which
are broadcast to the public, are
always basically political speech
es. This is even more true when
the talk comes at a time near the
end of the first term of a presi
dent who is seeking re-election,
Mr. Reynolds said.
"However," said Reynolds, "I
think the President was a little
more frank than is customary in
similar circumstances. I have my
doubts as to the effects of the Presi
dent's message as a political speech.
He laid himself open to criticism by
making such a 'fighting talk'."
When questioned last night con
cerning his opinion of the message
delivered by President Roosevelt to
Congress last Friday night, Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell of the De
partment of Political Science said
that although he enjoyed the speech,
he found several faults with it.
"In the first place," said Mr.
Cottrell, "the attack which the
President made upon the busi
ness interests of the country was
quite uncalled for, and had no
place in a message to Congress.
Besides this the only recommend
ation which he made was concern
ing the necessity for the neutral
ity of this country in case of a
further outbreak of hostilities in
Europe.
"He quite ignored such important
factors as the bonus. In addition,
the only policy which the President
outlined was that there should be
no additional taxes levied by the
government."
• Professor Cottrell added that the
greater part of the address was de
voted to launching the President's
campaign for re-election.
Professor Edward M. Ilulme of
the Department of History, upon
being questioned on the same sub
ject, said that although there has
been much criticism of the Presi
dent's references to European af
fairs, he does not think they were
strong enough to do any harm, and
