terday had askad Pacific Coast mar
itime unions to "live up to their
agreement and submit disputes to
arbitration."
A collapse in the settlement nego
tiations in the strike against the

Panama Pacififc
liner Pennsyl
vania, the re
lease of Mat
son Line's Maui
at Oakland, the
tie-up of four
schooners
bringing the to

leading only 12

the coast, and
demands for

by ferryboat

employees developed.
In the message, which was a re
ply to Harry Lundeberg, president
of the Maritime Federation of the
Pacific, who charged that ship
owners' violation.* of the agreements
brought on the schooner strike,
Miss Perkins stated:
"No doubt you are aware that
the shipowners in numerous com
munications also claim that they
have been similarly affected by
violation of other sections of the
award, in that the maritime crafts
have resorted to strikes and walk
outs without regard to the arbitra
tion clauses."
