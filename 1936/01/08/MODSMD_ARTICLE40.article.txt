## 
### 
Campus opinion yesterday dif
fered as to whether Bobby Gray
son's number "22" jersey should be
hung in the B.A.C. trophy room
along with Ernie Nevers'. The
Daily Monday editorially advocated
taking Grayson's number from fur
ther play, thus honoring the all-
American gridman.
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president;
A1 Roth, comptroller; and Dinty
Moore, Ex Committee member,
voiced the opinion of many when
they questioned picking one "im
mortal" from a team full of out
standing men. Bob Gros, student
manager, agreed with The Daily
that to honor Grayson in such a way
would be a "just tribute."
Graduate Manager A1 Masters re
turned from Pasadena yesterday in
time to "think the idea's all right.
First I've heard of it."
Strongly in favor of The Daily's
suggestion was Gros. "I certainly
believe that Bobby's jersey should
be in there right along with Ernie
Nevers'. He's played great football
and brought a lot of publicity to
Stanford. It seems to me a just
tribute."
"the entire matter will be decided
by Ex Committee.
