HONOLULU, Jan. 7 (A I ). â€”Hawaii
sugir producers, who in 1935 de
ceived benefit payments of $11,243,-
515, generally viewed the Supreme
Court decision invalidating the AAA
as a distinct blow to the sugar in
dustry.
"The sugar section of the AAA
has worked to the advantage of all
producers of sugar," said Alexander
Walker, president of the Hawaiian
Sugar Planters Association.
