# Ruggers Meet Blues Saturday
## 
### 
Ruggers will open their season
Saturday when the first team meets |
I the San Francisco Blues and the
seconds play the Argonauts on the
old frosh football field now used for
rugby.
The first practice of the year was !
called last night by Coach Jim i
Wiley, who has taken Harry Ma- ,
loney's place. Wiley has been \
working with Maloney for several j
i years. Last night's practice in- j
eluded preliminary signal and for- j
mat ion drills and plenty of running. !
It will probably take a couple of '
weeks before the team has fully J
rounded into shape. Several let- !
I termen have returned from last \
year, but there are not enough to !
fill the 15 places on the team. Cap- :
tain Joe Vigna and Tony Cockins |
are the outstanding men returning [
in the backfield, and Jim Mullen i
[ and Jerry Peters should be the !
mainstays in the scrum.
