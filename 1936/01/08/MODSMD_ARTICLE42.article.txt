# Ruggers Meet Blues Saturday
## 
### 
Ruggers will open their season
Saturday when the first team meets
the San Francisco Blues and the
seconds play the Argonauts on the
old frosh football field now used for
rugby.
The first practice of the year was
called last night by Coach Jim
Wiley, who has taken Harry Ma-
loney's place. Wiley has been
working with Maloney for several
years. Last night's practice in-
cluded preliminary signal and for-
mation drills and plenty of running.
It will probably take a couple of
weeks before the team has fully
rounded into shape. Several let-
termen have returned from last
year, but there are not enough to
fill the 15 places on the team. Cap-
tain Joe Vigna and Tony Cockins
are the outstanding men returning
in the backfield, and Jim Mullen
and Jerry Peters should be the
mainstays in the scrum.
