DAM-ON RUN YON
JtAMIJLES ON

Spoils Critic Damon Runyon has
been --lyly poking fun at Stanford
for the last two years. The other
day he threw another flaunt Farm
ward. However, il was such a clever
little piece that we can't help re
peating it here even if Runyon,
hater of Stanford football teams,
was the author.
It seems that Sir Runyon picked
Alabama to beat Stanford in the
Rose Bowl back in 1935. In no
uncertain terms he blasted forth
in bis country-wide story a vo
ciferous prognostication—Alaluuna
would win easily.
In view of the fact that Runyon
hadn't even seen Stanford play that
year, local sports writers blew up.
They called him every name they
could print—and a few more.
A.i it turned out, friend Damon
picked the game right, but we still
think he spoke a little loud. Any
way, that was the way it started —
this little Stanford-Runyon feud.
This year he decided to let Stan
ford win. After everything that had
gone before he admits that it cut
him somewhat to have to announce
his choice publicly.

THIS FELLOW
LIKES STANFORD

A few days ago, while doing a
littie clever back-patting (his own
back), he made reference to that
selection.
To quote, "The easiest (of the
New Year's Day predictions) was
Stanford - Southern
That was our four-X special, as
you may remember, though we
practically never pick Stanford to
win any football games of note.
(Nice fellow.)
"Indeed, we rather regretted find
ing our figures made Stanford such
a standout over the Texans that we
were absolutely compelled to name
the Caiifornians as our choice. We
regretted it because we are perfectly
well aware that the Stanford folks
have been loading their fountain
pens for us for two years, just wait
ing the opportunity to squirt words
of contumely all over, and we hate
to be a spoilsport. But we simply
had to cross them up."
Yep, we'll admit you've called
'em pretty well sc far, Sir Damon,
but there will come a day—and our
fountain pens are still loaded.
