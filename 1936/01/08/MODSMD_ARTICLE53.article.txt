# Robertson To Start Against U.C.L.A.
## Transfer Gets Berth for Cage Contest Friday Complete Card Line-up For First League Game 
### 
Just who will be the fifth starter, i
the regular left guard, in the im- I
pending Coast Conferenee basketball
opener here Friday night was made
a little clearer alter yesterday's ;
scrimmage session.
For Harold "Sparky" Robertson,
who learned his basketball at Eu
reka and Santa Rosa schools, was j
among those present in the white
shirted first-string quintet that
practiced offense and defense yes- i
terday.
The rest of the quintet ran Hank
Luisetti and Howell Turner, for- :
wards; Art Stoefen, center, and 1
Dinty Moore, right guard. So the j
chances are it will be the powerful,
aggressive transfer who will start

at the debatable position against
Caddy Works' Uclans Friday night.
Coach John Bunn is spotting
Robertson in his regular line-up
because he was highly recom
mended by Santa Rosa Junior Col
lege coaches, is a good shot and
an excellent tip-in man, and when
in the game infuses a dash of of
fensive aggressiveness that often
ends in cinch buckets—a dash that
is commensurable with the speed
that Luisctti, Turner, Stoefen, and
Moore are wont to generate.
Bob Zonne and John Calderwood
are Robertson's rivals for the post.
As to the games themselves, Stan
ford is the favorite over a veteran,
but not too fast, Westwood team.
Before Christmas the Uclans played
a pair of games in San Francisco, on
the same double bill with Stanford.
From the press box there was no
question that Santa Clara was twice
as confused by the Stanford attack
as they were by that of the Bruins.
After the game that week-end
in which the Cardinals spanked
Utah State's conference cham
pions, 7.']-.'{4. John Ball, lank Bruin
forward, said of Luisctti:
"Why that fellow seems bigger
and faster and better than Guttero
ever was." Which is not at all un
. founded, for Hank scored )»1 points
that night, in HO minutes.
Ball has considerable more sup
port this year than he had last. Chet
Freeze, another big boy the size of
Ball, is a bang-up floor man and de
pendable shot. Two smaller men,
Appleby and Widlicksa, are fast
ball-hawks. Len Ashen completes
the regular line-up.
