# Frosh Cagers Play Galileans Friday
## 
### 
Galileo High, the school that gave
Stanford Hank Luisetti, will invade
the Pavilion to tangle with the '3(5
frosh basketball team, coached by
Jimmy Bradshaw, at 0:30 o'clock
Friday night. If the yearling cagers
tame the Lions, they will try to
make it two straight by subduing
Paly High's Vikings Saturday eve
ning.
Actually it would be three
straight, for the Papooses trounced
Sacramento Junior College before
Christmas in the last tussle of a
three-game barnstorming trip. The
score was 42 to 23. a surprise
after two reverses. Marin Junior
College had beaten the frosh, 2!)
to 21. and Santa Rosa High
School had upset them, 3!) to 30,
before they reached the capital
city.'
Lf-ck of a defense embarrassed the
Thirty-niners in their losses to the
jaysess and the prepsters. Brad
shaw does not intend to enter the
home season with a team whose
goal is easy to pepper. The former
grid and court star from Nevada
drilled his so-called regulars al
most entirely on defense yesterday.
The present first string includes
Lyman Calkins and Jack Kessell,
forwards; Phil Zonne, center; and
Pete McArthur and Dick Neeley,
guards. This quintet was only par
tially successful yesterday in stop
ping the scoring thrusts of Russ
Fisher and Bob Brooke, forwards;
John West, center; and Bill Schu
ette and Wally dcWitt, guards.
Zonne is the only real star on
the team. Kid brother of liob
Zonne, sophomore guard, Phil
stands three or four inches over
six feet and is a fast, dangerous
shooter. He won all-city honors
at Los Angeles High School last
winter. Neeley is also a tall
player, but Calkins, Kessell, and
McArthur are all built nearer the
ground.
Shooting by both teams was fairly
good yesterday, with deWiU, full
back and accurate southpaw passer

| in football, and McArthur swishing
I several long ones through the net.
1 Passing was wild, however, and
| Bradshaw will stress it as well as
defense in practice today and to
morrow.
