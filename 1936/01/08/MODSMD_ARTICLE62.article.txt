# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Hall or Row? Take Your Pick, Frosh-- It Does Not Mean Success or Ignomy 
### 
After three and a half months of life on the
Farm, men of '39 don fanciest Christmas ties
before Encina mirrors this evening and trek
Row-ward.
And after three and a half months of rush
meetings and pep - talks, men of Stanford's
24 fraternities, already concerning themselves
about dates for the annual Pledge Prom next
week, gird their belts for the next to last siege
in the annual rat-race known as rushing.
Many members of these two groups—the
fraternities and the freshmen—are getting
slightly fed up with the whole idea; many
of them, particularly the inorc-or-less naive
Encina residents, cannot quite understand
the significance.
They have all had it explained that rushing
gives the prospective pledges a chance to look
over the fraternities; and it gives the houses
a chance to look over Ihe freshman class and
select the members it believes would "be an
asset to the House." This is the general defi
nition, applicable to rushing at any college.
Rut it goes deeper than that.
At Stanford, rushing is not narrowed down,
for the freshman who hopes to be a "social
success," to a mere choice of which fraternity
he will pledge; he is given this choice, hut in
addition is given an alternative of going either
Row or Hall.

The natural laws of self-preservation and
perpetuation prompt the fraternities to line
up their elasses before the date of official
pledging; for this they cannot be blamed. But
this same law of self-preservation just as
necessarily must prompt the pledge-elect to"
make a choice that will suit him for the next
three years of his college life.
If he will be happier living iu a Hall, Stan
ford oilers him this independence, without
attaching a stigma; if lie will be happier on
the Row, the Farm presents 24 alternatives.
The Encinainan who contemplates pledging
may regret it if he makes his selection too
hastily.
Rushing oilers something else that cannot
well be overlooked —il gives the freshman a
chance to broaden his panorama of college
life, and it oilers an opportunity for him to
enlarge his acquaintances. This will hold true
whether or not he pledges. A tuo-hasty de
cision either one way or the other will kill a
valuable thing that could be gained from
rushing.
The Farm's two-dozen fraternities each can
give a freshman certain things; the Halls can
give him certain other things. The choice —
which centers around mere personal prefer
ence and not social success or ignominy—
will be made definitely next week; but it must
be considered carefully now.
