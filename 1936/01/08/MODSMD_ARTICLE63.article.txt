# Full Houses May Indicate Success for Music Courses
## 
### 
Twenty-two members of the Vienna Boys
Choir tonight exercise their famous, natural
youthful voices for the benelit of a full or
nearly full Pavilion of campus dwellers and
townspeople.
Some Boughs with a liking for music will
not be on hand tonight because the $1 seats
were sold out and $1 .50 for one concert is out
of reach of their purses. Yet by buying season
tickets last quarter this concert could have
been heard for as little as 40 cents.
Concert Series prices arc a bit involved but
clearly put a premium on promptness. Those
students holding season tickets will sit in bet
ter seats while paying less than single seat
buyers.
In fact, even today, a student can buy a .$3
season ticket, see this concert from a $1.50
seat, and the Heifetz, Schoop, and Eddy pro
grains from similar scats.

These well-attended concerts year after year
show that interest in music is lively on the
Farm. Even though many townspeople hear
the concerts, the audiences of 2,000 contain a
large prooprtion of the Stanford student body.
Those music-loving students would most
likely be interested in a fuller music curricu
lum at Stanford. When the new Memorial
Hall is built a good locale for a larger music
department will be at hand, and possibly the
powers-that-be will see their way clear to en
hance this much-neglected side of Stanford
courses.
