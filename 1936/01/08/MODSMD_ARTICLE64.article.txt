# Needed Badlyâ€”Pavement For Part of Circle Drive
## 
### 
Without forgetting that funds for road
building on campus are few and far between

and realizing that the Administration has
done much in the past year toward bettering
campus roads, it still seems pertinent to sug
gest action on the road around the circle lead
ing from Palm Drive to the Chemistry Build
ing.
This road, which is used by a large per
centage of campus visitors and subject to con
stant use by campusitcs, is a disgrace. Un
lcvel, bumpy, and wavy, this short stub con
necting Lomita (street on the west of the
Quad) and Palm Drive probably deserves the
title of worst pavement on a campus of none
too-good pavements.
Wear and tear on cars traversing the
stretch, possibility of accidents, and the bad
impression given to visitors should be suffi
cient arguments to justify elimination or post
ponement of some slated campus improve
ment and the starting of immediate action to
ward leveling and resurfacing the strip.
