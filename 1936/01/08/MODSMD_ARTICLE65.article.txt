# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
Today, January 3, is a very important day.
At exactly 12 o'clock high noon, chimes will ring,
a whistle will blow, and radiators in the libc will go
"boom, boom." The steam will go round and round,
ho-ho-ho, and will conic out here, people will pour
out of buildings, and Our Hasher will turn over and
go back to sleep. Because today, January 8, is a
very important day.
All great wars are supposed to have started in
April, but Our Hasher Sez started on January 8, last
year, which should mean something, but unfortunately
doesn't. Today, being January 8, 1936, and an im
portant day, and there being nothing else to write
about, I will print my complete memoirs of that lousy,
rainy day when Our Hasher poked his beagle out
on this terrestrial void.
Our Hasher Sez started out to be a humor column,
but look at it now. Il was conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men arc created
evil. Women apparently are too, but you can't print
that.
You can blame iho whole business on Charlotte
Burridge, at that time women's editor of The Daily,
who thought it would be better for the paper for the
littlr pipsqueak reporter with his jittery style, to keep
his slurs about the freshman women off the front
p;ige and in secluded spot. The editor finally gave in
to the idea, and once they started the thing they
couldn't stop it, because they couldn't find anything
else to fill the bottom of the edit page.
I suppose it was Incvituble that the thing should
devolve into a scandal column. It started right out
in the middle of Women's Rushing, and all I knew I
put in the paper. People started telling me things,
and in my naive way I printed them. The editor
was pretty naive sometimes, too.
You can credit or discredit Stan Beaubaire with
the name of the column. When I wrote the first
batch (or butch) of guff, I was all for putting on
some fancy name that smacked of Broadway, Park
Avenue, and the Ritz. But it didn't smack right to
Reaubaire, and since the column that day was about
hashing for rushing, he smacked oti the title which
it will bear till its death, which will be soon if I
don't think of something else to write about tomorrow.

You can blame iho whole business on Charlotte
Burridge, at that time women's editor of The Daily,
who thought it would be better for the paper for the
littlr pipsqueak reporter with his jittery style, to keep
his slurs about the freshman women off the front
p;ige and in secluded spot. The editor finally gave in
to the idea, and once they started the thing they
couldn't stop it, because they couldn't find anything
else to fill the bottom of the edit page.
I suppose it was Incvituble that the thing should
devolve into a scandal column. It started right out
in the middle of Women's Rushing, and all I knew I
put in the paper. People started telling me things,
and in my naive way I printed them. The editor
was pretty naive sometimes, too.
You can credit or discredit Stan Beaubaire with
the name of the column. When I wrote the first
batch (or butch) of guff, I was all for putting on
some fancy name that smacked of Broadway, Park
Avenue, and the Ritz. But it didn't smack right to
Reaubaire, and since the column that day was about
hashing for rushing, he smacked oti the title which
it will bear till its death, which will be soon if I
don't think of something else to write about tomorrow.
Today, January 3, is a very important day.
At exactly 12 o'clock high noon, chimes will ring,
a whistle will blow, and radiators in the libc will go
"boom, boom." The steam will go round and round,
ho-ho-ho, and will conic out here, people will pour
out of buildings, and Our Hasher will turn over and
go back to sleep. Because today, January 8, is a
very important day.
All great wars are supposed to have started in
April, but Our Hasher Sez started on January 8, last
year, which should mean something, but unfortunately
doesn't. Today, being January 8, 1936, and an im
portant day, and there being nothing else to write
about, I will print my complete memoirs of that lousy,
rainy day when Our Hasher poked his beagle out
on this terrestrial void.
Our Hasher Sez started out to be a humor column,
but look at it now. Il was conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men arc created
evil. Women apparently are too, but you can't print
that.
