THE POOR WORKING CLASS OF THE GRIDIRON
How is it possible that tabor leaders . . . those mod
ern omnipresents imbued with the fanatical purpose of
liberating the exploited from the exploiters . . . are
passing up the Stanford football situation . . . the
situation where a few dozen men make nearly half
a million dollars and earn nothing themselves. Such
conditions anywhere but in a college would cause
Samuel Gompers to shudder in his grave and William
Green to wear out his tongue making public protests.

One might well imagine the feelings of an ardent
labor sympathizer if he should read Frank J. Taylor's
"Who Runs 8.A.C." in the December Illustrated Re
view, which, by the way, is a sick magazine emerg
ing into health under the capable direction of its new
editor-writer. In that article Mr. Taylor speaks out
with amazing courage and tells just how the B:A.C.
makes its money, how much it makes, and who gets
it. Most interesting inclusion comes at the end of a
paragraph telling how the profits ara divided up. To
quote: "Do the players get anything out of it? Not
at Stanford."
In a good year the B.A.C. often makes as much as
§200,000 profit. That money goes for payments on the
stadium, golf courses, men's and women's gyms, the
Pavilion, Angell Field, and Branner Hall. Last year
B.A.C. was so happy about getting another Rose Bowl
bid that it gave all its employees a fat bonus. And it
was so generous as to donate $5000 to the Student Aid
Fund. But do the players get anything out of it? No,'
they neglect their studies, submit to training rules,
suffer physical injuries, sacrifice their Christmas
vacation, and earn the 200 grand, hut they don't ac
tually get anything out ol it. Of course they see their
pictures and names in newspapers very often and hear
rooting sections cheer for them, and that, of course,
is very valuable.

But we mustn't think too harshly of the B.A.C.
because it doesn't hand about one per cent of its
earnings to the University and say, "Here. This is the
dough to pay a year's tuition for the first string."
The B.A.C. has a dream. When the "plant's" paid for,
it may follow in line with Yale, Harvard, and Duke
and set up a scholarship fund for the football players.

Frank Taylor calls the B.A.C. Santa Claus. And
that's a Rood characterization when one thinks in
terms of benefits to the University. But if this writer j
were a football player, he's feel like poor Bob Cratchet
serving under a tight-pursed Scrooge. And he'd be
tempted to turn agitator and bellow for a minimum
scholarship scale, a two-hour practice day, and a ,
bonus for the players. —John McCleiland
