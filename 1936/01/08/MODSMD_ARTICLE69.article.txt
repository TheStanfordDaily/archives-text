"ZAHAROFF, THE ARMAMENTS
KING," by Robert Neumann;
(Knopf).
It may be an indication of triv
iality, mental or otherwise—but the
chief thing we got out of Robert
Neumann's "Zaharoff, the Arma
mentss King," is proof that the best
way to get a large amount of pub
licity is to pretend to avoid it. Once
you've aroused the public curiosity,
of course.
Sir Basil began somewhat ob
scurely. He was a clever man, and
before long he had money. He was
fairly well along in years, however,
before his later technique seems to
have occurred to him. Example:
Sir Basil bought a chateau at Balin
court, in France, for himself and
the Spanish duchess he loved
through most of his adult life. And
what did Sir Basil do?
He gave orders that every post
card bearing a photograph of the
chateau be bought up. Then he is
sued further orders that nobody
should be permitted to photograph
the chateau. Obviously, nothing
could stimulate interest in the Za
haroff legend quite so effectively
unless Sir Basil had personally
chased a few inquiring photograph
ers off the estate.
The detail of Zaharoff's dozens of
intrigues are, to be frank, a bore.
Mr. Neumann is perfectly right to
concentrate on trying to build up a
portrait of the man, rather than to
provide a chronologically arranged
dossier of all the sales of death
machinery arranged by this Levan
tine. But as the author admits in
his preface, this is difficult if not
impossible.
Official papers (as in Mussolini's
case) have disappeared. Zaharoff
has told several stories of his birth.
People who have known him tell in
credibly different stories of his life;
in fact, they make him out a miser
on one hand and a generous philan
thropist on another; a perfectly
soulless man, and also one who
could remain a romantic in love
over decades of time. So that con
siderable confusion remains in the
reader's mind after finishing the
book.
He can at least be grateful, how
ever, that Mr. Neumann does not
pontificate. —John Sclby (/P)
