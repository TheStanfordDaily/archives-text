# Roosevelt Decides To Reimburse Farmers
## Wallace Asks Leaders To Discuss Problems 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan 7 {IP).â€”Sur
veying the ruins of his farm - aid
program, President Roosevelt re
ported tonight his only decision so
far is to ask Congress to reimburse
farmers for suddenly terminated
AAA contracts.
"Secretary Wallace, however,
called seventy farm leaders to the
capital for a conference Friday
and Saturday "to discuss plans
for agriculture in light of the Su
preme Court's decision in the Hoo
sac Mills ease."
Earlier, Wallace warned in a ra
dio speech against a return to farm
conditions of 1932. All field activities
of AAA were halted. Employees
here reported for work as usual,
although the treasury reported it
had stopped writing checks for ad
ministrative expenses, as well as
payments to farmers under the in
validated law.
Congressional leaders tried to
gauge the effect of the decision in
the nation, with no immediate
conclusions. Some advisers were
known to have suggested that the
President issue a statement; oth
ers warned against an immediate
pronouncement.
The effect, on other new deal laws
received renewed appraisal, with
considerable sorrowful head shak
ing. Cabinet members continued
their study of the court verdict and
tried to digest its vast implications.
Wallace cleared up one question
when he announced that in the Ag
riculture Department's opinion, pro
visions of the Adjustment Act gov
erning sugar quotas were not af
fected.
