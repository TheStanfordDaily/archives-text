# GOING 'ROUND AND 'ROUND
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For one quarter and the begin
ning of another I have been driven
to distraction by a terrific Encina
menace, Jazzmania.
The first quarter was featured by
tinpan piano ducts of "Double
Trouble" and "Rhythm Is My Busi
ness." (From the lack—it evidently
wasn't.) The ivories continued to
rattle out their reverberant dis
cords until the wee hours of the
morning, disturbing the accuracy of
the enumerations of sheep counters.
Tne aforementioned peace-break
ers were endured by patience
ialone, but now it is not only two,
but quite a few slap-happy jazz
hounds who are not content unless
"The Music Goes 'Round and
'Round." My suggestion is for the
sponsors to put a time limit on all
of this infernal racket!
Yours
A disturbed dormant
Quiet, please.—Ed.
