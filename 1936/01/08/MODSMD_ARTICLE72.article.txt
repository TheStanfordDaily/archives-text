JAZZ IS BANNED in Germany. !
That is not news. But its prohi
bition has raised an embarrassing
question as to what is or is not
jazz.
The music critic of the Berlin
Preussische Zeitung has written the
following analysis of Jazz, for which i
v/e are indebted to Wade Werner j
of the Associated Press foreign j
staff.
One of the easiest ways 10 spot i
jazz, says the German critic, is to i
rt member thac it usually "ends j
with a questioft mark," leaving ev- i
erything up in the air.
Another characteristic of negro
;azz, he says, is that it uses, in
stead of a real melody, a monoto
nous repetition ol some short and !
tiivial theme "driven to death with j
fantastic variations."
Jazz also may be recognized by I
its throbbing, determined hammer
ing. which, instead of charming the 1
hearer along from phrase to phrase j
with harmonious sounds, seeks j
rather to beat him into submission. J
The Berlin critic says that this t
hammering sometimes is muffled j
in a sickly over-sweetness which
emphasizes its essentially "suffo- i
eating and tortuous" effect.
Take that, Primdergoose, and let
Chappie do its darnedest!
THEATER NOTE: The construc
tion of the New Theater, after all
these years, has so overjoyed Dra- |
matic Council that one of its mem- |
bers will propose that the spots and i
sundry other equipment of the As
sembly Hall be donated to Henry
Ford's Early American Museum.
