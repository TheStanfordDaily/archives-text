# Borrowed Millions Help Minnesotans

### 
ST PAUL, Jan. 7 (/P). â€” Almost 1
$1i,000,000 in borrowed money has
helped lift the burden of the Minne- j
sota farmer in the last three years, |
says Andrew Boss, chairman of the
state corn loan program.
Recently more than 300 farmers
in 11 counties borrowed $94,000 un
der provisions of the 1935-36 fed- .
eral corn loan program.
The present borrowings, Boss
says, will fall below last year's fig
ure of $405,000 and the $5,500,000
borrowed under the 1933-34 pro
gram.
