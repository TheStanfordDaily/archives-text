# L-Men Raid Houses; Curb 'Snatch Racket'
## 
### 
Twenty-three Stanford fraterni
ties were raided during the holidays
—by the L-men.
While Farm fraternity men were
sleeping in other vicinities, Library
Head William Uwens and his hench
men successfully curbed an amaz
ing "snatch racket." After they'd
made the lounds, they crept back
to ' headquarters'' with 200 long
missing books tucked under their
arms.
Through open doors, jimmied
windows, grocery shoots they
sneaked, hut they got their man
—well, at least their hooks.
At one house the boys uncov
ered a startling "system" of an
nexing library books. The inge
nious fraternity men had skilfully
painted over the call numbers on
the books, proudly added them to

I the house library. Many Califor
nia libraries had "contributed"
i alntiß with Stanford.
A huge encyclopedia, missing for
months, turned up at the big white
house across from the post oflicc.
Also discovered there was a gem
from the San Antonio, Texas,
library.
Thorough searches of the Zete
and Phi Dolt houses netted no
loot. Hut. as one of the L-men
I remarked, "they probably never
. went to the lihe.'' , The A.K.L.
mansion may still he chock full—
the hoys couldn't get in.
The Library reported men's halls
"small time stuff." Few books were
recovered.
D 'an Mary Yost blasted plans for
complete campus coverage. She
prohibited searchers from entering
sororities or women's halls.
