### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (&).â€”<The t
I
virtual war time operation of sev- l
eral American rifle factories by the J
British government after negotia- ;
tions which found J. P. Morgan
sitting down with the British War
Council was revealed today by the
Senate Munitions Committee.
The arms companies concerned,
it was testified, were Winchester
end Remington.
In addition committee investi
gators disclosed that the State
Department, with the IDlfi elec- !
tion approaching, withheld from
publication for three weeks a J
British note received in the course
of a controversy over British in- j
terferencc with American com
merce.
Evidence to this effect was '
brought out during the protracted
sessions today, with J. P. Morgan, j
head of the powerful financial
house, and several of the partners I
on the witness stand for the second
consecutive day.
Both Morgan and Thomas W.
Lament, one of his partners who
l:ore the brunt of today's ques
tioning, testified that important
hanking interests stood to lose
heavily unless the contract set
tlements were satisfactory. On
these hanks, it was testified,
tliey depended for floating a con-

tcmplatcd British loan of $300,-
000,000.
The rifle contract provided a high
spot in a day which produced evi
dence that companies in which
Morgan was interested sold the al
lies $363,000,000 worth of goods be
fore the United States entered the
war.


J. P. Morgan
