# Call's Twisting of Daily Edit Decried
## 
### John Kline 
By use of an old trick, The Call-
Bulletin yesterday was able to dis
tort a Daily editorial attacking
i William Randolph Hearst for his
j anti-free speech policies into one
| "lauding" the puoiisher.
This case is worthy of mention
1 not only of itself, but because it is
; an example of how news services
' and metropolitan papers repeatedly
"pick up" college stories, twisting
them or turning them into "freaks."
The Daily had the fairness to pick
out one small paragraph in the
Hearst editorial it attacked and call
|it a "sensible stand." The other
eight paragraphs of the nine in the
Daily editorial condemned Hearst's
stand as un-American and pled
I for the right of minorities to speak
I freely.
Tells Part of Story
The Call's story was built around
the one paragraph favorable to Mr.
Hearst, completely ignoring the
rest. Its story ran under a headline
proclaiming "Stanford Daily Lauds
Hearst Editorial Attacking Rad
icals." The headline on the Daily
editorial considered as "praise" for
Mr. Hearst read: "While Ranting at
Reds in Colleges Hearst Forgets
American Principles."
Samples of the Daily's editorial
which disapproved of Hearst in
cluded such remarks as these:
". . . It. might be worthwhile to
point out just how un-American
| Ihe self-proclaimed American, Mr.
! Hearst, is in his mouthings. In pro
; claiming for liberty his editorials
i c idier forgot or ignore the basic
' point of democracy—freedom to ex
| press opinions."
". . . The Student Union, it ap-
I pears then, is closer to the 'doctrine
of individual liberty and aggres
sive, dynamic Americanism' than
the publisher who claims they have
j rejected that doctrine.
"Merely Aggressive"
"The latter, it seems, merely sub
scribes to the 'aggressive' part."
Although the Call did not actually
falsify, it gave an excellent example
| of politics and journalism at their
lowest. By taking a paragraph out
j of its context, by telling but a frac
• lion of the story, it was able to
completely reverse the stand of the
I Daily, making it appear foolish and
! favorable to Hearst.
Those interested in seeing how
distorters can take advantage of
the slightest opening left by an op
ponent will find the original Hearst
ian edit in the Examiner of Janu
i ary 6, the Daily's attack on it in the
issue of this paper for January 7,
and the Call-Bulletni's misleading
account on page four of that pa
per for yesterday, January 8.
C'cst la vie.

This case is worthy of mention
1 not only of itself, but because it is
; an example of how news services
' and metropolitan papers repeatedly
"pick up" college stories, twisting
them or turning them into "freaks."
The Daily had the fairness to pick
out one small paragraph in the
Hearst editorial it attacked and call
|it a "sensible stand." The other
eight paragraphs of the nine in the
Daily editorial condemned Hearst's
stand as un-American and pled
I for the right of minorities to speak
I freely.
Tells Part of Story
The Call's story was built around
the one paragraph favorable to Mr.
Hearst, completely ignoring the
rest. Its story ran under a headline
proclaiming "Stanford Daily Lauds
Hearst Editorial Attacking Rad
icals." The headline on the Daily
editorial considered as "praise" for
Mr. Hearst read: "While Ranting at
Reds in Colleges Hearst Forgets
American Principles."
Samples of the Daily's editorial
which disapproved of Hearst in
cluded such remarks as these:
". . . It. might be worthwhile to
point out just how un-American
| Ihe self-proclaimed American, Mr.
! Hearst, is in his mouthings. In pro
; claiming for liberty his editorials
i c idier forgot or ignore the basic
' point of democracy—freedom to ex
| press opinions."
". . . The Student Union, it ap-
I pears then, is closer to the 'doctrine
of individual liberty and aggres
sive, dynamic Americanism' than
the publisher who claims they have
j rejected that doctrine.
"Merely Aggressive"
"The latter, it seems, merely sub
scribes to the 'aggressive' part."
Although the Call did not actually
falsify, it gave an excellent example
| of politics and journalism at their
lowest. By taking a paragraph out
j of its context, by telling but a frac
• lion of the story, it was able to
completely reverse the stand of the
I Daily, making it appear foolish and
! favorable to Hearst.
Those interested in seeing how
distorters can take advantage of
the slightest opening left by an op
ponent will find the original Hearst
ian edit in the Examiner of Janu
i ary 6, the Daily's attack on it in the
issue of this paper for January 7,
and the Call-Bulletni's misleading
account on page four of that pa
