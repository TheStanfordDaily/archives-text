# Construction of Second Theater!!
## Work on Open-Air Arena Underway Roth Presents Plan For Five-Point Art Program 
### 
His dream of a five-unit art cen
ter for Stanford, making it the cul
tural hub of the bay area, was re
vealed today by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth as he broke the news
that Stanford was to have not only
one theater, but twoâ€”a completely
equipped home of dramatic art.
In time, he hopes to complete an
ambitious building program that
will encompass the graphic arts and
music as well as the stage, and
which will include five separate
structures.
One of these, the Art Gallery, is
already a reality. With the end of
1936, the theater building program
will be on its way to completion.
Then Mr. Roth hopes to start work
on a music building to stand near
the Memorial Theater and a Graphic
Arts Building, to house art classes.
Both structures will flank the The
ater building, forming virtually an
art quad.
