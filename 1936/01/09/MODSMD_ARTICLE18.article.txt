# Vienna Choir Disappointing
## 
### Phil Bernheim 
Tlie Vienna Choir Boys, like
Shirley Temple, will be described
as "cute." Unlike Shirley Temple,
(hey cannot act. This was proved
in their staging of Schubert's oper
etta, "A Song from Old Vienna,"
which they did in costume. Only the
boy who played the old grand
mother, with broad comedy, showed
any acting ability.
Like String Quartet
In their groups of serious songs,
the choir reminded this reviewer of
a string quartet, for as a string quar
tet lacks fullness when compared
with a symphony orchestra, so this
group lacked fullness when com
pared with a normal choir.
As a group they were interesting,
but the individual singers lacked
power and tonal steadiness, which
put them at a disadvantage in solo
parts.
Operetta Poor
As group singers, it must be
stressed, they were pleasing. But
their operetta, while it would have
done credit to a grammar school en
tertainment, was amateurish.
The chief complaint that can be
filed against them is that they
passed themselves off as a group of
artists, which they were not. They
were a good boys' choir, but not a
concert hall group.
