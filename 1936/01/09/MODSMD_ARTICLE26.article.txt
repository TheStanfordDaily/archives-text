# Structure To Serve For Concerts, Graduations, And Out-door Pageants
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
A wooded amphitheater, comp
arable in size and arrangement to
that at famous Bohemian Grove, is
under construction today on the
campus, bringing one step nearer
realization the dream of Comp
troller Almon E. Roth for a center
of arts at Stanford.
Arrangements to start work on
the project were completed yes
terday, when the University
closed a deal to secure an esti
mated 30,000 cubic yards of earth
to be excavated from the new Elll
- Subway in Palo Alto.
The earth will be trucked to the
amphitheater site, directly behind
the Memorial Theater already un
der construction, and there placed
to form the floor of the auditorium.
A tentative sketch by E. Leslie Kiler,
landscape ahchitect, shows a theater
seating 7500, with provision for in
crease to 10,000 when and if neces
sary, and an elevated stage 125 feet
wide, backed with a terraced land
scaped hill. The whole project is to
be surrounded by dense planting
extending to the streets circum
scribing the site.
Small Expense Involved
The dirt-fill will not cost the Uni
versity anything, and less than
$50,000 will be required to com
pletely equip the stage, pay for
the moveable auditorium seats, and
provide for the installation of a
sprinkling system and planting, Mr.
Roth estimates. He hopes that some
one interested in the development
of the arts at Stanford will contrib
ute the needed money.
Meanwhile, work is going ahead
following tentative approval of the
project by the Board of Trustees at
their last meeting. Part of the am
phitheater embankment is already
in place, formed by earth re
moved in constructing the new
street to run behind the Memorial
Theater and connecting Lasuen and
Galvez Streets.
Indoor Facilities
All the amphitheater will be
above ground level except for the
stage floor. The stage, itself, will
be directly opposite the stage block
of the Memorial Theater so that
open-air productions may be pre
pared will) facilities located there.
The audience will file to their
scats on patbs winding through
wooded glens. The auditorium,
placed on a graded dirt fill to pro
vide sight-lines, will appear as a
clearing in the ccnter of a dense
forest.
When completed, the amphi
theater will compare favorably with
famous natural bowls in California,
broadening Stanford's dramatic fa
cilities and providinga perfect site
for graduation ceremonies, summer
symphony concerts, and such open
air spectacles as Max Reinhardt.'s
"Midsummer Night's Dream," which
could not. play on the peninsula be
cause of the lack of a suitable
theater.
