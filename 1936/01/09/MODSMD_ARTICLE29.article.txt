# Copp Plans Big Chappie Party, Party
## 
### 
Ex Committee didn't okey the
date, but Chappie's Old Boy Jim
Copp's having a party anyway.
It'll be a big affairâ€”Pelicans,
Jack o' Lanterns, Kitty Kats,
Lampoons, everybody'll be there.
Friday|s Chaparral, first of thus
brand new year, will tell about it.
Jimmy (the father of Cad Can
cer, now-famous detectivress)
sort of thought we all might like
to see what other college comics
are like. You know, compare
them to ours and, maybe, laugh.
Pages and pages of pictures, gags,
and articles from leading college
funnymags will be reprinted.
Friday, therefore, will be "Party,
Party, Party" with favors, fire
works, and barrels of fun prom
ised to everyone. Copp stopped
washing his hair last night long
enough to say: "Just tell thein to
come, come all, to Chappie's party,
party, party."
