Works' U.C.L.A. basketballers will
arrive here tomorrow for the pur
pose of engaging John Bunn's new
ly-born world-beaters in a two
game series over the week-end.
Tomorrow night opens the
Conference season, with Cal meet
ing S.C. in Los Angeles, in addi
tion to the game here,
Down on the West wood campus
they call John Ball "Alice the Goon
Girl." But that is obviously only a

B.A.C. SUGGESTS

dents walk to the games Fri
day and Saturday nights, in
order to relieve a parking con
gestion. With the Theater be
ing under construction in the
adjacent lot, formerly used for
parking, parking facilities are
for the moment scarce.

friendly nickname, for John is quite
a munly specimen—about 6 and u
half feet tall and a real basketball
player. He was good last year, as a
gangling sophomore, sinking enough
buckets to get runner-up honors for
high-point man in the conference.
But Ball is not the sole casaba
juggler playing for Caddy Works.
A newcomer to the fold this year is
Chet Freeze, who is almost as big
as Ball, and who docs almost as
much damage as does the "Goon-
Boy."
Freeze is one forward, the other
one being Orv Appleby. While
Freeze and Ball are big and tall,
the other three starters belong to
the smaller variety.
At guard are Don Ashen and Ralph
McFadden, both of whom are of the
mix-it-up category.
No. 1 substitute is Alex Widlicksa,
two-year veteran. Another sub is
Horace Haight, who is not to be
confused with the orchestra leader,
whose name sounds the same.
Meanwhile at the Stanfox'd Pa
vilion Maestro John Bunn is still in
a quandary, hovering between the
choice of John Calderwood and
Sparky Robertson for starting guard.
