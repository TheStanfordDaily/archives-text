# Grayson Honor Gains Support
## 
### 
Added yesterday to the current
discussion concerning "immortaliz
ing" Bobby Grayson by placing his
number "22" jersey in the B.A.C.
trophy room were the comments of
Dean of Men George Culver, Ex
Committeeman Hank Luisetti, and
Quad Editor Don Hanson.
Luisetti agreed with A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke and oth
ers that to honor Grayson, as sug
gested by the Daily editorially
would be "unfair when so many on
the team were outstanding."
Dean Culver, however, saw merit
in the plan. "If there's a popular
appeal for it and Grayson himself
doesn't want the jersey, I think the
Daily's suggestion a great idea."
Hanson agreed with many that
"though undoubtedly the whole
team was great, Grayson was out
standing. His jersey would look
mighty good in that trophy room."
