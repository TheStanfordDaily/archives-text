FUTURE BRIGHT
FOR BASKETBALL

It's the beginning of a new regime
in Stanford basketball. When the
Card 19156 basketball quintet takes
the floor tomorrow night in its first
conference game with U.C.L.A.,
campus enthusiasts will get their
first good look at what promises to
be the best Indian squad in 15 years.
Ever since 1921. when Stanford
tied with California for the Coast
League crown, local fans have
been waiting for another team
of champions. But it never seemed
to materialize.
Yes, there have been plenty of
super players during these last 15
years but never more than one or
two on a squad. It just wasn't in
the Cards to pfoduuf. Bad luek,
close calls, have dogged Stanford
basketball.
But this year promises to be a
repetition of those days in 1921 when
Jim Da vies, Swede Richter, Bert
Mills, Dick Richmond and Fred
Adams beat the best on the coast.
That year they took two out of
three games from Cal and split
even with Washington to tic for
the conference lead with the Bears.
But since they'd beaten Cal, popu
lar opinion branded them best.

lIANK ISN'T
THE ONLY STAR

Tomorrow night when this '36
team opens up, it'll be the nearest
thing to that '21 squad seen on the
Farm since.
Speculator Hank Luisetti up
from last year's frosh will un
doubtedly he the scoring power
of the team. And from past per
formance it can he said without
exaggeration that Hank is as good
as any forward on the Coast.
In nine games played over the
Christmas holidays Luisetti scored
130 points despite the fact that in
one game he made but one point.
In that particular affair Coach John
Bunn ordered him not to shoot but
to "feed"' the ball. He followed or
ders and made his one point on a
foul shot.
But, good as he is, Hank has been
getting almost too much publicity
lately in relation to his value to
the team. For these other four or
five men are far better than ordi
nary players. Howell Turner, Lui
setti's running mate at forward,
was tenth among the scorers in the
Southern Division a year ago and
shows improvement since that
time.

BIG THINGS EXPECTED
OF MOORE

Captain Dinty Moore, all-Coast
guard last season and sixth in scor
ing in the Southern Division,
should be the outstanding guard on
the Pacific shores this year.
Teaming with Dinty tomorrow
night will he "Sparky" Robert
son, f»-2 ■•» transfer from Santa
Rosa J.C. who has the build and
power to make him a standout.
Robertson was unanimous choice
for all-Northern California J.C.
guard last year, high scorer for
bis team, and highest scoring
guard in tbe conference.
Pushing him every minute will be
Bob Zonne, giant 6-4 center from
the 1935 freshman suad, recently
shifted to guard.
At center lanky Art Stoefen, an
other G-4 man, brother of Lester
Stoefen of tennis fame, can hold
down the post in good shape. Stoef
en is a transfer from L.A.J.C.
Thus in these six, plus half a
dozen other first raters, Stanford
hsa a truly great collection of
basketball talent. Three times
they have scored over 70 points
in pre-season practice games.
Not since 11)17 has a Stanford
team ever before tallied over 60
points in one game.
One thing they lack is experience.
For that reason allowance can be
made if they start the season slow
and drop a game or two. But at this
time the clouds seem doomed to
rise off Stanford's basketball hori
