## Bradshaw Five To Play Galileo High Tomorrow 
### 
The introduction of Stanford's
| frosh basketball team to Farm fans
j tomorrow night, when they meet
Galileo High School, may be a clis- !
; appointment to both parties unless
the yearlings look better than they
j have appeared in practice this j
week.
.
Ragged passing, uncertain door- !
work, and uncertain defense
shown in yesterday's two-hour
session may he fatal against
Galileo High School, which has
a dangerous team.
; Bob Brooke worked out in Jack :
j Kessell's forward position yester- I
j day, as the latter missed the scrim
| mage. Brooke and Lyman Calkins,
| the other forward, showed a tend- j
ency to shoot from about 20 feet j
j away, instead of dribbling under
j the basket. Phil Zonne, tall center, 1
is a near cinch on "sucker" shots,
but was guarded closely by the sec- \
I ond string.
Pete McArthur and Dick Neel
cy, guards, show (lashes of talent,
| hut need smoothing, especially on
! defense. McArthur is a S'airly
fast dribbler and floor man.
A practice game between Brad
! shaw's tentative first and second
strings ended in a 24-12 victory for
the regulars. The reserves ap-
J peared the equal of the first five ;
i on defense and passing, but were i
j inferior as marksmen. Barring in- j

juries, a quintet composed oC Cal
kins, Kessell, Zonne, McArthur, and
Neeley will probably start in the
Pavilion against Galileo at 6:30
o'clock tomorrow evening, and
against Pally High at the same time
Saturday night.
