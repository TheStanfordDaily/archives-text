# Student Union Report Given
## N.S.F.A. Actions Told To Women's Meeting 
### 
The functions of the National
Student Federation of America and
the activities carried on at the Fed
eration's eleventh annual Congress
were told to members of Women's
Conference last night by Mercedes
Bergmann, chairman of Conference,
who attended the convention in
Kansas City during Christmas vaca
tion.
The purpose of the Federation
is to create intelligent student
opinion, and to consider various
student problems. At the present
time, the Federation is planning
to conduct a survey on univer
sity student governments; the in
formation from this survey will
he available to student body
presidents for suggestions toward
better government.
'Tar greater interest in national
and international affairs was shown
by eastern students than by west
ern," Miss Bergmann said. "But
even their interest and knowledge
was surpassed by that of English
representatives."
Discussion among women mem
bers of the Federation centered
upon training and the use of
vocational guidance. The latter
problem seemed common to
many of the colleges.
Stanford is well represented on
the various committees of the or
ganization, Wally Brooke being a
member of the Executive Commit
tee, and Mercedes Bergmann, the
membership committee, designated
to increase the number of chapters
on western campi.
