# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Expansion Move Gets Another Boost By Roth's 'Five-Point Art Program' 
### 
Last quarter, the greatest construction
project since the building of the original Quad
was launched on the Farm; now, less than
two months later, Comptroller Almon E. Roth
takes away the campus' breath by announcing
complete plans for an expansion program that
makes heretofore Utopian dreams of broad
ening Stanford's cultural facilities virtually
certain to be fulfilled.
The immense amphitheater will be the third
portion of the Administration's gigantic five
point art program. The already-established
Art Gallery and Memorial Hall, now under
construction, are the lirst two sections of the
cultural unit. Proposed Graphic Arts and
Music buildings will complete the plans.
This elaborate expansion move will take
considerable time. Details of linancing will
necessitate a delay in fitting the graphic arts
and music structures into this art program,
and the cultural set-up will be incomplete
until endowments for these two buildings are
secured.
The new amphitheater, which bears a finan
cial "if" totaling $30,000 to .$40,000, blends
nicely into the new picture to which the Uni
versity may now look forward. Starting this
theater without completing financial arrange
ments was an innovation in policy, occasioned
by the fact that the "deal was too good to

pass up."
Ten, possibly only five, years from now this
entire unit will be complete—the outdoor
theater will be beautified by the natural effect
that only growing trees and shrubbery can
give it; Memorial Hall will be caring for an
increased interest in drama; the Music and
Graphic Arts buildings will be satisfying a
long-clainored-for demand, and the Art Gal
lery will round out a college of fine arts whose
facilities are complete in every detail.
Steadily during the past decade, the Farm
has been expanding. First it was to develop
the men's and women's athletic facilities —
construction of the Stadium, Pavilion, Roble
Gymnasium. Then a '>00111 in the erection of
dormitories took place—Hranner and Lagu
nita were the results. Present development of
the fine arts follows closely 011 the heels of
the dormitory epidemic.
Clearly, the Administration is in the midst
of a building boom that is much more vast
than the mere erection of each structure,
latest of which is an outdoor theater. What
next? is the natural question. Heading the
list of still-needed departments seems to be
a School of Aviation; Administration eyes
may turn in this direction next.

ing to the future —Stanford builds.

latest of which is an outdoor theater. What
next? is the natural question. Heading the
list of still-needed departments seems to be
a School of Aviation; Administration eyes
may turn in this direction next.
Ambitious to broaden her scope and point
ing to the future —Stanford builds.
Last quarter, the greatest construction
project since the building of the original Quad
was launched on the Farm; now, less than
two months later, Comptroller Almon E. Roth
takes away the campus' breath by announcing
complete plans for an expansion program that
makes heretofore Utopian dreams of broad
ening Stanford's cultural facilities virtually
certain to be fulfilled.
The immense amphitheater will be the third
portion of the Administration's gigantic five
point art program. The already-established
Art Gallery and Memorial Hall, now under
construction, are the lirst two sections of the
cultural unit. Proposed Graphic Arts and
Music buildings will complete the plans.
This elaborate expansion move will take
considerable time. Details of linancing will
necessitate a delay in fitting the graphic arts
and music structures into this art program,
and the cultural set-up will be incomplete
until endowments for these two buildings are
secured.
The new amphitheater, which bears a finan
cial "if" totaling $30,000 to .$40,000, blends
nicely into the new picture to which the Uni
versity may now look forward. Starting this
theater without completing financial arrange
ments was an innovation in policy, occasioned
by the fact that the "deal was too good to

pass up."
Ten, possibly only five, years from now this
entire unit will be complete—the outdoor
theater will be beautified by the natural effect
that only growing trees and shrubbery can
give it; Memorial Hall will be caring for an
increased interest in drama; the Music and
Graphic Arts buildings will be satisfying a
long-clainored-for demand, and the Art Gal
lery will round out a college of fine arts whose
facilities are complete in every detail.
Steadily during the past decade, the Farm
has been expanding. First it was to develop
the men's and women's athletic facilities —
construction of the Stadium, Pavilion, Roble
Gymnasium. Then a '>00111 in the erection of
dormitories took place—Hranner and Lagu
nita were the results. Present development of
the fine arts follows closely 011 the heels of
the dormitory epidemic.
Clearly, the Administration is in the midst
of a building boom that is much more vast
than the mere erection of each structure,
latest of which is an outdoor theater. What
next? is the natural question. Heading the
list of still-needed departments seems to be
