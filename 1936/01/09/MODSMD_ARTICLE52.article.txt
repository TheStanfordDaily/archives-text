# What To Do With Bookstore Rebates? – – Columns Thrown Open for Discussion
## 
### 
Surprised indeed were Ex Committeemen
at this week's meeting when Bookstore's
Hoard of Directors marched in, announced
themselves as amenable to suggestions as to
disposition of expected profits. Ex Commit
tee, used to answering requests for funds, was
momentarily taken aback as to how to spend
them.
Soon, however, it decided to submit the
leading plans developed between now and
then to the general A.S.S.U. election in Feb
ruary. To the Daily was assigned the task of
informing the students as to the problem, and
through Vox Cumpi, disseminating their sug
gestions.
Today the lirst campus voices were raised.
In the nearby column, one gentleman sug
gests that the Bookstore clean house first,
worry about profits later; another makes a

plea for the old rebate system. A third con
tributor has made some rather pertinent sug
gestions about lower Bookstore prices; space
limits forced the holding of his letter until
tomorrow.
Leading plans mentioned in Ex Committee
meeting include: a circulating library of nov
els for student use; a direct grant to student
aid funds; retention of the old rebate system.
Add to this the suggestion for internal econo
mies in the Bookstore and four possibilities
have arisen to date.
The Vox 'Campi columns arc wide open,
gentlemen. Further suggestions or comments
and elaborations on those already put forth
are welcomed. Possibly these columns, too,
will be able to join in the pondering of possi
bilities in an effort to further intelligent bal
loting in February.
