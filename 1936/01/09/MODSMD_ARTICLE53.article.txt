# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
The sororities have been gonging up on their tuning
forks of late, whipping into shape the songs they
arc to sing in rushing. The hashers are losing on
the deal. It gives them two Hell Weeks instead of
one. They'll have to go through the whole business
of waiting around with their fingers in their ears
again when hunting season opens Monday.
The songs go something like this:
P.D.Q. SORORITY SONG
We love thee truly, P.D.Q.
Life with its sorrows,
And we'll pledge you too,
We hate the Kappas,
The D.G.'s, Chi O's, Thetas,
Tri Delt's, Pi Phi's, Alpha O's,
Alpha Phi's, Gamma Phi Betas.
Second Verse
Please pledge our tong, dear, our sorority
Life with its sorrows,
Is an ecstasy.
You can have the scholarship cup
Turn, dc, turn, dc turn, turn
And the pretty, brass pin, dear
But as for me, please pass the duck.
Memorize these words, dear, and you can sing the
song right along with the girls and surprise them.
Won't that be nice?
Of course this business of running the two rat
races simultaneously next week, won't make any dif
ference to the fraternity men who hash at sorority
houses. Why, they'll ust bring the freshman men with
them over to the sorority houses and make a jolly-up
out of it.
When the Supreme Court kicked Roosevelt's AAA
out, it did not crcate the biggest economic loss among
the farmers, but among newspaper columnists, who
won't have much of anything to talk about now. It
will mean one thing, though, the pigs can live the
more abundant life.
