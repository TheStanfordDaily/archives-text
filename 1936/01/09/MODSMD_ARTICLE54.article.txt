"JUDICIAL FASCISM"
Fascism, as crushing as any thai exists in Europe,
a dictatorship saved from public knowledge and re
venge only by a blind of sanctity and custom, rules
these United States.
You can lake that statement straight from Ray
mond Clapper, veteran Washington newshawk, whose
resounding damnation of the Supreme Court and its
repudiation of the AAA is today probably the cream
in American farmers' intellectual coffee.
But being a thinktr as well as a columnist, Mr.
Clapper not only blames the Supreme Court for the
present plight of recovery, but also suggests a way
out: strict limitation of the court's powers, and legal
equality between congressional mandates and court ul
timatums.
♦ * * •
What Mr. Clapper neglects to say is probably what
his boss told him not to say: that the trouble is not
with the Supreme Court but the Constitution. Be
hind his excoriation of the individual justices, behind
his statement that the Supreme Court is political, is
the question of whether a system of laws that was
efficient in 1789 is efficient in 1935. More generally,

it is a question of whether the individual liberty of
147 years ago makes for the greatest good of the
greatest number todajy.
Many political thinkers, whose opinion intelligent
people at least privately value, would like to see gov
ernment control where government control is needed.
They believe that a manufacturer or farmer whose
actions contribute to a depression is just as much a
criminal as one who steals, and they would propose
a criminal code for the entrepreneur just as specific
and unalterable in its provisions as that for a sneak
thief.
The fact that such a code would be unconstitutional
does not in the slightest change the obvious need for
it, and the obvious thing to do about this need is to
resurrect the "greatest good" clause, and compare the
constitution point for point against this statement and
its implied provisions, changing the law of the land
where it should be changed.
He * * #
Which brings us back to the realization that the
justices of the Supreme Court cannot be blamed for
refusing the New Deal's alphabetical soup. Their job
is to determine whether or not laws observe consti
tutional limitations, not to pass or reject laws accord
ing to actual expediency.
The justices have done this job well. Our job is
not to throw them out because of their efficiency, to
criticize them, or to burn them in effigy, but to make
it possible for them to act as necessity dictates. Our
job is to change the law, not the court.

Which brings us back to the realization that the
justices of the Supreme Court cannot be blamed for
refusing the New Deal's alphabetical soup. Their job
is to determine whether or not laws observe consti
tutional limitations, not to pass or reject laws accord
ing to actual expediency.
The justices have done this job well. Our job is
not to throw them out because of their efficiency, to
criticize them, or to burn them in effigy, but to make
it possible for them to act as necessity dictates. Our
job is to change the law, not the court.

"JUDICIAL FASCISM"
Fascism, as crushing as any thai exists in Europe,
a dictatorship saved from public knowledge and re
venge only by a blind of sanctity and custom, rules
these United States.
You can lake that statement straight from Ray
mond Clapper, veteran Washington newshawk, whose
resounding damnation of the Supreme Court and its
repudiation of the AAA is today probably the cream
in American farmers' intellectual coffee.
But being a thinktr as well as a columnist, Mr.
Clapper not only blames the Supreme Court for the
present plight of recovery, but also suggests a way
out: strict limitation of the court's powers, and legal
equality between congressional mandates and court ul
timatums.
♦ * * •
What Mr. Clapper neglects to say is probably what
his boss told him not to say: that the trouble is not
with the Supreme Court but the Constitution. Be
hind his excoriation of the individual justices, behind
his statement that the Supreme Court is political, is
the question of whether a system of laws that was
efficient in 1789 is efficient in 1935. More generally,

it is a question of whether the individual liberty of
147 years ago makes for the greatest good of the
greatest number todajy.
Many political thinkers, whose opinion intelligent
people at least privately value, would like to see gov
ernment control where government control is needed.
They believe that a manufacturer or farmer whose
actions contribute to a depression is just as much a
criminal as one who steals, and they would propose
a criminal code for the entrepreneur just as specific
and unalterable in its provisions as that for a sneak
thief.
The fact that such a code would be unconstitutional
does not in the slightest change the obvious need for
it, and the obvious thing to do about this need is to
resurrect the "greatest good" clause, and compare the
constitution point for point against this statement and
its implied provisions, changing the law of the land
where it should be changed.
