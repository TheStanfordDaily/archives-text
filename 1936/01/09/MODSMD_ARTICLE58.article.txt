# SENSING A STEAM ROLLER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Could it be that 1 sense a bit of
steam-rollering in Ex Committee's
resolve to submit the disposal of
the Bookstore's profits to student
ballot? In such cases, maybe Ful
lenwider is right in asking, "Do
elections mean anything?"
Although Professor Lesley's work
on the Bookstore Board is not to
be deprecated, it was not long ago
that his worries were toward reduc
ing the red in the Bookstore fig
ures, rather than toward disposal of
increasing profits. With the changed
financial status, let us hope the di
rectors have not overlooked the
fsct that the Bookstore could stand
internal changes.
For example, a separate, efficient
Used Text Department is sorely
needed. Other universities find such
departments popular and profitable.
I have never heard of any attempt
in the last ten years to place the
used book shelf here on an efficient
basis.
It almost seems as if purchase and
sale of used texts is being discour
aged by the Bookstore. This quar
ter, contrary to precedent, students
are not allowed to see the text-book
price schedule. Hence the student
has no way of comparing the sav
ings resulting from buying used
texts.
Obviously many students would
welcome the opportunity for savings
if used texts were readily available.
Let's have an improved Bookstore
before fastening any anchor onto
"future profits."
