# HE WANTS HIS REBATE

Tlie Editor, Sir:
Ex Committee is now confronted
with the problem of disposing of
Bookstore PROFITS, which for
three years have been of minus
quantity. I add my voice to what I
hope will be a downpour of discus
sion on the topic.
Under normal conditions, if it
charges "regular" prices, the Book
store is bound to make a profit.
Professors, University employees,

and others contribute as well as
students. These persons are en
titled to their share of the profits, if
the Bookstore is to remain non
profit in nature.
Any distribution of profits which
does not benefit all contributors
would be inequitable.
Admitting that the refund system
is impractical and expensive, this
expense is reflected in the profits
and those who share the profits pay
the bill.
Having spent from $30 to $60 a
year at the Bookstore, I did and al
ways will appreciate those small
refunds that should continue to be
paid back to the customers.
