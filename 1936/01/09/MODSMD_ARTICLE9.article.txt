# B.A.C. To Fill Grid Schedule
## 
### 
Members of Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control will convene to
night for the chief purpose of se
lecting an opponent to meet the
1936 Indian grid squad on October
17, which is at present, on open date.
B.A.C. officials have narrowed
down the list of possible contend
ers until Fresno State College and
San Jose State are the only remain
ing squads. And, according to re
ports, the San Jose Teachers will
probably be scheduled. This, how
ever, is anything but definite, the
official choice pending the board's
action in tonight's session.
