# Thornhill Favors Honor to Grayson
## 
### 
Coach Claude "Tiny" Thornhill
yesterday went on record as favor
ing The Daily's suggestion to place
Bobby Grayson's football jersey in
the B.A.C. trophy room and to with
draw number "22" from further
play.
The coach, under whom Grayson
became for two years the coun
try's outstanding fullback, approved
the proposed move as "fine." If the
Ex Committee votes to "immortal
ize" Grayson in such a way, he will
be the second Stanford football star
to be so honored. Ernie Nevers is
the only man who previously has
been honored in this manner.
