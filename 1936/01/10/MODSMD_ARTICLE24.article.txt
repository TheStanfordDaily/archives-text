# Indians Face Bruin Hoop Squad Tonight
## Cards Given Chance For Conference Crown 
### Warren Breed 
Fifteen years ago a Stanford bas
ketball team tied for the Coast
championship. That was the last
time they even got near enough to
glimpse the crown.
Tonight at 8 o'clock and again to
morrow night, the 1936 Cardinal
hoop team takes the floor with the
best chance in the past 15 years to
win that crown.
Appleby Back
Opposition is provided by a vet
eran U.C.L.A. five, a five not in
capable of beating any other team in
tiie circuit. With the return to
health of Orv Appleby, U.C.L.A.
forward with the ability to spark
plug the Bruins beyond their usual
level, John Bunn is conceding the
Westwoodmen no quarter, and will
employ his full man power tonight.
Cause for all of the current op
timism and Coast championship
talk is based on the spectacular pre
liminary season showing made by
the Cardinals in the past three
weeks.
In the seven games which they
won, they scored about twice* as
many points as did the foe. Thrice
they ran up scores of more than
70 points. Only defeats were two
close ones by a "hot" Washing
ton team, of which the high-point
man is said to have sunk 80 per
cent of his shots.
So tonight Bunn's four regulars
and one yet to be chosen will aim
for a victory and a non-stop jaunt
to the Western Seaboard champion
ship.
Guard Position Doubtful
Hank Luisetti, Howell Turner,
Art Stoefen, and Captain Dinty
Moore will assume their usual
starting roles. At left guard Bunn
will use either Bob Zonne, John
Calderwood, or Sparky Robertson.
If Robertson or Calderwood
gets the call, Zonne will be held
in reserve at center, for the tow
ering Los Angeles boy has been
practicing considerably this week
in Stoefen's position.
Leading the Uclan attack will be
Ijong John Ball, the tremendous
sharpshooting center. But Apple
by may pull a ringer stunt and out
do his larger team-mate, for he has
shown flashes of what is takes to
become a cage great.
Admission by A.S.S.U. Cards
Big Chet Freeze is Appleby's
pard at forward, and he is no lag
gard about his basketball.
Guards are Don Ashen, last year
an all-Coaster, and little Ralph Mc-
Fadden.
The game is scheduled to start at,
8 o'clock, and the admission is free
with student-body cards.
