WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (/P). â€”
Heated debate over financing meth
ods today spurred the veterans' bill
for cash payment of the bonus
toward a House vote tomorrow, with
passage almost certain.
The measure itself does not specify
where the money shall come from.
Republicans proposed using unspent
relief millions or the Treasury's
dollar stabilization fund. Democrats
suggested new currency issues.
Finance Left to Senate
As Representative Vinson of Ken
tucky, who introduced the bil'
pleaded with his colleagues not to
"confuse the issue" by quarreling
over financing, that question was

placed squarely before the Senate.
Without waiting for the House bill
to come over, Senator Thomas of
Oklahoma introduced an amend
ment which would provide optional
revenue plans.
Suggested Plans
An appropriation of $2,225,000,-
000.
Issuance of $700,000,000 in new 1
currency against "surplus" silver.
Issuance of new currency against I
"surplus" gold to provide the re
mainder needed.
Issuance of bonds to be placed in :
Federal Reserve Banks for a "serv
ice" charge, but without bearing
interest.
