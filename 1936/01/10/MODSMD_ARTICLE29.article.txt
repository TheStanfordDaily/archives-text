# Women Wage War On Ranting Roughs

### Dave Botsford 
The sexes at Stanford just can't j
seem to get along.
Since yesterday's denouncement (
of Farm women, the usually-peace- j
ful Daily office has become a local
battle-ground for the historic "Bat- \
tie between Men and Women."
Bombs from the women's side flew
thick and burst fast. It would be
unfair, the men of the staff suppose,
not to present a few of them here.
Here's what they told us:
"The so-called 'roughs' arc not
so hot either." Why?
—Because their criticism of
Stanford women is unwarranted. !
—Because they obviously DO
believe . . .
—Because they can't take a hint
not to call anymore.
—Because they expect us to
stay home while they go out with
other girls.
— Because they pay more atten
tion to the other girl on a double
date.
—Because they insist upon call
ing us "babes," "skirts," et al.
—Because they always "stooge"
for each other.

---Because ihey always argue as
to who owes who when going on a
double or triple date.
—Because 1 hoy stay in such a trite
line of chatter.
—Because they can't dance as well
as the guys at Cal.
- Because they delight in being
deliberately tactless.
—Because they imitate Tarzans
outside Roble at 3 a.m.
—Because I hey think they're
renting us for flip evening when
they take us out.
—Because they take too much
for granted.
—Because their gasoline sup
ply, unlike their "line," is insutli
cient to get home nn.
—Because they think they see
things in Mills women that they
don't see in us.
— Becau.sc they call up for dates
on a half-hour notice and arc dis
gruntled when we're unable to go.
—Because they always talk about
their ex-girls, or about the time
they really got inebriated.
—Because we're fools enough to
keep on liking them in spite of their
faults.

The sexes at Stanford just can't j
seem to get along.
Since yesterday's denouncement (
of Farm women, the usually-peace- j
ful Daily office has become a local
battle-ground for the historic "Bat- \
tie between Men and Women."
Bombs from the women's side flew
thick and burst fast. It would be
unfair, the men of the staff suppose,
not to present a few of them here.
Here's what they told us:
"The so-called 'roughs' arc not
so hot either." Why?
—Because their criticism of
Stanford women is unwarranted. !
—Because they obviously DO
believe . . .
—Because they can't take a hint
not to call anymore.
—Because they expect us to
stay home while they go out with
other girls.
— Because they pay more atten
tion to the other girl on a double
date.
—Because they insist upon call
ing us "babes," "skirts," et al.
—Because they always "stooge"
for each other.

---Because ihey always argue as
to who owes who when going on a
double or triple date.
—Because 1 hoy stay in such a trite
line of chatter.
—Because they can't dance as well
as the guys at Cal.
- Because they delight in being
deliberately tactless.
—Because they imitate Tarzans
outside Roble at 3 a.m.
—Because I hey think they're
renting us for flip evening when
they take us out.
—Because they take too much
for granted.
—Because their gasoline sup
ply, unlike their "line," is insutli
cient to get home nn.
—Because they think they see
things in Mills women that they
don't see in us.
— Becau.sc they call up for dates
on a half-hour notice and arc dis
gruntled when we're unable to go.
—Because they always talk about
their ex-girls, or about the time
they really got inebriated.
—Because we're fools enough to
keep on liking them in spite of their
faults.
