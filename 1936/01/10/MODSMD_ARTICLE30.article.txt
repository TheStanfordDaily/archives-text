# Yell Tryouts On Five-Day Week
## 
### 
Assistant Yell Leader Webb Jones
announced last night that starting
today there will be a meeting of the
tryoutees for next year's assistant
yell leading jobs every school day
afternoon at 1:15 o'clock in the Pa
vilion. They will be headed alter
nately by Jones and by Talbot Shel
ton.
Both Jones and Shelton join in
asking more tryoutees to come out
for the position. Sheldon said that
the best way for those who have
been dissatisfied with the cheering
sections this year to help improve
them is to get the outstanding men
on the campus to come out and try
for the yell leading positions.
