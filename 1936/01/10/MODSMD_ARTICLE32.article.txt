# Bookstore Profits May Contribute to Amphitheater Cost
## Roth Is Searching for Funds from All Sources 
### Annalee Whitmore 
With the announcement that the
Bookstore was trying to dispose of
profits, previously returned as re
bates, and that an as-yet-unpaid-for
outdoor theater was under construc
tion, a possibility was seen that the
funds might go toward building the
amphitheater.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth,
when asked if the profits could be
used to aid in payment of the the
ater, said emphatically, "Yes â€”
we're looking for money from any
source."
The opportunity to receive free
of charge 30,000 cubic yards of earth
from the Palo Alto subway excava
tion was too good to miss, explained
Roth. Dirt has been hauled from
the main theater site for the last
week. Trucking from Palo Alto will
start within the next few days.
Construction of the amphitheater,
he explained, must wait until suffi
cient funds are at hand to build.
Store Profits Welcome
If the bookstore profits could be
obtained they would probably be
welcome, he considered. "Of course,"
he explained, "final decision would
be up to the Board of Trustees."
The Board of Directors of the
Bookstore, at Tuesday night's Ex
Committee meeting, determined to
call a student body vote. This was
to aid in their decision as to how to
dispose of profits. The rebate sys
tem, they explained, was too un
wieldy and expensive to be prac
tical, and yielded only a small
amount to each student.

The balloting was tentatively
set for February, at the same time
as student body elections. The
board will not necessarily fol
low the student body vote, ex
plained Chairman Everett Lesley.
They merely want a clean-cut ex
pression of student opinion. "If
students proposed to pay for the
amphitheater by means of the
profits, we would probably be
very willing to be guided by their
decision," he said.

Lesley is not even sure that the
board can turn over the profits to
some outside use. The by-laws, he
says, state that the board may re
fund profits in the form of rebates
to students. No other provision is
made.
Brooke Against Plan
Wally Brooke, president of the
student body, definitely thinks that
the funds should not go to the the
ater. Mln the first placc," said
Brooke, "the store is co-operative,
and all profits should go back as
directly as possible to the students,
even if the rebate system is im
possible.
"If the theater were paid for with
this money, the amount each student
would get from it would be quite
small. The theater could probably
be paid for some other way. A cir
culating library or scholarship would
go back more directly to the stu
dents, and funds for them would
probably not come from any other
source."
Brooke agreed with Comptroller
Roth in thinking that the necessary
$50,000 to pay for the amphitheater
could well come from a private
source. "It's such a good chance to
build so much for so little," they
explained. "All the facilities of the
main theater will be available to
the amphitheater."
