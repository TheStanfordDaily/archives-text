# Dean Jackson To Speak Monday
## 
### 
How far along the road to recov
ery did we come in 1935, and what
are the prospects for business in
the first two quarters of 1936? These
are questions that Dean Hugh
Jackson, of the Graduate School of
Business, will discuss in a talk on
"Business in Retrospect and Pros
pect" over the Stanford Radio Hour
Monday evening at 8 o'clock on sta
tion KGO.
Dean Jackson, a close student of
business conditions, has carefully
surveyed year-end reports in prep
aration for his talk, and will ana
lyze the chief factors in business as
they now appear on the economic
horizon.
