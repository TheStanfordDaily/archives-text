## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 OP).â€” I The
Democratic National Committee
late today selected Philadelphia for
the convention to begin June 23.
The selection was thrown into
doubt by formal bids of $201,000
from San Francisco, $200,000 from
Philadelphia, and $150,000 from
Chicago. There were informal of
fers of $15,000 more apiece from the
first two.
Chicago, which earlier was re
ported to have the inside track, ap
parently had lost ground by the size
of the rival bids.
