# Frosh Face Galileo Cagers Tonight
## Contest With Lions Opens Home Season For Papoose Five Bradshaw Quintet To Meet Palo Alto High Courtmen Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. 
### 
Playing its first home game of the season, Jimmy Bradshaw's fresh
man basketball quintet meets Galileo High School in the Pavilion at
o'clock tonight. Palo Alto High will engage the frosh at the same time
! tomorrow evening. Both tussles will he preliminaries to the varsity
| U.C.L.A. games.
According to a letter sent Bradshaw by Tommy deNike, Galileo coach,
i the visitors have three capable cagers in Hale, Dillon, and Passaglia, a

high-scoring junior. The Lions are j
considered by their coach to be ;
stronger than Ust year, when they j
finished fairly well up in city
standings.
Paly High should provide less |
competition for the Indian five to- i
morrow night. The home town j
preps have lost most of their games. |
Mountain View defeated them by 3 j
points, and Balboa, favorite in the
city league, also took their measure, j
For the third straight day, the â– 
Cardinal Babes concentrated on de
fense yesterday. Bradshaw ran his {
first and second, teams through a ;
series of plays and, toward the end i
of the session, the regulars prac- J
ticed free-throw shooting and then !
drilled on tip-off plays, passing and
dribbling under the basket for set- j
ups.
The tip-off work was in prep- i
aration for possible use of the j
center jump. Some of the first
year team's opponents, especially I
high school outfits, still may use
this old method of putting the
hall in play after baskets.
No changes in the first team have ;
been made as yet. Jack Kessell I
was back with the regulars yester- j
day, and Bob Brooke, his substitute j
forward, worked out with the sec
ond string. Brooke's team-mates in
clude Russ Fisher, forward; Byron
West, center; and Nelson and de-
Witt, guards.
Stanford's probable starting line
up is as follows: Kessell and Lyman
Calkins, forwards; Phil Zonne, cen
ter; and Pete McArthur and Diek
Neeley, guards.
