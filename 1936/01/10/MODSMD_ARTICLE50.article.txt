JOHN BUNN TO WITHHOLD
FIRST-STRING FORWARD HOW
ELL TURNER FROM LINE-UP
AFTER UCLA GAMES—that is, if
he doesn't pay Ken Bell the two
bits he owes him. At least that's
what Bunn announced last night.
Of course, it's all in fun, but it's
a pretty g»M>d story and worth
telling. So here goes.
It all started a year ago when
Stanford's basketball squad made a
barnstorming tour of the East. Dur
ing the whole time Ken Bell had
trouble with "colds." They literally
moved him from one hospital to the
next.
It was a tough grind for Ken but
he didn't want to come home so they
kept nursing him from place to
place. Of course he couldn't do
much playing, but there was always
the hope that he'd get over it be
fore the next game.
Well, anyway, during that time
he was named ""Doc" Bell and
before the gang finally pulled
back into the Paly station, Bell
had taken an awful ribbing. Then
they forgot about it till this sea
son.
Just before the team left for
Washington on last Christmas Day,
Turner bet Ken that he'd have a
"cold" before they got back. They
set the stakes at 25 coppers.

HIS ATOMIZER
WAS OVERWORKED

Every night during the five-day
jaunt "Doc" took special precau
tions not to let the old flu get him.
First of all, there was his trusty
atomizer—he almost wore it out.
Over his pajamas he'd wear a
massive sweatshirt with "Pomona"
blazed across the front. And sweat
pants, of course.
To make a long story short, he
made it.
But now Turner won't pay him.
So Bunn says he'll help Ken get
the two-bits —that Howell better
pay if he wants to play. —Frost

the hope that he'd get over it be
fore the next game.
Well, anyway, during that time
he was named ""Doc" Bell and
before the gang finally pulled
back into the Paly station, Bell
had taken an awful ribbing. Then
they forgot about it till this sea
son.
Just before the team left for
Washington on last Christmas Day,
Turner bet Ken that he'd have a
"cold" before they got back. They
set the stakes at 25 coppers.

HIS ATOMIZER
WAS OVERWORKED

Every night during the five-day
jaunt "Doc" took special precau
tions not to let the old flu get him.
First of all, there was his trusty
atomizer—he almost wore it out.
Over his pajamas he'd wear a
massive sweatshirt with "Pomona"
blazed across the front. And sweat
pants, of course.
To make a long story short, he
made it.
But now Turner won't pay him.
So Bunn says he'll help Ken get
the two-bits —that Howell better
pay if he wants to play. —Frost
