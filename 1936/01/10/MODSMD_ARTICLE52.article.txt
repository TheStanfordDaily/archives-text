Do Stanford students care about national
jiolities?
Apparently not. For while the pool-halls,
barber shops, front parlors, and business
houses of the country resound with discussion
of the AAA's demise, the Supreme Court, the
Constitution, the New Deal, the coming cam
paign, the bonus, and the Townsend Plan,
conversation among Farm students centers
around rushing, "pipe" courses, and the ster
ile heiress.
The two-sided issue now being drawn up
us an issue in the coming November election
seems to rullle the student not a whit. Few
students are even aware of the issue of adher
ing to Ihe Constitution or junking il as an
outmoded document of a past era, much less
possessed of an opinion on the topic. Fewer
still have any feelings as to whether the Su
preme Court's right to review legislation is a
valuable check or a positive menace.
Let us look beneath the obvious point that
the older generation so often makes —that the
country is going to the dogs if its youth
doesn't take interest in its political future—
and see some of the possible reasons for this
marked student apathy, which contrasts so
sharply with student rebellions and political
uprisings in other lands.
First explanation to come to mind is that
the average college student is too fed lip on
class routine and having facts pounded at
him to he interested in filling his brain with
external though important controversies. He

must assimilate and work over the informa
tion presented him in classes and the work
assigned to him outside. Further, political
hull sessions, although they may furnish re
laxation to the working man, furnish none
to him.
Secondly, there may he the simple but con
vincing reason that he is but young and has
no liking for saddling himself with the wor
ries of the world as long as he is in a position
to dodge them.
Or possibly he can be created with another
and deeper reason. There is just a faint out
side chance that he has come to the conclu
sion that politics is a bunch of hooey and that
the future of the country will eventually he
built along other lines.
So, despite the sizable block of votes that
college students possess and inlluence, the
politicians will notice and address the colleges
scarcely at all in the busy months to come.
College dailies such as this will probably he
forced to devote their columns mainly to
sports, announcements, features, and local
"gulf." For it they turn to national news
stories, their readers will proclaim them
"dead" and dull. Maybe they would be right.
But does the fact that supposedly thinking
and upper-crust collegians care not at all for
the presumably important national political
issues prove that this nation is on a downhill
slide? Not of necessity. For thousands of
years oldsters have predicted that the incom
petence of the youngsters would ruin the
world. It hasn't yet—quite.

still have any feelings as to whether the Su
preme Court's right to review legislation is a
valuable check or a positive menace.
Let us look beneath the obvious point that
the older generation so often makes —that the
country is going to the dogs if its youth
doesn't take interest in its political future—
and see some of the possible reasons for this
marked student apathy, which contrasts so
sharply with student rebellions and political
uprisings in other lands.
First explanation to come to mind is that
the average college student is too fed lip on
class routine and having facts pounded at
him to he interested in filling his brain with
external though important controversies. He

must assimilate and work over the informa
tion presented him in classes and the work
assigned to him outside. Further, political
hull sessions, although they may furnish re
laxation to the working man, furnish none
to him.
Secondly, there may he the simple but con
vincing reason that he is but young and has
no liking for saddling himself with the wor
ries of the world as long as he is in a position
to dodge them.
Or possibly he can be created with another
and deeper reason. There is just a faint out
side chance that he has come to the conclu
sion that politics is a bunch of hooey and that
the future of the country will eventually he
built along other lines.
So, despite the sizable block of votes that
college students possess and inlluence, the
politicians will notice and address the colleges
scarcely at all in the busy months to come.
College dailies such as this will probably he
forced to devote their columns mainly to
sports, announcements, features, and local
"gulf." For it they turn to national news
stories, their readers will proclaim them
"dead" and dull. Maybe they would be right.
But does the fact that supposedly thinking
and upper-crust collegians care not at all for
the presumably important national political
issues prove that this nation is on a downhill
slide? Not of necessity. For thousands of
years oldsters have predicted that the incom
petence of the youngsters would ruin the
world. It hasn't yet—quite.
Do Stanford students care about national
jiolities?
Apparently not. For while the pool-halls,
barber shops, front parlors, and business
houses of the country resound with discussion
of the AAA's demise, the Supreme Court, the
Constitution, the New Deal, the coming cam
paign, the bonus, and the Townsend Plan,
conversation among Farm students centers
around rushing, "pipe" courses, and the ster
ile heiress.
The two-sided issue now being drawn up
us an issue in the coming November election
seems to rullle the student not a whit. Few
students are even aware of the issue of adher
ing to Ihe Constitution or junking il as an
outmoded document of a past era, much less
possessed of an opinion on the topic. Fewer
still have any feelings as to whether the Su
preme Court's right to review legislation is a
valuable check or a positive menace.
