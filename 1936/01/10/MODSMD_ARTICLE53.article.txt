Stanford gets its lirsl look at Coach John
Bunn's basketball team in the Pavilion to
night as the Indians open conference i>lay
against U.C.L.A.
This year's lanky crop of hardwood aces
has completed an entirely successful practice
season and goes into the Conference race with
as many potentialities as any other quintet
in Stanford history.
Non-league games to date have indicated
that finally the Indians may gel their chance
at the long-coveted Southern Division cham
pionship; they have quantities of speed and
have developed a remarkable accuracy that
has stamped them as a powerful oll'ensive
team.
Bunn has gradually been building a system
to lit the Western style of basketball, and it
has been finally paired with a wealth of mate
rial. He has reason to be optimistic over the
Indians' chances this year—despite the fact
that they have been known in the past to start
nearly as well as thcv have this season, only
to fade away before closing spurts by Cali
fornia or IJ.S.C.
At the outset, this race seems to be the one
for which Bunn has been saving up.
