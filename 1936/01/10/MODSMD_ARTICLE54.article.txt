THESE 'BRILLIANT' ENGINEERS
The panacea magnificent . . . the remedy for all
social ailments . . . the cure-all that will transform
a tinny world into an alchemistic golden Utopia . . .
has been found . . . and right here at home ... at
Stanford ... by a humble engineering student.
rj! * * *
All hail Utopia! Beat your entombed brows in
shame, Plato, Dante, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke,
Montesquieu, and Bentham! Your dreams, your
schemes for the perfect society are put into shadow
by the plan of a twentieth century student of tech
nology who laughed loud and sneeringly when he was
told that social lag was inevitable, and forthwith
solved all with a thump and an oath for emphasis.
* * * *
Into an innocent conversation the remark was in
jected that engineers and scientists should not con
sider themselves so all-fired superior to social scien
tists since the latter had to deal with the most variable
of factors—human beings, while the former had in
animate, unchanging facts and materials with which
to work. The engineering student, now in graduate
school, jeered, claimed that technologists had been
and are definitely superior to those who mold econom
ics and government.
* * * *
"A panacea?" he exclaimed. "Sure. Let a board of
competents set up standard specifications for good
human beings at various ages and put everybody to
test. Those who don't meet the requirements shall be
lined up against a wall and mowed down with a ma
chine gun. That would eliminate dependents, crip
ples, morons, criminals, and the over-population
problem all in one swipe. They could bury the dead in
a big hole. Then in a few years the world would be
made up of a superior race of men who could keep
the world out of depressions."
# * ♦ *
Isn't that neat? A graduate engineering student
said it in all seriousness. His kind developed ma
chines that robbed men of the right to labor and pro
duced faster than civilization could consume. And he
would apply his efficient slide-rule formulas to hu
man souls and blast those who are helpless and be
wildered in a dizzy machine age from the face of the
earth. He could probably invent an effective, prac
tical gun that could hill off a hundred undesirables
with one shot.
♦ » * *
The department of engineering is to be congrau-
Jated upon turning out a student with such a broad
understanding, such tolerance for the weaknesses of
others, such ingenuity, and such mature belief in the
infallibility of the scientific method.
If, however, very many of the engineering students
are like the hero of this tale and make a practice of
displaying their naive pedantry, Dean Hoover should
have cause to wonder about his charges.

The department of engineering is to be congrau-
Jated upon turning out a student with such a broad
understanding, such tolerance for the weaknesses of
others, such ingenuity, and such mature belief in the
infallibility of the scientific method.
If, however, very many of the engineering students

THESE 'BRILLIANT' ENGINEERS
The panacea magnificent . . . the remedy for all
social ailments . . . the cure-all that will transform
a tinny world into an alchemistic golden Utopia . . .
has been found . . . and right here at home ... at
Stanford ... by a humble engineering student.

All hail Utopia! Beat your entombed brows in
shame, Plato, Dante, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke,
Montesquieu, and Bentham! Your dreams, your
schemes for the perfect society are put into shadow
by the plan of a twentieth century student of tech
nology who laughed loud and sneeringly when he was
told that social lag was inevitable, and forthwith
solved all with a thump and an oath for emphasis.

Into an innocent conversation the remark was in
jected that engineers and scientists should not con
sider themselves so all-fired superior to social scien
tists since the latter had to deal with the most variable
of factors—human beings, while the former had in
animate, unchanging facts and materials with which
to work. The engineering student, now in graduate
school, jeered, claimed that technologists had been
and are definitely superior to those who mold econom
ics and government.
* * * *
"A panacea?" he exclaimed. "Sure. Let a board of
competents set up standard specifications for good
human beings at various ages and put everybody to
test. Those who don't meet the requirements shall be
lined up against a wall and mowed down with a ma
chine gun. That would eliminate dependents, crip
ples, morons, criminals, and the over-population
problem all in one swipe. They could bury the dead in
a big hole. Then in a few years the world would be
made up of a superior race of men who could keep
the world out of depressions."
# * ♦ *
Isn't that neat? A graduate engineering student
said it in all seriousness. His kind developed ma
chines that robbed men of the right to labor and pro
duced faster than civilization could consume. And he
would apply his efficient slide-rule formulas to hu
man souls and blast those who are helpless and be
wildered in a dizzy machine age from the face of the
earth. He could probably invent an effective, prac
tical gun that could hill off a hundred undesirables
with one shot.
