A Lagunita resident scored again when s)ie pre
sented her gentleman friend, a Chi Psi lodger, a car
heater for Christmas. It's not the money, but the
thought behind the gift that counts.
We have not yet discovered a good use for old
razor blades, but one Row man solved the over
crowding problem on fraternity bookshelves. He
grabbed up all the historic old tomes, which had been
in the family for years, and trundled them down 10 a
Paly bookstore, where he got five dollars for his
pains. The enterprising entrepreneur did not turn the
receipts, but pocketed the cash as "wages of manage
ment."
Begging your pardon in advance, Our Hasher has
a scheme worked out that will settle this Bookstore
rebate problem once and for all. Since it is the pro
fessors who write the new texts every quarter that are
sold to the students for money, which goes to the
Bookstore, it is the suggestion of Our Hasher, that
the Ex Committee cut the meloh this way:
1. One-half goes to Ex Committee members (this
comes under the advertising and promotion budget).
2. The other half is divided among the professors
who write the texts in direct ratio to how many and
how expensive books they write.
Now the merits of this plan do not appear upon the
surface. You see, by paying a bonus to the prof who
writes a new text every quarter, you encourage the
prof to write every quarter, you encourage the prof
to write newer and newer texts, until eventually they
may get to writing tow texts per quarter.
Every time they sell a new book that means more
money for the Bookstore and more money for the
professors and more money for Ex Committee. This
thing can go on forever. Even you can see that.
With the increase in circulation of money, of course,
prices will rise. Capital will come out of the sock, the
marginal entrepreneur can wash his socks, and the
fixed factor will be soaked onto the variable factor,
and God is love. This means prosperity, even Arthur
Brisbane knows that.
The idea of this should spread like wildfire all
over the country. It's got more stuff than the sol
dier's bonus or the Townsend Plan. This means pros
perity for you, and you, and you, and your children,
all of them. We shall name it the Old Ache Revolv
ing two pairs of Pension with every suit. Send in
your ten bucks right now, and we'll give you a fancy
lithographed Charter signifying you have started a
club with 25 members. We can arrange the matter
of dues at your earliest possible convenience.

marginal entrepreneur can wash his socks, and the
fixed factor will be soaked onto the variable factor,
and God is love. This means prosperity, even Arthur
Brisbane knows that.
The idea of this should spread like wildfire all
over the country. It's got more stuff than the sol
dier's bonus or the Townsend Plan. This means pros
perity for you, and you, and you, and your children,
all of them. We shall name it the Old Ache Revolv
ing two pairs of Pension with every suit. Send in
your ten bucks right now, and we'll give you a fancy
lithographed Charter signifying you have started a

of dues at your earliest possible convenience.
A Lagunita resident scored again when s)ie pre
sented her gentleman friend, a Chi Psi lodger, a car
heater for Christmas. It's not the money, but the
thought behind the gift that counts.
We have not yet discovered a good use for old
razor blades, but one Row man solved the over
crowding problem on fraternity bookshelves. He
grabbed up all the historic old tomes, which had been
in the family for years, and trundled them down 10 a
Paly bookstore, where he got five dollars for his
pains. The enterprising entrepreneur did not turn the
receipts, but pocketed the cash as "wages of manage
ment."
Begging your pardon in advance, Our Hasher has
a scheme worked out that will settle this Bookstore
rebate problem once and for all. Since it is the pro
fessors who write the new texts every quarter that are
sold to the students for money, which goes to the
Bookstore, it is the suggestion of Our Hasher, that
the Ex Committee cut the meloh this way:
1. One-half goes to Ex Committee members (this
comes under the advertising and promotion budget).
2. The other half is divided among the professors
who write the texts in direct ratio to how many and
how expensive books they write.
Now the merits of this plan do not appear upon the
surface. You see, by paying a bonus to the prof who
writes a new text every quarter, you encourage the
prof to write every quarter, you encourage the prof
to write newer and newer texts, until eventually they
may get to writing tow texts per quarter.
Every time they sell a new book that means more
money for the Bookstore and more money for the
professors and more money for Ex Committee. This
thing can go on forever. Even you can see that.
With the increase in circulation of money, of course,
prices will rise. Capital will come out of the sock, the
marginal entrepreneur can wash his socks, and the
fixed factor will be soaked onto the variable factor,
and God is love. This means prosperity, even Arthur
Brisbane knows that.
