"CUSTOMARY IGNORANCE"

The Editor, Sir:
In light of the recent talk about
vanishing Stanford traditions, it
may be comforting to note that one
age-old tradition is still with usâ€”
the customary ignorance of Daily re
porters who review musical per
formances.
The absence of powerful voices in
Wednesday's concert was deplored.
If the reviewer went to listen to
another Schipa, no wonder he was
disappointed, for it is well known
that children's voices produce but a
fourth of the volume of adult ones.
Considering the performers' age,
it should be genei'ally agreed that
their technique was quite faultless.
If the reviewer will look back to
his own eight or ten-year-old days,
he will discover that he was not the
world's greatest journalist, either.
