# JAZZ, SHE IS GOOD NOISE

The Editor, Sir:
St) jazz is "suffocating and tortu
ous," is it?
Ever since one of the Daily's lady
critics went to hear the Symphony
and then suggested in her review
that the brass should be eliminated
from Sibelius' "Finlandia," the Daily
has been burdened with more than
its share of half-baked critics. And
now Phil Bernheim—of all people
— quoting a German newspaper
man, smears the back page of the
Daily with a lot of second-hand
nonsense about the horrors of jazz.
Firstly, if Mr. Bernheim is inter
ested in what Europe thinks of jazz,
he should remember that competent
European critics recognize jazz as
the only truly original contribution
America has given to the world's
music.
Bernheim (to hell with this "mis
ter" business) ought to read Con
stance Lambert's knowing book
about modern symphonic music,
"Music Ho!" where the statement is
made that all the ingenuity of the
moderns (Stravinsky and the rest)
cannot equal a dozen arresting mo
ments in Duke Ellington's works.
The trouble with the German gen
tleman whom Bernheim quotes is
that he knows even less about the
subject than the Daily review edi
tor.
Listen, Phil, this screaming from
the pulpit about demon jazz is old
stuff. Suppose you listen to some
authentic jazz music. Try the late
Victors by Ihe Benny Goodman trio.
Or the Columbias, especially the
one of "I Surrender, Dear," by Red
Norvo's outfit. Or the new Deccas
by Jye Venuti. Then we'll argue.
