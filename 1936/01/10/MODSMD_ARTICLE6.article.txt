# Nagel May Play For 'Doctor's Wife'
## 
### 
Negotiations were made yesterday
to obtain Freddie Nagel's orchestra
for the presentation of "The Doc
tor's Wife," to be given in the As
sembly Hall January 30. Whether
the orchestra will appear is still un
certain, although Nagel hopes to
have bis musicians contribute their
services in furthering the drive for
funds in the research of poliomyel
itis.
Contrary to the prevalent belief,
"The Doctor's Wife" is not con
cerned with poliomyelitis, infantile
paralysis, but is composed of nu
merous comic situations common to
the household of a doctor. The play
was produced once previously on the
campus, and the present perform
ance answers a long-standing de
mand for a repeat.
