# CUT THE PRICES FIRST

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Directors of the Bookstore have
raised the question of policy in dis
posing of annual profits. Bookstore,
say its directors, has built up a sur
plus, has some government bonds,
owns a building, and is in sound
condition financially. Therefore the

serious and slightly anomalous sit
uation of what to do with profits.
This group of unpaid directors
are doing a fine thing by bringing
the question before the students.
Logically we students leap to the
conclusion that a profit should be
returned as a debate. But that does
not bet to the base of the problem
We want to know why, if the Book
store is a co-operative organization,
there should be any profit.
The directors say that textbooks,
fountain pens, and typewriters can
not be sold below list without
trouble flrom the manufacturers.
Granted: but why can't prices be
reduced on supplies such as paper,
which the Bookstore buys by the
ton and sells by the pound?
The contention of the directors
that when profits are low, the ad
ministration of the rebate is pro
portionately too high is right. Then
we students are losing money.
Therefore, why not reduce prices
on certain goods, thereby benefit
ting the student at the time of sale?
If at the end of the year there is still
a profit, the Bookstore could do
nothing more humanitarian than
transfer such small profits to the
Student Aid Fund. Most of us agree
that that fund is efficiently admin
istered. H. C. T.
