The Editor, Sir:
I was one of the many apprecia
tive hearers of the Vienna Boys'
Choir in the Pavilion last night.
Judging by the copious applause
given them it would seems that
your Mr. Bernheim was the only
one present who resented the fact
that the choir didn't make enough
noise. His analogy of the string
quartet and the symphony was rath
er inept. The two are no more com
patible than Bing Crosby and John
Charles Thomas—one just doesn't
attempt to compare them.
No one expected depth and full
ncs of tone from the choir. Their
clear and bell-like tones were ab
solutely pure and unwavering. I
sat in the third row and can af
firm this. As for acting in the op
eretta —has anyone ever seen an
opera singer who could act?
