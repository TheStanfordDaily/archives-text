I "THE BRIDE COMES HOME"
At the Stanford Theater
True to the formula of "It Hap
pened One Night," "The Bride
Comes Home" is one of those too,
too sophisticated comedies about the
society girl in love with a hard
! hitting newspaperman. Unlike that
j masterpiece, however, this picture is
| so clever it hurts. The effect is no
i longer spontaneous, and, although
! the picture is still entertaining, its
witty sparkle is strained. Besides, |
j I have no patience with a girl who
j turns down Robert Young and three
j million dollars for a bullying jour- J
nalist, who docs everything but
i knock her down, even if he is Fred
! Mac Murray.
"CORONADO"
I Also at the Stanford
This trite story is saved from
complete mediocrity by the charm
of a newcomer, Johnny Downs, Ed
i die Duchin's orchestra, and the au-
I thenticity of its setting.

j "THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS:
THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS
OF SCIENCE," by C. C. Furnas;
(Reynal & Hitchcock).
To the average layman there
sometimes is something very an
noying in the smugness of the sci
entist, who looks at people wisely
I and silently, and appears to assume
i that there is no use to take the
j public into his confidence because
the public is too stupid to under
stand. PI? seems almost like a relig
ious zealot who is so sure of his
particular route to salvation that he
i refuses to discuss it.
Shows Science Status
A few writers have been clever
enough to sense the situation, and
to justify our mass inferiority by
showing that after all the scientists
do not know everything; that they
I know very little, in fact.
The latest book of that sort is
C. C. Furnas' "The Next Hundred
Years: The Unfinished Business of
Science." It is a good tonic for the
J scientist, and also for those who sit
. | goggle-eyed in the presence of our
| latest modern cure-all — meaning
; science, of course.
Dr. Furnas is now associate pro
fessor of chemical engineering at
Yale. Chemical engineering has a
; relation to most other scientific
branches, and Dr. Furnas has an
inquiring mind and a capacity for
relating diverse lines of inquiry. He
i actually includes the social sciences
i in his book; he includes even un
employment in the unfinished busi
. ; ness of science.

Needs Unsatisfied

Practical needs so far unsatisfied
by science include such simple
things as lasting newsprint, a more
nearly perfeel food container, spring
metal that does not fail through
fatigue, really permanent road sur
faces, a perfect insulator for heat.
Equally practical but less under
standable is the eternal quest for an
atom-smashing machine to release

the limitless imprisoner energy we
need.
There are many other quests
mentioned, but Dr. Furnas can list
them much more entertainingly than
this department. All the prospec
tive reader of "The Next Hundred
Years" needs to know is that its
author is delightfully skeptical, gay,
ironic and open-minded.

I "THE BRIDE COMES HOME"
At the Stanford Theater
True to the formula of "It Hap
pened One Night," "The Bride
Comes Home" is one of those too,
too sophisticated comedies about the
society girl in love with a hard
! hitting newspaperman. Unlike that
j masterpiece, however, this picture is
| so clever it hurts. The effect is no
i longer spontaneous, and, although
! the picture is still entertaining, its
witty sparkle is strained. Besides, |
j I have no patience with a girl who
j turns down Robert Young and three
j million dollars for a bullying jour- J
nalist, who docs everything but
i knock her down, even if he is Fred
! Mac Murray.
"CORONADO"
I Also at the Stanford
This trite story is saved from
complete mediocrity by the charm
of a newcomer, Johnny Downs, Ed
i die Duchin's orchestra, and the au-
I thenticity of its setting.

j "THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS:
THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS
OF SCIENCE," by C. C. Furnas;
(Reynal & Hitchcock).
To the average layman there
sometimes is something very an
noying in the smugness of the sci
entist, who looks at people wisely
I and silently, and appears to assume
i that there is no use to take the
j public into his confidence because
the public is too stupid to under
stand. PI? seems almost like a relig
ious zealot who is so sure of his
particular route to salvation that he
i refuses to discuss it.
Shows Science Status
A few writers have been clever
enough to sense the situation, and
to justify our mass inferiority by
showing that after all the scientists
do not know everything; that they
I know very little, in fact.
The latest book of that sort is
C. C. Furnas' "The Next Hundred
Years: The Unfinished Business of
Science." It is a good tonic for the
J scientist, and also for those who sit
. | goggle-eyed in the presence of our
| latest modern cure-all — meaning
; science, of course.
Dr. Furnas is now associate pro
fessor of chemical engineering at
Yale. Chemical engineering has a
; relation to most other scientific
branches, and Dr. Furnas has an
inquiring mind and a capacity for
relating diverse lines of inquiry. He
i actually includes the social sciences
i in his book; he includes even un
employment in the unfinished busi
. ; ness of science.

Needs Unsatisfied

Practical needs so far unsatisfied
by science include such simple
things as lasting newsprint, a more
nearly perfeel food container, spring
metal that does not fail through
fatigue, really permanent road sur
faces, a perfect insulator for heat.
Equally practical but less under
standable is the eternal quest for an
atom-smashing machine to release

the limitless imprisoner energy we
need.
There are many other quests
mentioned, but Dr. Furnas can list
them much more entertainingly than
this department. All the prospec
tive reader of "The Next Hundred
Years" needs to know is that its
author is delightfully skeptical, gay,
ironic and open-minded.
