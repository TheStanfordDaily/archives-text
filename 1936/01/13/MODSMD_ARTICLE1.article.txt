# Ship Grounds In Storm; 34 Believed Lost
## Coast Guard Unable To Assist Battered Vessel 
### 
ASTORIA, Ore., Jan. 12 (/I 5 ). â€”
Smashed to pieces by a southeast
hurricane, a freighter, believed to
be the lowa with 34 men aboard,
foundered off the mouth of the Co
lumbia river today. One body was
washed ashore at Sea view, Wash.
The Coast Guard held little hope
that any of the crew could be saved.
Terrific seas and a howling gale
battered the ship on the treacherous
sands.
Astoria had only intermittent
communication with the rest of
the Pacific Northwest. Telephone
and telegraph lines were down.
Wireless communication was halt
ed by distress call regulations.
Most of the information on the
distressed craft came from the
Coast Guard station at Seattle,
which intercepted reports from its
vessels.
The crew of the Coast Guard cut
ter Onondaga attempted to shoot a
line aboard the stricken freighter
but was unable to reach her. At
12:15 p.m. the Onondaga messaged
"Unable to hold her position as
heavy seas breaking in deeper wa
ter." This message concluded with
the words "No life visible aboard
vessel"
The Coast Guard said at noon
the cutter Onondaga was unable
to hold her position; that no sign
of life was visible aboard the ship,
and that all that could he seen of
the foundered freighter were the
foremast and the forecastle bul
warks.
At 11:20 a.m. the Coast Guard re
ported (he stack arid bridge had
been carried away by the roaring
seas.
The lowa is commanded by Cap
tain Edgar L. Yates and carried 34
men. She was outbound from Co
lumbia River ports to the East Coast.
There were unconfirmed reports
that another veessel, the schooner
North Star, of unidentified regis
try, was in trouble on the treach
erous Peacock Spit.
Farther south the freighters Vin
land and Rochelle messaged they
were having difficulties in high seas
off Cape Arago.
The Coast Guard said difficulty in
establishing the identity of the ves
sel believed to be the lowa came
from inability to distinguish distress
calls from the ship.
The lowa is a 410-foot craft of
3,546 net tons. She was built in 1920
as the West Cadron at San Fran
cisco.
