## Edit Page Brave Begins Campaign for Monicker 
### 
For five months now the Honest
Injun without reservation has been
dragging his toboggan through all
the wax works of the Pacific Coast
and popping up at unexpected times
on the Daily edit page.
But yesterday, he revolted:
"Me no toboggan more, ugh; you
lindum ine name, ugh."
The editors being too busy writ
ing edits to think, they decided to
hold a contest to let the populace
name him.
Today the contest starts. Go
into a strange interlude with your
self. Think up a funny name and
a good reason for it. Such as:
"Hey"—because he's out of
Barnes; or "Barnes," because he's
out of Iley (or feeling bis oats);
or S.l*.—'cause he's making
tracks; or "Union"—because in
Union food there is strength, but
no taste. Only make them funny.
Entries will be judged by a spe
cial committee consisting of the
editor, Our Hasher, and Curtis
Barnes, creator of the character.
Their decision will be decisive, com
plete, and final. If contestants sub
mitting the j,ame name and reason
win the prize, the money will be
split between them.
All students arc eligible exccpt
members of the Daily editorial or
business stalls. No strings, box
tops, empty cans are attached.
The contest closes a week from
Wednesday, so name this nameless
child and fame and fortune are
yours.
