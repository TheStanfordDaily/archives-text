# Ten Bucks Offered For Injun's Name
## 
### 
Stanford gave the Daily's editorial Injun the works—glue works, ice
works, cleaning works, wax works.
It gave him a blind date for the Rose Bowl, a toboggan to upset the
Cal Bear, a wheelbarrow for trucking away Troy's tin armor, a bowl,

► a rose, and a baby.
I But it didn't give him a name.
That's where you come in. For
i he's getting sick and tired of his un
sympathetic foster - father, Curtis
Barnes by name, who turns him out
I of the ink-bottle, puts him through
j cold engraving baths, and 5000 man
handlings a night by the Daily's
press crew.
He won't return to the campus
| without a name. Last night he sent
' us a wire (collect) from Parmisch-
Partenkirschen, where he's trying
I to crash the Winter Olympics after
j being refused admission to the or
; phan's home.
The wire read: "I AM STOP
j PED STOP ORPHAN ASYLUM
J OVERCHARGES STANFORD
MEN STOP LAKK PLACID TOO
DAMN COLD WITHOUT WARM
j CLOTHES STOP TELL CURTIS
| PLEASE EXPRESS UNDER
WEAR STOP WON'T COME
HOME WITHOUT HONEST TO
GOSH NAME STOP AND THAT'S
THAT STOP."
Now this is a dickens of a situa-
I tion for the Daily edit board, be
j cause their page looks awful with
! out a cartoon, and this artist-guy
' Barnes is helpless without the In
! jun for a model.
Furthermore, we can't call our
Injun Popoff, because that's the |
! name of that grutty Chappie's In- |
J dian, and the Daily Injun's going to j
make mincemeat out of him when
! he gets back, anyhow.
Unofficial, he's now known as
! "24'/a picas," because that's how
' big a space he fills as measured
with a printer's rule. That name
is why we're offering ten bucks
for a satisfactory handle.
Rules will be found elsewhere in ;
the paper, but it will help you to re
i member that our Injun is a to
! bogganist who upsets teams in his
way, that he likes roses and bowls,
that he always does something
- profitable with his victims, like
making glue out of them, or turn
ing them into wax figures, or
| cleaning them, or freezing them.

The population of England would
j starve in a week, it has been esti
: mated, if all outside food supply
| sources were cut off.
