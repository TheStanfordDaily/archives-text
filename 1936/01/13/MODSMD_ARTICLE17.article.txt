# Fletcher Christian Descendant Relates His Story of 'Bounty'
## 
### John McClelland 
That smouldering, unquenchable
spirit of rebellion that inspired the
real-life Fletcher Christian to lead
his comrades in violent mutiny on
the English ship Bounty 110 years
ago has not died, even to this day.
Chester Christian, great-great
grandson of the mutineer, famed
in history, literature, and motion
picture, lives today in San Fran
cisco and he is rebellious — not
against the cruel tyrany of sea
law, like his ancestor, but against
what he calls "hard, grasping
civilization." And when summer
comes Chester Christian will do
in effect just what Fletcher Chris
tian did. He will leave that which
is distasteful to him behind and
return to the south seas home of
his forefathers—to the kind of
life four generations of the Chris
tian family have preferred to life
in modern nations.
A young man with the appear
ance of a Tahitian and the manner
and voice of a European. Chester
Christian was born on the island
of Raiatea, 140 miles from Tahiti.
He tells the story of Mutiny on the
Bounty, not as it is recounted in
novel or portrayed on the screen,
but as he heard it from his mother.
But he has read the story and seen
the picture, and admits thai both
are very nearly true to fact.

| "After the mutiny," he said, "the !
| crew of the Bounty lived at Tahiti
j until fear of being found drove them j
! to Pitcairn, 1800 miles away. At
I that time my great-great grand-
I father was 24 years old. They
| burned the ship and settled down
| to a mild and almost lawless ex
-1 istence. One of the men's wives
j died, and since there was just one
j woman for each man, he had to !
| fight for another mate. That man
I shot Fletcher when he was 27 and
| took his beautiful wife, who was J
i Ihe grand-daughter of the chief of !
; Tahiti.

"Twenty years after the muti- j
nieces had settled on Pitcairn,
Roger Byam, the midshipman who
successfully defended himself I
against the charge of mutiny hack
in England, found the fugitives'
island and made the first land ■
ing since the Bounty had been
beached." (History recounts that ;
this midshipman's name was
Peter Ileywood and that he never ,
went to Pitcairn. The islanders'
story and that told hy English
historians differ in many re
spects.)
"The one thing I remember most
vividly that my mother told me was
I that the Englishmen regretted to the I
day they died the fact that they had
mutinied. Fletcher used to climb
to a high place on the island and j

[ there sit for hours on end by him
. self looking for ships. Whether he
hoped to see a sail or not, I don't
| know."
When this writer broke in upon
the tale with the remark that "If
there hadn't been a mutiny, you
wouldn't be here today," Chester
simply glanced up with a startled
look and said nothing.
Fletcher Christian had two sons.
Chester Christian's father and
mother were born on far-off deso
! late Pitcairn. Life on the island to
day is distasteful to the young Eng
lish-Tahitian, and when he returns
; to the South Seas he will go back to
j Raiatea. "Pitcairn," he says, "is the
: most religious and dull place I have
I ever seen. The law is rigid there,
and it even forbids such things as
smoking and drinking."
Chester Christian has been in
the United States for six years.
Right now he is working in a Ta
hitian cafe in the city. But he is
simply living for the day when he
i can take ship for his home—when
he can return to the warm, pleas
ant climate of the South Seas
where life is slow and easy and
abundant—when he can go hack
to the land which a dozen brow
beaten Englishmen knew was
waiting for them when they re
volted on the Bounty and put
their homes and the life of white
men forever behind them.
