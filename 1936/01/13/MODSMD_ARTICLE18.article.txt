# Indians Upset By Bruins After Winning Opener
## Hoopsters Take Friday's Game, 44-30; Drop Saturday's to Uclan Team, 37-44 
### 
One night of okeh basketball and one night of luckless mishap for the
Stanford cage team came and went over the week-end.
Friday night everything was fine. Luisetti was hitting the hoop and
passing nicely, Stoefen was flicking them in with his fingernails, Turner

was No. 1 team-man, and U.C.L.A.
wasn't too fast. Stanford won, 44-
30.
Saturday night was a near his
tory - repeats - itself version of the
U.C.L.A. football affair here last
October 12. The red-silked Indians
just couldn't make enough of
their passes or their shots good.
They had an off-night, just as the
red-jersied gridders had an olT
day three months ago. U.C.L.A.
won, 44-37.
So it will be two already-defeated
teams who play here next week-end.
California was taken twice by Troy
on Friday and Saturday nights.
That makes the Bear's barnstorm
ing trip record: about ten losses and
two wins—one by 1 point and the
other by 2 points.
But to give due credit it must be
added herein that it was a much
improved Bruin team that made
Stanford walk the plank Saturday
night.
They sank a high percentage of
their shots, such a high percent
age that they could justly he
called "hot." Then they were get
ting 80 per cent of the rebounds,
with Captain Don Ashen par
ticularly good. John Ball and Chet
Freeze were outdoing the Card
defense and sifting in for shots
they shouldn't have gotten the
chance to make.
Almost incredible was Ball's
shooting in the face of adversity,
especially his nine straight success
ful free-throws in the second
UCLAsh.
Even in the first game the
Cards were not moving down the
court and scoring in the way in
which they arc capable. But Lui
setti gave the stands enough to
show that he was all the'papers
had said about him.
He opened the scoring with a
swish from way out after four min
utes of a preliminary feeling out
process, and inside of a minute had
scored three times. Half-time score
had Stanford leading by 22-10.
Prettiest play of the week-end
was this one: Howell Turner broke
through and intercepted a Bruin
pass in mid-court after the tip-off.
He was running toward his own
goal and, without turning around,
slung a left-handed hook pass over I
hi.s shoulder straight to Luisetti, \
who, unknown to the foe, was lurk- j
ing under the basket, and who |
promptly sunk the set-up.
