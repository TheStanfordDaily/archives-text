## Louise A. Boyd To Use Slides for Illustration 
### 
Having made five expeditions into
the north herself, Miss Louise A.
Boyd is well prepared to lecture on
"The Fiord Region of East Green
land" tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Slides illustrating the lecture
have been made from Miss Boyd's
own photographs, which were
taken during the trips she has
made since 192fi when she led an
expedition to Franz Josef Land.
Two years later she took part in
the search for Amundsen.
In 1931 Miss Boyd and her party
made a photographic reconnaissance
of the eastern Greenland region,
taking thousands of photographs in
preparation for the more compre
hensive scientific explorations of
1933.
On this trip, after two attempts,
they reached the inner end of Ice
Fiord, which had never been vis
ited by a ship before.
Miss Boyd organized another
expedition in 1933 to study glacial
marginal features, particularly in
the Franz Josef and King Oscar
Fiord area. This was done with
the assistance of the American
Geographical Society of New
York, and the findings of the ex
pedition have just been pub
lished in a special American Geo
graphical Society publication.
Among the slides the speaker will
show are several of Jan Mayen Is
land, which is midway between the
coast of Norway and Northeast
Greenland, atid which is dominated
by the extinct volcano, Mt. Beeren
berg.
