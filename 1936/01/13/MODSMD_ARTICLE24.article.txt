# Bloch Rejoins Faculty After Study Abroad
## Research on Neutrons Conducted by Physicist 
### 
Felix Bloch, associate professor of
physics who took leave of absence
from Stanford last June, returned to
th* University Friday after six
months of research at the Univer
sity of Michigan and in Europe.
The physicist, a native of Swit
zerland, engaged in theoretical
work at the Institute of Technology
in Zurich and at various seience
centei; in Copenhagen, Denmark.
He taught during July at the Uni
v i :,ily of Michigan, and sailed for
Europe in August.
Professor Bloch's research was
conducted chiefly in the field deal
ing with neutrons, newly discovered
components of the atom. His work,
he said in an interview yesterday,
revolved around "artificial radio
active elements"; that is, the ray
producing effect which neutrons
have upon substances which, ordi
narily, give off no rays.
The results obtained from this
research will comprise a basis for
similar work at Stanford, Professor
Bloch said.
