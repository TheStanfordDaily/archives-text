# Post Mortem Costs Reach New Levels
## 
### R. B. Jones 
What price death? It casts money
to die. In the United States alone
there are approximately 1,500,000
deaths every year, and the funeral
expenditures amount into the ten
millions of dollars. Where does this
money go? Men die every day to
keep other men living.
When a man dies he leaves his
financial worries behind him. hut
to those left behind the worries
have just begun. Take Che aver
age case: a man expires, and his
body is sent to some mortuary
where men earn their living by
taking care gf (he dead.
The deceased is laid on a table,
;.nd if he was not attended at death,
an autopsy must be performed —
sum now approximately $51. After
this gruesome job is complete, the
cadaver is shaved ($1.50), has hair
combed (50 cents), is dressed ($1),
and then it must be treated with
Nu-lile, an alcoholic substance to
bring color back to the skin sur
face —an additional $5.
Now that the corpse is prepared
for burial, the purchase of a casket
is in order —cheapest, decent coffin
over $300. We have him prepared
for $359, but we forgot to consider
telegram expenses, floral wreath and
blanket, service costs, tombstone,
price of the real estate in which he
is to be buried, and if he desired to
be buried someplace other than
where he was at the time of death,
there is the cost of the casing, trans
portation, tips, and other additional
expenses.
If a man is lucky, he can die
today for a thousand dollars. Why,
even the train companies allow a
passenger to ride free on the
ticket for the body; the next thing
you know we'll see on the win
dow of some mortuary, "Clear
ance Sale! Two coffins for the
price of one!"
