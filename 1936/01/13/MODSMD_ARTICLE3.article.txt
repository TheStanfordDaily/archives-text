# American Student Union Mouthpiece Appears on Farm
## 
### 
"Student Opinion," long her
alded publication of the American
Student Union, made its initial
appearance on the Stanford cam
pus yesterday.
Four mimeographed l-ages dealt
with subjects including the Union
Cellar's new 25-cent plate lunches,
Hearst, war, and Fascism. No
editor or staff was admitted.
From authoritative sources, how
ever, The Daily learned that Bill
Millis, sophomore from Carmel,
penned most of the articles.
Formerly called the League for
Industrial Democracy, the Amer
ican Student Union is headed by
Celeste Strack.
