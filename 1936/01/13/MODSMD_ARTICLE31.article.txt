# Indian Rugby Men Whitewash S.F. Blues, 25-0
## Bansbach, Vigna Star In Decisive Victory After Little Practice Second Stringers Squeeze Out 3-0 Win Over Argonauts; Speed Impressive 
### 
Opening flic current rugby season with a decisive victory after only
four days of practice, Card ruggers combined team work and speed
against the San Francisco Blues to run up a score of 25-0 last Saturday
afternoon on the old frosli football field.

Second stringers had a game oM
their own with the Argonauts, and J
managed to score three points to j
win. Although lacking in team- j
work, individual performances were I
good.
The varsity's decisive win gave
promise of a better team than last |
year's. Spectators were impressed |
with the speed possessed by all of )
the 15 men. Louis Bansbacli's per- I
feet kicking was responsible for 10 j
points. Every one of his conver
sions was made good.
Captain Joe Vigna gave his j
usual stellar performance in ball ,
packing making two tries. One ;
was made after a spectacular 40- I
yard run. Peter Kump, Marve
Taylor, and liarry Golf made the ,
remaining points. Bansbach made
bis live out of live kicks.
Other outstanding players in Sat- j
ui day's game were Gift' Myers, Jerry
Peters, John Merrit, and Dick Mor- 1
risen, all veterans from last year's I
team. Zamloch turned in a good I
performance at half. Fullback posi- j
tion was remarkably well filled by '
Bob Mondavi, who looked like one j
of the most promising players on
the field, and who will probably de- i
velop into one of Coach Wylie's most :
valuable men.
A week more of hard scrimmag
ing should give the varsity time to :
whip into good condition for next |
Saturday's game with the Argo- 1
nauts.
