# Yearling Star Threatens Swim Record In Try
## Stanford Relay Squad Shatters Coast Mark 
### 
Churning his way to victory in the
100-yard breast stroke event, Dun
Towne, yearling sprint ace, came
within 1.1 seconds of equaling the
world record fox that distance as he
worked out with his team-mates in
Eneina Pools Saturday morning.
Towne's performance came as a
distinct surprise to Coach Nort
Thornton and other onlookers,
who, after hastily checking stop
watches, realized that they had
witnessed the fastest breast stroke
sprinting ever seen in the bay re
gion. The sensational freshman
clipped all of 2.2 seconds from the
local record, set by Stanford's
mighty Hobby Foster last year.
Thus, Towne becomes not only
the most promising of yearling
aquatic athletes, but also a definite
candidate for participation in the
coming Olympic Games. The mark
of 1:7.7 seconds that he hung up
Saturday, had previously never
been approached, even by varsity
mermen.
True to Thornton's expectations,
the varsity relay quartet composed
of Captain Jack Kuhn, Ilenry
Godtnan, Jack Vibcrt, and Alec
Mackenzie combined with Martin
Scatena to gain a new unofficial
Pacific Association record of
3:43.5 seconds for 400 yards. The
team chopped 3.1 seconds from the
current official mark of 3.46.6 sec
onds.
MacKenzie nosed out Scatcria by
a single tenth of a second in their
individual bids for a permanent
berth on the first string. Times for
each stage of the event were as
follows: Godman, 56.1; Vibert, 55.8;
Mackenzie, 55.7; and Scatena, 55.8;
Kuhn, 55.7.
In Saturday's back stroke drill,
Bob Walker claimcd first place;
he was pressed by Bob Ftienne.
Swimming a close third to these
varsity stars was Donald Duncan,
freshman hope. Winfield Nccd
ham, Junior National 500-yard
titleholdcr, exhibited his versa
tility by leading the frosh in the
50-yard free-style. Boh Clark and
Lomax Turner swam second and
third, respectively.
Coach Thornton was more than a
little pleased at the results cf the
week-end workouts. The showing
of his crack relay men, together with
Towne's startling exhibition, bol
stered his hopes and Stanford's
chances for Coast honors and pos
sible national recognition.
