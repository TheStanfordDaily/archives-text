# Trojans Whip Bears Twice
## Huskies, Oregon State Quintets also Triumph 
### 
While Coach John Bunn's Indian
hoop squad was being upset Satur
day night by a very talented Bruin
aggregation, Southern California's
fast-breaking quintet was busy in
Los Angeles making it two straight
triumphs over California.
The Bears, smarting under Fri
day evening's 51-2!) defeat, ral
lied successfully Saturday until
the closing seconds of the first
half, when the Trojans slipped
ahead, 15-13, on the two free
shots. The Berkeleyites, however,
faltered in the second period to
collect but three field goals and
three extra tallies on fouls.
The Trojan forces sifted through
the Bear defense in the second
half as a result of superior floor
work and mc re effective passing.
With 10 minutes to play, S.C.'s Cap
tain Hupp was barred from the
court on personal fouls. California
then rallied momentarily, bringing
the count to 30-21.
Troy, however, ran up five more
counts in short order before the final
gun sounded. Hupp and Anderson,
with 10 each, were high scorers for
Troy; Olson led the Bears with 8
points.
Also on Saturday night, Oregon
State amassed an early lead to
trounce Idaho, 45-19, and Wash
ington downed Washington State,
40-23. Both of the victors collected
their second wins over their re
spective opponents, but the Husk
ies found it necessary to stage a
terrific scoring drive before the
Cougars would bow.
Oregon State is defending cham
pion of the northern division, Pa
cific Coast conference.
