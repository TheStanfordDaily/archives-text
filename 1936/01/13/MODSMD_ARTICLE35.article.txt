THAT UCLAN JINX
AT WORK A(JA1N

When we watched a Rose Bowl
bound Stanford football team whip
ped by one point at the hands of
thoughtless Westwoodians several
weeks ago, it was hard to take.
But to have those same Bruins
come back to the Farm and up
set a conference victory-bound
basketball squad in its second
league game of the season, is al
most too much.
What is the Uclan jinx, anyway?
It strikes quickly, deftly, when
you're riding high and then it slips
away and leaves you wondering just
what happened. It evidently de
rives great pleasure from getting
under our redskins.
But more than one speculator be
lieves that the jinx is really pulling
for Stanfordâ€”at least in the football
realm. For if Bill Spalding's grid
men had not given us that scare
early in the season, it's quite prob
able that someone else, such as
Washington or Cal, would have
dumped the cart completely.
Now the same thing could he
true of basketball. That slip Sat
urday night may help in the long
run. though right now it's a tough
one to swallow.

MAYBE IT WAS
OVER CONFIDENCE

As has been said before, Stanford
lacks experience. There were five
or six excellent individual players
on the floor for the Red last week
end. But in team play they were
inexperienced, were not working
well together. .
After its first week-end of league
play, Stanford's basketball team,
still with brightest prospects of any
in years, stands with one victory and
one loss on its credit.
Under the circumstances, allow
ance can and is made for that ofT
night Saturday. Frost
