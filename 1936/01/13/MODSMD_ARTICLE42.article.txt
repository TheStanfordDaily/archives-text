## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Pay-for-Athletes Question Is Likely To Explode in American Colleges' Lap 
### 
The great American gridiron has closed
its gates for nine months, hut the nation's
coaches, students, and alumni are already
wondering "What of the future football situ
ation?"
One possibility is that the 1930 season will
see a breaking wide open of the whole ques
tion of financial aid to athletes. This problem
has been brewing for more than a decade, and
it is due for an eruption—the explosion may
come next year, or the year after, or it may die
down and never come.
Hut if there is to be any insurance against
the eruption, certain things must be done.
First, the hypocrisy of the situation must be
stamped out. Next, there must be a strictly
observed, practical code that states in clear
language t lie extent to which colleges and uni
versities may ethically go in helping their
athletes. Finally, the numerous rumors that
are making Mr. Public less and less certain
of the place athletics actually holds in Ameri
can colleges must be eradicated —that is, they
must be tracked down and either published
openly or branded as untrue.
Some groups arc already at work attempt
ing to straighten out the mess in which the
fear of public reaction has placed football.
These organizations, however, are encounter
ing considerable trouble—high finances in

volved in the game, and the numerous ways
to evade any rules that could possibly be set
up are the major obstacles. There are too
many interested parties who are not anxious
for open scrutiny of the situation.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association
is leading official protest against hypocrisy;
this group, which devoted the major portion
of its recent national convention in New York
to an open discussion of the problem, passed
a resolution favoring a code which forbids
giving athletes any special concessions which
are not open to non-athletes as well.
Although in many respects the code is both
unenforceable and impractical, and the asso
ciation is so bulky that its resolution will be
pitifully ineffective, the N.C.A.A. has taken a
step in the right direction. The next move is
with the smaller and more workable groups,
such as the various conferences, "gentlemen's
agreements" between two or three colleges,
open discussion between alumni associations
of competing colleges, and bilateral agree
ments between college presidents to "crack
down" in their respective institutions.
One N.C.A.A. delegate remarked, "At pres
ent, the situation is rotten, and it is getting
worse." The public, which has made college
football a big business, is getting tired of the
smell. An airing is in order.
