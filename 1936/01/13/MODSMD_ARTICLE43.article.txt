# Merely Recognizing Nation-Wide Acclaim

### 
Alter one week of listening to the pros and
cons of the movement to place Grayson's
number 22 jersey in the trophy room and
reserve that number from further play, the
plan seems to stand as a feasible one.
Admittedly Grayson was not a team in
himself; but by honoring him, honor is placed
upon the team who played alongside of him
and helped put him at the top. Whether for
tunate or not, it is obvious to all that the
sportswriters of the nation have made the
name "Grayson" synonymous with Stanford
football during the past three years.
Nor is Grayson's record a usual one. In
the normal course of events, it may be a dec
ade before another such gridiron great plays
here. As compared to Nevers', the last Indian
so honored, Grayson's record may not be quite
as sensational— he did not play a full Hose
Howl game against the "Four Horsemen" with
two injured ankles, for example—but it is
certainly an extraordinary one, and one filled
with many hours of yeoman service for Stan
lord gridiron supremacy.
Certainly no grave injustice would be done
if the Kx Committee or other proper authori
ties made the move to place his jersey in tlie
trophy room. On the contrary a fitting honor
to Grayson and his teammates would be given
and a good reminder of Stanford's football
greatness be left for incoming students.
