Startlingly damning and paradoxical are
the figures coining from the arithmetic minds
of the newsmen who have been handling the
Hauptmann trial in New .Jersey. Those lig
ures: "Law enforcement agencies have spent
upwards of one million dollars (o find and
convict Hauptmann, while the final item of
expense will be one cent —the cost of the
electric charge that will kill him."
With Koosevelt jostling billions of dollars,
a matter of one million seems rather small,
but not when concerned with an attempt to
bring justice in a kidnaping case which hor
rified the nation, not when the jesting, cruel
figure of one cent is the sum necessary to do
what one million dollars decided should be
done.

But that seems to be merely one of the oddi
ties of the "outside" •world about which the
Stanford Rough in his ease seems little con
cerned.
