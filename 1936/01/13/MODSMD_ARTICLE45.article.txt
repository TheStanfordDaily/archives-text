# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
The tumult and the shouting die, the nuggets and
I lie things depart, here's soapy water in your eye, as
Hashers ding the pledging mart.
Despite the fact that "the business as usual" sign
hangs out in the library and classrooms, the standing
room only notice prevails in sorority kitchens. Wong,
the autocrat of the breakfast, lunch, and dinner
table is wielding the cleaver over the stray Hashers.
About the middle of the week, I expect to see the
Hashers dancing with each other between courses.
While the Bessemer converters in the Paly beauty
shops are working overtime drying the hair and brains
of Row permanents and Roble temporaries, (he hash
ing and culinary staffs are tearing their hair into
assorted lengths. The Pi Phi and Kappa kitchens sug
gest that somebody declare a truce until the napkins
and jackets are washed, and the Chi O force is hoping
that the Supreme Court declares the whole business
unconstitutional.
In one little sorority house, the girls got tired of
cutting flowers and scattering them around the house,
so they have employed a big-time floral decorator.
For the price of a mere $. r >o, a gentleman with an Ital
ian or French accent (optional) and a pink truck
(functional), drives up three times a week and affects
a complete change of bill. Also selected short subjects.
The effects arc purported to be more disguising
than pleasing. When one freshman woman saw it all,
she asked, "Where's the casket?"
A Pan-Hell rule prohibits calling for the freshman
women. This cash and carry system works well ex
cept when it rains. The Paly transit company would
make more money if they forgot all about Palo Alto,
and ferried the girls from Roble to Row and Row to
Roble.
