"PLEASE! "CURT, CLEAR, COMPLETE''
Editors: TIME
135 E. 42nd St.
New York City
Sirs:
"Time" is the Stanford man's bible, but considering
the rest of our collegiate reading budget, our devotion
is less a compliment to your magazine than a con
demnation of our textbooks. Pleasantly surprising to
those of us forced to read pages of academic drool
ings is the neatness and clarity of "Time's"' prose;
and disheartening is the ineptitude of the scholars
who would give us a background to understand what
"Time" says.
Perhaps because he is sworn to accuracy and se
crecy about what he writes, probably because he
doesn't know the first principle of wxiting—what to
omit—the professor's English usually manages to be
completely comprehensive and largely incomprehen
sible. It suffers from pernicious academia, a disease
that kills it at birth. And by the time it reaches us,
after revision, addition, then more dilation and tam
pering in proof, it is sensibly and offensively dead.

Of course, textbooks are not supposed to supply
an existent demand. The professor knows that, inter
esting or not, we must read them to pass his courses.
And because he can sell his book by this coercion, he
can write it to please himself, to be academically ac
ceptable, not to be pleasing and acceptable to us.
Faced with "Time's" weekly example of what can
be done to put information on a basis of legitimate
return, he merely sniffs at "popular sophistry," and
continues to use as many words as possible to say as
much as he can about all he can think of.
# * * *
If the professors cannot sec the light, perhaps am
bitious Time, Inc., can. Write us a textbook. If it
isnt't big enough to sell for the usual three dollars
at which the professor aims, sell it for one. Aim to
make it brief and interesting. Always sacrifice pid
dling accuracy for clarity of basic idea. Most important,
let it be written so that only one careful reading is the
requirement for complete understanding by anyone
whose native tongue is English.
Ready with one buck is
