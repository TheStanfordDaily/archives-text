TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 12 (/!'>. —
Bruno Richard Hauptmann's chan
ces for at least a month's extension
of life beyond next Friday night—
the date set for his execution for
the kidnap-killing of Baby Charles
L. Lindbergh—grew measurably to
night from a new executive attitude
on the power of reprievee.
In the aftermath of a denial of
clemency at the State Court of
I'ardons last night. Governor Har
old G. Hoffman asserted there
were "plenty of precedents" for
an eleventh-hour stay by him.
He previously had expressed
doubts that he could now act in. the
case.
His statement regarding "plenty
of precedents," made at Burlington,
N.J., was amplified by an announce
ment from his press aid, which said
it was "not indicative of any decision
by the Governor and refers solely to
the fact that a long line of Governors
have exercised the reprieve after
apparent expiration of the 90-day
period."
