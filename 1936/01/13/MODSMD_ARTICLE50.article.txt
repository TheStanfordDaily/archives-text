THE BALLET RUSSE, one of the
world's outstanding troupes of danc
ers, opens tonight at the San Fran
cisco Opera House for a week's en
gagement. Their repertoire in
cludes 18 ballets, nine of which were
not given last season. Among the
latter are Scheherezade, The Mid
night Sun, and The Good Humoured
Ladies. Also to be presented are
Petrouchka, Beautiful Danube, Un
ion Pacific, and many others.
PIERRE MONTEUX, new con
ductor of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, is something that
organization has needed for a long
time, ever since it ousted Alfred
Hertz, as a matter of fact.
Monteux has re-shaped and re
staffed the organization and whip
ped it into an orchestra that San
Francisco may well be proud of.
The opening pair of concerts

caused Pierre, who looks like noth
ing so much as a benign and digni
fied walrus, to be greeted with
tremendous acclaim, and well de
served it was.
He led his men through the thrill
ingly rhythmic climax of Debussy's
"Festivals" (a number even Curt
Prendergast would respond to)
without a single false note from the
long-weak brass section.
Debussy's third Nocturne, "Si
rens," heard for the first time in
San Francisco, proved a lovely
thing, with the women's chorus and
the orchestra combining to produce
an emotional effect such as must
have stirred the souls of Ulysses and
his men when first they heard the
siren songs.
And Strauss' "Till Eulenspicgel"
was given with all the merry gusto
and sly humor of the real Till. In
short, a flawless program.
