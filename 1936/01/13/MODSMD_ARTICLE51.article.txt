At the Fox-Stanford
C"Whipsaw" is a long show,
but not very much really
happens. In fact, when you
think it over, surprisingly
little. It's one of those shows which
you sort of enjoy while you're see
ing it, but afterward wonder just
what you got for your 30 cents
(balcony stairs to the left).
After all, though, you do get one
thing for your 30 cents — Myrna
Loy. And since "The Thin Man,"
most people feel she's worth it.
Don't get the idea she's as cute and
witty and sparkly as in that mem
orable film—but Spencer Tracy and
she are a pleasant enough pair. At
least they partly make up for an
otherwise dull and lengthy flicky
about pearl thieves, and would-be
pearl thieves, and G-men, and
twins.

"FRESHMAN LOVE"
Also at the Stanford
CMost people don't expect,
much of a picture called
"Freshman Love." It's bound
to be a study-less, athlete
full exaggeration of the thrills of
college life.
Frank McHugh, and the McHugh
laugh, function as rowing coach at

Billings College. Faced with a short
age of promising crew men, and the
resulting loss of his job, he sends
Patricia Ellis around the country
rounding up fellows to put Billings
on the rowing map. We won't give
you the old line about "if you're
not fed up with college movies"—
"Freshman Love" is harmless
enough, anyway. And doesn't Pa
tricia Ellis mean something?
