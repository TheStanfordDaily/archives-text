AL.SO DISLIKES REVIEWER

The Editor, Sir:
The Reviewer . . . expected boys
'of 9 to 12 years of age to have the
matured voices of an ordinary choir.
He compared their acting to Shir
ley Temple's. I wonder if he has
ever listened to Shirley sing? Their
training was perfect, their stage
presence wonderful, and their voices
superior to any other children's
group.
I'm not complaining about his dis
gusting review of the concert; we
are all entitled to our opinions, and
nothing he wrote can change the
feeling of enjoyment that those who
heard these boys sing felt. i
I am complaining of Mr. Bern
heim's conduct, however. Walking
out in the middle of the last group
of songs, disturbing people around
him, and making an obvious effort j
to show his disapproval, is in my
opinion the worst of bad manners, j
How can a fair review be given!
without hearing the whole of the j
concert?
Deirdre Dobbs
Reviewer intended no "obvious i
disapproval," but was merely
following long-standing custom of j
morning paper reviewers: leav- j
ing in time to make his paper's j
deadline.—Ed.

All letter* must carry a signature, and are subject to deletion ol unneces
sary details. The Editor has the riqht to withhold from publication any
correspondence strictly malicious in nature.
