# BOUQUET FOR MR. NAGEL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
No one has yet bothered lo men
tion that Mr. Nagel's orchestra of
this year is about as fancy an ag
gregation as has toodled on this
campus. Smooth music . . . good
novelties . . . good arrangements
. . . good stuff. Many at the Reg
Dance Friday thought that evening
of dance music as enjoyable as any
ever heard in the Women's Gym.
Having no connection with the or
chestra, I speaking without shame;
Mr. Nagcl, my nickel, please!
Appreciative
