# SORRY YOU MISINTERPRETED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your opening issue of the win
ter quarur Daily contained a very
interesting editorial entitled "Break
ing All Custom for a Better Paper,"
The editorial goes on to say, "as
was the case in the first change, (he
latest one seems certain to bring
down the commendation of the staid
and of those hopelessly stuck in the
rut of custom."
It is entirely up to you as the edi
tor of the Daily to shape the policy
of your paper. You may not realize
it, but some 70 men have held your
present position before you. Prob
ably not one of them would dis
agree with your idea that change
represents progress usually.
However, to say, "the changes are
contrary perhaps to established cus
tom in the fourth estate. Thai is
granted, but what difference does it
make?", is putting yourself in a
precarious spot. It so happens, that

like every other established profes
sion, newspapers are guided by dt-fi- 1
nite criteria, established through ;
many years of experience. If you
wish to depart from them, that is
your own privilege.
But to say that those who hold
opposing views are those who are
stair and hopelessly stuck in the rut
of custom is ridiculous. It is the
same as dogmatically shouting that I
the man who belongs to an oppos
ing political party from yours does 1
not know what he is talking about.
Newspapers, even college ones, still
happen to be guided by very definite
rules of make-up and composition.
