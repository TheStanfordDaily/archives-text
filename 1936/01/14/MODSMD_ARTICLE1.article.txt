# Court Rules AAA Taxes Refunded
## U.S. Must Pay 200 Millions in Impounded Assessments, Says Court 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (/P).—The
government lost $200,000,000 in im
pounded AAA processing taxes to
day through a Supreme Court de
cision which left unsettled the
larger question of whether the
Treasury must refund any of the
$1,000,000,000 it. has collected.
Almost simultaneously the high
court deferred for several weeks at
least the question of the constitu
tionality of the Bankhead cotton
control act, explaining that a case
presenting that issue was not in
proper form for Supreme Court
consideration.
TVA Case Not Decided
There was no announcement on
the third New Deal case which the
Justices had under consideration.
Presumably a decision will be
forthcoming next Monday on the
Tennessee Valley suit, involving
the government's right to enter the
electric power business.
Tin; tax decision, unanimous
and read by Justice Roberts, who
last week announced the vcrdict
smashing AAA, brought immedi
ate forecasts t hat Congress would
be asked to enact new revenue
raising legislation.
Others continued to pay, and the
Treasury collected $(59,427,350 be
tween June 27, 1935—the date for
the first injunction was sought —
and last Monday, when the AAA
was definitely invalidated.
As a result of the impounding of
the $200,000,000, the AAA, which
kept on paying farm benefits until
last Monday, found itself "in the
red" by that amount. In addition, it
owes $280,000,000 more to farmers
who adjusted crop production under
1935 contracts.
