# Student Salesmen Will 'Sell' Stanford
## 
### Dave Botsford 
Small, firecracker-like Chuck
Shafer is pretty enthusiastic about
anything he dees —and he happened
to he attending Long Beach High
School when the disastrous 1933
earthquake hit Southern California.
First Sold Bonds
Long Bcach High School crum
pled. Some of the ex-school's .stu
dent speakers, including Chuck,
immediately organized a Speakers'
Bureau to go out and sell bonds for
rebuilding the school to South
land business men. They were suc
cessful, and ihc Speakers' Bureau
flourished, until today it furnishes
clubs and organizations of Southern
California something like 30 student
speakers a week.
Then Chuck left Long Beach and
is today a Stanford sophomore.
And he's still just as enthusiastic—
especially about the value to stu
dent speakers of "contacting the
outside world." But thus earnest
Long Beach lad was frankly dis
appointed when he discovered how
limited were a speaker's chances at
Stanford.
Well, when Chuck discovered
from Speech Professor William
Timmons and Political Science

Professor Edward Cottrell that
their departments were contin
ually turning down community
and commercial cluhs' requests
for Stanford speakers, he was not
only annoyed—he did something.
Today a Speakers' Bureau is try
ing to Ret its first breaths on the
Stanford campus—with Professor
Timmons its adviser and Manager
Shafer is attempting to spank lasting
life into the infant.
Operation Described
The way the bureau plans to work
is this: interested students, men or
women, sign up first with Professor
Timmons in Room 203 D. Then, after
ihe student nas prepared a speech,
he will deliver it before the Review
Board. Wally Brooke, Chuck Sha
fer, Jean Albertson (women's rep
resentative), Wayne Richardson
(debate manager), and Professor
Timmons make up the board.
After the hoard has passed upon
his competence, the student is an
official speaker for the Stanford
Speakers' Bureau. Shafer is con
tacting various Palo Alto and
peninsula "service" clubs, and as
soon as possible the speakers will
be sent to "inject youth" into the
oldsters.

tacting various Palo Alto and
peninsula "service" clubs, and as
soon as possible the speakers will
be sent to "inject youth" into the
oldsters.
Small, firecracker-like Chuck
Shafer is pretty enthusiastic about
anything he dees —and he happened
to he attending Long Beach High
School when the disastrous 1933
earthquake hit Southern California.
First Sold Bonds
Long Bcach High School crum
pled. Some of the ex-school's .stu
dent speakers, including Chuck,
immediately organized a Speakers'
Bureau to go out and sell bonds for
rebuilding the school to South
land business men. They were suc
cessful, and ihc Speakers' Bureau
flourished, until today it furnishes
clubs and organizations of Southern
California something like 30 student
speakers a week.
Then Chuck left Long Beach and
is today a Stanford sophomore.
And he's still just as enthusiastic—
especially about the value to stu
dent speakers of "contacting the
outside world." But thus earnest
Long Beach lad was frankly dis
appointed when he discovered how
limited were a speaker's chances at
Stanford.
Well, when Chuck discovered
from Speech Professor William
Timmons and Political Science

Professor Edward Cottrell that
their departments were contin
ually turning down community
and commercial cluhs' requests
for Stanford speakers, he was not
only annoyed—he did something.
Today a Speakers' Bureau is try
ing to Ret its first breaths on the
Stanford campus—with Professor
Timmons its adviser and Manager
Shafer is attempting to spank lasting
life into the infant.
Operation Described
The way the bureau plans to work
is this: interested students, men or
women, sign up first with Professor
Timmons in Room 203 D. Then, after
ihe student nas prepared a speech,
he will deliver it before the Review
Board. Wally Brooke, Chuck Sha
fer, Jean Albertson (women's rep
resentative), Wayne Richardson
(debate manager), and Professor
Timmons make up the board.
After the hoard has passed upon
his competence, the student is an
official speaker for the Stanford
Speakers' Bureau. Shafer is con
tacting various Palo Alto and
peninsula "service" clubs, and as
soon as possible the speakers will
be sent to "inject youth" into the
oldsters.
