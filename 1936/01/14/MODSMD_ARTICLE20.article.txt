# 'Radio' Control For Theater Lights
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
One of the most modern and flexible theater switchboards in the world,
employing huge radio tubes to make possible lighting effects heretofore
obtainable only with similar equipment at the Radio City Theater and
Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, may be installed in the
Stanford Memorial Theater, Comptroller Almon li Roth said yesterday.

Meanwhile, building operations
were to be resumed on the theater
structure within two weeks, fol
lowing a month's lay-off to com
plete contracts for ventilation, heat
ing, and electrical wiring, he an
nounced.
The switchboard will have an ease
and versatility of operation impos
sible with boards employing rheo
stats for direct dimming, accord
ing to Dr. Leland H. Brown, assist
ant professor of electrical engineer
ing.

Whereas most boards employ the
resistance principle to drop or in
crease voltage, the new board will
merely control large inductance
units by the use of varying amounts
of direct current, he explained.
Oversize copies of the rectifying
tubes of the ordinary radio set will
vary the How of illuminating cur
rent in large adjacent coils.
They will act much as a sliding
arm of the mechanically-controlled
rheostat, or dimmer. The actual
controls, Dr. Brown pointed out,
will only vary the amount of cur
rent going to the tubes, and will
be no bigger (ban (he volume
control on a radio sc(.
All lights in both the main the
ater and the new little theater will
be controlled from small boards to
be located either in the orchestra
pit or the projection room, permit
ting the electrician to see the stage
and so make his lighting changes
fit the action. This, Dr. Brown
pointed out, is very difficult to do
with the usual switchboard located
just behind the proscenium arch at
stage right.
Approximately 24 direct current
induction dimming units will be em
ployed, handling electrical energy
equivalent to 125 horsepower.
Controls for the larger stage
will handle a maximum of 101
2000-watt receptacles, and those
for the Little Theater stage, sfi
2000-watt taps. Each of the in
ductor dimming units will handle
a maximum of five horsepower.
The units will also serve the stage
of the contemplated outdoor theater,
Mr. Roth plans. In each case, light
ing effects may be handled from a
small portable board, with gang
ups for big cfTects handled elec
trically, instead of by cumbersome
and immovable mechanical con
trols.

The units will also serve the stage
of the contemplated outdoor theater,
Mr. Roth plans. In each case, light
ing effects may be handled from a
small portable board, with gang
ups for big cfTects handled elec
trically, instead of by cumbersome
and immovable mechanical con
trols.
One of the most modern and flexible theater switchboards in the world,
employing huge radio tubes to make possible lighting effects heretofore
obtainable only with similar equipment at the Radio City Theater and
Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, may be installed in the
Stanford Memorial Theater, Comptroller Almon li Roth said yesterday.

Meanwhile, building operations
were to be resumed on the theater
structure within two weeks, fol
lowing a month's lay-off to com
plete contracts for ventilation, heat
ing, and electrical wiring, he an
nounced.
The switchboard will have an ease
and versatility of operation impos
sible with boards employing rheo
stats for direct dimming, accord
ing to Dr. Leland H. Brown, assist
ant professor of electrical engineer
ing.

Whereas most boards employ the
resistance principle to drop or in
crease voltage, the new board will
merely control large inductance
units by the use of varying amounts
of direct current, he explained.
Oversize copies of the rectifying
tubes of the ordinary radio set will
vary the How of illuminating cur
rent in large adjacent coils.
They will act much as a sliding
arm of the mechanically-controlled
rheostat, or dimmer. The actual
controls, Dr. Brown pointed out,
will only vary the amount of cur
rent going to the tubes, and will
be no bigger (ban (he volume
control on a radio sc(.
All lights in both the main the
ater and the new little theater will
be controlled from small boards to
be located either in the orchestra
pit or the projection room, permit
ting the electrician to see the stage
and so make his lighting changes
fit the action. This, Dr. Brown
pointed out, is very difficult to do
with the usual switchboard located
just behind the proscenium arch at
stage right.
Approximately 24 direct current
induction dimming units will be em
ployed, handling electrical energy
equivalent to 125 horsepower.
Controls for the larger stage
will handle a maximum of 101
2000-watt receptacles, and those
for the Little Theater stage, sfi
2000-watt taps. Each of the in
ductor dimming units will handle
a maximum of five horsepower.
