# 'Radio' Control For Theater Lights

### Bob Eisenbach 
One of the most modern and flexible theater switchboards in the world,
employing huge radio tubes to make possible lighting effects heretofore
obtainable only with similar equipment at the Radio City Theater and
Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, may be installed in the
Stanford Memorial Theater, Comptroller Almon li Roth said yesterday.

Meanwhile, building operations
were to be resumed on the theater
structure within two weeks, fol
lowing a month's lay-off to com
plete contracts for ventilation, heat
ing, and electrical wiring, he an
nounced.
The switchboard will have an ease
and versatility of operation impos
sible with boards employing rheo
stats for direct dimming, accord
ing to Dr. Leland H. Brown, assist
ant professor of electrical engineer
ing.
Works Like Radio
Whereas most boards employ the
resistance principle to drop or in
crease voltage, the new board will
merely control large inductance
units by the use of varying amounts
of direct current, he explained.
Oversize copies of the rectifying
tubes of the ordinary radio set will
vary the How of illuminating cur
rent in large adjacent coils.
They will act much as a sliding
arm of the mechanically-controlled
rheostat, or dimmer. The actual
controls, Dr. Brown pointed out,
will only vary the amount of cur
rent going to the tubes, and will
be no bigger (ban (he volume
