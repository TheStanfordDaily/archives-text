In a talk on "Business in Retro- j
spect and Prospect" over the Stan
ford Radio Hour last night, Dean
J. Hugh Jackson, of the Graduate
School of Business, claimed that
business is definitely headed toward
higher levels.
In fact, he stated, *the year 1935
closed with more genuine confidence
in the outlook for the coming year !
than there has been at any time I
since the depression started. How- i
ever, it is to be noted that the de
pression primarily struck the dur- I
able goods industry, in which lies !
our chief source of employment, i
The decrease in unemployment can j
come through the revival of these I
industries, which up to the present
time have had very little incentive !
for a return to normalcy.
Several other danger spots con
tinue to exist, added Dean Jackson.
The federal budget will not be bal
anced, pending Supreme Court ae- j
cisions will have an unsettling ef- j
feet, while the possibility of addi
tional taxes, or European war, and
tho uncertainties of the forthcoming
presidential election will all have a
detering effect upon recovery.
