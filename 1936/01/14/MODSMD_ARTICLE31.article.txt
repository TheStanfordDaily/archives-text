# Bonus May Be Paid by Baby' Bonds
## Coalition-Backed Bill Introduced by Harrison to Senate Finance Committee Plans To Approve Measure after Report by Morgenthau 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jand. 13 (AP). â€”Introduction of a coalition-supported
bill for full payment of the Soldiers' Bonus with federal '"baby" bonds
redeemable in cash was heralded today by Senate followers of the New
Deal as an end of the long controverted issue.

Chairman Harrison of the Senate
Financing Committee, who voted to
sustain President Roosevelt's veto
last session of the inflationary Pat
man Bill, introduced the new meas
ure as a substitute for the bill
passed Friday by the House.
That measure provided no means
of payment. Harrison said the
measure he introduced had the
support of Democratic Leader
Robinson who also has voted in
the past to support the president's
stand.
"In my opinion this bill will be
enacted into law," Harrison bluntly
predicted.
The Finance Committee planned
to give quick approval to the bill to
morrow after hearing Secretary
Morgenthau. The Senate adjourned
today until Thursday and the bill
may come up on the floor then.
Daniel W. Bell, acting director
of the budget, and Frank T. Hines,
administrator of veterans' affairs,
were heard in executive session
by the committee late today.
The committee was understood to
have closely questioned Beil on
treasury views concerning the abil
ity or inclination of the bond mar
ket to absorb baby bondes to fin
ance bonus payment.
