# Speakers' Bureau Calls for Women
## 
### 
Stanford's new Speakers' Bureau
yesterday issued a call for women
to join its ranks.
Although about 30 men have
applied for positions on the bureau's
speaking staff, Charles Shafer, bu
reau manager, announces a need
for women. "There is always a
place for qualified women speakers,"
he said. "We are now contacting
Mothers' Clubs, P.T.A. organiza
tions, and other women's clubs of
the peninsula, and a number of
women speakers will soon be called
upon to address them."
Interested women —and men who
have not already done so —will sign
up with Professor William Tim
mons in Room 203 D.
