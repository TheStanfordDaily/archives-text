# Bunn Develops New Defense As Trap for Bears
## Sparky Robertson and Jack Calderwood At Guard; Moore Favors Bad Shoulder 
### Warren Breed 
The UCLAsh of Saturday night furnishing liini with enough ami plenty
to spare as an object lesson in the way of a lacking defense, C'oaeli John
Bunn trotted out an entirely new defensive schedule in yesterday's work
out, which the Cards will Hash against Cal Friday night.

But his man Dinty Moore, cap-*
tain, guard, and bulwark on de- |
louse, was not able to try out the i
new system. He was in street [
clothes, favoring an injured shoul- >
der. Whether the Cap will play in j
the first Cal game Friday night is j
not certain, but the injury was not j
considered serious.
New Guards
In Moore's absence Bunn worked
Sparky Robertson and Jack Calder- \
wood at the two guard spots.
A half-hour's chalk talk preceded
the workout, Bunn explaining the !
intricacies ol' his new system. Then !
they tried it out, using the third- !
string as offensive foes.
The exact nature of Bunil's de- I
fense is not being scattered broad- I
cast in these days before the Bear j
game, but it is quite a singular and j
imposing formation, and gives
"Hands" Luisetti a great chance to
play his favorite thorn-in-opponent's !
side type of game.

The UCLAsh of Saturday night furnishing liini with enough ami plenty
to spare as an object lesson in the way of a lacking defense, C'oaeli John
Bunn trotted out an entirely new defensive schedule in yesterday's work
out, which the Cards will Hash against Cal Friday night.

But his man Dinty Moore, cap-*
tain, guard, and bulwark on de- |
louse, was not able to try out the i
new system. He was in street [
clothes, favoring an injured shoul- >
der. Whether the Cap will play in j
the first Cal game Friday night is j
not certain, but the injury was not j
considered serious.
New Guards
In Moore's absence Bunn worked
Sparky Robertson and Jack Calder- \
wood at the two guard spots.
A half-hour's chalk talk preceded
the workout, Bunn explaining the !
intricacies ol' his new system. Then !
they tried it out, using the third- !
string as offensive foes.
The exact nature of Bunil's de- I
fense is not being scattered broad- I
cast in these days before the Bear j
game, but it is quite a singular and j
imposing formation, and gives
"Hands" Luisetti a great chance to
play his favorite thorn-in-opponent's !
side type of game.
