VOTE OF THANKS
TO BONES

Here's a motion for a vote of
thanks to Bones Hamilton. Don't
know whether you know it or not,
but Bones sacrificed a trip to Hawaii
with Pop Warner's gang to play
Stanford baseball.
Hamilton was asked to join the
Hawaii-bound team along with
Grayson, Topping, Reynolds, et
al. of Stanford. He wanted to go,
too.
But the coast conference base
ball bosses decided that he'd lose his
eligibility if he played ball in the
islands, so Bones gave up the idea.
As captain of the diamond troupe
this season, he'll be of much value.
And when a fellow makes such a
sacrifice he deserves thanks.

STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT

Still analyzing Stanford's loss to
the Uclans Saturday . . . Here are
the points we'd set down as being
chief reason for the slip.
Stanford was a hit too confident.
During most of the game the In
dians figured that any minute
they'd pull out ahead and win. So
did everyone. But those Bruins

I stymied us just as they did on
(he football field.
Stanford's offense wasn't working
| at all; U.C.L.A.'s tight man-to-man
defense did—too well.
On passing and shooting Stan
ford wasn't "hot."
On the same points the Bruins
! were decidedly "hot."
But on no one point can Stan
ford lay the blame. It seemed in
evitable that U.CL.A. was to take
the affair and certainly those Bruins,
who came back after a sad evening
before to stop the stronger Stanford,
deserved everything they got.
