## Frosh Cagers To Play Menlo Five Tomorrow First-Year Men Have Three Tilts This Week 
### 
Stressing individual defense,
Stanford frosh basketball men be- j
gan a big week with yesterday's j
practice. The first-year team will
play Menlo Junior College at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night, the Marin
jaysees Friday, and Berkeley High i
School Saturday.
Defensive work will occupy
most of the time of Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's charges all week. In ,
the yearlings' victories over Gali- '
leo and Palo Alto, most of tlie im
provement shown was on attack.
The first-string guards—Pete Mc-
Arthur, with several long shots and
some good passing, and Dick Neeley,
with the ability to dribble clear un
der the basket and sink set-ups —
looked much better in the week-end
games than in practice.
• Passing, which had been wild
as a March hare in scrimmage,
last week, was fairly well tamed
against the two prep teams.
Although a guard, Neeley is fully
as tall as Phil Zonne, high-scoring
center —three or four inches over 6
feet—and may develop into a sec
ond under-basket threat.
Ad Dewey's Menlo quintet may
give the Indian babes trouble to
morrow night, although the Oaks
lost a game to Black-Foxe Acad
emy, Los Angeles prep school well
known for its polo teams. Marin 1
