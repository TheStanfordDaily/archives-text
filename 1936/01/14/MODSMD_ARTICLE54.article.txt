# Three Stars Lost as Track Work Begins
## Rain Hampers Practice Of Stanford Cindermen 
### Phil Klauber 
To Coach "Dink" Templeton, re
turning to the campus this week
after an operation in the city, falLs
one of the unhappy lots of his pro- j
fession.
Faced with the (ask of proving
to the sports world that Stanford
is not hopelessly at the bottom of
a track cycle, Tcmpleton will he
gin the final grooming of the
Cardinal 1936 track team con
fronted with all sorts of hard |
luck.
Rain, perennial enemy of Indian
cindermen, is still a factor. Final
settling and grooming of the new
Angell Field plant has been delayed
j for some weeks, and the few ardent
[ athletes who have braved the wind j
! and water this past week have
j sought recourse to the stadium. The
| stadium track resembles a hog wal
, lowing pit.
J Most devastating news is that
| three fine lettermen will be lost for
| the present quarter's competition.
Rusty March, half-miler, and Phil
Levy, first-rate discus thrower, have
I not returned to school, while Chuck
] Voigt, sprinter and broad-jumper,
is scholastically ineligible.
Final survey, then, of the men
! who have already proven them-
I selves, shows strength in the longer
distance runs, especially the two
j mile, both hurdles, an excellent
| high jump department, and some
| weightmen.
