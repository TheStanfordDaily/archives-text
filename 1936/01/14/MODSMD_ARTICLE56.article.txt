Small talk for years has advocated abolition
of sororities. Hut nine sororities are holding
their own here; hence rushing is still with us;
and Saturday pledging too will he with us. So
much has heen said about women's pledging
both in print and by word of mouth that the
main points have been nobly obscured.
With 1100 women 011 campus, less than
one-fourth of whom belong to sororities, some
feeling and friction is bound to arise. About
100 frosh women will choose to join the ranks
Saturday; some will choose not to join; not a
few never will be confronted with the choice.
Despite the wishes of family or boy friends
or tales of the glories of sororal existence,
frosh women should face the question sanely,
with lull realization that 011 the democratic
Farm neither Hull nor Row carries with it
sanctity or stigma. True there is a cleavage—
but it is simply that Row and Hall have dif
ferent advantages to oiler different types of
women.
Since women are inclined to elubbishness
and interested in social distinctions, the whole
problem has been inagnilied and distorted.
The real choice offered is that of living in a
close-knit, homogeneous group, or as an indi
vidual acting within a large group. To pledge
or not is, then, an individual problem.
How many women have pledged themselves
into a life that has not proved congenial to
them because they thought they would please
their family or some man —specific or gen
eral—is a matter of conjecture. Those who
did evidently failed to remind themselves that

there is still much to be said for an individu
alistic existence. Surprising as it might seem
to them, there are even many men who prefer
the company of individualistic women to
those who hunt in packs.
After the hubbub dies, most pledges will
fit readily and happily into sorority life; there
may be others who will wish they had let
someone else take the step of which they ex
pected so much. Most Hall women — whether
by choice or by chance — will fit easily into life
at Lagunita or one of the less pretentious halls
with little maladjustment and with much to
be gained.
A handful of Hall women, however, will
foolishly consider themselves left-overs and
be embittered by the failure of one house or
another to bid them. These few fail to see
Hall and Row in their respective places.
The role of sororities in social life is gen
erally conceded and much romanticized.
Halls, too, have a definite social life of their
own. It is less pictured, but many first-rate
women have chosen it deliberately in prefer
ence to that of sororities. They realized that
the particular sorority that bid them might
not turn out to be a congenial group for them,
despite appearances.
Less noticed but infinitely more important
is one's individual life and the friends chosen
to help in forming and living it. Rut whether
on Row or in Hall, problems of adjustment
will occur next year; then, not now, comes
the important test for the individual — can
she, of herself, rise to meet them?
