# Heading Toward High Ethical Goal Would Be Football's Best Alternative
## 
### 
if the maze of hypocrisy, evasions, and cor
ruption could suddenly be cleared away, it
would be scch that American college football
lies between Ihe horns of a dilemma, and must
soon make a choice as to which way it will
lu rn.
Football is now in a position that dilfers
from any of the other amateur sports—in
most colleges it is the business that is used to
support the sport-for-sport's-sake events.
The question it now faces: Should it head
for open professionalism, since it now is in a
monetary class with the rest of the profes
sional sports? Or should it turn back toward
the goal from which it has gradually evolved?
If college football elects the former alterna
tive, il must face the fact that henceforth it
will be run as any other big business, and
must count on the possibility that a disap
proving public opinion might spell destruc
tion for Ihe game itself.
If the great American spoil, on Ihe other
hand, turns in the opposite direction, it will
face a goal so far away and so difficult of

attainment that the journey will require years
of diligent travel.
Should football decide to hack-track along
this path, it must not fool itself; it must face
facts and see that the trip out was a downhill
trot, that the return journey is uphill all the
way. It cannot afford to Imiden itself with
continued hypocrisy; it must concede that
there is too much evasion, that the hest it can
hope for is to gradually eliminate this evasion
by tracking down and revealing as much of
it as possible and discouraging the rest from
within —not by laws and unenforceable rules
from without.
Furthermore, it must realize that the goal
may never be reached, but that it is a better
road to travel than to chance the complete
that threatens it in the other direction.
The American colleges soon must make
this choice. The high ethical standards of
amateur athletics represented in the one ex
treme will be difTiciilt, perhaps impossible, to
attain. But apparently it is preferable to the
chaos that will result if it takes the other
alternative.
