NOT A LITTLE BIT INDEPENDENT
A wily magazine editor . . . sitting at his desk last !
Saturday morning . . . remarked that he needed a j
story on that old question of women paying half of j
date expenses . . . and suggested that colleges organ- j
ize Share-Date-Expense clubs . . . just for a pub- i
licity gag.
* * * *
Ono knows very well what would happen if any- '
body should ask the publicity department to do some- I
Ihing for a gag. A ruffle of indignation would rise
and disturb the atmosphere. Stanford doesn't stoop
to such things. But one wonders what would happen ,
if some enthusiastic organizer should swoop down i
on Lagunita, for example, and say: "Listen girls, a |
lot of you never go out with Stanford men, never get s
asked, and on Saturday night you have to get to
gether with Suzie and Josephine and go to a show in
Paly. That's dull business, and I (the organizer) have |
a remedy."
* # # *
Then this emancipator of Stanford women from i
constant female companionship would go on to explain 1
that dates in this sector are expensive. This is a re- 1
suit of a few rich boys raising the average 100 high.
And, with a word about college women having just '
as much money to spend as the men, he would pro- :
ceed with a proposal whereby the dates per capita j
among women could be increased. .
♦ * ♦ *
The proposal might include a kind of date union to '
which women sympathetic to the cause might join. 1
These women to sign a pledge that they would go on no
dates without paying half the expenses, would black- I
list men who failed to co-operate, and would indulge 1
in the privilege of asking men for dates instead of
waiting ready to shout a willing acceptance at the
first ham who calls up. The union might even estab
lish certain ethical rules of conduct involving necking
and so forth, and put the members on their honor
to abide by them. (Honor systems being traditional ,
around here, anyway.)
♦ * * *
But what would Stanford women say to such a '
scheme as this? They would giggle maybe, storm and
rant maybe, hoist their neatly powdered noses and
silently register disapproval maybe. At any rate,
they'd be against it. Stanford women are like that.
For do they want to bo independent? Only in the
sen.-.c that they can depend on their own youthful
charms to be the date-producing medium. And the !
majority who aren't abundantly endowed with such
charms would rather sit than stand up on their silken
incased hind legs and do something.
Perhaps it's unkind to speak of Stanford's 1000 in
a manner deleterious. They had courage to come to
what was once known as a man's school in the first 1
place. But somehow one can't imagine them wanting
to be independent or having the nerve to establish
such a thing as a sharc-the-date-expen.se plan.

But what would Stanford women say to such a '
scheme as this? They would giggle maybe, storm and
rant maybe, hoist their neatly powdered noses and
silently register disapproval maybe. At any rate,
they'd be against it. Stanford women are like that.
For do they want to bo independent? Only in the
sen.-.c that they can depend on their own youthful
charms to be the date-producing medium. And the !
majority who aren't abundantly endowed with such
charms would rather sit than stand up on their silken
incased hind legs and do something.
Perhaps it's unkind to speak of Stanford's 1000 in
a manner deleterious. They had courage to come to
what was once known as a man's school in the first 1
place. But somehow one can't imagine them wanting
to be independent or having the nerve to establish
such a thing as a sharc-the-date-expen.se plan.

NOT A LITTLE BIT INDEPENDENT
A wily magazine editor . . . sitting at his desk last !
Saturday morning . . . remarked that he needed a j
story on that old question of women paying half of j
date expenses . . . and suggested that colleges organ- j
ize Share-Date-Expense clubs . . . just for a pub- i
licity gag.
* * * *
Ono knows very well what would happen if any- '
body should ask the publicity department to do some- I
Ihing for a gag. A ruffle of indignation would rise
and disturb the atmosphere. Stanford doesn't stoop
to such things. But one wonders what would happen ,
if some enthusiastic organizer should swoop down i
on Lagunita, for example, and say: "Listen girls, a |
lot of you never go out with Stanford men, never get s
asked, and on Saturday night you have to get to
gether with Suzie and Josephine and go to a show in
Paly. That's dull business, and I (the organizer) have |
a remedy."
* # # *
Then this emancipator of Stanford women from i
constant female companionship would go on to explain 1
that dates in this sector are expensive. This is a re- 1
suit of a few rich boys raising the average 100 high.
And, with a word about college women having just '
as much money to spend as the men, he would pro- :
ceed with a proposal whereby the dates per capita j
among women could be increased. .
♦ * ♦ *
The proposal might include a kind of date union to '
which women sympathetic to the cause might join. 1
These women to sign a pledge that they would go on no
dates without paying half the expenses, would black- I
list men who failed to co-operate, and would indulge 1
in the privilege of asking men for dates instead of
waiting ready to shout a willing acceptance at the
first ham who calls up. The union might even estab
lish certain ethical rules of conduct involving necking
and so forth, and put the members on their honor
to abide by them. (Honor systems being traditional ,
around here, anyway.)
