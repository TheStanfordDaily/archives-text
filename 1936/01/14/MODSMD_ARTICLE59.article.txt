Now is an appropriate time to speak of the warmth
! of fraternity ties. In this regard I point out an in
teresting and true item. In one of the eating clubs there
: are two of the venerable grads who are the oldest
j members of the club in point of service, yet they have
' never been introduced and th'jy never speak to each
j other.
Now comes a tremendous story of cruel and bitter
revenge. Those who have followed Our Hasher's ex
citing Gloomy Moor tales may remember that at the
j last writing the lovely Desdemona had the Gloomy
one in the doghouse. But the revenge of the Moor has
j been swift and sure.
I .
A dog-buying deal went through at the Pi Phi
house in which the Moor participated. He bought one
third interest in a puppy which was a cross between
| Chow and an Alaskan Husky, a very fine dog, ic
j cording to modern authorities. This gave the gloomer
I one-sixth of a Chow and one-sixth of a Husky. The
! rest was apportioned equally bet ween two Pi Phis.
Now nothing would do but what the lovely Desdc
| mona should show the cute little doggie to the pledges
one evening. Despite the onerous ownership, she
: trotted him out and held him on her lap during din
| ner. But sad to relate, the cute little doggie was in
-1 noccnt of the necessary proprieties, and Desdemona
j was forced to depart hurriedly from the room, her
formal completely ruined.
A game to play in the lull that comes between the
time the girls discussing the freshman with the fine
| family and subdued manners and the time they stop
discussing her has been invented by the Alpha Phicnds.
It is called Rushing Bridge. The four players sit facing
each other at a bridge table. (This prevents knifing in
the back.) The dealer shuffles out 13 rushing cards
or so. The dealer starts the bidding: "I bid two Theta."
The player to her right bids according to her dis
cretion: "I bid three D.G."' Thus goes on merrily for
j some time. When it comes time to show hands, the
biggest nuggets take the tricks.
