# Ex Committee Grants Athletic Awards Tonight
## New Trophy Case May Be Placed in Theater 
### 
Granting of athletic awards will
occupy the first part of tonight's Ex
Committee session. The group must
authorize recommendations of
coaches and timers for football,
freshman and varsity soccer, and
water polo letters.
Stanford needs a new trophy case,
thinks President YVally Brooke. He
has investigated the facilities of
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. for displaying
their cups, and has decided that
some sort of show-case is necessary.
"As it is," sf.ys Brooke, "most of
the school's awards are in the
8.A.C., where women can never
see them."
The new theater will probably be
used, says Brooke. Some sort of
case could be installed in the lobby,
with a few trophies from the B.A.C.
room placed there each week. If the
theater could not be used, probably
the case could be put in the admin
istration building or the library.
Whether or not Bobby Grayson's
football jersey should be kept for
exhibit with Ihat of Ernie Novers
will be settled tonight. Ex Commit
tee so far exhibits great difference
of opinion about the matter.
Money for engraving the axe,
symbol of Big Game victory, with
the score of the last Cal encounter
must also be voted. All requests for
dates must be turned in imme
diately.
