# ENUF IS TOO MUCH

The Editor, Sir:
I'm an optimist. I'm a benevolent
! soul, slow to anger. When I re-
I turned to this educational institu
| tion, I put my trunk under the bed
to keep the springs off the floor,
i and thought nothing of it. I ate the
boiled gopher at the Union and I
thought very little of that either.
1 I smiled when I paid my tuition
| (I knew the kind of checks I write.)
I Even when the cursed cat-calls
j drowned the actors in the Paly
pitches, I said with a sweet smile,
"Just a group of fun-loving chil
dren."
I can stomach all this, but, sir,
I'll be blowed if I can stand to look
much longer at these terrific Stan
ford women. However, necessity is
the mother of invention and I'm the
father of a magnificent one: dark
glasses with leather lenses for look
ing at people you don't want to
see.
Of these there is one major classi
j fication—Stanford co-eds—which is
I in turn separated into five divisions.
These five, by name, are graduates,
seniors, juniors, sophs, and frosh.
And the greatest of these is fresh
! man. Otto Glumphf
