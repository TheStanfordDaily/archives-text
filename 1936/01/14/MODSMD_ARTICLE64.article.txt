# TIMIDLY HE SUGGESTS

The Editor, Sir:
Now that the battle between men
and women has become a campus
topic, we have carefully consid
ered the conditions pertaining to i
inter-sexual relations, and arrived
at these sane but varied conclusions.
i Firstly, there is the unsolved
1 problem—are Stanford women hu
man? Realizing the concession it
must be for Stanford women to
walk and talk with us moYtals, we
feel that to their many virtues they
might add one conceding us a posi
tion as near-equals. Of course, a
mere Stanford man could never at
tain the plane of one of our ter
rific "queens. 1 '
In their typically generous way, j
they have doubtless planned to do j
their bit for the men this year. ;
However, they might possibly need
; the sort of weak stimulus we humbly
I render in suggesting that they make
' all their own dates this leap-year—
i to see if they could do a better job
of it. Their natures are so noble, so
i illustrious, arid so dignified that |
j they are incapable of having their,
endowments belittled. Therefore,
we timidly suggest that they pon- j
der a moment on our idea.
