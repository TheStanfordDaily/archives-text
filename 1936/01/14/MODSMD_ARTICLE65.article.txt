# TARRED WITH SAME STICK?
## 
### 
| The Editor, Sir:
Bull Session of Friday, by Mr.
j McClelland, raises a few points.
First: The wholesale elimination
(of inferior people to produce a
j super-race) mentioned might well
J start with columnists who gener
! alize from the particular, for such
was the impression gained. (You
j can take the engineer along, too.)
Second: It's an old gag anyhow,
for even I heard it quite a while
i ago.
Third: The Daily carried a long
article on Thursday's front page, be
moaning the tactics of a Hearst
paper for butchering the meaning of
a Daily editorial. In the words of
j the great Chinese philosopher, Ling
Po, it would appear that we are all

tarred with the same stick.
More -seriously, I'd like to ques
tion McClelland's stand on devel
opments of technology. Arc we
justified in slowing down the devel
opment of automatic production ma
chinery because it puts men out of
work, when people are suffering
privations and stai'vation for lack of
the products. Maybe there is some
thing else wrong along the line.
