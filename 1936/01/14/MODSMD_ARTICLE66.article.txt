The Editor, Sir:
By all means let's take Bobby
Grayson's number out of circula
tion. Then because we forgot it
when Bill Corbus made all-Ameri
can, let's take his out. Then be
cause they played su«h a good game,
let's take out the numbers of every
one who played in the Rose Bowl.
Of course if we keep this up we
won't have any numbers left in a
couple of years. The players will
have to use letters. Then with a
six-man line we might have some
such line-up as "PHOOEY."
Patriotic
Yes, the musit; goes 'round and
'round, too.—Ed.
