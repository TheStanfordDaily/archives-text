"SPLENDOR"
At the California
C Rachel Crothers' first
scenario, without any ob
vious defects, is still third
rate entertainment. Perhaps
Miss Crothers is not yet familiar
enough with cinema technique to
write such hits as she has done for
the stage. "Splendor" is neither
brilliant nor, on the other hand,
moving—though it attempts to be
both.
Lavishly produced by Samuel
Goldwyn and capably enacted by
an excellent cast that includes Mir
iam Hopkins, Helen Westley, Ruth
Weston, Paul Cavanagh, Katherine
Alexander, Joel McCrea, and Billie
Burke, "Splendor" is the story of a
young wife who insures her hus
band's success by being over-nice
to his boss.
It is doubtful if Mr. Goldwyn will
Ret back much of the $750,000 the
film cost him.

"MARCHING! MARCHING!" by
Clara Wealherwax (John Day)
If this work is an attempt at lit
erature, it is a cowardly one. The
author, finding herself unable to
adapt conventional English prose to
her theme, has joined the "modern"
school of writing—that staccato
hodge-podge originated by Hem
ingway and Stein when they dis
covered their inability to grasp the
basic principles of grammar.
This style makes slow reading,
which in "Marching! Marching!" is
only occasionally offset by flashes
of powerful writing.
Typical of American proletarian
novels is the plot. A Northwest
logging community is moved to
strike by the heartless cruelty of
Lumber Baron Bayliss. No one hero
is presented—the reader is made to
understand that every man stained
with the sweat of honest toil pos
sesses nobility of character, un
stinting generosity, and courageous
foresight. Naturally, all other char
acters are rotten, corrupt, cowardly,
and despicable, whether they be
"bosses," judges, police chiefs, or
collegians.
"Marching! Marching!" is too one
sided to be convincing, too strongly
worded to be enjoyable reading. It
indicates that THE American pro

letarian novel is still in the distant
future.
Miss Weatherwax, a Stanford stu
dent for two years, presumably
wrote this, her first novel, to win
the New Masses-John Day $750
prize for a novel on an American
proletarian theme. In this, at least,
she succeeded. —Bernhard
