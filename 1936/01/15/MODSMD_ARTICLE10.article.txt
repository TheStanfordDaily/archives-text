# Louise Boyd Gives Picture Of Northland
## Photographic Slides Used by Arctic Explorer To Illustrate Lecture 
### 
j Miss Louise A. Boyd, noted Arc-
I tic explorer whose name has been
Riven to a section of East Greenland
j by the Danish government, gave her
I Assembly Hall lecture audience a
| conception of the appearance of her
! land travels last night when she
i said that "the fiord region of East
Greenland, with its vari-colorcd
strata of ice, transcends even the
Grand Canyon in beauty and
! grandeur."
The explorer, who illustrated her
talk with photographic slides, gave
a sketch of her earlier trips and a
detailed account of her last expedi
tion, made in the summer of 1933
under the auspices of the American
Geographical Society of New York.
"The trip was made," Miss Boyd
said, "during an 80-day period. We
j were fortunate in being able to ob-
I serve the end of one winter, with
! the resulting breaking and melting
of ice, and the beginning of another,
which almost locked us in the vast
fiord region of East Greenland."
Although Miss Boyd has had no
I specific scientific training, she has
i contributed much to the accurate
| definition of coast outlines of East
I Greenland through her photo
| graphs, which have been used in
the making of official maps.
