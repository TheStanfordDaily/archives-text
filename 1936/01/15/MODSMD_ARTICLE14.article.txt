# Hauptmann Refused Writ to Stay Execution
## Bruno's Last Hope Is Supreme Court Action 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 11 (/f-)â€”
Bruno Richard Hauptmann moved
another step nearer the elcctric
chair tonight when a federal
judge refused to grant him a
habeas corpus writ or to stay his
execution set for Friday night.
But even as this avenue of escape
was closed, the man condemned to
die for the Lindbergh baby kidnap
murder was given hope for a few
more days of life by a report Gov
ernor Hoffman would grant a re
prieve.
Rejecting all of the arguments of
defense counsel that Hauptmann's
trial at Flemington was surrounded
by prejudicial influences. United
States Circuit Court Judge J. War
ren Davis said that to grant the
writ he would have to over-rule
both the New Jersey Court of Er
rors and Appeals and the United
States Supreme Court.
Despair was written on the faces
of the defense lawyers as they left
the courtroom.
"That is the end," said one, who
would not be quoted by name.
"The only possibility in the world
is the United States Supreme Court,"
said Neil Burkinshaw, a Washington
lawyer just added to the defense
staff in a fiml effort to save Haupt
mann.
Before going to the hearing and
branding tin writ application
signed by Hauptmann in his death
cell "a subterfuge and fraud," At
torney General David T. Wilcnlz,
said he had "reliable information"
Governor Hoffman would grant a
reprieve.
The chief prosecutor of Haupt
mann made the statement to mem
bers of the Legislative Appropria
tions Committee, and added if such
action were taken he would need
additional funds to fight, the case.
