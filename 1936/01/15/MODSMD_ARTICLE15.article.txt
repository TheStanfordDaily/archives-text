# Asbestos Roof Cuts Noises in Cellar
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
An airplane propeller is noisy, but
did you know that a good soup
gargler in (he Union Cellar is almost
as bad, that a pneumatic riveter
runs second to a loud-sacking kiss,
that the noise made by a knife
while sliding over your teeth makes
a ten-ton truck sound life a deaf
mute with moccasins?
Just ask Mr. Robert Telser of
the American Asbestos Company.
He's tbe man who found out just
bow noisy our Union Cellar was
by testing the consumption of 25
35-cent lunches (with apologies to
the American Student Union)
with bis Jnhns-Manville Sound
meter. It was on his recommenda
tion that Miss flicker installed the
sound-absorbing ceiling that keeps
our campus "food-fount" from
sounding like a New York subway
at 5:15.
He found that we were absorbing
not only luncheonettes, but an aver
age of 65 to 80 decibels (units of
noise) in the process. And that
much noise Is equivalent to a pneu
matic pavemerl-breaker, or an En
cina door-slamming, or the Daily
Editor when he reads this feature.

When Socratcs, our favorite
waiter, drops a plate, he makes SO
decibels .just by that graceful
j gesture. The cash register, in case
| you didn't know, is one of the
] noisiest parts of the whole Union
j Machine. On a 45-ccnt special
I breakfast, paid with yesterday's
left-over change, it surpasses it
self with a rating of about flft deci- j
bels, more noise than three Wf'A
crews on the San Francisco Air
port.
' "Of course," Mr. Telser pointed !
out, "all these comparisons of kisses,
for instance, arc accurate only with- j
in the Union. I wouldn't hazard a
guess as to their decibei rating out- [
of-doors on, say Governor's Lane.
"My job, anyway, was to re
duce noises while eating. The
sound-absorbing board rcduccd
j noise intensity by 7X per cent, or
by seven decibels. The time pe
riod of reverberation was re
duced from a computed three
seconds to .(»<> seconds.
"Now, I understand, the students
think the food is bcl tcr. That's not
scientifically accurate. It wasn't the
food that was responsible for pc—
' riodic indigestion, but the noise."
