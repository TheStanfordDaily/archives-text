## $500 Given to Student Aid Commission; Proposal of Honoring Grayson Tabled 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Ex C ommittcc awarded $500 to the Student Aid Commission, and
$2."> to the Speakers' Bureau budget, granted over S3 sports awards, and
tabled nine measures, among which was the proposal to honor Bobby
Grayson's jersey, at its regular meeting last night.

That nameless child of adversity,
The Daily's Honest Injun, will not
be recognized by Ex Committee un
til he gets himself a name.
Members High-hat
Committee members declined to
consider the edit page wax-worker
as an official mascot of the student
body until the current contcst ele
vates him to a respectable status.
Committee c pinion was generally
adverse to the proposition to place
Grayson's football jersey in the En
cina Gym trophy room, and with
draw his number "22" from further
use.
Oppose Jersey Plan
"We had a team there with seven
players that might be considered
just as deserving," suggested Presi
dent Wally Brooke.
Jones interpolated that Grayson
whs recognized throughout the na
tion as an outstanding player.
Frank Fullenwider pointed out
that this honor can be given only
a few times in the history of the
school or it becomes an empty one.
"Nothing we can do or cannot do
will ever affect Grayson's fame one
way or the other," he said.
Net result was that a committee
of Dinty Moore and Sterling Cot
trell was appointed to sound out stu
dent opinion and develop some
means of honoring not only Grayson
but also other members of the fa
mous "vow team." A plaque, blan
ket, or trophy to be displayed in the
New Theater was suggested by
Brooke.
A TROPHY CASE in which to
place this and other trophies of cur
rent interest was advocated by
Brooke.
"Women aren't allowed to go over
to the men's gym and pry around,"
said Brooke. "Cops are always in
the Old Union chasing bums out,
and a trophy case wouldn't be safe
here." He showed how the Admin
istration Building, the Library, and
other campus gathering places
would be unsatisfactory.
Someone suggested that the Axe
case in the Cellar might bo vacant
next. year.
Brooke answered that one: "We
can always handle another case."
The installing of a built-in case in
the New Theater will be suggested
to Comptroller Almon E. Roth.
FOOTBALL LETTERS were
granted to 18 players, but four spe
cial awards to Frank Alustiza, Ray
Todd, Alex Trompas and Fred Wil
liams were tabled because of con
stitutional difficulties. Stormy
wea'her and rushing precented a full
Cx Committee attendance last night.
The A.S.S.U. constitution requires a
separate by-law passed by nine
members to grant more than one
football award on the basis of ex
ceptional merit.
OTHER AWARDS were given for
varsity and freshman water poio,
varsity and freshman soccer, and
cross-country. The one exceptional
award in soccer was granted to
Miguel Gomez.
BARNSTORMERS, embryonic
campus dramatic society, has yet to
face legislative scrutiny before it
will be recognized. Dramatic Coun
cil minutes mentioning Barnstorm
ers were reviewed by the committee,
but a survey of other dramatic so
cieties and a general statement of
purpose will be required before
full status is given.
ALso tabled were several amend
ments to the Dramatic Council |
charter providing for filling of va
cancies in the dramatic manager's
office by the council.
THE STUDENT AID FUND got
its $500 as a second installment of
the regular $1,000 student grant
Student Manager Bob Gros pointed
out that only $500 was given to the
fund last fall when it was not known
that the A.S.S.U. budget would bear
the larger expenditure.
THE SPEAKERS' BUREAU re
ceived its $25 in order to give it a
working budget for office expenses.
THE DAILY FEE of 15 cents was
not considered last night. Gros re
quested more time to investigate i
the effect the fee has on A.S.S.U.
finances.
QUADS PROPOSAL to juggle!
$78 from the building to the gen
eral fund met a cool reception. At
Gros' request the measure was |
tabled.
GRANTING DATES stirred some
emotion in Ex Committee breasts !
for the first time in history. The

rubber stamp got past the joint Phi
Psi and Fiji olt-< ainpus dance and
the Chi O formal, but it drew up
with a jerk when Fullenwider dis
covered that the Lagunita women
had scheduled another jolly-up i'or
the same time the graduate women
had planned one.
Fullenwider was immediately
dubbed the defender of the graduate
women by his colleagues, who in
timated that he was leading a
double life. Betty Grover said he
probably wanted to be both places
at once, and Gros ejaculated: "Now,
if you'd only start going steady with
somebody!"
The result was that the matter
was tabled.
