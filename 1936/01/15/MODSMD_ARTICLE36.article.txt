# "STUDENT OPINION" LAUDED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is a fine thing for a minority
group to be uble to publish a paper
as the American Student Union is
doing here. However, I would like
to make a few suggestions to the
editors, whoever they may be.
First, I should like to know who
edits and writes the paper. Second,
I would like to know if the editors
will welcome comments and re
marks from the student body, and,
if so, where ihese should be sent.
As to the first issue, I think that
the paper would be more effective if
less space was devoted to self-justi
fication. I would rather see the writ
er praise the Union for its improve
ments than emphasize the fact that
the American Student Union forced
them to institute these changes, even
if such was actually the case.
I see no reason why this group
should try to convey the impression
in their organ that they are subject
to persecution and must work in a
semi-secret manner. Let them for
get the past and build a concrete
record of achievements for the Stu

! dent Body to judge them by. An un
selfish minority group, interested in
social improvements and in telling
the truth as they see it, after care
ful consideration of all the elements
involved, and not at all interested in
drawing attention to itself, can be
a valuable asset to this University.
