### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (/P).â€”How
ard Hughes, lanky young million
aire Hollywood wore
nonchalantly the crown of the na
tion's aerial speed king tonight.
Unheralded, he dropped down at
Newark airport shortly after mid
night with a new non-stop trans
continental speed mark in his grasp,
a mark bettering by approximately
35 minutes the existing record of
Colonel Roscoe E. Turner.
