With the football season safely in
the bag and spring on the way, Bill
Paulman is among the tryoutees for
the 1936 track team. Last year, as a
freshman, he tossed the javelin ]. r >o
feet, and has already bettered that
mark this year.

For fifty years armed cossacks
stood guard over each of the 100
lanterns presented to the city of
Navo Cherkash.
