LETS GET INTO
THE OPEN
In yesterday's editorial columns
The Daily .spoke forth its stand on
the subsidization-of-athletes move
merit. In effect, this was the con
tent of that edit.
American football at present
stands on the middleground be
tween complete subsidization and
commercialization on the one
hand, and complete amateurism
on the other. Football started at
the amateur end and appears to
he working toward the profes
sional set-up. Right now, it's in
between.
Now the question is: Shall we
keep on the path toward complete
subsidization or turn back toward
the starting point, complete ama
teurism?
The Daily advocates the "turn
ing back" policy and the setting up
ol a high ethical goal as the desired
end. But that task of merely lay
ing down a goal and pointing toward
it is really the second step. First of
all football must come out in the
open. That will be the more dilli
cult of the two.
Nearly every large college and
university in the country that par
ticipates at ali strenuously in foot
hall is in one way or another guil
ty of subsidization.
It may be a very mild form, or it
may be actual paying of salaries to
athletes. But be it either kind or in
between, seldom are declarations
made openly. However, it is gen
erally understood that such pro
ceedings are going on.
IT MUST BE
UNANIMOUS
Last year San Jose State came out
openly and announced a plan of
subsidization under which athletes
would lie taken care of financially
while attending that institution.
After that move several of San
Jose's opponents dropped her from
their schedules.
Thus it appears that no one
school can come out and declare a
position as regards subsidization.
However, if every institution de
clared itself openly, and you and
I know that a lot of declaring
would be done in some cases, then
everyone would be in the same
boat. There could be no schedule
breaking.
It stands as fact, however',' that
before we can take a course in
either direction we must admit our
position now. And to do that we
must throw off all the hypocrisy that
surrounds each individual school
and its subsidization measures.
After a nation-wide declara
tion of policies is made by each
individual institution (with 110
exceptions), and those policies are
