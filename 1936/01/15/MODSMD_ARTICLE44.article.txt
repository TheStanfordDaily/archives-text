# Moore Returns to Lineup for Bear Tilt
## Robertson, Calderwood Vie for Guard Position 
### 
While travel-weary Bears were
acclimating themselves to the fast
nesses of their Berkeley campus
yesterday afternoon after a pro
longed cross-country trek, Ihe local
hoop forces of Coach John Bunn
were busy.
Not that Coacli John's lanky
lads were partaking of any un
foreseen advantages, but they
were indeed losing no time in
rooking up a savory reception
with which io greet the Berkeley
ites two evenings hence. To a man,
the Redshirls were bale and
hearty, I)inty Moore's alleged
shoulder injury having turned out
to be a false alarm.
Although Sparky Robertson and
Jack Calderwood were drilled at
both of the guard posts when Moore
failed to report Monday afternoon,
they confined their activities yes
terday to alternating at the left
berth only, with Captain Dinty
holding down his regular position.
Third-stringers were still supplying
the offensive tactics as Bunn con
centrated on the grouping of his
new defense system.
Defense came in for the most
attention, with the chief activity
centering about Hank Luisetti,
one of the mainstays of the In
dian outfit. Luisetti, incidentally,
now ranks third among high scor
ers of the southern division. Coast
conference. He is credited with
27 tallies and is followed by his
team-mate, Howell Turner, who
has garnered 24 points.
After getting in the third squad's
hair defensively during the greater
part of the afternoon, the tables
were reversed in short order and
the first and second teams unleashed
their attacks. Thus they gained
some revenge by scoring for a
while instead of defending.
