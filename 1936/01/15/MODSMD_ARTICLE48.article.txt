# Pitchers Work Out For Ball Season
## 
### 
With all but one varsity baseball
practice rained out, Coach Harry
Wolter has been giving pitchers
short daily workouts in preparation
for the opening of the league season
February 11 against Santa Clara.
Wolter is optimistic over the large
squad, but as most of the team will
have to be picked from new mate
rial, he is anxious to get a line on
new men as soon as possible. Sev
eral pre-season practice games are
being considered in order to get the
men ready for the still conference
schedule.
