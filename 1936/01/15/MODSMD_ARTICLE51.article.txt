# Athletic Board Faces Charge
## "Ring" Editor Reveals Commissioner Corrupt 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 14 (£>).—The
New York S;;.te Athletic Commis
sion, at a sizzling session today,
launched an investigation into
charges that ?. member of its .staff
openly connived with the gambling
element in New York fight clubs.
Nat Fleischer, editor of the Ring,
a boxing magazine, appeared before
the commission to repeat charges
made in a radio blast last week.
He said an investigation, made at
the request of fight fans, revealed
that one of the commissioner s in
spectors placed bets with gamblers
after ascertaining how the eommis- |
sion's judges were scoring the fight. {
Fleischer said his radio address
was not aimed at the individual
honesty of the commissioners, but
at its general inefficiency and flag
rant favoritism, brought to a head
last week by its refusal to license
Hank Bath of California to fight
Red Bur man.
"Get away from those trivial
ities." ordered Commissioner Hill
Brown. "You have made a serious
charge against a member of our

staff and put the man in question
and the entire commission under
a cloud. That is what we want
explained."
Fleischer said that after his in
vestigation he had informed Hrowi
as to the identity of the inspectui
with specific charges.
