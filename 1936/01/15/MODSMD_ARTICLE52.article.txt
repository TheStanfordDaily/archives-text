# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Less Verbosity, More Timeliness Might Shake Student Apathy to Outside World 
### 
By decrying the verbosity of the average
too-academic textbook and claiming that if
the volumes were boiled down and written in
Time magazine's terse, interesting style they
would he read and comprehended more thor
oughly by more Stanford students, Mr. Eisen
bach brings up an interesting point in Bull
Session.
Mr. Eisenbach's assertions are painfully
true. Some of the more brilliant professors
are possibly over-conscious of their reputa
tions as international authorities in their
field.
This brings on a double complication—
they use too many words to explain technical
details that make the topic "completely com
prehensive and largely incomprehensible";
moreover, they tend to "shy away" from com
mitting themselves on matters of contem
porary concern, "until they are able to make
a thorough study of the matter."
And yet they must realize that students
are entirely ignorant of current affairs. The
excuse: by the time studies and extra-curricu
lar activities are disposed of, there is no fur
ther time nor desire for critical reading of
newspapers, periodicals, and other literature
that might give them an understanding of
present national and international problems.
This excuse has its points, but it is not
complete justification, when it is considered

that these same students, some this year,
nearly all of them within four years, will
make their way into the unfamiliar outside
world, headed for the "leadership of tomor
row."
The situation is far too complicated to be
righted merely by making a knowledge of
contemporary affairs compulsory, or by tell
ing ,'JNO() students that they "ought to take
an interest in the outside."
However, when a student in a purported
educational institution like Stanford remarks,
in all seriousness, "I don't see how the Su
preme Court can declare the American Auto
mobile Association (AAA) unconstitutional,"
undergraduate disinterest would seem to be
at an unhealthy st age.
More courses that attempt to interpret mod
ern occurrences might help. A more practical,
less academic consideration of problems of
international or national concern to be given
when they arise and are still timely, in al
ready established courses—certainly would.
Professors might even go so far as to budget
one or two lectures to "emergency topics."
Mr. Eisenbach's suggestion for Time-style
textbooks has its points; furthermore, a slight
sacrifice of comprehensive accuracy for clar
ity, interest, and information might be a
worthwhile innovation in the lecture as well
as in the textbook.

prehensive and largely incomprehensible";
moreover, they tend to "shy away" from com
mitting themselves on matters of contem
porary concern, "until they are able to make
a thorough study of the matter."
And yet they must realize that students
are entirely ignorant of current affairs. The
excuse: by the time studies and extra-curricu
lar activities are disposed of, there is no fur
ther time nor desire for critical reading of
newspapers, periodicals, and other literature
that might give them an understanding of
present national and international problems.
This excuse has its points, but it is not
complete justification, when it is considered

that these same students, some this year,
nearly all of them within four years, will
make their way into the unfamiliar outside
world, headed for the "leadership of tomor
row."
The situation is far too complicated to be
righted merely by making a knowledge of
contemporary affairs compulsory, or by tell
ing ,'JNO() students that they "ought to take
an interest in the outside."
However, when a student in a purported
educational institution like Stanford remarks,
in all seriousness, "I don't see how the Su
preme Court can declare the American Auto
mobile Association (AAA) unconstitutional,"
undergraduate disinterest would seem to be
at an unhealthy st age.
More courses that attempt to interpret mod
ern occurrences might help. A more practical,
less academic consideration of problems of
international or national concern to be given
when they arise and are still timely, in al
ready established courses—certainly would.
Professors might even go so far as to budget
one or two lectures to "emergency topics."
Mr. Eisenbach's suggestion for Time-style
textbooks has its points; furthermore, a slight
sacrifice of comprehensive accuracy for clar
ity, interest, and information might be a
worthwhile innovation in the lecture as well
as in the textbook.
By decrying the verbosity of the average
too-academic textbook and claiming that if
the volumes were boiled down and written in
Time magazine's terse, interesting style they
would he read and comprehended more thor
oughly by more Stanford students, Mr. Eisen
bach brings up an interesting point in Bull
Session.
Mr. Eisenbach's assertions are painfully
true. Some of the more brilliant professors
are possibly over-conscious of their reputa
tions as international authorities in their
field.
This brings on a double complication—
they use too many words to explain technical
details that make the topic "completely com
prehensive and largely incomprehensible";
moreover, they tend to "shy away" from com
mitting themselves on matters of contem
porary concern, "until they are able to make
a thorough study of the matter."
