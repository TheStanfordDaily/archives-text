## 
### 
One month from today, Stanford's new
Memorial Hall is to he dedicated, according
to tentative plans. The ground-breaking was
unattended by ceremony, and the coining
laying of the cornerstone will be the first op
portunity for student interest in the new the
ater to be publicly expressed.
Plans for the dedication have been under
way for three months, and no excuse for a
second-rate performance should be allowed to
stand. After years of struggle to obtain a
theater, and after paying dollars toward its
realization, students have the right to expect
a satisfactory dedication.
Because this is Stanford's largest building
program sinee the original University build
ings, Stanford should dedicate it impressively.
Because this is about the only satisfaction
seniors and others, who have long worked for
a theater, will get out of it, the dedication
should be reasonably lively.
Foundation and framework of the theater
should be ready at the site at the time of the
ceremony. It is the part of the arranging
committee, however, to see that adequate
sealing, a good address system, and a suitable
platform are ready.
By starting Ibis far in advance the distaste
ful slight possibility of a poor ceremony, in
sullieient seating, or inadequate surroundings
can be obviated, and Stanford can enjoy a
dedication of which it can at least be proud
and which will at the same time entertain her
students.
