BOOM!
CKASSSSSSSII!
BANG!
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop.
Today is the day of silence.
All day today Robleites will forget thnt sororities
exist and Row women will forget that there are nug
gets in Hoble. Tomorrow they'll be sure of it.
The person who thought that women, sorority or
hall, could keep quiet a whole day was an unregen
erate optimist.
Tliis rule against women smoking during rushing
is really an effective piece of legislation. Our Hasher
interviewed a sorority woman on the subject-
Hash: "Do you do any smoking during rushing?"
Woman: "We do. The freshmen don't."
For this week only—while thiy last—Our Hasher
comes out in defense of the Stanford women, fresh
man and otherwise, who have been subject to calumny
in this and adjacent columns at one time or another.
Popular opinion to the contrary, the arrival of the
additional 500 did not lower class averages but raised
them. Since 1000 women from California's select hi«h
schools seem to be smarter than 3000 men from Cali
fornia's select country clubs. So we have Stanford
women to thank for the high class averages, the cold
shoulder of lamb, the filling of Lagunita every year,
the usual wrecks on the Bayshore and in Roble Lobby,
and the premier introduction of the Union lock-out and
BOYcott.
But lor' bless 'em, we LOVE them—if wc can.
