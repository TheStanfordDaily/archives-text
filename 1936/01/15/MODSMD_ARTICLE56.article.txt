# Bull Session
## BIRDS OF A FEATHER, HONEST! 
### 
It was a terrific party; so 1 sat down.
To my left was one of San Francisco's most prom
inent stock brokers, to my right was one of Califor
nia's most successful industrialists, and in the center
was a Stanford incubator-baby.
"What do you think of Roosevelt?" they asked me.
And since they lacked the conservative commercial
pot-belly and Republican bald-pate, I warmed to my
song and dance, viz., that (on the one hand) while 1
favored Roosevelt's policies in theory, believed his
ideas of industrial control were good on paper and
inevitable in machine civilization, I didn't like his
methods.
Whereupon, their eyebrows turned up, their heads
cocked with a sort of ominous quizzicality, and they
said, "Are you a Communist?" I buried my despairing,
"It isn't possible!" in clouds of cigarette smoke and
frantic shakings of a lighted match.

Commentators have declared that their reaction is
more or less prevalent among a vast number of entre
preneurs. Analyzed, it shows not only that business
hates Roosevelt, but that business recoils against any
suggestion that laissez-faire isn't what it's cracked
up to be. Suffice it to say that these gentlemen asked
me the most insulting question they could think of.
They asked me if I were a Communist!

But entirely aside from what business is hating,
the point is that it doesn't have its hates. Though
it prides itself on its amenability to reason, on its devo
tion to practical thought, it is prejudiced, often com
pletely, irrevocably, and blindly, to anything which
doesn't agree letter for letter with its own concep
tions of what business ought to do and have done to it.

Hates, however, are not a luxury. Identifying
themselves with the same army of ethical belliger
ants are certain radical groups.
Similarly, they would cry "dirty capitalist" at any
one of their tong who would dare suggest that the
"world revolution" might be a peaceable affair, that
the entrepreneur, too, is entitled to a share of the
increments of production, that what Karl Marx be
lieved was beaten out of the workers and called profit,
is not profit at all, but the wage of the manager. .
The obvious inference has also occurred to others:
that what is wrong with our civilization is not a
multiplicity of theories, but the stubbornness of their
adherents, not the varying conceptions of how to pro
duce and distribute, almost invariably conceived by
mild-mannered and peaceful philosophers, but the
belligerency of those insisting that their particular
social and and economic faith is the word of Nature's
invisible and omnipotent Messiah.

In short, it would behoove capital and labor, the
Constitutionalists and the anti-Ccnstitutionalists, and,
may we add, Bill Millis and the Ex Committee, to
forget what they are loving and hating :n the way of
social belief, and accurately deteiniinc what they are
loving and hating in the way of social results.
For if all the grim panoply of the labor-capitalist
fight were stripped away, the essential units of the
fighters' diverse aims would be amazing.
