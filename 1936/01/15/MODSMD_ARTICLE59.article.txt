# Reviewer's Bawl-Out
## NEW RECORDINGS 
### 
Two new tunes by Brooks Bow
man from the new Princeton show
are "I Shan't Love You Any More"
and '"Love Will Not Die," recorded
by Hal Kemp on Brunswick 7578.
The former is a clever, sprightly
tune that will be as popular as the
composer's "Love and a Dime." The
latter, unfortunately, is insipid.
Freddie Martin does "Just One of
Those Things," Cole Porter's "Ju
bilee" tune, with a suave orchestra
tion that can't be beat on Bruns
wick 7579. "Lights Out," the coup
ling, also gets that smooth Martin
treatment.
Eddie Paul's orchestra does "Moon
Over Miami" in a Noble-ish man
ner on Melotone 6-02-05. Johnny
Hauser does the vocal, and gets a
nice backing from the orchestra.
The coupling is "With All My
Heart," from "Her Master's Voice."
The best arrangement yet of "I
Dream Too Much" is that of Jimmy
Calf's orchestra on Melotone 6-01-
09. It's a dreamy waltz in perfect
tempo. Coupled with it is a good
arrangement of "I'm the Echo" from
the same picture.
A1 Donohue's recordings of "How
Do I Rate with You" and "You Took
My Breath Away" on Decca 6MO are,
in addition to being neat orches
trations, technically the best jobs
Dccca has turned out. And they re
introduce the swell baritone voice of
Barry McKinley.
Louis Armstrong does an amus
ing number called "Old Man Mose"
on Decca 622. Mostly vocal. Rich
ard Himber's theme song, "Was I To
Blame for Falling in Love with
You?" gets the Armstrong treat
ment in the coupling.
Bi.ng Crosby does two new tunes
from the movie version of "Any
thing Goes" which Cole Porter did
NOT write.
"My Heart and I," a nice tunc,
slow and sentimental; and "Sailor
Beware," a sprightly tune done with
Crosby's peculiar type of jollity—on
Dccca 631.

ing number called "Old Man Mose"
on Decca 622. Mostly vocal. Rich
ard Himber's theme song, "Was I To
Blame for Falling in Love with
You?" gets the Armstrong treat
ment in the coupling.
Bi.ng Crosby does two new tunes
from the movie version of "Any
thing Goes" which Cole Porter did
NOT write.
"My Heart and I," a nice tunc,
slow and sentimental; and "Sailor
Beware," a sprightly tune done with
Crosby's peculiar type of jollity—on
Dccca 631.

GARMISCH PARTENKIRCIIEN,
Germany, Jan. 14 (/P). —Two mem
bers of an international skiing party
were buried alive by a vast alpine
avalanche near this Olympic settle
ment today.
Kansas University students have
petitioned authorities to change their
B:3C o'clock classes back to 8 o'clock.
Two new tunes by Brooks Bow
man from the new Princeton show
are "I Shan't Love You Any More"
and '"Love Will Not Die," recorded
by Hal Kemp on Brunswick 7578.
The former is a clever, sprightly
tune that will be as popular as the
composer's "Love and a Dime." The
latter, unfortunately, is insipid.
Freddie Martin does "Just One of
Those Things," Cole Porter's "Ju
bilee" tune, with a suave orchestra
tion that can't be beat on Bruns
wick 7579. "Lights Out," the coup
ling, also gets that smooth Martin
treatment.
Eddie Paul's orchestra does "Moon
Over Miami" in a Noble-ish man
ner on Melotone 6-02-05. Johnny
Hauser does the vocal, and gets a
nice backing from the orchestra.
The coupling is "With All My
Heart," from "Her Master's Voice."
The best arrangement yet of "I
Dream Too Much" is that of Jimmy
Calf's orchestra on Melotone 6-01-
09. It's a dreamy waltz in perfect
tempo. Coupled with it is a good
arrangement of "I'm the Echo" from
the same picture.
A1 Donohue's recordings of "How
Do I Rate with You" and "You Took
My Breath Away" on Decca 6MO are,
in addition to being neat orches
trations, technically the best jobs
Dccca has turned out. And they re
introduce the swell baritone voice of
Barry McKinley.
Louis Armstrong does an amus
ing number called "Old Man Mose"
on Decca 622. Mostly vocal. Rich
ard Himber's theme song, "Was I To
Blame for Falling in Love with
You?" gets the Armstrong treat
ment in the coupling.
