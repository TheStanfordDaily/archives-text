# Stanford Cagers Face Hard Fight in Tangle With Bears Tomorrow
## Cards Have First Real Opportunity In Eleven Years To Gain Hoop Title 
### Herb Diamond 
It lias been bandied about locally that tomorrow evening's first en
counter of the I!>.*>(» Big (iaine hoop scries looms as the most significant,
if not the tightest, struggle this season.
Consensus of opinion has it that way—and supports the contention for
more than a few logical reasons. To begin with, when the Indians tangle

with the Bears tomorrow night it<
will be the first real opportunity in |
11 years for the former. Coach John
Bunn's machine will be out to waste
no time in wresting from the Berke
leyites their time-honored suprem
acy.
Chief among other reasons is
the fact that only the winner in
tomorrow night's affair will re
main in the southern division of
the Coast Conference as a leading
contender for the 1936 crown.
The Bears, having dropped their
lirst two conference tests against
U.S.C. after a relatively unsuc
cessful barnstorming tour, will
doubtless be bent upon gaining
some of their lost ground.
The Indians, on the other hand,
still smarting over the short end of
a score handed them by U.C.L.A.
last Saturday night, need a tri
umph over the Californians. They
must drub the Berkeleyites before
they can do any more aspiring, at
least wherein the conference crown
is concerned.
Coach Nibs Price's lads will pit
the same powerful olTcnse that
thundered over the Cal Aggies
Tuesday night against -an im- j
proved Redskin quintet in tomor
row night's clash. In practice j
lately he has given rather little at
tention to the defense system that
has bolstered Cal tactics for these
many years.
Here on the Farm, however, Bunn
has been drilling his hardwood aces I
on defense lepeatedly during the
past week. His newly devised sys
tem has successfully repelled third
string onslaughts. But, of course,
the real worth of the Indians' im
proved methods can only be judged
when they swing into action tomor
row night.
The complete squad ran through I
yesterday afternoon's drill in re
assuring form. Equal time and at
tention were devoted to attack
and defense; the exact details of
neither, however, are to be di
vulged publicly. It is only pointed
mit once again that if smooth func
tioning is indicative, the Rcdshirts
are well fortified. And their de
fense shouldn't he found lacking
tomorrow night.
Like his gridiron colleague, Stub
Allison, Price was reported v/ell on
his way yesterday fearing Stanford j
in general, i'nd Hank Luisetti in j
particular. Between grave prcdic- !
lions of impending danger, the Ber- j
keley mentor found time to name |
his starting line-up for the conflict, j
He revealed 'hat Captain Olson and
Rathbone will start as forwards; j
Carlisle is to be at center; and Jen
sen and Herwig will see action at
the guard posts.
The Stanford line-up reads as
follows: Luisetti and Turner, for
wards; Stoofen, center; Calderwood
and Captain Moore, guards. For j
the first time in many moons Stan- j
ford bids fair to be favored over the j
Bears tomorrow night, inasmuch as j
U.C. will not be represented by one !
of its great teams. The Indians, how- i
ever, arc impeded by no such ob- |
stacle.

According to Frank Lloyd
Wright, long the storm center of
American architecture, America
suffers from "too much so-called
education."
