# Psych Prof Invents New Shorthand

### Margaret Loud 
"Notescript," a book on a new
system of shorthand, by Professor
J. E. Coover of the Stanford psy
chology and jxsychical research de
partment, will be printed soon by an
eastern publisher. Professor Coover
has devised notescript to supplant
some of the shorthand systems now
in use.
Thore have been innumerable
methods of taking down verbatim
records of speeches, Coover says,
dating as far back as the Roman
method in 60 8.C., and about 500
systems of shorthand. Shorthand as
we recognize it appeared about 1841
in England and gradually gave way
to the present Gregg system.
"The trouble with all these sys
tems." claims Coover, "is cither
that they take too long to learn or
that they are too hard to decipher
after they have been written."
The advantages of notescript are
that it is easy to learn and that it
has a degree of legibility never at
tained before. It is based on a
consonant skeleton and has points
or dashes for vowels. Though it is
not so short as other systems, it is
easy to read.
Thus, a student can take lec
ture notes In notescript and after-

wards read them with little dilli
culty, the necessity of transpos
ing shorthand to longhand having
been eliminated altogether.
In addition to notcscript, Profes
sor Coover has invented a new
method of learning typewriting, a
by-product of his work in psychical
research, based on the principle of
kinesthetic perception.
Kinesthetic perception simply
means that instead of learning the
position of individual keys on the
typewriter by sight or by touch,
the pupil learns a different finger
motion for each letter. Not until
motions for the whole alphabet
have been mastered does lie start
to hit typewriter keys, where his
fingers fall naturally into place.
Coover has formulated his now
typewriting process after spending
years studying the performances of
various speed typists and observing
that all their errors arise from bad
habits formed in learning.
"In the method of kinesthetic per
ception," said Coover, "I boheve I
have found a iaw to which all indi
vidualr arc subject., regardless of
their differences. For the first time,
a scientific technique for typewrit
ing has been developed."
