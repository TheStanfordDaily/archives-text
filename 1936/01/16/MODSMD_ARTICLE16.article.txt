Sigma Chi fraternity last night
was apparently made the goat of
a defective rushing system. The
harsh penalty was a challenge to
the condemned fraternity to bust
wide open a fraternity situation
that sporadically threatens to up
set the Row equilibrium.
The fraternity happened to be
turned in as an example of a sys
tem that needed immediate at
tention. To get at the bottom of
the situation, the board made a
martyr of one of the houses.
No fraternity will deliberately
rush illegally; probably the ma
jority of them, however, have
been forced by an apparently de
fective system to evade the rules
in some cases if they had hoped
to get a pledge class.
Sigma Chi, however, was turned
in. What will happen next is a
question. To penalize a fraternity
in such an apparently harsh move
two days before formal initiation
outwardly seems like crucifying
the members of a house merely
to find out what's wrong with a
system.
