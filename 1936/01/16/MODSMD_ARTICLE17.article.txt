The Stanford Daily marches
on! Gentlemen, herewith we pre
sent the weather.
While the San Francisco weath
er man leered at sodden skies and
predicted continued unsettled
weather for today, unsettled Stan
ford students splashed, ducked,
and mudhenncd to their 8 o'clocks.
High government officials to the
contrary, I>ake Lagunita is slowly
filling up. At a late hour last
night, the waters had risen to
within six yards of the hoathousc
landings. The weather man's pre
dictions suggest that Stanford men
and maids will be falling out of
canoes before the end of the
month.
