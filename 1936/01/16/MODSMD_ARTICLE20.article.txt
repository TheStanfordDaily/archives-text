###

J by fraternity representatives.
Specific violation involved an off
| campus party, which is prohibited
j by rushing rules.
j The motion of the board is "That
j no members of the present lower
I division subject to present rushing
j rules can be pledged or initiated by
[ Sigma Chi fraternity until the be
i ginning of the winter quarter of the
| academic year 1936-37."
Although no other meeting of
the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol is scheduled until next Tues

their opinion rushing rules had
worked this year, but some faculty
