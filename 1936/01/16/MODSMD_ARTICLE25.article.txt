# Bonus Payment Not Economic Issue, Says Haley
## Government Could Bear Extra Expense, Not Political Pressure for Like Benefits 
### Leonard Blaikie 
Immediate payment of a bonus to veterans of the World War is an
issue of greater political than economic significance, according to Profes
sor Bernard Haley, executive head of the Department of Economics.
Reviewing the provisions of a bill now before Congress which pro
vides for immediate redemption of 20-year endowment insurance poh
■ ies u ued January 1, 1925, Profes- ♦

sor Haley declares that the govern
ment would probably be able to
bear the extra $2,000,000,000 public
debt which would be involved with
out any serious financial conse-

He added, however, that, "If Con- I
gress should undertake to satisfy
the demands of this particular class
of people, it will encourage other
pressure groups to seek similar j
benefits from the government."
The history of the bonus bill
now before Congress dates back
to 1924 when Congress passed over
the veto of President Calvin Cool
idge the Adjusted Compensation
Act authorizing the immediate
cash payment of $1 per day for
domestic and $1.25 per day for for
eign service up to $50.
For service during the World War
in excess of this amount, 20-year
paid-up endowment insurance poli
cies were issued January 1, 1925, on
the basis of length of service and the
age of the veteran. The average face
value of these policies was $926.
It was further provided that after
two years the veterans could bor
row up to 90 per cent of the current
iace value of the policies, that is, on
a $100 policy after two years, $87.93
and after the 19th year, $831.23. At
the same time a sinking fund from
which the policies could be paid off
was established calling for annual
additions of $114,000,000.
Almost immediately after the
enactment of the first bonus legis
lation a clamor grew for cash re- j
dcmption of the policies at matur
ity value. In 1931 it was argued
by the bonus-seekers that cash
payment at the time would act as
a stimulant toward recovery
through the expansion of buying
power.
On February 27 of that year Con
gress voted the soldiers the right to
borrow up to 50 per cent of the ma- j
turity values of their policies on an
average of about $500 each. At that \
time the average loan value of their
policies was $216.76.
Now Congress proposes to pay the j
bonus by means of baby bonds j
which may Oe cashed immediately j
oi held until maturity at 3 per cent
interest.
