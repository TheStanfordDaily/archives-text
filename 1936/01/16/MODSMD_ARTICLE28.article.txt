# Finder Finds Fancy Future For Firemen
## 
### 
Now a campus fireman is pegged
by the night editor as a funny
guy . . .
But here's a fireman who threw
him into hysterics. He's five feet
two (in his hip boots) and we un
derstand he has hair on his chest.
Which makes it doubly funny
because this Stanford fireman is
to become an artist's model. (Cer
tainly, in his red flannels!) He ac
cepted the job from Mrs. Irene
Spenner Coverley of the Univer
sity Employment Bureau yester
day.
But he's not enough. Mrs. Cov
erley wants two artist's models.
They're to pose for three days a
week, which she says is a good
job.
Visiting firemen please write.
