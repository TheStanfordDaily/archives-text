# B.A.C. Raises Ticket Price
## Seats Will Be On Sale Today, Friday, for 75c 
### 
Tickets for the California Stan
ford basketball game Friday night
are still available, but not at the
rooters' pries formerly set at 40
aents. General admission tickets
which may be purchased as long as
they last will be on sale today and
Friday at the B.A.C. for 75 cents.
Although the B.A.C. has sent a
large block of ducats to Cal, and
there are a number of season tick
ets and press passes, the small sale
of rooters' tickets during the last
two days indicate that a large num
ber of seats are still available.
Don Liebeidorfer has announced
that the ducats will be kept on sale
up to the night of the game if they
last.
The Daily announced during the
two day sale that rooters should get
their tickets as the sale would not be
extended past Tuesday afternoon.
Those who wish to see the game will
have to pay the price of being late
and shell out 75 cents.
