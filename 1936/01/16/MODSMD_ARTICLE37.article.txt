# Frosh Hoopsters Swamp Menlo J.C.
## Card Quintet Coasts To 41-19 Victory In Listless Contest 
### 
Running up a big lead early in the game, the Stanford frosh basket
ball team coasted to an easy 41 to 1!) victory over Menlo Junior College
in tbc Pavilion last night.
Overanxious iYlenlo guarding enabled the Indian babes to sink IIS
free throws. Jimmy Bradsbaw's quintet played only a fair* door game,

but Lyman Calkins and Dick Nee-4
ley, as well Phil Zonne, showed
good eyes for the basket. Zonne
was high point man with 18, but
Calkins made eight and Neeley six
—each scoring more than any Ivlenlo
hoopster.
Outside of a few flashes, the
game was listless. Zonne, Calkins
and Neeley gave the yearlings a
17advantage as the jaycees
failed to solve the frosli attack.
Pete McArthur heaved the bail
more than half the length of the !
court on one pass to Zonne, who 1
then sank a set-up. The thirty- 1
niners stretched their lead to 25-
7 at half time, as the visitors were
unable to penetrate an improved
frosli defense. Menlo made two
long shots, one from "the hole,"
and a free throw during the iirst
half.
Alter scoring 15 points in 20 min- |
utos, Zonne took things easy in the
second session, marking up only
three digits and passing to Menlo
several times. The Oaks, who had
evidently heard from Ad Dewey,
their coach, during the intermis
sion, played a much better game, al
though the score was nevei closer
than 25)-12.
Fighting to keep control of the
hall, both teams enlivened the
closing minutes, although the is
sue was never in doubt. Largely
because of a decided edge in
height, the fresh came out of most
of the scrambles with the ball in
their possession. Wally deWitt of
gridiron fame, Chuck Fisher, and
Hob Brooke were the only re
serves to see action as Bradshaw
gave his regulars plenty of work
together. Zonne and Neeley
played the entire game.
Pete McArthur's accurate passing
and Jack Kessell's all-round floor
game helped add to the yearling
score and keep Menlo down. Phil
Olsen, scrappy little forward, and
Bob Johnson, big pivot man, looked
good for Johnson and Bill
Brigham, a guard, left the game on
four personal fouls.
Tomorrow night the frosh will
face their first real test in the Pa
vilion as they tangle with Marin
Junior College. The north bay
team defeated Bradshaw's outfit,
.!!) to :IG, at Kentlield, during
Christmas vacation, and is con
ceded an even chance to repeat.
Both teams have improved con
siderably since they first met.
Berkeley High will probably pro
vide less opposition Saturday eve
ning.

Running up a big lead early in the game, the Stanford frosh basket
ball team coasted to an easy 41 to 1!) victory over Menlo Junior College
in tbc Pavilion last night.
Overanxious iYlenlo guarding enabled the Indian babes to sink IIS
free throws. Jimmy Bradsbaw's quintet played only a fair* door game,

but Lyman Calkins and Dick Nee-4
ley, as well Phil Zonne, showed
good eyes for the basket. Zonne
was high point man with 18, but
Calkins made eight and Neeley six
—each scoring more than any Ivlenlo
hoopster.
Outside of a few flashes, the
game was listless. Zonne, Calkins
and Neeley gave the yearlings a
17advantage as the jaycees
failed to solve the frosli attack.
Pete McArthur heaved the bail
more than half the length of the !
court on one pass to Zonne, who 1
then sank a set-up. The thirty- 1
niners stretched their lead to 25-
7 at half time, as the visitors were
unable to penetrate an improved
frosli defense. Menlo made two
long shots, one from "the hole,"
and a free throw during the iirst
half.
Alter scoring 15 points in 20 min- |
utos, Zonne took things easy in the
second session, marking up only
three digits and passing to Menlo
several times. The Oaks, who had
evidently heard from Ad Dewey,
their coach, during the intermis
sion, played a much better game, al
though the score was nevei closer
than 25)-12.
Fighting to keep control of the
hall, both teams enlivened the
closing minutes, although the is
sue was never in doubt. Largely
because of a decided edge in
height, the fresh came out of most
of the scrambles with the ball in
their possession. Wally deWitt of
gridiron fame, Chuck Fisher, and
Hob Brooke were the only re
serves to see action as Bradshaw
gave his regulars plenty of work
together. Zonne and Neeley
played the entire game.
Pete McArthur's accurate passing
and Jack Kessell's all-round floor
game helped add to the yearling
score and keep Menlo down. Phil
Olsen, scrappy little forward, and
Bob Johnson, big pivot man, looked
good for Johnson and Bill
Brigham, a guard, left the game on
four personal fouls.
Tomorrow night the frosh will
face their first real test in the Pa
vilion as they tangle with Marin
Junior College. The north bay
team defeated Bradshaw's outfit,
.!!) to :IG, at Kentlield, during
Christmas vacation, and is con
ceded an even chance to repeat.
Both teams have improved con
siderably since they first met.
Berkeley High will probably pro
vide less opposition Saturday eve
ning.
