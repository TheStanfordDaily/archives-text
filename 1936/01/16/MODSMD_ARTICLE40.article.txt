STILL AWAITING
A DECISION
It's a tough question to decide,
this little matter that's come up in
regard to the proposed plan of plac
ing Bobby Grayson's No. 22 jersey
in the trophy loom, alongside that of
Ernie No vers. There are points for
both sides and just to clarify the
situation we might outline the
set-up.
On the one hand there are those
who believe that Grayson's shirt
should, by all means, he set aside.
And they believe further that
such a move would he an honor to
everyone who played with Bobby.
The Daily originally took that
stand.
Then on the other side of the
fence are those who think that
every one of the "vowing sopho
mores" should be honored just as
much as Bobby, though they cion't
deny the fact that Grayson was one
of the greatest running backs ever
seen in football. This group would
advocate the placing of a plaque
bearing the names of all the "vow
ers" in the trophy case.
In one sense this latter plan
seems to be the most sensible.
Throughout his whole football ca
reer at Stanford, Bobby has played
side by side with the same men.
The same bunch helped him to be
come great, just as he pulled for
them.
In this sense all their jerseys de
serve to be set aside. But since that
is impossible the next best thing
would be the honoring of all those
men in another way.
MOKE THAN SEVEN
ARE DESERVING
In reality it is proper that ten,
not six, seniors receive that hon
or. That would be another point
in favor of the plaque idea.
For along with the 1935 varsity
seniors—Grayson, Hamilton, Mos
crip, Reynolds, Adams, and Rou
ble—who were members of the
"vowing" group, are four others
who weren't around when the
more or less mythical vows were
taken or have since that time been
called off the field by misfortune.
Wcs Muller and Keith Topping
weren't playing first string when
the vows were made and thus
have always been left out of the
group.'though they should be in.
Claude Calloway and Frankie
Alustiza both have had tough luck
and been forced to give up football,
though both are really vowing
sophomores.
Thus it would appear that all
these men should be honored along
with Bobby Grayson—and many be
lieve that Bobby would want it
that way. He undoubtedly would.
Tuesday night the Ex Commit
tee tabled the motion to place
Bobby's jersey in the case to
await the decision of a commit
tee which "will sound out public
opinion on the matter."
Advice from Stanfordites either
pro or con the measure will be wel
comed. —Frost

STILL AWAITING
A DECISION
It's a tough question to decide,
this little matter that's come up in
regard to the proposed plan of plac
ing Bobby Grayson's No. 22 jersey
in the trophy loom, alongside that of
Ernie No vers. There are points for
both sides and just to clarify the
situation we might outline the
set-up.
On the one hand there are those
who believe that Grayson's shirt
should, by all means, he set aside.
And they believe further that
such a move would he an honor to
everyone who played with Bobby.
The Daily originally took that
stand.
Then on the other side of the
fence are those who think that
every one of the "vowing sopho
mores" should be honored just as
much as Bobby, though they cion't
deny the fact that Grayson was one
of the greatest running backs ever
seen in football. This group would
advocate the placing of a plaque
bearing the names of all the "vow
ers" in the trophy case.
In one sense this latter plan
seems to be the most sensible.
Throughout his whole football ca
reer at Stanford, Bobby has played
side by side with the same men.
The same bunch helped him to be
come great, just as he pulled for
them.
In this sense all their jerseys de
serve to be set aside. But since that
is impossible the next best thing
would be the honoring of all those
men in another way.
