# Golfers To Have New Winter Rates
## 
### 
Agitation for reductions in stu- (
dent golf rates has been partially
rewarded by i- change in the regu- !
lations governing the special student i
fee of 50 cents. During the winter j
months the 50-cent rate goes into
effect at 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon
instead of a 1 o'clock as previously, j

Activity of Indian golfers has been
effectively checked so far this quar- |
ter by the nearly continuous rains. |
Qualifying rounds to determine 1
team positions have been postponed 1
until the course has a chance to
dry.
