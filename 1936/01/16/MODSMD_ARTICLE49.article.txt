# Don Towne Cracks Breast Stroke Mark
## 
### 
Don Towne, talented yearling
merman who surprised onlookers
last Saturday when he missed
equaling the world record in the
100-yard breas' stroke event by only
1.1 seconds, unleashed another at
tack on the record books yesterday.
This time he took a well-aimed
but unollicial crack at the 50-yard
breast stroke mark. And the re
sult was even more gratifying to
Coach Nort Thornton than was
last week's, for the tank had
hardly come out of a state of fury
, when it was found that Towne
covered the distance in no more
than 28.5) seconds.
The official world record, by way
of comparison, stands at 29.7 seconds,
and was set by Johnny Paulsen, of
U.S.C. and the 1932 Olympic team.
Thus, when he realized that the
flashy freshman had clipped .8 of a
second from Paulseh's time, Coach
Thornton decided several things.
Thornton decided that Don
Towne had definitely established
himself as a leading prospect for
the 1836 Olympic squad, that he is
the most promising of the cur
rent Redskin aquatic hopes, and
also that he would probably make
an official attempt at national
breast stroke records some time in
February, if A.A.U. sanction can
be obtained.
This afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, a
final competitive workout for both
the varsity and frosh aggregations
will be held at Encina Pools. The
squads are not to tangle again until
the interclass meet set for Satur

day, January 25.
Among tin* high-lights of to
day's program will be Towne's
time trial in the 200-yard breast
stroke; the Winfield Needham-
Jack Vihert duel in the 220-yard
free style; and a 100-yard free
style event in which Captain Jack
Kuhn, Henry Godman, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, and Martin Scatena—all
ace relay sprinters—will compete.
A 100-yard free style for fresh
men, a 100-yaid breast stroke for
the varsity swimmers, and a 100-
yard handicap back stroke are other
events scheduled. Admission io the
drill will be free.

Jack Vihert duel in the 220-yard
free style; and a 100-yard free
style event in which Captain Jack
Kuhn, Henry Godman, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, and Martin Scatena—all
ace relay sprinters—will compete.
A 100-yard free style for fresh
men, a 100-yaid breast stroke for
the varsity swimmers, and a 100-
yard handicap back stroke are other

drill will be free.
Don Towne, talented yearling
merman who surprised onlookers
last Saturday when he missed
equaling the world record in the
100-yard breas' stroke event by only
1.1 seconds, unleashed another at
tack on the record books yesterday.
This time he took a well-aimed
but unollicial crack at the 50-yard
breast stroke mark. And the re
sult was even more gratifying to
Coach Nort Thornton than was
last week's, for the tank had
hardly come out of a state of fury
, when it was found that Towne
covered the distance in no more
than 28.5) seconds.
The official world record, by way
of comparison, stands at 29.7 seconds,
and was set by Johnny Paulsen, of
U.S.C. and the 1932 Olympic team.
Thus, when he realized that the
flashy freshman had clipped .8 of a
second from Paulseh's time, Coach
Thornton decided several things.
Thornton decided that Don
Towne had definitely established
himself as a leading prospect for
the 1836 Olympic squad, that he is
the most promising of the cur
rent Redskin aquatic hopes, and
also that he would probably make
an official attempt at national
breast stroke records some time in
February, if A.A.U. sanction can
be obtained.
This afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, a
final competitive workout for both
the varsity and frosh aggregations
will be held at Encina Pools. The
squads are not to tangle again until
the interclass meet set for Satur

day, January 25.
Among tin* high-lights of to
day's program will be Towne's
time trial in the 200-yard breast
stroke; the Winfield Needham-
Jack Vihert duel in the 220-yard
free style; and a 100-yard free
style event in which Captain Jack
Kuhn, Henry Godman, Alec Mac-
Kenzie, and Martin Scatena—all
