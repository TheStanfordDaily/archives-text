## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Bookstore Profits of Less Interest To Students Than Lowered Prices

Bookstore's directors probably little guessed
what a hornet's nest they were stirring up
when they generously asked Ex Committee
for suggestions as to disposition of expected
profits.
They not only got several suggestions, but
they reopened the age-old student gripe that
Bookstore ain't what she ought to be —that
students don't get good, inexpensive service
from it. Most sarcastic contribution to Vox
Campi on this line has not been printed he
cause it rambles on for about twenty inches,
and even if a spot that big could be found it is
doubtful if anyone would read through it.
In most student's minds there is an un
spoken question that ranks above that of re
bate vs. circulating library vs. student aid
grant from Bookstore profits. It is "Why can't
Bookstore reduce prices, give better serv
ice?"
Frankly the Daily would be glad to know
the answer —it would save us many requests
for anti-Bookstore campaigns if we had the
information on why prices can't be cut.
Humors occasionally come in saying prices
on books are cheaper here or there than at the
Bookstore. One thing we do know about the
Bookstore is that certain books and branded
products, typewriters for example, cannot be
sold below certain prices without risking re

talintions from luanufacliirers.
But school stickers, paper, and small sup
plies seemingly could be sold at lower prices.
Books from the University Press might he
more welcome texts to students if the prices
could he cut a little. One course comes to
mind which requires a pamphlet-hound, lo
cally photolithed text for three or four dol
lars. The possibility of keeping larger stocks
and of handling used texts the year 'round
might he gone into.
If such improvements are impossible, as
they may he, it will he interesting to see in
print Ihe reasons why they are impossible.
Professor Lesley, head of Bookstore's Board
of Directors, has expressed his willingness to
answer specific questions along these lines.
Here then is an opportunity for students to
get information they have long desired about
Bookstore prices and policy, although iner
tia has kept them from asking. Any pertinent
questions sent to the Daily as soon as possible
will he transmitted to Mr. Lesley, who is will
ing to furnish the Daily with answers to he
printed for student benefit.
If intelligent questions are put about Book
store service, much misunderstanding can be
cleared up as to the possibilities of internal
betterment of the Bookstore, and the students
can ballot as to the disposition of Bookstore
profits without undue ill feeling.

ing to furnish the Daily with answers to he
printed for student benefit.
If intelligent questions are put about Book
store service, much misunderstanding can be
cleared up as to the possibilities of internal
betterment of the Bookstore, and the students
can ballot as to the disposition of Bookstore
profits without undue ill feeling.
Bookstore's directors probably little guessed
what a hornet's nest they were stirring up
when they generously asked Ex Committee
for suggestions as to disposition of expected
profits.
They not only got several suggestions, but
they reopened the age-old student gripe that
Bookstore ain't what she ought to be —that
students don't get good, inexpensive service
from it. Most sarcastic contribution to Vox
Campi on this line has not been printed he
cause it rambles on for about twenty inches,
and even if a spot that big could be found it is
doubtful if anyone would read through it.
In most student's minds there is an un
spoken question that ranks above that of re
bate vs. circulating library vs. student aid
grant from Bookstore profits. It is "Why can't
Bookstore reduce prices, give better serv
ice?"
Frankly the Daily would be glad to know
the answer —it would save us many requests
for anti-Bookstore campaigns if we had the
information on why prices can't be cut.
Humors occasionally come in saying prices
on books are cheaper here or there than at the
Bookstore. One thing we do know about the
Bookstore is that certain books and branded
products, typewriters for example, cannot be
sold below certain prices without risking re

talintions from luanufacliirers.
But school stickers, paper, and small sup
plies seemingly could be sold at lower prices.
Books from the University Press might he
more welcome texts to students if the prices
could he cut a little. One course comes to
mind which requires a pamphlet-hound, lo
cally photolithed text for three or four dol
lars. The possibility of keeping larger stocks
and of handling used texts the year 'round
might he gone into.
If such improvements are impossible, as
they may he, it will he interesting to see in
print Ihe reasons why they are impossible.
Professor Lesley, head of Bookstore's Board
of Directors, has expressed his willingness to
answer specific questions along these lines.
Here then is an opportunity for students to
get information they have long desired about
Bookstore prices and policy, although iner
tia has kept them from asking. Any pertinent
questions sent to the Daily as soon as possible
will he transmitted to Mr. Lesley, who is will
ing to furnish the Daily with answers to he
printed for student benefit.
