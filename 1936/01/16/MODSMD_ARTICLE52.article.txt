# New Suggestion Arises For Honoring Gridmen
## 
### 
Apparently swayed by the argument that
it it honored Bobby Grayson, similar requests
to honor players would reenre incessantly, Ex
Committee Tuesday night tabled the sugges
tion to place Grayson's 22 jersey in the trophy
case which for years held Ernie Ncvers' No. 1
jersey.
Ex Committee probably missed the point.
Grayson's case is not a usual one, and it will
probably be years before Stanford has another
such gridiron great; it has been eleven years
since the last one.
The jerscy-in-the-trophy-case mode of hon
oring is a simple and approved way. Another
suggestion has now arisen which is more com
plicated, but has its merit. The plan is to
have a testimonial dinner open to all students,
the funds going to put up a plaque or to give
a trophy to the Vowing Sophs.
Any such blanket award has two draw
backs. Firstly, whose names would be put on
the plaque or cup? Would it be the whole
team, the letter-winners, the vow-takers, the
three-year lettennen, the threc-times-in-the-
Rose-Bowl men, or what? Someone is bound
to he on the short end. Secondly, a plaque is
likely to look a bit silly in years to come when
the particular exploits of the group have faded
from memory.
The jersey scheme hardly hurts any feel
ings, as Grayson has been made the standout
ol the team by the nation, the symbolization
of Stanford football prowess for the years
1933-4-5. The method is an approved one,
and furnishes a good souvenir for future
Stanford men. The testimonial dinner could
still be held, it demand warranted, and the
proceeds possibly be used to give some tokens
to the men themselves.
More important than which form the recog
nition takes is that the Vowing Sophs and
their most illustrious teammate deserve
some ollicial honoring for the fame they
brought the I niversity. It is in the province
of this Ex Committee to make such award,
and let the bogey of too frequent awards be
handled by future Ex Committees.

United Stales Congress, with campaign ban
ners waving, will have acceded to the de
mands of these war veterans before the month
is ended.
Notwithstanding the fact that Congress has
come to speak of two billion dollars as pin
money, the precedent that will be set by grant
ing this particular bonus, obviously a case of
political gravy-ladling, may prove one of the
most dangerous moves in the post-war era.
If Congress satisfies this demand, as Con
gress seemingly plans to do, the House and
Senate henceforth will be over-run by various
other pressure groups—Townsend pension
ers, farmers, even civil service employees—
whose mouths are watering; these groups, of
course, cannot put quite the feeling into a
llag-waving stunt that the veterans have been
able to do. This, however, is a minor point.
The only essentials of a gigantic gravy grab
apparently are numbers and an election
year.
The arc-we-men-or-are-we-mice classic can
readily be answered regarding the United
States Congress, as the country's ace govern
ing body looks forward to re-election.

probably be years before Stanford has another
such gridiron great; it has been eleven years
since the last one.
The jerscy-in-the-trophy-case mode of hon
oring is a simple and approved way. Another
suggestion has now arisen which is more com
plicated, but has its merit. The plan is to
have a testimonial dinner open to all students,
the funds going to put up a plaque or to give
a trophy to the Vowing Sophs.
Any such blanket award has two draw
backs. Firstly, whose names would be put on
the plaque or cup? Would it be the whole
team, the letter-winners, the vow-takers, the
three-year lettennen, the threc-times-in-the-
Rose-Bowl men, or what? Someone is bound
to he on the short end. Secondly, a plaque is
likely to look a bit silly in years to come when
the particular exploits of the group have faded
from memory.
The jersey scheme hardly hurts any feel
ings, as Grayson has been made the standout
ol the team by the nation, the symbolization
of Stanford football prowess for the years
1933-4-5. The method is an approved one,
and furnishes a good souvenir for future
Stanford men. The testimonial dinner could
still be held, it demand warranted, and the
proceeds possibly be used to give some tokens
to the men themselves.
More important than which form the recog
nition takes is that the Vowing Sophs and
their most illustrious teammate deserve
some ollicial honoring for the fame they
brought the I niversity. It is in the province
of this Ex Committee to make such award,
and let the bogey of too frequent awards be
handled by future Ex Committees.

United Stales Congress, with campaign ban
ners waving, will have acceded to the de
mands of these war veterans before the month
is ended.
Notwithstanding the fact that Congress has
come to speak of two billion dollars as pin
money, the precedent that will be set by grant
ing this particular bonus, obviously a case of
political gravy-ladling, may prove one of the
most dangerous moves in the post-war era.
If Congress satisfies this demand, as Con
gress seemingly plans to do, the House and
Senate henceforth will be over-run by various
other pressure groups—Townsend pension
ers, farmers, even civil service employees—
whose mouths are watering; these groups, of
course, cannot put quite the feeling into a
llag-waving stunt that the veterans have been
able to do. This, however, is a minor point.
The only essentials of a gigantic gravy grab
apparently are numbers and an election
year.
The arc-we-men-or-are-we-mice classic can
readily be answered regarding the United
States Congress, as the country's ace govern
ing body looks forward to re-election.
Apparently swayed by the argument that
it it honored Bobby Grayson, similar requests
to honor players would reenre incessantly, Ex
Committee Tuesday night tabled the sugges
tion to place Grayson's 22 jersey in the trophy
case which for years held Ernie Ncvers' No. 1
jersey.
Ex Committee probably missed the point.
