## THE 						HERITAGE OF STANFORD 
### 
If one stands observant on a hill-top behind the
campus ... he can sense with a single glance the
glory that Ls Stanford's . . . and the glory of which
Stanford was born—the one exemplified in tilt ex
panse of red-tiled roofs and carefully cared-for
grounds . . . the other in a solitary, strange-looking
tower jutting skyward to the west of the Palo Alto ,
tree. I
* * * *
That tower is a relic symbolic of the man-made
wealth that brought this university into being. It is
the fantastic and decorative dome of the mansion on
the old Hopkins estate in Menlo. Two generations ago,
that estate was a pride of the peninsula. It was an
outward display of the wealth that had come to the
great foursome of California — Hopkins, Stanford,
Huntington, and Crocker. It was a luxurious estate of
scattered marble statues, rolling lawns, oriental tea
houses, and tree-lined drives to which society folk of !
San Francisco came for gay week-ends. And Stanford,
as we know it, was but a vast farm where Senator
Stanford bred the finest horses in the country.
* * * «
The wealth that came to one of these men tui ncd
the dream in the minds of Senator and Mrs. Stanford
into realism. Nearly every resource of the Stanfords |
went into this university. The Senator was happy in
doing it. It has been said of him that he was of sensi
tive conscience and wished ardently to be liked and
to square his account with God and California. Sen
ator Stanford was not the only one of the big four !
combination in the enterprise. Timothy Hopkins,
adopted son of the great Mark, whose death the uni
versity is now mourning, was an original trustee.
Thus the grandeur that is symbolized in that de
serted and decaying estate in Monlo was sacrificed for
the university we now attend. The mother and father
of the boy whose name now means a university gave
their efforts, their wealth, even their personal be
longings. And now Timothy Hopkins, the iast of
what we might call the founding fathers, the man so
endeared to the student that three year-books havfc j
been dedicated to him, has Massed on and left all |
that he owned to Stanford.
♦ * < *
If, indeed, Senator Stanford had an account to
square with California, who is there who would not
grant that it has been long squared and long for
gotten. And we, as students who deliqht 111 being
cynical and who deplore sentimentalism, can forget
our hypocrisy for a moment, we should remember to
be proud of the heritage that is Stanford's.
