The Editor, Sir:
Another slant on the subject of
"wimmin, 'God Bless 'em'.'*
Way back in the late 1920s it was
my good and Stanford's ill fortune
that some misguided alumnus con- !
sidered Stanford a desirable school \
for me or vice versa. So far some I
seven years I have watched the old j
place evolute, particularly the j
women.
Boys, take it from an old-timer, j
instead of berating the much-dis
cussed Stanford women you ought to i
take out your little prayer rug, I
kneel, and salaam three times in i
the general direction of the Ad
Building out of sheer gratitude for
delivering you from the 'odious
500.'
Brethren, little do you realize the
horrible fate from which you have
been delivered. . If you can't say
anything else for the depression, at
least you can be grateful to it for
forever breaking those 500 chosen
souls' monopoly on all the conceit
and stubbornness in Northern Cali
fornia.
Gentlemen, it seems that the
scream of the eagle has been heard
in these columns bemoaning every
thing about om fair 1100 from their
make-up to their choice of com
pany. It has been, in the course of
my many years, my fortune to find
one great truth: That before an eagle
will scream 1 in. must have tasted of
the vintage of the sour grape. So,
fellows, just bccause the blonde in
the next seat doesn't fall on your
neck over tho technique that was so
smooth in Podunk H.S., but is sort
of crude here, don't let it get you
down. You'll grow out of it.
You complain of a date in the city
and the attendant cost thereof.
Figure out these apples: From Stan
ford to Mills to San Francisco, to
Mills to S'anfordi TJiat, young
fellers, is what we oldsters were up
against when we were young and j
foolish and used to date. So no :
matter how much you scream, You !

Eaters of Sour Grapes, you can still
walk into the nearest phone booth,
take any number off the wall, get
any place 'rum the Gamma Phi
hous* to the Oaks, ask for anyone
from Alice to Zella, and still be one
hcck of a lot better off than your
illustrious predecessors.
So, boys, hearken to this ancient
and broken voice and take it easy,
for those girls, besides being—for
the most part—pretty good eggs, are

also i lot smarter than you and I
will ever be, not to mention more
attractive and better company.

The Editor, Sir:
Another slant on the subject of
"wimmin, 'God Bless 'em'.'*
Way back in the late 1920s it was
my good and Stanford's ill fortune
that some misguided alumnus con- !
sidered Stanford a desirable school \
for me or vice versa. So far some I
seven years I have watched the old j
place evolute, particularly the j
women.
Boys, take it from an old-timer, j
instead of berating the much-dis
cussed Stanford women you ought to i
take out your little prayer rug, I
kneel, and salaam three times in i
the general direction of the Ad
Building out of sheer gratitude for
delivering you from the 'odious
500.'
Brethren, little do you realize the
horrible fate from which you have
been delivered. . If you can't say
anything else for the depression, at
least you can be grateful to it for
forever breaking those 500 chosen
souls' monopoly on all the conceit
and stubbornness in Northern Cali
fornia.
Gentlemen, it seems that the
scream of the eagle has been heard
in these columns bemoaning every
thing about om fair 1100 from their
make-up to their choice of com
pany. It has been, in the course of
my many years, my fortune to find
one great truth: That before an eagle
will scream 1 in. must have tasted of
the vintage of the sour grape. So,
fellows, just bccause the blonde in
the next seat doesn't fall on your
neck over tho technique that was so
smooth in Podunk H.S., but is sort
of crude here, don't let it get you
down. You'll grow out of it.
You complain of a date in the city
and the attendant cost thereof.
Figure out these apples: From Stan
ford to Mills to San Francisco, to
Mills to S'anfordi TJiat, young
fellers, is what we oldsters were up
against when we were young and j
foolish and used to date. So no :
matter how much you scream, You !

Eaters of Sour Grapes, you can still
walk into the nearest phone booth,
take any number off the wall, get
any place 'rum the Gamma Phi
hous* to the Oaks, ask for anyone
from Alice to Zella, and still be one
hcck of a lot better off than your
illustrious predecessors.
So, boys, hearken to this ancient
and broken voice and take it easy,
for those girls, besides being—for
the most part—pretty good eggs, are

also i lot smarter than you and I
will ever be, not to mention more
attractive and better company.
