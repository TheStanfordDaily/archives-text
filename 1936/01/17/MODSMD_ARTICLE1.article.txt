# Indian-Bear Hoop Game To Follow Banquets Tonight
## 
### 
Twixt pledge dinner and Pledge
Prom tonight, Row men will amble
to the Pavilion to watch Coach
John Bunn's varsity basketball ex
perts match talent with those of
Nibs Price of California in what
promises to be one of the "light
ingot" of Big Game hoop meetings.
For the first time in 15 years the
Indians enter a Cal series with the
odds stacked in their favor. Tales
of Hank Luisetties, Art Stoefens,
Dinty Moores —in fact all the first
stringers—have spread throughout
the state, with the result that Stan
ford gets the edge.
But no easy task will it be for
those ambitious Indians tonight,
for Berkeley sends a team of
equally ambitious Bears.
Losers of two league games last
week-end and victorious only thrice
in 13 starts the U. C. quintet is
anxious to get started on the come
back trail. That will have to be
done tonight, if ever.
In a similar situation is the Farm
outfit. Though favored this even
ing, the Farm lads can't forget last
Saturday night's affair with the
Saturday night's affair with the
Bruins of Westwood.
To all appearance this evening's
contest will be a rough and tumble
meeting since both parties have
weight and size coupled with the
ability to mix it up if necessary.
