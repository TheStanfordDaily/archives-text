# Neophytes Needn't Fear Hell Week Next Fall; The Rough Stuff's Out
## 
### 
Dad's stories of the initiation he
went through to join his "college
frat" need be of little concern to
the 1936 legacy as he joins in
pledge night revelry.
Junior's Hell Week next fall will
be of a much milder nature than
that in the "good old days."
He can look forward to a swat
or two, and housework every Sat
urday—but going out in search of a
chorus girl's undergarments? Thats
out.
That stuff was thrown out last
year, at least as far as Stanford is
concerned. Interfraternity Council
banned Hell Week, as such, and
houses in the future will have to be
content with an entirely within-the
house 'Tledge Week."

The plan was started last fall,
and worked well, with no evasions
officially reported to the Council.
The substitute Hell Week elim
inates quests, and any other activ
ity that "reflects 011 the name of
the University, is harmful to the
initiate either in health or scholar
ship, or is destructive to private
property."
The paddle will still be used, in a
limited degree, it was agreed last
fall, and "sophomore training" is in
no way affected by the regulations.

New pledges may be photograph
ed for fraternity panels in the Quad
next week, according to Editor Don
Hanson. Details will lie announced
Monday.
