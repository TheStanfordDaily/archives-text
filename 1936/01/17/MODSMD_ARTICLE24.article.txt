# 'Me No Pledge' Says Little Chief Mud-In-Eye
## 
### 
"Woe is me," quoth The Daily's
little man Friday as lie wandered
forlornly betwixt pledge-crazed
frosh in Encina's wilds this after
noon.
"How could they pledge a nugget
like me if 1 didn't have a moniker,"
asked Little Phooey-face. "Those
Daily mugs are so proud of their
extrys that they wouldn't wind up
the contest in time to give me a
name."
"With ten bucks—a miserable pit
tance—ofifered on the' line you'd
think the newsguys and the cam
poose could get together and name
me before all this hullabaloo."
Despite the moans of the edit
page brave, the contest will run
until its announced deadline of
Wednesday. At that time Our
Hasher, Ye Ed, and Meezter
Bawnes will reach into the hat and
pull out the most suitable name for
little Jo-Jo and a reason therefore.
