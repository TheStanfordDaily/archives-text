team.
The frosh cagers .will be forced
to miss banquets tonight, because
they tangle with Marin Junior Col
lege at 6:30 o'clock in a preliminary
to the Stanford-California varsity
game. Then, some semblance of
training must be maintained for to
morrow evening's game with Berk

Marin defeated the frosh, 39 to 36,
last month.
