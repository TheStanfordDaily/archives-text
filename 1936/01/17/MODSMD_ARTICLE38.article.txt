# Hall-man Throws in Last Minute Offer of Paradise
## 
### 
Now that you guys are all kind of
tangled up with the law and things,
ready to move up brotherhood alley,
we're awfully sorry.
You see, we figure that you'd
really like our house. Look at the
swell fellows we've got, and the
new house all built, too, and backed
with $42,000,000. Not only that, but
the nifty tiled bathrooms, and the
big parlors, and only two guys to a
room.
Now just in case the brothers
have finally shown you around the
bedrooms, may we suggest a tour
of the Branner gaming hall. All
the city papers are there for five
minutes after the newsboy leaves
them, and we've also got sawed-off
billiard cues—to reach around the
corners.
Furthermore there's no freshman
bed-making because there aren't
any freshmen. Only bona fide Civil
\\ ar veterans sweep out your room
and throw the covers back and
forth. Of particular note are the
microphones and loudspeakers con
cealed in the walls and radiators.
1 hey convey bathroom baritones
from one end of the house to the
other, and work almost as well
when the Boiler House Bennies
play hammer-murder with the
plumbing around 4 a.m.
The best part of our house is that
the only illegal rushing is for a
poker-pot winner to rush out with
his roommate's shirt.
And then on house-meeting
nights we have soap-races. Don't
tell us you've never soap-raced!
That's done in bed-room slippers in
the hall. You spread liquid soap on
the linoleum, take a good run and
jump for yourself, and see how far
you slide. The guy with the most
callouses wins a box of chocolates.
If you join our house now, of
course, you'll probably get only the
worst rooms. You can have 116,
on the hell-hole (that's the one
next-door to the guy with the

home-made electric phonograph,)
or you can have 210, on hell-hole
heights.
Now the alumni, and the house
bills, —they're low too. And the
pin. Ah, the pin. < Well, take a look
at your laundry shirt.

worst rooms. You can have 116,
on the hell-hole (that's the one
next-door to the guy with the

home-made electric phonograph,)
or you can have 210, on hell-hole
heights.
Now the alumni, and the house
bills, —they're low too. And the
pin. Ah, the pin. < Well, take a look
at your laundry shirt.

President, whose cooperation in
supplying pledge lists made this
prompt service to the campus pos
sible.
Now that you guys are all kind of
tangled up with the law and things,
ready to move up brotherhood alley,
we're awfully sorry.
You see, we figure that you'd
really like our house. Look at the
swell fellows we've got, and the
new house all built, too, and backed
with $42,000,000. Not only that, but
the nifty tiled bathrooms, and the
big parlors, and only two guys to a
room.
Now just in case the brothers
have finally shown you around the
bedrooms, may we suggest a tour
of the Branner gaming hall. All
the city papers are there for five
minutes after the newsboy leaves
them, and we've also got sawed-off
billiard cues—to reach around the
corners.
Furthermore there's no freshman
bed-making because there aren't
any freshmen. Only bona fide Civil
\\ ar veterans sweep out your room
and throw the covers back and
forth. Of particular note are the
microphones and loudspeakers con
cealed in the walls and radiators.
1 hey convey bathroom baritones
from one end of the house to the
other, and work almost as well
when the Boiler House Bennies
play hammer-murder with the
plumbing around 4 a.m.
The best part of our house is that
the only illegal rushing is for a
poker-pot winner to rush out with
his roommate's shirt.
And then on house-meeting
nights we have soap-races. Don't
tell us you've never soap-raced!
That's done in bed-room slippers in
the hall. You spread liquid soap on
the linoleum, take a good run and
jump for yourself, and see how far
you slide. The guy with the most
callouses wins a box of chocolates.
If you join our house now, of
course, you'll probably get only the
worst rooms. You can have 116,
on the hell-hole (that's the one
next-door to the guy with the

home-made electric phonograph,)
or you can have 210, on hell-hole
