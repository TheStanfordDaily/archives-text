# Fraternities Pledge 272 Men
## Rushing Ends; Row Unites for Dance 
### 
The war is over, and congratula
tions will soar in and around Roble
Gym tonight as Stanford's Row, a
thousand couples strong, masses for
Interfraternity Council's annual
Pledge Prom.
Brothers and newly acquired
pledge-brothers will stream in from
all points of the Greek district be
ginning at 9 o'clock, starting time
for the official celebration of the
fraternities' big night of the year.
Lost nuggets will be temporarily
forgotten as Row-men resemble a
big, happy family more closely,
even, than they do during an A. S.-
b. U. election.
Details of the Pledge Prom:
Ernie Heckscher and Freddie
Nagcl both will have their bands on
hand.
Dancing is from 9:30 until 2
o'clock, with another hour before
Betty Louise must be behind Lag
unita doors.
Punch flowing throughout the
evening will serve as appetizer for
a buffet supper at 12:30.
Patrons and patronesses sched
uled for appearance are Mr. and
Mrs. C. Gilbert Wrenn, Mr. and
Mrs. Almon E. Roth, Mr. and Mrs.
Richard T. LaPiere, and Mr. and
Mrs. Bill Ellington.
All fraternities will hold open
house; the idea is to let the pledges
meet the brothers—and girl friends.
A premium on dates was reported
today as many of the pledges and
fraternity men were late in apply
ing and received the "line busy" sig
nal in campus feminine strongholds.
Financing of the dance is on an
inter-fraternity basis; the tax is on
the house, not the individual, and
each qualified Row man and pledge
will be awarded a free bid.

Encina invaded the Row today,
but the terms were different.
There was none of the cold stiff
ness of rushing: substituted was the
warm coardiality of pledging.
Rushees totaling 272 traipsed
past the threshold leading to the
fraternity lawyer and were convert
ed into pledge classes for 23 houses.
All afternoon, bells, canon-fire
and various other sounds of victory
heralded the arrival of another
pledge to one Greek brotherhood
or another.
Only one fraternity did not share
in the accompanying glamor; Sigma
Chi's pledges were to remain "un
official" until next winter, as the
result of the recent Interfraternity
Board ruling on a count of illegal
rushing.
But an extremely light penalty
gave even Sigma Chi some solace,
as the remainder of the Row spray
ed congratulations and planned for
banquets and the Pledge Prom to
night.
Rumors of fraternity activity
since preference dinners last night
were few, most of the Greeks pre
ferring to gather in bull sessions
for speculation as to the number
"all sewed up" and the "doubtfuls."
The houses were limited to 14
freshmen, but comparatively few
reached this mark. Many sopho
more and junior pledges, however,
swelled the ranks to total around
14 for the majority of the fratern
ities.
Pledging averages were approx
imately the same as last year, al
though there was considerable shift
ing among the houses, with a few
"whip classes" scattered in unex
pected directions.

for speculation as to the number
"all sewed up" and the "doubtfuls."
The houses were limited to 14
freshmen, but comparatively few
reached this mark. Many sopho
more and junior pledges, however,
swelled the ranks to total around
14 for the majority of the fratern
ities.
Pledging averages were approx
imately the same as last year, al
though there was considerable shift
ing among the houses, with a few
"whip classes" scattered in unex
pected directions.
The war is over, and congratula
tions will soar in and around Roble
Gym tonight as Stanford's Row, a
thousand couples strong, masses for
Interfraternity Council's annual
Pledge Prom.
Brothers and newly acquired
pledge-brothers will stream in from
all points of the Greek district be
ginning at 9 o'clock, starting time
for the official celebration of the
fraternities' big night of the year.
Lost nuggets will be temporarily
forgotten as Row-men resemble a
big, happy family more closely,
even, than they do during an A. S.-
b. U. election.
Details of the Pledge Prom:
Ernie Heckscher and Freddie
Nagcl both will have their bands on
hand.
Dancing is from 9:30 until 2
o'clock, with another hour before
Betty Louise must be behind Lag
unita doors.
Punch flowing throughout the
evening will serve as appetizer for
a buffet supper at 12:30.
Patrons and patronesses sched
uled for appearance are Mr. and
Mrs. C. Gilbert Wrenn, Mr. and
Mrs. Almon E. Roth, Mr. and Mrs.
Richard T. LaPiere, and Mr. and
Mrs. Bill Ellington.
All fraternities will hold open
house; the idea is to let the pledges
meet the brothers—and girl friends.
A premium on dates was reported
today as many of the pledges and
fraternity men were late in apply
ing and received the "line busy" sig
nal in campus feminine strongholds.
Financing of the dance is on an
inter-fraternity basis; the tax is on
the house, not the individual, and
each qualified Row man and pledge
will be awarded a free bid.

Encina invaded the Row today,
but the terms were different.
There was none of the cold stiff
ness of rushing: substituted was the
warm coardiality of pledging.
Rushees totaling 272 traipsed
past the threshold leading to the
fraternity lawyer and were convert
ed into pledge classes for 23 houses.
All afternoon, bells, canon-fire
and various other sounds of victory
heralded the arrival of another
pledge to one Greek brotherhood
or another.
Only one fraternity did not share
in the accompanying glamor; Sigma
Chi's pledges were to remain "un
official" until next winter, as the
result of the recent Interfraternity
Board ruling on a count of illegal
rushing.
But an extremely light penalty
gave even Sigma Chi some solace,
as the remainder of the Row spray
ed congratulations and planned for
banquets and the Pledge Prom to
night.
Rumors of fraternity activity
since preference dinners last night
were few, most of the Greeks pre
ferring to gather in bull sessions
for speculation as to the number
"all sewed up" and the "doubtfuls."
