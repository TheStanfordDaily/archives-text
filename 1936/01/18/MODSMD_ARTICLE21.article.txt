Is it safe to suggest that it's all
over? Can it be, after weeks of
intensive talks on the weather and
Life Everlasting, that Stanford's
sororities have nabbed the "nug
gettes" and that pledge classes are
tucked in for the year?
When open-houses have closed
tonight, upperclassmen will give up
sinky-softy mattresses and downy
comforters to make room for the
Class of '39. Tomorow morning—
after the youngsters have snuggled
through their first night of Row
slumber—it will be all over.
Bleary-eyed hashers will v thank
their stars —the ones they've seen
all week—for breakdast tomorrow.
Instead of filet mignon and turkey

truffles served to backless evening
gowns, it 11 he just plain waffles and
bacon to just plain tosle-haired
pledges.
Hashers and members will then
see to better advantage just what
they got out of the scramble. You
can't tell what a girl, even a Roble
rushee, is really like in a formal
it's when she comes down to break
fast in pajamas and mules that she's
really herself. It's then that the
truth will out. True?
