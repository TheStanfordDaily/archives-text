# Hoop Squad Whips Berkeley, 41 to 38
## Luisetti's 22 Points Lead Indians to Win 
### 
Stanford basketball men defeated Berkeley in their own Pavilion
for the second time in a decade. The scoreboard read 41-38, after the
Indian hoopsters had successfully stood off a final challenge last night.

i Hank Luisetti, sophomore sen
sation, proved the hero of the night
—being high point man and chief
steady influence of the local men
after Capt. Dinty Moore had re
tired from the game. The Spider
accounted for 22 points, ten of them
field goals.
Rangy Art Stoefen looked good
in his first big game. Howie Tur
ner was well on his game and "hot"
to the extent of 8 points and sec
ond scoring honors for Stanford.
Calderwood, Robertson, and Zonne
all proved themselves capable in
their first Cal series test.
Bill Quade was in as sub forward
long enough to gather two baskets,
one in a snappy recovery after a
difficult set-up had been missed by
the omnipresent Luisetti.
The game started ojp" with augury
for a Stanford victory although Cal
scored the first blood. After the
first Cal bucket, the team sprang
to life, led by the not-to-be-denied
Mr. Luisetti, and the scorer soon
had 9-2 in favor of the Indians.
California then made a bid for the
lead, running up to 10-9. The Red
men then boosted their total to 17,
and were leading 24-20 at half time.
It was fairly nip-and-tuck the sec
ond half.
Balsey of the Bears loosened up
and led his team into a 28-27 lead.
The ousting of Carlisle on fouls
seemed to irritate the Berkeleyans,
who promptly chalked up 35-29
with but 10 minutes to go.
Hope was at low ebb for the Card
inals then and it looked like another
"championship" hoop squad was
about to disintegrate under fire.
But that would be reckoning with
out Spider Luisetti, who had no
idea of sitting down and seeing
the Blue and Gold win his first
Big Game.
Coolly, cleverly, determinedly,
Luisetti led the attack, with the
able backing of Messers. Turner,
Stoefen, Quade and Zonne. It was
in the bag. Throughout the game

Hank was tossing in his usual run
of uncanny shots—some of them
as he was about to fall on his ear
(literally).
The sophs' one weakness was
fouls. He was too excited to put in

more than 5 out of 7 free throws.
But in motion, he missed fewer.
The frosh disposed of Berkeley
High to make it a bad night for
the transbay lads; the score was
54-27.
