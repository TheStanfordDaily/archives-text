# 'Rush System Proves Failure; Says Pan-Hellenic President
## 
### 
"The events of the past few days
have clearly demonstrated to every
one the obvious defects of our pres
ent rushing system.
"It is hard to explain why there
should be a different feeling this
year than others. But the fact rem
ains that there was a definite im
pression among the sponsors at
Roble that for some reason the
tension among freshman was much
worse than it has ever been.
"Tn Fall Quarter, 1934-35, Pan-
Hellenic changed the system of
rushing to its present form, limit
ing the actual time for rushing to
one week. Many have felt that
this is too short a period to judge
the freshmen fairly.
"The following spring changes
were made in the Bidding Contract
in an attempt to make the contact
between sororities and hall women
more natural. This is the first time
those rules have been tested, and it
seems to me that they failed to ac
complish the desired ends—indeed,
if anything, adding to the confusion.
"The hysteria created by the pres

ent system's unfortunate. It is hope
ed that the excitement will die
down soon so that the matter will
assume normal proportions and
some solution worked out. The
key ta the whole affair would ob
viously be a careful going-over by
Pan-Hellenic of the Constitution,
Bidding Contract, and Rushing
Rules; and through the experience
gained in this past period evolve a
sensible and more smooth-function
ing system."
