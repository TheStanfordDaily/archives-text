# Six Houses Pledge 58 Women
## Low Number Result Of Pan-Hell Penalties 
### 
Since three sororities were banned last night from bidding privil
ages, only 58 pledges were greeted with enthusiastic hugs and kisses
by members of the other six houses.

This number is far less than were
pledged either last year or the year
before and constitutes only a fifth
of the freshmen in Roble. With
the large number from which to
choose, sororities believe that they
have picked the "class" of the fresh
men.
With more women annually
wanting admittance to the Row
the problem of Pan-Hellenic has
led to much worry as to how the
added women should be grouped.
The housing situation grows
more critical with the large number
of freshmen left over who will
join the Hall faction. Already all
available housing space is taken
despite several dormitories added
recently.
Last year Pan-Hellenic limited
the number of women who could
take the pin to very small propor
tions because of over-crowding of
houses in former years.
This year's suspending of rushing
privileges of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Pi Beta Phi, and Alpha Phi has
further reduced the number of
women who might have gone Row.
With nearly 200 freshmen "going
Hall" next year arrangements will
probably need to be made for fur
ther dormitory space. At present
Lagunita Court houses a majority
of the sophomore, junior, and sen
ior women, but Madrono, the Oaks,
the Union, Mariposa, Elm Cottage,
and Manzanita are the homes of
many.
After about eight tonight, the
six sororities who have pledged
will hold open houses so that the
men of the campus may survey and
dance with the new members.
Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Phi
will hold a joint open-house at
tlie Theta house. In most of the
sororities, dancers will "swing" to
the music of three-piece orchestras.
After the male element has been
dispersed, formal pledging of the
frosh will begin and continue until
all of the neophytes are converted
into pledges steadfast and true.
The fledglings will then spend
the remainder of the night in their
respective future homes and enjoy
breakfast tomorrow as their first
official meal at which sisters and
pledges will meet.
Sororities turned in formal pre
ference lists this morning. Fresh
men were required to designate
first, second, and third choices of
houses on a card. The two lists
were then compared and a final
list prepared which indicated a
freshman was to pledge.

list prepared which indicated a
freshman was to pledge.
Since three sororities were banned last night from bidding privil
ages, only 58 pledges were greeted with enthusiastic hugs and kisses
by members of the other six houses.

This number is far less than were
pledged either last year or the year
before and constitutes only a fifth
of the freshmen in Roble. With
the large number from which to
choose, sororities believe that they
have picked the "class" of the fresh
men.
With more women annually
wanting admittance to the Row
the problem of Pan-Hellenic has
led to much worry as to how the
added women should be grouped.
The housing situation grows
more critical with the large number
of freshmen left over who will
join the Hall faction. Already all
available housing space is taken
despite several dormitories added
recently.
Last year Pan-Hellenic limited
the number of women who could
take the pin to very small propor
tions because of over-crowding of
houses in former years.
This year's suspending of rushing
privileges of Kappa Alpha Theta,
Pi Beta Phi, and Alpha Phi has
further reduced the number of
women who might have gone Row.
With nearly 200 freshmen "going
Hall" next year arrangements will
probably need to be made for fur
ther dormitory space. At present
Lagunita Court houses a majority
of the sophomore, junior, and sen
ior women, but Madrono, the Oaks,
the Union, Mariposa, Elm Cottage,
and Manzanita are the homes of
many.
After about eight tonight, the
six sororities who have pledged
will hold open houses so that the
men of the campus may survey and
dance with the new members.
Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Phi
will hold a joint open-house at
tlie Theta house. In most of the
sororities, dancers will "swing" to
the music of three-piece orchestras.
After the male element has been
dispersed, formal pledging of the
frosh will begin and continue until
all of the neophytes are converted
into pledges steadfast and true.
The fledglings will then spend
the remainder of the night in their
respective future homes and enjoy
breakfast tomorrow as their first
official meal at which sisters and
pledges will meet.
Sororities turned in formal pre
ference lists this morning. Fresh
men were required to designate
first, second, and third choices of
houses on a card. The two lists
were then compared and a final
list prepared which indicated a
freshman was to pledge.
