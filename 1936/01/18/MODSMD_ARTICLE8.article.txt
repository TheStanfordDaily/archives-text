# HASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
The only event worthy of com
ment since yesterday's Row Revol
ution was last night's preference
dinner at the Sigma Chi house. The
Pi Phi's and the Sigma Chi's got
together and held a consolation
banquet.
As for the rest of the business,
Our Hasher cannot see anything
really funny in it, and strangely
enough does not wish to fiddle
while the Greeks burn in Pan-Hell.
While sorority women with sick
ly smiles try to pass it off as a
rather feeble joks, the drums of
tragedy are being beaten in the
tear-locked hall of Roble. It is not
enough for our hasher or other
buttinskies to point out to the
freshmen that joining a sorority or
fraternity is not the most impartant
thing in college life.
For in our rather adolescent
manner, we silly humans make of
rushing a personal matter. Upon
it hinges the whole matter of the
individual's desire to know that he
is wanted by someone, even if it is
a tong with large housebills, chipp
ed plaster, and fallen arches.
Of course the frosh will get over
it. The saying is that you can get
over anything but hanging.
But about the sororities? It looks
as if Lagunita is set to pledge the
best class again. Let me add, how
ever, that if the University or its
chosen people proposes to abolish
sororities and fraternities, it must
be prepared to liquidate silver
candlesticks, chapter rooms, and
houses that only a pig or a frat
ernity man would live in.
But these silly stop-gap methods
of trying to invest in any such
competitive, capitalistic tiling as
rushing a Puritan sense of morality!
Americans have always gone under
the theory that rules were made to
be broken. They've had to. Look
at the rules they've had.
The function of rushing is to
select a congenial group of people
in the least expensive, least offen
sive way. Any hi-de-ho restrictions
defeating that purpose arc very,
very expensive luxuries.
In Citizenship they taught us the
Marxian interpretation of history,
but they never teach you things
and expect you to use them.

best class again. Let me add, how
ever, that if the University or its
chosen people proposes to abolish
sororities and fraternities, it must
be prepared to liquidate silver
candlesticks, chapter rooms, and
houses that only a pig or a frat
ernity man would live in.
But these silly stop-gap methods
of trying to invest in any such
competitive, capitalistic tiling as
rushing a Puritan sense of morality!
Americans have always gone under
the theory that rules were made to
be broken. They've had to. Look
at the rules they've had.
The function of rushing is to
select a congenial group of people
in the least expensive, least offen
sive way. Any hi-de-ho restrictions
defeating that purpose arc very,
very expensive luxuries.
In Citizenship they taught us the
Marxian interpretation of history,
but they never teach you things
and expect you to use them.
The only event worthy of com
ment since yesterday's Row Revol
ution was last night's preference
dinner at the Sigma Chi house. The
Pi Phi's and the Sigma Chi's got
together and held a consolation
banquet.
As for the rest of the business,
Our Hasher cannot see anything
really funny in it, and strangely
enough does not wish to fiddle
while the Greeks burn in Pan-Hell.
While sorority women with sick
ly smiles try to pass it off as a
rather feeble joks, the drums of
tragedy are being beaten in the
tear-locked hall of Roble. It is not
enough for our hasher or other
buttinskies to point out to the
freshmen that joining a sorority or
fraternity is not the most impartant
thing in college life.
For in our rather adolescent
manner, we silly humans make of
rushing a personal matter. Upon
it hinges the whole matter of the
individual's desire to know that he
is wanted by someone, even if it is
a tong with large housebills, chipp
ed plaster, and fallen arches.
Of course the frosh will get over
it. The saying is that you can get
over anything but hanging.
But about the sororities? It looks
as if Lagunita is set to pledge the
best class again. Let me add, how
ever, that if the University or its
chosen people proposes to abolish
sororities and fraternities, it must
be prepared to liquidate silver
candlesticks, chapter rooms, and
houses that only a pig or a frat
ernity man would live in.
