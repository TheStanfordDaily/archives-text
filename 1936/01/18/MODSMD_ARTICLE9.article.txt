# Fraternities Claim 272 Yesterday During Men's Pledging
## 
### 
With 272 pledges salted away, 23
of the Farm's 24 fraternities aband
oned "the more abundant life" to
day following a week of intense ex
citement which was climaxed last
night with the Pledge Prom.
Only one fraternity, Sigma Chi,
found itself without official pledges,
being disqualified by the Interfrat
ernity Council on the eve of pledg
ing from initiating any men now in
the lower division until the beginn
ing of winter quarter next year.
This was the first time since Dec
ember 2, 1932 that such a penalty
was imposed upon a fraternity. At
that time Delta Chi was the victim.
Fraternity officials are of the be
lief that a complete revision of
rushing rules will be undertaken by
the Interfraternity Board when it
meets next Tuesday as a result of
the violation and other alleged ir
regularities in rushing activities.
Alpha Delta Phi and Delta Up
silon ended in a dead heat for rush
ing honors, each pledging 17 men.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon followed
closely with 16. Phi Delta Theta
and Phi Gamma Delta tied for
fourth place, listing 15. Others
ranged down to a low of 6. Sigma
Chi, although without an official
pledge class, is understood to have
lined up a good unofficial class to
be pledged and initiated when the
Interfraternity Council's ban is
lifted next year.
Official pledging brought to a
close for this year intermittent rel
ations between the Row and
Pledges will be invited periodically
to dinner by their respective houses,
although by University regulations
they must maintain their rejidences
outside the houses until autumn
quarter. Likewise Row men may
visit their brothers-to-be at Encina.
This year's pledge list of 272
falls short of last year's record mark
of 288 largely because of the dis
qualification of Sigma Chi. Phi
Delta Theta led the 1935 race with
17 pledges.
At Smith College, all girls live

found itself without official pledges,
being disqualified by the Interfrat
ernity Council on the eve of pledg
ing from initiating any men now in
the lower division until the beginn
ing of winter quarter next year.
This was the first time since Dec
ember 2, 1932 that such a penalty
was imposed upon a fraternity. At
that time Delta Chi was the victim.
Fraternity officials are of the be
lief that a complete revision of
rushing rules will be undertaken by
the Interfraternity Board when it
meets next Tuesday as a result of
the violation and other alleged ir
regularities in rushing activities.
Alpha Delta Phi and Delta Up
silon ended in a dead heat for rush
ing honors, each pledging 17 men.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon followed
closely with 16. Phi Delta Theta
and Phi Gamma Delta tied for
fourth place, listing 15. Others
ranged down to a low of 6. Sigma
Chi, although without an official
pledge class, is understood to have
lined up a good unofficial class to
be pledged and initiated when the
Interfraternity Council's ban is
lifted next year.
Official pledging brought to a
close for this year intermittent rel
ations between the Row and
Pledges will be invited periodically
to dinner by their respective houses,
although by University regulations
they must maintain their rejidences
outside the houses until autumn
quarter. Likewise Row men may
visit their brothers-to-be at Encina.
This year's pledge list of 272
falls short of last year's record mark
of 288 largely because of the dis
qualification of Sigma Chi. Phi
Delta Theta led the 1935 race with
17 pledges.
At Smith College, all girls live
in small dormitories and are arbit
rarily assigned to rooms, usually
among strangers.
