SANDRINGHAM, England, Jan.
20 (Monday)—(AP)—While it
was understood there was no
change in King George's condi
tion this morning, medical author
ities looked for a possible crisis
in His Majesty's condition tonight.
LONDON, Jan. 19 (#•). —A Privy
Council, it was learned in an author
itative quarter tonight, will be held
tomorrow at which the Council of
State will be appointed to act for
the King during his illness.
The Privy Council will be held
at Sandringham House, where the
King lies ill.
The decision was disclosed by an
informed source bfter a conference
late today of the Prince of Wales,
Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin,
iifid Viscount Hailsham, the Lord
Chancellor, at Number 10 Downing
Street.
During the King's sickness of
1928 and 1929, the Council of State
consisted of Queen Mary, the
Prince of Wales, the Duke of York,
the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Lord Chancellor—who then,
as now, was Viscount Hailsham—
and the Prime Minister, who then,
as now, was Baldwin.
At that time, the Privy Council
took place in the monarch's sick
room at Buckingham Palace, and it
was thought a similar procedure
might be followed at Sandringham
tomorrow.
