# Players To Aid In Polio Fight
## 
### 
Contrary to general public opin
ion, the President's birthday benefit
performance of the "Doctor's Wife"
is a health measure, not a political
move, sponsors of the performance
declare.
Of the proceeds of the piay given
by the players and members of
ihe original cast, 70 per cent will re
main in this community to go toward
stamping out and preventing in
fantile paralysis, the remainder go
ing to the Warm Springs Founda
tion in Georgia.
Louis Olson, Palo Alto health offi
cer, stated that infantile paralysis
appears in epidemics, and if as much
interest would be shown during the
intervening years as in the epidemic
years the problem would be more
quickly solved.
Patrons and patronesses of the
"Doctor's Wife," which will be
given January 30, in the Assembly
Hall, are: Mayor and Mrs. Charles
H. Judson, President and Mrs. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Mr. and Mrs. Al
mon E. Roth, Mrs. F. H. Fowlwell,
Mrs. Louis Stern, Mrs. J. P. Mitchell,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Norris, Miss
Elizabeth Gamble, Mr. and Mrs.
Fredrick Fowler, Mr. and Mrs. G. L.
MacKenzie, Mr. and Mrs. Edwin J.
Thomas, Mr. and Mrs. Roy Folger,
Dr. and Mrs. Harry Reynolds, Mr.
and Mrs. George V. Lawry, and Dr.
and Mrs. James G. Sharp.
