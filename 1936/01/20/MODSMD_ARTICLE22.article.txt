## Fraternity Board Will Consider Rule Change 
### 
Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi,
and Alpha Phi may face further
punitive restrictions as a result of
violating Pan-Hellenic bidding rules
last week, Jeanne Keesling, Pan-
Hell president, announced yesterday.
Meanwhile, a meeting of the
Interfraternity Board of Control
at noon tomorrow to investigate
widespread rumors of illegal
rushing and to get a cross-section
viewpoint of the Row of changes in
the system, was announced by Ed
Littlcfield, president and chair
man.
The two new developments were
expected to be peaceful followups
of the explosion Thursday and Fri
day that denied initiating and
pledging privileges from Sigma Chi,
and suspended rushing and bidding
for the three sororities.
The meeting of the Interfraternity
Board will be held solely to deter
mine the defects of the present
men's rushing system and to get a
representative viewpoint on pos
sible changes.
"It's purely a meeting for gath
ering and weighing information,"
Littlefield pointed out. "There are
rumors that all the houses vio
lated their rushing agreements.
I know that isn't so. I do want to
find out, and the hoard with me,
just how many houses did violate
the rules, and how we should
change the system, if change is
found necessary."
Miss Keesling expected no fur
ther investigation of houses not
named in the original announcement
of penalties late Friday night in the
second Daily extra.
"We will meet largely to go over
matters," she announced.
