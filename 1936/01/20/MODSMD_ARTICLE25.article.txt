# Muscular Men Required For 'Paths of Glory'
## 
### 
Men of strong physique are need
ed for the 45 male parts of "Paths
of Glory," winter quarter produc
tion to be presented March 6.
If you can qualify, Dramatic Di-
I rector John Uhler wants to see you
in his office, 203C, today between 9
! and 12 or 4 and 6 o'clock, or to
i morrow between 9 and 12 or 2 and 6
o'clock. For at those times he will
hold personal conferences with
! those who will take part in the try
outs tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock
in the Little Theater.
i "The cast of 'Paths of Glory'
must he chosen to give the im
pression of mass strength and
fortitude," said I)r. Uhler. "The
actors represent a small group of
the heroic but tragic 181 st regi
ment of the French army, most of
them already cited for bravery at
the front. I must have men that
can produce the effect of phys
ical stamina and determination.
It's a desperate .job that they un
dertake in the play, and they must
be men that appear capable of
carrying it out."
The 17 scenes of the play are set
r at the battle front just before a
| great French offensiveâ€”in the bar
racks, on the road to the trenches,
i in the dugouts, in an abservation
post. Even the court-martial scenes
I are within the sound of the German
I artillery.
"Tlie situations will strain the
nerves of the audience," declared
Dr. Uhler. "The actors must be far
i stronger."
