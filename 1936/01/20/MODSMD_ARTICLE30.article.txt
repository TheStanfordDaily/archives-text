# Indians Rally To Edge Out California 41-38
## Hank Luisetti Proves Generalship, Scoring 22 Points in Comeback 
### Herb Diamond 
It all happened in 58 seconds.
Coach John Bunn's Indian hoop
sters were trailing the Bears by six
points. The final gun was to sound
within ten minutes. And then it
happened . . . the Redskins un
leashed an attack that tied up the
score in short order and then Hank
Luisetti collected a goal and the
lead.
Bill Quade found the bucket to
make the count 39-35. But the Ber
keleyites were still threatening in

no uncertain terms when Cordes
and Herwig boosted the scoring to
39-38. In a few seconds more, how
ever, the conflict was over. Howell
Turner dropped one through the
hoop and 2500 departing fans glanced
at a scoreboard that read 41-38.
Thrilling as it was, the foregoing
scoring melee tells only part of the
story. There are basketball players
and more basketball players, it
seems, but there is only one Luisetti.
In climbing to the top of the Pa
cific Coast Conference scoring lad
der Friday evening, Hank proved
himself to be a capable field general
as well as a scoring ace. His prowess
is admitted, but credit for the Cardi
nals' triumph can't and won't be
handed to one man.
Among others, Reserve Bob
Zonne is deserving of many plaud
its. "I sent him in during the last
few minutes with instructions to
get the hall off the backboard and
that's just what he did," declares
Bunn. It was Zonne who accom
plished more than any of the
other guards, and thus bolstered
the Indians' chances for victory.
Not to be forgotten is Forward
Bill Quade, who stepped into the
battle to sink two field goals just
when they were needed most. Stan
ford, after a thick and fast exhibi
tion of nip and tuck tallying, held a
slim two-goal lead over the Bears
at half time.
Luisetti Steadies Team
Early in the contest Luisetti suc
cessfully removed a tendency toward
ragged teamwork. Time and again,
the cool and calculating Hank slowly
worked the ball deep into enemy
territory before he would risk a shot.
He steadied the squad as he went,
lending confidence to Stoefen, Cal
derwood, and Zonne—the boys who,
like himself, were playing their first
Big Game.
It was the first string, effectively
prodded by second stringers that
sent the Bears down to defeat.
Rarely was the ball being taken
off the backboard by the Indians
until Zonne went into 1 lie line
up.
Luisetti has been credited with 22
points and also with only 20, for
opinion was divided as to who
scored when he and Stoefen went
up to tip a shot into the basket.
Opinion was not divided, however,
on the fact that Hank scared from
every conceivable angle, many times
from the center of a growling Bear
pack, and spectacular indeed was
his pass interception and single
handed scoring.
Defense Baffles Bears
Bunn's newly devised defense was
clicking well enough to keep the
Californians far from scoring terri-
Tory during most of the evening.
The result was that 10 of the Bears'
15 field goals were scored from be
yond the foul line. The California
aggregation held a decided advan
tage under both hoops, nevertheless,
where rugged tactics gave it most of
the recoveries.
In the opinion of Coach Runn,
"Stanford didn't hit her top form
and I expect better games before
the season is through." Unlike
former tilts in the Big Game series,
Friday's tussle was remarkably
free from fouling, Carlisle, of the
Bears, being the only man sent
from the court on personal fouls.

The result was that 10 of the Bears'
15 field goals were scored from be
yond the foul line. The California
aggregation held a decided advan
tage under both hoops, nevertheless,
where rugged tactics gave it most of
the recoveries.
In the opinion of Coach Runn,
"Stanford didn't hit her top form
and I expect better games before
the season is through." Unlike
former tilts in the Big Game series,
Friday's tussle was remarkably
free from fouling, Carlisle, of the
Bears, being the only man sent
from the court on personal fouls.

It all happened in 58 seconds.
Coach John Bunn's Indian hoop
sters were trailing the Bears by six
points. The final gun was to sound
within ten minutes. And then it
happened . . . the Redskins un
leashed an attack that tied up the
score in short order and then Hank
Luisetti collected a goal and the
lead.
Bill Quade found the bucket to
make the count 39-35. But the Ber
keleyites were still threatening in

no uncertain terms when Cordes
and Herwig boosted the scoring to
39-38. In a few seconds more, how
ever, the conflict was over. Howell
Turner dropped one through the
hoop and 2500 departing fans glanced
at a scoreboard that read 41-38.
Thrilling as it was, the foregoing
scoring melee tells only part of the
story. There are basketball players
and more basketball players, it
seems, but there is only one Luisetti.
In climbing to the top of the Pa
cific Coast Conference scoring lad
der Friday evening, Hank proved
himself to be a capable field general
as well as a scoring ace. His prowess
is admitted, but credit for the Cardi
nals' triumph can't and won't be
handed to one man.
Among others, Reserve Bob
Zonne is deserving of many plaud
its. "I sent him in during the last
few minutes with instructions to
get the hall off the backboard and
that's just what he did," declares
Bunn. It was Zonne who accom
plished more than any of the
other guards, and thus bolstered
the Indians' chances for victory.
Not to be forgotten is Forward
Bill Quade, who stepped into the
battle to sink two field goals just
when they were needed most. Stan
ford, after a thick and fast exhibi
tion of nip and tuck tallying, held a
slim two-goal lead over the Bears
at half time.
Luisetti Steadies Team
Early in the contest Luisetti suc
cessfully removed a tendency toward
ragged teamwork. Time and again,
the cool and calculating Hank slowly
worked the ball deep into enemy
territory before he would risk a shot.
He steadied the squad as he went,
lending confidence to Stoefen, Cal
derwood, and Zonne—the boys who,
like himself, were playing their first
Big Game.
It was the first string, effectively
prodded by second stringers that
sent the Bears down to defeat.
Rarely was the ball being taken
off the backboard by the Indians
until Zonne went into 1 lie line
up.
Luisetti has been credited with 22
points and also with only 20, for
opinion was divided as to who
scored when he and Stoefen went
up to tip a shot into the basket.
Opinion was not divided, however,
on the fact that Hank scared from
every conceivable angle, many times
from the center of a growling Bear
pack, and spectacular indeed was
his pass interception and single
handed scoring.

Bunn's newly devised defense was
clicking well enough to keep the

Not to be forgotten is Forward
Bill Quade, who stepped into the
battle to sink two field goals just
when they were needed most. Stan
ford, after a thick and fast exhibi
tion of nip and tuck tallying, held a
slim two-goal lead over the Bears
at half time.
Luisetti Steadies Team
Early in the contest Luisetti suc
cessfully removed a tendency toward
ragged teamwork. Time and again,
the cool and calculating Hank slowly
worked the ball deep into enemy
territory before he would risk a shot.
He steadied the squad as he went,
lending confidence to Stoefen, Cal
derwood, and Zonne—the boys who,
like himself, were playing their first
Big Game.
It was the first string, effectively
prodded by second stringers that
sent the Bears down to defeat.
Rarely was the ball being taken
off the backboard by the Indians
until Zonne went into 1 lie line
up.
Luisetti has been credited with 22
points and also with only 20, for
opinion was divided as to who
scored when he and Stoefen went
up to tip a shot into the basket.
Opinion was not divided, however,
on the fact that Hank scared from
every conceivable angle, many times
from the center of a growling Bear
pack, and spectacular indeed was
his pass interception and single
handed scoring.
Defense Baffles Bears
Bunn's newly devised defense was
clicking well enough to keep the
Californians far from scoring terri-
Tory during most of the evening.
The result was that 10 of the Bears'
15 field goals were scored from be
yond the foul line. The California
aggregation held a decided advan
tage under both hoops, nevertheless,
where rugged tactics gave it most of
the recoveries.
In the opinion of Coach Runn,
"Stanford didn't hit her top form
and I expect better games before
the season is through." Unlike
former tilts in the Big Game series,
Friday's tussle was remarkably
free from fouling, Carlisle, of the
Bears, being the only man sent
from the court on personal fouls.

It all happened in 58 seconds.
Coach John Bunn's Indian hoop
sters were trailing the Bears by six
points. The final gun was to sound
within ten minutes. And then it
happened . . . the Redskins un
leashed an attack that tied up the
score in short order and then Hank
Luisetti collected a goal and the
lead.
Bill Quade found the bucket to
make the count 39-35. But the Ber
keleyites were still threatening in

no uncertain terms when Cordes
and Herwig boosted the scoring to
39-38. In a few seconds more, how
ever, the conflict was over. Howell
Turner dropped one through the
hoop and 2500 departing fans glanced
at a scoreboard that read 41-38.
Thrilling as it was, the foregoing
scoring melee tells only part of the
story. There are basketball players
and more basketball players, it
seems, but there is only one Luisetti.
In climbing to the top of the Pa
cific Coast Conference scoring lad
der Friday evening, Hank proved
himself to be a capable field general
as well as a scoring ace. His prowess
is admitted, but credit for the Cardi
nals' triumph can't and won't be
handed to one man.
Among others, Reserve Bob
Zonne is deserving of many plaud
its. "I sent him in during the last
few minutes with instructions to
get the hall off the backboard and
that's just what he did," declares
Bunn. It was Zonne who accom
plished more than any of the
other guards, and thus bolstered
the Indians' chances for victory.
