Rooters' tickets for Friday's
hoop contest with U.S.C. will
be on sale tomorrow and Wed
nesday from 9 to 5 o'clock. They
are priced at 40 cents. Frater
nity men are reminded that no
pledge night will interfere with

and, for this reason, last week's
sale of fiOO ducats should be far
surpassed. Early reservations
are advised.
