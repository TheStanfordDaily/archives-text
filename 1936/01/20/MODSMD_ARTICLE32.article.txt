# English Mass Ships, Troops, Planes For Egyptian Protection
## Eden To Face Critical League Council Session 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 19 (/P).—Within
the shadow of the pyramids, reliable
sources revealed tonight, Great
Britain has concentrated her most
powerful war machine since the
World War.
The disclosure came as the
Empire's new foreign secretary,
Anthony Eden, left for Geneva to
face a critical I.eague of Nations
Council session tomorrow, leav
ing behind a British nation wor
ried about the illness of its king.
The Egyptian area, informed per
sons stated, now holds nearly hu.i
the British regular combat army,
between 40 and 80 thousand troops.
They are supported, recent reports
indicate, by 157 warships and be
tween 700 and 800 military planes.
Greatest secrecy has been main
tained concerning the British forces
in Egypt, and neither the native nor
the English press there has printed
news of the troop movements.
This in itself is the greatest
naval and air force the nation has
ever massed along its eastern em
pire route to India and Australia.
While negotiating in Paris and
other European capitals for military
support in the event an emergency
arises out of the Italo-Ethiopian
conflict in the Mediterranean, Brit
ain has been quietly moving her
army to Egypt.
The same sources which dis
closed the British preparations j
said Premier Mussolini of Italy j
was known to have between (»0,- J
000 and 80,000 troops in her col- j
ony of Libya, adjoining Egypt.
It is against these troops that i
Great Britain has coupled military ]
preparedness with her political ef
forts at Geneva.
Geneva's diplomats, however,
generally professed to see a les
sening of the danger that any
European war wiil come from the
Ethiopian conflict.
'I hey wondered whether Italy
might move to reopen peace pro
posals. They pointed out, too, that
other pressing world problems are
due for Council consideration.
As for oil sanctions, unofficial
Geneva sources have expressed the
belief they would be "buried."
