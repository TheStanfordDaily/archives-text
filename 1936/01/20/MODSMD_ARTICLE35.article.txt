# Tiny Silent On Coaching Job
## Nevers To Remain To Coach Frosh Baseball 
### 
While Tiny Thornhill took the
keys to the unoccupied job of back
field coach with him to Kezar to
watch the former backfield coach
take his last swing at western foot
ball, the Monday morning quarter
backs put their heads together to
try to name Ernie Nevers' successor.
Divers and sundry names have
been brought forth for the post,
all with their different merits, in
cluding Murray Cuddeback, Bob
by Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Stan
Anderson, Jimmy Bradshaw,
Frank Wilton, Chuck Srialling,
the Shipkey brothers, and various
others of Stanford's football past
who have selected coaching as a
vocation.
The Board of Athletic Control is
to make the selection on ThornhiU's
recommendation, and judging from
the importance of the position—the
backfield coach is first vice-presi
dent in charge of strategy—it may be
some time before Tiny makes his
recommendation.
Nevers, meanwhile, will remain
on the campus tending his regu
lar duties of freshman baseball
coach until late in March, when he
will leave for his new job in the
East.
