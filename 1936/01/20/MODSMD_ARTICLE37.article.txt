# Monmouth Takes Leap Year Seriously
## 
### 
MONMOUTH, 111., Jan. 19.â€”Leap
year really was leap year at Mon
mouth College over the week-end,
when the co-eds took over the at
tentions usually provided by the
men. The women made the dates,
paid for them, furnished transpor
tation, and all the other little nice
ties.

The new courting system was con
firmed by a vote of the Monmouth
student body, and a law provided
that all violators of this new spirit
would be subject to public trial be
fore the student council.
