# Adventurous Alumnus Meets Treat in China
## 
### Dave Botsford 
'W'hat are you doing here, pro
fessor?"
"Well, Nelson David! What are
you doing here?"
In the lobby of a Nanking,
China, hotel last November, two
men spoke who hadn't seen each
other in years. One was Payson
Treat, Stanford professor of far
eastern history; the other, Nelson
David, 1927 Stanford graduate
who's strayed far from the path of
economics he studied on the Farm
ten years ago.
"Tell me, David, what have you
been doing?" So Nelson David told
the professor.
After he graduated with an A.B.
in economics, David turned to avi
ation. like many youngsters, he
sought his adventures in the air.
Trained in the Army Air Corps,
he was soon stationed in Hawaii,
later transferred to the Philip
pines.
Then his chum cracked-up and
was killed. Heartsick and disillu
sioned, David decided to quit flying
and come home. He sailed on the
next boat for the States by way of
China.
In Shanghai, howevex*, the Chi
nese National Government had
heard of his prowess, and an attrac
tive offer changed Nelson David's
destiny. Aviation was in his blood.
He became personal pilot to China's
generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek.

Since that fateful day, David has
remained in China. But there's a
lot of China. With the com
mander-in-chief of the National
ist forces as his passenger, the
young aviator has looked down
from the clouds upon vast terri
tories never trodden by the foot
of white njen. Time and time
ngain he has soared over the great
west and northwest expanse of
! Asiatic wilderness.
Flying in China, off established air
| routes, is ticklish business. There
| are few flying fields and almost no
I aids to flyers. At night no beacons
! light the way, and even by day
( treacherous mountains yawn up to
i trap disabled flyers.
In Kansu, earthquake-ridden tcr
' ritory fascinated Duvid. The entire
1 surface of the ground was folded
j and twisted. Gi'eat lakes were
j formed by landslides damming up
j streams.
After the hotel meeting, David
was with Professor Treat con
j stantly. He was home-sick. But
j on the second night, orders came
to take off for Canton to pick up
! Nanking government olTicials who
had been negotiating with inde
pendent leaders in the southwest.
Nelson David took off from the
! airport, doubled back to circle the
j hotel three times in farewell, and
roared away into the inky China
1 night.

After the hotel meeting, David
was with Professor Treat con
j stantly. He was home-sick. But
j on the second night, orders came
to take off for Canton to pick up
! Nanking government olTicials who
had been negotiating with inde
pendent leaders in the southwest.
Nelson David took off from the
! airport, doubled back to circle the
j hotel three times in farewell, and
roared away into the inky China
1 night.
'W'hat are you doing here, pro
fessor?"
"Well, Nelson David! What are
you doing here?"
In the lobby of a Nanking,
China, hotel last November, two
men spoke who hadn't seen each
other in years. One was Payson
Treat, Stanford professor of far
eastern history; the other, Nelson
David, 1927 Stanford graduate
who's strayed far from the path of
economics he studied on the Farm
ten years ago.
"Tell me, David, what have you
been doing?" So Nelson David told
the professor.
After he graduated with an A.B.
in economics, David turned to avi
ation. like many youngsters, he
sought his adventures in the air.
Trained in the Army Air Corps,
he was soon stationed in Hawaii,
later transferred to the Philip
pines.
Then his chum cracked-up and
was killed. Heartsick and disillu
sioned, David decided to quit flying
and come home. He sailed on the
next boat for the States by way of
China.
In Shanghai, howevex*, the Chi
nese National Government had
heard of his prowess, and an attrac
tive offer changed Nelson David's
destiny. Aviation was in his blood.
He became personal pilot to China's
generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek.

Since that fateful day, David has
remained in China. But there's a
lot of China. With the com
mander-in-chief of the National
ist forces as his passenger, the
young aviator has looked down
from the clouds upon vast terri
tories never trodden by the foot
of white njen. Time and time
ngain he has soared over the great
west and northwest expanse of
! Asiatic wilderness.
Flying in China, off established air
| routes, is ticklish business. There
| are few flying fields and almost no
I aids to flyers. At night no beacons
! light the way, and even by day
( treacherous mountains yawn up to
i trap disabled flyers.
In Kansu, earthquake-ridden tcr
