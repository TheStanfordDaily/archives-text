# Bruins Press Troy In Defeat 38-38
## 
### 
Caddy Works' U.C.L.A. cagers
made further threatening inroads on
Stanford-U.S.C. supremacy by
pressing Troy all the way Friday
night in a tilt finally won by Troy,
158-36. The tightness of the score
indicates a new team to fight for
Coast honors, with the Bruins right
next to the Trojans and Indians, and
Cal lurking on the cellar steps.
Saturday night saw the expected
Santa Clara win over St. Mary's,
36-32. A money-playing sub for
ward was the only thing that saved
the Broncs from an upset.
