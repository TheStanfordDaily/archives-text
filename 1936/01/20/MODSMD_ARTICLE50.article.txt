# Frosh Beat Berkeley High, Marin Jaysee
## Phil Zonne Takes High Scoring Honors in Two Games with 35 Points 
### 
Meeting .surprisingly little oppo
sition, the Stanford freshman bas
ketball team chalked up two more
wins over the week-end. Berkeley
High School fell Friday night, 54 to
27, in the Big Gome preliminary, and
Marin Junior College succumbed,
39 to 19, Saturday evening.
Although Berkeley was not ex
petted to give the frosh much
trouble, the record high score
made by Jimmy Bradshaw's five
was unlooked-for. With Dick
Nccley, big yearling guard, help
ing Phil Zonnc pepper the basket,
the Indians piied up a 2X-S lead at
half time. Bradshaw kept his reg
ulars in the game longer than
usual, to develop teamwork, and
the frosh scored nearly as often in
the second half.
Zonne was high-point man again
with 17, but Nceley was a close sec
ond with 14. Neeley, though a guard,
gets under the basket almost as
rnuc has Zonne, who plays center.
The Marin Juysees were sup
posed to come to the Pavilion Fri
day night, and Berkeley High
Saturday. Only a few minutes be
fore the opening whistle Friday
the Card babes learned that iheir
opponents had been switched.
Proving that the change didn't
bother them, Bradshaw's men had
just as easy a time with Marin, be
fore a much smaller crowd. Con
querors of the frosh by a 39-36 mar
gin last month, the visitors failed to
match Stanford's improvement, and
never had a chance. Half-time score
was 19-6 for the Thirty-niners, and
the Papooses scored 20 points in the
second half to 13 for the jaysees.
The frosh missed numerous set
ups and played a mediocre floor
game Saturday night, but Marin
Junior College showed very little.
LaFranchi and Petty, Marin for
wards, could do little in the way of
scoring, and setups by Zonne and
Neeley, and two beautiful long shots
by Pete McArthur cinched the game
for the yearlings before the inter
mission.
Getting so many "sucker" shots
that they were bound to sink quite
a few. the babes gradually in
creased their score as the game
drew to a close. The starting line
up, composed of Lyman Calkins
and Jack Kessell at forwards;
Zonne at center, and Neeley and
McArthur at guards, played the
entire game.
Zonne once more led the scorers
with 18 points. McArthur, a dead
eye on a straight shot from just be
yond the foul circle, made eight to
take runner-up honors. Neeley
counted six, Calkins four, and Kes
sell three. Petty led Marin with six.
