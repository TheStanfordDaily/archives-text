# Indian Ruggers Win 3 Matches
## Varsity Beats Medicos Minus Vigna, Zamloch 
### 
Three Stanford rugby teams were
on the long end of scores in games
Saturday.
The Indian varsity, handicapped
by the loss of Joe Vigna and Arch
Zamloch, barely nosed out an under
rated Stanford Medical School fif
teen, 5-0. In the preliminary
matches, the Indian seconds fin
ished on the upper end of a 6-3
score against Argonaut reserves,
while the alumni team took another
Argonaut aggregation, 13-0.
Jim Mullens, veteran Indian rug
ger, scored his first try in many sea
sons. Mullens played good ball
thx - oughout the day, scoring in ihe
first period. Bansbach made the
conversion good; he hasn't missed
one so far this season.
Backfield men were handicapped
and slowed down by the loss of Cap
tain Joe Vigna, who was taken out
during the first few minutes of play.
Vigna collided with an opposing
player and, much to his disgust, was
sent from the field by Coach Jim
Wylie.
Zamloch, fullback, hurt on the
same play was also taken out. Baer
juries received last week. Baer
filled his place pretty well and
showed that he is an up and com
ing player, especially in his kick
ing.
The forwards were the mainstay
of the Stanford varsity. Giff Myers
managed to get away with the ball
for several good runs. Merritt, Mon
davi, and Richardson all turned in
good performances for the day.
Wayne Richardson, playing his first
game, looked olceh, a little more
practice and he should fill a first
string berth.
Medical students' team showed
lots of strength and power, man
aging to get out of several tight
places and put on a last minute
drive that almost resulted in a
score.
Second stringers still looked a bit
ragged, but considering their expe
rience, came through with flying col
ors. Bowen and Kump scored for
the reserves.
The "Cotton Club," or alumni
team, proved that they are going to
be one of the toughest teams in the
rugby union. Later in the season the
alumni-varsity mix-up should prove
a good match. Boyd, Van Dellen,
and Forhan scored the tries.
