# All-Stars Trim Honolulu Again
## Reisner's 60-yard Run Livens Up Slow Game 
### 
Johnny Reisner, Indian halfback,
ran wild to lead Pop Warner's all
star football team to its second tri
umph, 17 to 6, over the Honolulu
town team, Friday night in the island
city. Averaging 20 yards on eight
plays, and running 60 yards for the
first touchdown, the little senior en
livened what would have been a dull
game.
The St. Mary's passing combina
tion of Herb Schreiber to Eddie
Erdelatz gave the mainlanders
their second score, late in the
first half, after a long drive. Syl
vester Rice, end, added both ex
tra po : ;ts and kicked a 25-yard
field goal early in the last quarter.
Bobby Grayson, fullback on the
continental team, was held in check,
but the Townies, while watching
him, let the fleet Reisner get away.
The Warner team's victory was its
second straight over the Honolulans,
who had lost by a 25-7 score a week
earlier.
