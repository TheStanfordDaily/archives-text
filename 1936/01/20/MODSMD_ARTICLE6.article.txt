### 
According .to Chuck Schafer,
manager and founder of the speak
ers' bureau, several misconceptions
have been formed about the organ
ization, its purpose and members.
The first point was that the bu
reau was organized to give students
a chance to improve their speaking
ability by actual experience and its
purpose was not to send speakers
out to various clubs to 'sell Stan
ford.'
Secondly, Schaefer has announced
that more than a handful of students
have shown interest in the organiza
tion. At the present, time 20 students
have signed up for participation.
The third point is concerning the
topics the students will use. Any
subject at all may be chosen, as long
as it will interest adult audiences.
Topics from Communism to art may
be selected, as long as they will be
of interest.
Letters are being prepared to send
various sex-vice clubs on the Penin
sula asking their reactions to the
bureau, the type of subject they
would be interested in, number of
speakers and the length of talks
preferred.
More speakers are wanted and
