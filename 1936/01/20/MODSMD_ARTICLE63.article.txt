# 'Tiny' Starts Spring Football Practice
## 
### 
In Coach Tiny Thornhill's opin
ion, football is the coming year
around sport. Getting an early start
in spring practice with the remnants
of last year's Red Machine and 25
new men from the frosh, Thornhill
has held three practices a week
since Jan. 9.

The toughest problem facing Tiny
is the repairing of the front wall,
down by the loss of six
j seniors. The center hole may be
filled by the shift of Wally DeWitt
! from fullback to the middle of the
j line. Pete Zagar, huge freshman
; tackle, is also expected to fill one of
I the vacated berths.
