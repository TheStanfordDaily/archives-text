# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Other Houses, 42 Frosh, and University Hit as Hard as Penalized Sororities 
### 
Charges and counter - charges thrown by,
and at, the women of Stanford's Row this
week-end developed into a inud-fest which, in
their sweeping effects, completely overshad
owed revelations of an odorous fraternity
rushing system that had excited the campus
bid a day or two earlier.
As in the case of the fraternities, the
sorority rushing system was blown sky high,
and in the explosion it was clearly seen that
I lie whole system was so full of defects that
a thorough renovation has become a virtual
(necessity.
The changes undoubtedly will come; in the
meantime, a microscopic inspection of the
Committee of Three's decision might be in
order.
In the first place, the penalty will place the
convicted houses in a bad financial spot; they
will be fortunate if they can legally house
20 women apiece next fall, which means but
20 house bills during that three-month period.
The second, and possibly most important,
effect is that rushing will be literally uncon
trolled during autumn quarter. The present
unofficially pledged frosh class of each of the
three houses will continue to live in the dor
mitories, will have free contact with fresh
men, and so will be in the best possible posi
tion lo high-pressure rushees in a manner
unheard-of lo the Stanford Row.
Furthermore, the rulings leave the Univer

sily with an acute and ironic housing prob
lem. They will have some 42 extra women
thrown on them with no apparent place to
put them; yet the three penalized houses will
have about 14 empty beds apiece.
Finally, the prospective pledges of these
three sororities, through no fault of their own,
were deprived of the thrill of pledge night,
an experience to which they had been looking
forward since they first moved into Rohle; the
personal blow was felt much more by these
sisters-elect than by the members of any
house.
The penalties, consequently, hit in the
wrong directions—they hurt where there is
no need for a hurt; they introduce compli
cations that have no place in an already too
complex system. The only constructive effect
of the entire expose seemingly is that it brings
the rottenness of the rushing set-up into the
open, and lines it up beside the fraternity
rushing system as they both await the pend
ing cleansing.
While the bath-water is heating, however,
the Committee of Three might right a far
reaching wrong by changing the manner of
penalizing the sentenced houses. Now that
they have been duly exposed, the committee
apparently would do well to permit ollicial
pledging for these sororities in June, and to
allow the neophytes to move into the houses
next September.

a thorough renovation has become a virtual
(necessity.
The changes undoubtedly will come; in the
meantime, a microscopic inspection of the
Committee of Three's decision might be in
order.
In the first place, the penalty will place the
convicted houses in a bad financial spot; they
will be fortunate if they can legally house
20 women apiece next fall, which means but
20 house bills during that three-month period.
The second, and possibly most important,
effect is that rushing will be literally uncon
trolled during autumn quarter. The present
unofficially pledged frosh class of each of the
three houses will continue to live in the dor
mitories, will have free contact with fresh
men, and so will be in the best possible posi
tion lo high-pressure rushees in a manner
unheard-of lo the Stanford Row.
Furthermore, the rulings leave the Univer

sily with an acute and ironic housing prob
lem. They will have some 42 extra women
thrown on them with no apparent place to
put them; yet the three penalized houses will
have about 14 empty beds apiece.
Finally, the prospective pledges of these
three sororities, through no fault of their own,
were deprived of the thrill of pledge night,
an experience to which they had been looking
forward since they first moved into Rohle; the
personal blow was felt much more by these
sisters-elect than by the members of any
house.
The penalties, consequently, hit in the
wrong directions—they hurt where there is
no need for a hurt; they introduce compli
cations that have no place in an already too
complex system. The only constructive effect
of the entire expose seemingly is that it brings
the rottenness of the rushing set-up into the
open, and lines it up beside the fraternity
rushing system as they both await the pend
ing cleansing.
While the bath-water is heating, however,
the Committee of Three might right a far
reaching wrong by changing the manner of
penalizing the sentenced houses. Now that
they have been duly exposed, the committee
apparently would do well to permit ollicial
pledging for these sororities in June, and to
allow the neophytes to move into the houses
next September.
Charges and counter - charges thrown by,
and at, the women of Stanford's Row this
week-end developed into a inud-fest which, in
their sweeping effects, completely overshad
owed revelations of an odorous fraternity
rushing system that had excited the campus
bid a day or two earlier.
As in the case of the fraternities, the
sorority rushing system was blown sky high,
and in the explosion it was clearly seen that
I lie whole system was so full of defects that
a thorough renovation has become a virtual
(necessity.
