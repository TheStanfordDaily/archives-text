# Wanted: Better Co-operation For On-Campus Dances
## 
### 
In view of the fact that all of the larger
ollicial student dances arc required to he on
campus, it seems only reasonable to expect
the fullest co-operation from campus authori
ties toward putting on successful dances.
Complaints at present hold that this co
operation has not been forthcoming. The
complaints lie on two scores—that insuttieient
time for decorating the Women's Gym is al
lowed; mid that inspection for fire hazards
always come at such a late hour that dilii
culty in conforming to lire regulations is en
countered.
Decorations for the Women's Gym are com
plicated and time-taking. Done as they are
by students, not professionals, and entailing
the placing of heavy orchestra stands, large
backdrops, and much wiring, the more time
allowed, the less trouble.
Yet decorators are not let into the gym until
after f> o'clock. Although some preliminary
work can be done after 5 o'clock on the day
preceding the dance, most of the work must
be done between ."> and 8 or 9 o'clock imme
diately before the dance.
This rushes the decorators and inconven
iences them, since many arc also orchestra
members. Then when the decorations are
about complete, the check-up for (ire hazards
is made, often entailing last-minute changes.
The plea, then, is for early inspection and
instructions from the lire department and
earlier access to the gym. Women's gym
classes are supposed to prevent earlier admis

sion to the gym, hut it would seem that classes
could he moved to another room, held earlier,
or even occasionally postponed for the bigger
dances —Pledge Prom and others.
If there were a free choice of sites for
dances, possihlv these complaints would he
less justified. But since dances are almost
limited to the gym—the pavilion being the
only real alternative—it would appear that
these small items could he corrected by those
in authoritv.
