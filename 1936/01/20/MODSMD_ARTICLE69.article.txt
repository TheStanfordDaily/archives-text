■ S IT ALL O'VER?
If rushi-rfc -as wake up this merr, Monday
with a bad la e in their mouths, no one will be sur
prised -least 01 all the people concerned. For though
t£e K w is ostensibly sound and healthy there is a
rumbling in its nether regions, pains up its spine, and
a substance in its brain that feels like hot lead. ,
fn short, the How has a hangover—a typical Stan
ford hangover, may we add—a result of overindulgence
in stuffy formality, official buncombe, and a refusal to
face obvious truths.
* * * * ,
After stripping away the verbal bric-a-brac that
clutters up the issue, certain facts remain, as incon
trovertible as facts always are: First, as an example,
Sigma Chi was penalized not because it did something
actually wrong but something legally wrong; second,
what Sigma Chi did was probably done by some other
Stanford fraternities, a something that is officially
illegal, but practically unavoidable; third, that because
an unworkable law so ordained, interfraternity au
thorities were bound to invoke penalties on acts they
knew implied only moral guilt, and acts which no one
took too seriously.
* * * *
Like a Republican administration's restriction of
trusts, the Board of Control's penalties on Sigma Chi,
which read like a penitentiary sentence, are in reality
the mildest dismissal of charges. More than formalized
nonsense, the board's action is a confession by those
who know best, that the rushing system isn't effective,
hasn't much reason for existence, and is being pre
served not because it is a good set of laws but because
it is the only set fraternities have.
♦ * * ♦
No one, perhaps least of all the Row, wants an
archy and the resumption of sandbagging and kid
naping freshmen. That there should be a mutually
satisfactory means of control is obvious. But that
means of control should recognize the fact that most
freshmen, even those who haven't a chance, would like
fraternity life and want to pledge; that natural frater
nity men will clique off in halls as easily as on the
Row; that neither the frosh nor the Row want to be
protected from each other as the present rushing sys
tem tries to do; that the Row hasn't so many chances
for individual unhappiness as the restrictions of the
present rushing system would indicate.
* * * *
For all concerned, it seems advisable to place
the Einsteinian numerator of the rushing formula ov?r
a common denominator of common sense, then to
divide through, letting the minus quantities fall whrre
they would. Everyone then might face simple
social truths of mathematical certainty—truths as axio
matic as two and two making four.

For all concerned, it seems advisable to place
the Einsteinian numerator of the rushing formula ov?r
a common denominator of common sense, then to
divide through, letting the minus quantities fall whrre

social truths of mathematical certainty—truths as axio
matic as two and two making four.

If rushi-rfc -as wake up this merr, Monday
with a bad la e in their mouths, no one will be sur
prised -least 01 all the people concerned. For though
t£e K w is ostensibly sound and healthy there is a
rumbling in its nether regions, pains up its spine, and
a substance in its brain that feels like hot lead. ,

ford hangover, may we add—a result of overindulgence
in stuffy formality, official buncombe, and a refusal to
face obvious truths.

After stripping away the verbal bric-a-brac that
clutters up the issue, certain facts remain, as incon
trovertible as facts always are: First, as an example,
Sigma Chi was penalized not because it did something
actually wrong but something legally wrong; second,
what Sigma Chi did was probably done by some other
Stanford fraternities, a something that is officially
illegal, but practically unavoidable; third, that because
an unworkable law so ordained, interfraternity au
thorities were bound to invoke penalties on acts they
knew implied only moral guilt, and acts which no one
took too seriously.
* * * *
Like a Republican administration's restriction of
trusts, the Board of Control's penalties on Sigma Chi,
which read like a penitentiary sentence, are in reality
the mildest dismissal of charges. More than formalized
nonsense, the board's action is a confession by those
who know best, that the rushing system isn't effective,
hasn't much reason for existence, and is being pre
served not because it is a good set of laws but because
it is the only set fraternities have.

No one, perhaps least of all the Row, wants an
archy and the resumption of sandbagging and kid
naping freshmen. That there should be a mutually
satisfactory means of control is obvious. But that
means of control should recognize the fact that most
freshmen, even those who haven't a chance, would like
fraternity life and want to pledge; that natural frater
nity men will clique off in halls as easily as on the
Row; that neither the frosh nor the Row want to be
protected from each other as the present rushing sys
tem tries to do; that the Row hasn't so many chances
for individual unhappiness as the restrictions of the
present rushing system would indicate.
