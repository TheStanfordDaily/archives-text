# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
Now that the desert madness has subsided to some
extent, the hashers can settle down to breaking plates
and spilling soup in their regular manner.
Major hashing butch of the week is credited to
Firehorse Levit, venerable Chi O hasher. On prefer
ence night Levit was peering through the window in
the pantry door to see if the customers wanted sec
onds on water. Backing him up was a second hasher.
The second hasher gave a playful shove. Levit's head
struck the window. Bang-bang. Two shots crashed out
in the dark. The girls jumped. Broken ghss sprayed
the dining room.
Poking through the gaping hole was the venerable
head. "Well, the glasses seem pretty full," said Levit
and pulled his head back in.
The girls explained to the rushees: "The hashers
have so much fun, you know."
We have reports that the Gamma Phi Betas have
developed a new rushing stunt. One of the sisters,
who hails from the islands, put on a hula-hula dance
for the freshmen. I don't know how it affected the
rushees, but it almost pledged six hashers.
A fitting memorial to four years' uninterrupted
service to Stanford, the 8.A.C., and the Reserve Book
Room was appropriately climaxed this week-end, when
the Alexander G. Trompas memorial bench was dedi
cated in the Stanford Library.
Seasons have come and gone; birds have flown
south and have come back, queerly enough, in time
for the duck-hunting season; autumn has turned the
verdant hills to russet (not illegal russet, please)
but Mr. Trompas has remained tranquil and unchanged
in his favorite third-aisle seat in the Reserve Book
Room. Econ, history, all the social sciences, have felt
the kindly ministrations of the Trompas touch as he
has slapped the books week days and Sundays.
In recognition of his outstanding devotion to schol
asticism, accordingly two girlish admirers (rumor has
it), installed on the favorite and favored seat this sign,
etched in enduring strips of tin and lead:
No Trespassing
Trompas Memorial Bench
But alas, the strips could not endure a vandal's
dessecrating hand, for the next day the honored seat
was found naked of its adornment.
Some say an unfeeling janitor did it. Others say
that Mr. Van Patten in person came down and took
it off. While there is some authority for the belief
that it was the hand of Alexander G. Trompas himself.

We have reports that the Gamma Phi Betas have
developed a new rushing stunt. One of the sisters,
who hails from the islands, put on a hula-hula dance
for the freshmen. I don't know how it affected the
rushees, but it almost pledged six hashers.
A fitting memorial to four years' uninterrupted
service to Stanford, the 8.A.C., and the Reserve Book
Room was appropriately climaxed this week-end, when
the Alexander G. Trompas memorial bench was dedi
cated in the Stanford Library.
Seasons have come and gone; birds have flown
south and have come back, queerly enough, in time
for the duck-hunting season; autumn has turned the
verdant hills to russet (not illegal russet, please)
but Mr. Trompas has remained tranquil and unchanged
in his favorite third-aisle seat in the Reserve Book
Room. Econ, history, all the social sciences, have felt
the kindly ministrations of the Trompas touch as he
has slapped the books week days and Sundays.
In recognition of his outstanding devotion to schol
asticism, accordingly two girlish admirers (rumor has
it), installed on the favorite and favored seat this sign,
etched in enduring strips of tin and lead:
No Trespassing
Trompas Memorial Bench
But alas, the strips could not endure a vandal's
dessecrating hand, for the next day the honored seat
was found naked of its adornment.
Some say an unfeeling janitor did it. Others say
that Mr. Van Patten in person came down and took
it off. While there is some authority for the belief
that it was the hand of Alexander G. Trompas himself.
Now that the desert madness has subsided to some
extent, the hashers can settle down to breaking plates
and spilling soup in their regular manner.
Major hashing butch of the week is credited to
Firehorse Levit, venerable Chi O hasher. On prefer
ence night Levit was peering through the window in
the pantry door to see if the customers wanted sec
onds on water. Backing him up was a second hasher.
The second hasher gave a playful shove. Levit's head
struck the window. Bang-bang. Two shots crashed out
in the dark. The girls jumped. Broken ghss sprayed
the dining room.
Poking through the gaping hole was the venerable
head. "Well, the glasses seem pretty full," said Levit
and pulled his head back in.
The girls explained to the rushees: "The hashers
have so much fun, you know."
