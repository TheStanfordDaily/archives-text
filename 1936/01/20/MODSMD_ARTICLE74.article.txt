# PAY THEIR TUITION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Three days during the past week
you have run editorials against the
"gravy train" for footbail players.
For the sake of conservative argu
ment, I object.
1. If a football player cannot at
tend college unless he works, why
should not dear old B.A.C. provide
.000,000,001 per cent of its profits in
order to make it easier for the needy
player to stay in school. There are
many bright players, but is it not too
much to expect them to get much
scholastic advantage from their
school work if the pressure of fi
nances requires them to hash for
meals, hold down a sponsorship or
some other job for room, and put in
30 hours NYA time per month for
15 pieces of wampum sorely needed
for books, opium and other indis
pensible incidentals in addition to
giving the B.A.C. three hours per
day during the entire season, plus
a considerable amount of time de
voted to spring practice. It shoujd
be remembered that other self-sup
porting students who give time to

the 8.A.C., handling the crowds at
the games, get paid approximately 50
cents per hour for their services.
2. The point to be emphasized
from the preceding paragraph is that
outright assistance to needy ath
letes is the least a college can do.
Further, it would be far more in
keeping with the integrity of the in
stitution to make financial con
cessions than concessions concern
ing scholastic requirements.*
3. In conclusion, I agx-ee with your
stand that the situation should be
dealt with openly; however, I be
lieve giving athletes scholarships
would be a genuine help to them and
would not impair the amateur na
ture of college athletics. After all,,
no athlete would consider the pay
ment of his tuition as an inducement
of professionalizing college sports,
and many would recognize intellec
tual sincerity as well as glorifying
its names in the sports sections of
the papers.

no athlete would consider the pay
ment of his tuition as an inducement
of professionalizing college sports,
and many would recognize intellec
tual sincerity as well as glorifying
its names in the sports sections of
the papers.

The Editor, Sir:
Three days during the past week
you have run editorials against the
"gravy train" for footbail players.
For the sake of conservative argu
ment, I object.
1. If a football player cannot at
tend college unless he works, why
should not dear old B.A.C. provide
.000,000,001 per cent of its profits in
order to make it easier for the needy
player to stay in school. There are
many bright players, but is it not too
much to expect them to get much
scholastic advantage from their
school work if the pressure of fi
nances requires them to hash for
meals, hold down a sponsorship or
some other job for room, and put in
30 hours NYA time per month for
15 pieces of wampum sorely needed
for books, opium and other indis
pensible incidentals in addition to
giving the B.A.C. three hours per
day during the entire season, plus
a considerable amount of time de
voted to spring practice. It shoujd
be remembered that other self-sup
porting students who give time to

the 8.A.C., handling the crowds at
the games, get paid approximately 50
cents per hour for their services.
2. The point to be emphasized
from the preceding paragraph is that
outright assistance to needy ath
letes is the least a college can do.
Further, it would be far more in
keeping with the integrity of the in
stitution to make financial con
cessions than concessions concern
ing scholastic requirements.*
3. In conclusion, I agx-ee with your
stand that the situation should be
dealt with openly; however, I be
lieve giving athletes scholarships
would be a genuine help to them and
would not impair the amateur na
ture of college athletics. After all,,
no athlete would consider the pay
ment of his tuition as an inducement
of professionalizing college sports,
and many would recognize intellec
tual sincerity as well as glorifying
its names in the sports sections of
the papers.
