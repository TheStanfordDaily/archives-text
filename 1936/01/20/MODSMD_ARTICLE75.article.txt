"CAPTAIN BLOOD''
| At the Stanford Theater
A "Captain Blood" is just
the thing for dopes like us
who sit around all day with
our intellect. With adventure
at the low point it is today, it takes
pages of piracy out of the past to
reveal that real fun and happiness
comes not from dreaming but from
getting out and doing things.
Errol Flynn, who boxed in the 1928
Olympics and played Fletcher Chris
tian in the English-version of "Mu
tiny on the Bounty," makes his
American debut at Peter Blood in
Warners' filmization of Rafael Saba
tini's "Captain Blood." Just the man
for the part, Flynn's stubborn
brawny Irishness makes the sea
fights, (he dueling, and the loving
not much of that) even
more exciting and entertaining.
"Captain Blood" is in a class with
"Mutiny on the Bounty" and yet it
isn't. The tale of the muiiny against
Captain Bligh told of men's hates
j and loves, and pled for a cause. It
! was an artistic masterpiece. "Cap
j tain Blood" is sheer blood and thun-'
| der, and proud of it.
Lovely Olivia de Haviland sof'ens
! the story, and Peter Blood, just
1 enough. That girl has something.
