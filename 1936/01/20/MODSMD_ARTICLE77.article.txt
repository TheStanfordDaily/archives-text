TIIE PARILLA was, our stooge
reported, quite a brawl. If any of
you have seen the Frisco papers'
| write-ups of it, you've seen how
; they hint at things we can't even
j think of. (You should have seen
; this before the editor censored it.)
"The only trouble with the af
i fair," said our stooge, "was too many
! copys. Every time some gal started
j to remove whatever scanties she had
on and do a hoochy-koochy dance,
i the cops moved in. And every time
J a couple got off in a corner, the cops
broke that up, too.
"The pageant was really some
j thingâ€”as .spectacular as a pageant
j could be. But a good many people
j weren't paying much attention to
| that or anything else."
| TOM COAKLEY gets an NBC
| wire out of the Frantic starting to
morrow night. His first broadcast
will be on KGO and a coast-to-coast
net at 9:08. He'll play at various
times on one or the other of the
NBC Coast nets every night but
I Monday.
With Coakley's switch, CBS is left
out in the cold as far as good San
Francisco orchestras are concerned.
Guess most of their dance music will
be coming from L.A. now.
"PRIVATE LIVES," Noel Cow
ard's dizzy and insane comedy,
plays Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day nights at Paly's Community
Theater, with Fred Clark, Bob Gar
red, and Jean Albertson of the cam
pus in three of the four lead roles.
