# Duke of York Next In English Royal Line, Says Dr. Brand
## 
### 
With the death of his father,
George V, the Prince of Wales au
tomatically became Edward VIII,
and Queen Mary becomes the Queen
Mother or the Dowager, according
to Dr. Carl Fromont Brand, asso
ciate professor of history.
Next in line of succession is the
Duke of York, then his daughter,
Princess Elizabeth. All of the Duke
of York's line must be exhausted
before the Duke of Gloucester can
claim succession. The Duke of
Kent, King George's fourth son, is
next in line.
The new king is a bachelor by
choice, Dr. Brand believes, and may
not ever marry. If he chooses a
wife of royal lineage, he & ioaay
restricted to the reigning families of
three Scandinavian countries, Hol
land. Yugoslavia, and Greece.
There are no recognized royal
families in Britain other than the
Windsors, but t'ne king may select
the daughter of a British peer or
the daughter of a high-ranking
noble in any of the colonies.
