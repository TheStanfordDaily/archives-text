# Smoking May Be Banned In Examinations
## Ex Committee Will Be Asked To Pass Ruling 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils de
cided in a joint meeting last night
to submit a petition to Ex Commit
tee tonight to pass a rule against
smoking in examinations. Members
of bcth councils will appear before
Ex Committee to back the new pro
posal and to promise to enforce the
rule if it is ratified.
Bob Gros, student manager,
said there arc three reasons for
the proposed rule. The first is
that the clouds of tobacco smoke
which arc a part of final examina
tions are always annoying and
sometimes harmful to the non
smokers, while many smokers
complain that the atmosphere gets
too thick for their own comfort.
The second reason expressed by
Gros was that the University has al
ways had low insurance rates, partly
because of non-smoking traditions,
and to safeguard these low rates,
smoking on the Quad must be stop
ped.
The third reason outlined by Gros
was that the students of Stanford
owe it to the memory of Mrs. Stan
ford to comply with her request
about no smoking on the Quad.
The matter was brought before
the councils by a letter from
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
which he enclosed a copy of a
note written by a student on his
examination booklet during final
examinations last quarter. The
note read as follows:
' Not that my personal opinion
matters much, but why could it not
be considered at least a minor breach
of the honor code to smoke in ex
ams? A room full of smoke gives
me actual physical discomfort and
probably decreases my efficiency. I
don't like to be a kill-joy or a sour
puss, but after all, why have the
rule if it is not respected?"
