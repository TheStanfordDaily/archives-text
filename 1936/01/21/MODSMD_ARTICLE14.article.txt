# New Actors Added To Comedy's Cast
## 
### 
Two important additions to the
cast of the coming production of
"The Doctor's Wife" are Mac Gor
don and Johnny Mottram in the part
of two undertaker's assistants. These
Iwo add one of the highlights of
comedy to the performance in the
scene in which they kidnap the
doctor on a stretcher.
This will be the first performance
for either Gordon or Mottram in a
play on the Stanford stage, although
Gordon has been one of the prin
cipal contributors of songs for the
Gaieties for the last four years, and
composed the entire score of "The
Follies Bourgeois" last spring.
