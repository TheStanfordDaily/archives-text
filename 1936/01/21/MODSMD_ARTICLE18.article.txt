## 
### John Rice 
A socialistic revolution wrecking
II Duce's dictatorship of Italy and
possibly dethroning King Victor
Emanuel will occur before the end
of the year unless Mussolini's
Ethiopian campaign is successful,
Dr. Edward M. Hulme, professor of
history, declared yesterday.
"Even a blind man can sec that
disaster is not far away," he stated.
"Italy's only three resources, cli-_
mate, the beauty of its art, and
the industry of its workers, have
been strained almost to the break
ing point.
"Mussolini can hope for no
more financial aid from his own
people, and his credit with foreign
governments and bankers is no
longer accepted. We hear of defeats
in Africa and of desertions at home.
Even though France and England
may help to avert the impending
catastrophe, the outlook is gloomy."
Of all the European nations, I)r.
Hulme pointed out, Germany,
France, and Italy are in the worst
financial condition, and of these
three, "Italy is the one closest to
the bottom."
With an almost complete lack of
basic natural resources, Italy has
had to buy eoai, iron, cotton, and
oil supplies no longer available now
that her credit is" exhausted, he
stated. A mounting national debt in
the face of enormous war expenses

will put the nation into bankruptcy.
"Italians may support II Ducc
until next autumn's dry season in
Ethiopia, but if his campaign Is
not successful then, I expect to
see a socialistic revolution, al
though one not as drastic as that
initiating Russian Communism."
"Meanwhile, domestic conditions
force Mussolini to continue the war,
for if he gives up now, all is over,"
Dr. Hulme declared.
"The revolution, if and when it
comes, may possibly sweep the royal
family of Italy with II Duce. If
that happens, England will be the
only major monarchy in the western
world."
