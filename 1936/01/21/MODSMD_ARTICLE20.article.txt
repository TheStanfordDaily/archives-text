# Deadline Near for Injun Name-thinkers
## 
### 
Because the number of bright
young men and women who have '
submitted pretty names for the Hon
est Injun has leaped by bounds, The
Daily Contest Editor announces that
nine prizes have been added to the
ten-buck one already posted. Nine
cartons of Philip Morris cigarettes
will be given to the runners-up as
consolation prizes.
Today is the last day Stanford
Indians will have a chance to think
up funny names for Honest In- j
jun. Tomorrow at noon the great t
tcn-buck contest closes.
Entries have been pouring in at a
dizzy rale, but Our Hasher, one of
the judges, has peeked at some of
them, and reports that the contest is |
mast decidedly wide open.
Emphasizing the importance of a
good, i"espectable name, the Honest
Injun is bitterly grousing around
the Daily office, occasionally hauling
off with a left-field sock at the
Curses Barnes midsection for not
giving him a good name to begin
with.
Tlie Injun f:lso thinks dark
thoughts about Ex Committee be
cause they wouldn't recognize him.
i

The Honest Injun points out
that there is no cover charge on
this reservation. There are no

strings attached. All the customer
has to do is abide by the rules that
have been printed, and submit a
good name, and a funny reason:
Such f.s, "Dogwood, because he's
a block off the old chip."
