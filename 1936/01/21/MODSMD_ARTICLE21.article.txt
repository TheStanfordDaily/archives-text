# Women Win Two Seats On Alumni Council
## Former Co-eds Assured 'Say-so' in Organization 
### 
Two of the four members elected
to the Alumni Council next month
will be women, according to Secre
tary Harlow P. Rothert, and Stan
ford alumnae are rejoicing in their
victory after their long campaign
for greater representation.
Demanded Increase
Since the increase in the ratio of
women, Stanford women graduates
have felt that they should be rep
resented by more members on the
council. And they have said that
unless their request was granted,
they would withdraw to form their
own alumnae association. At pres
ent there are only two women mem
bers on the board of 16, Mrs. Jessie
Hall Brown and Miss Miriam Kropp
of San Francisco.
And They Got It
However, Rothert, speaking for
the council, has told the women they
will be given every opportunity to
share in the direction of the Alumni
Association policies, and that their
support will be not only appreciated
but also greatly needed.
"More can be accomplished for
the University," he said, "by co
operation than by division of various
activities."
