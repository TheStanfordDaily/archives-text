# Senate Passes Bonus Measure
## Baby Bond Bill Passed Easily; To Go To House 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (/P). —A
I soldiers' bonus bill, calling for pay
ment of full 1945 maturity value in
$50 bonds, was shoved to within a
step of Ihe White House tonight as
the Senate passed it along to a re
ceptive house by a top-heavy vote
of 74 to 16.
The nearly five to one major
ity rolled up for (he Democratic-
Republican, $2,000,000,000 propos
al was easily more than enough to
pass it over a veto.
The House already has approved
| immediate payment by an even
greater majority—3s6 to 59—but
without specifying the payment
' method. Some observers predicted
, a veto, but even Democratic lead
l ers said it would be over-ridden.
Speaker Byrns said the "baby
bond" bill will be taken up in the
House Wednesday, allowing mem
bers a day's notice. Bonus lead
ers predicted House acceptance
of the Senate substitute by an
I overwhelming ballot.
