# Three Sororities' Penalty Modified
## Thetas, Alpha Phis, Pi Phis, May Pledge At End Of Quarter 
### 
Kappa Alpha Theta, Alpha Phi, and Pi Beta Phi may pledge their
classes on the last night of this quarter, March 20, the joint committee, at
the recommendation of Dean Mary Yost and with the approval of the
nine houses, decided last night.
This reduction of the penalty, formerly one year, was made because of
the too far-reaching effects on the freshmen, the houses, the alumni,

â–º University finances and housing
problem, and the scholarship both
in the houses and halls.
The three houses and Kappa Kap
pa Gamma may not rush, bid, or
have contact with freshmen women
other than that permitted for fall
quarter in the Bidding Contract,
with the exception of the Kappas'
contact with their pledges.
All contacts must be reported to
Pan-Hellenic as formerly.
Investigation was started as a re
sult of Roble rumors and not at the
instigation of any single group, ac
fording to Jeanne Keesling, Pan-
Hellenic president.
