the Kow situation last week.
This meeting and those following
in the course of investigation are to
be held solely for settling the diffi
culties and solving the problems dis
covered in the last season of rush
ing.
"What is wrong with our pre
ent rushing system? and with our
rushing rules? I** what manner
were the rules violated and why
were they violated? What ways
or means may best be used to
change the situation?" In these
words Ed Littlefield, chairman of
the Interfraternity Board, ex
presses his view of the purpose of
the investigation.
The consensus of opinion on the
Row is that a shorter rushing pe
riod and no off-campus rushing are
two of the most important questions
to be discussed.
An investigation into the rush
ing systems used in other univer
sities and the airing of the opin
ions of each house on the situation
will enable the board to reach an
enlightened decision on the best
methods of conducting rushing
here, it is believed.
