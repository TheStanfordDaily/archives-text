# U.C.L.A. Prexy Resigns Post In Controversy
## Student President And Editor Row on Politics 
### 
Disagreement between the presi
dent of the Associated Students of
U.C.L.A. and the editor of the ' Daily
Bruin" resulted in the resignation
of the student prexy last week.
Controversies over student policies
that, had flared throughout the term
were culminated by the retention of
Gilbert Harrison, editor, by the stu
dent executive council. Thomas
Lambert was the student body presi
dent.
Asserted "pink" tactics 011 the
local R.O.T.C. question supposedly
forced the break, but Lambert de
clared that in many instances Har- j
rison had withheld important news. :
Harrison said that the daily paper i
should remain the unquestioned
prerogative of the editor and should
not be "influenced by student opin- j
ion or coercion." He also pointed j
out that the student council may at |
any time remove the editor from \
office if there is a just cause.
"Harrison's policies do not repre- I
sent the best student interests,"
Lambert explained.
