# THE 						VOYAGE AND ARRIVAL
## 
### Susan Luckie 
Part of the adventure of a trip
to Tahiti is the longest non-stop
voyage in the world over a stretch t
of 3,660 miles, hi the oldest boat in
active passenger service. This vessel
has been in service for 30 years and
has over three million miles to its
credit.
The boat sails from San Fran
cisco at 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
commencing a ten-day sea journey
during which no land, except a
few choral atolls, is sighted, and
only one ship is encountered.
The steamer arrives at the island
early in the morning before the sun
is up. It stops and floats at anchor
until daybreak, outside the reef.
In the faint light of early dawn,
Tahiti looms against the skyâ€”a
towering mountain rising abruptly
out of the ocean. In the distance ap
pear the tiny lights of Papeete, the

capital city, like a thin line of stars
cast up on the beach.
At daybreak the deep blue of the
channel is clcarly distinguishable
from the green of the shallow water
and the gray coral near the surface.
The beat is guided safely through
the barrier from the open sea into
the calm waters of the harbor.
Across the bay comes the deli
cate fragrance of Tiare Tahiti, the
flower of the island, intermingled
with the more pungent odor of
copra loaded on the docks awaiting
shipment. People come from all
directions in automobiles, on
horseback, on bicycles, in wagons,
and on foot to greet the monthly
steamer.
As the boat ties up, native porters
swarm aboard and all but steal the
baggage in their efforts to get the
job of carrying it on shore. They
stand in the doors of the cabins
waiting until the trunks are packed,
and then grab them and hustle off,
leaving the owners to find their re
spective luggage as best they can in
the hopeless confusion of the cus
toms office.
