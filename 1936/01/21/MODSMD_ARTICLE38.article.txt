# Injured Men May Receive Sport Letter
## Banquet Suggested For Football Team Tribute 
### 
Awards will be granted to in
jured players, in the future, if a pro
posed by-law passes in tonight's Ex
Committee session. It provides that
any man, if deprived oi competition
by an injury and recommended in
the customary way, should receive
the sport letter.
Frank Alustiza's letter was
tabled last week for further con
sideration. The by-law, if ap
proved, will assure him of an
award although his eye injury
prevented competition for most of
the season.
Constitutional amendments of by
laws concerning the Daily and Dra
matic Council have also been drafted
and come up for discussion tonight.
Bryan Moore and Sterling Cot
trell, two-man committee to de
cide what tribute the football
team is to receive, will report.
An outstanding suggestion is a
banquet for the entire team. The
project to set aside Grayson's jer
sey seems to be abandoned. A
plaque inscribed with the team
names may also be made, to lie
kept in the new theater.
Appointments of an election board
chairman to succeed Jim Ludlam
will be completed. Ludlam super
vises the student body and Daily
elections in February, at the end of
his term of office.
Final arrangements for the
theater ceremony will be made by
the theater committee and the
Public Exercises Committee. No
date has been set as yet, says
President Wally Brooke, but it
will probably be in the latter part
of February.
All requests for dates should be
turned in immediately. Those dates
tabled last week for further consid
eration will be granted or refused
tonight.
