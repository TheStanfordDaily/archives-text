### 
With special reference to the pos
sibilities of a European world war,
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz will talk on "The
European Crisis" in the Assembly
Hall tonight at 7:30 o'clock.
"The evil from which the contem
porary world has suffered since the
winter of 1934-35 is no longer en
tirely the crisis—it is rather the in
ability of the European powers to
co-ordinate their individual efforts
to escape from the crisis," according
to Dr. Lutz who returned from Eu
rope last autumn.
Our own foreign policy appears to
be one of strict isolation, he said, but
it is being carried out without re
gard to the fundamental fact that up
to the present, the way to prevent
war has been through co-operation,
not through isolation.
