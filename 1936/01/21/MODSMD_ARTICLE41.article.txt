# Leg Injury Keeps Luisetti Out Of Hoop Practice
## Indian Star May Be Ready for Week-end Tilts With Trojans Stanford Has Chance To Reach Top In Conference by Defeating Trojans Twice 
### 
Hank Luisetti was doing all of his fancy footwork on a pair of crutches
yesterday afternoon when Coach John Bunn sent his Redskin quintet
through a defensive drill preparatory to the week-end's clashes with
U.S.C.'s basketball team.
The rangy mainstay of the Indian hoop outfit suffered a recurrence
of an old leg injury in last Friday's fracas with the Bears. A ligament just

below his ankle, which gave him'
plenty of trouble last year, appar
ently was pulled again, and this sent
Hank limping to the hospital.
Contrary to predictions made
early yesterday, however, Lui
setti probably will not be lost to
the squad when it swings into ac
tion first on Friday and again on
Saturday against the forces from
Troy. His weak ankle, according
to reports, is enough to keep him
out of practice sessions until late
in the week.
In line with Bunn's policy of early
season grooming, defense came in
for its usual amount of attention in
yesterday's drill.
A brief chalk talk preceded the
workout. The varsity then tuss
led with reserves, who were using
offense tactics imported from Troy.
For the first time in more than a
decade the Farm boys will have an
opportunity to grab the Conference
lead this week. Coach Sam Barry's
Trojan cohorts have downed the
Bears twice and then narrowly out
pointed U.C.L.A. to gather three j
victories and first honors in the !
southern league. By drubbing the '
Trojans in both contests, the Cardi- j
nals can climb to the top.
Today and tomorrow arc the j
final days fur purchasing tickets |
to the two battles this week-end,
warns the B.A.C. The ticket of- !
fice will he open from 9 to 5
o'clock, with ducats priced at 40
cents.
Standings for the southern divi
sion of the Coast Conference are as
follows:
W. L. Pet.
usc 3 0 1.000
Stanford 2 1 .666!
U.C.L.A 1 2 .333 I
