lIIS RECORD

As word comes that Ernie Nevers
| will take over head coaching duties
| at Lafayette next season, Stanford is
; moved to cast an eye at the record
! of this man whom many will al
| ways call "the greatest back in foot
! ball."
I During his three years of as
sistant-coaching at Stanford he
has convinced many more that
success has been confined not only
j to the playing field.
Not soon to be forgotten is that
i New Year's Day of 1925 when Nev
j ers led Stanford against Notre
| Dame in the Rose Bowl.
For it was in that game that Er
nie with two recently-broken
ankles, each taped so tightly that
it was impossible for him to feel
j below the calf, tore off through the
1 Irish time and again for consist- |
ent yardage gains. Notre Dame
! won by a score of 27-10, but they
went away talking about Nevers.
Ernie was always known as ter
rifically hard hitter. He ran behind
a line not quite as good as last year's
but a two or three-yard gain was
j almost cinched every time he packed
the ball. On defense he was a mur
derous lackler adept at backing up
| the line.
Since Stanford's Bobby Grayson
started making headlines many have
; tried to compare the two, pronounce
, one or (he other the better. But this
| can' hardly be done since their two j
styles of play are substantially dif- '
ferent.
Bobby has always been the
tricky runner, fast and swivel
hipped. Ernie is the driving, pow
erful type, not quite as fast but
like a locomotive to stop. Each
is the perfection of his group.
After his graduation from Stanford i
Nevers took up pro ball, organiz- j
ing, managing, and playing fullback I
on several of the East's best teams i
until his return to Stanford three I
years ago as assisiant coach.

THREE YEARS
OF SUCCESS

And these last three years have i
! been almost phenomenal. The rec
ord that Tiny, Ernie and Jim Law
| son plus the rest of the Stanford
coaching .sla/f has written into the
books is rarely paralleled.
In the three years that they have
had (he reins since Pop Warner's ,
i departure, Stanford has defeated
U.S.C. and California at every
meeting. Stanford has been se
lected for the Rose Bowl each
year. Stanford has been the stand
out on the coast.
Of course, they have had the right
material and the right spirit to work
with, but for a new coach to have a
part in that record is certainly a
mark of merit.
It s a tough job that lies ahead
for Ernie but the cards are stacked
the right w..y. Lafayette has been
consistently veak during the last
few years and Nevers is stepping
into the id' ,il situat on.
He'll be -oaching a small col- j
lege squad that meets some of the
better of (he eastern teams—
Princeton, Colgate, Syracuse —
and if he can trip them up often
enough he II l ) 0 a t the top.
Ernie, wishing you lots of '
luck. —Frost

lIIS RECORD

As word comes that Ernie Nevers
| will take over head coaching duties
| at Lafayette next season, Stanford is
; moved to cast an eye at the record
! of this man whom many will al
| ways call "the greatest back in foot
! ball."
I During his three years of as
sistant-coaching at Stanford he
has convinced many more that
success has been confined not only
j to the playing field.
Not soon to be forgotten is that
i New Year's Day of 1925 when Nev
j ers led Stanford against Notre
| Dame in the Rose Bowl.
For it was in that game that Er
nie with two recently-broken
ankles, each taped so tightly that
it was impossible for him to feel
j below the calf, tore off through the
1 Irish time and again for consist- |
ent yardage gains. Notre Dame
! won by a score of 27-10, but they
went away talking about Nevers.
Ernie was always known as ter
rifically hard hitter. He ran behind
a line not quite as good as last year's
but a two or three-yard gain was
j almost cinched every time he packed
the ball. On defense he was a mur
derous lackler adept at backing up
| the line.
Since Stanford's Bobby Grayson
started making headlines many have
; tried to compare the two, pronounce
, one or (he other the better. But this
| can' hardly be done since their two j
styles of play are substantially dif- '
ferent.
Bobby has always been the
tricky runner, fast and swivel
hipped. Ernie is the driving, pow
erful type, not quite as fast but
like a locomotive to stop. Each
is the perfection of his group.
After his graduation from Stanford i
Nevers took up pro ball, organiz- j
ing, managing, and playing fullback I
on several of the East's best teams i
until his return to Stanford three I
years ago as assisiant coach.

THREE YEARS
OF SUCCESS

And these last three years have i
! been almost phenomenal. The rec
ord that Tiny, Ernie and Jim Law
| son plus the rest of the Stanford
coaching .sla/f has written into the
books is rarely paralleled.
In the three years that they have
had (he reins since Pop Warner's ,
i departure, Stanford has defeated
U.S.C. and California at every
meeting. Stanford has been se
lected for the Rose Bowl each
year. Stanford has been the stand
