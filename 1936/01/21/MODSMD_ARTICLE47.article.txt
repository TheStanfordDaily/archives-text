## Frosh Schedule Three Games For This Week Salinas J.C., Piedmont, Stockton Highs Appear 
### 
Another big week is under way for
Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh basketball
squad Salinas Junior College will
meet the Indian babes at 7:30 o'clock
tomorrow, and Piedmont and Stock
ton High Schools will appear in pre
liminaries at 6:30 o'clock Friday and
Saturday, respectively. All three
games will be played in the Pavilion.
The jaysee team, coached by
Frank Powers, recently returned
from a southern trip on which it lost
two games and won a third against j
tough opposition. Piedmont High is I
said to have been weakened by
graduation, but its team has usu
ally given the frosh a close game. 1
Stockton High has always had
strong teams—often the class of
valley preps.
Taking it easy as they started their
second three-game week, the j
Thirty-niners stressed individual
defense and free throw shooting in
practice yesterday. The first string |
also had an offensive drill against
a three-man team of reserves. In- '
ability to sink set-ups, the main |
yearling weakness in the Marin :
game, was the object of much atten- j
tion.
