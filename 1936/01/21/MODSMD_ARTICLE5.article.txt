# Student Tells Of Nazi Schools
## No Roll Call in Hitler's Colleges, Scholar Says 
### 
Impressions and opinions of Ger- j
man student life gained during a :
year as American exchange student J
at the University of Munich, were 1
given over the Stanford Radio Hour
last night by Waldo H. Furgason.
"At a German university there
is absolutely no interest in the in
dividual," said Furgason. "After
his registration the university has
no concern as to where the stu
dent lives, or whether or not he 1
attends any of the lectures in the
courses for which he has regis
tered. He must, however, return I
to the university at the end of the |
semester—not to take examina
tions, but to 'un-register'."
The student is a privileged person
in Munich, Furgason said. His reg
istration card entitles him to re
duced rates on railroad and air lines,
and reduced prices to the opera,
symphony, art galleries, and mu
seums. The downtown beer halls
and restaurants also serve cheaper
menus to the students.
From numerous discussions,
Furgason obtained <he impression
that the majority of students sin
cerely favor the main objectives of
the Nazi program; that they do
not wish a democracy but prefer
a dictatorship or monarchy as the
best form of government for their
people.
They are interested in America ,
and bear no resentment against her j
opposition in the World War, though j
they have a deep resentment toward i
the Versailles Treaty and a faith in j
the restoration of international jus- !
tice now that the treaty has been |
broken.
