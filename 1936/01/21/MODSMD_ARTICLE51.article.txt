national champion, and a former
world record holder are among
the aces that will perform. Lead
ing the array of talent will be Don
Towne, phenomenal yearling
breast stroke star, who was ac

weeks Towne lias unofficially
eclipsed the American marks for
both 50 yards and 50 meters. He
has also threatened the world's
best time in the 100-yard event.

National crown in the 500-yard free

astic diver; and Henry Godman, var
sity sprint flash and 1934 all-Ameri
can intercollegiace selection.

holder. His prowess in the back
stroke formerly gained him the
world title at 400 meters. And

Coast 100-meter champ, will also
