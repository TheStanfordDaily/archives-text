Tonight, Interfraternity Board of Control
will pry into Stanford's rushing system in a
meeting that may be of even more significance
than last Wednesday's startling session which
legally deprived Sigma Chi of 1930 pledging
privileges.
Vet 2.'1 disinterested fraternities — who
spent lust Thursday in terror lest a complete
eruption of the illegal rushing system gener
ally practiced snatch pledge classes from them
on the eve of oflicial pledging—today appar
ently are more or less unconcerned over the
pending Board action.
Those 2.'} fraternities had reason to fear the
blow-up; it was in the nature of a concession
to them that the general explosion was de
ferred until after pledge night. Now that these
houses :ill have their classes, however, they
seemingly are too short-sighted to realize that
the problem must be hashed over and settled
before plans are begun for another season
of dirty rushing.
The houses will concede that the present
set-up is inexcusable, and that a wide-open
rushing system would be inadvisable. A
"happy medium" is the obvious alternative,
but the particular middle course that will
entail the fewest evils will be hard to find.
In the first place, for numerous reasons
pledging should he held earlier in the year.
Three and a half months of abnormal contact
between Kneina and the Row are too long;
enforcement of any rushing system for this

period is not only close to impossible but en
tirely unreasonable.
Next, there must be some regulations, since
sandbagging and railroading of pledges is in
consistent with Stanford tradition. Hence,
regular rushing periods must be maintained;
Frosh-Kow contact, though not as strained as
at present, cannot be wide open; financial
show must be equalized among the fraterni
ties, which eliminates unrestricted oll'-campus
parties.
Finally, a means of enforcement will be
essential. To prevent backbiting and defen
sive blackmailing, a four-dav clause —pro-
viding immunity if charges of illegal rushing
are not preferred within four days of the al
leged infraction —should replace the present
14-day clause. It is now too easy for a house
to say, "You can't squeal on us; we have too
much on you."
Specifically, the Board might adopt the fol
lowing changes:
Begin rushing the week after autumn regis
tration and hold regular lunch and dinner
dates 011 certain days each week from then
until pledging, which will lake place one
month after the start of the quarter.
Revamp the regulations that make for
strained Fratcrnity-Encina contact.
Provide adequate enforcement—either by
"gentlemen's agreements" or by some other
system—for whatever rules the Board deems
necessary to keep rushing on a civilized basis.
