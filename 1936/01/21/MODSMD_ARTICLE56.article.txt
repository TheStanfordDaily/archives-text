# Tradition Weakens, So Rules Asked to Step In
## 
### 
When Ex Committee meets tonight, it will
have placed before it a plea from Men's and
Women's Councils for a rule prohibiting
smoking in classrooms during examinations.
The plea from those bodies arose as the result
of numerous student requests for enforce
ment, which the Councils obviously could not
provide since the anti-smoking ban had no
enforceable qualities, being merely a tradi
tion.
It is prima facie to be deplored when tradi
tion backed by good taste weakens, and harsh
little rules have to creep in. The number of
smokers in examinations and the cries against
them have both reached proportions where
such a rule is necessary. Ii seems probable
that Ex Committee will fulfill the request.
The rule, however, should not be permitted
to become a long-standing or oft-quoted one.
The mere necessity of passing a rule against
smoking in examinations should be enough to
awaken students so that they will stop of their
own volition in order to turn such a shameful
rule into a dead letter.
Also marking a relaxing of the force of the
no-smoking tradition generally is the disgust
ing clutter of men and women who are too
lazy to move oil' the English corner steps and
adjacent Quad walk into the cold to smoke
their between-class cigarettes.

It would seem that common decency to
those attempting to move between classes
would he sufficient to discourage such thor
oughfare - blockers and classroom - smokers
even without the no-smoking tradition. But
it isn't.
