WHY SO FEW SORORITIES?
Considering the fact that there are some 1,100
women enrolled in this university . . . and that only
256 of them claim berths on the Row ... a conclusion
seems logical that a shortage of sororities exists . . .
but because logic ends where women begin . . . such
is not the case.

If one thinks the plight of Stanford feminity is not
pitiful, he need only pause and imagine what tears
of sadness, what sobs of disappointment were shed and
uttered in Roble last week because of bids that never
came in. That's not v piece of imagination written
for effect. The remorse that comes when bids don't
creates a hundred bitter Ophelias in Roble each winter,
and we all know it.

Why aren't there mere sororities? Why aren't there
enough bids to go around? Why can't the proportion of
Row and Hall women be correlated to reasonable pro
portions? The answer, though some will deny it, lies
in that hot-bed of unreason known as women's fickle
nature. Most frosh-women seem to want to join one
of the big four in the sorority group. And many who
can't get into one of those houses won't join anything.
Absurd? It's women's nature.

If a house is not ranking high at the moment, women
don't want to join it. If it does rank high, they do.
That's why you can ask an old timer what the best and
worst sororities were seven years ago and his answer
will hold good today or seven years hence. And that's
why more sororities don't come in. They often con
sider it, but after looking around, they decide against it.
Stanford is freak.
Even if the obstacles set up by the women them
selves would be battered down, more sororities would
hardly be economically justified. If a new group came
in and built a new house, paying for the structure
would be a burden unattractive to prospective mem
bers. If one came in end rented an old house, it could
probably never get a foothold. What certain of the
more far-sighted members of the administration hope
for is the real answer.

If and when the university is flush, it may build
a sorority house combine; that is, a single building that
will house several Greek letter groups on a scale as
elaborate or more so than Lagunita Court. Each would
have its own wing, chapter room, and dining room,
but the economies of a single kitchen and heating plant
would be included. Toyon originally was designed
as such a project for men. If a plan like this were ever
effected, it would bring new houses on the campus
and take established houses out of the antiques they
are now in.
But as long as fushmen women will pledge the
"best" and nothing but the "best," the sorority system
of Stanford will suffer, and many will continue to
doubt its justification. â€”John McClelland
