# Our Hasher Sez:

Our Hasher has always wanted to know how the
other half lived, the other half being the filthy pluto
crats who get waited on (more or less) when they eat,
who drive big cars, and who travel in the "fast set."
Now he knows.
There is a senior in the Phi Delt iiouse whose father
is president of a big bank in Los Angeles. As all bank
presidents' sons do at one time or another, he decided
that it was time he was stepping out and seeing the
world.
So he phoned up an heiress to some Middle West
millions and contracted for a date to go dinner
dancing.
The big night arrived. First they had their dinner
at the What Lug Tavern. Then they went to the May
field flickers, finally winding up at a tony highway
eating establishment.
But something marred the otherwise perfect eve
ning.
"Gersh! what service," complained the plutocrat,
"and oy tipped 'im a dime, too."
The Phi Delts think this is all very funny.
It is very comforting to realize that there is one
house up the Row that is standing out against dirty
rushing, willing to sacrifice all, even the Sigma Chis,
in order that humanity may march on under improved
rushing rules.
It is also very comforting to realize that they aren't
as bad as they sound. Last Friday morning, just one
short day after this house had sacrificed all, a certain
partisan to their house came down from Menlo Jaysee
to Encina Hall. Now this Menlo lad happened to be
the good friend of a member of the frosh tennis team,
whom the public spirited house was trying to induct
into the sacred bond of pure fraternal friendship.
However, another house further up the Row seemed to
have the inside track.
The Menloite called on his old buddy and took him
to one of the favorite highway watering places. One
thing led to another. When the time came to pay a
call on the fraternity lawyer, the freshman had one
sheet to the wind, and he was preparing to haul that
one down.
But before the freshman could reach the fraternity
lawyer, a vigilante committee composed of freshmen
with tendencies toward the house further up the Row
was organized. They appealed to his better nature.
They pointed to greater warmth of fraternity ties, and
so forth. The gentleman finally appeared before the
lawyer and manager to convey his desire to join a
house and proceeded cut of the room under his own
power, but rather unresponsive to the tiller. His
Menlo pal rushed up to him, "Did you join, old pal?"
"Yes, I did, old pal,'' the freshman answered, "but
not your house."
Onward, Christian Soldiers.

partisan to their house came down from Menlo Jaysee
to Encina Hall. Now this Menlo lad happened to be
the good friend of a member of the frosh tennis team,
whom the public spirited house was trying to induct
into the sacred bond of pure fraternal friendship.
However, another house further up the Row seemed to
have the inside track.
The Menloite called on his old buddy and took him
to one of the favorite highway watering places. One
thing led to another. When the time came to pay a
call on the fraternity lawyer, the freshman had one
sheet to the wind, and he was preparing to haul that
one down.
But before the freshman could reach the fraternity
lawyer, a vigilante committee composed of freshmen
with tendencies toward the house further up the Row
was organized. They appealed to his better nature.
They pointed to greater warmth of fraternity ties, and
so forth. The gentleman finally appeared before the
lawyer and manager to convey his desire to join a
house and proceeded cut of the room under his own
power, but rather unresponsive to the tiller. His
Menlo pal rushed up to him, "Did you join, old pal?"
"Yes, I did, old pal,'' the freshman answered, "but
not your house."
Onward, Christian Soldiers.
Our Hasher has always wanted to know how the
other half lived, the other half being the filthy pluto
crats who get waited on (more or less) when they eat,
who drive big cars, and who travel in the "fast set."
Now he knows.
There is a senior in the Phi Delt iiouse whose father
is president of a big bank in Los Angeles. As all bank
presidents' sons do at one time or another, he decided
that it was time he was stepping out and seeing the
world.
So he phoned up an heiress to some Middle West
millions and contracted for a date to go dinner
dancing.
The big night arrived. First they had their dinner
at the What Lug Tavern. Then they went to the May
field flickers, finally winding up at a tony highway
eating establishment.
But something marred the otherwise perfect eve
ning.
"Gersh! what service," complained the plutocrat,
"and oy tipped 'im a dime, too."
The Phi Delts think this is all very funny.
It is very comforting to realize that there is one
house up the Row that is standing out against dirty
rushing, willing to sacrifice all, even the Sigma Chis,
in order that humanity may march on under improved
rushing rules.
It is also very comforting to realize that they aren't
as bad as they sound. Last Friday morning, just one
short day after this house had sacrificed all, a certain
partisan to their house came down from Menlo Jaysee
to Encina Hall. Now this Menlo lad happened to be
the good friend of a member of the frosh tennis team,
whom the public spirited house was trying to induct
into the sacred bond of pure fraternal friendship.
