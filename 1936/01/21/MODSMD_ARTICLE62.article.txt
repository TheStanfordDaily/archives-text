# HOW IT WAS DONE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As president of the local chapter
I of the American Student Union, I
would like to thank Mr. Powell for
his constructive criticisms of the
first attempts of our paper. Each
suggestion cai*ries real value. We
do hope as we gain in experience to
| do the very thing he suggestsâ€”act
! as an intelligent minority capable of
j discussing with thought those prob
i lems which are of particular con
j cern to youth today.
The first issue of the paper was a
j co-operative affair. Several members
j worked out the articles together;
consequently, since it was a group
j responsibility, we assigned no defi
-1 nite editorial board. However, from
j now on we will have the editorial
I board included on the masthead. It
will not be permanent but will
change with the contributox's to each
issue.
j We are particularly desirous for
j comments, as we do wish to be re
j sponsive to student opinion. We
I that all letters be sent to Box 626.
