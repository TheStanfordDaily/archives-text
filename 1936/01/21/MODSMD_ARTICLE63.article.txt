The Editor, Sir:
(Maybe you had better run this
ad.)
Lost: Seven frosh—last seen on
the tail of the Zete pledge list. Find
er will please return to Phi Sig
house, 564 Mayfield—reward.
Yes, sir, Mr. Editor, life is a husk.
After having slaved for months to
gather 13 frosh, we find to our cha
grin that seven have been inadver
tently donated to the Zetes. We hope
that the Zetes have plenty of their
; own. At any rate we wonder if you
would mind sneaking over and snak
ing them back again.
Unhappy Phi Sig
We slipped a!i right. Our apol
ogies to Messcrs Pine. Scliaw,
SchofT, Sheriffs, Stepp, Wall, Wil
liams, and the Phi Sigma Kappa
house.—Ed.
