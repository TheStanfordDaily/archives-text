The Editor, Sir:
In a similar case down home,
where an honor code is decidedly
not in effect, a polite note was left
cn the scat of my car. But yester
day, Monday, when somebody neat

ly bent the tar out of the left front
fender of my gray Model A and
completely annihilated the paint
thereon, while it was parked by the
library, I could find no note of apol
ogy-
Our honor code doesn't mean so
much to me here as meeting the
probably pleasant personality who
dented my fender. Will you please
leave a card under the door of 245
Branner or in P.O. Box 2253?
Phil Klauber
