"CRIME ET CHATIMENT"
At the Clay-International, S.F.
If you're a film fiend but seek
something more weighty than Dick
Powell or Joan Bennett, try "Crime
et Chatinrmt," French filmization of
Dostoevsky'j "Crime and Punish
ment."
The French seem to have caught
the spirit of Dostoevsky's work
more faithfully than did Josef von
Sternberg in his current American
production. Pierre Blanchar plays
the Russian student as Dostoevsky
intended. Peter Loire, in Colum
bia's version, plays the student as
Peter Lorre sees him.
At any rate, "Crime et Chati
ment's" worth lies not in actual
dialogue, because most of us can
catch only a word or two of the
French. The mood of the actors, the
direction, and the entire atmosphere
portray grippingly the struggle be
tween the student-murderer and his
conscience, which is, really, his pun
ishment.
Even though you've had six years
of French, the English titles will
help. We'd rate it a Parisian "A."
