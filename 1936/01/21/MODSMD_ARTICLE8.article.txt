While an empire mourned the
death of King George V, Stanford
professors last night analyzed the
significance of the loss to British
people.
Professor Carl F. Brand of the his
tory department said: "Although
the death of a king today does not
mean what it would have several
hundred years ago, this is no indica
tion that the king does not fill a very
large place in ihe affection of the
English people. He was the living
symbol of English nationalism and
of today's link with the past."
"Honest Man"
"King George V was an honest
man of moderate ability striving
hard to perform a difficult task,"
Professor Brand added.
Professor Buck of the political
science department explained the
deep affection of British subjects
for their king thus: "He repre
sented a great many ideas of con
temporary England. His stability
of temperament and personal
touch through trying circum
stances endeared him to his sub
jects regardless of their political
beliefs."
Both professors agreed that if the
Prince of Wales succeeds to the
throne he will become the same sort
of ruler that his father was, pos
sessing, perhaps, additional personal
charm. He is, like his father, a man
short of stature, calm, and extraor
dinarily popular with all whom he
meets.
