# Rule Forces Ban on Tilts With Staters
## 
### 
Contrary to wide publicity in a
San Francisco newspaper this
morning, the Pacific Coast Con
ference ban on athletic competi
tion with San Jose State College
is not a drastic move and was not
instituted by Stanford.
The Indians were scheduled to
meet the Spartans in baseball
Saturday, and in boxing Janu
ary 31. These dates have been
cancelled by the conference be
cause of San Jose's policy of giv
ing room and board to athletes.
No member of the circuit may
compete with the Teachers in any
sport until the latter either join
an approved league of their own
or abide by conference rules.
This action was taken at the
conference meeting December 10
in San Francisco, but was not
made public until yesterday, when
the approaching diamond and fistic
dates made an official announce
ment necessary. Stanford's act
was not a cancellation, but merely
support of the conference rule.
San Jose State was considered
at one time as a possible op
ponent for the Cardinal football
team on October 17, only open
date of the season. That date
will probably remain open, it was
learned last night.
