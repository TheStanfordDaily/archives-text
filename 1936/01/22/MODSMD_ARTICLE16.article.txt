# Bear—Once Golden, Then Red—Annoys Redwood Cityites

A golden bear turned dirty
maroon found disfavor with Red
wood City citizens yesterday.
Until Big Game week last fall,
the gleaming bear advertised a
camera company's wares on El
Camino Real. Then Stanford
pranks, in the dead of night,
painted the animal a cardinal
red.
Time passed, and the bear stayed
red. Until winter came and the
bear faded. Now Redwood City
ites, annoyed and sensitive, won't
renew the camera company's
sign license.
