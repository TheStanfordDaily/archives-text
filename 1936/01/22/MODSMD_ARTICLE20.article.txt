# Austria Key To European Peace: Lutz
## Germany, Italy Blamed For Present Crisis By Head of War Library 
### 
"Austria is the critical spot in
Europe today, and it is there the
worst crisis may break out at any
moment," declared Dr. Ralph Has
well Lutz, professor of history, in
his lecture on "The European Crisis"
in the Assembly Hall last night.
Stressing the value of co-opera
tion among the great powers, Dr.
Lutz said that the League will be
either little more than a name next
October, or it will dissolve into a
general European War as an out
come of the present Italian crisis.
Until the Stresa Conference of
last January, at which Mussolini
scored a victory, Europe was dom
inated by uncertainty about Ger
many. Since then, the Italo-Elhio
pian conflict has held the stage, and
the meeting of the League this week
will decide the strength of the
sanctions. As the war materials are
controlled by the sanctions coun
tries, it is hoped that they will be
able to strangle Italy before (he next
rainy season in Ethiopia, the pro
fessor said.
England has definitely committed
herself in the Italian crisis, by the
concentration of British ships, air
forces, and troops in the Mediter
ranean area which began before last
March, according to Dr. Lutz, who
visited that area at the time.
"Obviously Germany and Italy
have precipitated this present crisis,"
explained the speaker, "while Eng
land has made it a test case for
collective security." However, the
whole European situation can be
traced to the Treaty of Versailles, to
the collapse of the Disarmament
Conference, and to the emergence
of Germany as a world power, he
said.
