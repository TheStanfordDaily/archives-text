Since a number of undergraduates
on NYA did not apply for relief
cards before the deadline yesterday,
there are several vacancies, which
will be filled by those on the wait
ing list. Students on this list should
apply at the office of Mrs. Irene
Spenner Coverley, manager.
Mrs. Coverley also announces
that three jobs are open to students:
a woman expert at tap dancing to
give private lessons, a man experi
enced with a trumpet to instruct,
and a male artist's model of the ath
letic type.
