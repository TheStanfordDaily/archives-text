Possible reorganization of Ex
Committee, which will be put up to
a student body vote if a student,
panel discussion favors the move,
was cutiined in last night's meeting.
A motion that the present system
of representatives be changed was
introduced by Dick Creamer. "Ex
Committees of the past have com
bined ability with power only
through coincidence," he accused.
His outline for student govern
ment provided that seven repre
sentatives he elected by campus
activity groups, and that the
president and vice-president be
chosen by the campus at large.
With only seven qualified voters
present, the executive body tabled
three other measures. The topic of
Ex Committee revision will be
urned over to a student panel in
order to probe campus opinion on
the move.
Second tabled measure was the
by-law recommending that in
jured players be granted letters.
Three men this year, besides
Frank Alustiza, were named for
exceptional work.
Under present rules, only three
men besides the regular list can be (
granted letters. The amendment
would allow each man deprived of
competition by injury, if he would
have received an award otherwise,
to win the letter. Alustiza, out for
most of the season with an eye in
jury, will receive his sports award
if the by-law passes.
Dramatic Council's request for
a closcd date March 5, a Thurs
day evening, was tabled. The
council wants to give two per
formances of the play, "Paths of
Glory," and thinks that the word
of-mouth publicity after one suc
cessful showing would make a
profitable venture financially.
"It's unconstitutional," said Bob
Gros. "No dramatic functions can
be given on week nights."
"Amend the constitution," rec
ommended Phil Bernheim.
"You can't pass a by-law tonight"
sighed Jack Hansen.
With the return of Helen Grover,
Hank Luisetti, and Bobby Grayson,
a quorum may pass the by-laws.
No smoking on quad, a joint rec
ommendation by Men's and Women's
Councils, was also postponed for a
vote next week. The groups asked
Ex Committee to formulate a defi
nite ruling on the matter. Reasons:
that it bothers both smokers and
non-smokers, since innumerable
complaints have been received from
both; that the low fire insurance
rate of Stanford depends upon no
smoking on quad; and that Mrs.
Stanford stipulated that clause in
her bequest.
