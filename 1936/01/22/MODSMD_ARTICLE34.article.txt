# Angell Field Set for Early Use If Dry
## Athletes Will Test New Oval when Clear Skies, Final Touches Permit 
### 
Angell Field, Stanford's rebuilt |
track, will be ready for use within i
two weeks, announced Coach Bill j
Ellington yesterday. If the current |
spring weather continues, varsity
and frosh teams will pound its cin
ders, scatter its sawdust, and dent its
turf with various weights, probably
before January rolls out.
Only two or t]jree days of actual j
work remains on the entire layout, |
but Ellington and Construction |
Chief Sam McDonald are watching j
the skies while cindermen continue i
to use the Stadium. If ihey again |
turn gray, a wet track at Angell J
Field will remain free of spikes for
an indefinite period.
Needs Bulling
That smooth new oval needs only
a rolling before it is dented by
spikes, weather permitting. Most of
the labor- yet to be done will be on
jump standards and pits. Concrete \
bases will be built for the high jump j
and pole vault uprights. Runways j
need only settle.
Six or eight inches of redwood |
bark will form the base of the j
broad jump pit. Over this will be a j
canvas covering, and on top of that
the shavings. This original idea of :
McDonald's will provide an air- '
mattress landing for Indian 24-foot '
fliers (if any).
Set-up Same
Pending completion of the new j
shot-putting circle on the inside of
the oval's west turn, a temporary j
circle is being finished between the
back stretch and the road by the
tennis courts.
The new javelin arena is also out- ]
side the track; so runners will no
longer have to dodge flying spears.
They will now light at various points
on a 260-foot stretch between the
temporary shot-put circle and the j
discus field. Not even the Finns j
could throw a javelin clear out of i
the new enclosure.
The discus set-up will be prac- j
ticallv the same its it has been, with j
the platters landing between Angell!
Field and the Stadium (not too j
wide an area for a Stanford weight j
man).

spring weather continues, varsity
and frosh teams will pound its cin
ders, scatter its sawdust, and dent its
turf with various weights, probably
before January rolls out.
Only two or t]jree days of actual j
work remains on the entire layout, |
but Ellington and Construction |
Chief Sam McDonald are watching j
the skies while cindermen continue i
to use the Stadium. If ihey again |
turn gray, a wet track at Angell J
Field will remain free of spikes for
an indefinite period.
Needs Bulling
That smooth new oval needs only
a rolling before it is dented by
spikes, weather permitting. Most of
the labor- yet to be done will be on
jump standards and pits. Concrete \
bases will be built for the high jump j
and pole vault uprights. Runways j
need only settle.
Six or eight inches of redwood |
bark will form the base of the j
broad jump pit. Over this will be a j
canvas covering, and on top of that
the shavings. This original idea of :
McDonald's will provide an air- '
mattress landing for Indian 24-foot '
fliers (if any).
Set-up Same
Pending completion of the new j
shot-putting circle on the inside of
the oval's west turn, a temporary j
circle is being finished between the
back stretch and the road by the
tennis courts.
The new javelin arena is also out- ]
side the track; so runners will no
longer have to dodge flying spears.
They will now light at various points
on a 260-foot stretch between the
temporary shot-put circle and the j
discus field. Not even the Finns j
could throw a javelin clear out of i
the new enclosure.
The discus set-up will be prac- j
ticallv the same its it has been, with j
the platters landing between Angell!
Field and the Stadium (not too j
wide an area for a Stanford weight j
man).
