The Editor, Sir:
For seme time the feud between |
the sexes at this institution has been \
1 aging. For a long time the situa
tion looked hopeless, but one day I !
fell down a man-hole and came up !
two hours later with a paper on
which the solution was written in '
blood.
It. was this: Since Stanford men
have always felt that Mills girls
were superior to the local product,
and the latter have always felt the ;
Cal male was head and shoulders i
above the Rough, and since this is
Leap Year, why don't Stanford
women ask Cal men to local campus
dances, and the roughs can drag the j
S.Y.T.'s from Mills.
Result: Doubled attendance at
these functions, and the great sums
of money incoming could be used to
pay for construction of the 299 the
aters which present plans call for
on the campus.
