# Typical Rough's Day Has Six Leisure Hours, Survey Shows

### Dave Botsford 
What happens to your leisure time
every week?
Like the average American un
dergraduate, you've probably never
thought much aboi:t it. Well, Wis
consin University looked into this
problem of college leisure recently.
Seven hundred men students of
every class and condition told how
they spent their time outside the
classroom.
Maybe it's amazing and maybe
it's not, hut a quick check-up of
the average Stanford rough's lei
sure pursuits tallies almost ex
actly with those of John Frederick
Jones, average Wisconsin under
graduate.
John Frederick's leisure time
amounts to something like 42 hours
a week, 6 hours a day. No matter
how much of a burden he claims his
studies are, he manages to spend as
much time raising extra-curricular
devil as he does studying and at
tending classes.
"Bull sessions,'' loafing, radio
listening, and car-driving take up
most of John Frederick's six hours a
day. Wisconsin considers car-driv
ing the most aimiess of the 29 forms

I of leisure-time amusements which ,
characterize college life.
There is almost an hour of
John's day in which no enter
prise, either physical or mental,
can be discerned, and he frankly
admits it. He sits on the porch !
with his room-mate, catches up a
little on sleep, or wanders about
the house exchanging the news of
the day.
Usually at midevening, an old- j
fashioned "bull session" gets under
way. Any number of subjects fol
low each other through the aimless
| trend of conversation—assignments, '
| instructors, dates, scandals, sports,
"life," and perhaps even current so
! cial and economic problems. Rarely
is there a session that does not J
touch on at least the periphery of j
sex interests.
Card-playing takes up little more j
than two hours of John's leisure
week, but others in his house play
four or five. At Wisconsin —Stan- 1
| ford, too—ping-pong is a declining '
! fad, and billiards, bowling, chess, !
j and checkers interest only a few.
He likes to do what other stu- j
dents do, but if he can't do it well,
he won't do it at all. As an avcr-

i age student, John doesn't enter
into any intramural or intercol
legiate sport, despite the intensive
"athletics for all" drives.
In the matter of sports, students
are still in the spectator class. But
; when competitive skill isn't in
volved as with informal outdoor
! exercise, John takes part.
Two much more passive, and often
l less purposive amusements, how- j
j ever, lake up more of the 42 hours
than do sports. Reading and movies,
j John's reading is light and usually
; includes Ihe popular weekly fiction
! magazines—6 hours a week for that.
Five movies a month are his
average. The week-end movie is a
fixed campus more—he goes no >
matter what the show. If there's
a special picture on during the
week, he'll go to that, too.
Lectures, highest ranking plainly
cultural activity, ranks 15th in rank
j of popular interests.
' Extracurricular activities are nei
ther extensive nor intensive enough
! to amount to much. You'll notice
that the student body and publica
j tion affairs of the college interest
only a small percentage of its stu
i dents.
