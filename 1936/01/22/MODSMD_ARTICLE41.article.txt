## New Ruler Turns Back Clock; Flies to London 
### 
LONDON. Jan. 21 (/P).— England
saw her new monarch break prece
dent today and wondered if Edward
VIII, modern and strong-willed to
the core, will write a fresh chapter
in the private lives of kings.
All agreed he had made a good
start toward upsetting tradition
on the first day of his rule by
linking his restless energy and
highly modern ideas to the au
thority of the throne.
By tonight, in the few hours he
had been sovereign of Great Brit
ain and Ireland, India and the do
minions beyond the seas, the 41-
year-old Edward had demonstrated
he intends to be king in his own
fashion.
One of his first acts was to have
the clocks of Sandringham House
set hack. They had been a half
hour fast down through all the
years since Edward VII, piqued at
missing an appointment, decided
that was the way to keep from
being late again.
Then the new ruler stepped into
an airplane and soared to ancient
London, to become the first British
king to travel through the skies.
