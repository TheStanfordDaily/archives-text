# Quad Editors Scream, Plea For Proofs
## 
### 
The Quad last night was "in a
spot," and still is.
Two hundred students, mostly
seniors, had their pictures taken
last quarter but haven't yet called
for their proofs. Four hundred
others have taken out proofs and
still have them. And yesterday the
photographer began clammering
for the proofs.
"So," screamed perspiring Don
Hanson, editor, "you guys just

gotta those proofs in litis j
week."
