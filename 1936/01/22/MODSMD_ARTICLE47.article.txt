# Luisetti Off Crutches, May Hoop 'Em Tonight
## Ace's Hurt Responds To Treatment; Moore Also Not Up To Par Bunn Orders Captain To Rest for Coming Tilts with U.S.C. Trojans 
### 
His ailing ankle having responded
rapidly to treatment, Hunk Luisetti
will probably, although not defi
nitely, report foi a light shooting
drill this; afternoon when Coaeh
John Bunn gathers his charges in
the Pavilion.
Lanky Hank has abandoned his
crutches, but he's still under ob
servation at the hospital where he
.spends his' evenings. That the ace
forward will be at his regular post
against U.S.C. this week-end is
little doubted, however. Coach
Bunn himself regards Luisetti's
nightly trips to the infirmary as no
more than a precautionary measure.
(Â«uard Job Open
Captain Dirity Moore, along with
Luisetti, is taking things easy this
week. Suffering from the effects of
a prolonged cold, Dinty was a bit off
form in last week's tussle with the;
Bears. He will remain off the prac
tice court this week but, according
to present indications, he'll start
against the Trojans Friday evening.
Who will hold down the other
guard berth is still pretty much a
matter for conjecture, as Sparky
Robertson, Jack Calderwood, and
Bob Zonne have all made bids for
the position. An individual race for
honors will be staged Friday and
Saturday nights when Luisetti, who
now is top scorer in the Coast Con
ference, tangles with Troy's Captain
Jack Hupp, ri/ner-i'p on the scor
ing ladder.
Hank Leads
A 22-point gain in the California
contest boosted Hank's total rating
to 49 Hupp, on the other hand, gar
nered 13 tallies when he led his
team-mates to victory over the
Bruins last week and is currently
credited with 43 points.
