WHAT'S WHAT
IN HUOBY
As Stanford's rugged ruggers
climb back into the .spotlight for
another .season of scrums, et al, the
usual situation unfolds—onlookers
are baffled and piayers are griped
'cause no one saveys what they are
doing.
To make matters worse The
Daily usually crashes through
with a couple of pretty sour yarns
about the game and all in all it
points to the fact that we'd better
find out just what's what.
Now way back when—there was
a Daily sage who knew rugby. That
was because he played the game.
Spud Hamilton, now sports writer
of the Paly Times, was that rugger
writer (doubt if there have been
any since him.) Spud wrote a series
of explanatory articles on the «n<-
cicnt game for the elucidation of
the neophyte and we reprint them
in part.
BY WAY OF
INTRODUCTION
Rugby football is one of the older
of our athletic games, being onlya
few centuries behind the ancient
Olympic sports in matter of age, and
.slightly before bean shooting at bald
heads. I( was popular in merrie
England and probably picked ujj
considerable prestige at Oxford and
Cambridge, where it shared athletic
honors with crew and tippling.
It was spread about the civi
lized and barbaric parts of the
world by His Majesty's navy and
military, so that nowadays it turns
up at such places as the Malay
States. New Zealand, the Argen
tine. and Stanford. It is extremely
popular in Japan, where crowds of
75.000 or so are no novelty.
Casting about for a method by

which to treat the subject, it strikes '
me that we ought to take up (a) !
scoring, (b) the players, forwards
and backs, (c) the scrum and the
lineout, (d) general tactics, (e) ref
ereeing, if we get around to it, (f)
anything else that may turn up dui - !
ing the melee.
So tomorrow we'll swipe parts of
Spud's comments on scoring, play- \
ers, and the scrum. —Frost \

WHAT'S WHAT
IN HUOBY
As Stanford's rugged ruggers
climb back into the .spotlight for
another .season of scrums, et al, the
usual situation unfolds—onlookers
are baffled and piayers are griped
'cause no one saveys what they are
doing.
To make matters worse The
Daily usually crashes through
with a couple of pretty sour yarns
about the game and all in all it
points to the fact that we'd better
find out just what's what.
Now way back when—there was
a Daily sage who knew rugby. That
was because he played the game.
Spud Hamilton, now sports writer
of the Paly Times, was that rugger
writer (doubt if there have been
any since him.) Spud wrote a series
of explanatory articles on the «n<-
cicnt game for the elucidation of
the neophyte and we reprint them
in part.
BY WAY OF
INTRODUCTION
Rugby football is one of the older
of our athletic games, being onlya
few centuries behind the ancient
Olympic sports in matter of age, and
.slightly before bean shooting at bald
heads. I( was popular in merrie
England and probably picked ujj
considerable prestige at Oxford and
Cambridge, where it shared athletic
honors with crew and tippling.
It was spread about the civi
lized and barbaric parts of the
world by His Majesty's navy and
military, so that nowadays it turns
up at such places as the Malay
States. New Zealand, the Argen
tine. and Stanford. It is extremely
popular in Japan, where crowds of
75.000 or so are no novelty.
