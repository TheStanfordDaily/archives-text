# Babe Quintet Meets Salinas Five Tonight
## Frosh Favorites Over Jaysees; Tilt Set For 7:30 in Pavilion Here 
### Roger Kimball 
Seeking their sixth straight home
victory, Indian frosh hoopsters will
take the Pavilion floor against Sa
linas Junior College at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. As no varsity game is
scheduled, the yearlings and their
opposition will again have the court
all to themselves.
Jimmy Bradshaw drilled his
men on jump-ball plays yester
day, and also staged a scrimmage
between the first and second
teams. The yearlings looked only
so-so in practice; they never have
been impressive in midweek ses
sions, but they're still unbeaten on
their borne floor. Menio and Marin
jaysees, and Galileo, Palo Alto,
and Berkeley High Schools have
been defeated in turn.
Salinas should extend the frosh a
little more competition than the first
five victims. The valley cowboys
have to their credit a 40-20 win over
Santa Maria, champion of its jay
see circuit. Other games played on

a recent trip resulted in a one-point
loss to California Poly and a three
point sot-back at the hands of Moran
J.C.
The visitors will line up with
two small hut clever and sharp
shooting men—Bill Lee and Russ
Jordan—at forwards. Bob Beach,
former San Jose State eager, is
the center. At guards are Camp
hell and Skadan, fairly capable
players. Two Winters brothers
substitute often at center and
guard.
Under the tutelage of Frank
Powers, the rodeo city boys favor a
slow break and a zone defense.
Sometimes they send two men down
under the basket, leaving three in
back court. Most of them have been
playing together or against each
other for years, starting with high
school days.
The frosh will open with their
usual line-up of Jack Kessell and
"Lymie" Cklkins, forwards; Phil
Zonne, center; and' Pete McArthur
and Dick Neeley, guards.
