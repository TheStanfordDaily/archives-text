# Court Order Questioned By Roosevelt
## Refusal To Rehear Tax Case Reversal of Early Decision; Replace AAA 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (/P). â€”
Shortly after agreeing on a new
two-year program to replace AAA,
President Roosevelt termed the Su
preme Court's refusal of a rehearing
in the processing tax case an ap
parent reversal of an earlier leading
case in constitutional law.
The President said he discussed
with administration leaders this
afternoon the implications of the
Court's action and their effect on
a federal law which states that
no injunction shall be issued to
restrain the collection of any tax.
In deciding the Louisiana rice
miller's case, a week ago, the Su
preme Court had ruled that an in
junction to stop collection of proc
essing taxes was justified because
the levy was an illegal "exaction"
and not a true tax.
The Court implied that the un
constitutionality of the law made
the "exaction" not a tax.
The President referred to the
earlier case of Bailey vs. George,
in which he said the Court held
that, although child labor taxes
were unconstitutional, an injunc
tion to stop their collection was
barred by the federal law.
Roosevelt offered no final conclu
sion on the Supreme Court decision
except to say in response to ques
tions by reporters at his press con
ference that the ruling apparently
reverses the stand taken by the Su
preme Court in upholding the right
to levy taxes without restraint
under the act of 1867.
