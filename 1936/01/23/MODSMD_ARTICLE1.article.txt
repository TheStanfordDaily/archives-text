# Edward Talks With Stanley Baldwin As New Rule Begins
## Body of Dead Ruler Will Lie in State Until Burial Tuesday at Windsor Castle 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 22 (/P).—Edward |
VIII was proclaimed king today and
began the 39th rule of the British
people since the Norman conquest.
From his lonely throne, the 41-
year-old bachelor, with a new
solemnity because of his respon
sibilities, plunged into the affairs
of state. He conferred with Prime
Minister Stanley Baldwin and
then sadly returned to Sandring
ham.
There his dead father, George V,
attended by simple country folk,
rests in the little parish church.
Tomorrow his body will be brought
to London by special train, arriving
at 2:45 p.m.
Burial Tuesday
It will lie in state in Westminster
Hall until Monday night. Burial
with a great state funeral cere
monial will take place Tuesday at
Windsor.
From the balcony of St. James'
palace, at Charing Cross, again at
the Temple Bar, and finally at the
Royal Exchange, in the heart of the
city of London, the new king was
publicly proclaimed.
Ten thousand troops lined the
streets while picturesque trum
peters sounded-a fanfare and a
41-gun salute boomed in the honor
of the man who symbolizes em
pire unity.
And the words of the ancient
proclamation were carried through
out the mighty empire, embracing
every continent, by wireless — a
modern touch to the picturesque
medieval proceedings. Many of Ed
ward's 500,000,000 subjects heard
them.
Family Arrives
The bereaved royal family circle,
except for the grandchildren, Prin
cesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose,
was compleled at Sandringham to
night with the arrival of the newly
proclaimed monarch and other
members of the family.
Tomorrow Edward VIII, accom
panied by his three brothers, will
walk behind a gun-carriage bearing
his father to Wolferton Station, near
Sandringham. From there the fun
eral train will steam out at noon.
The coffin will rest in a coach
painted in black and purple. The
train will be pulled by the "King
George V," an express engine
which was displayed in the United
States some years ago.
Arrangements have been made
for a million members of the public
to pass the catafalque during the ly
ing in state in Westminster Hall.
