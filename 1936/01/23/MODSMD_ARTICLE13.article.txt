## 
### Barbara Sweet 
Wantz upon a lime, there was a f
Little Indian who could Speik In
rlis but had Nutting for a name.
"Shucks!" Said the indian, "Alder
other indians have John Hancock-s.
I Gorter get a-Holte of one, too."
So the Small Reid-skin deClare-d
he was Going to Luke for a name.
He Said good-bye Hiss father, 1
Standish-Bull. put. on his Brown
rigg, fixed his Tye, and took the
Ferry West {.cross the Lake. When
the Shipp touched Shoor, he jumped
on the Sands with a Lerch and
Head-ed for the Wilde Forest of
"Bawlout Li'nd," where there are
Said to be Moore names than Mann
knows Watts to do with.
The Little indian had not gone
many Miles, when he smelled Snoke.
"Where there's Snoke, there's some
thing Fleming," disClose-d the
Little injun, "It Wood be Wbe to
Hyde, for it Musto been a Savage
who lit that fire to Cooke a Lamb I

Orr Hare." And the Poor indian !
hid in a Coffin beside some Toombs J
and Graves Fuller corpses.
The Savage, however, turned out
to be a Farmer with a Peek of Fish
for which hp Hope-d to get a Pirdy
Price to Ransom his Olm.stead from
the Laird of the Mainland. When
the injun Per.ke-d from beHind the
Dore of Hiss Coffin and saw the
Foote of the Mann he was Null
onger afraid, but Prcss-ed forward
Swift-ly.
"I Bain Ahlswede," deClare-d the
injun cautiously and he deCline-d
to disClose his name. "Watts was!
the sTcnch I smelled not Lf.nge
since?"
"Ida know," Said the Farmer,!
"Butts I Ames to find out. I think
the Forest Burns."
So the indian and the Silliman
did not Write any longer, but
Cross-ed the Brooke and set out |
along the Primrose path through j

! Fields of Lillj-s and Rose-s to find
! the Fleming Wood.
Tlie Farmer, however, was a Vi
bert. and did not have a Goodheart
at all. When the indian failed to
Treadwell and Tripp-cd, he Heald,
him up with a Gunn. "You Muni
Orr your life!" cried the under-
Coover Mann. The Little indian Felt
Hiss Hare stand on end, and Kohler
Leff his face.
"Arpke!" ho gulped, "Zipf, in fact.
I Haven any Goldner Rouble's nor
Diamond-s. I Haven even a name."
Whereupon he Capers off into the
! Bush, with the Kerr Chase-ing and
j Chargin after him. Butts the
j Farmer was no Runner and, the
Luckie indian got away to a Cave
! in the Hills, where he laid Lowe for
two or three Weeks.
And while he was laying Lowe,
the Dailey a' Holme Hunt-ed up a
name for the Little indian which
1 will be reVailcd toMorrow.
