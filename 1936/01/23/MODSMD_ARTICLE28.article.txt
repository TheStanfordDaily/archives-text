# New Deal Proposes Two-Year Farm Plan
## Bill Will Provide Federal Funds For Crop Control Act Designed To Give Almost Unlimited Leadership to Secretary of Agriculture 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (AP). â€”Congress received the administration's
new two-year farm program today with immediate constitutional mis
givings over the proposed federal subsidy for voluntary production control
through scientific use of land.
Identical hills were introduced in both branches, designed to confer
virtually unlimited powers upon the Secretary of Agriculture to pay

growers out of a $440,000,000 appro-<
priation to come later in a separate |
measure.
Senator Bankhead, author of (he
Compulsory Cotton Control " i
now under fire in the Sup .lie j
Court, offered the AAA-substkute j
bill in the Senate. It was referred j
to the Agriculture Committee,
which will begin consideration to
morrow.
Chairman Jones of the House Ag
riculture Committee, introduced the
same proposal in the House after ,
his committee had given the ques- i
tion cursory examination in an ex- j
ecutive session.
Even supporters of the bill con- j
ceded it faced a long and rough road
as some members of both houses
contended it was just as unconsti
tutional as the AAA, in the light of
the Supreme Court decision.
Senator Norris, a constitutional
and farm authority, said that in
his judgment thr bill is constitu
tional, but asserted it is unconsti- J
tutional under the "last legisla- I
tive act of the Supreme Court." j
He added:
"I'm willing to pass it and try it. i
I don't think it is unconstitutional j
personally, but under the AAA de- j
cision it is unconstitutional. That is |
the law now.''
Senator McNary, of Oregon, the
Republican leader, said:
"I am not sure this proposal
comes clear of constitutional com
plications. The Secretary of Agri
culture is given power to make
payments to producers who cur
tail their production through no
means for benefit payments are
specified.
"I hope some plan may be evolved
that will be permanent and free
from unconstitutional suspicion." |
Secretary Wallace told his press j
conference, however, that he be
lieved the bill constitutional. He de- 1
clined comment on specific provi- i
siens.
