Campus leaders are unanimously
in favor of the rule against smok
ing in examinations, which was
placed before the Ex Committee at
the recommendation of President
Ray Lyman Wilbur and the Men's
and Women's Councils. Following
are the statements of a few of them
when questioned on the subject:
Bob Gros, student manager: "I
think that Ex Committee should
pass this rule in order to eliminate
the bad atmosphere during exams,
as well as out of respect to Mrs.
Stanford."
Phil Coghlan, chairman of the
Rally Committee: "It's a good idea.
I think that something should be
done about smoking in examina
tions and if the students can't handle
it themselves the Ex Committee
should."
Wayne Richardson, debating man
ager: "I think that there should be
a rule against all the smoking that
is done in examinations."
George Lindahl, dramatic man
ager: "It's a swell idea. Those that
want to smoke can go outside to do
it. There is not much sense in mak
ing the majority, which does not
smoke, suffer for the comfort af a
few.
