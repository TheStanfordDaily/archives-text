# Lesley Replies To Critics Of Store's Policy
## Head Plans To Enlarge Used Text Department 
### 
In reply to a Vox Campi con
tributor, Professor Lesley, presi- I
dent of the Stanford Bookstore,
furnishes this statements of Book
store policy, the first of a series on
Bookstore questions. The follow
ing words are Professor Lesley's:
"The Board of Directors of the
Stanford Bookstore has asked for j
an expression of student opinion
upon this question: is there a less
cumbersome but equally or more |
satisfactory method of returning j
operating profits to customers than j
the present system of rebates? In i
the Daily of January 8, Mr. Willard
Spring made certain statements j
that, although offering no answer to !
the question, may be true, and they j
perhaps deserve comment.
"It would be a rare institution
indeed that could not 'stand in- !
ternal changes'; such changes are j
continually being made in the
Stanford Bookstore. The directors j
would, I believe, establish a sepa
rate 'used text department' if the j
volume of business would justify i
a 'separate' department, if space :
for it were available, and if the
required used texts could be pur- ;
chased.
"If such a department were 'effi- ■
cient' it should add to profits rather !
than dispose of them. Tlie Bookstore j
now handles used texts in the Text- I
book Department in any quantity :
that we are able to buy and sell. ;
Plans are being made for increasing !
the stock of vised texts and thus
meeting, as far as possible, the de
mand.
"With reference to the state
ment that students are not allowed
'to see the textbook price sched
ule, I believe Mr. Spring is in
error; it is available on request.
It was removed from the counter
because the material in it, gath
ered at considerable effort and at
no small expense, was, in this lo
cation, available to competitors
at no cost, and was being used by
them.
"There is no intention of 'fasten
ing an anchor to future profits.' If
the present rebate system is aban
doned in favor of some plan for dis- •
tribution of profit that seems, at this
time, better, the adopted plan can

just as easily be replaced by another
at some future time whenever an
other change seems advisable."
