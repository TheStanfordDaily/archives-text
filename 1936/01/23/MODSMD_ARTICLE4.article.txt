# Grayson Tops Committee Absent List
## 
### 
Those big new shiny cars could
n't have had anything to do with
it, but Ex Committee attendance
is falling off.
October and November were
fair, but since the Big Game. â€”
well, at only one meeting in the
last five could the committee pass
on by-laws to the A.S.S.U. con
stitution. Ten members must be
there for that.
Athletes, it seems, lead the non
attendance field with Senior Man
Bobby Grayson's seven absences
out of 13 meetings. The commit
tee missed Hank Luisetti, sopho
more man, six times, and Dinty
Moore, membcr-at-large, three.
Frank Fullenwider, graduate
man, is the only committeeman,
except President Wally Brooke
and Vice-President Jackie Flan
ders, with a clean record. He
missed not a meeting.
Others absent were: Adrienne
Johnston, sophomore woman,
three times; Jean Anderson, sen
ior woman, and Helen Grover
junior woman, twice; Sterling
Cottrell, junior man, Jack Han
son and Bill Stark, whom he re
placed as graduate man, each
once.
