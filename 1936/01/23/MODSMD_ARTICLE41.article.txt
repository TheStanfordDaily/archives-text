## SOME MORE DOPE ON RUGBY 
### 
Continuing our little "steal" of a
past Daily sport sage's explanatory !
remarks on rugby, we herein repro- i
duce parts of Spud Hamilton's reve- |
lations on scoring, players, and |
scrum.
Scoring in rugby is accomp- j
lished much the same as in Amor- i
ican football, the general idea be
ing to carry the ball across the
goal line, or kick it through the
goal posts from a place or drop
kick.
Touching the ball down across the ;
goal line is called a try and counts 3
points. The scorer does not neces
sarily carry the ball over, but may
have kicked or dribbled it. If a
member of the opposing team
touches the ball down behind his
own goal lino, it is similar to the !
touchback in American, and the de
fensive team gets a drop kick from >
behind its own 25-yard line.
After making a try Ihe scoring i
team gets a chance to convert it, J
but instead of placing the ball nicely I
in front of the goal posts, it must be i
kicked from a point any distance j
directly out from where the try was |
touched down. Therefore, when
the ball carrier crosses the goal, he |
attempts to put the ball down close I
to the goal posts in order to make |
the angle easy for the kicker.
A good conversion gives the ,
scoring team an additional two {
points; the try and conversion
amounting to five points is sonic- ,
times called a goal.
Place kicks through the goal posts i
from the field count for 3 points, and !
usually occur when a free kick is 1
called as penalty for a foul. The less
said about these the better.
A drop kick from the field of play
is very spectacular when done, and
seems to be quite a rarity in these i
parts. "Dink" Tcmpleton is sup- I
posed to have booted such a kick i
over from the 45-yard line when 1
playing for the American Olympic j
team in France in 1920; and as we I
have never heard of bis denying it, i
the distance stands with us. When j
made, it's good for four points.

attempts to put the ball down close I
to the goal posts in order to make |
the angle easy for the kicker.

scoring team an additional two {
points; the try and conversion
amounting to five points is sonic- ,

from the field count for 3 points, and !
usually occur when a free kick is 1

said about these the better.
A drop kick from the field of play
is very spectacular when done, and
seems to be quite a rarity in these i
parts. "Dink" Tcmpleton is sup- I
posed to have booted such a kick i
over from the 45-yard line when 1
playing for the American Olympic j
team in France in 1920; and as we I
have never heard of bis denying it, i
the distance stands with us. When j
made, it's good for four points.
Continuing our little "steal" of a
past Daily sport sage's explanatory !
remarks on rugby, we herein repro- i
duce parts of Spud Hamilton's reve- |
lations on scoring, players, and |
scrum.
Scoring in rugby is accomp- j
lished much the same as in Amor- i
ican football, the general idea be
ing to carry the ball across the
goal line, or kick it through the
goal posts from a place or drop
kick.
Touching the ball down across the ;
goal line is called a try and counts 3
points. The scorer does not neces
sarily carry the ball over, but may
have kicked or dribbled it. If a
member of the opposing team
touches the ball down behind his
own goal lino, it is similar to the !
touchback in American, and the de
fensive team gets a drop kick from >
behind its own 25-yard line.
