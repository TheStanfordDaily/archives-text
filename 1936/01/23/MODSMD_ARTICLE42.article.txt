# TO SIMPLIFY THE SCRUM
## 
### 
The rugby team is divided into
two groups of players with diversi
fied duties roughly corresponding to
the line and backfield in American
football. UsUtflly the rugby back
field is composed of seven men and
the forwards, or "scrum" of eight.
The names of players' positions
are derived from their formation
in the scrum when they line up,
and although each man has a tech
nical name, it suffices that we ac
cept the common terminology
used in (his vicinity. Stanford
uses what is called the three-four
scrum and they assemble some
what as follows:

In the above diagram the O's
correspond to the opposing serum.
W is the Stanford wing forward,
the three X's are the front rankers,
the Y's are the rear rankers, and
the Z's ai'e the break-aways.
The wing forward throws the
ball into the scrum; the front
rankers try to kick or "heel" it
back through the scrum; (he
breakaways and the rear rankers
buttress the front rankers; the
breakaways and the wing for
wards are alert to stop the oppo
nents should they gain control of
the ball.
Tomoriow we'll wind up with
some dope on backs, the lineout,
and penalties. —Frost
