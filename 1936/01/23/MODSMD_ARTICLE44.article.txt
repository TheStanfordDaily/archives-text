# Cagers Train For S.C. Tussle
## 
### 
Two victories and the Conference
lead.
Such are the goals Coach John
Bunn's Redskin Hoopsters will be
aiming at when they tussle with
U.S.C. on Friday and Saturday in
the Pavilion. A coupLe of triumphs
would put Stanford out in front
for the first time in more than a
decade of Coast league competition.
With Hank Luisetti back at bis
regular forward post yesterday,
the varsity was hard at work
testing its offense an<l defense tac
tics against the reserves. The
cagey cagers at Troy, however,
were not exactly idle while all
this went on.
The powerful defense that was
the most noteworthy point in the
Trojans' favoi in their performances
against the Bears and the Bruins is
still being worked on by Coach Sam
Barry. In drills during the past
week it has come in for more than
a little attention.
To Oram and Muth, it seems,
must go the most credit for the
effectiveness of this defense while
Captain Hupp, with his easy man
ner of play, literally waltzes
around the court breaking up
plays. Anderson is another man
who has perfected a similar style
and Browning and Dale cannot
be overlooked as defensive per
formers.
With the exception of Dale, this
quintet will be starting against the
Indians in both frays this week-end.
And the Redskins must successfully
combat the threatening defense that
the Trojans pack in their bag of
tricks before Stanford can lead her
league.
