# Frosh Hoopsters Trounce Salinas Jaysees, 36-9
## Calkins, McArthur Lead Yearlings To Easy Victory Bradshaw's Team To Meet Piedmont Tomorrow, Stockton Preps on Saturday 
### Roger Kimball 
Stanford's frosh basketball team has yet to be tested on its home floor.
That fact was made clear last night as "Rabbit" Bradshaw's quintet made
numerous mistakes, hut still whipped Salinas Junior College, .*i(> to 5).
The jaysees had nothing but their uniforms; so the Papooses got away
with a mediocre game. llow well they could play against a strong team

remains to be seen. It is certain •
that none of the high school or jun- 1
ior college fives played in the past i
two weeks have provided any in- ;
spiring opposition.
Salinas broke all precedents by
taking a 2-0 lead over the frosh
on a side shot by Jordan. Lyman
Calkins, best of Bradshaw's men
last night, tied the score a mo- j
mcnt later. From that point on
the Thirty-niners amassed a big
ger and bigger advantage, in spite
of countless missed set-ups and
many "hutches" on the floor.
Phil Zonne was off form, scoring
only nine points, but he was still
high-point man. Calkins was second
with four nice baskets. The slim
blond forward played a heads-up
game, often stealing the ball from
Salinas. Pete IVlcArthur tossed
three perfect baskets, as usual, the
ball never touching the rim. The |
curly-haired guard's sharpshooting
may be invaluable if the frosh ever
get any competition.
In its dying minutes, the game
was enlivened by two technical
fouls called on Frank Powers,
jaysee coach, for his verbal ob
jections to the referee. Dick Nccley j
sank the second free throw !
awarded Stanford.
Piedmont High School will bring j
what is at least rumored to be a 1
stronger team to the Pavilion for a,
tussle with the frosh at 6:30 o'clock
tomorrow night. Pete Lenz's pow
erful Stockton Tarzans invade the
Farm Saturday. Both games will be
preliminaries to the varsity encoun
ters with U.S.C. The frosh may have
to wo''k this week-end, or they may

not be extended until the first set
to with California's Bear Cubs two
weeks off.

last night, tied the score a mo- j
mcnt later. From that point on
the Thirty-niners amassed a big
ger and bigger advantage, in spite
of countless missed set-ups and
many "hutches" on the floor.
Phil Zonne was off form, scoring
only nine points, but he was still
high-point man. Calkins was second
with four nice baskets. The slim
blond forward played a heads-up
game, often stealing the ball from
Salinas. Pete IVlcArthur tossed
three perfect baskets, as usual, the
ball never touching the rim. The |
curly-haired guard's sharpshooting
may be invaluable if the frosh ever
get any competition.
In its dying minutes, the game
was enlivened by two technical
fouls called on Frank Powers,
jaysee coach, for his verbal ob
jections to the referee. Dick Nccley j
sank the second free throw !
awarded Stanford.
Piedmont High School will bring j
what is at least rumored to be a 1
stronger team to the Pavilion for a,
tussle with the frosh at 6:30 o'clock
tomorrow night. Pete Lenz's pow
erful Stockton Tarzans invade the
Farm Saturday. Both games will be
preliminaries to the varsity encoun
ters with U.S.C. The frosh may have
to wo''k this week-end, or they may

not be extended until the first set
to with California's Bear Cubs two
weeks off.

Stanford's frosh basketball team has yet to be tested on its home floor.
That fact was made clear last night as "Rabbit" Bradshaw's quintet made
numerous mistakes, hut still whipped Salinas Junior College, .*i(> to 5).
The jaysees had nothing but their uniforms; so the Papooses got away
with a mediocre game. llow well they could play against a strong team

remains to be seen. It is certain •
that none of the high school or jun- 1
ior college fives played in the past i
two weeks have provided any in- ;
spiring opposition.
Salinas broke all precedents by
taking a 2-0 lead over the frosh
on a side shot by Jordan. Lyman
