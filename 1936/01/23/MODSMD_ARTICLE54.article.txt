# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Fix Date for Student Panel Probe of Ex Committee Set-Up While Topic Alive 
### 
As a result of the radical changes in election
of Ex Committee members proposed by Pub
lications Councilman Creamer Tuesday the
present members of that body resolved that
the matter was important enough to he turned
over to a student panel—a wise move.
The chance for discussion that has arisen
should not be allowed to lizzie out. A real
clash of two schools of thought has been
brought into the local arena by the sugges
tion for a "functional" Ex Committee.
Creamer's scheme was to have an Ex Com
mittee of "experts" from various activities
groups represent the campus instead of popu
larly elected ones, whose caliber in the past,
he claims, has not been high enough to make
them competent to judge the matters coining
before them.

The swords'-points at which the proposed
system and the present one of democratically
elected, presumably impartial and responsible
members is but a small-time parallel of the
conflicts between Fascism and Democracy,
the New Deal and old-line Individualism.
Being a good political topic, there is much
to he said on both sides: that experts go in
for too much log-rolling and that unpreju
diced legislators even if of lesser caliber are
preferable; that "functional" representation
is better than the looser class form of repre
sentation; and so on.
The present plea is that Ex Committee
doesn't fail to appoint a time and place soon
so that the sayings can be said while the topic
is alive, and that the coming panel be well
arranged and publicized.
