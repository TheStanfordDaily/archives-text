# Make It an Appropriate Award, Ex Committee

### 
Ex Committee Tuesday night heard a com
mittee report which favored inscribing the
names of all football letternien of the past

three years on a plaque to be hung in an
appropriate place in the new theater; the
group then tabled action on the report pend
ing completion of arrangements.
The plaque will be an appropriate honor for
the teams which kept Stanford near the head
of the nation's gridiron roster for three years.
Its effect, however, would be nullified if Ex
Committee should include the long list of
names that the committee report suggests.
Already - awarded block letters and gold
footballs are tokens of A.S.S.U. appreciation
to the three individual teams. In order to be
out of the ordinary, this special award must
honor the one "team" that provided continu
ity from one year to the next.
If Ex Committee does not limit the in
scribed names to the comparatively few three
year lettermen, it will ruin what might be an
appropriate tribute to a clearly defined group
of football players—those who were the nu
cleus of all three Rose Bowl teams.
