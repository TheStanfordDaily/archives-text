# Bull Session
## STANFORD EXONERATED 
### 
To the president of this university . , . Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur . . . this Bull Sessioner herewith says
"thanks." . . . Thanks for the most sensible and
authoritative replies to criticisms which have been
leveled at Stanford ... in this column and in other
places . . . that have ever been made.

Agitated by the ever increasing flow of charges and
rumors against and about Stanford, an aiumni or
ganization took action. It fired 54 pertinent questions
at Dr. Wilbur, assuming that he was best equipped
to give the answers. Some of the replies he made
should not go unchallenged, apd they won't. All of
them are more interesting than news. A few of
them, seemingly designed for campus consumption,
are here presented.

Do the facts justify the opinion that scholarship
and scholastic prestige have materially shrunk? Dr.
Wilbur's answer: "Such gossipy rumors must have
started when the basis for entrance requirements was
reorganized. That change actually tightened up our
requirements. No truthful or authoritative report has
ever been issued which indicates that Stanford schol
arship averages hfjve gone down."
* * * *
Has the quality of the teaching staff deteriorated?
"No—it has definitely improved. No greater effort has
ever been put forth at Stanford to provide a high
grade teaching staff."
Has Stanford lowered standards out of deference
to the revenue from increased registration? "No.
With the diminishing number of applicants during the
depression, some students were admitted who would
not have been able to get in during favorable times.
This no longer applies."
* * * *
Is it true that Stanford professors teach radical
theories? "Stanford is as free from radicalism as any
similar institution in the country. Radical theories
are sometimes discussed, as they should be, but not
taught."
Does Stanford teach Americanism, Constitutional
government, political honesty, and set itself up as a
leader in such a movement? "I doubt if there is any
place where Constitutional government, political hon
esty, and Americanism are better taught than under
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson."
* * * *
With undisguised frankness, Dr. Wilbur answered
many other questions and presented these opinions:
The fraternity and sorority system is on a satisfactory
status. Income from athletic sports is not used for
athletic scholarships; on that Stanford has taken a
firm position. The "apple-polishing" complex is dying
out at Stanford. Life in Encina, on the whole, does
comport with the requirements of the code and educa
tion of a gentleman. The number of women will not
be reduced to 500. It is desirable to further stress
intramural sports at the present time. Post season foot
ball ... is a good thing.
But most gratifying of all was Dr. Wilbur s answer
to this question: Has the comparative scholarship be
tween Stanford and the University of California been
reversed in recent years? Said he: "I think that Stan
ford has improved in scholarship during the past few
years; and in so far as the University of California is
concerned, I can say that an increasing number of the
sons and daughters of the alumni of that institution are
entering Stanford.'' * —John McClelland
