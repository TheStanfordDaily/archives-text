about the enterprising Cotillion Dance Committee, who
hit upon the well-worked idea of high-pressuring
fraternity men into buying tickets, by sending women
committee members around to fiaternity houses for a
free meal.
In line of duty, a Theta soph walked across the
street to the Deke House.
When the meal was through, she arose and ha
rangued the men, but succeeded in selling only one
bid. This disturbed the woman no end, but she was
resourceful. As she left, she said, "I want to thank
you Zetes very much."

Because of the current campaign about "No Smoul

conduct a cigarette-butt raid on a poly sci professor
who is rumored to be taking surreptitious drags behind
closed blinds.

While they're about it the officials might run to

the other hand, maybe the officials had better walk.

In a geology lecture room there has been at odd
intervals a cardboard packing carton bearing the
stencil: "From 'Sewera' Liquor Co., Reno, Nevada."
My advice isâ€” It's lousy beer, lay off it.
