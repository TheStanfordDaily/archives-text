CHICAGO, Jan. 22 (/P). â€” Resi
dents of continental U.S. couldn't
console themselves during today's
record smashing zero wave with the
thought, "Well, anyway, it must be
colder in Alaska."
While the mercury fell to 55 below
zero on the bridge between this
country and Canada at International
Falls, Minn., Juneau, Alaska, boasted
the thawing record of 36 above. It
was still warmer in Calgary, Al
berta, with 42 above.
