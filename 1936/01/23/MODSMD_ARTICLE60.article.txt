j "REVOLT ON THE CAMPUS," by i
James Wechslcr (Covici-Friedc). .
Mr. Wechsler, last year's editor of
| the Columbia Spectator, has writ- !
ten a fascinating and convincing j
book. Frankiy a radical and an ad
i vocate of "liberal" college admin- j
istration, Wechsler builds an im- j
, pressive case against reactionary j
; influences in American universi- j
j ties.
Unfortunately, the author suffers !
i from the same ailments that prevent i
I many a pinkish writer from suc
ceeding in his purpose—a sense of
I humor and an ability to see the
j other side of a controversy are en- ;
i tirely lacking. The result is an hon- >
est book, but not a fair one.
It is obvious that Mr. Wechsler i$ i
I right when he points out that state |
! universities are influenced by poli
tics, and that private institutions arc 1
| dominated by those wealthy patrons j
who donate funds for their upkeep,
1 but before damning college presi- I
I dents because they cater to their I
! official and financial superiors, the I

author should have given the prob
lem more consideration. This is
probably the only country in the
world where men and women are
able to secure a college education
regardless of wealth or social posi
tion. Politicians and capitalist
philanthropists have made this
possible.
Uprisings, anti-war strikes, fac
ulty and student expulsions, and
school paper controversies which
have taken place during recent
years at various universities are
discussed with indignation which is
often merited. The University of
Pittsburgh is held up as a horrible
example of an educational institu
tion dominated by Andrew Mellon.
C.C.N.Y. and Hunter College re
ceive condemnation because of the
policy of their administrators in
stamping out radical action.
"Revolt on the Campus," though
taking itself far too seriously, is a
clearly and powerfully written
book, and one that makes the reader
think. —Bernhard
