### 
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 22 (JP).â€”A new I
dietetic treatment for diabetes,
which has restored some patients to
unrestricted diets with no further
need for insulin, was described to j
the St. Louis Medical Society tonight
by a pioneer research scientist.
Dr. Michael Somogyi, director of
the bio-chemical laboratory of the
Jewish Hospital here, reported a
joint study with Dr. Jerome Cook i
of the hospital staff, readily as- '
sented that the treatment would not i
apply to all diabetic cases, although
he indicated from his own cxpe- :
liences with 274 cases that about 85 ,
per cent might be aided.
