# Judges in Huddle Over Brave's Name
## Edit Injun To Splurge In Full Glory Tomorrow 
### 
Closing amid a flurry of last min- I
uto suggestions, the Name-the-1
Injun contest ended at noon yester- j
day. Guffaws from the editor's !
sanctum testified that Our Hash- |
Sash, Creator Barnes, and Editor- ;
mans Jones were busy assorting the j
chaff from the chaff.
Little Joe Nameless, the edit !
page brave over whom all the fuss \
is being made, will appear in to- j
morrow's Daily fully legitimat
ized and bearing a moniker. The j
three judges had 120 names from j
80 entrants to choose from, at- [
testing to the fact that while the I
student body may be apathetic, j
it's not quite dead.
Puns and more puns furnished
reasons to back up the choices of
contestants. Unexpectedly few In
dian names came in, although every
conceivable kind of red, toboggan,
Stanford, Daily, and numerous
coined names were represented.
Other contestants could not pass
up the glorious chance to take digs ,
at the rushing system, the Union j
and Bookstore, the Daily, and other j
local gripe-centers.
Forms of entries ranged from |
scraps of paper with one line on
them, through postcards, through |
letters in verse, to a threatening I
telegram from the "Cubicle Tri
umvirate, Heaven's Holy Hollow, j
Stanford, Calif.", suggesting that
for the judges' own safety they
find a verdict for the complaintiff. I
Propounder of the chosen cogno- i
men will receive ten dollars in nego- '
tiable coin-of-the-realm, nine will I
receive cigarettes cartons, Pee-Wee {
No-name will receive a name and '
possible official A.S.S.U. recogni- I
lion, and the jedges will receive a j
class A-l headache.
