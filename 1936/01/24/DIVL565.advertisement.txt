Sheer grege wool frock, as smart as it could be . . .
peppered with tweedy brown lines, the prettiest we
ever did see. A dash of red through the tunnel collar
and accenting the diamond-shaped belt. Covered
with buttons (you can't see this view) running
smack up the back, which is very svelt. Hearty little
pin-tucks on the cuffs and bosom front. All in all a
dandy number if you're out to steal the campus
thunder.
