# Three Knockouts, Dull Bouts Mark University Finals
## DeVeuve Loses; Mynderse, Velarde, Winzler, Purdy Look Good in Winning 
### Mel Jacoby 
After the brawl was over, eight men stepped from the ring last night
clasping a small gold glove symbolizing an all-University championship
and a probable berth on the varsity boxing squad. Although three
technical knockouts were awarded, contestants v.ere evenly matched,
giving spectators the thud of leather pushing which they came to hear.

Outstanding men in last night's 4
all-University tourney were Frank
Mynderse and Dick Winzler. Both
demonstrated the speed and form
their experience warranted. Myn
derse, sophomore sensation, left the
Palo Alto hospital but a few minutes
before his fight, and returned imme
diately c'fter his decision over Pope
for the 165-pound title.
Upset of the evening was Sims
de Veuve's loss to Harold Sauncrs.
DeVeuve, the former Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate junior light heavy
champ, seemed to hold back the
entire bout. Judges gave the deci
sion to Saunders with a two to one
vote.
Wrestlers had a chance to show
their prowess and staged eight bouts
for University championships. Twins
Zook and Zook met on the mat and
according to the judges' decision
Dwight came out on top.
In the 145-pound class Bud Bo
hoskey finally subdued his oppo
nent Ham Eaton. Rally commit
teemen cheered when Phil Coghlin
defeated Marvin Larson for the
105-pound championship. Ed Mc-
Donald, subbing for Jerry Tor
rance, put on a great battle against
Johnny Piatt before losing the
175-pound decision.
Mat contenders put on a rather
dull show, as entrants were for the
most part less evenly matched.
Boxing matches began at 8
o'clock. First bout was between
118-pounders, Inouye and Velarde,
the defending champ. Although it
was Velarde's light from the first,
the match started the program off
with several minutes of fast
punches thrown.
Velarde threw a barrage of body
jabs in the first round which caught
Inouye open. At the start of the
second he warded off a similar at
tack with good blocking and replied
with several effective lefts. Velarde
proved too strong and the fight
ended with l-eferee Flannigan's tech
nical k.o. decision.
The next fight, 126-pound class,
was finished in the first round,
after another technical knockout
was awarded to Purdy. It started
fast with Purdy throwing rights
in Giorgi's direction. They came
straight and hard. After a few
minutes of good fighting the match
ended.
Winzler looked good from his very
first punch. Fighting in the 135-
pound class he outclassed a game
opponent, Shuck. Winzler's form
was excellent, pointing him as one
of the best on last night's program.
! Milner and Wilbur, lighting for
the 147-pound title, put on a good
show. Milner started things mov
ing when he landed a right. The
j two were on a par until about the
middle of the second round when
Wilbur's lefts took toll and judges
gave him the decision.
Pease barely outfought Sullivan
for the 155-pound bout, getting in a
few more punches than his oppo
nent. The middleweights practically
drew for the first round with
! Pease stepping out as the aggressor
I in the second and third rounds.
The poorest fight from the spec
tators' view and yet the best cx
. hibition of boxing and fist han
dling was the Mynderse - Pope
match for the l(is-pound title.
Mynderse put on a real show of
boxing, completely outclassing
Pope without slugging or letting
himself go.
The up and coming frosh boxer,
Harold Saunders, went home with
the 175-pound medal, proving he had
beaten Sims De Veuve. However,
it wasn't the De Veuve that fought
for three years at Stanford. He was
obviously taking it easy, and al
| though Saunders was good, Sims
has the ability and experience to
take him. The two had sparred to
gether too much to make a good
fight. Both men knew pretty well
what the next move would be.
Heavyweights Boone and Fowler
failed to put on the slug-fest
usually seen in Stanford bouts. For
[ the first two rounds they managed
J to stay away from each other and in
i the third exchanged a short series
| of punches. Fowler took the decision
I from Boone.

technical knockouts were awarded, contestants v.ere evenly matched,
giving spectators the thud of leather pushing which they came to hear.

Outstanding men in last night's 4
all-University tourney were Frank
Mynderse and Dick Winzler. Both
demonstrated the speed and form
their experience warranted. Myn
derse, sophomore sensation, left the
Palo Alto hospital but a few minutes
before his fight, and returned imme
diately c'fter his decision over Pope
for the 165-pound title.
Upset of the evening was Sims
de Veuve's loss to Harold Sauncrs.
DeVeuve, the former Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate junior light heavy
champ, seemed to hold back the
entire bout. Judges gave the deci
sion to Saunders with a two to one
vote.
Wrestlers had a chance to show
their prowess and staged eight bouts
for University championships. Twins
Zook and Zook met on the mat and
according to the judges' decision
Dwight came out on top.
In the 145-pound class Bud Bo
hoskey finally subdued his oppo
nent Ham Eaton. Rally commit
teemen cheered when Phil Coghlin
defeated Marvin Larson for the
105-pound championship. Ed Mc-
Donald, subbing for Jerry Tor
rance, put on a great battle against
Johnny Piatt before losing the
175-pound decision.
Mat contenders put on a rather
dull show, as entrants were for the
most part less evenly matched.
Boxing matches began at 8
o'clock. First bout was between
118-pounders, Inouye and Velarde,
the defending champ. Although it
was Velarde's light from the first,
the match started the program off
with several minutes of fast
punches thrown.
Velarde threw a barrage of body
jabs in the first round which caught
Inouye open. At the start of the
second he warded off a similar at
tack with good blocking and replied
with several effective lefts. Velarde
proved too strong and the fight
ended with l-eferee Flannigan's tech
nical k.o. decision.
The next fight, 126-pound class,
was finished in the first round,
after another technical knockout
was awarded to Purdy. It started
fast with Purdy throwing rights
in Giorgi's direction. They came
straight and hard. After a few
minutes of good fighting the match
ended.
Winzler looked good from his very
first punch. Fighting in the 135-
pound class he outclassed a game
opponent, Shuck. Winzler's form
was excellent, pointing him as one
of the best on last night's program.
! Milner and Wilbur, lighting for
the 147-pound title, put on a good
show. Milner started things mov
ing when he landed a right. The
j two were on a par until about the
middle of the second round when
Wilbur's lefts took toll and judges
gave him the decision.
Pease barely outfought Sullivan
for the 155-pound bout, getting in a
few more punches than his oppo
nent. The middleweights practically
drew for the first round with
! Pease stepping out as the aggressor
I in the second and third rounds.
The poorest fight from the spec
tators' view and yet the best cx
. hibition of boxing and fist han
dling was the Mynderse - Pope
match for the l(is-pound title.
Mynderse put on a real show of
boxing, completely outclassing
Pope without slugging or letting
himself go.
The up and coming frosh boxer,
Harold Saunders, went home with
the 175-pound medal, proving he had
beaten Sims De Veuve. However,
it wasn't the De Veuve that fought
for three years at Stanford. He was
obviously taking it easy, and al
| though Saunders was good, Sims
has the ability and experience to
take him. The two had sparred to
gether too much to make a good
fight. Both men knew pretty well
what the next move would be.
Heavyweights Boone and Fowler
failed to put on the slug-fest
usually seen in Stanford bouts. For
[ the first two rounds they managed
J to stay away from each other and in
i the third exchanged a short series
| of punches. Fowler took the decision
I from Boone.
After the brawl was over, eight men stepped from the ring last night

their experience warranted. Myn
derse, sophomore sensation, left the
Palo Alto hospital but a few minutes
before his fight, and returned imme
diately c'fter his decision over Pope
for the 165-pound title.
Upset of the evening was Sims
de Veuve's loss to Harold Sauncrs.
DeVeuve, the former Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate junior light heavy
champ, seemed to hold back the
entire bout. Judges gave the deci
sion to Saunders with a two to one
vote.
Wrestlers had a chance to show
their prowess and staged eight bouts
for University championships. Twins
Zook and Zook met on the mat and
according to the judges' decision
Dwight came out on top.
In the 145-pound class Bud Bo
hoskey finally subdued his oppo
nent Ham Eaton. Rally commit
teemen cheered when Phil Coghlin
defeated Marvin Larson for the
105-pound championship. Ed Mc-
Donald, subbing for Jerry Tor
rance, put on a great battle against
Johnny Piatt before losing the
175-pound decision.
Mat contenders put on a rather
dull show, as entrants were for the
most part less evenly matched.
Boxing matches began at 8
o'clock. First bout was between
118-pounders, Inouye and Velarde,
the defending champ. Although it
was Velarde's light from the first,
the match started the program off
with several minutes of fast
punches thrown.
Velarde threw a barrage of body
jabs in the first round which caught
Inouye open. At the start of the
second he warded off a similar at
tack with good blocking and replied
with several effective lefts. Velarde
proved too strong and the fight
ended with l-eferee Flannigan's tech
nical k.o. decision.
The next fight, 126-pound class,
was finished in the first round,
after another technical knockout
was awarded to Purdy. It started
fast with Purdy throwing rights
in Giorgi's direction. They came
straight and hard. After a few
minutes of good fighting the match
ended.
Winzler looked good from his very
first punch. Fighting in the 135-
pound class he outclassed a game
opponent, Shuck. Winzler's form
was excellent, pointing him as one
of the best on last night's program.
! Milner and Wilbur, lighting for
the 147-pound title, put on a good
show. Milner started things mov
ing when he landed a right. The
j two were on a par until about the
middle of the second round when
Wilbur's lefts took toll and judges
gave him the decision.
Pease barely outfought Sullivan
for the 155-pound bout, getting in a
few more punches than his oppo
nent. The middleweights practically
drew for the first round with
! Pease stepping out as the aggressor
I in the second and third rounds.
The poorest fight from the spec
tators' view and yet the best cx
. hibition of boxing and fist han
dling was the Mynderse - Pope
match for the l(is-pound title.
Mynderse put on a real show of
boxing, completely outclassing
Pope without slugging or letting
himself go.
The up and coming frosh boxer,
Harold Saunders, went home with
the 175-pound medal, proving he had
beaten Sims De Veuve. However,
it wasn't the De Veuve that fought
for three years at Stanford. He was
obviously taking it easy, and al
| though Saunders was good, Sims
has the ability and experience to
take him. The two had sparred to
gether too much to make a good
fight. Both men knew pretty well
what the next move would be.
Heavyweights Boone and Fowler
failed to put on the slug-fest
usually seen in Stanford bouts. For
[ the first two rounds they managed
J to stay away from each other and in
i the third exchanged a short series
| of punches. Fowler took the decision
I from Boone.
After the brawl was over, eight men stepped from the ring last night
clasping a small gold glove symbolizing an all-University championship
and a probable berth on the varsity boxing squad. Although three
technical knockouts were awarded, contestants v.ere evenly matched,
giving spectators the thud of leather pushing which they came to hear.

Outstanding men in last night's 4
all-University tourney were Frank
Mynderse and Dick Winzler. Both
demonstrated the speed and form
their experience warranted. Myn
derse, sophomore sensation, left the
Palo Alto hospital but a few minutes
