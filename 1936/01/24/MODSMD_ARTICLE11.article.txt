# Cold Sweeps East; Week's Deaths 200
## Sub-Zero Records Hit From Dakota to Atlantic 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (JP). — Sub
zero temperatures and whistling
winds from the Canadian North
west increased their toll of human
lives loday as they swept from the
Dakotas to the Atlantic.
More than 200 deaths within
the last week were attributed to
the weather.
At least IV7 died in snow-cov
ered northern states last Satur
day, Sunday and Monday, mostly
in traffic accidents on icy high
ways. At least 54 more were frozen
to death, died of exposure or in
fires yesterday and today as added
warmth was sought against some of
the lowest temperatures since the
turn of the century.
The freakish frigidity today
closed schools and factories, halted
automobile traffic, blocked or de
layed rail transportation, broke in
numerable plate glass windows,
caused widespread hardship, in
numerable fires, hundreds of traf
fic accidents and intense suffering
for birds and beasts.
The weather was not entirely
without good for it brought higher
prices in the grain and livestock
markets, jammed hotels with subur
banites too timid to risk the journeys
home, flooded coal and clothing
merchants with rush orders, and
caused a severe shortage in the ear
muff, scarf, and mitten industries.
The cold had little effect on most
airlines and schedules generally
were maintained.
The subzero temperatures ranged
from minus 56 on the bridge over the
Rainy River between International
Falls, Minn., and Fort Frances, Ont.
—for the second successive day cold
est spot on the weather map and one
degree more frigid than yesterday—
to New York's 2 below.
