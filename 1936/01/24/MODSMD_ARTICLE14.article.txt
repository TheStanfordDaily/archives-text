Twenty-five years ago cowboys
were the accepted policemen of the
road that is now the Bayshore.
Hired by the San Mateo County su
pervisors at $7.50 a day, two mounted
"vaqueros" rode up and down the
highway to repe unlucky motorists
violating the five-mile per hour
speed limit.
Since the autos of those days
had neither tops nor windshields,
speeders could he easily jerked
from their seats hy the "cow
cop's" lasso. The pounding of
horses' hoofs hack of him was as
much a sign of arrest to the auto
driver o' those days as the scream
ing siren is to his descendants to
day.
With the introduction Of speedier
cars, the cowboy went out and the
era of the motorcycle cop began.
Now even that familiar guardian of
the highways is being replaced by
cops in stream-lined white cars and
—even more ingenious—by police

men in towers along the road.
San Mateo County has com
pleted the construction of one of
these "rages," an innocent-look
ing white tower along the Bay
shore Highway, as the most recent
addition to its road safety system.
Erected at a strategic point on the
road, the tower serves as a lookout
for a policeman who continually
surveys the vicinity with a spy
glass, spotting speeding college
students and other fast drivers.
With his high-powered binocu
lars, he can tee cars coming from
such a long distance that the speed
ing autoist is no longer afforded se
curity by keeping one eye glued on
the rear-view mirror in which he
can detect cops on motorcycies or
cars.
It's a far cry from the cowboy
cop and his lasso to the officer and
his spyglass in the tower. But
chariging rates of speed demand evo
lution of safety officers.
