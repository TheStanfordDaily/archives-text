; tor of the 8.A.C., in a statement to
The Daily last night deplored the

i tickets" sold to students for the
U.S.C. basketball games tonight and

"I'm amazed at the lack of stu

of the games this week-end. This
figure is much lower than those of
Trojan games in previous years
when we had poorer teams.
"Our present squad looks like the
best we've had in 15 years, but the
j general public seems to be buying
more tickets than the students are,"
| he stated.

| two games is closed, but the ducats
i may be purchased for the 75-cent
j general admission fee. Students
