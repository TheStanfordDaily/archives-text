# Rushing Set-up Aired by Council
## Committee Sounds Out Fraternities' Reactions 
### 
In a closed round table discussion,
Interfraternity Council member's
last night hashed out Stanford's
present rushing system with the In
terfraternity Board Committee of
Investigation, now laying the
groundwork for possible changes in
the system.
The special committee, chair
maned by Dr. Joseph C. Hinsey, a
faculty member of the board,
sounded out reactions of the house
presidents to various phases of
Stanford's unique deferred-pledg
ing set-up, preparatory to drafting
recommendations for alterations, if
cny, in the regulations.
Jud Crary, alumni representative
on the investigating committee, re
minded the council of the follow
ing three fundamental rules of the
present system: first, freshmen to
stay out of fraternity houses; sec
ond, fraternity men to stay out of
Encina; and third, that there should
be no off-campus rushing. The
council cast an unofficial vote in
favor of retaining these three prin
ciples in any revised code.
Dr. Hinsey told the Council mem
bers that if any changes were made,
they must be suitable to all, and
compromise the best interests of the
houses, freshmen, and the Admin
istration.
The special committee will meet
with a fraternity alumni group and
combine the graduates' reactions
with those of the active chapters be
fore presenting its findings to the
Interfraternity Board. Any changes
will be ratified by the board before
they go to Dr. Wilbur for final ap
proval.
Ed Littlefield, Interfraternity
Council president and ex-officio
member of the investigating com
mittee, was chairman of last night's
conference.
