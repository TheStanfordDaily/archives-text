# Luisetti – Hupp Scoring Duel Seen in Week-end Tilts with Trojan Five
## 
### Herb Diamond 
To the Farm tonight comes a de
termined band of cagey cagers from
Troy, and with them comes a shiny
golden opportunity for Coach John
Dunn's Redskins.
Being men of action, the Indians
are out to make the most of their
opportunity, knowing full well
that this in turn necessitates col
lecting two triumphs in the week
end's hoop series with U.S.C.
Among the moot questions that
will be answered only when the
smoke of battle clears away to
morrow night is whether or not
the local quintet is of champion
ship caliber.
Coach Sam Barry's lads are now
leading the southern division pack in
the race for league honors, and
should they make good their cur
rent threats at the Cardinals' ex
pense, the resulting situation would
be most disconcerting to everyone
but themselves. Stanford, one win
behind the leaders with two victories
and a loss, must stop the southland
ers twice to offset the handicap of
finishing its conference schedule on
foreign courts.
Bunn's quintet travels far and
wide after next week and it is
not scheduled to return to the
Pavilion for a conference fray un
til February 28, when the season
will be ollicially wound up against
California. All of which amounts
to simply this: tonight's the night
to win, or all might well be lost.
The week-end's festivities will
see the league's top scoring aces
pitted against each other. Hank
Luisetti, now out in front with a
total of 49 points, will attempt to
retain his honors against the on
slaught to be launched by Captain
Jack Hupp of Troy, who is currently
credited with 43 digits. Luisetti's
weak ankle kept him on the side
lines during the early part of this
week. On Wednesday, however, he
returned to the practice court for a
light shooting drill, and now comes
word from Bunn than Hank will be
at his regular forward post in the
starting line-up tonight.
A prolonged cold has kept Cap
tain I)inty Moore out of action
lately, but he too, barring a sud
den change in his condition, will
start this evening. Art Stoefen and
Ilovvell Turner arc to be at their
usual positions. But John Calder
wood, Sparky Robertson, and Bob
Zonne arc still vicing for a per
manent berth at left guard. Coach
John may use any or all of them
between tonight and Sunday.
With Hupp at center, Troy will 1°
represented by a pair of veterans,
Bob Muth and Eddie Oram, at
guards, and Joe Anderson and Ward
Browning, in the forward spots. In
jured earlier in the season, Brown
ing, who was co-captain of the |
U.S.C. outfit last year, has been kept I
out of confcrence play.
The Trojans found little diffi
culty in drubbing the Bears a I
couple of weeks ago, but it will
be remembered that the Bcrkeley
ites gave the Redskins more than i
a little competition. U.C.L.A., 1
which bowed to the Indians in one
contest, and then ran away with
the honors in the next, were nosed
out by a single Trojan field goal
last week. Thus, if records are in
dicative, the quintets that tangle
here tonight are more or less
evently matched.
Perhaps a significant point in the {
Trojans' favor will be their man
to-man defense system, which has ,
developed into a fearfully effective j
weapon lately. Bunn's squad, how- I
ever, should be capable of handling i
it, as a result of the past week's of- i
fensive drills.
Both tonight's and tomorrow eve
ning's tussles are scheduled to get
under way ai; 8 o'clock. And both
will be broadcast over radio sta
tion KQW, San Jose, by Sportcaster
Doug Mont ell.
