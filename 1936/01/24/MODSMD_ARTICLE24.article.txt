### 
LONDON, Jan. 2.'5 (AP). â€”Britain's King Edward VIII stood in silent
pra>er today before the body of his father, George V, borne in death to lie
. : a a catafalque of state in medieval Westminster Hall.
Hazard and apparently weary, lie prayed with all of England as the
hody of King George was placed in its black and gold resting place amid

simple ceremonies, at the end of ai
100-mi!e journey from rustic Sand- I
riri'.'ham where the monarch died j
p (.dully Monday night.
Tonight household troops, their
brilliant uniforms partly hidden
by cloaks of somber black, stood |
watch over the body as it lay in
its oaken casket beneath the royal
standard.
" 1 persons were all who stood
t 1 o through the night. At each of ;
four corners of the purple-based j
catafalque was a Lifeguard, head
bowed and immobile, resting on his :
sword.
A little farther out into the |
brownish- gray gloom, lit by Hick- i
ering tapers at the base of the
c; t 'ialque, stood four Yeomen.
A'.np the royal standard, at one j
; t cl of the bier, the jewelled crown j
of empire glistened. At the other
end, above the head, lay the floral
erc.-es of Edward and Lhe Queen
i\l< her Mary.
The body will remain until
Tur day in the cold and ancient
hall, beneath the high wooden j
'ing placed there 500 years ago. j
Then it will be taken for the last j
i : ."ne through the streets of the em- j
pire's capital to the train which will ,
bear it to Windsor for last rites and
burial.
