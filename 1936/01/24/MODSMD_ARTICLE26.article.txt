# Three-Minute Limit For Osculation?
## 
### 
O.'Ticer Gordy Davis, campus up
holder of law and justice, didn't
actually say so, but it's rumored
about that drivers on Governor's
Lane and the golf course road will
soon be restricted to a three
minute parking ruleâ€”especially
| at night.
Commissioners in Tulsa, Okla- j
; homa, where the idea came from,
' last week enacted a law making
it a crime to kiss your girl in a
loading zone more than three i
minutes.
On the other hand, a restric- j
tion like that on the Old Ox Road
would be pretty restricting. Let's
forget about it.
