A STORE IN TAHITI
A Tahitian store offers as varied
a collection of wares as may be
found anywhere in the world.
Everything from bicycles to per
fumes is displayed.
In the show case at the front of
the shop fancy combs ,tooth brush
es, bead and shell head bands and
necklaces, pest cards, Tiki perfumes,
patent medicines, and ivory carv
ings are exhibited. Pots and pans,
bicycles, tires, gasoline lamps.

I
| bright-colorcd parous, and big- ;
brimmed straw hats hang from the j
ceiling, while wooden carvings of j
wierd idols and funny little pigs j
i stand on shelves beside beautiful |
I bowls cut from iron wood.
The purchase of goods in a Ta
j hitian store is a question of who is !
the best, bargainer, the stoic China- !
man behind the counter or the [
super-stung tourist in front of it.
Since there are no price standards ,
i on the island, the merchant sets hijj '

price at the highest point that en
| ters his mind. If the customer is
I smart enough to say casually that he
j can get the same things at the store
1 down the street for much less, this ;
! exorbitant demand will immediately
I come down.
The shrewd Chinese merchants i
who run Tahiti's business appreciate ■
! a bargainer as good as they them-
J selves are, and if a man drives an
exacting bargain, the storekeeper
; may give him a small trinket as a
' departing gilt.
