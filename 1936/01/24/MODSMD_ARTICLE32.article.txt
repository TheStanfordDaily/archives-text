# Reduction of Prices Impossible, Declares Bookstore President
## Must Cover Unforeseen Losses, Says Dr. Lesley 
### 
The imposibility of substantially
lowering Bookstore prices without
automatically menacing profits is
discussed by Professor E. P. Lesley,
president of the Bookstore, in the
second of a series of articles, an
swering criticisms and questions ap
pearing in Vox Campi.
"In the Stanford Daily of January
10, there appeared a communication
from H.C.T. on the subject of the
Stanford Bookstore profits. It car
ried the headline 'Cut the Prices
First.' 'We (the students) want to
know why,' said H.C.T., 'if the Book
store is a co-operative organization,
there should be any profit.'
"It was granted that textbooks,
fountain pens, and typewriters could
not be sold below list price, but
asked, 'why can't prices be reduced
on supplies such as paper which the
Bookstore buys by the ton and sells
by the pound?'
"Price cutting, as a means of
reducing profits to zero, is un
workable because prices must he
cut in advance of accurate knowl
edge of what the profits will be.
An estimate must be made from
past experience. This is not a re
liable guide. There will inevi
tably be a smaller profit, if prices
are cut, but there may be a loss.
The amount of profit or loss will
depend on the accuracy of the es
timate. Fn any event new prices,
to wipe out the reduced profit or
to recoup the loss, will be re
quired. This would involve con
tinual re-marking of goods, an
even more laborious process than
keeping account of rebates.
"The only workable plan for con
ducting a business is to set prices
that give a safe margin of profit and
so provide for unforeseen loss and
expense. The anticipated sales for
the Bookstore this year are $130,-
000. The estimated profit is $2,700.
The Directors believe this is not
more than a safe margin.
"There is no indication that
there will be a substantial increase
of sales in the next few years, or
that profits will be greater in the
future, if present retail prices arc
maintained. Indeed, the indica
tion is that profits will be reduced
since wholesale prices are rising.
"If profits should develop to more
than is considered a safe margin,
prices on paper and other supplies
could be reduced. This has been
clone in the past. A reduction of 10
per cent in the price of paper would
have wiped out the entire profit of
the Bookstore last year."

000. The estimated profit is $2,700.
The Directors believe this is not
more than a safe margin.
"There is no indication that
there will be a substantial increase
of sales in the next few years, or
that profits will be greater in the
future, if present retail prices arc
maintained. Indeed, the indica
tion is that profits will be reduced
since wholesale prices are rising.
"If profits should develop to more
than is considered a safe margin,
prices on paper and other supplies
could be reduced. This has been
clone in the past. A reduction of 10
per cent in the price of paper would
have wiped out the entire profit of
the Bookstore last year."
The imposibility of substantially
lowering Bookstore prices without
automatically menacing profits is
discussed by Professor E. P. Lesley,
president of the Bookstore, in the
second of a series of articles, an
swering criticisms and questions ap
pearing in Vox Campi.
"In the Stanford Daily of January
10, there appeared a communication
from H.C.T. on the subject of the
Stanford Bookstore profits. It car
ried the headline 'Cut the Prices
First.' 'We (the students) want to
know why,' said H.C.T., 'if the Book
store is a co-operative organization,
there should be any profit.'
"It was granted that textbooks,
fountain pens, and typewriters could
not be sold below list price, but
asked, 'why can't prices be reduced
on supplies such as paper which the
Bookstore buys by the ton and sells
by the pound?'
"Price cutting, as a means of
reducing profits to zero, is un
workable because prices must he
cut in advance of accurate knowl
edge of what the profits will be.
An estimate must be made from
past experience. This is not a re
liable guide. There will inevi
tably be a smaller profit, if prices
are cut, but there may be a loss.
The amount of profit or loss will
depend on the accuracy of the es
timate. Fn any event new prices,
to wipe out the reduced profit or
to recoup the loss, will be re
quired. This would involve con
tinual re-marking of goods, an
even more laborious process than
keeping account of rebates.
"The only workable plan for con
ducting a business is to set prices
