Questioned last night on their
opinions of a rule against smoking
during examinations, which has
been set before the Ex Committee
at the instigation of both the men's
and v/omen's councils, several cam
pus leaders added varied opinions
to those already expressed:
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. presi
dent: "There will be a round table
conference on Wednesday of next
week to give all those who are in
terested in the subject a chance to
outline their views. It seems to me
(hat the whole question depends on
two things: How many are really
bothered by the smoking in exam
ination and how strong the tradi
tion against smoking on the quad
really is. We all know that Mi's.
Stanford was against smoking, but
?he never wrote down any restric
tion of smoking privileges."
Annalcc Whitmore: "Non-smok
ing has been an unobserved tradi
tion for so long that it's time Ex
Committee did something about it.
Men's and Women's Council can en
force a ruling if they have one to
enforce, but not unless. So many
people have complained about the
smoke-filled rooms that there must
be genuine feeling against it. It is
easy enough for those who want to
smoke to go outside. If Stanford had
a perfect ventilation system this
probably wouldn't be necessary."
Kd Littlefield, interfraternity pres
ident "Smoking does not bother me,
but if it is annoying to others it
should be cut out."
Bob Eiscnbach, writer of Bull
Session: "As far as individual com
plaints are concerned, people go to
dances where the air is much smok
ier than it ever is in examination
rooms and s'et they enjoy them
selves. We had better make up our
minds whether we are doing it for
Mrs. Stanford, or to protect our low
insurance rates."
George Veness, passer-by: "Per
sonally, I believe that if we are to
acknowledge a tradition of no smok
ing on Quad, we should observe it
to the utmost. If students wish to
smoke during an examination, they
can go outside for that purpose and
then return."

Two hundred thousand persons
visit the health resorts of Czecho
slovakia every year.
