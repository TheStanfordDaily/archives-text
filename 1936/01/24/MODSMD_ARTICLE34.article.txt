The worm turned on Gordy
Davis, campus traffic officer, when
Gordy became the recipient of a
tag for overtime parking.
The citation was neatly placed
on the familiar black-and-white
Davis car when he returned to it
from a Palo Alto hank. The ticket
called for his appearance before
Men's Council, and was signed by
Bob Gros, president of the Council.
