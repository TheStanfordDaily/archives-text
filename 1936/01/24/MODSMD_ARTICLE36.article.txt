# New Dramatic Head Proves Versatile
## 
### Suzanne Hammond 
Dr. John Earle Uhler, new direc
tor of Stanford dramatics, brings
both versatility and much previous
dramatic experience to Stanford
from his former position at Loui
siana State University. As well as
directing the Little Theater at that
school for seven years, he acted on
the professional stage during sum
mer vacations, working with such
well known actors as Douglass
Montgomery, Kenneth MacKenna,
and Mary Boland.
While still an undergraduate,
Dr. Uhler worked on a newspaper
both as a reporter and a copy
reader, but after obtaining his
Ph.D. degree from Johns Hop
kins he continued to teach at that
university, although his chief in
terest has always been in drama
and the theater.
He has had several works pub
lished, including articles in both
academic and popular magazines;
several novels of which the most
successful was "Cane Juice," a story
of the people of southern Louisiana;
numerous one-act plays, which
have been presented in Little The

aters, and colleges; and several
texts on American and European
drama.
Among other things, Dr. Uhler is
a philatelist specializing in Amer
ican stamps, and one of his favorite
hobbies is fishing, spending much of
his leisure time tarpon-fishing in the
Gulf of Mexico with his two sons.
He has found that the interest in
drama in this part of the country
is much keener than in other lo
calities, and the work on the whole
is very good. With regard to the
New Theater, he says that the per
sons who had to do with its under
taking showed great foresight and
should he congratulated, since it
will be a great opportunity for
young men and women on the
Pacific Coast.
He believes that Stanford should
become in a very short time the hub
of dramatic interest west of the
Mississippi if not the Alleghanies,
and says that Stanford will produce
in the next 20 years a relatively
largo number of playwrights and
actors of national l-eputation.

Excavations near Molndal, Swed

In 1933 more than $11,000,000

Dr. John Earle Uhler, new direc
tor of Stanford dramatics, brings
both versatility and much previous
dramatic experience to Stanford
from his former position at Loui
siana State University. As well as
directing the Little Theater at that
school for seven years, he acted on
the professional stage during sum
mer vacations, working with such
well known actors as Douglass
Montgomery, Kenneth MacKenna,
and Mary Boland.
While still an undergraduate,
Dr. Uhler worked on a newspaper
both as a reporter and a copy
reader, but after obtaining his
Ph.D. degree from Johns Hop
kins he continued to teach at that
university, although his chief in
terest has always been in drama
and the theater.
He has had several works pub
lished, including articles in both
academic and popular magazines;
several novels of which the most
successful was "Cane Juice," a story
of the people of southern Louisiana;
numerous one-act plays, which
have been presented in Little The

aters, and colleges; and several
texts on American and European
drama.
Among other things, Dr. Uhler is
a philatelist specializing in Amer
ican stamps, and one of his favorite
hobbies is fishing, spending much of
his leisure time tarpon-fishing in the
Gulf of Mexico with his two sons.
He has found that the interest in
drama in this part of the country
is much keener than in other lo
calities, and the work on the whole
is very good. With regard to the
New Theater, he says that the per
sons who had to do with its under
taking showed great foresight and
should he congratulated, since it
will be a great opportunity for
young men and women on the
Pacific Coast.
He believes that Stanford should
become in a very short time the hub
of dramatic interest west of the
Mississippi if not the Alleghanies,
and says that Stanford will produce
in the next 20 years a relatively
largo number of playwrights and
actors of national l-eputation.
