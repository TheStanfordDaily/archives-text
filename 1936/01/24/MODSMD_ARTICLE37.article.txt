# Frosh Hoopsters Face Tough Week-End Battles
## "Victory March" May Stop Before Stockton Tarzans Stanford "Coasters" Will Have To Play! Best Game To Defeat Classy Valleymen 
### Roger Kimball 
Not hard-pressed since a trip during Christmas vacation, Stanford's
freshman basketball team may have a little trouble when Itabbit Brad
shaw's outfit meets Piedmont High School in the Pavilion tonight and
Stockton High tomorrow night. Both games will start at 6:30 o'clock as
preliminaries to Indian-Trojan varsity contests.

Once more, though, the frosh rule
as decided favorites. Six high
school and junior college teams have
met them on the Farm, only to be
defeated by big scores. None of
these opponents have forced the
yearlings to play the basketball of
which they are probably capable.
May Threaten Record
Piedmont and Stockton may
threaten the '39 record, unless Brad
shaw's hoopsters are better than
they were in their last two games.
In defeating Marin Junior College,
39 to 19, and the Salinas jaysees by
36-9, the frosh five played spotty
ball, coasting to easy victories only
because the opposition was as
ragged as a lower-classman's shirt
after the mudfiglit.
With a new coach, the Piedmont
Highlanders are an uncertain quan
tity. They have usually had tall,
fast teams, cften winning the title
in Alameda County . Several Card
varsity stars, including Hal Edelen,
captain two years ago, and Howell
Turner, high-scoring forward on
John Bunn's '36 team, have come to
Stanford from Piedmont.
Stockton the "Class"
Stockton High's Tarzans, coached
by Pete Lenz, have been the class
of valley prep teams almost every
year, this season not excepted. The
Stockton five will probably give the
frosh more strenuous opposition
than Piedmont, and have a better
chance of victory because Brad
shaw's men are likely to play a bet
ter game tonight. They usually have
been a "Friday team." Most notable
example was last week-end, when
they buried Berkeley High under a
54-27 score, playing their best game
of the season.
The yearlings concentrated on
shooting in practice yesterday.
Countless misses against Salinas
Wednesday night prompted this
drill. Free throws were also stressed.
The session was mainly individual,
wilh no team scrimmage.
Usual Starting Line-up
Bradshaw will start his usual line
up in both games, substituting freely
only if his team gains a command
ing lead. Since Piedmont and Stock
ton are both stronger than most of
the high school and J.C. clubs that
have appeared in the Pavilion this
season, the '39ers may have to work
for that lead.
"Lymie" Calkins and Jack Kessel
will open the game at forwards, with
Phil Zonne at center and Pete Mc-
Arthur and Dick Neeley at guards.
