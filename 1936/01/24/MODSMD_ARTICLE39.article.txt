WINDING UP
OUR RUGBY TALK
By way of cleaning up various |
and sundry rugby explanations we j
today discuss the backs, line-out, j
and penalties.
The backs will line up as indicated j
below behind the scrum:
Scrum
A
F B
C
D
E
G
A is the halfback; Bis the first
five; Cis the second five; D is the
center three-quarters; E is the right
wing three-quarters; F Is the left
v/ing ihree-quarters; and G is the j
fullback.
In rugby as it should he played, j
the ball will be heeled back i
through the scrum by the front 1
and second rankers, appear out of
a tangle of legs before the half
back, who picks it up and whips
it to the first five. It travels out
to the wing, who attempts to
score or kick the ball into scoring
position.
Here is the low down on the line
out. This is one of the finest parts :
of rugby and called when the ball j
has gone out of bounds. One man j
stands on the sidelines and tosses
in the ball to the other members of
ihe scrum who are lined facing him,
parallel across the field.
Forwards jump for the pass and j
either send it to their backfield, put
it at their feet and form an informal j
scrum, or take it with them and at- >
tempt to form a dribbling rush.
PENALTIES—THEY'D FILL
A VOLUME
Probably the most frequent and
the most difficult penalty to under
stand is the offside rule, which we
think would take a small volume to
properly explain. In brief, when a
member of one team kicks the ball
all his teammates are offside, except
those between him and his own goal.
A player offside may not tackle an
opponent, or retrieve the ball until
lie is put onside, which may be done
as follows:
(a) By the player who kicked
the ball running up the field to
where the ball has advanced.
(b) By the ball's touching a
member of the opposing team and
being fumbled.
(c)By an opposing player's
running five yards with the ball.
(d) By being 10 yards away
from the opponent when he re
ceives the ball; the player may
then rush in 10 yards and tackle
the receiver.
A player behind one of his ,
teammates who is carrying the ball
is always onside. As far as we know,
the above is correct, although Dink
Templeton or Harry Maloney may

find loopholes in the statements. It
is sufficient, though, for ihe aver
age spectator.
Holding onto the ball after being
tackled, if the runner is froe to drop
it, is a serious offense and is
for a penally kick. The same applies
to picking ball up with ihe hands
in a scrum. The latter i.s a favorite
trick of inexperienced front rank
ers, and if the referee overlooks it,
it means trouble for the opposing
scrum.
Don't worry about any other
penalties; wc ran think of no
more at the moment and if the
referee calls them, probably even
the players won't understand
what they're for.
So ends all explanations for
the year 1936. —Frost
