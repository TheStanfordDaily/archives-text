## 
### 
While Stanford and U.S.C. are
! fighting for leadership of the south
j ern division basketball race this
week-end. California will try to get
out of last place at the expense of
the Bruins in Los Angeles.
John Bunn's Indians must win j
both Trojan tussles in order to j
gain the top spot and become the j
"team to beat." If the Bears and
U.C.L.A. split victories tonight and
tomorrow, they will kill each
other off, but either team could J
stay in the running by defeating
the other twice. U.C.L.A. rules
as a slight favorite.
In the northern division, Oregon
faces its big test against the Wash
ington Huskies in two* important
games at Seattle. The results of
ihese tilts should reveal the probable
champions oi the Pacific Northwest.
The Webieet boast a perfect con
ference record, having trounced 1
Idaho twice and Oregon State in the 1

first of their "big series" last week
end.
Washington, however, has a dan
gerous team, led by Galer, sharp
shooting forward, and has always
been a jinx for Oregon on the Hus
j ky court.
j Ilec Fdmundson's men, tradit
j ional champions or runners-up
in the northern division, started
j strongly by defeating Washing-
State and Idaho. Still undefeated,
1 the Huskies could get the inside
track on the road to another crown
by downing Oregon twice.
At the same time, Oregon State
and Idaho tangle at Moscow, but
with much less at stake. The Beav
ers are third in the northern sec
tion, and unlikely to rise higher.
Idaho has lost all four of its games,
but cjuld replace Washington Slate
in the fourth position by taking both
! games from the Corvallis aggrega
-1 tion.
