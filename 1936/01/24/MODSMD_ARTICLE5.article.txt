### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 23 (/Pi.â€”The
New York Post says Alfred E. Smith,
in his address at the American Lib
erty League dinner in Washington
next Saturday, is expected to de
mand that the Democratic party re
affirm its 1D32 platform and nomi
nate a candidate for President
pledged to carry out the provisions
of this platform.
"His friends best qualified to
know." the Post continues, "be
lieve he may even go so far . . .
as to attemcpt to read President
Roosevelt out of the party, amaz
ing as such a tiling would be.
"There is no doubt in the minds of
Mr. Smith's intimate friends that he
will insist the Roosevelt Administra
tion has departed from the precepts
of the 1932 platform and will cite
chapter and verse in an attempt to
prove his argument.
