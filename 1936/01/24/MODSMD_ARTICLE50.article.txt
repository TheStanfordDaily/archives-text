# Interclass Stars Will Paddle Tomorrow
## All-American Swimmers, Divers Compete for Class Honors in Encina Pools 
### 
Competition should run liigli tomorrow afternoon when Coach Nort
Thornton's Indian mermen gather at Encina Pools to participate in the
annual Intcrclass swimming meet.
.Flashy performances are expected from three Ail-Americans, a former
world champion, and a junior national title holder who will vie for honors.

The contest, to which admission is
free, will begin at 2 o'clock with the
440 yard free style event. The en
tire program, including seven other
races and exhibitions, is replete with
the names of talented mermen.
Heading the array of talent will
he Don Towne, freshman ace.
Towne was an All-American sel
ection in high school, but his real
prowess was discovered only re
cently on the Farm. .Within the
past two weeks lie has bettered
the American records for both the
5!) yard and ."><) meter breast stroke
events. Towne, in ;t third try for
honors, dangerously threatened
(he world's fastest time for 100
yards.
Among other outstanding perfor
mers will be Winfred Needham,
frosh star and Junior National' title
holder in the 500 yard free style;
Roy Winktlman, All-American In
terseholastic diver; Henry Godman,
varsity sprint flash and 1934 All-
American Intercollegiate selection;
Bob Walker, varsity back stroker
and former wearer of the world 400
meter crown; and Jack Vibert, Pa
cific Coast 100 meter champ.
The battle for team honors will
doubtlessly prove a tight con
test between the juniors and the
frosh. The juniors are defending
titlists, having claimed top honors
last year as sophu while the
yearlings, with their three aces,
should make a serious bid for the
title.
In Coach Thornton's opinion, the
200 yard breast stroke race should
be taken quite handily by Towne.
Bob Walker looks the strongest in
the 150 yard back stroke. Scatena,
MacKenzie, and Lhamon should
stage a thrilling battle in the 50
yard free style, while the 100 yard
free style should develop into a
duel between Godman and Kuhn.
Duncan, Towne, and Clarke com
prise the frosh trio that is favored to
eclipse the local 300 yard medley
relay record. Needham will tangle
first with Vibert in the 220 yard free

j style and then with Peterson in the
J 440; fast times should result in both
j events. A diving exhibition will
feature Boothe, of the varsity, and
Winkelman.
