# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Workable Suggestions for Disbursing Of Bookstore Profits Still in Order

When the question of whut to do with
Booksto e profits arose, student reaction
seemed to he "(ait tlie prices lirst; then worry
about the profits."
Cutting prices in tlie Bookstore, as might
have been suspected, is not all a bed of roses.
Bookstore's president, Professor Lesley, in an
adjoining column points out that because of
the difficulty of estimating profits in advance,
price-cutting as a means of reducing them is
not feasible.
According to its heads, Bookstore is slated
for only an estimated two per cent prolit this
year, which seems only a fair, workable mar
gin. Moreover, it appears likely that rising
wholesale prices may lessen, not increase, the
profit margin.
Vet Bookstore directors have no especial

distaste for price-cutting in principle; they
are perfectly willing to give the students a
break if practical. After all, it is not to be
decried that they arc interested in the practi
cal side of Bookstore management.
H.C.T. in his Vox Campi of two weeks ago
suggested lowering rates on paper as an easy
way of giving customers cut prices. Mr. Les
ley admits the feasibility of this suggestion,
; and today says that it "could" be done if
| profits go above "a sale margin."
The time is propitious for further "gripes"
against the Bookstore while the question is
open and while Professor Lesley is consid
erately engaged in taking time from his pro
fessorial duties to mull over student ques
tions for possible workable suggestions and
J for explanation in his Daily series.
