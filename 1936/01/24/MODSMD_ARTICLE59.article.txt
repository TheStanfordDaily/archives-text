# Poor Support: Is It Laziness or the Expense
## 
### 
Less than 500 students—or slightly fewer
than last year's number —purchased rooters'
tickets for basketball games tonight or to
morrow with Southern California.
The lack of support in 1935, though not
necessarily creditable, can be explained by
the fact that Stanford had an only-average
team, and the U.S.C. games had little effect
on the Conference standings. Considering,
however, that this week-end's series either
may establish Stanford its a championship
threat or virtually kill the Indians' title hopes,
this year's disinterest is more dillicult to un
derstand.
Students apparently will not obligate a pair
of week-end nights as much as two days in
advance —they seem to figure a last-minute
chance to go dancing Friday makes the pur
chase of SO cents worth of basketball tickets
on Wednesday a poor investment. Further
more, the 40-cent levy is a bit steep for the
working classes among Stanford's Houghs.
When the U.A.C. becomes aware of these twin
facts, a more satisfactory arrangement for the
sale of rooters' tickets may develop.
