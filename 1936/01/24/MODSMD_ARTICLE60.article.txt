Briefly, it is that, despite the olt-heard-of

ward anything not scholastic or social, the

rate.

particular type of unimportant monkey-
I business can be made interesting enough to
! get students out of their mental burrows, all
| that remains is to lind some way of sugar
| coating Tuesday evening lectures and the like
to make them equally palatable.
