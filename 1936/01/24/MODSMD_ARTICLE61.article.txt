lIANOS AND FiSET— AGAIN
A friend ol j.y.r:, who spends much time debating
the social peculiarities of the Genus Stanforditae takes
exception to this Bui? Rersioner's belief that Farm
maids are a pretty it it hi noil of gals, <;idvt.)
"Not only are they s «!ly inept, 1 he screams, "but
they are g rare less, unady, 1 totally lacking in a
knowledge of how to fix theses a. d thoses for maxi
mum stunning effect.'
Given to clinical analysis, he cites facts supporting
his views, among them circus make-up, Maaome Fro
chard head-dresses, ill-fitting fweaters, and duck-in
the-mud walks.
* * # *
Not contesting the marvels of allurement-science,
he does contest the Stanford co-ed's employment of it,
and would have a school teaching covering-bare-facts,
as well as one teaching covering-bare-personalities.
m * *
Perhaps our friend is foolishly charitable. He as
sumes that every feminine ground-work has undis
covered possibilities, which, if developed, would make
each individual gal a beautilully-finished product.
Actually, science can do just so much. And because
one gal is not quite so v/ell-tuvned-out as another may
quite logically be duo not so much to her lack of
mirage-engineering, as to natural handicaps.
* * * *
Those natural handicaps, moreover, can be many
things besides the face and figure doled out by Nature.
Among them are daylight that shows up the complex
ion, co-ed street clothes, designed on the false assump
tion that a natural figure is thire, currently stylish
hats making a round face lunar, and a long face horse
like.
♦ * * *
Indeed, our friend's objections and recommenda
tions may seemingly hold w< ier during the merciless
day, but they are totally disproved at any formal dance
you care to attend. For without searching sunlight,
without the figure-revealing accoutrements dictated
for day wear, the co-ed can work a scientific trans
formation that not only judiciously reveals, but delight
fully surprises.
* # » *
Very probably every woman knows that lip
sticking is lithography during the day but half-toning
at night; that hair may look like adobe under the
noon-day sun but spun under ballroom dimmers.
Because nature abhorj artifice and refuses co-opera
tion during the waking hours is no reason that the
co-ed in question has the wrong technique.
Any pug-ugly at any well-managed dance is the
proof of the Max Factor pudding: that given a con
trollable environment, the variables will very largely
take care of themselves.

noon-day sun but spun under ballroom dimmers.
Because nature abhorj artifice and refuses co-opera
tion during the waking hours is no reason that the
co-ed in question has the wrong technique.
Any pug-ugly at any well-managed dance is the
proof of the Max Factor pudding: that given a con
trollable environment, the variables will very largely
take care of themselves.

each individual gal a beautilully-finished product.
Actually, science can do just so much. And because
one gal is not quite so v/ell-tuvned-out as another may
quite logically be duo not so much to her lack of
mirage-engineering, as to natural handicaps.

Those natural handicaps, moreover, can be many
things besides the face and figure doled out by Nature.
Among them are daylight that shows up the complex

hats making a round face lunar, and a long face horse

Indeed, our friend's objections and recommenda

day, but they are totally disproved at any formal dance
you care to attend. For without searching sunlight,
without the figure-revealing accoutrements dictated
for day wear, the co-ed can work a scientific trans
formation that not only judiciously reveals, but delight
fully surprises.

Very probably every woman knows that lip
