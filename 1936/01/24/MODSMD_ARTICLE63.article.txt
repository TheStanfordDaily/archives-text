For years many Stanford students have attended
the Rose Bowl Game in tuxes, too busy and too nebu
lous to change their attire of the night preceding, but
| no one has championed the idea of wearing tuxes to
| the basketball games. This would save the trouble for
i the boys going to the Cotillion, and also lend a certain
j "tone" to the affair. Oniy things such as this will
i make Stanford the Harvard of the West.
Hashers, of cawhse, will appear in snack-cloth and
I hashes.
A near-riot was caused one year when a sorority
suggested that its hashers wear tuxes for rushing.
I After the merry battle was settled with the hashers
! valiantly holding the fort, somebody discovered that
j it was against Pan-Hell rules,
i
You know, stooges, you can find good in almost
anything.
Those of my faithful stooges who hang on every
one of my words and gag on every one of my "jokes"
may remember a story about a certain hero from
Weedpatch, Calif., who registered from a different town
every quarter.
Here is a sequel to it.
This hero goes by the very, very funny name of
Jim Copp, and such were his predilections that he
wanted (o register from a funny town, too. He tried
'*Lo.s Angeles," the first quarter, but people only smiled
in a knowing way. So he tried a dinger the next time.
' He closed his eyes and poked with a pin on Mercator's
projection. The first punch landed him in Yountville.
The second pinch landed him in the Four Square Gos
pel Tabernacle of Sioux City., lowa. With a tremendous
lunge on the third day he whipped across one ocean,
several seas, two bugs in a rug, and landed in Shaikh.
Shuaib, Persia. This was good enough for anybody,
Copp decided, so liter hi.s plussage in the Bawlout
there appeared that quarter the magic name of the
Persian town.
But Copp took sick. Deathly sick. After a hurried
consultation, the administration treated him Lo a week
on Ihe Hospital Fund. And the Administration didn't
know v/hom to notify in ca. e e of illness. Copp mur
mured something about a Jabbci wock with slithy toves
who gargled Listerino, but the administration couldn't
find that one on the map.
After several weeks of it he got well, ridded him
self of the place, and put behuid him the thoughts of
the infirmary. The next summer his father asked him
if the sickness was really on the house, because no
bill had arrived. But it did, finally. Yes, it did. From
the rug-beating bill-beating country of Persia came
the dun, direct to Mr. Copp in Los Angeles. And on
it were marks, labels, and stamps that even Mr. Farley
had never heard of.
Such are the wonders of organization.
