# STANFORD MEN—PHOO
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To Mr. Eisenbach: I gather from j
your column on Januarv 22 that;
you think your line and that of all j
Stanford men is darned near per- !
feet. Now I haven't had a date with
you, but I have been around in my ;
J small way, and the technique of
most of the Stanford men I've been i
out with was very messy.
As conversationalists, I'll grant j
( you, the average is not bad among'
I the men, although some of them are |
j awful cats. I don't mind a kiss now
! and then. It's all right with me if a
man has a couple of cocktails, but I
want him to know how to hold his
liquor.
There is nothing as disillusioning 1
to love's young dream as having the
! man of the hour belch at odd mo
'■ ments. And when they go so far as
! to get sick—ugh! In other words, I
| find a good many instances where
J Stanford men, God's gifts to women,
; show distinct signs of still being
damp behind the ears.
Now don't misunderstand me. I j
; think (he student body as a whole is |
, tops. The majority of so-called
"students" are healthy young ani
; mals and shew the results of some
i very fancy breeding.
I do think that Stanford, as a cul
tural institution, could do a lot to
improve the polish of her inmates. !
The sororities and fraternities, to
justify their existence, should carry |
jon some such program of social
education. So far they seem to be
; nil.
In some colleges such as Oberlin ,
j the system of having mixed dining
rooms for those who prefer them has
proved very satisfactory. I would
suggest required dancing classes
I for both sexes—they put the West
Point lads through a stiff course in
the art and you would be surprised
; what nice results they produce.
I admit that the above ideas arc
I not in keeping with the Stanford
atmosphere as it now stands, but
| whether we like it or not, our be
loved University is in a period of
i transition. You are helping to mold
; the Stanford of the future. Please—! ,
Susan
Good stuff, lady.—Ed.
