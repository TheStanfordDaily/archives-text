The Editor, Sir:
People with red hair are not ade
quately represented on the govern
ing body of this noble institution of
higher learning. Let us put an end
j to this blonde-brunette era of
bloated despotism. Sophomores,
| juniors, seniors, graduates, ath
j letes-at-large, and WOMEN, all
have their staunch pillars of Amer
ican Democracy to prevent their be
ing ground into the dust of insignifi
cance under the iron-shod heel of
the Rally Committee. (Fanfare.)
Meanwhile the tition (red-haired
club members must of necessity bow
to the curse oi" their birth and allow
their more fortunate brothers to
guide the ship of state.
In all seriousness, if the Ex Com
mittee were selected from groups of

tall people and short people, these
factions would be no more artificial
| than the present classes of '36, '37,
and '38.
i The amendment to the A.S.S.U.
; Constitution which is to be dis
cussed at the next student panel,

i proposes to choose the members of
Ex Committee from natural, able
groups of students who are inter
ested and well-informed on student
I affairs. Dick Creamer
