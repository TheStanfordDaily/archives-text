# Reviewer's Bawl-Out
## "I DREAM TOO MUCH" 
### 
At the* Stanford
A The magnificent range of
Lily Pons' voice was so
poorly recorded in heri
opening number, "Caro |
Nome," that this reviewer feared she I
would have to agree with punsters ;
that the picture should have been i
called "I Scream Too Much." Subse- i
quent songs, however, a delightful
story, and Henry Fonda soon allayed
such fears, and diminutive diva Pons j
promises to equal Grace Moore's i
success as a cinema-songstress.
