# Daily's Injun Named Chief Little Swampum
## 
### 
Ilail to the winnah!
Arise, Injun, from your nameless grave, Stanford students dub you
BIG CHIEF LITTLE SWAMPUM. And why? Simply because You're
used to boggari down your opponents.
Ten bucks, in real money, goes to Big Chief Bill Lhamon. of the Hos
pital Boys' Fund and the Chi Psi house, for winning The Daily's contest
to name the edit page brave. The brave has been pounding The Daily
Cartoons ever since Curtis Barnes first splattered him out from his ink
works.
Nine other contestants get cartons of Philip Morris cigarettes for
submitting high-ranking names. These are, in no particular order:

Little Chief Hot and Cold Running Water,
—he's not to be found in Encina. Fred Clark,
Delta Chi.
Little Pooey-Puss—he hasn't a pooey
puss in life. Martha June Lewis, Mariposa.
Sit and Bull—it is the one year-round
sport. James Vizzard, Firehouse.
Four Bits—he's only half a buck. Nor
man Clayton, Toyon.
Ugh Lee—because he represents the Stan
ford Roughs. ( Also submitter of Fauniwon—
because he has no doe, is forever passing
the buck, and is such a dear.) Margaret
Burdick, Oaks.
Boogie Boggan, or Barnic Boogie Boggan
—Veil, Vy Not? Charles Sufficld, Encina.

Little Swampum, because wampum is so valuable, and will there
fore be valuable to the "moral" of the whole school. Henry Godman,
Palo Alto. (This entry did not tie for winner, because the reason was
not so good.)
Little Chief Pacific-Bone-Coal-Fertilizer Company—he strongly sug
gests the Stanford Rushing System. Bob Garred, Phi Sig.
Little Chief Smoke-up—because he's a cinch. Dave Nusbickel, D.U.
Expecting the usual number of beeves and gripes, the editor* finally

Frit upon the winning name after a sleepless night of weeding through
such pretties as Pilford, Dippiwatha. Little Mushmouth (because lie
has such a large, aquiline nose), the Mowgli name, which was always
a threat, and Blubber-puss.
By the time the judges got to Pooey-ptiss, and Barnie Boogie Bog
gan, the hell had rung, and Swampum appeared the only name that
could save the Republic.
Barnes reluctantly admitted that "there was something about' it.''
I'.drtor Jones granted that "there was a certain swing to it," and Our
Hasher plainly said that "it kind of grows on you after a while."
Some of the contestants hit upon similar names. There were three
submitters of Little Tomahawk (because of Stanford ticket-scalpers),
and two submitted Little Smoke-up (but Nlisbickcl got the carton be
cause of a better reason).
Offending the judges' sense of propriety were several suggestions.
One was Chief Safety Pin, because he upholds the Stanford honor.
Many of those who sought prizes wrote on fancy stationery, some
tried to be coy, while tike winner's was sent in on a plain piece of ragged
scratch paper. One student made a play to ■ the gallery by signing,
"Yours for a bigger and better Daily."
