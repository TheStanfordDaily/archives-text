Also at the Stanford
BThe sccond-featurish sound
of this picture's title is very
misleading, for it is decidedly
not an "also-ran." With a
little cutting 10 shorten some of the
tedious scones and the omission of
a ridiculous police escort of that
ancient and excellent actress, Ali
son Skipworth, toward the end of
the picture, it would have been an
A-l production. As it is, it is an
amusing comedy, so don't walk out
after Lily Pons. You'll like this, too.
