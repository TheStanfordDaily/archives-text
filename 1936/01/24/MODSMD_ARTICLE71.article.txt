TIIE CHRONICLE, as most of
you know, scored a signal beat 011
the Ann Cooper Hewitt steriliza
tion story. Here, briefly, is how it
happened:
John G. Robinson, city editor, re
ceived a tip on the story Saturday
afternoon. January 4. He set Harry
Lerner on the story.
The trail led to Russell P. Tyler,
Miss Hewitt's attorney. But Tyler
was a boon companion of John Fran
cis Neylan, Hearst's counsel. Rob
inson talked to Tyler "until the
sweat just poured off me," he said,
pointing out that the Chronicle had
dug up the story first and was en
titled to the beat.
At 3 p.m. Sunday, Tyler capitu
lated and gave the Chronicle the de
tails. The story'was saved for the
6 a.m. Monday edition. No extraor
dinary precautions, such as locked
doors, were token, for fear of arous
ing suspicions. At 3 a.m. Monday
the s:tory was turned over to the
Associated Press for release on east
ern circuits only, and when the G
a.m.'s came out, the Chronicle car
ried its copyrighted story, the only
one on the Coast.
"PRIVATE LIVES," the current
Palo Alto Community Playhouse at
traction, opened last night for a
three-day run, but the Reviewer
was unable to attend. However,
from previous acquaintance with the

work of most of those concerncd, he
will bet that tonight's and tomor
row night's repeat performances will
be worth seeing.
