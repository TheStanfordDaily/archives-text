# Wins Over Troy Paint Title Picture for Indians
## Stanford Five Takes Lead In Conference California Quits Cellar, Beating Uclans Twice 
### 
| Two victories each for Stanford
and California basketball teams over
i southern quintets in week-end
j games resulted in two changes in
southern division conference stand
ings.
John Dunn's Indians took first
, place from the Trojans by trouncing
1 them twice, 32-25 and 51-47. At the
same time, the Golden Bears snap
j ped out of a slump to take the

I measure of a crippled U.C.L.A. five,
! 35-33 and 30-26, and shove the
j Bruins into the cellar.
Stanford now rates at least an
even chance to win the cham
pionship, even though five of her
| six remaining conference games
will be played on foreign courts.
The Cards lead U.S.C. by a full
game, and the Trojans must play
I California twice in Berkeley, and
the Bruins three more times.
U.C.L.A. has knocked Troy out of
! »he leadership several times in re
cent years, enabling the Bears to
win. This time the Bruins may do
j Stanford a good turn in the same
; way.
California ended any champion
ship hopes the Bruins might have
had in those two close games at Los
Angeles. The Bears, who had lost
i twice to the Trojans and once to the
| Indians, were out of the running
themselves, and will now fight it
out with U.C.L.A. for third place.
Defeating the previously un
beaten Oregon quintet twice at
| Seattle, Washington once more went
i out in front in the northern division
race. The "jinx of the Puget
Sound" was too much for the Web
feet, to the tune of 36-28 and 40-26.
A game and a half behind, Oregon
i now has only an outside chance of
winning the crown.
The Eugene outfit sank to third
1 place over the week-end, since Ore
gon State took the measure of Idaho
twice, by margins of 22-21 and 33-
22. Washington State, idle, re
mained in the fourth spot.

| Two victories each for Stanford
and California basketball teams over
i southern quintets in week-end
j games resulted in two changes in
southern division conference stand
ings.
John Dunn's Indians took first
, place from the Trojans by trouncing
1 them twice, 32-25 and 51-47. At the
same time, the Golden Bears snap
j ped out of a slump to take the

I measure of a crippled U.C.L.A. five,
! 35-33 and 30-26, and shove the
j Bruins into the cellar.
Stanford now rates at least an
even chance to win the cham
pionship, even though five of her
| six remaining conference games
will be played on foreign courts.
The Cards lead U.S.C. by a full
game, and the Trojans must play
I California twice in Berkeley, and
the Bruins three more times.
U.C.L.A. has knocked Troy out of
! »he leadership several times in re
cent years, enabling the Bears to
win. This time the Bruins may do
j Stanford a good turn in the same
; way.
California ended any champion
ship hopes the Bruins might have
had in those two close games at Los
Angeles. The Bears, who had lost
i twice to the Trojans and once to the
| Indians, were out of the running
themselves, and will now fight it
out with U.C.L.A. for third place.
Defeating the previously un
beaten Oregon quintet twice at
| Seattle, Washington once more went
i out in front in the northern division
race. The "jinx of the Puget
Sound" was too much for the Web
feet, to the tune of 36-28 and 40-26.
A game and a half behind, Oregon
i now has only an outside chance of
winning the crown.
