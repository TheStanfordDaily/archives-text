James Ludlam, election commit
tee chairman: "I think rushing is
inherently bad. However, I believe
that it can be corrected to a certain
extent. Rushing should be limited
to the fall quarter, and the enter
tainment should be in the form of
open house rather than the formal
dinners now in effect. With the for
mality omitted the freshmen would
have a real chance to get acquainted
with the fellows in the respective
houses."
Earl Fidanquc, freshman: "Al
though I don't know an awful lot
about the rushing system, I feel
there could be some revisions to it,
and I strongly believe that in the
case of illegal rushing one house
should not be penalized any more
than the others involved."
Jane Dodge, Daily women's edi
tor: "The rushing system is ob
viously inadequate, but in order to
preserve the unity of the dormitory,
I do not see how we can get away
from deferred rushing. It might be
possible that illegal rushing could
be done away with, if fraternities
and sororities would decide on a
definite date in the fall quarter to
take their pledges and insist on
their continuing to be active in the
hall during their entire freshman
year."
Knrhara Itcinliardt, freshman
woman: "With the present rushing
system freshman women are at the
most in contact with the Row women
six times. In order that a better
friendship may be made, illegal
rushing evolves, and the present sys
tem is proved unsuccessful. I feel
that if the Hall girl were given di
rect contact with sorority girls, her
choice would be more natural than
the one that stilted formality now
forces upon her."
