The Townsend Plan has come to
stay!—and O. A. Petree has also.
Mr. Petree has become quite a per
manent feature around the campus
trying to convince the student body
that his plan will bring back pros
perity, maintain capitalism, and
cause the incentive to furnish the
purchasing power which in turn will
step up production.
Last year it was Encina, inter
mittently his efforts have centered
on the Daily editor, but yesterday
the Palo Alto photographer stirred a
large crowd at the Library, where
he parried questions with a few
seemingly interested students. Al
though Petree evaded all questions
put to him concerning the transac
tion tax, he could not avoid the pen
nies and cigars that were poked at
him by students, he said, "who had
their minds made up, but couldn't
sober up and keep quiet in order
to learn something."
Phil Coghlatl, Rally Committee
chairman, was one of the most ar
dent questioners, but neither de
bater made progress owing to the
jangling and harassing by the
other spectators.
About 100 students stared up at
this martyr to the Townsend Plan
as he stood gesticulating, perched
upon the summit, of the Library
steps. "I was surprised to see so
many ladies," said when
exclusively interviewed last night
after he returned from church.
