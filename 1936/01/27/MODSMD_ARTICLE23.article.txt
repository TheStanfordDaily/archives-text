# Hank Luisetti Drives Team To Victories
## Ragged First Half Play Hinders Coach Bunn's Squad in Both Games 
### 
Hobbling Angelo Luisetti, sopho
more forward, drove a Stanford
basketball team to two sensational
eomeback victories over the Trojan
varsity and the undisputed con
ference lead with the greatest "mon
ey players'" performance ever seen
in the Encina gymnasium, during
the week-end's hoop tilts.
The Indian's 32-25 and 51-47 wins
were matched in the South by two
California victories over U.C.L.A.
thereby making the California-Stan
ford game of this coming Friday a
crucial meeting of the oncoming
Bears and the top position Cards,
who won by only four points in the
last meeting of the two teams.

Luisetti's key performance in the
two wins over the Trojans were all
the more remarkable for the badly
sprained ankle which prevented the
Indian ace from showing his usual
underbucket play. They were re
markable as far as the whole team
was concerned because the Stanford
team spotted their opponents to
considerable advantage with rag
ged play in both first periods and
then came back with the clicking
play in the closing minutes.
In Friday night's game the In
dians were down four points as
the final period opened. Quick
buckets by Luisetti, Howell Tur
ner, and Jack Calderwood gave
the Indians a seven point lead
which they protected during the
remainder of the contest. Lui
setti's passing was potent but his
bum ankle prohibited the neces
sary jumping for set-up shots,
and the high scoring forward had
to be content with eight tallies.
Saturday night the Trojans were
a different team as forward Ward
Browning swished one-handers re
gularly from the foul line and for
ward Jerry Cracin tallied repeatedly
with follow-up shots. After a dull
and low scoring first half, the final
period opened with a flurry of
buckets which soon gave the visitors
I a 15 point lead.
Then Luisetti and team mates
I began to put on the pressure.
! Hank's easy shots had roiled out
| during the first hall, but they
j were dropping in from all angles
as (he great "money player"
j came through. Turner, Sparky
! Robertson, and Calderwood made
I the best ol their chances, and
j with five minutes to go the Cards
were down but three, 42-3!).
Luisetti added a bucket with a
follow shot, and Eddie Oram of
i the Trojans fouled him in the pro
i cess. Hank winked nonchalantly
| at frazzled Coach John Bunn as he
| cooly stepped to the free throw
! line for the shot that could tie the
j score. Ho swished it. A couple of
I free throws knotted it again a) 43
| all. Jack Hupp put the Trojans
into the lead with a one-hander.
Angelo matchcd it. With seconds
to go Luisetti r.wished two more
on passes from Robertson and
Calderwood for his twenty-third
point in twenty minutes and a 51 to
4 7 victory for the Indians, who are
through being kicked around the
conference hoop circut.
Eddie, the perennial follower of
Stanford athletic teams said all there
was to say, as Hoop-em-Hank's
nil important ankle was getting all
the care Stanford trainers could
give it in the semi-quiet of the
dressing loom afterwards. Said
Eddie: "That was one for the
books."

buckets by Luisetti, Howell Tur

the Indians a seven point lead
which they protected during the
remainder of the contest. Lui
setti's passing was potent but his
bum ankle prohibited the neces

and the high scoring forward had
to be content with eight tallies.
Saturday night the Trojans were
a different team as forward Ward
Browning swished one-handers re
gularly from the foul line and for
ward Jerry Cracin tallied repeatedly
with follow-up shots. After a dull
and low scoring first half, the final
period opened with a flurry of
buckets which soon gave the visitors
I a 15 point lead.

i the Trojans fouled him in the pro

point in twenty minutes and a 51 to
4 7 victory for the Indians, who are
through being kicked around the
conference hoop circut.
Eddie, the perennial follower of
Stanford athletic teams said all there
was to say, as Hoop-em-Hank's
nil important ankle was getting all
the care Stanford trainers could
give it in the semi-quiet of the
dressing loom afterwards. Said
Eddie: "That was one for the
books."
Hobbling Angelo Luisetti, sopho
more forward, drove a Stanford
basketball team to two sensational
eomeback victories over the Trojan
varsity and the undisputed con
ference lead with the greatest "mon
ey players'" performance ever seen
in the Encina gymnasium, during
the week-end's hoop tilts.
The Indian's 32-25 and 51-47 wins
were matched in the South by two
California victories over U.C.L.A.
thereby making the California-Stan
ford game of this coming Friday a
crucial meeting of the oncoming
Bears and the top position Cards,
who won by only four points in the
last meeting of the two teams.

Luisetti's key performance in the
two wins over the Trojans were all
the more remarkable for the badly
sprained ankle which prevented the
Indian ace from showing his usual
underbucket play. They were re
markable as far as the whole team
was concerned because the Stanford
team spotted their opponents to
considerable advantage with rag
ged play in both first periods and
then came back with the clicking
play in the closing minutes.
