# New Deal Ire Aroused By Smith Attack
## Reply Will Be Made By Senator Joe Robinson In Address Tomorrow 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2G (/P). â€”
New Deal bitterness over the barred
attack of Alfred E. Smith clearly
neared a battle point today, with
sporadic sniping already under way
and a concerted counter-attack set
for Tuesday.
The speech of the one-time
"Happy Warrior," swaying a re
sponsive American Liberty League
audience, nevertheless left a heavy
question mark over the capital.
Whether he would go beyond his
indicated intention of taking a
"walk" during the campaign and
actively work for a deep party
schism, or whether his position
alone would result in this end,
went without final answer.
There were arguments on both
sides. The first flush of reaction here
appeared to bear more heavily neg
ative than positive.
Ires New Deal
There was no question here, how
ever, about the depth of New Deal
ire. There was no question but that
Smith's charges of socialism, his snap
at "Washington or Moscow," and his
assertion that his erstwhile friend,
the President, had thrown most of
the 1932 Democratic platform "in
the wastebasket" would draw heavy
and continuing fire.
Senator Joe Kobinson of Arkan
sas. the majority leader, who went
down to defeat as Smith's run
ning mate against Herbert Hoover
in 11)28, closeted himself in his
Senate office today to prepare a
reply.
The Columbia Broadcasting Com
pany, which carried Smith's speech
last night, made known that even
before the New Yorker spoke the
Democratic National Committee had
arranged time for Robinson next
Tuesday night from 10:45 to 11:15
o'clock.
Refuses To Talk
Robinson's Hat refusal to say evf.n
a word about his feeling toward
Smith or his speech, despite per
sistent newspaper inquiries, ap
peared obviously storing up of his
ammunition.
