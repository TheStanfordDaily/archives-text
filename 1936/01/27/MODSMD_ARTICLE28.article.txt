# Dr. Brown Describes Illumination Laboratory
## 
### JIM HURST 
If you stroll over some day to the illumination laboratory across the
street from The Daily shack and ask Dr. Leland H. Brown to show you
some of his playthings, probably the first thing he'll do will be to pidl in
half a great gray steel sphere 10 feet in diameter.

This spherical photometer rests *
on a framework that has wheels |
and runs along a track. It is split!
vertically down the middle so that
it comes apart like the two halves !
of a grapefruit.
When he pulls the two halves [
apart you'll see that the sphere is
really just a hollow shell covered on
the inside with a brilliant white
paint which Dr. Brown says reflects
more than 95 per cent of the light j
that strikes it. From the top of the !
shell two steel rods hang down to
about the middle with regular light
sockets in the ends, painted white.
In the end of one of the halves there j
is a small round opening or window.
It is from this window that light
tests are made. A lamp ol' known
light output is placed in one of the
sockets and one to be tested in
the other. Then the sphere is
closed and one of the lamps turned
on. When the light gets through
bouncing hack and forth in the
sphere it is so evenly distributed
over the i/iside area that the light I
passing out the little window may I
be considered as representative of j
the light intensity at any point on
the shell.
By comparing the light from Ihe
lamp of known output with that
from the one of unknown output,
Dr. Brown can tell accurately what
the output of the second is relative
to (he first. This comparison may be
made either by the human eye or
with the photo-electric cell, or "elec
tric eye," as it is often called. The

latter, of course, makes the most ac
curate measurement.
But how, you ask, does Dr.
Brown know the output of the
standard lamp? Believe it or not,
even in this highly scientific age,
the final reference for quantities
of light is a little tallow candle of
a certain size and composition—
the "candle power." It is from
this that the Bureau of Standards
makes its measurements, and all
light standards are based on it.
The spherical photometer is only
one of the interesting things in Dr.
Brown's laboratory. He has a pen
dulum-like structure 20 feet high,
known as a distribution photometer.
It measures the light an ordinary
ceiling fixture would give at differ
ent levels in a room. There is also
a "life-iiester" which determines
how long a bulb will burn before it
burns out.
One of the most difficult prob
lems in light-testing work is that
sources of different colors can
not be accurately compared with
the eye, l)r. Brow 1 says. He is »(
present devoting a great deal of
his time to calibrating photo
electric cells for making this meas
urement. He did some practical
work along this line when he ran
tests for the neon signs to be
used on the bay bridge and its ap
proaches.
The primary purpose of Ih«* illum
ination laboratory is to provide in
struction for students of illumina
tion. Yet Di*. Brown does consider
able work for commercial applica
tion. Such things as testing the effi
ciencies of lighting fixtures, finding
the reflective qualities of reflecting
materials, and determining the
opacity of papers are in his line.
