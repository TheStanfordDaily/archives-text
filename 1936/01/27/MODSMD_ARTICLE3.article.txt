## Daily Representatives Interview Famous Kansas Writer, Visiting Stanford Campus 
### GRAY CREVELING 
(Copyright, 1936, by The Stanford Daily)
William Allen White, the Sage of Emporia, Kas., last night spoke his
mind on llic American farm problem when corralled by two Dailymen in
the living room of the home of his old Kansas University chum, emeritus
chemistry professor Edward Curtis Franklin.

"Some form of subsidy will have
to be worked out," he said. "They
(the American farmers) will not be
peasants, yet all of their competi
tors are peasants on a low standard
of living. Wheat from Russia where
there is no form of cost accounting
is sold for any price in this country.
"Maybe the American standard
of living is too high,'' he con
tinued.
The author-publisher cited the
cheapness of Argentine cattle, and
Egyptian cotton in addition to
Russian wheat as typical exam
ples of what the farmer is up
against.
"Tariffs don't seem to do any
good," he said.
Of the AAA he stated: "We (The
Emporia Gazette) didn't oppose the
AAA but encouraged the farmers
to give it. a try because it was the
only thing offered. The farmers are
frantic.
"But it is hard to say, even to de
fine the farm problem," and he
washed his hands of agricultural
woes.
Bob Jones, Daily editor, asked
him for some means with which to
combat the apathy of college stu
dents toward politics.
"A snap two-unit course in
newspaper reading," he replied
after a long silence.
Asked to speculate about Herbert
Hoover's part in the November ex
citement, White grinned: "I lost my
prophet's license in 1912 when I
predicted that Theodore Roosevelt
would win the presidential election.
"On January 1, 1900, I wrote an
editorial on the events due in the
20th century; and not a single one
of them turned out. So I won't
prophesy a thing!" lie quipped.
Recently arrived from a trip in
the Far East, the famed week-end
guest at the Hoover home said, "The
United States should get out of the
Philippines bag and baggage. The
islands should have complete inde
pendence as soon as possible.
"Our boundary should be the
180 th meridian," he said.
Referring to the American pol
icy of imperialism that made
Philippine acquisition possible,
White revealed that "In 1899 I op
posed it."
Forgetting his refusal to prophesy
anything, the staunch Republican
ventured, "Time will make Hoover's
administration more appreciated.
"Like Cleveland's," he compared.
