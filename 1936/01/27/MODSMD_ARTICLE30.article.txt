# Tiny Leaves for Coach Confab
## Stanford Mentor To Debate New Rules With 36 Coaches Thornhill Represents Coast, Mountain Sections in Pittsburgh Football Meeting 
### 
Coach Tiny Thornhill will entrain tonight hound for Pittsburgh, where
lie will attend the annual meeting of the American Football Coaches'
Association as the representative of the Pacific Coast and liocky Mountain
Conferences.
Thirty-six football mentors from all parts of the country will assemble
at the meetings February I and 2 to discuss suggested rule changes for

next season. At the close of the"
sessions recommendations will be
made to an executive committee
composed of Thornhill, Lou Little of
Columbia, Noble Kizer of Purdue,
and Ray Morrison of Vanderbilt,
which will decide upon changes at
its meetings February 14, 15, and l(i
at Palm Springs, Calif.
Chief rule modifications which
will be discussed at the meetings
uro:

(. Adoption of the fast whistle
after the forward motion of the j
hall carrier has been halted or j
one of his knees slips to the turf.
2. Removal of goal posts to the j
goal line from tlieir present posi- J
lion 10 yards behind the playing i
iield.
3. Allowance of handing for
ward the ball in a reverse play j
behind the line of scrimmage.
Present rules indicate that the ball i
must be handed back; otherwise, j
it is ruled a forward pass. The j
change is designed to facilitate
the operation of reverses.
A majority of the coaches on the j
Coast are in favor of the fast whistle, j
according to Thornhill. During the i
past season a modified slow whistle j
was used in most Pacific Coast Con- |
ference games, the length of delay
depending upon the judgment of
the officials. Proponents of the fast
whistle argue that it discourages un- |
necessary roughness and subsequent
injuries after each play. Advocates
of the slow whistle contend that the
fast whistle hampers the use of the l
lateral pass; however, Thornhill ■
takes exception to this contention.
Placing the goal posts back on
the goal line is designed to facili - j
tate kicking field goals. However, j
they were set back a few years
ago to remove the superstructure j
of posts and crossbar which handi- !
capped both the offensive and de
fensive teams on plays in the j
goal area. Only if an overhead i
mechanical arrangement can be I
perfected from Which the cross- j
bar could be suspended without J
interfering with the playing area, 1
would such a move be advisable, i
according to Thornhill.
The proposed change in the me- j
chanics of the reverse play behind
the line of scrimmage would sim- j
plify the play and standardize its!
operation, since many officials sel- [
dom rule a forward pass on the play }
regardless of whether the ball is!
handed forward. Under the sug
gested ruling a muffed ball on a re- j
verse would constitute a free ball. |
Thornhill will be back on the j
campus about February 6 prior to j
leaving for the executive session at j
Palm Springs.

Palm Springs.
Coach Tiny Thornhill will entrain tonight hound for Pittsburgh, where
lie will attend the annual meeting of the American Football Coaches'
Association as the representative of the Pacific Coast and liocky Mountain
Conferences.
Thirty-six football mentors from all parts of the country will assemble
at the meetings February I and 2 to discuss suggested rule changes for

next season. At the close of the"
sessions recommendations will be
made to an executive committee
composed of Thornhill, Lou Little of
Columbia, Noble Kizer of Purdue,
and Ray Morrison of Vanderbilt,
which will decide upon changes at
its meetings February 14, 15, and l(i
at Palm Springs, Calif.
Chief rule modifications which
will be discussed at the meetings
uro:

(. Adoption of the fast whistle
after the forward motion of the j
hall carrier has been halted or j
one of his knees slips to the turf.
2. Removal of goal posts to the j
goal line from tlieir present posi- J
lion 10 yards behind the playing i
iield.
3. Allowance of handing for
ward the ball in a reverse play j
behind the line of scrimmage.
Present rules indicate that the ball i
must be handed back; otherwise, j
it is ruled a forward pass. The j
change is designed to facilitate
the operation of reverses.
A majority of the coaches on the j
Coast are in favor of the fast whistle, j
according to Thornhill. During the i
past season a modified slow whistle j
was used in most Pacific Coast Con- |
ference games, the length of delay
depending upon the judgment of
the officials. Proponents of the fast
whistle argue that it discourages un- |
necessary roughness and subsequent
injuries after each play. Advocates
of the slow whistle contend that the
fast whistle hampers the use of the l
lateral pass; however, Thornhill ■
takes exception to this contention.
Placing the goal posts back on
the goal line is designed to facili - j
tate kicking field goals. However, j
they were set back a few years
ago to remove the superstructure j
of posts and crossbar which handi- !
capped both the offensive and de
fensive teams on plays in the j
goal area. Only if an overhead i
mechanical arrangement can be I
perfected from Which the cross- j
bar could be suspended without J
interfering with the playing area, 1
would such a move be advisable, i
according to Thornhill.
The proposed change in the me- j
chanics of the reverse play behind
the line of scrimmage would sim- j
plify the play and standardize its!
operation, since many officials sel- [
dom rule a forward pass on the play }
regardless of whether the ball is!
handed forward. Under the sug
gested ruling a muffed ball on a re- j
verse would constitute a free ball. |
Thornhill will be back on the j
campus about February 6 prior to j
leaving for the executive session at j
Palm Springs.
