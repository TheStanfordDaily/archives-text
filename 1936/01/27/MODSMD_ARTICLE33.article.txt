# ODDS AND ENDS
## 
### 
An odd jacket is an essential
pert of your resort kit. You
should have one of white
linen for wear with grey flan
nels, in the model we've il
lustrated. Dark colored shirts

will be smart with white
| clothing. We don't mean
those navy blue or brown
ones, but merely darker
| shades of oxford, broadcloth,
j or chambrey. A smart tie for
this is the pointed end bat
made of India madras.
