# CALL OF THE MILD
## 
### 
Another sneeze and sniffle
season being upon us, no
amazement should be dis
played at the growing num
ber of people migrating, bird
like, by air, as well as by
rail, by road and by sea, to
the mild, semi-tropic climates
of Florida, southern Califor
nia, and that flower of the
desert, Palm Springs. We
read no brief for one or the
other. In fact, we recommend
you see all three. Men's fash
ions being our primary in
terest, we prefer to avoid
controversy by leaving the
discussion of the merits of
South and West to the re
spective native sons of those
Edens. The two gentlemen,
winter resorting in a most
elegant fashion aboard their
cruiser, are dressed in a man
ner that combines the desired
nonchalance and the re
quired comfort for the sur
roundings amid which we
find them. The gentleman at
the left wears a natural tan
gabardine jacket made with
side vents in the high roll,
three button model, light
grey slacks, combination
Norwegian last shoes, and he
tops off his outfit with a coco
nut straw hat with puggaree
band. The outfit we've shown
on the gentleman at the right
is typical of that which might
be worn for fishing, boating,
golf or tennis, subject to
slight variations of hat and
shoes. The shorts are of
gabardine and the polo shirt
is lisle ribbed.
