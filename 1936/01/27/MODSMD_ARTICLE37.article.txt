# THE 						TROPIC TOUCH

### 
The white, double - breasted
dinner jacket of linen is most
appropriate for the mild eve
nings of the tropics. You

may wear with it a turn-down
laundered collar, or a silk
collar - attached shirt, and a
club-shaped bat tie is recom
mended. Your boutonniere
should be a wine-colored car
nation.
