Though beginning the game as under-dogs, with four regulars out
for the day, Stanford swept to a 24-0 victory over the Argonauts in last
Saturday's game played on the Farm field. Indian seconds didn't do so
well, losing their preliminary game (i-.'J against the Santa Rosa J.C.

Indian ruggers proved too strong'
for the Argonauts, scoring 10 points
in the first half. The forwards were
noticeably more powerful than the
opposing scrum, pushing them all
over the field. According to Coach
Jim Wylij, it was the varsity's best
performance this season. He also
gave them credit for playing "almost
perfect rugby" during the first half.
The 10 points made in the first
half were scored by Harrington,
Merritt, Rogers, and Kenny Peters.
Banshach accounted for four
points in two good conversions.
Second try made by Merritt was
the result of a long run by Cock
ins, who passed the ball to Mer
ritt before being downed near the
goal line. Peters made a nice run,
almost 10 yards, for the last try of
the lirst half.
CiiT Myers' and Kenny Peters'
tries in the second period were both
made after long dribbling rushes.
Bansbach made the conversion good
for two points after Myers' try.

Saturday's game was the third j
straight victory this season for In- I
dian ruggers. Last week they de
legated the Stanford Medicos and the
week before the San Francisco
Blues. Next Saturday the varsity
will meet the Olympic Club team in
the stadium. Tire Olympic Club be
ing one of the strongest teams in the
Rugby Union, they should be a good
test for the Stanford fifteen before
their game with U.S.C., slated for '
the following week.

The four regulars unable to see
action last Saturday were: Hager,
Pinotti, Zamloch, and Captain
Vigna. Zamloch and Vigna are
still recovering from the effects
of a head-on collision suffered
during the Stanford Medico game.
Coach Wylie, after giving the en
tire (earn credit for a good game,
cited Myers, Morrill, and Mullens
of the forwards, and Cockins, Mon
davi, and Peters of the backs, as
playing particularly well. Mullens
was .spectacular in his rushes, suc
cessfully blocking a kick in the sec
ond period.
Seconds still looked a bit ragged,
but showed a little improvement
over last week. Santa Rosa out
weighed them, scoring twice with no
conventions. Irian scored the Stan
ford try.
