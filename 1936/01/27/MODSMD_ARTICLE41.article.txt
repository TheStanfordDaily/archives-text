Six more teams will enter the
floor for the first time tonight in the
193(5 intramural basketball cam
paign. After three days of compe-
tition, all leagues are still wide open,
but the end of this week, which pre
sents a full schedule, should present
some idea of this year's standouts.
Tonight's Delta Tau - Phi Delt
game should prove interesting, as
the Phi Delts are leading the sea
sonal race and will put a strong
team on the floor. Coach Gorter's
El Toro varsity also makes its first
appearance tonight, meeting the
Japanese Club.
Teams are again warned that they
must be on the floor ready to play at
ten minutes after the hour.
