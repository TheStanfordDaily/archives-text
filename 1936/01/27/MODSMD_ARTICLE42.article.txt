## Sideline Slants LUISETTI'S SHOTS PLUS THESEâ€” 
### 
While we're still trying to make
ourselves believe that it's really
true, that we've dumped the mighty |
Trojans, that we're leading the con
ference, that we've finally come out
of the coast basketball cellar, it's I
the opportune time to point with
pride to certain members of that cer
tain team.
Luisetli was great. We all con- ;
cede thai, we all know that Hank
is prohahly the finest forward that
the Coast has seen in many a
moon.
We know he played like a demon
all week-end and especially in the
last few minutes of that greatest
ol'-thc-great games Saturday night,
that he tied the Indian outfit to
gether, that he scored .10 points, that |
he gave a magnificent display of
everything expected of a basketball
forward. We know that. We saw him
end we've heard it over and again i
since.
But there arc a couple of other
points we ought not to miss. For
instance there was Jack Calder
wood's block of Browning's shot j
as Stanford took that precious 2-
point lead just before the gun.
Perhaps you don't remember it.
Browning was about 20 feet out
from the hoop, he crouched to shoot, j
took aim (he was hot, you'll re- j
member). Calderwood, standing
'way in under the basket, saw,
sprang oul to block, succeeded.
The ball bounced over the be
wildered Browning's head, Jack
shot by, dribbled down, snapped
the quick pass to Ilank, who drop
ped in the set-up that put the
game away.
Coach John Bunn says he still
doesn't see how Calderwood did it, j
Hank modestly gives all credit for j
the basket to Jack, and we cite it as

I one of the highlights of a great
! game.
