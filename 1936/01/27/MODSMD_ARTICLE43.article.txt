# TURNER'S BACKSHOT A JOINT PLAY
## 
### 
There was another many missed.
That occurred when Bob Zonne and
Sparky Robertson were ready to
take a rebound from under the
U.S.C. basket. Howie Turner took a
shot from the side; it bounced on
the rim of the basket, failed to go
in, he followed.
Sparky and Zonne, seeing him
coming in, and also sensing that
they were between the two Tro
jan guards and the hall, stood
rooted in their tracks, forming a
wall that Bary's men couldn't get
through. They yelled to Turner to
"take it."
He did, made a beautiful back
hand bucket that would have been
impossible without the protection.
Those sparks of brilliance, and
others, lead us to hand Congrats to
others than Luisetti, though we
kpow well that Hank led 'em back
on the upgrade that ended in the
achieving of the unbelievable.
