# Levy's Registration Boosts Track Hopes
## 
### 
Stanford's track hopes were bol
stered by exactly five points per
meet Friday when it was learned
Phil Levy, stellar discus man, had
returned to school and competition.
Levy, who made a top mark of 160
feet 1 inch last season - and threw
over 150 feet here last quarter in
practice, will ably take over the
leadership of the 193G edition of the
nation's perennial discus cream, and
will try, along with Jim "Phi Bete"
Reynolds and A1 'Marriedman' Her
shey, to bring the department up to
its former supremacy.
