# Seniors Nose Out Frosh In Swim Meet
## Towne Again Surpasses Fifty-Yard Breast Mark 
### 
Senior swimmers barely nosed out
a strong frosh team by one point
in last Saturday's annual inter-class
meet bold in the Encina pools. The
•four teams ended with seniors hav
ing 37 points; frosh, 36; juniors, 20;
and the four-man sophomore team
trailing with 15 points.
High point man for the day was
yearling YVinfred Needham who tal
lied eight points for his team, win
ning the 440 free style and taking
second in the 220 free style. Best
performance went to Don Towne
sensational frosh breast-stroke star
who easily took the century, passing
the 50-yard in 34.6 seconds, a full
second under the world mark.
Bob Walker, Golden Gate trans
fer, turned in his best performance
of the year when he won the 150-
yard backstroke in 1:48.3.
According to Coach Nort Thorn
ton, the meet showed that the swim
mers were in better shape than last
year, many of the times being faster
in this meet than in last year's Big
Meet with Cal when the team was
at its peak.
