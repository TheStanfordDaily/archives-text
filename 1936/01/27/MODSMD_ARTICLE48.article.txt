## 
### Roger Kimball 
Stanford's fiosh basketballers con- , 1
tinue to improve, and it's lucky that 1
they do, for they finally got some ;
competition Saturday night. Stock- i
ton High School, with a tall, fast
team, held the yearlings to a 31-22 j
victory in the Pavilion, after Rab- ! <
bit Bradshaw's men had swamped j
Piedmont High, 41-10, the evening
"before.
Pulling a "Luisetti" by scoring 24 i
points, Phil Zonne ran rings around i ;
Stockton. The lanky center out
scored the entire visiting team and
counted 14 of the Babes' 17 digits
in the first half.
With the exception of Zonne, the
yearlings looked just as good Fri
day night against Piedmont. The
Highlanders were considerably ;

weaker than Stockton, and never
had a chance. Zonne took few shots
and didn't make a field goal until
the closing moments. Seven free
throws gave him a total of 5) points.
Neeley and Calkins led the frosli
to their win over Piedmont. The
former used his six feet, three
inches to advantage under the bas
ket, and tied Zonne for scoring hon
ors. Calkins played a smooth game
and rang up 8 markers. McArthur
and Kessel did their part in the one
sided triumph, the former tossing in
several long ones.
Friday night at Berkeley, the
yearlings face their big test in their
first battle with the California frosh.
The game wili be a preliminary to
the second Indian-Bear game.
