# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Immunity Clause, Less Formality, Early Pledging Might Help Sorority Rushing 
### 
Events of the past two weeks have opened
up both fraternity and sorority rushing set
ups to considerable criticism, and demands
for fundamental changes in two apparently
unhealthy systems finally have prompted ac
tion to revamp and modernize men's and
women's pledging.
Interfraternity Board's special committee
is progressing with recommendations for ma
jor alterations in the fraternity situation;
today, Pan-Hellenic meets to commence nego
tiations for a less vulnerable sorority rushing
program.
Three sororities were deprived of rushing
privileges and much dirty linen was brought
before the Committee of Three in the general
blow-up a week ago. The joint committee
later acted wisely in modifying the sentences
of the three convicted Greek organizations.
The powers-that-be 011 the feminine How,
however, lace a much more ticklish business
in their meeting today than they did in either
of the previous sessions of the past two weeks.
To change the present system will involve
many compromises and dilliculties; as in the
case of tin- fraternities, any alterations must
be in tlu- best interests of How, Hoble, and
Administration, which again means a "happy
medium" between the present system and
wide-open rushing. The ideal middle ground
will be dillicult to ascertain.
The fact remains, however, that any really
satisfactory set-up must embody a program of
less formal, more human contacts between

the sororities and freshmen. It is true, of
course, that anything verging on wide-open
contact would be inadvisable; it follows that
rules are essential, but the rules need not
make the contacts still' and unnatural as they
now are.
Another factor that apparently is vital to a
workable system is an insurance against the
recurrence of a general explosion like that
experienced by the sororities this year. Hence,
a two-week immunity clause seemingly would
be an advisable addition to the sororities'
rushing code.
Earlier pledging, by shortening the length
of time under which both freshmen and so
rority women are under u nervous strain, con
ceivably might encourage the houses to stay
within the spirit of the laws.
Opposition to an earlier pledging date —011
the grounds that the forming of cliques in
Koble should be postponed—does not take
into consideration the obvious truth that
cliques in a women's dormitory will form
almost immediately after registration. Au
tumn quarter pledging, in fact, would help
the Administration's anti - clique stand by
occasioning the intermingling of already
formed groups.
As it contemplates changes today, Pan-Hel
lenic, then, might devote its interests to in
suring against a recurrence of the last blow
up, and to arranging for more normal, yet
adequately controlled, contacts between the
women of Halls and How.

Opposition to an earlier pledging date —011
the grounds that the forming of cliques in
Koble should be postponed—does not take
into consideration the obvious truth that
cliques in a women's dormitory will form
almost immediately after registration. Au
tumn quarter pledging, in fact, would help
the Administration's anti - clique stand by
occasioning the intermingling of already
formed groups.
As it contemplates changes today, Pan-Hel
lenic, then, might devote its interests to in

up, and to arranging for more normal, yet
adequately controlled, contacts between the
women of Halls and How.
Events of the past two weeks have opened
up both fraternity and sorority rushing set
ups to considerable criticism, and demands
for fundamental changes in two apparently
unhealthy systems finally have prompted ac
tion to revamp and modernize men's and
women's pledging.
Interfraternity Board's special committee
is progressing with recommendations for ma
jor alterations in the fraternity situation;
today, Pan-Hellenic meets to commence nego
tiations for a less vulnerable sorority rushing
program.
Three sororities were deprived of rushing
privileges and much dirty linen was brought
before the Committee of Three in the general
blow-up a week ago. The joint committee
later acted wisely in modifying the sentences
of the three convicted Greek organizations.
The powers-that-be 011 the feminine How,
however, lace a much more ticklish business
in their meeting today than they did in either
of the previous sessions of the past two weeks.
To change the present system will involve
many compromises and dilliculties; as in the
case of tin- fraternities, any alterations must
be in tlu- best interests of How, Hoble, and
Administration, which again means a "happy
medium" between the present system and
wide-open rushing. The ideal middle ground
will be dillicult to ascertain.
The fact remains, however, that any really
satisfactory set-up must embody a program of
less formal, more human contacts between

the sororities and freshmen. It is true, of
course, that anything verging on wide-open
contact would be inadvisable; it follows that
rules are essential, but the rules need not
make the contacts still' and unnatural as they
now are.
Another factor that apparently is vital to a
workable system is an insurance against the
recurrence of a general explosion like that
experienced by the sororities this year. Hence,
a two-week immunity clause seemingly would
be an advisable addition to the sororities'
rushing code.
