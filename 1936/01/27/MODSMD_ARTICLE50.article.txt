# Stanford Men Don't Seem To Mind Paying the Bill
## 
### 
Today presumably, the twenty "men" in
the Senate will he voted down by the 70
"mice" who will vote favorably on the two
and one-half billion dollar "baby bond" bonus
bill. That will enact the measure into law
over the President's veto.
All through the 2()'s, successive Presidents
signed their "I forbids" at the bottom of vari
ous bonus payment measures, but now it ap
pears the Legion lads have put it over. This
successful pressure-group politics will ladle
a huge sum of money out of the taxpayers'
pockets into the veterans.
The veterans' claims should have been
cleaned up long ago, and not left over to be a
political football that present "mice" con
gressmen could make the most of, and still
leave future generations to pay.
Baby bonds or no baby bonds, negotiab'e
or non-negotiable, the end result will be the
same—they'll have to be paid for. And Mr.
Average Stanford Hough will be dinged along
with the rest, although that seems to bother
him not at all right now, and the bonus is not
even a good conversational topic to him.
Which brings up the old question of why
college students are so uninterested in affairs
of the world and the nation. Usually it is con
sidered their own fault, and merely a rellec
lion of their general laziness and mental de
terioration.
But sometimes, one is prone to cslst the
stone at their leaders, and ask why interesting
assemblies and talks on world events are not
slated. To ask why an attempt is not made

to get such figures as Admiral livrd to lecture
here, or more speakers of the Will Durant
caliber?
Perhaps the lack of student attendance at
Tuesday lectures is not entirely due to lack of
interest on their part. The Fiord Region of
Greenland and Chinese Gardens and Land
scape Paintings may he cultural topics, hut
they are not very lively.
