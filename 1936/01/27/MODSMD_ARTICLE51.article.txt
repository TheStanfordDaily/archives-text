# Bull Session
## HANDS AND FEET—FIRST FINAL 
### 
Miss Susan
Stanford University
Dear Susan:
Without flattery, I can tell you that your letters
have created the biggest stir around The Daily since
former Editor Bcaubaire got in the middle of a two
way tangle between Bull Sessioner MellinkofT and
Willie Hearst.
# » * *
At present writing, the score is a couple of foul
hits, no runs, and a multitude of errors. As I see it
(write under plain wrapper if I'm wrong) you can
cite three failings of the Stanford Rough and I can
cite one of the Stanford maid.
But psychologists would discard our observations.
We're both speaking of incidents converted into con
victions by our own thinking.
What we need is an honest-to-God ease history.
There's only one way to get it, so I'm asking you for
a date. My contention is that you will be well-dressed
but socially inept. Your contention is that I will be
dressed all right (except for a shave), but will tend
to burp at odd moments, become glassy-eyed on a
night club highball, and get sloppily amorous along
about midnight.
Now since an associate editor has guaranteed half
the costs, suppose we go out, anywhere you say, and
put the whole business to a test.

As rules of the game, I suggest no note-taking, no
analytical discussions, and no fair tripping me up on
the floor.
We will absolutely not rhapsodize on the beauties
of the night as a preliminary. You will not take half
the evening excusing yourself to adjust your local tie
ins, and I will not get into the nearest poker game.
Neither one will apologize for stepping on each
other's toes, nor will we comment on the orchestra,
classes, and professors.
If the floor is crowded, we will get bfT without any
shenanegans. If the tip of my collar is slowly but
surely putting out your eye, you will say so.

You will please not order caviar, tomato juice, coca
colas, or a crab salad. What you order you'll eat with
out picking apart. And you will not make faces after
ordering something lhat you know tastes like sheep
dip.
But you know my name and I don't know yours.
R.S.V.P.—for science!
