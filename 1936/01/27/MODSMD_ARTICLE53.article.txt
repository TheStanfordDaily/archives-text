Do crowds bore you? Do inquiring policemen ask
you to move on? Would you really like to enjoy an
uninterrupted, thought-provoking conversation with
that vertiginous blonde in the seat beside you? If you
really are interested in this proposition, Our Hasher
will tell you just the soot where you may enjoy soli
tude to your heart's content.

No, it isn't along the Guv's Lane, nor back in the
foothills, nor at the Yacht Harbor. The spot is right
in front of the library. Our Hasher docs not take credit
for this discovery. It was really pointed out to him by
those who have pioneered in this field.

Of course, it requires a certain technique. But it
is all very simple. You and the vertiginous blonde park
yours car right smack in front of the library on a very
cold night. You carry on your uninterrupted conversa
tion until the windows of your car are all steamed
up. Then you may interrupt your conversation and
follow the example of the windows.

Those who have tried this method report phenom
enal results. Send no money, but clip your bill and
coupon now.

There is a petition now going around the JRoble
mesquite to make hashing a major sport.

There is a certain business mogul, who is the height
of sales promotion on this earth. Of course, he is
going to Business School, but that is a mere formality.
For years now, he has gone around selling 10-cent
Christmas cards for 20 cents, and it is rumored that
farmers all over lowa own second mortgages on the
Stanford Memorial Church.
But a group of feminine schemers apparently re
sented certain deals he had put over on them. When
this executive from the steppes and landings of Idaho
advertised in The Daily that he was sacrificing his car
at a very low cost as a first step toward the ultimate
equalization of wealth, these plotters formed a chain
telephone ring (Bell, you know), which called up the
entrepreneur from cities all over the state.
As a result, our friend has dropped his studies at
beloved old Stanford, given up his suite in the historic
old Lamson house, and is now touring California in his
pretty old car in answer to the many inquiries he has
received. If our remarkable businessman ever finds
out that love does not rule the business world, he will
probably add a line of magazines, books, and peanuts
and work his way through college and California.

Daily want-ads bring results.
