The Editor, Sir:
To Mr. Eisenbach: My last letter
tried to show you that the Rough
! needed a little social education, too;
maybe you didn't understand.
If you knew the heartaches most
Stanford women go through before
they are recognized at all but you"
{ men, you'd go a bit easier on the
razzberries. Unfortunately, these
' growing pains come before we know
| you well enough to know what
messy lines most of you haveâ€”when ,
| we're scared to death of you great
j big handsome things.
Some of the weaker souls and
j those who get unusually hard
| knocks at jolly-ups, etc., never re
[ cover. These are the girls who give
| all their attention to books, pretend
i ing they aren't interested in men.
After they tell themselves that long
enough, they begin to believe it.
We hardier souls take it on the
chin and keep coming back until we
iearn how to flatter the peculiar ego
J of the heap big Indians. Because
I our mamas have been through all
j this before us (with some painful
| memories of handmade dresses),
: they mortgage the old home so that
, we can have all the benefits of sci
: ence to help us live through the or
i deal you lads have in store for us.
Therefore I agree with you and
! your friend that some women need
j lots of physical as well as social
j training. I maintain that many men
I need the same going over.
T'm afraid we disagree as to Quad
i clothes. I hope both sexes keep an
I informal garb for classes. Neatness,
I including shaving for the men, is
just as important in daylight as in
1 moonlight.
In case you are interested, it's not
j necessary for a girl to ruin her in
! sides with varnish remover. If any
j one would like a course in how to
get rid of highballs without drinking
j them, just send 'em around. The
j men can drink all they want as far
i as I'm concerned. That's their affair.
If their technique isn't so good when
j when they're feeling happy, it's still
j their affair.
The purpose of a university should
; be, among other things, to teach
[ students to live well-rounded lives. ;

I think Stanford, to an extent, has
failed to fulfill this purpose. Hence
I wrote you and again come out of
the shadows, to ask if something can
be done about it. Susan
