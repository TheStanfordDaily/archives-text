# "IT COMES OUT HERE"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With the increased registration j
there is, naturally, an increased need
for remembering the rule to "live i
and let live." This applies to noise- ;
producing activities, particularly in j
and around places where people try |
to concentrate, the library, for in
stance.
The big parking field on the
southern (or is it southwestern) side
of the library building is becoming
increasingly noisy—more so than is
necessary. And after the last vaca- i
tion, a few students priding them- !
selves on their new automobile j
horns, have been added to those who
think it all right to signal a friend—
and thereby everyone in the adjoin- 1
ing part of the building—with a
honk.
Shall I commit the unmodcrnity j
of also mentioning that sibaritic, if
unscholarly, practice of parking un- I
der a library wall with your radio i
going loud?
All of us, even the youngest in
mind and body, arc capable of be
ing trained early to keep quiet in

church, or at any serious meeting,
at certain receptions, etc.. Why not
accord some such treatment to the
library? Then—why not?
A Hopeful
