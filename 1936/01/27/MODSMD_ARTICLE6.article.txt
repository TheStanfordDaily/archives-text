# Demand Shown For Speakers
## Trojans' Bureau Similar To New Stanford Group 
### 
While Charles Schafer, diminutive
manager of Stanford's fledgling
Speakers' Bureau, was busy yester
day sorting through a deluge of re
sponses to his 70 letters of invitation
mailed Wednesday to civic groups,
members of a similar organization
at U.S.C. were talking over reactions
to their first public presentation of
student opinion.
According to an article in The
Daily Trojan, a member of the
Southern California Speakers' Bu
reau last week addressed a church
congregation tin the subject, '"Is
Communism or Fascism the Chief
Threat to American Democracy?"
The Trojan stated that heretofore
requests for student speakers have
been handled through the university
chapter of the Y.M.C.A., but that the
bureau, with the co-operation of the
debate office, will henceforth take
charge of the matter itself. The en
tire U.S.C. debate squad and mem
bers of the "Y' arc included in the
Speakers' Bureau personnel.
Twenty-five students, including
a number of women, have been
signed for the Speakers' Bureau,
Schafer announced yesterday.
They are preparing speeches of
from IS to 20 minutes' length on
subjects ranging from ' Burma" to
"Juvenile Delinquency." Fin
ished talks will be given Thursday
before the review board composed
of Wally Brooke, Schafer, Jean
Albcrtson, Wayne Richardson, and
Frofcssor XV. M. Timmons.
Because many additional speak
ers will be needed to fulfill re
quests for the group's services, Scha
fer urged interested students to se
cure particulars of the bureau from
Professor Timmons in Room 203 D.
