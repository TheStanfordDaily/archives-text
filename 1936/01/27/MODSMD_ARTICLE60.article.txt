"PRIVATE LIVES"

A Noel Coward comedy is prac
tically impossible to ruin by bad
acting. At the same time, a Noel
Coward comedy requires acting al
most better than obtainable to bring
out its full flavor.
Bearing both those facts in mind,
the Palo Alto Community Players'
production of "Private Lives" last
week-end must be called a good one.
In the very beginning of the play,
about the first half of the first act,
things moved siowly and lacked the
sparkle and subtlety that good
Coward should receive. The actors
slood clumsily and gave their lines
equally awkwardly.
Leaving out the ineptness of that
first part, one can give practically
nothing but praise for the whole
cast, and the direction, too. Fred
Clark made a perfect Elyot, and |
Jean Albertson a perfect Amanda.
Bob Garred was excellent as Victor,
but he strained a little at times, es
pecially when he tried to hunch his
shoulders to indicate pomposity.
As for Director James Sandoe, he,
probably, should receive the brunt '
of the blame for that lumbering first
portion, but to even the score he
merits praise for the rest of what
was a good Coward production.
Carroll Alexander's sets were, as
always, good. â€”Bernheim

"KING OF BURLESQUE"
At the Stanford
B"King of Burlesque'' is a \
good job from every stand- '
point. An amusing musical;
trifle, it receives excellent di- '
rection, snappy dialogue, and fine j
acting from a large group of stars i
and near-stars that seem to be built :
for their roles. Jimmy McHugh's |
music is tuneful but uninspired, j
Movie-goers will whistle and dance j
to "I've Got My Fingers Crossed" ;
and "I'm Shooting High" but they'll
forget them next week without re- |
gret.
An old script prevents this picture
from getting an "A" rating. Warner

Baxter is cast as a burlesque pro
ducer who takes Broadway by storm
only to go bankrupt when he goes
after Park Avenue swank. He finally
loses his Social Register wife and
kisses his dance director, Alice Faye,
as his come-back effort turns out to
be a smash hit, thanks to talent he
finds in office boys, bootblacks, tele
phone girls, and elevator boys. Bou
quets should go to every one of the
fast stepping, melodious voiced cast
which includes Nick Long, Jr., Fats
Waller, and Arline Judge.
