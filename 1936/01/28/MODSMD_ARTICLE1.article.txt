# Political Ring Runs Lamson Trial: Winters
## Venire Reduced to 102 As Attorneys Begin 4th Probe into Famous Case 
### 
That Lamson's fate has been
dominated by a "grossly corrupt po
litical ring" in Santa Clara County
was the declaration last night of Dr.
Yvor Winters, instructor in Eng
lish, as the fourth trial of the former
Stanford University Press executive
proceeded at San Jose.
"Shocked at Corruption"
''I personally am deeply shocked
not only at the corruption exposed
at the trial, but at the way large
numbers of eminent scholars and
respectable clergymen allow them
selves to be the organs of gossip
and the inadvertent tools of petty
politicians," he said.
"If Lamson had been tried in a
county not corruptly controlled
he would unquestionably have
been freed. In his second trial a
perfectly appalling amount of
testimony offered by the prosecu
tion was shown to be brazen per
jury, and a great deal more was
shown to be perfectly incompe
tent."
As co-author of the book, "The
Case of David Lamson," Dr. Win
ters has insistently maintained Lam
son's innocence through three trials
for the bath tub murder of his
wife, Allene, in the Lamsons' campus
home Memorial Day, 1933.
Panel Reduced
Meanwhile, legal preliminaries to
the courtroom drama that will
probably end either in certain fail
ure or certain success for Lamson
and his supporters continued as a
venire of 250 talesmen for jury duty
was reduced to 102, with 12 men
and women in the jury box inac
ceptable to either side and the pos
sibility that k a special venire would
be called.
There were early indications
that both prosecution and defense
would follow the lines ol previous
trials. The bathtub in which Mrs.
Lamson met her death was still in
the courtroom of Judge J. J. Tra
bucco, held over from the last
legal battles, but covered with
canvas.
Unlike previous trials, there was
no rush of possible jurymen. In
stead, the court was deluged with
talesmen pleading ill health, and
even bringing physician's certificates
to prove it. Others said they were
bar dof hearing. Two were dead.
Fourteen failed to appeal*.
Legal Line-up
The state was represented by four
members of the district attorney's
office: Fred L. Thomas, his chief
deputy; John P. Fitzgerald; and his
two assistants, A. P. Lindsay and
Herbert Bridges. Aiding in the de
fense were Leo Friendman, chief
defense attorney of San Francisco,
and Attorney E. M. Rea, Lamson's
personal attorney since he was first
arrested.
The work of selection a jury will
continue today.

That Lamson's fate has been
dominated by a "grossly corrupt po
litical ring" in Santa Clara County
was the declaration last night of Dr.
Yvor Winters, instructor in Eng
lish, as the fourth trial of the former
Stanford University Press executive
proceeded at San Jose.
"Shocked at Corruption"
''I personally am deeply shocked
not only at the corruption exposed
at the trial, but at the way large
numbers of eminent scholars and
respectable clergymen allow them
selves to be the organs of gossip
and the inadvertent tools of petty
politicians," he said.
"If Lamson had been tried in a
county not corruptly controlled
he would unquestionably have
been freed. In his second trial a
perfectly appalling amount of
testimony offered by the prosecu
tion was shown to be brazen per
jury, and a great deal more was
shown to be perfectly incompe
tent."
As co-author of the book, "The
Case of David Lamson," Dr. Win
ters has insistently maintained Lam
son's innocence through three trials
for the bath tub murder of his
wife, Allene, in the Lamsons' campus
home Memorial Day, 1933.
Panel Reduced
Meanwhile, legal preliminaries to
the courtroom drama that will
probably end either in certain fail
ure or certain success for Lamson
and his supporters continued as a
venire of 250 talesmen for jury duty
was reduced to 102, with 12 men
and women in the jury box inac
ceptable to either side and the pos
sibility that k a special venire would
be called.
There were early indications
that both prosecution and defense
would follow the lines ol previous
trials. The bathtub in which Mrs.
Lamson met her death was still in
the courtroom of Judge J. J. Tra
bucco, held over from the last
legal battles, but covered with
canvas.
Unlike previous trials, there was
no rush of possible jurymen. In
stead, the court was deluged with
talesmen pleading ill health, and
even bringing physician's certificates
to prove it. Others said they were
bar dof hearing. Two were dead.
Fourteen failed to appeal*.
Legal Line-up
The state was represented by four
members of the district attorney's
office: Fred L. Thomas, his chief
deputy; John P. Fitzgerald; and his
two assistants, A. P. Lindsay and
Herbert Bridges. Aiding in the de
fense were Leo Friendman, chief
defense attorney of San Francisco,
and Attorney E. M. Rea, Lamson's
personal attorney since he was first
arrested.
The work of selection a jury will
continue today.
