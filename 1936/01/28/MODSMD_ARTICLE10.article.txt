## 
### Leonard Blaikie 
Immediate cash payment of the
soldier's bonus, which would boost
the United States public debt to
over 35 billion dollars by the end of
the fiscal year 1937, would not pre
cipitate a financial crisis or greatly
endanger the solvency of the nation,
Dr. James Kendall Hall, visiting lec
turer in economics declared last
night.
The United States is in a rela
tively favorable position to carry
a large public debt because of the
high per capita incomes of its citi
zens, he explained. However, as
soon as emergency conditions have
passed, the national budget must
be balanced and government
debts lowered.
By overriding President Roose
velt's veto, 76 to 19. yesterday, the

Senate enacted into law the "baby
[ bond" bonus bill which had already
received the approval of the House
of Representatives by a vote of 324
to 61.
Veterans, under provisions of
(be bill, will receive the full ma
turity value of endowment insur
ance policies which were provided
for in the Adjustment Compen
sation Act of 1924.
' Payment will be made in $50 bonds
' atid cash for smaller amounts. After
June 15 veterans who wish to do so
may redeem the bonds for cash. A
| three per cent rebate is offered as
! inducement to hold the bonds. The
Senate Finance Committee estimates
that between $1,000,000,000 and
$2,491,000,000 in cash will be neces
j sary to redeem the bonds when
! they are presented for redemption.
