# Stowaway? Nah, It Was All A Mistake
## Lagunita Maid Foundâ€” En Route To Hawaii 
### 
Tlie fact that she left Saturday i
and was not home by Sunday noon I
caused only a minimum of concern
among Lagunita officials.
But these administrators, together
with the Dean of Women's office, J
began to develop a bad case of jit- j
ters along about Sunday evening j
when phone calls began coming in j
from Oklahoma City asking about [
Marian Trosper.
Marian, it seems, had chased off i
Saturday morning to the Matson j
docks in San Francisco to see
some friends off on the Malolo.
And today she is on the high seas j
bound for Honolulu. She delayed j
just the tiniest bit too long on board
the boat, walked just a little too
slow through the companionways,
said "write me, now don't forget"
about three times too many.
She cabled the folks hack in Ok- '
lahoma for money; they were 1111- I
nerved just enough to prompt a !
phone call to Lagunita to verify j
the story; it all could have been
a hoax, they figured.
And Marian, as a matter of fact, j
won't be back to school for the next |
two weeks or so. She was stuck, j
you see, so she gets a round trip to j
Hawaii with three days on the
islands, Papa pays the bill, and Miss J
Yost again can settle back to last- j
minute preparations for her Euro- j
pean tour.
