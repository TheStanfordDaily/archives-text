# Temperature's Fine, But The Taste-—Ugh
## 
### 
Up in the office of Student Man
ager Bob Gros there arc fish. Not
transient amphibians, but perma
nent honest-to-goodness fish
shipped from the South Seas
where' the water is just so in
chemical content and temperature.
Bob keeps them under glass as
a sort of A.S.S.U. rogue's gallery,
with tricky heater gadgets to give
a perfect imitation of sun-warm
ing.
But the taste of the water! Even
the fish can't stand it. Bob's seen
them turn in their chips just
from smelling that oh-so-sanitary
cleaning solution vended by the
Union Bar.
So now he's given to doping up
the stuff with fancy chemicals to
make it drinkable—for the fish.
"What they really need, though,"
he opined, "is beer."
