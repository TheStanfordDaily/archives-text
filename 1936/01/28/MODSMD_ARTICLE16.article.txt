# Art Gallery Exhibits New Prints, Etchings
## 
### 
Over 100 prints and etchings from
this year's annual show are being
exhibited in the Art Gallery by the
California Society of Etchers. The
last show of a similar nature was
shown at Stanford four years ago.
The California Society of Etch
ers was organized at Stan
ford in 1914 by Robert H. Harshe,
formerly of the graphic arts depart
ment, and now director of the Chi
cago Art Institute, and Pedro de
Lemos, at that time director of the
San Francisco Art Institute. Mr.
de Lemos is at present, director of
the Stanford Museum and Art Gal
lery.
