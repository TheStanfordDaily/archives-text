# Bobby Wants To Be Coach, Study Law
## 
### 
Bobby Grayson, who thrilled
co-eds and drew many a cheer
from football fans as he galloped
to national fame on the Stanford
gridiron, was preparing yester
day to return to the place of his
gloryâ€”as a law student.
"I want to study law, and I
want a coaching job at Stanford
to make that possible," the former
all-American halfback declared on
his arrival in San Francisco
aboard the Mariposa.
He admitted receiving two of
fers to play professional football,
but said he hadn't done anything
about them.
"If someone offered me $50,000
as has been reported, I think I'd
do it, though," he said.
