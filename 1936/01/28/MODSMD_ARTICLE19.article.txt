# Davis To Speak On Slang Origin
## Press Editor Will Give Lecture at 7:30 o'clock 
### 
Origins and meanings of such
homely phases as "bog down," "wet
behind the ears," "pinch hit"—ex
pressions used in ordinary conver
sation will be explained and traced
in the lecture given tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Assembly Hall by
Professor W. H. Davis, editor of the
Stanford Press.
"These expressions reveal many
interesting things about human
nature," said Dr. Davis, "and a
great deal of the past history of
the race is involved in the com
mon language of the present day."
Many colloquialisms are derived
from the caveman days—such as
"seep through," "back to the wall,"
and "pits of their own digging."
Others have come from the sports,
as baseball, which has contributed
"home run" and "pinch hit," now
used in entirely different connec
tions.
Recommending the continued
use of these expressions, and also
the invention and employment of
more, Professor Davis says, "There
is a tendency for academic people
to avoid these phrases, but this is
often unwise, for they are an ef
fective means of conveying
thought."
The speaker will enumerate a
number of these common figures of
speech in his lecture, and will place
them in their proper categories. After
a study of several years, he has
collected and classified more than
2500 expressions.
