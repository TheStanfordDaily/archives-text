# Stone Receives Death Penalty
## Ex-Convict Sentenced For Stammer Slaying 
### 
FRESNO, Jan. 27 (/P).â€”Elton M.
Stone, 31-year-old Fresno sex slay
er, was sentenced to death today for
the murder of Mary Stammer.
Within four hours after, he had
been arraigned, he had pleaded
guilty, been convicted of murder in
the first degree, and was on his way
to Folsom to await the noose that
would end his life.
A crowd estimated at from 2,500
to 3,000 watched Stone as he was es
corted to the courtroom by armed
deputies. There were a few cries of
"Get him!" but no disorders.
No date was set for Stone's execu
tion because a recent state law pro
vides automatic review of the case
by the State Supreme Court. This
meant possible delay of the execu
tion for four months or more.
The court does not meet until
March 3 in Los Angeles. Other mat
ters on the calendar may delay re
view until April. After the review,
the case must lie turned back to the
Superior Court to impose sentence,
which may not be until May. An
other month would then elapse be
fore execution of the sentence.
