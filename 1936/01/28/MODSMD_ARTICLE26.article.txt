# Seamen's Union Drops Pacific Unit
## Trade Threatened As Recurrence Looms For Shipping Tie-up of 1934 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 27 (/P).â€”
Threats of the most serious shipping
tie-up on the Pacific Coast since
the long and bloody maritime strike
of 1934 loomed tonight.
Revocation of the Sailors' Union of
the Pacific charter by the Interna
tional Seamen's Union convention
in Washington, D.C., brought prompt
action here.
Oflicals of shipowners' associa
tions announced that, as the Sail
ors' union no longer had official
standing in the 1.5. U., they would
not deal with it. They insisted
their contracts were with the I.S.U.
alone.
Harry Lundeberg, head of the
sailors' union and president of the
Maritime Federation, called a coun
cil meeting for tonight to consider
action.
Waterfront observers generally
predicted that the developments
would bring a test of the strength
of the Maritime Federation, or
ganized after the 1934 strike to
represent 35,000 seagoing and dock
workers on the coast.
"It will mean a fight if they try
to rob the men of all they have
gained during the past year and a
half," declared Mervyn Rathborne,
secretary of the district council of
the federation.
Rathborne charged that the
I.S.U. and ship-owners' move"
against the sailors' union, with a
coast membership of 6,800, was
the start of a "lockout" which he
and Harry Bridges, district fed
eration president, had predicted.
Refusal to deal with the sailors'
union "as now constituted" was an
nounced by Hugh Gallagher, presi
dent of the Pacific American Ship
owners Association, and Frank
O'Connor, president of the ship
owners Association of the Pacific.
