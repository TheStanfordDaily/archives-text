# Roosevelt Prepares For Bonus Payments
## F.D.R. Accepts Senate Veto Reversal Serenely 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (JP). — ■
Quickly accepting a climatic Senate j
vote of 7fi to 19 as sealing the over- j
throw of his bonus veto, President
Roosevelt today sent orders down
the line to pay off the $2,491,000,000
soldiers' bill as quickly as "accuracy
will permit."
No word of disappointment or
rhagrin, no hint as to the possi
bility of new taxes cames from
the White House as the Senate, in
a thwacking bi-partisan ballot—
with a two-thirds majority never
in doubt—declined to accept the
President's disapproval of the bill
for immediate payment in $50
cashable bonds. The house pre
viously had voted 321 to (>1 to
over-ride.
In the second of two statements
issuing quickly from the White j
House, however, the President open
ed a drive to lessen the strain on the j
Treasury by arguing to veterans i
that they should not cash their j
bonds, but hold them as '"nest eggs."
After a speedily arranged con
ference with the national com
manders of the three major vet- ;
erans' organizations, Mr. lioose- !
velt authorized a press release
urging veterans to prevent "frit
tering away" of cash from the :
bonds.
Administration leaders have esti- !
mated that not more than one bil- !
lion dollars will be needed to meet :
the first rush of demands for cash- ;
ing the bonds, and the President;
apparently intended to keep the fig- ;
ure below this if possible.
