# Sell-out Predicted For 'The Doctor's Wife'
## 
### 
Owing to the heavy advance sale
of tickets, an early sell-out of "The
Doctor's Wife" is predicted. The re
maining tickets may be obtained at
the Stanford Bookstore, and in Palo
Alto at Keeble's and the Chamber
of Commerce office.
The Chamber of Commerce ex
presses its belief that there are
two chief reasons for the heavy
sale: the appeal of the cause, a
fund for research in poliomyelitis,
and the popularity of the play. The
play will be given Thursday night in
the Assembly Hall, with Johnny
Mottram, Mac Gordon, Rosemary
Benet, Kay Comrie, and Malcolm
McDufFie among the Stanford stu
dents taking part.
Students of N.Y.U. boycotted their
basketball team when refused
cheaper and better seats.
