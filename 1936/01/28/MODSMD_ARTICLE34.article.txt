### 
Stanford's gridmen who returned
yesterday from a Hawaii trip with
Pop Warner's all-star football team,
say the Islanders play a good brand
of football, but that they don't mea
sure up to coast teams.
Of the Stanford group, Larry
Rouble, Harry Carlson, Johnny
Reisner, Ray Todd, Bob Reynolds,
Woody Adams, and Bobby Gray
son and wife, returned on the
S.S. Mariposa. Wes Muller, Keith
Topping, and Neils Larson remain
ed to play with the Honolulu
Townies against the Detroit Lions,
national professional champions.
Reisner said the Hawaiians con
centrated too much on offense, pas
sing a great deal, and that their
weak defense was largely responsi
ble for the lop-sided scores. Other
members said the Townies, com
posed of the pick of the Hawaiian
teams had good backs and a better
line than was indicated by the scores.
Four days training on the ship
en route to Haupii and "not
much training/' hut plenty of
surf hoard riding were reported
by Reynolds. The team agreed
they had a fine time on the trip,
hut Reisner said Honolulu was
"okey only for a while, then back
to America."
The entire group of Stanfordites
attended the wedding of Grayson
and Miss Christine Williams. Rey
nolds, Adams, Rouble, and Muller
were ushers.
Mr. and Mrs. Grayson now are
staying at a Palo Alto hotel while
hunting for an apartment.
