Here's what campus figures had
to say yesterday on rushing:
Onyet Watson, Pi Beta Phi: "Be
cause of strained relationships be
tween the women, we are afraid
even to speak. The elimination of all
those silly rules would le&d to more
natural contact between the mem
bers of the houses and the rushees."
Barbara Perry, Liigunita Court:
"Rushing as it now exists fosters
unnatural relationships between
girls for too long a time. If contact
were permitted sooner and for a
longer length of time, dirty rushing
would be eliminated. Rushing is
supposed to give an opportunity for
the girls to meet each other, but how
can they when they are not even
permitted to talk to each other
three months before pledging?"
Robert Jones, Phi Gamma Delta
pledge: "The rushing system should
be restricted to the first live weeks
of the quarter. The first date should
be an open house during which all
freshmen can go to all the houses
they want to and thus allow them to
become acquainted with the fel
lows. Then the dates should be made
invitational."
Harriet Shepardson, Lagunita
Court, Tri Delt transfer from Min
nesota: "The period of no contact
should be done away with and
pledging should take place earlier in
the fall quarter. More people should
be permitted to pledge so there
would be more houses, at present
impossible."
Henry Halverson, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge: "The present sys
tem is satisfactory but could be im
proved by doing away with special
dates. Open relations should be per
mitted between the men."
Herman Judd, non-organization:
"I know little about the present
system but my general impression is
that rushing should be ended in the
fall quarter. I don't think there
should be any contact save on spe
cific rushing dates to eliminate
strained relations now existing for
so long a period."
