# Hall Advocates Tax Revision
## Centralization of Power Urged in Radio Speech 
### 
j A plea for centralization of taxing
j power and eradication of the present
i inefficient system of duplicate levies
: was made last night by Dr. James
I Kendall Hall, visiting lecturer in
economics, on the Stanford Radio
I Hour.
"The time has passed when fed-
I eral, state, and local governments
may safely go their separate com
petitive ways in dealing with taxa
j tion," he declared. "With the pub
! lie following dictates of individual
ism, opposing centralization and
I standardization, there have evolved
multiplicity of governmental and ad
; ministrative agents with such varia
i tion, duplication, and overlapping of
J structure and function as best to be
described as a chaos of areas, a
' chaos of authorities, and a chaos of
! revenues.
As illustrations Dr. Hall citcd un
equitable double and multiple tax
ation, highly regressive forms of tax
: ation, and dual and multiple admin
istration of the same form of tax.
He advised assignment of all taxes
j to the states and federal govern
\ men Is, excepting only certain local
j taxes.
