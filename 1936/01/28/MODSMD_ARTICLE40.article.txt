"In previous years it has been the
policy of campus publications to
'razz' us," said Managing Janitor
John N. Brown from the newly con
structed custodians' quarter in the
stucco building adjacent to the
power plant and facing the Gym.
"This 'razzing' has made it hard
for the men to feel like custodians
of the students' property. Most of
our men have been with us for
years, and they really appreciate
any courtesies shown them."
"They patiently make 1250 beds,
sweep 20 miles nf sidewalk, and
clean 50 buildings evei'y day, con
tinued Mr. Brown.
The new custodians' edifice looks
like a small edition of Lagunita
Court, with a patio in the center.
The establishment has its own
kitchen, pantry, store-room, show
ers, club room, steam heat, and all
the modern home conveniences.
Al! that is needed to complete
the beauiification of the furnish

! ings of the new janitors' residence
are a few tables, chairs* and
equipment for their club card
room. At present there is $25,000
i invested in the plant.
Spanish in architecture, the new
i hall stretches"behind lawn, flowers,
j and eucalyptus trees. When further
! funds are saved or donated, the
! janitors' quarters will be further
j improved.
The occupants receivc salaries
varying from $45 to $75 a month.
Recently a sociology professor,
in striking at the popular miscon
cepfion that janitors are of neces
sity inferior intellectually, said he
once had a class of janitors and
found them one of the brightest
he had ever taught.
"Besides, they returned the books
! I lent them," he added.
St. Augustine, Fla., oldest city in
j Ihe United States, was founded by
] early Spanish explorers in 1565.
