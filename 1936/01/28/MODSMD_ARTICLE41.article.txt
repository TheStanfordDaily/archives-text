# Dr. Lesley Answers Vox Campi Criticism Of Bookstore Rebates
## Students Will Decide On System at Election 
### 
Pointing out the impractibility
of the Bookstore rebate system,
Professor E. P. Lesley, president
of the Bookstore, answers, in the
third of a series of articles, the
criticisms and suggestions which
have l»ecn made in the Vox Campi
and editorial sections of the
Daily.
"One communication to The Daily j
from Bill Goldner defends the Stan
ford Bookstore rebate plf.ri. Gold- 1
ner demonstrates that the plan is j
equitable; for, although it may be
cumbersome, those who share in j
the rebate likewise share in the ex
pense of the administration. He be
lieves that one who spends from $30 J
to $G0 per year in the Bookstore ap- j
predates 'those small refunds that
should be paid back to the custo
mers.' "
Directors Adopted Plan
The directors of the Bookstore ;
would be the last to disagree with j
this view. They adopted the rebate !
plan and have employed it when- |
ever there were profits to distribute, i
"Retention of the rebate system 1
seems to be a question of practical .
utility rather than one of principle. |
As v/as shown in the Round Table j
Discussion with the Executive Com- !
mittee and as mentioned later in
The Daily, the anticipated profit on
Bookstore sales this year is about
$2700. This is an optimistic esti
mate rather than otherwise. If dis
tributed in rebate to 4000 students,
the average refund would be but 67
cents. The actual refund would be
less, since there are other custo
mers than students."
"Sixty-seven cents seems a small
amount in comparison to the labor
involved in determining the rebates
payable to 4000 persons. It is esti
mated that 15,000 sales tags will be
turned in this year. These must be
sorted and allocated to purchasers.
! The rebate for each person must be
I computed."
Only G7 Cents Per Man
"So far no extra clerical work has
| been employed since all that has
j been done is to take the daily total.
] If rebates are continued, extra help
| will be required. Thus the profit, or
i the amount returnable in rebates,
will be less than it might be if some
j plan were adopted that would in
j volve less accounting. Although a
j rebate of 67 cents is a small thing
I and seemingly not worth the work,
$2,700 might be very useful to an

enterprise of general community
benefit.
"The directors have no wish but
to conduct a sound business that
will realize the purpose for which
the Bookstore was incorporated. To

quote from the Articles of Incorpo
ration—'the purpose for which it
(the Stanford Bookstore) is formed,
is to carry on a general mercantile
business for the accommodation of
the students and the faculty of Ice
land Stanford Junior University.'
Faculty Would Reconsider
"It would perhaps be inequitable,
as Mr. Golden has said, to deprive
faculty and other purchasers of re
bates. However, I believe that the
faculty would willingly forego small
rebates if another plan for disposi
tion of profit, equally beneficial to
the community as a whole, can be
found."

bates. However, I believe that the
faculty would willingly forego small
rebates if another plan for disposi
tion of profit, equally beneficial to
the community as a whole, can be
found."
Pointing out the impractibility
of the Bookstore rebate system,
Professor E. P. Lesley, president
of the Bookstore, answers, in the
third of a series of articles, the
criticisms and suggestions which
have l»ecn made in the Vox Campi
and editorial sections of the
Daily.
"One communication to The Daily j
from Bill Goldner defends the Stan
ford Bookstore rebate plf.ri. Gold- 1
ner demonstrates that the plan is j
equitable; for, although it may be
cumbersome, those who share in j
the rebate likewise share in the ex
pense of the administration. He be
lieves that one who spends from $30 J
to $G0 per year in the Bookstore ap- j
predates 'those small refunds that
should be paid back to the custo
mers.' "
Directors Adopted Plan
The directors of the Bookstore ;
would be the last to disagree with j
this view. They adopted the rebate !
plan and have employed it when- |
ever there were profits to distribute, i
"Retention of the rebate system 1
seems to be a question of practical .
utility rather than one of principle. |
As v/as shown in the Round Table j
Discussion with the Executive Com- !
mittee and as mentioned later in
The Daily, the anticipated profit on
Bookstore sales this year is about
$2700. This is an optimistic esti
mate rather than otherwise. If dis
tributed in rebate to 4000 students,
the average refund would be but 67
cents. The actual refund would be
less, since there are other custo
mers than students."
"Sixty-seven cents seems a small
amount in comparison to the labor
involved in determining the rebates
payable to 4000 persons. It is esti
mated that 15,000 sales tags will be
turned in this year. These must be
sorted and allocated to purchasers.
! The rebate for each person must be
I computed."
Only G7 Cents Per Man
"So far no extra clerical work has
| been employed since all that has
j been done is to take the daily total.
] If rebates are continued, extra help
| will be required. Thus the profit, or
i the amount returnable in rebates,
will be less than it might be if some
j plan were adopted that would in
j volve less accounting. Although a
j rebate of 67 cents is a small thing
I and seemingly not worth the work,
$2,700 might be very useful to an

enterprise of general community
benefit.
"The directors have no wish but
to conduct a sound business that
will realize the purpose for which
the Bookstore was incorporated. To

quote from the Articles of Incorpo
ration—'the purpose for which it
(the Stanford Bookstore) is formed,
is to carry on a general mercantile
business for the accommodation of
the students and the faculty of Ice
land Stanford Junior University.'
Faculty Would Reconsider
"It would perhaps be inequitable,
as Mr. Golden has said, to deprive
faculty and other purchasers of re
bates. However, I believe that the
faculty would willingly forego small
rebates if another plan for disposi
tion of profit, equally beneficial to
the community as a whole, can be
