# Hoopsters Drill for Second Golden Bear Contest
## Hank Luisetti Again Kept from Practice By Old Ankle Injury Sophomore's Score On Saturday Sets Record 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
While Norlhern California scribes
were still talking about their sensa
tional wins over the Trojans and
Plank Luisetti s new conference scor
ing record made last week-end, the
Stanford basketball varsity settled
down yesterday afternoon to pre
paring for game number two with
the Golden Bears of California next
Friday evening in Berkeley.
Coach John Bunn had his hoop
sters drilling on underbaskct
play which showed lip ragged
several times during the two
U.S.C. tilts and which will be so
important against the Bears, who
are lamed for luisky, hard-play
ing guards.
Luisetti was absent from the court
yesterday, due to the badly sprained
ankle which put him off his game
Friday night and held him down to
11 field goals Saturday. But the
sophomore forward, already safely
on top of the conference scoring
column with 83 points in five games,
promises that he will be out with
the squad today.
The San Francisco sport pages
are hailing '"Hoop-'em-Hank's"
:i<> points as a new record for con
ference competition. To date the
only mark that has been dug up
to match Luisetti's is a still (in
validated and 21-year-old record
made by Ad Dewey, present bas
ketball coach at Mcnlo Junior Col
lege.
Dowoy made 33 points when play
ing for Oregon State against Wash
ington in 19J5. But thai was back in
the days when one man, the best,
did all the free-throw shooting for a
team, and many of Dewey's points
came by this route.
Yesterday the Palo Alto Rotary
Club had the Indian varsity as hon
ored guests at their weekly lunch
eon.
