# Frosh Practice 'Sucker Shots'
## Calkins, Kessel in Line As Frosh Combination 
### 
Striving to cut down the number
of missed set-up shots, Jimmy Brad
shaw ran his frosh basketball team
through an offensive drill in practice
yesterday. Regulars and second
stringers worked together, passing
the ball back and forth until it
reached one man under the basket
for a so-called "sucker" goal.
Room for Improvement
The yearlings looked much better
in this important job in their last
two games, but there is still room
for improvement. Phil Zonne and
Dick Neeley have a big advantage
on set-ups because of their height,
but Bradshaw is trying to develop
two more threats in Lyman Calkins
and Jack Kessel.
If he succeeds, the frosh will be
hard to beat, because Pete McAr
thur, the fifth man, is an expert shot
from a point between the foul circle
and center court.
Meet Cal Cubs February f>
Contrary to yesterday's Daily, the
frosh cagers will not meet Califor
nia's Cubs until Thursday, Febru
ary (!. The game that night will be
on the Farmâ€”the first of a three
game series.
This week's opposition will be
furnished by the St. Mary's frosh,
who will tangle with tho Papooses
at 0:30 o'clock Saturday right in ihe
Pavilion as a preliminary to the In
dian-Gael varsity tussle. Nothing is
known as yet about the Moraea
first-year men, but Bradshaw will
scout them today.
