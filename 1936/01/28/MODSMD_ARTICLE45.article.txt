## THEY LEARNED IT DURING THE HALF 
### 
Ever happen to think how much
Stanford's defense improved be
tween the first and second halves
of that U.S.C. triumph last Saturday |
night?
The Trojans were scoring two
to our one before the half time,
not only because their shots were
well aimed, but partially because
they were able to get good posi
tions for those bucket-attempts.
Gracin was clear several times and
sank relatively easy ones. Browning
broke through for his one handers i
and scored them with unfailing ac
curacy. Stanford was badly off on
defense.
Then came the half.
It was a different story daring that
second period; in fact, it was more 1
or less the reverse of the first. U.S.C.
had plenty of difficulty breaking i
clear and the points scored were !
really earned.
But here's the point that most
people don't know. A lot of the
winning of that ball game was
done in the Card dressing room
during half-time. It was then
that Coach John Bunn and the fol - 1
lows made plans for their "transi
tional stratified man-to-man de
fense with zone principle."
No, it's not some term from the j
realm of science but just Bunn's |
joking monicker for the system they i
used. Simply, it's called "team de- |
fense."
Stanford hadn't practiced that
method a very great deal before
the game Saturday. In fact, it J
was really about the first time
they'd put it into play.
During the short 10 minutes of the
mid-game intermission the fellows
learned the system, later to play it
for the first time, and upset U.S.C.
It worked like a charm. Its prin
ciple, a cross between man-to-man j
and zone, had Sam Barry's men
slowed up considerably.
