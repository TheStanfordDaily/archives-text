# THE 						BILL GOES TO DINTY
## 
### 
Coach Bunn is probably tho most
genial fellow you'll ever know. J
Maybe you've found that out al
ready. At any rate, he's always
willing to hand out a good word,
and this week he's feeling especially
good. And we can see why—Stan
ford, two victories; U.S.C., two
losses.
lint lie was jokingly saying yes
terday that he thought he should
send Dinty Moore a bill. It seems
that Dinty was sitting on the
bench right beside him during
those last few hectic minutes.
And in the excitement Dinty
wrung and rcwrung Bunn's trou
sers; practically tore them to
pieces.
But on second thought he decided
not to send Moore a bill. He says he
figures it v/as worth it, every bit.
