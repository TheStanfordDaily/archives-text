# Indian Ruggers Will Meet Olympic Club Squad Saturday
## Reisner Rejoins Team After Trip to Islands 
### 
With Johnny Reisner back on the
squad, the ruggers will be even
stronger than last week when they
completely swamped the Argonauts.
However, even with Reisner, Cap
tain Joe Vigna and Arch Zamloeh in
the field they will have a pletny
tough game with the Olympic Club
fifteen scheduled for Saturday af
ternoon in the Stadium.
All the regulars out for various
injuries including those mentioned
plus Norm Hagcr, Harry Goff, and
Primo Pinotti, reported to Coach
Wylie for scrimmage last night.
Club Is Powerful
Olympic Club is cracked up to be
one of the most powerful aggrega
tions in the Rugby Union. Their
victory over a strong Indian team
last year proved that they are able
to win from Stanford. After losing
to U.S.F. last week they will be in
the right frame of mind to put up a
good fight.
Reisner arrived back on the cam
pus after being with Pop Warner's
team in Hawaii.
Undefeated So Far
So far the rugby team has gone
through a perfect season winning
all three of its games from San
Francisco Blues, Stanford Medics,
and the Argonauts.
Saturday against the Olympic Club
will mark the first time the team
has been out in full strenglh. Vigna's
and Zamlock's head-on collision
kept them from last Saturday's
game. February 8 Stanford ruggers
will play U.S.C.
