# Indian Nine Rests As Tribute to Collins
## 
### 
As tribute to Steve Collins, 1927 j
captain, the Stanford baseball squad i
held no workout yesterday. Prac- I
tice will be resumed today in prep
aration for tomorrow's game with 1
Kenealy's Seals at the Sunken Dia- j
mond.
Coach Harry Wolter is anxious to '
give his infielders a long drill to
correct the rather sloppy fielding
exhibited against A1 Erie's All-Stars
Saturday.
