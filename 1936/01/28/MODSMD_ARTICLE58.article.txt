# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Good Speaker Might Somewhat Offset Indifference Noted by Sage White 
### 
When William Allen White quipped "a
snap two-unit course in newspaper reading,"
as a suggestion to combat the apathy of col
lege students toward politics, he was uttering
words of wisdom as well.
He showed his grasp of the problem; that
he knew the average collegian couldn't he
made to give a hoot about politics unless it
was sugar-coated and fed him in minute
doses.
Even with the bonus passed, Al Smith hurl
ing the gauntlet, the AAA defunct, the Town
send Plan steaming ahead, and November
getting momentarily nearer, the Farm's in
terest in things political is simply non-ex
istent.
II might almost he worth while to take Mr.
White seriously and institute a course in
newspaper reading so that there might be at
least a rustle of the political breezes blowing
011 the campus that proclaims itself the home
of the winds of freedom.
In lieu of such an unorthodox academic
step, the authorities might try the easier
method of calling an occasional all-University

assembly and getting some prominent speaker
to tell of the problems and events of this
troubled old world.
If no national figure is to be quickly found
in these parts, maybe the Administration
could ask one of the livelier and close-to-the
nevvs campus professors to mount the ros
trum and try to fan a little interest in the
world around us.
This quarter no assembly has been called.
Last quarter's assembly program was sadly
low in outside speakers with the A.S.S.U.
assembly and the Administration's taking up
two-thirds of the quarter's quota.
Only topical lecture recently has been by
Professor Lutz on the European crisis. Hut
that was on Tuesday night, and Tuesday
night lectures have been so conspicuously dull
in the past, that students have long since got
ten out of the habit of attending them.
Mr. White's telling remark, which showed
how well he knew the political disinterest
marking American campuses, should be ac
cepted as a challenge.
