# Go to It, Alumni But Keep It Clean
## 
### 
More and more is the question of subsidi
zation of athletes being subjected to frank
discussion among university athletic repre
sentatives. Very little of a constructive na
ture, however, has been accomplished to date.
The main reason for this is that the col
leges themselves are not in a position to stamp
out hypocrisy or to formulate workable agree
ments. The universities can only recommend
—they cannot enforce rules that are as easy
to evade as attempts to regulate the aiding of
athletes.
Subsequent compliance with the recom
mendations will be left with the individuals
responsible for infractions—the greater por
tion of these being alumni.
The solution, then, must be worked out by
the alumni, and to be practical it must be on
a bilateral agreement basis between alumni
associations or influential graduates of two
competing schools.
First of all, these groups must agree to
compromise their interests; next, they must,
by "gentlemen's agreements" decide on the
policy to be followed—strict amateurism or
some certain degree of professionalism.
Although it will be difficult, it will not be
impossible to efTect this compromise. Fur
thermore, as the alumni eventually will come
to realize, a program of open subsidization not
only would imperil the game itself, but it

would do their own interests no good what
ever. After all, if no one bought athletes, the
situation would he praelically the same as if
everyone did.
