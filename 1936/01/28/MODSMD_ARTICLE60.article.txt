HONOR WITHOUT FAME
To be admired ... to be pitied ... to be ignored?
. . . How should we consider these student body lead
ers whom we don't know.
* * * *
The fortunes of campus political victories are sorry
enough when taken all together, but when the one
fortune of potential fame is taken by itself, its con
sequence is to be compared to a slight breeze wafting
through the clock tower. Student body officers at Stan
ford simply are not known. If that isn't believed, ask
a few questions here and there.
* * * *
Who is president of the student body? (Typical
answer:) "Let's see—it isn't Bill Corbus any more.
I forget who did win that election." There—it's just a
matter of who won an election. The answer, diligent
Daily readers know, is Wallace S. Brooke. But of
those who do know the answer, who would know the
gentleman on sight? Not I, for one.

And who is vice-president of the student body, who
is the student manager, who is chairman of Women's
Council, Women's Conference, Pan-Hellenic? Those
five of the illustrious could go unrecognized in any
representative campus gathering. They are, so the
Bawlout says, in the order named: Jacqueline Flan
ders, Bob Gros, Margaret Ann Schaeffer. Mercedes
Bergmann, and Jeanne Keesling. But if one out of
20 students would know any of these officers upon
sight, this doubter would be surprised.

Fortune laughed on the President of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. When the rushing pot boiled over,
Ed Littlefield had the opportunity to make public
statements for days. No graphic art accompanied the
publicity, however, so Ed merely has a famous name
and an unfamous face. But who knows who is presi
dent of the senior class? Ten seniors when ques
tioned didn't know. The answer is: Woody Adams,
the football player.

Unrecognized public officers! Literally unrecog
nized. We would like to say the situation is deplor
able, but it isn't. We would like to say the situation
is fine, but it isn't. After all, Palm Drive speeders still
get fined in spite of the fact that the chairman's public
acquaintance is limited. And the Ex Committee still
grants dance dates in spite of the fact that you
wouldn't know an Ex Committee member from the
intra-mural horse shoe champ if you met one on the
street. It's too bad, though, that some of these polit
ical figures who really worked hard to get elected or
appointed, can't be recognized by their titles and
have the satisfaction of thinking of the Cellar as a
place where they can go and have ogling sophomores
point and whisper that "there goes that such-and
such-so-and-so, chairman of the whudayucallit com
mittee.''

But best of all, yes, best of all is the fact that not
one in a hundred can connect a face with the name
that is signed below. That fact makes things like
this possible.
