Harlc, liai'lc, the Gang's All Here
The wheels of industry slowed down to a stand
still yesterday. There was a weeping and a wiiiling
through Stanford's musty halls. The A.S.S.U. office
ceased to function, the Rally Committee ceased rally
ing, the swimming team quit swimming and drowned,
the football team turned around and decided to go
back to the islands, and the election committee stuffed
their own ballot box. And why, my pretties? And
why?—a pertain eligible Pi Phi and a certain eligible
butchelor of the Sigma Chi menage announced their
engagement Sunday noon.
Of course, the man being a Sigma Chi of note, who
had never even had a date with the muchly-sought
after Pi Phi, people immediately began to cry, "Dirty
Rushing!"
But it is Our Hasher's suggestion that the football
team come back to the Farm (unless ihey feel too
lonesome and unacquainted here), and the swimming
team undrown itself. Because it is all a huge hoe-axe,
a grim jest.
The monkey business started at the Pledge Prom.
Through the peculiar process known only to Pi Phis,
the lady wangled the gentleman's fraternity pin away
from him and added it to her historic, old collection.
Now, this rushing chairman was a man with fight.
He wasn't going to follow the way of all flashes. Dur
ing the course of the week, he demanded his pin
back. But by that peculiar process known only to Pi
Phis, she eluded his request.
Taking into consideration the obligations entailed,
the gentleman bought five pounds of candy, sent it up
to the Pi Phi house at noon Sunday.
While the housemother was reading the lengthy
explanatory note, two Pi Phis blushed, and then un
blushed when they found it was not for them.
One hour later, two choice boxes of cigars arrived
at the Sigma Chi house and were passed around. Eye
brows were raised all over the campus. People could
not quite understand it. A box of beets, rutabagas,
and sour grapes were sent to the lady from a dis
appointed Phi Delt, signed, "The Light that Failed."
But the clear, lucid light on the whole jumbled
affair was shed yesterday, when the Sigma Chi rush
ing chairman confessed the whole story to Our Hasher.
The Sigma Chi is a most unusual man. He is the
only man on the campus who doesn't want to be
engaged to this Pi Phi. "All I want is my pin back,"
he said.
At a late hour last night, as the saying goes, the
Pi Phi still had possession of the Sigma Chi pin.

back. But by that peculiar process known only to Pi
Phis, she eluded his request.
Taking into consideration the obligations entailed,
the gentleman bought five pounds of candy, sent it up
to the Pi Phi house at noon Sunday.
While the housemother was reading the lengthy
explanatory note, two Pi Phis blushed, and then un
blushed when they found it was not for them.
One hour later, two choice boxes of cigars arrived
at the Sigma Chi house and were passed around. Eye
brows were raised all over the campus. People could
not quite understand it. A box of beets, rutabagas,
and sour grapes were sent to the lady from a dis
appointed Phi Delt, signed, "The Light that Failed."
But the clear, lucid light on the whole jumbled
affair was shed yesterday, when the Sigma Chi rush
ing chairman confessed the whole story to Our Hasher.
The Sigma Chi is a most unusual man. He is the
only man on the campus who doesn't want to be
engaged to this Pi Phi. "All I want is my pin back,"
he said.
At a late hour last night, as the saying goes, the
Pi Phi still had possession of the Sigma Chi pin.
Harlc, liai'lc, the Gang's All Here
The wheels of industry slowed down to a stand
still yesterday. There was a weeping and a wiiiling
through Stanford's musty halls. The A.S.S.U. office
ceased to function, the Rally Committee ceased rally
ing, the swimming team quit swimming and drowned,
the football team turned around and decided to go
back to the islands, and the election committee stuffed
their own ballot box. And why, my pretties? And
why?—a pertain eligible Pi Phi and a certain eligible
butchelor of the Sigma Chi menage announced their
engagement Sunday noon.
Of course, the man being a Sigma Chi of note, who
had never even had a date with the muchly-sought
after Pi Phi, people immediately began to cry, "Dirty
Rushing!"
But it is Our Hasher's suggestion that the football
team come back to the Farm (unless ihey feel too
lonesome and unacquainted here), and the swimming
team undrown itself. Because it is all a huge hoe-axe,
a grim jest.
The monkey business started at the Pledge Prom.
Through the peculiar process known only to Pi Phis,
the lady wangled the gentleman's fraternity pin away
from him and added it to her historic, old collection.
Now, this rushing chairman was a man with fight.
He wasn't going to follow the way of all flashes. Dur
ing the course of the week, he demanded his pin
back. But by that peculiar process known only to Pi
Phis, she eluded his request.
Taking into consideration the obligations entailed,
the gentleman bought five pounds of candy, sent it up
