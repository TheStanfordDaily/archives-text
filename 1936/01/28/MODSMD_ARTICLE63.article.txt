j . . . A new idea in movie shorts is
the French series of famous concert j
\ artists, such as Kreisler, Paderew
ski, etc., playing short musical
. numbers.
I MOVIE STUFF: Universal has
had tough luck with "Show Boat."
... First made in a silent, but
talkies came in in the middle, so
) they had to add dubbed sound and
; talking sequences . . . Now ready
[ to release remake, the music is j
| banned from the air 'cause Warner's ;
owns it, thus eliminating valuable
i Plug.
MORE FLICKERS: They're talk

j . . . "Follow the Fleet," new Astaire-
Rogers pic, is ready for release.
. . . The British Broadcasting Cor

MUSIC NOTES: The dance team j
i of Veloz and Yolanda bring their i
I swell orchestra, conducted by Shcp
Fields, to the L.A. Ambassador next !
I Monday . . . That means they'll
i broadcast nightly over NBC . . . !
' Because Eddie Duchin's contract

I the fact he didn't have to broad- j
j cast . . . Now they've got him back
! in the show.

L.A. station for the past year . . .
Governor Talmadge of Georgia, re
fused time by NBC and CBS for his i
"Jeffcrsonian Democrats" conven
tion, now wants to pipe the thing to
that super-power Mexican station.
WRIST SLAP: Because Warner

many a dirty crack, latter organ- |
ization has refused to license War- j
ner's station, KFWB, to use its mu- j
sic . . . And since most stations can j
use ASCAP tunes but not Warner's,
that puts the station in a position
just exactly opposite from the rest
of the nation's stations.
