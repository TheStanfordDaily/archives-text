"POWERFUL AMERICA: OUR
PLACE IN A REARMING
WORLD," by Eugene J. Young, |
(Stokes).
There is a delicate balance be- j
tween American idealism and the :
normal cynicism of the newspaper >
man in Eugene J. Young's "Power- |
ful America: Our Place in a Re- j
arming World," published today. I
That is one thing which makes the 1
book more readable than most sim
ilar analyses.
Mr. Young is cable editor of the
New York Times, incontcstably one
of the great papers of the world.
Mr. Young is in a position to pick
up a good deal of "inside" informa
tion — which usually means un
printed information. He includes
(for example) the recently denied i
story of the late Adolph Ochs and 1
the alleged suggestion of Lord Lee j
that America and Britain divide the |
naval policing of the world.
But these things are curiously un- I
important in the scheme of the book. |
Mr. Young states his scheme and
his purpose thus:
"To analyze, as briefly as pos
sible, the practical reasons for the
ineffectiveness of the international
instrumentalities we had a part in
creating; to outline the position in
which we now find ourselves in the
light of our national and world pol
icies; to review the problems with
which we shall be confronted; and !
to set forth the reasons why the j
writer believes that in the interest '
of ourselves and the world we j
should resume and continue a
strong, realistic, nationalistic de
velopment of the principles and
practices on which we have built
our civilization and have extended
our influence for a century and a
half."

Mr. Young concludes that one of
our great dangers is our "refusal to J
face world facts practically." He be- !
lieves that if we insist on allowing j
others to "attend to the disorders
of the world" we are lost. He cites
the incredible nonsense we have
swallowed about the war debts as
one example of how we in our blind
ness have been led around by the
nose. We shall have to "school our
selves in the realities," as the Brit
ish, French and others have done;
leave off our belief in slogans and
dogmas and cure-alls. We shall
have, in a phrase, to wake up to
common sense.
But Mr. Young doesn't seem too
sure that we will do all this.

"POWERFUL AMERICA: OUR
PLACE IN A REARMING
WORLD," by Eugene J. Young, |
(Stokes).
There is a delicate balance be- j
tween American idealism and the :
normal cynicism of the newspaper >
man in Eugene J. Young's "Power- |
ful America: Our Place in a Re- j
arming World," published today. I
That is one thing which makes the 1
book more readable than most sim
ilar analyses.
Mr. Young is cable editor of the
New York Times, incontcstably one
of the great papers of the world.
Mr. Young is in a position to pick
up a good deal of "inside" informa
tion — which usually means un
printed information. He includes
(for example) the recently denied i
story of the late Adolph Ochs and 1
the alleged suggestion of Lord Lee j
that America and Britain divide the |
naval policing of the world.
But these things are curiously un- I
important in the scheme of the book. |
Mr. Young states his scheme and
his purpose thus:
"To analyze, as briefly as pos
sible, the practical reasons for the
ineffectiveness of the international
instrumentalities we had a part in
creating; to outline the position in
which we now find ourselves in the
light of our national and world pol
icies; to review the problems with
which we shall be confronted; and !
to set forth the reasons why the j
writer believes that in the interest '
of ourselves and the world we j
should resume and continue a
strong, realistic, nationalistic de
velopment of the principles and
practices on which we have built
our civilization and have extended
our influence for a century and a
half."

Mr. Young concludes that one of
our great dangers is our "refusal to J
face world facts practically." He be- !
lieves that if we insist on allowing j
others to "attend to the disorders
of the world" we are lost. He cites
the incredible nonsense we have
swallowed about the war debts as
one example of how we in our blind
ness have been led around by the
nose. We shall have to "school our
selves in the realities," as the Brit
ish, French and others have done;
leave off our belief in slogans and
dogmas and cure-alls. We shall
have, in a phrase, to wake up to
common sense.
But Mr. Young doesn't seem too
sure that we will do all this.
