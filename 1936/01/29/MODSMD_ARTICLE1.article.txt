# Ex Committee To Give Awards to Injured Players
## Bookstore Rebates Will Be Settled in February Student Body Election 
### 
By Annalce Whitmore
Five by-laws, six other decisions,
and an appointment were passed j
last night by an almost complete j
Ex Committee, meeting with a
quorum for the first time this quar- j
ter.
INJURED PLAYERS will be en-|
titled to a sport award in the future,
as the many-times-tabled by-law J
was passed unanimously. It pro- j
vides that if a man would have j
earned a letter, and was deprived of !
competition by an injury, the award !
could be made in addition to the j
three exceptional awards already
allowed.
PUBLICATIONS COUNCIL
amendment, providing that Daily
staff members who resign or are j
suspended should lose their vote, j
was approved.
MANAGING EDITOR of the
Daily can not run for the editorship j
after this quarter, according to the !
third by-law passed. If the editor- ,
ship is vacated during the quarter j
he takes over the paper for the rest ■
of the volume.
FOURTH BY-LAW was the pro
vision that the managing editor's j
salary should be raised from 20 to |
25 dollars a month. "The man would j
only be getting about 7 cents an hour \
even then — he's certainly worth
that," said John Kline.
"All salaries are getting 100 high. |
This might precipitate a shake-up," j
prophesied Bob Gros. Ex Commit- j
tee disagreed. "Give 'im his five'
dollars," they decided.
ELECTION BOARD vacancy left
by Bud Ncely will be filled by Dave !
Allison. "He's safe —that leaves the ;
Row-llall balance," advised Chair
man Jim Ludlam.
TWO PERFORMANCES of "Paths j
of Glory" will not be given. The I
play was to be presented both Wed
nesday and Friday if the ticket sale '
was large enough.
"There's a dance drama that night !
—we can't give 'em a closed date," |
discovered Fullenwider. "It's a bad
idea anyway," concurred the legis- !
lators.
BOOKSTORE REBATES will be
voted upon in the February elec* ,
tion. Possible alternatives up for
student body decision will be giving j
the money to the Student Aid Fund;
creating a loan library; keeping the
sum as a rebate; or writing in orig- !
inal suggestions.
A PRE-PLAY JOLLY-UP will
be sponsored this Thursday by the
Cardinals, with Ex Committee's ap
proval. Admission will be 10 cents,
and the dance is to be held from 7
to 8 in the Women's Gym. Fred
Nagcl's orchestra will donate music
if the union agrees. All funds will
be turned over to the Warm Springs
Fund.
A.S.S.U. ASSEMBLY featuring
Christie Walsh, Pop Warner, and.
Howard Jones, of the All-Ameri- '
can Board, will probably be held at |
night to avoid excuring more class- I
es. It may be he ld as a rally in the |
pavilion.
The cup for All-American cap
tainship will be awarded to Bobby
