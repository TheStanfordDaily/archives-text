# Jeanne Keesling Outlines Proposed Rushing Changes
## Pan-Hell Head 
### 
"There are many parts of the
; rushing system which must be
changed in order to make the con
j tact between Row women and
Roble women natural," said Jeanne
Keesling, president of Panhellenic
Council, in an interview yesterday.
Among those provisions which she
outlined as "unnatural" was the
! clause which stipulates that Row
women may walk with freshmen
women to the post office, but not
further."
Suggested Changes
Pan-Hellenic Council, meeting
each week in an attempt to smooth
' out the present rushing difficulties,
has been concerned with ironing
; out certain unsatisfactory parts of
the actual bidding contract. When
this work hss been done, according
to the president, the group will con
cern itself primarily with plans for a
better rushing period. A tentative
: plan which will be under considera
j tion is that the rushing period
would cover ten days instead of the
present week, and this period would
' be divided into four periods, the

first to include four dinners, the sec
ond three, the third two, and the
final period one preference night
dinner.
Move Period Ahead
It hits been suggested, said Miss
Keesling, that the rushing period be
moved ahead into the autumn quar
ter, but this is not looked upon wilh
approval by the University. How
ever, in the proposed change, the
houses would have more opportu
nty to see their rushees, and the
rushces would be able to go to more
houses up until the last right.
Tlie possibility of rushing during
summer and Christmas vacations is
definitely out, and we will have to
"suggest" to the alumnae that they
do not give rushing parties, said
Miss Keesling. "Any really 'open'
system," she said, "would result in
cut-throat rushing. It is evident,
however, that there must be some
changes in the system in order to
provide for more natural contact
between sorority women and Roble
women."
