# Sound Film Will Be Shown Today
## Travelogue Will Be Given in Little Theater 
### 
A sound film of modern Germany, i
taken at the time of the Carl Schurz j
tour for American professors in |
the summer of 1934, will be shown
in the Little Theater at 4:15 o'clock
this afternoon.
Stanford's representatives on the
trip, which included university
professors, presidents, deans, and
a few students, were Professors
William A. Cooper, emeritus, of
German, and Raymond I). Harri
man of classics.
On their conducted tour through j
the whole of Germany, the visitors j
went from the Bremen direct to!
Berlin upon landing, then across the
Polish corridor to Danzig. Stopping
in the quaint north German towns
of Marienburg and Konigsburg, they
came into Bavaria by way of Dres
den, Leipzig, and Weimar.
The motion pictures were taken
by the Carl Schurz foundation and j
a copy of the films presented to
each university represented. At
the last minute a special projector
had to be ordered from San Fran- l
cisco to fit the 16-millimeter sound j
film.
The program is presented by the j
Department, of Germanic Languages
and is free for all those interested. |
