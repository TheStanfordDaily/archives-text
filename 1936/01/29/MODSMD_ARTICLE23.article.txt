# Stanford is Sinking— But Only Geographically

Our campus is sinking beneath
us, slowly but surely.
In fact, a large slice of the Santa
Clara Valley is sinking at a rate
which, though it may seem slow in
terms of everyday things, is un
precedented in the knowledge of
man, according to C. E. Tolman,
professor of economic geology.
"This is the first large scalc
rapid sinking ever to he measured
by precise leveling," said Profes
sor Tolman. "That's what makes
it so interesting. Such movements
may have occurred before, hut
never where there were accurate
surveys to indicate them."
Between 1912, when the first
transcontinental survey was com
pleted. linking the Pacific Coast
with the East, and 1932, when the
first cheek was run on it. the level
ing station in San Jose sanit 3'£ feet.
A check along the Peninsular lino
of the Southern Pacific in 1933
showed that sinee 1912 San Jose had
sunk 4 feet, Palo Alto 1.6 feet,
Menlo Park .75 feet. Redwood City
none. In the single year 1934 San
Jose sank another foot.
The area affected is quite small.
Professor Tolman says he cannot
state the exact sire or shape of the
sinking block until the transverse

(east-west) lines surveyed by the
United Stales Coast and Geodetic
Survey can be checked. But he be
lieves the section is approximately a
long rectangle, nearly parallel to
the west, edge of the Bay, about 40
miles long, and about 5 miles wide.
What causes this phenomenal
sinking is the question which
puzzles Professor Tolnian. He
says that many possible explana
tions have been olTered, hut he
will not hazard any conclusion
until the movement can he studied
for a while.
One of the possibilities is that the
pumping out of the ground w;iter
through wells has allowed the layer
of alluvium above to settle. In this
case the plan of the Santa Clara
Water District to raise the ground
water level by the gradual seepage
from five dams which have just been
completed at different points in the
valley may very possibly retard or
stop the sinking.
Another possibility is that bed
rock beneath the sinking block is
actually being distorted. If this is
the case, it may imply that strain
energy is being stored up. and there
by be closely related to any future
earthquake.
