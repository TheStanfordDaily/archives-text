# Jim Hill, Marshall Dill Discuss 'Culture' With Visitors in 'Split' Meet
## 
### 
"Does our present system of living
spell the doom of culture?" This
is the perplexing question Stanford
debaters, Jim Hill and Marshall Dill,
Joffre debate winner, will discuss
at 8 o'clock tonight when they split
teams with University of Melbourne
orators in a forensic meet in the
Little Theater.
The first man to represent Stan
ford against Oxford, Robert M.C.
Littler, will be chairman. It is
apropos of the occasion that Lit
tler should hold this position as
he was associate debate coach
when Stanford first met an Aus
tralian team in 1927. He is at pre
sent in charge of speakers for the
state Republican convention.
According to Coach Lee Chapin,
the debate should be lively and in
teresting as the subject is quite dif
ferent from the usual constitutional
topics. He also adds that Dill and
Hill besides having an excellent
command of English, promise to
bring in a considerable amount of
wit and humor.
A telegram was sent to team man
ager Wayne Richardson staling that
Nevil Stuart, Melbourne speaker,
may not be able to attend as he was
"slightly indisposed" from his re
cent ocean voyage. However, his
colleague, C. G. McAuliffe, will ap
pear. Bob Mallet, prominent Stan
ford debater, may be substituted
for Stuart.
Marshall Dill. Stanford, and C.
CJ. McAuliffe, Melbourne, will be
paired upholding the affirmative
while Hill and Stuart, or Mallet,
will take the negative. Each spea
ker will be allowed a total of fif
teen minutes, arranging his con
structive and rebuttal relatively.
The two Australians besides having
an outstanding record in debating,
hold numerous honors in other fields.
They are touring the United States
lecturing and debating.
No decision will be' made, although
the best speaker will be chosen by
the audience. The meet is open
to the public. As an innovation,
the speakers will be split. The main
reason given for this is that Dill
and Hill wanted to take opposite
sides of the question.
