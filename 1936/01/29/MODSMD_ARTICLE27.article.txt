# Veterans Warned Against Wasting Bonus Cash

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (/P). —
Presses thundered and an army of
clerks toiled today as the govern
ment tackled the task of paying off
3,518,191 World War bonuses—the
most tremendous job of its kind in
history.
Even as he threw the pay-off
machinery into gear, President
Roosevelt issued an appeal say
ing that'unless veterans need the
money for some "permanently
useful purpose," they should re
tain as nest eggs the cashable
"baby bonds" which Congress
voted them over the executive's
veto.
The White House and command
ers of major veterans' organizations
joined in a statement warning
against the "frittering away of
cash."
Silent on the question of new
taxes to finance the $2,491,000,000
bonus bill, the White House had
moved to comply with the "man
date" of Congress soon after the
Senate wrote the measure into
law yesterday, 70 to 19. The
president ordered his subordinates
to carry out the act "as expedi
tiously as accuracy will permit"
From 2500 to 3000 new govern
ment workers are to be hired for
the task at a cost of about $7,500,-
000.
All last night, presses at the gov
ernment printing office roared. By
today they had turned out 2,500,000
application blanks and were still
rolling.
Within 24 hours, distribution of
these blanks will begin through 50
offices of the veterans' administra
tion, ex-soldiers' organizations, and
some members of Congress. By
filling them out, attaching their
fingerprints and filing them with the
veterans' administration, ex-soldiers
will formally apply for the $50 bonds.
Under the new law, these bonds may
be cashed at local post offices be
ginning next Jupe 15 or held to ob
tain 3 per cent interest.
