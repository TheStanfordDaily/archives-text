Question: What is your opinion on
the proposed change in the commit
tee of making representation by
groups instead of by classes?
Phil Coghlan, head of Rally Com
mittee: "I am against changing the
present set-up. The system covers
all groups, if changed, there would
be an overlapping and consequently
double representation."
Betty Grover, junior representa
tive on Ex Committee: "I am in
favor of a plan where activities such
as dramatics could be represented.
This would make for a better co
ordination between the campus
groups, and also change a system
where class representation does not
mean very much."
Jean Anderson, senior representa
tive on Ex Committee: "I am against
the plan because representation by
smaller groups would decrease the
total representation of those on the
campus. As it is now all have a
chance."
Guy Hagerty, sophomore class
president: "I am against it for two
reasons. First, it would be too un
wieldy and, second, it would give
greater opportunity for greater po
litical pressure."
