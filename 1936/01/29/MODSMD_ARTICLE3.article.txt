little Bobby Franks, died today after ;
being stabbed by a fellow convict j
at the state penitentiary here.
The injuries were inflicted by ;
James Day, serving time for lar- {

Loeb's jugular vein was severed 1
by one of the stab wounds, officials !
said, and he was unconscious ex- '
eept for a few seconds until his
death.
Only once did he arouse himself \
in the two hours that followed the !
stabbing. He said to Warden Jo- j
scph Ragen:
"I'll make it—"
Loeb's brother, Ernest, of Chicago,
was at his side when he died.
Loeb was attended by his fain- j
ily physician, a member of the
staff of the Michael Reese Hospi- i
tal in Chicago, in addition to the
prison doctor.
Loeb bled profusely from gashes j
in the neck, shoulder, and abdomen, j
The most dangerous was a six-inch
abdominal cut.
"It was just a fight," Warden Jo- t
seph Ragen said that Day told him j
before lapsing into a sullen silence. I
