# New Dealers Call Al Smith Reactionary
## Ickes Belittles Damage Created by 'Walk Out' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jun. 28 (/P).â€”De
picting Alfred E. Smith as now an
apo.stle of reaction, New Deal ad
herents contended today any Demo
cratic losses he would cause the
administration in November would
be overbalanced by Republican lib
eral support.
Secretary Ickes, in press con
ference, and John L. Lewis, ad
dressing the United Mine Work
ers as president, both expressed
the view that Smith had gone
hack on principles he long held
sacred.
"The heart of the Progressive
movement has been in the Middle
West and Far West," said Ickes.
"I can't quite see much of the
conservative following in (hat
section."
Instead of following Smith on
"a walk" if President Roosevelt is
renominated, he said middlewestern
and far western liberals were "quite
likely to do the contrary."
