# Davis Talks on American Speech
## Tuesday Evening Lecture Features Editor

The picturesque quality of every
day American speech was forcibly
revealed last night by Professor
W. H. Davis, etymologist and editor
of the Stanford University Press,
who spoke in the little Theater on
the derivation of common figures of
speech.
"Back-scratching," "raising a
howl," "bearding the lion in his
den," "cut-throat competition"
and many other expressions which
we employ automatically were
used by our ancestors the cave
men with literal intent, Dr. Davis
pointed out.
Vestiges of a rather higher civ
ilization are such phrases as "from
hand to mouth," "up one's sleeve,"
"the fly in the ointment," "to go
over with a fine-tooth comb," and
"raise the roof."
Not from the age of the automo
bile comes the expression "to blow
one's own horn," but from ancient
Rome when the absence of a lackey
to herald a citizen's approach
evinced that figure of speech.
Disproved scientific theories are
still preserved in phrases like "the
four corners of the earth," "jump
ing off place," "over the edge,"
"seventh heaven" and "celestial
music," which originates not from
a poetic conception of angelic con
certs, but from the old belief that
the universe was a system of con
centric spheres. 4
Sea expressions which have been
incorporated into the language are:
"to walk the plank," "a whale of
a ," "to pour oil on troubled
water," "three sheets to the wind,"
and "to give a wide berth to ."
Professor Davis, who had classi
fied more than 2500 of these phrases,
urges that they be employed lest
our "unimaginative diction be ren
dered pale and drab."
