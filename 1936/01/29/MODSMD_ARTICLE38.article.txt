# Bookstore May Give Surplus to New Theatre
## Profits May Be Donated To Student Aid Budget 
### 
Considering several plans, other
than the rebate system, which have
been suggested for distributing the
Bookstore profits, Professor E. P.
Lesley, president of the Bookstore,
advises, in the fourth of a series of
articles, that student voters give
their attention in the coming elec
tions.
"Two methods, other than the
rebate, for disposing of Stanford
Bookstore profit have gained fa
vorable comment. They are
maintenance of a free circulat
ing library and annual donations
to the operating budget of the
Commission for Student Aid. A
third plan, gifts to the projected
outdoor theater, has been sug
gested.
"Which of these plans, if any, may
be more desirable than the rebate,
the directors of the Bookstore feel
is for the students to decide. In the
interests of a definite expression of
opinion, we hope that every student
v/ill consider the propositions on
the preferential ballot, and mark the '
ballot.
"In the Stanford Daily account
of the round table discussion with
the Executive Committee, I was
alleged to have explained that
'the hoard will not necessarily
follow the student body vote.'
Those may have been the words.
They do not preclude misunder
standing. My meaning was that
the board is not legally bound to
follow a plan for which the stu
dent body may vote.
"There can be no question, how
ever, that having asked for an ex- j
pression of opinion by the student
body, the board will be morally ob
ligated to follow that opinion, pro
vided only that the preferred plan
is one that v/ill help realize the pur- |
pose for which the Bookstore was
incorporated. The three plans pro
posed are clearly for community
henefit or for aid to education. They I
thus qualify under the above.
The board has no pre-election
propaganda in support of any par- ,
tieular proposal." I
