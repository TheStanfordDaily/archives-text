# Zonne, Robertson May Start In Bear Hoop Game
## Stoefen, Moore Fight for First String Positions Calderwood, Guard, Is Sure To Be in Line-up 
### Gordy Frost 
Two guard-center combinations
wore having their own private little
battle on Stanford's hardwood court
last night as Coach John Bunn jug
gled and re juggled to find his best
starting quintet to pit against Cali
fornia across the bay Friday eve
ning.
Jack Calderwood, by virtue of
his super play last week-end, lias
landed a steady job at guard, but
1 lie other guard position and the
center bole are still wide open.
The (v/o competing combinations,
Dinly Moore and Art Stoefen on
one side, and Bob Zonne and Sparky
Robertson on the other, are set to
decide it for themselves by Friday.
Last night the Zonne-Robertson
forces were on top. Sparky still
showed the "punch" that distin
guished him Saturday night against
U.S.C. and Zonne's rebound efforts
were consistently good, as Bunn ran
them against a string of seconds us
ing the California grapevine style of
attack.
Moore nnil Stoefen still are oIY
top form. Bunn believes he would
probably start the Zonne-Robert
son team if the game were tonight.
But under the circumstances Dinly
and Art may pull a comeback late
in tin- week to earn them the call
on Friday.
At any rate, it's no longer a case
of five students for five positions on
Stanford's team. Here are seven
men, and perhaps two or three more,
who would be welcomed on any
man's ball club. This year Stanford
can pick her "hot" combinations.
