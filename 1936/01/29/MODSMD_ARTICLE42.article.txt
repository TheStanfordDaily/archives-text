bit" ran his charges through another
drill on attack yesterday, with the

set, man-for-man defense put up
by the reserves.
Defense was stressed earlier in
the scamn, wilh fairly successful re

High.

missed under-basket shots. They
didn't look too good in yesterday's
session, but they never have in prac
tice. They .still manage to win their
games.
