WIIY STANFORD WON
IN THE BOWL

We've been stepped on lately for
turning back to football talk when
gridiron fever is rightfully gone, but
today a little piece comes to our at
tention written by Maxwell Stiles,
one of Los Angeles' ace sports
scribes, which provokes reply.
Stiles writes about Stanford play
ers' betting on the Rose Bowl out
come. Says he:
"Now the secret is out — why
Stanford played such super
human football in the Rose Bowl.''
"Since the game I have been
told by four different people, each
close to the Stanford team, that
the squad as a whole won an ag
gregate (( f $15.00(1 on the Pasadena
game.
"The story as it comes to me—
it differs not in the slightest as it
comes in from four separate
sources—is that the Indians were
so determined to win, so certain
that they would, that they dug
down and raised pennies until it
hurt. Keith Topping, who playetS
so line a game at right end, is said
to have mortgaged a house in
Pasadena in order to put up money
on the game. I am told that Wes
Muller, who recovered the S.M.U.
fumble on the Stanford five-yard
line, personally won $500 on the
game.
"No wonder the hoys played
like maniacs!"
On that last point we're apt to
disagree with Stiles. We think he
has things backward.
Yes, we admit that the Stanford
team had money on the game,
though not by any means as much
as he testifies. Only one fellow we
know of had more than 100 stones
on the line and if there were more,
the aggregate comes far from
$15,000.
But the reason they played
such "super-human football" was
because they went to Pasadena to
play that way. When they got
there they realized that they had
to win, and thus put money on the
game.
It was not a case of winning the
game for the money; rather, it was
a case of being put on the spot, be
ing literally forced to come through
with a victory after nearly every
newspaper on the Coast had de
manded in effect that "Stanford shall
not let us down this time."
Then they realized that they
would win or know the reason why.
It was afte that was decided that
they backed themselves up with
coin.
The boys played like maniacs be
cause they had to beat S.M.U. That
was all-important. Their best came
second. —Frost
