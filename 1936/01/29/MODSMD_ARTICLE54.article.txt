# Bunn Refutes Barry's Charges
## 
### 
Charges by Coach Sam Barry of
U.S.C. lhat Hank LuisetU scored
most of his points last week-end by
illegally shoving Eddie Oram with
his shoulder were answered yester
day by Coach John Bunn.
"It's ridiculous," he said. "Luisctti
doesn't play that kind of ball. I can
i understand Barry's and Oram's
feelings, though, as I have tried to
guard Luisetti myself on that par
ticular play in practice, and have
! found it practically impossible."
Barry had unleashed himself as
I follows: "Don't get the idea I'm
discrediting that lad Luisetti; he's
the finest player I've seen from a
Bay Region school. But with re
j spectable officiating, Luisetti never
| would have been able to go on that
rampage. You can bet he won't get
away with anything like that when
j Stanford comes down here . . . we'll
have some decent officiating."
