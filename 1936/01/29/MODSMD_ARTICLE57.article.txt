# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Two Alternatives Open if Committee Agrees on Autumn Quarter Rushing 
### 
Interfralernily Hoard's special investigat
ing committee reports progress in its program
to draft a new set of rushing rules, but al
though the committee hints that several ma
jor changes are contemplated, it prefers to
remain silent on the details until the final
draft is approved.
Since fraternity opinion is opposed to le
galizing oil-campus rushing, the new regula
tions very likely will insist just as strongly
on campus contact only as do the present
rules. Hut whatever the rules may be, they
must make more natural and human the con
tacts between Encina and Lasuen. Failure of
the present set-up to do this is the main rea
son for its decadence.
If the Administration's interpretation of
"the best interests of the freshmen" will per
mit it, the Hoard would act wisely to shorten
the period of rushing and schedule ollicial
pledging sometime in fall quarter. For ex
ample, rush a week after registration and

pledge three weeks later, or begin around
November I—or just alter mid-quarters—
and pledge on the week-end before the Rig
Game.
The first alternative obviously would dis
pose of rushing early enough to minimize the
strained contact between Frosh and Row; but
the Administration may nip this idea with the
argument that the new students should be
given more time to become acclimated before
they go through the strain of rushing.
This leads to Ihc alternative proposal,
which has the advantage of not interfering
with school work before mid-quarters, but it
carries the disadvantage of prompting illegal
rushing in the interim between registration
and the beginning of ollicial rushing.
Either of these plans, however, apparently
satisfies the requisite of "serving the best in
terests of the fraternities, the freshmen, and
the Administration" much better than does
the present set-up.
