# Australians Help Fill Ambitious Debate Program
## 
### 
Two seasons ago, Stanford's star began to
rise in the debating firmament. With ener
getic managers, first-class teams, and a good
coach, Stanford debaters won a top niche in
debating circles.
An ambitious cross-country lour two years
ago brought Stanford's name before colleges
throughout the country. Radio debates, peni
tentiary debates, and other features served to
keep it there. Last season veterans Rogers
and MellinkolV won for the Farm the debating
championship of the Pacific Coast at Salt
Lake.
This season opened auspiciously with Pitts
burgh writing across the country for an air
debate with the school it considered "lops" in
Coast debating.
Tonight, two versatile Australian collegians
from the University of Melbourne come on
campus to split teams with two local debaters
in discussing whether our present system of
living spells the doom of culture.
With a topic of such possibilities, four
crack speakers, and an exotic flavor, Stan
ford' sambilious debate program comes home
to the Little Theater tonight, making a bid
to drag students out of their burrows of dis
interestedness.
