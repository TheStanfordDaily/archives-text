# Two Suggestions to Foil "Sudden Death" on the Campus
## 
### 
In conjunction with Stanford University's
policy of good trallie regulations, and the re
moving of any obstacle that might enhance
the safely of the numerous drivers on the
campus, the Daily makes two suggestions:
First, that a red reflector be placed on Ihe

palm tree that stands in the triangle formed
by Palm Drive and the road leading to Pine
Avenue and Eneina Gym. Last year this
abrupt turn-oil' was the scene of a serious ac
cident, at which time the only light on the
corner was torn down. It has since been
erected, but on the opposite side of the road,
and does not provide ample light for the turn.
Second suggestion is the straightening of
Santa Teresa Street directly between the cor
ner of the Corporation Yard and the Roth
residence. Here the road curves in the form
of an "S" and becomes a constant threat to
head-on collisions. A culvert drop on the
right side of the street, going toward the post
office, necessitates the swinging to the left
and brings the driver ino the path of oncom
ing cars who must veer to the right to avoid a
smash-up.
Removal of these two threats to the safety
of campus autoists would be a good step in
the direction of better trallie regulation.
