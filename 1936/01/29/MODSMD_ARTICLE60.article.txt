If one should peruse the constitution of the Asso
ciated Students . . . (and few have or ever will) . . .
one would find inconspicuously missing therefrom
. . . that which is included in almost every body of
laws ever laid down ... a strictly law enforcing agency.
* * * *
"Infractions of regulations shall be dealt with by
(lie proper Councils for Student Control." That's about
all the constitution says concerning the enforcement
of campus laws. It lets you know that you will be
prosecuted if you ever get caught violating the writ
ten rules, but it doesn't say who is going to catch you
or who or what to look out for if you contemplate
being naughty. The men's and women's councils do
enforce the law like judges from behind a table, but
they don't pound beats swinging a billy-club.
* * * *
Suppose, for example, you stand in front of a
drinking fountain on a hot day and won't let anybody
take a drink. That's against the law under Article I,
Section I. But who's going to stop you? Suppose you
take off your shoes and stockings and wade in the
Union's fountain. That infringement would come un
c:er Article I, Section 1, (c). Or suppose you smoke
mi the Quad, mix high-balls in Branner, or haze a
freshman in the shadow of the Chapel. Those are all
violations, but who's going to stop you?
* * * *
Should there be a Board of Control? Should there
I" a large body of designated student police like they
had back in high school to keep you from running in
the halls? Theoretically, if the laws of the student
body and the university are to be enforced to the let
ter, that would be necessary. It isn't, however and
hurrah, necessary.
* * * *
For did anyone ever see anybody wading in the
Union fountain? Or playing guard-the-drinking
fuuntain on the Quad? Such things certainly would
make campus life more interesting, but they aren't
done. That's why Stanford doesn't need anybody to
prevent misdemeanors, and only two Gordy Davises
to watch for our felonies.
♦ * * *
The A.S.S.U. constitution is amended and even re
v ritten periodically. Student body officers wouldn't
be normal if they didn't think they could improve on
that which is. But no class or generation has ever
figured that Stanford students were so uproarious,
I oisterous, or unmanageable that they needed a police
force to snoop and investigate and make arrests. Of
course we personally saw two students smoking on the
Quad yesterday, about 15 fraternities confessed having
done illegal rushing, and empty bottles have been seen
in various quarters, but that comes under the head of
"boys will be boys."

Everyone is supposedly on his honor to report his
follow students on the premise that everyone will be
his own policeman. And that's right, for Stanford
gentlemen are gentlemen, and Stanford ladies are
ladies. —John McClelland
