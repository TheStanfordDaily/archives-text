Among Stanford institutions are bulletin boards.
There are scattered all over the campus, in halls,
fraternities, eating clubs, classrooms, gymnasiums, ad
nauseam. Appeals to the heart, the hand, and the
hoof are posted on these obedient heralds of informa
tion. Anyone with a troubled conscience puts up his
little white card and, after this public confession, goes
forth into the world—his sins washed clean.
That somebody sometime actually reads these
boards, however, is proven by two post toasties that
appeared last week.

At the Menlo flicker house the management trotted
forth one of these newsy, chatty little short features
about snakes, vermin, and such, that Hollywood al
ways seems itching to inflict on helpless cinema audi
ences. As soon as the title "Destroyers of the Chap
arral" flashed on the screen, a wit in the back row
bellered out: "Weaver and Copp." Everybody laughed.
A seminar in Wong's kitch was discussing the
origin of the phrase "drunk as a skunk" yesterday.
The conservative element in the hashing force claimed
that it was purely a coincidence of rhyme. But old
hanker Chef Wong, the despot, came out flat-footed
with the assertion, "Boy crazy. Skonk dronk. Skunk
stunk. Smellum breath. Boy dam fool. Skunk stunk."
