# OFFER CHEAP DATES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We would like to have a couple j
of young men—the kind who think
a city date is all a girl likes—take j
us to a movie and treat us to a i
milkshake afterwards.
It's be lots of fun, would save the
men money, and let us all get up
with clear heads for Saturday |
classes.
The hard-working engineers who ■
don't date and don't dance might j
have more elevating conversation j
than that of the "scintillating" Ro- I
meos.
We have it all budgeted — two j
movie tickets, 80 cents; two shakes, j
31 cents; busfare, both ways, 401
cents. Total, $1.51 per couple.
And a good time was had by all!
