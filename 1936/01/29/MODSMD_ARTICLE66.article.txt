The Editor, Sir:
To Mr. Eisenbach—To say that i
| your letter took my breath away i
| would be an understatement. Your ;
proposition sounds like a heck of a ;
| lot of fun, and I'm sorely tempted to I
j accept. After considering the angles, j
! I'm afraid I'd be at a disadvantage, i
though. My line is based upon my j
date's ignorance of lots of things J
j about me I've already told you.
j Besides, I've heard you're far from
| being an average Stanford man. So,
I our case-history wouldn't prove a
thing. Such psychology as mine is
pretty unscientific anyway, being
based on observations, and what i
you'd call "horse-sense."
In my last letter, I agreed with !
I you as to the "ineptness" of many i
Stanford women. But if you think j
I'm prevarciating about the Roughs, !
ju.st ask a few of them—they'll ad- |
mfit it.
I had hoped that some way, some
how, we could make Stanford a
pleasanter place for both men and !
women, but I guess that's impos- j
sible. It's a pretty swell school, j
anyway.
Goodbye,
Susan j
P.S. Please thank the Committee J
| of Fifteen and give them my love.
