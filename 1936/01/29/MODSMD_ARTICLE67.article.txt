The Editor, Sir:
Sincc the Sigma Chis were dinged, â– 
i you have howled for a clean-up of !
the putrid rushing system. Accord- :
j ing to you the problem arises be- J
cause Row, Administration, and Hall
i have different desires.
Further, it seems that pledging i

systems vary from the present one |
of looking for four months at rush- ,
ees which can be seen but not known I
until after pledging to a wide-open
one of pledging yearlings when
they are no more than "a gleam in i
their fathers' eyes."
It is evident under either system j
that the selection of men suitable I
for the various houses is more de
pendent ion providence than on
good management.
This leads to the pregnant ques
tion of what and why is a frater
nity system? It is doubtful if many
Stanfordites know; certainly the
frosh do not. Would it not then be
a good idea to try to uncover the
basic theory of "fraternity life" be
fore attempting to make rules for
the pledging of the system's perpet- i
uators.
Clubs of some form are desirable
at Stanford; however, the ritual of |
hornswoggling rushees has cast a
shadow over the true intent of the !
fraternity system. Certainly at a j
university enlightenment is in order, j
Moreover, the well-being of Stan
ford's social set-up is dependent on
an intelligent decision by freshmen
j between houses or between Hall and
Row. Let us hope, therefore, that
i however the system is revamped it
will include a program for the hon
est enlightenment of the frosh re
garding the individual "brother
hood system" at Stanford.
