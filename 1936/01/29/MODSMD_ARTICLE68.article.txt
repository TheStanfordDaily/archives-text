# "WILD WEST" BOOING
## 
### 
1 The Editor, Sir:
Having been here for only a short
j lime, perhaps I am presumptious in
criticizing student behavior, espe
! cially as I am not yet acclimated in
1 the "Wild West."
j It is quite astonishing for a
| "stranger" to attend a moving pic-
I ture and hear Lowell Thomas greet-
I ed with hisses whe*i he appears as
I news commentator. Perhaps stu
! dents don't realize Thomas is a writ
: er of prominence and that this news
i agency is fortunate in having him.
I' The answer may be that Thomas'
i moustache and sleek appearance are
| abhorrent to the Rough; yet Ed
j Thorgersen, the sports announcer,
who is equally smooth is invariably
| given an ovation.
I have been brought up to con
! sider cat-calls in order only when a
j performance is unnecessarily vulgar
i or far below the standard the man
| agement has promised. My impres
' sion is that students merely hiss for

the fun of it—an attribute of gram- j
mar school intellects . . .
The good people of the township,
I understand, recently complained
quite bitterly about student conduct
in theaters. I can't say that I blame
them. If the students were more dis
criminating, our neighbors would j
have little cause to resent our re- '
actions to the pictures.
