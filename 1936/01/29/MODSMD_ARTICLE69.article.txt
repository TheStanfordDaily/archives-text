NEW RECORDINGS
One great power of the phono
graph is that it can bring the dead
to life. That's just what happens on
Victor's new Ray Noble release of
"It's Great To Be a Lover" and "My
Sweet." Both are from old masters,
cut in England. The first has all the
old Noble rhythm and trickiness.
And the second, though in the slow
and smooth style, is just as good.
Lew Stone and his fine English i
band record, "Lazy Rhythm," similar
to their other recent instrumental
numbers, on Decca 65(5. The coupling
is a new English tune, "Mediter
ranean Madness," one that defies
classification. The vocalist has a
voice similar to A1 Bowly's, and the
record is a nice, typically British,
jog-
Jimmy Dorsey's boys swing it on
Decca 655 with a jazzed up march
called "Washington Grays" and a
concoction entitled "Tap Dancer's
Nightmare."
Ted Fio-Rito has joined the Decca
group of artists with three releases.
He's the same old Fio-Rito, but with
some new tricks, such as an elec
tronic organ, the vibrant tones of
which are utilized to good effect in
breaks.
"Hypnotized" and "The Broken
Record" on Decca 677 are good stuff,
both. "Just One of Those Things"
on 678 is not Porter, but it's swell
Fio-Rito, with a tricky tempo
change 'n' everything. The coup
ling, "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and
Write Myself a Letter" is merely
mediocre.
"Cling to Me" on 679 sounds
slightly sick, but "Alone at a Table
for Two," the coupling, is a languid,
Freddie Martin-ish number thflt
should be a hit.
If you're beginning to get sick of
our new national anthem, then the
Boswcll Sisters' version of "The Mu
sic Goes 'Round and 'Round" will
be about the only one left you can
stomach. The coupling is that "Let
ter" business again, and it's good
only if you're a Boswell fan.
