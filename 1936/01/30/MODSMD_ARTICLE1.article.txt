## Play Will Be Presented In Assembly Hall at 8:15 
### Suzanne Hammond 
Although ihe majority of the
members of the cast of "The Doc- |
tor's Wife" have been suffering j
from assorted maladies during the i
last few days of rehearsal, the pro- ,
duction is primed for presentation J
tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall.
Perhaps it was due to the power
of suggestion, but an appendicitis
attack, several colds, and an in- j
fcctcd eye have made themselves ,
manifest upon various players
during the courses of rehearsals, j
The action of the play revolves j
around the character of Mrs. Harker, !
the wife of the leading physician
in a small town near Chicago, played l
by Mrs. Bayard Q. Morgan. She is
a long-suffering woman, devoted to
her husband, Stanley Pierce, but ex- j
asperated by the constant strain J
which his profession places upon j
him.
lie has had no vacation in 25
years, is continually late for din
ner, and) is constantly at the
mercy of innumerable patients.
Mrs. Marker resolves therefore
that she will force her husband
to retire and also that her daugh
ter, Rosemary Bcnet, shall never
make the similar mistake of mar
rying a doctor.
The timely arrival of two guests
brings about several surprising sit- '
uations. Willie Everett, a former j
sweetheart of the doctor's wife and '
now a famous financier, played by
Chester Barker, comes to town for
a consultation with Dr. Harker, and
Mrs. Harker seizes the opportunity
of securing his advice on the family 'â– 
investments, a choice selection of
worthless stocks, in a scene that is
one of the comedy highlights of the 1
play. It Ls with his help that she
finds a way for her husband to re- !
tire.
Dr. Wilson, the other guest played
by Malcolm McDufiie, however,
provides new worries. He, too, is a
physician, and has been summoned
as an assistant to Dr. Harker, a posi- i
tion which easly enables him to i
fall in love with the doctor's daugh- j
ter.
Mrs. .Barker's hopes and fears
become a tangle of cross-purposes,
and with such a complication the
action moves swiftly and riotously j
to an inevitable but truly unique
conclusion.
Proceeds from "The Doctor's i
Wife" will go to the President's
Birthday Party drive for funds for
the research and treatment of polio
myelitis. Nathan Nathanson and his \
orchestra have donated their serv- J
ices to play during the presentation, j
Seats may still be obtained at the j
Bookstore for $1 or 75 cents for the ;
downstairs seats, and 35 cents for j
all balcony seats.
