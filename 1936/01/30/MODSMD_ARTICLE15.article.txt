# Profits of Bookstore Affected By Business Fluctuations
## 
### 
Extreme fluctuation in the vol
ume of business done by the Book
store from day to day was blamed
by Professor E. P. Lesley, president
of the Bookstore, in the final of a
series of articles, as the chief cause
for the small profits which that or
ganization shows on its large an
nual volume of business.
"One question relative to Stan
ford Bookstore profit has often
been asked and answered pri
vately, but has never been given a
public airing. Many naturally
wonder why, if sales aggregating
$130,000 are expected this year, a
net profit of only $2700—hardly
more than 2 per cent—is antici
pated. The answer is that the
very nature of the business pre
vents greater profit.
"The peak sales of the Bookstore
in the fall quarter of this year were
$13,000 in one day. There was a
similar peak, not so high, this quar
ter. By the end of this quarter the
average daily >alcs will have dwin
dled to only $200. The sales in the
summer quarter will average little
more than $100 a day.
"Besides extreme fluctuation
throughout the year, there is a
variation any week. There are
even high >pots between classes,
and low levels when the classes

i are in session. All this necessi
tates a sales force far in excess of
what would be required if $130,-
000 worth of business were dis
tributed evenly over 300 days.
"The salary of the sales force is
; one of the principal costs of doing
! business. In the Bookstore it is
about 45 per cent of the gross profit,
the difference between what goods
| cost and what they are sold lor. As
gross profit goes, ours is small. Last
year it was 20 per cent of the sales.
"Large as it is, the sales force
is insufficient to handle the sales
on the quarterly peaks and extra
help is employed. It might be sup
posed that if the regular sales
force is greater than is required
for average business, it could be
reduced. More extras could be
employed for peak days and a few
engaged for the small high spots
of low general levels.
"This is impracticable because
the extra help, students, that is
| available for peak sales at the be-
I ginning of each quarter, is not avail
able at the high spots of low general
level. Furthermore, student help,
good as it is, is i ot efficient. Per
sonnel is continually changing. New
employees must learn location and
| prices of stock.
I "The staff is not overpaid, nci-

Uier is it idle for hours when sales
are low. There arc things to do.
The Bookstore buys paper by the
ton and sells it by the pound. The
paper is cut to size, corners are
rounded, it is punched, weighed,
and put into packages. Stork is
ordered, checked, priced, and put
on the shelves. The information
in the textbook schedule does not
come to the Bookstore of itself.
"From another co-operative col
lege book store, operated by the
Associated Students, the following
figures for last year have been re
ceived:
Total sales $197,000
Gross profit 51,000
Salaries of ■sales force... 24,072
Net profit 1,136
In this store, then, the salaries of
the sales force were 12.7 per cent of
the sales—ours were 13 per cent.
"The salaries were 48 per cent of
the gross profit — slightly more
than 43 per tent at Stanford.
"The net profit was .58 per cent of
the sales; at the Stanford Book
store it was .55 per cent of the sales.
"The almost identical percentages
for the two stores show that with
present prices, wholesale and retail,
no one could 'jjkt rich by operating a
college bookstore even if he were
able to gath°r in all of the net profit
for himself."

Extreme fluctuation in the vol

store from day to day was blamed
by Professor E. P. Lesley, president
of the Bookstore, in the final of a
series of articles, as the chief cause
for the small profits which that or
ganization shows on its large an
nual volume of business.
"One question relative to Stan
ford Bookstore profit has often
been asked and answered pri
vately, but has never been given a
public airing. Many naturally
wonder why, if sales aggregating
$130,000 are expected this year, a
net profit of only $2700—hardly
more than 2 per cent—is antici
pated. The answer is that the
very nature of the business pre
vents greater profit.
"The peak sales of the Bookstore
in the fall quarter of this year were

dled to only $200. The sales in the
summer quarter will average little
more than $100 a day.
"Besides extreme fluctuation
throughout the year, there is a
variation any week. There are
even high >pots between classes,

i are in session. All this necessi

"Large as it is, the sales force
is insufficient to handle the sales
on the quarterly peaks and extra

posed that if the regular sales
force is greater than is required

ordered, checked, priced, and put

"From another co-operative col
lege book store, operated by the
Associated Students, the following
figures for last year have been re
ceived:
Total sales $197,000
Gross profit 51,000
Salaries of ■sales force... 24,072
Net profit 1,136
In this store, then, the salaries of
the sales force were 12.7 per cent of
the sales—ours were 13 per cent.
"The salaries were 48 per cent of
the gross profit — slightly more
than 43 per tent at Stanford.
"The net profit was .58 per cent of
the sales; at the Stanford Book
store it was .55 per cent of the sales.
"The almost identical percentages
for the two stores show that with
present prices, wholesale and retail,
no one could 'jjkt rich by operating a
college bookstore even if he were
able to gath°r in all of the net profit
for himself."
