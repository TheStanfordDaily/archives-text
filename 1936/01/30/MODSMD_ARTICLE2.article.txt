ROME, Jan. 29 (A'). â€”Leaders of
Italian industry are anxious to re
vive a trade mission to the United
States which failed last year, in
formed persons said tonight.
Shortly before this disclosure, an
apparently authoritative hint was
given that Italy, because of League
sanctions, will look to the Americas
for her future raw materials and
commerce. League sanctions, it was
asserted, have strengthened instead
of weakened Italy's gold resources.
