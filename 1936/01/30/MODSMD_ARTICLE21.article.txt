# Australian, Three Local Men Debate Culture Problem
## Dill, McAuliffe Uphold Affirmative in Meet 
### 
Debaters had iheir fling at analyz
ing modern living and its effects on
culture, when three members of the
Stanford debate team and C. G. Mc-
Auliffe, of the University of Mel
bourne, entered into a lively forensic
discussion last night in the Little
Theater.
The Australian's colleague, Nevil
Stuart, was unable to leave Los
Angeles to participate in last
night's program due to his "in
disposition" after his recent ocean
voyage. However, Bob Mallett,
newcomer to the Stanford team
substituted for Stuart.
Other Stanford speakers were Jim
Hill and Marshall Dill, who were
paired with Mallett and McAuliffe
respectively. McAuliffe and Dill
upheld the affirmative of the ques
tion, "Resolved, that the present
system of living spells the doom of
culture."
The affirmative team upheld the
fact that there was little or no cul
ture being realized today. It was
present, but not sought, after, due to
modern industrial interferences.
Dill maintained that the "illiterati
were standing knee-deep in cul
ture."
After this argument was en
larged upon, the negative, Mallett,
asked whether Dill and M-cAuliffe
weren't the "quintessence of cul
ture" themselves? The debate too'<
on more the form of an informal
discussion as it progressed.
The radio, cinema, and automobile
were often used by both sides in
drawing their analogies. The nega
tive stated that movies brought cul
ture in the form of music 'and lec
tures to the masses, while the af
firmative elucidated the fact that
the movies, although bringing such
pictures as "Les Miserables," merely
made the story easier leaving out
the philosophy and background
given by the author.
No decision was given following
the debate, as it had been planned
as a non-decision affair.
Last night's speech was Mc-
Auliffe's first public appearance in
the United States. He is touring the
United States with his colleague,
Stuart, representing the University
of Melbourne.
