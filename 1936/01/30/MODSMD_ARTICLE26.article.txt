as they were last year or put into a
fund for some school project.
Kendall Overturf, Chaparral art
ist: "The sum that is returned is so
paltry that I feel it should be put
into a growing fund to build Stan
ford a hospital."
Itobert Hall, Tau Beta Pi: "Should
the Bookstore surplus at the end
of the year be woi-th the time and
trouble taken for the accounting
which accompanies it, I believe that
it should be returned, but if not, the
remains could be invested in a Book
store interest such as a book ex
change."
Betty Ilunsberger, freshman wom
rn: "Though seemingly small if the
rebate is paid to the individual,
when rebates are left in a mass fund,
the money accumulates and could
be well used to increase and replace
the supply of literary pieces now
in the library."
Peg Schaeffer, chairman of Wom
en's Council: "I feel that the excess
funds remaining in Bookstore pro
ceeds should be put in the interest
of a loan library under the auspices
of the Bookstore, in order that all
Stanford students will have a chance
to read the best new books."
