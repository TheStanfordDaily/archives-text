# TELLS BOY'S PLIGHT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have been interested in the ex
change between Bull Sessioner Ei
senbach and Miss Susan, and before
the topic becomes worn out I should
like to add my support to Susan's
contention that a university should
make an attempt to develop well
rounded students, both men and
women, who are prepared to go out
and mingle harmoniously in society
as well as do their jobs.
To Susan's moving story of the
plight of the young girls who come
to Stanford, I wish to add a boy's
story. Consider the average boy
who comes here—neither a social
hound, a conversational genius, an
accomplished high-ball drinker, nor
a perfect lover.
He has neither an automobile nor
a tuxedo. What chance has he for a
normal social life? He must bum
rides for his dates, which is some
times difficult and always incon
venient, and he is prevented by the
expense from attending formal
dances, which seem to predominate
this quarter's social calendar. And
what chance has he with the Stan
ford girl, accustomed to command
ing only the best of cars, conversa
tion, dancing, after-dance entertain
ment and technique?
Of course, there are a few girls
left—the ones Susan speaks about—
but it is something akin to failure to
date a girl who is left over at jolly
ups. A man's vanity is not satisfied
by the misfit girl who is obviously
trying to make a hit because she
realizes that it will probably be her
only chance.
And so, may I say that there are
boys as well as girls at Stanford who
live socially thwarted lives and who
sincerely want to know more about
the art of achieving happy human
