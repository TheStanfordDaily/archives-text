## 
### 
Bolstered by the addition of five
big league stars, Augie Galan, Ed-
I die Montague, Tony Lazzeri, Joe
j Cronin, and Babe Dahlgren, Kcn
ealy s Seals took the measure of the
| Stanford nine, 11 to 4, at the Sunken
j Diamond yesterday afternoon. The
, game was called at the end of the
i sixth inning because of darkness.
It was the third practice game of
, the season for the Indians, and they
showed a definite need for improve
ment in the field. Seven errors were
charged against them, while the four
Stanford pitchers granted seven
walks and hit three batsmen.
In the third inning the Stanford
1 defense cracked wide open, giving
the Seals five runs without a hit.
After the first inning Stanford never
threatened seriously.
