A TIIREE-YEAR
HOOP CYCLE?

Basketball fans these days are
discussing with optimism Stanford's
prospects for 1937, and even '38.
John Bunn's present team has a real
chance to equal the record of three
straight years on top of the Coast
heap in football.
Every one of the seven men now
rated as regulars or semi-regulars
will be back next year. At least
one man from the current frosh,
and probably the usual quota of
junior college transfers will swell
the ranks of the varsity squad, but
will have a tough time breaking into
the first string.
Hank Luisetti, southern divi
sion high scorer, and Howell
Turner, vastly improved since
last year, will both return as '37
forwards. Hank should be even
better with a season of confer
ence play behind him, and Turner
should combine with him to give
the Indians the Coast's best scor
ing combination. Art Stoefen will
be back at his center post, keeping
this season's attacking trio to
gether unless he loses out to a
better man.
If "Stofe" is relegated to the sec
ond string next year, it will be no
disgrace to him. Bob Zonne, who is
giving him such a light for his posi
tion now, is also a sophomore, but
he may not be the best basketball
player in his own family next year.
Bob's kid brother Phil, towering
nearly as high, isn't as good a floor
man, but he's a better shot. Phil
has been high-point man in every
frosh game but one this season, and
he tied for the honor that night,
without his usual "eye."
Captain in his junior year,
Dinty Moore returns for another
season at guard. Dinty's battle
with Harold "Sparky" Robertson
for a place in the starting line-up
may well continue through next
season. Jack Calderwood, like
Luisetti, Stoefen, and Bob Zonne,
has two more years after this one
and will be favored for the other
defensive position. Bunn might
use any combination of guards
selected from Moore, Robertson,
and Calderwood, or he could shift
Bob Zonne to guard in case Stoe
fen or Phil Zonne wins the scram
ble for center, or he could even
make a guard out of Phil. A wide
choice will be open to him, with
at least eight good players to
work with.
Luisetti, Stoefen, Calderwood,
and the Zonne brothers might form
the nucleus of another classy team
two years from now, if you like to
figure things that far ahead. In or
der to duplicate Tiny Thornhill's
feat of three championship teams in
a row, Bunn will need all this ma
terial. Other Coast outfits, espe
cially the Bears, should be better
next year.

HANK'S AVERAGE TOPS
ENTIRE LEAGUE

It's widely known that Hank Lui
setti has scored far more points than
any other southern division hoop
.ster. Few realize that the brilliant
sophomore's total also exceeds that
of any man in the northern section
of (he confei'ence.
Wally Palmberg of Oregon State
leads the Pacific Northwest with 72
points in seven games. This average
of slightly over 10 points a game
isn't in the same class as Hank's
record of more than 17-87 digits in
only five games. The "Spider" spins
his web for other teams with leather
and the mesh of basketball goals.

A TIIREE-YEAR
HOOP CYCLE?

Basketball fans these days are
discussing with optimism Stanford's
prospects for 1937, and even '38.
John Bunn's present team has a real
chance to equal the record of three
straight years on top of the Coast
heap in football.
Every one of the seven men now
rated as regulars or semi-regulars
will be back next year. At least
one man from the current frosh,
and probably the usual quota of
junior college transfers will swell
the ranks of the varsity squad, but
will have a tough time breaking into
the first string.
Hank Luisetti, southern divi
sion high scorer, and Howell
Turner, vastly improved since
last year, will both return as '37
forwards. Hank should be even
better with a season of confer
ence play behind him, and Turner
should combine with him to give
the Indians the Coast's best scor
ing combination. Art Stoefen will
be back at his center post, keeping
this season's attacking trio to
gether unless he loses out to a
better man.
If "Stofe" is relegated to the sec
ond string next year, it will be no
disgrace to him. Bob Zonne, who is
giving him such a light for his posi
tion now, is also a sophomore, but
he may not be the best basketball
player in his own family next year.
Bob's kid brother Phil, towering
nearly as high, isn't as good a floor
man, but he's a better shot. Phil
has been high-point man in every
frosh game but one this season, and
he tied for the honor that night,
without his usual "eye."
Captain in his junior year,
Dinty Moore returns for another
season at guard. Dinty's battle
with Harold "Sparky" Robertson
for a place in the starting line-up
may well continue through next
season. Jack Calderwood, like
Luisetti, Stoefen, and Bob Zonne,
has two more years after this one
and will be favored for the other
defensive position. Bunn might
use any combination of guards
selected from Moore, Robertson,
and Calderwood, or he could shift
Bob Zonne to guard in case Stoe
fen or Phil Zonne wins the scram
ble for center, or he could even
make a guard out of Phil. A wide
choice will be open to him, with
at least eight good players to
work with.
Luisetti, Stoefen, Calderwood,
and the Zonne brothers might form
the nucleus of another classy team
two years from now, if you like to
figure things that far ahead. In or
der to duplicate Tiny Thornhill's
feat of three championship teams in
a row, Bunn will need all this ma
terial. Other Coast outfits, espe
cially the Bears, should be better
next year.

HANK'S AVERAGE TOPS
ENTIRE LEAGUE

It's widely known that Hank Lui
setti has scored far more points than
any other southern division hoop
.ster. Few realize that the brilliant
sophomore's total also exceeds that
of any man in the northern section
of (he confei'ence.
Wally Palmberg of Oregon State
leads the Pacific Northwest with 72
points in seven games. This average
of slightly over 10 points a game
isn't in the same class as Hank's
record of more than 17-87 digits in
only five games. The "Spider" spins
his web for other teams with leather
and the mesh of basketball goals.
