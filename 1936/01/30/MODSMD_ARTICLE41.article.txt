# Bunn Tries Change in Varsity Lineup
## Turner Stars In Basketball Scrimmage Coach Price Works On U.C. Quintet's Passing 
### 
Coach John Bunn thought he'd try
a bit of strategy yesterday and fool
Nibs Price's cageis Friday night,
but that strategy turned right
around and fooled him.
It goes this way. Hunn, some
how not satisfied with his set-up,
although his cagers top the Cali
fornia basketball circuit, placed
Boh Zonne and Sparky Robertson
in as first-string center and
guard, respectively, for a scrim
mage yesterday. To the second
string, for the scrimmage, went
Art Stoefen and Captain Dinty
Moore.
But at the end of a 20-minute
game the second team, that embrac
ing Art and Dinty, was four points
ahead of the league leading, Ti'ojan
whipping varsity.
So John turned around himself
and stuck the Cnp and Stoefen right
back with Turner, Calderwood, and
Luisetti. And back went Robertson
and Zonne to the seconds, to play
with Ken Bell, Bill Quade, arid Nel
lie Heath.
During the scrimmage Howell
Turner, the Danville Deadeye, late
of Piedmont, was outstanding. He
missed very few shots, and passed
to Luisetti for many more. Insid
ers around the Pavilion are pick
ing this blonde one for a berth
right next to Hank for shooting
and passing honors, for Turner
never telegraphs a pass, and some
of Luisetti's flashiest buckets fol
low a stealthy Turner pass.
Up in the Berkeley Edwards
Field Nibs Price is trying to whip
some kind of a passing offense into
his crew. It was remarkable the
number of goals Cal scored from
aft of the foul line and from the
corners in the first Big Game.
Center of the passing attack is
lanky Chet Carlyle, soph center.
A good tip-in man, he works
mostly with Captain Kay Olsen to
do most of the in-work.
. The second Cal game will be the
week-end's mam event, but Satur
day night St. Mary's varsity comes
here to do battle.

never telegraphs a pass, and some
of Luisetti's flashiest buckets fol
low a stealthy Turner pass.
Up in the Berkeley Edwards
Field Nibs Price is trying to whip
some kind of a passing offense into
his crew. It was remarkable the
number of goals Cal scored from
aft of the foul line and from the
corners in the first Big Game.
Center of the passing attack is
lanky Chet Carlyle, soph center.
A good tip-in man, he works
mostly with Captain Kay Olsen to
do most of the in-work.
. The second Cal game will be the
week-end's mam event, but Satur
day night St. Mary's varsity comes
here to do battle.
