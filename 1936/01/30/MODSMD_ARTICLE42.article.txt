# Gael Hoopsters To Battle Frosh
## Coach Bradshaw Scouts St. Mary's Babe Team 
### 
While scouting the St. Mary's
frosh, "Rabbit" Bradshaw was evi
dently impressed by their offensive
prowess. The little freshman hoop
coach had drilled his squad entirely
on attack earlier in the week, but
yesterday he put them through a de
fensive workout in preparation for
their tussle with the Gael babes
Saturday night.
"Rabbit" watched the Moragans
win a fairly close game from Sacred
Heart High School, incidentally
getting some pointers on the St.
Mary's varsity for John Bunn at the
same time. After seeing how his op
ponents' offensive ticked, he had
bis regulars and subs working to
gether yesterday, giving each man
practice in the interception of
passes and the checking of an imi
tated Gael field goal threat.
In the early part of the session,
the Indian yearling practiced in pairs
on set-up shots and free throws.
They may need plenty of both to
defeat the Moraga first-year-men,
last team to toughen them up for
the Bear frosh, who come to the
Pavilion a week from tonight. Sat
urday's game will start at 6:30
o'clock as a preliminary to the Stan
ford-St. Mary's varsity contest.
