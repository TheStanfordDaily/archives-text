# Ruggers Set for Olympic Club Game
## Team Has Full Strength For First Time This Year 
### 
For the first time this season the
varsity rugby team will go on the
field of the stadium with its full
strength in a game against the
Olympic Club slated for Saturday
afternoon.
Injuries have kept number of
ruggers from the three games al
ready played this season, while
Johnny Reisner joined the squad
only this week after returning
from Hawaii.
Scrimmages have been held this
week with the last practice before
the Olympic Club meeting scheduled
for tonight. According to Coach Jim
Wylie there will be a few new faces
on the first team. After last night's
scrimmage he refused to state defi
nite changes, saying that the line-up
for Saturday would be given out to
night.
Last week, ruggers ran over the
Argonauts ending with a 24-0
score. However, the Olympic Club
should give them plenty of compe
tition as it is cracked up to he one
of the hest teams in the rugby
union this season.
Admission to Saturday's game
will be free to Stanford students
presenting their student body cards.
