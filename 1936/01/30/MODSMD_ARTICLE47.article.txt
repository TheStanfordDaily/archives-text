Ellington said last night after trials
for the Far Western Indoor Cham
pionships had been run.
Cranston breezed through an
880 in 2:00.7, his first try at the
distance, and two Hat is consid
ered good time for the best of
them in these parts in the middle
of January. The trials were held
to pick a tentative entry list for
