### 
In response to Sam Barry's
charge that Hank Luisetti was
"shouldering" Eddie Oram on his
scoring dribbles against U.S.C.
last Saturday night, the figures of
Luisetti's playing at Stanford, are
offered.
During his 31 games for the
Cards in his frosh year and this,
Hank is credited with U8 fouls;
slightly more than one per game.
If a man with such a record can
average 1!) points per game, scor
ing many of them off those same
speedy dribbles before 15 different
referees it stands to reason that
he doesn't "shoulder" in any
game.
Figures don't lie.
