# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Stanford Band Needed at Gal to Supply Cardinal Flavor in "Crucial" Game 
### 
Numerous remarks about the lack of stu
dent attendance at basketball games brings
up tbe question of where the Stanford band
has been hibernating this wintry month.
Basketball season is about the only chance
the band gets to put in an appearance after
football is over. Yet live conference hoop
games have gone by the boards and 'nary a
tune has been heard in the pavilion. The band
lias been missed at these games but the fact
overlooked due to the excitement supplied by
the greatest Stanford basketball team in 14
years.
There is no reason why the band should not
be at every basketball game. They appear
at all the football games and even cry for
money so they can make the trip south to the
U.S.C. game. Why then the lack of interest
in basketball? Especially this year when the
Indians have a good chance to win the Pacific
Coast Conference titleâ€”a thing unheard-of in
the annals of Stanford basketball for many
years.
Tomorrow only 200 students will make the
trip to Berkeley for the second game with
California. Why can't this small number of
rooters be supplemented by the Stanford
band? II isn't necessary that all the members
go. .lust enough so that the Cardinal won't
be put to shame by the California band which
is sure to be there.
