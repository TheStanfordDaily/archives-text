# Peace Contest Rolls Merrily On Its Way
## 
### 
Willi 58,000 entries in three weeks to attest
to the attention it is attracting, the Eddie
Cantor dollar scholarship contest on
the subject "How Can America Stay Out of
War" seems well on its way to fulfill its ob
jective: publicizing peace sentiment.
Although the contest makes no fancy
claims about being able to stop war all by
ils lonesome, it is a sensible step in the right
direction and has a well-worded question.
Before the teeth can be put into neutrality and
peace legislation, public sentiment must be
solidly entrenched behind it.
Observers have long noted that comedians
are a good deal brainier than -their patter
would indicate, and Mr. Cantor is giving
added proof to the belief by olTering a full
four-year scholarship at any American uni
versity for the best f>oo-word essay presented
before February 22 on how to prevent Ameri
ca's becoming entangled in another cataclys
mic war.
To entice the present crop of collegians into
entering, the prize has been made applicable
lo any designate of the winner, and does not
have to be used by the winner personally.
Local interest is heightened by the inclu
sion of President Wilbur as one of the four
contest judges. For 5,000 dollars, it is not
unreasonable to expect some Stanford men
lo lake time oil' from local all'airs to turn out
an entry on how war mav be avoided.
