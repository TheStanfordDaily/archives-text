HANDS ANI) FEET—S STAR FINAL
Since Susan's turned me down and broken my
editorial heart, we can return to the argument that
started this Aunt Bella department. You remember,
it, was about Stanford women, and men.
Right ofT the bat I'd like to thank the Back-to-the-
Farmerettes for giving us guys' a break. It's very
sweet and considerate of them to set a minimum
dating wage of $1.50. But together with the few
capitalists on this campus, we have one thing in
common with employers generally: we don't like to be
told how much to spend, and we'll be darned if we'll
accept a suggested minimum as anything but an un
justly imposed maximum.
♦ * * +
No doubt the Farmerettes' suggestion was well
meant, but who in the dickens are Stanford women to
I e suggesting how much Stanford men should spend
on them?
Though they may not publicly admit it, Stanford
women are the most envied of their sex. To prove
it, we quote gals and not ourselves: "Stanford gets
the cream of the men." "If you go to Stanford, you're
jet as far as dates are concerned." "There's not a
I ettcr selected bunch of males anywhere than on the
Farm."
That's the home girl speaking who hears about
Stanford only from the papers. And when the Rough
i oturns to his native bailiwick for the holidays or
vacation, he can be broke, a lemon, and a butcher,
and get more dates than he knows what to do with.
• * » *
Moreover, $1.50, while a relatively small amount,
(.in break up a five-dollar bill like Grayson broke
Cal s interference. Excluding the high-bracket romeos,
it's a sum most of us must begrudge. For, Stanford
women being generally what they are, one large in
vestment at longer intervals pays bigger dividends
than a number of small investments at shorter inter
vals. (Mr. Hall, please write.)
Don't misunderstand me—the cheap date idea's
good, but it simply will not work. Because supply is
kvss than demand, the campus woman can pick and
choose her dates. And because she is no different from
• there of her sex elsewhere but in the same situa
tion, the -campus woman takes the most-oh of the
best-oh and lets the least-oh come out there, which
may be Paly or Menlo, but is certainly not Stanford.
• • • *
Many co-eds, particularly if they've been queened
by the big-shots as freshmen, go crashing through
hearts and feelings like a war-cartoon of the Germans
going through Belgium. They're playing Cupid Poker
with a stacked deck, and in that game you don't have
to lose occasionally to make things look "right." The
desperate customers will always back a single Queen,
and the dealer can always rustle up two Kings.

started this Aunt Bella department. You remember,
it, was about Stanford women, and men.
Right ofT the bat I'd like to thank the Back-to-the-
Farmerettes for giving us guys' a break. It's very
sweet and considerate of them to set a minimum
dating wage of $1.50. But together with the few
capitalists on this campus, we have one thing in
common with employers generally: we don't like to be
told how much to spend, and we'll be darned if we'll
accept a suggested minimum as anything but an un
justly imposed maximum.

No doubt the Farmerettes' suggestion was well
meant, but who in the dickens are Stanford women to
I e suggesting how much Stanford men should spend
on them?
Though they may not publicly admit it, Stanford
women are the most envied of their sex. To prove
it, we quote gals and not ourselves: "Stanford gets
the cream of the men." "If you go to Stanford, you're
jet as far as dates are concerned." "There's not a
I ettcr selected bunch of males anywhere than on the
Farm."
That's the home girl speaking who hears about
Stanford only from the papers. And when the Rough
i oturns to his native bailiwick for the holidays or
vacation, he can be broke, a lemon, and a butcher,
and get more dates than he knows what to do with.

Moreover, $1.50, while a relatively small amount,
(.in break up a five-dollar bill like Grayson broke
Cal s interference. Excluding the high-bracket romeos,
it's a sum most of us must begrudge. For, Stanford
women being generally what they are, one large in
vestment at longer intervals pays bigger dividends
than a number of small investments at shorter inter
vals. (Mr. Hall, please write.)
Don't misunderstand me—the cheap date idea's
good, but it simply will not work. Because supply is
kvss than demand, the campus woman can pick and
choose her dates. And because she is no different from
• there of her sex elsewhere but in the same situa
tion, the -campus woman takes the most-oh of the
best-oh and lets the least-oh come out there, which
may be Paly or Menlo, but is certainly not Stanford.

Many co-eds, particularly if they've been queened
by the big-shots as freshmen, go crashing through
hearts and feelings like a war-cartoon of the Germans
going through Belgium. They're playing Cupid Poker
with a stacked deck, and in that game you don't have
to lose occasionally to make things look "right." The
desperate customers will always back a single Queen,
and the dealer can always rustle up two Kings.
