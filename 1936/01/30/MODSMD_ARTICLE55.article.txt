Coach Sam Harry of U.S.C., before the re
cent losses to Stanford, was reliably reported
to be in favor of less crabbing by the news
papers directed at basketball ollieiating.
Quoting "Cryin' Sam," after the game:
"With respectable ollieiating, Luisetti never
would have been able to get on that scoring
rampage, and I ilon't mind bcimj quoted.
"Oram would do his best to guard Lui
setti legally, but Luisetti would give Eddie a
shove with his shoulder and then loop the
ball into the basket with an overhand sweep."
Quoting "Snii 1 i 11' John" Bunn: "I'm awful
sorry Sam feels that way. If we got any break
in the ollieiating, I didn't see it. . . . Luisetti
plays with less contact than any fellow I ever
played against. . . ."
Quoting Referee Leith: "I've worked for
Barry for live years and lie's never complained
before. 1 worked that game the same as any
other "
We don't mind being quoted either: it's not
hard to see Mr. Barry's spot—lf) points ahead
with 10 minutes to go and four points behind
at the gun; and defending'champion, too.
