# Let's Have That Panel Set Soon, Ex Committee
## 
### 
In running through a lull agenda of busi
ness Tuesday night, Ex Committee cleaned
lip many matters that have long been hanging
lire, l)iit left the date for the student panel
on selection of Ex Committeemen unsettled.
The question arose at last week's meeting
when Chappie Business Manager Creamer
presented a radically different plan calling
for functional representation on Ex Com
mittee instead of a system of all-University
election.
Next Wednesday was mentioned and
should he settled upon, or another suitable
date decided and announced soon before the
topic is gone and forgotten.
