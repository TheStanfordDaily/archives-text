The S.A.E.'s have devised a new way to raise their
rating in the eyes of their national organization. Pic
tures were being taken the other day for the S.A.E.
national magazine, for which loyal brothers shell out
four bits per month. And the pictures showed five
men decorated with the Stanford Block S. But a close
perusal of the pictures showed that it was the same
sweater.
Roble martyrs to the Great Sin of the Lasuen have
a means of developing a little group consciousness in
their own cute way. The numeral "11" designates
that a gal was illegally rushed by one house, while a
perfect circle indicates that this girl transgressed with
another. But a " â€”" on your report still indicates that
you've flunked the course.
Something should be done for that large body of
the canine population known as library orphans.
These lugubrious bow-wows with their lolling tongues,
their drooping jowls and their quizzical ears poke,
peer, and leer at the library windows in hopes that
their master will return. One long, lanky black
model with de luxe Mickey Mouse equipment held
a watch for a week on the library steps. But his
master never came out. People who were worried
about the fate of the dog, whose howls were waking
up people in the Reading Room, finally conducted an
investigation. At the end of the second week, they
found the body of the master, dead from starvation.
He had lost his way trying to find the Felton Library.
Since we've been appointing quite a few commit
tees of late, Our Hasher's suggestions might not seem
out of order: A committee for the conducting of dogs
on a walking tour through the library. This might
save all this anarchic galloping through the aisle, and
the hit and miss nosings of bound volumes. And the
people in the Reading Room can go back to sleep.
