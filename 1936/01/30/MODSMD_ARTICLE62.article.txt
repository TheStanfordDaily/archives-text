# CUTTING THE ANTE
## 
### 
Dear Farmerettes:
So you would like to have a couple
, of men take you to the movie and
I "treat" you to a milkshake after
-1 wards? And you have it all bud
' geted? So nice.
I gather you v/ant to sit down
stairs. What's the matter with the
i balcony? That would cut the first
item to 60 cents. And then a coke
for a "treat" would cut the ante an
other 20 cents and save tax. And
finally, I think it would be awfully
I sweet if you would walk.
Total expense —70 cents per
couple. Now isn't that something
j like it?
Another thing—why pick on en
| gineers?
