# WHAT! NO LIBERTY?

The Editor, Sir:
Is this a free country? Is Stan
ford a democratic school? Have I,
as a citizen, no rights whatsoever?
Don't tell me—let me guess. The
answer, I believe, is "No."
Now I'm a plain man, sir, a plain
man with plain tastes, and—a very
respectable pair of bedroom slip
pers, wooly ones. Being a piain man
and having these slippers, I see no
harm in wearing them to the so
called Friday night "dinner" at En
| cina Commons; in fact, I rather en
| joy it (being a plain man, that is.)
However, a sponsor whose mental
| development has been impaired by
I eating Encina confections for a pe
i riod of more than a year tells me that
j wearing wooly bedroom slippers to
j dinner on Friday night is unbecom-
I ing the background and traditions
1 of Encina Hall. He even went so
far as to tell me that he wasn't
j running a nudist colony.
Now I wasn't interested in his
j personal afTairs. but I don't see why
I anyone should object to my bed
j room slippers even if he is running
a nudist colony.
Furthermore, Encina (so the spon-
I sors say) is my home (Lord blessit)
| and if sweatshirts were worn to din
i ner in my home, I'd certainly have
j no qualms about wearing my wooly
bedroom slippers. I'm a plain man,
I sir, with plain tastes, and although
shoes are nice and marmalade is
tasty, "I do like a little bit of but
ter on my bread."
