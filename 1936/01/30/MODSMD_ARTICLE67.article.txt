DOLLAR OPERA returns to San
Francisco February 23, when For
tune Gallo brings his San Carlo
Opera Company to the San Fran
cisco Opera House for the third
successive season.
A company of over 125 will pre
sent an extensive repertoire, in
cluding, "Boheme," "Butterfly,"
"Martha" (in English), and "Tann
hauser." Past seasons have shown
the company to be a worthwhile
one, and its productions more than
worth the low price scale asked.
LAWRENCE TIBBETT, when re
hearsing his air programs, concen- j
trates on the music and improvises j
the lyrics. Recently in perfect I
voice for a difficult aria, he bel- '
lowed, "Good morning, men, have j
you seen what the stock market's
doing?" The cymbal player picked
up the cue with a tremendous
crash.
