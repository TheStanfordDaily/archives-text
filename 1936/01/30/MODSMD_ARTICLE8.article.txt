## Four Students Tell Of Warm Springs Benefits

There's one more tax imposed by !
Roosevelt, but Mr. and Mrs. Ameri
ca are going to pay it and smile. And
as the predicted millions go ring- j
ing through the coffers of charity I
balls and box offices, there'll be j
other smiles—the day's most im
portant smiles—on the faces of a
couple of hundred kids down at the
Warm Springs Foundation in Geor
gia.
For today's the day that America
gives to the national cause that has
become its greatest—to stamp out
infantile paralysis and cure sufferers
from that disease.
Most Stanfordites may take the
clay's command lightly, hut there
are four to whom the day is pos- 1
si My the most significant in the
year.
Not so long ago they went to the
Warm Springs Foundation, but they
didn't walk in ... . they were car
ried.
'l'here they exercised in the in
stitution's pool, learning to use
disease-ravaged muscle that only |
time and skillful care could repair. I
They remember the incurable op
timism that flooded the place,
springing out of dull, pain-wrack
ed eyes that would never again
see anything but the Foundation's i
small buildings.
They remember long days when
they tried to move arms and legs
that lay like dead weight on the bed ;
covers.
But most of all they remember
a tall, genial man named Roose
velt who came down Thanksgiving
Christmas, week-ends—whenever
he could sneak away from Al
bany, New York, or Washington.
They remember his smile, his little
jokes. Most of all they remember
the inagniliccnt example of this
man, struck down from the high
places by an invincible and invisi
ble enemy, who won his fight and
( limbed all the way back.
First we give you Lewis E. Han
chett from the Fiji House. He
spent, the winters of 1932 and '33 at
Warm Springs after he had con
tracted infantile paralysis during
his first term at Yale. Today Lewis
is studying law with the idea of some
day going into practice. "Rcmem-.
ber Roosevelt? Couldn't forget
nim."' Lewis laughs. "He's the man
vho sets the spirit down at Warm
Springs."
Next in line is Boyd White, who
makes wheels do as well ns most
