# Gentleman Bob Peeps, Enters Roble Gym
## 
### 
Bob Gros became the first Stan
ford gentleman to enter the Wom
en's Gym during classes yester
day.
"It was all in line of duty," he
modestly explains. "I wanted
music stands for the jolly-up.
" 'But there are girls on the
floor,' an instructress huffed. And
I, a gentleman, didn't go in. I just
stood by the door and ordered my
henchmen to ogle. .
"They ogled, and the girls
ambled to the locker room. Then
I wanted the public address sys
tem, and that was in the locker
room.
" 'Could these gentlemen get the
P.A. system from in there?' I
asked.
" 'Of course not,' snapped an
other instructress.
"And I, being a Stanford gentle
man, knew what Stanford ladies
would do. So I walked in."
