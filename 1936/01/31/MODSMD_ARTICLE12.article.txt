### 
Four proposals concerning book
store rebates that will appear on
the ballot at the A.S.S.U. election
February 11 were announced by
Jim Ludlam, chairman of the elec
tion board late last night.
First is that the Stanford Uni
versity Bookstore continue to
make its rebates to persons con
nected with the University who
deposit their purchase receipts
with the bookstore, as at present.
Second, that the Stanford Univer
sity Bookstore use the rebate money
of each academic year to finance
and operate a loan library of recent
novels, non-fiction, and books in
current use for courses at Stanford.
Third, that the Stanford Uni
versity Bookstore donate the re
bate money of each academic year
to the scholarship fund for stu
dent aid.
Fourth, any suggestion which stu
dents may desire to write in.
These proposals, said Lualam, are
merely suggestions. Through them
we hope to find out real student
opinion on the subject. Voting on
the proposals will be by the pref
erential system, with first, second,
and third choices expressed.
