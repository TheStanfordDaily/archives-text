thony Eden, who taxed his energy
and diplomatic persuasion to emerge
chief conciliator and developments,
informed observers believe, may
have far reaching effects.
Chief of these was easing of
Franco-German tenseness, accom

Baron Konstantin von Neutrah,
German envoy.
Observers were interested keenly
in repeated talks which Eden held
with Maxim Litvinoff, Soviet Com
missar for Foreign Affairs, who is
known as one of the most canny
traders in Europe.
