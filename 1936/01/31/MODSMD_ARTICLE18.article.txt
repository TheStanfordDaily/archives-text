# President's Birthday Play Well Received
## Morgan, Benet, Barker Lead Cast of Comedy 
### 
To rounds of applause and cries
of "Author!" the curtain fell on
last night's performance of "The
Doctor's Wife," given in the As
sembly Hall as Stanford and Palo
Alto's contribution to the Presi
dent's birthday celebration.
Preceeded by a jolly-up in the
Women's Gym, the play was given
for the benefit of the Warm Springs
Foundation, the profits from
jolly-up and play going to the
relief of infantile paralysis vic
tims.
One of the largest audiences in
Stanford dramatic history witnessed
the performance, sponsored jointly
by the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce and the Stanford Dramatic
Council.
The play was written by a local
man, Dr. Edward Liston of Palo
Alto. First given on the campus two
years ago, the play has been greatly
revamped since then. As before,
witty dialog is its outstanding fea
ture.
Heading the cast were Jo Mor
gan, wife of Dr. B. Q. Morgan of
the German department; Rose
mary Benet, Chester Barker, and
Stanley Pearce.
The play relates the trials and
tribulations of a middle-western
doctor. Ample comedy is furnished
by her efforts to persuade her hus
band to retire, her attempts to cope
with a former sweetheart, now a
hypochondriac, who is visiting her
home, and her futile machinations
to prevent her daughter from mar
rying a physician.
