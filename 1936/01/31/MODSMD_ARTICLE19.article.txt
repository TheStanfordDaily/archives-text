# Twitty To Talk On Embryo Growth
## 
### 
In the embryo is a center—sci
entists call it the "organizer"—which
acts as a general superintendent of
the development of the embryo into
maturity. This is one of the many
facts about the development of the
embryo that Professor Victor C.
Twitty will relate in a talk over the
Stanford Radio Hour from station
KGO Monday evening.
Dr. Twitty, who has a Ph.D. de
gree from Yale University, is an
associate professor of biology. He
was formerly on the Yale staff and a
fellow in the Kaiser-Wilhelm Insti
tut fur Biologie.
