# Paradox of Farm— Zook versus Zook
## 
### Dave Botsford 
They fight alike, they study alike,
they play alike, they love alike, they
look alike—who are they? You saw
them wrestle at the fights last week,
the feature of the evening. Yes, the
Zook twins from Abilene, in the
great state of Kansas.
A talk with Dwight and Wayne,
freshmen, in their Encina room last
night brought out more than a few
interesting highlights on wh*U, it's
like to bo an identical twin—that is,
a Zook twin.
Dwighl Is Eldest
They've been fighting each other,
in one way 01 another, all their
life—except that single hour by
which Dwight beat Wayne into the
world. The short, dark-eyed Zook
ies say that neither is really better,
though Wayne got the decision last
week. (The Daily announced Dwight
the winner, but it didn't matter, they
said. Life has been like that for
the brothers Zook.)
If you notice closely, you'll see
that Dwight is about an inch taller
than Wayne, weighs maybe two
pounds more. But Wayne doesn't
mind, and passes it off with "He's
older than I am, anyway."
(let Same Marks
A bawl-out check-up reveals per
haps the most amazing thing about
the Zooks—2s plus 16, both of them.
And for summer quarter (Kansas
was hot, so they came West to miss

[ it) both pulled down a 12-plus-8.
! But they say they've been doing the
'same thing for years — taking the
| same subjects and getting the same
! marks, Dwight, however, smiled a
: little and said. "His high-school av
i crage was a third of a point lower'n
/ mine."
' One can't seem to excel the other
in anything. In diving and debating
i tournaments, judges find it easier to
call it a draw. The twins are almost
perfectly matched in tennis, too.
Mix Their Romances
When it comes to love 'n romance,
there the fun begins. Wayne tells
about the time he chiseled on Dwight
the girl didn't know the difference.
Dwight found the same tricks fun.
' He says he dated three of Wayne's
' "moments." The girls were in the
dark then, too. Just for fun, the
| Zooks have gone around with three
sets of gal twins. Try and figure
that out!
One time both the boys worked
in a drug store. It happened that
: they were always breaking things.
! But the poor proprietor never knew
which was the bad one. Then he
! fired Dwight, just so he could blame
the troubles on somebody definite.
Dwight, who likes to talk a little
more than Wf.yne does, still re
members the time Dad Zooke made
i a mistake and licked him instead of
Wayne. That one, we think, is rather
j hard to swallow.
