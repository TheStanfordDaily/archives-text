### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (/P;.â€”At
torney Gener&i Cummings intimat
ed at his press conference today the
Justice Department has completed
an investigation of complaints
against Pacific Coast Waterfront
Unions.
He said, however, he could not
state whether federal agents found
evidence of violation of the Sher
man Anti-Trust Act, as alleged by
shipowners.
"I am not prepared to answer
that," he told reporters.
The Attorney General was asked
about reports from San Francisco
that agents had questioned Harry
Bridges, left wing union leader.
Cummings said he did not know
the agents were still active in San
Francisco, but said that if they were
"it is just a hangover" from their
investigation of the shipowners' la
bor troubles on the western sea
board.
