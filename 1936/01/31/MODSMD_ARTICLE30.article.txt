WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (A').â€”As
President Roosevelt submitted a re
quest for $2,249,178,375 to pay the
cost of the soldiers' bonus, House
leaders today turned thumbs down
on a voluntary tax bill.
Morgenthau Hesitant
House leaders opposed a new tax
bill unless President Roosevelt
urges it. Secretary of the Treas
ury Morgenthau at the same time
reiterated that he was ready to ad
vise Congress on taxes only if re
quested by it to do so.
"It looks like an impasse," smiled
Speaker Byrns in a conference with
newspaper mi n.
The President's bonus budget es
timates were referred to the Appro
priation:; Committee. A plan to
have the President's letter transmit
ting the estimates read in the House
was abandoned.
Inflationists Rally
Meantime House inflationists ral
lied behind the proposal of Repre
sentative Patman (Democrat) of
Texas, to issue new money backed
by gold seized from the Federal Re
serve Banks t aid received from
other sources by the Treasury.
Speaker Byrns said, however, that
a special rule would be necessary to
make the Pat man inflation plan in
order if the appropriations commit
tee brings the bonus estimate before
the House.
