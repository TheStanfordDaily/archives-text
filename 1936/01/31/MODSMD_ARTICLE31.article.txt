# Indians Advance On Berkeley Foes For Fray Tonight
## Luisetti, Turner Worry Bear Quintet; Cards Face Gaels Tomorrow 
### Warren Breed 
Stanford Cagers & Co., co-starring
"Agile Angelo" Luisetti and "Hand
some Howell-the-Hardwood Hero"
Turner, move in on Berkeley's Ed
wards Field G>m tonight for their
sixth conference game.
And instead of the widely adver
tised East L>nne tomorrow night,
they will play St. Mary's here in the
Pavilion—game to start at 8 o'clock.
Team Takes Best
This afternoon at 1 o'clock the
squad of 15 troupers will slip off to
the East Bay, where they will sleep
the afternoon out.
Again tonight Nibs Price's boys
will attempt to pierce the strength
ening Cardinal defense. If they
can't, they will again try to win
the ball game on long swishers,
like they almost did two weeks
back.
But if all goes well Agile An
gelo and Handsome Howell and
their mates will live up to the dope
and score a majority of the evening's
points. Ominous figure-in-the
woodpile, though, is the Berkeley
threat rung up last week-end when
he Bears crushed U.C.L.A. in two
games.
ttcrulars To Start
To start the fray Coach John Bur
vili pick present first five—Lui
setti, Turner, Captain Bryan Moore,
Art Stoefen, and John Calderwood.
Ready to pull of sweatsuits any
minute will be Bob Zonne, Sparky
Robertson, ana Bill Quade.
Zonne can go in at cither guard
or center, and they're consider
ing him the most improved player
in the outfit these days. He's be
come smoother, he's shooting
more accurately, and he's one of
the best at pulling shots off the
backboard.
Cal is worrying, not only about
the brilliant Card record so far,
but whether Hank Luisetti is go
ing to put in an evening devoted
to scoring points himself or an
evening of neat passing and feed
ing to his partners. For it's a
habit of Hank to go easy on the
foe once in a while and not al
ways shoot at every opportunity.
But when he passes, there's
Turner or Stoefen or one of the
others lurking under the basket
for cinch set-ups.
Nibs Price will start his regular
line-up of Captain Ray Olsen and
Bill Balsley at forwards, Chet Car
lisle at center, and Bob Herwig and
Don Jensen at guards. The lank
Richie Hay 's coming right along,
and will probably get into the game,
as will Harry Cordes.
