1 called the "foremost woman clown",
and her Comic Ballet will be pre
sented by tlve A.S.S.U. Qoncert
Series February 7 in the Stanford
Pavilion.
Schoop will be a novel departure
i from anything ever before presen
ted in the series, and her perfor
i mance will require elaborate stage
arrangements which are [already
under way, according to Naomi
Carpenter, Concert Series Mana
! ger. The stones of Schoop's ballets

tion to understand her performance.
