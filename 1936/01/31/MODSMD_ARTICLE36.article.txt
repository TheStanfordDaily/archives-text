# Quick Cure Found for Morning After

That dark brown taste in your
mouth and those green snakes 011
the wall can be removed twice as
quickly with insulin, the weli
known diabetes remedy. This
contribution to civilization is the
discovery of two doctors at the
Stanford School of Medicine in
San Francisco, Henry VV. New
man and Windsor C. Cutting.
Insulin injected into the veins
will speed recovery from hang
overs by 50 per cent, they found.
Their studies indicate that it is
not the insulin itself but rather
some other product of the pan
creas, obtained with insulin in
the commercial extraction of the
diabetes remedy, that hastens the
breaking-down and elimination of
alcohol.
