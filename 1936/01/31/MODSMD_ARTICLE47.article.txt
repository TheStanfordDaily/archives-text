# Vigna Leads Ruggers Against Club
## Team Bolstered By Return Of Reisner 
### 
Indian ruggers, led by Captain
Joe Vigna, will use their full
strength for the first time this sea
son when they meet the Olympic
Club fifteen on the-Stadium field at
3:15 o'clock. Second stringers are
slated to meet an alumni team an
hour before the feature match.
The varsity is strengthened by
the return of Joe Vij<na, who has
been out for two weeks, and
Johnny Reisner, just hack from
Hawaii with the football men.
With Reisner and Vigna back, the
team goes on the field against die
experienced Olympic Club with
the odds about even.
Coach Jim Wylie put his men
through their last scrimmage before
Saturday's game last night, and ac
cording to him the squad is in good
shape. The backs, Reisner, Kenny
Peters, and Vigna should be a scor
ing threat. A flight shift in the for
ward combination has improved the
scrum considerably.
Admission to the stadium will
he free on presentation of student
body cards. Admission charges
for the public will be 40 cents.
The starting line-up: forwards,
Myers, Mullins, Taylor, Merritt,
Richardson, Peters, Morrison, Part
ridge; backs, Mondavi, Reisner,
Rogers, Vigna, K. Peters, Hager.
