# Phelan Re-signed As Washington Coach
## 
### 
Doubt that the contract of Jimmy
Phelan, head football coach at J .he
University of Washington, would be
renewed was removed when a new
contract for one year was granted
by the Associated Students.
Phelan's status had been in doubt
since the end of the 1935 season, as
six years without bringing a cham
pionship to Seattle had caused talk.
The new salary was not announced,
although it was believed to be close
to the $9500 he received last year.
