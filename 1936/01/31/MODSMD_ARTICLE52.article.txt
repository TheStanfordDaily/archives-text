THE CHALLENGED:
THEN SHOWED EM

Early this week The Daily spoke
of two basketball guard-center j
combinations having it out for the
first-string berths. It was men- j
tioned that the Zonne-Robertson
set-up at *hat time had the edge
over Moore and Stoefen. That com
ment started the ball rolling, liter
ally.
II seems that Dinty and Art '
figured that they would like to
prove they could match anything i
the newcomers could do. So
they asked Coach Bunn to let J
them choose three other men and j
play the other string of Luisetti, I
Turner, Calderwood, Zonne, and j
Robertson.
And so it was that Wednesday j
afternoon they went at it, Stanford j
varsity vs. Stanford varsity. Cap
tain Dinty Moore headed the chal
lenging outfit of Stoefen, Bill Quade,
Ken Bell, and Nelly Heath against
Luisetti, et al.
After 10 minutes of play Dinty's
gang had a good load. At the end
of the second 10-minute period they
were still ahead, and decided that
the game should end there. \
But Luisetti's outfit talked |
Bunn into another 10-minute pe- i
riod, so they went at it again. It
was then that they pulled a typ
ical "Stanford" and closed in to
win by one point. Final score: j
Moore, et al, 19; Luisetti, et al, 30. j
Dinty and Hank tied for high
point honors with eight apiece,
Turner made seven, and Zonne and
Stoefen each tallied five.
Of course the whole idea was
to line things up for that game ;
with the Bears tonight and un- j
doubtedly the intersquad battle i
did much to decide who would he j
in the starting team.
Bunn says that he'll lead off with i
Moore and Stoefen, as he has in the
past, and then use Zonne and Rob- '
ertson later if the first two aren't ;
"hot." It would appear, however,
that Mr. Moore and his running
mate Art used their heads when
they issued that challenge.
