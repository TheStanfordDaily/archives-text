# Chinese Grad Edits 'Times'
## Chinatown Daily Run By Stanford Journalist 
### 
From early morning until late at
night Churchill T. Chui, graduate
student, conducts journalistic activ
ities which take him from Stanford
classrooms to the editor's office of a
San Francisco newspaper.
Mr. Cliiu, now in his second
quarter of journalism work here,
is editor of the Chinese Times, an
afternoon daily with circu
lation. He puts out the paper in
the morning, attends classes here
three afternoons a week, and
writes editorials at night.
He graduated from the Univer
sity of California in 1929 as a psy
chology major, now is working
toward his master's degree, and has
arranged to seek a doctor's degree
later with a psychology major and
journalism minor.
Since he started his courses here,
Mr. Chiu says his paper has bene
fited to a great extent in improve
ment of editorial policy and "busi
ness profit."' The Times, he says,
has more college graduates in its
editorial department than is usual.
He believes university training is
"almost mandatory because news
paper work embraces every angle
of knowledge."
Since Mr. Chiu attended Stanford
lest winter the Times has subscribed
to a pictorial service and now is the
only Chinese paper in this country
using pictures daily. The paper has
two correspondents in China, re
ceives special papers from China
daily, and has three translators to
transcribe English news for its Chi
nese readers.
