### 
"If we can keep 'em under 20
points, we ought to beat 'em." Thus
spoke Jimmy Bradshaw yesterday
after putting his frosh basketball
team through its final drill before
the game with the St. Mary's frosh,
Saturday night in the Pavilion. In
dian and Gael babes will tangle at
6:30 o'clock in a preliminary to the
varsity affair.
The Thirty-niners stressed de
fense again in a brisk workout.
Second-stringers took the ball
against the regulars until the last
few minutes, when Messrs. Cal
kins, Kessel, Zonne, McArthur,
and deWitt assumed attacking
roles.
Wally deWitt worked with the
regulars in Dick Neeley's guard po
sition, but this means no change in
the starting line-up. Bradshaw
used the big football player in
Neeley's place only to protect him
self against possible injury to
Neeley or Pete McArthur.
Feeding team-mates around the
foul circle when not in position to
shoot, the first team looked faiily
good in yesterday's offensive drill.
Bradshaw's men may have to look
more .than fairly good Saturday
night, since the St. Mary's team will
be no set-up.
