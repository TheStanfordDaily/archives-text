## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Bookstore Profit Question Still Yearns For Equitable and Workable Suggestion 
### 
With the opinion vote less than two weeks
away, and much of the saying already said,
no one has yet advanced a particularly wor
thy plan for disposing of the Bookstore prof
its, which President Lesley points out are
quite likely to arise—though not in startling
amounts.
The rebate is a nice, equitable sort of plan,
well based in democratic roots, but it's im
practical as all get-out. Each student this year
averaged about 20 cents, next year he might
average about 75 cents. That little pocket
money might make him feel quite happy, but
it's hardly enough to justify a two or three
hundred dollar item for accounting costs in
redistributing profits to customers.
Then, too, that possible $2,700 is a nice,
round lump sum when it's all in one spot and
not dribbled out to customers by quarters,
halves, and dollars.
What an opportunity the Bookstore direc
tors threw to the students in inviting the lat
ter to suggest uses for prospective profits,
lint scarcely a practical suggestion has lifted
its head.
The first, and obvious, suggestion was that
Bookstore should make "internal economies,"
reduce profits to nil. For a multitude of rea
sons, this is impractical—it leaves no operat
ing margin, prices are to an extent uncuttable,

and so on.
The only other suggestions of note were
those that came out in Ex Committee when
the opportunity was first announced —name-
ly, a fiction library for student use, applica
tion of profits to the Memorial Hall debt, a
direct grant to student aid.
The library scheme has some merit, but as
many holes as a sieve. It is very expensive
to keep up, and serves but a small proportion
of the student body, after all. The application
of the funds to the Memorial Hall, too, has
some merit in that it would save interest on
that indebtedness, but it is by no means cer
tain that Bookstore directors would turn over
the store's profits to such a far-removed use.
Which leaves the direct grant to student aid
as the remaining alternative. Student aid is
doubtless an entirely worthy cause, would
put the money where it would do a lot of good,
but it too has little connection to Bookstore
finance and possibly students will hesitate to
recommend it to the Directors.
So the field is still wide open for practical
suggestions, but speed in their conception is
becoming vital. The poll of student senti
ment is to be on February 11. In order to put
any further propositions on the ballot*, the
idea would have to be put before Ex Commit
tee this coming Tuesday, February 4.

ly, a fiction library for student use, applica
tion of profits to the Memorial Hall debt, a
direct grant to student aid.
The library scheme has some merit, but as
many holes as a sieve. It is very expensive
to keep up, and serves but a small proportion
of the student body, after all. The application
of the funds to the Memorial Hall, too, has
some merit in that it would save interest on
that indebtedness, but it is by no means cer
tain that Bookstore directors would turn over
the store's profits to such a far-removed use.
Which leaves the direct grant to student aid
as the remaining alternative. Student aid is
doubtless an entirely worthy cause, would
put the money where it would do a lot of good,
but it too has little connection to Bookstore
finance and possibly students will hesitate to
recommend it to the Directors.
So the field is still wide open for practical
suggestions, but speed in their conception is
becoming vital. The poll of student senti
ment is to be on February 11. In order to put
any further propositions on the ballot*, the
idea would have to be put before Ex Commit
tee this coming Tuesday, February 4.
With the opinion vote less than two weeks
away, and much of the saying already said,
no one has yet advanced a particularly wor
thy plan for disposing of the Bookstore prof
its, which President Lesley points out are
quite likely to arise—though not in startling
amounts.
The rebate is a nice, equitable sort of plan,
well based in democratic roots, but it's im
practical as all get-out. Each student this year
averaged about 20 cents, next year he might
average about 75 cents. That little pocket
money might make him feel quite happy, but
it's hardly enough to justify a two or three
hundred dollar item for accounting costs in
redistributing profits to customers.
Then, too, that possible $2,700 is a nice,
round lump sum when it's all in one spot and
not dribbled out to customers by quarters,
halves, and dollars.
What an opportunity the Bookstore direc
tors threw to the students in inviting the lat
ter to suggest uses for prospective profits,
lint scarcely a practical suggestion has lifted
its head.
The first, and obvious, suggestion was that
Bookstore should make "internal economies,"
reduce profits to nil. For a multitude of rea
sons, this is impractical—it leaves no operat
ing margin, prices are to an extent uncuttable,

and so on.
The only other suggestions of note were
those that came out in Ex Committee when
the opportunity was first announced —name-
