# No Smoking in Exes Rule Hasn't Sunk in Yet
## 
### 
Rules and regulations passed by Ex Com
mittee usually carry weight and are abided
by, bill one of Ihe most recent ones seems to
have been overlooked. A rule against smok
ing in Quad rooms during examinations was
ollicially put into efleet by the committee last
Tuesday night.
Numerous exes given since the passage of
the rule, however, seem to indicate that a
number of students still persist in lighting
up and filling the room with smoke to the
evident discomfort of the non-smokers. Tra
dition, courtesy, and insurance rates gave
good basis for the legislated measure, but
added warning seems necessary if Men's and
Women's Councils are not to be swamped
with violators in the coming weeks.
