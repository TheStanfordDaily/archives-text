# Time Marches On But Theater Dedication Lingers
## 
### 
Work on Stanford's much-planned Memo
rial Hall gradually progresses, but plans for
the dedication of that Hall seem to have come
to a decided standstill.
On the lf)th of last month word came to
the Daily that tentative plans had set the
ceremony for February 15. Now the first of
February is here and inquiries bring out the
fact that neither the Committee on Public
Exercises nor the student theater committee
knows much about it.
The trouble seems to lie with a former sec
retary of the Public Exercises Committee who
with the co-operation of the student commit
tee had in her hands a set of tentative plans

i lor the dedication ceremony. Over the Christ
i mas holidays the Committee decided on a
j change of secretaries, and with the change
| went the tentative theater plans.
He that as it may, it seems about time that
Ihe respective committees get oil' the prover
bial dime and draw up plans of appropriate
impressiveness for the dedication of such an
important undertaking.
A ceremony of this type should necessarily
he planned far in advance, to remove any pos
sibility of a "Hop." The committees have but
fifteen days to live up to their former plans of
a mid-February dedication. If they can get
together a program in that short time that will
do justice to Ihe occasion, and to Stanford
University, more power to them. Hut they'll
have to work fast.
