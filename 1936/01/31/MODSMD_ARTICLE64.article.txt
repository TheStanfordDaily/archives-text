NOCTURNAL CLASSES
The moon . . . that incandescent grapefruit rind
on this last day of January . . beams on the uncon
ventional ... as many a dark lane will evince. With
favor . . . then . . . the orb of night should shine on
college classes held in the evening.

Imagine a proclamation which, with the joyous
suddenness of the twenty-first amendment, would
forever banish that arch-fiend disturber of early morn
ing slumber—eight o'clocks. Picture a decree that
would divorce the forenoon from dull, sleep-conducive
lectures and marry it to the opportunity for study
and lesson preparation during the youth of the day.
Such would it be if 8 a.m.'s were made into 7 p.m.'s
and 11 a.m.'s were transformed into 10 p.m.'s.

The more we think of it, the more it seems like a
Utopia. It's comparable to the Townsend stultiloquy.
The merits and advantages are as apparent as the
motives of girls who talk to professors after class,
and the defects can't be proven unless the thing is
tried.

The school day as it now is presents a paradox.
In the morning, Monday excepted, one has at least a
little energy, and it must burn itself out while one
tries to find a comfortable position in three or more
successive sets of unbelievably uncomfortable seats.
And in the evening after the exertions of the day have
created a fag that even a Camel can't counteract, one
feels fit for little more than a picture show or the
consumption of lager. Inasmuch as classes require the
least total energy output of any phase of activity, why
shouldn't they be held when energy is at low-tide
level?

Classes from 7 to 10 in the evening couldn't burden
the student. It would even be conveniently econom
ical. ("I can't take you down to Filler's tonight,
Susan, I got a 9 o'clock.") And think how romantic
would be a biology lecture on the mating of Chinese
liver flukes with mellow lunar rays slanting through
the window. Then if 20 pages of German translations
are assigned for the morrow, you could sleep off the
ensuing wrath and do it with a clear head in the
morning.

But no need tell us—it's a futile idea. As much as
we might like postponing the unpleasant part of the
day until the sun goes down, we can't overlook con
vention and the fact that the faculty likes to play
bridge in the evenings. Sad as it is, we have an in
ward assurance that 8 o'clocks and their evil sisters
will always remain on the calendar. And the tiroloss
moon must continue to look into dark lanes for un
conventionalities. —John McClelland
