Those old traffickers in teraffic fines, the Men's
and Women's Councils, have a policy now that finite
men with infinite numbers of labs: on the day Men's
Council meets can go before Women's Council and
plead their case.
This system works fine, except that last week one
of the boys got fined $2.50 for driving with "undue
caution."
Probably had both hands on the wheel, the rat.
The Women's Council has tried to back cut of it
though, saying that it was all a clerical error. "With
out due caution," is what the women meant to say.
Probably had both eyes on the heel, the rats.
After waiting and waiting for a whole month now,
Our Hasher has not received any leap year proposals
other than, "Go jump in the lak'.-."
If Stanford had any arts, a certain Palo Alto lady
would be the patron. She frequently gives generously
of her hospitality to intellects among the faculty and
students. In her hallway there is a guest book, in
which visitors please register. On the roll of honor
is inscribed the name: Ray Lyman Wilbur. The com
ment after isâ€”"Thanks, for a swell evening."
As a matter of public policy, however, I explain
that the "swell" is in quotes.
