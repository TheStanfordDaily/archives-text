Tlie Editoi, Sir:
This is directed to the two young j
"things" who pose as "Farmerettes." j
What seems to be the matter?
Can't you get a date, or are you i
really trying to help the Rough? It j
sounds sorta fishy to me. Who ever j
j heard of a Stanford girl who was
willing to go on a date such as you
I suggested?
Every girl I have ever dated, save
; two, have taken me for everything
I'm worth. That may be anywhere
from two cents to two million; but
I'm darned if I can imagine any
Stanford girl who'd be content with
i a show, a milkshake, and a bus. j
j Most of them require a car and
I they'll hardly notice you for any
! thing less than a new 12-cylinder
| one.
Truthfully, the entire bunch of
| "terrific" Stanford women give me
I the jitters. There are a few excep- j
tions, but I feel safe in saying they
| are the most mercenary bunch of
! co-eds I ever heard tell of.
They seem sweet enough when I
I you have the dough, but when you're j
| broke . . . Did it ever occur to you j
| girls that we have other things to
i do? . . . You know darned well it
isn't possible for you to enjoy your
; selves for $1.51 . . .
I The less you dames think about
money and the more about the date, 1
j the better you'll get along . . . You
j too, Susan.
