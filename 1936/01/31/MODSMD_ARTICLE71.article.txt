# THEIR OWN MEDICINE

The Editor, Sir:
All this quibbling about men
and women . . . seems thoroughly
useless.
It's a known fact that any male,
with a choice between two attrac
tive girls, will try to get the least
available â€” regardless of expense.
Why? Probably the same reason
the girls want to go with the fel
low who doesn't phone.
Be that as it may, the fact re
mains, the more dates a girl has, the
more she gets, and vice versa. Too
bad, but true.
Strange that fellows rate a girl
on the number of times she's "cut"
at a jolly-up . . . Some of the girls
on the sidelines are just as attrac
tive and nice as those that change
partners incessantly . . . Many fel
lows just cut where the cuts are
thickest and battle to dance with a
girl just because there are other
males in the vicinity.
Don't they trust their own taste?
. . . If a guy gets stuck with some
girl who isn't known yet ... he
cranes his neck, not even subtly
. . . and the girl he's with may be
really nice, if he'd only notice it.
I would like to see a leap-year
jolly-up. For once let the girls only
do the cutting. Let's give these cot
ton-brained, cord-wearing, conceit
ed, overgrown adolescents a dose of
their own medicine.
