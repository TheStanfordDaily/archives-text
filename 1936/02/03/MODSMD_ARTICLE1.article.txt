# Moore Warns Of Dictatorial Measures In Neutrality Bill
## Senator Johnson States Measure Would Result Contrary to Expectation 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (/P).â€”Se
crecy of Senate hearings on the Ad
ministration neutrality bill was
shattered today with disclosure that 1
John Bassett Moore, former World
Court member, had characterized
the measure as a "curious blend of
homicidal with suicidal mania."
Moore's statement, presented in
executive session of the Foreign
Relations Committee, warned that
the hill would create "the worst
form of dictatorship ever set up,"
and asserted it was designed to
permit the United States to co
operate with tiie League of Na
tions.
The Uement was made public
by Senator Johnson (R., Cal.),
avowed critic of the Administration
plan, despite an injunction of secrecy
from the committee. The California
Senator called Moore, who lives in
New York City, "the greatest living
authority upon international law."
Johnson said he agreed with
Moore "that the pending legislation
will not accomplish the result that
all desire, of keeping us out of war
and making us neutral in any con
flict, but will have exactly the oppo
site effect."
Senate committee hearings will
he continued on the measure this
week. A companion bill already
has been reported to the House,
and a rule for its consideration on
the floor will he sought Tuesday.
The Senate Munitions Committee
on Tuesday will resume its hearings
on factors involving United States
entrance into the World War, with
J. P. Morgan and his associates
again on the stand.
In a 10,000-word discussion of
the proposed neutrality legislation,
its intent and probable effect,
Moore charged it was bred by a
"plaque of propaganda." He aimed
his sharpest fire at the plan to
permit the President to curb ex
ports of war materials.
Moore said the assertion that
American became involved in the
World War by protecting its trade
was "destitute of foundation." The
United States got into that con
flict, he said, by "taking the posi
tion that armed belligerent mer
chantmen were to be considered as
peaceful vessels."
Moore added that when this gov
ernment suggested armed merchant
men should be put under belligerent
restrictions, England threatened to
keep British vessels out of American
ports.
