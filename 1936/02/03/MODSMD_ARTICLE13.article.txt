# Chappie To Dish Out Dirty Rushin' Dirt In Issue Thursday
## 
### 
Chappy's chappy, happy Coppy,
announces the unexpected arrival of
a sisterly and brotherly pamphy
dedicated to the dirty Rushin' where
dirt will be dished in large dishes
at the party, party, party on Thurs
day. When ole boy freshy was asked
what house he had gone, he said,
"I've gone—nuts!"
The statement being acknowledg
ed, Coppy went on to tell a thrilling
tale: Alfalfa Floozie has been de
prived of its pledging privileges,
and all the silly sobbing sorority
sisters have gone to drown their
active sorrows with a Tappa Nu Keg
from up the Row, Rho, roll your
car gently down the hill—if you
can't get it started.
