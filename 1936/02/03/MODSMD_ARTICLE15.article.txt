# Twitty Speaks On KGO Tonight
## Embryo Development Is Radio Hour Subject 
### 
"Directive Forces in Embryonic
Development" presented by Dr.
Victor C. Twitty, will be the subject
of the Stanford University Radio
Hour tonight at 8 o'clock over KGO.
Dr. Twitty is associate professor
in the School of Biology ana is well
versed in embryology. He came to
Stanford from Yale University.
The technique employed by em
bryologists is microsurgery. Using
minute surgical instruments and
magnifying the object—say, a frog
egg, which is about the size of a
buckshot—Professor Twitty locates,
for example, the material that will
form a limb and grafts it on the
head to observe its development. By
means of such technique embry
ologists are able to study the fac
tors that underlie and control devel
opment of the embryo.
