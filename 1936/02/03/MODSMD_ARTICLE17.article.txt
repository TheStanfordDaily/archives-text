Mandolin strumming and chess]
playing were favorite pastimes of j
the original Stanford roughs, if or
ganizations pictured in Volume I of
the Stanford Quad, published in
1894, prove anything. A glance
through the pages of the first Stan
ford annual gives a good indication
of what life on the Farm was like
in the days when Palm Drive was
used for horses and buggies.
In those times, Stanford didn't
have its Rally Committee or its
Cardinals, but "activity" organiza
tions such as the mandolin, chess,
and smoking clubs. Sword and San
dals foreshadowed the appearance
of present societies, and a grand
cpen-air performance of "As You
Like It." the dramatic productions
on the Farm today.
Members of the pioneer class of
'95, the first to complete a four-year
course at Stanford, published the
first annual in their junior year.
Volume I boasted 308 pages, one
half the present size, and an artistic
motif of cupids and wreaths.
No Pictures
Absence of pictures is the most
striking difference between the
Quads of the '90's and the profusely

illustrated Quads of today. Faculty, I
senior, and fraternity pages con- I
tained only lists of members, the I
junior publishers having the only
picture.
Stress was laid on written mate- j
rial, with poetry and priize-winning 1
short stories crowding the annual.
There was even an ode to a foot- (
ball player, beginning, "I knew he
cut his classes, and I'd heard him !
flunk in history." Original music, i
such as the "Junior llop March" i
also had its place.
Ads Unfamiliar
Most unfamiliar of all are the
ads. "Pet" cigarettes were the best j
brand, and the "Golden West," a |
new six-story, fire-proof brickj
building, was San Francisco's lead
ing hotel. The Palo Alto and Uni
versity Stables guaranteed "busses,
hacks, carriages, two- and three- '
seaters to meet all Menlo and Palo
Alto trains," and "crackajack" rid
ers asked for Remington bicycles.
On the other hand. The Palo Alto 1
Times was even then "devoted to the j
interests of Stanford" and Roos i
Bros, were beginning to "know the
campus."

picture.
Stress was laid on written mate- j
rial, with poetry and priize-winning 1
short stories crowding the annual.
There was even an ode to a foot- (
ball player, beginning, "I knew he
cut his classes, and I'd heard him !
flunk in history." Original music, i
such as the "Junior llop March" i
also had its place.
Ads Unfamiliar
Most unfamiliar of all are the
ads. "Pet" cigarettes were the best j
brand, and the "Golden West," a |
new six-story, fire-proof brickj
building, was San Francisco's lead
ing hotel. The Palo Alto and Uni
versity Stables guaranteed "busses,
hacks, carriages, two- and three- '
seaters to meet all Menlo and Palo
Alto trains," and "crackajack" rid
ers asked for Remington bicycles.
On the other hand. The Palo Alto 1
Times was even then "devoted to the j
interests of Stanford" and Roos i
Bros, were beginning to "know the
campus."
Mandolin strumming and chess]
playing were favorite pastimes of j
the original Stanford roughs, if or
ganizations pictured in Volume I of
the Stanford Quad, published in
1894, prove anything. A glance
through the pages of the first Stan
ford annual gives a good indication
of what life on the Farm was like
in the days when Palm Drive was
used for horses and buggies.
In those times, Stanford didn't
have its Rally Committee or its
Cardinals, but "activity" organiza
tions such as the mandolin, chess,
and smoking clubs. Sword and San
dals foreshadowed the appearance
of present societies, and a grand
cpen-air performance of "As You
Like It." the dramatic productions
on the Farm today.
Members of the pioneer class of
'95, the first to complete a four-year
course at Stanford, published the
first annual in their junior year.
Volume I boasted 308 pages, one
half the present size, and an artistic
motif of cupids and wreaths.
No Pictures
Absence of pictures is the most
striking difference between the
Quads of the '90's and the profusely

illustrated Quads of today. Faculty, I

tained only lists of members, the I
junior publishers having the only
