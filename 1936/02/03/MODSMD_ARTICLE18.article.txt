# Indians Share Title Lead with Trojans After Loss To Bears
## Cagers Trounce Gaels 59-27 Saturday Night 
### 
Stanford fans over the week-end
watched four basketball teams fro
lic on the hardwood: California,
St. Mary's, Stanford at Berkeley,
and Stanford at Stanford. At the
same time they watched Stanford
slip into a conference tie with U.S.
C.for the top spot.
Stanford at Berkeley was beaten
by Cal, 39-35.
Stanford at Stanford beat St.
Mary's, 59-27.
Stanford at Berkeley was a team
in the depression cycle, one that,
bothered by the Berkeley Pavilion
jinx, could not quite make its shots

or free throws, one that passed wildly
at times, and one that was out-scored
by a leisurely and slow-breaking,
but ball-hawking and advantage
taking Bear.
Stanford at Stanford was a team
in the prosperity cycle, one that
fooled around, passed, and shot
happily, and never let the Gaels
have possession of the casaba long
enough to give the visitor's side
of the scoreboard much of a work
out.
Friday night John Bunn's boys
fought and played hard, but it was
just not their lot to win. It was in
the Cards, but is was not in the
cards. Little guys like Ray Balsley
and Captain Ray Olsen and big guys
like Chester Carlisle and Booming
Bob Herwig were forever underfoot
caging goals.
Figures showed, however, that
the Redshirts scored more field
goals than did the Blue and Gold.
The margin of victory was un
doubtedly where Cal sank 7 of 11
free throws, and the Cards swish
ed but 1 of 7 tried.
With Hank Luisetti and Bob Zonne
starring in their first big Eastbay
appearances, the Cards were the
flashier team, but Cal, with a slow,
methodical way of tossing the ball
around before shooting, was the
surer. It was like Andy Smith's
system of "kick and wait for the
breaks", and the breaks came very
nicely for Cal.
A little fellow named Balsley
did more than anyone else to win
for the Bears. Weighing about
135 pounds and looking more like
a vaudeville comedian than a
basketball star, he was thorn-in
side No. 1 for Stanford, inter
cepting, shooting, and playing a
fine game in general for the Bears.
Saturday night the locals came
back in fine form and thoroughly
routed the Gaels. Luisetti was phe
nomenal, doing about everything a
man can do legally on a baskeaball
court, but tall Art Stoefen flicked
in enough short pokes and made
some circus one-handcrs to score
22 points, one more than Hank.

Saturday night the locals came
back in fine form and thoroughly
routed the Gaels. Luisetti was phe
nomenal, doing about everything a
man can do legally on a baskeaball
court, but tall Art Stoefen flicked
in enough short pokes and made
some circus one-handcrs to score
22 points, one more than Hank.
Stanford fans over the week-end
watched four basketball teams fro
lic on the hardwood: California,
St. Mary's, Stanford at Berkeley,
and Stanford at Stanford. At the
same time they watched Stanford
slip into a conference tie with U.S.
C.for the top spot.
Stanford at Berkeley was beaten
by Cal, 39-35.
Stanford at Stanford beat St.
Mary's, 59-27.
Stanford at Berkeley was a team
in the depression cycle, one that,
bothered by the Berkeley Pavilion
jinx, could not quite make its shots

or free throws, one that passed wildly
at times, and one that was out-scored
by a leisurely and slow-breaking,
but ball-hawking and advantage
taking Bear.
Stanford at Stanford was a team
in the prosperity cycle, one that
fooled around, passed, and shot
happily, and never let the Gaels
have possession of the casaba long
enough to give the visitor's side
of the scoreboard much of a work
out.
Friday night John Bunn's boys
fought and played hard, but it was
just not their lot to win. It was in
the Cards, but is was not in the
cards. Little guys like Ray Balsley
and Captain Ray Olsen and big guys
like Chester Carlisle and Booming
Bob Herwig were forever underfoot
caging goals.
Figures showed, however, that
the Redshirts scored more field
goals than did the Blue and Gold.
The margin of victory was un
doubtedly where Cal sank 7 of 11
free throws, and the Cards swish
ed but 1 of 7 tried.
With Hank Luisetti and Bob Zonne
starring in their first big Eastbay
appearances, the Cards were the
flashier team, but Cal, with a slow,
methodical way of tossing the ball
around before shooting, was the
surer. It was like Andy Smith's
system of "kick and wait for the
breaks", and the breaks came very
nicely for Cal.
A little fellow named Balsley
did more than anyone else to win
for the Bears. Weighing about
135 pounds and looking more like
a vaudeville comedian than a
basketball star, he was thorn-in
side No. 1 for Stanford, inter
cepting, shooting, and playing a
fine game in general for the Bears.
