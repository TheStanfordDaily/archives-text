### 
Yesterday the oflicc gioumi nog
burrowed his way up through the
fetid growth in the Daily post of
fice box to give us the last word on
spring, when, where, why, what,
and how.
Although he usually obliges with
a courteous Stanford hello, this
time the ground hog just stared
and then dived hack, almost to
the level of a story on clean
rushing, which is far down in the
pile.
We couldn't reach him for a
statement, but he did tap out a
prepared message with his left
hind foot. The shadow was sim
ply terrific this year, he told us.
First off Susan asked him for a
date, then Swampum, the office
Indian, tried to nail him with a
loose toboggan-runner.
Moreover, it was raining and
that's no fair. "That weather de
partment again," the message ran.
"How can I he a good supersti
tion when even the scientists can't
guess right."
