# Blimp Carries Food To Isolated Island
## Medical Aid Requested By Fisherfolk; Supplies Remove Fear of Famine 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (/P). — A
dirigible full of stores landed on ice
locked Chesapeake Bay today to re
lieve the plight of 1500 Tangier
Island, Va., fisherfolk whose food
was running low.
With the shadow of famine
lifted, the water men immediately
thought of relatives and sent word
back to the mainland by rescuers
who took Red Cross food to them
by the only course open to the
island—the air.
Commander Karl Lange, who set
a 150-foot blimp down on the ice
with the aid of eager hands of
islandt rs, brought back one message
to James Thome of Baltimore, say
ing, "Come at once; two children
very ill." He said the note was
handed to him by a woman.
Occupants of a small plane
which followed the blimp said na
tives urged that a surgeon be sent
to the island along with medical
supplies.
Reports of distress from illness
conflicted. One case of pneumonia
was reported, but another note sent
by the airship said the islanders
were "fortunate in having a good
doctor."
Colin Herrell. directing the Red
Cross activities, said a minister
would he flown to the island from
Cristfield, Md„ with authorization
"to arrange for any additional
supplies necessary."
A Coast Guard cutter, the Unalga,
was standing by and reporting by
wireless from a position two miles
off the island shore. The Coast
Guard ice breaker, Antietam, had
orders to proceed to the area tonight
to assist in opening a 15-mile chan
nel to the island from the mainland.
The dirigible unloaded 1000
pounds of staples there today, and
Commander Lange reported that
apparently all signs of distress had
been dispelled.
Acting on this l'eport, Representa
tive S. D. Bland (D., Va.), who in
stigated the relief efforts, and Her
rell said their activities were over
unless instant need should develop.
