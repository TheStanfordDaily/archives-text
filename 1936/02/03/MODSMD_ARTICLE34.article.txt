# Minor Changes Would Improve Rush System
## 
### 
"With a few minor changes, con
sisting chiefly in the application of
the honor code, the present rushing
system could be made okeh," an
nounced Jim Reynolds, president of
the junior class and varsity track
man, in an interview yesterday.
If all of the fraternities could be
persuaded to comply with honor
code', and turn in all violators of the
rushing rules whom they know
about, the Interfraternity Council
would not have to worry about re
organizing the present system, con
tinued Reynolds. All that the Row
needs to do is to take the respon
sibility for rushing infringements,
and by opposing, end them.
Reynolds was emphatic in say
ing that he did not think that we
should adapt the system which is
used by the University of Califor
nia—that is pledging in the first
two weeks of school. Under this
system neither the fraternity nor
the student has a chance to de
cide upon what course to take. At
least the pledges at Stanford get to
know a little about their brothers
before pledging.
In conclusion, Reynolds added
that he thought that any fraternity
which was caught in an infringe
ment of the rushing rules should be
punished. If the honor code is used
in this matter most of the houses
will not have the nerve to do any
illegal rushing. They will realize
that they can't help but get caught,
and that it. is not worth the risk to
try and get by with anything—espe
cially when none of the other frater
nities are doing anything.
