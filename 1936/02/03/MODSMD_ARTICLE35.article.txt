## 
### 
Norm Bright, ex-Stanford stu
dent now teaching in Sunnyvale,
made his debut in the New York
indoor track season Saturday night
by placing fifth in the classic Wan
amaker Mile event of the Millrose
Games at Madison Square Garden.
Joe Mangan, formerly of Cor
nell, won the race in 4:11 flat,
outsprinting Gene Venzke of
Pennsylvania by two feet, who in
turn was two feet ahead of Glenn
Cunningham, world's indoor and
outdoor record holder, who had
set the pace for all hut the last
of the eleven laps.
Fourth place went to Archie San
Romani of Kansas State, 40 yards
behind; Bright followed 30 yards
behind him, and sixth place went
to Don Lash, the Indiar>a boy who
defeated Bright at New Orleans
last December.
Bright offers and needs no excuse.
Having worked out in preparation
but once, having flown 30()0 miles
the night before, and wearing a
sweet case of poison oak might be
listed. But some of the best run
ners that ever lived never even saw
the finish of a 4:11 mile.
