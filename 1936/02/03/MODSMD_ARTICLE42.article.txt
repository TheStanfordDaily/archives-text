WITH THE SOUTHERN ITAL
IAN FORCES AT NEGHELLI, Jan.
30 (delayed) (A'}. â€”The swift motor
ized Italian columns of General Ru
dulfo Graziani have driven back the
I forces of Ras Desta Demtu 80 miles
further along the Ganale Doria to
ward Alatta.
Moving with the speed and effi
ciency of American police radio
cars, the motorized Fascist caval
ry men pushed the defending
forces to the region half-way be
tween I)olo and Addis Ababa.
The Ethiopians met the Italian ad- t
I vance with a fierce counter-attack
! at Alatta, but were overcome.
In capturing Wadara, the Ethio- '
pian chieftain was said to have
lost ' bis last stand" as the Italian
"Hell on Wheels" column of ma
chine gunners and infantry has
been advancing too fast for the
Ethiopians.
The Ethiopians were reported to
i be retreating in panic, but fighting
| desperately. They are mostly afoot,
| and, with only camels to carry them,
! are unable to retreat faster than the
| Italian trucks can pursue.
A second Italian division contin
ued pushing along the Dawa Par
ma general front near the border
of the Kenya British colony.
This advance has already cap-
J tured Sadei, Malca Ghersi and
! Malca Mum, where terrific battles
amid dark African jungle settings
j reportedly resulted in heavy Ethio
-1 pian and scattered Italian casualties.
