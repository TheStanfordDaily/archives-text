BUNN ANALYZED IT
LAST WEEK
"If we go over to Cal expecting to
dump those fellows easily, I'm afraid
we'll wake up Saturday morning
with that dark brown taste in our
mouths."
Those were John Bonn's exact
words last week, while he was
speculating on Stanford's chances
to defeat California last Saturday
night. And now, since that game is
history, we can look hack and see
that mentor Bimn just about hit
the nail on the head.
Stanford did expect to defeat Cali
fornia, started out playing slip
shod ball, then tightened up when
it was a little too late. It was a
close one, but the Bears earned their
victory every bit.
It's too had that Art Stoefen
couldn't have had his "hot" night
at Berkeley instead of in that game
with the (iaels here Saturday.
That would have made a big dif
ference.
But Stanford is still in good con
dition as far as Conference placings
are concerned and it becomes even
more apparent that those two games
with U.S.C. in Los Angeles on the
21st and 22nd of this months will
mean much. And, of course, there's
still that Cal jinx to be reckoned
with.
SECRET OPERATIVES
SPEAK AtJAIN
Speaking of U.S.C.—here is a squib
from Bob Ray's sports column in the
Los Angeles Times last week. It
seems that Mr. Ray, like columnist
Art Cohn, has a secret opera
ative, undoubtedly mythical, who
similarly has things badly bawled
up. Says Ray:
"One of my collegiate operatives
has just ridden up on horseback
to inform me that Dud DeGroot
and not Hank Luisetti was the
hero of Stanford's 51-47 victory
over the Trojans haskcthallers
Saturday night.
"What! You say you didn't
know DeGroot was playing for
Stanford now because he grad
uated from the Farm several
years ago and just at present is
football coach at San Jose State
College. Well, that's right, but
Mr. DeGroot was one of the offi
cials at Saturday night's cage
clash and they tell me no man
ever displayed more loyalty and
devotion to his alma mater than
did Mr. DeGroot as he tooted
"Come Join the Band" on his little
whistle.
"Why, when the game was over
they say the Stafford rooters
never paid any attention to Lui
setti, who'd scored 30 points in
the game, hut rushed down to con
gratulate Ollicial DeGroot on his
great work.
"Not only that, but they tell me
I.yisetti was allowed to get away
with a charging foul every time
he dribbled down the court for a
shot, and is Sam Barry whoppin'
mad."
Guess we'll just have to wait until
the folks down south interpret the
S news to find out what really happens
over here in the Pavilion.
