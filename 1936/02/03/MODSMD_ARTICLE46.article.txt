# Card Ruggers Tie Olympic Club, 3-3
## Stars Suffer Injuries In Muddy Game John Morrison Scores Lone Stanford Points 
### 
Ruggers found the going plenty
tough last Satui'duy against the vet
erans of the Olympic Club and the
game ended with a 3-3 draw. In a j
preliminary the Palo Alto All-
Blacks beat the seconds, 3-0.
A sloppy muddy field slowed down
the fleet Indian backs and cut down
the running attack which has netted
plenty of scores this season. Johnny
Reisner, playing his first game since
his return from Hawaii, was taken
out early in the game after he suf
fered an injury to his collar bone j
which may keep him from active |
playing for several weeks.
Vigna Hurt
Joe Vigna broke open the old cut
he sustained two weeks ago from a !
head-on collision; however, he
should be in good condition for the
game with the Southern California j
aggregation next Saturday.
Johnny Morrison scored Stanford's
only try after a short dribbling rush
in the last period of the game. â– 
Ed Smith of the Olympic Club ral
lied to score a few minutes later.
The first half found both teams
about even. Neither could put the
considerably more experienced than
the Indians, although the latter
turned in a good game.
Indians Score
Late in the second period John
ny Morrison took the bail for the i
first and only Stanford try. Jim j
Mullens missed his conversion,
leaving the score 3-0 with only a few
minutes remaining. However, the
Olympic Club fifteen managed to
score a try, leaving the score even '
after they missed their conversion. !
According to Coach Jim Wylie, the
team "seemed to be dogging it," :
and if they do that next week
against the Southern California |
fifteen they will come out on the j
wrong end of the score.
