# Needham Stars For Freshmen In Swim Trials
## Medley Team, Lhamon Outstanding in Meet 
### 
The varsity-frosh swimming meet
slated for last Saturday turned out
to be more of a squad work-out than
a meet, as several of the frosh team
were unable to compete due to ill
ness.
Nevertheless, a full list of events
and races were run off and the
times turned in for the 440 free
style, 50-yard dash, and the frosh
medley team pointed out that Stan
ford mermen were improving and
getting in shape for their sched
uled meets.
Winfield Needham of the frosh was
the outstanding performer of the day
when he swam the 440 in 5:09, 1G
seconds under the Little Big Meet
record. Bill Lhamon, varsity, took
the 50 in 24.4 to make him the out
standing sprinter of the two squads.
The frosh three-man medley
team was cited by Coach Nort
Thornton as being particularly
good. Members of the team are
Dave Duncan, Don Towne, and
Winfield Needham.
Varsity men will open their season
this Saturday when they meet a
strong Olympic Club team in the En
cina pools at 2 o'clock.
