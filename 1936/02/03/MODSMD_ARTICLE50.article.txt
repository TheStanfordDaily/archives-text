# Frosh Await Cubs After St. Mary's Win
## 
### 
Having pulled a victory out of
another ragged game, Stanford frosh
baskcteers look back on a 28-22 win
over the St. Mary's yearlings and
forward to their first tussle with
California.
Saturday night the Pavilion was
the scene of the Thirty-niners' tenth
straight triumph, but Thursday
evening that string may well end
there unless Bradshaw's men play
their best game to date. The Bear
Cubs will probably trounce the
Papooses if the latter play as they
did against the Gael babes.
Spottiest of all Saturday was the
frosh passing. With the exception
of a few flashes involving Phil
Zonne, Lyman Calkins, and Jack
Kessel, handling of the ball was poor.
Defense and all-around floorwork
were mediocre. As usual, Zonne
was the sole player with a good
shooting eye. *
Intercepting St. Mary's passes
and dribbling down the court for
set-ups, Phil scored 13 points to
run away with high-scoring hon
ors. Kessel played his best game
of the season, and Calkins looked
good at times, hut the team was
not clicking as a unit.
Unable to work the ball in for
many close shots, the first-year men
relied mainly oil long ones, few of
which hit the spot. Pete McArthur
for once failed to sink his customary
three or four swishers from mid
court, and the Gaels kept Dick
Neeley away from the basket, where

he usually helps Zonne make "suck
er" shots.
In spite of their so-so play, the
Indians kept the lead after the
first few minutes. The score at
half-time was 17 to 12. Superior
passing by St. Mary's failed to
offset poor shooting and defense.
Meitz, a stocky guard, starred for
the Gael babes.
A big part of the success or fail
ure of the frosh season will go with
the Bear Cub game Thursday night.
Even if the Cards come through and
f-kin the Cubs, they must clear an
uther hurdle this week. That will
be set up by San Francisco's Low
ell High School, one of the city's
best prep quintets. The California
frosh recently beat Lowell in a close
game.
At the University of Minnesota
any co-ed found wearing a frater
nity pin is fined $10.

Defense and all-around floorwork
were mediocre. As usual, Zonne
was the sole player with a good
shooting eye. *
Intercepting St. Mary's passes
and dribbling down the court for
set-ups, Phil scored 13 points to
run away with high-scoring hon
ors. Kessel played his best game
of the season, and Calkins looked
good at times, hut the team was
not clicking as a unit.
Unable to work the ball in for
many close shots, the first-year men
relied mainly oil long ones, few of
which hit the spot. Pete McArthur
for once failed to sink his customary
three or four swishers from mid
court, and the Gaels kept Dick
Neeley away from the basket, where

he usually helps Zonne make "suck
er" shots.
In spite of their so-so play, the
Indians kept the lead after the
first few minutes. The score at
half-time was 17 to 12. Superior
passing by St. Mary's failed to
offset poor shooting and defense.
Meitz, a stocky guard, starred for
the Gael babes.
A big part of the success or fail
ure of the frosh season will go with
the Bear Cub game Thursday night.
Even if the Cards come through and
f-kin the Cubs, they must clear an
uther hurdle this week. That will
be set up by San Francisco's Low
ell High School, one of the city's
best prep quintets. The California
frosh recently beat Lowell in a close
game.
At the University of Minnesota
any co-ed found wearing a frater
nity pin is fined $10.
Having pulled a victory out of
another ragged game, Stanford frosh
baskcteers look back on a 28-22 win
over the St. Mary's yearlings and
forward to their first tussle with
California.
Saturday night the Pavilion was
the scene of the Thirty-niners' tenth
straight triumph, but Thursday
evening that string may well end
there unless Bradshaw's men play
their best game to date. The Bear
Cubs will probably trounce the
Papooses if the latter play as they
did against the Gael babes.
Spottiest of all Saturday was the
frosh passing. With the exception
of a few flashes involving Phil
Zonne, Lyman Calkins, and Jack
Kessel, handling of the ball was poor.
