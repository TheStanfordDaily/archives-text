# "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Member of the Associated Press Proposed Changes in Women's Rushing Fail to Permit More Normal Contact 
### 
Madly clawing, back-biting, and shaking
in fear and anger were the nine sororities lin
ing the Row a little more than two weeks ago
as their impractical rushing system collapsed.
Today those same nine Pan-Hell living groups
are sadly muttering, either about the pledge
class they didn't get, about the apparent do
nothing attitude of the committee on revision,
or about the too-formal nature and attitude
of the present system.
Because the system had collapsed, sugges
tions for substitutes were offered. But those
panaceas failed to take cognizance of the
basic ills and evils.
According to present indications, the old
rush period may be lengthened from a week
to ten or twelve days, with luncheon dates
abandoned. In this suggestion, as in the oth
ers, the basic reason for the collapse is not
touched. Those hindering, binding rules
which prohibit an informal contact with the
freshmen are not taken care of. In fact, the
system would be left in just as sad a stale as
before. This move would string the period
out, shatter more nerves, work sad results on
scholastic standards, and drain the women's
pocketbook.
Luncheon dates, so the women said, were

stupid, so ideas were introduced to do away
with those "stupidities." Following such rea
soning, we believe the entire system should
he junked. Hut this changing to all dinner
dates is worse than ever, more formal than
ever.
Instead of making the system less informal,
the tendency seems to make it more so.
According to proposed change, the enter
taining of freshmen during vacation is defi
nitely frowned upon. But, they add, "you can
keep 'old friendships'." That's nice. And so
another possibility to gain the sought-for less
formal attitude is junked.
Too many of the proposed changes for the
women's hlushahlc rush system fail to hit
the basic fault —the ban on the more normal
contact with the freshmen women. There is
too much dilly-dallying with the non-essential
things—things that don't get at the real cause
of the difficulty.
The women's rushing system must be re
vised and must permit less formality of con
tact, or the Row will continue to be plagued
by the devastating, back-biting exposes and
"mad-ons," like the one which so rudely upset
the campus a little more than two weeks ago.
