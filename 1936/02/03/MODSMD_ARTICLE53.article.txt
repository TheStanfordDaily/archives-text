# Air School Need Felt As Army Adopts Flying Flagship
## 
### 
Latest wrinkle in the army's development
of her air forces is the first Hying flagship that
will roar into the air and carry a command
ing general into the thick of battle where he
will direct and co-ordinate his forces to sweep
enemy planes from the sky.
The living flagship, a twin-motored Doug
las, has a lop speed of 120") miles an hour, a
cruising speed of 175 miles, and a service
ceiling of 23,200 feet —well out of range of
anti-aircraft guns. This is significant in that
flic army seems to be depending on aircraft,
instead of artillery, to stop aircraft.
This increasing development in army craft
as well iis the exploits of such men as Frank
Hawkes and Howard Hughes in their cross
counlry speed llighfs hold great interest for
over half a hundred air-minded Farm stu
dents who carry on their work or hobby with
out the aid of a school of aeronautics.
Classed as one of the leading universities
in the country and built in a location where
surroundings oiler wonderful opportunities
lor Hying, Stanford, it seems, is in a most
favorable position lo establish an air school.
