# How About a Little Action From Women Gym Authorities
## 
### 
Two weeks ajjo these columns suggested to
the authorities in the Women's Gym that
since that edifice was the major home of

campus dances, they do something about co
operating with decorating crews in allowing
them to go about their tasks.
But Friday the decorating crew reached the
Gym and was met with as little co-operation
as usual, even though the dance was a charity
all'air, and the decorators were in this instance
being paid with good A.S.S.U. money.
Early entry of decorators into the Gym
must be arrangcable. Perhaps if the Gym
authorities would realize that, after all, they
are running the Gym for the benefit of the
A.S.S.U. and are not arbiters thereof, tliis
decoration trouble could be ironed out.
