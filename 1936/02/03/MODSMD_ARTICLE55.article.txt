Our text for today is "Men," Chapter I in the Book
of Genesis, Verse I in the Book of Female Oppro
brium, and Line 1 in the Book of Dates.
But. before we proceed we'd like to contest one
idea that has been either directly expressed or implied
in most co-ed letters anent Sex on the Farm: wom
an s belief in the male's self-sufficiency and self-confi
dence.

Girls apparently don't know it, but boys have their
own troubles with love and its milder corollaries.
There is the consummate art, for instance, of saying
"Oil, I m so sorry," when she refuses your invitation,
with just the right cavalier spirit and eyelash-gym
nastics: "Oh, I'd love to, but I have a date."

There's art, too, in introducing her to the woman
killer without cutting the act to an obvious instant
of proximity.
There's the God-like self-mastery of the 11:30 p.m.
dance-floor grin; in being witty without being cynical;
in realizing that as a couple, you and she are an
algebraic sum, and you are the minus quantity, and
she knows it.
Can men have private agonies? They have them
under the lady's unsuspecting nose, sharing with her
the torturing realization of their blunders. Let the gal
not think that she disguises her reactions. Her mal
adroit «pple-polishing is as cruel as blunt criticism.

But we'd like to point out to the Rough that his
gallant maneuverings can be every bit as cruel, cer
tainly more thoughtlessly so. than those of any hell
cat who ever pursued the official pursuer.
We remember a freshman jolly-up where the com
mittee was working overtime to see that all the girls
had partners. The gals were asked to sit facing each
other on two rows of chairs stretching down the side
lines. The boys were asked to pick them off until
not one remained.
First the rating dolls were whirled into a series of
cut-ins approaching the fury of a Harlem razor-battle
and after that, elimination continued with equally
predictable mercilessness until only four girls were
left, then three.

There was high tragedy in those social remnants,
but unmindful of it were a few hundred Roughs hover
ing like cats at the gold-fish bowl for their chance to
scoop out the prize fish. Those three girls were never
granted even the dubious comfort of masculine pity.
There were bitter tears on Roble pillows that night,
oh brothers of mine—tears wrenched out in sparms
of hot humiliation and cold despair.
There could be no saving lies for those three girls;
they were forced to accept the sympathy of the others,
to admit they had failed.

Objectively speaking, it was story-book tragedy.
But between you and me, it was cruelty—cruelty as
callous as that any father's daughter could practice
on the muddling boy friend. —Bob Eisenbach
