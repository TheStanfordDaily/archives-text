The scandal of the week was drawn to a fitting
close Friday when the Sigma Chi rushing chairman
regained his fraternity pin from the Shirley Temple
of Stanford.
He recaptured the ornament under circumstances
as disastrous as those under which he lost it. At both
times, the blue-eyed charmer had the situation and
the rushing chairman completely under control.
Yes, he got his pin back, but he had to mortgage the
house and float a baby bond to do it. After fishing
out a capital outlay of ten bucks on candy, telegrams,
and flowers to announce his appointment to king
bee, the chairman was considerably staggered to re
ceive through the mail a pawn ticket, which informed
him that he could recover his property, his pin, and his
bachelor state by delivering into the hands of it local
jeweler the sum of $1.77. The lady had pawned his
pin to help pay for the cigars she sent him. Kind of
cute, isn't it?
The rushing chairman has decided that the next
time he wants to play with fire he will go home on the
range.
In the playground of the ancients, the venerable
cactus garden, the vandal hand of a 201 h century
capitalist has erected a sign advertising the Toyon
Formal.
Popular sport these days, now that Stanford women
refuse to spend your money in the city and shy away
from large cokes (because some high school romeos
vindicated high school romance and high school ro
meos in the campus opinion columns) is skidding.
It has no relation to trucking, the continental, or the
transcontinental. The idea is this: You call up your
wrong number and ask for a date to go skidding. The
gal immediately says "Yes." You then get your car
and take your little number down by the stadium, go
full speed ahead, slam on the brakes, and skid. The
Paly high waifs look on enviously and decide that
college life is wonderful.
While the dean's away the mice will play.
Are we men or are we mice?
