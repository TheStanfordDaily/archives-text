i The Editor, Sir:
To our dear, dear public:
How were we to know that an
1 expression of our "simple natures"
I would bring a deluge of letters and
j start a love-lorn column in the
Daily. Just to show you what simple
j souls we are—we'll come c lean.
| We are transfers and haven't met
I all the Stanford men as yet. We've
j been around enough to get a few
ideas about them—which we'll skip.
As for Cynical Soph, who we hate
with a vengeance—no wonder that
with men like you around we have
to proclaim from the housetops that
j we don't insist upon wining and din
| ing in the city every week-end.
Never yet have we refused a city
i date, but here's the point: Half the
| men on this campus would never
j dream of calling a girl and saying,
"Look, I feel silly. Let's see the
! Marx Bros, and then let the air out
of all the tires on University Ave
nue."
As for you, dear Eisenbach —we
don't even know what you look like,
but we don't like your attitude. If
j you don't like ours, stay out of our
j party.
Stanford men should be disillu
j sioned. They think a gill who does
[ n't have an extravagant taste isn't
j worth dating.
