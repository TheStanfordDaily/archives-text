The Editor, Sir:
So what? Socially, the lads are
damp behind »the ears says dear
Susan. Right back atcha, sez Bob.
Let's make it a free-for-all, says
| this male and that female. May I
add a wee voice saying, "So what?"
I figure every man—and woman,
too —for himself and the devil take
the hindmost. Or Bob or Susan can
take 'em, I don't care.
After all, what's a few bum dates
! in a lifetime? ...
Figure the number of dates pos
; sible per capita on this jolly campus.
! The greatest boomer of us all
I couldn't cover 'em hi four years . . .
Stanford is not as bad as all that,
I and when the ideal one crops up,
J the rest will count as naught.
Bloody but Uribowed
