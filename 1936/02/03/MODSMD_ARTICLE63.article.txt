# WISE UP, EISENBACH
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Has Mr. Eisenbach ever tried
taking a Stanford gal to the flicks
i on a week night? ... Or is it that
j he can't express his true soul cx
j cept on week-ends?
Also even the popular ones grow
sick of the same old highw-iy-hotel
-1 highway (with an occasional de
j tour) every week-end. Anything
j different, not necessarily expensive.
' is welcome . . .
With spring coming on. a ride is
i pretty good stuff . . . even in the
| afternoon.
So take stock of the assets and
liabilities, Mr. Eisenbach. Some
-1 thing must be wrong with the old
technique.
Love and no implications,
Kibitzer Kate
