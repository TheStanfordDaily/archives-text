The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Fullerton isn't in such bad
! shape. In Roble, slippers and curl
! ers are forbidden at all limes in the
I dining halls. It seems, however, that
J Mr. Fullerton had the decency to
take his curlers off before entering

| the dining halls, so he didn't run
I against that restriction.
I would like to point out to "Im
! pecunious" that funds are not all.
j Practically any girl he knows can
and does have a better time walk
ing with, just looking at, or even
studying with the "right one."
If "Impecunious" isn't the "right
one" for somebody, he has no right
;to scoff at jolly-up stander-around
| ers, and probably couldn't get a date
J for a formal anyway.
Perhaps I am sentimental, but I
j believe that, the fun of the evening
■ is not necessarily in direct propor
tion to the money spent.
