# DOWN TO BRASS TACKS

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford is a great school; but the
fact that it is at present socially un
balanced is inescapable. This mal
adjustment is merely due to grow
ing pains in the relative status of
women here, and will no doubt right
itself eventually; but meanwhile â€”
The situation has been brought up
by the present war raging between
the sexes. The original "Hands and
Feet," as well as various subsequent
passages, was a classic of select dic
tion and apropos accusation. Su
san's defense is equally pertinent in
its indictments.
Anyone who says that either
group on this campus is not as pass
able looking as that at any other
place obviously has not been using
his eyes. Sometimes we let our
prejudices run away with our
analyses.
However, in this writer's opinion,
admittedly prejudiced by elevated
ideals such as only the Old South
can instill, the Stanford Rough is all
that his name implies; his women
schoolmates are his full counter
parts in the lack of social graces and
the general ability to "get along."
But to attack is not to remedy.
I am a newcomer graduate; so it is
with a well-nigh impersonal and
impartial stand that I present the
following suggestions, not all of
which are mine, in a sincere hope
that they may be of some use to the
students or administration of this
fine place which I am rapidly learn
ing to love. I advocate:
1. Dancing instruction.
2. Required etiquette readings.
3. Mixed dining halls.
4. Weekly hour jolly-ups, with
someone in charge to direct "change"
and "ladies' choice" dances. (Works
well elsewhere, so-called "tea
dances" from 7 to 8 p.m.; non
dating, 10 cents admission).
5. A "leap year week." Take it up,
girls. Here is your chance.
6. Fellows, step back and give the
ladies a chance at the ride-taking.
(You mugs, there are so many girls
in school now with cars it'll pay
you.)

7. Girls, don't refuse to be picked j
up; it's discouraging. If you need
exercise, use your gym.
8. It is the ladies' obligation to
speak first, if there is to be any
speaking done. The Stanford women
certainly do not avail themselves of
this prerogative.
9. Cessation of this warfare and
an attempt at mutual sympathy and
understanding.
