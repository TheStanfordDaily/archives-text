"FIRST A GIRL"
At the Stanford
BNot for its time-worn story,
its much-used comedy situa
tions, or its mediocre direc
tion does Graumont-British's
production "First a Girl" rate a "B."
The picture is amusing because it
introduces Jessie Mathews and a
new song-writing team, Sigler, ;
Goodheart, and Hoffman, to Amer
ican movie audiences.
A story of the career of a fe
male impersonator who is a success
because "he" is a "she," the pro- |
duction moves fast whenever Miss
Mathews appears. She acts, sings,
and dances with such a charming
appeal that his ability as a come
dienne is never open to question.
Sonnie Hale, her off-stage husband,
proves a competent foil for her in
the comedy scenes.
Two songs, "Everything's in
Rhythm with My Heart" and "Close
Your Eyes," are now being plugged i
on the radio by Vallee and Powell. I
They're sure hits and prove that |
Ray Noble and Noel Coward are not j
the only Englishmen who can write
popular music.
"RIFF-RAFF"
Also at the Stanford
B"RifT-Raff" is perfectly'
named. If you find enter- !
tainment by going into the i
homes, lives, and loves of!
poor tuna fishers, you'll like this,
picture. Well acted and capably di- |
rected, "RifY-RafT" should attract
theater-goers who want to see Jean
Harlow's first appearance as a 1
"brownette."
Spencer Tracy as the rude, con
ceited, stupid here is so convincing j
that it makes one wonder what j
women will fall for next.
