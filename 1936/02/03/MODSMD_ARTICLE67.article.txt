# FRATERNITY INFORMATION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is apparent that "A busybody
not yet dry behind the ears" who
wrote about fraternities in the Jan
uary 29 issue of the Daily really
knows more about such organiza
tions than he is willing to admit in
his letter.
However, to aid in his enlighten
ment, it is suggested that he read a
pamphlet, "College Fraternities,
Their Origin, Purpose, and Value,"
published by the National Interfra
ternity Conference, whose secretary
is Mr. Russell C. McFall, 42 Broad
way, New York, N.Y.
It is also possible that Ed Little
field, chairman of the Interfrater
nity Board may have copies of this
publication. If not, lie is certainly
competent to provide the desired in
formation to those who do not un
derstand fraternities.
