Question for today's minute inter
views: Should Bookstore surplus be
returned to the student or be put
into a fund for some campus im
provement or addition?
Sherwood Armstrong, freshman
tennis star: "We put so much money
j into the school and its functions that
it is only fair that we get some
thing back when there is a surplus."'
Charles Knapp, outsider: "What
i about operating economics? Are
! there any?"
Sam Mattison, Phi Gamma Delta
I pledge: "Since the students are the
ones who make a Bookstore surplus
j possible, I feel that they should get
the rebates no matter how small they
' are."
Charles Richard Creamer, Chap
arral: "After due consideration I
strongly feel that the surplus should
i be pooled into a nucleus for a life
-1 long pension for Chaparral business
j managers."
Joyce Dunkerley, head Roble
sponsor: "Students seem interested
enough in getting a rebate, no mat
ter how small, in that they sign all
their rebate slips and claim the
money when rebates are given. It's
< their money, and their interest alone
I justifies the money return."
Dorothy Brookman, freshman
woman: "There is ample provision
for needed school projects, therefore
I students are in their rights to claim
| lebates from the Bookstore surplus."
