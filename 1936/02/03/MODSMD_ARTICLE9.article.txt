# Court Decision On TVA Awaited Today
## Strong Stand Expected On 'Power Yardstick' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (/P). -
Three more letters of the New Deal
alphabet—TVA—may come tum
bling from the Supreme Court's |
crucible tomorrow fused with ju- j
dicial approval or in the ashes of j
unconstitutionality.
Government lawyers generally j
looked for the long-awaited deci- j
sion on validity of the Tennessee
valley "power yardstick" program
when the nine justices convene
at noon after a two weeks' re- ,
cess.
They also foresaw a third possi
bility—that the court might decide
the TVA case without a direct rul
ing on whether the federal govern
ment is permitted by the constitu
tion to compete with private utili
ties in the sale of electricity.
The length of time the court
has taken to decide the case—it j
was argued December 17—was be- j
licvcd, however, to indicate that '
a positive stand on the important
power issue would be forthcom- |
ing.
Announcement also is expected i
whether the court will add another !
New Deal law—the 1933 Securities I
Act —to those passing under review J
for examination on how they square I
with the constitution.
