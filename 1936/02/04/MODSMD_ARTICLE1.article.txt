# Theater Group Confers with Wilbur Today
## Laying of Cornerstone Postponed as Officials, Committees Arbitrate 
### 
First step in the long-delayed
theater corner-stone laying will
be taken today, when the Theater
Committee meets with President
Ray Lyman Wilbur to confer on
possible.
Two months ago it was decided
that the Public Exercises Committee
should supervise the ceremony.
Tentative plans were made, and the
date set at February 15. Then the
committee secretary resigned, tak
ing all plans with her.
Recommendation Necessary
Most recent set-back occurred
when the Theater Committee dis
covered that President Wilbur's rec
ommendation was necessary before
the Public Exercises Committee
would co-operate.
Public Exercises Committee's
stand is that it cannot plan a pro
gram until it is officially authorized
to do so. Theater Committee's stand
is it can only assist in plans, which
were thought to be well under way
two months ago.
Construction Slow
Latest word from Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth is that the corner
stone laying will have to be post
poned until the end of February.
The entire concrete foundation must
be poured first, and construction is
behind the contemplated schedule.
"At least, we have a month to
finish plans," observes the com
mittee. '"If the Public Exercises
Committee won't take it over,
we'll complete plans on our own
and hope for official approval."
Meeting with President Wilbur
will be Wally Brooke, Bob Gros, A1
Hyman, Phi) Brown, and Annalee
Whitmore.
