# Men, You're Sissies! Ask Dr. Strong

Men, you're sissies!
We mean you guys in the English
department and the law school, and
we're excepting only agriculturists
and the engineers.
If you don't believe us, go talk to
Dr. Edward K. Strong, professor of
psychology, who learned about
women—and men —from a survey 1
that discloses some mighty "inter- ,
esting" things about the eternal !
question and answers to it.
Ho found that farmers and engi
neers are essentially masculine in
, interest, whereas writers, lawyers,
and ministers are essentially femi
nine. For another thing, high school
boys are more masculine than col
lege students.
i Furthermore, fellows, there's no
' hope. For as you grow older,
you'll become more, and more
feminine—in your interests—and
the women will get more and more
femaleish.
Dr. Strong obtained data for his
: study, "Interests of Men and Worn- |
! en," by testing three age levels, high !
! school students, collegians, and
; adults, using his own M-F (mascu
linity-femininity) tests.
The results released in the current
issue of the Journal of Social Psy
chology, show that males prefer me
chanical and scientific activities, ath
letics, legal, political, and army oc
cupations, selling activities, magic,
chess, rough-house initiations, work
for self-advancement, leadership,
and outside work to inside.
Women, i»ii the other hand, pre
fer literary activities, dislike talka- '
1 tive people (imagine!), borrowers,
( religious people, witty, blind and
crippled people, and the very old.
The only persons preferred by men
more than women is "men who
chew tobacco."
Fifty per cent of the Xvomen like
Henry Ford, but only 16 per cent

| of the men. Both sexes arc evenly
| divided in their approval of men
who use perfume, but only 3 per
cent of either sex like them. Sixty
eight. per cent of the women tested
preferred tall men to short, but only
26 per cent of the men expressed
similar approval.
And here's something. Only 1H
per cent of the men approve of
• private secretaries, as against 55
j per cent of the women!
Among items on which both sexes
rated themselves equally are: start
ing activities of my group, winning
friends easily, accepting just criti
cism without getting sore, having
more than my share of novel ideas,
being on time with my work, get
ting "rattled" easily, stimulating the
ambition of my associates, winning
confidence and loyalty, and being
approachable.
