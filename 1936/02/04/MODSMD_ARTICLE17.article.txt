# Guy Hagerty Urges New Election System
## 
### 
Guy Hagerty, sophomore class
president, yesterday joined other
campus figures in advocating a radi
cally-new system of electing Ex
Committee members—by organiza
tions rather than by classes.
Without hitting current members

of Ex Committee which, lie said,
are "exceptionally efficient," Hag- I
erty found the present system of i
popular representation "inadequate j
and artificial."
"The proposed method of electing
Ex Committee would certainly al- j
leviate the problems now faced.
Representatives are elected now
for popularity, not ability. There
is no guarantee that the most pop
ular man will he the most cap
able," hp said.
The system which (he sophomore
president advocates calls for an Ex
Committee elected by organizations.
One member each would be named
by Interfraternity Council, Pan-Hel
lenic, Inter-club Council, women's
dormitory officers. Publications
Council, Debate and Dramatic Coun
cil, and B.A.C. and Activities Coun
cil.
"Class divisions are artificial and I

| don't really represent student in
j terests. The new system would elect
I committeemen by the students' true
interests," said Hagerty.
"Before the present Ex Commit
tee can act, it must many times
call in expert opinion from the
outside. A committee under the
proposed plan would find no need
for this. The members themsel
ves would be experts on their own
particular subjects."
California and Princeton, Hager
ty pointed out, find the proposed
system extremely satisfactory. What
is lost, if anything, by dropping
; popular representation is gained by
j increasing ability and efficiency.
If Ex Committee passes the new
I plan, the student body will vote
upon it at the coming election.
