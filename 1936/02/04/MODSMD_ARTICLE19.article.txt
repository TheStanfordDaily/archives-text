# Debaters Will Meet Kansas
## 
### 
Two members of the varsity de
bate squad will be picked today to
meet the University of Kansas
speakers next Thursday at 4 o'clock
in Room 202.
Stanford speakers will uphold the
negative side of the question, "Res
solved, that Congress should be per
mitted by a two-thirds majority vote
to override any decision of the Su
! preme Court declaring a law passed
by Congress unconstitutional."
The forensic meet has been slated
as a non-decision affair. Coach Lee
Chapin favors this type of debating
as it. gives participants more of a
chance to improve their speaking
since less attention is given to op
ponents.
The Kansans will have met the
Universities of Oklahoma, Arizona,
Redlands, and U.C.L.A. before de
bating the Indian team.
