# By-laws To Be Considered by Ex Committee
## Tabled Amendments To Be Discussed Tonight 
### 
If last week's almost perfect at
tendance continues at tonight's
meeting, Ex Committee will dispose
of the last of the tabled by-laws.
Among the amendments postponed
for several weeks, which will prob- |
ably come up for vote tonight, are
Dramatic Council's request for
charter amendment End ' 1
regulations.
To Amend Charter
Dramatic Council contends that it
should be privileged to amend its
own charter, subject to a three- j
fourths Ex Committee approval. It
now must submit each change to the
committee, and a bare majority may |
defeat the amendment.
Granting of three exceptional j
awards for football, which will go to j
Ray Todd, Alex Trompas, and Fred â– 
Williams, will be completed. Frank
Alustiza's letter will probably also |
be appx-oved under the newly
enacted injury clause.
Discussion Planned . |
The student panel to discuss pro- !
posed revision of Ex Committee rep
resentation has been set for Thurs
day evening in the Little Theater.
It will begin after speeches of
A.S.S.U. candidates have been com- j
pleted. Present will be Professor
Edwin Cottrell, as political adviser,
and other faculty members, besides
any interested members of the stu
dent body.
