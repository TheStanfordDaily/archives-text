# Congress Leaders To Erase Rest of AAA
## F.D.R. Urges Repeal Of Cotton, Tobacco, Potato Control Acts Sugar Control Measure Not Disturbed by Administration Message 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (/P).—Con
gressional leaders moved quickly
tonight to carry out President Roo
sevelt's recommendation for removal
from the statute books of three of ;
the four remaining phases of AAA
crop control.
As new farm legislation advanced
- 1 '•'"n , . < ' executive for-
;ol
.ng "prompt
.1. ai 01 the banKhead cotton
control, Kerr-Smith tobacco and 1
potato control laws. He did not
mention the Jones-Costigan sugar J
control act.
"This recommendation is made," !
Mr. Roosevelt said, "because of
termination <|f the agricultural
adjustment act, to which the three
were auxiliary."
Capitol Hill spokesmen agreed
this should be done, Senator Rus
sell (D., Ga.) introduced a bill to
repeal the Bankhead law soon after
the message was read. Chairman
Jones (D., Tex.) of the House Agri
culture Committee said he would in
troduce repealers for all three laws j
as soon as possible.
It has been generally conceded
in Administration circles the three
laws were doomed by the Supreme 1
Court's AAA decision. Most Ad
ministration leaders, however, con
tend the sugar act was not dis
turbed.
Senator Vandenberg (R., Mich.),
who has been conferring with beet
sugar men on a plan in event the
sugar law is dropped, described the
situation as "chaotic," but contend
ed this act rested on a different ,
basis than the others because two- J
thii-ds of it had to do with quota j
limitations on imports to offset tariff J
cuts on Cuban raw sugar.
