Question for today's interview
was: Should Ex Committee mem
bership be by representation from
various campus organizations, or
from classes as in the present
system?
Dale Reimer, Delta Chi: "I think
the campus would be better repre
sented by the present system, but
more interest would probably be
created through representation of
organizations."
Hudson Trowbridge, Phi Gamma
Delta: "Friction between the Row,
halls, and clubs would undoubtedly
arise if organizations were to be rep
resented. The present system is the
best. Who suggested the other sys
tem, anyway?"
Ora Bomberger, Tri Delt: "I
haven't thought much about it, but
the present system with classes rep
resented brings unity throughout the
school. The other way couldn't reach
every group."
Mildred Davis, Lagunita Court:-
"I haven't given it much thought,
but the present Ex Committee seems
to have done all right so far in
handling situations satisfactorily.
Howard Loudon, S.A.E.: "The
class system is much more equal,
student body. Representation by
gathering members from the general
organizations would tend to form
cliques from one ruling class."
Jack Luppe, Beta: "Campus or
ganizations are the ones who carry
out the activities of the school, and
are the ones governed directly by the
Ex Committee. Therefore, they
should have a hand in the govern
ment of the Ex Committee."
