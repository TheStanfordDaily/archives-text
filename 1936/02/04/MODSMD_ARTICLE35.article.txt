# Most Champs Hail from West! Why? Mears Finds Answer

Bobby Grayson, Ben Eastman, Helene Madison, Louis Novo, Jack
Medica, Lavvson Little, Helen Wills Moody, California crew—Westerners
all, and certainly tops in their particular sports. Take any sport—well,
almost any—and you'll find the title-holder was almost invariably born
west of the Rockies. ♦ ___ —

This question of Western athletic
leadership has become the hobby of
Eliot G. Mears, professor of geogra
phy in the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He's studied all types of sport |
records, but track seems to interest !
him most.
Geographic Comparisons
His academic specialty being geog- '
raphy, he's been comparing track
records by geographic sections — j
that is, by countries and parts of !
the United States. He made interest
ing observations.
American track victories in the
Los Angeles Olympics stopped after j
the 400-meter event. England, Italy,
Finland, Poland, and the Argentine \
sent distance men to take the 800- 1
meter and longer races. Past Olym- j
pics have been practically the same. 1
Tracksters Superior
What was true of America in the ,
Olympics is true of the West. West- |

rior because of the diminished at
mospheric pressure at 4250 feet and
the accompanying sease of exhiliara
titon.
Base running and other fast plays
(except in spurts) suffered because
the players lost their wind more
quickly. Pitchers were less effec
tive because they could put less
curve and hop on the ball due to the
thin air.
Inherently Good
Back to track, Professor Mears
finds interesting the fact, that ne
groes have broken world's records
in the 110 and 220 and the broad
jump. Is it their inheritance or their
physique or their past and present
environment.
"In our present state of knowl
edge we cannot be dogmatic," said
Dr. Mears. "Nevertheless, certain
regional phenomena are noteworthy

em athletes, while winners in the
100, 200, 400. and 800. fail to do
much in the distance events. In field
events, Westerners are decidedly
superior.
Professor Mears is still looking for
answer to this—why Americans in
general and Westerns in particular
must fail in distance runs. Is it
climate, heredity, and race of the
participants, or diet that makes the
difference? Or do coaching, prac
tice, and distance above sea-level
cause the noteworthy difference in
various sections.
Climate Involved
Climate, he says, makes a lot of
difference. In baseball, for instance,
while Salt Lake City was still in
the Coast League, tho rival players
commented that they played their
best game there. Baiting was supe

and constitute raw material for val- !
liable research. Right now the var- |
ious fields of investigation are so j
specialized that satisfactory co-ordi
nated results will be postponed for
at least a decade."
