# February Chappie Contains Rushing, Jazz Analyses
## 
### 
Fraternities and sororities are I
discussed at length in the i
issue of the Chaparral, out Thurs- >
day. "Tlie Girl Who Knows" de- '
scribes what happens at rushing
teas, and the girl is Ruth Goodan.
Phingernail Phrolic makes its ex- :
it bow in this issue, and Gilman Gist,
Dick Dawson, Rollin Pickford, Dor- 1
man H. Smith, and Curtis Barnes j
are the contributing cartoon artists.
An analysis of jazz by Pete Knecht '
and Curtis Prendergast, and Echoes
from Woodlake are two f ntmed !
contributions.
Chaparral accepted for publica
tion Jack Scott's treatise on a radio I
reception from Little America, and :
Little Pop-off spiels his jargon as i
usual. His topic will be the frazzled
rushing system.
Maxine Smith, collection manager,
announces a meeting of her assist
ants in the Chaparral business o:fice
at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
