Little-known research work which i

i tory, Dr. Victor C. Twitty, profes- 1
sor of biology, told a Stanford Radio |
Hour audience last night.
j "The grotesque monstrosities j
resulting from experimental work j
on animal embroyos are to in- j
struct, not to amuse. They throw j
i light on the causes of monstrosity, ;
; revealing the forces which shape
the destinies of embryonic tis-
I sues, forces whose normal func-
I tion is to transform the primitive
structure of the egg into the com- |
plex image of the parent," he de -
dared.
Scientific fascination, he explain-, i
I ed, has led scientists to fathom the j
secrets of embryonic development.
What he described as one of the
most important embryological dis
coveries in recent years, why liv
ing tissue insists on maintaining
I structural form regardless of
i transplantation to differing parts
of the body, sprang from the lab
j oratory research on the lower ani
; mals.
Experimentation revealed that
I embryo development is controlled
I by a special center, the 'organiser',
i and that beyond a certain stage of
development, tissues take on unal
terable structural form, a change
that is imperceptible, yet actual,
| and occurs in the human embryo
| as well as the x-eptilian and animal."
Women with vulgar and uncouth
j sounding voices are most likely to
j succeed as radio speakers, say two
I Harvard professors.
