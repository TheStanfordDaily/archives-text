# Old Man Weather Blamed for Crash
## 
### 
John S. O'Neill, lower division
student registered from San Fran
cisco, was in Palo Alto Hospital
yesterday, indirectly the victim of
early morning low temperatures.
Because his visibility was impaired
by a fogged windshield, a result of
moisture condensation due to cold,
his car collided with that driven by
Vista Harter, graduate student, as
both were leaving Palo Alto for the
campus.
O'Neill suffered cuts and lacera
tions and possible internal injuries,
while Miss Harter sustained a brok
en collarbone and superficial in
juries of the left arm and leg.
