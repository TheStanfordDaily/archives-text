# Bob Zonne's Skill Awarded with Guard Position
## Indian Hoopsters To Start Trek South For Uclan Battles Bill Quade Only Man Still Left on Sick List 
### 
Bound to regain the Conference
ceiling position they relinquished
Friday night when Cal outscored
them. Indian cagers prepare today
to make their first Irip to the South
land where they will try to take two
tilts from Ucla this week-end.
Change-of- the-week-end was
the shift of Big Boh Zonne to a
regular guard job. Zonne, a for
mer Los Angeles all-city man,
moves up to the varsity as a re- '
sidt of two fine performances Fri
day and Saturday.
He was high-point against the
/Bears, scoring 12 points, one more
than the Bears Let Hank Luisetti
count. He scored as many points
Saturday night, although playing
not half the game. Most of his shots
resulted from hi.s success in the in
evitable struggle for possession of
the bobbing ball around the hoop,
and tipping it in for shots that are
impossible to stop.
The lanky fellow has speed in ad
dition, and is one of the best defen
sive rebound men at this institution.
In the first half against St. Mary's,
he got four rebounds before any of
his teammates had snagged more
than one.
The shift of Zonne to first-string
leaves Dinty Moore, junior cap
t tain, as sixth man, and continues
i the very successful captain jinx
that lias been haunting around for
some time.
Moore, however, is still a varsity
basketball man, and no one sees any
reason why he shouldn't play just
as much as any one else normally
does, for the local basketball-mind
ed do not forget the way Dinty led
his frosh team and the varsity last
year as a soph, thereby bagging
All-Coast placing.
With Zonne and Luisetti ankles
now good as gold, the only ailing
member is Bill Quade, in the hos
pital with a slight cold. The sub
forward will be okeh for the trip
south, however.
