HOW TO CHOOSE
THE CHAMP?
Still a matter for conjecture is
this problem of selecting the Divi
sion 10 basketball representative for
the Olympics. Just in case you're
not posted on the situation and
manner of elimination for the
Games, here's how it's handled.
Ten divisions have been laid out
geographically throughout the en
tire country, each of the districts
to select its own representative.
That team will meet ihc division
champ near it in an interdistrict
elimination game. Thus five outfits
will remain undefeated in the United
States. This interdistrict game rul
ing was just passed by the Olympic
basketball committee at a meeting
held last Sunday.
The five district champs will meet
in the Olympic Games Tourney at
Madison Square Garden next April
to decide the U.S. entrant at Berlin.
Stanford belongs to Division 10
which includes the states of Cali
fornia, Arizona, and Nevada. And
here is where the dispute comes.
How shall Division 10 eliminate?
Coach John Bunn has been quoted
as favoring a system by which the
Southern Conference champ would
automatically become district champ
and the play-oif between Northern
and Southern Conferences would
automatically be the interdistrict
wlay-ofT. This would eliminate the
of an extra long session
of post conference games.
PRICE WOULD
FAVOR TOURNEY
Coach Nibs Price, on the other
hand, holds out for an elimination
tournament to be entered by all
teams, conference and independent,
to select the district representative.
Though no agreement has been
reached either way as yet, it ap
pears that under either system
Stanford will do well. The big

hurdle for any team that wins out
in Division 10 will he Washington,
whose performances indicate that
she will undoubtedly represent
! District 9.
Though it's still just a speck in :
the distance, that championship
play-off in the Garden is in the
realm of possibility this year, espe
cially if the Stanford quintet, not at
best in a conference game yet, begins
to show its real mettle. 窶認rost

Madison Square Garden next April
to decide the U.S. entrant at Berlin.
Stanford belongs to Division 10
which includes the states of Cali
fornia, Arizona, and Nevada. And
here is where the dispute comes.
How shall Division 10 eliminate?
Coach John Bunn has been quoted
as favoring a system by which the
Southern Conference champ would
automatically become district champ
and the play-oif between Northern
and Southern Conferences would
automatically be the interdistrict
wlay-ofT. This would eliminate the
of an extra long session
of post conference games.
PRICE WOULD
FAVOR TOURNEY
Coach Nibs Price, on the other
hand, holds out for an elimination
tournament to be entered by all
teams, conference and independent,
to select the district representative.
Though no agreement has been
reached either way as yet, it ap
pears that under either system
Stanford will do well. The big

hurdle for any team that wins out
in Division 10 will he Washington,
whose performances indicate that
she will undoubtedly represent
! District 9.
Though it's still just a speck in :
the distance, that championship
play-off in the Garden is in the
realm of possibility this year, espe
cially if the Stanford quintet, not at
best in a conference game yet, begins
to show its real mettle. 窶認rost
