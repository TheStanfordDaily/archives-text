## San Jose Will Escape Penalty No New Action Planned Against State: Hinsey 
### 
A literal and figurative "last word" j
j from Professor Joseph C. Hinsey, j
Stanford's representative to the Pa
cific Coast Conference, promised no
| further conference action against
San Jose State.
His statement is in direct contra- ;
diction to reports of a projected mail !
poll preparatory to further penaliza- :
' tion of the state institution for in
| fraction of conference rules.
No Mail Vote
"No mail vote has been taken nor
! is contemplated regarding San Jose's i
j participation in the Fresno relays I
i or the Pacific Association meet," Dr.
| Hinsey said.
i All events scheduled between San
j Jose and Conference members be
i fore December 10, the date the con- }
ference met, will be played, he re- |
| vealed. All events scheduled after
the conference meeting must be can- j
! celled. California, scheduled for a j
baseball game and a wrestling match .
j with State before December 10, will '
I therefore participate.
Conference Members Ineligible
No conference member can con- !
tract for new competition with State ;
i unless that institution either joins an
j approved conference or abides by j
! Pacific Coast Conference rules.
I Association penalties were in
voked as a result of San Jose's con
cessions to football men in violation i
of conference rules.
