# Merriam Asks People To Stop State Expenses
## Governor Says He Can't Act without Public Help 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 3 The
stop order on California's steadily
increasing state government ex
penses, which will hit an all-time
record of $430,721,165 in the 1935-37
biennium, must be an ultimatum
from the people, Governor Merriam
said today.
Opening a citizens' confcrencc of
some 200 delegates from 05) or
ganizations called together to
study California's problems, the
governor said there can be no
"genuine and lasting reductions in
state, county, or municipal gov
ernment until public opinion sup
ports such action."
"By far the greater part of all gov
ernmental expenditures in Califor
nia have had the direct or indirect
approval of (he people themselves
and, hence, any change in the great
volume of expenditures must be de
manded by popular action," he as
serted.
"It has been niy own experi
ence that minorities in the popula
tion will succeed in obtaining spe
cific grants or services from public
agencies and that any attempt
thereafter to eliminate or curtail
these special outlays will be met
by tenacious opposition."
The governor, while offering sev
eral subjects for study as possible
solutions of the problem, made one
definite recommendationâ€”re-enact
ment of the 5 per cent limitation
law upon increases in state, county,
and municipal budgets "at the first
opportunity."
