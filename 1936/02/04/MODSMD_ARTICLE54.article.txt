# Fencers Lose To Olympic Club 7-2
## 
### 
The perennial thorn in the side of
Stanford varsity fencing teams
struck again last Friday night when
Coach Elwyn Bugge's foilsmen lost
to the Olympic Club's experienced
trio 2-7, in the final round of San
Francisco Division, A.F.L.A. Team
Foils event.
Louis Lataillade won the two
matches against the Olympic Club,
while his team-mates, Dick Fergu
son and Edwin Woods, won three
and two, respectively, in the 7-2
victory over the University of Cali
fornia. John Reichmuth, J. W.
Briggs, Langan Swent, and Woods
all entered the Novice Individual
Foils event.

Eddie Twiggs, Stanford golf coach, j
announces the introduction of a new '
system of ranking varsity and fresh- 1
man golfers. He is doing away with
the old match play and is going to j
adopt the Big Ten system to develop 1
the Indians' medal play.
The plan is to require every team ;
member to play 18 holes each week J
that are to be averaged in with his
score for the preceding week's play j
—and so on each week so that the I
golfer with lowest average will be j
number one man.
"This average system will do
away with the unfairness of a man's !
golfing ability being based on one |
round at (he beginning of the quar- I
ter," Twiggs asserted, "and so far I
have had no squawks, and I think
we'll get somewhere."
The varsity will be based on the |
14 best averages, and Lhe six lowest i
frosh averages will make up their ■
team. Those who will earn their let
ters and numerals will have to com
pete in the California-Stanford |
matches to be played off the first of |
the spring quarter.
