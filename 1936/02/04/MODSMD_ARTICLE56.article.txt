around workout yesterday. Coach |
"Rabbit" Bradshaw stressed scoring !
plays in an effort to develop a bet- ;
ter attack for the California game.
Weaving the ball back and forth, !
the yearlings fed Phil Zonne un
der the basket most of the time.
Chuck Fisher and Bob Brooke \
took active parts in the session as !
forwards, indicating that Bradshaw
may use them early to relieve Jack i
Kessel and "Lymie" Calkins Thurs
day. Wally deWitt has seen consid- j
erable service recently at guard, but ;
Dick Neeley and Pete, McArthur are !
still the regular back-court men.
With a far better team than last
year, the California frosh have
been improving all season, and
should be at their peak for the
Papooses. An easy 45-27 con
quest of San Francisco's Mission
High School a week ago was the
high-water mark for the Cub
quintet, which includes three men
well over 0 feet tall.
