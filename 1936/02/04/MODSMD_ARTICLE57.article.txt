# Reisner Out of Rugby Practice
## 
### 
Stanford ruggers are preparing for
Saturday's game with U.S.C. minus
the services of Co-captain Johnny
Reisner, who sustained a torn clav
icle during the Olympic Club tus
sle last week-end.
The other captain, Joe Vigna, was
back in the scrimmage last night in
spite of a jar he received during the
game Saturday. Reisner, according
to physician's reports will be off the
playing field for at least two weeks.
His absence leaves the varsity
without one of its fleetest backs for
the Trojan game in the Stanford Sta
dium.
