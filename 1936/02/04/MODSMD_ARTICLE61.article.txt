# Quarter Miler Pleases Dink
## 
### 
With San Francisco's first indoor j
track and field championships, and |
the opening of Stanford's season, I
less than ten days away. Coach Dink
Templeton is watching with pleasure
the running of Jack Weiershauser,
Modesto Junior College transfer,
who will compete in the 300-yard
dash in the city meet.
Weiershauser, now working off a
dozen extra pounds, is expected by
Dink to be a leading quarter miler
this season. He will compete with i
Jimmy Luvalle, national collegiate 1
440 titlist in the meet February 12. J
Not so pleasing, however, is the
prospect that Truck Dellinger, an- I
other ace 440 man, will miss the in- ]
door meet and will be out of compe- j
tition for a month or more. Truck, j
who has a pulled muscle, will be un
able to train for at least three weeks,
according to Dink. That means he
will have a long, hard pull before he
is back in shape for running.

Masauki Hara put on a one-man
show last night in scoring 30 points
in the Japanese Club victory over
El Capitan. The Nipponese seemed
to score at will, and set an individ
ual scoring mark that should stand
some time. El Toro I ; nd Kappa Sig
also looked like league-leading ma
terial, while Theta Xi and the Med
School played a brand of ball that
should predict future victories.

With San Francisco's first indoor j
track and field championships, and |
the opening of Stanford's season, I
less than ten days away. Coach Dink
Templeton is watching with pleasure
the running of Jack Weiershauser,
Modesto Junior College transfer,
who will compete in the 300-yard
dash in the city meet.
Weiershauser, now working off a
dozen extra pounds, is expected by
Dink to be a leading quarter miler
this season. He will compete with i
Jimmy Luvalle, national collegiate 1
440 titlist in the meet February 12. J
Not so pleasing, however, is the
prospect that Truck Dellinger, an- I
other ace 440 man, will miss the in- ]
door meet and will be out of compe- j
tition for a month or more. Truck, j
who has a pulled muscle, will be un
able to train for at least three weeks,
according to Dink. That means he
will have a long, hard pull before he
is back in shape for running.

Masauki Hara put on a one-man
show last night in scoring 30 points
in the Japanese Club victory over
El Capitan. The Nipponese seemed
to score at will, and set an individ
ual scoring mark that should stand
some time. El Toro I ; nd Kappa Sig
also looked like league-leading ma
terial, while Theta Xi and the Med
School played a brand of ball that
should predict future victories.
