Out of ii snarl of red tape and inactivity by
the Committee on Public Exercises comes the
word that the student theater group has fi
nally taken the responsibility for a dedication
program for the Memorial Hall and will confer
with President Wilbur today.
When the Public Exercises Committee put
ils linger in the pie, a couple of months ago,
it was with the realization that any action
taken by it must first be recommended by
the University President. Through the process
of forgetting, the committee didn't bother to
ask Dr. Wilbur for his sanction, and conse
quently the dedication plans have been hang
ing lire, with the student group waiting on the
Public Exercises group.
In final desperation the chairman of the
student committee inquired of the Public Ex
ercises Committee what they were doing and
flic answer was that the group which had
asked to be "cut in" on the plans was awaiting
the oflicial word to proceed, and as that word
had never been asked for, they weren't doing
anything.
So without further ado said chairman ar
ranged for a meeting of the theater committee
with President Wilbur, and inavhaps the
Memorial Hall will have an impressive dedi
cation in Ihe near future.
