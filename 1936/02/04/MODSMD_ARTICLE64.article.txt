# Bookstore Interest Dormant As Opinion Poll Draws Nigh
## 
### 
Although students have mumbled about the
Bookstore for years, they have proved rather
uninterested as concerns the opinion poll on
the distribution of Bookstore profits set for
next Tuesday.
The preferential vole of course is not de
signed to be binding as the Bookstore is in no
sense an A.S.S.IJ. venture. Bookstore direc
tors have merely asked for student opinion on
the matter by which to be guided, and this
they will gel from the poll.
Suggestions as to disposition of profits from
the students have been few and far between,
especially considering that the question was
opened a month ago.
The underlying point which has raised the
discussion is that Bookstore directors feel
the rebate system unnecessarily costly and
troublesome for the small profits which the
Bookstore produces. They fell that the profits
as a lump sum might be put to belter use than
to dribble il back to customers—not all stu
dents —in small rebates.
This next week will be the prime chance
for students to air their grievances and pro
posals as concerns the Bookstore' while the
subject is before them. After the election,
complaints that not enough time was given,
or insullicient plans presented, will be singu
larly out of place.
