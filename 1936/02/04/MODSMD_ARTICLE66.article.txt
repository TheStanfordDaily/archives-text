## IRONIC SYMBOLS OF THE PAST 
### 
Under three clustered dull-gilt spheres . . . under
that sign of last resort and despair which reads . . .
"Money To Loan" ... in many a south-of-Market
pawn shop . . . rest dozens of once expensive . . .
heavily jeweled fraternity pins.
* * * *
They're not worth much any more, these gold and
pearl symbols of a glory that was college. "Not much
call for 'em," the dry little pawn broker will tell you.
But they were costly once—twenty, thirty, forty dol
lars apiece. Now they lie among the second hand
banjos and electric toasters for sale to anyone with
a few dollars to spend. What a disheartening story!
Ecstatic prom nights . . . fervent hands fastening
them to white satin beneath gardenias . . . dirty show
windows on Third Street.
* * * *
How came they there? Useless toys converted into
whatever cash they could bring? No. Fraternity men
don't discard their,badges for such a reason. The pawn
tickets for those pins are held by men whose diplo
mas mocked them as they pleaded for jobs in those
years just passed when opportunity grew ill and
nearly died. A few, of course, are held by embittered
flunked-outs and tossed-outs from this college and
that.
* * * *
We say these abandoned badges are ironic symbols
of the past, as if we were looking back at a period
of despair which has ended—as if we were smug in our
belief that college training is again synonomous with
ability to earn money. But we can't be sure. What
is there about the social order of this year that is
different from that of 1930? The main difference to
some is a new kind of hope for the future.
* * * *
For this year is election year. And as much as we
may hate to place prime emphasis on politics and gov
ernment, after what has happened under NRA, AAA,
and F.D.R., we can't deny the importance of the
governing fathers. And we can't be greatly concerned
with who gets elected next November, but there is hope
—always hope as in 1932—that whoever wins will
have the good fortune to strike the right chords in
business, industry, and taxation which will lead to a
great deal of what is included in the all-inclusive
word "prosperity."
♦ • • •
1936, the year of great hope for the college boys!
Hope that public office big-wigs won't scare business
men out of their ability to say "you're hired" to
freshly educated applicants.
In the interests of self preservation, however, those
of us who have potentially hockable fraternity pins
should be thankful.

Under three clustered dull-gilt spheres . . . under
that sign of last resort and despair which reads . . .
"Money To Loan" ... in many a south-of-Market
pawn shop . . . rest dozens of once expensive . . .
heavily jeweled fraternity pins.
* * * *
They're not worth much any more, these gold and
pearl symbols of a glory that was college. "Not much
call for 'em," the dry little pawn broker will tell you.
But they were costly once—twenty, thirty, forty dol
lars apiece. Now they lie among the second hand
banjos and electric toasters for sale to anyone with
a few dollars to spend. What a disheartening story!
Ecstatic prom nights . . . fervent hands fastening
them to white satin beneath gardenias . . . dirty show
windows on Third Street.
* * * *
How came they there? Useless toys converted into
whatever cash they could bring? No. Fraternity men
don't discard their,badges for such a reason. The pawn
tickets for those pins are held by men whose diplo
mas mocked them as they pleaded for jobs in those
years just passed when opportunity grew ill and
nearly died. A few, of course, are held by embittered
flunked-outs and tossed-outs from this college and
that.
* * * *
We say these abandoned badges are ironic symbols
of the past, as if we were looking back at a period
of despair which has ended—as if we were smug in our
belief that college training is again synonomous with
ability to earn money. But we can't be sure. What
is there about the social order of this year that is
different from that of 1930? The main difference to
some is a new kind of hope for the future.
* * * *
For this year is election year. And as much as we
may hate to place prime emphasis on politics and gov
ernment, after what has happened under NRA, AAA,
and F.D.R., we can't deny the importance of the
governing fathers. And we can't be greatly concerned
with who gets elected next November, but there is hope
—always hope as in 1932—that whoever wins will
have the good fortune to strike the right chords in
business, industry, and taxation which will lead to a
great deal of what is included in the all-inclusive
word "prosperity."
♦ • • •
1936, the year of great hope for the college boys!
Hope that public office big-wigs won't scare business
men out of their ability to say "you're hired" to
freshly educated applicants.
In the interests of self preservation, however, those
of us who have potentially hockable fraternity pins
should be thankful.
