# "Poor Stanford"
## 
### 
In the editorial columns of yesterday's Daily
California!) the following comment appeared.
We quote in full:
"Poor Stanford. The Varsity really should
n't have treated them so rough. Everybody
knows that Stanford was supposed to have
the greatest, the most marvelous, the most
wonderful quintet that ever stepped on to a
hardwood lloor.
"But miracles do seem to happen and so
California has beaten Stanford by a score of
U9 to 35. It looks like another tough winter f
down 011 the Farm."
So they pity its.
