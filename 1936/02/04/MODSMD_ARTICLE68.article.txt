# Farm's Interests Elsewhere As TVA Decision Expected
## 
### 
As llie Supreme Court entered the second
half of its term yesterday, New Deal backers
looked for the long-awaited decision on the
TVA's right to compete with private utilities
in the sale of surplus power.

Proving I heir evident apathy to natjonal
all'airs, :i good majority of Stanford men will
ask: "What is the TV A?" Including the ter
ritory known as Muscle Shoals, it happens to
he one of the New Deal's power programs
known as the Tennessee Yallev Authority.

The high court's ruling in this ease may
have potential far-reaching consequences to
both the power industry and consumers. Its
reverberations also may inlluence the drive
for a limitation of the Court's powers, in
which case student apathy may be shaken to
the point of arousing an active interest in the
nation.
