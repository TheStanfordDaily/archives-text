A customer called up the Concert Series office
the other day. Called she: "Could you get me two tick
ets for Tito Schipa and his Comic Ballet?" The
serious Series people felt that she might just as well
have asked for Tiny Thornhill and his string ensemble.
I have a sequel to the story about one of the
heroines who has been taking up space in my column
lately. It seems that she was flunking a course. So
she appeared before her professor and appealed to his
better nature. The appeal was such that his nature
was better. Said he: "Well, you look so innocent,
I guess I'll pass you." He did.
The profs have yet to reward me for my complete
innocence on examination papers. The only time profs
ever pass me is when they are late to their 8 o'clocks.
There is a large sort of a football player who does
a bit of sponging in Encina. The privy council was
meeting one Monday night to decide what to do about
a frosh caught making noise one morning. The large
sort of sponsor was the complaining witness. He was
asked to brief the case. Said the sponsor, "I heard a
big racket downstairs about 2:30 the other morning.
I waited for ten minutes for it to quiet down or for
some other sponsor to quell it, but nothing happened
so I got out of my warm bed and chased down."
"What did you do when you got there?" his col
leagues gasped.
"I reprimanded them," said the large sort of foot
ball player.

One of the major excuses of the year Is one offered
by a local youth to Men's Council. He explained that
he didn't know he was exceeding the speed limit, be
cause his speedometer was in kilometers instead of
miles. "Diez pesos," said Men's Council.

Nobody seems to care any more about rushing scan
dals. Everybody will let status quo reign supreme.
Then next year during rushing everybody will lie in
wait and see if they can't catch the Sigma Chis and
laugh and laugh.
