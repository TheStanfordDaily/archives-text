# WHEN AMATEURS ARE PROS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Again you raise the question of j
amateurism vs. professionalism in :
athletics at Stanford; again I raise ;
the cry to you that you cease quib
bling over technical definitions and .
pursue a course of justice. Tech- j
nically speaking, I am forced to ad- !
mit that subsidizing athletes can be
construed as professionalizing them.
But there is a bigger question. Sub
sidy is not the cause of the disease;
it is merely an eruption.
In spite of our being at swords
points on this question of subsidy, I
think our ideals concerning the uni
versity are in harmony. I think that
we would agree that it is a place
primarily interested in enlighten
ment.
Now an ogre, "college football,"
has slipped into this hypothetical

â–  colony of thinkers. Today it is a 1
I spectacle in the lives of millions of
j Americans which rivals the gladi- i
torial combats of ancient Rome. We (
build stadiums, some of which hold i
over 100,000 onlookers and the gate 1
I x-eceipts for a single game will fre- !
I quently exceed a quarter of a mil- j
I lion dollars. The method of starting ]
a new college is to build a football J
| stadium and ticket office; then if any
money remains, administration and 1
; other buildings follow.
Sir, under such a system, I ask j
' you why is it necessary to insist
upon such purity with regard to the
financial arrangements which make
i it possible for a good athlete to stay
i in school. Why make the individual j
i athlete the goat?
Still looking for a champion of
' j justice,
1 I Boyd White
