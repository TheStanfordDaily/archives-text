APROPOS of the Eisenbach-Su
san controversy is the "Margery
Wilson Charm Test," a copy of
| which Miss Sue sent Mr. Eis. De
| 'signed to give the feminine miss a
rating on her own charm (and, in
' cidentally, an inferiority complex
i which of course can only he cor
-1 rected by Miss Wilson's ten easy
lessons, sent in sealed, unidentified
| envelopes), the lest contains 32 re-
I vealing questions.
"Are you contented with your so
j cial life?" asks Miss Wilson. "Do
! men like you as much as you want
! them to? Are you invited to the
| small exclusive parties as well as
; the large ones that include every
body? Is your voice vibrant with
I charm? Do you know how to make
I men chivalrously attentive to you?
! Do you know how to regain lost af
! fection?"
Perhaps the prize question of the
lot is: "When you drop something,
do you wait before stooping to re
i trieve it in order to give the nearest
man a chance to be polite?" If that
1 isn't just like a woman!
Personally, we think it would be a
I swell idea if the University made
| Margery Wilson a full professor
J with a generous salary. Wouldn't a
| "Stanford Department of Charm" he
| a swell idea?

APROPOS of the Eisenbach-Su
san controversy is the "Margery
Wilson Charm Test," a copy of
| which Miss Sue sent Mr. Eis. De
| 'signed to give the feminine miss a
rating on her own charm (and, in
' cidentally, an inferiority complex
i which of course can only he cor
-1 rected by Miss Wilson's ten easy
lessons, sent in sealed, unidentified
| envelopes), the lest contains 32 re-
I vealing questions.
"Are you contented with your so
j cial life?" asks Miss Wilson. "Do
! men like you as much as you want
! them to? Are you invited to the
| small exclusive parties as well as
; the large ones that include every
body? Is your voice vibrant with
I charm? Do you know how to make
I men chivalrously attentive to you?
! Do you know how to regain lost af
! fection?"
Perhaps the prize question of the
lot is: "When you drop something,
do you wait before stooping to re
i trieve it in order to give the nearest
man a chance to be polite?" If that
1 isn't just like a woman!
Personally, we think it would be a
I swell idea if the University made
| Margery Wilson a full professor
J with a generous salary. Wouldn't a
| "Stanford Department of Charm" he
| a swell idea?
