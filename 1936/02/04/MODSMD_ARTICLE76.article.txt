## THE 						LONDON THEATER 
### 
The London theatrical season is at ]
its height; examples of England's i
! finest artists cover the bills and j
boards. Noel Coward has six new j
i one-act plays at the Phoenix, Ivor
, Novello a comedy at the Haymarket, 1
i and St. John Ervine a new comedy I
at Whitehall.
The London press, critics includ- j
! ed, jumped hard on Noel Coward's j
! new efforts.
"Family Album," a comedy of I
; manners to music, is the first of the |
plays offered. Set in the drawing
room of a country house in Kent, j
| the year 1860, the play runs a rip- j
pling satire on Victorian mourning 1
j for the dead. In this instance it is
! "dear papa" who "will never see a
| squirrel again." Songs by Coward
: and Gertrude Lawrence, syncho
! nized movements, and brilliant dia
! log make an otherwise dreary set
j ting sparkling fare. Modern satire
in a setting of Victorian humility
strikes a rare and sustained note,
i "The Astonished Heart," a play in
I six scenes, returns to London, May
| fair, and the eternal triangle. Con
centrated action, brilliant acting, and
| a fast tempo carries the second play
to its tragic close. This is Coward's
favorite play of all six and displays
a sincere effort to reach emotionally
j intellectual heights.
Christian Faber, a happily mar
ried psychiatrist, goes down to his
j self-appointed death by reason of
[ his own intellectual curiosityâ€”dis
! played in probing the past of his
! mistress. Reason fails him and his
I tortured mind fails to rise above a
| jealousy he knows to be entirely
j irrelevant to the present.
