# U.S. Hit by Arctic Blasts; Rivers Rise
## Snow-Swollen Streams Cause Menacing Floods In Alabama, Mississippi 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 4 (IP). â€” The
Arctic lashed a double blast of zero
chill across the nation today as flood
waters swirled over the banks of
snow-swollen streams in North Ala
bama and East Mississippi.
A 40-mile wind brought suf
fering and destruction over the
Great Lakes region, and another
stream of frigid weather poured
down the Rocky Mountains and
eastward.
Whirling a 25 to 40 degree tem
perature drop before it, this raw
combine of winter piled up snow
drifts that blocked highways and
railroads in the West, 'and coated
roads with ice fro mthe Rockies to
the Atlantic.
The new cold wave, the weather
man said, would extend from the
western mountains eastward, except
for Florida, by tomorrow, and would
last "indefinitely."
It brought new threats to an al
ready acute coal shortage in a half
dozen states, but the breeze which
pulled temperatures as low as 8
degrees at Amarillo, Tex., was ex
pected to choke Alabama and
Mississippi streams, swollen by
heavy rains, by tomorrow.
Near Maylene, Ala., a Southern
Railway freight train plunged down
an embankment, trapping two train
men under the locomotive. At Ashe
ville, N.C., a woman and her son
were drowned when a dam broke
under the stream of flood waters.
Streams throughout that region were
rapidly nearing flood stages. Storm
warnings were posted along the
North Gulf Coast from Brownsville,
Texas, to Carrabelle, Fla.
The cold brought suffering to
scores made homeless by the rising
waters, which reached a depth of
four feet in some places. Highways
wei'e washed out and trains were de
layed.
