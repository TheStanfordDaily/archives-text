# Checks Cashed for 17 Yearsâ€”One Bounces

### Johnson Hill 
There are all kinds of barbers, .
j from Singapore to San Jose; some
| of them will talk to you whether you
! like it or not, some of them will talk
j to you if you'll talk back, and oth
| ers won't talk at all. Those of the
old school are philosophers, too.
Stanford has one such philoso
phising barber. He is Jim Pen
ington, known to two generations
of Roughs as Jim, the Barber,
who holds forth with three ton- |
sorial assistants in his Union
j Sanctuary.
| "I came to Stanford in 1918," Jim j
j said yesterday, "and set up my
I equipment in a space now taken over
i by the Cellar lounge. The Farm was
' a lot different then. There weren't !
! very many automobiles, but the men
| had a lot of fun with their soph
frosh battles, parties, and the like.
The Old Union building was just
being completed then."
In 1919 Jim took over the room
he now occupies, which was for
merly Herbert Hoover's ofTiec. He
owns all the fixtures and supplies
in the shop, and maintains the
, business himself.

Jim's almost as well known for his !
check cashing policy as he is for his \
hair trimming and shaving. He'll j
cash personal cheeks of any size, for i
the one-cent charge imposed by
banks for clearance. Asked if he |
didn't have great faith in Farm man- I
kind, he said:
"I suppose so. A long time ago
I decided to give the fellows a
chance to cash their checks with
out having to run down town. It
makes a lot of friends for me, and
brings a little additional business
into the shop. In the 17 years I've
been doing this, only once have I
failed to get my money back.
That, incidentally, was because
the fellow committed suicide."
Graduation breaks school ties for
most people, but not so for Jim's
friends. Every now and then he gets
letters from former Stanford men.
now living in far corners of the
world.
And so, day after day, Jim Pen
ington, Jim the Barber, pal of the
Stanford Rough, cuts hair and listens
to troubles and cashes checks.
