# Trustees' Plea Sent to Court
## University Would Invest Funds in Stock 
### 
To stave off a financial crisis im- |
periling the University, representa- j
tives of the Board of Trustees will J
today present a plea in San Jose 1
Superior Courts to permit invest- i
ment of Stanford's funds in com
mon stock.
Decrease of interest rates on Uni- j
versity holdings from 5Vz to 6 per j
cent to 31/2 and 4 per cent, with a 1
proportionate decrease in income se
riously imperiling Stanford's exist
ence, was the reason for the action j
given yesterday by Comptroller Al- i
mon E. Roth.
Investment in common stocks, he j
said, is also a way of combating in- j
flation, now a serious threat to Uni- j
versity income.
The plea asks that the Board of 1
Trustees be empowered to invest
Stanford funds in debentures and |
shares of stock in well managed cor- j
porations which enjoy a reputation
for stability and permanence.
In 1907, the trustees pled similarly ,
for the right to invest in real estate j
loans.
