# California Professor Tells of Constitution
## 
### 
Cursed and misconstrued today, as
was "socialism" 40 years ago, is the
word "unconstitutionality," ex
plained Professor Max Radin of the
University of California, who spoke
on that topic in the Assembly Hall
last night.
A bogey word, it has come into
use as a term of general condem
nation rather than as a descrip
tion of an actual violation of the
articles of the constitution. Us
ing the example of the migratory
bird laws, Dr. Radin illustrated
how it is possible to incorporate
into legal matter acts, which,
though desirable, may be re
stricted by constitutional provi
sions.
In spite of its present stand for
constitutionality, the Republican
party in the past has been respon
sible for more legislation subse
; qucntly ruled "unconstitutional"
I than the Democratic party.
! Had it been called by the more
lumberous title of "The Instru
ment of Rights" or "The Articles of
j Federation," Dr. Radin remarked,
I our constitution might not have been
j so rigorously defended by word
j bandiers.
If the fathers of the constitution
had realized that their document
I would be preserved so faithfully,
I)r. Radin surmised, they might
| have conceivably placed a time
limit 011 its legality. Next import
ant in its content to the Bill of
Rights, Dr. Radin believes, is Ar
ticle 5, providing for the docu
. ments amendment.
"Our constitution is not definite
| enough," Dr. Radin pointed out, "to
j tell us what wc may or may not do."
