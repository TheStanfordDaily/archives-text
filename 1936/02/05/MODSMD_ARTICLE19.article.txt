# Few Names Filed for 11 Student Posts
## Nomination Polls To Be Open Until 6:00 Today 
### 
Candidates for four of the eleven I
positions to be filled at next Tues
day's student election were nomin- ,

ated yesterday with a general lack
of interest in the ballot indicated.
Nominations will continue today
from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.. according
to Jim Ludlam, election board chair
man.
Chief competition apparently
will be for the office of junior man
on Ex Committee. Four men were
named during the opening day.
They are Jack Craven, Mort D'-
Evelyn, Chick Franich, and George
Lindahl.
For B.A.C. representative, Frank
Alustiza and Bones Hamilton have
been nominated. Only three wo
men were given I'ecommendations:
two, Maxine Moore and Barbara
Paine for sophomore representative
on Ex Committee, and one, Kather
ine Kennedy for member of Wo
men's Council. Miss Kennedy,
however, is ineligible because of
insufficient grade-points.
No choices were filed for two
Men's Council posts, graduate mem
ber of Ex Committee and the second
Women's Council vacancy. Yiell
leader and assistant yell leader can
didates already have been selected.
Ludlam said last night there was
no precedent for failure to nomi
nate anyone for an olTiee and that
in the event no one is named for
the designated places today, a new
ruling probably would be neces
sary.
Candidates will give one-minute
acceptance speeches at a meeting in
the Little Theater at 7:30 o'clock
tomorrow.
For the first time, students will
be allowed to question candidates
from the floor, with a limit of three
questions for each nominee. Ludlam
says the system is being inaugura
ted as a means of "getting under
the 'floss' built up in acceptance
speeches." He urges a large turn
out for the session.
