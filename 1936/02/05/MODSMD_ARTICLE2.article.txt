# Minute Interviews
## 
### 
Question for today's interview
was: Should Ex Committee member
ship be by representation from or
p ganizations, or from classes as in
the present system?
Betty McGlashen, Gamma Phi:
I thing representation from organ
izations would be an improvement.
It would make for more capable
student leaders on the Ex Commit
tee.
Dewey Donncll, Phi Psi: The pre
present system of representation is
much better. If members were elec
ted from organizations, there would
be too much competition for the
offices and we'would lose the present
democratic system.
Whitney Aldricli, Alpha Delt: I
think everything is fine now. What
do they want to change for?
Barbara Cluff, Union: I haven't
thought much about it, but it seems
to me that the present system is
much fairer and therefore more de
sirable.
Wayne Haley, Encina: Represen
tation by organizations would tend
to create too much rivalry. The
democratic spirit which now pre
vails would no longer exist.
