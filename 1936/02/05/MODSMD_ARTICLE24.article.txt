# Delay Dedication Of New Theater
## 
### 
Indefinite postponement of the I
theater cornerstone laying was an- j
nounced yesterday by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur. A change in
plans for construction makes it nec- i
essary to finish all the steel work j
before the stone can be put in, mak- '
ing the probable date late spring
quarter.
George Wagner, builder, orig
inally planned to pour the concrete !
superstructure before the steel sup- j
port was put in. This would have
made the ceremony take place
some time this month.
This student body definitely
should see some sort of cere- |
mony, said Wilbur, as the present ,
senior class included most of the
leaders in recent plans for the
theater. Even if construction falls j
behind schedule, sonic sort of j
program will be presented.
The Public Exercises Committee,
headed by Chairman James Swain, !
will supervise plans for the cere
mony. Assisting them will be the
Theater Committee of five students •
Only plans announced so far are
that President of the Board of Trus
tees Leland Cutler will probably lie
principal speaker of the day. The
main speech will stress the memorial
nature of the building, describing
the contributions of Stanford's
World War heroes.
