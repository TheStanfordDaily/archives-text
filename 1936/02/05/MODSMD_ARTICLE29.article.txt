# Seven Workmen Die in Construction Camp Blaze
## Investigators Believe Fire Incendiary Vengeance Threatened By Intoxicated Man According to Witnesses 
### 
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 4 (/P).
â€”Investigators uncovered evidence
today indicating the dormitory fire
at the Parker Dam Construction
camp where at least seven work
men perished, may have been of
incendiary origin.
A threat of vengeance was made
three weeks ago by a man who was
rejected for work when he appeared
in an intxociated condition, it was
reported by Norman P. Henderson,
San Bernardino district attorney's
investigator.
Camp attendants told Henderson
they saw tins man leave the dam site
early yesterday, shortly after fire
broke out in the dormitory.
Officials of the Six Companies,
contractors for the Colorado River
project, said the dormitory's flooded
basement may contain additional
fatalities. Repairs were rushed on
a pump which would clear the base
ment of water today.
Of the 140 men housed in the
wooden structure when it was razed
by flames, 21 were missing. Some
may have left the scene after the
blaze without notifying camp head
quarters.
Four men, who were critically
burned, were near death at camp
hospitals today.
Henderson said preliminary in
vestigators showed the fire appar
ently started in the linen storage
room, directly above an automatic
furnace which heated the dormitory.
Two possible causes may have
been spontaneous combustion and a
defect in the heating system.
