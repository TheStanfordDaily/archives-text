# Rare Relics Gathered For Museum's 'Egypt'
## 
### Allen Drury 
A child centuries old sleeps in
the Stanford Museum. Shrivelled,j
its skin blackcncd by the hands of
time, it died in Egypt when the,
Pharaohs ruled, perhaps when
Cleopatra tricked Mark Antony and
all of Rome, and today it lies silent,
its lips sealed, in the Egyptian
Room of the Stanford Museum.
The burning desert land of the
pyramids, the Sphinx, and Cleo
patra is summed up in the inter- I
esting collection of relics which f
has been gathered slowly and
carefully by museum officials.
Many of the exhibits are them- \
selves as enigmatic as the
itself.
Chief object of interest is the or
nately carved casket which occupies
a prominent place in the room. It is
made of wood, and the lid repre
sents the mummy who lies within it, j
as he or she must have looked in
actual life. It is brightly painted,
and covered with many designs, the j
significance of which has long since
been forgotten. The man for whom
this casket was designed lived some
600 years before Christ.
Commanding one end of the
room is the seated figure of one
of the kings of the Twenty-first
Dynasty, decked with all the re
gal paraphernalia of ancient
Egyptâ€”in particular, the bizarre
head-dress which is so typical of
Egyptian paintings and sculpture.
So delicate is the carving of his j

face, that he seems almost alive.
Another item is a replica of the
Rosetta Stone, discovered in Egypt
in the middle of the last century.
The stone bears an inscription in
Greek and a translation of it in
Egyptian, and has provided scholars
with the key to Egyptian hiero
glyphics, opening up many closed
doors in Egypt's political and cul
tural past.
The exhibit is completed by sev
eral cases of smaller relics: jewels,
the ever-present sacred cats, and
the blackened hands of some royal
prince or other. All the mystery of
the Sphinx itself is present in these
relics of the Egyptian Room.
