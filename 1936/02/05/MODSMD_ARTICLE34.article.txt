# Senate Repeals Cotton, Potato Control Acts
## Tobacco Control Killed Also on F.R.'s Request 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (IP). —
While the House listened to another
1 demand for impeachment of Sec
' retary Wallace, the Senate today
quickly carried out President Pioose
| velt's request for "prompt repeal"
of the cotton, tobacco, and potato
i control acts.
The measures, passed after
the original AAA act, were closely
tied to the whole farm adjustment
program. Invalidation of AAA was
generally believed to have doomed
them.
Only one minor section of the cot-
J ton act was salvaged. The repeal
! specifically exempted a provision
1 authorizing the Secretary of Agri
culture to use a $500,000 fund to
"develop new and extended uses of
cotton."
Representative Treadway (R.,
Mass.) renewed his floor attack on
Wallace for calling the Supreme
Court's refunding of $180,000,000
in impounded AAA processing
taxes "the greatest legalized steal
in history."
Calling Wallace a "sensational
! notoriety seeker" and "this great
: agricultural failure," Treadway as
, serted in the House:
"I referred last Wednesday to the
| insulting and untruthful remarks
j of Secretary Wallace. I said at that
j time, and I repeat that in my judg
ment any public official who makes
I a statement like that deserves im
peachment."
