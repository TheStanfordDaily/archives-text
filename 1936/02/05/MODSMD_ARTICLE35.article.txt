## CULTURE, MY DEARS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last week's debate on "Resolved,
that the present system of living
spells the doom of culture" was
worthwhile. There culture was de- j
fined as the art of living. The af
firmative pointed out that true cul
ture, aside from its expression in
music, sculpture, etc., was always j
associated with the three funda
mental values: a desire for the Good,
a search for the True, and an ap
preciation of the Beautiful.
Culture, it was pointed out, can j
only flourish in an atmosphere of!
Love, in the deeper meaning of that |
word. Great cultures of the past f
were due to the cultural activities
of a leisure group. Culture cannot
exist without leisure in which to
follow the beacon of the Good, the
True, and the Beautiful.
Now consider the Stanford stu- j
dent. In his pursuit of the material
and intellectual culture of modern
civilization, goaded by required
courses and class averages, or his
own desire for mastery, this stu
dent has little time to devote to ac
quisition of social culture based on '
the above fundamentals.
Social culture embraces our tech- |
nique in friendships, our life phi
losophy, our amusements and lei
sure activities, our means of ex- j
pressing our personalities — all the
things which affect us as individuals i
or members of a social group.
Who can deny that our joy in '
living and our social effectiveness j
30 years from now will depend as j
much upon our relations with other
people and upon our social and lei
sure habits as upon what we get
from studying all night for an ex- 1
animation in C.P. 103?

All right; then what?— Ed.
