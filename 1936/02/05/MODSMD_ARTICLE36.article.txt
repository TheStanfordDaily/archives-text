# A 						FEW CROSS WORDS

The Editor, Sir:
Since the Wake-Me-Up cure for j
lectures has not yet reached this in
stitution, I suggest a repetition of
your stay-awake doctrine. All this
refers to the abolition of cross-word ;
puzzles in The Daily. I used to work
industriously at them in my cold,
cold eight o'clocks, but since you've j
done away with them I have no in
centive to scramble out of bed and
wend my way to class. So I am en
closing one of my own.
While I'm kicking, let me make
another suggestion, how about print
ing radio news daily as you used to
long ago? I depend on The Daily for j
all of my news, and am much too
lazy to pick up another paper to
learn what's best on the air.
