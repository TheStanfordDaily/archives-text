# NO GALLANTRY

The Editor, Sir:
You are the first person who, as it
seems to me, has analyzed Stan
ford's situation. Both the men and
women on the campus ar»_ lacking
in social grace, and I may add to the I

students that if they had a little hu
man sympathy, it would go a long
way toward establishing a friendly
atmosphere. I, too, say: discontinue
the "feud"; the fault does not lie
with the students, but it is charac
teristic of the West, where men are
men and gallantry and charm have
no place.
If some of these men and women
had the opportunity of attending
an eastern or a southern univer
sity, they would soon find that
"gentlemen and ladies" are not un
interesting. To he placed in this
category is not necessarily to he a
"stuffed shirt," and for a girl to
have maidenly charm and to be a
little less independent would im
prove the Stanford woman no
end!
Western girls all lock the femi
ninity that makes southern girls so
desirable, and western men have not
the subtle and pleasing—yet obvious
—"line" that makes a date enter
taining.
Perhaps it is because I was
brought up in the friendly at
mosphere of the Old South, but I
think, as you do, that Stanford
does not welcome and accept
strangers.
