# Frosh Hoopsters Will Face Bear Cubs Tomorrow
## California Quintet Promises Real Test For Yearling Five Improved U.C. Outfit Threatens Papooses Record of Ten Straight One-Sided Wins; Neeley's Weak Ankle Healed by Rest 
### ROGER KIMBALL 
Striving to match Bear Cub improvements and to reach their peak for
the California game tomorrow night, Indian frosli hoopsters engaged in an
other stifi' workout in yesterday's practice. Ihe drill included a half-hour
scrimmage between (he first and second teams.

Jimmy Bradshaw's
looked only fair in the semifinal'
session before their "Little Big |
Game" of the hardwood court. They
have played better bull in games j
than in practice all season, and they
must continue that good habit in or- 1
der to win tomorrow.
Coached by Bill Iliggins, the
Cubs have been coining along,
getting better with each game.
4 After a 2(5-25 loss to Auburn High
School in the last minute, they
trounced Mission High, 45 to 27.
Last week-end they really hit
their stride, downing Lowell High
by a lit-25 margin Friday night
and Polytechnic, 4H to 27, Satur
day.
High scorers on the Blue and j
Gold quintet are Bob Chalmers, j
center, and "Red" Snyder, forward, j
Chalmers is a good prospect for next
year's varsity, and Snyder rang up j
18 points against Poly. Dick David
at forward, and Lew Goldenson and
Bill Garretson, guards, complete the
line-up. David and Garretson are
rated almost as highly as Chalmers, j
Jack Fishman started the Mission i
game at forward.
If the Papooses play as they did
against (he Berkeley and Stock
ton preps, they will have an even j
chance of winning. If they arc no j
better than they were against the
St. Mary's frosh. however, their
chances will be slight.
Dick Neeley, big '39 guard, has |
been taking it easy this week with j
a sprained ankle. He will start to- j
morrow night, as rest has almost j
healed the injury. Pete McArthur
will pair with him in the backcourt, I
with tall Phil Zonne at center and j
Jack Kessel and Lyman Calkins at J
the forward posts. A big factor in
the frosh attempt to score their elev- j
enth straight, and most important, j
victory will consist of Zonne's sue- |
cess in maintaining his 18-point j
average.

game at forward.
If the Papooses play as they did
against (he Berkeley and Stock
ton preps, they will have an even j
chance of winning. If they arc no j
better than they were against the
St. Mary's frosh. however, their
chances will be slight.
Dick Neeley, big '39 guard, has |
been taking it easy this week with j
a sprained ankle. He will start to- j
morrow night, as rest has almost j
healed the injury. Pete McArthur
will pair with him in the backcourt, I
with tall Phil Zonne at center and j
Jack Kessel and Lyman Calkins at J
the forward posts. A big factor in
the frosh attempt to score their elev- j
enth straight, and most important, j
victory will consist of Zonne's sue- |
cess in maintaining his 18-point j
average.
Striving to match Bear Cub improvements and to reach their peak for
the California game tomorrow night, Indian frosli hoopsters engaged in an
other stifi' workout in yesterday's practice. Ihe drill included a half-hour
scrimmage between (he first and second teams.

Jimmy Bradshaw's
looked only fair in the semifinal'
session before their "Little Big |
Game" of the hardwood court. They
have played better bull in games j
than in practice all season, and they
must continue that good habit in or- 1
der to win tomorrow.
Coached by Bill Iliggins, the
Cubs have been coining along,
getting better with each game.
4 After a 2(5-25 loss to Auburn High
School in the last minute, they
trounced Mission High, 45 to 27.

their stride, downing Lowell High
by a lit-25 margin Friday night
and Polytechnic, 4H to 27, Satur
day.
High scorers on the Blue and j
Gold quintet are Bob Chalmers, j
center, and "Red" Snyder, forward, j
Chalmers is a good prospect for next
year's varsity, and Snyder rang up j
18 points against Poly. Dick David
at forward, and Lew Goldenson and
Bill Garretson, guards, complete the
line-up. David and Garretson are
rated almost as highly as Chalmers, j

game at forward.
