Tomorrow new fingers will
pound out this column as War- I
ren Breed, newly appointed sports i
editor, takes over the strip. And I
as this weather-beaten scribe j 1
scratches off his last splurge, it's _
with a certain amount of regret :
that everything is over.
I During this last quarter and a half j
i of Stanford sports there have been ;
' real thrills, thrills that sank deep i
j into anyone closely connected with |
the sporting field.
It was great to file that victory I
story from Washington after Stan-1
ford had tripped up the Huskies to \
start back to the top. It was a thrill j
1 to watch 'em eke out that 3-0 over j
I U.S.C. And then Cal—need any- i
1 thing be said about that thrill?
Down there in the Rose Bowl on i
New Year's Day when Stanford j
j beat the unbeaten. And hack here |
in the Pavilion two weeks ago j
when U.S.C. felt the Injun toma- i
hawk. The past season has been |
packed full of action.
Stanford had one of the finest foot- j
ball teams in the country last year; j
in fact, this scribe would be even i
so bold as to call it the best. It
! would have been mighty hard for
any team anywhere to have beaten
the Indians as they played in Pasa- j
! dena a few weeks ago.
Then right on top of that clean- j
up on the grid, comes a basket- j
ball team, the best Stanford has ;
had since 1921. To date that squad !
is tied for a conference lead, with I
a good chance to win it—a new
era for Indian hardwood forces. j
This scribe was fortunate to draw j
j the past prosperous season for i
i Farm sports.
