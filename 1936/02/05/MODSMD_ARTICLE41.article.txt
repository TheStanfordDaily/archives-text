# THE 						SPRING SHIFT WILL BE GOOD
## 
### 
But this spring term won't be *•
lacking action, either. There is the ;
| last half of the basketball season, j
. and that last half may be filled with 1.
I the fruits of a conference victory.
There is a new Angell Field on
which to start track activities and
though the cinder year may not be j
a knockout, it will be distinguished |
by the fact that Stanford has the
best in facilities with which to
build this and future teams.
The baseball outlook is best in j
several years, and certainly swim- j
j ming prospects are exceptionally j
good. And then the usually good ten- i
j nis and polo teams can be ex- j
pected. All in all, it should be an in- j
! teresting season and here's hoping, I
i Warren, that you get the same "boot" j
out of the job that has this scribe. J
