series between the two rolls around,
despite this first loss.

the frosh garnered, De Witt get
ting two triples and one single
out of four times at bat while

official trips to the plate.
The visiting nine got off to a good
lead in the first inning when they
scored four runs on a combination
of hits, errors, and walks. Although
the frosh came back and scored two
runs in their half of the second, the
Mission team added two more runs
at the beginning of the second and
held a safe'lead from that time on.
Stanford's lineup for the game
was Harry Cohn, catcher, Bob Coll
man, George Davis, and Wally De
Witt, pitchers, Walt Hege, first base,
Tony Mecia and Gardner Gray, sec
ond base, Henry Glasser, shortstop,
