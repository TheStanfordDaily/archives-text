# Duce Confers With Special Commissions
## Oil Sanctions Against Italy May Cause War 
### 
ROME, Feb. 4 {A?). â€”Premier Mus
solini, exerting every effort to have
Italy prepared for any European
eventuality, conferred tonight with
two of his most important councils.
He presided over a session of
the Supreme Commission on De
fense and then was closeted with
the Fascist Grand Council. It
was the second meeting of the j
Grand Council within four days.
Both conferences, at which the na- {
tion's military and economic re- |
sources were thoroughly analyzed, j
were believed directly tied up with '
consideration in Geneva of a pro- j
posal to add oil to the list of sanc
tions against Italy.
There have been open assertions
here that such a step by the league
would lead to a European war.
Among questions believed dis
cussed by the Defense Commission
were the development of substitutes
for raw materials hitherto imported;
military discipline of the civil popu
lation if the African conflict is ex- j
tended; maintenance of merchant
marine operations in case of war, j
and measures for protection of non- j
combatants.
The immediate military program,
particularly in Africa, was before I
the Grand Council.
