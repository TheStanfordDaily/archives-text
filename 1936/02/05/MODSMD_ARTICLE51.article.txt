Dlak Johnny and Phil:
You wonder why I'm writing such a letter
as this to you. It has never been done before
to my knowledge. But, since the outgoing edi
tor invariably writes his farewell to the in
coming editor and the defeated candidates
drop to the side, 1 wanted a chance to thank
you and the mighty line staff which has
worked so well and hard with me to build the
present Volume 88.
Realizing the kind of fellows you are, I
know you will agree with me that the stall'
has elected a capable, eflicienl journalist for
the editorship of Volume 89 of the Daily—
Millard Browne. In the election of Browney,
however, there was absolutely no belittling of
your talents, as he undoubtedly feels proud
to have defeated two opponents of your kind.
He's got a line stall lining up behind him, part
of the credit for which goes to you two, of
course, in the editorial board appointments
which we made yesterday. When we move
out, we like to think that the paper will never
compare with "the good ol' days," hut we
know from experience that that isn't so—it'll
probably he better.
Irvin Jorgensen and John McClelland
move iu as the two new associate editors.
Jorgi, with his "Our Hasher Sez" column, be
came the author of one of our greatest reader
interest columns of the volume. Mac, one of
those campus "red-hots," referred to so often
by (ieorge Bungle of comic-strip tame, comes
up from his "Bull Session" commenting post.
As the new women's editor, Dotty Sweet
will lilid fulfillment of her more than three
year dream for the lop women's position on
the paper. She replaces Jane Dodge who came
on the paper just about the same time I did.

Loren Irwin, a junior transfer, becomes
managing editor. lie will be remembered lor
the number of extras he put out, including
those of the Big (iaine and the sorority expose.
Hob Eisenbach, also of "Hull Session" fame,
becomes one of the six new night editors. Now
there is one guy who has always been around
and willing to handle a story, no matter what
the circumstances—and bis yarns were good.
With him will be Mort D'Evelvn, up from
handling photolith and "specials"; Dick
Hodgson, upped from news editor; good oP
Jack Newman, who worked hard and long
these three and a half years; Virginia .John
son, from A.P. desk; and Annalee Whitmore,
who lias been taking down the antics of Ex
Committee members this volume. Sophomore
Herb Diamond steps in as alternate night
editor.
Then there's (iordv Frost, the sophomore
who has been handling the sports department
as its editor. For a little varied experience,
he becomes one of the A.P. desk editors. War
ren Breed replaces him in the sports depart
ment. Those who have been yelling at Phil
Bernheim's reviews will (ind that he has
moved out of the line of attack with his news
editor appointment.
And then there are all those department
heads, copy eds, A.P. and desk eds who have
worked to make Volume <S<S .something and
now vacate positions for the "new-comers."
So you see the old Daily moves along—we
find that they can do without us. The one
consolation 1 have is that I will not have to
leave yet—l'll be camping across the hall in
the business oflice.
Best of luck, anyway,

present Volume 88.
Realizing the kind of fellows you are, I
know you will agree with me that the stall'
has elected a capable, eflicienl journalist for
the editorship of Volume 89 of the Daily—
Millard Browne. In the election of Browney,
however, there was absolutely no belittling of
your talents, as he undoubtedly feels proud
to have defeated two opponents of your kind.
He's got a line stall lining up behind him, part
of the credit for which goes to you two, of
course, in the editorial board appointments
which we made yesterday. When we move
out, we like to think that the paper will never
compare with "the good ol' days," hut we
know from experience that that isn't so—it'll
probably he better.
Irvin Jorgensen and John McClelland
move iu as the two new associate editors.
Jorgi, with his "Our Hasher Sez" column, be
came the author of one of our greatest reader
interest columns of the volume. Mac, one of
those campus "red-hots," referred to so often
by (ieorge Bungle of comic-strip tame, comes
up from his "Bull Session" commenting post.
As the new women's editor, Dotty Sweet
will lilid fulfillment of her more than three
year dream for the lop women's position on
the paper. She replaces Jane Dodge who came
on the paper just about the same time I did.

Loren Irwin, a junior transfer, becomes
managing editor. lie will be remembered lor
the number of extras he put out, including
those of the Big (iaine and the sorority expose.
Hob Eisenbach, also of "Hull Session" fame,
becomes one of the six new night editors. Now
there is one guy who has always been around
and willing to handle a story, no matter what
the circumstances—and bis yarns were good.
With him will be Mort D'Evelvn, up from
handling photolith and "specials"; Dick
Hodgson, upped from news editor; good oP
Jack Newman, who worked hard and long
these three and a half years; Virginia .John
son, from A.P. desk; and Annalee Whitmore,
who lias been taking down the antics of Ex
Committee members this volume. Sophomore
Herb Diamond steps in as alternate night
editor.
Then there's (iordv Frost, the sophomore
who has been handling the sports department
as its editor. For a little varied experience,
he becomes one of the A.P. desk editors. War
ren Breed replaces him in the sports depart
ment. Those who have been yelling at Phil
Bernheim's reviews will (ind that he has
moved out of the line of attack with his news
editor appointment.
And then there are all those department
heads, copy eds, A.P. and desk eds who have
worked to make Volume <S<S .something and
now vacate positions for the "new-comers."
So you see the old Daily moves along—we
find that they can do without us. The one
consolation 1 have is that I will not have to
leave yet—l'll be camping across the hall in
the business oflice.
Best of luck, anyway,
