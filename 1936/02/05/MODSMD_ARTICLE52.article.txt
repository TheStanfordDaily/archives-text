# Still Hoping for Decent Theater Dedication Program
## 
### 
liefore a corner-stone can be laid, there has
to be some place to lay it.
That, in ell'cct, was about all the New The
ater committee learned yesterday when they
met with Dr. Wilbur to discuss the long-de
layed pre-dedicalory ceremony. The student
group was informed that no Bibles, newspa
pers, and other destined-for-posterily objects
can be sealed beneath grey granite until the
concrete and steel which will form the thea
ter's foundation is laid. And that won't be
until late in spring quarter.
Ordinarily corner-stone laying is even less
than a mere formality. And it's true that the
ollieial and final dedicatory exercises will be
held next fall when the theater is actually
completed.
Hut there are a good many score of seniors
who will be able to say they had a part in
taking dramatics out of the assembly hall.
They'll be graduated before the theater is
completed, and deserve a chance to take a
part in exercises which will climax and end
their efforts.
I he administration again has promised full
co-operation in arranging and putting on the

ceremony. We hope that promise can he in
terpreted to mean the administration will
meet student interest in the corner-stone lay
ing hall' way, and that it will evidence that in
terest by setting a definite date and making
possible the kind of program the event tie
serves.
