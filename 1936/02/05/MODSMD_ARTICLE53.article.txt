# Bull Session
## STANFORD'S OSTRICHES 
### 
"Thou shalt not smoke in fond memory of Mrs.
Stanford and the insurance company," intones Ex
Committee.
Comes the dramatic appeal, "It's for sentiment!"
Comes the reasonable appeal, "It's for economy."
To which the complaisant Stanfordite says, "Uh
huh," and the rambunctious Stanfordite, "Link Sau
sage!"

For certainly, the reasons given by Ex Committee
for its last diplomatic masterpiece, abolition of Quad
smoking, cannot be dignified with the name "bologna."
Probably the only favorable thing to be said for their
dictum is that it proves ostriches, most hypocritical
of animals, are distinctly related to man.
Perhaps because they felt that sentiment has noth
ing to do with money. Ex Committee drew a careful
distinction between Mrs. Stanford and the insurance
company. That worthy body believed it should sanc
tify a founder who would be the last to desire saint
hood, and to carefully disassociate her from com
mon-sense, on which the founder prided herself.

Now, painful as it may be, good authorities have it
that Mis. Stanford's objection to Quad smoking sprang
not from a holy visitation in sleep, but a perfectly
sensible desire to keep the Quad clean of cigarette
butts and accompanying debris.
Mrs. Stanford also "sentimentally" frowned on tui
tion charges, and hoped that Stanford Would always
emphasize its training of the hands rather than train
ing of the mind. Today, though the founder's wishes on
fees and curriculum certainly have the same force
as they did in 18J)0, we do charge tuition, and Stanford
is known as much for its academic standing as for
its standing in the mechanical arts. Ex Committee had
better get busy and complete this sentiment drive,
reduce tuition charges, and put in some new depart
ments, or at least inform the Board of Trustees that
we're violating the founder's covenant.

Is this a quibbling argument? Sure! Mrs. Stan
ford, who lives high in our memory, would be the last
person to enforce her preferences from the grave.
If "no smoking on the Quad" would aid the uni
versity economically, she would certainly want the
University to say so, honestly and without qualifica
tion. She would be the last person in the world who
would want to stalk the Quad with head upraised,
whispering, "Stop smoking, for me."

Ex Committee isn't being "sentimental," it's being
downright insulting to the woman it hypocritically
honors. Together with students who realize the ne
cessity of the no smoking limitation, hor sensibilities
might well recoil at any group that plays soft and
unctuous music to muffle the mighty healthy ring of the
cash register. —Bob Eisenbach
