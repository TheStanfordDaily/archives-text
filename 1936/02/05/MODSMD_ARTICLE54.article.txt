In the Stanford Daily office, besides the typewrit
ers, tables, reporters, assistant editors, stray cats,
scratch paper, and an editor or two, there is a great
hulking thing that makes queer noises and is called
a telephone booth. Into this cage the other night there
walked a freshman reporter. Some wise-guy snapped
the padlock on the door shut, locking him in.
Now this has always been a standing joke among
Daily scribes, but in this instance they reckoned
with a superior intellect. Since the reporter was in
full possession of the telephone system, he dialed the
Paly police, and told them of his predicament. They
radioed Campus Cop George Burns, who hopped into
his car Racy Allen, collected two firemen and some
axes, and prepared to chop the guy out.
When these boys arrived and saw the situation,
they decided not to cut the comedy and left the stooge
locked, stuck, and barreled. Finally the third assistant
editor in charge of locking and unlocking doors let
him out, ending the round.
Our pulchritudinous, verisimilitudinous, farm femi
ninity have made many remarks about getting hung
up or stuck with Stanford men. I ask them, did they
ever try the gum under the counter in the Cellar?
Nominations for oblivion are now being passed
around in the current A.S.S.U. election campaign.
Some day they are going to find a fugitive from a
chain gang hiding in the solitude of an A.S.S.U.
office.
The Zete house has one of these boys, who they
think may be at least a class treasurer. It seems that
be transferred up here this year from the sunny South
land. Down there he had pledged the Zeta Psi frater
nity. So when he came to Stanford he moved his bag
gage, his etchings, his golf clubs, and his elephant
gun into the front room. The brothers pointed to a
spot on the front lawn, but they missed it by two feet.
So the visiting brother moved down town. But he
was not scared, with his elephant gun, so he came
up to the house every day for meals.

But none of the brothers spoke to him, and he
spoke to none of the brothers. For quite a while this
has gone on. For the silent partner, however, this has
proven to be a quite satisfactory arrangement. No
one has spoken yet about house bills.
