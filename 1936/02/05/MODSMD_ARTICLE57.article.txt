(Continued)

The second group of Coward's j
scries, called "Tonight at 8:30," of- !
I fers heavier substance. "Hands !
Across the Sea," like "Hayfever" i
I and "The Vortex," is pure Coward
( wit and Mayfair drawing room ridi- .
| cule.
"Fumed Oak" is an unpleasant
comedy in a drab setting. Cow
ard, in spectacles and a grey wig, l
plays a hen-pecked department ;
store floor walker. He turns on
his wife, child, and mother-in-law
| and 011 the strength of two whis
kies summons tip enough gump
| tion to strike out for new worlds,
j but before he goes, lie unravels
the whole stream of 15 years' in
hibited opinions.
"Shadow Play" is the most re- 1
! markable of all six plays in dra- j
j matic worth and novelty. The story j
! is simple, but the handling distinctly j

new. On the verge of divorce, Ger
trude Lawrence, as the jiited wife,
takes an overdose of amytal. The
confusion of her mind, recalling past
experiences of love and rapture,
mixes the past with the present
state of affairs.
Songs, dances in the Wigwam
manner, the glaring incongruity
which characterizes a dream,
mingled emotions, and appropriate
lyrics, compel an empathy which
is deeply stirring. From this play
comes the tune, "You Were
There," for which great popularity
is predicted.
Noel Coward has reached a turn
ing point in his career; he could go
on writing witty satires, or develop
his more serious and intellectual at
titudes. From the tenor of these six
plays, from his own attitude toward
work, and from the sincerity of his
effort, I believe his future work will
be of a more serious, or rather se
riously satirical, nature.â€”Balzer
