# FARMERETTE DATED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I guess it pays to advertise after
all. The impossible has happened
: and someone has taken the Farmer -
! ettes to the show, or I should say
they took one of the Farmerettes;
j the other dear girl was sick in the
1 hospitalâ€”what a shame!
The cupid in disguise was none
i other than the Hard-Working-Law
j Student. It's a long story, and if
j anyone really wants it they can un
doubtedly get it by writing to Boxes
I 1423 and 1182.
Now that the Farmerettes have
j come through, perhaps Susan will
let us know who possesses that
charming intellect.
