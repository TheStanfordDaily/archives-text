EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE a
motion picture comes along that is
something more than just a play
recorded on film. Such u picture is
"The Informer," rated by many crit
ics as the best film of the year.
"The Informer" may be rated as
one of those peculiar "arty" pictures,
but unlike most of its genre, it is
good entertainment, and the "art" is
not so obvious as to be obtrusive.
In its story of the Black and Tan
troubles in Ireland after the War,
and the tale of a Republican who
"informed." It draws a parallel with
the story of Judas, who "informed"
on Christ for 30 pieces of silver, but
not until the last sccne is the com
parison pointed out.
Victor McLaglen in the title role
turns in what can only be described
by the trite phrase, "one of the
screen's greatest performances"; but
in this case, at least, that phrase is
the only adequate one.
RUSSIA has more motion pic

ture theaters than any other coun
try in the world, but the good old
U.S.A. leads when it comes to houses
wired for sound, according to a De
partment of Commerce survey.
CHARLIE CIIAPUN'S first pic
ture in four years, "Modem Times,"
gets its world premiere at New
York's Rivoli Theater today.
LINE CHARGES for network
broadcasting are plenty high. NBC
paid $2,400,000 last year, and CBS
shelled out $1,800,000. With the
adding of the Coast Blue NBC net
