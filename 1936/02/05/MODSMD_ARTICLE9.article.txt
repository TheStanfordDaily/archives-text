When is a sophomore?
Ex Committee last night faced the
I problem of deciding the dividing
lines between classes, to determine
j eligibility for offices in the coming
A.S.S.U. election. The ruling was: a
freshman must have from no units
to 29; a soph from 30 to 74; and a
junior from 75 to 119.
The candidates must have the
; units at the time of taking office, not
! when running, furthermore decided
! the group. Committeemen Frank
Fullenwider and Sterling Cottrell
J drew up a by-law to cover the sit
| uation. It was passed unanimously.
PUBLICATIONS COUNCIL min- j
utes, recognizing the election of
Millard Browne as Daily editor,
) were approved. "Clean election,"
commended outgoing Editor Bob
Jones.
DRAMATIC COUNCILS privi
lege to amend its own charter was
upheld by the group. Phil Bern
heim and Fullenwider reported on
Dean Marion Kirkwood's ruling, and
| concluded that all subsidiary organ
i izations have the power to amend
j their own by-laws. Fullenwider
; drafted a by-law providing that a
1 majority of Ex Committee must ap
prove each amendment before it
| goes into effect.
DRAMA MANAGER should be
j chosen by the remaining members
of Dramatic Council if the office is
vacated between appointments, sug
gested a Dramatic Council motion.
The motion died for lack of a sec
ond.
FOOTBALL AWARDS were
granted to Ray Todd, Alex Trompas,
and Fred Williams. Frank Alustiza
was awarded an additional letter
I under the new injury clause.
Primo Pinotti was suggested for a
soccer letter, also to be granted un
i der the injury ruling. Award was
j approved.
ELECTION BOARD appoint
ments included Elsie Lillard, to re
place Esther Pelton, and Sis Young
| to replace Jackie Brown.
"Lillard's a Row girl—that's not
| fair," observed Helen Grover.
"Anyone who's sucker enough to
work deserves the job," concluded
j Bob Gi'os.
BIG GAME BONFIRE cost $31.40
! more than intended, said Gros. The
grant made last fall only totaled
; $100. The difference was granted,
: reluctantly. "To vote 'no' means that
| we irftpair the credit of A.5.5.U.,"
he warned.

I appointments for the Convalescent
Home Drive, were not accepted.
"All of them are Cardinals—graft!"
accused Fullcnwider.
