freshman must have from no units
to 29; a soph from 30 to 74; and a
junior from 75 to 119.
The candidates must have the
; units at the time of taking office, not
! when running, furthermore decided
! the group. Committeemen Frank
Fullenwider and Sterling Cottrell

| uation. It was passed unanimously.
