# NYA CHECKS READY
## 
### 
Students employed on NYA will
be paid their checks this morning at
8:30 o'clock in the lobby of the Ad
ministration Building, announced
Lee L. Yancey, chief accountant.
Mr. Yancey added that he would ap
preciate students getting their checks
today, as a clerk will be there to
take charge of them, and asking for
checks late disrupts the office.
