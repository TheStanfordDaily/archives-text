# Old Boy Copp's Greek Number Out Today
## 
### 
Riding astride his high-powered
three-wheeled mouse, Old Boy
Chappie Copp rolled into The Daily
offices last night to announce that
the February Chaparral will be on
sale today.
"It's the Fraternity and Soror
ity Number," lie chortled, "and
what's best, for the first time
Chappie will let the new pledges
know just what they are in for.
All the houses, from the Alpha
Drool fraternity to the Pi Phums
sorority will be represented. Gad,
what an array!"
Anne Ritchie will be on hand
with her Horse Falls letter, and
Little Pop-off, he of the war-paint,
will caper about as usual under the
guiding hand of Charles Hood, to say
nothing at Ruth Goodan ("The Girl
Who KNOWS"), who will present

! her views on just exactly why the
| Kappa rushing system proved a flop
this year.
"Featured," mused Copp, "will
he a full-page drawing of Senator
II iram Johnson. Oilier art work
will include sketches hy Kollin
Pickford, Dick Dawson, (Oilman
Ciist, Jr., Curtis Barnes, Dor
man 11. Smith, and a photograph
of a typical Stanford sorority
during rushing time, snapped by-
Chappie's candid cameraman."'
The cover has been done by one
Gist, and shows a quadareepeegreep
(fraternity member) out head-hunt
ing for male water hydras, para
maecia, abalones, barnacles, and
other suckers.
"On the whole," said the Old Boy,
"it's quite a number, quite a num
â€¢ ber."
