Pity for the Stanford co-eds who
are griped by the Farm men was
expressed in a letter to "The Ice
Box," student opinion column of
the Daily Californian. Taking the
complete problem of the terrific
women from the Farm on his
shoulders, this California senior
suggests a Cal-Stanford exchange
dance "to give the poor girls of
the Farm a break."
The letter to the "Monarch of
the College Dailies" points the
way to the perfect date by having
Cal fellows dating only Stanford
women, and Farm boys dating
Cal girls. It appears as if some of
the boys from over Berkeley way
want to take out a much-publi
cized Stanford co-ed—but the edi
tor of the Daily Cal expresses his
opinion of the idea in the caption
above the letter, "Bad Company."
Maybe he has had experience.
