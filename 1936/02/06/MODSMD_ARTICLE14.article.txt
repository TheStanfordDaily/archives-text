### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 5, (/Pi. —Zero
weather numbed the northern half
of the Nation from the Rockies east
ward today, and send cold shivers
from coast to coast.
Murcury columns sank to 44 be
low zero in the Northeast, and all
but a half dozen points scattered
over the land were chilled.
Forty-degree temperature drops
were common as the bitter cold
moved over the Midwest toward the
Atlantic. The zero line extended
from the Dakotas into Ohio and
south to Missouri. Tomorrow it is
expected to reach New England.
Southern floods were dried up
by the freezing onslaughts, which
blanketed the Ciulf Coast and
Northern Florida, but flood vic
tims suffered intensely. Five lost
lives, and hundreds were driven
from their homes by the raging
streams.
Even West Coast thermometers
sank, as a result of the new Arctic
blasts from Canada's frigid Mac-
Kenzie river basin.
