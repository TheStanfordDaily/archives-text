Telling adventures of a bewildered
youth from apron strings to amor
ous adventure in pantomine, Trudi
Schoop, internationally famous Swiss
artiste, and her Comic Ballet will
present "Fridolin on the Road" in
the Stanford Pavilion at 8:20 o'clock
tomoiTow night.
"Want Ads", a scries of episodes
recounting the tragi-comedies un
derlying. newspaper .advertis -
ements, will make up the second
part of her highly original pro
gram. By this unique form of en
tertainment which she has origin
ated, the quaint, prematurely-sil
ver-haired actress had scored an
outstanding hit even before the
intermission at her first American
performance in New York.
As a result, her bookings have
had to be more than juggled, ac
cording to her agent, S. Hurok, who
imported the company from Switzer
land, in order to accomodate the
crowds flocking to her performances
and yet to crowd in a full coast tour
before the troop again sails for
European engagements.
Although the little pantominist
speaks French, German, and Ital
ian fluently, she does not under
stand English. But she finds
America "different". "'People
here aren't afraid of expressing
their enthusiasm of the theater
as in Europe," she says.
Tickets for the concert are avail
able at Keeble's in Palo Alto, or at
the Concert Office on the campus.
All lost ticket must be reported
at the latter pJace before the night
of the performance.
