# Gros, Chapin Battle in Council
## 
### 
An exchange of bitter personal
criticism between Bob Gros, stu
dent manager, and Mr. Lee Chapin,
debate adviser, culminating in an of- '
fer of resignation by Stanford's for
ensics mentor, last night climaxed '
a stormy session of Debate Council. !
Gros, according to council mem- j
bers, started the fray when he intro- l
duced a motion questioning the ad- j
visability of spending $150 of Debate
Council funds for a trip to Vancou
ver and a future debate with the
University of British Columbia.
That amount, granted last quar
ter by Ex Committee, had also been
questioned at that body's meeting
Tuesday night, when Gros inform
ally questioned the advisability of !
spending $150 on a single debate,
when the grant was for a "Northwest
tour."
At the council meeting Gros, who
based his prerogative on his con
stitutionally granted control of stu
dent funds, characterized the ex
penditure as unjustified.
Mr. Chapin warned the council
that if the motion were voted on, he
would resign his position as debate
coach. Although the motion was j
withdrawn, the discussion continued,
culminating in bitter criticism and
declarations that Gros, former stu- ;
dent debate manager, was blocking
the progress of debating at Stanford.
