# Britain Expands Arms: Humor
## Cabinet May Begin New Civil Defense Authority 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 5 (/P). â€” Secret
plans for expanding Great Britain's
imperial defenses, an authoritative
source said, were before the Cabinet
today.
Some sources suggested the
Cabinet was likely to create a new
defense authority, composed of
representatives of the navy, army
and air force, meeting under the
chairmanship of a civilian.
Details of the government pro
gram for rearmament, however,
awaited the disclosure which Prime
Minister Stanley Baldwin told the
House of Commons, after it recon
vened yesterday, would be made "at
an early date" in a white paper.
The Laborite, George Lansbury,
meanwhile, drafted a peace reso
lution to be introduced immedi
ately to the House.
This resolution, parliamentary
sources said, would provide the first
opportunity since the start of the
Italo-Ethiopian conflict for a full
dress debate on the subjects of
colonial government and raw mate
rials.
