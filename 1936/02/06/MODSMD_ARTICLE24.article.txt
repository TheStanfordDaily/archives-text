# Hoop Men Leave Tonight for Ucla To Finish Series
## Wins Mean Southern Division Lead Over U.S.C.; Bunn Drills Team in Passing, Jump 
### 
When the "Lark" pulls out of the Paly station at 9:13 o'clock tonight,
hound for Los Angeles, it will carry something rare—a Stanford basket
hall team hound for a possible conference title.
Hopeful Indian rooters eagerly await two games with U.C.L.A., which
will either speed their team on its way or sidetrack its ambition seriously.

Reason for this situation is the fact
that John Bunn's cagers, now neck
and neck with the Trojans in the
southern division race, may well pull
ahead or drop into second place to
morrow and Saturday nights.
In spite of only an even break on

Bruins. U.S.C. has twice felt the
pressure that Hank Luisetti and his

Zonne, and Jack Calderwood as

coal, auguring well for future

Passing drills and jump-ball plays

the last session before the Uclan
tussles. Bunn wishes no repetition

j 37, in spite of many shots made good
by Luisetti and Turner.
Led by John "Goon" Ball, who
scored 21 points to beat Stanford

When the "Lark" pulls out of the Paly station at 9:13 o'clock tonight,
hound for Los Angeles, it will carry something rare—a Stanford basket
hall team hound for a possible conference title.
Hopeful Indian rooters eagerly await two games with U.C.L.A., which
will either speed their team on its way or sidetrack its ambition seriously.

Reason for this situation is the fact
that John Bunn's cagers, now neck
and neck with the Trojans in the
southern division race, may well pull
ahead or drop into second place to
morrow and Saturday nights.
In spite of only an even break on
the Farm three weeks ago, Stan
ford rates a slight edge over the
Bruins. U.S.C. has twice felt the
pressure that Hank Luisetti and his
boys can apply when necessary, and
the Indians are about due to turn
the heat on U.C.L.A.
Lots of heat may he required,
and Chief Stoker Bunn worked to
develop it in yesterday's prac
