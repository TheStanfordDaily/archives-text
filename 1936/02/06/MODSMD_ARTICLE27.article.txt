# Shakspere, Coward Vie for Popularity
## 
### 
William Shakespeare vs. Noel
Coward! That's the angle on the
dramatic situation as revealed by the
records of Sword and Sandals, men's
honorary dramatic society of Stan
ford University. Of the 47 play
readings presented by the society
since its beginning in the spring i
quarter of 1932, four were written ;
by Shakespeare and four by Noel
Coward. The Shakespearean dramas |
are: "Richard II," "Twelfth Night,"
"Merry Wives of Windsor," and a
broadcast of "Julius Caesar." The
Coward plays are: "Home Chat,"
"Hay Fever," and two perform
ances of "Private Lives."
Ibsen Favored
Campus attendance gives second \
place in popularity to Ibsen, Shaw, >
and George S. Kaufman, with three |
plays by each read by Sword and i
Sandals.
In the line-up for third choice, j
with two presentations from each of
their works, Sheridan, Molnar, |
Moliere, O'Neill, Maugham, and i
Rostand rival the old Greek plays, I
Sophocles' "Antigone," and the j
Capeks' "Insect Comedy," which :
were repeated by request.

Familiar Plays Favored
Sherwood, Van Druten, Milne,
Congreve, Webster, Wilde, Gold
smith, Schnitzler, Lillo, Tcheckov,
and Afinogenyev are among those
represented once in Sword and San
dals' list of readings.
Does this survey, revealing classic
literature neck-and-neck with
modern wit, measure accurately the
cultural standards of Stanford stu
dents? The attraction seems to be
in those plays with which "one
ought to be familiar"—by Shake
speare, Sophocles, Ibsen, and
O'Neill, and those consisting of snap
py modern dialogue filled with fast
■ Hying wisecracks, as exemplified in
! the words of Coward, Shaw, Molnar,
j Kaufman, and Maugham.
