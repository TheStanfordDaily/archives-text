# France, Great Britain Move To Thwart U.S.
## Larger Ships Preferred By America Anglo – French Meet Follows Invitation To U.S. To Decide Stand 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 5 (/P). —A French
maneuver to win British support for I
a program of smaller battle ships, i
opposed by the United States, was j
disclosed by authoritative sources j
close to the International Naval
Conference today.
The French move was made in
an unannounced discussion be
tween delegates of France and
Great Britain last night. The bi
lateral conversation was mainly j
concerned with battleship ton
nages.
A British source said the French
took the position of holding a strong
preference for 27,500-ton battle
ships, but this source refused to in
dicate whether the request was ac
ceptable to the British.
The United States has long ad
vocated 35,000-ton capital ships—
the limit incorporated in the j
Washington naval treaty of 1!)22.
The Americans argue that larger
ships are necessary for the United
States because of the greater j
cruising range the American navy j
must accomplish due to the ab- i
sence of interlocking naval bases.
The Anglo-French talk closely I
followed a French move of calling
on the Americans to discuss the !
position of Germany's participation 1
in the naval conference as advo- j
cated by Great Britain.
