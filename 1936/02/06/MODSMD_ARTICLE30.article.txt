Questioned as to their opinions of
the proposed change in the make-up
of the Ex Committee—that repre
sentation should be by organization,
rather than by class, some students
expressed approbation while others
said that they thought the new sys
tem would be unfair.
Mark Hopkins, Branner Hall:
"The system of group representa
tion would disenfranchise many
students. The position of the expert
in government is in an advisory ca
pacity, anyway. The Ex Committee
should remain as it is—a representa
tive body. If it needs expert advice
let it call for it as does Congress."
Elsie Lillard, Pi Phi: "Since Ex
Committee is supposed to represent
all students, and since not all of the
students belong to organizations, I
believe that the present system of
representation by classes should be
maintained."
Spike Furman, Phi Psi and var
sity pitcher: "I do not think that the
system should be adopted as it would
tend to give upperclassmen an un
fair advantage."
Phyllis Corson, Alpha Phi: "Rep
resentation by class is better -than
by group because there is not so
much prejudice shown in the
choice."
Boh Mcßoskey, Phi Delt: "I think
that the plan is pretty good, but it
doesn't seem to me that the system
of representation makes much dif
ference, as long as the officers are
efficient and honest."
