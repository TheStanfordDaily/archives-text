# Susan, Who Art Thou? Hasher Gives His Dope
## 
### OUR HASHER (Exclusive to the Dilly Dailly 
I found Susan!
Lowell Thomas and The Fox
Movietone News and the moustache
have nothing on me.
While hundreds of spurious Su
sans were waltzing at the Lagunita
jolly-up, Our Hasher, operating on
a tip-off straight from Wong's
Kitch, swooped down on the Paly
home of the Stanford history pro
fessor in a local subdivision, and
found our heroine.
Not that Susan wasn't highly in
favor of the Lagunita jolly-up. No.
She was certainly there in spirit,
but she did not attend because the
risks of discovery were too great.
In the first place, let's not con
fuse this Susan business any more
than it has been. Susan is not a
flibbertygibbet freshman woman
who is sitting home hoping some
man will call up. No, she is not even
registered in Stanford. She grad
uated here last year in the School
of Social Sciences. She is a sorority
woman. She transferred here at the
end of her junior year, after attend
ing the eastern schools of Columbia
and Indiana.
Susan knows what she's talking
about. The fact that her reply to
Eisenbach's Bull Session has elicited
such a storm of comment in Daily
campus opinion columns is proof
that she has put her finger on a
campus sore spot.
She is sorry that there has been
such a confusion of issues over the
whole matter. Her puipose was not
to get a date with the estimable Mr.
Eisenbach, rather she was altruis
tically trying to remedy that crying
campus social evil: the inherent
loneliness that all students feel,
whether they live in Row, Hall, or
Paly. Susan wishes to break down
the barriers that have been built
up between natural and friendly
conversation, she wishes to take the
Bull Session off the Daily edit page
and spread it around the campus.
She wishes to make the "Hello Tra
dition" more than a tradition.
Quite frankly she admits she does
n't know how she's going to do it.
At Oberlin, she points out, mixed
dining halls help to take the rough
edges off the smug little boors that
come out of high school.
There is nothing more snobbish
than an adolescent aristocrat trying
in a patronizing manner to be a
democrat.
Susan does not wish to have her
identity known, since she doesn't
feel that it is a personal matter.
Our Hasher respects her for her
wish and is not revealing it. Susan
doesn't want to try to keep up the

fight and explain her position at the
risk of becoming tedious, but I for
one am enough of an idealist and a
believer in democracy at Stanford
to hope that she does.

dition" more than a tradition.
Quite frankly she admits she does
n't know how she's going to do it.
At Oberlin, she points out, mixed
dining halls help to take the rough
edges off the smug little boors that
come out of high school.
There is nothing more snobbish
than an adolescent aristocrat trying
in a patronizing manner to be a
democrat.
Susan does not wish to have her
identity known, since she doesn't
feel that it is a personal matter.
Our Hasher respects her for her
wish and is not revealing it. Susan
doesn't want to try to keep up the

fight and explain her position at the
risk of becoming tedious, but I for
one am enough of an idealist and a
believer in democracy at Stanford
to hope that she does.
I found Susan!
Lowell Thomas and The Fox
Movietone News and the moustache
have nothing on me.
While hundreds of spurious Su
sans were waltzing at the Lagunita
jolly-up, Our Hasher, operating on
a tip-off straight from Wong's
Kitch, swooped down on the Paly
home of the Stanford history pro
fessor in a local subdivision, and
found our heroine.
Not that Susan wasn't highly in
favor of the Lagunita jolly-up. No.
She was certainly there in spirit,
but she did not attend because the
risks of discovery were too great.
In the first place, let's not con
fuse this Susan business any more
than it has been. Susan is not a
flibbertygibbet freshman woman
who is sitting home hoping some
man will call up. No, she is not even
registered in Stanford. She grad
uated here last year in the School
of Social Sciences. She is a sorority
woman. She transferred here at the
end of her junior year, after attend
ing the eastern schools of Columbia
and Indiana.
Susan knows what she's talking
about. The fact that her reply to
Eisenbach's Bull Session has elicited
such a storm of comment in Daily
campus opinion columns is proof
that she has put her finger on a
campus sore spot.
She is sorry that there has been
such a confusion of issues over the
whole matter. Her puipose was not
to get a date with the estimable Mr.
Eisenbach, rather she was altruis
tically trying to remedy that crying
campus social evil: the inherent
loneliness that all students feel,
whether they live in Row, Hall, or
Paly. Susan wishes to break down
the barriers that have been built
up between natural and friendly
conversation, she wishes to take the
Bull Session off the Daily edit page
and spread it around the campus.
She wishes to make the "Hello Tra
dition" more than a tradition.
Quite frankly she admits she does
n't know how she's going to do it.
