# Track Team Will Meet Washington on March 27
## Indian Team Given Chance To Avenge Last Year's Defeat Burrows Runs 9:40.5 To Bolster Hopes; Long Schedule Announced for Spring 
### 
A chance to vindicate last year's (iS-03 track defeat at the hands of the
University of Washington will be given Dink Templeton's I?>'3G charges
when they meet the Huskies in a return engagement in Seattle March 27.
The Washington meet, which had been but the hazy hope of most of
the trackmen throughout the fall, was made a reality in the 1930 schedule,

which was released yesterday. The^ -
calendar calls for five dual meets,
Washington, Olympic Club, U.C.
1,.A., U.S.C., and Cal, together with
team entries in four other group

meets.
Dink Tenipleton, with the Husky
meet a surety, cast one eye up
ward at the elements, and feeling
secure (bat no rain would fall tbat
day, issued orders for a meet. The
stadium track was somewhat
slow from previous sains, but not
slow enough to keep Edson Bur
rows from slashing his personal
1 two-mile record down to 9:40.5
from 9:43.
Burrows was paccd around by
Norm Bright, former Stanford stu
dent, and hung on well until the last
lap, when Bright .shot out to finish
in 9:34.5, which mark was unmen
tioned during the plaudits for Bur
rows.
Humbert Smith, who is jump
ing with a consistency that should
promise him the good season he
has deserved for two years,
cleared his usual (i feet 4.
Chuck Nimmo showed definite
signs of a comeback when he de
feated Warren Dixon by a safe mar
gin in a 4:30.5 mile. Jim Reynolds
got his best shot-put of the season
to date with 48 feet 4 x fc inches.
Phil Levy threw the discus 146
feet, promising many points thip
season, while Biil McCurdy edged
out A1 Cranston in a 2:01 880. That
time, together with Weiershauser's
51.3 quarter and Ray Dean's 10.5
century, are commendable for a slow
track.

Dink Tenipleton, with the Husky
meet a surety, cast one eye up
ward at the elements, and feeling
secure (bat no rain would fall tbat
day, issued orders for a meet. The
stadium track was somewhat
slow from previous sains, but not
slow enough to keep Edson Bur
rows from slashing his personal
1 two-mile record down to 9:40.5
from 9:43.
Burrows was paccd around by
Norm Bright, former Stanford stu
dent, and hung on well until the last
lap, when Bright .shot out to finish
in 9:34.5, which mark was unmen
tioned during the plaudits for Bur
rows.
Humbert Smith, who is jump
ing with a consistency that should
promise him the good season he
has deserved for two years,
cleared his usual (i feet 4.
Chuck Nimmo showed definite
signs of a comeback when he de
feated Warren Dixon by a safe mar
gin in a 4:30.5 mile. Jim Reynolds
got his best shot-put of the season
to date with 48 feet 4 x fc inches.
Phil Levy threw the discus 146
feet, promising many points thip
season, while Biil McCurdy edged
out A1 Cranston in a 2:01 880. That
time, together with Weiershauser's
51.3 quarter and Ray Dean's 10.5
century, are commendable for a slow
track.
