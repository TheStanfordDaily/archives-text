### 
Stanford's boxing team opens its
1936 intercollegiate season tonight
when it stages .10 regular bouts and
two exhibition matches with the Cal
Aggies at Davis.
The Indians will meet stiff compe
tition in the Davis lads, because
boxing is a major sport at the Aggie
institution.
Team Captain Dick Winzler in the
135-pound class, Sims De Veuve,
Pacific Coast light heavyweight
champion of last year, and Frank
Myndcrse in the 165-pound division
will lead the Farm boxers into the
fray.
