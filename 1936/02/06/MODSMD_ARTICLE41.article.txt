ABOUT 808 FOWLER—
HE'S NOT PAU
You'll hear on all hands and sides j
that Bob Fowler, Cal track cap- !
tain, will run no two miles this year. ;
But before you ease his name off j
into the limbo of other jinxed cap- j
tains, pause for a moment's flirt
with probability.
This department will be fooled
considerably if Bob does not figure
in the nation's biggest meets in this,
his senior year and the year of the
Eleventh Olympiad in Berlin.
Fowler, who took second in the
1.C.4-A. last year at Cambridge, has
been widely publicized in the last
month as being in the also-ran divi
sion, kept from the cinders by a
so-called Achilles tendon. Now it is
doubtful whether his mother dipped i
him in the River Styx as a youth, but !
he did not run in cross-country last j
fall, and hasn't donned spikes so far [
this winter. His ankle, tendon, or
heel, whatever it is, is not condu
cive to national championships.
The ailment, as serious or myste- |
rious as it is, however, probably will j
not prevent Fowler from running j
within the next three months.
Fowler should run. He should line 1
up against Ed Burrows in the Big
Meet next April, and he should be !
in New York next summer when j
they hold the Olympic tryouts.
IT'LL TAKE TIME.
BUT THAT MEANS LITTLE
Of course, the loose, lanky Pied- ;
mont fellow isn't going out tomor- 1
row. Brutus Hamilton, *his coach, I
would have none of that. He prob
ably won't go out for many weeks |
yet, but if he can put on his spikes ,
and run on his toes without too
much limping, he'll be in the thick '
of it.

And there is little doubt to his ad
herents but what he could run a 10
flat two-mile with about two or !
three weeks' warming up. And in a
month more, probably in time for i
the Big Meet, he'd be down to his old I
haunts around 9:30 or thereabouts, j
He's built that way. He has long,
long-muscled legs, little weight to ;
carry about, and there's just some- |
thing about the physiology of the j
fellow that lets him run farther in
less time than others. He just does- i
n't get tired.
Last year when he ran 9.31 to beat
the Michigan champ, he sprinted
practically the whole last lap, like
lie always does, broke the tape with
a bit of a smile, walked over to his i
sweat clothes, slipped them on, and
jogged over to where some of his j
team-mates were warming up for j
the relay, affected by the record race
only in a slight heaviness of the
legs and a good sweat.
Then you can't forget the way the
r idio announcer almost went daft at
the 1.C.4-A. last year when he had
announced that the guy in first place
was a cinch, and ihen almost lost ,
his head when Fowler came up as
unexpectedly as Lindbergh did to
almost nip the winner at the tape.
So unless you know a little more
about Achilles tendons than is gen
erally known around here, why, jot
down Fowler for «ome sweet races
this spring. —Breed
