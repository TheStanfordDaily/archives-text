# Frosh Squad Opens Cal Hoop Series
## Cubs Threaten To Break Papoose Record of Wins 
### 
Stanford's frosh basketeers tackle
the invading Cal Cubs tonight at j
7:30 o'clock in the Pavilion, deter- !
mined to make the contest eleventh j
in their series of straight wins over '
sundry high schools and preps.
The story of this game will be a !
little different, however, regardless i
of score. Thus far in the yearlings' |
schedule going has been pretty easy ;
and lop-sided scores predominant, j
but opposition hasn't been up to the |
standard which the Cubs are ex- 1
pected to display tonight.
Conservative dopesters say the ;
odds are even. Coach Jimmy Brad- ;
shaw said yesterday afternoon after j
workout:
"I think we can take them if our
defense tightens up and clicks as j
it should. Scoring practice the j
last few days has strengthened the
offense, and if we can hold our
end of the court, we'll come out
on the long end."
In yesterday's practice session at- ;
tention was given to smoothing out .
plays that looked ragged in the Gael
frosh tilt Saturday. Bradshaw |
stressed follow shots.
The Cubs, after a week-end of
victories, received a set-back
Tuesday night when San Fran
cisco J.C. trimmed them 46-38.
The visitors' tentative line-up is
Bob Chalmers at center, "Red"
Snyder and Dick David, forwards,
and Lew Goldenson and Bill
Garretson, guards.
The regular Papoose quintet will
start tonight's fray, which will open
the season's three-game series with i
the Cubs. Dick Neeley's ankle has
| mended sufficiently for him to start
with Pete McArthur at the guard
â–  positions. Phil Zonne will hold pivot
| post, and Jack Kessel and Lyman
i Calkins will hold down the forward
j berths.
