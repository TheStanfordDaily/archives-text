### 
Gym: <S p.m., Chi Psi vs. Theta
Chi I (only game scheduled).
Delta Upsilon looms as a threat I
for League 111 honors after a 40-15
win over Los Arcos. Zamloch was |
hitting the hoop regularly and tal- ,
lied 16 points for the winners. Zeta ■
Psi also seems to be rounding into
a winning team, and showed spots
of clever floor play. Alpha Delt is
still undefeated in League IV, but |

they have still to meet Delta Chi, a
powerhouse.
