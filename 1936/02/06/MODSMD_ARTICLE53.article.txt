## "Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" Member of the Associated Press Humorous Idea of Taking Ex Committee Seriously Brings a Forum Tonight 
### 
For many years now, Ex Committee lias been
I lie butt of the collective wit of self-styled cam
pus humorists. Quad, Chappy, and Daily at
one time or another have all tweaked the legis
lative nose.
Hut two weeks ago, one of the campus hu
morists had one of the funniest ideas of all,
which was to take Ex Committee seriously.
From somewhere he got the idea that Ex Com
mittee should be reorganized along "function
al" lines, that experts selected from the various
activities groups should be chosen to sit around
the oval table.
Tonight, following the election circus when
candidates give their platforms, a forum will
be held on the proposed change. It can be left
for the meeting to decide for itself if it wishes
to juggle its Ex Committee representation into
a commission form of government, a form that
has been fading out in American local govern
ment, yielding to the city manager plan. The
present Ex Committee set-up, with its policy
deciding amateurs and its student manager, is
most like the latter plan.

However, any such juggling will not ailed
the student government problem at Stanford.
It is doubtful if the proposed changes do any
more than fan a few ilames of student interest.
Except for the proposed plan, there has been
no concerted criticism in past years of either
Ex Committee or its system.
Mr. Creamer, the serious humorist who has
started all this, savs: "Ex Committees of the
past have combined ability with power only
through coincidence." True. Considering the
haphazard nominating and electing process
that Stanford experiences twice yearly, it is
more than a coincidence —it is a miracle.
Therefore, let those who desire a golden era
of Stanford politics wait until there are major
issues to be decided. Only in the excitement of
a contlict between factions or parties will there
be enough interest exhibited by students to
raise the morale of elections and nominations.
Until then, Ex Committee will probably be
allowed to go its way in peace, calmly deciding
its trivialities with wit and rare good humor
excelled by no parliamentary body anywhere.
