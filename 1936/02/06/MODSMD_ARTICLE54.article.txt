# Simple Requests of Women Sponsors Should Be Heeded
## 
### 
The movement to give compensation to
women sponsors, which rolled forward slowly
early last quarter but became despairingly in
ert in later months, is gathering momentum
again. And this time the sponsors themselves
are taking action, in a mild sort of way.
Apparently agreed among themselves that
the guardians of Stanford's freshmen women
deserve some consideration for their time and
effort, Koblc sponsors have drafted a set of
recommendations regarding proportional com
pensation which will soon be submitted to
the Women's Conference and the Dean of
Women's office.
No waiving of room rent is asked. All the
sponsors want is the right to have a limited
number of dining hall guests per quarter, ex
emption from Koble Club dues, and free ad
mission to Koblc Club social functions. Sug
gestion is made that the cost of all this—and
it's hard to see that costs of any consequence
will be involved—be paid either by Koble Club,
the Women's Conference, or the two groups
together.
Koble Club, naturally, should pay for these
compensations which really seem more like
courtesies than any kind of reimbursement.
We will be mightily surprised if any howl
whatsoever is raised when these recommenda
tions, which seem only fair, arc submitted.
