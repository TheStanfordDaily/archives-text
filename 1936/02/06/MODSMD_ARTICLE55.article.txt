# Honor System Cracks Up In North Carolina Stronghold
## 
### 
Seventy University of North Carolina stu
dents, including six Phi Betes and several stu
dent body ofliccrs and football players, re
gretted the day they decided to cheat their way
through college last week.
They left college in a mass bouncing to the
tune of ignominy in the form of nation-wide
publicity. They had violated the honor code
in an almost unbelievably gross manner. One
student had copied keys to university oflices,
and stolen examinations. He sold copies of
the exams to at least se\enty students, and

conducted a highly profitable trade until he
was exposed by a student committee.
The South, as we remember it, is not made
up of an inferior race of people, and it's com
pletely impossible to imagine how so many
young Southern gentlemen and ladies could
fall for a scheme at once dishonest and dan
gerous. The expose and expulsions must have
dealt a disillusioning blow to those who had
faith in what was probably thought to be a
highly successful "honor code system."
One wonders what Stanford students would
do if someone offered to sell them copies of
exams along about 12 o'clock on the night
before finals.
