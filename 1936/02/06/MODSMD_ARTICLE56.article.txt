## RHYTHM IN THEIR LECTURES 
### 
We could learn stuff every day . . . Knock down B's
and lots more A's . . . And the scholastic standard we
would raise ... If the profs had rhythm in the guff
they sling.

If that parody isn't so putrid it decomposes the
paper, it will stand as a truism—allegorical mon
strosity though it is. Obviously we could leain more
in lectures — even ccon lectures—if the professors
could spread on some figurative salt and pepper and
A-l—anything to counteract the natural spinachy
taste of them.

So loud have been the bleatings about dull classes
that they have resounded out and grated on the cars
of certain alumni. Forthwith they put this question,
among others, to President Wilbur: "Is the report of
many students that their classes are dull, uninteresting,
and uninspired justified?" And Dr. Wilbur answered:
'There are bound to be teachers who are uninspiring,
and classes that are uninteresting."
* * * *
Now that the alumni have had their chance, we
would like to ask Dr. Wilbur these questions: Why
are we hound to have dullness in the classroom? When
certain professors are known to be habitually unin
spiring and dreary of speech, why can't something
be done about it? Does anyone doubt that poorly pre
sented lectures and material is a detriment to the
object of putting a teachcr's knowledge into the minds
of students?

If a journalist can't present his facts clearly and
in a manner that invites reading, someone gets him off
in a corner and gives him a talking to. And if he
doesn't improve, his services usually arc no longer re
quired. The same might well apply to a college faculty.
No subject cannot be made interesting. Most sub
jects can be made entertaining. And most professors
really have the intelligence to do more than drone dry
as salt facts and figures at ears attuned to rhythmic
music and fast-moving conversation.

The professors have an unfair advantage. The stu
dents have to come and listen to them. But what
would happen if the drawing power of lectures was de
pendent entirely on the lecturer's ability to present
information in popularized, entertaining, and easily
understood terms? The students, as the saying goes,
would stay away by the hundreds.
