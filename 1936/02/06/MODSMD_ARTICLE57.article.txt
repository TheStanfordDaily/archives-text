Several instances of the breakdown of the great
Stanford dating system have come to light, justifying
all the ill winds that have been blowing off in the
campus opinion column recently. What farce!
First instance is of a Chi Psi, who called up a
Robleite and asked her in true democratic fashion to
witness a show in Paly. She accepted the invitation.
Though the present Campus Opinion trend seems
toward busses and milkshakes, this dater took his own
car.
When they arrived in front of the picture play
house, the Robleite decided she didn't like the show.
This made the Chi Psi a teensy weensy bit wroth and
he said harsh words.
The Robleite said, "Well, you can go in and see it
by yourself if you want to, and see if I care."
He did.
And she didn't care.
The Rally Committee got together and decided to
throw a big party last week-end; so one of the El Toro
dance committee chairmen went about getting a blind
date. Upon the recommendation of half of Toyon
Hall and the Rally Committee, he decided to ask a
certain highly favored blonde in Oaks. Acornly, he
called up a friend at that establishment and put in his
requisition. When the night came around, he called
for his Okey-doke, and was surprised to find that his
date was a well favored brunette—the blonde by the
same name had moved out to Mariposa last quarter.
He couldn't place the face, but the name was
familiar.
Quite a stir was created recently at the Alpha Delt
house, which some claim is nothing more than a stir,
anyhow, when the house manager received a billet—
coux (or dillel-boux, or disestablishmentarianism)
from the small hamletsburg of Watsonville, expressing
quite a bit of devotion and an amount of sorrow that
she had been unable to dance the last dance with him.
Since he had never been to that town he suspected a
hoax and communicated speedily with a brother who
hailed from that hamletsburg, and asked about the
Alice Shaw who had written him.
The hail fellow said that the only people with that
name in Watsonville were Chinese. A bit perturbed,
the manager summoned the P.O. department, who took
a closer examination of the envelope, discovered that
the blurred name had misled them, rerouted it to the
Chinese Club.
