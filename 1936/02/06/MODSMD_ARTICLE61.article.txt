# SUSAN S GENUINE PROBLEM
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
We would like to see this column j
1 made a constructive and useful j
force in campus problems, and not a
; second "Our Hasher Sez." More in- I
; telligent responses to questions sig
i nificant to this University would aid
! greatly. In an effort to establish this
; idea, we suggest that campus opin
ions should reflect the attitude of the
\ campus and refrain from being
I merely an "undercover date agency."
We believe, however, that Susan's
I numerous comments of the past
| week centered around a genuine
! problem and are worthy of further
I discussion. Unfortunately, the re
! sponses of the past week were of a
flippant and unconstructive nature.
| ... Use this column for a round
| table discussion.
