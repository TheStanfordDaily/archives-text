# A 						PROTEST
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Speaking for the "forgotten men"
! of the Class of 1938, we raise our
i voice in protest against the policies
of our executive. It has been his
! wont to eliminate almost completely
hall men from the activities of the
j class.
The committee of ten in charge
of the Sophomore Cotillion, with one
j exception, was composed entirely of
i Row representatives. Out of a group
! of 28 planning the Sophomore Carni
| val, Denisons of Lasuen will oc
j cupy 23 positions.
The only inference that can be de
i rived from this state of affairs is j
that our honored president is a firm
believer in Jacksonian Democracy.
However, we, his disenfranchised '
former supporters, believe that this
I is not the type of democracy indica
tive of the true Stanford spirit.
We suggest that if our leader has
| any further political aspirations, he
j adopt a more democratic policy in j
| the future conduct of the affairs of .
| the Class of '38.
