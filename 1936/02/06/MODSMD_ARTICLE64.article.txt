# BORROWER PLEASE RETURN

### 
The Editor, Sir:
On Tuesday afternoon my grey
overcoat was removed from the
; downstairs south hall of the library |
: building while I was at work in the j
Hoover War Library. Though I
j have hesitated to reveal my faith in !
! campus human nature, at the pros
ent proved groundless, I think a
warning should be given to other 1
j trusting souls who leave unguarded
| hats and coats in the library halls.
For the sake of Ihe good name of
Stanford students I hope that some
| outsider now possesses my coat. If

not, let me suggest that the present
owner might return the garment to
the libraryâ€”of course, only after it
warms up and he has no further !
need of it.
