## ENGLISH SATIRISTS 
### 
The two most prominent English
playwrights of today are unques
tionably G. Bernard Shaw and Noel
Coward. Both have a faint glim
mer of the smart Alec in the aura
of their respective haloes. Per
sonally they are just two talented
men, one young, one old, both
charming, humble, unassuming.
The day after the opening of "To
night at 8:30" the Evening Standai'd
mentioned that there had been a
display of five personalities in Noel
Coward—and still one missing. He
had shown himself as an actor, pro
ducer, playwright, dancer, and com
poser—but the dramatist was miss
ing. He was still the young man to
whom satire came too easily.
Consequently it was with some
anxiety that I walked backstage at
the Phoenix to meet this celebrated
Man of the Theater. But when I saw
him I knew my preconceived idea
had been wrong, far wrong.
I almost shook hands with him; he
was faster than I; I caught only one
finger, luckily. He explained. In an
all too Cowardian setting he had
spent the Christmas season in Scan
dinavia. The Prince, at whose cha
teau he was a guest, decided to play
hide and seek. There was nothing to
do but play hide and seek.
Running down a corridor, chased
by the instigator, Coward clutched
at a door in a wild dash for cover —
and in so doing injured his right
forefinger. To make a long story
short, Sweden shook, the ladies

fainted, Coward bled and hummed
a tune in a trembly tone while the
damaged finger was repaired.
It seems difficult to believe that
the man who played "The Scoun
drel" so convincingly could be so
refreshingly real to know. As with
any genuine artist, work occupies
his central interest. It seems to sur
round him while he speaks of other
people and irrelevent subjects. Any
one of less genius would have be
come submerged in the social swirl,
only to have become a subject of
satire, a jaded sophisticate, a Cow
ardian drawing room hero. Cow
ard is not Cowardian. This man is a
charming writer of satire who has
fooled many people with his draw
ing room comedies. —Balzer

(Tomorrow: George Bernard Shaw)
The two most prominent English
playwrights of today are unques
tionably G. Bernard Shaw and Noel
Coward. Both have a faint glim
mer of the smart Alec in the aura
of their respective haloes. Per
sonally they are just two talented
men, one young, one old, both
charming, humble, unassuming.
The day after the opening of "To
night at 8:30" the Evening Standai'd
mentioned that there had been a
display of five personalities in Noel
Coward—and still one missing. He
had shown himself as an actor, pro
ducer, playwright, dancer, and com
poser—but the dramatist was miss
ing. He was still the young man to
whom satire came too easily.
Consequently it was with some
anxiety that I walked backstage at
the Phoenix to meet this celebrated
Man of the Theater. But when I saw
him I knew my preconceived idea
had been wrong, far wrong.
I almost shook hands with him; he
was faster than I; I caught only one
finger, luckily. He explained. In an
all too Cowardian setting he had
spent the Christmas season in Scan
dinavia. The Prince, at whose cha
teau he was a guest, decided to play
hide and seek. There was nothing to
do but play hide and seek.
Running down a corridor, chased
by the instigator, Coward clutched
at a door in a wild dash for cover —
and in so doing injured his right
forefinger. To make a long story
short, Sweden shook, the ladies

fainted, Coward bled and hummed
a tune in a trembly tone while the
damaged finger was repaired.
It seems difficult to believe that
the man who played "The Scoun
drel" so convincingly could be so
refreshingly real to know. As with
any genuine artist, work occupies
his central interest. It seems to sur
round him while he speaks of other
people and irrelevent subjects. Any
one of less genius would have be
come submerged in the social swirl,
only to have become a subject of
satire, a jaded sophisticate, a Cow
ardian drawing room hero. Cow
ard is not Cowardian. This man is a
charming writer of satire who has
fooled many people with his draw
ing room comedies. —Balzer
