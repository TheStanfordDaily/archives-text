"INSIDE EUROPE," by John Gun
ther. (Harpers.)
At least a score of books are pub- j
j lished today. Choosing John Gun-
I ther's "Inside Europe" for mention
j is intended as a compliment, there
j fore. But not quite on the ob
vious grounds.
Whatever the publisher may say,
the book is not profound. We sus
i pect Mr. Gunther, who is a big,
| rather earnest, youngish man, does- j
n't want to be profound. He is a J
j newspaper man and it is his busi- j
\ ness to be informative. He has
j stuffed '"Inside Europe" with facts I
about Hitler, Mussolini, Baldwin,
j Laval, Stalin, Eden, Masaryk, [
Benes—all the big ones.
But what distinguishes his book j
'is not its scope nor its conclusions
(which are sparse). It is that Mr.
Gunther is a very good example of
| a new sort of reporter. He writes
j the facts as he sees them, without
fear, without bias and with only one
■ technical consideration in mind.
This is to arrange his material so
that it holds the reader, as well as '
catches his attention in the first
j place.
There is an almost overwhelming
amount of information in the book.
I The discussion of Hitler is the best
in recent months (why won't the
anti-Hitler propagandists content
themselves with the devastating
truth?) The discussion of Musso- j
lini lacks George Seldes' venom, ,
! and is better. The section on Bald
j win is extraordinarily acute. The J
armament tangle is aburdly com- j
, plex; Mr. Gunther does the best he J
can with it, and probably has not j
j got to the bottom of it any more than
! Neumann did in his recent book on !
Zaharoff.
We do not mean to say that be- j
cause Gunther is temperate, he is j
also tepid. He probably will be
I spanked publicly when, and if, the
' Nazi goblins read what he has writ
! ten of the Reichstag fire. But this"
department is sick of unsubtle prop- I
aganda, and found "Inside Europe" i
a good antidote. An occasional fac- j
j tual slip is better than a book filled i
1 with deliberate lies, certainly.

Benes—all the big ones.
But what distinguishes his book j
'is not its scope nor its conclusions
(which are sparse). It is that Mr.

fear, without bias and with only one
