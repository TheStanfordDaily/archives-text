# Bob Finds 'Real' Susan Among Many
## 
### 
There were too many Susans at
the jolly-up last night.
Not one, but dozens and dozens
of likely Lagunitans tagged
"Susan" met curious males when
they stormed Old Roble Gym. The
real Susan evidently believed
there was safety in numbers.
Bob ELsenbach, the Bull Ses
sioner who started the whole Su
san mess, was in the dark, too—
well, almost. Nobody actually told
him that Ann Ritchie, is "Susan,"
but he's pretty sure. At dinner
over at they sal him
next to Ann and then giggled.
Anyway, he says she'll do.
In case Ann, or Susan, doesn't
know it, they got a flashlight snap
of her dancing with Bob. Then
Bob took her home.
