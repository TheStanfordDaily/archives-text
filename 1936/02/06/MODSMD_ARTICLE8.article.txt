# Roughs Smirk At Frank Play
## 'What Price Glory?' Shocks Farm Audience 
### Bob Bernhard 
Presenting the Ancbrson-Stallings
bawdy masterpiece, "What Price
Glory?" to a sizeable audience, the
Sword and Sandals presentation was
well received. Particularly good
were George Wood as Cognac Pete,
Mac Gordon as Corporal Kiper, and
Art Spaulding as Lieutenant Aid
rich.
Rosemary Benet was surprisingly
competent in a role, that of Char
maine, the flirtatious and vivacious
charmer, obviously unsuited to her
talents. Bob Garred as Sergeant
Quirt was disappointing and Dick
Dawson as Corporal Lipinsky never
succeeded in making his dialect
genuine. Paul Crary, as Captain
Flagg, handled a hard role well, al
though at no point did he secure
the full effect possible to the part.
As Ihe play was not censored, the
audience was shocked by the lan
guage used and laughed uproariously
at every sally in order to cover its
embarrassment.
"What Price Glory?", the tale of
a two-man feud with a World War
setting, is too vivid a production to
realize its possibilities in a i*eading.
But Fred Clark directed an ade
quate version.
