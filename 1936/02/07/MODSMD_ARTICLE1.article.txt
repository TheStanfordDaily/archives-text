## Moore Appoints Luisetti As Acting Captain For Tonight's Southern Tilt 
### 
With a note of optimism in his
predictions for the week-end games
with U.C.L.A., John Bunn entrained
last night for the south with 12 of
his varsity basketball players.
"The St. Mary's game was the
turning point and I feel the team
is on the upward trend. The hoys'
mental attitude is perfect and we
should not lose another game."
These were Coach Bunn's words
and struck a different tune to the
ears of (hose who, after the Cali
fornia defeat, viewed the future
. for the Indian team with pessi
mism.
The crippled U.C.L.A. team which
faced the Trojans will again be in
tact for the Stanford series with the

exception of Orv Appleby, forward,
who will be replaced by Bill Rob
inson or Alex Widlicska.
John Ball, held in check by
Troy last week, will attempt to
bring up his scoring average.
Memories of the second Card-
Bruin game in which Ball scored
21 points should be incentive
enough for the Indians to guard
the lanky center.
Every member of the Cardinal
invaders is in fine shape with the
exception of Bill Quade, who has a
slight cold. Art Stoefen will start at
center. Howell Turner and "Hank"
Luisetti will assume their usual
forward berths while Jack Calder
wood and Bob Zonne get the call
over "Dinty" Moore and "Sparky"
Robertson. Besides the above
named, Bill Quade, Ken Nobs,
"Nellie" Heath, Howard Paine, and
Ken Bell will make ihe trip.
