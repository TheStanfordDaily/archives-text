# No Decision Given In Panel Discussion
## 
### 
An audience of 20 persons last'
night heard a panel of seven discuss 1
the pros and cons of the proposed
constitutional amendment providing
for a "functional" Ex Committee,
and came to no conclusion what
soever.
Main point for the new plan, as i
expounded by its originator, Dick
Creamer, is that it would provide
more able men and women on the
committee than under the present
system, and that ability is more
important than representation of the
electorate.
To the argument that the new sys
tem would be undemocratic, Crea
mer replied, "There is no reason
for maintaining an inefficient de
mocracy."
Opponents of the plan claimed

that log-rolling would be prevalent,
that all members would be seniors,
with no carry-overs from previous
years as at present, and that repre
sentation would not be even.
In the audience were but three of
the candidates for winter election,
and but three of the present Ex
Committee.
