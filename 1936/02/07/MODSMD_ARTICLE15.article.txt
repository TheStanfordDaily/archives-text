# Magazine Racks in Cellar Withdrawn
## 
### 
The honor code may work on ex
aminations but it doesn't work on
! magazines. That's apparently the
| basic reason why Professor E. P.
Leslie, Bookstore manager, with
; drew the magazine racks from the
Union Cellar.
His figures, and ihosc of the
Stanford Union OHicc, showed
J that the Bookstore was operat
ing the auxiliary service at a 2
I per cent loss because .'5O per cent
of the magazines were either un
consciously or consciously filched
I by literary-minded students.
"A 5 per cent loss is usual on
: magazine racks all over the United
j States," he revealed, "resulting npt
mindedness on the part of readers,
so much from theft as from absent
! who walk out with the book un
! thinkingly. A 30 per cent loss is
j another matter, attributable, statis-
I tics show, only to premeditated and
j conscious theft."
The lending library, an adjunct
j of the magazine service, was dis
continued at the beginning of the
quarter because $2ft of hooks was
J stolen during the previous school
| month, Dr. Leslie revealed.
A suggestion to the Union to carry
! the rack independent of the Book
| store was refused, Miss Christine
j Ricker, dormitory dining room
j manager, revealed.
The magazine rack, together with
| the circulating library, will hence
i forth operate only in the Bookstore.
