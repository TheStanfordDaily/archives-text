# Storey Advises Care of Colds
## Students Asked To Use Precaution against Flu 
### 
Suggestion that all students with
colds report to the health service
without unreasonable delay was
made yesterday by Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, as a means of preventing
lurther spread of influenza on the
campus.
Dr. Storey, chairman of the fac
ulty Committee on Public Health,
said that, although the number of
cases of mild influenza is slowly
increasing, there is at present no
cause for alarm. Nevertheless, it
is safer to get early medical ad
vice from the very competent
staffs of the Men and Women Stu
dents' Health Services than to
take a chance.
In conclusion, Dr. Storey advised
ticular efforts be made to keep dry
against swimming or boating on
Laguanita, and suggested that par
and warm. And above all, visits
to friends confined in the hospital
should be avoided, for "they will
get along better without you, and
you will get along better without
'catching' their colds."
