# Ballet Company To Perform in Pavilion Tonight
## Comic Episodes From Modern Society To Be Enacted in Pantomime 
### 
"For Sale—Bridal Gown; Never
Worn." A series of tragi-comedy
episodes will be presented before a
Stanford audience this evening
when Trudi Schoop and her famous
troupe appears in the Pavilion at
8:20 o'clock.
Other "Wants Ads," portrayed
by the Swiss comedienne will bo
"Honorable Lady, in Middle
Fifties, Seeks Acquaintance; Ob
ject Matrimony," and "Through
Unforeseen Circumstances — For
eign Language Secretary, Speak
ing Four Languages, Seeks Situa
tion, Preferably Aboard."
These farces are tied in with
American jazz and are also closely
related to Walt Disney's animated
cartoons, being done wholly in pan
tomime and with only the sketchiest
of costuming and scenery. Assisting
the youthful artiste are her two
brothers, one of whom designs her
costumes and the other writes her
music.
Second on her program will be
"Fridolin on the Road"—the meta
morphosis of callow-youth-in-to
gay-deceiver, exposing the little
foibles of contemporary life in mov
ing caricature.
In this comedy, Trudi Schoop is
"Fridolin," who, broken-hearted,
takes leave of his mother to see
the world. And he sees it. The
boy travels through underworld
and society; he falls in love, and
marries, and falls in love. Finally
he leaves both of them with high
hopes for the future.
Tickets for the ballet are avail
able at Kecble's in Palo Alto, or at
the Concert Series Office on the
campus. Manager Naomi Caipenter
asks that all lost tickets be reported
to the Concert Series Office before
the performance.
