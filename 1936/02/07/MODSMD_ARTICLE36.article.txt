# New Index of Popular Songs Invented by Stanford Student

### Dave Botsford 
An ingenious card index of popu- ;
lar songs brings Dave Swanberg,
Branner sophomore, plenty of plea
sure these days. But there's a lot
back of his "song catalogue" that
the average person doesn't know.
He started the son? system inno
cently enough last year in Encina. !
He and his room-mates jotted j
a few of the "best songs". In
time, however, Dave had a note
book full of the most-played hits
of the last decade.
He soon developed a "key" so he'd
remember the tune, and he included
the shows where the songs started. 1
Then last Christmas he transferred
his list to cards, a separate card I

for each song. He now has over 800
songs in alphabetical order. "I don't
intend it to be so absolutely com
plete," says Dave. "Just the best
ones."
Since he was 3 years old, David
Erwin Swanberg has had something
of an out-of-the-ordinary mind. At
the advanced age of 3 he had a
unique mental disease which might
be called "street-car-phobia." He
was crazy, completely nuts, about
street cars. Every Saturday he
would cry and cry, and the only
way Mamma and Papa Swanberg
could stop him would be to drive
him all over town following street
car lines. He Was expert then, with

special names, like "von von" and
"tota tota tota," for the different
types of street cars. He thinks of
them even now, but not with such
fervor.
Still only 3, this precocious
youngster could tell practically
everybody the day of the week
they were born. You'd just have
to tell him the date and the year,
and just like that he'd say "Mon
day," or wliatever it was. He'd
be right, too.
At 14, Dave was planning citiesâ€”
his own, special cities. On a large
sheet of butcher's paper, he'd mark
off rivers and streets and houses.
Then he'd invent telephone ex
changes and give every house a
telephone. He's grown out of that
pastime now, he says.
