# 'I Am Not Karpis, Nor Susan' --Ritchie
## 
### 
In yesterday's Daily an article '
appeared asserting that Boh Eisen
bach had at last found Susan. It
was disclosed that the "mysterious
woman'' was none other than
Anne Kitchie. Last night Miss
Ritchie gave The Daily the fid
lowing vehement denial.
I have been victimized by the
press. I am not Shirley Temple,
Alvin Karpis, the Missing Marx
! brother, or Susan.
1 do not know who Susan is, nor
do I care. All I know is that I am |
not she, nor would I care to be.
I do not write anonymous let
ters. I have never been (o Ober
lin where all the hoys and girls
absorb charm and social grace j
with their grub. I have never j
been to West Point to glide with !
: military Astaires. And I would do
j the double-shuffle-and-lurch with i
a Stanford man any evening rather ■
, than be gored by thousands of \
uniform buttons.
I am not a social reformer. I
don t care whether Stanford women |
sit at home and bite their nails or j
go out and bite their escorts. I am i
against Charm in any form. I look j
like an adolescent wolf-hound by i
native endowment, and I act like !

one by choice. When approached by
charmers of either sex. I bark and
race ofT in all possible directions.
The only people I care to know
are irrelevant fools whose chief
amusement in life is to get into
corners and scream with laugh
ter at the '•ight of saccharine imi
tations of Charm.
If the swivel-hipped gals want to
play games of eye-lash batting, coy
smiles, and drop-the-handkerchief,
that's all right with me. Only if I
were the man, I'd step on their
hands. At the moment I'm busy
getting both feet ready for Susan
and Mr. Eisenbac'n.

absorb charm and social grace j
with their grub. I have never j

a Stanford man any evening rather ■

uniform buttons.
I am not a social reformer. I
don t care whether Stanford women |
sit at home and bite their nails or j
go out and bite their escorts. I am i
against Charm in any form. I look j
like an adolescent wolf-hound by i
native endowment, and I act like !

one by choice. When approached by
charmers of either sex. I bark and
race ofT in all possible directions.
The only people I care to know
are irrelevant fools whose chief
amusement in life is to get into
corners and scream with laugh

tations of Charm.
If the swivel-hipped gals want to
play games of eye-lash batting, coy
smiles, and drop-the-handkerchief,
that's all right with me. Only if I
were the man, I'd step on their
hands. At the moment I'm busy
getting both feet ready for Susan
and Mr. Eisenbac'n.

appeared asserting that Boh Eisen
bach had at last found Susan. It
was disclosed that the "mysterious
woman'' was none other than
Anne Kitchie. Last night Miss
Ritchie gave The Daily the fid
lowing vehement denial.
I have been victimized by the
press. I am not Shirley Temple,
Alvin Karpis, the Missing Marx
! brother, or Susan.
1 do not know who Susan is, nor
do I care. All I know is that I am |
not she, nor would I care to be.
