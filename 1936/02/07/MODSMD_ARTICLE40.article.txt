o'clock wilh the Olympic Club mer
men as opponents.

attempt to shatter official records in
the 50-meter and 50-yard breast
stroke events, wilh qualified timers
on hand. A.A.U. has given its sanc
tion and is recognizing the eight
timers.
Stanford's varsity is taking on no
mean aggregation in its first meet.
The Winged "O" outfit "pledged"
practically the entire Golden Gate
Jaysee team, which last season
cleaned up on everything in sight.
The best men in San Francisco will
be with the clubmen.
Although Coach Nort Thorn
lon fails to see how his charges
can win, the Stanford team as it
now stands is far stronger than
last year's.
Jack Vibert will try an "iron
man" role, swimming both 100 and
220 free-style events. One of the
features of the day will be his tangle
with Dick Keating, the Pacific As
sociation champ and the city press'
choice for an Olympic berth.

this part of the state will splash
it up in the 50-yard free style.
Herb Brotiuan, Senior P.A. champ,
and Henry Godman, Junior P.A.
champ wiN settle an old score.
Jack England, of the club, and
Bill Lhamon, of the Indians, round
out the quartet of speedsters.
If Bob Walker passes a make-tip
ex in Poli Sci to overcome an in
complete, the 150-yard backstroke
will be a strongly Cardinal event.
The 400-yard relay is expected to
be on the Red side of (tie ledger also.

Rider and Peterson will try to cut
! down the Club's points in the quar
l ter-mile, and Mel Jacoby is the lone
i Indian entry in the breast-stroke for
200 yards. Diver Tom Boothe will
match form with Ed Gregg of the
J clubbers.
Indian hopes for a victory de-
I pend largely on whether Brotman

both. Scatena and Kuhn will try
to do the trick in the century,
j Ted Wiget, thrice N.C.A.A. mid
| die distance king when he attended
