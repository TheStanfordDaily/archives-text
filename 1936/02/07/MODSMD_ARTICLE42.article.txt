## Indian Cagers Not Stopped, Say Charts 
### 
By Phil Duffy
Any pessimism resulting from the |
reading of Roy Cummings' story in
the Call-Bulletin this week on how
California "bottled up" Luisetti and
"confused" ihe Stanford team, may j
be dispelled by a short talk with
Coach John Bunn.
Bunr. says the team was not "con
fused" nor was Luisetti "bottled
up.!' And furthermore, he has fig
ures to prove it.
Charts of each game arc kept
by managers and many of the
things which the sports writers
claim to be true fall to pieces |
when these charts are consulted. I
In the case of Luisetti being
"bottled up" in the second Bear
game, the charts show (hat he
took exactly the same number of
shots (20) as he did in the lirst
Cal game.
The charts also show that his shots
were taken from almost the same
position on the floor, indicating the
Bears knew where he was shooting 1
from, but evidently couldn't do any- j
thing about it. If Cummings wants '
a good example of a man being
"bottled up" he should look at the j
charts of the Indian-Trojan games j
and he will find that Ward Brown
ing, who took as high as 15 shots in I
the first half was held to no shots in j
the second half of one game and to
three .' hots in the other.
The Call's story went on to say
that Nibs Price had devised a sys
tem whereby he stopped the In- J
dian offense. His system of de
fense is no different from that of
any other coach, and if the Stan
ford offense was stopped it was
because the Indians themselves
were dogging it. They proved the
fact in the closing minutes of the ;
game when they returned to their
aggressive style of play.
Recalling the two California:
games, one remembers the difficulty '
the Bears had in penetrating the In
dian defense. Time again they were
stopped cold and spent precious
minutes in passing the ball "around 1
the horn" in what people booed as
a stalling game, but m reality was
due to the inability or California to
find an opening in a tight Stanford
defense.
To Mr. Cummings, sports editor
of the Call, and to the Californian
who said it would be a "hard winter"
on the Farm this writer says: "You
ain't seen nothing yet."
