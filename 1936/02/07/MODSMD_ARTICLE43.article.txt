YOU CAN FIGURE
CARDS LEAD LOOP
At the present half-way mark,
John Bunn's tall basketball team
stands as the best five in the circuit.
This end is arrived at quite nicely
by glancing at the statistics and
mixing in a little gray-matter acro
batics.
On paper, the bare, cold figures
show that the Cards are tied wilh
the Trojans for the league lead.
Both teams have won four, lost two
tilts.
But the crimson-scantied Cards
still rank a peg or so higher than the
Trojans, for they have shown that:
(1) They can beat any of the other
three teams in the loop even when
they're only reasonably hot, and
(2) they beat the Trojans two nights
running.
The term "reasonably hot" is a
vital one with the Cards. It does not
include, for instance, the Cal game
a week ago tonight at the Berkeley
Jinx Pavilion, which saw the locals
watching a slow-moving Bear five
walk off with the verdict, and real
izing they couldn't do anything
about it.
The term does include, however,
the following night's game, which
saw Luisetti and Stoefen amass 43
whirlwind points between them, fed
by the effective passing of team
men Turner, Zonne, and Calder
wood.
So tonight they will be down in
Westwood, a suburb of Los An
geles, playing Ucla, a team they have
beaten and lost to, favored to win
and hoping they can make a "hot"
night of it.
At the same time, the Sam Barry
and Nibs Price quintets will be
struggling in Berkeley. Troy trim
med the Bears twice, at the tail
end of the Bear barnstorming trip
early last month. There will be two
good games.
