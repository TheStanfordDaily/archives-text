These farewell edits have been written for
years now. I'm getting tired of them. So are
you. So's the rest of the campus.
I experimented, learned a lot, and had a
..{reat time editing the Daily this volume. It's
rather useless to try to tell you how to run the
paper—you've got ideas yourself on that or
you wouldn't have been elected.
If there is any advice, however, that you
might seek, I shall he glad to give it to you
personally.
You'll do what you want anyhow, so take
it away.
Good luck,
