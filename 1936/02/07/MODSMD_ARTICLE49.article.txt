## 
### 
The honor code, in one of its subsidiary
forms, reared up and looked ugly yesterday.
They took the magazine rack out of the Union
Cellar because students were stealing—yes,
Stanford students were stealing !."> per cent
of the magazines displayed for sale.
The rental book stand was taken out of the
Cellar last year because books were disap
pearing. That was disheartening to the Hook
store which owned the concession, because
they figured students ought to read some
thing, even though it be light fiction. So they
moved the magazine rack over under the
watchful eye of the cigar stand man in an
attempt to salvage something out of the
wreck of dishonesty.
Hut now the Bookstore managers are thor
oughly disillusioned about trusting anybody.
A few missing magazines could be charged
up to profit and loss, but when 15 per cent of
them vanished and the rack started to lose
money, that was the end. Now magazines are
011 sale in the carefully patrolled isles of the
Bookstore itself, and at no other place on the
campus.
When they changed the color of the blue
books to yellow, it gave the honor code a
black eye. This magazine stealing blackens
the other eye. We can only hope that nothing
will happen which will break the beaten
thing's neck.
