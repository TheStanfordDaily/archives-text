One of the small complaints lodged by the
outgoing volume of the Daily was that against
the small hit of road I hat connects Palm Drive
with the Chemistry Building. Bumpy, wavy,
rough, il was one of the worst spots on a cam
pus of none-too-line surfaces.
Gratifying indeed is the word from the
ollice of ever-cooperative Comptroller Al Both
lo the elTect that the stretch of road com
plained of is in for early leveling and sur
facing.
When summer conies, heavy road-building

equipment will be on campus for construc
tion near the new Memorial Hall. Then the
small strip by the Chem Building will be taken
care of.
Students can then drive along—sanely of
course—over a non-bumpy road. Visitors, too,
can be thankful to the Administration for
complying with the Daily's request.
