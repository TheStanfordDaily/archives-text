## WAITING FOR THE ROBERT E. LEE 
### 
Stanford co-eds have a kick coming. Some of us
only think so, but we who attended the "Susan" jolly
up Wednesday know so.
For the first time, we gained a conception of what
womankind is up against and what the ladies must do
to survive in a world designed for mab initiative and
male achievement.
The gals did the asking, just as a social experiment
mind you, and put Stanford's pampered and glorified
roughs into the position of Stanford's not so glorified
maids for a half hour.

It wasn't fun, I can tell you. To be strangely con
scious that maybe your hair wasn't combed, that you
needed a shave, that perhaps the gals didn't ask for a
dance because someone dubbed you a lemon, was a
new and highly unpleasant sensation. Greater than
this sudden realization of actual or imagined short
comings was the feeling of helplessness under insuper
able social mores—the same mores, may we point out,
that co-eds face all the time, with a remarkable
minimum of grousing.
The short period of reverse social English demon
strated lhat not only is it "no fun to be a girl," but
that women are nobler animals than we self-appointed
Kings of the Earth had suspected.

Blasted before our very eyes was the pleasant illu
sion that only to the female is romance a physiological
and psychological necessity. Beneath our pose of our
"isn't this a hell of an idea," we realized lhat the mighty
male is not immune to the social aspects of sex.
It was a new and revealing experience waiting at
the sidelines for our ships to come in, throw us a line,
and tow us out of port.
We were powerless, and we found that our social
domination was not innate, but merely ihe product of
forces that v- had reserved to ourselves.
For a libei..l education, we thank you.
