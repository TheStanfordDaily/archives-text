# After All, Students Do Study at Mid-Terms
## 
### 
Fifty people out of a possible 4,000 attended
last night's political rally. The candidates
running for olliee in Tuesday's mid-year elec
tion presented their comprehensive programs
to the other candidates and those who came
to applaud. After the candidates and the clap
pers left, 15 hardy souls stuck around to
discuss the vital change proposed for our stu
dent government.
These figures might be cited by our cynics
as an indication that there is student apathy
toward student government. But these con
clusions are unduly harsh.
Many students are going through the an
nua! throes of mid-terms, and while the Little
Theater was the desolate and forlorn host
to Stanford's group of individualists, the Li
brary was doing business as usual. The plain
fact, if anyone cares to face it, is that after all
these long, lean years, people are coining to
Stanford to study.
