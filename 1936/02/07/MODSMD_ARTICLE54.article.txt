# $150 â€” Big Price For Lone Debate
## 
### 
Bob Gros' action in protesting an expendi
ture of $150 tor a debate "tour" which would
include one lone debate is to be commended
considering the fact that he is an ex-debate
mafiager and has every reason to be partial.
What was in debate coach Lee Chapin's
mind when he figured such a sum was justi
fied for a Canadian trip to hold just one meet
is, to put it mildly, impossible to imagine.
And why Hie debate ollicials can't schedule
more meetings for the team up in the North
west is equally hard to understand. We are
glad to hear, moreover, that the money will
not be granted unless more debates are ar
ranged for the Northwest tour.
