When the government issues promises to pay
without dough to back it up, evei'ybody calls it infla
tion, dances around in glee, and votes the straight
tickct, but when you rind I do it, my friend, they put
us in jail, call it inflation, dance around in glee, and
vote the straight ticket, or jacket.
Such was the case of a well known campus figure,
who not only snapped out a rubber check, but passed
it on a judge to pay for his speeding ticket. When the
judge took him to task, the campus figure apologized
profusely, humbly, abjectly, and gave him another
check, which was equally bouncy.
The judge became weary of all this and decided to
file him away under unfinished business. Conse
quedcntially, they stoked him into i.he fast-freezing
unit of the San Jose cooler.
Our Indian rubber man had no difficulty in bounc
ing back to the alkaline side. Fasting and penitcnce
were not for our incarcerated hero. Besides, he was a
bit weak on the New Testament, not quite sure
whether Matthew came before Mark, or Warm before
Luke. Instead, he had for his gospel a book presented
in fond memory by his fraternity brothers, "How the
Saint Eluded the G-Men."
From there, it was not a hard.step up to where he
was playing ping-pong with such famous Stanford
men as Dave Lamson.
Latest reports from the front, and the back, too,
are that he has organized an intramural handball
tournament between the thieves and the embezzlers.
Our hero reports that the thieves have the upper hand
as far as agility is concerned, but that the embezzlers
are forging ahead because they are faster on the
pick-up.
