# MEN IN LAGUNITA
## 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
May I suggest a solution to the
Susan-problem? Like the sorority
| situation, why are the relations be
! tvveen the men and women on this
i campus so formal and strained? As
| "Southern Belle" (or was it some- i
j one else?) suggested, what we need '
I at Stanford is informal get-togethers
... possibly community dining
rooms, where co-eds and Roughs
j can meet under no obligation to each
other and form natural friendships,
i Or even better .. . why not turn \
j Lagunita Court into a co-educational
dormitory? They have them at other
colleges, and Lagunita is ideally I
suited for such a system. The two
wings are entirely separate, joined
I only by the dining-room and recep- i
tion hall.
The men and women could eat to
gether and visit informally in the 1
| Casa social rooms. If more privacy !
, is desired, social rooms in one Casa
i of each wing could be reserved for '
the members of that wing only and
the other living rooms used for i
visiting.
