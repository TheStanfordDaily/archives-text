# Manager Gros Refuses Funds For Debate 'Tour'
## One Engagement Trip To British Columbia Off 
### 
Stanford's debaters will not meet
the University of British Columbia
nor will they spend $150 of Debate
Council funds on a Northwest Tour
until and unless additional engage
ments are obtained, Bob Gros, stu
dent manager, declaimed last night.
"My job is to sec that funds are
spent for the purpose for which
they were allocated," he said.
"Ex Committee granted Debate
Council $150 for a tour which
both the Council and Ex Commit
tee members agreed should con
tain more than a single engage
ment. At present, only one en
gagement is on the books, and the
"tour" as revealed at Debate
Council meeting Tuesday night
would not be a tour at all, but a$
one-stop trip."
He indicated he would not sign a
release for the funds unless other
engagements were contracted.
"To my mind," he declared, "Mr.
Chapin forced an issue at Debate
Council meeting last night when he
refused to allow my motion, ques
tioning the advisability of spending
$150 in violation of the original al
locative agreement, to be voted on.
I withdrew my motion after Mr.
Chapin threatened to resign, be
cause I did not want to force an
issue between a student and a fac
ulty member.
"Accusations that I am blocking
the progress of debating at Stan
ford are manifestly false. I am
merely observing (he original condi
tions under which both Ex Commit
tee and Debate Council authorized
the expenditure. If I allowed the
money to be spent for a purpose not
authorized, I would be technically
liable to impeachment."
The Daily was unable to find Mr.
Chapin yesterday and get his opin
ion.
