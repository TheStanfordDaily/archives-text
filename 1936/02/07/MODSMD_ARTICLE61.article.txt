Stanford is to have another Drama
Festival in the coining summer
quarter. Shakespeare's "Antony
and Cleopatra' and G. B. Shaw's
"Caesar and Cleopatra" will be fea
tured.
One Thursday morning I set out in
the rain and walked past Westmin
ster Abbey and Big Ben to White
hall Court. At Number 4 I went
into an imposing building where
Mr. Shaw works in a study high up,
to the English mind, on the fourth
floor.
I was ushered inio Mr. Shaw's
library office. When he rose to
greet me I was surprised to see that
he was an extremely Lall man.
Before he autographed a first edi
tion of "Caesar and Cleopatra" for
the Stanford Drama Festival, he ex
plained that the play had originally
been written in five acts, with long
intervals for the support of the

theater saloon; the Victorian play
wright worked in conjunction with
the refreshment managers.
I looked for the "Shavian" sharp
ness, but found he was very gentle,
unassuming, and completely the kind '
elderly English gentleman he ap
pears lo be. He has no horns near ,
his earsâ€”his eyes sparkle with '

freshness, but the pungent reckless
ness and rudeness of his reputation
in America seem absolutely un
founded.
