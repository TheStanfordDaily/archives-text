## 'Law Steps Polls' Will Be Open from 8:30 to 2; Ballot Form Emphasized 
### Johnson Hill 
A majority of Stanford's 3900
Houghs and Smooths is expected to
march to the Law Steps polls to
morrow, to vote on 30 candidates for
11 vacant A.S.S.U. offices, according
to Jim Ludlam, chairman of the
election board.
Votes will be accepted from 8:30
until 2 o'clock, after which ballots
will be counted in Room 227. Lud
lam emphasized the fact that all
ballots must be marked with ink,
and that crosses must be used to in
dicate choices.
"In many elections we have been
forced to rule out at least 10 per
cent of the ballots, because voters
did not comply with the marking
regulations. The preferential sys
tem of balloting will be used for all
offices except in Men's Council,
Women's Council, and the yell
leaders' positions," he said yester
day.
"Candidates or other students
with written permission from candi
dates will be permitted to watch
the counting of the ballots," Lud
lam added.
