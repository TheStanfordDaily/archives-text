## Dancer Knocks 'Primitive' Platform, Acts Anyway

"I am Schoop! Your stage . . . eet
ees preemitive. I do not know eef
I can dance there."
An eager Stanford audience, how
ever, discovered Friday night that
Trudi Schoop, despite her misgiv
ings, could dance anywhere, su
perbly, even with the handicap of
the "preemitive" facilities of
the Basketball Favilion.
Miss Schoop and hor associates,
with delightful humor and a degree
of technical skill, demonstrated that
pantomime cpn be made a universal
language. They combined the grace
and rhythm of the dance with adroit
comic mimicry, and their short skits
and longer wance comedy, "Frido
'in," proved entertaining and per
fectly intelligible.
The first half of the program was
devoted to a series of tragi-comic
scenes, "Want Ads," written and
staged by Miss Schoop, with music
by her brother, Paul. The best of
these was the third ad, "Well
trained danseuse accidentally still
disengaged," in which MetuKrahn
portrayed a silly show-girlfcflL the
"beautiful-but-dumb"
ludicrous agility.
"Wanter — immediately,
chanteuse for first class establish
ment," the only ad in which Miss
Schoop herself appeared, was also
cleverly presented social satire.
As "Fridolin," Miss Schoop was
delightful. Her portrait of callow
youth was human, complete. Her
expressive hands and arms, shown
off to their best advantage by the
sleeveless black costume she af
fected, told a story with each flutter
of gesture. When she played the
piano in pantomime, one could al
most see the keys. Miss Schoop's
subtle acting Rave a picture not only
of Fridolin's adventures but also of
his character ... a triumph of pan
tomime.
