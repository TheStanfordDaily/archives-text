# Supreme Court Ruling Expected On TVA Today
## Move To Curb Power 'Deciding Constitutionality' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (/P). —The
eve of another Supreme Court "De
cision Day"—with the TVA case still
undecided—brought renewed specu
lation tonight 011 the movement to
curb the tribunal's power to hold
acts of Congress unconstitutional.
Most observers agreed that invali
dation of the administration's power
cost "yardstick" program in the
Tennessee Valley development
would stimulate activity by congres
sional critics already aroused by
overthrow of the agricultural ad
justment program.
Fifty-two Days Elapsed
Fifty-two days have elapsed since
the case was argued. Decisions in
other New Deal disputes this term
have been announced within 20 to 34
days after argument. Even the
famous "gold clause" cases were de
cided last year in 39 days. The TVA
suit was brought by some stock
holders of the Alabama Power
Company.
Contend Government Right
In an action disputing the right
of the Tennessee Valley authority to
acquire transmission lines to carry
electricity for sale to municipalities,
they contended the government has
no constitutional right to sell power
in competition with private utilities.
The government held it could dis
pose of "surplus" power produced at
dams constructed primarily as aids
to navigation.
