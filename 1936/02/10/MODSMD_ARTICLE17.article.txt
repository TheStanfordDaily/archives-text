# Kaulfers Speaks On Education
## Predicts Radical Changes In Language Instruction 
### 
Foreign language students in the
future won't have to struggle with
noun declensions and verbal con
jugations, according to Dr. Walter V.
Kaulfers, acting assistant professor
of education, who will speak on "The ;
Foreign Language Curriculum of the |
Future" over KGO at 8 o'clock to
night.
"The American frontier today is
primarily social and cultural," he,
said. "Therefore our cultural re
sources must be developed by the ,
study of foreign civilizations, and |
this means4ar more than mere abil- J
ity in the tool uses of language."
Future high school students will
be given an insight into the past con- !
tributions of foreign peoples to our â€¢
national life and their potential con- j
tributions as well, he explained. In 1
this way the subject will supply an
appreciation of foreign and Amer
ican cultures as contrasted with the i
former and current methods of I
teaching conjugations and para
digms.
"These mental gymnastics," ac
cording to Dr. Kaulfers, "have been
exposed as the most educationally
sterile and the most psychologically I
unsound procedure that could ever :
be devised as a means for teaching j
beginners to use a foreign language, j
The speaker, who is connected
with the Palo Alto High School as '
well as the education department, '
is associate editor of "Hispania" and
the "California Journal of Secondary
Education."
