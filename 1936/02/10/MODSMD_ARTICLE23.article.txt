# Two Wins Over U.C.L.A. Put Stanford on Top
## Stoefen Leads Indians To Victory; Bruin Defense Stops "Luisetti's Scoring 
### 
Carrying the southern division
leadership in their hip pockets, vic
torious Indian hoopsters will leave
the "Lark" at 8.12 o'clock this morn
ing and return to the plaudits of
jubliant Farm rooters.
Stanford's pair of come-through
wins, ,45 to 32 and 39 to 35, over
U.C.L.A. in the southland Friday
and Saturday nights gave her a
one-game margin over the Tro
jans, who divided two games with
California. Coach John Bunn and
his men now can start gunning for
the Bears, whom they tackle Fri
day night in Berkeley.
Taught by experience to hound
Hank Luisetti, the Bruins learned
in the first Los Angeles game that
Bunn had another ace up his sleeve.
That surprise was Art Stoefen, tow
ering center, who had hit his stride
against St. Mary's and kept going at
full speed over the week-end.
By dint of constant effort, the
Uclans managed to keep Hank
away from the basket most of both
evenings. While keeping the eagle
eye on him, they failed to rcckon
with "Stofe," who sneaked in to
take advantage of Luisetti's ex
pert "feeding" and chalk up 16
points in the first tussle.
The following night, no Indian i
wild on the warpath, but Stoe?
and Jack Calderwood, lanky gut
did the most scoring damage to
Uclans with eight digits apiece.
Although Stoefen and Luise
were the leading Bruin-hunters Fri
day night, Howell Turner, steady
forward, sank his usual 10 points
and Bob Zonne, 6 feet 5 inches of
sophomore guard, controlled the
backboard situation.

Hanlc was held to nine points Fri
day and eight Saturday, hut he had
as big a hand as anyone in the twin
triumphs, thanks to his sparkling
floor work and defense.
John "Goon" Ball, giant Bruin
i center, went on a rampage in the
! second game to score 26 of his
team's 35 points. Bt;U alone couldn't
i keep pace with Luisetti, Stoofen,
: Calderwood, Zonne, Turner, and
| Captain Dinty Moore, now a sul
| forward, or Stanford would still b
I tied with the Trojans for the lead.
