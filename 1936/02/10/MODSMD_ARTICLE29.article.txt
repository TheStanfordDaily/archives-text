# Wolter Denies San Jose Game Rumor
## 
### 
A denial by Ilarry Wolter, var
sity baseball coach, minimized
reports last night to the effect that
the University was negotiating
for a baseball game with San Jose
State, following that school's
abandonment of their open room
and-board franchise for athletes.
Wolter said be bad beard no
mention of any such advance on
the part of the University, and
that an official conference ruling
would probably be needed to nul
lify last year's recommendation
that conference teams were not to
schedule games with San Jose
State.
