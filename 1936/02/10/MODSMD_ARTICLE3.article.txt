Questioned about their policies j
and their qualifications, the can- ;
didatcs for the several Ex Com
mittee openings which are to he
filled in tomorrow's elections, out
lined their positions last Thurs
day night and gave the various I
johs which they have held on the |
campus.
Graduate Member on Ex Committee
FRANCES BURKS, Women's ath
letic Association, Walrus Club Plan
ning Committee, Convalescent Drive
Committee, Masquers, Choir: "I con
sider that the Ex Committee should
be a neutral body lo act as a balance
for the various interests of the As
sociated Students. I therefore do
not advocate the proposed revision
of representation, because its ques
tionable advantages are seriously '
outweighed by the loss of efficiency
and neutrality that a committee re
presenting special interests would j
mean, and by the plan's sacrifice '
of Stanford's democratic ideal . . .
I favor bookstore rebates; and re
duction of student taxation ..."
DICK CREAMER, Business Man
ager of the Chappie, Member of Pub
lication Council: "I think that the
proposed plan for the revision of Ex
Committee representation should be
put to vote as soon as student opin
ion has a chance to form and before
it is forgotten. Baby kissing lines
form to the right."
Junior Man on Ex Committee
JACK CRAVEN, Varsity debating,
soph basketball manager: 'Aside
from giving our president, Wally
Brooke, all the cooperation I can,
I would like to see the Ex Commit- j
tee abandon its present policy of \
"magnificent isolation" and adopt
one more in keeping with Stanford
ideals and traditions. My ambitions
are entirely free from 'gravy' strains
and I would appreciate this oppor- {
tunity to take a more active part in
our student government."
GEORGE LINDAHL, Dramatic
Manager: "I believe that the Ex
Committee should be considered
more seriously by the members of
the committee since they control
the apportioning of considerable
funds for various student activities
in addition to their routine work.
The members are elected to repre
sent the students to the best of their
abilities and for this reason should
attend Ex Committee meetings regu
larly and become familiar with the j
"A.S.S.U. constitution."
808 WELCH, frosh debate mana
ger, debate team, golf team, junior
golf manager: "If elected I will try
to the best of my ability to increase
the efficiency of Ex Committee so
that the interest of Stanford students
will be furthered."
CHICK FRANICH, junior football
manager, Toyon manager, and Car
dinals: "I believe that it is the duty
of a good Ex Committeeman to at
tend meetings regularly, to initiate
such action as he deems to be for
the bests interests of Stanford Uni
versity, and to cooperate with the
student body. Amen!"
Sophomore Woman 011 Ex Committee
MAXINE MOORE, Roble corridor
chairman, vocational guidance com
mittee, Daily business staff, hockey
club. Y.W.C.A.: "My main idea is to
see that the wishes of the sophomore
class are carried out. At no time
would I represent my own selfish
interests, or the desires of arty small
group of my friends, but would try
to represent the best interests of the
University as a whole, and of the
Sophomore class in particular."
JACKIE BROWN, Roble Club,
Y.W.CA. Cabinet Member, Election
Board Member, Vocational Guidance
Committee: "If I am elected, I will
be a representative of the student
body as a whole, I shall try to be
as impartial as possible in finding j
out about each measure, and I shall
vote sensibly and thoroughly."
