The Editor, Sir:
It seems that all is not well with
the boys and girls of the "Farm."
: That freshman dream of love be
: tween classes has apparently been
i dispelled from more than one
! panting bosom and in its place is
j appearing the sour cynicism of dis
j illusionment. Why this war between
: the sexes? This Susan business has
! brought everything to a head. The
1 men having at last expressed their
j latent dissatisfaction, the women are
i now indulging in their usual pre-
I rogative of the final epithet.
As war seems to have been
I formally declared it seems only fit
ting that there should be no more
social intercourse between the com
batants. Let us have a thorough
j going blockade and boycott, with
, picket lines in front of the women's
halls and sororities until finally the
female element has been reduced to
; submission. Starvation can be potent
medicine. Those girls who, when
j they registered, imagined they were
joining a country club, might then
j resign; the library might cease to be
contact spot, and students could
start work again. The boys could
then let their "lines" rest up a bit
while the more ambitious might stop
trying for a touchdown on the first
I play.
The girls, for that is what most of
j them are, might for their part attend
| an elementary course in sincerity,
| stop comparing notes, forget about
I the city, cease imagining themselves
' as naive and bother more about with
whom, rather than where they are
! going.
Who knows, after a quarter or
two of this rigorous discipline Stan
i ford women, for they way have de-
I veloped into women by this time,
I might become similar to their more
i charming sisters outside the campus?
! Stanford men and women might find
j themselves more mutually suitable.
The only hitch in this plan that I'
I can see, is that no sane man who,
■ once strayed further afield, would
' ever return to this barren pasturage.

In this regard, at least, the "Farm"
is a misnomer.

The Editor, Sir:
It seems that all is not well with
the boys and girls of the "Farm."
: That freshman dream of love be
: tween classes has apparently been
i dispelled from more than one
! panting bosom and in its place is
j appearing the sour cynicism of dis
j illusionment. Why this war between
: the sexes? This Susan business has
! brought everything to a head. The
1 men having at last expressed their
j latent dissatisfaction, the women are
i now indulging in their usual pre-
I rogative of the final epithet.
As war seems to have been
I formally declared it seems only fit
ting that there should be no more
social intercourse between the com
batants. Let us have a thorough
j going blockade and boycott, with
, picket lines in front of the women's
halls and sororities until finally the
female element has been reduced to
; submission. Starvation can be potent
medicine. Those girls who, when
j they registered, imagined they were
joining a country club, might then
j resign; the library might cease to be
contact spot, and students could
start work again. The boys could
then let their "lines" rest up a bit
while the more ambitious might stop
trying for a touchdown on the first
I play.
