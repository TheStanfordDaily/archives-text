Fluent pantomime in the best Tru
di Schoop manner brought compre
hension out of a sea of lame, halt
ing German (lame, but not on Tru
di's part) when the small Swiss
comedienne essayed a short where
and-why-for of her career Satur
day.
Speaking faultless French, Ger
man, and Italian, she knows prac
tically no English, however. But
that isn't a drawback to Trudi !
Schoop, for with her swift-moving
hands and facile, expressive eyes j
and mouth, she was able to convey j
her varying opinions on- American '
jazz, Charlie Chaplin, and even
Mickey Mouse.
Opposes Parents
Starting her career against the
wishes of her parents, she was for j
several seasons a solo dancer in the |
theaters of northern Europe. But j
she always had had the idea of
showing not the unusual—but the
usual in life—those tragic events j
that happen to us and send our |
friends into hysterics. So Trudi
Schoop decided to perfect her plan, I
and two years ago first started her
traveling troupe.
In spite of a waiting bus, a wait
ing company, and an imminent per- i
formance, Trudi Schoop wasn't in a '
hurry. "America is exciting," she '

said. As her technique is modern,
she is quite enthusiastic about our
ideas and customs.
"Here, and in the northern Euro
pean countries, the audiences pene
trate the simplicity of our perform
ances," she explained. "They don't
need elaborate costuming and scen
ery to aid their imagination, as in
the Ujißfi countries."
Brothers Help
Aidaßby her two brothers, one
who designs her costumes, and the
other who writes her music, the
comic artiste evolves her own ideas
for the ballet. In fact, she even
creates the costumes, but her broth
er Max draws and colors them.
The music, which is one of the
most striking things in the whole
performance, is the composition of
Brother Paul, who has, as his sister
explained, taken the essentials of our
American jazz which has crossed to
Switzerland, and produced modern
scores to complement her most
modern caricatures of contemporary
life.
"Charlie Chaplin is the greatest
artist," she explained, with a vigor
ous shake of her head. To approach
his perfection is enough for Trudi
Schoop.

several seasons a solo dancer in the |
theaters of northern Europe. But j
she always had had the idea of
showing not the unusual—but the
usual in life—those tragic events j
that happen to us and send our |
friends into hysterics. So Trudi
Schoop decided to perfect her plan, I
and two years ago first started her
traveling troupe.
In spite of a waiting bus, a wait
ing company, and an imminent per- i
formance, Trudi Schoop wasn't in a '
hurry. "America is exciting," she '

said. As her technique is modern,
she is quite enthusiastic about our
ideas and customs.
"Here, and in the northern Euro
pean countries, the audiences pene
trate the simplicity of our perform
ances," she explained. "They don't
need elaborate costuming and scen
ery to aid their imagination, as in
the Ujißfi countries."
Brothers Help
Aidaßby her two brothers, one
who designs her costumes, and the
other who writes her music, the
comic artiste evolves her own ideas
for the ballet. In fact, she even
creates the costumes, but her broth
er Max draws and colors them.
The music, which is one of the
most striking things in the whole
performance, is the composition of
Brother Paul, who has, as his sister
explained, taken the essentials of our
American jazz which has crossed to
Switzerland, and produced modern
scores to complement her most
modern caricatures of contemporary
life.
"Charlie Chaplin is the greatest
artist," she explained, with a vigor
ous shake of her head. To approach
his perfection is enough for Trudi
Schoop.
Fluent pantomime in the best Tru
di Schoop manner brought compre
hension out of a sea of lame, halt
ing German (lame, but not on Tru
di's part) when the small Swiss
comedienne essayed a short where
and-why-for of her career Satur
day.
Speaking faultless French, Ger
man, and Italian, she knows prac
tically no English, however. But
that isn't a drawback to Trudi !
Schoop, for with her swift-moving
hands and facile, expressive eyes j
and mouth, she was able to convey j
her varying opinions on- American '
jazz, Charlie Chaplin, and even
Mickey Mouse.
