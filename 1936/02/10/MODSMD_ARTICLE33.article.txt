# ADVICE FOR MEN

### 
The Editor, Sir:
At last letters are coming in to
the paper from people who know
what are the requisites of a good |
date—the Southerners.
A Southern woman does not have
to be beautiful to be popular, al- !
though eight out of ten are. They
do not have the same dry line of
conversation that western girls have.
A person can go to any southern I
town and meet people with ease, j
One never needs to worry about !
having a good time. Southern girls J
are the most friendly and hospitable !
"gals" in the country, and the only J
trouble is that there are not more j
people like them.
If a man is at Stanford to get an J
education, I do not blame him; but
if he is here with the idea of meet
ing attractive and sensible women, i
I should advise him to save $115 a
quarter and go to Tulane, Alabame, :
Georgia, or Virginia.
