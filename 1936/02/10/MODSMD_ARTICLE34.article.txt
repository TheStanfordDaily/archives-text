# Student Shaves In Bacteriology Lab, Disregards Germs
## 
### 
Bubonic plague, the stuff that
yearly sends thousands of Chinese to
their graves, didn't bother a student
bacteriologist last week.
He was working with germs of
the dread disease in the bacteriology
lab when, to his classmates' sur
prise, he whipped an electric razor
out of his pocket, plugged it into a
socket, and proceeded to shave
himself.
Explaining he had a date that
night and was pressed for time, he
wiped off his face, went back to the
little germs.
