"The number of mild influenza
cases on the campus is still grad
ually increasing," announced Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, chairman of the
faculty Committee on Public-
Health, last .light, "but there is
nothing to worry about. So far as
i I have heard there have been no
serious cases reported."
Dr. Storey repeated his warning
that all those who feel that they
have a cold coming on should report
to the health service for treatment
and examination, and that particular
care be taken to keep warm and dry
and not to tempt a cold. "There was
some trouble last week," continued
Storey, "about enough hospital ac
commodations for those afflicted, but
this has been straightened out
now."
