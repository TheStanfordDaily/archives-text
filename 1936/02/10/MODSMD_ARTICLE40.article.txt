## COME ON OUT SOMETIME; IT'S FREE AND FUN 
### 
Up until 2:30 o'ciock Saturday (
afternoon I was almost disgustingly i
ignorant and disinterested in col- !
lege baseball. Having nothing else '
of great import to do, I wandered
out to che Sunken Diamond to see if ,
I could find out what a ball looked ,
like, or see what manner of physics |
majors and their ilk played for the j
alma mater (pronounced like
waiter).
From 2:.'50 to 4 o'clock I had a
very nice time. My conclusion:
college hall is O.K. You sit out
there in the bleachers, sprawled
out over five or six seats and i
have an ideally idle time doing j
practically nothing. You eat pea- i
nuts or strawberry ice-cream or I
wonder who the hell the players !
are.
You see everyone else around you |
sort of enjaying the game, and see |
the players themselves having a !
swell time cracking wise and keep- J
ing up a steady, nasal, crackling ;
stream of the ol' chattah.
You are all the time unconsciously
absorbing al lthis atmosphere, and j
by gosh if it doesn't begin to get !
you after about 20 minutes.
You begin to open your mouth j
yourself, and pretty soon words be- I
gin to flow out of it. 1
So you are then one of the mob '
howling at the action on the dia
mond—whether booing the umpire
on a close one, booing an opposing
show-off fellow, informing the
rival pitcher that the law of grav
ity is so much tommyrot as far
as he's concerned—that he's up in
the air—yelling easy man at each
opposing batsmen, and exhorting
Bones or Red to "pole it out of the i
lot." I
All of this goes on, mind you, [
sans artificial stimulus or alcoholic
boost of any kind.
Baseball is still the national
pastime, the Great American
Game, and by all rights it should
enjoy some measure of popular
ity at. school, where sport is one
of the accepted demi-gods.
And Harry Wolter has a good club
here this year, too—but more about j
that later.
TINY THORNIIILL'S back in
town, back from the coaches' rules
confab. Tiny got a big kick over at
the ball game Saturday out of Bob
Matthews, his future varsity guard.
Bob was on first, after a neat Texas
leaguer. The next batter hit a drib
bler to the short-stop, who threw to
second to put Bob out. Matthews
was not out of the play then and
there, though, for he ducked his head
and put a perfect rolling block on
the luckless second-sacker, thereby
preventing that worthy from relay
ing to first for a double play. -Breed t

practically nothing. You eat pea- i
nuts or strawberry ice-cream or I
wonder who the hell the players !
are.
You see everyone else around you |
sort of enjaying the game, and see |
the players themselves having a !
swell time cracking wise and keep- J
ing up a steady, nasal, crackling ;
stream of the ol' chattah.
You are all the time unconsciously
absorbing al lthis atmosphere, and j
by gosh if it doesn't begin to get !
you after about 20 minutes.
You begin to open your mouth j
yourself, and pretty soon words be- I
gin to flow out of it. 1
So you are then one of the mob '
howling at the action on the dia
mond—whether booing the umpire
on a close one, booing an opposing
show-off fellow, informing the
rival pitcher that the law of grav
ity is so much tommyrot as far
as he's concerned—that he's up in
the air—yelling easy man at each
opposing batsmen, and exhorting
Bones or Red to "pole it out of the i
lot." I
All of this goes on, mind you, [
sans artificial stimulus or alcoholic
boost of any kind.
Baseball is still the national
pastime, the Great American
Game, and by all rights it should
enjoy some measure of popular
ity at. school, where sport is one
of the accepted demi-gods.
And Harry Wolter has a good club
here this year, too—but more about j
that later.
TINY THORNIIILL'S back in
town, back from the coaches' rules
confab. Tiny got a big kick over at
the ball game Saturday out of Bob
Matthews, his future varsity guard.
Bob was on first, after a neat Texas
leaguer. The next batter hit a drib
bler to the short-stop, who threw to
second to put Bob out. Matthews
was not out of the play then and
there, though, for he ducked his head
and put a perfect rolling block on
the luckless second-sacker, thereby
preventing that worthy from relay
ing to first for a double play. -Breed t
Up until 2:30 o'ciock Saturday (
afternoon I was almost disgustingly i
ignorant and disinterested in col- !
lege baseball. Having nothing else '
of great import to do, I wandered
out to che Sunken Diamond to see if ,
I could find out what a ball looked ,
like, or see what manner of physics |
majors and their ilk played for the j
alma mater (pronounced like
waiter).
From 2:.'50 to 4 o'clock I had a
very nice time. My conclusion:
college hall is O.K. You sit out
there in the bleachers, sprawled
out over five or six seats and i
have an ideally idle time doing j
practically nothing. You eat pea- i
nuts or strawberry ice-cream or I
wonder who the hell the players !
are.
