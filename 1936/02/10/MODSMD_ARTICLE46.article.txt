# Cards Tie Beefy Trojans in Fierce Rugby Battle
## 
### 
The U.S.C. boys were awfully big,
and some were pretty fast, so Jim â– 
Wylie's crew of ruggers emerged j
from the first conference struggle
with a 3-3 tie.
Troy scored early in the first
period to take a lead that looked
about twice as big as the Sunny
vale hangar, at least with the way
Jim llaney's southerners were
fighting and ball-hawking to re
tain that three-point margin, rung
up by front finer Jim Sutherland
on a 35-yard penalty kick.
Midway in the second half, how
ever, Jim Mullen, the veteran Cardi
nal scrum leader, booted a perfect
placement kick to even the count.
For the next 15 minutes until the j
gun popped there'was a wild scram
ble by the rivals to cross the line
and win the game, but both defenses ;
were too effective.
For the Cards Captain Joe Vigna,
Tony Cockins, Norm Hager, and 1
Mullen were outstanding.
Troy banked on their imposing l
football beef trust, which included
Gil Kuhn, the next grid captain, Joe
Wilensky, Jim Rorison, Nick Rado- !
vicli, Eddie Kuntz, Captain Bill j
Howard, and Nick Pappadakis.
