## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism News Coverage, Cooperation Through Criticism--—a New Policy Takes Hold 
### 
Dkak Hon:
While you arc moving knickknacks into
your ollice across the hall, a new editor, a new
stall', and a new policy take over the edit
olliees of the Daily as Volume 81) yets under
way.
Your volume, Hob, laid a foundation that
will prove invaluable as the new regime pro
grosses. With that foundation as a starting
point, Volume <S9 will stress, as a keynote of
ils policy, publishing a newspaper, one which
will be recognized as such both on and oil'
campus.
From (lie editor down to the tryoulees, the
aim will be to make the stall' "news con
scious," and the Daily will expend every ef
fort to "cover the campus like a blanket."
Hesides being a newspaper, however, the
Daily is a college newspaper—which entails
two things:
First, I realize that the Daily must have,
as one of ils functions, that of a campus bulle
tin board. The Daily is the nervous system
that co-ordinates the various campus organi
zations and activities.
Hecause of Ibis, that necessary evil known
as free publicity must be given ils rightful
place in the Daily. The editor, naturally, will
reserve the right to determine Ibis "rightful
place," and will apportion space as the news
and interest in the activity warrant.

Second, since the Daily is a college news
paper, stress will be on that which is of inter
est on the campus. Hence, news of national
affairs will be printed, as before, in skeleton
form, with the emphasis on local angles.
Editorially, the stress will be on local prob
lems, and, above all, the Daily will attempt
to maintain harmony among the various de
partments and activities.
When prodding seems necessary, the Daily
will be on hand to prod; when the Daily be
lieves it has a better plan to suggest than the
one already in use, it will not hesitate to
suggest—the Daily, however, will never criti
cize just to be criticizing, will not stir up
trouble unless it is sincere in its belief that
trouble is essential to a more efficient or har
monious advancement of any campus func
tion.
From your new sanctum, Hob, I hope you
will be able to watch the Daily come out each
morning with a complete picture of the new:;
of the day before, each paper a panorama of
one day's life at Stanford —with ils occasional
important or significant news, its constant
reminders of the sidelights that typify the
Farm, its imported news of the outside world,
and ils co-operation with all campus organi
zations radiated by constructive editorial criti
cism.
Sincerely, Hhownly
