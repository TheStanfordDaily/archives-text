# The 						Nation Loses Wise Counsel
## 
### 
The carefully worded expressions of sorrow
and grief at the death of Charles Curtis, which
were made by public figures yesterday, sound
unusually trite and unctuous.
Through long paragraphs of "I am deeply
distressed . . . his legion of friends will re
member him . . . he was a fine man," is to
lie found, however, one real five-word tribute.
If was written by Herbert Hoover.
"The nation loses wise counsel."
I'ncolorful and undramatic though Charles
Curtis' career may have seemed, its value in
an advisory capacity cannot be minimized.
That quality was demonstrated both in the
Senate and in the Vice-President's oflice.
No one, Republicans and Democrats in
cluded. can deny thai American government
needs wise counsel. The nation will not only
mourn Charles Curtisâ€”il will miss him.
