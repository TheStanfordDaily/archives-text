# A 						Mutiny Against "Tyranny at Boat-house"
## 
### 
When trick Ids and wet-weather creeks
sent muddy water down the hill-sides and put
I ruth in the assertion that the low place be
hind Koble is a lake, many a canoe-paddling
lan began thinking ol moonlight nights on
the water. Paddles were varnished, boat-bot
toms were mended, and when the sun came
out, a minor horde marched to Lagunita in
the Iraine ot mind of sixth-graders romping
out into the year's lirst snow.
I hen came a squelching. "You can't go in
the water," said the two custodians.
Ihe water's high enough for canoeing.
That's admitted. And the weather, especially
during the past week-end, has certainly been
canoe weather. Hut because the two students
who have been put in charge of the boat-house
have it figured out that the incline down to

the water is too steep, that it isn't the psycho
logical moment, or that a heavy storm is im
pending, nobody can go canoeing.
Inasmuch as there's nothing in the charter
of the fourteenth amendment which says
Stanford students can't go canoeing during
the second week in February, what amounts
to "tyranny at the boat-house" might well be
modified in the interest of student recreation
during the dreary winter months.
