Our Hasher has an untrudi scoop on the Comic
Ballet.
The whole Schoop troupe flounced into the Cellar
Friday night before their Concert Series perform
ance to partake of the low prices and the high food.
The women were dressed in slacks and the men '
with scarfs and sweaters of bizarre stripes. The hash
ers, with the true child-like curiosity of the provender ;
providers, were naturally very excited. One in par
ticular was an instructor in the French department
who carves out his manivest destiny at the campus
underground salt lick.
He noted an exotic looking member of the troupe
at the end of the counter. His colleagues told him that j
it was Trudi herself, but that she could speak only [
French.
This was duck soup (on the 50-cent lunch with i
entree) for an instructor, so he slopped a glass of '
water towards her and whipped out an ovation in
Gallic, asking her how she liked America, the Great
Plains, the Gobi Desert, the weather, the fishing, the :
audiences, Stanford, the hashers, and French in
structors.
Came the answer: "Sorry, but I don't speak so
good the French. Can you talk in English?"
So. alas, it is my duti, to report she wasn't Trudi, !
but at least she wasn't snooti, anyhow.
How Stanford students spend their week-ends has '
always been a vital subject, but as yet, no one has i
written a doctor's thesis on the subject, so of course we [
have no way of knowing anything about it. As a pre- j
liminary to at least a bibliography or a statistical sum
mary, however, Our Hash posits a few assumptions. !
Two who went bicycling ended up in Los Altos ,
Saturday. There they saw a lady standing on the
corner whose arms were full of packages and dog.
Jumping up at her was another hound. True to tra- ;
ditions of Stanford chivalry, they offered themselves.
She recommended that they hold the other dog. This
they did. "How long shall we do this?" they asked.
"Until the bus comes along," she replied.
The bus was due in another 20 minutes.
Before the bus arrived, though, the dog became i
weary of the whole darn rigamarolle, and bit out six
stitches' worth of ear from the gallant.

they did. "How long shall we do this?" they asked.
"Until the bus comes along," she replied.
The bus was due in another 20 minutes.
Before the bus arrived, though, the dog became i
weary of the whole darn rigamarolle, and bit out six
stitches' worth of ear from the gallant.
Our Hasher has an untrudi scoop on the Comic
Ballet.
The whole Schoop troupe flounced into the Cellar
Friday night before their Concert Series perform
ance to partake of the low prices and the high food.
The women were dressed in slacks and the men '
with scarfs and sweaters of bizarre stripes. The hash
ers, with the true child-like curiosity of the provender ;
providers, were naturally very excited. One in par
ticular was an instructor in the French department
who carves out his manivest destiny at the campus
underground salt lick.
He noted an exotic looking member of the troupe
at the end of the counter. His colleagues told him that j
it was Trudi herself, but that she could speak only [
French.
This was duck soup (on the 50-cent lunch with i
entree) for an instructor, so he slopped a glass of '
water towards her and whipped out an ovation in
Gallic, asking her how she liked America, the Great
Plains, the Gobi Desert, the weather, the fishing, the :
audiences, Stanford, the hashers, and French in
structors.
Came the answer: "Sorry, but I don't speak so
good the French. Can you talk in English?"
So. alas, it is my duti, to report she wasn't Trudi, !
but at least she wasn't snooti, anyhow.
How Stanford students spend their week-ends has '
always been a vital subject, but as yet, no one has i
written a doctor's thesis on the subject, so of course we [
have no way of knowing anything about it. As a pre- j
liminary to at least a bibliography or a statistical sum
mary, however, Our Hash posits a few assumptions. !
Two who went bicycling ended up in Los Altos ,
Saturday. There they saw a lady standing on the
corner whose arms were full of packages and dog.
Jumping up at her was another hound. True to tra- ;
ditions of Stanford chivalry, they offered themselves.
She recommended that they hold the other dog. This
they did. "How long shall we do this?" they asked.
"Until the bus comes along," she replied.
