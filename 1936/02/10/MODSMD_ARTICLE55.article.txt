## Illinois Looks at Prisons (Reprinted from The Daily Illini) 
### 
Whatever immediate effect the Loeb prison affair
ma.\ have incited, the outstanding effect it should bring
about is to show the obvious inadequacy of the present
penal system.
The "searching investigation" promised by the state
director of public welfare seems to have petered out.
It is too bad that such an officer does not have quite
the ambition to investigate the welfare of those who
.iced it most—the ones whose welfare has been ne
glected in their early years and are now stagnating
in prison as a result.
It takes no mess of statistical data to prove that the
penitentiary has not cut down lawlessness. Peniten
tiaries constructed today are overcrowded tomorrow.
This condition cannot be blamed entirely on the in
crease in population.
It is undeniable as well that prison as it stands
today is a breeding place for incorrigible criminals.
Boys and young men jailed for minor or unpremedi
tated offenses are subjected to the influences of hard
ened criminals.
They develop a searing hatred of the law which
condemned them, absorb the underworld code and
methods, and come out unbelievably well tutored in
applied criminology.
Does the state welfare director deem it unneces
sary to unearth the sources from which the criminal
element springs and to launch a decisive campaign to
eliminate these sources? If so, he does not deserve the
title he carries.
