## MR. ROWELL SEES ROSES IN THE DANDELION PATCH 
### 
Chester Rowell . . . grey-haired
. . . brilliant commentator on every
thing under the suji . . . called him
self a heretic last week . . . and
showed himself to be sadly lacking
in knowledge of college men . . . |
when he thumped the drum for
more "theoretical" subjects and less 1
"practical" ones.
=i" ♦ *
Commercial accounting, English i
composition, medicine, and engi- |
neerings are fads. Integral calcu- i
I us, the covenant of the League of
Nations, Chinese religion, and com
parative religion are most practical.
And university men are '"thinking
individuals" who "know their way
around in the world in which they
find themselves."
* * *
Ah~Mr. Rowell, how wrong and
how nght you are! Of courses, you
are right in saying a "theoretical
subject is one you can think about,
and a practical one is one you can
do something with." But you are I
preaching divine gospel in the pres- |
ence of atheists—you are explaining
the wisdom of eternity to ears deaf
ened by thunderous demands for
"practical" successes.
* * #
Do you know, Mr. Rowell, how j
many of us come to college to find j
things to think about? No. And do
you know how many come seeking
knowledge that we can do some
thing with? Yes. We overrun lab- i

oratories and • law libraries. And I
could you imagine what would hap- j
pen to American universities if the
facilities for learning to earn a liv- .
ing were abolished in favor of
courses which would inspire thought }
as to the whys, and hows of all i
that make up this world and its uni
verse?
* * *
You say that if a man's ideals and
standards merely drift with the
crowd, he is a moral and spiritual
ignoramus. What, then, are men
who play pool and football by day, '
and read Collier's and walch Joan I
Crawford by night while Plato's j
"Republic" and Wells' "Outline of j
History" gather dust in closets. And j
what are men who sing lustily that !
"it's not. for knowledge that we
came to college, but to raise hell
while we're here," and make no ex
cuses about demonstrating their be- |
lief in that reason.
* * *
We can't agree with your answer
to "What is practical education," j
Mr. Rowell. for we aren't capable of
comprehending, understanding, or I
appreciating those subjects which in '
your mind constitute higher learn- I
ing. Your mere mention of the sub- I
ject, however, is a compliment to us
as college students. But, as a mat- i
ter of fact, Mr. Rowell, about half |
of us don't belong in college even j
as it is now; we would have been j
more useful and learned just as j
much in Uncle George's department
store.

Do you know, Mr. Rowell, how j
many of us come to college to find j
things to think about? No. And do
you know how many come seeking
knowledge that we can do some
thing with? Yes. We overrun lab- i

oratories and • law libraries. And I
could you imagine what would hap- j
pen to American universities if the
facilities for learning to earn a liv- .
ing were abolished in favor of
courses which would inspire thought }
as to the whys, and hows of all i
that make up this world and its uni
verse?
* * *
You say that if a man's ideals and
standards merely drift with the
crowd, he is a moral and spiritual
ignoramus. What, then, are men
who play pool and football by day, '
and read Collier's and walch Joan I
Crawford by night while Plato's j
"Republic" and Wells' "Outline of j
History" gather dust in closets. And j
what are men who sing lustily that !
"it's not. for knowledge that we
came to college, but to raise hell
while we're here," and make no ex
cuses about demonstrating their be- |
lief in that reason.
* * *
We can't agree with your answer
to "What is practical education," j
Mr. Rowell. for we aren't capable of
comprehending, understanding, or I
appreciating those subjects which in '
your mind constitute higher learn- I
ing. Your mere mention of the sub- I
ject, however, is a compliment to us
as college students. But, as a mat- i
ter of fact, Mr. Rowell, about half |
of us don't belong in college even j
as it is now; we would have been j
more useful and learned just as j
much in Uncle George's department
store.

Ah~Mr. Rowell, how wrong and

are right in saying a "theoretical
subject is one you can think about,
and a practical one is one you can
do something with." But you are I
preaching divine gospel in the pres- |

the wisdom of eternity to ears deaf
ened by thunderous demands for
"practical" successes.
