Several quarters a lecturcr in j

and journalist.
At first intending to become a
university professor, he instead en
tered journalism and for 22 years
was editor of the Fresno Republican. :
From the very beginning of his ca- ;
reer, Mr. Rowell was interested in j
international peace and humani- '
tarian acts.
It was his work 25 years ago for
the workmen's compensation act, !
and his part in the organization of
the group, that made it possible; and
for 20 years he has been a membei'
of the Social Insurance Commission.
In his interest in international
peace, the editor has been trustee of
the World Peace Association and a
leader in the Institute of Pacific
Relations.
