The Editor, Sir:
. . . Let it be understood here that
I like the Farm â€¢.tmosphcre, cords
and all. But when the occasion
arises, I would like to see Stanford
people run circles around the east
ern smoothies; to be as much at
home on a camping trip as a dance
floor.
I'm highly in favor of "Lulu's"
idea of turning Lagunita Court into
a co-educational dormitory.

I think it would be fun if wc had !
a place like the cellar that would be !
large enough for ping P'>ng and pool
tables. In one part maybe a dance
floor. The soda fountain would .still ;
be there and would furnish orange |
juice at 5 cents a glass (silly dream). !
There would be a very informal
atmosphere . . . and one would feel
free to talk to anyone who looked
interesting.
Now about the women and the
hitch-hiking system to Paly. Some
of the men don't quite understand
what a girl is up against. You sec, '
we are brought up with the idea that |
there are certain things a nice girl i
doesn't do, and accepting rides with
strange men is one of them.
Here's to a better and happier
"Stanford fapiily." Susan
