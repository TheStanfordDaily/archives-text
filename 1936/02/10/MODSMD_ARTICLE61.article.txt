# Cagney, O'Brien Aviators in 'Ceiling Zero'
## (A Movie Review) 
### 
"CEILING ZERO," adaptation of
last year's New York stage success,
now playing at the Stanford The-
Aater, is an aviation picture
with a minimum of flying
and a maximum of sus
pense. Pat O'Brien is the
ground superintendent and Jimmy
Cagney is the n'er-do-well ex-war
ace.
Pat barks orders and everyone
obeys, until Cagney comes along.
Even at 34 years old, he's still a
rascal with the women. To keep
a date with pretty June Travis, he
feigns heart-trouble and sends
Stuart Erwin to fly his mail sched
ule.
When Erwin runs into a storm arid
tries to land with "ceiling zero," the
suspense is greatest and the picture
is best. He calls frantically over
his radiophone but can get no an
swer. What's worse, the oflice can
hear him calling, but can get no
message through lo him. You'll be
on your seat's very edge through
this.
It's too bad you remember the
perpetual Cagney-O'Brien quarrels
in those awful things about devil
dogs and the Irish. Because you're
liable to pass up this really worth
while film on the human side of
commercial aviation.
Buddy Rogers and June Clyde
fight it out as rival orchestra lead
ers in "DANCE BAND." Buddy
tries to recapture his 1928 "cute
ness," fails miserably. â€”Botsford
