# ENGLISH SATIRIST

(Continued)

Over the fireplace hung a group
of Albrecht Durer wood block
engravings. Around the room, which
overlooked the Thames, were book
eases filled with the works of H. G.
Wells, a series of books on Japan, a
complete file of "Who's Who," and
sets of encyclopedias requisite to the
writer, in addition to editions of all
his own plays and prefaces.
The atmosphere of the entire
room was one of quiet and the custo
mary English reserve. This man of
vitriolic reputation seomed at home
here, but from his paper covered
desk have come vicious satires and
intellectual comedies in an under
standing that has developed from a
long active life covering many gen
erations, changes, and social revo
lutions.
Two more charming personalities,
more genuine, sincere, and great
than Noel Coward and George Ber
nard Shaw would be difficult to find
anywhere in the world. They may
be known from their works as
satirists of facile and sharp wit, but
like the best artists of all centuries,
they save their energy for its right
ful place—in their work.
