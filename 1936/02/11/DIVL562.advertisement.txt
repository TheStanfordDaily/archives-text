Students of Stanford!
I'll Pay You *1.00
For Your Old Shoes
I will then pay for the materials to have them repaired—
then turn them over to the needy free of cost
As a citizen of Palo Alto and knowing the many requests to
assist those in need, I have undertaken—through the month of
February—to pay you one dollar for your old shoes, supply the
materials to have them repaired, then turn them over to the
Mothers' Club for self-supporting Stanford students or to Palo
Alto public welfare organizations for distribution to the needy.
This is what you do: Wear a pair of your old shoes into my
store, Walk-Over Boot Shop, 220 University Avenue—buy a new
pair—pay for them—then get $1.00 for the old shoes you leave
behind.
This is a personal appeal. Our less fortunate neighbors need
our help. With your hearty co-operation and support we can do
something really worth while. May I count on you?
