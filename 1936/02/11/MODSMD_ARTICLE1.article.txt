### 
"The question of whether or not j
fundi; should be granted the debate |
team for a single-engagement trip
to the Northwest last night was defi
nitely elosed before it became an
issue." Wayne Richardson, debate
manager, announced that three de
bates had been scheduled for a
week's trip beginning February 21.
These will be with the University
of British Columbia, the University
of Washington, and Oregon Stale
College.
Original Tour Postponed
This tour was originally scheduled
for last November and suiTered
three postponements. Throughout
this period the plan was to have
several engagements on the trip,
which was thoroughly favored by
Leland T. Chapin, faculty adviser to
Debate Council.
Last week unforeseen circum
stances threatened to bring about
cancellation of all but one of these
debates. At that time Bob Gros,
student manager, stated that no trip
would be made unless more than
one debate could be scheduled.
Chapin Commends Gros
Concerning his purported stand
against this decision, Professor
Chapin remarked.
"I believe absolutely in the right
of student government; that is, the
students' right to control their own
funds. I was merely interested, how
ever", in fulfilling the obligation we
had with the University of British
Columbia.
"Furthermore, since I had noti
fied one of the debaters last No
vember that he would make the trip
and since he had been counting on it,
I believed that the tour should not
have been cancelled.
"I feel that Gros was acting en
tirely within his province as man
ager of the students' funds."
