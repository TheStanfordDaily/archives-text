# Indians Lead Conference, Enjoy Practice
## Art Stoelen in Hospital With Flu; Bunn Plans For California Games 
### Phil Duffy 
A group of happy, laughing bas- |
ketball players worked out in the ;
Pavilion yesterday, not at all af
fected by the fact that they were
leading the southern division of the j
Coast Conference.
Stanford's greatest hoop team in I
many a long year returned from the
South yesterday with two victories
over U.C.L.A. and but one casualty !
in their ranks: lanky Art Stoefen, |
who caused a sensation by his shoot
ing on the southern court, came j
back to land in the hospital with the j
flu.
Bunn Pleased
His case is not serious, however, â€¢
and Dr. Roth gives him a good j
chance of being on deck for the !
California game this Friday night, i
Jack Calderwood developed a
charley horse and Bob Zonne (ac
cent on the "e" according to the
southern radio announcer), has his
bum linger taped. They both worked
out last, evening and seemed in |
good shape.

Rooters' tickets for this Fri
day's l>usketl>ull game at Ber
keley will lie sold for the last
time today in the B.A.C. build
ing from !) until 5 o'clock.
A light sale was recorded
yesterday, and many more tick
ets must be sold to insure a
sizeable Stanford rooting sec
tion at the Men's Gymnasium
Friday night.

Coach Bunn, well pleased with the
showing of the Indians against the
Bruins, immediately went to work
laying plans for the second Berkeley i
invasion. He feels that the team
cannot be stopped from here on and
the attitude of the players backs
him up in this supposition. Bunn
had a kind word for the playing of j
Kenny Nobs in the Saturday Bruin
game and plans to use him against
the Bears in the event that Stoefen
will be unable to start.
Nobs Improved Piayer
Nobs has gradually improved in
his play and in practice showed a
remarkable ability to sink side shots I
with either hand. His defensive
ability may be recalled by his guard
ing of John Ball in last year's Bruin
games. Working hard in pi-epara
tion for California, Nobs almost laid
Howie Turner low when the''form
er's elbow found its resting place on
Turner's nose in no easy fashion.
Getting back to U.C.L.A. and
John Ball, Don Liebendorfer comes |
forth with the information that Ball j
has scored 81 points against Stan
ford in four games. Hank Luisetti,
much chagrined by the set-ups he
missed Saturday night, holds only a j
13-point lead on Ball, who moved
into second for high-scoring, j
