of Athletic Control representative
for the two vacancies on Men's
Council, and for the two vacan
cies on Women's Council have
outlined below their qualifications
for the position for which they are
running, and their policies if
elected.
B.A.C. REPRESENTATIVE
Frank Alustiza, varsity football 1
and rugby player for the past three
years: "I feel that the student body
does not carry enough weight on
the B.A.C. If I am elected I will
endeavor to strengthen the position
of the student members. Having
had previous experience in the field
I know the difficulty which will at
tend it, but I shall attempt to give
both major and minor sports a fair
deal."
Bones Hamilton, president of
Scalpers, member of Phi Phi, varsity
baseball captain, football player for
three years: "If I am elected the
students will be truly represented on !
the 8.A.C."
MEN'S COUNCIL
Dave Bardin, Election Board, frosh j
and varsity football: "I believe in i
codifying all the laws as established j
by the Executive Committee and as |
interpreted and enforced by the I
Men's Council. Then a proper pub- j
lication of these laws should be made j
so that the students could read them. I
This would forbear any excuses of
ignorance of the law on the part of
students."
Phil Duffy, managing editor of the
Daily, Convalescent Home Drive
Committee: "Among other things,
recent pilfering of books and maga
zines by students shows a need for
stricter enforcement of honor code.
This enforcement must come from
the students themselves through
Men's Council. My aim is to pro
tect the student majority from such
a pilfering minority."
Carl Grube, teaching assistant in
Guggenheim Laboratory: "It is the
duty of the Men's Council to have
control over all cases of a disciplin
ary nature pertaining to the men
students of Stanford University. I
believe that all any member of the
Men's Council can offer is the appli
cation of careful thought and good
judgment to any case that may come
before it. I pledge my support to
the advancement of this doctrine."
(Jib Hollo way, Cardinal, varsity
debating, Convalescent Home Drive:
"I shall, if re-elected, do my best to
promote the spirit of the Honor
Code among the students and en
force it equitably and mercifully.
I believe that the present traffic
regulations are reasonable and nec
essary, and should be strictly en
forced."
Leroy Wright, senior track man
ager, president of Interclub Coun
cil, vice-president of Toyon Club:
"Men's Council is not a body which
is subject to political fanfare. Rather,
it requires hard, conscientious work,
and every effort toward absolute
fairness. Such is my policy."
WOMEN'S COUNCIL
Mary Bclford, Y.W.C.A., Conval
escent Home Drive Committee: "A
member of the Women's Council
should be sensible and tmbiased in
judgment, and strive to further fair
discipline of women students. I

tion, and therefore if elected I shall
try to fulfill the qualifications."
Dolly Burke, Women's Athletic
Association: "If elected I will sup
port the policies which the Wom
en's Council has instigated during
the past year."
