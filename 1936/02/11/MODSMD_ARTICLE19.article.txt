### 
Candidates for election as Board
of Athletic Control representative
for the two vacancies on Men's
Council, and for the two vacan
cies on Women's Council have
outlined below their qualifications
for the position for which they are
running, and their policies if
elected.
B.A.C. REPRESENTATIVE
Frank Alustiza, varsity football 1
and rugby player for the past three
years: "I feel that the student body
does not carry enough weight on
the B.A.C. If I am elected I will
endeavor to strengthen the position
of the student members. Having
had previous experience in the field
I know the difficulty which will at
tend it, but I shall attempt to give
both major and minor sports a fair
deal."
Bones Hamilton, president of
Scalpers, member of Phi Phi, varsity
baseball captain, football player for
three years: "If I am elected the
students will be truly represented on !
the 8.A.C."
MEN'S COUNCIL
Dave Bardin, Election Board, frosh j
and varsity football: "I believe in i
codifying all the laws as established j
by the Executive Committee and as |
interpreted and enforced by the I
Men's Council. Then a proper pub- j
lication of these laws should be made j
so that the students could read them. I
This would forbear any excuses of
ignorance of the law on the part of
students."
Phil Duffy, managing editor of the
Daily, Convalescent Home Drive
Committee: "Among other things,
recent pilfering of books and maga
zines by students shows a need for
stricter enforcement of honor code.
This enforcement must come from
the students themselves through
Men's Council. My aim is to pro
tect the student majority from such
a pilfering minority."
