# Mid-Quarter Tripper Returns To Peaceful Farm Existence
## 
### Eunice Engelke 
Back from her unexpected two
week vacation to and from Hono
lulu, Stanford's midquarter tripper,
Marian Trosper, affirms that it was
all an accident.
"They didn't find me in a life
boat," Marian said. She would have
gone back with the pilot, but thought
there were immigration laws pre
venting it. So the captain told her
to radiogram her parents.
Following this came a barrage of
radiograms to Oklahoma City from
the Malolo, and back again from a
disbelieving father who had to
phone the Dean of Women's office
first to support the tale that Marian
really was on her way to the islands.
Fearful of a 15-day lockout. Marian
had her father sign her out, so that
fixed that.
After the technicalities were
straightened out, however, Marian,
a full-fiedged passenger, had a

»
"grand lime." Other "celebrities"
were on the boat—movie stars, whom
.she said were "just like they are in
pictures," and they were lots of fun,
j as of course were all the other en
i tertainments on shipboard.
Of course, there was the matter of
! clothes. Nobody likes to wear the
| same thing a week, but her friends
| helped her out until she got to
| Honolulu and its stores. Then she
I "saw" the islands in the two days
! and a half before the Malolo re
j turned. "Honolulu is a place to
j stay a month in," Marian exclaimed
; last night.
"I planned to go to Hawaii Easter
i vacation," she said, "but that's called
I off now. Even though I didn't in-
I tend to go this time, Dad said he had
j to pay for it anyway."
Marian arrived iri San Francisco
Saturday morning, where her father
! met her, and after conferences with
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday,
was reinstated in her classes.
