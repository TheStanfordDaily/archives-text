# Kaulfers Criticizes Language Study
## Declensions Should Not Be Hard, Says Famed Radio Hour Speaker 
### 
French accents and German de
clensions will be no problem to the
foreign language student of the fu
ture, according to Dr. Walter V.
Kaulfers, acting assistant professor
of education who spoke last night
on "The Foreign Language Curri
culum" over KGO.
"Secondary schools will not have
the narrow aim of training students
to read or speak a foreign tongue,"
he explained, "but will lay the foun
dations for an enlightened Ameri
canism by differentiating foreign
cultures."
Makes Appreciation
By giving the high school student
an insight into the past contributions
of foreign peoples to our national
life and their potential contributions
in the future, the subject will supply
an appreciation of foreign and Amer
ican cultures â€”a much better pro
ceedure than that of teaching con
jugations."
As the average pupil doesn't stay
in school long enough to master a
foreign language as a key to national
cultures, it is much more necessary,
according to Dr. Kaulfers, to give
him survey courses as a substitution
for the broadening experiences of
actual visits abroad.
Should He Qualifier
"Foreign language staffs, by virtue
of their special background in study
and travel and avowed interests in
the field of foreign cultures," the
speaker said, "should be particularly
well qualified to teach these courses,
no matter whether in the English
language or the foreign tongue."
