Questioned on their opinions as !

should he returned to the students
as rebates, or utilized for some
other of the suggested projects, the
following men and women ex- I
press greatly divergent systems,
runging from a continuation of the
rebates to the repairing of campus
roads.
Toby Carlin, Phi Delt: "Instead of
having rebates, they should cut down
on the price of the books. That
would not only save the expense and
trouble of the present system, but
would also avoid the necessity lor
such high prices."
Paul True, Encina: "The contri
bution of the Bookstore profits to the
cost of the new theater sounds like
the most reasonable, as well as the
most practical solution of the rebate
problem."
Joan King, Roble: "I think that
the rebate system should be discon
tinued, not only because of the im
practicability of handling so many
separate accounts, but also because
when the whole thing is figured out
it amounts to so little. It would be
better for them to do something I
constructive to the campus, such as !
fixing some of the roads."
lone Collins, Lagunita: "I don't
know. I wish I did. There have been
too many opinions expressed." •
Bill Murray, Toyon: "'I think thai i

the rebates should be continued, be- i
cause, as the students have to buy
their books there, they should have
a chance to share in the profits."
Nancy Pollock, Alpha Phi: "I j
think that the rebate system should
be continued, but that those who live
on the Row should sign their cards
with the names of their houses. This
would help to diminish the expense
of the accounting, and would serve J
as an extra source of income for the
fraternities and sororities. Those !
who live in the halls could receive
the rebates in person, or turn it over
to their organization."
