# TEARS IN ENCINA
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Tears, bitter tears, were shed upon
Encina pillows last Wednesday night
! after feminine fancy had ruthlessly
, picked and chosen its idea of a man.
With cool precision and delibera
tion, the erstwhile female wall
flower cast a discriminating gaze
upon the half-amused countenance
jof the now completely subdued
Hough. Shorn of his pride and
stripped of his vanity, casting fur
tive glances at the elusive Susans as
they whirled past in the arms of 4lie
"other guy," for once he realized
1 that they were not such a bad bunch
j after all, and maybe ihey are a
pretty good looking bevy of beauty
; (now that he is no longer the lord
and master.) Give it to them, girls,
i I'm for you. The Junior Jurist
