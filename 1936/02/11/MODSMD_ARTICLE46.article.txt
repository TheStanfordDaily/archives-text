# Potential Mile Star Begins Big Time Schedule Tomorrow
## Burrows Enters Hunter's Indoor Meet; Will Run Against Nation's Best 
### 
February 12 is a holiday in some
parts of the United States, but Feb
ruary 12 is even more to one Stan
ford .student named Clayton Edson
Burrows.
For tomorrow will mark not only
Ed's coming to the ripe majority age
of 21 voting powers, no more diffi
culty in madhousesâ€”-but his first
varsity competition, the start of what
may become a brilliant athletic ca
reer.
To Kilter Meet
Burrows will be Dink Templeton's
evidence for the next three years
that the Pacific Coast is not wholly
unable to produce a distance run
ner. ffe will enter the two-mile in
Charley Hunter's indoor track meet
tomorrow and aside from the fact
that his first race will be against the
American outdoor record holder,
Norm Bright, and the American in
door record holder, Harold Man
ning, he should do well.
Burrows is in little worse straits
than most of the Stanford entries,
however, as every event is filled with
the cream of western athletes, to say
nothing of the invited celebrities.
Close Dash Prophesied
The 50-yard dash will be a toss
up, going, if the judges can pick
him, to the fellow who gets off his
blocks first. Ray Dean of Stanford,
and Chuck Voigt, running unat
tached, are entitled to as much luck
as anybody.
Jack Weicrshauser in the 300,
Cranston, Mallott, and McCurdy in
the 600, Klopstock in the 50-yard
highs, and Nimmo in the mile are
all up against as good runners as
they are liable to meet ail spring.
Smith To Compete
Humbert Smith, 6-4 high jumper,
will meet Thurber of U.S.C., Les
Steers of the Olympic Club, Jacques
and Thompson of Cal, and other
high shots, but still stands, together
with Weicrshauser, as Stanford's
best chance at a first place.
Cardinal relay entries have been
named as follows: Football relay,
4 men at 135 yards each, Reynolds,
Reisner, Williams, Grayson; open
relay, 4 men at 405 yards each,
Cranston, Kneubuhl, Mailott, Weier
shauser; freshman relay, 4 men at
270 yards each, Thompson, Soltero,
Taggart, Kelley.
Competition for team honors has
been entered by the Olympic Club,
Stanford, California, Fresno State,
U.S.F., and U.S.C.
