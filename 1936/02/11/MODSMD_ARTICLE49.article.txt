INDOOR TRACK DEBUT
TOMORROW NIGHT
Highlights of the birth of the new
sport: Dink Templeton's 15 or so
tracksters starting out the season on
Douglas fir . . . Duel belween the
new bay region quarter-milers —
Jimmy Kneubuhl and Jack Weicr
shauser of Stanford and Archie
Williams, Cal's new light tan sprint
er in the 300 . . . And the duel be
tween Norm Bright, Lochner, and
Manning, plus Card soph Ed Bur
rows, all great runners, in the 26-lap
two-mile . . . Sam Allen, Sam Klop
stock, Tom Moore, Roy Kirkpatrick
in the hurdles, all record holders of
some sort . . . Big Horse Reynolds
sprinting with Bobby Grayson,
Johnny Reisner, and Fred Williams
in the football lettermen relay . . .
Mushy Pollock can't run in that one
'cause he's no letterman . . . But
he'll be favored in his specialty, the
60-yard dash, meeting Ray Dean,
Dubby Holt (Fresno), A! Fitch
(S.C.), and George Anderson.
More things to look for: 300
and 600-yard men trying to hold
the corners on the tiny 135.4-yard
track . . . Ben Eastman and Jim
my Luvalle absent because of re
ported flu . . . and they say Ben is
going to be his old self this spring
—blazing to new records ... A
high high jump bout between our
Humbert Smith, Les Steers, the
Paly High soph, DeWitt Good, the
new Cal transfer, and Pe!os Thur
ber, 6-6 Troy soph . . . Earl
Meadows, Troy's slim potential
world's champ pole vaultcr . . .
The return of Al Blackmail, last
year's Card captain, and Podge
Smith, '31 cap and hurdler ... A
fast frosh sprint team of Dick
Carewe, Harry Soltero, Steve
Taggart, and Roy Thompson—fu
ture varsity stars all.
AS GOES STOEFEN,
SO GOES STANFORD?
Various analyzers around the Pa
vilion these afternoons have been
working on quite a shocking theory.
Shocking because they claim that
when Art Stoefen, the 6-4 blond
center, is "hot" they team can't lose.
More shocking because no mention
is made of Hank Luisetti in the doc
trine.
Now (he Card success has been
for some reason strangely iden
tical and synchronized with the
hot nights of Art. When the lank
Stofe starts making up his mind to
score points in and beyond the
high 'teen, John Bonn can sit
back and smile and worry no more
It was true Stoefen was hot in the
C.O.P. and Utah State games, when
the locals exceeded 70 points per
game.
It was true in the first Ucla game,
in the St. Mary's game ten days ago,
and very emphatically in the two
Bruin tilts of the past week-end.
Stofe was Card high point man
and both of the boys returned
to the Farm with the league lead.
Most of his points are of the tip-in
variety, when he leaps a little higher
and a little surer than anyone else
to wrap his fingernails around the
sphere and eases it in. A shot like
that has been proven repeatedly to
be practically impossible to stop.
And about Luisetti. The above
mentioned theorists kind of leave
Hank out in their enthusiasm.
They forget that Hank is the most
feared man in the conference, that
he is on his way to a new higli
scoring record, that he is the
smoothest ball handler on the
Coast and that when lie sees he
can't make a shot he slips it to
someone else so adroitly that the
ensuing score is marked up on the
scoreboard before the opposition
realizes it.

AS GOES STOEFEN,

Various analyzers around the Pa
vilion these afternoons have been
working on quite a shocking theory.
Shocking because they claim that
when Art Stoefen, the 6-4 blond
center, is "hot" they team can't lose.
More shocking because no mention
is made of Hank Luisetti in the doc
trine.
Now (he Card success has been
for some reason strangely iden
tical and synchronized with the
hot nights of Art. When the lank
Stofe starts making up his mind to
score points in and beyond the
high 'teen, John Bonn can sit
back and smile and worry no more
It was true Stoefen was hot in the
C.O.P. and Utah State games, when
the locals exceeded 70 points per
game.
It was true in the first Ucla game,
in the St. Mary's game ten days ago,
and very emphatically in the two
Bruin tilts of the past week-end.
Stofe was Card high point man
and both of the boys returned
to the Farm with the league lead.
Most of his points are of the tip-in
variety, when he leaps a little higher
and a little surer than anyone else
to wrap his fingernails around the
sphere and eases it in. A shot like
that has been proven repeatedly to
be practically impossible to stop.
And about Luisetti. The above
mentioned theorists kind of leave
Hank out in their enthusiasm.
They forget that Hank is the most
feared man in the conference, that
he is on his way to a new higli
scoring record, that he is the
smoothest ball handler on the
Coast and that when lie sees he
can't make a shot he slips it to
someone else so adroitly that the
ensuing score is marked up on the
