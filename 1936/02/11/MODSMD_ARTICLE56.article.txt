# Frosh Favored In Second Bear Tilt
## 
### 
Victorious in 13 straight games,
Indian frosh basketball men will try
I to add one more to their string at
the expense of California's Cubs in
| the Berkeley gym Friday night. This
I second battle of yearling rivals will
I be a preliminary to the third game
| o!' the varsity series.
j By virtue of their 37-23 win over
; the Bear frosh on the Farm last
I week, Jimmy Bradshaw's team is
| slightly favored. Much of the Pa
| pooses success will depend upon
| whether Phil Zonne maintains his
j 17-point scoring average. Saturday
\ night the Card Babes will meet
j Santa Clara's first-year men in the
! Pavilion.
