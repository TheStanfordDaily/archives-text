## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism Bookstore's Rebate System Should Be Dinged at the A.S.S.U. Election Today 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore, like all communal
enterprises, is subject to the usual amount of
grousing and baby beeves. Old-timers will re
member the days when the favorite sport at
Stanford was a Mellinkolf investigation of the
Bookstore, which, like many MellinkolV in
vestigations, was interesting but got nowhere.
There has always been a fundamental plat
form in the "Stanford credo" that somebody
is getting gravy somewhere. .Inst exactly
where, nobody ever seems to know. Student
investigations have started out gloriously and
fizzled, faced by the usual dazzling displays
of figures and charts presented by the bureau
crats.
As far ;is the Bookstore is concerned all that
h:is ever been validly charged against them
is that they carry it line of merchandise whose
quality is higher than the studtnt wishes to
pay. There has never been any proof that the
prices for the same quality of merchandise are
any higher than in other stores. If the Book
store wishes to lose the student business in
the cheaper lines, it may be credited to the
whimsy of the management, which does not
wish to sully its reputation by stooping low.
Professor Everett P. Lesley, head of the fac
ulty committee in charge of the Bookstore,
has effectively pointed out that the Bookstore

is not run to make a profit. But accidents
will happen, and a profit appeared this year.
Mr. Lesley lias proved that the salaries in the
store are not exorbitant, that student help is
impractical, and that prices cannot he shaved
due to the uncertainty of business enterprise.
It is obvious that the rebate system is un
desirable, since it involves clerical expense
that is wasteful, it does not necessarily return
the profits to those who deserve it, and it is
no incentive to trade with the store because
of its uncertainty.
Pertinent to today's vote on the subject in
the A.S.S.U. election, then, is what to do with
the profit now that we have it. Various sug
gestions have been made. On the ballot are
two: scholarships, and a modern fiction serv
ice to be established under the protective wing
of the Library.
Of the two, the latter seems most valuable.
Stanford students are avid readers of maga
zine fiction, but have no outlet in book fiction,
since the Library is unable to handle modern
fiction under its present set-up.
Hut a vote for either is more desirable than
a reversion to the old rebate system. Its de
lects are many and manifest. Its virtues vio
lated and tarnished.
