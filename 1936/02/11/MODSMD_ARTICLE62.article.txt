•Jim Ludlam, election board chairman,
hopes that most of the .3901) Stanford students
will vote in the A.S.S.I', election today, but of
course tlicv won't.
Apathy is too mild a word to describe inter
est in mid-year elections. Donlgivadamnish
ness is better. The fact that II rather impor
tant posts are ;il stake hasn't proven to be
enough of an incentive to draw very many
students to the law steps polls in the past, tint
there is always hope for the future—and for
today.
And in the interests of raising the election
board's respect for the literacy of student vot
ers, it is also to be hoped that no attempt will
be made to break the all-time record of spoiled
ballots set in the last election when 10 per cent
ol all votes cast were thrown out on techni
calities.
