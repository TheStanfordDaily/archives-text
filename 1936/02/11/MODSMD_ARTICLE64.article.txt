Sixty to 75 per cent of the vagrants entering Cali
fornia come to Los Angeles—L.A. Police Chief Fred
James.
When a Lagunita gal got home late one night last
week, she found waiting for her a slip asking hel
lo call "Ray, - ' at 4(546. So she phoned to 4646 and
asked, "Is Ray there?"
"Who?" answered the puzzled voice at the other end.
"Ray," she repeated.
"My dear young lady (or words to that effect),"
the puzzled voice answered, "this is Ray Lyman Wil
bur's residence."
The dear young lady hung up.
Which reminds me of a story. During the days when
David Starr Jordan strode the campus there was an
'•asy informality pervading the cloistered halls, but
he burning zeal for democracy and enlightenment
made the man a formidable figure even so.
One of the prankish undergrads bet another that he
would not dare call the president by his first name.
After being bolstered up by an unnatural daring, the
callow youth at length approached President Jordan
on Quad one day.
"Hello, David," he said.
"Don t be so formal," was the answer. "Just call
me Dave."
The dear young man hung up.
Indicative of the machine-like precision of the great
rushing machines, is a tale just coming to light from
the Chi Psi Lodge.
During a rushing meeting the name of one youth
was proposed. According to the nominator, the youth
was an outstanding scholar, came from a fine family,
was proficient in athletics, and a good man.
A second backer arose, extolling the virtues of
this noble lad. A scattering of favorable comment was
heard around the room. Finally, in a burst of en
thusiasm, the boys decided to pledge him.
Wait a minute, I don't seem to have his name on
my list,' the rushing chairman interposed.
This provoked a torrent of criticism on the ineffi
ciency of the rushing machine, which brought forth an
apology from the chairman. He said that the duties of
Ihe office were such that there was bound to be con
fusion.
This Was all very fine until the brothers started
looking around for their nugget the next day, when the
Lodgers discovered that they had decided to pledge a
i ace horse, whose name was familiar to the screamers,
but who had never contemplated entering Stanford—
or pledging Chi Psi.
