Students complain that no matter how they eon
serve time, they never seem to have enough in which
to do a proper amount of studying.
A recent New York Times article, "Undergraduate:
A Case Study," treated on the subject of the student
and what he does with his time. The article was based
on data collected from 700 students in a mid-western
college.
It pointed out that the average student spends al
most as many hours in aimless occupations as he does
in attending classes and studying. He uses about 6
hours of the day for leisure.
Out of 29 forms of leisure time amusements, those
favored most by students are "sheer idleness, random
conversations, listening to the radio, 'bull sessions,'
drinking, and cruising around campus in a car." Out
side of dates, the uses three and one
half hours of his time per week in dancing and one and
one-half hours playing bridge.
Contrary to popular belief, very little time is allot
ed to extra-curricular activities by students, the articles
point out. As tor cultural activities, such as attending
lectures and listening to concerts, the average student
finds very little time for them in his crowded week.
In a week of seven days there are 168 hours. Out of
this total the average student uses 20 for class attend
ance, 56 for sleeping, and 21 for eating. This leaves 71
hours with which the student may do as he pleases.
Out of the 71 hours, at least half of the time should go
towards studying and the remaining 31 hours may be
used for recreation.
These figures should start many students on a self
inventory to determine whether or not a proper balance
between loafing and making the most out of college
has been achieved. The results in most instances will
be surprising.
