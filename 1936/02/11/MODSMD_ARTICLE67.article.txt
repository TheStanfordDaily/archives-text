) Dear People:
! Said the editor to me, "Go to the
hospital without publicity or fanfare,
! lie back quietly and observe condi
i tions, then tell the inside of what
the hospital really is."
Quite by coincidence, I had a case
j of flu which developed from a case
of Bourbon I absorbed Saturday
i morning early, so it really was easy
i to fool the doctors and nurses. You
see, I was completely equipped with
! a fever, a consumptive bark, and a
j tongue that looked like somebody's
front lawn after fertilizing. Or may
be they're fooling me.

Naturally the regimentation is
simply killing me. More Ad Build
ing bureaucracy, for instance, in that
we must wait for an engineer to
hook up the radio. My room-mate, a
Cellar hasher and a really outstand
ing pupil of Dr. Hoover, had the
thing working off the record, but we
haven't a suitable serial. Ali aerials
in use, you see, but we've been
promised one as soon as they roll the
next stiff.

There are lots of traditions about
medicine. In the old days, for in
stance, they called hospitals pest
homes. The pests were the germs,

but the A.M.A. has gotten rid of
them, so they put in nurses. Now
the function of a nurse, as I see it,
is to stay up all night and wait for
you to go to sleep. Then she whips
out a thermometer and a mustard
plaster, leans over you lovingly, and
pokes you in the ribs, asks you if
you want anything, and when you
say "No" she gigles slightly and
gives you the works. Very nice lady,
though.

They make you do the funniest
things. Breakfast on time, and
lights out at 11 p.m. Ordinarily, I'm
just getting started around mid
night.
Then they have a garbage can
frolic at 4 a.m. A garbage can frolic
is a scavenger's rushing party; the
nurses rush the garbagers by seeing
how many hits they can make from
the tenth floor. They hold the cans
out the window and wait for an un
suspencting scavenger. If they hit,
they get credit from the undertak
ers; if they miss, they make the
darnedest racket in the world.

them, so they put in nurses. Now
the function of a nurse, as I see it,
is to stay up all night and wait for
you to go to sleep. Then she whips
out a thermometer and a mustard
plaster, leans over you lovingly, and
pokes you in the ribs, asks you if
you want anything, and when you
say "No" she gigles slightly and
gives you the works. Very nice lady,
though.

They make you do the funniest
things. Breakfast on time, and
lights out at 11 p.m. Ordinarily, I'm
just getting started around mid
night.
Then they have a garbage can
frolic at 4 a.m. A garbage can frolic
is a scavenger's rushing party; the
nurses rush the garbagers by seeing
how many hits they can make from
the tenth floor. They hold the cans
out the window and wait for an un
suspencting scavenger. If they hit,
they get credit from the undertak
ers; if they miss, they make the
darnedest racket in the world.

! Said the editor to me, "Go to the
hospital without publicity or fanfare,
! lie back quietly and observe condi
i tions, then tell the inside of what
the hospital really is."
Quite by coincidence, I had a case
j of flu which developed from a case
of Bourbon I absorbed Saturday
i morning early, so it really was easy
i to fool the doctors and nurses. You
see, I was completely equipped with
! a fever, a consumptive bark, and a
j tongue that looked like somebody's
front lawn after fertilizing. Or may
be they're fooling me.

Naturally the regimentation is
simply killing me. More Ad Build
ing bureaucracy, for instance, in that
we must wait for an engineer to
hook up the radio. My room-mate, a
Cellar hasher and a really outstand
ing pupil of Dr. Hoover, had the
thing working off the record, but we
haven't a suitable serial. Ali aerials
in use, you see, but we've been
promised one as soon as they roll the
next stiff.

There are lots of traditions about
medicine. In the old days, for in
stance, they called hospitals pest
homes. The pests were the germs,

but the A.M.A. has gotten rid of
them, so they put in nurses. Now
