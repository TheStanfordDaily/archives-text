# The 						Old Maid' Now Playing At Curran
## 
### 
Guthrie McClintic, who directs
Judith Anderson and Helen Menken
in the 1935 Pulitzer Prize play, "THE
OLD MAID," now playing at the ;
Curran Theater in San Francisco, is ,
the husband of Katharine Cornell,
famous actress.
Mr. McClintic devotes his time al
most exclusively to staging and pro- 1
ducing plays on his own account or ,
supervising the productions of his 1
glamorous wife. "The Old Maid"
represents one of the very few occa- j
sions that he has been prevailed
upon to direct the play of another
producer.
Edith Wharton, one of the most !
popular of American novelists, j
wrote the story upon which Zoe At- j
kins has based her play. That story,
which has the same title as the i
play, was one of four novelettes of '
New York published by Miss Whar- '
ton some years ago. It and "Ethan
Frome" are recognized as her mas- '
terpieces.
The cast of "The Old Maid" is the j
same as that which played in New '
York. Heading it are Judith Ander- j
son and Helen â€¢ Menken), ddstin- i
guished actresses of many Broadway
successes. Miss Anderson's recent
roles include that of Nina Leeds in
"Strange Interlude."
Miss Menken, who has been on
the stage since she was five years
old, was last seen as Queen Eliza
beth in "Mary of Scotland."
