# DEFENDS HIS COACH
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have worked under Mr. Chapin
for a number of years as a debater,
and though in that time I have often
seen him criticized, I have seldom
known the criticism to be justified.
His critics are ordinarily dissatis
fied debaters. . . .
In regard to this affair concerning
the Canadian tour, I think I speak
for a majority of the debaters when
I protest against the obvious injus
tice done to our debate adviser. We
have good reason to believe that
Mr. Chapin was arranging other de

bates for the same tour and was
waiting for replies when the ques
tion of spending $150 fur one debate
came up. At any rate, experience
has taught us that he is no fool. He
knows what ho is doing and can
answer for his actions.
Yours truly,
Debater
