# Track Team To Enter in Indoor Meet
## Cindermen Will Compete With Fastest Runners In United States Tonight 
### Phil Klauber 
Like riding a Texas bronc the
first time you're ever on a horse—
will be the Stanford 1936 track
team's debut in the San Rrancisco
Indoor Championships at the Civic
Auditorium tonight.
The cindermen have not yet
tasted the year's first competition;
they have never before run indoors
on a wooden track, yet here they
are starting it out against the finest
runners in America, perhaps the
toughest competition they will meet
all spring.
Wants Stiff Competition
But that is all conforming to
Coach Dink Tcmpleton's prescrip
tions; he believes that the stiffer the

competition, the harder the men will ;
work. He has told his men to go up j
to the city and give it a try, not to j
beef if they don't place. "We have j
a lot of important meets later in the j
spring."
The meet will be run off on a light
ning schedule, starting at 7:30, with |
the last event, the open 1620-yard
relay, set at 10:30 o'clock.
Cardinal track enthusiasts will j
watch with interest the work of Jack !
Weiershauser and Ed Burrows in the :
300-yard dash and two-mile. These
newcomers have shown themselves I
capable in practice, and if they can
hold the coiners of the 135-yard
track well enough to put in good
efforts, they will be listed as the
backbone of the 1936 team.
Other Star Possibilities
Ray Dean, in the 50, and Chuck
Voight, running unattached in the ,
same race, may catch the judge's J
eyes. Jimmy Kneubuhl and Gordy J
Hyde might sneak into the 300-yard
limelight, while Al Cranston, Bill
McCurdy, and Roy have
equal chances in the 600.
Stanford eyes will look carefully
at Chuck Nimmo in the mile. Nim
mo already has given much promise ;
of return to his 1934 form, and when
in his 1934 form Nimmo is good.
Burrows is in a field of champions j
away over his head in the two-mile, j
but he should have a good time.
Hurdles Present Aces
The K& K boys, Klopstock and
Kingsbury, will enter one of the
feature races of the evening, the 60-
yard high hurdles. They will not
only meet all of the U.C. world rec
ord holders, but Roy Kirpatrick of
Menlo J.C., three-year interscholas
tic all-American hurdler, and Sam
Allen of Oklahoma Baptist, fresh
from victories on the eastern board
tracks.
Humbert Smith will jump against
some 6-6 high jumpers, but stands
an excellent chance to win; Jim
Reynolds, Al Hershey, and Phil
Levy will all be high in the 16-pound
shot finals, and Teeny Ginn is en
tered in the pole vault.
Probable Relay Team
The varsity relay team, four men
at 405 yards each, will probably en
ter Kneubuhl, Cranston, Hyde, and
Weiershauser, while the football
letterman's relay entry, 4 men at
135 yards each, is still doubtful. The
boys who went on the Hawaiian
trip are ineligible to compete, and it
is questionable if an entry will be
made.

track well enough to put in good
efforts, they will be listed as the
backbone of the 1936 team.
Other Star Possibilities
Ray Dean, in the 50, and Chuck
Voight, running unattached in the ,
same race, may catch the judge's J
eyes. Jimmy Kneubuhl and Gordy J
Hyde might sneak into the 300-yard
limelight, while Al Cranston, Bill
McCurdy, and Roy have
equal chances in the 600.
Stanford eyes will look carefully
at Chuck Nimmo in the mile. Nim
mo already has given much promise ;
of return to his 1934 form, and when
in his 1934 form Nimmo is good.
Burrows is in a field of champions j
away over his head in the two-mile, j
but he should have a good time.
Hurdles Present Aces
The K& K boys, Klopstock and
Kingsbury, will enter one of the
feature races of the evening, the 60-
yard high hurdles. They will not
only meet all of the U.C. world rec
ord holders, but Roy Kirpatrick of
Menlo J.C., three-year interscholas
tic all-American hurdler, and Sam
Allen of Oklahoma Baptist, fresh
from victories on the eastern board
tracks.
Humbert Smith will jump against
some 6-6 high jumpers, but stands
an excellent chance to win; Jim
Reynolds, Al Hershey, and Phil
Levy will all be high in the 16-pound
shot finals, and Teeny Ginn is en
tered in the pole vault.
Probable Relay Team
The varsity relay team, four men
at 405 yards each, will probably en
ter Kneubuhl, Cranston, Hyde, and
Weiershauser, while the football
letterman's relay entry, 4 men at
135 yards each, is still doubtful. The
boys who went on the Hawaiian
trip are ineligible to compete, and it
is questionable if an entry will be
made.
Like riding a Texas bronc the
first time you're ever on a horse—
will be the Stanford 1936 track
team's debut in the San Rrancisco
Indoor Championships at the Civic
Auditorium tonight.
The cindermen have not yet
tasted the year's first competition;
they have never before run indoors
on a wooden track, yet here they
are starting it out against the finest
runners in America, perhaps the
toughest competition they will meet
all spring.
Wants Stiff Competition
But that is all conforming to
Coach Dink Tcmpleton's prescrip
tions; he believes that the stiffer the

competition, the harder the men will ;
work. He has told his men to go up j
to the city and give it a try, not to j
beef if they don't place. "We have j
a lot of important meets later in the j
spring."
The meet will be run off on a light
ning schedule, starting at 7:30, with |
the last event, the open 1620-yard
relay, set at 10:30 o'clock.
Cardinal track enthusiasts will j
watch with interest the work of Jack !
Weiershauser and Ed Burrows in the :
300-yard dash and two-mile. These
newcomers have shown themselves I
capable in practice, and if they can
hold the coiners of the 135-yard
track well enough to put in good
efforts, they will be listed as the
backbone of the 1936 team.
