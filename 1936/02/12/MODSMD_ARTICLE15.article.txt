# Ex Committee, ASSU Officers Assume Posts
## Barnstormers To Serve As Extra-academic Society; To Give Spring Musical 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Frank Fullenwider, father of the !
present A.S.S.U. constitution, left
his mewling foundling to shift for ;
itself on the foi bidding steps of the
Old Union, when his term as grad
uate member of Ex Committee ex
pired at the meeting last night.
The soiree was <itherwisc
marked by approval of election
returns, and the back-handed j
recognition of Barnstormers,
spring musical drama society.
Three years ago, Fullenwider,
Crompton Bangs, and Elinor Kahn
reorganized Stanford's substantive j
law to include representation for
growing numbers of women, to lib- I
eralize "Thou Shalt Not" regulations
of Men's and Women's Councils,
and to make various shifts in Dra
matics and Publication Council set
ups.
On the recommendation last night
of Student Manager Bob Gros, who \
pointed out that the Great Com- 1
moner's traditional dissenting vote i
had been an enlightening force in
the legislative councils, Ex Com
mittee voted full-hearted recogni
tion for his valuable services.
Fullenwider exercised his usual
prerogative. His last official , legis
lative act was a dissenting vote to >
keep the motion from being unani
mous.
Sideline observers commented
that Fullenwider's forlorn found
ling, already amended, reamended
and rereamended, might not suf- '
fer by its father's absent, but that Ex,[
Committee would miss the stimu- j
lating clarification of issues around
the oval table caused by his con
scientious objections. Last night's
meeting was the last time for Ster
ling Cottrell and Adrienne Johnston
also.
Campus dramatic circle?, already
infested with a plethora of societies
for the benefit and uplift of the !
drama, will get one more benefitter J
and uplifter, BARNSTORMERS,
whose backers pointed out, is really
going to benefit and uplift. Barn
stormers will do this by serving as
an extra-academic society for the
training of students in the presenta
tion of musical shows, and as a social
society for the mutual entertainment
of those students.
Barnstormers was organized out |
of the nucleus of last year's sue- ,
cessful "Follies Bourgeois," and will
present another show this spring.
Representation of Barnstormers |
on Dramatic Council must wait un
til the members can prove to an
Ex Committee which has nine of its I
by-law passing members present,
' that the present Dramatic Council
i is not unwieldy and inefficient.
