# Creamer To Push Proposal Grad Named for Ex Committee
## New Grad Man 
### 
The proposed new plan for a
i "functional" Ex Committee will be
placed before the student body as
soon as possible, Dick Creamer, its
proponent ind newly elected grad
uate member of Ex Committee,
stated last nifcht.
"I shall introduce the motion my
i self," he said. "If it does not pass
| Ex Committee, then I shall circulate
a petition until the requisite 150
j signatures are secured to put it be
| fore a student vote.
"Students Want It"
"The student body wants the plan,
I am sure,' he added. "It was the
usual apathy tl.at kept the students
from the panel discussion Thursday
night."
Of his ow.i election to office yes
terday, Creamer said: "If the stu
dent body i.i discriminating and in
telligent, I was elected on the basis
of this plan and given a mandate to
' present it. If, on the other hand, tho
; student body is not discriminating
J and if it cast its votes for me on a

personality basis, then the present
system of electing Ex Committee
members surely needs revision."
Won't Be Changed
The plan will not be changed
from the way it wa.s originally
drawn lip, Creamer declared. He
considers i( as good as possible in
its present form.
Princeton and the University of
California find the functional type of
committee a great improvement over
the representative type, according to
Creamer.
"It must be understood," lie said,
"that equal representation will not
exist under the new plan. The main
idea is to secure efficiency, not rep
resentation. The problem is whether
we shall have a body which gives
any student a chance to participate
in student government, or whether
we shall have an efficient group
which can decide intelligently the
problems constantly coming before
it."
