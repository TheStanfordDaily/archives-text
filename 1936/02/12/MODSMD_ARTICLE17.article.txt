# Vote Fails To Solve Disposal Of Store Profits
## Student Aid Proposal Gets Plurality; Rebates Also Receive Strong Support 
### 
Solution of the Bookstore rebate
problem still was lacking last night
after tabulation of ballots, although
a plurality of first choices indicated
student opinion in favor of donating
the surplus money to the scholarship
fund for student aid.
Reports on first choices in the
preferential voting showed 403 in
favor of the scholarship fund dona
tion, 381 for the suggestion to con
tinue the present policy of refunding
profits to holders of purchase slips,
265 for the plan to establish and j
operate a loan library of novels, non- |
fiction, and books u.sed in Stanford
courses, and (>9 for various other |
proposals.
Road Work Suggested
Space was provided on the ballots
for voters to write in their own sug
gestions. These were chiefly for im
proving campus roads or eliminat
ing the sales tax on books.
Professor E. P. Lesley of the Book
store Board of Trustees, when in
formed of the voting results, said,
"It seems to me that the number of j
first choices for each suggestion on j
the ballot is not sufficient to indi- j
cate a definite student opinion. |
Since the voting was of the prefer
ential type, another tabulation
might throw many second choices
over to other proposals."
Ballot To Be Influence
"In my opinion the Board of Trust
ees will be influenced to a consid
erable extent by this voting, because
it requested that the ballots be
placed before the student body," he
added.
Election Chairman Jim Ludlam
said another count of the ballots
would be made if officials requested
it.
