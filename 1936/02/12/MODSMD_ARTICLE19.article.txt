# Ship's Mystery Still Unsolved
## Official Board of Inquiry Quizzes Ship Company, Reaches No Conclusion 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11 (/P).â€”
An Army Beard of Inquiry delved
today into the strange disappearance
of Captain Edgar S. McLellan from
the transport Republic as she neared
port yesterday.
The widow, Mrs. Louise De Pue
McLellan, said she was positive "it
was not suicide." The 60-year-old
ship commander and veteran in the
Army Transport Service "alwnys
considered such things completely
foolish," she said, and had "every
thing" to live for.
"It just doesn't make sense to me.
He didn't drink, never gambled,
never even smoked. He told me of
several people who jumped over
board from his ships ;nid how 'silly'
they were. I don't know what hap
pened. I can't even imagine. I only
know he was kind and good and
generous."
Behind a wall of official secrecy,
the inquiry board met this morning
to question officers and crew of the
vessel.
