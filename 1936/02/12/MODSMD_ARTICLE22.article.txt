### Gray Creveling 
LOS ANGELES has the jitters.
Angelenos can sec 811,000 hoboes j
(the membership of the Interna
tional Itinerant Workers, The Ho
boes of America) swarming toward
their palm-draped doors.
Good old southern hospitality
seems to have taken a nasty twist
as sharpshooting Police Chief Davis j
of l#os Angeles organized a foreign |
legion to patrol Truckee, Bishop, j
lily the, and Yuma.
And the hoboes are sore!
Jeff Davis, Jungle Judge, and
King of Hoboes (elected for life)
has told his attorneys to see that the
hoboes get their constitutional rights
in L A. courts.
How the state can keep the va
grants out by other than illegal
means is hard to see. An L A. attor
ney claims the bum-blockade is
legal. Undoubtedly. Just like dope
peddling.
Jittery LA. can hardly be blamed
for its case of the jumps. Baron
stuffed shirts presents a picture no
Square becomes so crowded that
hoboes will overflow into the lobby
of his hotel.
AL SMITH lining himself up
with the Liberty Leaguers and other
The United Mine Workers of Amer
more incongruous than the one that
would be presented if Hoover were
to side with the Democrats in 1940.
The United iMne Workers of Amer
ica have pledged a portion of their
membership fees to help re-elect
President Roosevelt.
Not many steps away from this
sort of thing is the formation of an
American Labor Party which, if it
did not have its own candidate for
the White House, would at least
unite in throwing its voting strength
one way or another, easily becom
ing the controlling factor of local
and national elections.
THE CALIFORNIA State Repub
lican platform advocated: . . with
drawal of recognition of Soviet Rus
sia" (at least they deign to capi
talize the name of the country).
An ostrich hides its head. And
flutters its differential in the breeze.
California Republicans flutter and
want to hide Russia.
What kind of an animal does that
make California Republicans?
Withdrawal of American recogni
tion might easily become the worst
international insult in history.
The Queen of Russia refused to
recognize the independent American
colonies back in the 1770'5, and the
U.S. went unrecognized by Russia
for 30 years.
"What ideas they have! All men
are created equal! The upstarts!"
That's what she thought of us.
