# Women Awe Star Debater; So He Flees
## 
### 
Jim Reynolds, varsity debater
and track star, "darn near died"
Monday night.
When he and Jean Halliburton
went to San Jose to debate a
women's team on the Congress
over- riding-Supreme-Court ques
tion, he didn't realize that he would
be "the only guy in the house."
The Y.W.C.A. hall was packed
with scores of older women, the
three feminine debaters, and Rey
nolds. They asked him afterward
to stay for something to eat, but
he didn't. He lied.
