# Fake Money Made In Prison Printshop
## 
### 
From Seattle, Wash., straight to I
California's famed San Quentin
Prison federal officers yesterday had
traced an amazing counterfeiting j
ring which used the prison's print j
shop and photography laboratory for
printing near-perfect $10 bills.
Three men, all paroled from San
Quentin, were arrested for making
arid passing the bills. All had
worked in the San Quentin print 1
shop or photography laboratory.
The investigating officers believe
the counterfeiting machine still is in
operation. How the bills recovered
were taken from the prison, and just
where they were made still is a mys
tery.
Fifty-one bills have been recov
ered, the lirst in Seattle, and 14 in
the possession of Dan R. Wilson, pa
roled convict, who was traced
through his taxi-riding activities.
He paid for 10 rides with fake bills.
Wilson named Clifford L. Parr,

another paroled man, as his part
ner in making the bills in prison.
Parr, arrested in Sacramento, denied
the charges. Third man arrested was
Thomas Bell, who also passed a bill
to a taxi driver.
The bills, some of which are be
lieved still in circulation, were du
plicates of Federal Reserve Bank
of New York certificates.
