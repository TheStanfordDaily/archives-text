# Norm Bright Runs, Flies, and Teaches
## Former Stanford Student Leaves for New York After City Meet Tonight 
### Phil Klauber 
So often has the Daily linotyper
! set up "Norm Bright, ineligible Stan- :
i ford student," or "Norm Bright, for- |
mer Stanford student," that it is i
often rumored that he now puts them
out in dozen lots. Who is this guy
Bright, and why does Stanford claim '
| him, when he never represented the
| Farm anywhere?
Norman Bright is a teacher of i
i ninth grade English in Fremont
j High School, Sunnyvale. But be
j sides earning his living by pounding j
j sentence structure into the sleepy j
I kids down the highway, Blight is a j
| trackman, a versatile one, but spe
cializing in the longer distance runs
| —two and three miles, and just now
I pointing for the 5000-meter Olym
| pic run at Berlin.
His career started as most out
j standing track careers seem to start j
—he went out for track to fulfill
| physical ed requirements at Bel-
I lingham State Normal School,
j Washington. Then, as the story goes, 1
his first mile was a 4:40. which is a ;
mile at a faster clip than some guys 1
: can run across the street.
During the 1934-35 school year I
j Bright was doing graduate work at i
Stanford in education, and would]
| come out three or four times a week ;
j to plod around the old Angell Field j
j track, to beat anyone who wanted
! to race him at any distance, or to ;
j run against time for his own amuse- ;
I merit and training.
| Norm ran a 9:22, a 9:20, and fi
! nally a 9:IS to fulfill his ambition of
cracking 9:20, all of them below the
Pacific Coast Collegiate record.
Then when school let out, Bright
began to cut his times: he set his
personal mile record of 4:14.4 in the
j Pacific Coast A.A.U. meet in San
Diego, went east to the N.C.A.A. and
several invitational meets, finally
achieved what is still his greatest
triumph—the fastest two-mile ever

run by an American, 9:13.2 before
sailing to travel the European ex
hibition circuit with Venzke and
other American trackmen.
That brings us down to the pres
ent. Eastern track entrepreneurs
realize their fields are not complete
without him; hence the English
classes in Sunnyvale are suffering.
He flew east to New Orleans for a
third place in December, was fifth in
the Wanamaker Mile at Madison
Square Garden two weeks ago, and
tonight, an hour after he runs in the
two-mile of the San Francisco In
door Championships, will be on a
plane again for New York.
This week's trip will last longer—
lie will run in the N.Y.A.C. mile next
Saturday night, and then will stay
over a week for the A.A.U. 5000-
meter indoor championship on Feb
ruary 22. Both runs will be held in
Madison Square Garden, New York;
his passage is split between the east
ern hosts and the Olympic Club of
San Francisco, under whose colors
he runs.

the Wanamaker Mile at Madison
Square Garden two weeks ago, and
tonight, an hour after he runs in the
two-mile of the San Francisco In

plane again for New York.
This week's trip will last longer—
lie will run in the N.Y.A.C. mile next
Saturday night, and then will stay
over a week for the A.A.U. 5000-

Norm Bright
So often has the Daily linotyper
! set up "Norm Bright, ineligible Stan- :
i ford student," or "Norm Bright, for- |
mer Stanford student," that it is i
often rumored that he now puts them
out in dozen lots. Who is this guy
Bright, and why does Stanford claim '
| him, when he never represented the
| Farm anywhere?
Norman Bright is a teacher of i
i ninth grade English in Fremont
j High School, Sunnyvale. But be
j sides earning his living by pounding j
j sentence structure into the sleepy j
I kids down the highway, Blight is a j
| trackman, a versatile one, but spe
cializing in the longer distance runs
| —two and three miles, and just now
I pointing for the 5000-meter Olym
| pic run at Berlin.
His career started as most out
j standing track careers seem to start j
—he went out for track to fulfill
| physical ed requirements at Bel-
I lingham State Normal School,
j Washington. Then, as the story goes, 1
his first mile was a 4:40. which is a ;
mile at a faster clip than some guys 1
: can run across the street.
During the 1934-35 school year I
j Bright was doing graduate work at i
Stanford in education, and would]
| come out three or four times a week ;
j to plod around the old Angell Field j
j track, to beat anyone who wanted
! to race him at any distance, or to ;
j run against time for his own amuse- ;
I merit and training.
| Norm ran a 9:22, a 9:20, and fi
! nally a 9:IS to fulfill his ambition of
cracking 9:20, all of them below the
Pacific Coast Collegiate record.
Then when school let out, Bright
began to cut his times: he set his
personal mile record of 4:14.4 in the
j Pacific Coast A.A.U. meet in San
Diego, went east to the N.C.A.A. and
several invitational meets, finally
achieved what is still his greatest
triumph—the fastest two-mile ever

run by an American, 9:13.2 before
sailing to travel the European ex
hibition circuit with Venzke and
other American trackmen.
That brings us down to the pres
ent. Eastern track entrepreneurs
realize their fields are not complete
without him; hence the English
