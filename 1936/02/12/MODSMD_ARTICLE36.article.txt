While everybody's pondering the
weighty questions of whether Hank
Luisetti, Art Stoefen, Gyp Turner,
or Boh Herwig is the big reason for
the Card success or how we're going
to win the conference, this colyuni
will lighten the atmosphere with a
little sex.
It was down South last Saturday
in one of the svelte Bev. Hills
hotels. The team had gone great
guns the night before. So had John
Goon Ball, but we can omit that
because the Stanfords won.
Itnl lit get on with this loose
yarn, some of the hoys walked into
the lobby after a good night's
shut-eye. Hank was among them
and wasn't he surprised when 10,
from out of the void as it were,
came litis awe-stricken, gushing
voice of a fair young maiden say
ing. "Why Hank, hello-o-o-o," or
something like that.
Now this great basketball player
is a great basketball player and a
.swell guy and all that, but when a
quiet, unassuming fellow like him
hears adulation of this sort from the
storied heroine in an altogether
strange hotel and strange (no gag)
town, why he is not going to show
the cairn, benign poise of the Clark
Gobble breed.
And especially when the other
Stanfords around were laughing
very hard and making queer noises
at Hank, Hunk felt a burning hank
ering to get out somewhere where
he could think this thing over.
But there was the gal, stand
ing very close and looking up at
him with eyes like limpid pools
and when Hank looked again he
saw it was none other than an old
high school chum of his from
Galileo.
So Hank was a little relieved, and
introduced her to the captain and
Mr. Bunn, breathed a little easier,
and is reported to have spent the
most of his waking hours, except
when playing basketball, with the
babe.
THEN SPARKY ROBERTSON is
the other case in point. Sparky is
from Garberville (near the Eel
River), not Santa Rosa, and his name
b Harold. His story will get less
space here, because all that could
be found out in a bull session with
some of the players is that he is
supposed to have gone around with
an M.G.M. bathing beauty down
there. That's pretty good at that,
though.
Sunday the players wont swim
ming with Don Moulton, '37, who is
a swell fellow and just getting on
his feet at'tci a serious sickness last
summer. He is weighing about 190
pounds, looking fine, and will prob
ably come back to school next fall.
THE INDOOR TRACK MEET'S
TONIGHT, and will be good stuff.
Practically as big as the N.C.2-A. at
Berkeley last July. There will bo
guys who have run, jumped, and
thrown just about as good as the
names on the present record books.
You'll be able to really get a
good look at some of these boys,
too, because everybody, including
you, the judges, timers, reporters,
popcorn salesmen, and the atli -
letcs will all he stuffed into the
S.E. Auditorium, which is the
genuine all-purpose edifice of the
Bay Region, having been used
variously for horse shows, dog
shows, auto shows, basketball
games, lights, Cambodian balls,
operas, balls, and
symphony concerts.
Take a good look at six of the
newer boys: Jack Weiershauser, Ar
chie Williams, and Jim Kneubuhl in
the 300, Ed Burrows in the two
mile, and Humbert Smith and Delos
Thurber in the high jump. They'll be
