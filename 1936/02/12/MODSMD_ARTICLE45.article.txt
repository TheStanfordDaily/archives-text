# Cocky Team Rumor Dispelled by Bunn
## Zonne or Nobs May Start As Art Stoefen Suffering with Flu; Luisetti In 
### 
"Those U.C.L.A. games were too
I close for that. No, the boys aren't
1 getting the swell-head."
' With these words John Bunn dis
| pelled rumors that his Indian bas
ketball team was cocky about the
I California game Friday night. The
I boys have clear memories not only
j of two tough struggles with the

Bruins but also of a 39-35 beating at
the Bears' hands two weeks ago.
Stoefen Has Flu
A more legitimate source of worry
is the condition of Art Stoefen, lanky
center who is suffering from a mild
attack of flu at present.
"If he isn't in shape to play, I may
start' either Bob Zonne or Ken Nobs, ,
or Nobs may be the center with i
Zonne at guard," continued the i
genial Indian coach.
Starting Line-up
Certain to face the Bears, barring
broken legs or something equally !
serious, are Angelo "Hank" Luisetti
and Howie Turner at forward. Jack j
Calderwood, a thorn in the U.C.L.A. j
flesh Saturday night, is an odds-on i
favorite for one guard post.
Sparky Robertson is likely to play
a large part of the Bear contest, and
may start. Captain Dinty Moore is
still another versatile man, now
playing either forward or guard.
"He's a good shotâ€”that's why," j
said Bunn when asked why he
thought many fans liked Dinty bet- i
ter at forward. '
