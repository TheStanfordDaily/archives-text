# Twiggs Explains Medal System
## Places Golfers in Better Position To Qualify For Major Tournament Play 
### 
At the end of the third week of his
new .system of cumulative medal
play, Coach Eddie Twiggs yesterday
gave his reasons for the switch from
the match ladder play to his new
type of intrateam competition.
'"The change was made chiefly for
the purpose of improving the type
of medal play among members of
the team. The object of this is to
place them in ;i better position to
quality m match play tournaments,"
said the maestro. Each player is in
weekly competition with the rest of
the team.
The practical results of this new
type of weekly play will be seen
when the Stanford team invades the
Pebble Beach course for the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Golf tourna
ment to be held there later in the
month.
