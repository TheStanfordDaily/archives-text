# Band To Play At Cal Battle Friday
## 
### 
Representing Stanford Friday
night at the third California basket
hall game will be the Cardinal 40-
piece brass band, A! M;isters an
nounced yesterday.
The band will toot during time
outs to try and drive away the evil
jinx spirits that have dogged Stan
ford hoop teams in the Berkeley
800 Pavilion ever since the inception
of that building, and will try to
outblast the big Bear band that has
always cheered the Pricemen on to
victory.
