# Editor Speaks On Asia Crisis
## Rowell Says U.S. Hovers Between Eastern, World Clashes; Nations Tense 
### 
"There is a world crisis right now,
and we're led from it to the Asiatic
crisis, and right back again,"
quipped Chester Rowell, editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle, in his
speech on the far eastern situation
in the Assembly Hall last night.
To prove his point, Mr. Rowell
spoke of the conditions now prevail
ing in the major nations. Of the
United States, he said, "We are fac
ing a crisis in America ourselves—
wondering whether inflation will
bring u.-> a boom, or blow us up!"
"Who knows when war will come
across the Atlantic," he questioned,
"and what will be its outcome?"
Speaking of individual countries,
the editor affirmed that the Near
East is no problem—but that in the
Far East is the great clash of Rus
sia, Japan, and China, focusing first
on Manchuria, and now threatening
to involve the rest of the world.
"My words may indicate I don't
like the Japanese army — and I
don't," added Mr. Rowell, "but I do
like the Japanese government and
the Japanese people." There has
been a long struggle in that coun
try between the army, the navy, and
the government, and the army pre
cipitated the Manchurian crisis just
to gain more domestic control at
home, the editor declared.
