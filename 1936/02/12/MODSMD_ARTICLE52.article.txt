# Equality Among Students Too Vital To Be Ruined by Petty Campaign Squabbles
## 
### 
A Vox Cam pi letter today brings up several
points — both relevant and irrelevant — di
rectly concerning campaigning in elections,
but indirectly touching on the much more
vital point of social equality among all stu
dents.
The Vox Campi writer claims it "is not 1111-
traditional for Hall men to distribute 'straight
tickets' (»n Hall candidates," and asserts that
this is necessary, since "they don't have house
meetings."
All of which is granted, bid irrelevant to
the point raised in yesterday's front page edi
torial. The gripe there was not against distri
bution of marked ballots in balls, but against
llic use of paid publicity and printed hand
bills. Hncina is fair campaign territory, but
that type of campaign, as Flection Chairman
Jim Ludlam pointed out, is not considered
"cricket."
Along the same lines, the Vox Campi allu
sion to llic editor's "How affiliations" is both
beside the point and very much to-the-point.
I( is beside the point in that the question
of printed campaign propaganda is not yet a
Hall-How light; the offense was so obviously
and intentionally a breach of the Farm's ver
sion of ethics that the detail of whether it was
sponsored by Hall, How, or Independents is

insignificant.
The allusion was pertinent, however, since
a race of gaudiness easily could develop into
a hitter Hall-How feud. It will he generally
conceded that each hall harbors a certain
amount of wealth, that each house has its
moneyed brothers or sisters. If these re
sources were lined up during campaigns, nei
ther Hall nor How would gain more than a
slight advantage.
The person who would suffer obviously is
the individual candidate—in either Hall or
How—who happens to be less "well heeled"
than his fellow-clubman or fraternity brother,
as the case might be.
Although there is 110 custom that rules out
political campaigning, there is a vital tradi
tion that bars the spending of money on cam
paign propaganda.
Though the slight expense involved in elec
tioneering stunts seems trivial, its importance
becomes magnified when it is seen to exem
plify a basic Stanford tradition.
This custom and all that it signifies arc
essential to Stanford. If the fundamental
principles of the tradition of equality among
students are ever discarded, the spirit that has
grown up as vital to the Farm will suffer a
blow that will distort it beyond recognition.

sion to llic editor's "How affiliations" is both
beside the point and very much to-the-point.
I( is beside the point in that the question
of printed campaign propaganda is not yet a
Hall-How light; the offense was so obviously
and intentionally a breach of the Farm's ver
sion of ethics that the detail of whether it was
sponsored by Hall, How, or Independents is

insignificant.
The allusion was pertinent, however, since
a race of gaudiness easily could develop into
a hitter Hall-How feud. It will he generally
conceded that each hall harbors a certain
amount of wealth, that each house has its
moneyed brothers or sisters. If these re
sources were lined up during campaigns, nei
ther Hall nor How would gain more than a
slight advantage.
The person who would suffer obviously is
the individual candidate—in either Hall or
How—who happens to be less "well heeled"
than his fellow-clubman or fraternity brother,
as the case might be.
Although there is 110 custom that rules out
political campaigning, there is a vital tradi
tion that bars the spending of money on cam
paign propaganda.
Though the slight expense involved in elec
tioneering stunts seems trivial, its importance
becomes magnified when it is seen to exem
plify a basic Stanford tradition.
This custom and all that it signifies arc
essential to Stanford. If the fundamental
principles of the tradition of equality among
students are ever discarded, the spirit that has
grown up as vital to the Farm will suffer a
blow that will distort it beyond recognition.
A Vox Cam pi letter today brings up several
points — both relevant and irrelevant — di
rectly concerning campaigning in elections,
but indirectly touching on the much more
vital point of social equality among all stu
dents.
The Vox Campi writer claims it "is not 1111-
traditional for Hall men to distribute 'straight
tickets' (»n Hall candidates," and asserts that
this is necessary, since "they don't have house
meetings."
All of which is granted, bid irrelevant to
the point raised in yesterday's front page edi
torial. The gripe there was not against distri
bution of marked ballots in balls, but against
llic use of paid publicity and printed hand
bills. Hncina is fair campaign territory, but
that type of campaign, as Flection Chairman
Jim Ludlam pointed out, is not considered
"cricket."
