# The 						Winners Might Act on His Suggestion
## 
### 
It is an ironical note that the one candidate
for Men's Council with a constructive idea in
his platform was defeated in yesterday's gen
eral election.
The idea was the codification of laws ad
ministered by the Councils and posting them
so that students would know what laws they
are currently violating.
Not so ironical, possibly, is the fact that Tin:
Daily has advocated this plan, particularly in
relation to traffic, since the beginning of last
quarter.
Men's Council has seemed favorable to the
idea, but to date has not bothered with it. To
listen to the suggestion of a defeated candidate
would be a wise move 011 the part of the
Council.
