# Show-down Needed In Congested Drama Set-up
## 
### 
Corner drug-stores in the typical small
town have come to have a peculiar similarity
to Stanford dramatic societies—they're equal
ly numerous, and they overlap in function.
Last night Kx Committee gave official recog
nition to "Barnstormers," a drama group or
ganized to put 011 spring musical shows. That
brings the total up to four —Ram's Head,
Sword and Sandals, Masquers, and now Barn
stormers.
The newest addition to the drama group list
is not to be ridiculed; it will undoubtedly
prove its reason for existence as have all the
others at one time or another. But by proving
that a new society was necessary, it also
clearly proved that definite reorganization is
needed in the entire dramatic honorary set-up.
Dramatics Council is getting virtually clut
tered with different and sometimes competing
organizations.
The entrance of Barnstormers into the
drama arena complicates filings further and
necessitates a show-down in which all four
societies either must justify their separate
existence or consolidate.
