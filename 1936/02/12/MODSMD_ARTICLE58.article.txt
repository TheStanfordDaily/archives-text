For a long, long time college men have seriously
1 debated the pros and cons of hell week and violence
in manipulating the affairs of fraternity house per
sonnel. . . .
But progress is slow! And men on the Oregon
! campus raise up in their he-jewelled glory and swear
| that the tub is mightier than the tongue. And they
' continue to hover over a dusty piano, or an unlayed
j fire, or an unanswered telephone, like a son of God,
who, chosen by the system, must guard the physical
! habits of the youngster else he degenerate into a lost
soul who is in college for the purpose of acquiring an
education, as a gentleman and not a page-boy.
The average kid who is in quest of a real, sub
stantial, beneficial education wants to know some
thing of the world. He wants to know what other
people think, what his brothers think, how they react
to communism, prostitution, literature, or politics.
And in a living group where all the time is spent in
displaying physical prowess, thore is little opportunity
1 to find out what the brothers think if indeed (hey
think at all.
But the system gets the best of them. Even the
seniors who move out of the house because of "dis
tractions" rally around and appraise at the end of a
paddle the nether regions of the youngster who must
be taught to take it.
And when seniors, lacking in patience and expert in
buck passing, toss the big job down to the juniors and
sophomores, most of whom retain the lingering nos
talgia of the tub or the paddle, the cycle rolls on
and boys continue to trickle out of fraternity houses,
perfectly at ease in society but timorous about the
conquest of life, from which they have been isolated
for four years behind the walls of a secret organization
or textbooks, that when undiscussed, are transferred
to examination papers and forgotten.

| that the tub is mightier than the tongue. And they
' continue to hover over a dusty piano, or an unlayed
j fire, or an unanswered telephone, like a son of God,
who, chosen by the system, must guard the physical
! habits of the youngster else he degenerate into a lost
soul who is in college for the purpose of acquiring an
education, as a gentleman and not a page-boy.
The average kid who is in quest of a real, sub
stantial, beneficial education wants to know some
thing of the world. He wants to know what other
people think, what his brothers think, how they react
to communism, prostitution, literature, or politics.
And in a living group where all the time is spent in
displaying physical prowess, thore is little opportunity
1 to find out what the brothers think if indeed (hey
think at all.
But the system gets the best of them. Even the
seniors who move out of the house because of "dis
tractions" rally around and appraise at the end of a
paddle the nether regions of the youngster who must
be taught to take it.
And when seniors, lacking in patience and expert in
buck passing, toss the big job down to the juniors and
sophomores, most of whom retain the lingering nos
talgia of the tub or the paddle, the cycle rolls on
and boys continue to trickle out of fraternity houses,
perfectly at ease in society but timorous about the
conquest of life, from which they have been isolated
for four years behind the walls of a secret organization
or textbooks, that when undiscussed, are transferred
to examination papers and forgotten.
