## SO WE MAY REMEMBER WHAT IS FORGOTTEN 
### 
j Today is a holiday ... so the !
I calendar says . . . and so the calen
dar says alone . . . for no one else
. . . save the bankers, maybe . . .
remember that Honest Abe was
born on this day.

Remember the blithe fourth grade !
j days when school let out at noon '
after we'd all gathered in the as- ;
j sembly hall to chant "I pledge al- j
j legiance" and hear teacher's pet re
j cite the Gettysburg address? The ;
I fourth grade is the beginning of for- |
! getting for many things, but Lin- I
I coin's birthday suffers worst.

And remember Mary Livingstone's
I epic poem which says: "Christmas
j has its Santy Claus, and Valentine's t
Day has its cupid, but Labor Day
i you haven't got anything—don't you
; think that's stupid." She might just !
i as well have said Lincoln's birthday j
in spite of sacrilege, Yankee de- !
j scendents, and bank clerks who like j
to lock doors on the slightest pre
' tense.

! In most places Lincoln might just
i as well have never been born, spe- 1
; cifically speaking, so far as his birth- '
' day being remembered is concerned.
But such as it is docs not mean such
as it should be.

Being the grandson of an ardent !
bluecoat who shot at his first-cousin
with a cannon in 1807, I would like
to see something done about this
I forgotten day—something with ac- i

! tion in it like fire-crackers on the
j Fourth of July and comic valentines
: on Valentine's day—something with
1 noise, sentiment, humor, or patriot
ism — anything that won't require
anyone to do any thinking.

| Lincoln loved a good story as did
! no other great man. For every let
; ter to Mrs. Bixby and Douglas dc
! bate, the civil war president got of!
\ a hundred good stories. Ke told them |
| in cabinet meetings, on the speak- >
| ers platform, in moments of grave I
j crisis. The value he placed on a j
I good laugh knew no limits. Would |
i not Lincoln, then, have liked to think
! his birthday would be remembered
with a smile or a grin?

Liars contests have proven a na
i tion-wide success. Humorous story
! telling contests could be just as suc
j cessful. "The Abraham Lincoln best j
: story of the year competition" with :
the winners to be announced on !
February 12! And as the stories 1
were repeated through the months J
they would be known as Lincoln
stories. Honest Abe admitted that
most of his tales were not original,
anyway. ,

Perhaps disrespectful to remember
, Lincoln's birthday with comedy? j
What kind of respect is it, then, to !
j do or remember nothing on this j
day? —John McClelland
