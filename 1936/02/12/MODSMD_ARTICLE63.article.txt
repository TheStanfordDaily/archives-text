The Editor, Sir:
Your front page editorial of yes- |
terday was very nice reading, but j
just as all wet as the campus drains, j
It is not untraditional for hall-men 1
to distribute "straight tickets" on j
hall candidates at A.S.S.U. elections.
They've done it for years. They've
got to.
They don't have house meetings in
the halls, you know, and without
that little publicity as to hall candi- ;
dates, hall men could never come J
out of their burrows long enough to
know which of their fellows wero
running.
Don't let your enthusiasm and
your Row affiliations carry you
away, my friend.
