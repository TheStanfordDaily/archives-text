The Editor, Sir:
After all this Daily discussion of
1 student apathy, "the time has come,"
| the Walrus said. Instead of all these
scathing remarks by the Daily that
we can't answer back, let's have a i
good bull session where we can all j
talk about it. The Walrus Club is |
I putting on a meeting next Thursday, I
February 13, on "What Is Wrong j
with Our College Education?" |
| Let's not make this a meeting for i
j the chosen few to agree with each i
i other that we are going to the dogs
and nothing can be done about it, !
but make it a good lively meeting
with lots of conflict of ideas. Maybe
! some of you think nothing is wrong
1 with education, as some around here 1

are confident; if that's the case come
and tell us all so. If you haven't
any ideas, come and get some as am
munition for hall and row verbal
barrages, and if you have some,
you're just the persons needed for
such a discussion. This meeting
won't be one where you are lec
tured at, but informal for everyone
to take part in. Three members of
the faculty and three students will
lead the discussion. If you know,

come and tell us —if you don't, come
and find out.
Yours for a lively meeting,
Drayton S. Bryant
