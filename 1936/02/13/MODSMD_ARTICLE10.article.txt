# Students Get Store Profits At Princeton
## 
### 
Though Stanford's undergradu
ates and Board of Trustees have
settled tho problem of dispersing
Bookstore r.urplses, word came
yesterday frcVn the east extolling
the merits of Princeton univer
sity's cooDcrative student store
plan.
The 30-year-old Princeton store
is run absolutely by undergrad
uates who, by buying a $5 share,
become "members" of the organi
zation. Last year the store distri
buted $89,000 profit in dividends
to its 3100 members, 10 percent
of the total sales.
The store's method of doing
business -it sells books, clothing,
drugs, tobacco, etc.â€”is such that
members actually received goods
at less than the cost to the store.
This surprising situation is ex
plained by the fact that non-mem
bers, with whom tho store does
a large business, do not share in
the profits.
