"Every hid for the dance tomor
row night is gone," said Leo Miller,
dance chairman for the Toyon
Formal, last night. "It's a complete
sell-out. Anyone who has a hid
promised but hasn't received it had
better hurry over, because we have
more requests than we can fill."

tertain at the Valentine dance. Car
vel Craig, who is providing the mu
sic, will present a variety of spe
cialty numbers including tangoes,
rhumbas, a toy band, and novelty
