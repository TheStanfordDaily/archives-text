### 
Future opcratic divas and virtu
osos may find self expression by re
porting to the P;ilo Alto Philhar
monic Chorus Tuesday, February
18, at 8 o'clock for parts in the Eng
lish version of Moussorksky's opera
"Boris Godounow" for which the
Philharmonic is in need of additional
voices, male and female.
Unusual among operas, "Boris
Gorounow" offers important roles to
the chorus, the entire third and .sixth
scenes being almost entirely devoted
to vocal ensembles. Of interest arc
iho arrangements of various groups
of voices, and of the melodies in this
little known opera, sung ten years
ago by Chaliapin in the title role.
