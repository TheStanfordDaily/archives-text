# Ex-President Flays Roosevelt
## 'Dictatorship' in Present Administration Claimed In Portland Address 
### 
Fonncr President Herbert Hoover
bianded the Roosevelt Administra
tion as an administration of dicta
torship and confusion last night at a
Lincoln's birthday dinner in Port
land, Ore.
"The stock boom today is not
confidence in the future; it is part
ly from fear of inflation," he said
in challenging the president to
outline the steps he meant to take
to clear up the budget and the
money situation.
Mr. Hoover maintained that it was
the Supreme Court decisions which
brought confidence and alleviated
the fears that retarded recovery.
"In less than a year our country
must make a decision not less
fateful than that which confronted
Abraham Lincoln," lie said, and
called the Republican party to ac
tion.
"The issue is the attempt to fasten
upon the American people some sort
of a system of personal government
of laws; a political bureaucracy; a
system of inflation; a system which
would stifle the freedom and liberty
of man," he said.
