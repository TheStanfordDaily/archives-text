# Rebates Voted Out Loan Plan Accepted
## 
### Johnson Hill 
Campus democracy and student
government received a definite boost
yesterday when E. P. Lesley, presi
dent of the Bookstore, announced
that hereafter surplus profits will be
donated to a scholarship fund for
student aid, in accordance with the
preference indicated by voters in
the balloting Tuesday.
The Bookstore's annual contri
bution to the fund, Lesley stated,
may amount to $3000. The Board
of Trustees is drafting a by-law,
adoption of which will make such
disposition of profit legal.
The decision was reached after
election officials had retabulated the
preferential ballots, on which stu
dents voted either to continue the
present policy of refunding money to
purchasers, to donate it to the schol
arship fund, or to establish a loan
library. First returns gave 381 first
choices for the first plan, 403 for the
second, 275 /or the third, and 69 for
miscellaneous suggestions.
In the second tabulation, prefer
ences for the third and miscellaneous
proposals were distributed, accord
ing to second choices, between the

other two plans. Results in this
tally indicaled 607 in favor of the
scholarship fund donation, and *170
for continuation of the rebate policy.
In a statement to The Daily con
cerning the rcw measure, Lesley
.said:
"Since the membership of the
Bookstore, at a recent meeting,
expressed approval of this pro
jected by-law, if it should be in
accordance with student senti
ment, it is reasonable to suppose
that it will be adopted.
"However, since a considerable
number of the voters were in favor
i of retaining the rebate system, and
! since there were suggestions that
] profit be abolished by cutting
prices or absorbing sales tax, the
Board has adopted the policy that,
! insofar as possible, prices will be
j lowered to a point where only a
j safe operating margin of profit is in
: sured," Lesley added.
Under this policy Ihe average re
| bate to e.ic hstudent probably
would not exceed 75 cents per year,
j if the rebate plan were retained,
Leslie said.
