# Foreign Matter

### Gray Creveling 
FELL NAME of this column,
which, incidentally, was marred by
some typographical discrepancies in
its initial appearance yesterday, is
"Foreign Matter or The Eyes Have
It." A non-Union milkshake to any
one suggesting a better title.
I>R. STOREY says, in effect, "This
so-called flu epidemic is well under
control." Remember last spring
when ihe 'so-called measles epi
demic" was "well under control"?
MASSACHUSETTS Representa
tive Treadway laid a grave problem
before the House last week when he
wondered "whether any effort is be
ing made to lessen the noise in the
House restaurant? It is perfectly
terrible to go down into that room
during ihe neon hour."
Countered Virginia Democrat
Woodrum, "The gentleman has
raised a very important question
that should be acted on by Congress.
1 am afraid, however, that if f join
the gentleman in a resolution, it i
might be attacked by the gentle- i
man's colleagues as unconstitutional. !
If members make too much noise
when they eat their soup . . ."
"It's not that kind of noise," |
sneered Treadway.
TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHOR
ITY is next in line to bo convicted
for the popular crime of unconstitu
tionality.
However, by making the TVA il
legal, the Supreme Court will not
erase the benefits already brought
by the project to inhabitants of Nor- .
i is County and Tennesseeans in gen- i
eral.
NRA'S ALTRUISTIC intentions;
have lingered on. In San Francisco
the biggest merchants have formed |
a FAIR PLAY league since the
NRA's repudiation in order to re
tain some semblance of the redoubt
able code wage and hours laws.
AAA BENEFITS — higher prices
for farm products, consequently
money in the farmer's jeans—con
tinue. But as soon as the farmers
raise all they want in an effort to
take advantage of the present price
scale, prices will plummet and the
farmer will be back in the same old J
rut of helpless poverty.
DIONNE QUINTS were lucky to |
have been born in Canada. AAA
might have had three of them
plowed under before it became un
constitutional.
MAYBE CREAMER S New Deal !
for the Ex Committee is unconstitu- j
tional.
