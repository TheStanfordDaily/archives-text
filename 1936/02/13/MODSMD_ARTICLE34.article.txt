# Expedition Invades Lake with Flatiron
## 
### Dave Leff 
Seventy million gallons of ice cold
water and ''millions of fiogs" will
be* at the disposal i?' Stanford lovers,
and other interested in canoeing on
Lagunita, the largest lake in miles
around, as soon as the present storms
cease.
Depth Estimated
Rowed out into the middle of the
36.5 acres of rippling, muddy water,
your reporter, equipped with a flat
iron on the end of a piece of wire,
cautiously dropped his metallic bait
into the very deepest part of La
gunita, according to his guide, an
engineering major who dwells at the
boat-house all year round. Down
went the flatiron, down the string,
and down the wire, without coming
to a stop. The man in charge of the
boathouse estimated 20 to 25 feet of

J depth.
Two craft are offered for rent at
i 50 cents per hour; the lest of the
i score or more of canoes arc owned
by various living groups, each of
which has :tt least on;, and Lagunita,
J Roble, and Entina, two or thrca
I apiece.
Water Carnival
About the middle of (be spring j
I quarter, a yay water carnival- ;i I
I Stanford tradition will be held, I
t with races, jousts, and other lea- {
I tures.
Meanwhile, numerous run-ofls
from the hills are pouting millions i
1 of chilly gallon:; daily into Lagunita, |
I pushing back the wateiline, and in- f
! creasing the depth so that, at pres- ,
ent, it comes within a yard or o of j
last year's figure.
