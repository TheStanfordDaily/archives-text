# Bunn Gives Team Two Day Vacation To Prime for Bears
## Nobs Likely To Play For Flu – Stricken Stoefen In Line-up Tomorrow 
### Roger Kimball 
John Bunn is taking no chances
that his Indian basketball team will
be stale at Berkeley tomorrow night.
There was no practice yesterday and
there will bo none today. The boys
didn't look too smooth in Tuesday's
session, and Bunn decided that two
days off would help prime them for
the Bears.
Main problem of the week is
still who wiil he the starting cen
ter in the California game. Art
Stoefen has not yet recovered
from an attack of fln and will
probably not he in shape to play
much, if at all.
After showing to advantage in the
.south, Ken Nobs was one of the few
who played up to par Tuesday. The
"forgotten man" of Stanford bas
ketball, Nobs is Ihe best bet to op
pose California's Chet Carlisle in the
circle at 8 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning.
Less likely to start at center is
Bob Zonne, now definitely a reg< lar
guard. It would not be at all sur
prising to see Bunn shift Zonne to
center, pair Sparky Robertson with
Jack Calderwood at guard, -and use
Captain Dinly Moore at forward at
; ome time in the Bear tussle.
Ilank Luisctti, southern divi
sion high scorer, and Howie
Turner, fourth in the race, are
sure to be the starting forwards
as the Indians seek a series bulge
on th»- Blue and Gold five.
Stanford must stop three Bear
scoring threats in order to win and
be sure of staying in first place.
Captain Ray Olson, Ray Balsley, and
Chet Carlisle are all apt to be "hot,"
especially in the Berkeley "800
Pavilion."
