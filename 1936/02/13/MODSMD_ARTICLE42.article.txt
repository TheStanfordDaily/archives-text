# Sideline Slants...
## cards less errors, MORE SUPPORTERS 
### 
Let it be understood at the outset
that baseball at present is a very ;
minor, though officially a major,
Coast college sport.
It should not be thus.
For baseball, you are beginning
to understand, is a swell game to.
play and is etjually enjoyable to j
witness.
And out here on the green
Sunken Diamond, Harry Wolter
has a bunch of athletes who con- ;
sfitute one of the best nines that
has come litre for many moons. |
They haven't won many games, [
but there are the errors.
The I!KS(i Card nine hasn't yet
played a game without errors
cropping up. They can't seem to [
realize that tlicy could win these
games with the kind of hitting and |
pitching they've got. for the boys
really slug the old apple, then
mul7 and hobble the infield rollers.
The Conference opens Saturday j
with Santa Clara.
Now here ave soiiie of the players |
who should help to win more than ,
the usual number of games from |
Conference opposition.
CAPTAIN IJONES HAMILTON—
left field. It's the same rugged, fast '
Bones of the gridiron. He is one of '
the best hitters on the team, in- j
credibly fast on the bases, and is a I
fiery captain and team leader.
BILL NEWSOM — third base.
This rangy athlete handles him
self at the hot corner as if he had
been there ail his life, and at the
plate like a young Nap Lajoie. ,
He spent his frosh year at Cal,
where he was a babe football and
baseball standouts. He's now a
junior, is called by the bleacher
blues-singers the best ball player
in the Conference.
LEO HEAGERTY—catcher. Leo, ;
too, is a claimant for all-Conference j
ranking. He is a soph, batting in the
.6CO class, a star's average in the
making. He beat out Mike Ferro,
last year's regular, early in the
season, and ii he regains the fire he's
got, he'll be tops on the Conference! j
GEORGE FARRELL—short. An- ,
other sophomore transfer, from |
Redwood. In the Athens game Sat- j
urday he made two backhand stops j
of sure base hits that reminded one i
of Lyn Lary when he was playing |
for Oakland. And with Howie j
Turner coming out for second at the |
end of' the month, the pair might j
form a new Lary-Reese Keystone ;
combination.
808 MATTHEWS —right field. :
Known for his sqixit frame and good j
play for Tiny Thornhill's line last |
fall, Bob is one of the surest hitters |
out there, his specialties being a
one-base Texas-leaguer and clip
ping the opposing infielders out of
the play. Another sophomore.
PITCHERS Ray Weiershauser,
Johnny Campbell, and Fred "Spike" |
i Furman, junior, senior, and soph,
respectively. A trio of boys who can
: be banked on to twirl good ball once i
or twice a week.

Both Weiershauscrs, Ray and
Jack, are current campus sports

raves. They were born in Stockton,
went to Modesto J.C. . . . Ray likes
to break their backs with a floating |
knuckle ball. . . . Jack is a 440 man
with a big smile, looks like Dink's !
'30 varsity anchor man . . . they are
both well buiit brunettes, look like !
brothers, but don't room together
. . . relation to the Tacoma kidnap 1
ease W's—there's a "y" in that one. !
Caution: Jack has a tremendously!
powerful stride and is fast, but don't
be discouraged if he doesn't run 48
flat for a while yet. He'll do it, but i
not any old day, like the glib city
newspapers seem to think.
