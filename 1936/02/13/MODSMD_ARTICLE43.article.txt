# Swimmers Face Championship Team Tomorrow
## Cardinals Hope To Defeat Oregon Varsity by Wins In Diving, Medley Relay 
### 
When the Stanford varsity swim- ,
niL'r.s tangle with Oregon tomorrow |
afternoon in the Encina pools they '
wiil be meeting the championship
tejam of the Northern Division of the i
Pacific Coast Conference, who have
division champions in the back- |
stroke, the breast stroke, the 50, the j
100, and the diving events. But the !
Indians are good, too; and they'll be
out there to utop the Webfeet in their i
Northern California invasion,
Indian Relay Good
Little is known about the Oregon j
free-style relay team, but it will j
have to be very good and {\ little
more in order to take the event. The
Indian relay is as good as anything 1
on the Coast. Chuck Reed, North
ern Division breast-stroke champion
from Oregon, will have no trouble
taking his event. But Stanford's
Bob Walker stands high to beat the
second of Oregon's champions,
James Reed, in the backstroke.
There's less than a second between
the two men's times, and Walker
hasn't ever yet been pressed.
Sexton Is Favorite
Harold Sexton is the outstanding
favorite in the 440, and he should
take the event for the visitors.
However, in view of the remarkable
race Don Peterson turned in last
week against the Olympic Club,
Sexton will have to be swimming in
top-form to win. Tom Boothe will
represent the Cardinals on the board
against Bob Chilton, another North
ern Division champion. Chilton will
1 be diving from the low board, while
Boothe will use the high one. This
will be an advantage for Boothe, for
the greater difficulty of his dives
will be considered in the judging.
Vibert May Be Out
Jack Vibert, Stanford's 220 man,
' has been fighting off a mild case of
i influenza all week. He will be much
needed by the Indians, especially
because of Jim Hurd, Oregon's sen
j sational sprinter. Verne Hoffman
will probably take the 50 and the
| 100 for the Webfeet.
The medley relay race may be the
deciding event. If it is, the Indian
mermen will undoubtedly emerge
victors, for it was Stanford's great
| medley team that established a new
i Pacific Association record last week.

Vibert May Be Out
Jack Vibert, Stanford's 220 man,
' has been fighting off a mild case of
i influenza all week. He will be much
needed by the Indians, especially
because of Jim Hurd, Oregon's sen
j sational sprinter. Verne Hoffman
will probably take the 50 and the
| 100 for the Webfeet.
The medley relay race may be the
deciding event. If it is, the Indian
mermen will undoubtedly emerge
victors, for it was Stanford's great
| medley team that established a new
i Pacific Association record last week.
When the Stanford varsity swim- ,
niL'r.s tangle with Oregon tomorrow |
afternoon in the Encina pools they '
wiil be meeting the championship
tejam of the Northern Division of the i
Pacific Coast Conference, who have
division champions in the back- |
stroke, the breast stroke, the 50, the j
100, and the diving events. But the !
Indians are good, too; and they'll be
out there to utop the Webfeet in their i
Northern California invasion,
Indian Relay Good
Little is known about the Oregon j
free-style relay team, but it will j
have to be very good and {\ little
more in order to take the event. The
Indian relay is as good as anything 1
on the Coast. Chuck Reed, North
ern Division breast-stroke champion
from Oregon, will have no trouble
taking his event. But Stanford's
Bob Walker stands high to beat the
second of Oregon's champions,
James Reed, in the backstroke.
There's less than a second between
the two men's times, and Walker
hasn't ever yet been pressed.
Sexton Is Favorite
Harold Sexton is the outstanding
favorite in the 440, and he should
take the event for the visitors.
However, in view of the remarkable
race Don Peterson turned in last
week against the Olympic Club,
Sexton will have to be swimming in
top-form to win. Tom Boothe will
represent the Cardinals on the board
against Bob Chilton, another North
ern Division champion. Chilton will
1 be diving from the low board, while
Boothe will use the high one. This
will be an advantage for Boothe, for
the greater difficulty of his dives
will be considered in the judging.
