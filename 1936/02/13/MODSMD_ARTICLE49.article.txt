## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism The 						Question's Back in Your Lap Now, Dramatic Council; Why Not Consolidate? 
### 
Barnstormers received recognition from Ex
Committee Tuesday night. Then, however,
Ex Committee thr£\v the question of whether
or not Barnstormers would have a representa
tive on Dramatic Council hack in their lap and
in the Dramatic Council lap, and told both
groups, in elTcct, to take a mirror and inspect
themselves.
A place oij Dramatic Council does not seem
an important thing on the lace of it. ()ne more
tomcat in an alley scrap should not ailed the
tide of bailie, and Ex Committee has been
giving seats on the Council lo almost anyone
with an honest face who asks for it.
First, llie new A.S.S.U. Constitutional la
thers increased Dramatics Council by giving
representation to Sword and Sandals and
Masquers; in order lo assure good publicity
for the shows, they slapped on Tin: Daily,
then the Chappy reviewers.
Ram's Head then came before Ex Commit
tee, pointed out it was an almost extinct soci
ety, and if it didn't get a vote on Dramatic
Council il would be more extinct. A kind
hearted committee lixed things.
Now there arc 100 many artists and immor
tal souls, 100 many angels dancing on the
head of a pin, too many conflicting ideas for
a committee that should be a compact, elli
cient administrative body.
So Ex Committee balked at Barnstormers'
request for a seal —it was not a protest against

Barnstormers, but against the cluttered sys
tem.
Lest Dramatic Council forget, that great
structural sink down by the B.A.C. is soon to
be a New Theater. And Stanford dramatics
will have to help lake il over -clliciently. In
crease in the number of students on Dramatic
Council at any time is a mistake, let alone
now.
Dramatic Council members vehemently as
sert that the Council has not been unwieldy.
The Republican Party will also deny that it
is conservative; the American Legion will say
that it is patriotic. At any rate, Ex Committee
thinks, and rightfully, that one more member
would be several too many.
One of several possible solutions, Dramatic
Council:
Reduce yourselves, ri(/ht now, to a workable
size. First, throw the Daily and Chappy re
viewers oil', then eliminate your member at
large, and finally limit representation from
four honorary dramatic organizations to two
members—consolidate.
That will leave a committee of seven—two
business men, two faculty men, and three
artists. Advantages: a good balance of power,
an ellicicntly manned Council, no deadwood,
and regained favor with the A.S.S.U. Ex Com
mittee ears might perk up next Tuesday if
Barnstormers should oiler to compromise
with Ram's Head, for example, each to sit on
the Council for half the vear.
