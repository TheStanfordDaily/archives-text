# Good Speaker, Good Title Both Are Necessities

### 
Chester Howell, a brilliant and entertaining
speaker, came down to the Farm this week to
give a Tuesday evening lecture on a subject
vitally interesting to Palo Alto citizens and
the faculty. And his appearance practically
packed the ground floor of the assembly hall
with Palo Alto citizens and the faculty.
Some students attended, but if the oldsters
had staved away, editor Howell might have
been insulted.
The subject of the talk was "The Asiatic
(Tisis," equally as unattractive to the average
student as other recent lectures on such sub
jects ;is "The European Crisis," "Unconstitu
tionality," and "'flic Fiord Hegion of East
Greenland."
Chester Howell is a well-known and color
ful personality. He and others like him pro
vide the kind of drawing power Tuesday eve
ning lectures need. But "The Asiatic Crisis"
is enough to scare any student into taking in
a picture show.
When the public exercises committee re
signs itself to the fact that culture and foreign
a Hairs are unpopular with students in spite
of their being good for them, and presents
programs of popular or noted speakers coup
led wits popular topics, then it will rouse out
the ordinary men and women who hear
enough of "crises" and "unconstitutionality"
during the day.
