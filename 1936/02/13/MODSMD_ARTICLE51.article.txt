Well, the weather made a tool out of me, again.
But that's nothing, it's been doing that to the Weather
Bureau for years. The bolt of lightning that whipped
out of the sky yesterday morning at 7 o'clock some
where near a highway trickle shop, zoomed over the
Palo Alto Tree for the benefit of the Stanford Con
valescent Home, singed a few beards of late-study
ing physics majors, whistled up the Row, thumbed its
nose at the Ryan high-voltage lab, and then disap
peared into the hills chortling to itself, did one service
to humanity—Sophomore wake-up men in houses all
over the campus got up in time for their 8 o'clocks,
and some of the brothers who heard the thunder did
also.
For the first time in history, Cap and Gown, with
which is combined Cops and Robbers (for a limited
time only), pledged a couple of members from the Phi
Delt house.
Don't get excited. The Deegees and the Phi Delts
were having an exchange dinner when the Cap and
Gooners were goon around Tuesday night.
It is my duty, I suppose, to report a further triumph
for Stanford womanhood, as a contributor to traffic
safety.
It seems that an admirer of a certain woman student
(this is, however, not the same student who is always j
getting his name posted in front of the Ad Building
for honor code violations. This is an entirely different
A Certain Student) had tried for months to get a j
date with this sorority woman. Finally, he got the date i
and the bans were posted.
However, this gentleman was subject to change (
without notice. Before he set out for the date, he was j
waylaid by several highwaymen, who joined him for a '
round down the highway. They gave him both bar- 1
rels, but he cried for more. i
By the time he arrived at the turn to the right and
(he little white light on Lasuen Street, he was danger- j
ous but passable.
To say that the sorority woman was afraid would 1
be inadequate; to say that she was scared to death, ;
would be fun, but untrue; so we'll stick to the first one. {
Iu his prime, this gentleman was a good driver but 1
he was even passing his prime on the wrong side that i
night. The prime car got as far as Burlingame, though :
it is said that the P. G. & E. still does not know what
happened to the seventh telephone pole. The can
died youth remembered that he knew somebody in
Burlingame. So he parked it a rakish angle in front of !
.somebody s house and went in to see somebody.
The Certain Student was not quite sure what the
Women's Council provision was in this instance, but
'»ne thing she did know, and that is how to drive. So
she did it. She backed the car. out, left her sub
merged escort in somebody's house in Burlingame, I
and returned to the Stanford campus, where she read
a good book that night, j
