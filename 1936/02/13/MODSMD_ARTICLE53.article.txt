## These Unnecessary Honoraries 
### 
(From the University of Nevada Sagebrush)
That the University of Nevada campus is overrun
with honorary societies and good fellowship organiza
tions is a well known fact. And what good can be
derived from these organizations is a question that
every student asks himself. True, some serve definite
purposes, either by sponsoring lecture meetings or
exhibits for the public benefit or by affording some
service to the university and to the student body.
Others, however, have forgolten their original pur
poses, and have devolved into nothing more than
mere "names." Some have become so lax that they are
no longer of any use.
Efforts have been made in past years to check on
these groups, but nothing definite has ever come from
the movement. After a "scolding"* by student officials,
they have mended their ways, and then dropped back
into oblivion as soon as the tumult and shouting died.
But the fact remains there are at the present time
too many organizations on the Nevada campus to be of
any use; yet it would be impossible to name any or
ganization because invariably there are certain students
endeavoring to keep their organizations alive.
It is, nevertheless, within the power of the student
senate to suspend any campus organization if it no
longer has a justification for life.
By doing this, the student record would be k:>pt
clean, and conflicts in activities will be avoided. Or
ganizations which have shown their willingness to be
of service will continue—the diadwood will be aban
doned.
