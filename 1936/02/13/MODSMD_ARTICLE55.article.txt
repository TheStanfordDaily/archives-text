# Electioneering Hit By Ludlam, Kahn
## 
### Johnson Hill 
Two students outstanding in cam- j
pus political activity for several
years, last night condemned elec
tioneering in the form of campaign
ballots distributed among dormitory |
living groups.
Jim Ludlam, chairman of the elec- j
tion board, and Marvin Kahn, last i
year's A.S.S.U. president, joined in i
expressing disfavor on the question, {
which aroused student feeling when i
"machine" ballots were given to j
residents of Encina, Toyon, and j
Branner Halls on the eve of Tues- ,
day's elections.
'"It seems lo me," Ludlam de
clared, "that the distribution <if
handbills before elections is eth
ical, as long as none are given to
freshmen in Encina. But when
candidates pass out their ballots in i
that ball, which traditionally lias
been known as neutral grounds in
all political matters, then they
are violating whatever code of
ethics governs such issues.
"Last fall authorized speakers
were sent to Encina to give incom
ing students definite instructions re
garding elections and nominational
processes. In addition, an effort was j

made to discourage the distribution
of marked ballots," Ludlam added.
Kalin termed the editorial in yes
terday's Daily, which stated that
pre-election marked ballots place
student equality in jeopardy, "a crit
icism too imaginative and idealistic."
"The question," Kahn said, "is
not whether certain factions have
the money to print handbills while
others don't. It is merely whether
or not the practice, in itself, is
i profitable enough to pay in the
, long run.
"Personally. I can't understand
j the purpose of the ballots. If the
j candidates whose names appear on
I them offered platforms on any par
j ticular issues it would be a different
| story. The idea of distributing
! handbills has been growing at Stan
ford for several years. It must be
recognized as it is, regardless of
| opinion," Kahn stated.
Ludlam, when asked if official ac
! tion would be taken against the
practice, admitted that nothing could
be done to forcibly prohibit the
practice because those who are re
sponsible for it cannot be identi
, fied.

candidates pass out their ballots in i
that ball, which traditionally lias
been known as neutral grounds in
all political matters, then they

"Last fall authorized speakers
were sent to Encina to give incom
ing students definite instructions re
garding elections and nominational
processes. In addition, an effort was j

made to discourage the distribution
of marked ballots," Ludlam added.
Kalin termed the editorial in yes
terday's Daily, which stated that
pre-election marked ballots place
student equality in jeopardy, "a crit
icism too imaginative and idealistic."
"The question," Kahn said, "is
not whether certain factions have
the money to print handbills while
others don't. It is merely whether
or not the practice, in itself, is
i profitable enough to pay in the
, long run.
"Personally. I can't understand
j the purpose of the ballots. If the
j candidates whose names appear on
I them offered platforms on any par
j ticular issues it would be a different

! handbills has been growing at Stan
ford for several years. It must be
recognized as it is, regardless of
| opinion," Kahn stated.
Ludlam, when asked if official ac
! tion would be taken against the
practice, admitted that nothing could
be done to forcibly prohibit the
practice because those who are re
sponsible for it cannot be identi

Two students outstanding in cam- j
pus political activity for several
years, last night condemned elec
tioneering in the form of campaign
ballots distributed among dormitory |
living groups.
Jim Ludlam, chairman of the elec- j
tion board, and Marvin Kahn, last i
year's A.S.S.U. president, joined in i
expressing disfavor on the question, {
which aroused student feeling when i
"machine" ballots were given to j
residents of Encina, Toyon, and j
Branner Halls on the eve of Tues- ,
day's elections.
'"It seems lo me," Ludlam de
clared, "that the distribution <if
handbills before elections is eth

freshmen in Encina. But when
