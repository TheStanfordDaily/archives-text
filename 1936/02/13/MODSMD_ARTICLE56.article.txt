SPECIAL DELIVERY ,
| Dear People:
We finally foiled the administra-
I tion. The radio now works on three :
stations, and the engineer can't un- i
; derstand it.
This place is a model of arrange- j
ment. Piece goods are handled on j
the first floor, all knock-down high- j
j way cases. On deck, too, we have j
the stiffs, tagged and in neat piles, j
Blushingly, we tell you «i£ the third
floor, dedicated to blessed events, j
The fourth floor is used only for j
critical cases, nursey revealed, to j
maintain the institution's enviable!
mortality record. Whenever a pa- i
I tient is about to kick, he is thrown 1
! ou* ihe fourth story window so that |
j he dies outside.
It is probably of little interest to !
j the world that we are starving to |
1 death. The meals are balanced on a j
jewler's scale. One calorie too j
many and ihey believe we'd break i
i out all over. At present we are cam
paigning for fiuit to supplement the
j so-called three-squares—square like j

I a card shark. Iloranges, epples, and j
i banans are wanted.
Cut off from the sight of all white
women, kicked around from bath to |
i bed, there is one great consolation,
i We have an absolutely air-tight ex
■ cuse against Mr. Hall and his Econ
i II ex Friday. We are drooling ex
! pectantly.
They tell us that we are cured. '
1 We don't believe them. Yesterday 1
they said our temp was normal and
j we know they lied because we |
i peeked at the thermometer. They
j are all hypocritical optimists. They
! said we could leave today and the
j next minute Ihey slapped on an- i
j other mustard plaster. Fine stuff!
This is for the date: we will be j
well Friday and we have already |
paid for the bid to the Toyon Formal !
| (advt). We will be there if it kills j
j us.
Eisenbach common, 99;
Eisenbach preferred, 98.
Love,
i Bob

If the noted ''Bull Sessioner"
thinks he has pests, he should see
ours—in the form of lunatics with
stomach trouble who estrange the
night in purple pajamas seeking out
a "fourth" among those who are to
make up the nation's next day's
death list. In clusihg, may I add, we
demand the publicity we got sick for.
Mandatory yours,
A living corpse
