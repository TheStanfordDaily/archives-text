The Editor, Sir:
Our Hasher Scz, "Seventy-five per
tent of the vagrants entering Cali
fornia come to Los Angeles." So
what? These followers of the road
love the beautiful city's warmth and
pleasantness rather than the rain,
fog. and stenchy marshes of the Bay
Region.
San Francisco, for instance, can't
boast the quality of buildings, roads,
and transportation systems that L.A.
has.
Los Angeles is in a definite shape,
that of a fan, and its long, straight
highways through the city extend
for some 40 miles with scarcely a
curve rather than seeking out some
mountain peak to twist over.
lit conclusion, may we add that
Our Hasher's assumption that L.A.
deserves 75 per cent of the vagrants
that enter California is very likely
true because any big city attracts
both men of quality and those who
are useless to society, but we say it
is better for L.A. to have 75 per cent
of the vagrants that enter Califor
nia than lo be like San Francisco and
have 75 per cent of the vagrants in
California harbored in its dingy

corners.
Jack'nbob
P.S. It seems that Our Hasher
neglects- the fact that L.A. gives
Stanford more students than any
other one city in the world.
