# WAILS FROM THE FLU WARD

The Editor, Sir:
Palo Alto temperature, 10 above
zero, but mine, 102.8 Fahrenheit . . .
When I first saw the unexpected
light this forenoon, a newspaper was
thiust into my hand and a ther
mometer in my face. The paper
read, "Eleven in the Rest Home,"
and the thermometer redd, an in
creased temperature . . .
Early today each man, or what
was left of him, made a dash on his
crutches, wheel-chair, or whatever
nis method of conveyance was, to sec
his name in the paperâ€”disappoint
ment, and ni( re prospective stiffs
were transferred to Bob Eisen bach's
"pest paradise," the Paly hospital.
