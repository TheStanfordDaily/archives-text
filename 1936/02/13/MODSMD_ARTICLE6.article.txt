though four were released, the total
increased to 32. Twenty-four of these

upper respiratory infection. In
fluenza cases numbered 13.
11 in Men's Home
There were 11 men affected with
colds in the Men's Rest Home and
five in the Women's Rest Home.
None of these cases was accompa
nied by a temperature.
There still has not been a serious
case of flu on the campus, which is
truly remarkable considering the
grip the flu epidemic has taken on
the Peninsula. Schools in Redwood
City, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and
in the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Valleys have been closed because of
low attendance. San Francisco's
public schools show an absent list
of 8993, 4(>50 more than at this time
last year.

with the epidemic. Dr. Leo Stanley,
prison physician, reports 25 hospital
cases and 1H.~) inmates undergoing
treatment in their cells. Dr. Stanley
said that the epidemic struck the
penitentiary three days ago.
