# Irene Dunne Stars in Drama At 'Stanford'
## 
### 
Why such excellent movie mate- j
rial as Lloyd C. Douglass' best- :
seller, "MAGNIFICENT OBSES
: sion," now playing at the Stanford,
A escaped filming as long as;
it die, is a mystery. It has '
just the right proportion of j
drama, pathos, and mysti- |
i cism to make it a popular success, j
Irene Dunne as "Helen Hudson," j
the young girl who loses her hus- i
I band, her eye-sight, and her heart !
at the hands of a rich play-boy, does '
a fine piece of acting. Those scenes j
in which she is blind are portrayed i
with the restraint and understand- j
ing characteristic of Miss Dunne's l
work and deserve special mention. j|
"Robert Merrick," the wealthy
ne'er-do-well who causes Miss j
Dunne so much pain and then does I
| all in his power to rectify ihe dam- ;
I ;ige, is portrayed by Robert Taylor. 1
At the risk ol cries of heresy, may I
venture to say that Mr. Taylor's |
! characterization is no more than \
| adequate. This is the only picture in
] wh'ch I have seen his work, but if it
I is a fair example I do not think he is j
deserving of the hullabaloo with ]
! which he has been greeted. He is a I
j competent actor who does his job |
j conscientiously and well, but he is
i not great. â€”B. Sweet I
