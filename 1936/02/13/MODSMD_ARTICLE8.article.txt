## Group Awaits Acceptance By Dramatic Council; Annual Show Planned 
### 
Barnstormers, embryo honorary J
dramatic society which was appro- i
ved by Ex Committee Tuesday night
but still awaits acceptance as a inem
mer of Dramatic Council, bases its
membership on directorial, mana- j
gerial, and creative qualifications s
rather than emphasizing dramatic
ability.
Organized in 1935
Organized immediately after the
production of the "Follies Bour
geois" in Spring quarter, 1935, its
members came from the original
committee of students who carried j
out the long-standing demand for \
Ihe return of an annual Spring mu- !
sical production.
Encouraged by the success of this
student co-operative venture, the
parties directly concerned formally
organized themselves as a club with 1
the purpose of perpetuating the
Spring musical show as an institu
tion.
Aims Toward Show
Barnstormers aim to produce an
annual musical show, written and
staged entirely by students, under !
the ;iu.spices of the Dramatic Coun
cil, all box-office receipts going into
the treasury of that organization. The
society would handle the selection
of show material on a competitive
basis, and would unify that material
into an organized whole.
Members would be chosen only
from those who take part in the pro
duction of the Spring musical, but
would not be limited in number.
Membership includes both men and
women.
