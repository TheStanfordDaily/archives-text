### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13 (/P). â€”A
72-hour storm subsided today, leav
ing in its leaking wake one man
dead, five persons injured, and prop
erty damage estimated at $100,000.
The dead man was Miguel Val
devie, 60, Pasadena, crushed while
working to avert further cave-ins
on the Mt. Lowe railway.
A narrow-gauge tornado, which
struck Long Beach late yesterday;
accounted for the five injured and
half of the property damage.
The freak wind hit Alhambra,
where it uprooted trees in a city
park. At Long Beach, 25 miles
away, it overturned five oil der
dicks, ripped roofs off small build
ings, and smashed plate glass win
dows in stores. Falling timbers and
splattering glass injured five Long
Beach residents.
There is no further threat of
floods in Los Angeles County, the
forestry department reported, with
debris basins holding back torrents
caused by three days of rain. How
ever, high water cut off highway
traffic into the Malibu movie col
ony, where many stars have resort
homes.
A landslide at Summcrland, near
Santa Barbara, delayed traffic tem
porarily on the Southern Pacific's
Coast line.
