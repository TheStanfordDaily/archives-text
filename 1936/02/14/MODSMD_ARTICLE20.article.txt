# Education Sour, Say 25 Thinkers
## Walrus Club Has Nebular Hypothesis, Dings Curricular Regimentation 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
There are almost 4000 students in
Stanford. Last night a large plural
ity was sitting in the library alter
nately watching the blondes walk
ing down the aisles and trying to
memorize unassorted facts for Fri
day exes and mid-terms, a few were
fiddling at the Mark hoping some
thing would pop or Rome would
burn, 15 were at the Daily office
tearing their hair, large numbers
were huddled next to a radio listen
ing In Bing Crosby and Rudolph
Vallee, but 25 of the 4000 had
enough curiosity to wonder just
what they were spending four years
of their lite and about $4000 for to
attend the Walrus Club meeting in
the basement room of the Women's
Clubhouse. The topic: "What Is
Wrong with a College Education."
Professors Lead
In the rather stuffy, low-ceilinged
room the Walri slouched in the
wicker chairs while they listened to
six leaders of the panel sitting
around a table in the front of the
room advance the wrongs. One of
the members knitted on a blue
sweater, several smoked, a member
in the back of the room tried to
write an education paper, while a
reporter in a corner kept dropping
his pencil on the floor.
Leaders of the discussion were
Professor Harold Chapman Brown of
the philosophy department, Pro
fessor Ernest Hilgard of the psychol
ogy department, Dr. Dorothy Heil
man of the women's physical educa
tion department, Drayton Bryant,
new head Walrus, Vesta Nickerson,
education grad and former Ex
Committee secretary, and Elizabeth
Lam, Y.W.C.A. secretary.
Stimuli Resulted
Though there was no definite,
pragmatic conclusion, for that is con
trary to the Walrus Club ideal of an
intellectual exercise, several definite
stimuli resulted.
Dr. Brown mentioned: "Most stu
dents are ruined in their freshman
year." He advocated doing away
with the grade system and substi
tuting instead a comprehensive ex
amination at the end of four years
to get away from the formalized
method of the medicine drop form
of education.
Will Be Continued
Dr. Hilgard stated, "You can ei
ther educate the student so that he
will adjust himself to his situation
like a contented cow, or you can
maladjust him so that he is unsatis
fied with a commonplace environ
ment."
General trend of thought, at 9:15
when the meeting broke up was that
formalized education in the colleges
was deadening student response, that
the faculty was more to blame than
the students, that elementary edu
cation was more to blame than the
faculty, and that the social system
which emphasized stereotyping and
leveling was worst of all. As the
meeting ended, the announcement,
was made that the discussion will
he further continued.
