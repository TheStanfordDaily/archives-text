# Briefs Read in Lamson Trial
## Prosecutor Takes Stand; Reads Testimony Given By 2 Stanford Women 
### 
SAN JOSE, Feb. 13 (/P).â€”Prose
cutor Allan P. Lindsay took the
stand today in the fourth trial of
David A. Lamson for the Memorial
Day death of his wife, Allene, nearly
three years ago, to read testimony
given at the second trial.
The testimony read was that given
by Mrs. Bainbridge G'owell, who
lived on the Stanford campus near
the Lamson cottage. She told of
seeing from a rear window of her
home, dense smoke rising from a
bonfire in the Lamson yard.
Mrs. Buford O. Brown, widow of
the journalism professor who com
mitted suicide it year ago after tes
tifying at the first Lamson trial,
then took the stand. Mrs. Brown
explained she lived near the Lamson
cottage and that, when the alarm
was sounded the morning of Mrs.
Lamson's death she ran across to
the Lamson house.

She rushed in and went directly
to the bathroom, she said, finding
Lamson on his knees clasping Mrs.
Lamson's bloody head to his breast
and sobbing endearing terms.
