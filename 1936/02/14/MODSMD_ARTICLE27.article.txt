In 15 years of competition Stan
ford has won 10 games from the
University of California. Four of
these are ciedited to John Bunn,
who tame lo Stanford in 1931. In
thai year Bunn coached a team to
a win over the Bears.
The following two years, 1932-
33, saw the Indians blanked. They
got a game in 1934 and another in
1935. This year they have won
one, and John Bunn is confident
of taking another tonight.
Startling many by giving the
team a two-day lay-off from prac
tice, Bunn says: "The two-day
lay-off should give us the zip and
aggressiveness we lacked in los
ing to California two weeks ago.
To me, that aggressiveness is all
we need to win tonight's game."
Following is the record of the
California series from 1921 to 1931,
