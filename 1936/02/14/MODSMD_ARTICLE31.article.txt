# Stoefen Returns to Court But Nobs Gets Starting Call for Center Berth
## 
### Phil Duffy 
Stanford's conference leading bas
ketball team gees on (he floor to
night at Berkeley in an effort to
solve a problem that has withstood
; the assaults of Indian hoop teams for
| 15 long, weary years.
That problem is winning more
than one game in a California se
ries. The score as it now stands
i is California 1, Stanford 1. Win
ning this game tonight does not
only mean defeating the tradi-
I (ional rival, it means the undis
puted lead for the conference title
and a good possibility that Stan
ford will win a basketball series
from the Golden Bears.
With only two days of practice this
week, John Bunn's boys are pulling
I at the bit, and the look in their eyes
bodes ill for "Nibs" Price and his
I lc/ irn.
The only man doubtful of playing
is Art Stoefen, who has been laid up
with the flu. Yesterday he worked
I out for a few minutes and couldn't
ini.ss. Bunn docs not intend to start
him, but the "Stork" will in all
likelihood see action tonight.
Kenny Nobs will start against
j the Bear team in the center posi
tion and shows promise of being
outstanding. Nobs, the "forgotten
man" on the Indian hoop team
made a comeback in the Bruin
games that earned him the start
ing post tonight.
Stanford supporters are afraid to
predict a victory tonight and in
view of the record, you can't blame
them. The Cardinal won its last se
ries from California in 1921. Even
J in that year Stanford didn't make a
very auspicious start for team boast
j ing "SwediV Righter and Jimmy
Davies lost the first Bear fray 30-
; 24, and when ihey were leading the
conference, tco. That threw them
i into a tie with California, and when
| I hey dropped a couple of more games
| to Washington, things looked bad for
i the Indians.
In the second game, on Encina
Courts, the position and the scores
were reversed, when the Cardinal
won, .'5O-24. Jimmy I)avie« made
points this night. The third and
deciding game of the series was
i held in the Oakland Auditorium
before 30,000 people and saw Stan
ford winning the game, 23-21, and
the series with it. Score at half
time was 0-7 /or the Indians and
| Davies had made all nine points.
Me tallied 17 for the evening.
With seconds to go and Stanford
leading 23-10, the spectators began
; to boo at what seemed to be a stall
ing game on the part of the Indians.
However, according to a by-lined
j story by Harry Borba, '22, in The
j Daily Palo Alto, the Stanford team
was confused by the California rush
and didn't know what to do with
the ball.
Finally they drew the defense out
and sank a field goal for the 25th
point.
This win tied the Pacific Coast
Conference between California and
| Stanford, with eight wins and three
| defeats. However, as Stanford had
I won the series, they were given the
j title—the last to come to the Farm.
Tonight, 15 years hence, should
I see the Stanford team winning a
j second game from California.
