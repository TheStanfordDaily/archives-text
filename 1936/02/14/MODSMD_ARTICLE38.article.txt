# Dixie Belles Answer Roughs' 'Susan' Charges
## 
### 
From way <sown south in Dixie
came a letter yesterday addressed
to "Male Student Body, Stanford
University, Pasadena, California"
answering campus roughs' recent
charge that ' Stanford women are
not so hot."
The letter, signed "Ann and
Anita", was written from Bayou
La Batre, Alabama. The "south
ern belles" learned of The Daily's
survey through a news-syndicate
article in their local newspaper.
Said the correspondents:
"There are very few boys who can
carry a tune 'in a basket,' and you
must admit that. Furthermore, prac
tice makes perfect. You call it
rumble-seat-phobia but just why
do you like for a girl to sit in a
rumble-seat with you?
"You say they daub lipstick but
they may be tight with their lip
stick like some of you with your
money.

"Maybe you mistake a girl's not
laughing for dumbness. You criti
cize her fishing for compliments but
maybe she is trying to find out when
she pleases you."
Commenting upon the "1100's"
alleged fake Southern accent, Ann
and Anita said, "We are from the
South and consequently don't have
to affect, but maybe she's been lis
tening to 'Pardon My Southern Ac
cent.'
"The lipstick we get on Palm
Beach suits seems always to please
you when we're getting it there.
He honest. .Running around with
other fellows—say, where's your
sex appeal? Or have you any?"
The men of the Daily yesterday
sent their Alabama "sweethearts" a
special-delivery invitation to come
to Stanford and join the staff—hop
ing they wouldn't get waylaid in
Pasadena.
