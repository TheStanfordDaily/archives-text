Forcibly ousted by scowling Vox-
Campied roughs, the little bare

i girls" had come to their uot-too
obvious senses.
While Romance rose to high lem
j peratures at other hangouts of
youth, Cupid whimpered a little and
told The Daiiy thai he'd never met
| such cold response as he got at
Stanford.
"They just wouldn't recognize
ine," he cooed angrily. "One fel
low even said the roughs were
going to boycott the girls."
The roly-poly Hearts-and-Flow
ers Kid then headed off toward Ber
keley with a word that "when my
henchman, Spring, gets around a
little later, you poor simps will proh
! ably return to normal."
