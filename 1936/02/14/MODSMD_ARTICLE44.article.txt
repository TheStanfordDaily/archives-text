Perhaps unwittingly, probably on
purpose, The Daily today admits a
fact that has been officially sup
pressed on the campus for a number
of years. In this issue, The Daily, for
the first time, marks one of its
pages "For Women Only."

This marks a campus realization,
fought against in many cases ever
since the passing of the "500" made
it necessary, that Stanford has
changed from primarily a "man's
school" to an actual co-educational
institution.
We women now number 1099, a
Jratio of one to two and one-half in
proportion to the 2681 men regis
tered in the University this quarter.
Now that we have become an inte
gral part of Stanford, we deserve
the belated recognition that we are
at last getting.

The Daily is on the spot as far as
"In View of the Eleven Hundred"
is concerned. The campus frowns
on gossip columns and society* "guff"
as being high-schoolish. Yet we
want to cover news that is lively and
pertinent to women.
Fashions, sports, women's activi
ties, features on prominent campus
women, will be our piece de resis
tance. "Farm Daughters," a running
commentary on women's news of the
week, will be a feature. Jane Hee
nan will summarize the sports of
the week in her column entitled
"Skirts in Sports." The women of
the staff, assisted by special writers,
will cover the remainder of the news.
Since our purpose is to make this
page "for" and "of" the "Eleven
Hundred," criticism and suggestions
will be welcomed.
