# Spring Styles Listed for Campus Wear
## Tailored Suits, Front Pleats, Shirtwaists, Score as Headliners 
### 
"Warm and clearing," says the
weather prophet. So members of the
"1100" critically view their dark
winter wardrobe and begin a flurry
of spring buying.
Full-in-front skirts are the head
liners for spring wear. Front pleats
and front fullness are both featured,
even in tailored suits.
Pearls Win Out
Pearls with sweaters, long worn at
Vassal - and Wellesley, are beginning
to appear on the campus. Short
sleeved pastel sweaters, which are
still good in angora, will be worn
with starched collar if not with a
single strand of small pearls.
"There's nothing new under the
sun," says the old saying. And to
prove its point, back comes the short
low-backed dress for evening. It's
worn with a jacket during the day,
and at night emerges for dancing,
day-time length but formal-topped.
Linens Still Good
Uncrushable linens will be tops j
for spring Quad wear. They will
come in the still-good shirtwaist
style, in the three-piece short-sports
sets, and in backless tennis dresses
with waist-length jackets.
Very light-weight pastel wools are
also good, in tailored styles. For
warmer days, rough silk crepe, still
in variations of the short-waist, will
be seen.
Navy Blue Leads
Navy blue is the leading color for
spring afternoon wear. With accents
of white, dull pink, or pastels it is
always crisp.
New cellophane laces and mar
ganza will be major novelties for
evening wear. Chiffon, which was
revived recently, will still be worn.
Anything sheer and crisp, or soft and
floaty, will do for summer. Even the
draped silk crepes are still shown.
No radical change has been made in
lines for summer, and no theme
comparable to summer-before-last's
nautical has as yet developed.
