# Stanford Goes Social With Eight Dances
## 
### 
Gala week-ends loom ahead for
the campus, as four dances are listed
for tonight and three for next week.
Four different Valentine motifs have
been planned, as two off-campus and
two campus affairs will attract the
Farm.
Delta Tau Delta is giving a formal
at the house. Phi Gamma Delta and
Phi Kappa Psi collaborate on an off
campus dance. Toyon features eight
foot red hearts and elaborate deco
rations while the Zetes give tonights
only informal. Robie contributes a
jolly -up next Wednesday, while
Gamma Phi Beta, Lagunita, and
Theta Chi all plan to entertain next
Friday.

A fashion show, exhibiting styles
in beach outfits, casual street dresses,
dinner dresses, and evening gowns,
was given following dinner at La
gunita Court Wednesday night. Mod
els were worn by women living in
the hall.
