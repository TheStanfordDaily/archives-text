# Need for Unification Led To 'Cap and Gown' Society
## 
### Margaret Loud 
Cap and Gown was established in
I (he reconstruction period that fol
lowed the disastrous earthquake of
1906. Originally conceived before
the quake, the idea of forming such
a women's honorary society was
abruptly halted on the terrifying
night when the chapel spire fell
and the Quad arches crumbled.
When school was resumed again
in the fall, the society was finally
set up, the outgrowth of a move
ment. to unify the various women's
activities through prominent repre
sentatives and to build a women's
clubhouse. Edith Mirrielees, now of
the English department, was one of
the founders.
Election to Cap and Gown is one of i
(he highest honors that a Stanford ;
woman can attain. To be eligible, j
she must have excelled in one ac- j
tivity or been prominent in two, and
must have completed 100 units of j
university work, with an average
over half-way between a B and a C.
Honorary members are chosen
! from the faculty or other outstand- j
I ing campus women. At present, the I
| list includes Mrs. Herbert Hoover, j
Mrs. Almon Roth, Mrs. John C.
Branner, and Mrs. Harriet Ryan. The j
honorary members meet with and |
aid the actives in their various proj
ects.
Informal contact with the older i
members is maintained through 1
dinners, hold twice a month at alum- j
' nae homes, and week-ends in the
Santa Cruz mountains, held once a '
quarter.
Cap and Gown is a purely local
I organization. Though its require-!

merits for membership arc similar
to those of the national Mortar
Board, the two are in no way re
lated. Cap and Gown does, however,
affiliate members of Mortar Board
and other college women's honorary
societies.
The principal function of Cap and
Gown is to represent the interests of
all women concerned with the cam
pus. It gives teas for freshman
women and maintains a scholarship
and loan fund. Likewise, it suggests
possible approaches to problems
concerning women students.

Cap and Gown is a purely local
I organization. Though its require-!

merits for membership arc similar
to those of the national Mortar
Board, the two are in no way re
lated. Cap and Gown does, however,
affiliate members of Mortar Board
and other college women's honorary
societies.
The principal function of Cap and
Gown is to represent the interests of
all women concerned with the cam
pus. It gives teas for freshman
women and maintains a scholarship
and loan fund. Likewise, it suggests
possible approaches to problems
concerning women students.
