## 
### 
Semi-final matches in intra-mural
badminton are scheduled for this
week and next, with mixed doubles,
and men's and women's singles be
ing played. Seven women and eight
men are remaining in the tourna
ment, which is being played in the
women's gym.
In mixed doubles, Harold Keith-
Betty Camm, Mary Morris Boggs-
Glen Smith, Alberta Carden-Jack
! Hill, and Bill Monroe - Katherine
| Crommelin are still in the running.

The staff itself has not been
changed since Miss Yost's departure.
If any special situation should arise,
the settlement of it would be di
rected to whoever was most closely
connected with the subject in quest
ion. In this way, the division of
duties among various staff members
provides for complete coverage of
all women's activities.
