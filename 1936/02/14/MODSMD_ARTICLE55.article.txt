SOPHS. SENIORS REMAIN
, UNDEFEATED

With half of the first round of in
| terclass basketball already com
pleted, the sophs and seniors stand
undefeated at the top of the ladder.
In the season's opener, Tuesday, the
| seniors displayed considerable pow
| er in winning over the frosh, 38-25.
While not up to their last year's
form, the sophs had little trouble
overcoming the juniors, who were
handicapped without the services of
Caryll Mudd. The juniors scored
only three points in the first half,
but managed to bring the final count
up to 28-IT) in the sophs' favor.
In the third game, played yester
day, the blue-clad juniors regained
their old-time form and defeated
the freshmen, 39-15.
The seniors have a well-organized,
experienced team fortified by a
number of capable substitutes. Dot
ty Burgers, senior captain, made 17
points in the frosh game and is one
of the leading scorers.

JUNIOR TEAM SAME
FOR THREE YEARS

That same freshman f<>am is intact
today, with Caryll Mudd, Ruth Goo
dan, and Betty Grover still holding
down Lhe forward positions and Kay
Moran, Phyl Boothe, and Trolley
I Mitchell still the regular guards.

The latter three have been playing
together since their Marlborough
days and have worked up a smooth,
fast combination that is pretty to
watch.
The orange-pinnied sophs, champs
last year, appear to have another
strong aggregation witH Barbara
Murphy, Matie Farmer, and Kay
Kennedy playing a good game at
forward and with Sis Coonley out
standing at guard. This afternoon's
game between the red and the or
ange, both undefeated teams, should
prove to be a deciding factor in the
championship race.

FROSII STIEL
HAVE A CHANCE

Though the frosh have lost their
first two encounters they still have
a good team—one that is fast and
one that will undoubtedly improve
a great deal in the next few weeks.
Their greatest weaknesses right now
are their inexperience and their in
ability to function as a unit—faults
which every freshman team has to
overcome.
Monday and Tuesday the final
games of the first round will be
played, with the frosh meeting the
sophs, and the juniors encountering
!he seniors. The latter game should
be close and full of thrills.
