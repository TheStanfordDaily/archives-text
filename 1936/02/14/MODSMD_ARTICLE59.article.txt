# Star Cal Rugby Transfer Bolsters Indians' Hopes
## 
### 
A new star appeared on the Stan
| ford rugby horizon last night in the

' person of John "My" Bueh-
I lor, a transfer from the University
! of California, where he was an out
! standing rugger last year.
! His stellar performance at second
j rank in the scrum yesterday drew a
! broad smile from Coach Wylie.
â–  Every bit of added strength will
| come in handy against the Univer
j sity of San Francisco fifteen tomor
row and U.C.L.A. next week.
