Oregon's sensational team of cham
pions. Four Northern Division and
two Pacific Northwest A.A.U. title
holders swim for the Webfeet.
In spite of this array «kf "greats,"
pre-meet dope figures the visitors
favorites for a close 43-40 win, j
"giving every break to Oregon," ]
according to Coach Nort Thornton
of Stanford. The northern swim
mers were scouted Wednesday
evening when they beat San Jose j
47-37, throwing away Ihe medley
relay event when ihe Indian
"spectators" were spotted.
The 440-yard free-style relay is a ;
standout for the Cardinals. Chuck j
Reed should have no trouble in tak- ,
ing the breast stroke for the visitors;
but there will be a real fight among
John Harvey and Mel Jacoby of 1
Stanford, and Forest Kerby of Ore- i
gon, for second and third. Bob
Walker is favored to touch out divi- J
sion champ James Reed in the 150- j
yard back-stroke.
Great races are predicted for the
50 and the MM), with Hurd and
Hoffman representing the visitors.
Who they'll swim against in the
50 is undecided, but any one of
Bill Lhamon, Jack Vibcrt, or
Martin Scatena has a good chance
to win the event for Stanford.
Hurd will be pitted against God
man and Captain Jack Ku'm in the
100.
Biggest race of the day should be i
the quarter-mile between Harold
Sexton of Oregon and Don Peterson
of Stanford. Peterson last week
won by a whisker over Harold
Weatherbe of the Olympic Club,
who has taken Sexton in two out
of their three starts against each
other. Vibert with a 2:19.8 to his
credit, looks t y>od for a Stanford win
in the 220.
Admission to the meet is by stu
dent body card.
