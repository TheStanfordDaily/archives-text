AS THOUSANDS JEER:
EDWARDS GYM TONIGHT

While all tho stooges around here
i are sticking out the beagle trying to
: find out where Howell Turner went i
the Saturday night he was down'
South, here's a brief summary of the
| way the basketball boys calculate
| they'll go to .lie Olympic Games—or i
at least win the Cal Conference.
There's been a lot of breeze waft- j
| ing around to the effect that the cage
boys are cocky. All that can be said j
is a curt "Oh yeah?" The boys really |
i plan to win the loop pennant. Here's
I how:
Beat Cal twice anil S.C. at least
once.
Easy, huh?
Now the first thing is that we'll j
win the last game from Cal, played i
here in our very own Pavilion, the '
one Trudi Schoop came to love so. ■
That one's already practically in the !
J kelvinator.
The game tonight will be a bit
■ harder to win.
| Stanford lias never sipped the
1 cup of victory in that barn, fa
miliarly termed "The Berkeley
800 and Jinx Pavilion," with se
lected short subjects.
This year we all think Stanford's
I got a better ball club, but the 45,000
howling, shrieking, cat-calling Blue
( 'n' Gold fans and the 390-piece sil
} ver cornet band won't let us proclaim
' same up in that hall. There is also
an abbreviated gent named Balsley
! and his partner, Olson, who help win.
All this notwithstanding, h'yever,
Bunn and his boys frankly think
they'll garner a majority of the
1 points tonight.
Then they roll down to Troy
land next week. They should win
the first one, but if they don't
they'll win the second, so there are
the three games and the eonfer
j encc title.
NOW THAT series with Wash-
S ington (won eight, lost no games so
; far) will be a peach.
It's as difficult to know anything
! about that series right now as it is
I-to know anything about the Ethiop
j ian front anytime.
Washington beat Stanford in two
close games December 27 and 28.
But the Cards up north were play
ing ball far below their usual speed.
People who saw those games say
our boys were not putting any
thing into the fray at all. They
1 weren't playing the aggressive, fast
bieaking brand of ball they have
shown consistently down here,
