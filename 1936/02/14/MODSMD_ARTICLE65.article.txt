# U.S.C. Hoopmen Favored Over Bruins
## 
### 
When Stanford and California
hoopsters tangle tonight at Berke
ley undisputed Indian leadership of
the southern division is almost cer
tain to hinge on the outcome. U.S.C.
is an overwhelming favorite to de
feat U.C.L.A. and climb into a first
place tie with John Bunn's men if
the latter lose.
By defeating the Bears, Stanford
could tighten her grip on the title,
regardless of (he outcome in Los An
geles.
