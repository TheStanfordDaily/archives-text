## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" Co-operation Through Criticism Professors Might Open up About Current Affairs Before They Consider Panaceas 
### 
Professor Harold Hand of the economics
department added to liis reputation for being
a broad-minded educator when he made a
public statement recently to the elled that ■
schools should "tell all" to students.
What the professor actually said was that
students should study Communism, Fascism,
Upton Sinclair, Dr. Townsend, and the Demo
cratic- platform so they can "size them up."
Of course such teachings would not be tol- j
crated in grade or high schools. The col- ;
leges are the only possibilities. Stanford ap- i
proaches the limit of current convention with I
such courses ;is "Political Panaceas" in which
the major "isms" are weighed briellv.
In reality, though, students do not miss
discussions of modern governmental pana
ceas. They do object, however, to being dc- j
prived of interpretation of the government in
its present form and condition. Professors in
political science, economics, and history have
very definite and usually sound views on New
Deal maneuvers, court decisions, and foreign

affairs, but few of them ever present them in
classes.
• This is not true, however, of all the faculty.
Some members of the law and business
schools have no qualms about saying what
they think. Hut undergraduates on the whole
must be content with a stale dessert of
months-old bash-overs with their regular diet
of textbook material.
What chance is there of a change in admin
istration this year? Is Mussolini really light
ing a war to bolster a weakened spirit of na
tionalism? Questions like these aren't usually
answered in classrooms.
Professor Hand has a point in his liberalism
doctrine. First, however, the professors, who
admittedly are authorities on their various
subjects, might analyze the current changing
and turbulent political and economic scene
while the material is timely. Then the sev
eral suggestions for Utopia could come under
the academic microscope.
