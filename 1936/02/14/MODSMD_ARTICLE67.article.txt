What is wrong with college education?
The twenty-two students and three faculty
men who gathered 'round the Walrus Cluh
hoard last night recognized that as a really
pertinent question, and although they didn't
come away with an exact answer, they did
agree that all is not perfection in universities
generally.
For example, Dr. Harold Brown boldly
staled that "most students are ruined in their
freshman year"â€”ruined so far as their being
able to get ;i liberal education, that is. One
of the reasons for this, he said, was out-moded
systems of formal education which tend to
"educate a student so that he adjusts himself
to his situation like a contented cow."
One of the most gratifying things about a
discussion of this kind is the proof presented
that someone besides campaigning magazine
and newspaper writers is really beginning
to take the defects of college education seri
ously.
The Walrus clubbers didn't pretend to settle
definitely the weighty question they discussed.
Instead they attempted to incite interest in a
subject on which definite student opinion is
needed.
Their live, liberal confab last night certainly
was advantage well taken of Stanford's tra
ditional freedom of expression, and will lead
to other and even more revealing discussions,
both formal and informal.
