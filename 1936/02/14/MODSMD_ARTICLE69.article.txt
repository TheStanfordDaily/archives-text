Los Angeles is in a definite shape, thai of a fan,
and its long, straight highways through the city ex
tend for some 40 miles with scarcely a curve.
L.A. sends more students to Stanford than any
other city in the world.
I acknowledge these facts. I respect Los Angeles
for these wonderful contribution* to the world and to
Stanford. I was trying only to bp helpful when I men
tioned that 75 per cent of the vagrants entering Cali
fornia go to Los Angeles. Because it is easy to see that
the vagrants, the bums, and the hoboes are the smart
est people down there.
In proof of this, I efier to you yesterday's comment
in Campus Opinion.
If we don't get rid of this Los Angeles weather
plenty soon, however, I'm going to quit and go home
to Salinas, which has no highways, no boulevards. The
streets bend in the wrong places. Salinas does not
send any students to Stanford, they have to pay their
own way, just like ordinary mortals. Salinas is not
spread out in the sh ipe of a lan. In fact, it is not
spread out at all. It has enough sense left to stand
up. I am proud of Salinas. Siilinas gets the 25 per
cent of the vagrants that do not go to Los Angeles.
Apropos of the humid wea'her of late is a talc told
on a biology professor. He looked around his class
one soggy morning and discovered that Smith was not
there. "Where is Smith this morning?"
A Certain Student responded: "Oh, the rain prob
ably washed him away, he lives way out in the sticks."
"Yes, I know," said the prof. "He lives across the
street from me."
Well, now that I have abolished Los Angeles, I
can really start concentrating on the weather. But
we'll all have to wait until after Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day is a very important day. It is the
annual anniversary of the Ti'ans-Oceanic Amalgamated
Snake Men, founded at the Dawn of History in the
Garden of Eden, which also did not have streets that
curved. Some apples, oh keed? We must also con
gratulate the telegraph and candy companies on this
important occasion.

Los Angeles is in a definite shape, thai of a fan,
and its long, straight highways through the city ex
tend for some 40 miles with scarcely a curve.
L.A. sends more students to Stanford than any
other city in the world.
I acknowledge these facts. I respect Los Angeles
for these wonderful contribution* to the world and to
Stanford. I was trying only to bp helpful when I men
tioned that 75 per cent of the vagrants entering Cali
fornia go to Los Angeles. Because it is easy to see that
the vagrants, the bums, and the hoboes are the smart
est people down there.
In proof of this, I efier to you yesterday's comment
in Campus Opinion.
If we don't get rid of this Los Angeles weather
plenty soon, however, I'm going to quit and go home
to Salinas, which has no highways, no boulevards. The
streets bend in the wrong places. Salinas does not
send any students to Stanford, they have to pay their
own way, just like ordinary mortals. Salinas is not
spread out in the sh ipe of a lan. In fact, it is not
spread out at all. It has enough sense left to stand
up. I am proud of Salinas. Siilinas gets the 25 per
cent of the vagrants that do not go to Los Angeles.
Apropos of the humid wea'her of late is a talc told
on a biology professor. He looked around his class
one soggy morning and discovered that Smith was not
there. "Where is Smith this morning?"
A Certain Student responded: "Oh, the rain prob
ably washed him away, he lives way out in the sticks."
"Yes, I know," said the prof. "He lives across the
street from me."
Well, now that I have abolished Los Angeles, I
can really start concentrating on the weather. But
we'll all have to wait until after Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day is a very important day. It is the
annual anniversary of the Ti'ans-Oceanic Amalgamated
Snake Men, founded at the Dawn of History in the
Garden of Eden, which also did not have streets that
curved. Some apples, oh keed? We must also con
gratulate the telegraph and candy companies on this
important occasion.
