Forced Feeding Process
(From Montana Daily Kiamin)
Among the many charges against the college grad
uate is his failure to keep up with later developments
because all he got out of college was the habit of in
tellectual dependence.
The writer of a Saturday Evening Post article
quoted a distinguished American public servant in
reflection on the situation: "As a class you (college
graduates) stand for nothing, not even for decency
i in art or the movies, or for honesty in business or
public administration, and some of the worst crooks
in our recent financial scandals were graduates and
holders of honorary degrees of our supposedly high
class colleges. In looking over the forces that may
put our country back to work on a sound basis, I
count you out. You are the big American disappoint
j ment."
The writer says (hat the institutions must take
time out to humanize the students and inculcate a
deeper sense of responsibility. To do this effectively
professors and alumni must rid themselves "of that
complacency which has been and is now the greatest
single obstacle lhat bars significant advance upon any
J wide front in American college education," the article
says.
The college student must do a great deal for him
, self if he is going to compete in post-college years with
! non-college men of great intellect whose natural abil
ities have been developed by themselves on ihe hard
| road of experience, without the guidance of professors.
It is evident that students who are not able to thus
j teach themselves to assume responsibility will only
j contribute to the great stream of bachelors of arts
' who don't stay educated, the reason being that their
education was a forced feeding process. As a group
these students are destined to become the targets for
j the shrewd darts of the non-college men who stay
educated because th'jir education was a responsibility
1 they themselves assumed.
