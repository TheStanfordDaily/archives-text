# ONE MAN BAND

### 
; The Editor, Sir:
Tuesday night the co-eds in
Manzanita hit upon an idea which, if
j carried out by the rest of the girls'
living groups on the campus may
revolutionize the primeval and
; moth-eaten dancing vogue of the
vanquished five hundred. It seems
; that the girls wanted a jolly-up, and
I instead of resorting to the ancient
i notion that a whole band was neces
sary. engaged a darn good pianist.
Strange as it seems, that particular
i group suddenly realized a fact long
; since recognized by other wiser uni
| versity groups—more sorority dances
j at less expense. An idea worth con
| sidering! Sam Beckley
