TOKYO, Feb. 17 (Monday) (/P).—
The Manchukuoan government dis
patched a strong protest early today
to the Outer Mongolian Peoples' Re
public, demanding immediate evacu
tation of what was called Manchu
kuoan territory.
Dispatches from Hsinking, capital
of the Japanese-fostered state of
Manchukuo, said that Mongolians—
who are allied with Soviet Russia—
attacked in Manchukuoan territory
Saturday.
Two columns of Mongol troops,
said Japanese dispatches from Hsin
king, attacked Asailsumu, west of
Lake Bor and west of Lake Ola
hodka.
The correspondents in Hsinking
reported they were unable to obtain
details of the fighting, leading to
surmises that either a censorship
had been imposed or that Manchu
kuoan claims the enemy had been
repulsed were unsubstantiated.
The War Office in Tokyo said it
lacked official confirmation of the
battle.
