# Leg Amputation Closes Career Of Circus Clown
## 
### 
OAKLAND, Feb. 16 (/P).â€” Cho
Cho, the original circus clown whose
buffoonery evoked chortles of young
and old during half a century under
the "big tent," will frolic no more.
Surgeons amputated Cho Cho's
right leg yesterday to spare the life
of William H. Lea, 73, his alter ego.
Three months ago Cho Cho with
drew from retirement and joined
the Billy Rose troupe of yesterday's
circus stars in the show "Jumbo."
Beneath New York Hippodrome's
familiar tiers Cho Cho tumbled,
grimaced and cavorted much as he
had done thousands of times before.
Cho Cho persevered but finally
had to give up. He hastened to his
homo in nearby Albany 17 days ago
for a complete rest.
