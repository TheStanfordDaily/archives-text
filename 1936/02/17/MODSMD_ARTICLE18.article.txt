# Fight Predicted In Legislation For Neutrality
## Tax Program May Be Submitted to Congress This Week: Levies Are Uncertain 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (/P).â€”A
quickening congressional pace to
night found administration leaders
determined to whip neutrality legis
lation through both House and Sen
ate next week.
Stiff fights were in prospect. But
leaders were so confident of their j
strength that House consideration of
Senate-approved farm legislation is
tentatively scheduled for Wednes- !
day.
Tax Program Ready
With the bonus issue already out
of the way, disposal of the neutrality
and farm questions in the seventh
week of the session would leave tax- 1
ation as the only major barrier in
the path of a May 1 adjournment
goal.
The tax program, President Roose- !
velt has indicated, may be ready for j
submission on Capitol Hill this week.
Whether it will embrace new levies I
for bonus payment as well as farm
subsidies is uncertain.
Court Verdict Awaited
Shadowing the whole situation is !
the Supreme Court. A decision ad
verse to the government in the Ten
nessee Valley case, in which a ver
dict may be announced tomorrow,
undoubtedly would stimulate agita
tion to curb the tribunal's powers.
Up to the present, however, the
increasingly audible drive for such
a curb has been restrained by un
willingness of many in Congress to 1
consider such a controversial step in
a campaign year.
