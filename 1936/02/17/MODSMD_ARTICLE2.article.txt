# Exes, Olympic Trials Conflict
## Committee Meeting March 5 To Solve Basketball Difficulties; 'Semi' Eliminations Scheduled 
### 
As word from Willis O. Hunter,
Western Division chairman of the
Olympic Games Committee on Bas
ketball, reaches the Farm, with an
nouncement that the elimination
tournament will he held March 13
and 14, Stanford faces its current
problemâ€”conflict of athletic and
scholastic dates. In this case it's
winter quarter finals scheduled for
March 17.
May Make Exceptions
To settle the matter, the Faculty
Athletic Committee is slated to Rath
er on March 5 to decide whether
basketball men may be granted spe
cial privileges and permitted to par
ticipate within the restricted limit
of 10 days before finals.
Though officials of the committee
declined to comment definitely last
night, it is believed the proposed
special grant to basketball men will
be made this year in view of the
fact that Olympic participation is a
new field for intercollegiate hard
wood teams, and is only offered once
in every four years.
State Scries Planned
Hunter's plan of elimination for
Divisions 10 and 11, including Ne
vada, California, Arizona, and Ore
gon. Washington, Idaho respectively,
is this: Conference winners of both
Northern and Southern divisions au
tomatically advance to the coast
semi-finals, and other semi-finalists
will be selected by district playoffs
in the two divisions.
Winner of the semi's will travel to
Now York to meet four other district
champs in the finals at Madison
Square Garden in April.
