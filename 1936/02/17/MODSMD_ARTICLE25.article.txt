serious flood threat, following on the
heels of Friday night's sudden col
lapse of Ihe ice jam binding the

bringing relief to Richmond's har
ried waterfront.
All concern was not abandoned,
however, the erratic river still hold
ing threats of danger to river from
property. Sandbag dike were laid
to hold back the river should a sud
den change raise it above the danger
line and repeat the performance of
last September when the James

deprived the city of gas for 24 hours.
