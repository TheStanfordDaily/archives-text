## Indians Defeat S.F. Staters 38-25; Will Face U. S. F. On Wednesday; Gun for Trojans 
### Roger Kimball 
Once more tied with U.S.C. for
first place, Indian varsity basketeers
prepare to settle things with the
Trojans in two games at Los Angeles
this week-end. U.S.F. will bring a
strong team to the Pavilion Wednes
day evening to help get Stanford
ready.
Stanford was too ready at Berke
ley Friday night. Erratic and panicky
as they fell far behind in the open
ing minutes, the Indians, blew up
in the second half, allowing a "hot"
Bear quintet to pile up a 63-30 score.
It was the most one-sided defeat a
Stanford cage team has suffered in
many years.
f Trim S.F. State
The Cards were a different bunch
in their 38-2r> win over San Fran
c "o State on the Farm Saturday
e ng. Coach John Bunn started
a \ . n composed of Bill Quade and
Ken Bell, forwards; Ken Nobs, cen
ter; and "Nellie" Heath and Sparky
Robertson, guards. That outfit played
the underrated city five on even
terms, and Luisetti, Turner, Calder
wood, and Moore easily pulled ahead
as the game drew to a close. Nobs
played the entire game at center.

"The second team handled the ball
exceptionally well," says Bunn,
speaking of tne state tussle, "but the
boys passed up a lot of scoring
chances. The Teachers weren't bad
at all."
Bears Too Hot
Captain Ray Olson, Don Jensen,
and Bob Herwig of California were
just too much for the Indians in the
Berkeley gym. In the first half,
Stanford's defense worked fairly
well, but, the Bears couldn't seem to
miss from any point on the floor.
"My boys were tense, and missed a
lot of good shots in that second
half," Bunn explained. "Cal got way
ahead of them again, and they got
disorganized, but they never quit
fighting."
Luisetti High
All the Cards were off form, and
they had th? luck to meet a cool
Bear team playing at top speed.
Hank Luisetti took a beating, get
ting well acquainted with the floor,
but he still rang up 15 points. Only
Olson, who tanked 17, outscored
Hank
"Nellie Heath looked about as
steady as anyone else," remarked the
Indian mentor. Heath got into the
game with Quade, Bell, and Rob
ertson in the closing minutes.
"U.S.F. will give us plenty of
trouble," continued Bunn. Led by
Ed Lewis, high-scoring forward, the
Dons have made a good record again
this year. The Indians will practice
today and tomorrow, with all hands,
including Art Stoefen, on deck, a
little battered but otherwise in the
best shape.

Ken Bell, forwards; Ken Nobs, cen
ter; and "Nellie" Heath and Sparky
Robertson, guards. That outfit played
the underrated city five on even
terms, and Luisetti, Turner, Calder
wood, and Moore easily pulled ahead
as the game drew to a close. Nobs
played the entire game at center.

"The second team handled the ball
exceptionally well," says Bunn,
speaking of tne state tussle, "but the
boys passed up a lot of scoring
chances. The Teachers weren't bad
at all."
Bears Too Hot
Captain Ray Olson, Don Jensen,
and Bob Herwig of California were
just too much for the Indians in the
Berkeley gym. In the first half,
Stanford's defense worked fairly
well, but, the Bears couldn't seem to
miss from any point on the floor.
"My boys were tense, and missed a
lot of good shots in that second
half," Bunn explained. "Cal got way
ahead of them again, and they got
disorganized, but they never quit
fighting."
Luisetti High
All the Cards were off form, and
they had th? luck to meet a cool
Bear team playing at top speed.
Hank Luisetti took a beating, get
ting well acquainted with the floor,
but he still rang up 15 points. Only
Olson, who tanked 17, outscored
Hank
"Nellie Heath looked about as
steady as anyone else," remarked the
Indian mentor. Heath got into the
game with Quade, Bell, and Rob
ertson in the closing minutes.
"U.S.F. will give us plenty of
trouble," continued Bunn. Led by
Ed Lewis, high-scoring forward, the
Dons have made a good record again
this year. The Indians will practice
today and tomorrow, with all hands,
including Art Stoefen, on deck, a
little battered but otherwise in the
best shape.
Once more tied with U.S.C. for
first place, Indian varsity basketeers
prepare to settle things with the
Trojans in two games at Los Angeles
this week-end. U.S.F. will bring a
strong team to the Pavilion Wednes
day evening to help get Stanford
ready.
Stanford was too ready at Berke
ley Friday night. Erratic and panicky
as they fell far behind in the open
ing minutes, the Indians, blew up
in the second half, allowing a "hot"
Bear quintet to pile up a 63-30 score.
It was the most one-sided defeat a
Stanford cage team has suffered in
many years.
