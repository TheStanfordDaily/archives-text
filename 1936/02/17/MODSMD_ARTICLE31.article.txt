# Gray Matter

### Gray Creveling 
J HIS COLUMN'S new title (see
above) is Gray Matter. Thanks,
Garred, come around and collect.
EVEN SHAKESPEARE, if he were
alive today and writing a comedy
concerning the American Congress,
could not invent a better name for a
typical congressman than that be
stowed on PERCY L. C.ASSAWAY,
Oklahoma Representative, by the
legislator's forebears.
MTEIIARY DIGEST'S straw poll
has pleased the Republicans. They
pat their elephant's belly and say,
"Never you mind, Geeopee, we'll ,
cat in '37." The Democrats kick
their jackass and sing, "It don't mean >
a thing if it ain't got that swing |
(the November ballot)!"
ISOTII PARTIES, however, should
not. overlook the fact that if the
presidential election were held to
day, Roosevelt would be re-elected;
that the election is seven months off.
Also that the 37 per cent FOR
Roosevelt's New Deal are solid in
backlog it; that the 63 per cent
AGAINST are divided between Re
publicans, Socialists, Communists, |
Kick-out-the-Saloonjsts, Farmer- i
Laborites, etc. Finally, that the poll :
was one taken among what a class- ,
conscious European would term "the
bourgeoisie." A poll among the
farmers and laborers might return a ,
more favorable result as far as the j
New Deal is concerned.
WIIAT'LL HAPPEN when Roose- j
velt turns on the heat is something ;
far different than Digest Poll results
show.
THE AMERICAN PEACE Confer
ence which the President proposed l
to 20 American republics during the >
last month and announced only yes
terday in the newspapers is a spec- |
tacular move, and in keeping with
the prevailing American attitude
toward peace.
"Pure demagogery is pure dem
ocracy," old man Scripps of the
newspaper chain used to say.
IN SPITE of the much publicized
A1 Smith broadside at the New Deal,
the President's popularity has shown
a marked increase for the last month
as shown in the American Institute
of Public Opinion's weekly report in
yesterday's Chronicle.
IF SUCH TIRADES as Smith's
popularize the President, what will J
happen when Roosevelt turns on the 1
heat instead tf sitting passively by
on being attacked?
HEALTHY REACTION is the fail
ure of the U.S. to any longer follow
blindly a leader, no matter how good
he may or may not be.
It is not entirely a case of biting
the hand that fed them when they
most needed nutrition, when the big
business men of the nation form
Liberty Leagues, etc. It's just the
return of a balance wheel that was
temporarily thrown off in the hys
teria of the first Roosevelt years.

cat in '37." The Democrats kick
their jackass and sing, "It don't mean >
a thing if it ain't got that swing |
(the November ballot)!"
ISOTII PARTIES, however, should
not. overlook the fact that if the
presidential election were held to
day, Roosevelt would be re-elected;
that the election is seven months off.
Also that the 37 per cent FOR
Roosevelt's New Deal are solid in
backlog it; that the 63 per cent
AGAINST are divided between Re
publicans, Socialists, Communists, |
Kick-out-the-Saloonjsts, Farmer- i
Laborites, etc. Finally, that the poll :
was one taken among what a class- ,
conscious European would term "the
bourgeoisie." A poll among the
farmers and laborers might return a ,
more favorable result as far as the j
New Deal is concerned.

THE AMERICAN PEACE Confer

"Pure demagogery is pure dem
ocracy," old man Scripps of the

IN SPITE of the much publicized
A1 Smith broadside at the New Deal,
the President's popularity has shown
a marked increase for the last month
as shown in the American Institute
of Public Opinion's weekly report in
yesterday's Chronicle.
IF SUCH TIRADES as Smith's
popularize the President, what will J
happen when Roosevelt turns on the 1
heat instead tf sitting passively by
on being attacked?
HEALTHY REACTION is the fail
ure of the U.S. to any longer follow
blindly a leader, no matter how good
he may or may not be.
It is not entirely a case of biting
the hand that fed them when they
most needed nutrition, when the big
business men of the nation form
Liberty Leagues, etc. It's just the
return of a balance wheel that was
temporarily thrown off in the hys
teria of the first Roosevelt years.
