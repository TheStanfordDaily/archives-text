CLEVELAND, Feb. 16 (/P).—A
large share of the world's great
scientific and literary accomplish
ments are directly attributable to
indigestion, Dr. T. Wingate Todd
of Western Reserve University's
School of Medicine declared today.
"Genius doubtless, like an army,
travels on its stomach, but what a
stomach!"
Choosing Samuel Johnson as a
"f/ood example," he said:
"There is no doubt at all of
Johnson's chronic indigestion and
the resultant cantankerous dispo
sition with which there goes a
brilliance of imagery and creative
thought.
"Benedick's 'quick wit and
queasy stomach' (in Shake
speare's "Much Ado About Noth
ing") reminds us of the indebted
ness of both literature and science
to indigestion.
"Would Darwin have framed
the theory of evolution had it
not, been for the imagery created
by his chronic indigestion?
"How much of Poe's tales of
mystery and imagination were due
to indigestion and how much to
alcohol?"
