# Lake Lagunita Season On as Canoe Capsizes
## 
### 
Champagne splattered over the
bow of Fiji's canoe. Then Jack
Downey stepped into the bow. It
tipped. Splash! and Christener
Downey learned with stark reality
that Lake Lagunita was "the coldest
it's been in years."
Thus was Stanford's man-made
Lake Lagunita opened Saturday to
campus canoers for the 1936 season.
Living groups brought 15 canoes
to the boathouse, and boathouse of
ficials looked for a booming season
ahead.
More than 50 persons Saturday,
35 yesterday, helped open the lake
as they laughed at threatening black
clouds, went canoeing anyway.
Heavy rains during the past week
had yesterday brought Lagunita's
I volume to its capacity. If rains con
tinue, the resulting overflow will be
drawn off through drainage pipes.
When the spring and summer dry
season comes, the lake will probably
go down because of seepage through
the muddy bottom. Volume yester-
day was estimated at between 75,â€”
000,000 and 100,000,000 gallons.
