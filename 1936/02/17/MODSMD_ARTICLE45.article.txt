# Workers Find Real Gold on Angell Field
## 
### 
Angell Field is a veritable gold
mine. If someone dug it up he
would probably find bits of the
precious metal. But it wouldn't
be worth much, merely the gold
leaf on pieces of mosaic.
During the earthquake, the mo
saic across 'he front of the Chapel
fell, and the pieces changed from
art to paving material, used as an
underlayer in paving campus
roads. Great chunks of it helped
to (ill in Angell Field. A small
part found its way into profes
sors gardens, and superfluous
pieces were tossed into the creek.
When Angell Field was dug up
to build the new track, workers
I'ounJ chunks of the mosaic. More
of it was discovered in excavating
the new theater grounds. Now it
has quite a value, and souvenir
hunting tourists have offered the
student guides as much as $10 for
a small piece. If the souveni
hunters increase en masse, the
"gold" in "that there" field may
be worth something, after all.
