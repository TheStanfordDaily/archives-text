# Pipe Smoke Invades Lagunita, Roble, Row
## 
### Dave Leff 
No longer may the Stanford ruff I
puff contentedly away .it his old !
corncob without feeling that blue !
columns of briar and meerschaum
smoke are clouding the feminine j
atmospheres ol Roble, Lagunita, and '
the Row, for that last sacred barrier j
of masculinity— pipe-smoking has!
fallen before the onslaught of the
female of (he species.
Pipes in Demand
"It started about a year ago," said
Lester Gunther of the Union candy
counter, when over two dozen girls
bought pipes and tobacco within a
short spare of time." Today, though
the custom is not so large as at the i
outset of the craze, there is still a ;
definite demand on the part of the j
fluffs for 'baccy.
As for cigarettes, of which an esti
mated 308,000 are sold monthly, \
more youngest-generation students 1
pound the weeds than staid, grey
beard profs, who, it seems, greatly

| relish all sorts of candy-bars, as is
evidenced by their buying more
sweets than their students.
Co-eds liny Ciuin
On the other hand, the irrepres
| sibly jawed co-eds purchases by far
I the most gum, while the professors
; come last in this respect. (It would
probably get stuck in their beards.)
Next time you are on the quad,
don't be surprised at seeing a fair
young thing with a stogy stuck in
her face: whereas they don't com
prise the greatei part of the custom,
the gals go in for cigars- the big
gest and blackest.
Fancy C'igs nought
When a pi of feels that he must
smoke, he buys the fanciest eig-
I arettes on the counter, the longest,
| wickedest cigars, and the most high
i brow tobacco mixtures. The call for
chawing tobocca is slight, and comes
almost entirely from the athletes,
who doubtless think it's spinach.
| When the luff wishes to lubricate
j his interior, he orders a one-o-one
(chocolate milk shake), while his
weaker sister asks for cherry coke
—after 40 minutes of making up her
mind.
