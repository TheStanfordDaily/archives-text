### 
LONDON, Feb. Ifj (/P).—Both the
| German and Italian governments
! professed themselves pleased today
I at a report that a film based on Sin
clair Lewis' book, "It Can't Happen
| Here," had been banned by Will
I Hays in fear of "international com-
I plications."
A spokesman for the German Film
| Chamber in Berlin called Lewis a
"full - blooded communist" and said
: the United States avoided a protest
I from Berlin by the ban.
"I never heard of (he book," the
I Nazi official added, "but Lewis is a
• communist. If the film had contained
j any slurs on National Socialism we
j would have protested immediately,
i It is very friendly of America to
I halt such a film."
