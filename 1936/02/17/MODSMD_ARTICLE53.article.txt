## BERKELEY'S JONAH GYM; CARDS STILL ON TOP 
### 
They ought to name that Ban
croft Way pavilion in Berkeley the
Jonah Gymâ€” at least, every time a
Stanford team plays there. For by
some hoodoo bewitchment Stanford
basketball teams can't win games in
it.
Maybe it's the baskets, or the
lighting, or the band, or the raucous
cheering, or whatnot, but again Fri
day night John Bunn's quintuplets
were cold, shots rolled oft rim, and
Cal was hot to win.
After the blue 'n' Goldies got
ahead, the Cards began to play a
man-to-man defense, a system that
was okeh by the Bear forwards, who
: nuck around and got clear for
i hild's play shots. And when they
took shots they made them, a very
high percentage.
Now Stanford and S.C. are tied
for the conference lead, with Cal
a game behind. Stanford still fig
ures on winning this division.
In the opinion of the players
themselves, the easiest conference
games to win are those against
Troy, the team that was supposed
to he untouchable last December.
So next week-end the team goes
south and, confident, not overcon
fident, of copping two from the
Barry five. S.C. likes to break
slow, working the ball in for a
set-up, and consequently their
play does not thrive against the
fast, rushing Card tactics.
