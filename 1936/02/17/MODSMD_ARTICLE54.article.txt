# ABOUT THE INDOOR TRACK FESTIVAL
## 
### 
There was no room to run this
Friday, but bouquets are due sev
eral Cardinal athletes for significant
performances in the First Indoor
Track Meet Wednesday night. Jack
Weiershauser, the best 300-yard man
in the race, running outside on all
lour turns ... Ed Burrows flying
home in a fast indoor mile ahead of
Chuck Nimmo, who tired himself on
h too-fast first lap . . . Norm Bright,
who would have taken the champs
Manning and Lochner in 30 more
yards . . . Roy Kirkpatrick, lightning
fast, and Klopstock beating Moore
of Cal in the heat . . . Ray Dean, a
.scant elbow astern the tiny Mushy
Pollock in the 50 . . . Bill McCurdy
kicking through in his old prep
championship form to get second in
the GOO ... A fast set of frosh sprint
relay men . . . And there was Ben
Eastman and Don Liebendorfer of
ficiating in tails . . . the track itself
fooled all of the local boys, with
sharp turns and no spring on the
footing—you had to know how to
win one of those races.
THERE WILL BE NO TRACK
CAPTAIN this year, at least until
the end of the season: that from
Coaches Templeton and Ellington.
It's not superstition, but just a grow
ing concensus that the track captain
is not going through the season with
flying colors.
'REGARDLESS OF WHAT BRICK
MORSE had to say in his colyum
yesterday, Otio Beringer, the beefy
shot-putter from St. Helena, is not
in school and therefore is not one of
the men to be counted upon to bol
ster the Templeton track team this
year. The roly-poly blond surely
was a prep star, Mr. Morse, and was
a good frosh weight man, but his
name does not grace the Bawlout and
he's not a member of the present
track team. —Breed
