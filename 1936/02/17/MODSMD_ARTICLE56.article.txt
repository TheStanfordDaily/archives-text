## Six First Places Give Oregon Victory Despite Lack Of Second and Third Choices 
### 
j Captain Jim Hurd, winning the 50,
100, and 220, led his Oregon cham-
I pionship swimming team to a 45-39
i win over Stanford Friday afternoon
' in the Enema pools. Literally giving
Stanford both relay events, the Web
i feet took firsts in every other race.
Decisions Close
But the Indians were just as good
as the close score indicates, showing
they will be right in there tomor
j row and Wednesday when the A.A.U.
j holds its Pacific Association Cham
j pionships at the Fairmont Plunge in
j San Francisco. Most of Stanford's
defeats were close decisions and
j they were generally followed for an
j Indian third.
The day's most exciting race was
the 150-yard back-stroke, with Bob
; Walker of Stanford making an amaz
j ing turn and sprint on the last lap
to miss a first place over Jim Reed
by the width of a ripple.
Boothe Wins Diving
Scatena swam a sensational race
for Stanford in the 50 to come in
just four-tenths of a second behind
Hurd.

formance from the board to defeat
two of the Webfeet. Clarke Thomson
and Bob Chilton.
