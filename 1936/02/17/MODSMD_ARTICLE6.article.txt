### 
GARMISCH - PARTENKIRCIIEN.
Germany, Feb. 16 (/P). â€”'Two persons
were hurt, several fainted, and a
number were bruised and scratched
today in a milling crowd which the
Nazi Labor Service Corps kept in
the Olympic ski stadium for more
than two hours until Reiehsfuehrer
Hitler and other high officials de
parted.
A crowd of 130,000 persons shoved
and screamed in attempting either
to see the German leaders or to
get out.
Nazis in uniform kept the crowd
in the seats or narrow passageways,
locking their arms in solid pha
lanxes. Frequently they started a
concerted push inwaid against the
throng, many of whom were stand
ing ankle deep in mud.
Streets were guarded by Black
shirts during Hitler's arrival and
departure.
