# Varsity Nine Guns For St. Mary's
## 
### 
With only one game scheduled for
this week, the varsity nine will con
centrate upon batting and fielding
practice in preparation for the con
ference opener against St. Mary's
February 26. Sunnyvale Air Base
will furnish the opposition in a prac
tice game Thursday.
The Indians were to have started
the conference season against Santa
Clara last Saturday, but rain pre
vented the game, and it has been
postponed until an April date.
