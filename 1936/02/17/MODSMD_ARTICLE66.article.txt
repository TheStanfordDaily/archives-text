The Library is a line, old Stanford tradition,
and one that has not yet outlived its useful
ness, apparently.

There are eertain things, though, that might
assist llie Library in tarrying on its mission
of spreading the lamp of learning to the Stan
ford masses.
One thing is to point out to the steam heal
ing department that (juiet is requested in the
Library. At present, the radiators have not
been able to deeide whether their prime fune
lion is to make music or heal.
The home-lown plumber points out that
knocking in the radiators is the result of sev
eral definite factors, all of which may be re
moved.
The other, is to make a readjustment of
library hours. At present, the Library keeps
the lamps lit on Friday night for the benefit
of L> to 2f) scholars.
Friday night is party night at Stanford.

And it is inevitable that it be so. It would
be impossible to change it. Even if the Library
had Bank Night on Friday night, it would not
draw a bigger gate.
However, Sunday night is a night of frus
tration at Stanford. No one cares for parties,
except for the few smoothies who burnish the
apple at Sunday night suppers; and the Li
brary is closed.
Students who are apprehensive of the im
pending week's classes cannot study in the
bedlam of their rooms, and students who do
not want to study don't wish to g<> out because
they've spent their money Friday night, when
they should have been at the Library.
The Library might do a real service to
learning if it would consider changing the
hours—at least for a few weeks as an experi
ment. It might raise class averages a little,
hut Stanford can afford to Hunk out a few
more idlers, now that it has brought in more
women to make 'em idler.
