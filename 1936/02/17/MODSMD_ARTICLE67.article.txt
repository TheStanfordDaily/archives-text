# If They Would Open Up When It's Timely
## 
### 
Several hundred alumni, assembled on the
Farm and at other points up and down the
coast this last week-end, heard the best in
Stanford professorial talent explain and in
terpret over a dozen of the most pertinent
national and international topics. The occa
sion was the fourth annual Stanford alumni
conference.
Students wern't invited to the speech ses
sions or discussions. If they had attended,
however, they might have been surprised at
their teachers' knowledge of what is going on
in this country and abroad. Most of the pro
fessor-speakers really opened up and told the
visiting citizens just how things stood on such
questions as "Social Security," "Reciprocal
Trade Agreements," and the "National Labor
Relations Act."
Complaints that Stanford professors don't
give their students the benefit of their analy
ses of current affairs are often heard. These
alumni conferences clearly prove that the
1 acuity has enough on the ball to explain cur
rent affairs in class rooms if they wanted to.
The question is: Why don't they?
If, in some of these textbook courses, theory
and past history could be forgotten once a
week, and the political science and economics
of the day could be remembered in an assem
bly hall lecture, a student might be convinced
that he is learning something useful in col
lege.
