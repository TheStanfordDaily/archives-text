The traditional moan lor "freedom of the
press" was turned into an argument lor the
modern will ol the wisp, academic freedom,
when Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, U.C. presi
dent. addressed a Berkeley meeting oi North
ern California Newspaper Editors last week.
Dr. Sproul said :
The freedom of the press is almost as dear to
us as il is to you, tor academic freedom is its
blood kin.
Censorship ol the press or professors should
be equally unthinkable in the United States. In
man\ countries, today, there seems to be a desire
to cut human nature to predetermined shapes and

to dictate the designs in which it shall be sewed
together.
Of course, Dr. Spoul's argument is right.
And his talk makes excellent reading. Rut he
probably had no illusions that he was appeal
ing to attentive ears.
Newspaper editors are very interesting
people, hut there is nothing in their profession
that makes them intellectually less bigoted
than their audiences. It is from I lie press, and
not only from the press of that great buffoon
Hearst, that academic freedom has suffered
and will suffer its greatest threat.
The newspapers in their light for freedom
campaigned for the free exchange of ideas.
The reason for their present intolerance is
that many of the papers have sold out and
gone over to the other side. Many present
day newspapers would not know what to do
with the free exchange of ideas if they had it.
