If I am to believe what appears in the campus
opinion column this morning, Los Angeles has streets
that travel 40 miles in both directions. They are spread
out like a fan, they expand and contract with the heat
and cold, they start out nowhere and end in Los
Angeles, which is no improvement at all. The streets
come in two colors: white and black. If you want
peppermint streets, though, you must join the Town
send Club, which will throw in a gold brick for good
measure.
There once was a man who came to Los Angeles
by the name of Wilshire, who sold radium jugs and
electronic belts. These two medical devices cured mil
lions of people, particularly widows and orphans, of
every disease known to man, including money, which
rooted for dear old evil. So they named their big
gest and best street after Wilshire. And it spread in
both directions. And it was white and black.
But one street was not enough, and Los Angeles
grew and grew. Pretty soon some smart real estate
people started a subdivision way out in the sticks.
And they were losing money, so they started a col
lege, which was named U.C.L.A. and which spread in
both directions. Pretty soon the real estate people
were not losing money, which is fine.
Salinas, on the other hand, is not a fine town. The
people arc not proud of their streets, or their garbage
dump, which I hear is one of the finest in California,
and which attracts millions of vagrants annually. The'
weather is terrible in Salinas. It is probably raining
there right now.
It is true that the people in Salinas have a rodeo
once a year. It is a fair rodeo as rodeos go, yet it is
certainly not a very good cultural influence on the
people, as are streets that are white and black and
extend for 40 miles in each direction. The people are
not proud of it, but they are glad that it is a rodeo
instead of U.C.L.A., or U.S.C.
Salinas is a small town. And it realizes that it has
nothing, absolutely nothing to be proud of, except
that it is not Los Angeles.
As for Podunk, Utah, I am afraid Mr. Jack'nbob
is beclouding and befuddling Ihe issue. After a
thorough perusal of my atlas I find that there is no
such town in Utah. Utah is to be congratulated, I
suppose. California is not so fortunate. We have a
Podunk, but we call it by a different name, which is
longer and harder to write, but it looks better in
advertisements.
