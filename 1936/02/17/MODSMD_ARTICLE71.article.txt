## The
						Dean Resigns 
### 
(From the University of Washington Daily)
Another boy is going up to the major league.
Harold Shepherd will quit in June as dean of the
law school to become a professor at the University of
Cincinnati. Cincinnati is a piddling school that never
has sent a football team to the Rose Bowl or won a
rowing title at Poughkeepsie. Last year another out
standing scholar, Professor Donald G. Barnes of the
history department, left to accept a better-paid posi
tion at Western Reserve University. There the foot
ball team also takes terrific beatings and no one ever
has dreamed of sending their basketball team to
Berlin.
It seems that schools like Cincinnati and Western
Reserve don't consider such things very important.
Instead of spending large sums of money on athletic
plants, beautiful Gothic buildings, and 10,000 registra
tion blanks a quarter, they invest in intelligence.
They want only brilliant men on their faculties, and
they are willing to pay for them. That is why Dr.
Shepherd will receive much more salary as professor
at Cincinnati than he does as a dean at Washington.

Long ago The Powers at Cincinnati and Western
Reserve learned that a college's worth depends not
upon the number of students it enrolls, but upon the
men who instruct them. And The Powers realize that
every noted teacher they hire increases the school's
prestige and makes a position on its faculty more de
sirable to other good men. An atmosphere of schol
arship not only breeds scholars, but attracts them.
This philosophy has not yet penetrated Olympia.
As a result the University of Washington is becom
ing just another club in the educational bush league.
This school serves as a "farm" for young would-be
educators. If they develop into brilliant professors, they
usually go up to the majors where pay is higher and
positions more secure. If they prove to be permanent
bush-leaguers ,they remain . . . indefinitely.

June probably will not be a wholly happy month
for Harold Shepherd. He lov2s the University of
Washington, whose law school lie has raised from me
diocrity to prominence.
And the University will be sorry to see him go. It
can not afford to lose more like him.
