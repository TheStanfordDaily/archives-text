THE DOCTOR'S DOLLARS
AND SENSE
It Roes without saying that those
on the administrating end of mus
tard plasters and pills are the men
and the women who know how to
run Stanford's get-well machine.
But the merest of patients who
has gone through the medical mill

during the past
two weeks is jus
tified in observing
that an epidemic
of a minor illness,
such as the pres
ent flu scourge,
raises a suspicious
amount of hell
and disorganiza
tion at the Paly
Hospital.

Conditions there, we hasten to say,
are obviously not the result of in
efficiency, but simply that the hos
pital organization is not set up for
the kind of use Stanford students
perenially give it.

You can take that from a ranking
physician who let down his hair to
this writer. Because he is a doctor
who earns his bread with his serv
ices, he has reduced this business of
illness and wellness to tangible ex
pressions of dollars and cents.
He points to the fact that Stan
ford's medical provisions are for the
extremes of sickness. On one hand
are the rest homes, equipped fur
resting, not getting well; on the
other is the hospital, equipped for

getting well, but not for resting. At
one end of the scale we have a place
that must, by its very nature, largely
serve what he termed "pulse hold
ers," those so slightly sick they are
almost well but don't know it; at the
other we have a place equipped for
the treatment of the seriously ill.
The doctor's point is that Stanford
has no place where the mildly ill,
such as the flu victim, can get care
exactly commensurate with the se
verity of his affliction.

At the hospital, the flu-stricken
Stanfordite is actually, but indi
rectly, paying an amount dispro
portionate to the care he really
needs, is be int.; charged for services
which he doesn't get and doesn't
require. He should not be occupy
ing expensive rooms and getting ex
pensive care; rather, he should be in
a regular infirmary, where old Doc
Nature and the appropriate amount
of human help would combine in the
right proportions to effect a com
plete and economical recovery.
# * *
The hospital, suggests this anony
mous M.D., should be reserved for
what it is meant to handle, severe
cases. The rest home might well be
replaced with an infirmary, where
mildly but definitely sick patients
could get care at reasonable dollar
for-dollar cost. He brands the pres
ent medical set-up as wasteful.
The waste, he points out, is being
paid for—by the students.
