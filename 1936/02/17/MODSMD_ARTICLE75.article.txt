# L.A. vs. SALINAS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We wish to congratulate your
Hasher on his argumentative pow
ers. We bring up a comparison, or
we should say contrast, between
Los Angeles and San Francisco, and
what does he do, but start bringing
up some berg that forms the out
skirts of a rodeo stadium, if that pile
of broken-down bleachers out there
in the middle of the sage brush can
be called a stadium. We believe he
said the name was Salinas or some
such thing. Personally, we prefer
Podunk, Utah.

P.S. While the Los Angeles "tor
nado," as the San Francisco papers
put it, was going on, the slight
"wind storm in the Bay Region"
scored almost a dozen fatalities.
Some fun, eh, Hasher!
