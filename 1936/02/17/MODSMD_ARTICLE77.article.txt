j The Editor, Sir:
Is it not true that Stanford stands j
I for Democracy? Do we not have ,
what is known as the Honor Code? J
i I have been told so but I'll be darned
if I can see proof of it.
I know of a case where the person t
concerned was accused of doing ;
something wrong. When the person
was called on the carpet, he was j
} given no chance to prove the point, i
j The victim went through a regular j
third degree such as an ordinary !
thug might go through. No person
should be subjected to such treat- j
ment at a place like Stanford.
When a respectable college won't (
take the word of an equally re- j
spectable student, and actually de- j
I fames the character of said student, j
i I think something should be done.
This person is serving the hard
-1 est penalty that has ever been in-
I flicted on a Stanford student other
j than being thrown out.
I Stanford democracy .. . Bah!
