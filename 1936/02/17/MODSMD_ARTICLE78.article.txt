# WANTS SOB COLUMN

The Editor, Six"
The battle between the sexes has
been raging for some weeks now . . .
My suggestion to alleviate the con
dition—to act as sort of a "buffer
state" would be a sob column to
which the love-lorn could write
and "ind aid for their aching souls.
We might get the "understanding"
Susan to play Aunt Bella. Or may
be the hard-working-law-student
—but perhaps he's a bit too sar
castic—and then maybe the editor
couldn't get ahold of him, although
we do understand that Susan is
known to at least some.
Here's to a sob column!
Sincerely yours,
Cupid
