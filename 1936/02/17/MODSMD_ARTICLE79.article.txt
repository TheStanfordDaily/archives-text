(A Movie Review)
Seeking to cash in on their sue- j
cesses last season in "David Cop- i
perfield "and "The Informer," pro- !
ducers have starred Freddie Bar-

tholomew and Victor j
McLaglan in "PRO
FESSIONAL SOL
DIER," now the Var- '
sity Theater's major
attraction.
Freddie, smooth- j

tongued, precocious little Britisher, i
reigns as boy-king of a mythical !
Balkan kingdom. His councillors are
meanies, though, and want to run
the country themselves. Old friends
of Freddie's late dad figure that if
Freddie is kidnapped, the people'll ;
blaim it on the councillors, and an
grily oust them. That's where Vic
comes in. He's a tough American ;
soldier-of-fortune hired to do the j
snatching.
Little Mr. Bartholomew is given |
sufficient chance to amuse the au- ;
dience with -.he accent and diction :
for which he's famous. "Gruff but [
loveable" Mr. McLaglan is oyer-1
dramatic, but rather effective. Still !
a so-so picture.
With a cast including Dolores del I
Rio, Warren William, Louise Fa- ;
zenda, Colin Clive, and Warren;
Hymer, "WIDOW OF MONTE
CARLO" should be quite some little j
movie. Fact is, the picture is quite
below average. Warren Hymer, as
a dopey American crook, is the only
player up to snuff. The rest are
wasted on weak lines and weak'
story. â€”Botsford \
