# Pan-American League Seen
## South American Response Is Favorable; "Good Neighbor" Policy Favored by F. D. R. 
### 
WASHINGTON, Fob. 16 (/P).â€”Vi
sions of a Pan-American League of
Nations, possibly .supplementing or
rivaling the world league at Gevena,
blossomed today out of Ihe call by
President Roosevelt for a confer
once of Amrican republics in Bue
nos Aires at an early date.
To Congressional leaders who
long have advocated strong co
operation between (he United States
and other American nations the con
ference sounded promising.
From South America came a fa
vorable response to the conference,
with the view being expressed that
all Latin-American statesmen would
welcome a broadening of the "good
neighbor" policy earlier pronounced
by President Roosevelt in replace
ment. of a Monroe doctrine policy
interpreted only by the United
States.
Whether those league foes who
have fought any gesture toward
United States alliance with such
groups as the League of Nations
would look with a favoring eye on
the prospect of a Pan-American
league was left largely in doubt.
