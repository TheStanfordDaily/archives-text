tor, are asked by Wally Brooke, A.S. i

Hall Interest Lags
Approximately 50 students have
< spoken to Brooke already, but. he

i cient. A large percentage of those

interest in taking part on the drive j
! are members of sororities, each one
of which seems set upon having as |
many representatives as possible.
Brooke stressed the fact that HalT
I interest has been lax, and he asked
that more hall residents go to sec \
j him. |

whose members would be chosen
from this list were: the Off-Campus i
