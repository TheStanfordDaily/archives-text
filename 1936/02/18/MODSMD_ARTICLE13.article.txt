# River Movie Shown Tonight
## Historical Cinema To Replace Regular Tuesday Lecture; Questions Will Be Answered 
### 
"Our Inland Waterways," a mov
ing picture, will be shown tonight
instead of the regular Tuesday eve
ning lecture, at 7:30 in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall. The picture
was produced and shown at the
World's Fair by the Inland Water
ways Corporation.
History Depicted
The film traces the development
of water transportation in the Mis
sissippi Valley for the past 100 years,
starting with the days of the flat
boats and keel boats to the present
tunnel-type tow boats and steel
barges.
It shows the development of river
and rail terminals by the different
cities throughout, the Mississippi
Valley, the different types now in
use, and the final co-ordination of
truck-rail-barge-ocean transporta
tion.
Independent Organization
The Inland Waterways Corpora
tion, which produced the picture, is
an independent agency created by
Act of Congress in 1924 to deter
mine the entire future waterway
policy of the United States. It is
independent of annual appropria
tions from Congress and is entirely
self-sustaining through funds de
rived from operations.
A representative of the Inland
Waterways Corporation will be
present at the showing to answer
any questions the audience may like
to ask.
