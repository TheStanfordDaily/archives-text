# Library Acts On Editorial Suggestion
## 
### 
The Library will throw open its
rloors lo students the last two
Sunday nights before winter quar
ter examinations, Nathan Van
Patten, director of University lib
raries, said last night.
Acting upon The Daily's editor
ial suggestion yesterday, Mr. Van
Patten agreed to experiment with
the Sunday night plan. "Expense
was all that stood in the way," he
explained.
To open the Library Sunday
nights would cost an extra $30
a week, "funds which arc not av
ailable." Faculty members and
research students working in pri
vate studies, however, make it
necessary for the Library to re
main open Friday nights, he said.
