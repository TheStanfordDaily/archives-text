# TVA Disposal Of Power Sustained By High Tribunal
## Supreme Court Not Effective Check on New Deal, Says Political Science Professor 
### 
"The Supreme Court has again
c led the real question and is con
nuently not turning out to be a
very effective check on the New
Deal," James A. C. Grant, acting as
sistant professor of political science,
told The Daily last right when
questioned concerning the court's
upholding the Roosevelt Adminis
tration's Tennessee Valley Author
ity.
Disregarded Facts
"As in the case of the Boulder
Dam and the Federal Narcotics Law,
the court has disregarded what
everyone knows, and judged the
TV A case on .Is constitutionality as
a navigation rather than as a power
program," he said.
"When the justices declared the
code-making statutes of 'the NRA
unconstitutional last May," Professor
Grant continued, "they were killing
something that was already dead.
New Deal Not Damaged
"The New Deal, moreover, was
not damaged considerably by the
AAA decision. Congress can very
easily get along without processing
taxes by shifting the burden to the
government's general fund."
It is not likely that, the TVA will
face the Supreme Court again soon.
No other cases against it are pend
ing, he said.
"The only other New Deal pro
gram to be considered by the Court
in the near future," Grant said, "is
the slum clearing activity." That, too,
will probably be upheld because the
Court has regarded Congress' spend
ing power broadly in the past.
"But the justices have refused
actually to discuss the spending
power, so we don't know," he con
cluded.
