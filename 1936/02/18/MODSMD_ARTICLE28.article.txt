WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (/!>). —
Government sale of electricity gen
erated at dams constructed for na
tional defense or other constitutional
purposes wtu-i upheld today by the
Supreme Court in its long-awaited
TV A decision ny an 8 to 1 vote.
Chief Justice Hughes, in an opin
ion from which Justice Mcßeynolds
alone dissented, ruled in addition
that the government could take steps
to provide a market for such "sur
plus power."
But whilj the court thus placed its
approval on the Tennessee Valley
authority's acquisition of transmis
sion lines owned by the Alabama
Power Company leading from Wil
son Dam on the historic site of
Muscle Shoals, Hughes warned:
"We 1 imit our decision to the case
before us, ris we have defined it."
Despite the limitation, New Deal
ers were quick to contend that the
7,000-word opinion laid down a
broad gauge of policy measuring
other 'I VA dams, and similar proj
ects throughout the country.
The Supreme Court held that
general purposes of the Tennes
see Valley Authority present no
"justiciable question."
After ruling that the construc
tion of the Wilson Dam as an act
of national defense and for the
improvement of navigation was
legal, the court held that there was
no constitutional prohibition against
the manner in which the Tennessee
Valley authority was disposing of
the electricity generated there.
