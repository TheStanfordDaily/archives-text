IT ¥ is Constitutional, after all. The
Supreme Court, in ruling that the
government can dispose of power
developed by plants erected on navi
gation-improvement projects or
those aiding the national defense, has
refuted the prediction of more than
one columnist.
"THE PROPERTY is government
owned and there is nothing in the
Constitution to limit the govern
ment's disposition of power," Chief
Justice Hughes said. The Federal
Government, in view of its constitu
tional powers over navigation, is
evidently free to do what it wishes
with a navigable stream.
ONE THING is true. No one can
predict what the court will do. And
the biggest lui prise was that eight
o<' the nine old gentlemen were in
complete agreement.
The reason for the 8-1 decision is
that the justices believed the general
purpose of the TVA not to be a "jus
ticiable question," but a matter for
Congress to decide, not for the
courts.
WHAT SEEMED an obvious en
croachment on private enterprise on
the part of the government was prac
tically snubbed by the court, two
justices being perfectly willing to
dismiss the case from the very be
ginning.
BUT LEGISLATION like the
AAA, which was no more than a
subsidy like those given to airlines
and steamship lines by the govern
ment to carry the mail, is declared
unconstitutional on the ground of
discriminating against one group to
benefit another.
MAIL SUBSIDIES more than
cover the cost of transporting the
postal matter, they make American
shipping on the high seas and Amer
ican aviation possible. What semb
lance America has of a merchant
marine is made possible by subsidy.
The heavily subsidized British
Merchant Marine would chase
American boats off the sea, Amer
ican aviation would be still unde
veloped if it were not for mail sub
sidies.
AAA WAS, in reality, just a tax
on the middle-man, who has always
made the greatest profits—the man
ufacturer. The money collected by
that tax is returned to the farmer,
who has never made much profit
anyhow, for not having produced too
much—A SUBSIDY.
