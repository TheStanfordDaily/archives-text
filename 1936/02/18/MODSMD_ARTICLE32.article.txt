FEDERAL BUSINESS enterprise
in competition with private activity
is not. A measure benefiting the
farmer to such an extent that he is

of Rugged Individualism is found to
be cohstitutional.

mailing their AAA checks from the
Tennessee Valley. Then everything
would be okay.
Ah, well . . . the irony of it all!
