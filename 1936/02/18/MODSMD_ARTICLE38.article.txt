# 'Doodles' Gets 'Axe-ey ay' In Menlo Pinch
## 
### 
When a blurred object shot
through Menlo streets late last
Saturday night, twisting, circl
ing, sweeping up gravel, anil rais
ing a high fog of dust, Officer
Kearny wondered if it might he
the human incarnation of a can
non-hall. After the object had
circled the block several times,
Kearny pulled down his cap and
gave chase.
Thirty barrel rolls later, the
officer cornered his game against
the Menlo Park gravel yard, and
from it emerged Winstead "Dood
les'' Weaver, entertainer extraor
dinary and author of "Give 'em
The Axe-ey Ay!"
Weaver will get his hearing on
a reckless driving charge Febru
ary 19.
