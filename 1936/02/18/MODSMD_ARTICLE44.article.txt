# Quad Sketches To Be Shown
## Final Judging Will Take Place In March, Seven Drawings To Be Chosen for Section 
### 
Sketches (<):" the Quad Art contest
will be exhibited in the Art Gallery
starting Feb. 20, and the final judg
ing will take place in March.
Seven of the drawings submitted
will be chosen for the opening view
section of the 1936 Quad, and the
winners will receive free Quads.
The contest was started with the
idea of making the 1936 Quad a truly
"student book", besides proving the
contention that Stanford art stud
ents can equal commercial artists
in creative ability and skill of de
sign.
Done in charcoal, and reproduced
by lithography in black and white,
this student r.rt work is expected
to add greatly to the book.
Among those submitting designs
are Peter Kuinp, Roger Piercy, Dick
Spencer, Gilman Gist, Dick Dawson,
Robin Lindsey, Morse Drew, and
Jack Leslie.
