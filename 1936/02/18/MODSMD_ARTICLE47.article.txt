# Varsity Will Meet U.S.F. Tomorrow
## Lewis, Sensational Don Forward, Rivals Hank Luisetti In Piling Up Scoring Average 
### Roger Kimball 
An old and dangerous rival, the
University >f San Francisco Dons
will invade the Pavilion at 8 o'clock
tomorrow night, intent on scoring
another victory over John Dunn's
varsity basketball team.
The city team, which has always
given Stanford trouble, is again one
of Ihe best in the Day region. Their
most recent conquest was a 37-25
decision over Santa Clara, who lost
to the Indians, 4G to 23.
Dons To Tes( Indians
Little Ed Lewis, a forward, is the
U.S.F. sensation. Lewis has 'com
piled a scoring average comparable
with Hank Luisetti's this season.
Decker is the oilier forward, Martin
ihe center, and Garcia and Mc-
Carthy the guards.
If the Dons don't upset the Indians,
they will at least prime them for
two games with U.S.C. in Los An
geles. Stanford must come a long
way from her last showing at Der
keley to have a good chance against
the Trojans Friday and Saturday
nights.
Since a two-day rest for the team
didn't work last week, Dunn is giv
ing the boys plenty of exercise this
week. Two teams took the floor yes
terday in a stiff practice session.
Regulars Will Start
One, t'.e regulars who will prob
ably all start tomorrow night, con
sisted of Hank Luisetti and Howell
Turner at forwards; Art Stoefen at
center; and Dob Zortne and Jack
Calderwood at guards. The other
included Captain Dinty Moore, Dill
Quade, Ken Nobs, Nellie Heath, and
Sparky Robertson at the respective
positions.
Alternating between these two
teams, Dunn stood about 25 feet out
and fired high, arching shots. The
rebounds were seized by the guards
and'fed down the floor in a criss
cross passing attack. The boys looked
only fair in this workout, but may
get back in their stride in time for
the Dons.
