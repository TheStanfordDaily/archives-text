# Bruin Editor, Prexy Continue Bickering
## 
### Johnson Hill 
A crisis in the relationship be- |
tween student press and student
government on the U.C.L.A. campus
looms in the controversy raging be- j
tween the editor of The Daily Bruin
and the student body president, ac- j
cording to letters received by Stan- j
ford activities officials.
Charging that The Daily Bruin !
"obstructed, weakened and delayed"
his administration through its
icy of neglecting campus news for
international and extraneous mat- ;
ter," President Tom Lambert, j
resigned from his position as a pro- j
test, only to have his resignation !
refused by council, three times
in as many weeks.
Resignations Refused
On each occasion the resignation j
was refused by the Executive Coun- |
cil. At present, it is reported, a by- !
laws committee is drafting provi- ■
sions which will attempt to clarify
the relative positions of the news- j
paper and the Council.
Regarding Lambert's accusation,
Gil Harrison, editor of The Bruin,
declared in a letter to The Stanford :
Daily:
"The Daily Bruin has not once I
raised objection to any move, any
policy, any proposal that has been
advanced by Lambert. This is prob

ably the first time since I entered
the University that the newspaper
has supported every activity of the
student body president. Both edi
torially and on the front page, we
have tried to support his programs."
Values Publicity
In furthering his argument, Lam
bert said: "Shut off publicity from
CPTipus doings, the pillars cave in,
ana tin; bottom of prexy's program
falls out."
: he official explained that in view
of this assertion, he had asked the
Council to formulate a series of
general rules which would constitute
a standard to be followed by The
Daily Bruin. The Council refused
to support the measure, regarded
by Lambert as "necessary for the
good of the Associated Students."
Forces Explanation
"I accept their sincerity in differ
ing with me," he said, "but I am at a
loss to explain it." He then offered
his resignation, a move alleged to
force the newspaper to ask for an
explanation, "j nd thus put the whole
question before the student body."
"The appointment of the by-laws
committee," Editor Harrison con
tinued, "was a good move and I, of
course, voted for it. The Council, in
approving the investigation of this
matter by the committee, made it
perfectly clear, by passing a separate
lesolution, that Lambert's return to
office did not alter the independent
status which The Daily Bruin en
joyed at the time of his resignation.

Editor States Case

"I believe," Harrison stated, "that
The Daily Bruin is a newspaper, and
not simply a publicity sheet or a
house organ for the prevailing po
litical administration. I insist that a
university newspaper has the duty of
creating an atmosphere of intellec
tual interest on the campus."

Lambert's letter was written at the
request of Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U.
president, and Harrison's corre
spondence was the result of ques
tions sent by Millard Browne, editor
of The Daily.

looms in the controversy raging be- j
tween the editor of The Daily Bruin
and the student body president, ac- j
cording to letters received by Stan- j
ford activities officials.
Charging that The Daily Bruin !
"obstructed, weakened and delayed"
his administration through its
icy of neglecting campus news for
international and extraneous mat- ;
ter," President Tom Lambert, j
resigned from his position as a pro- j
test, only to have his resignation !
refused by council, three times
in as many weeks.
Resignations Refused
On each occasion the resignation j
was refused by the Executive Coun- |
cil. At present, it is reported, a by- !
laws committee is drafting provi- ■
sions which will attempt to clarify
the relative positions of the news- j
paper and the Council.
Regarding Lambert's accusation,
Gil Harrison, editor of The Bruin,
declared in a letter to The Stanford :
Daily:
"The Daily Bruin has not once I
raised objection to any move, any
policy, any proposal that has been
advanced by Lambert. This is prob

ably the first time since I entered
the University that the newspaper
has supported every activity of the
student body president. Both edi
torially and on the front page, we
have tried to support his programs."
Values Publicity
In furthering his argument, Lam
bert said: "Shut off publicity from
CPTipus doings, the pillars cave in,
ana tin; bottom of prexy's program
falls out."
: he official explained that in view
of this assertion, he had asked the
Council to formulate a series of
general rules which would constitute
a standard to be followed by The
Daily Bruin. The Council refused
to support the measure, regarded
by Lambert as "necessary for the
good of the Associated Students."
Forces Explanation
"I accept their sincerity in differ
ing with me," he said, "but I am at a
loss to explain it." He then offered
his resignation, a move alleged to
force the newspaper to ask for an
explanation, "j nd thus put the whole
question before the student body."
"The appointment of the by-laws
committee," Editor Harrison con
tinued, "was a good move and I, of
course, voted for it. The Council, in
approving the investigation of this
matter by the committee, made it
perfectly clear, by passing a separate
lesolution, that Lambert's return to
office did not alter the independent
status which The Daily Bruin en
joyed at the time of his resignation.

Editor States Case

"I believe," Harrison stated, "that
The Daily Bruin is a newspaper, and
not simply a publicity sheet or a
house organ for the prevailing po
litical administration. I insist that a
university newspaper has the duty of
creating an atmosphere of intellec
tual interest on the campus."

Lambert's letter was written at the
request of Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U.
president, and Harrison's corre
spondence was the result of ques
tions sent by Millard Browne, editor
of The Daily.
