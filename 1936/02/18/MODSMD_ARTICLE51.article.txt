## McCURDY TO EMBARK ON FAST SEASON 
### 
The subject of our story this
morning is Bill McCurdy.
Bill went to Tamalpais High over
in Marin County, and was a very
fast half-miler there. In fact, he was
so good he won the half-mile in the
North Coast meet in 1933. His time
was 1.58.
That record still stands on the
N.C.S. books.
Then Bill came here as a frosh,
and neither he nor his partner, Bob
"Ace" Alexander, could slip under
two minutes flat. As a result they
placed two, thiee behind Bob Heavey
in the Little Big Meet.
All last spring, as a sophomore,
Dink worked McCurdy in the
two-mile. And as Hill and eight
straight laps were as much alike
as Salinas and Los, Angeles, no
one could figure out why Dink
kept Bill running two or three
two-miles every week. As a re
sult, Bill's first varsity season was
blah, about as successful as the
drunk trying to light a match on
a wet cake of soap.
But now the question is appearing
more solvent all the time. Bill ran
the GOO in the indoor meet Wednes
day, and came up from behind to nip
team-mate A1 Cranston and almost
take Jim Cassin of Troy.
That kick in the last 50 yards
was almost worth all of last sea
son's disappointment with Bill. It
showed that what Templeton was
trying to do all last spring was to
give him that stamina to run a fast
race and finish with a dash of the
old moxie.
So now it's Bill McCurdy, varsity
half-miler, a tall boy who should
run some fast 880's this spring.
808 FOWLER was in the gallery at
the indoor meet. He looked pretty
healthy all in all, but is planning
to he ready for the S.C. meet at the
earliest.
His heel still can't hold the lean
of his body up from the toes. He
has to split the back edge of his
ieft shoe down about an inch to
get the heel inside—so it's really
a material injury.
One Cal doctor says he has an
Achilles tendon, another swears he
hasn't. At any rate, Fowler watched
with keen interest the race Ed Bur
rows, whom ihe Farm is grooming
to succeed him as the Coast's pre
mier two-miler, ran to beat Charles
Colvin "Chuck" Nimmo in the mile.
