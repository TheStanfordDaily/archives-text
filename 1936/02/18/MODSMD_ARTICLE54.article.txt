### 
"We'll have him in shape to win
the Big Meet quarter it' he wants,"
said Doc Northway, B.A.C. bandage
man, while plastering up Truck
Dellinger, veteran varsity 440-yard
dash man.
Dellinger pulled a thigh muscle
some weeks ago and has been un
able to set foot on a track since.
After running second to A1 Black
man for two years, the bull-chested
guy had hoped for a winning sea
son this year, and was shooting for
at least a tie for Dink Templeton's
1936 number one quarter-miler after
Jack Weiershauser came on the
scene.
But that is lost now—the season
has started, and Truck hasn't de
cided whether to save his last year
of competition or to run the last half
of this season, if things go right.
