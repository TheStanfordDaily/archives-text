## Yearling Baseballers Meet High School Team This Afternoon At 3:30 o'clock on Campus 
### 
Weather permitting, frosh base
ballers will meet Lowell High of San
Francisco this afternoon at 3:30 on
the frosh diamond. Coach Ernie
Nevers' fast-improving team is con
ceded an excellent chance to take
their first win out of three starts.
Nevers indicated yesterday that
either Wally De V/itt or Walt Hege
will start on the mound, and Harry
Cohn or Bill Balkan would catch.
Hege will be at first base if he does
not pitch, with Tony Mecia at sec
ond, Henry Glasser at shortstop,
Verne Maino on third, and Ed Gar
nier, Lloyd Davis, and Charles Hay
ward in the outfield.
The frosh showed good defensive
form in their last start against Oak
land Tech, but inability to hit safe
ly cost them a 5-0 defeat.
