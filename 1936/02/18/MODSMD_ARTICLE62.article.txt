## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" Co-operation Through Criticism Check-and-Balance System Is Valuable; Any College Will Do Well To Keep It 
### 
Controversy rages on the Westwood cam
pus concerning a time-worn hut always perti
nent problem to any student government —the
relation of one to another.
In the U.C.L.A. squabble, Editor (*il Harri
son of the Dnilij If ruin and President Tom
Lamhert of the Associated Students are at
tempting to clarify the position ot the college
newspaper in relation to the Executive Coun
cil, a group corresponding to Stanford's Ex
Committee.
The point involved obviously is one of
check-and-balance among the administrative
student groups.
Each subsidiary organization of the Asso
ciated Students, at Stanford at least, is sub
ject to Ex Committee control.
'I he Student Manager, moreover, lias a veto
power that serves to cheek every student or
ganization on the campus—except Ex Com
mittee.
A set-up similar to this in form, if not in
detail, exists in nearly every university stu
dent body.
To complete the elieek-and-balance system
necessitated by the fact that in some cases
the students in power may not be wholly com
petent, or may not be acting wholly in the
best interests of the student body at large—
there must he,a check on the Executive Com
mittee, or Executive Council.

It is weakly argued that this group is re
sponsible to the University Administration,
and that therein lies the check. Students,
however, cannot alTord to base their govern
ment on this point. If they are to have a
theoretical student government, they must
have all their checks entirely within the stu
dent body.
The most satisfactory check possible on an
otherwise theoretically uncontrolled Execu
tive Committee is the college newspaper—
which gives publicity to tiie committee's pro
grams, publicizes and interprets committee
actions, and generally acts as the mouthpiece
between associated student governors aVid the
associated students themselves. In turn, the
Ex Committee rightfully has its purse-string
control over the campus newspaper.
A suggestion to U.C.L.A., lifted from a Stan
ford set-ui) that is not too cluttered with idle
rules:
Clarify the position of the liruin in relation
to Executive Council if you must, but main
tain your system of checks and balances; as
sume that the student ollicial, whether an
editor or a president, is competent to handle
details of his own otlicc; and let the student
body itself be the final check, with its power
of recalling any ollicial if a flagrant violation
should occur.
