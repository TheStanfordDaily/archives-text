# More Dramatics, Less Debating
## 
### 
When Dramatic Council meets this after
noon, the delicate subject of Dramatic Council
consolidation may he broached.
Several alternatives lie before the Council.
One is to increase the membership by adding
Barnstormers.
Another is to decrease the membership by
taking oil the Daily and Chappie reviewers,
but continue in full strength with a repre
sentative of each of the lour dramatic socie
ties.
A third is to further decrease the member
ship by eliminating the inembcr-at-large, and
by giving Kam's Head and Barnstormers a
half year apiece on the Council.
The latter, because of its compactness,
seems most desirable. A large Dramatic Coun

cil has been a decided hindrance to Stanford
drama in the past. If the present Council sees
lit to reduce the members it can devote more
of its time to choosing plays, which is its chief
function, and leave the oratory and athletics
to Debate Council and the 8.A.C., respectively.
