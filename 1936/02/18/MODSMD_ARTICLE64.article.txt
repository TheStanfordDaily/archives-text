# The
						Kansas Budget-Balancer

(Editor's Note: This is the first article of a series
of sketches of the figures considered in the pre
campaign conjecture as possibilities for their party
presidential nominations. Budget-balancing, a
rare phenomenon in the current era, is Alf Lon
don's claim to political fame; Landon will lead off
the political series.)
Campus tongues wagging on the subject of presi
dential possibilities cannot well afford to pass up the
name of Alfred Mossman Landon, since 1932 governor
of Kansas and now considered in excellent position for
Republican nomination to the United States presidency.
Before July 1 last year, few people outside Kansas
and the Middle West had heard much of "Alf" Landon.
He was, it is true, the lone Republican elected to a
post higher than Representative in the New Deal land
slides of 1032 and 1934, but his opponents were none
too powerful. In 1934 the governor handily defeated
Dr. John R. Brinkley of goat-gland-rejuvenation fame
and swung into his second administration.

But not until last summer did Governor Landon's
name go screaming from coast to coast in newspaper
headlines. He had just announced that the Kansas state
budget was balanced. Republican big chiefs raced to
Topeka to check up on this conscientious little man who
h;id reportedly "done so much for Kansas." Publisher
Hearst, looking for someone to boom against his arch
enemy Roosevelt in November, promptly picked on
Landon, the Kansas Budget-Baianccr.
No old-school Republican, however, is Governor
Landon. Rather is he a "Kansas Progressive." In 1912
he bolted party lines for Teddy Roosevelt and has since
advocated his life-long friend, William Allen White, for
the Kansas governorship.
With all the attention he is getting from Republican
bigwigs and Hearst editorial writers, Kansas' grey
ing. spectacled governor is not spectacular. It was Dr.
Brinkley who first dubbed him "Kansas Coolidge."
Unlike the tight-lipped Yankee "prosperity president,"
however, Alf Landon is smiling, friendly, genially
home-townish. But he, too, is frugal, his personal as
well as governmental watchword being economy.
"Don't spend what you haven't got," is hanging in
his conscience if not in the executive office.

Probably the chief barrier, if any, to his nomination
in Cleveland this summer will be his lack of political
experience. Before 1931 he had little to do with poli
tics the governorship was his first actual taste. Even
now he leaves most of his troubles to J. T. Moore,
powerful state Republican boss.
Kansas, it must be remembered, is almost wholly
an agricultural state. Labor disorders haven't worried
Governor Landon, and he knows little about them.
And without help, he would be little match for the
industrial moguls of the East.
But. the Republican Party will need a standard
bearer who can be sold to the West. The farmers,
before the recent blow to the AAA, had been fed well
by the Roosevelt administration. The East, Repub
lican dope sheet experts figure, is pretty well fed up
will the New Deal anyway. They look to Landon,
therefore, as a shining possibility of winning the West.

The G.O.P. will find their candidate, if he is Landon,
easy to extoll personally. A Methodist, an Odd Fellow,
.» Mason, and an Elk, 48-year-old Alf Landon likes
to hunt and fish, swears only mildly, never drinks
stronger than Coca-Cola. And not until he became
His Excellency, the Governor, could Mrs. Landon and
Peggy Ann persuade him to quit his old, comfortable
clothes and "fix up once in a while." He is truly "one
of the people!"
