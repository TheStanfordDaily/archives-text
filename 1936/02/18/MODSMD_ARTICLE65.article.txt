# Maybe It's Thumbs Up From Here On In

A tax on the middleman to help the farmer
is unconstitutional and must not exist. But
federal enterprise in competition with private
business is perfectly valid. Such were the
results of last month's AAA and yesterday's
TVA Supreme Court decisions.
On the face of things, it appears that the
judicial fathers have tired of turning thumbs
down on the New Deal alphabet and are start
ing a thumbs up motion which should prove
to be an encouraging gesture to the Demo
cratic administration.
