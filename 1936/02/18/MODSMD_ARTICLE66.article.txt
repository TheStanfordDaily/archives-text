The telephone is a great instrument. It makes money
for the telephone company, it rings at all the wrong
hours of the night. It makes money for the telephone
company and sophomores never answer it. And on
top of all this, it is a great instrument.
Particularly do the freshmen think it is a great
instrument. By telephone they can get dates with gals
who don't know what they look like, and also they
can do all sort of clever things that they learned in
high school. The nicest thing shout the business is
that there isn't any honor code attached, and the tele
phone never squeals (that's the neighbor's radio, vou
dope).
There is one particular brain in the wilds of En
cina, who lies awake nights thinking up funny gags to
try over the phone.
His old standby is to call up sorority houses, saying
he is from the Ryan lab and is testing the telephone
line. Then comes the familiar old stall of asking the
person on the other end of 'he line to stand back
and whistle. This goes on for a while. Finally, the dope
says: Thanks, we'll send up the bird seed in the
morning."
His supreme achievement came a few days ago,
when he called up the head sponsor and asked him if
th« light globe in the main hall were burning.
The head sponsor, being an obliging sort of a per
son, ran down and back and reported breathlessly
that it was. Come the voice: "Well climb up and put
it out."
This was all very funny and ingenious, but the
brain is unsatisfied, he is now working on some plan
to deliver cracker crumbs to Encina and Roble beds
by telegraph.
Apropos to the current Daily tryoutee period;
whence cometh all help, it seems that one of the old
played-out copy readers who used to work on the staff
came around, took a look at some of the women try
outees and decided to re-enlist.
