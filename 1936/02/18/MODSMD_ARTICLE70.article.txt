# THE 						FACTS OF LIFE

### 
I The Editor, Sir:
I think your editorial invitation
to students to write letters about ;
things outside: the campus is a good !
! idea . . . Someone needs to tell 1
! Stanford students the facts of life. !
It is often said that students should J
get more out of college than is in '
; the curriculumâ€”that they should
get a social education.
An ex (on this subject) to see if a j
student really knows his way around '
j might include questions like the
j following: Do you have any idea
j what causes unemployment? Do you j
know, beyond a vague idea, what
Fascism, Socialism, Capitalism, !
Communism, Individualism, and An- :
archism are? Is there any relation j
between the last two? Do you think |
that it is true, that the militancy of
the water-front unions is due to a
| sprinkling of ex-college students
| who have been thwarted in their
ambitions and are working on the I
; waterfront to make a living? j
