# YEA, TEAM!

I The Editor, Sir:
I So only a mere handful of sup- '
S porters trek to Cal to see our best
j basketball team in years play that
Cal bunch? So you don't give a
darn? Evidently Stanford has gone
blase in a big way.
Susan's right. Stanford men and
women need an education. It would
mean, socially, a little thoughtful
ness and as regards basketball games,
a return to normal. I mean a natural
pride in the efforts of a topnotch
basketball team and a feeling that
i one ought to show one's apprecia
i tion by backing that team. Is it too
| much to ask? There are plenty of
other week-ends to be spent danc-
I ing in the ciLy.
We've a real oaskctball team and
we will lick U.S.C. next week-end
. and Cal the week after. C'nv.wj,
I you sissies, show that Cal bunch
i you're not ashamed of this team! j
Be at that Cal game Feb. 28 and
â–  we'll win, sure. Susannah Ward
