# Superb Acting Marks Dickens' Masterpiece
## 
### 
David Selznick's production of
Dickens' "TALE OF TWO CITIES"
is a masterpiece in its own right.

Superb acting, ex
cellent direction, and
a judicious choice of
incident, result in a
well integrated film
which may very
probably be chosen

as the picture of the year.
Although the director has very
wisely refrained from playing up
any particular star, Ronald Colman
as "Sidney Carton" and Blanche
Yurka as "Madame LaFarge" are
outstanding. Colman, as the shift
less, likeable, brilliant lawyer, who
was equal to the supreme sacrifice
for those he lcved, reveals himself a
finer actor than his recent pictures
have shown. Blanche Yurka, playing
the vindictive "Madame" who "knits
shrouds," gives an equally excellent
characterization.
The magnificent ending will leave
you, if not in tears, at least speech
less. â€”B. Sweet
