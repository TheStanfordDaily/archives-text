## THIS OUTWORN GRADING SYSTEM 
### 
When a professor looks at his grade |
book at the end of a quarter . . . |
furrows his brow . . . and marks
down a letter or an abbreviated line

from left to right
. . . he is playing
paymaster . . .
doling out wages
to his employes.
But the scream
that hod-carriers
or such have
about, unjust com
pensation is a
moderate bellow
In

compared to wnat
college students should have against
ibis ABCD system.

Grades are the unit of exchange |
in school, just as money is the unit
of exchange outside of school. The
student plugs away at & four-year
course, and the official recognition
given him is a bunch of alphabetical
letters signifying that on certain j
dates he handed in certain exercises
and satisfactorily answered certain
questions. The hod-carrier packs
mortar around for 35 hours a week,
and on Saturday gets $30 in exchange
for his labor. The hod-carrier can
buy things with his 30 stones, but
the student couldn't live on his
grades even if he ate them—but car- j
rying the comparison that far is j
ridiculous.
* * *
What's most important is the fact
that grades us thoy are given now J
not only set up false standards of J
achievement that get the student
hopelessly lost in his search for edu
cation, but also they fail to serve •
their intended purpose. The ordi- J
nary sheep-like student sees a glis
tening "A" crowned by an enticing |
Phi Beta key when he takes a course, j
and flounders toward it gulping up
the diet of soon-to-be-forgotten
facts fed to him by the teacher who j
beckons to him. He may be re- |
warded with the "A," but he'll find '
that a grade of "excellent" signifies |
neither learning, understanding, nor
the ability to correlate the facts nec
essary in his cbosen profession. His
reward is a pen scratch and fleeting
academic honors.

In their method of grading, col- |
leges have run the gauntlet of prog- j
ress and fallen down the other side. !
Plato's circle of friends might have
been the original college. But that i
greatest of teachers certainly didn't ;
think of his pupils in> terms of ex
cellent, good, fair, unsatisfactory — (
but passing, and flunk. In later ;
times students either passed or did- !
n't pass in college. Then came the j
flossy alphabet system.

Grades can be compared to money |
only up to a consideration of effec- J
tiveness. No one would recommend j
a return to the old methods of barter |
in commerce. But many should and
do recommend a return to the "bar
ter" system in education —a return 1

to less examinations and more
leniency in time and scope of study,
less directed reading and research
and more freedom to learn what
you want to learn, and above all less
mandatory requirements and grades
which blind a student to what he is
searching for.
