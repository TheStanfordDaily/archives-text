## 
### 
"In our society, usually all we
can do is to choose which propa-
I ganda to believe. We have no sci
entific answer to the question," Dr.
Chilton R. Bush, executive head of
the journalism division, said last
night in his radio talk over KGO.
Press Is Educator
Speaking on "The Press and Prop
aganda," Dr. Bush said that we tend
'to think of J _he newspaper and radio
; as the exclusive channels for pro pa
i ganda, but we forget the power of
mouth-to-ear communication, and
I other more subtle media.
"However, the newspaper differs
from other channels in that it is
| also an educator," he said. It not
! only influences but it creates atti
| tudes in its readers. The newspa
j per is probably of more value to
I society as a critic of government
and a short-circuiter of propaganda
than it is as a medium.
Stimulates Reflex
"Propaganda is a short-cut to
i thinking," the speaker explained,
l "in that it is calculated to stimu
! late a reflex response rather than
an intellectual one." The successful
propagandist is the one who, know
ing this, makes his campaign dog
matic, ambiguous, and symbolic.
Therefore he can control our actions
through controlling our attitudes.
