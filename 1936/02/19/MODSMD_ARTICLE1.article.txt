# Drama Group Refused Place On Committee
## Gib Holloway Appointed Head Of Convalescent Home Drive By Cardinals; Dates Asked 
### Annalee Whitmore 
With all members present, only
one ex-officio officer unaccounted
for, and no visitors, Ex Committee
last night concluded a routine meet
ing in the shortest time on record
this year.
DRAMATIC COUNCIL minutes,
disposing of the proposed revision
of that body, were accepted. No
change will be made. A complete
reorganization will probably be
necessary next year because of the
new theater. Council prefers the
status quo, at least temporarily.
BARNSTORMERS were refused
a position on Council. "But,"
pointed out Bob Gros, "five members
of Council already belong to Barn
stormers, so they're more than ade
quately represented." Suggestions
made by the Daily, as to curtailed
membership, were also considered.
GIB HOLLOWAY was appointed
by the Cardinals as Convalescent
Home Drive chairman, with Ex
Committee's long-deferred approval.
He is to choose his own committees,
assisted by Dick Stark and Wally
Brooke, and subject to the execu
tive group's sanction.
"BLIND DATES, PLEASE—2SO of
them," asked Miss Louise Price, and
threw the meeting into confusion.
On March 20, visiting college women
will be on campus, and a jolly-up
will be slated for them if enough
stray men can be found. Cardinals
will handle the situation.
"The campus wants to establish a
date bureau," .said Brooke. "I
s'pose the Cardinals will get it,
too," observed Helen Grover skep
tically. The Cardinals may, if the
measure ever comes to a vote.
DATE GRANTED was Alpha
Phi, April 18.
It was suggested that Dick
Creamer explain his outlined revi
sion of the group. "As an outlaw
member of this rather august body,
I'd rather not bring it up tonight,"
said he, withdrawing gracefully.
The committee will meet next
Tuesday at 5 o'clock instead of the
customory 7:15, because of the rally
assembly scheduled for that night.
"Can everybody come?" questioned
President Brooke.
"Ye-e-es, but I have to get home
in time for dinner," dubiously as
sented Bobby Grayson.
"I move we adjourn," said Jack
Hanson at 7:40. "I second it," said
Grayson. "I third it," said Luisetti.
The motion was passed unanimously.
"I know what's wrong—Fullenwider
isn't here to dissent," discovered
Gros. The meeting adjourned.

The motion was passed unanimously.
"I know what's wrong—Fullenwider
isn't here to dissent," discovered
Gros. The meeting adjourned.
With all members present, only
one ex-officio officer unaccounted
for, and no visitors, Ex Committee
last night concluded a routine meet
ing in the shortest time on record
this year.
DRAMATIC COUNCIL minutes,
disposing of the proposed revision
of that body, were accepted. No
change will be made. A complete
reorganization will probably be
necessary next year because of the
new theater. Council prefers the
status quo, at least temporarily.
BARNSTORMERS were refused
a position on Council. "But,"
pointed out Bob Gros, "five members
of Council already belong to Barn
stormers, so they're more than ade
quately represented." Suggestions
made by the Daily, as to curtailed
membership, were also considered.
GIB HOLLOWAY was appointed
by the Cardinals as Convalescent
Home Drive chairman, with Ex
Committee's long-deferred approval.
He is to choose his own committees,
assisted by Dick Stark and Wally
Brooke, and subject to the execu
tive group's sanction.
"BLIND DATES, PLEASE—2SO of
them," asked Miss Louise Price, and
threw the meeting into confusion.
On March 20, visiting college women
will be on campus, and a jolly-up
will be slated for them if enough
stray men can be found. Cardinals
will handle the situation.
"The campus wants to establish a
date bureau," .said Brooke. "I
s'pose the Cardinals will get it,
too," observed Helen Grover skep
tically. The Cardinals may, if the
measure ever comes to a vote.
DATE GRANTED was Alpha
Phi, April 18.
It was suggested that Dick
Creamer explain his outlined revi
sion of the group. "As an outlaw
member of this rather august body,
I'd rather not bring it up tonight,"
said he, withdrawing gracefully.
The committee will meet next
Tuesday at 5 o'clock instead of the
customory 7:15, because of the rally
assembly scheduled for that night.
"Can everybody come?" questioned
President Brooke.
"Ye-e-es, but I have to get home
in time for dinner," dubiously as
sented Bobby Grayson.
"I move we adjourn," said Jack
Hanson at 7:40. "I second it," said
Grayson. "I third it," said Luisetti.
