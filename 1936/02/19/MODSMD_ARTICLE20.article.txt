Does the Stanford rough go for
Garbo, Harlow, Crawford, Hep
burn? Oi just who does he pay in
his money at the box ofiice to see?
Does h > favor comedies, tear-jerk
ers, the March of Time, or Mickey
Mouse?
Here's the dope, according to local
theater managers and a recent sur
vey of the rougher Roughs:
Musical comedies seem to be the
favorite item of interest, particularly
such hits as "Broadway Melody of
1936" and "Top Hat." The rough is
sure to see anything featuring those
two top-spot hoofers, Astaire and
Rogers, i.nd recently Eleanor Pow
ell has become one of his favorites.
Among those musical stars who have
some connection with opera, he finds
Jeanette MecDonald, Grace Moore,
and Lily Pons especially good, and
seems to feel that a little culture, if
sugar-coatod, is good for any man.
It is as r connoisseur of high
tlass films that the rough has ac
quired his reputation. In order to
fill out contiacts, it is occasionally

j necessary to couple a poor picture
! with a relatively good one. When
ever this occurs the rough protests,
j and protests vigorously. He is ac
| customed tc the best, and gets it,
or else. Managers find that the
i pudgy villainies of Charles Laugh-
I ton and the heroics of Errol Flynn
j are appreciated just as much by the
rough as the antics of the latest
| feminine sensation.
Among the outstanding female
stars his favorites include Claudette
i Colbert, always eagerly awaited,
Joan Crawford, Frances Langford,
| the glamorous Garbo, Jean Harlow,
I and Katherine Hepburn. Tastes
vary, and fortunately Hollywood
has enough actresses in its employ
i to satisfy all tastes, even those of
| the finicky rough.
In the field of short subjects the
rough likes the March of Time, and
displays a lively interest in Mickey
I Mouse and Popeye. Fox-Movietone
is the favorite newsieel, mid hissing
Mussolini is still the quickest way to
I land in the Paly bastille.

Garbo, Harlow, Crawford, Hep
burn? Oi just who does he pay in
his money at the box ofiice to see?
Does h > favor comedies, tear-jerk
ers, the March of Time, or Mickey
Mouse?
Here's the dope, according to local
theater managers and a recent sur
vey of the rougher Roughs:
Musical comedies seem to be the
favorite item of interest, particularly
such hits as "Broadway Melody of
1936" and "Top Hat." The rough is
sure to see anything featuring those
two top-spot hoofers, Astaire and
Rogers, i.nd recently Eleanor Pow
ell has become one of his favorites.
Among those musical stars who have
some connection with opera, he finds
Jeanette MecDonald, Grace Moore,
and Lily Pons especially good, and
seems to feel that a little culture, if
sugar-coatod, is good for any man.
It is as r connoisseur of high
tlass films that the rough has ac
quired his reputation. In order to
fill out contiacts, it is occasionally

j necessary to couple a poor picture
! with a relatively good one. When
ever this occurs the rough protests,
j and protests vigorously. He is ac
| customed tc the best, and gets it,
or else. Managers find that the
i pudgy villainies of Charles Laugh-
I ton and the heroics of Errol Flynn
j are appreciated just as much by the
rough as the antics of the latest
| feminine sensation.
Among the outstanding female
stars his favorites include Claudette
i Colbert, always eagerly awaited,
Joan Crawford, Frances Langford,
| the glamorous Garbo, Jean Harlow,
I and Katherine Hepburn. Tastes
vary, and fortunately Hollywood
has enough actresses in its employ
i to satisfy all tastes, even those of
| the finicky rough.
In the field of short subjects the
rough likes the March of Time, and
displays a lively interest in Mickey
I Mouse and Popeye. Fox-Movietone
is the favorite newsieel, mid hissing
Mussolini is still the quickest way to
I land in the Paly bastille.
