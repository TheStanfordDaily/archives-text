# 'Barnstormers' Will Not Be Represented On Dramatic Council
## Cast Selected for Production Of 'Paths of Glory'; Faculty Members Will Be Included 
### 
As a result of a special meeting
of Dramatic Council held yesterday
afternoon, it was decided that
"Barnstormers" should be denied a
representative to the council. One
of Ihe chief reasons for the move
was that five members of the em
bryonic dramatic society are al
ready members of Dramatic Council
in other capacities.
In making the resolution it was
moved: "That Dramatic Council
go on record as maintaining the
status quo of the council, not
making any changes in the mem
bership of the council until the in
evitable revision which will conic
with the new set-lip next year,
following the completion of the
New Theater."
"Barnstormers" was organized
last spring immediately following
the production of the "Follies Bour
geois." It bases its membership
upon directorial, managerial, and
creative qualifications rather than
emphasizing dramatic qualities.
The society was formally recognized
by Ex Committee at the meeting
last Tuesday.
They will produce a musical show
annually, along the same lines as
last spring's venture, being written
and staged entirely by the students,
under the auspices of Dramatic
Council, with the proceeds revert
ing to that organization.
