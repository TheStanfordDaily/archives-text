# Pictures Depict U.S. Waterways
## Development of Mississippi Valley Transportation Told By Corporation Representative 
### 
"Our Inland Waterways," shown
last night in the Assembly Hall by
representatives of the Inland Water
ways Corporation, is a picture de
picting the development of the Mis
sissippi Valley water transportation
and its significance in war and
peace.
A short talk by Captain T. Q. Ash
burn, West Coast representative of
the corporation, preceding the pic
ture, explained the costs and the
purpose of the organization.
Organized in 1924 by an Act of
Congress, the Inland Waterways
Corporation has been a subject of
controversy between those who ad
vocate it and those who are against
government control of transporta
tion
Captain Ashburn stated that it
was more a political and defense
issue than an ecoomical one. Its
economic significance lies only in the
fact that it is trying to determine
the true costs of shipping and so cut
down the expense, not to give com
petition to the private transporta
tion companies now in existence.
It was also stated that the corpo
ration is operating independently of
appropriations from Congress, and if
allowed to continue, further devel
opment. in shipping as well as lower
costs will result.
