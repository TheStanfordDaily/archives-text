# Notables To Grace Next Chaparral
## 
### 
The list of contributors for the
March edition of the Chaparral is
beginning to look like an edition of
"Who's Who." First it announced
that Ray Lyman Wilbur would write
an article for the next issue, and
yesterday "Old Boy" Copp announ
ced that movie actor Ronald Cai
man would also contribute.
And not only THAT, Copp has
up his lengthy sleeve information
concerning other notables whose
names will grace the contributor's
list. What next??
