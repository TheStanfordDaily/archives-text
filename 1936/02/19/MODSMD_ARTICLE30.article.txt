LEXINGTON, K.v., Feb. 18 (/!').-
George Keller raised a fine crop of
burly tobacco back in 1892. The
next year he sent some of his crop
to the Chicago World's Fair and il
won a prize.
Recently a hand of the prize to
bacco whs returned to him. The 43-
year-old leaf was in good condition,
having spent the intervening years
in a Cyiithiana warehouse, where it
was sent by mistake after the fair.
