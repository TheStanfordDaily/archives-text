# Call Issued For Drive Members
## More Hall Residents Asked To Report to Gib Holloway For Convalescent Drive Places 
### 
Stressing the apparent laxity of
interest in participation in the Con
valescent Home Drive shown by hali
residents, Drive Chairman Gib Hol
loway asked last night that more
students let him know if they are
interested in working on any of the
committees.
Holloway mentioned that all of
Row organizations, especially the
sororities, were sending in nuner
out representatives, but that a very
small percentage of those who had
turned in their names were from
halls.
The most important positions,
committee heads and the like, will
be filled in two or three days, said
Holloway but '>he members of the
committee themselves will not be
announced for several weeks.
The Convalescent Home Drive is
the largest all-University activity of
the year, continued Holloway, and
students should be willing and anx
ious to work on it, not so much for
the personal publicity, but for the
charitable results.
