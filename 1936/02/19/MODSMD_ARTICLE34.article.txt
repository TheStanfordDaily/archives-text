HERBERT HOOVER'S PART in
the coming election is on more minds
than just that of your columnist.
The former president in register
ing to vote as a citizen of California
gave his occupation as being "en
gineer."
Had he given his true occupation,
that of "Coach of the Republican
Team," pundits would have had a
clearer picture of the role he will
play in the November drama.
A DEFINITE ASSET to ihe
Grand Old Party, Herbert Hoover
can lend his invaluable political ex
perience and ability by counfiiing
with Republican leaders, speech
making, and directing
maneuvers.
Possibly the former pros dent's
forthcoming political role caa be best
stated by giving him ♦"* o f1 " r
"Consulting Director oi >-
lican Motion Picture C.r.pany" or
"Chairman of the Board of Direc
tors, Republican Political Corpora
tion."
A SUBDUED RUMBLE from El
Camino Reai to the Phi Psi House
has crossed and recrossed the cam
pus. The quiet row is one concern
ing the withdrawal of Stanford from
the 1.C.4A. track meet.
Led by none other than Presi
dent Wally Brooke, the Pacific In
tercollegiates advocates won their
point at that particular BAC meet
ing which decided to abandon the
exclusive 1.C.4A. meet in favor of
our own Coast Conference track
and field deballe.
SAM KLOPSTOCK was the stu
dent leader and BAC member who
favored remaining in the East's big
meet, but his arguments were to no
avail.
Arguments favoring our with
drawal frcm the 1.C.4A. included
such obvious objections as: (1) The
team is making two trips to the
East anyhow (N.C.A.A. and the
Olympic Tryouts), why send them
on a third; (2) The Coast meet was
already planned for the same week
end, and surely Stanford should
participate in its own conference's
meet; (3) California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. are not participating in the
1.C.4A., why should we?
THE PACIFIC INTERCOLLE
GIATES either had to be sched
uled for conflicting week-end or not
at all. The question before the Coast
Conference big-wigs was whether to
have a meet of our own and with
draw from the tradition-soaked
1.C.4A. or go East and leave the
Coast without an important track
Mid field circus of its own.
THE B.A.C. can undoubtedly af
ford a third trip. Three Rose Bowl
gates are in its pocket. The rub
comes, however, in the interference
with the athletes' studies and the
doubtful honor of winning the meet
without severe competition from
our California contemporaries.

pus. The quiet row is one concern
ing the withdrawal of Stanford from
the 1.C.4A. track meet.
Led by none other than Presi
dent Wally Brooke, the Pacific In
tercollegiates advocates won their
point at that particular BAC meet
ing which decided to abandon the
exclusive 1.C.4A. meet in favor of
our own Coast Conference track
and field deballe.
SAM KLOPSTOCK was the stu
dent leader and BAC member who
favored remaining in the East's big
meet, but his arguments were to no
avail.
Arguments favoring our with
drawal frcm the 1.C.4A. included
such obvious objections as: (1) The
team is making two trips to the
East anyhow (N.C.A.A. and the
Olympic Tryouts), why send them
on a third; (2) The Coast meet was
already planned for the same week
end, and surely Stanford should
participate in its own conference's
meet; (3) California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. are not participating in the
1.C.4A., why should we?
THE PACIFIC INTERCOLLE
GIATES either had to be sched
uled for conflicting week-end or not
at all. The question before the Coast
Conference big-wigs was whether to
have a meet of our own and with
draw from the tradition-soaked
1.C.4A. or go East and leave the
Coast without an important track
Mid field circus of its own.
THE B.A.C. can undoubtedly af
ford a third trip. Three Rose Bowl
gates are in its pocket. The rub
comes, however, in the interference
with the athletes' studies and the
doubtful honor of winning the meet
without severe competition from
our California contemporaries.
HERBERT HOOVER'S PART in
the coming election is on more minds
than just that of your columnist.
The former president in register
ing to vote as a citizen of California
gave his occupation as being "en
gineer."
Had he given his true occupation,
that of "Coach of the Republican
Team," pundits would have had a
clearer picture of the role he will
play in the November drama.
A DEFINITE ASSET to ihe
Grand Old Party, Herbert Hoover
can lend his invaluable political ex
perience and ability by counfiiing
with Republican leaders, speech
making, and directing
maneuvers.
Possibly the former pros dent's
forthcoming political role caa be best
stated by giving him ♦"* o f1 " r
"Consulting Director oi >-
lican Motion Picture C.r.pany" or
"Chairman of the Board of Direc
tors, Republican Political Corpora
