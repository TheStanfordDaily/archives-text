# Ball Team Meets U.S.F. Saturday
## 
### 
A game with the University of
San Francisco ball club was added
to the varsity nine's practice sched
ule yesterday. The game will be
played this Saturday on the Sunken
Diamond.
Coach Harry Wolter hopes that
this game and the one against the
strong Moffat Field Aircraft Squad
ron team Thursday will get the In
dians in shape for the conference
opener against St. Mary's next
Wednesday. Because of the wet
weather the Caris have been able to
hold only one workout in the past
week.
