# Golfers Drill For Coast Tournament
## 
### 
Though hampered by soggy links,
Stanford golfers were working yes
terday in fiendish preparation for
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Golf Tournament to be held this
week-end at the Pebble Beach
course.
Stanford's chief hopes, Don Ed
wards, Morse Erskine, and Bob
Thompson, appear to be nearing the
top shape. Thompson and Erskine
led the in their weekly medal
rounds until last week, when Don
Edwards, who had been trailing,
picked up the difference. Edwards'
72-hole score of 298, much of which
was played through rain, will stand
In any company.
