# Coughlin Defied On House Floor
## Boland Brands Priest Greatest Threat to Government; Retracts Undignified Statement 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (/P).â€”Be :
fore a packed gallery, in a tensely
listening house, Representative Bo
land of Pennsylvania, Democratic
whip, today assailed Father Charles
E. Coughlin, radio priest, as a "dem
agogue and self-seeking imposter"
and "the chief threat to our exist
ing form of government."

He took the floor after Represent
ative O'Connor (D, N.Y.) said his
threat to "kick the Detroit radio
priest" was "undignified" and said
"I apologize" for the manner in
which he referred "to clerical gard."
O'Connor's statement, made dur
ing a 30 minute discussion of the
radio priest, apparently ended pos
sibilities of the personal booting en
gagement between the red headed
New Yorker and Father Coughlin,
which has kept the capital amused
since Sunday.
