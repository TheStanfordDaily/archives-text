# Brooke Advocates Using Bowl Profits for Intramural House

### Gordy Frost 
Firm in his belief that intramural
athletics are on the upgrade with the
"trend away from commercialized
intercollegiate sports", A.S.S.U. pres
ident Wally Brooke yesterday ad- I
vocated the expenditure of Rose
Bowl profits on the intramural sys- |
tem.
First step in the intramural build
up plan would be the erection of
an Intramural House to be operat
ed in connection with the Encina
Gymnasium for the housing of in
iramural equipment, managers' of- \
flees and possibly a mural basket
ball unit.
Murals Largest Activity
Brooke's action follows the issu- j
ing of the Bulletin on Physical Edu- i
cstion by the B.A.C. which estab
lishes definitely the fact that the |
intramural program is the largest
student activity on 4 he campus. Last
year 1100 men took part in mural
play; 523 were active in touch loot- j
ball, 4G5 in basketball, 427 entered (
the baseball competition. The sur

vey showed that the Row had an
average of one-third more men in
terested than the other groups to
gether.
At present the University budget

calk for approximately $500 per year
to bo expended upon, intramural
athletics. Says Brooke: "Harry Wol
ter and his assistants, the intra
| mural managers, have done an ex
ceptionally fine bit ol work in hand
ling so wide a field of activity with
so small a financial backing.'
Staff Requires Finances
But so that future intramural
staffs may have better University
financial support, Brooke advocates
that "Rose Bowl money, derived
lrom a relatively unexpected scource
1 t-hculd be used to further intra
. of Athletic Control note on Bran
ner Hall but should not be con
j ferred into depreciation and re
pair work; that some of this money
| should be used t ofurther intra
mural and interclass sports at Stan
ford".
Brooke's Intramural House sug
gestion is based upon observation of
ether Universities where inter-liv
ing group activities are not as pop-
I ular as Stanford's, but better facil-
I ities are maintained.

Brooke's action follows the issu- j
ing of the Bulletin on Physical Edu- i
cstion by the B.A.C. which estab
lishes definitely the fact that the |
intramural program is the largest
student activity on 4 he campus. Last
year 1100 men took part in mural
play; 523 were active in touch loot- j
ball, 4G5 in basketball, 427 entered (
the baseball competition. The sur

vey showed that the Row had an
average of one-third more men in
terested than the other groups to
gether.
At present the University budget

calk for approximately $500 per year
to bo expended upon, intramural
athletics. Says Brooke: "Harry Wol
ter and his assistants, the intra
| mural managers, have done an ex
ceptionally fine bit ol work in hand
ling so wide a field of activity with
so small a financial backing.'
Staff Requires Finances
But so that future intramural
staffs may have better University
financial support, Brooke advocates
that "Rose Bowl money, derived
lrom a relatively unexpected scource
1 t-hculd be used to further intra
. of Athletic Control note on Bran
ner Hall but should not be con
j ferred into depreciation and re
pair work; that some of this money
| should be used t ofurther intra
mural and interclass sports at Stan
ford".
Brooke's Intramural House sug
gestion is based upon observation of
ether Universities where inter-liv
ing group activities are not as pop-
I ular as Stanford's, but better facil-
I ities are maintained.

Firm in his belief that intramural
athletics are on the upgrade with the
"trend away from commercialized
intercollegiate sports", A.S.S.U. pres
ident Wally Brooke yesterday ad- I
vocated the expenditure of Rose
Bowl profits on the intramural sys- |
tem.
First step in the intramural build
up plan would be the erection of
an Intramural House to be operat
ed in connection with the Encina
Gymnasium for the housing of in
iramural equipment, managers' of- \
flees and possibly a mural basket
ball unit.
