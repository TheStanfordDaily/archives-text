# Carnival Booth Plans Wanted
## Specifications for Concessions Needed by Committee Before Final Decisions Can Be Made 
### 
Living groups whose concessions
for the Sophomore Carnival have
been approved will be contacted
this week for specifications con
cerning the size of the booths, prizes,
and equipment. This information is
necessary before the Carnival Com
mittee makes its final decisions.
Where duplications in ideas have
occurred, preference has been given
to those organizations operating that
concession in 1934.
A few secondary plans for booths
are left over and need some living
group to sponsor them. Application
for these and any new ideas may be
submitted to Guy Hagerty. Food
booths are particularly wanted.
Final decisions will be announced
early next week.
