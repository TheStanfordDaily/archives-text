A cow, contentedly munching shrubs
on the University of California cam
pus, was only moderately disturbed
when officer Robert La Rue blus
tered on the scene, shouting and
waving his arms.
She look a step, settled down in
the shade oj: a sign post, and gazed
at the irate officer, standing on the
other side of the sign.
It was the county line marker.
She had stepped out of La Rue's
jurisdiction.
