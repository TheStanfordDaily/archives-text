## WHY YELL ABOUT A SPLIT WITH TROY? 
### 
Everybody seems to be screaming 1
this week about "I wonder if we can
win one Lame from U.S.C." That's
not so good.
Why not win two, citizens?
ft is certainly not too much to
hope for. The Cards let Troy
down twice last month. They per
sonally feel that Troy is the easiest
team in the loop for them to heat
—easier than U.C.L.A.
Those clamoring loudest for a
.split this week-end forget the logic
of the above paragraph. They j
reckon ihat just because Cal dumped ;
us last Fciday, and very badly, that j
hereafter the Stanford aggregation
is equally ineffective, as were the
last 15 Stanford hoop teams.
Now, ot course when you sober |
up and scratch your head and recall j
the evident skill of citizens Luisetti,
Turner, Stoefen, Moore, Calderwood,
Zonne, .mi the rest, you'll once more
realize ihul a split with S.C. would j
be no m )ro of a Godsend than the
addition of a high school clarinet
player to Benny Goodman's oreh.
A split with S.C. and two vie- j
tories ol Cal over Ucla would Sun
day morning see those three teams !
stalemate with seven wins and !
four losses apiece. But should ;
our Reds annex hoth tilts down in j
Troyland, it would leave us with j
only Cal to heat, here IN THE '
PAVILION, for a clear title to the j
state crown. And all that only if
Cal wins twice this week-end.
So, seeing that the boys themselves j
think they can do it, why not string j
along wt'.h them -as the statutes say,
let them be right until proved'
wrong.
THE lIEAV\ »VEIGHT SITUA- |
TION is getting interesting again.
There's this 192-pound Dinuba \
Dreadnaught (Dinuba, by the way, is
down near Fresno), Phil Brubaker,
who deeisioned the old clowning,
fish-peddling playboy King Levinsky
Friday night at Dreamland, 8 rounds
out of 10.
They claim he's 21, but don't be
lieve that. Harry B. Smith is giving
him a terrific plug up in the city as
the big white hope, and he is known
to be a good boxer. What is lacking,
though, seems to be any kind of a
K.O. punch.
Then there's Maxie Baer, who
swore last fall he was through. He's
now reported as being in Oakland
and Hollywood simultaneously, do
ing little exhibition workouts and
bouts in the former and angling for
a horse opera contract m the other.
And over there with the lithe dark
body is Joe Louis, w'no looks more j
like ihe champ right now than Baer |
did last spring. They still can't fig- I
ure out how to get inside that deadly j
left hand of Ins.

THE lIEAV\ »VEIGHT SITUA- |
TION is getting interesting again.
There's this 192-pound Dinuba \
Dreadnaught (Dinuba, by the way, is
down near Fresno), Phil Brubaker,
who deeisioned the old clowning,
fish-peddling playboy King Levinsky
Friday night at Dreamland, 8 rounds
out of 10.
They claim he's 21, but don't be
lieve that. Harry B. Smith is giving
him a terrific plug up in the city as
the big white hope, and he is known
to be a good boxer. What is lacking,
though, seems to be any kind of a
K.O. punch.
Then there's Maxie Baer, who
swore last fall he was through. He's
now reported as being in Oakland
and Hollywood simultaneously, do
ing little exhibition workouts and
bouts in the former and angling for
a horse opera contract m the other.
And over there with the lithe dark
body is Joe Louis, w'no looks more j
like ihe champ right now than Baer |
did last spring. They still can't fig- I
ure out how to get inside that deadly j
left hand of Ins.

Everybody seems to be screaming 1
this week about "I wonder if we can
win one Lame from U.S.C." That's
not so good.
Why not win two, citizens?
ft is certainly not too much to
hope for. The Cards let Troy
down twice last month. They per
sonally feel that Troy is the easiest
team in the loop for them to heat
—easier than U.C.L.A.
Those clamoring loudest for a
.split this week-end forget the logic
of the above paragraph. They j
reckon ihat just because Cal dumped ;
us last Fciday, and very badly, that j
hereafter the Stanford aggregation
is equally ineffective, as were the
last 15 Stanford hoop teams.
Now, ot course when you sober |
up and scratch your head and recall j
the evident skill of citizens Luisetti,
Turner, Stoefen, Moore, Calderwood,
Zonne, .mi the rest, you'll once more
realize ihul a split with S.C. would j
be no m )ro of a Godsend than the
addition of a high school clarinet
player to Benny Goodman's oreh.
A split with S.C. and two vie- j
tories ol Cal over Ucla would Sun
day morning see those three teams !
stalemate with seven wins and !
four losses apiece. But should ;
our Reds annex hoth tilts down in j
Troyland, it would leave us with j
only Cal to heat, here IN THE '
PAVILION, for a clear title to the j
state crown. And all that only if
Cal wins twice this week-end.
So, seeing that the boys themselves j
think they can do it, why not string j
along wt'.h them -as the statutes say,
let them be right until proved'
wrong.
