# Second Teams Start in Hoop Game Tonight
## Moore, Heath, Nobs, Robertson, Quade Will Enter Against Potent U.S.F. Baskstballers 
### 
No conference title will be won or
lost tonight, but Stanford's basket
ball season may be greatly affected
by what does happen. If the Indians
can defeat the U.S.F. Duns, who in
vade the Pavilion at 8 o'clock, they
will not only improve their record
but also get well started on the
comeback trail.
Carefully saving his regulars for
the all-important Trojan series in
the southland this week-end, Coach
John Bunn will start his second
ttam against the Dons.
Seconds To Start
Forwards will be Captain Dinty
Moore and Bill Quade; center, Ken
Nobs; and guard ;, Sparky Robert
son and Nellie Heath. The first
stringers will go in only if and when
they're needed.
Matched alternately against the
regulars and Wytze Goiter's scrub
five in a vigorous scrimmage yester
day, this new group of seconds
worked well together. All but Heath
have had plenty of experience, and
the stocky sophomore guard looked
good in the last Bear game.
Dons To Withhold Regulars
Coach Wally Cameron, star guard
of great U.S.F. teams seven or eight
years ago', will probably match
Bunn's move by starting his own
shock troops. This foxy practice
gave him an easy 37-25 victory over
Santa Clara in his last game.
Boast Good Record
Winners in nine of their fourteen
tussles this year, the Dons include
California, St. Mary's, and the
Y.M.C.A., besides the Broncs, among
their victims. Their conquest of the
Bears was by a 42-39 margin, just
before the last Santa Clara affair.
Only the Y.M.1., St. Mary's, the
Olympic Club, and Golden State
have beaten Cameron's team.
Probable starting line-ups are as
follows:
U.S.F. Pos. Stanford
Patton F Moore (C)
Scheppler F Quade
Hedman C Nobs
Walsh G Robertson
Bugge G Heath
Admission will be free to students
with cards.
