Dramatic Council yesterday recognized the
age-old policy of muddling through. It is a
good policy. The English have used it with
remarkable success for years. Stanford, Lord
bless her, has always accepted it as an un
common part of its common law.
Reasoned the Council Ihusly: there is less
than a half of a year to go before the Council
has lo face the complete reorganization that
the New Theater will bring.
Reasoned the Council (via Hob (iros)
Ihusly: Dramatic Council already has live
members of Barnstormers, serving the group
in other capacities.
Reasoned the Council Ihusly: if we make
any drastic changes il will only focus Ex Com
mittee attention on the matter and may lead
lo cutting down the live members of Barn
stormers already on the Council.
Reasoned the Council thuslv: ain't we got
fun?
The Council is right. It has fun, and il will
have fn 11 for the next live months. After all,
there may be no reason to change now; the
effort might be futile. There probably is
nothing very important or urgent for the
Dramatic Council to do in that lime. Pardon
I'm: Daily for ever thinking so.
