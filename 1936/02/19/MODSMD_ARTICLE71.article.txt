# The 						Kansas Budget-Balancer
## 
### Dave Botsford 
"The time has come for a stingy man to be Presi- '
dent of the United States. Governor Alf M. Landon is
a stingy man." So said Henry J. Allen, senator from '
Kansas, when the Jayhawk governor was named last
fall as a contender for the Republican nomination for
the national presidency.
Alfred Mossman Landon is, indeed, "stingy." And ;
almost entirely upon the possibility that he would be j
"stingy" with federal funds if he ever got into the
White House do his presidential nomination chances
lie. The fact is, not until last summer, when he an
nounced the Kansas budget balanced, did the Repub
lican big chiefs give him more than a second thought.

How was Alf Landon able to balance his budget
in times when Kansas farmers were suffering from
drought, from overproduction and loss of markets?
With federal relief and AAA funds, candid observers
answer. Without this federal aid to his people, they
say, Landon's budget-balancing program would have
failed miserably.
The fact remains, however, that Alf Landon did
wipe out deficits right and left, put the state of Kansas
on a strictly pay-as-you-go basis. To many millions
of Americans frightened by Mr. Roosevelt's spend
now-and-pay-later programs, Republicans hope to :
"sell" Alf Landon.

The governor's first step toward a balanced budget
was salary slashes. State employees' salaries were cut
in half, university professors reduced to $140 a month.
I hen all allegedly useless jobs and departments were |
abolished, state bureaus consolidated.
For instance, all state inspection agencies were !
lumped into one department. Building programs were i
scrapped. The results of Landon's ruthless economy \
brought forth a fiery opposition. Social workers com- j
plained bitterly.

AAA. before its death last month, had been pouring j
$60,000,000 a year into Kansas, without which observ- i
ers say the state would now be hopelessly in the red.
While other states matched federal work relief dollar
for dollar, not "one thin dime" did the Kansas state j
government appropriate. Governor Landon pushed the I
burden of relief on to the local governments which, !
in turn, had to take money from sorely-needed school !
and road funds. Hundreds of schools were closed and j
teachers' pay cut to as low as $25 a month.
Kansas, during the Landon regime, has been pay
ing but V/ 2 per cent of school bills out of the state
treasury. California pays f»0 per cent, New York 30
per cent.

Landon explains his budget policy as "horse sense, 1
spending only what you have." Costs are the test |
rather than what is needed.
These are some of the facts surrounding Kansas' 1
balanced budget. As Alf Lai.don's campaign for the ■
Republican nomination, perhaps the presidency itself,
progresses, he will be forced to answer charges that j
federal funds really balanced his budget. But until
now, quiet, home-townish Al! has let the Republican ,
Party and William Randolph Hearst do his talking.

night-at-the-Library institution may develop
in spring quarter.
Granted that this concession is but a stop
gap, agitation tor Sunday nights in the Phi
Bete house can wait until the results of this
quarter's trials are seen. •
The Daily is not proposing this Sunday
night business as a cure-all lor improvement
in scholarship. As a matter-of-fact scholastic
efforts seem to be controlled by some great
psychic phenomena. For instance, Library
circulation has experienced an uncxpluinahlc
drop during the past two weeks.
However, the Library's opening on Sunday
night may do away with the frustration at
tendant to the Stanford week-end social lag.
Sunday night is not party night at Stanford.
Friday night is. The fact is lamentable, but
true.
