# Our Hasher Sez:

### 
While service club speakers deplore the fateful
increase of deaths due to auto accidents, I would like
to remind the good people of this sovereign state that
these are not the only signs of peril and approaching
decay in our civilization. Fraternity men are said to
be dying like flies, that is, in dumps. Statistics show
that there is a high infant mortality rate among
readers of Our Hasher Sez. There is a reported in
crease in deaths due to high blood pressure among
elderly bankers who look at cartoons in Esquire.
Twenty sorority women in Michigan died from food
poisoning, when the sleeve of a hasher's jacket fell in
the soup. Besides all this, we must face the fact that
death inevitably comes to the Archbishop.

The hazards of loving nature, however, seem to
be the worst of all. One lover of the fresh out-of-doors
was weaving his way across the fields and hillocks
that separate the President's residence on Lagunita
Knoll from the garbage cans and service alleys of
Fraternity Row a few nights ago. This nature-doter
was intoxicated by the sheer rapture of the night, and
other things, but he was making definite progress
toward the Phi Sig house. A biother slipped up behind
him and said, "Boo." The woodsman, who thought it
was Dr. Wilbur, fell fiat on his face and sprained his
ankle.

But this is not all, there is a Deke hasher at the
Tri-Delt who gets that woodsy feeling every once in a
while. So he takes long walks in the hills with one
of his customers.
On the first voyage out, the two were sitting in a
crotchety old oak reading Ranch Romances, or some
thing, when all of a sudden like this: Oops! They fell
over backwards out of the tree. This experience frac
tured a Deke shin bone.
On the second voyage out, the Deke cavorted in
front of his companion to show how agile he was.
While bounding down the road at express-train
speed, he threw a shoe find flopped on his physiog
nomy. Box score: water on the knee.
On the third sortee, the two came to the flora
collecting cycle (this is frequently followed by the
ain't-we-got-fauna stage). The Deke began picking
up shrubs as he walked along, chewing and caressing
them and playfully switching the Tri-Delt legs. Said
the Tri-Delt: "That looks like poison ivy to me."
"Heck, no," said the Deke. "That isn't poison ivy."
The Deke was right. It .vas poison oak.

On the third sortee, the two came to the flora
collecting cycle (this is frequently followed by the
ain't-we-got-fauna stage). The Deke began picking
up shrubs as he walked along, chewing and caressing
them and playfully switching the Tri-Delt legs. Said
the Tri-Delt: "That looks like poison ivy to me."
"Heck, no," said the Deke. "That isn't poison ivy."
The Deke was right. It .vas poison oak.
While service club speakers deplore the fateful
increase of deaths due to auto accidents, I would like
to remind the good people of this sovereign state that
these are not the only signs of peril and approaching
decay in our civilization. Fraternity men are said to
be dying like flies, that is, in dumps. Statistics show
that there is a high infant mortality rate among
readers of Our Hasher Sez. There is a reported in
crease in deaths due to high blood pressure among
elderly bankers who look at cartoons in Esquire.
Twenty sorority women in Michigan died from food
poisoning, when the sleeve of a hasher's jacket fell in
the soup. Besides all this, we must face the fact that
death inevitably comes to the Archbishop.

The hazards of loving nature, however, seem to
be the worst of all. One lover of the fresh out-of-doors
was weaving his way across the fields and hillocks
that separate the President's residence on Lagunita
Knoll from the garbage cans and service alleys of
Fraternity Row a few nights ago. This nature-doter
was intoxicated by the sheer rapture of the night, and
other things, but he was making definite progress
toward the Phi Sig house. A biother slipped up behind
him and said, "Boo." The woodsman, who thought it
was Dr. Wilbur, fell fiat on his face and sprained his
ankle.

But this is not all, there is a Deke hasher at the
Tri-Delt who gets that woodsy feeling every once in a
while. So he takes long walks in the hills with one
of his customers.
On the first voyage out, the two were sitting in a
crotchety old oak reading Ranch Romances, or some
thing, when all of a sudden like this: Oops! They fell
over backwards out of the tree. This experience frac
tured a Deke shin bone.
On the second voyage out, the Deke cavorted in
front of his companion to show how agile he was.
While bounding down the road at express-train
speed, he threw a shoe find flopped on his physiog
nomy. Box score: water on the knee.
