# IT'S HOPELESS, THEY SAY

The Editor, Sir:
Thursday you took the public ex- j
ercises committee down a notch j
for letting Rowell speak on "The j
Asiatic Crisis." Friday you com
plained because we don't have the
current political and economic scene
properly analyzed.
Now we may be wrong, but we
think you are on the wrong track.
If the public exercises committee
presented a lecture entitled, "Is 1
Mussolini really fighting a war to
bolster a weakened spirit of nat- i
ionalism?", our bet is that the stu
dents would still go on to the movies
and the pub exercises committee!
would be leprimanded by the
powers that be.
We don't go all the way with
Freud, but on the adolescent we
think he is right. If some group
of the campus would present a lec
ture on "Sex Life in Russia", you
might find the students would stay
away from the movies to hear about
"foreign affairs"
