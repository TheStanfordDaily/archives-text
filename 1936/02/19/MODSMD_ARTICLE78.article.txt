# MISSES INDIAN HEAD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Why not keep on with the Indian
head to the paper? It was very in
teresting and colorful and seemed to
lighten the cold, black ink beneath.
Further, it encouraged local pride.
Every Stanford student likes the In
dian characterization of the school.
Looking forward to getting back the
best head the Daily ever had. â€”
