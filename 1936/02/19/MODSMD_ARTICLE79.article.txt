# Gaieties Stars To Sing Over KGO Tonight
## RADIO RATINGS 
### 
High spot on today's radio pro
grams, at least for the Farm, is
the broadcast over the NBC Pa
j cific Coast Blue Network of music
front the Stanford "Gaieties," |
played by Tom Coaklcy and his
St. Francis Hotel orchestra and
sung by "Gaieties" stars. Time:
10:30 over KGO.
LILY PONS will sing Rossini's
aria, "Una Vovo Poco Fa" from
"The Barber of Seville" and Saint |
I Saens' "Rossignol de Parisatys" over!
KFRC at 6 o'clock.
RAY NOBLE'S brilliant settings
| of modern dance hits and Connie
Boswell's songs will be highlights of
the "Refreshment Time" broadcast
! over KFRC at 6:30.
It is an amusing and little known
| fact that Ray never had a band of
j his own until he came to the United
| States a year ago. What first
brought him fame in this country ;
in recent seasons was the tremen
dous sale of recordings by "Ray
j Noble's Mayfair Dance Orchestra,"
which was really non-existent. !
Whenever Ray had some new music j
to record he simply called up the
best players he knew in town, re
| hearsed them, made his records, and
; disbanded the group.
Gracie Allen will complain of the
j unseasonably warm weather the
country has been having in the
BURNS AND ALLEN program at
8:30 on KFRC.
Henrik Ibsen's "PEER GYNT,"
1 adapted for radio and presented by
40 members of the Seattle Reper
tory Players, will be broadcast over
; KGO at 9 o'clock.
