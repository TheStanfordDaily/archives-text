## SPITING THE OUTWORN SYSTEM 
### 
Dr. Harold Chapman Brown . . .!
philosophy professor . . . deserves a |
j medal of honor for being a rebel . . . I

for coming out in
It he open last
week against a
j malignant re -
1 tardcr of academ
! ic progress . . .
! by advocating the
j abolishment of
the out worn
j grading system

which was deplored in this column 1
yesterday.
* * *
Strange or unusual for a man i
within the faculty circle to malign j
a system he is required to abide by? |
Not at all. We have heard another !
Stanford professor actually say he .
would forfeit a part of his salary if |
he could teach without giving I
grades; heard many others privately |
express their contempt for the ,
ABCD method of informing a stu
dent how much he has learned in a j
course.
* * *
Of course it's highly courageous j
to libel the present grading system, j
but painting it as vicious is very
futile so far as effecting any kind
of reform is concerned. Stump
speeches never won a revolution. !
Never, either, will Walrus Club dis- !
cuKsions or outbursts such as this '
change the grading system. No vio- j
lent revolt can be waged against;
something you can't lay your hands
on. So, what is to be done? Just
tills—
Hi # lit
The grading system as it is should
be abolished. And though it be
treason, this Bull Sessioner advo

cMes revolution to achieve that
abolishment in the form of passive
protest by ignoring grades as if
they didn't exist.
* * *
I've been carrying on a private
revolution of this nature for about
a year. This is what it involves.
Never work towards a grade. For
get that they exist. Leave those
fancy final grade sheets down in the
Ad Building to rot, as they should.
| Take all the exams that come along
i if they are reasonably convenient,
J and turn in the required papers. This
must be done to get through a
| course and to graduate—two things
I which are, in most cases, desirable.
* * *
I
Study and attempt to learn those 1
I things in a course which seem val-
I uable. That amounts to about 50
| per ccnt of the material presented. '
If you do this, you're bound to flunk ■
! things now and then, but that's part
I of the system. The main thing is to
I have a supreme contempt for grades
!of all sorts. If you get an A, it !
probably means that something i:s
j given in a course which is valuable, i
If a minus turns up, the material
covered in the ex or paper likely is ;
hooey.
I* * *
Supposing half the students pro
j cceded on this basis. Grade sheets I
I would pile up, class averages would j
J look like a depression graph,
I scholastic averages would go down, !
and the administration might con
clude that the grading system was- !
n't liked. And if they did some- i
thing about it, the revolution would !
be a success.
