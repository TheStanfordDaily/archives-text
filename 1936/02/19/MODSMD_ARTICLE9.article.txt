### 
Enthusiastic over the results of
her first mid-year Daily rushin'
meeting, Women's Editor Doro
thy Sweet has issued a call for
all tryoutees and others inter
ested in joining the Daily editor
ial staff to meet in the journalism
library in the Press BuiJding at 5
o'clock this afternoon.
Additional men tryoutees are
being recruited hy Miss Sweet,
since only 9 of the 22 who attend
ed the first meeting on Monday
were men. "Rewards for con
scientious work on the paper in
the form of high positions on the
editorial staff are sure," she de
clared.
Each tryoutee is requested to
write and bring with him to the
meeting either a news or a fea
ture story. In addition, he is ex
pected to spend five hours at the
Daily shack this week in order to
learn the routine duties of the re
porter.
At the close of a two-week try
out period during which the can
didates are rated by various mem
bers of the staff, the most prom
ising are to be selected by the Edi
torial Board to be promoted to be
come full-fledged reporters.
