# Councils Join To Initiate Code Inquiry
## Clarification of Honor System Goal of Executive Group; Faculty To Be Questioned 
### Johnson Hill 
Machinery was set in motion last
night at a joint meeting of Men's
and Women's Councils to clarify
and evaluate the Honor System.
parley was held at the request
of Pat Flavel, chairman of Women's
Council. Gib Holloway, recently
elected to take the position of Bob
Gros, retiring chairman of Men's
Council, assisted in conducting the
discussion.
Opinions Sought
According to information released
to The Daily after the closed session,
an attempt will be made to secure
the opinions of department heads
c,nd other faculty representatives on
the comparative working value and
strength of the University Honor
Code. Results of this survey will
be used as a basis for definite ac
tion in determining the system's
place in academic procedure, it was
reported.
The Councils' initial step last night
was believed be the outgrowth of
a campaign on similar issues con
ducted last fall by Gros. Letters re
questing statements on the Honor
Code were sent to faculty execu
tives, of whom approximately one
half replied. No satisfactory con
census was reached, Gros stated.
"Our first move will be to sound
out representative professors and
student leaders," Patricia Flavel as
serted, "on certain phases of the
Honor System. We want to get a
majority of opinion before the
Councils formulate a new policy.
To Simplify Provisions
"Most students are aware that it
is against the code's principles to
cheat in examinations," she contin
ued, "but there are other provisions
with which they are less familiar.
We shall endeavor to simplify and
explain these articles so that students
may become better acquainted with
them."
Men's and Women's Councils will
hold another joint meeting to ar
range further mc-asure as soon as>
tabulations of the inquiry have been
made, it was said.
