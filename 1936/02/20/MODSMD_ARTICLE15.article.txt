### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 19 (/I s).â€”Briga
dier General William ("Billy") j
Mitchell, 57, died late today in Doc- [
tors' Hospital here after a long ill
ness of influenza and heart afflic- i
tion. He had been in the hospital
since January 28.
His open conflict with superiors
on War Department aviation policy
resulted in his court martial in 1925
and he was suspended from the
service for five years. He resigned
his commission in 1936 and con
tinued his criticisms of the War De
partment from the lecture platform!
Criticized Department
General Mitchell was known as
"the bad boy of aviation" to higher
governmental forces because of his
open criticisms of the War and Navy
Departments.
His suspension sentence was up
held by President Coolidge, but was
modified by allowance of half pay.
Promoted Rapidly
The son of U.S. Senator John
Ledrum and Harriet Danforth
Mitchell, Mitchell rose from a vol
unteer in the First Wisconsin In
fantry to command of the entire air
forces in the American Expedition
ary Forces.
He was the first American officer
to fly over the lines in the World
War and in the St. Mihiel offensive,
late in 1918, he commanded the
largest aerial concentration in the
history of the world.
