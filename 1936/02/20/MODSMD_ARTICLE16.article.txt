# Charity Cashes In On Puny Puns By Frosh Funnymen
## 
### 
It all began when someone at j
I Ilead Sponsor Ernie Arbuekle's j
table in Encina Commons wondered |
( if there wasn't a way to cash in on
the flow of wit which enlivens every
| meal . . .
Puns, it was decided, are worth at
j least, a cent —if bad enough. And j
I what puns aren't?
Jokes arc listed at anywhere from
one to five cents, the fine to be sub
j ject to the rule of the majority. Five
cents promises to be the standard
; rate—they're that kind of jokes.
Even Hasher Homer is not im
j mune to fines, and at present owes
three cents. Failure to turn up on
lime for meals also nets the kitty a
pretty penny.
Disposal of the rapidly growing
fund—seven cents at last count —
hovers between the Student Aid
Fund and a Home for Worn-Out
i Hashers.
