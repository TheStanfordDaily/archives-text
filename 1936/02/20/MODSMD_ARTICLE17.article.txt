# Bunn Delighted As Hoopsters Trim U.S.F.
## Coach Holds Half-hour Practice After Varsity Cagers Defeat Dons by Score of 43-36 
### John Kline 
"Talk about morale â€” the boys
have got plenty of morale. They
played just the game we planned to
play; and they had lots of fun doing
it. They hustled plenty."
Smiling John Bunn was smiling
indeed as he put his Indian hoop
sters through a half-hour practice
session after they had beaten U.S.F.,
45-36, last night.
Back into Good Form
Truly, the Redmen were back on
the gold standard after the Cal
drubbing of last week as they looked
forward to the crucial S.C. series;
for which they leave the Farm to
night. Friday and Saturday night's
melees will leave them a possible
first, second, or third in the confer
ence race.
Judging by last night's perform
ance, the top of the heap spot is
well in sight. Bunn was pleased to
note hopefuls Robertson and Stoefen
were well back on their games. The
rangy Arthur has been sick, but
looked fully recovered in chalking
four points in the second half.
The two second strings battled
through the first period to a 19-19
tie, although the Green-shirts led
almost to the gun. A small speedy
forward, ocheppler, was swishing
them to the tune of 9 points for
U.S.F.
Spark; on Rampage
Sparky Robertson went on a one
man rampage for the Indians, break
ing fast to push in 11 against the
seconds and two points during the
few minutes he played at the end
of the tussle to emerge as high
point man for the night.
Nobs got five and Moore three for
the second stringers, with Heath and
Quade being blanked, although the
latter played a fast game and shot
| a dozen times.
In the second half, Luisetti spark
i led in good form, taking two inter
ceptions down for cold-turkey set
ups, accounting for six points beside
his usual top-notch feeding game.
Turner Gets Nine
Turner found his eye in no uncer
tain way and credited himself with
I nine points of the Indian victory.
Bob Zonne was good for five points.
, Calderwood was the fifth first
stringer, but didn't break into the
' scoring. Nor did substitutes Lee,
! Bell, Heath, and Paine, who got
! into the last two minutes of play.
