Thirty Nine, whose attack and de
fense is built around the lanky cap
tain's ball-hawking and dead-eye
play, immediately became rattled,
bowed to a clever and determined
| J.C. team led by Kohn, a center
who sank them from all angles and
paced both teams with 11 points.
Stanford played better than their
j usual during the first half, and
J showed their superiority by piling
up a half time lead of 22-10, only to
tire and become shadowed in the
| second half. Zonne led with 9, was
followed by guards Neeley and Mc
j Arthur with 8 and 6.
