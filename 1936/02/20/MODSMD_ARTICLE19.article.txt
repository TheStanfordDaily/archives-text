# Spartans Drop Board Plan As Farm's Position Clarified
## 
### 
Formal notification that San Jose
State College's "skirts were washed
clean" as far as the Pacific Coast
Conference is concerned was re
ceived last night by Dr. Joseph
C. Hinsey, Stanford Faculty Ath
letic Representative.
In a letter to Dr. Hinsey, Pro
fessor H. C. Willett of U.S.C.. pres
ident of the Conference, said that
President T. W. McQuarrie of San
Jose had agreed that Ihe State Col
lege hereafter would abide by rules
of the Conference.
Future Meets Okayed
Future athletic engagements be
tween Conference schools and San
Jose will be permissable, the letter
said.
The decision is of no immediate
concern on the campus, Dr. Hin
sey said, since no games or meets
had been tentatively scheduled while
San Jose was attempting to clear
herself.
However, Stanford is now in a
position to compete with the Spar
tans without violation of confer
ence rules.
The Farm was subjected to con
siderable unfavorable publicity two
weeks ago when a basketball game
, that had been booked with San Jose

was cancelled because of a Con- J
ference regulation.
The Conlcrence, in its December
meeting, held an "informal discus- j
sion" of San Jose's room-and-board |
plan of furnishing athletes with j
j three meals a day and room, and j
voted a strict interpretation of its
rule, which says in part:
Riding Listed
"Four-year institutions not mem- j
hers of this Conference located in '
the Pacific Coast area . . . and com
peting in athletics with members
of this Conference, shall be re
quired to comply with the Pacific
Coast Conference rules in academic
I requirements and in all business J
and promotional matters in the con
duct of their athletic programs, ex
cept that this Conference may ac
cept in whole or in part the rules
of other conferences in which such
competing institutions are mem
bers ..."
No record of this decision was
published at the time, and in Jan- [
uary Dud DeGroot, San Jose coach,
was first informed that the Con
ference regulations forbade Stan
ford to play San Jose in baseball.
Confirms Stand
1 Stanford's position was later con

firmed by Professor Willelt, who
said the dictum provided that "San
Jose cannot compete in any athletic
contest, whether in a major or minor
sport, with the Conference schools."
The regulation whs interpreted
to refer only to matches scheduled
after December 10. California and
Oregon, bolh of whom had booked
meets before the 10th, consequently
were permitted to continue plans
to compete with the Spartans in
wrestling, baseball, and swimming.
Willet Steadfast
In correspondence during Jan
uary with both DeGroot. and Dr.
Hinsey, Professor Willett consis
tently insisted that San Jose must
either give up her room-and-board
plan or Conference schools would
not be permitted to schedule garner
and meets with her.
San Jose's decision, it is under
stood, is a permanent abandonment
of the room-and-board plan, al
though officials at the state col
lege expressed themselves as "satis
fied with the way the plan worked
during football season."
The Conference may take the mat
ter up again at its spring meeting,
if San Jose requests any clarifica
tion of the Conference stand.
