# Autumn Bidding Rejection Forces Substitute Plans
## Special Committee Will Attempt To Reconcile Own View with Suggestions of Dr. Wilbur 
### 
Three conflicting proposals must
be compromised into a workable
plan that will satisfy best interests
of "the fraternities, the freshmen,
and the Administration" before any
major change in Stanford's rushing
system can become effective.
This was made apparent last night
when the Interfraternity Board of
Control's special committee set about
the task of re-drafting a new rush
ing system to be submitted to the
Board and finally to Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur.
The original proposal, which
railed for autumn quarter pledg
ing, was approved by the Board
but met Administration objec
tions early this week, on the basis
that it violated the underlying
principle of the "onc-year-resi
dence" rule.
The special committee considered
plans, each calling for fall quarter
pledging. The proposal that the
Interfraternity Board finally ac
cepted—and the one of which most
of the fraternities expressed ap
proval—called for rushing to begin
immediately after Registration week
and to continue for thi-ee weeks,
with pledging shortly before mid
quarters.
Plans Outlined
The alternative plan was to begin
pledging immediately after mid
quarters, around November 1, and
continue until the week preceeding
Big Game.
Both proposals specified that rush
ing be entirely on-campus, but that
contact be made more free between
Encina and the Row by doing away
with a number of the minor regu
lations that now ban many normal
contacts as "illegal."
Wilbur Agrees
Dr. Wilbur, in upholding main
tenance of the one-year-in-Encina
principle, heartily agreed with the
proposal to do away with many
of the present minor rules, which
he said "only tempt the fraternities
to break them."
In refusing to acccpt the Board's
rushing plan. I)r. Wilbur sug
gested rushing strictly on-cam
pus, but eliminate all other regu
lations, and pledge the first week
of spring quarter.
The President said he had turned
down autumn quarter pledging be
cause the freshmen "cannot adapt
themselves to the campus or make
a fair evaluation of the group with
which they must live for three years
in that short time."
May R«' Unruly
With two quarters of wide open
on-campus rushing, the fraternities
might be unruly "for a couple of
years while getting used to the
plan," he commented, but after that
they would "settle down" and at
tempt. to make their contacts with
freshmen normal. "They would
have to, because in two quarters,
the freshmen would know which
houses were not observing the spirit
[ of the free contact," the President
argued.
The Interfraternity Board's pro
posal for fall quarter pledging cen
tered around the argument that the
period as it is now is "too long for
the nervous tension that rushing
I entails."
Board Gives Reasons
By moving pledging up to fall
quarter, the Board believed, rush
ing will not drog so much that the
I fraternities will be tempted to rush
illegally with "gaudy off-campus
spreads," and the more normal con
tact. that will develop from doing
away with many of the present rules
will eliminate last-minute "high
pressuring."
