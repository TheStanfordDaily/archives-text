CALIFORNIA'S NEWLYWED
governor extolled President Roose
velt Monday night as "a man raised
up by Almighty God to meet the
country's present crises." Frank
Merriam's 40-minute speech at the
Westminster Presbyterian Church in
Sacramento was entitled the
"Birthdays of Washington and Lin
coln."
Frequently mentioned as a Re
publican nominee possibility, Mer
riam threw party discretion aside
and spoke his mind. He is probably
no longer mentioned as a possible
candidate by members of the Re
publican party*
PRE SI DE N T ROOSEVELT'S
knack of mastering the psychological
moment is again displayed in his
calling an American Peace Congress.
llis move may prove not only val
uable iri effecting Pan-American
peace, but it may also build a big
ger and more lucrative South Amer
ican market for U.S. exports.
ALREADY HAVING accomp
lished more toward erasing the per
sistent and undeniable anti-Amer
ican sentiment in Latin America
than any of his predecessors in of
fice, the President offers the oppor
tunity of making stabilized peace
relations throughout the Americas
by his plan of "joint responsibility."
Only for a stabilized country will
the roads of long-time credit be
open, and only by means of these
roads can commercial projects,
which are so necessary to the up
building of Latin America, be
realized.
Only with a stabilized league of
the 21 American democracies can
each country cope with the apparent
and ever-increasing need for an ex
port trade relationship which be
fuddle Dame Europa can not, at
the moment, supply.
OGDEN NASH, who is no Amer
ican poet laureate, but who has the
rare ability of hitting the proverbial
nail on its proverbially hard head,
lists in this week's Post his wishes,
among which is found the following:
"And I wish that politicians who
are out of office wouldn't be so
shocked and horrified when poli
ticians who are in office play poli
tics just the way they themselves
look forward to doing when they
get back in."
J. P. MORGAN'S attitude toward
the press has completely reversed
itself since he went to Washington
for the Senate Munitions Investiga
tion.
Today he joshes the reporters and
buys them drinks, but the reason
for his previous avoidance of news
men is readily seen in the way in
which newsmen are quick to mis
interpret a remark of his on the
damage that the next war might
bring to civilisation.
"It might irreparably damage the
economic structure. It might do
away with the leisure class, and h
juu destroy the leisure class, you
destroy civilization," said Banker
Morgan.
THE PRESS kidded Morgan's
opinions on the leisure class on the
front pages of newspapers from
coast to coast.
Morgan meant by "leisure class"
the families with one or more serv
ants, and by "you destroy civiliza
tion" that the absence of mothers
with time to educate their children
would mean the eradication of the
dissemination of the American phi
losophy with which Morgan has al
ways lived and in which he thor
oughly believes. To him, its end is
the end of civilization.
