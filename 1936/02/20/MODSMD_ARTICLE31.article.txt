# Living Group Fleet Crowds Boat House
## 
### 
Despite rainy weather since La
gunita opened last Saturday, most
of the living groups have their ca
noes at the boathouse.
Encina, Lagunita, and Toyon Halls
have their boats at the lake, and
Roble's canoes, now being repaired
and repainted, are expected to be
ready thus week-end. The canoes
of 15 fraternities and sororities also
are in the boathouse.
