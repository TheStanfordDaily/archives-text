CP IN BERKELEY they're still
letting us know that a California re
lay team beat a Stanford ielay
team.
And lirally, for it seems that Cal's
victory at the Indoor Meet was the
first time four Cal men had teamed
up to trim four Farm men in 15
years of racing.
There was no argument about the
official reckoning, either. Jim Hel
nier of the Bears nosed out A1
Cranston in the final lap by the
width of Ihe latter's cotton upper.
But hire's where we have talk
ing points. Cranston was a pretty
sick boy by the time the relay
rolled around. He had shoveled
down a dinner in time to catch the
bus, and had lost some after the
GOO-yavd dash. So he ran very well
to stavo Helmer off till the last yard
or so.
And there was Jack Weiershauser
running first, after taking an awful
spill in the 300, evidently quite
shaken up. And the Card quartet
ran minus Jim Kneubuhl, the soph
sprinter, now a 440 man, who sports
a moan, powerfully gliding stride
in workouts, and who should be one
of the Coast's best this year.
Again all this adversity the Red
runners can't lie ashamed of losing.
It was just a succession of bad
breaks.
Indeed, some of the shrewder
track li !lowers these days are con
tending that the mile relay team is
f.oing to break the world record this
year.
And with some concrete grounds,
too. For in Weiershauser, Cran
ston, Kneubuhl, Dcllinger, Green,
Dean, Mallot, Burris, and Hyde
there are nine capable quarter-mil
ers, and by April, Coach Dink
should be able to press four of
them into service to jeopardize the
world mark set by the two Hables
brothers, Ben Eastman, and Maynor
Shove four years ago at 4.12;3.
Weiershauser and Dellinger are
two powerful, freight-train runners,
good for the type of fight needed
peculiarly in the relay. "Truck," of
course, is at present on the sidelines
with a bad thigh injury, but may still
get on the world-record team.
Kneubuhl's destiny for this sea
son is not as yet determined. A
plan that Dink likes has the boy
from Pago-Pago running the quar
ter for the first part of the season,
and then meeting George Anderson
of Cal in the Big Meet sprints.

world mark set by the two Hables
brothers, Ben Eastman, and Maynor
Shove four years ago at 4.12;3.
Weiershauser and Dellinger are
two powerful, freight-train runners,
good for the type of fight needed
peculiarly in the relay. "Truck," of
course, is at present on the sidelines
with a bad thigh injury, but may still
get on the world-record team.
Kneubuhl's destiny for this sea
son is not as yet determined. A
plan that Dink likes has the boy
from Pago-Pago running the quar
ter for the first part of the season,
and then meeting George Anderson
of Cal in the Big Meet sprints.
CP IN BERKELEY they're still
letting us know that a California re
lay team beat a Stanford ielay
team.
And lirally, for it seems that Cal's
victory at the Indoor Meet was the
first time four Cal men had teamed
up to trim four Farm men in 15
years of racing.
There was no argument about the
official reckoning, either. Jim Hel
nier of the Bears nosed out A1
Cranston in the final lap by the
width of Ihe latter's cotton upper.
But hire's where we have talk
ing points. Cranston was a pretty
sick boy by the time the relay
rolled around. He had shoveled
down a dinner in time to catch the
bus, and had lost some after the
GOO-yavd dash. So he ran very well
to stavo Helmer off till the last yard
or so.
And there was Jack Weiershauser
running first, after taking an awful
spill in the 300, evidently quite
shaken up. And the Card quartet
ran minus Jim Kneubuhl, the soph
sprinter, now a 440 man, who sports
a moan, powerfully gliding stride
in workouts, and who should be one
of the Coast's best this year.
Again all this adversity the Red
runners can't lie ashamed of losing.
It was just a succession of bad
breaks.
Indeed, some of the shrewder
track li !lowers these days are con
tending that the mile relay team is
f.oing to break the world record this
year.
And with some concrete grounds,
too. For in Weiershauser, Cran
ston, Kneubuhl, Dcllinger, Green,
Dean, Mallot, Burris, and Hyde
there are nine capable quarter-mil
ers, and by April, Coach Dink
should be able to press four of
them into service to jeopardize the
world mark set by the two Hables
brothers, Ben Eastman, and Maynor
Shove four years ago at 4.12;3.
