## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism Clarifying Honor Code Will Lead To Re-vitalizing a Fundamental Tradition 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils last night
began a program that will become one of the
most significant moves either group has ac
complished '.w a number of years.
On the surface, the meeting last night did
not appear to be all-important. The Councils
merely announced plans for clarifying and in
terpreting ihe Honor Code —with assistance
and suggestions from faculty and student
groups.
Hut the campaign in reality is the beginning
of a movement that will bring the Honor Code,
one of the most vital and fundamental of Stan
ford traditions, back to the place it rightfully
should hold.
In order to put the Code back on its feet, the
Councils must know exactly where they stand,
just how far the ('ode reaches and what it in
cludes. This is what the enforcement bodies
are doing as an introductory step in a drive
eventually will put the Code on a paying basis.
If an honor code is to succeed, the psychol
ogy of presenting it to the student body must
be carefully and frequently checked. That
check-up has been lacking in recent years;
consequently, the ('ode among younger Stan
ford is not as vital as it is to the old-standby
Hough.

The psychology of the Code obviously must
he to put all Stanford gentlemen and women
actually, not just theoretically, on their honor
in matters that it intends shall come under its
jurisdiction. While vagueries such as those
which now surround the Code exist, no stu
dent can he certain whether or not a given aet
would he a violation of the Code.
Everyone is agreed that flagrant cheating
in examinations is a violation of the Honor
Code. How many of them can give a categori
cal answer as to whether submitting the same
paper to two separate classes —assuming that
the paper meets the qualifications for each
class—is a violation?
The answer is, "No one." Men's and Wom
en's Councils themselves cannot answer that
question, or any number of similar ones now.
The codification and clarification will satisfy
both the Councils and the students who may
be involved on points of this nature.
From there the Councils can, and appar
ently intend to, make a direct jump to the far
more important problem of putting the Honor
Code hack into the students' minds as a living
thing, one of the few remaining traditions that
distinguishes Stanford from just any univer
sity.

ently intend to, make a direct jump to the far
more important problem of putting the Honor
Code hack into the students' minds as a living
thing, one of the few remaining traditions that
distinguishes Stanford from just any univer
sity.
Men's and Women's Councils last night
began a program that will become one of the
most significant moves either group has ac
complished '.w a number of years.
On the surface, the meeting last night did
not appear to be all-important. The Councils
merely announced plans for clarifying and in
terpreting ihe Honor Code —with assistance
and suggestions from faculty and student
groups.
Hut the campaign in reality is the beginning
of a movement that will bring the Honor Code,
one of the most vital and fundamental of Stan
ford traditions, back to the place it rightfully
should hold.
In order to put the Code back on its feet, the
Councils must know exactly where they stand,
just how far the ('ode reaches and what it in
cludes. This is what the enforcement bodies
are doing as an introductory step in a drive
eventually will put the Code on a paying basis.
If an honor code is to succeed, the psychol
ogy of presenting it to the student body must
be carefully and frequently checked. That
check-up has been lacking in recent years;
consequently, the ('ode among younger Stan
ford is not as vital as it is to the old-standby
Hough.

The psychology of the Code obviously must
he to put all Stanford gentlemen and women
actually, not just theoretically, on their honor
in matters that it intends shall come under its
jurisdiction. While vagueries such as those
which now surround the Code exist, no stu
dent can he certain whether or not a given aet
would he a violation of the Code.
Everyone is agreed that flagrant cheating
in examinations is a violation of the Honor
Code. How many of them can give a categori
cal answer as to whether submitting the same
paper to two separate classes —assuming that
the paper meets the qualifications for each
class—is a violation?
The answer is, "No one." Men's and Wom
en's Councils themselves cannot answer that
question, or any number of similar ones now.
The codification and clarification will satisfy
both the Councils and the students who may
be involved on points of this nature.
From there the Councils can, and appar
ently intend to, make a direct jump to the far
more important problem of putting the Honor
Code hack into the students' minds as a living
thing, one of the few remaining traditions that
distinguishes Stanford from just any univer
sity.
