# Gentleman's Pact Offers Possible Way Out for Farm's Muddled Rushing System
## 
### 
Interfraternity Hoard of Control's special
committee on rushing revision is back in ses
sion with instructions to revamp, its proposal
lor fall-qnarter pledging into a plan that will
stand lip under both Board and Administra- I
lion scrutiny.
The Hoard wants fall-quarter pledging; the
Administration wants the fraternities to
pledge in the spring. The clash is obvious, so
the committee might as well forget about
changing the date of pledging.
Instead, however, the committee can at
tack the,.whole set-up from a different angle.
Forgettiifg dales and concentrating on actual
rushing tactics is the only way the group can !
hope lo satisfy all interested parties.
The authorities are all agreed on two points I
that there are too many useless rules invit- j
ing violation, and that rushing should be kept
strictly on-eampus.
With these as starting points, the commit- ;
Ice can and should make a renovation that j
will fundamentally alter Stanford's rushing
system without changing the date of plcdg- ;
ing.
II is not up lo President Wilbur lo formu
late ;i plan agreeable to the houses. It is the
other way around. The fraternities know
what are the demands of Dr. Wilbur. They
now must draw up their plan to fall within
these limitations. A plan based 011 a gentle
man's agreement, for example, instead of on
100 many rules, would, by the President's own
assertion, come within the limits.
Although appearances may belie the fact,
rushing is not actually war. Therefore, there
is no reason why a group of Stanford (jcntlc
mcn cannot have an understanding or agree
ment among themselves which will put the
ban on the things that are universally con
sidered "dirty rushing."
II is easier 011 the conscience to violate a
written rule than a gentleman's agreement,
which is a matter of honor. If the fraternities
prove that they cannot abide by such mutual
agreements, then their self-proclaimed posi- !
lion as cultural and socializing institutions is

untenable, and their function is no longer of
value to a great University.
For practical purposes, there must be some
control over Frosh-How contact. The simpler
tiie control, however, the more chance it
would have of being observed. It might be a
blanket rule that 011 certain days of each week,
the houses and freshmen can have perfectly
free relations, but that 011 the remaining days
they would each slay on their own sides of the
campus.

the whole program is presented to the Hoard
in a manner that myites constructive revamp
ing of the rushing system. The Hoard's spe
cial committee apparently must forget about
changing the date of pledging; instead it can
concentrate on the more important problem
of altering rushing mores.

what are the demands of Dr. Wilbur. They
now must draw up their plan to fall within

Although appearances may belie the fact,
rushing is not actually war. Therefore, there
is no reason why a group of Stanford (jcntlc
mcn cannot have an understanding or agree
ment among themselves which will put the
ban on the things that are universally con
sidered "dirty rushing."
II is easier 011 the conscience to violate a
written rule than a gentleman's agreement,
which is a matter of honor. If the fraternities
prove that they cannot abide by such mutual
agreements, then their self-proclaimed posi- !
lion as cultural and socializing institutions is

untenable, and their function is no longer of
value to a great University.
For practical purposes, there must be some
control over Frosh-How contact. The simpler
tiie control, however, the more chance it
would have of being observed. It might be a
blanket rule that 011 certain days of each week,
the houses and freshmen can have perfectly
free relations, but that 011 the remaining days
they would each slay on their own sides of the
campus.

Interfraternity Hoard of Control's special
committee on rushing revision is back in ses

stand lip under both Board and Administra- I

The Hoard wants fall-quarter pledging; the
Administration wants the fraternities to
pledge in the spring. The clash is obvious, so
the committee might as well forget about
changing the date of pledging.
Instead, however, the committee can at
tack the,.whole set-up from a different angle.
Forgettiifg dales and concentrating on actual
rushing tactics is the only way the group can !
hope lo satisfy all interested parties.
The authorities are all agreed on two points I
that there are too many useless rules invit- j

strictly on-eampus.
With these as starting points, the commit- ;
