A certain Phi Psi who is the envy of all for his
lovely complexion, has definitely come out with the
statement that he is off'n women for life. Now this
decision, which by all odds is a most important one in
the life of any young man, is a difficult one to make,
particularly for a gentleman with a lovely complexion.
Nevertheless, this young man made the decision and
has decided to abide by it.
It all started when our dashing hero introduced his
lady friend to the high and bright lights of the city
and county of San Francisco.
The two entered a gilded cage dedicated to internal
improvements. The Phi Psi tells the story: "Now, I
didn't mind it so much when she tried to shame me
by ordering buttermilk, but when the waiter returned
and set it down in front of ME, that is too much."
Wasting time is a dreadful vice
And liquor is a curse
Procrastination is a sin
But dissipation's worse.
Guys who smoke and pet and drink
All end up in hearses
But guys who don't, end up the same
Or else by writing verses.
Curses
Nature abhors a vacuum, but that's all right, I
don't like Nature, either.
Typical of the legal mind, which has decided for
us such cases as the AAA, NRA, TVA, and XXX
Hennessey, arc the law school quips, who are spend
ing their time between classes matching pennies. Heads
I win. Tails its unconstitutional.
The height of laziness has recently been attained
by a certain gigantic Beta, who bccame so weary in his
eight o'clock class that he decided the effort of leaving
at the end of the hour would be too much, so he
sat through a 9 o'clock in the same room.
