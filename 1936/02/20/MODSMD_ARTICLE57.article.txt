## The 						Individual at the University 
### 
(From the McGill Daily)
It cannot be the aim of the University to produce
me« and women along the same lines as- a manufac
tured product is produced in the factory. On the con
trary, its purpose is to bring out the best qualities in a
student—the traits of originality, initiative, and leader
ship, which go to make up character. Years spent at
college are important in the development of characters,
and their influence cannot hut help mould the in
dividual. In most cases, too, they are determining
factors in shaping his natural abilities.
It has been the tendency of many colleges to stifle
individualism, so as to establish a so-called college
spirit. Too much stress is laid upon the attainment
of group feeling, and unconsciously individualism is
submerged. Particularly is this true of the "college
town" university, where the day is practically mapped
out for the student, and he "follows the crowd" from
morning to night. Men who seo each other from day
to day are bound to take on some common charac
teristics. But when the men in our universities begin
to lose their individual identity, and become insignifi
cant units in the undergraduate body, obviously the
universities are not serving their primary purpose.
By acting as a mere unit, all the student's orig
inality tends to become snuffed out. Initiative loses
itself behind the force of undergraduate opinion. Pre
vailing campus opinions begin to be accepted, merely
because they are the opinions of the majority, without
any logic being employed by the student. The quality
of leadership is almost non-existent.
However, individualism which is so prevalent as
to cause a lack of interest in campus activities is by
no means to be desired; yet the other extreme, where
loyalty to campus activities is made all-important is
even more pernicious. A happy medium between in
dividualism and college spirit is to be sought after,
the attainment of which will justify the college's
primary aim.
