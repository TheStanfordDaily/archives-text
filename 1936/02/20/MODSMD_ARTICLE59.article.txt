## COLLEGE CONVERSATION PIECES 
### 
The text this morning ... is
taken from the fast book of winter
quarter . . . chapter on table talk

. . . verse 1
(lunch) and 2
(dinner) ... on
which occasion
the better three
quarters of the
campus (the
males, that is)
. . . gather at two
score feeding

boards in hall . . . club . . . and
fraternity ... to defend themselves
against rear flank attacks by hashers
. . . gulp liberty steaks . . . and con
verse.

This last point—conversing—be
cause of its essential inanity is, it ;
might seem, a delicate subject to J
discuss, since some Stanford par
ents might see this piece of printing
and get suspicious about what goes
on in the minds of the heirs to the
family name. But we'll be bold
about it.

College conversation at table,
which spurts along in horse bucking
fashion, might be classified under
; these heads: this morning's ex, last
night's drunk, tonight's intramural
' game, the probable source of the
| hamburger, sex in its several vaiia
j tions, the newest shady story, the

double meanings of the cracks in
the current picture show, the infal- j
lible ability of the cook to put the
taste of crank-case oil in the dessert,
and monstrosities of prevarication.
Again we turn to the last point— :
exaggeration. We mention the rush
ing system at the table. Immediately
the transfer from New Mexico re
cites that rushing in the Southwest ;
echoes to the sound of black-jack
thumping and lariats whistling as
the freshmen get off at the college
station.

The table talk is peculiarly punc
tuated by brilliant similies and ex
clamations. When the hashers come
in with seconds, approval is ex
pressed with an enthusiastic chorus
of "Nice eye, Butch!" When things
get dull, someone will put a piece of
paper napkin on his neighbor's
head, and immediately the chant
booms out—"On to Troy!" although
nobody knows what the phrase
means.

No one should ever object to all
this, since laughter is supposed to
promote good digestion, and of
course no one could ever doubt the
laugh provoking tendencies of the
subtle, carefully planned, and bril
liant humor which is to be seen and
heard at college meals.
