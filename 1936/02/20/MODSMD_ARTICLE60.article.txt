! The Editor, Sir:
I write in reply to the Vox Campi
regarding the Honor Code which
was printed in your paper on Mon
day last. Ordinarily I do not feel
that a writer who hides behind the
cloak of anonymity warrants the
dignity of a reply, but when this
self-styled "Angry American" turns
loose his invective on the Honor
Code, he is attacking a tradition
i which many of us respect and treas
| ure here at Stanford and most cer
! tainly his challenge must be an-
I swered.
During this school year the Coun
j cil heard only three cases involv
ing violation of the Code in academic
! work.
It is certainly no pleasant task to
j sit in judgment on your fellow stu
i dents, and it has been my observa-
J tion that the Councilmen bend over
| backwards in an effort to be patient,
J courteous, conscientious, and fair.
Each of the three men referred to
1 confessed his guilt immediately, and
< since the case was disposed of I have
i personally talked with each of these
I fellows, and have found them unani
! mous in their feeling that they got
a fair deal and that student govern
ment in such cases was a triumph.
During my incumbency as chair
j man of the council I made it a point
' 1o always ask each and every fel
| low before us whether he had any

thing he wanted to say about the
ease, whether it was Honor Code or
a mere dollar fine for parking.
I want to state uneauivocally that
no "third degree method" has ever
been used on anybody since I have
been on the Men's Council or as far
as I have ever heard of by past
councils.
Could it be that this anonymous

"friend of democracy" refers to some
isolated instance where an individ
ual faculty member has taken it
upon himself to handle the case in
dependently of the Student Coun
cils? Prior to autumn finals Miss
Schaeffer, then chairman of Wom
en's Council, and I wrote personal
letters to each of the 30 department
heads of the Stanford faculty, asking
their co-operation in Code enforce

ment and particularly requesting
that they turn over all cases to the
councils, rather than handling them
themselevs. The response from all
departments, including graduate
schools, was so whole-hearted and
definite that it did much to re- em
phasize the value of faculty-student
co-operation. I cannot believe,
therefore, that "Angry American"
refers to such a case; but if so and

if he can prove his point, it is high
time that we either assure student
control or throw aside hypocrisy!
I therefore call on "Angry Amer
ican" to come out in the open with
his charges and either prove them
or withdraw them!

i personally talked with each of these
I fellows, and have found them unani
! mous in their feeling that they got
a fair deal and that student govern
ment in such cases was a triumph.
During my incumbency as chair
j man of the council I made it a point
' 1o always ask each and every fel
| low before us whether he had any

thing he wanted to say about the
ease, whether it was Honor Code or
a mere dollar fine for parking.
I want to state uneauivocally that
no "third degree method" has ever
been used on anybody since I have
been on the Men's Council or as far
as I have ever heard of by past
councils.
Could it be that this anonymous

"friend of democracy" refers to some
isolated instance where an individ
ual faculty member has taken it
upon himself to handle the case in
dependently of the Student Coun
cils? Prior to autumn finals Miss
Schaeffer, then chairman of Wom
en's Council, and I wrote personal
letters to each of the 30 department
heads of the Stanford faculty, asking
their co-operation in Code enforce

ment and particularly requesting
that they turn over all cases to the
councils, rather than handling them
themselevs. The response from all
departments, including graduate
schools, was so whole-hearted and
definite that it did much to re- em
phasize the value of faculty-student
co-operation. I cannot believe,
therefore, that "Angry American"
refers to such a case; but if so and

if he can prove his point, it is high
time that we either assure student
control or throw aside hypocrisy!
I therefore call on "Angry Amer
ican" to come out in the open with
his charges and either prove them
or withdraw them!

! The Editor, Sir:
I write in reply to the Vox Campi
regarding the Honor Code which
was printed in your paper on Mon
day last. Ordinarily I do not feel
that a writer who hides behind the
cloak of anonymity warrants the
dignity of a reply, but when this
self-styled "Angry American" turns
loose his invective on the Honor
Code, he is attacking a tradition
i which many of us respect and treas
| ure here at Stanford and most cer
! tainly his challenge must be an-
I swered.
During this school year the Coun
j cil heard only three cases involv
ing violation of the Code in academic
! work.
It is certainly no pleasant task to
j sit in judgment on your fellow stu
i dents, and it has been my observa-
J tion that the Councilmen bend over
| backwards in an effort to be patient,
J courteous, conscientious, and fair.
Each of the three men referred to
1 confessed his guilt immediately, and
< since the case was disposed of I have
i personally talked with each of these
I fellows, and have found them unani
! mous in their feeling that they got
a fair deal and that student govern
ment in such cases was a triumph.
