### 
Violinist Jascha Heifetz, who will
appear in the fourth of the Stanford

February 27, in the Stanford Pa

"There must be an independence
of treatment in the piano to offset
the violin," Heifetz explains. "I have
embodied this principle in my tran
scriptions and find that they are
liked because of this, as much as for
the manner in which I write for the
violin. Difficult for the accompanist?
Why not?"
Works of importance on the pro
gram which Heifetz, with Emanuel
Bay at the piano, will play next
Thursday are Beethoven's C Minor
Sonata, and the D Minor Concerto
of Wieniawski.

played February 20 in San Fran
cisco, February 21 in Tuscon, Ari
zona, February 24 in Carmel, and
February 25 in Los Angeles.
A request, that all lost tickets be
