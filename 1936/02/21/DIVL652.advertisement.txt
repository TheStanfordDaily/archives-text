dress of 4 0,000
American women
from New York to San Bernardino. But, of course, you have read about the
American Golfer in the smartest magazines and seen it at the smartest
clubs and resorts.
Ihe design is new—lhc high-low neck, the Pleetway sleeve, the
wedged shaped bellows pockets and shadow proof pleat, front and back in
the skirt. The standard ted bottom has been retained in the interest of less
undies and greater comfort. The fabric, the newest and loveliest of the
season, is Lorraine Madracord in gorgeous colorings. If you have ever worn
the Golfer you'll have to have the 1936 version. If you haven't had
one it's time to get acquainted.
