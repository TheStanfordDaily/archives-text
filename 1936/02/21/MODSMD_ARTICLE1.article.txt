# Report Tells Roth's Fears For Finances
## Increased Operating Expense, Inflation Prospect Present Grave Financial Problems 
### 
That prospects of further inflation
and increased operating costs of the
University resulting from possible
inflation present a serious financial
problem to the University is the
opinion of Comptroller Almon E.
Roth in the forty-fourth annual re
port of the President of the Uni
versity.
Interest Kates Fall
Decrease in interest rates through
refunding operations and the neces
sity of re-investing a considerable
portion of the University endowment
within the next five years also cre
ates a serious financial problem. Of
the $46,000,000 assets of the Univer
sity, over $8,000,000 each is invested
in railroad and public utilities bonds.
The remaining portion of the assets
are, invested in miscellaneous se
curities.
The Stanford Union shows a net
profit for the fiscal year 1935 of over
$23,000, of which $17,000 will be
given to the Memorial Theater fund.
Acting as a fairy godmother to seven
fraternities and sororities the Uni
versity loaned approximately $104,-
000 to finance reconstruction of
houses.
Less Tuitions Unpaid
Hidden in the Dean of Men's re
port is found the encouraging fact
that 101 less tuition notes were taken
out this year than last, while 202 less
notes were taken out than for the
same period two years ago.
Out of $355,009 gate receipts taken
by the BA.C. from all sports, foot
ball furnished $345,000. From the
large profits netted by the BA.C., it
paid $75,000 on the Branner Hall
debt, paying ahead the guaranteed
amount for two years. The remain
ing amount to be paid for the con
struction is still nearly $200,000.
Spring Grades Highest
In opposition to popular opinion,
the report states that the grade-point
average for the student body is
higher in the spring quarter than in
any other quarter during the year.
The all-University average for last
spring quarter was a low B minus.
The average for all women is notably
higher than the one for men. An
interesting contrast is found in that
grade - point averages of sorority
women are higher than those of
non-sorority, while hall men have
higher averages than do those in fra
ternities.
Track men have the highest grade
point average for students partici
pating in sports, while varsity foot
ball ranks third from the bottom.
Must Educate Masses
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
his report to the Board of Trustees
states that "Only by education, not
only of our youth but of our whole
population can we continue to keep
our civilization growing. . . . There
is a lack of domination by the in
to! Icctual centers or the power of
propaganda would not be as great as
it is."
