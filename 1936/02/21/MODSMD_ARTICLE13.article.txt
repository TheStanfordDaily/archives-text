"Now you scalliwags and pretty'
young things—"
Dr. David Charles Gardner, I
chaplain of the University, was in
structing the Class of '35 last June
just before entering the Chapel for
baccalaureate services.
Forget the Axe
" —remember that Aunt Lucy and
Uncle John are in there, so act as if
you'd been in the place before. And
when your piesident, Jimmy Triolo,
gets up to read the Bible passages,
for heaven's sake old dears, don't
shout "Give 'em the ax-ee-ay!"
Outwardly an exaggerated little
Englishman of the Victorian school,
Chaplain Gardner has long been the j
Stanford undergraduate's best
friend. In the 38 years that the
"Padre" has watched over his flock,
to him have come more joys, more
sorrows, more troubles, and more
genuinely good humor than any
other man in Stanford's history.
Came to Farm in 1902
It was in 1902, at Mrs. Stanford's
request, that young Charles Gard
ner brought his charming British
accent into the Stanford chapel and
into Stanford life.
California had claimed Charles i
Gardner when he was still in his
teens. England's climate didn't agree
with him. At San Mateo, where he
settled, he graduated from the
Church Divinity School of the Pa
cific, took the pulpit of an Episco
pal church in San Francisco. Bo
fore the year was up, in 1898, the
vestrymen of Palo Alto's All Saints
Church called him when their rector
died. !

Dr. Gardner made friends quick 1;,
in Palo Alio. Mrs. Stanford became
one of his closest friends, and it was
through her that he became Stan
ford's chaplain.

In the University's early days. Dr.
Gardner aided the sick, heard the
troubles of the Farm's growing stu
dent body. He was really Dean of
Men and Dean of Women, for the
deans ha;l not been added to the
administration.
After the 19f>G earthquake, Ihe en
ergetic chaplain headed student re
lief work in San Francisco. The
roughs—those wore the days of the
real "roughs"—camped out in the
smouldering, crumbling city, dis
tributed food and clothing to the

j homeless. It was during these try
ing times that Dr. Gardner became
so important a part of Stanford and
gained the life-long admiration of
i the student body.
Today Chaplain Gardner is a Stan
ford institution, a Farm tradition.
Visitors haven't really seen the
campus until they've met and talked
i with Dr. Gardner.
Boyhood in England
It was over 40 years ago that this
man left England, but his friencLs—
th )so who have known him since
the beginning of Stanford—will say
j that with the years he becomes more
and more British in his speech and
manners, yet more and more Amer
ican and modei n in his tolerance and
understanding.
No old-school pedagogue is he.
One night he broke into an Encina
crap-game, smiled, and said merely:
"Good-night, gentlemen." The next
day at (he Chapel he found a neat
little bag of dimes, nickels, and
quarters, "The boys had donated the
"pot," out of lespect," to Dr. Gard
ner's church.
Truly an experience is tea at Dr.
Gardner's, >r an old-fashioned
l English Christmas party at the Fac
ulty Club, which he arranges. Like
a bit of old England. His conversa
tion is delightful, utteily tin-clerical.
In June Dr. David Charles Gard
ner will retire to his cottage in
Carmel. Stanford will miss this
man, this mellowed mixture of Vic
torianism and modernism. Gone
from the campus will be the last
true link c,f present-day Stanford
wilh tlvr early days of the founders.

Outwardly an exaggerated little

Chaplain Gardner has long been the j

other man in Stanford's history.
Came to Farm in 1902
It was in 1902, at Mrs. Stanford's
request, that young Charles Gard
ner brought his charming British
accent into the Stanford chapel and
into Stanford life.
California had claimed Charles i
Gardner when he was still in his
teens. England's climate didn't agree
with him. At San Mateo, where he
settled, he graduated from the
Church Divinity School of the Pa

Dr. Gardner made friends quick 1;,
in Palo Alio. Mrs. Stanford became
one of his closest friends, and it was
through her that he became Stan
ford's chaplain.

In the University's early days. Dr.
Gardner aided the sick, heard the
troubles of the Farm's growing stu
dent body. He was really Dean of
Men and Dean of Women, for the
deans ha;l not been added to the
administration.
After the 19f>G earthquake, Ihe en
ergetic chaplain headed student re
lief work in San Francisco. The
roughs—those wore the days of the
real "roughs"—camped out in the
smouldering, crumbling city, dis
tributed food and clothing to the

j homeless. It was during these try
ing times that Dr. Gardner became
so important a part of Stanford and
gained the life-long admiration of
i the student body.
Today Chaplain Gardner is a Stan
ford institution, a Farm tradition.
Visitors haven't really seen the
campus until they've met and talked
i with Dr. Gardner.
Boyhood in England
It was over 40 years ago that this
man left England, but his friencLs—
th )so who have known him since
the beginning of Stanford—will say
j that with the years he becomes more
and more British in his speech and
manners, yet more and more Amer
ican and modei n in his tolerance and
understanding.
No old-school pedagogue is he.
One night he broke into an Encina
crap-game, smiled, and said merely:
"Good-night, gentlemen." The next
day at (he Chapel he found a neat
little bag of dimes, nickels, and
quarters, "The boys had donated the
"pot," out of lespect," to Dr. Gard
ner's church.

understanding.
No old-school pedagogue is he.
One night he broke into an Encina
crap-game, smiled, and said merely:
"Good-night, gentlemen." The next
day at (he Chapel he found a neat
little bag of dimes, nickels, and
quarters, "The boys had donated the
"pot," out of lespect," to Dr. Gard
ner's church.
Truly an experience is tea at Dr.
Gardner's, >r an old-fashioned
l English Christmas party at the Fac
ulty Club, which he arranges. Like
a bit of old England. His conversa
tion is delightful, utteily tin-clerical.
In June Dr. David Charles Gard
ner will retire to his cottage in
Carmel. Stanford will miss this
man, this mellowed mixture of Vic
torianism and modernism. Gone
from the campus will be the last
true link c,f present-day Stanford
wilh tlvr early days of the founders.
