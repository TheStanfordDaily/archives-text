# Indian Cage Team To Seek Title in South
## Stanford Will Try To Break Up Tie with Southern California In Conference Hoop Race 
### Roger Kimball 
Twelve Indian hoopsters, two
managers, and Coach John Bunn
spent last night on the "Lark," trav
eling to Los Angeles in quest of
something unheard-of on the Farm
—a conference title.
Indians Seek Crown
The story will probably be told
tonight and tomorrow night in two
games with the Trojans in the Audi
torium. In a position to gain a
strangle-hold on the southern divi
sion crown, Stanford seeks to break
her first place tie with U.S.C. with
the following men:
Hank Luisetti, Howell Turner,
Art Stoefen, Bob Zonne, Jack Cal
derwood, Dinty Moore, Bill Quade,
Ken Nobs, Sparky Robertson, Nellie
Heath, Ken Bell, and H. B. Lee. Ken
Steckler and Ned Topham are the
managers.
Having beaten the Trojans twice
last month m the Pavilion, the first
five named above will start tonight.
Stanford Team Ready
Bunn pronounced all 12 in good
shape to battle the Trojans, and
proved his statement by conducting
a one-hour drill yesterday. Offens
ive practice, particularly shooting,
was stressed in this last-minute ses
sion. No letdown after the team's
fine showing against U.S.F. Wednes
day night was risked.
Only Art Stoefen is not in tip-top
condition. Still recovering from an
attack of flu, the lanky center nev
ertheless cinched his place in the
starting line-up by his good work in
the Don gam 3.
Among Others
In spite of his 13 digits for high
point honors Wednesday, Robertson
has not yet replaced Zonne for Cal
derwood as regular guard. "Sparky"
is being held in reserve, and may re
peat his performance in the second
Trojan game on the Farm. On that
occasion, he sank four long shots in
the second half, aiding Luisetti on a
scoring rampage and brought the
Cards from behind to a sensational
51-47 victory.
Captain Dinty Moore, who is get
ting back into his stride, may get in
at both forward and guard before
the series is over. Bill Quade at
forward and Nellie Heath at guard
are others who will probably see
plenty of .service.
