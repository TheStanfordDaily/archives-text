# Cards Box Cal Here Tonight
## Stanford Boxers Favored To Defeat Bears in Pavilion Eleven Bouts To Be Fought 
### 
Stanford and California boxers
will trade socks for the first time
this year tonight in the Pavilion at
8 o'clock.
Last year when the Bears fought
here, they lost 8-3. Pre-game dope
has it that this history is likely to
repeat itself.
Perry Thomas, new Cal heavy, lost
his match to his Cal-Aggie foe,
whom John Fowler defeated, so it
looks like Thomas, a footballer,
might do a little tricky post-season
blocking with his midriff.
Cards Experienced
Whereas Cal has no veterans of
last year, Redskins Sims DeVeuve,
Ralph Purdy, John Fowler, and Cap
tain Dick Winzler have all had at
least one year of varsity experience.
A1 Velarde, 1935 veteran, will not
fight tonight, but will be in condi
tion to travel to the Berkeley camp
for the second engagement, March 6.
