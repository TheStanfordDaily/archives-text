# B.A.C. Sells Cal Tickets On Monday
## 
### 
Rooter's tickets for the fourth
Cal basketball game will go on
sale next Monday and Tuesday
from 9 to 5 o'clock in the B.A.C.
qftice, according to Don Lieben
dorfer, publicity director.
Admission price will be 40 cents
for rooters with student body
cards, and 75 cents for the general
public. Students will be obliged
to buy their tickets on these two
days or pay regular admission
prices.
Licbendorfcr expects that there
will be an increase over the 800
tickets sold for the last Cal game
here, when pledge night interfered
with the attendance. This is the
last scheduled game of the season
and Stanford's hopes of winning
the Coast Southern Division crown
will very likely hinge on this
contest.
