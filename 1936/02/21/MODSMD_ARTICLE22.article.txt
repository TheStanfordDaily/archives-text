TIIE TRIPLE ALLIANCE ru
mors are nothing to get excited
about. The rumblings are only a
reverberation from the antes in the
great European diplomatic poker
game.
Emotional Hitler, if he is really
contemplating the move for an al
liance with Austria and Italy, is
doing so in order to further appeal
to the German emotions and stimu
lating those emotions by placing be
fore his followers the magnificent
vision of the old 1914 empire and its
powerful allies.
CONTRARY TO POPULAR whis
pering campaigns, there is no truth
to the statements "Benito is Balmy,"
"Mussolini is Mad."
Mussolini hates, it is believed,
nothing in this world more than
Hitler and his regime. But he must
be able to see the value of being
hacked by Der Reichsfuhrer and his
troops.
AUSTRIA IS WILLING to grasp
at any straw which might establish
its economic and national security.
Hungary is wrapped up in treaties
with Italy and Austria and probably
figures, "Oh, what the hell. I might
as well go into this thing all the way
up to my neck!"
It would be easy enough for the
four nations to get together, but
even if they did, the union would be
unsteady.
DICTATORSHIPS ARE even less
reliable than kings proved them
selves to be during the war. There
might be some blood relation be
tween ruling families to bind the
ties of such an alliance as the Triple
Alliance before the Great War. But
even then the thing fell through and
Italy fought for the Allies and
against their entente comrades
Austria and Germany.
No blood alliance between dicta
tors. they are still more unreliable
because they are basically dema
gogues, and apt to face their country
in the direction coinciding with
popular opinion, and there is no
way to predict what that will be.
HITLER IS PLAYING a bluffer's
game. But any day now he may
force a showdown with League of
Nations members on the issue of an
Austro-German economic alliance.
Contemporary Austria is but a bare
remnant of what used to be Eu
rope's most colorful empire and is in
need of quick and effective economic
rehabilitation. And Germany may
be able to give Austrians just what
they need.
WALLY BROOKE has proven
himself to be an idealist and a man
ahead of his time. When a man
makes a statement 'ike the follow
ing: "The trend is away from com
mercialized intercollegiate sports,"
he states the hopes of many under
graduates, but he does not state the
truth.
Close inquiry will reveal commer
cialization of sports is at a new peak
today, and the trend, if a trend ex
ists in any direction, is,<toward fur
ther economic capitalization on
athletic meetings.
Heaven help us, Wally.
THE INTRAMURAL HOUSE plan
is a little hazy to some of us, Wally.
The idea is a good one. But facili
ties for intramural sports and actual
interest and participation in those
sports are like the chicken and the
egg. Which comes first? And which
i.- the chicl jn and which the egg?
AN OFFSHOOT of the political
Doctor Townsend's plan is a new !
idea gaining alarming momentumâ€”
"The Retire at Birth Plan." The!

Dionne quintuplets were the first to
make that idea practicable.
An offshoot of the Bonus grab
bing is the recent formation in
Alaska (of all places!) of a Veter
ans of Future Wars gang, demanding
a bonus right now, seein' as how its
members feel they will be killed in
the next war.
