# DOESN'T LIKE GRADES EITHER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. McClelland is to be com
mended for las attitude on the grade
question. I would, however, like to
point out that the success of his :
"revolution" would depend on large j
numbers of students having well- j
developed life-philosophies and
standards by which they judge their j
fictions and achievements, and upon J
their having definite purposes in
coming to college, which is not the
case at present.
It would be too easy for a student
to believe himself participating in a
progressive "contempt for grades" j
movement, when he was in reality
merely being lazy.
Even the student with definite
aims might well study matters
which at present do not interest him
on the say-so of a faculty, adviser
who has had considerable experi
ence in the field of the students' in
terests.
Contempt for grades is fine only J
when it arises from a sincere desire |
for knowledge, understanding, and j
mastery of the techniques of intel- !
ligently applying these in the . c :olis- |
tion uf problems.
