# ADMIRABLE AND IDEALISTIC

The Editor, Sir:
Bull Sessioner's idea of abolishing
grades and class average systems is j
an admirable and idealistic one. I
Nothing would be sweeter than J
blissfully sliding through college j
without a care or worry as to how
one was doing in disliked subjects.
All effort could then be concentrated
in the subjects one enjoyed. Stu- 1
dents would begin to learn things,
and the enrollment of Stanford
would be ch-inged from a group of
groaning studyers to a group of
smiling, serious knowledge-seekers.
In short, if roughs and co-eds were
interested in concentrating any
amount of effort on any favorite
subject—purely for their own en- j
lightenment—Bull Sessioner's plan i
Would be successful.
Unfortunately, however, the
great block of college students does
n't come to college to study. College
kids . . . must still be made to learn i
in the same way as in grammar
schools. Thai's why the plan
wouldn't work.
