# "BE YOURSELF"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There was a time, in the not. too
distant past, when temperamentality
was considered a mark of genius
and intellect. But apparently there
are still a few members of both the I
student body and faculty who have
n't heard that temperamental dis
plays are now relegated to the crass
and crude or slightly pathological
individual.
During my brief four-and-a-half
month sojourn on this campus, I
have had the disgusting experience
of witnessing several of these
quasi-emotional outbursts as an un
involved third party. Might I now

suggest that all such unfortunates I
forget their temperamental "status- I
quo" and act like human beings, or
putting it more bluntly, "Be Your- I
self."
Without malice,
Harold Lyons
