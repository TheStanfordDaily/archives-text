# YELLOW NEWS REEL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
An excellent example of how I
newsreels, like newspapers, can I
twist facts was furnished those
who saw both the Hearst and Fox !
newsreel versions of George Ber- |
nard Shaw's arrival in this country
recently.
Before leaving the ship Mr. Shaw 1
was asked to say a few words con
cerning the condition of our country.
In the unbiased Fox Movietone
News he said something like this:
"Why should I tell you what to do?
I was here once before and told you
what to do and you haven't done it,
and now you are in a terrible mess. !
You have a bad constitution and a
good president. The president has a
lot o!' good ideas but the bad con- |
stitution is always getting the best j
of him."
Hearst Metrotone News omitted j
the last two lines; this clever manip- !
ulation was obviously to give Ihe
atcr-goers the impression that Mr.
Shaw thought our country was in a
"terrible mess" as the result of
President Roosevelt's administra
tion. Nice work, Willie!
