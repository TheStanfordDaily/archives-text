Dear Women's Ed:
Three cheers for the inauguration
of a Women's Page in The Daily.
It's a step in the right direction.
Why doesn't the Administration
follow in The Daily's footsteps? The
"1100" need more courses for their
special benefit. And a little secreta
rial training would come in handy.
(Signed) Practical

Besides being a welcome bouquet
for the recently innovated "In View
of the Eleven Hundred," Practical's
letter reveals a definite lack in the
University. True enough, more mu
sic and art courses are necessary.
But the Administration has been
handling that by enlarging these de
partments in the last three years.
More should be forthcoming along
these lines.

Secretarial training seems to be
the real need. The majority of
women leave this University with
an education that is long on the cul
tural side, and light on the bread
winning side. A woman can't get a
job on the strength of an English
diploma alone. What the average
woman does is to take a six months'
course in the nearest business school.

A cultural education has unques
tionable long-lime value, but mean
while what the graduate needs is
the requisite training for a perma
nent job, or the stop-gap job until
marriage. There seems to be no le
gitimate reason why she can't get
both at (he same time.
