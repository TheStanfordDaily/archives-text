# Influx of "IIOO" Led to Council, Conference
## Legislative and Judicial Activities of Former Ruling Body Divided 
### 
Student government, one of Stan
ford's points of pride, is truly exem
plified in the two women's groups
which regulate the "1100."
During the reign oi the famed
"500," the organization known as the
Associated Women Students ruled
over the women of the Farm. Wom
en's Council and the group now
known as Women's Conference were
headed by the same person, who was
known as the president of A.W.S.
Separate Duties
But with the influx of women, the
duties of A.W.S. president became
so numerous that it was found nec
essary to separate the legislative and
judicial bodies, arid give each of
them a chairman. The result of this
separation was the formation of the
two organizations now known as
Women's Conference and Women's
Council.
Conference is the legislative body
of Stanford women students, com
posed of twenty-seven members, in
cluding the presidents of all wom
en's living groups, the presidents of
the graduate women and off-campus
women, and three ex-officio mem
bers—the vice-president of the stu
dent body, the chairman of Women's
Council, and a representative from
the office of the Dean of Women.
A.S.S.U. Votes Officers
Heading Conference is a chairman
elected by the student body at the
j annual May election. The office is
I held at the present time by Mcr
i cedes Bergmann. A secretary is
elected within the group twice a
year.
Women's Conference has as its
main purpose the furtherance of all
interests of women students. To
j Conference belongs the power of
| legislating social and late leave reg
| ulations. The outstanding commit
j tees are the Vocational Guidance
j Committee, headed now by Ruth
' Neupert, and the Sophomore Com
j mittee, of which Cynthia Coonley
j is chairman.
The "Supreme Court" of Stanford
women is Women's Council, which
acts as a judicial body, and inter
prets the legislation enacted by Con
ference. Pat Flavel is the newly
| elected chairman of the group. En

forcing social regulations and inves
tigating and making decisions on the
Honor Code and questionable con
duct of Stanford women are the
chief duties of Council.
Subordinate to Council are Com
mittees of Five, found in every
women's living group, which deal
with lock-outs, the terror of Stan
ford women as a whole.
Membei's of Women's Council
must have at least a junior standing,
and each member has a specific duty.
The equivalent of Women's Con
ference at Cal is the Executive Com
mittee, whose membership is deter
mined by the various activities on
that campus, as compared to living
group representation on the Farm.

Student cops at the University of
Toronto report that women are far
worse traffic offenders than men.

Heads Women's Conference
Student government, one of Stan
ford's points of pride, is truly exem
plified in the two women's groups
which regulate the "1100."
During the reign oi the famed
"500," the organization known as the
Associated Women Students ruled
over the women of the Farm. Wom
en's Council and the group now
known as Women's Conference were
headed by the same person, who was
known as the president of A.W.S.
Separate Duties
But with the influx of women, the
duties of A.W.S. president became
so numerous that it was found nec
essary to separate the legislative and
judicial bodies, arid give each of
them a chairman. The result of this
separation was the formation of the
two organizations now known as
Women's Conference and Women's
Council.
Conference is the legislative body
of Stanford women students, com
posed of twenty-seven members, in
cluding the presidents of all wom
en's living groups, the presidents of
the graduate women and off-campus
women, and three ex-officio mem
bers—the vice-president of the stu
dent body, the chairman of Women's
Council, and a representative from
the office of the Dean of Women.
A.S.S.U. Votes Officers
Heading Conference is a chairman
elected by the student body at the
j annual May election. The office is
I held at the present time by Mcr
i cedes Bergmann. A secretary is
elected within the group twice a
year.
Women's Conference has as its
main purpose the furtherance of all
interests of women students. To
j Conference belongs the power of
| legislating social and late leave reg
| ulations. The outstanding commit
j tees are the Vocational Guidance
j Committee, headed now by Ruth
' Neupert, and the Sophomore Com
j mittee, of which Cynthia Coonley
j is chairman.
The "Supreme Court" of Stanford
women is Women's Council, which
acts as a judicial body, and inter
prets the legislation enacted by Con
ference. Pat Flavel is the newly
| elected chairman of the group. En

forcing social regulations and inves
tigating and making decisions on the
Honor Code and questionable con
duct of Stanford women are the
chief duties of Council.
Subordinate to Council are Com
mittees of Five, found in every
women's living group, which deal
with lock-outs, the terror of Stan
ford women as a whole.
Membei's of Women's Council
must have at least a junior standing,
and each member has a specific duty.
