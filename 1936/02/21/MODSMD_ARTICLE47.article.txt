## SWINGING CLARINET FOR BEAR CREW 
### 
Up and down on the oily, windy |
Alameda Estuary, Ky Ebright's Cal j
crew swings nightly, feathering oars j
and stroking in preparation for i
Olympic tryouts. The rangy fellows
stroke from about 4 to 6 in the aftar- j
noon, get home when the dinner is j
cjold.
All of that, however, is just the
usual run of things. They've been j
doing that ever since Brick Morse .
first started talking about high 1
school stars going to this college or
that.
This year they're doing some
thing entirely new and different, i
Every afternoon they get out the
old gramaphone and play Benny j
Goodman records for the "swing"
dispensed by that organization.
Ebright feels that rhythm and j
swing—the rhythm of a Dixie band— i
are what's going to get him and his j
boys a free trip to Berlin.
Personally, I can't endorse this
practice very whole-heartedly.'
Playing Benny Goodman records j
merely for the enjoyment of it is |
swell—tremendous, but getting any j
extra portion of adrenalin or in
tensified muscular activity out of it j
—no, no, no.
For (he usual effect of hearing |
one of the Goodman jazz tunes,
like "King Porter," is quite differ
ent. You listen for all the tech
nically perfect parts, gently ro
tate shoulders like Helen Ward
does when she's sitting there look
ing abstractly at the people, tap
toes, wave an imaginary baton,
and indicate socks and raw rips
when the hand does.
Now maybe the Cal crewmen
aren't so affected; if they aren't
they're not quite normal.
It would make a good show I
though, to see the Bear shell streak- j
ing down the course at about a 54 i
count all together like in the first I

chorus of "King Porter," with No. 1
stroking wildly like the trumpet
taking off on the hot lick, followed
by No. 8 batting away like Benny
on ihe clarinet, with 3, 4, and 5
working behind him as a trombone
background, then the whole crew
socking the three notes in the next
to-last chorus like they do in the
record, and then on the last chorus,
on the stretch, first the starboard,
then the port, taking a healthy
swipe, alternating like the brass and
reed sections, with the shell leaving
behind a jazzed zig-zag wake.
Of course, they probably would
n't go to that extreme, but still it's
nice to think about while you're
playing "Goody Goody."

Playing Benny Goodman records j
merely for the enjoyment of it is |
swell—tremendous, but getting any j
extra portion of adrenalin or in
tensified muscular activity out of it j
—no, no, no.
For (he usual effect of hearing |
one of the Goodman jazz tunes,
like "King Porter," is quite differ
ent. You listen for all the tech
nically perfect parts, gently ro
tate shoulders like Helen Ward
does when she's sitting there look
ing abstractly at the people, tap
toes, wave an imaginary baton,
and indicate socks and raw rips
when the hand does.
Now maybe the Cal crewmen
aren't so affected; if they aren't
they're not quite normal.
It would make a good show I
though, to see the Bear shell streak- j
ing down the course at about a 54 i
count all together like in the first I

chorus of "King Porter," with No. 1
stroking wildly like the trumpet
taking off on the hot lick, followed
by No. 8 batting away like Benny
on ihe clarinet, with 3, 4, and 5
working behind him as a trombone
background, then the whole crew
socking the three notes in the next
to-last chorus like they do in the
record, and then on the last chorus,
on the stretch, first the starboard,
then the port, taking a healthy
swipe, alternating like the brass and
reed sections, with the shell leaving
behind a jazzed zig-zag wake.
Of course, they probably would
n't go to that extreme, but still it's
nice to think about while you're
playing "Goody Goody."
