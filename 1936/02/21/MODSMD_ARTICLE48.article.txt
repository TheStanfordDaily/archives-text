# CARDS IN TROYLAND; "CROOSHUL" TONITE
## 
### 
While the Cal basketball team
mid the 70,000 jeei's of the Jonah
Gym are discouraging the Ucla
hoopsters tonight and tomorrow
night, Stanford's team will be em
battling the Trojans of Troy land in
the letter's parlox*.
The four games of the week-end
may or may not shed much light
on the conference supremacy. Ei
ther Troy or Stanford may emerge
as outstanding favorite, or those tv/o
and Cal may be in a triple deadlock.
John Bunn's youthful five should
be the favorite tonight, as a result
of two decisions over S.C. a month
ago. But local sentiment is nebulous,
everywhere you'll hear that our club
is lousy, stale, no good, can't even
score half as many points as Cal.
But the John Bunn twelve is
going south bent to beat Sam
Barry's five. The Card sopho
mores, with a couple of juniors
added for experience, have made
no sophomoric vows to never lose
to the Trojans. They aren't cocky
sophomores, just three sophs plus
two steady juniors going down to
continue on their way to Olympic
tryouts. â€”Breed
