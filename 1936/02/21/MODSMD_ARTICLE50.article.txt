### 
Many Stanford alumni contribute
generously to various University |
funds, but few actually contribute
their time and services to campus
activities as do Rugby Coach Jim
Wylie '17 and his assistant, Willard
Classen, '21.
Wylie, a San Jose fruit packer by \
profession, and Classen, a San Fran
cisco consulting geologist, both '
knock off work each day at three

o'clock and start for the Farm to
direct practice at four. Both agree
that they are well compensated by
the enthusiastic turn-out for the
team and the support given them by
the players.
Rugby has held a formost place
in the life of Wylie since childhood.
He began playing in high school in
his native land, New Zealand. In 1912
he made his first visit to Stanford
as a member of the Waratahs, an
all-star Australian team for which
he was selected while he was visit
ing the Land of the Southern Cross.
A year later he again played against
Stanford and California on the re
nowned All-Black team from New
Zealand. Upon completion of the

team's tour, Wylie joined his for
mer Australian team-mate, Dan
nie Carroll, and enrolled at Stanford.
Stanford with these two crack
ruggers playing, defeated California,
26-6, in 1914. Following the match,
California officials broke off rela
tions with Stanford in rugby, charg
ing that the Indians were proselyt
ing professional ruggers. The breach
continued through 1917. In the in
tervening years Stanford played its
big game with Santa Clara.
Following his graduation from
Stanford, Wylie coached rugby a
year and then joined the Royal Ca
nadian Air Force, hut the World
War ended before he reached
France.
Classen, president of the Alumni
Association last year, played on the
freshman rugby team when Wylie
was coaching the Indian varsity.
In his senior year he went with the
Indian rugby team to British Co
lumbia. Since graduation he has
played rugby with various teams,
including the Olympic Club and the
Palo Alto All-Blacks.

Rugby has held a formost place
in the life of Wylie since childhood.
He began playing in high school in
his native land, New Zealand. In 1912
he made his first visit to Stanford
as a member of the Waratahs, an
all-star Australian team for which
he was selected while he was visit
ing the Land of the Southern Cross.
A year later he again played against
Stanford and California on the re
nowned All-Black team from New
Zealand. Upon completion of the

team's tour, Wylie joined his for
mer Australian team-mate, Dan
nie Carroll, and enrolled at Stanford.
Stanford with these two crack
ruggers playing, defeated California,
26-6, in 1914. Following the match,
California officials broke off rela
tions with Stanford in rugby, charg
ing that the Indians were proselyt
ing professional ruggers. The breach
continued through 1917. In the in
tervening years Stanford played its
big game with Santa Clara.
Following his graduation from
Stanford, Wylie coached rugby a
year and then joined the Royal Ca
nadian Air Force, hut the World
War ended before he reached
France.
Classen, president of the Alumni
Association last year, played on the
freshman rugby team when Wylie
was coaching the Indian varsity.
In his senior year he went with the
Indian rugby team to British Co
lumbia. Since graduation he has
played rugby with various teams,
including the Olympic Club and the
Palo Alto All-Blacks.
