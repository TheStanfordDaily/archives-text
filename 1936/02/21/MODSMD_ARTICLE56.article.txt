# Indians Meet U.S.F. Ball Club Here Saturday
## Moffat Field Airmen. Cards Rained Out Yesterday; Dry Field Hoped for Don Game 
### 
Old man weather sneaked over
another fust on? on the Indian ball
team when he rained out the game
with the Moffat Field Aircraft
Squadron yesterday afternoon. Bath
teams were on the field warming up
when the downpour started and
forced cancellation of the game.
Coach Harry Wolter is hoping
the weather will clear up by Sat
urday, however, when the Cards
are .slated to meet the University of
San i - 'i . ncisco Dons on the Sunken
Diamond. The game is scheduled
to begin at 2:30.
Same Lineup
Wolter is expected to use the same
lineup intended for yesterday's
game against the Bay team. Ray
Weierhausi r will start on the mound
with Glenn Hamilton and Fred
Furman ready to relieve him while
Leo Hcagerty and Mike Ferro will
probably divide the catching duties.
At first base there is a new battle
developing. Red Holman, the regu
lar, has a fight on his hands with
A1 Brent, letterman and dependable
hitter, coming up lately to threaten
Holman's job.
The rest of the infield will remain
the same: sophomore Jack Huddle
stun at second, the flashy-fielding
fleorge Farrell at shortstop, and Bill
Newsoin, the transfer from Cal at
third. 'Ihis is the set-up that Wol
ter hopes can eventually eradicate
the old bugaboo of many errors in
the infield.
Bones In Left Field
In the outer gardens, Captain
Bones Hamilton will patrol left, Ed
Clark in center, and burly Bob
Mathews in right.
So far the opening of the Confer
ence season has been discouraged
by rain. The loop was hilled to start
last Saturday, but a muddy infield
precluded that.
And now the diamond may be
wet for the game tomorrow. Until
spring vacation, then, the Cards will
tangle only with St. Mary's and San
ta Clara. During the vacation, how
ever, the Conference starts in earn
est, with games with Ucla and Troy.
