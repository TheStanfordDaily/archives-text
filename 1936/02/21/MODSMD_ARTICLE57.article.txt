## Thornton's Mermen Underdogs In Swimming Meet Tonight With San Francisco Group 
### 
Stanford tankmen meet the
Olympic Club tonight in the Club's
pool on Post Street, San Francisco,
lor the second time this season. Un
less Coach George Schroth of the
Club pulls a few of his "boners" in
getting proper men into proper
events, the Indians stand little
i hance of repeating their victory of
February 8, 47-37.
Keating Ileld from 440
Schroth threw away the meet then
when he allowed Keating to stay out
of the 440 so that he would be sure
to take the 220. Keating would have
taken at least a iirst and a second
in the two events had he swum. The
Winged O's the backstroke by
"savin;;" Champion Hargraves for
the medley relay, which they lost by
inches.
Captain Kuhn, who took a first
for the Indians in the 100, last night
suffered defeat in the Pacific Asso
ciation Championships at the hands
of the Olympic Club's Herb Brot
man. Brotman certainly should re
p< at his win in his own pool.
lioothe Favored
Tlie Indian co.ich, Nort Thornton,
allows Stanford only two events, the
400-yard free-style, which should be
won in record time, and the diving,
in which Tom Boothe is favored.
Upset victories may result in the 50
and the 100. The first event is
scheduled for 8:15 o'clock. The
meet will be free to all Stanford
students and friends of members on
both teams.
