# Papoose Cagers Meet U.S.F. Yearlings Tonight
## 
### 
Without Phil Zonne but with foot
ball star Wally DeWitt in his place
at center, Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh
basketballers will try a comeback
at the expense of the U.S.F. year
lings tomorrow night. The game is
set for 7:30 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Don Team Strong
Led by two fast, sharpshooting
forwards, the Dons will bring a
strong team to threaten a third
straight defeat for the weakened
Papooses. The entire invading quin
tet makes up in speed what it lacks
in size. }
Fortunately for Bradshaw, Jack
Kessel and "Lymie" Calkins, for
wards, and Dick Neeley and Pete
McArthur, guards, are still undam
aged. DeWitt has looked fairly good
as a second-string guard all season,
and he has the height to play cen
ter.

Although not the shot that Zonne
is near the basket, Wally has a good
eye from a medium distance. Jack
Cowan is now the first reserve
guard. Chuck Fisher and Bob
Brooke, two capable sub forwards,
may get into the game early.
Experience for DeWitt
Tomorrow's game will give De-
Witt a chance to get accustomed to
i his new post before the final and de
-1 ciding game with the Bear Cubs,
I scheduled for next Friday in the
! Pavilion.
Having suffered a broken finger
I and three cracked ribs as a result of
his collision wiih the empty bleach-
J ers Wednesday r.'ght, Phil Zonne is
j out for the rest of the season. The
hard-luck center also sustained a
foot injury, which will be X-rayed
today.
