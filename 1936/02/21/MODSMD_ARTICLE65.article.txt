## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism Fate of Both Honor Code and Fraternities May Rest with Revised Rushing System

Inter!" raternity Hoard of Control now lias |
;i chance to do more for a fundamental tra
dition than any single group has done in many
years. And in so doing, the Hoard can do more
to further tlie cause of its own particular ;
wards the 24 fraternities —than it has ever
before done.
Hy doing away with petty rules, establish- j
ing one or two blanket, easily understandable j
regulations, and putting the whole system of j
men's rushing on an honor basis, the Hoard, .
in one move, can re-establish dying confidence J
in both the Honor ('.ode and the fraternities.
To insure Ibis, but one assumption is neces- j
sary-—that the majority of Stanford men can j
be trusted under the Honor System.
Despite isolated accusations that the honor
system is not in working order these days,
Tin: Daily is convinced that neither the ('ode
nor the average Stanford gentleman has de
generated to a point where that assumption
is no longer a safe one.
Should the Hoard put rushing on an honor j
basis, and should il fail to work, of course, it i
would only serve as confirmation of these |
scattered accusations that the ('.ode is dead, j
The Hoard, and the University generally, real- !
ize that.
lint it is lime for the test before the Honor !
Code actually becomes as bad as the consistent
moaners claim it has.
New rushing plans will exclude many of
the rules now existing; what few rules there

are will be clearly understandable, will need
no interpretation, and should be well known
by both freshmen and fraternities when the
autumn scramble sets in.
II a so-called understanding among a group
of gentlemen is substituted for the list of petty
regulations, it will be classified under the
Honor Code. So important will it be that a
disregard for it may prove disastrous for the
whole Code.
However, before a house sets out on a "dirty
rushing" mission, the majority of members
must give assent. If the majority are gentle
men, as Tim: Daily contends they are, the
party will be oil.
As double protection, however, the fresh
men might be adequately instructed by spon
sors- —-before rushing begins in the rules of
the game "as it is played at Stanford"; they
might be informed that the whole system is
based on honor among gentlemen, not among
thieves, and that the houses which rush ille
gally are violating the ('.ode just as surely as
they would violate il if their members all
bought "ponies" to examinations.
In that way an honor system in rushing
could be put across. There are those who
believe a mass respect for the Honor Code
still exists at Stanford. The next rushing
season offers an opportunity for them to
prove their point. If the gentleman's agree
ment system fails, campus calamity-howlers
will have cause to reiterate their gripes.
