# Faculty Steps Down With the Common Herd
## 
### 
The cast for "Paths of Glory" contains tour
faculty members. No novelty in Stanford dra
matics is the appearance of faculty members
in dramatic productions. Still, tlie scheduling
of four at one time, even in such a large cast,
comes under the head of unusual news.
To Director John I hler, congratulations

for being able to secure the services of the
venerable Ph.D.'s. Director Uhler, who had
the practical aspects of securing satisfactory
character actors, may be unconsiously aiding
contacts of a public but informal nature be
tween the faculty and students.
With the expansion of the University, there
has been the loss of the faculty-student rela
tionship that was so vital a force in the days
of Dr. Jordan.
The stilted lecture system is a poor substi
tute for the vivid personal contact. While
profs decry the blase attitude and sophistica
tion of the average Hough, they sometimes
forget that no one has ever gone out of the
way to really inspire him to gel out of his
shell.
At Stanford there is more of the personal
touch than in some schools, due to lag of the
old institutions, and because Stanford is still
a comparatively small and compact residen
tial community.
May the signing of four profs for a Dra
matic Council play signalize the resumption
of diplomatic relations.
