## Earmarks of a Punk Professor 
### 
(From the Daily Texan)
In answer to questions published in the Texan, let
ters earmarking a "punk professor" were compiled to
make a sinister picture. Here is a punk professor.
He reads his lecture notes, or else he lectures too
fast in a sleep-conducive monotone. His enunciation
is cloudy, and he slumps down in his chair the entire
period, oblivious to the reaction of the class to his
efforts or absence of efforts.

To make matters worse, he elaborates on the ob
vious in such a manner as to make it difficult to
understand. His lectures and class recitations show a
lack of organization and planning, and he tries to im
press the class with six-syllable words that mean noth
ing to the averag« student. He hasn't enough wit to
make the most bashful country girl giggle. His stories,
if any, are pointless.
He answers questions by making the inquirer feel
like a penny waiting for change. He calls on just a
few students exclusively, if he encourages discussion
at all, and he is irked at argument or opposition.
Ho repeats a series of outlined lectures year after
year, in such a manner as to make Ihem become a pro
fessional recitation rather than an intelligent pre
sentation or interpretation of facts.

This professor engages in riding rather than in
helping poor or mediocre students, and gives the im
pression of knowing everything, when really he knows
very little about anything except the course he is
teaching.
He is so wrapped up in the writing of a book or
in personal research that he cannot find time for stu
dent conferences, and regards his teaching duties as a
bore. Consequently he does not make a telling effort
to mak his classes lively or interesting. He neglects
the teaching of his subject for its entirely.

The point is that there are some profs whose
ability to teach is not up to the standard of a great
university. While an adequate salary scale is a neces
sary prerequisite for good professors, and the univer
sity operates with too low a salary scale, it is never
theless importan l that the abilities or inabilities of
instructors and professors should be known. If we
are ever to have s high rating faculty, it is necessary*
that we be able n> distinguish the sheep from the goats
within our own lunks.
