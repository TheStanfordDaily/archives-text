# Our Hasher Sez:

### 
A ccrtain professor's wife for years has hacl a great
fondness for taking sunbaths, exceeded only by her
dislike of the fraternity boys next door. She was one
up on the fraternity for a while, because she blos
somed forth with a brand new canvas awning on the
first sunny day of the week. The fun-loving youths,
however, felt a bit avenged, when the rain started
pouring down again.

Fair weather friends.
In line with Our Hasher's policy of presenting only
Iho best and finest in news, I submit an interesting talc
of life among the sandstone ruins.
It seems that there is an all-activity man in the
sophomore class who is credited with having made the
Knob Hill first string, having been prominent in de
bating circles (he got his grade raised in several
forensic counters) and even having made Our Hasher
Sez in his freshman year.
But this gentleman and scholar, though proficient
in many things, is surprisingly weak in Spanish. The
r's and c's of this romantic tongue do not fall naturally
from his lips. So he takes tutoring in the subject.
His tutor is a warm-blooded Castilian, a romantic
figure in Stanford academic circles, and an instructor
in the Spanish department.
Now this instructor is a gallant gentleman. He
would not think of taking money for his services. No.
But it seems that a pretty wench oi our prosaic* Amer
ican culture has tantalized his eye.
So.
In return for instructions in Spanish, our Castilian
receives from the sophomore instructions in the gentle
art of American romance.
