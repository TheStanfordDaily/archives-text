# Film 'Anything Goes' Provides Tunes, Laughs
## 
### 
"ANYTHING GOES," at the Stan-
I ford Theater, though changed great
j ly in plot from the stage hit of the
I same name, manages to provide en
j tertainment as tuneful and as laugh
able as the original.
Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman,
j the latter in the role she premiered
1 in the New York stage version, suc
i cessfully croon their way through
i several of the original tunes plus
four new hits, including "Sailor Be
ware," "Stars over Shanghai,"
"Moonburn," and "My Heart and I."
Charles Ruggles as Moon Faced
Martin, public enemy No. 13, mas-
I querading as an innocent mission
ary, turns out one of his cleverest
performances. Ida Lupino, as Cros
by's inamorata, is very unimpressive.
If you like lots of song and clever
humor this is the show for you.
"MANHUNT," the second feature,
wouid have made a swell serial for
the kiddies, but it has too, too much
mellcrdrammer for one picture.
I However, the presence of Ricardo
Cortez, Chic Sale, and Margarite
Churchill help it somewhat. The
whole thing revolves around posses
and more posses plus an escaped
bank robber, Cortez, who is finally
routed by the ecentric Sale. Bui
don't worry; (his picture isn't so bad
that you should fail to see "Any
thing Goes" on its account.

politan Opera Company presents
Richard Wagner's "Die Mcistersing
cr," with Elizabeth Rethburg, so
prano, and Artur Bodansky, con
ducting. KPO and KGO.
SUNDAY: Magic Key of RCA,
with Gene Raymond, screen star;
Rudy Vallee, and his Connecticut
Yankees; description of "Battle of
! Confetti" in Rio de Janeiro, KGO.
"ANYTHING GOES," at the Stan-
I ford Theater, though changed great
j ly in plot from the stage hit of the
I same name, manages to provide en
j tertainment as tuneful and as laugh
able as the original.
Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman,
j the latter in the role she premiered
1 in the New York stage version, suc
i cessfully croon their way through
i several of the original tunes plus
four new hits, including "Sailor Be
ware," "Stars over Shanghai,"
"Moonburn," and "My Heart and I."
Charles Ruggles as Moon Faced
Martin, public enemy No. 13, mas-
I querading as an innocent mission
ary, turns out one of his cleverest
performances. Ida Lupino, as Cros
by's inamorata, is very unimpressive.
If you like lots of song and clever
humor this is the show for you.
"MANHUNT," the second feature,
wouid have made a swell serial for
the kiddies, but it has too, too much
mellcrdrammer for one picture.
I However, the presence of Ricardo
Cortez, Chic Sale, and Margarite
Churchill help it somewhat. The
whole thing revolves around posses
and more posses plus an escaped
bank robber, Cortez, who is finally
routed by the ecentric Sale. Bui
don't worry; (his picture isn't so bad
that you should fail to see "Any
thing Goes" on its account.
