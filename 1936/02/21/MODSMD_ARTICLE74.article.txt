## WHEN HAUPTMANN BURNS 
### 
Growing hourly nearer is the mo
ment when a carpenter will march
through the little green door into

Eternity. As a
New Jersey pris
on doctor signs
the death certifi
cate and report
ers dash for the
phone, the cen
tury's most hor
rible and famous
crime will be of-

ficially cancelled off society s ledger
—we say "officially" for actually

Hauptmann's death will be only a
paper profit for American justice.

That there are others whose hands
bear Lindbergh blood, that there
are figures in the case who have
marched only as shadows through
the Trenton fiasco, is so obvious a
fact as to make written mention of
it a mere echo of national convic
tion. Better documented than a
hunch is a belief that Bruno Haupt
mann is only a henchman of un
known forces who actually com
mitted murder and extortion, who
really created « national panic.

Who are these others? Officially
the New Jersey prosecution doesn't
care. They have* worked overtime to
pin a consummately clever murder,
both its preparation and execution,

on a Bronx carpenter who now can
not use his head sufficiently to
realize that squealing is his only
salvation. They have attempted to
make a superb kidnaoning. most dif
ficult of crimes, "stick" on a man
who couldn't tell a straight story
from a witness stand. They have
high pressured a man whose only
claim to requisite cleverness was
awkward silence, to complete re
sponsibility for a bcwilderingly com
plex crime.

I For his obvious part in the Lind
bergh kidnapping, Hauptmann must
certainly die. But success will not
expiate the crime in its totality. It
will not wash the stain of inefficiency
j and incompetence from American
justice.
Though Hauptmann's death cer
tificate may mark the books "case
closed" it will leave America still
wondering and still frightened in
the protection of a law that contents
j itself with paper justice.
