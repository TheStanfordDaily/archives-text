"The Royal Family" paraded last
night in the Little Theater as Sword
and Sandals brought the hectic and
upi'oarious adventures of the the
ater's premier clan to life.
Based, according to repute, on the
adventures of the family Barrymore,
"The Royal Family" shows the prima
donna antics of a group of tempera
mental theatrical folk.
Fred Clark, Phyllis Corson, Bob
Garred, Rosemary Benet, and Kay
Campbell all shared in keeping the
action rushing along at a fast pace.
Laughs were frequent as the va
rious members of the family got
themselves into one scrape after an
other. Miss Corson, always good in
"stagey" roles, was the pivot around
whom most of the action flowed.
Clark repeated his success of "The
Dark Tower" in his John Barry
more-ish part.
Others in the uniformity good cast
were Nancy Scoggins, Gordy Wil
liams, Mac Gordon, Fritzie Kolster,
Robert Kresnell, Frank O'Neill, and
Charles Corker.
Dick Dawson's direction was ex
cellent in the first two acts, but his
third act did not. ciuite sustain the
pace of the others. Still ,it was one
of the better Sword and Sandals
readings.
