## San Francisco Rainfall Nears High Mark of 1858; Streams Of San Joaquin River Rise 
### 
Most severe rains in 58 years have,
in 14 consecutive days of precipita
tion, killed seven, inundated thou
sands of California farming acres
under two to four feet of water, and
swollen streams to flood-menace
proportions.
Last night San Francisco rainfall
had reached 9.37 for the month, ap
proaching to within nearly 3 inches
of the 1858 high mark of 12.52. A
week remains in which to exceed
this record.
Many rivers and creeks, nor
mally emptying into the San
Joaquin River, backed into a 16
square-mile area of truck farms
southeast of Stockton, destroying,
vegetable fields.
Flood waters and landslides had
made unsafe or impassable many
important California auto routes, in
cluding U.S. 99, between Madera
and Stockton.

rainfall, slipped 10 feet and pre
sented the menace of an avalanche.
At 6 a.m. thousands of tons of clay
and shale slid silently down the in

nearest dwelling, whose occupants
were ordered to leave, for fear of
further avalanche.
