# Fascists Await Amba Alaji Fall
## Italy Preparing New Attack From Air; Ambassador For Britain Travels to Vienna 
### 
ROME, Feb. 23 (/P). â€” Fascists
waited impatiently tonight for the
news* of the capture of historic
Amba Alaji in a renewed drive by
the northern army in Ethiopia.
Officials confidently insisted the
push could not halt short of this
objective, the farthest point reached
by the Italian expedition of 1895-96,
which was virtually wiped out. The
expected news had not como early
tonight, however.
Plan Air Attack
Preparations were being pushed
for strenuous new aerial attacks in
Africa. Air forces there are being
unified, and a number of new planes
have been shipped to the war fronts.
Sir Eric Drummond, the British
Ambassador, meanwhile left for
Vienna, strengthening the belief in
diplomatic circles that Great Britain
is combatting the reported forma
tion of an Italo-German-Polish-
Austrian bloc, notwithstanding the
British Embassy's assurance that
Drummond went "to see a dentist."
Fascists Anxious
Usually informed sources said the
pushing of the African campaign,
as well as recent talks here with the
old central powers, reflected Fascist
apprehensions over Great Britain's
Mediterranean accord with other
sanctionist nations and the possibil
ity that sanctions will be stiffened
at Geneva.
