# Traveling Educator Calls Thinking Orthodox Here
## Professor Claims Cal Students Have Greater Interest Than Farm Men in World Affairs 
### Dave Botsford 
"Thinking at Stanford seems to be j
regimented, highly organized. While j
you students undoubtedly think, it
appears to be along orthodox lines."
This is what Dr. Maurice Ballen
ger, professor of education and com- j
parative religions ao Lucknow Chris- I
tiar. College, Lucknow, India, told '
Tht Daily yesterday.
And Dr. Ballenger knows. Since j
September this man has informally
visited Pacific Northwest and Calif
ornia colleges, living with the .men i
students themselves in dormitories
and fraternity houses.
Last week he spent in Sequoia
Hall's guest room, moved to Toyon
where he is now staying. He mixes
with the fellows, "bull sessions" with
them, and talks to different campus
groups about India, international
fellowship, and friendship.
He has just come from Berkeley,
before that from College of the Paci
fic at Stockton. At California, says
Dr. Ballenger, students have more
active interest in national and world
affairs than at Stanford, and spend
less time on the superficial, really
unimportant things in life.
"At the larger colleges, the stud
ents are freer in their opinions and
really have more opinions," says
he.
For 12 years Dr. Ballenger taught
Indians at Lucknow. He learned to
understand, and love the Indian
people. "Fellowship is the greatest
thing in life. America perhaps at
taches too much importance to what;
money can buy."
Dr. Ballenger is attempting to get
nearer to the students to determine
their ideals and principles. He is
"selling" no new doctrines. From
Stanford Wednesday night he will
travel to U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
