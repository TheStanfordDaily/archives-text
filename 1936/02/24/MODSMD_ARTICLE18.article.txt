### 
j PARIS, Feb. 23 (TP). —The Ameri
can neutrality act and the Italo-
TEthiopian war have put French mil
itary exports to work on the ques
j tion of war supplies lor the hypo
thetical "next war," it was disclosed
j today.
Under the provisions of the neu
trality act the vast raw material
market of the United States may not
be wide open to France at war as it
was between 1914 and 1918. Premier
Mussolini's worries over sanctions
on war materials have given the
French Ministry of War an example
of what to expect—"if."
"Italian tactics in Ethiopia have
little interest for us," one French
official said. "Colonial wars in Af
rica are an old, old story. But since
America's neutrality act was pro
posed Italy has become a guinea pig
in an economic experiment which
naturally interests us.
"After all we may be guinea pigs
ourselves some day."
Iron, coal, and oil are the three
war materials France is anxious to
have under her control to be ready
for "any eventuality" on the north
ern frontier.
