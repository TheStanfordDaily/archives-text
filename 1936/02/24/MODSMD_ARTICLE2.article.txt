SEATTLE, Feb. 23 (/P).—Rescue
crews, after recovering three bodies,
drove deeper into avalanche-choked
Snoqualmie Pass today in search of
others they thought might possibly
be buried beneath tons of snow. *
Menacing snow fields on sheer
pitches of the Cascade Mountains,
65 miles west of here, hung above
the workmen as they toiled with
snow plows and shovels from oppo
site ends of the barrier which spread
over half a mile of road and trapped
a score of automobiles yesterday.
Early today, the crews had cut
through a quarter of a mile of the
slide, 20 to 30 feel deep in places.
Several automobiles and trucks were
uncovered, all of them unoccupied.
