# Stanford, S.M.U. Film Added To Football Rally
## Grayson and Team To Be Honored by Student Body in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night 
### 
Stanford's football rally plans
have been enlarged to include the
showing of a complete motion pic
ture of the Indians' Rose Bowl vic
tory over Southern Methodist,
Chairman Wally Brooke announced
yesterday.
The rally will be held at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night in the As
sembly Hall. Another 15-minute
color film depicting campus life and
scenes will be co-featured with the
honoring of Bobby Grayson and
other members of the championship
1935 football squad.
Will Present Cup
A silver loving cup, presented an
nually to the Ali-American grid
captain, will be awarded Grayson
by Howard Jones, Christy Walsh,
and Pop Warner of the Ali-Ameri
can Board of Football. The cere
mony was founded by Mrs. Knute
Rockne after the death of the famed
Notre Dame coach in 1931, and was
taken over this year by Walter
Camp, Jr.
In 1940, judges will award the
cup permanently to the winner, who
has made the most outstanding suc
cess after leaving college. A new
cup will then be donated, and the
process continued.
Stars To Attend
Other features of the assembly
will include the presentation of a
large bronze plaque from the Asso
ciated Students to the three-year
football lettermen, and the awarding
of miniature gold footballs to team
members. The plaque, subsequently,
will be hung in the new theater.
In addition to the three All-Amer
ican Board representatives, a num
ber of noted sports writers and
former grid stars, including Bill
Corbus and Larry Lutz, are expected
to be present at the rally.
