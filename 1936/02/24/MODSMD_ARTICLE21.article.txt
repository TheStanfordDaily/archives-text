# Rocket Plane Called Success
## Ship Covers 250 Feet Before Crashing; Flight Proves Possibility of Mail Transportation 
### 
GREENWOOD LAKE, N.Y., Feb.
23 (/P). â€”A 12-foot rocket plane re
covered approximately 250 feet to
day in what its sponsor, Fred Kes
sler, called the first successful
flight of its kind ever made.
Spouting flames, the duralum
inum plane shot from a catapult
for a distance of 40 feet, dropped
onto the ice covered lake, and then
rose again before it "nose dived"
into a huge mound of ice and snow.
The plane, with a 15-foot wing
spread, reached a maximum altitude
of 40 feet.
In its flight the plane crossed
the state line between New York
and New Jersey. The starting
point was GO feet from the border,
on the New York side.
Aboard the plane was a packet of
6149 letters, bearing special stamps,
addressed to the postmaster of
Hewitt, N.J., just across the lake.
The craft was shot from a plat
form at a 23-degree angle.
As mechanics started the motor,
an 800-pound weight suspended
from the front end of the incline
was released, the combined action
catapulting the plane into the air.
"This is the first successful
flight of its kind ever made," Kess
ler said. "My critics would say that
it was the catapult that kept the
plane going."
"But it was shown that after it
dropped on the lake, the plane
moved away under its own power,
showing that it can fly by itself."
He said that the flight showed
the feasibility of transporting mail
by rocket plane.
