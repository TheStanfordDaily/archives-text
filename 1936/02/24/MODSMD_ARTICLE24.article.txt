# Stuart Tells Of Foreign Service
## Army and Navy Rated Second To Skillful Diplomacy As America's Chief Defense 
### 
"The foreign service, rather than
the army and navy, is in reality the
first line of defense of the United
States, because skilful diplomacy is
preventive medicine," Dr. Graham
Stuart, professor of political science,
told members of San Francisco's
Commonwealth Club Friday.
Dr. Stuart, discussing "The
American and His Government
Abroad," said that the average
American looks askance at diplo
macy because of a belief that it rep
resents secret agencies of intrigue.
"As a result, taxpayer representa
tives will sanction millions for de
fense in military and naval appro
priations but balk at mere thousands
for the prevention of war through
diplomatic action."
"An ambassador today," he said,
"is the skilled adjuster rather than
the privileged spy."
