# S. C. Split Makes Friday Cal-Card Hoop Tilt Crucial
## Luisetti Stars as Indians Defeat Trojans 46 to 42; Bear Game May Decide Conference Title 
### 
The race is still on! Indian bas
keteers defeated the Trojans, 46 to
42, Saturday at Los Angeles,
after losing Friday, 45 to 36. Cali
fornia and U.C.L.A. divided two
overtime games at Berkeley.
The scene will move to the Stan
ford Pavilion Friday night for the
final sprint. In that last furious
drive, breath-taking Indian basket
eers will do one of four things:
1. Pull ahead of both Bears
and Trojans and crack the tape
alone.
2. Defeat California, only to run
a dead heat with U.S.C.
3. Lose to tlie Bears and wind
up in a triple tie for first place.
4. Fall behind the Trojans and
tie California for second.
Not only the final "Big Series"
game with the Blue and Gold, but
also the last Bruin-Trojan battle in
the southland is necessary to un
tangle this knot. Both will be
played Friday evening.
Last week-end John Bunn's hoop
sters proved their breath-taking
qualities more than ever as they split
with the Trojans in the latter's
camp. High scorer Hank Luisetti
was largely bottled up by U.S.C.'s
Eddie Oram in the first game, as
Jack Hupp's 23-point rampage gave
Troy a 45-36 decision. Indian fol
lowers sighed heavily as champion
ship hopes dimmed.
Those sighs changed to gasps
of uncertainty, surprise, and final
ly joy as Hank, scoring 20 points
against the greatest pressure, led
his team to a sparkling victory
Saturday night. The southern di
vision crown again appeared on
the horizon as a possible reward
for the in-and-out Cards, who
were definitely in that evening.
Captain Dinty Moore, starting at
guard opposite Jack Calderwood in
that second game, provided the
needed spark. His set-up shot, an
other by Luisetti, and Art Stoefen's
rebound were the big explosions as
the Indians caught fire and ran up a
9-2 lead.
At that point Jerry Gracin, Tro
jan forward, started scoring tip
ins, and the game sec-sawed un
til the final minutes. Luisetti's
two baskets made without help,
Howell Turner's fine all-around
game, and Stoefen's beautiful re
bound work shot the Indians to
victory and a place abreast of
U.S.C. once more.

The race is still on! Indian bas
keteers defeated the Trojans, 46 to
42, Saturday at Los Angeles,
after losing Friday, 45 to 36. Cali
fornia and U.C.L.A. divided two
overtime games at Berkeley.
The scene will move to the Stan
ford Pavilion Friday night for the
final sprint. In that last furious
drive, breath-taking Indian basket
eers will do one of four things:
1. Pull ahead of both Bears
and Trojans and crack the tape
alone.
2. Defeat California, only to run
a dead heat with U.S.C.
3. Lose to tlie Bears and wind
up in a triple tie for first place.
4. Fall behind the Trojans and
tie California for second.
Not only the final "Big Series"
game with the Blue and Gold, but
also the last Bruin-Trojan battle in
the southland is necessary to un
tangle this knot. Both will be
played Friday evening.
Last week-end John Bunn's hoop
sters proved their breath-taking
qualities more than ever as they split
with the Trojans in the latter's
camp. High scorer Hank Luisetti
was largely bottled up by U.S.C.'s
Eddie Oram in the first game, as
Jack Hupp's 23-point rampage gave
Troy a 45-36 decision. Indian fol
lowers sighed heavily as champion
ship hopes dimmed.
Those sighs changed to gasps
of uncertainty, surprise, and final
ly joy as Hank, scoring 20 points
against the greatest pressure, led
his team to a sparkling victory
Saturday night. The southern di
vision crown again appeared on
the horizon as a possible reward
for the in-and-out Cards, who
were definitely in that evening.
Captain Dinty Moore, starting at
guard opposite Jack Calderwood in
that second game, provided the
needed spark. His set-up shot, an
other by Luisetti, and Art Stoefen's
rebound were the big explosions as
the Indians caught fire and ran up a
9-2 lead.
At that point Jerry Gracin, Tro
jan forward, started scoring tip

two baskets made without help,
Howell Turner's fine all-around
game, and Stoefen's beautiful re

3. Lose to tlie Bears and wind
up in a triple tie for first place.
4. Fall behind the Trojans and
tie California for second.
Not only the final "Big Series"
game with the Blue and Gold, but
also the last Bruin-Trojan battle in
the southland is necessary to un
tangle this knot. Both will be
played Friday evening.
Last week-end John Bunn's hoop
sters proved their breath-taking
qualities more than ever as they split
with the Trojans in the latter's
camp. High scorer Hank Luisetti
was largely bottled up by U.S.C.'s
Eddie Oram in the first game, as
Jack Hupp's 23-point rampage gave
Troy a 45-36 decision. Indian fol
lowers sighed heavily as champion
ship hopes dimmed.
Those sighs changed to gasps
of uncertainty, surprise, and final
ly joy as Hank, scoring 20 points
against the greatest pressure, led
his team to a sparkling victory
Saturday night. The southern di
vision crown again appeared on
the horizon as a possible reward
for the in-and-out Cards, who
were definitely in that evening.
Captain Dinty Moore, starting at
guard opposite Jack Calderwood in
that second game, provided the
needed spark. His set-up shot, an
other by Luisetti, and Art Stoefen's
rebound were the big explosions as
the Indians caught fire and ran up a
9-2 lead.
At that point Jerry Gracin, Tro
jan forward, started scoring tip
ins, and the game sec-sawed un
til the final minutes. Luisetti's
two baskets made without help,
Howell Turner's fine all-around
game, and Stoefen's beautiful re
bound work shot the Indians to
victory and a place abreast of
U.S.C. once more.
