AAA'S SUBSTITUTE, which
should become a law this week on
receiving the President's signature,
is a soil conservation bill whose
purpose is to promote the conserva
tion and profitable use of agricul
tural land resources by federal aid
to farmers and to states.
It promotes soil conservation by
offering federal cash bounties to
farmers who comply with the
wishes of the Secretary of Agri
culture in using their land—retir
ing some crop land to be planted
with soil-enriching legumes and
grasses, or changing crops in other
lands.
THE $500,000,000 per year plan
wi'l apply to this year's crops. Its
objective—control of farm produc
tion so as to raise farm prices and
the farmers' purchasing power—will
be attained by ambitious efforts on
the part of the Secretary of Agri
culture's planning of the nation's
crops so that the amount produced
will meet the consumer's demand at
prices scheduled to be fair to the
producer and the consumer.
DIFFERING FROM AAA in that
the Secretary of Agriculture does
not make written contracts with
the farmer, such an arrangement
having been declared unconstitu
tional by the Supreme Court, THE
SUBSTITUTE provides for some
sort of mental telepathy between the
farmers and the Department of Ag
riculture, a sort of Gentlemen's
Agreement.
THE PROGRAM is to last until
the first of December, 1937. In the
meantime, the states will be en
couraged by the Federal Govern
ment to set up farm aid schemes of
their own with federal grants of
money to sustain their schemes.
REPUBLICANS CALL the new
legislation a "stop-gap" scheme
whereby the farmers will continue
to receive checks until after the
election this November. GOPartisans
brand the arrangement as uncon
stitutional, also.
Democrats and New Dealers claim
the law to be an "even better" plan
than the AAA and aver that the
legislation is further proof that the
administration is serious and un
swerving in its efforts to aid the
farmer.
ONE THING is true, no matter
what partisans claim, and that is:
the farmer is getting a lot of atten
tion today xinder a Democratic ad
ministration; attention, the like of
which, has never before been lav
ished cn him. Republicans have al
ways been notorious for their fail
ure to aid the farmer despite all
sorts of promises. Whether Demo
crats today are giving the agricul
turist aid legally or illegally, the fact
remains that they are, at least, try
ing to help him.
THE FARMER is coming in for
a lot of attention from the Hearst
papers, also. Pie is pictured by Pow
ers, ace Hearst cartoonist, as being
clothed in spanking clean overalls,
the pockets of which are stuffed
with dollar bills, lighting his corn
cob pipe with a burning government
check. Industry is represented by
the artist as an emaciated beggar
looking on — helpless and poverty
stricken, envious ol the prosperous
farmer.
What a shame!

Democrats and New Dealers claim
the law to be an "even better" plan
than the AAA and aver that the

administration is serious and un
swerving in its efforts to aid the

ONE THING is true, no matter
what partisans claim, and that is:
the farmer is getting a lot of atten

ministration; attention, the like of
which, has never before been lav

ways been notorious for their fail
ure to aid the farmer despite all
sorts of promises. Whether Demo
crats today are giving the agricul
turist aid legally or illegally, the fact
remains that they are, at least, try
ing to help him.
THE FARMER is coming in for
a lot of attention from the Hearst
papers, also. Pie is pictured by Pow

clothed in spanking clean overalls,
the pockets of which are stuffed
with dollar bills, lighting his corn
cob pipe with a burning government

AAA'S SUBSTITUTE, which
should become a law this week on
receiving the President's signature,
is a soil conservation bill whose
purpose is to promote the conserva
tion and profitable use of agricul
tural land resources by federal aid
to farmers and to states.
It promotes soil conservation by
offering federal cash bounties to
farmers who comply with the
wishes of the Secretary of Agri
culture in using their land—retir
ing some crop land to be planted
with soil-enriching legumes and
grasses, or changing crops in other
lands.
THE $500,000,000 per year plan
wi'l apply to this year's crops. Its
objective—control of farm produc
tion so as to raise farm prices and
the farmers' purchasing power—will
be attained by ambitious efforts on
the part of the Secretary of Agri
culture's planning of the nation's
crops so that the amount produced
will meet the consumer's demand at
prices scheduled to be fair to the
producer and the consumer.
DIFFERING FROM AAA in that
the Secretary of Agriculture does
not make written contracts with
the farmer, such an arrangement
having been declared unconstitu
tional by the Supreme Court, THE
SUBSTITUTE provides for some
sort of mental telepathy between the
farmers and the Department of Ag
riculture, a sort of Gentlemen's
Agreement.
THE PROGRAM is to last until
the first of December, 1937. In the
meantime, the states will be en
couraged by the Federal Govern
ment to set up farm aid schemes of
their own with federal grants of
money to sustain their schemes.
REPUBLICANS CALL the new
legislation a "stop-gap" scheme
whereby the farmers will continue
to receive checks until after the
election this November. GOPartisans
brand the arrangement as uncon
stitutional, also.
Democrats and New Dealers claim
the law to be an "even better" plan
