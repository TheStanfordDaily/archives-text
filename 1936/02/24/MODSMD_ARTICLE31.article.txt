Two new attacks were leveled at i
the Townsend plan today on the eve
of the first meeting oi' a bi-partisan j
congressional committee directed to !
investigate old age pension move- j
ments.
The American Liberty League '
said, "No more cruel hoax ever was '
perpetrated upon a trusting people"
than the proposal for a transaction
tax to pay oid people $200 a month,
and added: "The Townsend plan is
a token of a state of public mind j
created by the New Deal's dazzling |
promises of the more abundant life." I
A statement signed by 77 mem- j
bers of the economists national com- i

economic condition and a higher j
standard of living."
