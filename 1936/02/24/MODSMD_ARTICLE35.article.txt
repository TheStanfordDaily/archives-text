# New Intramural House Approved by Myers
## Manager Sanctions Building Of Equipment Unit with Profits From 1936 Rose Bowl Game 
### 
Enthusiastic approval of Student
Body President Wally Brooke's pro
posal for the expenditure of Rose
Bowl profits on the intramural pro
gram came from Intramural Man
ager Giff Myers.
Brooke advocated the erection of
j an Intramural House to be operated
| in connection with Encina Gymna
i sium for the housing of intramural
equipment, offices of managers, and
possibly a basketball unit.
"I feel that such an expenditure
! would be worth while," Myers said,
"especially so, since such a large
| number of students participate in
| intramural activities." He pointed
out that at present the program is
I hampered by insufficient equip
ment and the lack of adequate head
quarters.
Harry Wolter, faculty director of
intramural activities, was reluctant
to express a view upon the proposal
without studying the extent of use
fulness of such a unit and how much
it would cost.
Last year over 1100 men took part
in the various sports, making the
intramural program the largest
single Stanford extra-curricular ac
j tivity.
The present University budget
j calls for about $500 a year to be

expended upon intramural activi
[ ties. From this fund equipment and
awrxds for the winning organiza
j tions in each sport must be pur
chased.
Brooke's proposal was the out
growth of a study of similiar pro
grams at other universities where
less interest is shown than at Stan
ford, yet better lacilities are pro
| vided.
