Bing Crosby, Kathleen Norris, and
Frederic March join the host of
luminaries contributing to the "Big
Shot" number of Stanford Chapar

Crooner Crosby, an ardent Stan
ford rooter, according to the Old
Boy, offers a ditty on the Rose Bowl
game into which he has put the
Bing personality up to the hilt.
Kathleen Norris puts her famous
wit to work in ' Detail: Rummage
Sale," which is guaranteed to tickle
| the funnybone.
"Mystery man Frederic March's
{ article to Chappy will be kept a
mystery," averred the Old Boy as he
ran around the shack rapidly cross
