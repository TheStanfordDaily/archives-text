# Heifetz Will Play Here Next Thursday
## Noted Violinist Declares Liking For Modern Music; Indicates Interest in Musicians' Aid 
### 
Unlike the popular conception of
a classical artist, Juscha Heifitz, re- i
nov/ned violinist who will play in
the Pavilion Thursday evening, de
clares that he likes modern music.
"It makes the classics sound
fresher," he sa.vs. There is really
no such thing as ''highbrow mu
sic."
Heifetz is interested in a "national i
recovery act for musicians." Some- |
thing should be dune to help young j
artists, he says, since genius usually |
springs from poverty rather than;
from wealth.
"Alter all, the artists of a coun
try are the best ambassadors of good
will, bringing honor and credit to j
the nation they represent."
Not only a brilliant performer,
Heifetz is also a gifted composer. :
He has never revealed his original
works, but his transcriptions for
violin ami piano are familiar items j
on his concert programs.
Tickets for his coming concert at
Stanford are obtainable at Keeble's
ir> Palo Alto, or at the concert office j
in the Old Union.
