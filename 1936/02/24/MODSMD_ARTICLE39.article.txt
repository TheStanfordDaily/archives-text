# Gymnasts Needed For Tumbling Team
## 
### 
Tumblers and gymnasts, of any
and all kinds, are wanted for gym
team tryouts. The meet with Cal
is billed for March 6, and managers
and coaches are decrying a lack of
material to represent the Farm.
Rope-climbers and bar or ring
men are especially in demand. As
pirants should see George Peavy
or Myron Sprague in the gym as soon
as possible.
The Japanese government re
cently sold 10,000,000 bushels of rice.
