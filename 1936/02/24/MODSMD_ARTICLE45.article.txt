# Tankmen Lose To Winged '0'
## Boothe Takes Diving for Single Stanford First; Olympic Club Marks Up 57 to 27 Victory 
### 
Tom Boothe, Stanford's ace diver,
came through with the only Cardinal
win last Friday when the varsity
swimmers lost to the Olympic Club
in San Francisco by a 57-27 score.
Thus the Winged O's evened up the
47-37 defeat Stanford gave them
three weeks ago.
On the 400 yard free-style relay,
considered one of Stanford's "sure"
wins, the Clubmen won by the very
slim margin of inches. They took
also the medley relay event as a
result of an amazing sprint by Henry
Johnson.
