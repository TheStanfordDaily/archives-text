ASPIRIN. HEADACHES
FOR FANS SATURDAY

There was a general call for as
pirin Saturday morning.
Stanford's athletes were doing
none too well to start out the busy
traveling week-end.
Reading the sport page in bed
Saturday forenoon we got a worse
headache reading:
That "Trojans Wallop Stanford,
15-3K," USCaptain Jack Hupp
flipping in 10 field goals for 2.1
points.
That "Bears Defeat U.C.L.A., 34-
32," indicating that Troy and Ber
keley were topping Palo Alto for the
while.
That Stanford swimmers drowned
up in the city, engulfed by a sur
prise 57-27 "sweet revenge" inun
dation by Olympic Club mermen.
That a terrific gale lashed the
coastcrly Pebble Beach golfing
course to dampen the favored
tanford hopes in the Coast Intcr
follcgiatcs, with Hon Edwards
carding a low medal at S3 (!),
Bob Thompson at !M, and IMoe
Erskine eliminated.
That favored Stanford boxers
were given a terrific scare until
Long John Fowler left-jabbed Cal's
halfback, Perry Thomas, often
enough to give us a U-5 margin.
That Discovery was still consid
( red practically a cinch to pay on
the nose. Our fond hopes for
Sprinter Rosemont to clip under the
wii" with those 22-1 odds were
pretty low.
The grey and sloppy Saturday
passed < a.sily, and then there was a
wet Saturday uii»ht, and soon the
a.m. papers.
And 10. the sun appeared on the
Farm, and there was great re
joicing, and bustling among the
corncribs and u hooping behind
the haystacks, and we all said
that Stanford athletes were pretty
eke!) notvi it branding.
For Sunday's mammoth sports
pages were a glowing green to these
happy items:
Stanford defeated Troy to re
main in the hoop race. S.('.
couldn't have repeated — that
wouldn't have been cricket.
Stanford ruggers wapped Ucla
mightily, 30-8.
Stanford's Bob Thompson came
'hrougli swell in his match play, and

was facing Mat Palacio for the In- ;
| tercollegiate title.
Stanford's schoolmaster, Norm
Bright, said, "Berlin, here I come" j
with a new indoor 5000-meter
record in the New York A.A.U.
indoors.
Stanford's deadly arch-rival,
California, was blasted by battling
Bruin bombarders.
Stanford's No. 1 hashboy and ten
nis man, Ben Dey, extended the
i Davis cup star, Don Budge, in the
| only match played.
So everybody enjoyed his or her
i chicken, peas, and mashed potatoes
! for lunch, and mo!-l of the traveling
j athletes are due to arrive home
some time before house meetings
| tonight.
John Drofnats, who's been fol
lowing the horses for years (no
lie) is mad today. The wizened
| seer came into the Daily office
Thursday night and wanted to
publish hi* choices for the handi
cap. But the editor said no. And
Droft is sore because here's how
he picked 'em Thursday: Top Row,
Time Supply, and Roscmont, with
Azucar and Discovery close.
