### 
Bob Thompson, varsity golfer,
yesterday won the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Golf Championship at
Pebble Beach after three days of
touring a soggy oceanside course,

defeating Mat Palaeio of U.S.F.,
a well known Bay linksman, on
the 37th hole of the finals of a
bitterly contested match.

finals, after a wobbly 91 on his qual
ifying round, by trimming Don Nit
tinger of U.S.C., the defending titl
ist, on Saturday, and his team
mate, Moe Erskine, Friday after
noon.
Don Edwards, retiring president
of the Intercollegiate Golf Associa
tion, and number one Stanford golf
er, was eliminated in the biggest
surprise of the week-end by Pala
cio Saturday when he faltered on
the 2t.sl hol,e.
The other two Cards in the
championship flight, Jim Dillon
and Kim Bannister, were beaten
before the quarter finals, but both
showed class in carding an NX and
X(> respectively on the windy,
slushy course.
In the second flight, two Cardinals,
Bill C(.lm and Royal McCarthy,
fought for consolation title, Mc-
Carthy finally taking the match.
For the frosh, Cal Manning and
Walter Fitch were outstanding, tak
ing first and second in the fresh
man division, while Bob Bingham
placed well up.
