# Gordy's New Car Here; Warning: It's All Broken In
## 
### 
"The boys needn't try to give
me the slip. My new tar's all
broken in."
Thus Campus Officer Gordy
Davis warns anyone who might
try to take advantage of the "new
ness" of his new car—a '35 Ford
coupe. Trimmed in the
white and black, Gordy's new
buggy was delivered to him Fri
day night, replacing the familiar
old roadster of past years.
Gordy hasn't opened it up yet,
so he doesn't know how fast it will
go. But it will go plenty fast, lie
thinks. And it has the same sweet
voiced siren that has greeted the
ears of offending Roughs in times
past.
