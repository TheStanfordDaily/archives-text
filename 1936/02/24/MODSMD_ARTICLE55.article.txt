"Children have always been prejudiced in
favor of war by toys and books. The whole
school system has been one in which the
study of war has had an altogether too great
importance given it. Teach the child that
other acts than those done in war may be
acts of heroism. For, if the cause of peace
is to triumph, we must make not only a di
rect attack on war by appealing to the adult,
but also a Hank attack, through appeal to
the minds of children."
Lovely thoughts. Clip them out, and hand
them in to the Eddie Cantor or the Nation -
Foreign Policy peace contests. They might
>vin a prize. And where did they come from?
A speech of a Stanford student that won the
sfd) Edward Berwick Peace Prize on January
20, 1915, in the Chapel, according to Daily
iiles.
Nineteen fifteen was two years before the
United Stales entered the War, and a year
before a good many Stanford students were
born. Those students have been educated in
our schools, they have played with the toy
soldiers, and have the advantage of being able
to look back on the futility of a recent war.
And now, today, February 24, 19.'1(>, they
can read in the papers, if they get up in time
to eat their snail and cup of codec before their
<N o'clocks, that Europe is in a fever-heat of
war preparation. German soldiers overran

the "peaceful" playing fields of Ciarmisch Par
tenkirchen, Italians have learned to hate black
savages in Africa, and white savages in France
and England, Russia and Japan are having
their current stomach aches in Manchuria.
The scholars who have studied the situa
tion and seem to know, say that war in Europe
is not imminent, because the trouble makers
aren't quite ready yet, and the sides aren't
lined up.
Certain it is that those powers who have
been frustrated economically and politically
since the last war will either work out their
salvation over the council table or resort to
force when they feel powerful enough.
Hut how about our peace contests? We've
had lots of them since 191"). They didn't save
us then, but we have had 20 years of enlight
enment and education. The intelligentsia, if
there are any, have found out that peace is
desirable. Hut during the wartime, the intel
ligentsia will be cooling their heels in jail, or
hypocritically and heroically dying for mag
nificent slogans and catch words they know
to be false.
The Rough is probably right after all. If
war comes, he will be in the front line trenches
with his bread and his cup of coffee before
his eight o'clock. What he has to say about
it then will have no more effect than what he
says about it now.
