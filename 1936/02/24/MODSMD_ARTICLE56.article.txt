For the first lime in 1"> years Stanford has
a chance to win a basketball championship.
That chance hinges on Friday night's game
with California.
A basketball championship for Stanford
may not alTect the price of succotash in Hobo
ken, but to campus undergraduates a hoop
crown is a very dear commodity.
Since the middle of the season, our travel
ing basketeers have been working their way
through all the colleges of the Southern Divi
sion, facing hostile crowds and treading for
eign courts. It is not surprising that the cos
mic urge seemingly has been lacking, and the
sporting sections have been able to pass glib
remarks the mornings after.
For their championship Armageddon here,
the transients should have the stimulus that
a rally can bring, a feeling of the personal
tie-in between the squad and the student body.
Directly up to the adrenalin squad—the
Rally Committee and the Cardinals—is the
task ot interviewing Coach John Bunn upon
his return from the southern wars, and de
ciding upon a suitable day and hour for the
incitement of a basketball rally.
Let there be some mob psychology to aid
the coach and the team in their uphill attack
against the lynx-eyed, jinx-eyed Hears.
Stanford may be a wicked institution. Still
most people do not think so.— S.F. Chroniclc
