We have all heard during the current campus
opinion spasm of the dying out of Stanford tradi
tions, but last week was the first time I have ever
come across the news that a Stanford tradition almost
died out as the result of an automobile wreck.
This Stanford tradition in question is a philosophy
major and is without dispute the number one cam
pus funnyman. For years he has been rolling them
in the aisles at Gaieties and musicals. No Big Game
is complete without him. He has been here almost
as long as the Palo Alto tree; Ned, the cross-eyed
janitor; Jeremy F. Wong, and Gordon Heche, and he
probably will continue to be here unless he accidentally
takes the required units and graduates.
Whenever the dogs of the law catch anyone skid
ding his car on the women's hockey field, uprooting
trees along Palm Drive, or throwing wild bacchanals
in the Stanford suburbs, and the little ditty about A
Certain Student appears in the honored spot in front
of the Ad Building, the eye-brows are immediately
raised in the direction of a certain student.
So you can see why it is important for the preserva
tion of college youth, that this one Stanford tradition
does not die out, even in an automobile wreck.
The facts behind the smash-up serve to illustrate
why he is campus funnyman number one. A Certain
Student does things on a heroic scale, that only a super
man can conceive.
This heroic scale was almost too much even for him
on his last flight, though, because the wreck left
him with only a few parts still working, and those
parts bandaged to boot.
The cause for the wreck, strange as it might seem
to this calloused generation, was romance. It all
started out when A Certain Student began dating
A Certain Sophomore woman. Things were beautiful
for a while. But then, A Certain Student remembered
about a book he had read, and he proceeded to tell
the sophomore that he did not love her, that she had
no personality, that there were lots better gals on the
campus, and the only reason he went out with her
was for fun.
A Certain Student didn't realize that he had made
an unforgivable social fault until he got back to his
book, read the next chapter, and decided he had made
a mistake.
He returned to the house of the sophomore woman
!o get reinstated, and was shown the way to go home.
Ibis went on for several days. On his last attempt he
.said in a loud voice that to prove his love he was
willing to die for her. There came a loud rasping noise
from the balcony that sounded like "give him the
ux-e-ay."
So he hopped into his super, cut-down racer, gun
ned it up to full speed ahead, flicked a cigarette ash
off his sleeve, hummed a merry tune, and let go of
the wheel. A tree at the side of the road reached out
and slapped him down.

The facts behind the smash-up serve to illustrate
why he is campus funnyman number one. A Certain
Student does things on a heroic scale, that only a super
man can conceive.
This heroic scale was almost too much even for him
on his last flight, though, because the wreck left
him with only a few parts still working, and those
parts bandaged to boot.
The cause for the wreck, strange as it might seem
to this calloused generation, was romance. It all
started out when A Certain Student began dating
A Certain Sophomore woman. Things were beautiful
for a while. But then, A Certain Student remembered
about a book he had read, and he proceeded to tell
the sophomore that he did not love her, that she had
no personality, that there were lots better gals on the
campus, and the only reason he went out with her
was for fun.
A Certain Student didn't realize that he had made
an unforgivable social fault until he got back to his
book, read the next chapter, and decided he had made
a mistake.
He returned to the house of the sophomore woman
!o get reinstated, and was shown the way to go home.
Ibis went on for several days. On his last attempt he
.said in a loud voice that to prove his love he was
willing to die for her. There came a loud rasping noise
from the balcony that sounded like "give him the
ux-e-ay."
So he hopped into his super, cut-down racer, gun
ned it up to full speed ahead, flicked a cigarette ash
off his sleeve, hummed a merry tune, and let go of
the wheel. A tree at the side of the road reached out
and slapped him down.
We have all heard during the current campus
opinion spasm of the dying out of Stanford tradi
tions, but last week was the first time I have ever
come across the news that a Stanford tradition almost
died out as the result of an automobile wreck.
This Stanford tradition in question is a philosophy
major and is without dispute the number one cam
pus funnyman. For years he has been rolling them
in the aisles at Gaieties and musicals. No Big Game
is complete without him. He has been here almost
as long as the Palo Alto tree; Ned, the cross-eyed
janitor; Jeremy F. Wong, and Gordon Heche, and he
probably will continue to be here unless he accidentally
takes the required units and graduates.
Whenever the dogs of the law catch anyone skid
ding his car on the women's hockey field, uprooting
trees along Palm Drive, or throwing wild bacchanals
in the Stanford suburbs, and the little ditty about A
Certain Student appears in the honored spot in front
of the Ad Building, the eye-brows are immediately
raised in the direction of a certain student.
So you can see why it is important for the preserva
tion of college youth, that this one Stanford tradition
does not die out, even in an automobile wreck.
