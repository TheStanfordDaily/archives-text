(From The Columbia Spectator)
Mr. Eddie Cantor, of the movies and the radio and
the goo-goo-googly eyes, announced last month the
opening of what he quaintly described as a "peace
contest."
For the best 500-word answer to the question,
"How Can America Stay Out of War?" somebody, he
disclosed, was going to win a $5,000 trust fund for
tuition and living .expenses during four years at an
American college or university.
The judges were to be presidents Hutchins of the
University of Chicago, Wilbur of Stanford. MacCrack
en of Vassar, and that illustrious pacifist, Frederick B.
Robinson of the College of the City of New York.

One of America's foremost comedians was placing
his humble offering on the altar of universal fellow
ship. The American people caught a glimpse of a
Keen Sense of Social Responsibility shining through
the comic facade.
It was all too noble for words.
It was all too noble to be bona fide.
Shortly after the announcement was made, Eman
uel Eisenberg of New Theater Magazine managed to
arrange an interview with Mr. Cantor at which sub
stantially the following conversation transpired:
Mr. Eisenberg: Who suggested the idea of the
Peace Contest?
Mr. Cantor: Newton D. Baker.
Mr. Eisenberg: Do you expect any helpful ideas to
come out of it? Do you think it will help to keep the
United States out of war?
Mr. Cantor: The United States get into a war?
Don't be silly.
Mr. Eisenberg: How do YOU think America can
stay out of war?
Mr. Cantor: By arming to the teeth.
Mr. Eisenberg: Then what do you think'll be the
value of the contest?
Mr. Cantor: To send some kid through college. I
always wanted to do that. You see, I never had the
advantage of an education myself.
