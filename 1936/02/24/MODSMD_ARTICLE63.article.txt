# L.A. POLICE ON SPOT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Theodore Dreiser once described
the police of this country as the
hired mercenaries of the lords of
capital. Previously I considered this
a rather jaundiced view but recent
events in California have made me
wonder. In order to enter this state
an American citizen must first satis
fy police officers of Los Angeles that
the taxpayers of that town would
have no objection to his entering
the state.
Whether or not he gets in seems
to depend upon the impression of
material prosperity that he can give
and on the intelligence of an L.A.
cop; only too frequently both are
absent and a fellow citizen is rob
bed of what is surely his inalienable
right, namely, to travel in the coun
try of his birth.
The most remarkable part of this
rt cent piece of presumptiousness on
the part of Los Angeles is that its
police are acting on exhortation from
the Chamber of Commerce and not
on the orders of the City Council,
which happens to be divided on the
issue. What has "Ed" or "Bull Ses
sioner" to say about the situation?
