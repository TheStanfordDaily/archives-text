# GRADES INEVITABLE?

j The Editor, Sir:
Bull Sessioner John McClelland
i has reopened a long-debated ques- ,
tion with an interesting analogy be- |
tween grades and money.
As a reader and a student, I am
not unaware of the weaknesses and )
inconsistencies of the grading sys- j
; tem. Had I the opportunity of ere- ;
ating my ideal Utopian society there i
j would be no nasty grades to dampen
Imy wobbly Willie's week-end.
Neither would there be any possi-
I bility of unemployment or war or
| sickness.
The point is that we live in a
! competitive society full of harsh
| realities, silly inconsistencies, out
; worn hangovers, and false stand
ards. A university without some of
them would be poor preparation for
later adjustments.
