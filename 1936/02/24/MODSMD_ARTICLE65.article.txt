# GHOST FROM AN HONOR CODE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Thursday's Vox Campi and Fri
day's major editorial hit the spot, ;
the spot that, like nationalism, ral
tie all worshipers of Stanford tra
dition to its defense. They suc
ceeded nobly, and why shouldn't
they? For the defense of an ideal
to which I refer is an Honor Code; I
j Stanford's realization of this ideal is
at best a ghost.
Have you ever noticed on exam
ination papers, "Occupy alternate |
seats where possible?" Have you j
ever received a test marked "Odd
seats'' or "Even seats"? Or have you
| ever seen anyone smoking during
j examinations? What caused the
I disappearance of the magazine
j racks in the Union? Why are fra- \
ternities and sororities dinged? And
why cannot make-up tests be made
j up at one's leisure?
Only one legitimate conclusion can
be drawn in the face of these facts. [
I Stanford has never had more than a
ghost of an Honor Code, and even
] that is constantly violated. Let's
! quit kidding ourselves; we've got to
| have the whole hog or none!
