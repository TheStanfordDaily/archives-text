"The Milky Way," or the rise of
the fighting milkman, is a good pic
ture. Here is the same old Harold
Lloyd, but with better support. The

humor is constant,
sometimes uproar
ious, always fast j
moving. Although it
is a family picture,
the unsophisticated
laughs should be

enjoyable even to blase roughs.
Adolph Menjou is fine as the hard
boiled manager. Good shot — the
"set-up," whom Lloyd is to knock
out, taking one look at Lloyd, say
ing: "Do I have to lose to him?
It doesn't seem right."
"Two in the Dark," companion
feature, is enigmatic. Its unfath
omableness is its only recommenda- 1
tion, and as an absorbing mystery it
will be interesting. —Keating
