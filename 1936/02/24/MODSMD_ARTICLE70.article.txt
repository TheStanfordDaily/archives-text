# Bull Session
## LOVING HANDS AT HOME 
### 
"You," announced the managing!
editor, "had better write a Bull Ses- j
sion." So we hurried through Sun- |

1 day's breakfast, it
i then being only
1:30 p.m., and
staggered back to
j the campus after
; a week spent do
ing one thing well
—recovering.
Better than the
Rest Home, bet-

I ter'than the hospital, better than the
I furnished room, Eeon 55, top-row,
better even than the probing med
icos of the B.A.C. is your own bed.
Beatifying is that delicious process
of being fed grapefruit juice fresh
from a reliable refrigerator, having
i people worry about drafts, being
fed "berled ergs" and dry toast
without having to bellow specifica
tions at the waiter.
* * *
But best of all is that polite war
: fare between bedside radio and the
eloquently silent demand of the
| textbook, with your conscience as
j the brow-beaten umpire. And su
perb is the triumph of beating the
radio and the book with two hours
| studying per day, two tranquil
| hours that make even professorial
English comprehensible.

More than a revived faith in one's :
own ability to learn, they bring the 1
realization that, together with sleep, i
study is the other impossible activ- L
ity of the Stanfordite-on-campus. J
And with that realization comes the j
lurking suspicion that easily half.
our college life is deplorably mis- j
spent; that in the scramble up the i
ladder of campus prominence, even
in the exhausting climb to a mere I
place in the college picture, we are :
living at a loss.
♦ * *
Because the voice of the thinker ;
is a soft one, though beautiful, it is |
drowned out by the jazzy line of ,
"college life," a lingo of deceptive j
value. It takes a short while spent j
solely with the books to find that ihe
real substance of college is still j
within them, that the value of four !
years of money and time-spending
is still largely in academics.
Thankfully, we will never know
what we are missing in our pursuit j
of personality development and so
cial graces—the tinsel that sparkles I
so piettily on the human tree. For in
learning, the college man is still top
flight, with no new champion in
sight.
* * *
Regardless of how much he ac
tually learns, he is set to win. The j
great part of knowledge that he i
never touches he tosses out as value- !
less because he is sure of success)
without it. His standards of how |
much to learn are purely relative to i
the amount of learning possessed by i
others.

It takes a week away from the
genial campus rat-racers to realize
that the average collegian is a
profligate, wasting priceless learning
he can never recover for the social
graces he has conveniently en
dowed with a value far above their
intrinsic worth.

It takes a week away from the

that the average collegian is a
