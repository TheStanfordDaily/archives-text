Wesley Foundation last night in the
First Methodist Church, Palo Alto.
The cast made up entirely of Stan

who, besides excellently directing
the play, took the principal part, that
of the Captain. Mary Robertson, who
as Mary, the mother of Christ,
gave a worthy interpretation Â«f a
difficult part; and Arthur McArthur,
who completed the cast, doing a
good bit of work as the other Roman
Soldier.
