# Eden Seeks Unchallenged Peace Ring
## Secretary Urges Swift Action On Oil Embargo; Rearming Defended Before Commons 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 24 (&).â€”Anthony
Eden laid down a plan today for a
universal system of "collective se
curity" in his maiden speech as
Foreign Secretary to the House of
Commons, but failed to satisfy gov
ernment opponents on the more im
mediate question of an oil embargo
against Italy.
Before packed galleries, including
European diplomats, the ertswhile
"White Knight of Geneva" staunchly
defended rearmament and empha
sized that Britain must be strong
and fearless in taking the leadership
to prevent a world war.
Reassures Germany
"Our final objective," he told the
tense house, "must be a world wide
system of collective security which
embraces all nations in an authority
which is unchallenged and unchal
lengeable."
In what was interpreted as an
effort to reassure Germany, Eden
declared "the British government
will have no lot or part in encir
clement."
(France's foreign policy is based
on the encirclement of Germany by
a "ring of steel" of allied powers.)
Sanctions Avoided
Eden sidestepped a definite com
mittment on an oil sanction, which
caused immediate citicism of his
speech as vague. His address was
the subject of frequent interruptions.
The United States' policy toward
an oil embargo was frequently men
tioned by government opponents,
who argued that Britain and the
league must first set an example if
they wanted support from across
the Atlantic.
Of all oil sanction, Eden asserted:
"We are far from that objective
at present. We can only hope to
realize it by strengthening the au
thority of the existing system and
facilitating, by agreement based on
wide understanding, the co-opera- !
tion of other nations in our work.
