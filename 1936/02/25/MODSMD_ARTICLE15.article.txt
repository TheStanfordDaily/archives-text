# Mural House Not Feasible Says Masters
## Rose Bowl Game Profits Are Already Allocated for Improvements, Manager Claims 
### Arthur Stokes 
Temporary infeasibility of any
plan to divert B.A.C. profits to an
intramural sports program was
pointed out yesterday by Graduate
Manager Alfred Masters, who ex
plained proceeds from Rose Bowl
games already have been allocated.
Masters voiced no other objections
to a recently announced proposal
by A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke
for construction of an intramural
building for housing equipment,
managers' offices, and possibly a
basketball unit, but indicated that
such a plan must be postponed "at
least two years."
"Unexpected" Profits Used
He explained most of the Rose
Bow! profits—described by Brooke
as "relatively unexpected"—already
had been used and the remainder is
set aside for repairs to the stadium
and athletic equipment.
Brooke had based his recom
mendation on the fact 1100 students
took part in mural activities last
year, and that the work had been
carried on with limited funds. Ap
proximately $500 yearly has been
used for mural sports.
Masters indicated that under a
10-year building program of the
8.A.C., a structure to house handball
courts, offices, and a basketball prac
tice court was to be built next. De
pleted gate receipts forced suspen
sion of the program in 1931, and
the last two Rose Bowl games have
given the board only enough money
to "catch up" to the 1931 point.
Repairs Needed
Now much of the equipment, pro
vided under the 10-year plan, is
due for repairs. Last year, Angell
Field was repaired, and this year
about $40,000 is to be used for repair
of staciium seats and fences. No
more construction can be conduc
ted for at least two years, while the
repairs are completed, but after
that—if receipts hold up—Masters
believes the board will reconsider
the building plan.
