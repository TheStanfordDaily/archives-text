# Ex Committee Cancels Meeting
## A.S.S.U. President Says Major Reasons for Postponement Are Rally, Lack of Material 
### 
No Ex Committee meeting will be
held tonight, said President Wally
Brooke. Major reasons for the last
minute cancellation are the rally
assembly to be held in the Assembly
flail and a sudden dearth of discuss-
I able measures.
The meeting was set tentatively
i for 5 o'clock today, to avoid a con
flict with the program. Nothing of
j importance came up for debate, and
Brooke found himself swamped by
j administrative details. Result:
Grayson can get home in time for
I dinner.
I All requests for dates, which were
to have been granted tonight, will
I be held over for a week. No rneas
ures will be held over simply be-
I cause, says Brooke, "there aren't
! any."
Major issues coming up next week
| will include approval of Gib Hollo
i way's committee heads for the Con
valescent Home Drive.
Last week's meeting came near
| being cancelled, said Brooke. It was
I finally called to initiate new mem
bers into the procedures of the
group. Jackie Brown, Dick Cream
er, and Chick Franich met for the
I first time, to rehash routine matters.
