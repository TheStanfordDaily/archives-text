# Stanford Possessor Of World's Fastest Machine
## 
### Dave Botsford 
Fastest thing on earth! It's a small j
steel rotor, looking almost like a j
schoolboy's lop, in Stanford's own
chemistry department.
But instead of the string which
sends a younster's plaything spin- i
ning, Dr. James W. Bain's ultra
centrifuge machine gains terrific
motion from air blown under pres- ;
sure into little vertical grooves. The
schoolboy's eyes would buldge if
he saw Dr. Bain's "top" in motion.
It spins 350,000 revolutions per min
ute. faster than anything else in the
world.
Would Fly 5 Miles
If a piece from one of the rotors
were to break off, it wouldn't stop
until it had whistled 5 miles through !
the air at bullet speed. Before Dr.
Mc√üain and his associates developed
the mechanism, used to study mole
cules and colloids, the world's high- ,
est-spced machine cost $80,000, was I

| propelled by complicated motors and
j turbines.
Frank Taylor, in his fascinating
article, ' Blazing Chemistry's New
Trails, lifts the lid off this and other
I amazing mysteries of chemical
. science in the current Illustrated
Review.
Turned "farmer" in a small way
is the chemistry department's head,
Dr. Robert Eekles Swain. Under
exact scientifically-controlled con
ditions he is growing wheat in two
great glass cases ablaze with light.
Farmers and industrialists have
long squabbled over the injurious
i effects of sulphur dioxide on wheat
crops. To help settle these diffi
culties Dr. Swain is growing wheat.
Not a ray of sun has ever hit the
lush, green plants. For three months
the brilliant glare of electric bulbs
. will glow 16 hours a day. Then the
I wheat will be ready for harvest.
