### 
SAN JOSE, Feb. 24 (/P). â€” One
blow ot sliding force could have
j caused the two "flap" wounds on the
head of Mrs. Allene Thorpe Lam
son, Dr. Milton Saier, Palo Alto
physician, testified today at the
fourth murder trial of David A.
Lamson.
Dr. Saier, under cross-examina
tion by Defense Attorney Leo Fried
man, stated he did not believe the
five-inch laceration on Mrs. Lam-
J son's skull could have been inflicted
: without fracturing the skull.
J Friedman attempted to substan
tiate the defense contention that
j Mrs. Lamson slipped in the bathtub
| and was injured fatally.
John Moore, former deputy sher
iff, was called to identify newspaper
photographs of himself and other
I officers. One picture showed three
I men sorting clothing and the second
| showed four officers handling the
I garments.
