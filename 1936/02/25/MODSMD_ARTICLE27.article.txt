### Gray Creveling 
DON'T GET THIS guy Sinclair
wrong. He's opposing Roosevelt only
to insure the block of California
Democratic delegates for the Presi
dent. He is sincere in believing Mc-
Adoo's control of the delegates as
not being to the best interests of
Roosevelt. But whichever faction
gets the convention-bound Califor
nia Democrats, it is a certainty that
they'll be solid for Roosevelt on the
first ballot if McAdoo controls
them, and on the second ballot if
Sinclair controls them.
EXPERTS APPOINTED by the
Preside?.! set to work after the NRA
repudiation to find out if sweated
labor had increased as an after
math to the outlawing of the act.
The report of the group revealed
general lengthening of working
hours, wage slashes, and a decided
increase in child labor.
And yet big business men squeal
about government interference in
business. Child labor is a disgrace
to our nation, and businesses em
ploying children hardly merit any
lespect from Americans, much less
faith in such preposterous creatures
of those businesses such as Liberty
Leagues which try to influence pop
ular opinion to their ends.
