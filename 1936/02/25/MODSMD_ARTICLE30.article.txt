# War Scandal Plot For 'Paths of Glory'
## 
### Roger Pryor 
An authentic on-the-record war
time scandal is the basic plot of
"Paths of Glory," to be produced
by the Dramatic Council in the As
sembly Hall March Gth.

How a French officer court- j
martialed four men to death after |
they and their companies failed to j
sacrifice themselves for his personal
glory is told in the stage version of
this scandal that rocked the whole of
France.
The story, originally published in
Jean Galtier - Boissiere's small
French magazine, "Crapouillot,"
was substantiated by a court deci- j
sion awarding the widows of the 1
men one franc each as reparations,
and clearing their names by declar
ing them to be valiant men.
Boissiere's account ran as fol-

lows. In March, 1915, a French in
fantry regiment was ordered into
the front lines at Souain Mill. Three
attempts to take a strong German
position had failed under withering
machine gun fire, with heavy losses.
The high command ordered the regi
ment's 21st company to attack again,
at dawn on March 10. Tired sol
diers made one last wavering start
but fell back under violent enemy
fire.
Four Corporals Shot
Furious at the news of the defeat,
the division commander, General
Reveilhas, then ordered the com
pany to the rear. Thereupon as an
object'lesson and as a means of
disciplining, four corporals were or
dered shot by a firing squad and
wei'e buried under shameful black
crosses.
The account v/as brought to
American notice when Westbrook
Pegler on a recent trip abroad noted
the amazing similarity between the
account in "Chapouillot" and the
book, "Paths of Glory," written by
Humphrey Cobb. Sidney Howard
adapted the play from the Cobb
book.
The Stanford cast which was an
nounced last week includes in its
principal roles three Stanford pro
fessors, Drs. Lee Bassett, Edwin
Lesley, and Kurt Reinhardt. Among
others in the play are Paul Crary,
Fred Clark, Bob Garred, and Jack
Temple.
Three Massachusetts schools, Holy
Crnss, Williams, and Harvard have
declined NYA assistance.

An authentic on-the-record war
time scandal is the basic plot of
"Paths of Glory," to be produced
by the Dramatic Council in the As
sembly Hall March Gth.

How a French officer court- j
martialed four men to death after |
they and their companies failed to j
sacrifice themselves for his personal
glory is told in the stage version of
this scandal that rocked the whole of
France.
The story, originally published in
Jean Galtier - Boissiere's small
French magazine, "Crapouillot,"
was substantiated by a court deci- j
sion awarding the widows of the 1
men one franc each as reparations,
and clearing their names by declar
ing them to be valiant men.
Boissiere's account ran as fol-

lows. In March, 1915, a French in
fantry regiment was ordered into
the front lines at Souain Mill. Three
attempts to take a strong German
position had failed under withering
machine gun fire, with heavy losses.
