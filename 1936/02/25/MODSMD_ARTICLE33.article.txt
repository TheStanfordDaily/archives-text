# Council Tries Two Frosh For Poster Theft
## Encina Men Summoned Before Judicial Group on Charge Of Robbing Downtown Theater 
### 
Up before the Men's Council yes
terday afternoon were the first of—
fenders in over a month who had
done any thing more heinious than
break a traffic regulation—two frosh
were tried for walking off with ex
pensive posters belonging to the
Stanford Theater.
Posters Valuable
The posters of which there were
two, were valued at $10 apiece by
Manager George Teckmeyer. The
offenders were caught when the
missing signs were discovered in
their Encina room. One of the pos
ters was immediately returned to
its owner, but the other had been
destroyed by the 'pranksters."
Men's Council Chairman Gib Hol
loway said that students should avoid
this sort of thing in the future, as,
had the Palo Alto police taken the
two offenders, they would have been
tried in court for petty theft, in spite
of their apparently innocent designs.
Settled Amicably
George Burns, campus cop, Tack
meyer, and the Men's Council set
tled the whole affair amicably by
dismissing the case, and arranging
that the two offenders go down to
the theater and settle for the missing
poster with the management.
