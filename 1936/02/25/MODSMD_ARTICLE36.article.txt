# Gros Expectant As Pet Pisces Enter Hospital
## 
### 
Student Manager Bob Gros an
nounced yesterday that he'll soon
be a father—at least two of his
favorite fish were taken over the
week-end to a "maternity hos
pital."
Everyone's heard of Bob Gi'os'
fish, kept scientifically in a glass
jar on his office desk. They're ex
citing, he says — one committed
suicide last week, and now two
others are going to have "babies."

They were taken to a friend's
home in Paly where they will get
plenty of "peace and quiet." Two
or three sets of rosy-finned quin
tuplets are expected from each
mother.
