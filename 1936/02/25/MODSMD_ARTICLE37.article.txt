# Critic of WPA Removed From High Army Post
## Rebuke Comes Directly From F.D.R. as Result of Recent Testimony Before Committee 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (£>).—As
a swift aftermath of his recent criti
cism of WPA funds as "stage mon- ,
ey," Maj. Gen. Johnson Hagood to
day was relieved of his command
"by direction of the President"—a
move that stirred immediate reper
cussions in Congress.
No Reason Given
Although the War Department
gave no reason for its unusual or
der, sending the Army's third rank
ing senior general olFicer home to
await further instructions, members 1
of Congress and others ascribed his
" reprimand" to testimony before a
Congressional sub-committee that
"you can pass it (WPA money)
around, but you cannot get any
thing out of it."
An early rush of Republican criti
cism threatened to make y political
incident of Hagood's removal. More
than one House Democrat also came
forward either in defense of the
general, or direct criticism of the
action.
Simile Drawn
One minority Congressman lik
ened the move to the recent with
drawal of the marine band from an
engagement before a patriotic or
ganization that had listened to criti
cism of the Administration.
Asserting he would "fight to a
finish" against the War Department
for its "punishment" of Hagood,
Representative Blanton, Democrat
of Texas, declared that Secretary
Dern, Assistant Secretary Harry H.
Woodring, and Gen. Malin Craig,
chief of staff, themselves should "be
impeached and removed from office."
