FAREWELL TRIBUTE
TO VOWING SOPHS
Tonight the 1935 football season
honors will be passed out for prob
ably the last time. All of the nine
three-year men Grayson, Hamil
ton, Moscrip, Reynolds, Muller,
Adams Rouble, Alustiza, and Top
ping—will be awarded a big plaque,
the Walsh syndicate hands out All —
American awards, Bobby Grayson
gets the All-American captain's
loving cup.
The nine to be eulogized for the
last time are 9/llths of the only
football team ever to make the
Rose Bowl three years running. A
tremendous record. Nine great fel
lows who combined to form one of
the finest elevens ever to tread
American turf.
A great team, and great individual
stars. Although most everybody
thought of Grayson, Hamilton, and
Moscrip as the biggest individual
performers, you always had Alus
tiza and the others there in the line
to make the holes and stop the op
posing charges.
Which reminds me of a little thing
that happened at Pasadena New
Year's. I had gotten in late, and
there was no room left in the root
ing section, so I eased into a seat
over in the next aisle.
Next to me sat a kind old clergy
man who was quite interested in the
Stanfords: he had been following
their progress all year and knew
them all by name. He was very at
tentive and cheered for us and made
some very pertinent observations
anent the Cardinal power.
His best, a veritable gem, he got
off at the end of the game.
Turning to me, with a divine smile
and slightly raised eyebrows, he
spake: "And now abideth Grayson,
Hamilton, and Moscrip, these three;
but the greatest of these is Gray
son. Not bad, eh, son?" and got up
and walked out.
NOW THEY CALL IIIM
"TRAP DOOR SPIDER"'
Up at Galileo High the kids used
to call Hank Luisetti "Spider" be
cause he was pretty gangling there
as a sophomore four years ago. Now
the kids here at Stanford can right
fully call Agile Angelo '"Trap Door
Spider."
It all revolves around the Los An
geles Auditorium where the Tro
jans and Cards split last week-end.
Down on the auditorium floor there
are, for some silly reason, several
trap doors, leading ostensibly down
into some subterranean glory-hole.
Anyway, Eddie Oram, the very
good Trojan guard, tells the story
on himself. "I was detailed to guard
Hank," he says, "and he was just
too fast for me and I couldn't stop
that change of pace of his, so he
was running up 20 points pretty
far.t.
"So I decided that the only way to
stop him was to trick him over near
one of the trap dooi's and shove him
in. But I couldn't do it," Eddie
moaned, "because whenever I
thought I had him I'd look up and
there would be Hank, streaking
down the other side of the coui't
right in position for a set-up."
FROM THE WEEK-END. Gene
Venzke, the Pottstown, Pa., miler,
back in top form with a Bonthron
kick to beat Cunningham in record
time ... A Colorado College negro
named Cruter jumping 6.8 15/16 for
new" ir.door record . . . The rugby
team confident of trimming Cal . . .
Golfers best in the west . . . Dinty
Moore, the ol' pilot, back in form
with 9 points Saturday nite.

Venzke, the Pottstown, Pa., miler,
back in top form with a Bonthron

time ... A Colorado College negro

team confident of trimming Cal . . .
Golfers best in the west . . . Dinty
Moore, the ol' pilot, back in form

FAREWELL TRIBUTE
TO VOWING SOPHS
Tonight the 1935 football season
honors will be passed out for prob
ably the last time. All of the nine
three-year men Grayson, Hamil
ton, Moscrip, Reynolds, Muller,
Adams Rouble, Alustiza, and Top
ping—will be awarded a big plaque,
the Walsh syndicate hands out All —
American awards, Bobby Grayson
gets the All-American captain's
loving cup.
The nine to be eulogized for the
last time are 9/llths of the only
football team ever to make the
Rose Bowl three years running. A
tremendous record. Nine great fel
lows who combined to form one of
the finest elevens ever to tread
American turf.
A great team, and great individual
stars. Although most everybody
thought of Grayson, Hamilton, and
Moscrip as the biggest individual
performers, you always had Alus
tiza and the others there in the line
to make the holes and stop the op
posing charges.
Which reminds me of a little thing
that happened at Pasadena New
Year's. I had gotten in late, and
there was no room left in the root
ing section, so I eased into a seat
over in the next aisle.
Next to me sat a kind old clergy
man who was quite interested in the
Stanfords: he had been following
their progress all year and knew
them all by name. He was very at
tentive and cheered for us and made
some very pertinent observations
anent the Cardinal power.
His best, a veritable gem, he got
off at the end of the game.
Turning to me, with a divine smile
and slightly raised eyebrows, he
spake: "And now abideth Grayson,
Hamilton, and Moscrip, these three;
but the greatest of these is Gray
son. Not bad, eh, son?" and got up
and walked out.
NOW THEY CALL IIIM
"TRAP DOOR SPIDER"'
Up at Galileo High the kids used
to call Hank Luisetti "Spider" be
cause he was pretty gangling there
as a sophomore four years ago. Now
the kids here at Stanford can right
fully call Agile Angelo '"Trap Door
Spider."
It all revolves around the Los An
geles Auditorium where the Tro
jans and Cards split last week-end.
Down on the auditorium floor there
are, for some silly reason, several
trap doors, leading ostensibly down
into some subterranean glory-hole.
Anyway, Eddie Oram, the very
good Trojan guard, tells the story
on himself. "I was detailed to guard
Hank," he says, "and he was just
too fast for me and I couldn't stop
that change of pace of his, so he
was running up 20 points pretty
far.t.
"So I decided that the only way to
stop him was to trick him over near
one of the trap dooi's and shove him
in. But I couldn't do it," Eddie
moaned, "because whenever I
thought I had him I'd look up and
there would be Hank, streaking
down the other side of the coui't
