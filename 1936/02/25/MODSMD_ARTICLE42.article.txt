# Varsity Primes For Bear Clash Friday Night
## Coach Bunn Describes Shooting Practice as Just Fooling Around'; Team in Shape 
### Phil Duffy 
"Just fooling around today," was
the way John Bunn described yes
terday's workout for Stanford's var
sity hoop team, co-leader of the
Southern Division in the Pacific
Coast Conference.
And "fooling around" consisted of
some good shooting practice which
will pul the boys in good form for
the coming clash with the Golden
Bear on Friday night. If we recall
correctly, the Price boys drilled for
a whoi-.> week on shootmg alone, and
everyone remembers what hap
pened at the last Berkeley game.
Only this time it is a Pavilion game
and the moral is—"what's good for
the geese"—oh, well.
Luiselti's Operation
In good shape after their party
with the Trojans which resulted in
a chaw, the Indian basketeers re
turn to the Farm with only one small
casualty. "Hank" Luisetti had three
stitches taken over his left eye after
Ward Browning's elbow made its
mark there in a melee under the
basket.
Bob Zpnne's hand is still taped,
but everyone has come to discount
that. We know it's Bob even
though the Sunday Chronicle pro
ceeded to cross themselves up more
than anyone else, while trying to
explain the difference betvteen Bob
and Phil of the phrosh.
Farm basketball interest will not
center on the Farm alone this week
end. Many fingers will be crossed in
the hope tbat the Bruins, who did
the Stanfords a good deed this past
week-end, will do another and dump
the Trojans from their top post. And
it is not too much to ask for, either.
Troy 3-up on U.C.L.A.
Troy has won three games from
U.G.L.A., but only by the slender
margins of seven, four, and four
points. In one of those games neither
team scored a field goal in 12 min
utes. In another the Westwood team
led at half-time and in still another
they were tied with S.C. at 12 all.
So it is not shooting at the moon to
say that Caddy Works' team can
topple the Trojan from his perch.
To make this presupposed good
deed complete, Stanford must put
California in their proper place and
thereby win the southern title. Many
heads shake dubiously at the
thought of Friday's game, but they
can be stilled by recalling the first
California game in the Pavilion
when Stanford dominated the play
and emerged the winner.
True, the Indians shouldn't have
lost the second game, and as for the
third, it was just "one of those
things." They have beaten Cal once
in the Pavilion and there is nothing
to stop them from doing it again.

they were tied with S.C. at 12 all.
So it is not shooting at the moon to
say that Caddy Works' team can
topple the Trojan from his perch.
To make this presupposed good
deed complete, Stanford must put
California in their proper place and
thereby win the southern title. Many
heads shake dubiously at the
thought of Friday's game, but they
can be stilled by recalling the first
California game in the Pavilion
when Stanford dominated the play
and emerged the winner.
True, the Indians shouldn't have
lost the second game, and as for the
third, it was just "one of those
things." They have beaten Cal once
in the Pavilion and there is nothing
to stop them from doing it again.
"Just fooling around today," was
the way John Bunn described yes
terday's workout for Stanford's var
sity hoop team, co-leader of the
Southern Division in the Pacific
Coast Conference.
And "fooling around" consisted of
some good shooting practice which
will pul the boys in good form for
the coming clash with the Golden
Bear on Friday night. If we recall
correctly, the Price boys drilled for
a whoi-.> week on shootmg alone, and
everyone remembers what hap
pened at the last Berkeley game.
Only this time it is a Pavilion game
and the moral is—"what's good for
the geese"—oh, well.
Luiselti's Operation
In good shape after their party
with the Trojans which resulted in
a chaw, the Indian basketeers re
turn to the Farm with only one small
casualty. "Hank" Luisetti had three
stitches taken over his left eye after
Ward Browning's elbow made its
mark there in a melee under the
basket.
Bob Zpnne's hand is still taped,
but everyone has come to discount
that. We know it's Bob even
though the Sunday Chronicle pro
ceeded to cross themselves up more
than anyone else, while trying to
explain the difference betvteen Bob
and Phil of the phrosh.
Farm basketball interest will not
center on the Farm alone this week
end. Many fingers will be crossed in
the hope tbat the Bruins, who did
the Stanfords a good deed this past
week-end, will do another and dump
the Trojans from their top post. And
it is not too much to ask for, either.
Troy 3-up on U.C.L.A.
Troy has won three games from
U.G.L.A., but only by the slender
margins of seven, four, and four
points. In one of those games neither
team scored a field goal in 12 min
utes. In another the Westwood team
led at half-time and in still another
they were tied with S.C. at 12 all.
