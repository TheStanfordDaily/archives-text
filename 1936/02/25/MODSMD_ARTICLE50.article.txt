# Trackmen To Meet Fresno State Team
## 
### 
Coach Flint Hanner's potent
I Fresno State track team will also
I grace the Cardinal schedule this
i year, it was announced yesterday
by the Board of Athletic Control.
Dink Templeton's varsity will
journey to the inland city on Maich
| 21, the Saturday after finals, for a
j dual meet.
Last year Fresno came to Stan
j ford to compete, waited around for
nearly a week fur a dry day, before
I returning home untried. Officials,

present conditions indicate, have
done wisely to select the valley city
as a meet site this year.
Local track conditions are rapidly
, becoming a serious issue. Twelve
i varsity men have been invited to
show their be.st in the Golden Spikes
Indoor Championships at San Fvan
j cisco next Thursday night, while Bill
| Ellington's Frosh are scheduled to
open against San Mateo J.C. here
Saturday.
All of which shouldn't cause con
cern, except that the stadium water
table hasn't seen ground level for
ten days; the cindermen now have
to practice around the outside of
the arena. Jumpers and weightmen
have had nearly no practice in two
weeks.
The coming indoor meet promises
as fine a program as that two weeks
ago; the featured race this week will
be the Mile Run, in which Glenn
Cunningham, Charles Hornbostel,
and Joe McClusky have filed entries.
