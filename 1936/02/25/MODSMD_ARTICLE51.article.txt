# Frosh Cagers Prepare for Tilt
## Game Friday with Bears Will Decide 'Little Big Series'; Zonne Out with Injuries 
### 
As Phil Zonne, star center who is
j out for the season, studied vague
j X-rays of his injuries, Indian frosh
cagers worked out yesterday in
j preparation for their final game,
j That will be the third and
I deciding part of the "Little Big Se
! ries" with the Bear Cubs, who in
; vade the Pavilion at G:3O o'clock
j Friday night.
Zonne sustained a broken finger
; and at least one cracked rib when
j he collided with empty bleachers
I in the San Mateo J.C. tilt last week.
| The X-rays, taken Saturday, turned
! out poorly; so the exact number of
J broken bones in his midsection is
j uncertain.
The finger injury and a foot bruise
suffered in the foundry are healing
fast, however, as the tall yearling
captain remains in the hospital.
Practice yesterday was largely de
voted to a defensive drill given
Wally DeWitt and Chuck Melczer by
Coach Rabbit Bradshaw. DeWitt is
the former sub guard who looked
good in Zonne's center spot against
the U.S.F. frosh Saturday night.
