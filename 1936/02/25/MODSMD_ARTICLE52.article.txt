# Varsity Ruggers Switch Positions:
## 
### 
Enthusiastic over his team's bril- |
liant showing in swamping the
Bruins over the week-end, Coach
Jim Wylie has a unique idea for
his men to toy with this afternoon.
In order that all his team men
will better understand the plays,
Coach Wylie has ordered all back
field men to play in the scrum and
the regular scrum men to take posi- i
i tions in the backfield for a scrim
mage game.
Varsity ruggers have a busy week !
ahead of them. On Wednesday at
4 o'clock they will play the Palo i
Alto All-Blacks, an alumni team
composed principally of stars from
last year's team. Saturday, they
will bump against the University
Club in a Northern California Rug
-1 by League game.
