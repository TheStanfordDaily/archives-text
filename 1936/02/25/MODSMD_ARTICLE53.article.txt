## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism 'Mural House' Next on B.A.C. 10-Year Plan; Meanwhile, Why Not Boost Budget? 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke's dream
of a castle where inlrainuralists may gather
to toss basketballs, discuss and mark down
records, and store equipment must remain
unrealized for the present, hut it may he des
tined for culmination in the not so distant
future.
Brooke's plan was to promote intramural
sports with tlie construction of an "intra
mural house," around which intra-eampus
sports could he centered, by the use of Hose
Bowl profits.
The catch: all but a few thousand dollars
of the Hose Bowl profits are already allocated
and the surplus must go for repairs in the
stadium. The athletic plant has been wearing
down during recent years, and renovations
inust naturally come before new projects are
started.
Brooke's objective, however, is a worthy
one. An increasing number of students are
taking part in the local sports program, and
nearly every campus leader favors further
emphasis on intramural. But because of the
financial reasons, no great immediate im
provement, such as the construction of an
"intramural house," is feasible.
Another unit in the B.A.C. group of struc
tures has been a definite part of the "ten-year
building program" from the very beginning.
This unit, which would be built just south

of Encina swimming pool, would include
practice basketball and handball courts and
several oflices. Because of its very nature, it
would be devoted chiefly to intramural activi
ties and might very well be honored with such
a title as "intramural house."
B.A.C. financing of Branner Hall and the
new Women's Gym, together with a depleted
income during the general depression, has
held up the athletic building program. Bid
now debts are dwindling, gale receipts are on
the rise, and the building program probably
will be resumed within a few years.
In the meantime, the B.A.C. should not con
sider the new building the only way by which
it can "further emphasize" intramural sports.
At present $f>oo is the allotment given each
year, for carrying out a program which in
cludes a full dozen sports. The intramural
manager complains that the sum is grossly
insuHicient.
Though the intramural house, which would
put the Farm's mural program on a par with
that in any school in the country, is still a
dream, nevertheless athletic officials, if they
are taking their stand on intramural seri
ously, might boost the yearly appropriation to
at least $1,000. This would expand mural
facilities and raise the program's elliciency
to a desirable level.

one. An increasing number of students are
taking part in the local sports program, and
nearly every campus leader favors further
emphasis on intramural. But because of the
financial reasons, no great immediate im
provement, such as the construction of an
"intramural house," is feasible.
Another unit in the B.A.C. group of struc
tures has been a definite part of the "ten-year
building program" from the very beginning.
This unit, which would be built just south

of Encina swimming pool, would include
practice basketball and handball courts and
several oflices. Because of its very nature, it
would be devoted chiefly to intramural activi
ties and might very well be honored with such
a title as "intramural house."
B.A.C. financing of Branner Hall and the
new Women's Gym, together with a depleted
income during the general depression, has
held up the athletic building program. Bid
now debts are dwindling, gale receipts are on
the rise, and the building program probably
will be resumed within a few years.
In the meantime, the B.A.C. should not con
sider the new building the only way by which
it can "further emphasize" intramural sports.
At present $f>oo is the allotment given each
year, for carrying out a program which in
cludes a full dozen sports. The intramural
manager complains that the sum is grossly
insuHicient.
Though the intramural house, which would
put the Farm's mural program on a par with
that in any school in the country, is still a
dream, nevertheless athletic officials, if they
are taking their stand on intramural seri
ously, might boost the yearly appropriation to
at least $1,000. This would expand mural
facilities and raise the program's elliciency
to a desirable level.
A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke's dream
of a castle where inlrainuralists may gather
to toss basketballs, discuss and mark down
records, and store equipment must remain

future.
Brooke's plan was to promote intramural
sports with tlie construction of an "intra
mural house," around which intra-eampus
sports could he centered, by the use of Hose
Bowl profits.
The catch: all but a few thousand dollars
of the Hose Bowl profits are already allocated
and the surplus must go for repairs in the
stadium. The athletic plant has been wearing
down during recent years, and renovations
inust naturally come before new projects are
started.
