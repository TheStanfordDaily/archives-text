# Farm Tonight Recognizes Them as Men â€” Not Names
## 
### 
Stanford gives its last official recognition to
the "Vowing Sophomores" at the football rally
tonight.
These capable warriors of the gridiron,
whose glorious defeats and glorious victories
have been painted on the national football
panorama the past three years, have already
achieved their niche in Fame's Hall for foot
ball men.
Tonight there comes Stanford's own per

sonal tribute. For the campus knows these
men, stripped of the glamour of printer's ink,
the screen, and the kilocycles.
The Farm recognizes them as men with
special talents, who have developed those tal
ents to a higher collective peak than any simi
lar group of men in Stanford history.
It feels that their ability to concentrate
these energies in acquiring dominance in a
highly specialized, highly competitive sport
evidences special innate talents, and believes
that the lessons learned in athletic battles will
overbalance the detrimental effects of the
one-sided atmosphere and environment of
American football hysteria.
On the Quad, in activities, and in the class
rooms many of the pigskin heroes have shown
their wares as Stanford men, and not as
heroes. The school as a whole has not pam
pered her gridiron greats. If the spotlight of
fame has penetrated the fog of the Farm's
isolation, it has resulted only in the heighten
ing of the survey of critical eyes.
More than the opportunity for Meeting
lame, more than grade-points in the Bawlout,
has this been a service to their education.
The rally tonight symbolizes the fact that
the football heroes, who over three years ago
were acclaimed in the national press, have
definitely and conclusively passed the Stan
ford Hoard of Review, and have passed it,
what is more, with an overwhelming stamp
of approval.
