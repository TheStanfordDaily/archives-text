After being buffeted severely in the Roble dating

Another case of interest happened to one of the
Encinamen. He ran across a comely looking sales
lady in one of the Paly stores. There was a good deal
of banter on both sides. Finally, he asked for a date.
"Yes?" she says with a lilt in her voice.
"Well," he says, "there's a party in room Glmphff
at Encina tonight."
"Yes?" she says with a lilt, in her voice.
But I am sad to say that (he party in room Glmphff
Encina was called off suddenly that night.
The lady with the lilt in her voice was the wife of
a campus cop and nightwaichman.
Leviticus, the Chi O 'lashboy, has been knocking
about the world considerably, having mined for gold
in Alaska and dug for the P.G.&E. in Grass Valley.
He is a very tough customer, is Levit, and something
of a boxer. However, lh?re seems to be something
in his eventful past that he has veiled in secrecy.
He was discovered in ihe Chi O parlor the other
evening, knitting on a little skirt. When the cook
pointed an accusing finger at him, Levit blushed, but
refused to talk.
