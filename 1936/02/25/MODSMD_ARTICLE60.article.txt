The Editor, Sir:
It is with regret that I scan your
paper and sound out public opinion
and find that the noble efforts of
Eisenbach and Miss Susan to im
prove the quality of the social rela
tionships on the Stanford campus
have borne no fruit and gained few
converts.
Of course, no newly inaugurated
system, no sudden pronouncement
from the authorities, can automat
ically reform our social system and
make our social contacts richer and
more valuable to us.
Like an education, social satisfac
tion and effectiveness does not come
to him who waits or hesitates. Effort
usually brings dividends.
The ti'ouble is that our social ac
tivities are chiefly "follow-the
crowd" movements to the current
dances, dining places, and show
houses. Their success depended
upon money, cars, beauty, clothes,
"technique," and the "line," that
weird collection of inanities de
signed to enforce an evening's re
laxation from serious thought.
Why must some students be de
nied opportunities for social expres
sion, while others are dated all the
time? Why are our activities so
standardized and aimless? It is the
student's own fault!
If more of them would participate
wholeheartedly in the activities of
some mixed campus group there
would be less cause for complaint.
Social expression as a member of a
group would be assured, and the in
dividual companionship which we
all desire would probably develop
spontaneously as a result.
Why wait for the improbable! Do
something for yourselves! There
must be a group which you have
something in common with. Join it
and lose yourself in its activities.
Walter Powell
