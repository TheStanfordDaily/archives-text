# Firecrackers In Physics Department Rile Businessites
## 
### 
Friction developed last week be
tween the Business School and
the physics department.
"I hate to bother you about
this," telephoned Miss Lillian
Owen of the business school to
Miss V. V. Hoorheis, physics de
partment secretary, "but the un
seemly conduct of some of your
student;, has forced it upon me.
They are throwing firecrackers
out of the windows."
Miss Voorhcis explained that
physics students were firing rifles
in an experiment, so the racket
couldn t be helped.
' Then I'll have to move one of
my professors; he's being driven
to distraction," said Miss Owen
as she hung up.
