TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 24 (/P). â€”
Governor Harold G. Hoffman today
accused Millard Whited, Sourland
mountain lumberjack and one of
the state's chief witnesses against
Bruno Richard Hauptmann, with
"lying," a charge which might be
the basis of perjury action against
him.
Accused of Lie
The govei'nor, who questioned
Whited at length Saturday, said the
"printed and written record shows
that he was lying." Whited was one
of the two witnesses who placed
Hauptmann near the Lindbergh es
tate at Hopewell about the time of
the kidnaping, March 1, 1932.
The Sourland logger was the only
witness New Jersey called at
Hauptmann's extradition hearing in
New York to place the Bronx car
penter near the scene of the crime.
Whited swore he saw Hauptmann
prowling around the Lindbergh
grounds on two occasions late in
February, 1932, He repeated this
testimony at the Flemington trial.
Whited Previously Attacked
The defense, both at the extradi
tion hearing and at the trial, pro
duced wtnesses who attacked
Whited'c credibility. Whited held
to his identification, and Saturday
told Governor Hoffman that he had
described the prowler to Col.
Charles A. Lindbergh the day after
the kidnaping.
Firemen of Pocohontas, Va., were
routed out of bed to find that it
was thf.ir own firehouse on fire.
