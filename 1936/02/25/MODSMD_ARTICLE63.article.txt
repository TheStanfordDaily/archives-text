## WHO WOULD BET A MILLION ON US? 
### 
The money that was bet on the
| fleetness of 15 well-bted horses at
Santa Anita last Saturday would
have paid everybody's tuition for

| "
four quarters.
Over $1,000,000
in cold cash cool
| ed the pari-mu
! t u e 1 counters,
tinkling a tune of
confidence in a
few long-tailed
brutes whom ev
erybody knows

are the fastest things with four legs
j and a mane.

If those 15 equinal aristocrats had
| understanding, they would have
been flattered to extremes about all
the money people were placing in
their care. For did several thousand
people ever scramble to bet a mil
lion dollars on the ability of 15 hu
man beings to run a race, bat a ball,
I spit at a crack, or perform any other
physica' or mental feat? We say
I "no" without hesitancy. They paid
I a million to see Dempsey fight Tun
j ney, but that was no risk or wager.
sis Sjt Sj!
The ponies are better gambling
material than humans because they
are made of better stuff. Who'll
deny that Top Row is a better horse
j than most men are men? You can
i take a thoroughbred horse and trace
! his ancestry back for hundreds of
! years sometimes, and find that the
line is pure throughout. It's pretty
I hard to find a man who even knows
who his great grandfather was, but
if you can and start making inves
tigations, you're almost sure to run
across an invalid, an imbecile, a for
eigner, a drunkard, a horse thief, or
all five someplace along the line.

Human beings, and Americans
especially, aren't purebreds! We
marry whomever be please when
ever we please and produce a race
so conglomerate it's amazing how
well wc do get along.
We wouldn't think of breeding
blue-ribbon-winning Rover with the
I spotted mutt next door, but if cousin
Bill, who has epileptic iits, wants to
! marry somebody, it's all right.

Dr. Wilbur in his last report
wrote: "Nothing is more hit and muss
than our human breeding. We need
further studies to determine the end
' results of the preservation of the
| physically and mentally handicapped
through modern science or applied
biology . . . Efforts for birth control
have . . . been most effective among
those on the higher intellectual lev
els, so that the race is being bred
down and not up."

College students should study this
problen. of human breeding. Dr.
Wilbur admits that. It is one of the
few scientific problems which af
j fects e\ ery single person whether
I he goes to college or not.
And yet the problem is touched on

but briefly in biology, sociology, and
hygiene. Wo may think so, but we're
not all on the "higher intellectual
levels" who breed the race down.
Stanford could be known as the
most enlightened of the educational
centers if it emphasized the study of
birth control. â€”John McClelland
