### 
"Not 10 per cent of the average
audience listens to the perform
ance," observes Jascha Heifetz, not
ed violinist, who will appear in the
Pavilion Thursday evening.
Audiences usually analyze per-
I formers—but this time the listen-
I er;; themselves are dissected. Ac
cording to the artist, he has discov
ered seyeral basic truths in his
years of experience. The audience
can stimulate or chill a perform
ance, he declares.
"American audiences particularly
are standardized," Heifetz says, and
he begs them to hiss if they are
displeased and to applaud if they
are moved. "But nothing is worse
than the fear of public opinion—
i the lack of individual courage which
makes every member of the audi
j ence behave exactly like the man in
front of him."
Tickets for the concert may be
bought at Keeble's in Palo Alto, or
the Concert Series Office in the Old
