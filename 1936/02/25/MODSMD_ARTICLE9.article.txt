# Borah, Sinclair Seek Nomination
## Epic Chief Heads End Poverty Group in Coming Campaign; Contest Seen with McAdoo 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (A*). —
The politcial wars today produced i
sharp cleavage in the Democratic
columns in California—and also a
new move in the Borah camp that
intrigued politcial observers.
An ally of Senator Borah's Ray
McKaig of Boise, announced that '
he would seek the noted Idahoan's
Senate seat. This ied to speculation |
as to whether Borah was burning his
bridges in his drive for the Repub
lican Presidential nomination.
Should Borah fail to obtain the
nomination at the National Convcn- i
tion opening June 9. he still would
have time to go after Senate re- j
nomination. The Idaho primary is
not until August 11 and candidates
can file until 30 days before that |
date.
On the California fiont, Upton
Sinclair, in a dramatic re-entry into
the political arena, agreed to be
come the nominal - presidential
choice of the End Poverty Leaguers,
now apparently ready for a finish 1
struggle for supremacy with the
forces of Senator McAdoo.
