For Your Old Shoes
I d like to take this opportunity of thanking you for your splendid sup
port. Your response has meant more than I can say to our less fortunate
neighbors.
As you know, during the month of February I have given every customer,
who wore an old pair of shoes into my store, the Walk-Over Boot Shop, $1.00
for his shoes after he had bought a new pair. I am paying for the materials
to have the old shoes repaired and then turning thm over to the needy free
of cost.
There are three more days in February. This is your last chance to help
put this over in a big way.
