fie, and Jim Fansohoff in action.

Ticket Sell-out
In explaining Ihe ticket sell-out,
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity
director, pointed out that rooters'
tickets and general admissions were
put on sale Monday, because in the
past, tardiness of student buyers has
held up public sale and often pre
vented possible sell-outs.
Liebendorfer stated that there are
less than 2700 seats in the Pavilion
and that 950 of these were reserved
for the Cal rooting section. Since
Stanford students purchased only
370 tickets Monday no shortage was
foreseen. When roughs started their
raid on the B.A.C. yesterday morn
ing Liebendorfer immediately shut
off the public sale.
Students who were unable to ob
tain rooters' tickets have signed on
a waiting list in the B.A.C. office,
but there is no possibility of their
obtaining tickets, it was said. More
than a hundred students signed this
waiting list.
