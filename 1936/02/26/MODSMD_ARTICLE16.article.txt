# Councils Start Clarification Of Honor System
## Ex-Committee Revised Present Code in 1931; Included Only Provisions on Exes, Library 
### Dave Botsford 
"The honor system has started to
creak. Can thi men and women of I
Stanford let the system die? It is |
one of the best things you have, but I
if you cion't want it sound and clean j
you may not have it at all."
As they progress in their move for
clarification and evaluation of the j
Honor Code inaugurated last week,
Men's and Women's Councils are !
considering these words of President !
Ray Lyman Wilbur, spoken to a J
student assembly in October, 1928.
Only after a three-year struggle i
was the Honor Code returned, in |
1931, to the "sound and clean" basis
from which it had degenerated in
the 19205. In the spring of 1931, the
Ex Committee's new Code was ap
proved by Acting President Robert
E. Swain. Today this revised Code
exists.
It deals only with two aspects of
student life: examinations and the
Library. It provides that students
will be left "on their own" during
exes, but those who cheat must, un
der the Code, be repotted to the
councils.
Booki may not be removed from
the Library unless properly signed
out, and the student is "on his hon
or" not to deface them.
Much in the manner that legends
gain credence, the honor system has
been construed to apply to all
phases of student behavior. But the
Code has no control over women's
regulations, rushing, or the tradi
tional "behavior becoming a Stan
ford gentleman."
These other student activities,
however, might well bo considered
part of a broad honor system, if not
actually part of the Code.
In 1930, the Ex Committee ap
proved adding to the Code the stipu
lation that at the request of any
student or instructor, proctors would
be placed in examination rooms to
check on cheating. This move grew
out of students' aversion to report
ing their classmates' Code violations.
But the Administration and the
student body, in a 1931 election,
voiced strong disapproval of the
honor-proctor plan. "One system or
the other," they said. "But not
both."
This "clean-up" and clarification
of the Code resulted from popular
cynicism and lethargy concerning
"honor" in exes. In 1931, when the
squabbles ended, punishment of
violators became more harsh and
suspensions were frequent. An en
tire language class was convicted of
violation—which included failure to
report violators — and 23 students
were put upon probation.
