# Judge Affirms Trust Fund Investments
## Santa Clara Court Approves Recent Trustees' Petition To Reinvest Stanford Holdings 
### 
The right of Stanford's Board of
Trustees to invest the University's
trust funds in debentures and cor
poration stocks yesterday was af
firmed in a decision by Superior
Judge William F. James of Santa
Clara county.
The trustees recently petitioned
the court to grant permission to re
invest funds now held in public
securities and bonds on the grounds
that future inflation may seriously
threaten the University's income.
Former President Herbert Hoover,
a member of the Board, was a sur
prise witness.
Two Questions Involved
Judge James, in a prepared deci
sion, said two questions were in
volved in (he suit. They were:
First: Are the petitioners forbid
den by the express terms of the
trust, as now in force, to invest any
of the trust funds in debentures or
stocks, of corporations?
Second: If not so expressly for
bidden, is the making of such invest
ments inhibited by anything in the
nature of the trust itself, or their
obligations or responsibilities as
trustees of trust properties?
Both Claims Upheld
Claims of the trustees were up
held in both answers. To the first
question, Judge James replied
briefly:
"A careful examination of the
grants, amendments, and acts, bear
ing upon these trusts, fails to dis
close any definite prohibition of such
investments; and I am of opinion
that the first question may confi
dently bo answered in the negative."
Arguments Presented
Regarding the second question,
Judge James cited the decision in
the case of Harvard College, et al
vs. Amory, more than a hundred
years ago, in which opinion was
given that trust funds might pro
perly be invested in other than pub
lic securities, or well-secured bonds,
notes, and mortgages.
Judge James further pointed out
that "experience has also shown us
that investments in shares of pri
vate corporations may, and often
do, afford a greater measure of safe
ty, combined with a larger income
yield, than investments in public
securities or bonds in the same per
iod."
Would Be 'Unreasonable'
From these arguments, he drew
the conclusion that "It would, there
fore, seem to be an unreasonable
rule to require a possibly unsafe
investment, with little return, and
exclude a safer, or equally safe one
producing a greater return."
Declaring that tne Stanford trust
was created not only to establish
a school of higher education, but
to maintain and continuously oper
ate the same, Judge James said the
funds must earn a sufficient income
for the purposes, since the vacant
study halls and a deserted campus
would not constitute a campus.
Ruling on Petition
His ruling on the second question
follows:
"I am of the opinion that the pe
titioners may lawfully and properly
make investment from trust funds
coming to their hands, in bonds,
debentures and shares of stock of
private corporations which are well
managed, and have enjoyed for a
considerable period of time such a
reputation for permanence and sta
bility that they command the general
confidence of careful and intelligent
investors; and may likewise so in
vest in other generally recognized
forms of investment providing an
adequate rate of interest and afford
ing reasonable assurance of stable
returns.
"Tliis is not intended to exclude
other powers of investment hereto
fore exercised or decreed to them."
