THERE ARE MOKE things, Hora
tio, in the Townsend Plan than are
dreamt of in your philosophy! The
mild-mannered doctor and his
milder-mannered partner, Robert E.
Clemen*, have devised a scheme of
black-jacking American legislators
which is probably the most flagrant
attempt to rape Congressmen ever
yet conceived.
FIRST OF ALL, Dr. Townsend is
not being foolish and trying to start
a third party. He is being smart by
getting his supporters into Congress.
One by one Townsendites will get
into the House and the Senate, and
some day have control of a bloc large
enough to pass the $200-a-month
for-all-over-GO-plan.
THE PROCESS is a slow one, but
it is sure of accomplishing more than
an effort to buck the two major par
lies with a pip-squeak organization
with Townsend for president. Dr.
Townsend has evidently studied his
tory carefully enough to learn that
the inevitable fate of a third party is
oblivion.
In the meantime, the most potent
lobby since the Bonuseers has
moved into the national capital and
is putting the screws on Representa
tives and Senators.
CANDIDATES DESIRING the
endorsement of the Townsend or
ganization must answer a question
naire given him by the fanatics.
Contained in the questionnaire are
such inquiries as: "If endoi'sed by
the Townsend organization, will you
make a pledge to support and vote
for national legislation sponsored by
it?
"Will you pledge your support to a
bill enacting the Townsend Plan,
leaving the details to the organiza
tion which evolved the plan and pre
sented it to the American people?
"If already a candidate, will you
sign a statement agreeing to with
draw your candidacy in the interest
of unity and success at the polls if
someone other than yourself is en
dorsed lor the position you seek?
"If your answer is 'y es »' will y° u >
in that event, support the candidate
endorsed by the organization?
"On a separate sheet set forth why
you are in favor of the Townsend
Plan ana what methods you intend
to use to convince others to support
it at the polls."
AFTER SUCH A LIST of soul
searing questions, comes the dotted
line for the victim's signature. And
THEN come a blank for witness by a
notary public.
The Townsendites are taking no
chance on being double-crossed.
The candidate not only takes a
pledge, but swears to it.
FEYV OF US have ever heard of a
more brazen attempt to kidnap na
tional legislators in advance and
hold them signed, sealed, and de
livered.
DR. TOWNSEND is not, as many
of his critics believe, wedded to the
transaction tax as the only way to
raise the money to finance the
scheme. He is perfectly willing that
it should be any kind of a tax, just
so that it makes up a revolving fund
"sufficient to pay $200 to all Ameri
can citizens over GO . . . social divi
dends must be started and main
tained ai $200 a month—not one cent
less . . . !" in the political doctor's
own words.
NO MATTER HOW ABSURD the
scheme may bo, as soon as it gains
nation-wide popularity, the two ma
jor parties will adopt the plan as part
of their platform, and we will be
sure to have it enacted.
The doctor and his partner have
only to maintain the pace they are
setting now to some day have the
thing written in on the books.
