# Bookstore Saleswoman Says Profs 'Unconscious'
## 
### Alberta Carden 
Whoever said professors were ab
sent-minded was at least partially
correct, for if Stanford's academi
cians aren't forgetful, they are cer- j
tainly "unconscious," according to 1
Mrs. Helen Stirling, head sales- j
woman of the Bookstore.
She bases her belief on the titles |
asked for. A professorial request |
came in one day for a book called !
"It Could Happen Everywhere"—at
least, the doctor thought that was
the name. Really, the book was "It
Can't Happen Here," by Sinclair
Lewis.
Believe It or Not
Believe it or not, when T. E.
Lawrence's, "Seven Pillars of Wis-j
dom" was a best seller, a request '
came for "The Seven Piles of Knowl- |
edge."
Contrary to campus belief, how
ever, the students are just as dumb !
as professors when it comes to re
membering. A rough approached
Mrs. Stirling: "Have you a book i
called 'Nero Fiddled'?" He meant :
Alexander Woolcott's "While Rome
Burns."
\ "That was an easy one," Mrs. !
Stirling explained. "Most roughs ,
will suggest a title approximating
the real one; professors tend to
identify their books only by charac
ter and locale. One classroom mar
tinet requested "a book about an
old Spanish lady, by a Southern j
writer. What he really wanted was !
'Old Mother Mexico,' by Harry
Carr."

Mrs. Stirling's prize story oc- |
curred during an opening quarter i
rush. A frantic salesman asked,
"What's in that package?"
"Why not try God?" came the
reply.
"Say," retorted the salesman. '
"Who ever told you you're funny?" j
But the girl had only told him .
what was in the package—"Why !
Not Try God"—by Mary Pickford.
