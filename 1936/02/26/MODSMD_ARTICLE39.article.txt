# No Politics For Army Officers
## Democrats Argue for Military Exile of Hagood; Bolles Also Named in Senate Discussion 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (/P).â€” I The
military exile of Major General
Johnson Hagood was injected into
the Senate as a political issue today,
with Democrtic leaders coupling a
defense of the action with a general
warning against army officers play
ing politics.
Interrupting an attack by Senator
Hastings of Delaware, chairman of
the Republican senatorial campaign
committee, against the "punishing
of Hagood, Senator Robinson of Ar
kansas, majority leader, broadened
the issue.
Broadens Issue
He named Major General Frank
C. Bolles a politically active mem
ber of the high command.
General Bolles, commanding offi
cer of the 7th Army Corps Area at
Omaha, Robinson asserted, was "ac
tively engaged in politics, with a
candidate for the presidency." Fur
ther, said the Arkansan, he "boasts
of his activities in his behalf." He
did not name the "candidate."
Denies Charge
At Fort. Des Moines, lowa, Bolles
denied charge, asserting he is
"nut in politics" and in fact had
voted only once in his life.
Oxford university officials once
forbade the installation of baths in
dormitories because students at
tended the school only 8 months
each vear.
