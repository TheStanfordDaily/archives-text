# IT AIN'T RIGHT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For some time there has been
general discontent with the money
grabbing policies of the B.A.C. man
agement. As small provision as
possible for student tickets has been
the policy and the time period dur
ing which such tickets may be pur
chased has been unreasonably limi
ted. I
When we buy student body cards, 1
a contract exists to assure us the
rights thereof. And yet manage- !
ment of many events, particularly
athletic contests, has been such as
to make it difficult to realize these
rights.
The culminating indignity was
reached in connection with the ticket j
:ale for the Cal-Stanford basketball I
game. Rooters' tickets were adver- j
tised to be available until 5 o'clock ,
last night, but none could be had '
after noon yesterday. This grossly
insufficient provision is due solely j
to the desire of the B.A.C. to sell
more 75 cent seats at the expense j
of the student body who desire to i
attend.
