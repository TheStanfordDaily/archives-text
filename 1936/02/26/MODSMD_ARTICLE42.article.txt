In voicing the opinion of many j
we'd like to ask if college athletics ;
are in any way connected with the I
college or if they are just for the j
entertainment of the general public !
from whom a greater admission
charge can be collected at the ex
pense of the students.
We would also like to know of the
B.A.C. if our $115 and our status as
students shouldn't entitle us to a
little more consideration than gen
eral public is apparently getting at
75 cents a seat. If this isn't agreed
with for any good reason—is there
any reason why it shouldn't be an
nounced that a limit of so many tick
ets will be available.
It was announced that tickets
would be available Monday and
Tuesday and over a hundred stu
dents were turned away by Tuesday
noon.
We feel this is a great injustice to
the students who have been looking
forward to this game and we also
feel it is entirely opposed to the
supposed spirit of college sports.

Can anything ho done so that wo can
get to that Cal-Stanfurd game?
