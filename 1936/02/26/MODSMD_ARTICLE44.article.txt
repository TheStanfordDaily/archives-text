# Victory Over Bears Looms As Spirit High
## Indians Down Two to Cal, Determined to Even Series Tor First Time in 15 Years 
### Phil Duffy 
Another day gone by and the
breath of some thousand Stanford
rooters, who were lucky enough to
j'•• t under the wire and buy ducats
to the California y.me, grows short
er as lli • significance of a win over
the Bears grows greater hour by
hour.
The fact that it is a sell-out
game, the first in three years,
shows that the campus is aroused
to a fever pitch that lias been
lacking in the support of the In
dian basketball team. Even the
wailing list of the hopefuls who
want to get a seat where there is
none, is unheard of on the Farm.
California has a 2 to 1 advantage
on us in games already this season.
Why that is no one seems to know.
The Indian:-: have demonstrated their
ability to make enough points to de
feat U.S.C. three out of four times,
which is a record in itself. And in
their favor also is the fact that they
won the fourth game from Troy after
looking lousy in losing the night be
fore.
Why, then, should they not win
on Friday night and establish an
other record by taking two games
from the Golden Bears? They won
from the Price coached team by
(litre points the lirst game here.
Why nt ram a few points down
the Bear throats and make them
like it? They did it to Stanford
twice in a row already, which
shows they are not in the least
afraid of the Indians.
Then why (again) the apparent
terror shown by the Stanford team
when they take to the floor against
the Bears? We have a far better
basketball team than California al
though they have not yet proven
that fact. Friday night is their
chance. The Berkeley team plays
the same type of game always; they
vary less than any other team in the
conference, and yet the Stanford
bunch doesn't seem to get used to
their play.
The whole question is whether
Stanford can go on the floor this
Friday night in a confident mood;
whether they can play the brand of
baskctbr.il they are capable of; or
whether they are going to stand
flat-footed and watch the Califor
nians pile up 60 points.
