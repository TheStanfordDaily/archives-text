Sequoia I. last season's all-year
champs, took the League VIII
championship last night by defeating
Sigma Nu 27-20 in a rough game.
Sigma Nu, undefeated until last
night, fought to the last, and gave a
game closer than the score would in
dicate.
Delta Chi also finished the season
undefeated and winner of League
IV by dint of a 78-15 win over Se
quoia 11. Mervyn Sullivan went hog
wild in scoring 44 points for a new
record, which puts him in the lead
for the 3-game class totals.
Theta Chi I look Encina !!E by
.10-27, in a play-off to determine a
winner of League 111. The game was
well played from start to finish, and
ended in the same score that the
two teams made in their regular
1. ague game. Theta Chi will meet
D.U. for the league crown.
Modern battleships are steered
by means of a switch-box similar to
electric street car controls.
