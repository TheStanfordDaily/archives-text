MIGAWD, A
BASKETBALL SELLOUT!

Who'd ever a thunk it. By noon
yesterday Stanford, the college with
no college spirit, had sold out tickets
for the Cal basketball game. More
than 1000 of them, at 40 cents per.
Now if those 1000 plus individ
uals can do a little topnotch
larynx-exercising Friday night
while the casaba is being juggled
about on the hardwood, we may be
able to promote a little jinx pa
vilion of our own. a parallel to the
Berkeley lioo and Jinx Pavilion.
The latter edifice, you will recall,
is run, in regard to Stanford hoop
teams at least, by the motto,
Can't Happen Here," by Sinclair
Hooey.
So we'll see you there Friday
night, if you've got a ticket, and we'll
see if it can happen HERE, to freeze
Cal out, and perhaps get a little
jaunt to Berlin for the boys.
ANOTHER BIG WEEK-ENI) is
offing. The basketball game, the In
door Invitational Track Meet to
morrow night, Nort Thornton's
Olympics-Fund Swimming Festival
Saturday afternoon, boxers going to
Washington State, baseball confer
ence opening if trie pollywogs and
skippers will scram from the in

field, intramural hoop wind-up, ten
nis, golf, rugby, frosh sports, and
possibly even a little fencing. You
I can never tell about fencing.
TIIE FAN SHAPED CITY: Be
fore it gets too hackneyed, here's a
squib anent the Los Angeles-Fan-
Salinas controversy, about which
most of (he tumult and shouting has
died down by now.
Gordy Frost, the last Sideline
Slantsman, was over identifying
some football pictures at the Quad.
1 He was sailing along fine, getting all
j the names right and all, till he came
j upon one, a photo of the U.S.F.
\ game, that was so butched up and
| blurred you couldn't tell whether
it was a scrimmage pile-up or a
local jolly-up.
Now, Gordy is from San Diego,
one of the better known Los Angeles
j suburbs, and has the old L.A. Cham
j ber of Commerce attitude. He sees
l that the picture was taken in Kezar
I Stadium, up in the city, and he also
; sees his chance for a keen dagger
j cut at S.F.
Co ho says to the Quad man, sez
zee "That's simple. Just charge the
i blurriness to the San Francisco fog
j and you'll have the caption, the pic
j ture, and the atmosphere tie-in."

MIGAWD, A
BASKETBALL SELLOUT!

Who'd ever a thunk it. By noon
yesterday Stanford, the college with
no college spirit, had sold out tickets
for the Cal basketball game. More
than 1000 of them, at 40 cents per.
Now if those 1000 plus individ
uals can do a little topnotch
larynx-exercising Friday night
while the casaba is being juggled
about on the hardwood, we may be
able to promote a little jinx pa
vilion of our own. a parallel to the
Berkeley lioo and Jinx Pavilion.
The latter edifice, you will recall,
is run, in regard to Stanford hoop
teams at least, by the motto,
Can't Happen Here," by Sinclair
Hooey.
So we'll see you there Friday
night, if you've got a ticket, and we'll
see if it can happen HERE, to freeze
Cal out, and perhaps get a little
jaunt to Berlin for the boys.
