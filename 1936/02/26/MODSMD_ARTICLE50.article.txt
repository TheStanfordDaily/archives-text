### 
Indian ruggers will run up against
a strong aggregation of former var
sity players when they play the
Palo Alio All-Blacks this afternoon
at 4 o'clock on the frosh field.

The All-Blacks are composed
chiefly of alumni now enrolled in
the law and med schools, have a
long string of victories to their credit
and are expected to give Coach Jim
Wylie's men a stiff match. Next
Saturday the varsity will take on
the University Club, a California
alumni team, in the stadium, and
will have its big gpme with Califor
nia one week later.

Lily Pons, the opera singer, has a
town named after her called Lily
pons, in Maryland, noted for its
water lily industry.
