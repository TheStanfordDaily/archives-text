# Hank Luisetti Out of Hospital; Quade Injured
## 
### 
Both good and bad news was
released last night to Indian bas
ketball fans concerning injuries to
players.
The good news is that Ilank.
Luisetti, who has onlj a slightly
infected leg abrasion, will leave
I the hospital this morning. The
star forward should be at his best
for the Bears Friday night.
Less welcome is the report that
i Bill Quade. who suffered torn
knee ligaments in the second Tro
jan game down south, is definitely
out for the season. Like Luisetti,
the sub forward was confined to
i the hospital yesterday.
