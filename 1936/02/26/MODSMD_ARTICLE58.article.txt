## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" Co-operation Through Criticism B.A.C. Tried To Give Students Break, But Pavilion's Capacity Is Limited 
### 
There is an ear-rending inoan reverberating
around the campus as a result of the selling
out of Cal basketball game rooters' tickets
yesterday. Students with memories of a ticket
sell-out at Hig (lame time are feeling that the
Ii.A.C. luis been conspiring against them in
honor of the profit motive.

In this last instance, however, it appears
that the Ii.A.C.. is not greatly at fault. A
sell-out in the gym is unprecedented. The
Ii.A.C. budgeted 950 rooters' tickets for Stan
ford, and 9.)0 for Cal. Monday night, when it
s;iw that the demand was going to be larger
than expected, il closed the sale on general ad
missions, refused a request for '2f>o more lick
els from Berkeley, and opened all available
admissions to local students.
II is unfortunate that many of the ardent
supporters will have to cool their heels around
the hearth while they listen to the tide of
battle on the radio. Hut under the circum
stances it seems that the Ii.A.C. acted as well
as could l>e expected. Miracles can't always
be expected from the money magnates.
