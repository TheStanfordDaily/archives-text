# In Which a Scholar Steals the Show
## 
### 
"The business of these other men oil the
platform tonight is to gel into the papers, mine
is to stay out of them." And so saying, Dr.
Hay Lyman Wilbur last night stole the show
from a group of glib publicity men who capi
talize on this business of Ali-Amcrican teams.
Throughout all the hullahalloo, the hand
clapping, the whoop-te-do, he was one who
remained the consummate master of his situ
ation. While our stalwart leaders of gridiron
youth buttoned and unbuttoned their vests,
fidgeted, and made vague motions, the scholar
sat quietly awaiting his turn.
When the time came he played the part of
the polished actor. With a subtle blend of
such good-theater as forgetting Mr. Robert
(irayson's name, mixed with the pointed phi
losophy of a cool analytical mind, he domi

nuted his audience.
These illuminating phrases and the occa
sional brilliant flashes exhibited by him in
his few public contacts with the students may
be one reason why things have been quietly
accomplished around Stanford, why students
get an education here —when, all the while,
the people who glean their information from
the papers that "it is my business to keep out
of" think that all the students do is play foot
ball and get in auto wrecks.
"For all this, there is no particular credit
due him perhaps, but congratulations are in
order to I lie nervous system with which he
was born."
