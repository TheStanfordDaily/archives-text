'"Hell, in four years he'll be as unpopular as Hoo- j
ver," said a cantankerous business manager of a j
Southern California newspaper in November, 1932.
That cynic wasn't quite right, but people don't |
sneer at him as much for that remark as they once did. I
For Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd Headman of i
these United States, is no longer the fair-haired lad
and darling of all that he was after his election in late j
'32 and through the palmy days of 1933.
In fact, the President's star has fallen so markedly
in recent months that observers who once pondered
the size of his re-election margin are now settling down
to figure the result of the '36 campaign.
The cynic noted above saw the quick shifts of senti- !
inent possible in a country which swept Hoover in by
an unprecedented margin with even the South sup
porting in 1928, only +o send him to stunning defeat !
lour years later.
* * * *
Nastiest-looking sock the New Deal has gotten
politically for quite a while came from the impartial
Literary Digest po'l, which has ranked high in popular
fancy since calling F.R.'s '32 Hoovericidc within %
of 1 per cent.
In 1934 the New Deal had 61.2 per cent of the coun
try behind it, the Digest tabulations showed, yet the
poll taken as the present year came in showed 62.7
per cent as no longer favoring New Deal acts.
Even though it is well known that F.R.'s personal
popularity has consistently exceeded tha't of his poli
cies, the Digest returns wore a black eye in anybody's .
dogfight. Many quarters lost no time in trying to fill
;he figures full of holes.
* * * *
It was pointed out that even if Mr. Roosevelt were i
not personally liked by election time, by then the j
(ji.O.P. ("Good Old Prosperity") outfit would have j
named some reactionary nonentity, and the voters j
would pin their hopes on F.R. as the lesser evil.
Further, it was mentioned that Democratic weak
ness was not necessarily Republican strength—almost J
a truism. Also, it was held that the Digest sampling
was too loaded with middle-class addresses; this factor j
may have been unimportant in 1932 when F.H. was an |
all-class mania, but is vital today when business is j
girding its loins.
* * * *
If popularity equalled electoral votes, the Digest '
findings from nearly 2.000.000 returns would give the
incumbent only 132 of the 531. The American Institute j
of Public Opinion poll, however, puts 26 states with j
239 votes in the Democrats' column plus 5 borderline j
Democratic states, whose 39 votes would put F.R. j
back in by 25 electoral votes.
This poll, too, reflects a lessened liking for the !
President, who gained a few popular votes during De- i
cember and January after a November low, but with
the gains registered solely in his own Solid South. 1
0 * • * * I
New England sympathy has been swinging rapidly j
from the New Deal, with a 2 to 5 per cent loss per j
>tate in the last couple of months. In Illinois, Roose
velt dropped 9 points; in New York, 7.
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas have been j
getting "anti-" even faster with 11 to 15 per cent losses j
per state. Whether this progressive Farmer-Labor j
trength will go to the Republicans in disgust or to a I
barely possible third party is a matter of conjecture.
* * * *
Liberty Leaguers would doubtless be glad to back- ;
pat themselves and their broadsides for starting F.R. I
on the downhill slide, but such credit does not seem
logically forthcoming. Shrewd guessers are more wont j
to lay it to disappointment of labor and the unem- I
ployed, whose treatment by the New Deal fell far !
: hort of their high expectations.
♦ * * *
Make no mistake, Mr. Roosevelt is by no means out.
He's waning, yes, but he's .still a potent and plenty
canny gentleman, as we shall see tomorrow. I

That cynic wasn't quite right, but people don't |
sneer at him as much for that remark as they once did. I
For Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd Headman of i
these United States, is no longer the fair-haired lad
and darling of all that he was after his election in late j
'32 and through the palmy days of 1933.
In fact, the President's star has fallen so markedly
in recent months that observers who once pondered
the size of his re-election margin are now settling down
to figure the result of the '36 campaign.
The cynic noted above saw the quick shifts of senti- !
inent possible in a country which swept Hoover in by
an unprecedented margin with even the South sup
porting in 1928, only +o send him to stunning defeat !
lour years later.

Nastiest-looking sock the New Deal has gotten
politically for quite a while came from the impartial
Literary Digest po'l, which has ranked high in popular
fancy since calling F.R.'s '32 Hoovericidc within %
of 1 per cent.
In 1934 the New Deal had 61.2 per cent of the coun
try behind it, the Digest tabulations showed, yet the
poll taken as the present year came in showed 62.7
per cent as no longer favoring New Deal acts.
Even though it is well known that F.R.'s personal
popularity has consistently exceeded tha't of his poli
cies, the Digest returns wore a black eye in anybody's .
dogfight. Many quarters lost no time in trying to fill

It was pointed out that even if Mr. Roosevelt were i
not personally liked by election time, by then the j
(ji.O.P. ("Good Old Prosperity") outfit would have j
named some reactionary nonentity, and the voters j
would pin their hopes on F.R. as the lesser evil.
Further, it was mentioned that Democratic weak
ness was not necessarily Republican strength—almost J
a truism. Also, it was held that the Digest sampling
was too loaded with middle-class addresses; this factor j
may have been unimportant in 1932 when F.H. was an |
all-class mania, but is vital today when business is j
girding its loins.

If popularity equalled electoral votes, the Digest '
findings from nearly 2.000.000 returns would give the
incumbent only 132 of the 531. The American Institute j
of Public Opinion poll, however, puts 26 states with j
239 votes in the Democrats' column plus 5 borderline j
Democratic states, whose 39 votes would put F.R. j
back in by 25 electoral votes.
This poll, too, reflects a lessened liking for the !

Nastiest-looking sock the New Deal has gotten
politically for quite a while came from the impartial
Literary Digest po'l, which has ranked high in popular
fancy since calling F.R.'s '32 Hoovericidc within %
of 1 per cent.
In 1934 the New Deal had 61.2 per cent of the coun
try behind it, the Digest tabulations showed, yet the
poll taken as the present year came in showed 62.7
per cent as no longer favoring New Deal acts.
Even though it is well known that F.R.'s personal
popularity has consistently exceeded tha't of his poli
cies, the Digest returns wore a black eye in anybody's .
dogfight. Many quarters lost no time in trying to fill
;he figures full of holes.

It was pointed out that even if Mr. Roosevelt were i
not personally liked by election time, by then the j
(ji.O.P. ("Good Old Prosperity") outfit would have j
named some reactionary nonentity, and the voters j
would pin their hopes on F.R. as the lesser evil.
Further, it was mentioned that Democratic weak
ness was not necessarily Republican strength—almost J
a truism. Also, it was held that the Digest sampling
was too loaded with middle-class addresses; this factor j
may have been unimportant in 1932 when F.H. was an |
all-class mania, but is vital today when business is j

If popularity equalled electoral votes, the Digest '
findings from nearly 2.000.000 returns would give the
incumbent only 132 of the 531. The American Institute j
of Public Opinion poll, however, puts 26 states with j
239 votes in the Democrats' column plus 5 borderline j
Democratic states, whose 39 votes would put F.R. j
back in by 25 electoral votes.
This poll, too, reflects a lessened liking for the !
President, who gained a few popular votes during De- i
cember and January after a November low, but with
the gains registered solely in his own Solid South. 1

'"Hell, in four years he'll be as unpopular as Hoo- j
ver," said a cantankerous business manager of a j
Southern California newspaper in November, 1932.
That cynic wasn't quite right, but people don't |
sneer at him as much for that remark as they once did. I
For Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd Headman of i
these United States, is no longer the fair-haired lad
and darling of all that he was after his election in late j
'32 and through the palmy days of 1933.
In fact, the President's star has fallen so markedly
in recent months that observers who once pondered
the size of his re-election margin are now settling down
to figure the result of the '36 campaign.
The cynic noted above saw the quick shifts of senti- !
inent possible in a country which swept Hoover in by
