Mexican Laborer, Kicked in Nose, Smells

Our Hasher Stepped on by Worm, Knocked Silly
This period which Stanford students are passing
through is known not as the nitrogen cycle, or the
life cycle of the liver fluke, or a colloidal dye effective
in treating pernicious anemia and evoking reticulocy
tosis in guinea pigs, hereditary congenital ptosis, or
chronic bronchial stenosis, or hysteresis in the hydra
tion and dehydration of gels (some of these were pub
lished by our faculty during the past year, and are we
proud!) but simply as the mid-year blah. Every
winter quarter about this time, metabolism slips to
a new low, and people don't stir out from behind
radiators or encyclopedias. If people get drunk and
there is a great deal of statistical evidence that people
never do, they do it in a quiet fashion. Even the
radiators in the Libe whisper before they shout. All
the departments always give their heaviest courses
during this time of year, hoping to sneak up on the
students and trap them before they wake up. Judging
by yesterday's little performance, there is actually a
sun in the sky, and it is hoped that there will be a few
curtain calls. But taken all in all, the campus is in
hibernation. •
As a sample of this unconditional surrender to
education, I offer the story of a man who was hunting
for a pair of dice in Sequoia recently. And why was he
hunting for dice? No, not for sport, but for a statistics
course on the mathematics of probabilities or some
thing. And what is more: This guy looked all over the
hall of Sequoia and could not find one pair of the
galloping bones, and finally had to make a pair of his
own. *
•
Over in the biology department the instructors are
so bored by it all that they study all night long.
As soon as 2 o'clock comes around, the profs gather
around and startle each other by climbing up on the
roof and dropping oranges down the ventilators into
their colleagues office. have this on direct authority
from the janitorial department, which doesn't think so
much of the practice.

Our Hasher Stepped on by Worm, Knocked Silly
This period which Stanford students are passing
through is known not as the nitrogen cycle, or the
life cycle of the liver fluke, or a colloidal dye effective
in treating pernicious anemia and evoking reticulocy
tosis in guinea pigs, hereditary congenital ptosis, or
chronic bronchial stenosis, or hysteresis in the hydra
tion and dehydration of gels (some of these were pub
lished by our faculty during the past year, and are we
proud!) but simply as the mid-year blah. Every
winter quarter about this time, metabolism slips to
a new low, and people don't stir out from behind
radiators or encyclopedias. If people get drunk and
there is a great deal of statistical evidence that people
never do, they do it in a quiet fashion. Even the
radiators in the Libe whisper before they shout. All
the departments always give their heaviest courses
during this time of year, hoping to sneak up on the
students and trap them before they wake up. Judging
by yesterday's little performance, there is actually a
sun in the sky, and it is hoped that there will be a few
curtain calls. But taken all in all, the campus is in
hibernation. •
As a sample of this unconditional surrender to
education, I offer the story of a man who was hunting
for a pair of dice in Sequoia recently. And why was he
hunting for dice? No, not for sport, but for a statistics
course on the mathematics of probabilities or some
thing. And what is more: This guy looked all over the
hall of Sequoia and could not find one pair of the
galloping bones, and finally had to make a pair of his
own. *

Over in the biology department the instructors are
so bored by it all that they study all night long.
As soon as 2 o'clock comes around, the profs gather
around and startle each other by climbing up on the
roof and dropping oranges down the ventilators into
their colleagues office. have this on direct authority
from the janitorial department, which doesn't think so
much of the practice.
