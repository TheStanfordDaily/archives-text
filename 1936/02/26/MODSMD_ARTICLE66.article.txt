# Faultless Cast Aids Nazimova In Ibsen Play
## 
### 
"GHOSTS," Ibsen's harrowing |
problem play now running at the |
Cur ran Theater, provides an ex
cellent vehicle for Mme Nazimova's I

intense, impeccable,
acting. Despite the i
fact that the play it
self is more or less !
outmoded, M rh e .
Nazimova and a
faultless cast man-

age to make this drama live.
Steeped in an atmosphere of re
pressed horror, '"Ghosts" is con- j
cerned with "the sins of the fathers"
that "are visited on the children."
Harry Ellerbe, as "Oswald Alving," :
the unfortunate son, gives a per- j
formance second only to that of
Nazimova. The final scene, in which
he goes mad, strains the audience al- j
most to the breaking point, so real
istic is his portrayal.

Mme. Nazimova's ability as a di
rector does not equal her acting skill.
Several high-points of the play
lose thoir power because of poor
staging, as when "Oswald"' is com
pletely hidden from the audience by
a high-backed chair during an im
passioned speech. The single set, by
Stuart Chaney, is up to his usual
high standard. —B. Sweet
