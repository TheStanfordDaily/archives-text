## STRONG BACKS, STRONG MINDS 
### 
Lust night Stanford's gridiron
greats got more applause, more
adulation, more honors from those

whose word is as
scripture in the
kingdom of
sports.
They took their
distinction with a
smile, but if their
eyes had had just
the slightest lack-

lustre, no one could blame them.
For these honors, together with
reams oi newspaper publicity anent :
football triumph, appear as a convic- j
tion of stupidity to America's busi- ;
ness men. It has been so ever since
the birth of the popular notion that
weak minds inevitably accompany
strong backs.

stead of perpetuating them?
Do you know that our apparently
holy grading system is not indig- :
enous to America, moreover, that it J
is un-American . . . for it is de- i
structive of spirit even though it be j
beneficial to university regimenta- I
| tion?
Do you admit that an excellent
| chemist may be a very poor mem- ;
I orizer of formulae and that many a 1
i "born" teacher may not succeed in j
j obtaining the required B average?
j Do you realize that subjects like
literature, art, philosophy, music,
| etc., can be virtually suffocated and j
] killed by your wonderful "prepa
ration for later adjustments?"

Former footballers, now hopeless- j
ly messing in bargain basement lin- j
gerie counters, in sheer desperation,
taking a job wiping windshields, I
will tell you that football was their 1
downfall. Business men in a position
to give decent jobs at decent salaries
look askance at the hulking six
footer whose most publicized recom
mendation is his ability to run like ;
the devil or scientifically knock |
people down.
To them, a bulging bicep is a sure
guarantee of a shriveled and anaemic !
brain, and a scrap-book full of
sports writers' laudation is evidence !
per se that the ex-footballer is ut- I
terly incapable of mental touch
downs.

True, an outstanding scholastic j
record has often overcome the I
damning evidence of gridiron fame, |
but the average player who gets i
average grades and can certainly i I
think fairly well, will be judged !
and condemned on his ball-playing J |
ability.
That the unreasoning prejudice j
I of the employer is unjust seems in
i controvertible to us, who have ac
; tually seen footballers hitting the
j classroom line. We know that foot
i ball is only apparently an all-muscle
1 activity, that actually it requires as !
much brain-sweat as it does ordi- |
nary perspiration. Further, we have j
j seen football greats not only deter- !
1 mine class average, but often hit the j
' scholastic high-spots, dragging !
i down A's despite the exhaustion at- j
i tendant upon daily practice and
j Saturday games.
It is no pretty rationalization that j
footballers, by and large, should do ;
as well earning a salary as playing
i a game. And it is certainly equally '
true that business men, when they j

refuse jobs because of mere preju- |
1 dice against physical prowess, are

helping to give the color of truth to
their false belief.
Footballers deserve jobs as much
as any business school Phi Bete.
That they do not get them is a re
flection on the weak-minded em
ployer, not on the strong-backed
player. â€”Bob Eisenbach
