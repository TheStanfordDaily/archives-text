# Heifetz Deplores Federal Neglect Of Musicians
## Declares European Method Of Training Performers More Complete Than American 
### 
''Music—one of the major indus
tries—has been utterly neglected by
the government," according to Vio
linist Jascha Heifetz, who will ap
pear tomorrow night in the Stanford
Pavilion.
"Every other industry has been
taken care of with codes and what
not," the artist explained, "and this
is the only country of importance in
the World where the government
doesn't aid music financially. There
are probably 5000 unemployed mu
sicians in New York City alone, he
said. "The United States govern
ment should subsidize music."
Subsidized Music
We haven't anything here to com
pare to the subsidized music fes
tivals in Holland, Salzburg, and
elsewhere in Europe, he declared,
urging the establishment of a great
national music conservatory in New
York. Supported by the govern
ment, the school would offer a gen
eral all-around musical education.
Stressing this point, Heifetz, who
studied at the Conservatory of St.
Petersburg, said that students there
weren't considered properly taught
if they knew only their own instru
ment. The violinists, for example,
had to learn to play well, if not
brilliantly, the piano, harp, and
viola.
Thorough Education
Backed by harmony and counter
point, the students became expert
theoretical as well as practical mu
sicians. "But that was not enough,"
Heifetz said. "The curriculum in
cluded ail the arts—poetry, dance,
literature, and the drama—so that
when a young student was finally
graduated from the St. Petersburg
Conservatory, he emerged, not only
a finished musician, but a human
being of background and culture."
The violinist is himself a gifted
composer. Although he has never
revealed his original works, his
transcriptions for violin and piano
are familiar items on his concert
programs.
Tickets for Heifetz's coming con
cert here are obtainable at Keeble's
in Palo Alto, or at the Concert
Office in the Old Union.
