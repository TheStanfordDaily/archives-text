# Masquers Read Original Plays
## Campus Talent Presents Three One-act Dramas; Show Light, Serious, Sparkling Treatment 
### Henrietta Jones 
Last night in the Little Theater
Masquers presented a well directed
reading of three original one-act
plays.
"Arizona Gal," by Ruth Teiser, af
forded lively entertainment as the
opening play on the program. This
"farce of the Far West" is very light,
rather unpolished, familiar to every
one in plot and foim, but nonethe
less very amusing.
Clark Hero
Fred Clark, the noble hero, Nancy
Scoggins, the fair heroine, and Dick
Dawson, the villain, read in rich
burlesque, while Curtis Barnes and
Gordon Williams helped to make the
performance swift-moving, gay,
farcical. Rosemary Benet's adroit
reading of the clever stage directions
won applause.
"Always a Star," by Johnson Hill,
is « more serious drama, involving
the attempted comeback of a still
lovely actress. The play provides a
certain emotional tension, but the
climax is not clearly pointed, and
the plot is loosely organized.
Corson Star
Phyllis Corson's interpretation of
the actress was smooth and glamor
ous, but lacked sufficient restraint
and depth. Warren Rockwell was
good as the star's sympathetic
, would-be fiance, while the support
| ing cast did as well as possible with
' the loose dialogue.
"Three and a Match," by Kay Ar
j thur, is an excellent adaptation of
j the current short story by Elisa
Bialk. It is sophisticated comedy,
' built about a rather clever twist to
I the eternal theme of the eternal
triangle.
The two womenVs parts, played by
■ Phyllis Boothe and Euphemia Smith,
I were subtly drawn, and Jim Corner
was thoroughly boyish as the ego
tistical artist.
