# Heifetz Appears On Farm First Time Tonight
## Concert To Feature Violinist's Own Compositions; Historic Instrument Will Be Played 
### 
Jascha Heifetz, violinist extraor
dinary, makes his first Farm appear
ance tonight at 8 o'clock in the Pa
vilion.
A composer himself, Heifetz will
play four of the 40 transcriptions he
has completed, with Emanuel Bay at

the piano. Major works on the pro
gram are Beethoven's C Minor so
nata and the D Minor Concerto of
Wieniawski.
The schedule for the artist's West
ern appearance has been a crowded
oneâ€”for in the last 10 days he has
played in San Francisco, Tuscon,
Carmel, and Los Angeles.
Having been four times around
the world giving concerts, Heifetz is
described as being "at the top" of
his art. But according to the artist
himself such a description is mis
leading, for he is still climbing, he
says, and expects to continue climb
ing as long as he plays the violin.
In his concert tonight, Heifetz will
play one of his two favorite violins,
the Stradivarius or the Guarnerius,
both of which he takes with him on
all his tours.
The Guarnerius, made in 1742, at
one time belonged to Wilhelmj, the
German violinist who toured the
country 50 years ago, and before
that was the property of Ferdi
nan David, famous artist' of the last
century. Known as the "David
Guarnerius," it is listed in all cata
logues of historic instryments.
Dated 11 years earlier, Heifetz'
"Strad" is especially valuable to
him, since it has been bound up with
his career. When he first came to
New York from Europe it was
loaned to him, and bought by him
as soon as he had the money.
Tickets are still available at Kee
ble's in Palo Alto and at the Concert
Series Office. Concert Manager
Naomi Carpenter asks that all lost
tickets be reported before the per
formance to the Concert Series Of
fice, in the old Union.
