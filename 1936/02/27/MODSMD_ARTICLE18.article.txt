# Debate Team Discusses Court
## Bob Hartmann, Bob Adams Meet Lemoyne College Students In Non-decision Controversy 
### 
John Jones and Robert Green of
Lemoyne College upheld the finality
of Supreme Court decision last
night in a non-decision debate
against Bob Adams and Bob Hart
mann of Stanford in the Assembly
Hall. Boris Alexander, coach of the
Negro team, was chairman of the
discussion.
Question Slated
Expressive of the "quotationed"
type of argument used by the visit
ing team was Bob Hartmann's com
ment in the final rebuttal speech,
"We knew when we came on to the
stage this evening that we were go
ing to match wits with two brilliant
speakers, but we had no "idea we
would have to debate against Pat
rick Henry, Samuel Adams, Profes
sor Frankfort, and a host of others!"
Formal statement of the question
is: "Resolved, that Congress should
be allowed by a two-thirds major
ity vote to over-ride a decision of
the Supreme Court, declaring an act
of Congress unconstitutional."
Affirmative Argument
Main argument of the affirmative
was that the constitution was not
drawn up as a rigid set of laws to
curtail progress of a posterity whose
civilization set-up was far in ad
vance to that of the time the docu
ment was written.
Alexander said in response to the
welcome made to the Lemoyne team
by Wayne Richardson. Stanford de
bate manager, "We have heard about
the beauty of the Stanford campus,
but this is one of those few times
when words fail 1o describe that
beauty."
