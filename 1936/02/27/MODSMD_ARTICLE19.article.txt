Mrs. Timothy Hopkins has re
cently made an important Rift of
books to the Library under an ar
rangement providing $500 a year for
the immediate development of the
Hopkins Transportation Library, ac
cording to an announcement by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday.
Shortly before his death last Jan
uary, Mr. Hopkins had made plans
i for further development of the Hop
kins library, and had provided for
its future by a bequest which will
eventually provide an income of
$4000 a year.
Among the several books given by
Mrs. Hopkins this month is a copy
of the first edition of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge's "Sibylline Leaves," con
taining marginalia by the author.
A copy of Burnet's "Life of Bishop
Bedell" is similarly annotated by the
author.
