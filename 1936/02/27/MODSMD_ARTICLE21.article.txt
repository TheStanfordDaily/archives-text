# Practice Session Reveals Hank Luisetti Fit for Bear Tilt; Art Stoefen Hurts Ankle Slightly
## 
### Roger Kimball 
"He sure wants to win this game,"
That was the consensus of opinion
regarding John Bunn, as expressed
by one member of the group watch
ing the Indian basketball mentor
scrimmage his team yesterday.
Not that the players aren't just
asanxious to beat California to
morrow night in the Pavilion. One
could tell that by their actions and
I expressions. Obviously enjoying
! themselves, they .showed a mixture
| of the "laughing boys" attitude and
real determination in just the right
proportion to bode no good for the
( Bears.
Stoefen Scare
A momentary scare occurred yes
terday as Art Stoefen crashed into
I a post, went down in a heap, and
! stayed there. Sighs of relief went
i up as the lanky center resumed
I practice, favoring a slightly tunied
' ankle for only a few minutes.
I Undisturbed by a bandage just
i above his left eye, Hank Luisetti
j was dropping them in as usual last
night. Hank was released from the
hospital yesterday morning, his leg
I infection a thing of the past.
Moore First String
Two good performances against
U.S.C. evidently won Captain Dinty
Moore his starting guard position
back for the Bear contest. The In
dian leader, a marked man in his

i ragged shirt, was hot on long shots
1 while working out with the first
! string.

Offensive practice without oppo
sition, for the regulars occupied the
I first part of the session. Luisetti,
j Moore, Stoeffen, Howie Turner, and
Jack Calderwood then took the floor
against a second team composed of
Ken Bell and H. B. Lee, forwards;
Ken Nobs center; and Bob Zonne
j and Sparky Robertson, guards.
Three Out of Four
First the regulars kept the ball,
| and then the reserves went on at
tack. In each case the defense made
| it hard for the other team to score,
I but surrendered the ball as soon as
| it got possession.
Shots and baskets were counted
â–  by a manager. Luisetti made three
out of four, and Stoeffen dropped
j in three out of seven. The regulars
I missed several so-called setups,
much to Bunn's disapproval.
