THE JAPANESE FUROR is only
understood by tracing the history of j
Japan (page anyone in Mr. Treat's ;
Far East).
Tiie outbreak unquestionably
comes from the traditional struggle j
in Japan between the militarists |
and the liberals or parliamentarians
for control of the empire. That
struggle has become much more
acute since the conquest of Man
chukuo by the militarists.
The outbreak is a natural devel
opment of the philosophy of the
Japanese army and navy that they
should rule the empire. This theory
is challenged by Japanese parlia
mentarians, and the two groups are
sincere enough in their beliefs to be
irreconcilable.
PRINCE ITO, known to all Japa
nese as the "Father of the Consti
tution," was one of the first to chal
lenge the militarists. He was as- J
sassinated by pro-militarists.
Premier Inukai challenged the
militarists again in 1932. He was■
assassinated.
NOW PREMIER OKADA chal
lenged them and he was assassi- ;
nated. Minister of Finance Taka
hauhi was injured and held a pris- j
oner because he controls the gov- j
eminent finance. He had to oppose
the demands of the army and the j
navy, and before the recent election j
which gave the liberals a thumping
victory over the militarists he ha
rangued the voters to oppose the i
militarists, revealing to the common '
people that they would, after all,
have to pay the bulk of the national i
expenditures and that the man of I
the street would bo the first to suf- j
fer in case of a war.

THE PARLIAMENTARIANS be
lieve that army control means a
dictatorship which cannot but lead
to a war in which Japan will be de
feated ?nd the empire ruined.

IN 1932 opposition to the army's
venture into Manchuria caused the
outbreak in May of that year. To
day, the army's preparations for a
war with Soviet Russia caused the
latest out break and the assassination
of Premier Okada and other high
monkey-monks.

TIIE MILITARISTS have always
believed that Japan's advances to
Asia have been much too slow. As
breath-taking as the Japanese
progress in China may seem to
Americans who took all of 27 years
to conquer and annex a 3000-mile
continent, the militarists actually
have been straining at the leash,
and believe their progress to be tor
tuously slow. They, the militarists,
are actually sore because the con
servative liberals did not let them
attack Russia four years ago when
she was "weaker."
FEW AMERICANS realize the in
dependence of the militarists from
the Emperor and his Cabinet. The
only control that the Cabinet ex
ercises over the military sector is
that of holding the purse strings.
But, should the cabinet fail to
vote an appropriation to the army
and navy, the previous year's bud
get automatically goes into effect.
The big controversies one hears
about each year are the struggles

of the army gang to get a larger
appropriation than the year before.
If they don't get an increase, they
at least get what they had the year
before; consequently, an increase
holds good for as long a time as the
army wishes it to, decreases in ap
propriation not be«ng effected un
less the army and navy gang agrees
to it. So the militarists can't miss.
If they don't get a bigger appro
priation, they at get what they
had the year before, if they get a
larger budget, all the better.
THE MAIN GRUDGES of the
militarists against the government
might be listed as- (1) The elder
statesmen of Tokyo frequently
stopped the advance of the Japa
nese army from pushing further into
China, (2) Tokyo sidestepped the
campaign for an independent North
China, (3) Tokyo won't allow the
army to advance into Outer Mon
golia and has been slow in letting it
penetrate Inner Mowgolia.

THE OMINOUS aspect of the
coup me%ns to many Japanese: War
with Russia in the Spring.
