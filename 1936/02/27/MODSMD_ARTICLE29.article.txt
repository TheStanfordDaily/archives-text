"Race against race, language
against language, religion against re
ligion"—wrote Albert Leon Guerard,
world eypert on international lan
guages F ; nd professor of general lit

It is fcr these reasons that pros
pective neutral languages have

Esperantists, like all other follow

above reproach.

* The life of Esperanto has been
lived four times and is at the thres

kept by a Slav element devoting
their time and interest to a small
magazine "La Esperantisto," which
was later published under a new
name, "Lingvo Internacia."
Afterwards, in 1898, the French
supported it, and immediately the
language took on a new expanse.

de Beaufront, who had already cre

and who discarded his plan to pro
mote the success of that of his rival,
then Dr. Zamenhof, Esperanto took
on a new life.
