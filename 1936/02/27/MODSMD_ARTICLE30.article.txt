# Radical Changes Directed at Two U.C. Professors
## District Attorney Asks Dismissal Of Radin, Conover for Talks Made in Communist Meeting 
### 
The discharge of two University
of California instructors was asked
of President SjJroul yesterday by
Leslie A. Cleary ot Modesto, dis
trict attorney of Stanislaus County.
In a letter to the president, dis
trict Attorney Cleary alleged that
Dr. Max Radin, professor of law,
and Henry Conover, assistant teach
er in economics, sympathize and
consort with those wishing to over
throw the government.
Both of the men deny the fact
that they are in any way connected
with communists or ever were.
Neither man seemed to view the
charge seriously.
President Sproul answered the
letter, thanking Mr. Cleary for his
"open" attack instead of an under
cover campaign, and promised action
after he has the "facts"in hand.
District Attorney Cleary specific
ally charged that Dr. Radin and
Mr. Conover had attended a San
Francisco mass meeting "directed
by Harry Bridges and his cohorts, for
the purpose of attempting to im
press upon the minds of the gath
ering that eight dynamiters, whom
I convicted of reckless possession of
dynamite, wei-e framed."
He also declared that the univer
sity men have been "engaging them
selves in addressing communist
meetings, and particularly in con
sorting with such people as Harry
Bridges and Ella Winter."
The retention of "such men" as
Mr. Conover and Dr. Radin, Cleary
called "nothing less than an outrage
to the intelligence of the people
who support the institution.'"

The third period, 1905-14, wit
nessed the world-wide development
of Zamenhof's creation by means of
an important periodical, the em
bryonic Parliament of Esperanto
land, and by the addition of new
organs to apply it to the needs of
commerce, industry, science, and
travel.
Conventions Held
It was in this period that there
were nine international conventions
which succeeded in attracting as
many as 1800 delegates from every
corner of the earth
World War and shattered nations
put Esperanto into its most obscure
era. Periodical circulation and in
ternational conferences dwindled.
Perhaps it was fortunate for Dr.
Zamenhof that he died on April 1/,
1917.
