j THE SUN SHINES THROUGH
j FOR BASEBALL, TRACK
After raining straight for 15 days
| and 15 nights around here, things
j are looking up, the sun is shining
j through, and it's coming up dry and
| warm. Which is very fine for sports
j and outdoors lovers, but not so con
i ducive to sitting here and abstractly
; fingering the Underwood.
| But this fine Los Angeles weather
i comes just in time. Baseball, track,
| and polo boys can now play in time
| for the conference ball opener yes
terday at Moraga and the track meet
| tonight, and polo later on.
The first indoor meet was spon
: sored by the Examiner, tonight's by
the Call-Bull. Which should bring
! about a little change in the type of
' medals the place-winners get.
Last time the athletes "got little
i metal shields, three fourths of the
i space on which said SAN FRAN
CISCO EXAMINER. MONARCH
j OF THE DAILIES, with tiny letters
j at the bottom saying third place
| mile, etc.
Stanford's 12 inviteds will be up
j there viring with the best in the
i West, plus a few others like Shuf
flin' Joe MeCluskey, Glenn Cun
ningham, Floyd Lochner, Walter
Marty, Corne Johnson, Chuck Horn
bostel, Elroy Robinson, and Norm
i Bright.
For the Cardinal forces, chances
| of winning events, or of coming
j pretty near, are given Jim Reynolds
in the shot, Sam Klopstock in the
hurdles, Ed (Phor Lap) Burrows in
the two-mile, Bill McCurdy in the
i 600, Humbert Smith in the high

jump, and Jack Weiershauser in the j
300.
Jim Kneubuhl, the soph sprinter
from Pago Pago, has been under
wraps so far this year, but don't ;
doubt his ability in the 440 later on. j
SPORTATORIAL: Volleyball
should be reinstated as an intra
mural sport.
Everyone around here who's j
ever played it likes to play it.
You don't need any special phys- '
ical attributes or speed or hardi- '
ness to be comfortably good at it, !
there's a little knack of working
the ball up to the front line an>*
then hurtling it over, and it's tun
because there arc about 15 people
right in the radius of about 20 feet,
so there are plenty of opportuni
ties for razzing the other fellows
and cracking wive, and all in all
it's an enjoyable half-hour spent.

j THE SUN SHINES THROUGH
j FOR BASEBALL, TRACK
After raining straight for 15 days
| and 15 nights around here, things
j are looking up, the sun is shining
j through, and it's coming up dry and
| warm. Which is very fine for sports
j and outdoors lovers, but not so con
i ducive to sitting here and abstractly
; fingering the Underwood.
| But this fine Los Angeles weather
i comes just in time. Baseball, track,
| and polo boys can now play in time
| for the conference ball opener yes
terday at Moraga and the track meet
| tonight, and polo later on.
The first indoor meet was spon
: sored by the Examiner, tonight's by
the Call-Bull. Which should bring
! about a little change in the type of
' medals the place-winners get.
Last time the athletes "got little
i metal shields, three fourths of the
i space on which said SAN FRAN
CISCO EXAMINER. MONARCH
j OF THE DAILIES, with tiny letters
j at the bottom saying third place
| mile, etc.
Stanford's 12 inviteds will be up
j there viring with the best in the
i West, plus a few others like Shuf
flin' Joe MeCluskey, Glenn Cun
ningham, Floyd Lochner, Walter
Marty, Corne Johnson, Chuck Horn
bostel, Elroy Robinson, and Norm
i Bright.
For the Cardinal forces, chances
| of winning events, or of coming
j pretty near, are given Jim Reynolds
in the shot, Sam Klopstock in the
hurdles, Ed (Phor Lap) Burrows in
the two-mile, Bill McCurdy in the
i 600, Humbert Smith in the high

jump, and Jack Weiershauser in the j
300.
Jim Kneubuhl, the soph sprinter
from Pago Pago, has been under
wraps so far this year, but don't ;
doubt his ability in the 440 later on. j
SPORTATORIAL: Volleyball
should be reinstated as an intra
mural sport.
Everyone around here who's j
ever played it likes to play it.
You don't need any special phys- '
ical attributes or speed or hardi- '
ness to be comfortably good at it, !
