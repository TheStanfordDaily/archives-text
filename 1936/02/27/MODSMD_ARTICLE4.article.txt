endowment funds in corporation stocks.)

Comptroller of Stanford University
Copyright, 1936, by Stanford Daily
The decision by Judge William F.
James in the matter of the petition
of the trustees of Stanford University
for confirmation of its power
to invest in corporate stocks and de
bentures, is one of great importance
not alone to Stanford, but to all uni
versities and endowed institutions.
Because of the nation-wide in
terest in this case and its importance
to the University, the Stanford Stu
dent Body should understand the
reason for filing the petition and
the significance of Judge James'
well-considered decision.
Founding Grant
As a background for a discussion
of this suit, something should be
said concerning the original Found
ing Grant and the limitations there
in provided. The original Stanford
Founding Grant is a remarkable
document. The more it is studied,
in the light of experience, the more
one is impressed with the vision of
fine judgement of Senator Stanford.
Among its most striking features
are the broad powers granted to the
trustees, and the almost complete
absence of limitations or restrictions
upon the management of the trust
or the future development of the
university. In fact, the original
grant contained one important re
striction only, i.e. a restraint against
the sale of any portion of the original
Palo Alto Stock Farm upon which
the campus is situated.
Second Restriction
The experience of other univer
sities which, in the absence of any
such restriction, have prematurely
sold valuable land subsequently re
quired for campus purposes, would
indicate that this limitation was a
wise one.
After Senator Stanford's death,
Mrs. Stanford imposed a second im
portant restriction upon the man
agement of the University, by re
questing the Board of Trustees to
limit the number of women students
in attendance to five hundred. In
cidentally, it should be noted that
the original Founding Grant, which
was executed by both Senator and
Mrs. Stanford, contained no limi
tation on the number of women, but
on the contrary contained this pro
vision:
Restriction Raised
The Trustees shall have the power,
and it shall be their duty ... to af
ford equal facilities and give equal
| advantages in the University to both
I the sexes.

On May 11, 1933 the Board of
Trustees removed the limitation on
the number of women students by
the simple process of a Resolution
of the Board and without resorting
to Court action.
No Third Limitation
For many years the public and
the Board of Trustees have as
sumed that a third important re-

striction existed, i.e., requirement
that the University's endowment be
invested in bonds only. The decis
ion by Judge James is to the effect
that no such restriction on the pow
er of investment is contained in the
Founding Grant o rany of the
amendments thereto, nor is any such
restriction imposed by the general
Jaw of this state, relating to the
powers and obligations of trustees.
As a result of the Board resolution
and the decision by Judge James,
removing the limitation on the num
ber or the power of investment, the
only remaining important restric
tion on the powers of the trustees,
is that relating to the sale of the
Palo Alto Stock Fai'm.
Cases Not Parallel
Some have asked how it is possible ,
for the Board of Trustees to remove I
the limit on the number of women I
at Stanford by Board action without. J
resorting to a Court of Equity, and [


Almon E. Roth
yet accessary lux- the Board to ob
tain a legal determination of its
rights in the matter of investments.
The two cases are not parallel. The
first limitation was one arising from
an interpretation of the Founding
Grant and Amendments thereto and
did not involve any question of
general law relating to powers of j
trustees.
In the second instance, it was sup
posed that the restriction arose from i
two scourceu: first, a limitation !
in the Stanford trust itself, and sec- |
ondly, a limitation on the powers of ;
trustees generally, imposed by com
mon law.
Power of Trustees
In the first case the Board has
one hurdle to clear, and in the sec- |
ond it has two hurdles. Further- '
more, in the first instance the Board
has one hurdle to clear, and in the
second it had two hurdles. Fur
thermore, in the first instance the
Board of Trustees, by the very terms
of the Founding Grant itself, was
given power to remove the hurdle.
In the second case, the Board of
Trustees probably had power to re
move the first hurdle (consisting of
a restriction on the power of invest
ments which many assumed Mrs.
Stanford had set up), but no power
to remove the second hurdle (con
sisting of an assumed general pro
hibition under the common law of
purchase of stocks by trustees).'
Enabling Acts
The Board of Trustees was able
to remove the limitation on women,
without court action, by reason of
the fact that the founders of the
University very wisely gave the
trustees the power to change rules
which they had laid down for the
management of the property, in the
event that changing conditions and
the paramount purpose of the trust
required that such changes be made.
In removing the limitation on
I women the trustees relied upon the
[ following provisions in the enabling
act:
Purpose Stated'
"The person making such grant
may therein designate . . . such
i rules and regulations for the man
agement of the property conveyed
as the grantor may elect to pre
scribe; but such rules shall, unless
the grantor otherwise prescribe, be
deemed advisory only, and shall not
preclude such Trustees from making
such changes as new conditions may
from time to time require."
In her final instructions to the
i Board of Trustees, Mis. Stanford
made the following declaration:
"It was the paramount purpose
of the Founders of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University to promote
the public welfare by founding, en
dowing and having maintained a
University with the colleges, schools,
seminaries of learning, mechanical
institutes, museums, galleries of art,
| and other things necessary and ap

propria'e to a University of high de
gree, and all directions or reserva
tions in the Founding Grant and
all amendments or attempted
amendments thereof by the Found
ers, or by the Survivor of them, are
incidental and subordinate to that
paramount purpose."
