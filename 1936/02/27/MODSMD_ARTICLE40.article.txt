# Ruggers Defeat Alumni Team
## Mullen Scores Cardinals' Only Points as All-Blacks Provide Hard Battle for Varsity Squad 
### 
A determined band of ulumni,
playing under the br.nner of the Palo
Alto All-Blacks, gave the Indian
ruggers a terrific battle yesterday
afternoon before J .hey went down
to defeat, 3-0.
Jim Mullen made good on a penal
| ty kick late in the first period from
| the 43 yard line for the Indians'
| only score in a game marked more
: by rough play than by good rugby.
"It was a different team that play
! Ed today from that which downed
! U.C.L.A. last Saturday," commented
| Coach Jim Wylie following the
! match. The forwards were dogging
! it all afternoon and ball handling
' in the baekfield was for the most
I part shoppy.
