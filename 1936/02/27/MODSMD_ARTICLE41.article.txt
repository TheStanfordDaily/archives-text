## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism "Conduct Unbecoming" Just Words; But Councils May Revive Their Real Meaning 
### 
While they were laying the groundwork for
a complete Honor Code overhauling, Men's
and Women's Councils emphasized the dis
tinction between the Code and the "Funda
mental Standard" of behavior expected of
Stanford men and women.
The "Fundamental Standard" is defined in
the Student Handbook as demanding that stu
dents "show such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens."
The closely allied Honor Code is an agree
ment between students and the University
that the students shall observe an honorable
spirit of conduct in academic work; the Uni
versity, in turn, delegates enforcement to the
student councils.
Having clarified these two basic traditions,
the Councils, setting out on an entirely new
tack, plan to co-ordinate the Honor Code and
the "Fundamental Standard" into an even
more closely knit spirit.
Aim of the current uplifting-of-the-honor
system campaign is to strengthen the "spirit
of honorable conduct —not only in scholastic
work (embodying the Honor Code), but also
in social and other phases of University life."
The Councils have tackled a man-sized job.
The phrase, "conduct becoming of Stanford

gentlemen and women," in recent years has
become just so many words to an annually
increasing number of Stanford students. True,
very vew of these students will flagrantly
indulge in "conduct unbecoming," but in
many cases it is fear of penalty, not a whole
hearted sense of honor, that prompts observ
ance of what should be a conscience-matter.
Particularly during the past four years has
the trend been away from real concern for
these two most basic traditions —the Honor
Code and the "Fundamental Standard" —two
of the few traditions that have built up Stan
ford's enviable reputation.
However, as Gib Holloway of Men's Council
points out, the "slackening of spirit need* not
be a permanent tendency."
The big majority of students have a sense
of innate honor so firmly embedded in their
consciousness that every detail of the entire
honor system can continue on its pedestal. It
is education of the small minority whose ac
tions and responsibility demand proctors that
will furnish the Councils with their big job.
The undertaking is a large one. Success will
mean continuation and re-vitalizing of a tra
dition that in many quarters has come to be
identified with the University; failure, as the
Councils no doubt realize, inav mean its death.
