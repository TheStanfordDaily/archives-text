# America's No. 1 Politician
## 
### John Kline 
(Editor's Note—This is the second of a three
articlc series in which John Kline rounds up the
President's chances of re-election in the coming
campaign.)
Despite the fact that this fickle country has proved
unwilling to maintain F.D.R. upon the dizzy pedestal
on which it once placed him, no man has a better
right to the title of No. 1 politician ci the land.
Going back to the Coolidge technique, he is making
full use of every "invaluable oppor*unity to hold his
tongue." The less he says, the less there is to attack.
The fewer his speeches, the fewer "deadly parallels"
will have to be faced.

When speech has been chosen as the course, never
theless, the products are uniformly magnificent. The
''state of the nation" message to Congress was an
excellent piece of showmanship. It availed itself of
the prevalent anti-war and anti-fascist spirit. It used
I he age-old trick of focusing attention on international
problems.
The 'unpopular figures of Hitler, Mussolini, and
Japanese militarists were all brought under fire. The
really touchy issues were left carefully untouched.
On Jackson Day, the President found himself quite
comparable to Old Hickory. He, too, was for the people
with the wolves against him, it, seems. "History re
peats," said F.R., adding, "Whoever is the nominee
. . . the basic issue will be inevitably the retention
of popular government." Obviously, he was striking
sentimentally favorable themes.
His recent calling of an American Peace Congress
brought the ever-popular Pan-Americanism into play.
The cry of "joint responsibility" was strong bait to
the smaller nations to come into the fold of an "Amer
ican Continent for All Americans."

Further testifying that his political astuteness has
not yet vanished was the President's handling of the
bonus. As "Time" pointed out it was obviously
against hi.s political interests to force his supporters
to oppose the bonus to the last ditch.
No politician can get far by requiring his own
backers to stand on the spot. And a spot it would
have been to oppose the bonus in this Congress which
F.R. himself had taught to be spending-conscious.
Consequently, he issued no orders to defeat-tne
bonus-or-die-politically-trying to loyalites. He face
saved by repeating his opposition publicly, then let
Congress off with a polite veto.
The bonus rolled on over his veto. The public felt
it had not been deserted. His Congressional followers
realized they hadn't either. F.R.'s shrewdness had
again been displayed.

Indisputably a great politician, strategist, and
speaker, it is doubtful whether Roosevelt will stand
in history as a great man or statesman. One course
now open to him might effect that rating for him.
Should he take the Supieme Court issue by the ears
and back an amendment limiting the powers of that
august body, he would probably go down fighting as
Cleveland did in '88 when seeking re-election on a
lower-tariff platform.
Such a course is a remote one for Ihe politically
smart F.D.R., who has really done little to refute the
indictment of Columbia's Dean H. L. Mcßain: "In
the midst of a national crisis giving him opportunities
for reform never before possessed by a President . . .
he has chosen, for personal and party reasons, to play
the usual game of putrid politics."
No, it is more likely that Mr. Roosevelt's political
lidity will not allow him to go off on such a tangent,
and that he will probably- as we shall see tomorrow —
bo returned to office for another four-year siege.
