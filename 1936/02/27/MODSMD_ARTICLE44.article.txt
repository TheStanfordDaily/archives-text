That just goes to show you. In Japan you elect
'em and then assassinate 'em. In America you elect
'em, and then they assassinate you.

I hope that this morning's rally on the English
corner doesn't scare our basketball valiants. There are
some authorities who would recommend that the
women be screened off from the players during the
rally and the game.

The heroes all get dopey
'Cause they're full of misanthropy,

When the squad was down south for the Trojan
wars, they paid a visit to one of the film studios. As a
part of a publicity stunt, they were scheduled to have
their picture taken with a glamorous blonde actress.
After they got everyone all set, they discovered that
Captain Moore was missing. They finally located him
hidden up in the rafters and made him come down and
pose right next to the creature.
Another instance has come to light. A forward by
the name of Turner wanted very much to get a date.
Finally, someone suggested a number who was very
anxious to get an appointment with him. This so
struck the forward's fancy that he became backward.
He was so lost in the sheer rapture of the idea that he
forgot to call up and get the date, and consequently
had to sit at home.

Well, if we don't have anything to do tonight we
can all go down and hiss Heifetz. Or hie down and
hie Hissfetz.

There is a story about a Lagunita lady that is quite
consoling in this age of crass materialism. It seems
that a youth called up one of the residents in Casa
Naranja, or Limon, or Picklc, or something, and asked
her for a date. The request was granted. On the desig
nated night the swain called, walked his gal down to
the show and, after the show was over, walked back,
completely spurning the aid of the Paly Transit.

This seemed like a good thing, so the swain called
j up a second evening, and the process was repeated.
I The third time he called, the lady was still sporting in
the matter of walking, but this time the swain ap
peared with a car and confessed he had owned it all
the time. Said he, "I just wanted to see if you were
a good sport." The logical conclusion would be, I
suppose, that both of them gotoo f , of the car and
walked home. But the whole affair is clouded in
mystery.

The censor, who is very careful about these matters,
just looked up the word "swain" in the dictionary, and
found it meant "a country gallant." "It's 0.k.," says
the censorâ€”"More miles to the gallant."
