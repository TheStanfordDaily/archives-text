## WHO'S GONNA DRAG US IN? 
### 
How can America keep out of I
war?
That's a silly question that's being '
asked with the frequency and non
chalance of: Wlia f do you want j
Santy Claus to bring you for Christ- |
mas?
♦ * *
Mr. Banjoeyes Cantor offers a col
lege education for an answer to
"How can America stay out of war?"
Left wingist Nation will give 50 :

stones if some
one can tell them
whether "Neu
trality will keep
us out of war."
Veterans of For
eign Wars, appar
ently not very
flush, offer no
cash, but simply

hold parades with the star span- j
gled banner waving over huge
signs announcing, "American Youth
Demands Preparedness to Preserve !
Peace."
Though the veterans of battle
probably didn't know it, at almost
exactly the same time they were
flaunting American youth's demands
down Market Street, U.C.L.A. stu
dents were voting 2 to 1 against
R.O.T.C. training down in Westwood.
* * *
It may be unpatriotic to say so,
but these questions, these contests,
these votes and parades don't pro
mote the cause of the white dove of |
peace. Mention Santy Claus and j
everyone becomes conscious that j
Christmas is coming; keep mention- !
ing and talking about war and what j
will preserve peace, and everyone I
becomes war-conscious. It's a para- j
dox the pacifists can't comprehend. |

Yesterday Japan, a country we
thought aa civilized and well or
ganized as any nation, had a revo
lution, just like a hot-blooded South
American country. And it was the
militarists—the power-greedy boys
who have been clawing at territory
in China and Mongolia—who seized
control. Those who have been
laughing at the statement that Japan
is intent on doing some plain and
fancy fighting can now close their
grinning jaws and gulp.
n * *
Spain has been giving off smoke
lately as has Germany with its lust
ful eyes on the Ukraine. Italy cares
less about peace than it does about
the feelings of blacK men. Somebody
—Hitler, Mussolini, the Nippon lead
er maybe—is likely to get delusions
about being a modern Napoleon and
get the urge to start guns boom
ing.
* * *
If that happens, a neutrality pol
icy, pacifism, unpreparedness, pre
paredness, Veterans of Foreign
Wars, Eddie Cantors, R.O.T.C. polls,
Hearst newspapers, radio speeches,
depression, prosperity, Roosevelt,
Washington's farewell address, the
love of mankind, anything, nothing
will be able to keep America peace
fully unaffected on its home shores
anymore than it would have or did
in 1917.
* *
And now that I've done my bit
to further war-consciousness and
establish myself as an alarmist, let
me add that it's not a question of
how can America keep out of war?
It's who's gonna drag us into which
war when? —John McClelland

lege education for an answer to
"How can America stay out of war?"
Left wingist Nation will give 50 :

stones if some
one can tell them
whether "Neu
trality will keep
us out of war."
Veterans of For
eign Wars, appar
ently not very
flush, offer no
cash, but simply

hold parades with the star span- j
gled banner waving over huge
signs announcing, "American Youth
Demands Preparedness to Preserve !
Peace."
Though the veterans of battle
probably didn't know it, at almost
exactly the same time they were
flaunting American youth's demands
down Market Street, U.C.L.A. stu
dents were voting 2 to 1 against
R.O.T.C. training down in Westwood.

It may be unpatriotic to say so,
but these questions, these contests,
these votes and parades don't pro
mote the cause of the white dove of |
peace. Mention Santy Claus and j
everyone becomes conscious that j
Christmas is coming; keep mention- !
ing and talking about war and what j
will preserve peace, and everyone I
becomes war-conscious. It's a para- j
dox the pacifists can't comprehend. |

Yesterday Japan, a country we
thought aa civilized and well or
ganized as any nation, had a revo
lution, just like a hot-blooded South
American country. And it was the
militarists—the power-greedy boys
who have been clawing at territory
in China and Mongolia—who seized
control. Those who have been
laughing at the statement that Japan
is intent on doing some plain and
fancy fighting can now close their
grinning jaws and gulp.

Spain has been giving off smoke
lately as has Germany with its lust
ful eyes on the Ukraine. Italy cares
less about peace than it does about
the feelings of blacK men. Somebody
—Hitler, Mussolini, the Nippon lead
er maybe—is likely to get delusions
about being a modern Napoleon and
get the urge to start guns boom
ing.
* * *
If that happens, a neutrality pol
icy, pacifism, unpreparedness, pre
paredness, Veterans of Foreign
Wars, Eddie Cantors, R.O.T.C. polls,
Hearst newspapers, radio speeches,
depression, prosperity, Roosevelt,
Washington's farewell address, the
love of mankind, anything, nothing
will be able to keep America peace
fully unaffected on its home shores
anymore than it would have or did
in 1917.
* *
And now that I've done my bit
to further war-consciousness and
establish myself as an alarmist, let
me add that it's not a question of
how can America keep out of war?
It's who's gonna drag us into which
war when? —John McClelland

How can America keep out of I
war?
That's a silly question that's being '
asked with the frequency and non
chalance of: Wlia f do you want j
Santy Claus to bring you for Christ- |
