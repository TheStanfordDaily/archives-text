# 'Boheme' Well Presented By Dollar Opera
## 
### 
"LA BOHEME," Tuesday night
by the San Carlos Opera Company.
You may hear that this company
is a bunch of dubs and all that, but
it's not. Giacomo Puccini, who
wrote the piece, probably spent
quite a normal night in his grave
at Milan Tuesday night; at any rate, !
there was no cause for him to turn I
over in it.
Singing, acting, direction, and or- j
chestra were all above reproach for [
those who paid 55 cents or $1.10 to j
see it.
Dmitri Onofrein did a nice Ru- J
dolfo, the famous tenor. The basso 1
was also okeh. All of the principals, '
in fact, had acceptable sets of pipes,
but hardly loud enough to inspire
an audience like Tibbett or Pinza,
Pons or Flagstad do.
"La Boheme" is a tragedy of 1830
Paris, and deals with these poor but
carefree artists, philosophers, etc.
It has no overture, has a chorus only j
in the second and third acts.

Top comedy relief was uninten
tional, when one of the kids in the

j chorus comes out with a blue and
I gold Cal jersey on. numbered "24,"
ostensibly after Floyd Blower.
Others coming up: Trovatore to
night, Carmen, Lohengrin, Tosca,
Pagliacci - Cavalleria, Tannhauser,
Aida, Rigoletto. —Breed

"KING OF THE DAMNED," an
over-acted melodrama of life on a
prisoners 'isle, stars Conrad Veidt,

who is only at his
best in silent shots.
The remainder of
the cast is unimpres
sive, with the pos
sible exception of
Noah Beery playing

his usual role as the good "pal".
The nuclei of the cast produce the
eternal triangle: Conrad Veidt,
leader of over-suppressed convicts;
the suppressor whose name would
merely give away his prewar melo
dramatic acting; and Helen Vinson,
sweet, demure sophisticate who is
always carried away by her emo
tions.
There are times when the pho
tographer gets in good shots of mob
scenes, rain, forest, and swirling
waters, including the picturesque
ending of a dreadnaught heading
out to sea in calm waters and shim
mering moonlight. —R. B. Jones
