# Councils Hurdle First Obstacles In Code Change
## Professors Show Approval Of Project after Conferences; Seek Opinion of Students 
### 
First hurdles in Men's and Wom
en's Councils' concerted drive to
strengthen and evaluate the Honor
Code had been cleared yesterday as
officials reported completion of a
series of conferences designed to as
sure faculty co-operation.
Satisfactory approval of the proj
ect had been received from repre
sentative professors and depart
ments. Chairmen Pat Flavel and Gib
Holloway announced, but a number
of others will be questioned before
the next joint meeting.
The next phase of the campaign
will involve securing of student
opinion on the value of the Honor
System, it was said. Tentative ar
rangements are under way for a
panel to be held some time next
week, with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, councils' executives, and
representatives of the faculty and
student body meeting for discussion.
President Wilbur has voiced his ap
proval of the entire measure.
No attempt will be made to "put
in black and white" or codify the
principles and regulations of the
Honor Code, Holloway asserted.
This action, originally a main issue,
has been abandoned because pos
sible loopholes in the printed articles
might draw critical attack.
Instead, the executive student
groups will form definite policies
which its members will use in
handling violations of the system. In
this manner, it is believed, the stu
dent body as a whole will receive
benefit from the present inquiry.
The Honor Code, described by
President Wilbur as "one of the best
things Stanford students have," ap
plies in itself only to conduct in
academic work and "business life"
in the University. However, there
lies beneath its principles a "funda
mental standard," violation of which
constitutes "conduct unbecoming"
in all phases of activity.
The promised faculty co-operation
in supporting the system includes an
agreement to report to Men's and
Women's Councils cases where stu
dents are suspected of having dis
regarded the Honor Code.
