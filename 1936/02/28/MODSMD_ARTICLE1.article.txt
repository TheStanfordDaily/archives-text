# Japan Rebels' Compromise Averts Crisis
## Tokyo Under Martial Law As Troops Return To Barracks By Government Agreement 
### 
TOKYO, Feb. 28 (Friday) (&).—
One of the gravest crises in history
of the modern Japanese empire ap
peared near solution today as re
bellious soldiers, who toppled a
government with bullets, agreed to
return to their barracks.
The threat of a pitched battle in
the streets of the capital was averted
when the revolters acceded last
night to the government's request
that they leave police headquarters.
It was unofficially reported they did
so at th'> Emperor's command.
After assassinating four elder lib
eral statesmen Wednesday at dawn,
the soldiers had barricaded them
selves in the headquarters.
Fleet Arrives
The rebels promised to return to
their barracks, but under the com
promise agreement they will retain
their arms—and avoid the dishonor
of being disarmed.
The arrival last night of the
first battle fleet in Tokyo bay was
considered to strengthen the gov
ernment's position against the in
surgents, since the overwhelming
majority of the navy's opposition
to the insurrection was a telling
factor in capitulation of the rebels.
Eye-witnesses said hundreds of
ihe insurgents last night, quitting
the bleakness of gc vernment build
ings, swarmed the famous Koraku
and other restaurants and hotels
nearby.
Despite denials of high military
officials, civilian 'Authorities gave
credence to reports it was upon
Emperor Hirohito's direct com
mand the insurgents accepted the
arrangement to return to barracks.
The question of punishment to
those participating in the revolt, it
was understood, was left to future
negotiation.
Bloodshed Over
High officials of the army ex
pressed confidence the danger of
further bloodshed was over.
This arrangement for liquidation
of the insurrection relieved tension,
which had been marked by alarm
ing rumors in the capital.
Tokyo still was under martial law,
althougn the crisis was over.
