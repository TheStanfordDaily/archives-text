# Browns, Grays Lead in Shoes
## Roughs Avoid Contrast; Slim Lines Featured In New Spring Footwear 
### Jim Hurst 
White buckskin shoes with broad x
red soles, blue eyelets, blue laces,
and blue pipings are in — white j
buckskins with bright green' calf- (
skin saddle and red soles:—tan call ,
oxfords with red lace and piping and
green crepe soles.
The Rough's choice in footwear, '
however, may be considerably af- J
l'ected by the new trend toward nar- 1
rower toes for all types of shoes. The 1
so-called "custom" or "New York"
last, with distinctly slender lines, is
the coming thing.
drays Lead Field
Though grays will probably lead
the field in popularity for sports and
summer shoes as they did last year,
| new shades are noticeable, particu
larly on the tan and brown side.
I "Luggage tan," a shade so light I
! as to be almost a bull", will head the !
1 list of now shades. It will be offered
! mostly in a smooth Russian calf, with
j crepe or leather soles. This very j
! light color will tend to reverse the
i former style of light brown clothes I
' with dark brown shoes, and bring in
| the new combination of very light
! tan shoes with darker brown outfit. l
Saddle Brown New
' "Saddle brown," another new
i shade only slightly darker than the
! luggage tan, will expand the offer
ing of new light shades. It is charac
teristically more on the yellow side
and less on the red side than most
previous browns. Calf will be the
leather featured.
The dominating grays will be
i much as last year, coming in the
J lighter weight leathers mostly.
Buckskin and "Bucko" — reversed
j calfskin—are the most popular. An
, early check shows a strong trend 1
j toward crepe soles in these sports
and informal shoes.
White Buckskins Good
White buckskins will be popular
!as usual. They will be offered in
i three general types — wing - type, j
j plain toe, and crepe sole with plain
! tip.
j A growing demand for Norwegian j
I grain leathers—similar in stamina to j
1 Scotch grain — has been shown.
| These are slightly less expensive j
j than Scotch grain, and will be of-
I fered in the dai'ker shades.
The only two-tone model which
j continues to have appreciable popu- ;
j larity is white buckskin with brown
I calf saddle.
