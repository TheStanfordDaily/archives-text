The pin-stripe, tho red and black
plaid, the candy stripe, and other
gaudy colors have been decried the
1936 styie in shirts, buyers for local
haberdasheries have revealed.
This latest style, supplanting last
season's one - color blue, brown
shorts, etc., did not originate in this
country. Paris as usual imports this
latest mode to relieve women of the
monotony of viewing the American
male in the conventional white.
Flowers, as usual, are still in
vogue for the hair rei l or artificial
according to one's taste. However,
many tricky jeweled combs and hair
clips are on the market for those who
prefer a glittering coiffure.
