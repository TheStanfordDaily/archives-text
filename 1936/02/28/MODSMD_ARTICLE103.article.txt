# Stream-Line Spreads To Formal Wear
## Net, Chiffon, Cellophane Lead Materials With Wash Goods Second 
### 
Soft and stream-lined—that's the
by-word for new spring formals.
Fluttery fabrics are head-liners.
Chiffon, net, and the new cello
phane materials, are all featured in
the newest vogues Organdies will
be still worn; so will unusual wash
goods.
Long Skirts Popular
Skirts will still be long, although
ankle-length dinner dresses are
shown, and short dresses with for
mal backs and removable jackets
are coming back. They have the
virtue of being wearable for both
afternoon and evening — with the
jacket for street, and without for
dancing.
Unusual materials are coming to
the front. Marganza is one; another
is chiffon with cellophane embroid
ery, which gives an almost the
atrically soft and shining effect.
Fuss Is Out
Peplums, ruffles, and fussy trim
mings are out. Lines will be simple
and plain. Full skirts, sometimes
full sleeves, and tight-fitting waists
all make for a slim silhouette.
Last year's shirtwaist dress is
still good. A newcomer is the chif
fon or crepe accordion-pleated skirt,
although this shows signs of being
overdone.
Grecian lines will be used for
heavy crepe formals. Draped scarves
and soft folds are used on these.
Flower Trim Vogue
Flower trimmings are to be used
this summer. Gardenias across the
front of a plain dress will change
the whole effect.
Some bright prints are in evi
dence, although not so many as last
year.
One practical gown is the formal
with plain lines, over which can be
worn a full-sleeved net dress in
black or a harmonizing color, to
make it into a dinner dress com
pletely different, but equally wear
able.
