# "Certain Reasons" Reach To Feminine Mode of Dress
## 
### 
Women dress in certain styles for I
"certain reasons." The Daily gives a i
few examples of the reactions of i
these "reasons" to the way women {
dress. Here is what they say:
Boh Gros, student manager: "They
dress as they should dress on the
campus; they don't try to dress tip
as movie queens. I think they are
pretty well dressed, and I have no
kick coming."
Don Hanson, editor of the Quad:
"I like sweaters and skirts. I don't j
think fancy clothes should be worn 1
on Quad. Women should keep the

tradition of the Stanford rough—
plain and simple clothes."
George Henderson, tutor in eco
nomics: "It all depends on the
woman. Clothes don't make the
women; they make the clothes, and
lend a charm to the clothes."
Jim Copp, editor of Chappie: "Per
sonally (and I'm no critic, under
stand) I like to see a girl in a dash
ing corset. Yes, that's what I like—
a dashing corset creation with a row
of burlap hems up the middle. Mod
est, yes, but stunning!"
Dan Robertson: "Clothes for wom
en are a good idea."
