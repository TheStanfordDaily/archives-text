# Evening Wraps Worn In Varying Lengths
## 
### 
Evening wraps for this season's
well-dressed woman may be of al
most any length, but many are
three-quarter ones, and capes are
almost universally popular. One of
the outstanding favorites in furs
will undoubtedly be red fox.
Many women prefer wraps of
some of the interesting materials and
styles v/hich show the several un
usual influences prevalent today.
One of the most outstanding of these
is the Chinese; brocaded satin is seen
everywhere.
