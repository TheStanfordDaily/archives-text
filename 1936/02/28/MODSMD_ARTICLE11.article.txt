# Bright Trims Cunningham; Cards Powerful
## Klopstock, Reynolds, Burrows Star for Stanford at S. F. Track Contest Last Night 
### 
Norm Bright, former Stanford
l student, flashed around 13 indoor
laps last night to nose out Glenn
Cunningham, "the world's fastest
miler," in the remarkable indoor
time of 4.15:3, while other Stanford
athletes showed surprising strength
despite little practice in the past
three weeks due to bad weather.
, Bright passed the Kansas flyer on
the twelfth lap and held the lead to
j the tape. It was almost incredible
; time, considering the fact that Cun
; ningham predicted a 4.22 mile be- j
fore the race in light of the tiny
track.

Reynolds, Jack Lippman, Teeny
