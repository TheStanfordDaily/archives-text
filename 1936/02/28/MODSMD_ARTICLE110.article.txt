# Dinner Suits Featured In Formal Wear
## Colored Crepes, Organzas Popular For Spring Evening Wardrobes 
### Florence Brown 
When one says dinner dresses, one :
almost has to substitute "dinner j
suits," for the popularity enjoyed
by these suits toward the end of the '
winter season will be a feature of 1
spring dinner wear.
These suits may'be as extrava- j
j gantly or as simply chic as your i
j purse or fancy dictates. One of the {
j most extravagant being shown is of â€¢
black broadcloth; one of Ihe simplest !
| is of crisp white linen.
If you are not masculine minded
enough for suits you can add to j
your spring wardrobe any of a num- I
i ber of interestiirgly colored crepes ;
or crisp organzas. Black crepe holds |
I its own as a mid-season favorite, and
; black combined with red, or blue |
i and white, will be popular this j
! spring.
Many of this season's dinner !
j dresses have small jackets, but these [
; are made to cover, and not to con- i
; ceal. Collars of such jackets, which !
may be of almost any material, are j
| ingeniously made, and cannot be I
described in any general term un- j
less it he "fanciful."
