# Decorations Add Height To New Hats
## Variety of Type From Flowered To Mannish Mode Marks Season 
### 
Hats have gone up this year—in
height. Shallowness i the keynote,
and height is gaineu i jt in crown or
brim treatment alone, but by trim
mings, resembling ear-like spreads
of wings, small biscuits, or antique
snuff boxes.
There is a wide variety in hat
types —from small peaked creations
with flowers and feather trims to the
masculine felt Ilomburgs, modeled
after a man's felt hat, to match the
masculine lines of new suits.
Mannish Types
Other mannish types are deer
stalkers, shooting hats, schoolboys'
hats, in tweeds, and felt vlers,
such as are worn riding to iicunds.
Foreign countries are influencing
hats. There are Spanish bretons and
French sailor hats, the navy playing
an important part in hat styles. Ma
terials and styles show a marked
influence of the Chinese. A unique
type of hat is borrowed from Dick
ens' characters; there are David
Copperfield felts, Little Nell, and
Alice Lorraine hats.
Straws Match Accessories
Small brimmed hats pulled over
one eye are worn for spectator
sports, and vagabond swagger types
for general sports. For dress, one
may wear a small hat with a gay
feather, or a large brimmed hat.
Shiny straws match the new patent
leather accessories. Some have veils
over one eye or draped loosely over
the brim or crown. Peaked or draped
crowns, or even a trimming such as
blackbirds on top, add to the new
height.
The nonsensical class contains hats
like saucers, shovel brims, flat-iron
crowns, pancakes, mushrooms, sol
diers' caps, half hats, bandeaux, and
pompadour curl togues, with novel
ties such as a copy of a cowboy som
brero in exaggerated style.
Colors Match
In color the hat may match the
coat or suit, the dress, bag or shoes
or both, or an accent on the coat or
suit, as a scarf, belt, flower, or but
tons.
Fabrics are bayou, leghorn, Toyo
cloth, belting, malacon, pique,
stitched tafleta, embroidered straw,
hand-stitched organdie, and Nippon
cloth.
A few examples of new styles are
a felt hat with squarish crown and
stitched brim, in new high glove
color — saffron or perhaps straw
berry; a white or natural baku with
dark stitching across the creased
crown; a Homburg in Toyo, copied
from a man's hat but not too mascu
line in appearance.
Paris, however, deciding that hats
were not sweet enough, is featuring
as a novelty hat pins filled with per
fume.

Hats have gone up this year—in
height. Shallowness i the keynote,
and height is gaineu i jt in crown or
brim treatment alone, but by trim
mings, resembling ear-like spreads
of wings, small biscuits, or antique
snuff boxes.
There is a wide variety in hat
types —from small peaked creations
with flowers and feather trims to the
masculine felt Ilomburgs, modeled
after a man's felt hat, to match the
masculine lines of new suits.
Mannish Types
Other mannish types are deer
stalkers, shooting hats, schoolboys'
hats, in tweeds, and felt vlers,
such as are worn riding to iicunds.
Foreign countries are influencing
hats. There are Spanish bretons and
French sailor hats, the navy playing
an important part in hat styles. Ma
terials and styles show a marked
influence of the Chinese. A unique
type of hat is borrowed from Dick
ens' characters; there are David
Copperfield felts, Little Nell, and
Alice Lorraine hats.
Straws Match Accessories
Small brimmed hats pulled over
one eye are worn for spectator
sports, and vagabond swagger types
for general sports. For dress, one
may wear a small hat with a gay
feather, or a large brimmed hat.
Shiny straws match the new patent
leather accessories. Some have veils
over one eye or draped loosely over
the brim or crown. Peaked or draped
crowns, or even a trimming such as
blackbirds on top, add to the new
height.
The nonsensical class contains hats
like saucers, shovel brims, flat-iron
crowns, pancakes, mushrooms, sol
diers' caps, half hats, bandeaux, and
pompadour curl togues, with novel
ties such as a copy of a cowboy som
brero in exaggerated style.
Colors Match
In color the hat may match the
coat or suit, the dress, bag or shoes
or both, or an accent on the coat or
suit, as a scarf, belt, flower, or but
tons.
Fabrics are bayou, leghorn, Toyo
cloth, belting, malacon, pique,
stitched tafleta, embroidered straw,
hand-stitched organdie, and Nippon
cloth.
A few examples of new styles are
a felt hat with squarish crown and
stitched brim, in new high glove
color — saffron or perhaps straw
berry; a white or natural baku with
dark stitching across the creased
crown; a Homburg in Toyo, copied
from a man's hat but not too mascu
line in appearance.
Paris, however, deciding that hats
were not sweet enough, is featuring
