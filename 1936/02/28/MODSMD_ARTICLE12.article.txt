### Barbara Sweet 
With technique perfected to a
point where his flawless playing
seemed effortless, Jascha Heifetz
last night completely won over a
packed Pavilion.
Feeling out his audience in his
first numbers, he warmed to his in
strument as he warmed up the lis
tening crowd. The Mozart Allegro
and Beethoven's Sonata No. 7 in
C minor were played with infinite
finesse, but the Wieniawski concerto
was perhaps the lirst full expres
sion of his powers during the eve
ning. Rendering it with feeling, he
combined here perfection with hu
man understanding.
The familiar "Alt-Wien" by God
ow.sky, included in the third part of
a varied program, Heifetz played
with glowing warmth and appealing
beauty.
With an ovation that has seldom
been equaled on the Stanford cam
pus, the Pavilion p-idience was able
to break through the great violin
ist s reserved stage presence and
elicit four final encores, although
Heifetz usually plays but one.
Among these was Rimsky-Korsa
koff's well-known "Flight of the
Bumble Bee."
