# S. F. Shops Stress Colorful Accessories
## Chinese Art Exhibition, 'Margot,' and Lace Ball Control New Trends 
### 
The big San Francisco shops are
following Paris and New York in
going accessory-mad this spring. In
stead of hats, bags, gloves, and all
the other etceteras being incidental
to the dress, the dress is incidental
to them.
Shoe stores and other places that
specialize iri leather goods have fal
len completely for the new English
tan —new to America anyway.
Their windows look like a Filipino
housebov's dream of heaven—shoes
in all the yellowest, most glaring
shades of tan, heretofore consid
ered excruciating and now the
height of good taste
Gloves Featured
Almost every shop has managed
to devote at least one showcase to
gloves—in a bigger, better, and more
glorified sense of the term. They
come in every shade under the sun,
from pale, melting pastels, to vivid
greens, blues and reds, and are
being worn to contrast with the rest
of the costume.
Some particularly striking ones
were short, white, with bright zip
per closings. And for the eques
trienne, nothing but string mittens,
preferably in beige.
All the big establishments are
hat-crazy. The hats are crazy too,
but delightful. Any old shape will
get by, coal-scuttle, lamp-shade, and
the more conventional tricornes and
sailors, but the spring headgear has
to be flowered.
Some of the more extreme models
are boiled down to a riotous mass
of bloom with nothing much you
could call a hat underneath. But as
a consolation to the conventional
soul, the classic felt and panama are
shown everywhere with tailored and
sport things.
Accessories Varied
Other notes in accessories are lit
tle bunches of flowers, windowfulls
of them, to pin on anywhere, apri
cot and even brighter stockings, and
colored suede bags to match the gay
gloves. One shop features light
stockings with very dark brown or
black tops and re-enforcements for
contrast.
Reflections of Yvonne Printemps'
"Margot" in Paris, the Lace Ball in
New York, and the Chinese Exhibi
tion in London are everywhere in
San Francisco's shop windows.
Ruffs, interesting sleeves, coats, par
ticularly sports, with lots of full
ness in the back and a dashing
swing, are reveberations of the
Henry 111 festival in Paris.
Jackets Come Back
The little fur capes and jackets
of several winters ago are coming
back over silk dresses for the early
spring, and Chinese brocaded coats
are chic with dinner suits.
There's a Spanish influence too,
and one store has given it full sway
in a bridal display. The bride wears
a lace mantilla over a high comb,
and her attendants are costumed in
red and yellow. Lace is running the
perennial prints a close second for
evening, with lots of little bows,
ruffles, and feminine what-nots as
a relief from the very mannish suits,
some of them tuxedo style for af
ternoon wear, of the day-time
vogue.
