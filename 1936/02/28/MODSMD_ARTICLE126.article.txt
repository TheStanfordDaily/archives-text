# New Stitches Enliven Old Knitting Fad
## Preference Is Shown For Plain Tailored Suits, Crocheted Halo Hats 
### Suzanne Hammond 
With the greatest of ease last
year's fad for knitwear, which has
settled down into more of a steady
demand, is holding its own against
the usual spring onrush of new fads
and fashions.
Suits with alternating sweaters,
worn to fit mood and occasion, and
a plain heavy-yarn skirt, emphasize
the more tailored type of coat with
stitched front, lapels, pockets, and
those casual new short sleeves.
Contrast in Colors
Two color knitwear is all the thing
this season, with skirts and jackets
contrasting, and with gay striped
scarves worn Ascot style with your
tailored suits. Zigzaggy stripes give
a vivacious air to simple lightweight
sweaters, which are just the thing
for spring-time Quad wear with a
sport skirt and jacket, or with dress
ier suits.
Also new, and very smart, is the
development of a crinkled-in stripe
stitch that looks for all the world
like seersucker. Knit this into a coat
sweater pattern, add wooden buttons
and a belt and tie the color of the
wood, and the result is a handsome
jacket, vastly becoming regardless of
your proportions.
Fishnet Scarves
If you go for knitted scarves, try
making yourself one of those big
fishnet affairs, with two colors of
yarn knotted together with real fish
ermen's technique. They're easy to
make, and look grand either tucked
in or wrapped around with the ends
flying.
And last, but far from least, there
are all styles and shapes of knitted
and crocheted hats. A smart fez
shape with a real tassle is grand
with both fur collars and tailored
suits, and is made of row upon row
of cording covered with crocheting.
There are little halo hats, also cro
cheted over cording, to give a crisp
becoming shape, which may be worn
with your suits, linen dresses, or
even on the beach; and then thei'e is
a sort of close-fitting skull cap to
which is attached a separate "wing,"
lightly wired along the edge so it can
be adjusted to make the most of your
profile. This hat is awfully smart in
black, and is ont as extreme as you
might think.
