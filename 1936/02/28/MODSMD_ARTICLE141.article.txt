# Large Purses Headlined In New Shades
## Leather Tops Parade For Bag Materials; Gaberdine Is Also Featured 
### 
Everything goes to the hands.
Consequently, purses are bigger and
better than ever this season. They
are enormous in size, come in a va
riety of fascinating materials, and
a giddy array of bright colors.
Patent leather leads the parade
with a large envelope zipper bag.
Many of these patent bags come in
a particularly fascinating new color
called chudrone, a shade somewhere
between henna and brown. Not only
bags but hats and gloves as well are
very new in this shade.
Navy blue is the next best color
and black is good as always.
Ranking second in material is calf
i skin. An attractive calfskin bag is
j a new type pouch with a fold bot
tom and a narrow closing top.
Gaberdine is excellent too. It i:;
found combined with patent leather
> to a great extent. Shoes to match
come in the same combination.
Something very new is a purse
made of a celluloid composition.
This is a good idea from anyone's
standpoint because it is easy to keep
1 clean. One good - looking bag is
made in the shape of a flower to
harmonize with latest print dresses.
Felt bags in bright new colorsâ€”
red, gray, and London blue, are be
ing shown with felt gloves to match.
They are made in a large pouch and
are called hatbags.
Another new material is shirred
capeskin in all the summer colors,
white, navy, and chudrone leading
the rest.

Gray flannels again are popular
this spring.
