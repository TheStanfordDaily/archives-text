# Gay Prints To Be Worn In Afternoon
## Short, Slim-Cut Skirts and Gibson Girl Waists Coming Into Vogue 
### 
Gay prints dominate the field of
afternoon fashions for the coming
spring. Milady can go to town in a
print wen 11 under a dark coat or
detachable wool cape, set off with
bright accessories; or she can wear
the print with a flash of white ac
cents for warmer weather.
Figures on prints range all the way
from the dclicacy of pen tracings to
sharp vivid patterns. There is choice
between dainty garden sprays of tu
lip, mint spray, marguerite, or daisy
and dashing figures or masks, com
ets, butterflies, fruits, elephants, and
horses.
Skirts Shorter
Skirts are cut slim, and are shorter
than usual (thirteen inches from the
floor is a good average length.)
There can be drapery folds at the
front or on the side.
Buttoned and fitted waistlines
show a return to the wasp-waists of
the Gibson girl era. Shoulder lines
are broad; sleeves either full and
three-quarter length, short and
puffed, outlined with mousseline and
lace, pleated or caught up with clips.
There are two foreign influences, the
Spanish bolero and the Chinese
mandarin coat.
The high necklines will be soft
and feminine with draped folds,
tiny-pleated ruffs, or frilly collars.
Silks, taffeta, and alpaca lead the
materials for the season and pique
is the trimming of the hour.
Colors Contrast
Colors are to be brilliant and con
trasting: dusty pink with cherry and |
black; aqua and navy; blue and |
green: turquoise on wine; bright
red and dark green; or gold on sap
phire. For the next few months
bright, short swagger coats may be
worn over dark sheer wool frocks.
Right now, neutral shades, beige
and gray, are important. Greens and
all shades of violet, purple, and lilac.
will be good all year. Mid-March!
will see the advent of mere pastel j
shades.
