# Stanford Coeds Boast Contrasting Sweaters, Shirts
## 
### Susan Luckie 
Sweaters and skirts, and skirts and
sweaters. That, putting it briefly, is
just what Stanford co-eds wear on
the campus.
Barrel sweaters over shirts of con
trasting colors are the latest inno- I
vation. Other types of sweaters may
have long or short sleeves, and
be of plain colors or have brilliant
stripes at neck and wrists.
For skirts, plaids are tops this
year, although plain colors are al- ,
ways good. Small checks of brown, j
navy blue, or black on a white back- j
ground never fail to give a smart ap- 1
pearance.
Matching belts, scarfs, and purses
in giddy plaids or bright solid colors
| add a dashing touch to the costume.
| Knee-length hose have invaded the
j campus, but long stockings still hold

their own, while ankle socks are
decidedly in the minority.
Shoes worn by Stanford women to
classes are mostly of the low or me
dium-heeled variety, of soft suede,
glazed kid, or tough sealskin, prac
tical and smart, but not snowy.
Large floppy tongues topping them
are quite the thing at the moment.
White shoes, and browns and whites,
are making their first appearances,
under unfavorable conditions,
f —

The newest Quad coats come in
plaids, the bigger the better. Swag
ger style, they are not quite full
length, and flare from the neck.
Bits of colored ribbon stuck in the
hair catch the eye, and novelty pins,
buckles, and buttons add distinction
to the campus costume.
