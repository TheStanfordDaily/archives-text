## Suit Styles, Materials To Influence Attire For Day and Evening Wear 
### 
"Tell me are we men or—?" This
i question will confront the fairer sex
this season as they choose their
' spring outfits. Tailored to the ex
treme, suits will be the most impor
i tant item in milady's wardrobe and
wiil affect all clothing even to eve
ning wear.
The trend to masculinity is evi-
I denced in the suiting. Men's wear
and flannel will provide material in
everyday attire, while sharkskin and
gabardine will be important for
! dressier wear.
Shorter Jackets
Jackets will be shorter. A popular
model will be the culotte or divided
skirt. Cut on a straight line instead
of the bias, the division will give the
! appearance of a deep pleat. Another
j innovation is matching checks and
j stripes in coats and skirts.
For important occasions, the jacket
I will be tops. Short sleeves with the
| trotteur and reefer coat or Contrast -
i ing jacket with print dresses are
destined for popularity especially if
) the coat is lined with the dress mate
rial.
Colored Accessories
"Margot" has influenced the ac
cessories rather than the suits them
selves. Rich colored and contrasting
bags, gloves, and shoes should be
worn with the current mode in suits,
but the hat must be dark and con
servative.
With the warmer weather women
will wear Palm Beach suits.
