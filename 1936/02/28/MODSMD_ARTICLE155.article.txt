# "Back to Nature" Trend Begins Attack on War Paint
## 
### Margaret Loud 
'Back to Nature is the new pass- !
word for feminine faces. No longer u
can the stylish lady coat her physi- (
ognomy with red and white and still 1
be fashionable. Instead, she must j
try to be satisfied with what nature i
! has given her. I
She must remove obvious traces <
of rouge, powder, lipstick, and eye- »
shadow. She must let her eyebrows <
grow out from thin, pinched lines to
' approximately their natuial width—
and then must go easy on the pencil.
Brown Make-up Good
The little make-up used should be
tropical brown and orange in effect,
in preparation for the summer sun
i tan. Speaking of suntan, there are
I several rich creamy substances now
■ on the market to keep the skin from
drying out under the sun rays. A
; number of them are conveniently
! arranged in traveling kits.
New shades of nail poiish in red
and brown suntan have been spe-
I cially designed for spring and sum
, mer. Covering the whole nail with
| polish of mother-of-pearl, after the
i colored polish has been applied, is
1 also becoming popular.
iiair Off Face
| . Hair must be worn oft' the face in
soft natural curls. Swirls, a la Hep- 1
burn, rather than waves are the
• vogue. Tortoise shell combs, both
! tiny and large, are also coming in.
If there is emphasis on anything
' this season, it is on hands, which
must remain soft and white, even for
I the gardener or golfer. To supple
i merit the regular creams and lotions,
j there are three types of beauty
gloves. 1

First is a light-knitted cotton
glove, excellent for keeping creams
on the hands at night. Next is a
loose - fitting lambskin glove for
sports or gardening, with the cream
rubbed into the leather. The su
preme creation is for street wear,
a kid glove treated with almond and
glycerine inside, to be used in place
of ordinary hand lotion.

If there is emphasis on anything
' this season, it is on hands, which
must remain soft and white, even for
I the gardener or golfer. To supple
i merit the regular creams and lotions,
j there are three types of beauty
gloves. 1

First is a light-knitted cotton
glove, excellent for keeping creams
on the hands at night. Next is a
loose - fitting lambskin glove for
sports or gardening, with the cream
rubbed into the leather. The su
preme creation is for street wear,
a kid glove treated with almond and
glycerine inside, to be used in place
of ordinary hand lotion.
