## Men's Fashion Theory Is Useless at Stanford, Says Encina Sponsor 
### 
"One should change bis mode of
attire constantly, hut inconspicu
ously, ' advises Jack Morton, Encina
sponsor. On campus, comfort is the
sine qua non of style, and whereas
masculine magazine fashion plates
are sound in theory, their applica
tion has little plac • at Stanford, he
adds.
Both Jack and his roommate,
Woody Adams, endorse the bow tie
as the coming thing, but neither
think spring neckwear is nee :ssary.
In Woody's opinion, sport coats
ere not very worthwhile on cam
pus; sweaters are more proper. Both
sponsors join in their approval of
clothing such as polo shirts, gaber
dine slacks, soft shoes, and in their
disapproval of fancy shorts and rau
cous colors in general.
