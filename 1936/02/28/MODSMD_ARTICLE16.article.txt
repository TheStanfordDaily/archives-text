# Interfraternity Group Seeks Wilbur's Views
## Administration Opinion To Be Asked on Rushing Problems At Next Meeting of Council 
### 
Acting on the premise that a satis
factory revision of men's rushing
rules cannot be formulated unless
the views of the administration are
thoroughly understood, the Inter
. fraternity Council last night voted
to ask President Wilbur to air his
views on the rushing situation at
next week's meeting of the frater
nity representatives.
The Council, in session at the
Deke house to discuss plans for
rushing alterations presented by the
Interfraternity Board's special com
: mittee, in a surprise move unani
mously passed a resolution asking
that Dr. Wilbur attend their next
i meeting.
To Contact Wilbur
Ed Littlefield, Council president,
will contact Dr. Wilbur over the
week-end, and attempt to schedule
1 the next meeting Tuesday night.
The special committee last night
distributed ballots on two proposed
plans to the house presidents, who
will call for chapter votes at their
; next house meetings, most of which
will be held Monday. The ballots
will be returned for Tuesday's
| Council session.
The first proposal on the ballot
would include no off-campus rush
ing, continuance of the rule which
keeps fi-osh and Row-men "on their
j own side of the campus" except
; during specified periods, and would
: permit normal on-campus contact,
j "such normal contact interpreted to
mean contact of an informal nature."
Two Alternatives Offered
| Under this plan, two alternatives
in procedure were offered. The first
I included an intensive three-week
S rushing period in January with no
| rushing during fall quarter; the sec
ond provided for a schedule of au
; tumn and winter quarter dates like
| the 1935 system.
The second proposal was funda-
I mentally the same as that suggested
| by Dr. Wilbur, and provided for
| spring quarter pledging, no off
j campus rushing, but entirely unre
i stricted on-campus contacts. This
i plan would require a C average be
j fore initiation into the fraternity.
A discussion of off-campus rush
! ing revealed that majority opinion
strongly disapproved of these tac
tics.
Honor Basis Enforcement
Littlefield suggested that enforce
| ment of whatever rules finally are
adopted be placed more on an honor
i basis than in the past.
"All this talk about rules is no
I good unless we can find some rules
i which all the houses will agree on,"
the chairman remarked. "Maybe we
j can use an honor code system, or, as
j Dick Stark suggested, have every
house sign a pledge each week."
Mild disapproval of pledging as
late as winter quarter was expressed
by Littlefield. "This January rush
ing suggestionâ€” It seems to me the
houses who had legacies down in
Encina would have all the advan
tage," he said, and added, "The
whole thing baffles me."
Tom Boothe, student member of
the Board's special committee, ex
plained and to some extent defended
the plan embodying free contact and
spring pledging.
The resolution favoring the Presi
dent's attendance at the next meet
ing was proposed by Fred lieringer,
who remarked, "Why don't we get
Dr. Wilbur down here for a meeting j
and have him tell us just what the i
Administration will stand for. We i
can't do anything until we know |
how far they will let us go."
