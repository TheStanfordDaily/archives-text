# Fashion Advises Roughs To 'Say It With Flowers' Now
## 
### 
The Stanford is not only |
unfashionable, according to Esquire,
but also doesn't know one of the first ;
requisites to "winning his way" into !
the heart of The One and Only.
Nothing pleases HER more than to
unexpectedly get so much as a ,
bunch of violets, a rose, or some such j
offering —in flowers. And anyone
knows that he is the last man to
think of such a thing.
The old idea of a man giving a
girl only books, candy, or flowers
ten't taken so seriously us it used
to be. Books — she's already got j
enough to read in school. Candy— !
nice, and the best oi "non-reducers."
Thought Counts
But flowers, in any form, can be
depended upon to make her heart |
skip a beat or two. All of which
goes to show that the thought be
hind it all is more valuable to her
than its intrinsic value (that is, in
most cases).
We all know that it is a Stanford
custom not to send corsages for most

dances. All right. We respcct that.
But, Loidy, what a thrill wh; n they
come!
Simplicity Good
And so for their form—if they are
gardenias, most of us like thcrn
simple. That is, without fern or
other do-dads. Just the unadulter
ated flower. That'.' all wa ask.
But, if the sender would like to
make a particular hit, we suggest
that he think up something unusual.
For instance — one gardenia and
cyclamen, together; or Spanish iris;
or white violets; or (we're whis
pering) orchids. But mostly just the
idea thet it is "different" is all (hat
counts. Gardenias are lwvely, but
EVERYbody has them, if you get
what we mean.
Surprise Enjoyed
But the point of all this is that
the nicest part of flowers is the
thought they represent. Which is
all by way of suggesting that the
most-appreciated-iowers-of-all are
; ones that come "out of a clear sky."
Just a little bunch of violets are al!
! we want—'cause violets are so pret
I ty (and cheap!). Or a bunch of wild
I flowers (we really don't hr.ve ex
pensive tastes!) make any girl go
. ga-ga. Cut flowers from the florists
! are nice, too. Women like to receive
flowers which are sent for no rea
son at all.
i Remember that flowers are man's
friends. They cover a multi
tude of sins — lock-outs, lock-ins,
forgotten dates, arriving late, and
even an apology can bo said better
in flowers. Relax, just send a rose
bud. It's a nice habit to get into.
(With ail due respects to the
average Roughs wallet, we have
made the above suggestions, think
i ing that he is always open to hints
I gathered from the average Stanford
woman.)

Thought Counts
But flowers, in any form, can be
depended upon to make her heart |
skip a beat or two. All of which
goes to show that the thought be
hind it all is more valuable to her
than its intrinsic value (that is, in
most cases).
We all know that it is a Stanford
custom not to send corsages for most

dances. All right. We respcct that.
But, Loidy, what a thrill wh; n they
come!
Simplicity Good
And so for their form—if they are
gardenias, most of us like thcrn
simple. That is, without fern or
other do-dads. Just the unadulter
ated flower. That'.' all wa ask.
But, if the sender would like to
make a particular hit, we suggest
that he think up something unusual.
For instance — one gardenia and
cyclamen, together; or Spanish iris;
or white violets; or (we're whis

idea thet it is "different" is all (hat
counts. Gardenias are lwvely, but
EVERYbody has them, if you get
what we mean.
