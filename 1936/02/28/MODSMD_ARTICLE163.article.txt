# Bright Veils Are New Spring Vogue
## 
### 
Veils are very much the thing this
I Spring, provided they're different,
and worn with an air. They are used
by smart women in very bright
colors to offset that first black straw
hat—stunning, but a fashion ex
treme which collegiennes will prob
ably not take up.
I The riding veil, as worn by great
grandmother and English hunting
! women, tied around the head and
completely covering the face, has
come in for motoring and even street
wear —very chic with a tailored out
fit. Very few spring hats are being
I shown with matching veils, how
-1 ever.
