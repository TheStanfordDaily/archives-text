# Cal's Roughs Go Minus In Fashions
## Stanford Leads in Style Parade in West, But U. C. Is In the Woods 
### Dave Botsford 
Cal's in the woods as far as style's '
concerned. An authority on men's |
fashions told us so yesterday.
"They go to horrible extremes
over there," he confided. "If a few
of the fellows get the idea that blue
sweater coats look well with gray
slacks, the fad will catch like the
plague. Before you know it 9,000
of them are wearing blue sweaters
and gray slacks. It becomes nothing j
but a uniform."
Stanford Leads
Stanford, on the (ther hand, is the
style leader of Western colleges.
Los Angeles schools can't get away
from the Hollywood influence, but
the Sons of the Red look to the east.
"Three years ago our store filled
its shelves with cords and mole
skins. We sold 4 or 5 dozen pairs the j
opening day. Now we don't sell a j
pair. W â€¢ don't get enough calls even
to stock them."'
No More Roughs
Esquire, he told us, can very
handily lake most of the credit for
the rough's sprucing up. The maga- j
zine has become his style bible. (He
likes the Petty-girls, too.)
Men who a few years ago thought
themselves dapper dandies in sweat
ers and cords wear dark gab
ardine slacks to contrast with light
check sport coats. There's probably
a pork-pie hat in his closet, too.
