(. omptrolicr of Stanford University
(C opyriffht, 1030, by The Stanford
Daily)
When the depression struck Stan
ford, the University found itself
equipped with a staff and plant ca
pable of caring for 4000 students.
I he number of men students drop
ped off sharply while hundreds of
well-qualified women were being
denied an education at Stanford.
Even with the declining number of
men registered, the ratio of men to
women was still much greater than
that which existed when Mrs. Stan
ford imposed her five hundred limi
tation.
The drop in enrollment, with the
resulting loss of tuition income,
coupled with a concurrent loss of
income from investments, due to
defaults, created a most serious
finmciai situation, and made it nec
essary for the University in May
1933 to cut faculty salaries, and to
curtail its entire program.

It was at once apparent that new i
conditions had arisen which justi- :
fied the trustees in exercising the
power conferred upon them in the
Enabling Act to change the rules
and regulations for the management
of the University.
Furthermore, since it was essen
tial to the proper maintenance of
Stanford as a university of high de
gree that the tuition from additional
women be made available, the
trustees wore justified in consider
ing Mrs. Stanford's limitation on the j
number of women as being inci
dental and subordinate to such |
"paramount purpose."
To summarize, the answer to the
question, "Why did the University
not find it necessary to resort to
Court action in removing the limi- |
tation un women, whereas such
Court action was deemed necessary
in connection with the removal of 1
the restriction on forms of invest- |
mentis that the latter problem
presumably involved a common law
restriction arising entirely outside of
and independent of the Stanford
trust, the validity of which could I
only be determined in a Couit ac
tion, which was not involved in lim
itation «n income.

»
Judge James' decision has most
effectively disposed of any possible
inhibition on the power of the Board
of Trustees to invest in stocks. He
finds fir.-t that the trustees are not
forbidden by any expressed terms
of the trust as now in force to in
vest any of the trust funds in de
bentures or stocks.
Restrictions May Be Removed
Lawyers who have contended that
the trust did forbid investment in
stocks, based their contention upon
i the provision by Mrs. Stanford that
the affirmative votes of nine trustees
should be necessary to invest the
endowment funds of the University
in bonds and bonde d securities. '
It is not clear from Judge James'
opinion whether he considered that
! this provision was in the nature of
a by-law having reference to the
i number of trustees required for ac
tion. or in the nature of an implied
restriction on the power to invest.
It is possible from the language of
the Court that the Court may have
decided, as the trustees contended.
Ihat even if Mrs. Stanford did im
pose such restriction, it was removed
by subsequent directions which she
had given.
