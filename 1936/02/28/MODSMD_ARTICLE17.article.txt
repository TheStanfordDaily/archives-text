(. omptrolicr of Stanford University
(C opyriffht, 1030, by The Stanford
Daily)
When the depression struck Stan
ford, the University found itself
equipped with a staff and plant ca
pable of caring for 4000 students.
I he number of men students drop
ped off sharply while hundreds of
well-qualified women were being
denied an education at Stanford.
Even with the declining number of
men registered, the ratio of men to
women was still much greater than
that which existed when Mrs. Stan
ford imposed her five hundred limi
tation.
The drop in enrollment, with the
resulting loss of tuition income,
coupled with a concurrent loss of
income from investments, due to
defaults, created a most serious
finmciai situation, and made it nec
essary for the University in May
1933 to cut faculty salaries, and to
curtail its entire program.

It was at once apparent that new i
conditions had arisen which justi- :
fied the trustees in exercising the
power conferred upon them in the
Enabling Act to change the rules
and regulations for the management
of the University.
Furthermore, since it was essen
tial to the proper maintenance of
Stanford as a university of high de
gree that the tuition from additional
women be made available, the
trustees wore justified in consider
ing Mrs. Stanford's limitation on the j
number of women as being inci
dental and subordinate to such |
"paramount purpose."
To summarize, the answer to the
question, "Why did the University
not find it necessary to resort to
Court action in removing the limi- |
tation un women, whereas such
Court action was deemed necessary
in connection with the removal of 1
the restriction on forms of invest- |
mentis that the latter problem
presumably involved a common law
restriction arising entirely outside of
and independent of the Stanford
trust, the validity of which could I
only be determined in a Couit ac
tion, which was not involved in lim
itation «n income.

Judge James' decision has most
effectively disposed of any possible
inhibition on the power of the Board
of Trustees to invest in stocks. He
finds fir.-t that the trustees are not
forbidden by any expressed terms
of the trust as now in force to in
vest any of the trust funds in de
bentures or stocks.
Restrictions May Be Removed
Lawyers who have contended that
the trust did forbid investment in
stocks, based their contention upon
i the provision by Mrs. Stanford that
the affirmative votes of nine trustees
should be necessary to invest the
endowment funds of the University
in bonds and bonde d securities. '
It is not clear from Judge James'
opinion whether he considered that
! this provision was in the nature of
a by-law having reference to the
i number of trustees required for ac
tion. or in the nature of an implied
restriction on the power to invest.
It is possible from the language of
the Court that the Court may have
decided, as the trustees contended.
Ihat even if Mrs. Stanford did im
pose such restriction, it was removed
by subsequent directions which she
had given.
In any event, the decision is very j
clear on the point that no such re- !
striction, by expressed terms of the j
trust, exists at the present time. So !
much for the first hurdle.
Broad Powers of Investment
The Court then goes on to find
that there is nothing in the common
law or statutes of this state which
inhibits investments in common |
stocks by the trustees, thereby re- I
moving the second hurdle.
The following paragraph from !
Judge James' opinion gives to the i
Board of Trustees very broad pow- j
ers of investment:
"I am of opinion that the petition- j
ers may lawfully and properly make j
investment from trust funds coming j
to their hands, in bonds, debentures
and shares of stock of private cor- i
porations which are well-managed, |
and have enjoyed for a considerable j
period of time such a reputation for i
permanence and stability that they j
command the general confidence of j
careful and intelligent investors; and
may likewise invest in other gen- i
erally lecognized forms of invest- j
msnt providing an adequate rate of
interest and affording reasonable j
assurance of stable values. This is ,
not intended to exclude other pow
ers of investment heretofore exer- i
cised or decreed to them."
In a previous court action which I
the University instituted in 1907, j
the Court confirmed the power of i
the Board of Trustees to invest in i
mortgages and real property. The •
question has been raised as to why
the Board of Trustees did not at !
that time ask for a determination of
its power to invest in stocks. The i
answer is that investment conditions !
have changed greatly since 1907.
Inflation Endangers Stocks
At that time most trustees consid
ered that bonds were the most pru
dent and satisfactory form of in
vestment for trustees. Under pres
ent conditions, however, with the j
possibility of serious inflation fac- j
ing them, many prudent trustees !
have come to the conclusion that
the investment of a reasonable per- |
centage of endowments in stocks, is i
a safe and advisable method of con- j
serving the principal of trusts 1
against the results of inflation.
The problem which confronts the
present Board of Trustees of the
University today is vastly different j
from that which the Trustees of |
1907 were facing.
Ratio of Holdings Unfixed
It should be pointed out that the
fact that the trustees now have con- i
firmation of their power to invest j
in common stocks, does not mean
that the board will immediately
rush into the stock market and pur
chase great quantities of stocks.
Such stocks as the University may
purchase will be acquired only after
very careful study and analysis of
the whole situation, and pursuant to
a long-time program which has not j
yet been determined by the Invest
ment Committee.
Most endowed institutions which j
have invested in common stocks'
have limited their holdings of stocks i
to amounts not to exceed between !
15 to 30 per cent of the total trust j
fund. The Skinfold Board of Trus- '
tees has not as yet fixed any ratio !
of stock holdings.

(. omptrolicr of Stanford University
(C opyriffht, 1030, by The Stanford
Daily)
When the depression struck Stan
ford, the University found itself
equipped with a staff and plant ca
pable of caring for 4000 students.
I he number of men students drop
ped off sharply while hundreds of
well-qualified women were being
denied an education at Stanford.
Even with the declining number of
men registered, the ratio of men to
women was still much greater than
that which existed when Mrs. Stan
ford imposed her five hundred limi
tation.
The drop in enrollment, with the
resulting loss of tuition income,
coupled with a concurrent loss of
income from investments, due to
defaults, created a most serious
finmciai situation, and made it nec
essary for the University in May
1933 to cut faculty salaries, and to
curtail its entire program.

It was at once apparent that new i
conditions had arisen which justi- :
fied the trustees in exercising the
power conferred upon them in the
Enabling Act to change the rules
and regulations for the management
of the University.
Furthermore, since it was essen
tial to the proper maintenance of
Stanford as a university of high de
gree that the tuition from additional
women be made available, the
trustees wore justified in consider
ing Mrs. Stanford's limitation on the j
number of women as being inci
dental and subordinate to such |
"paramount purpose."
To summarize, the answer to the
question, "Why did the University
not find it necessary to resort to

tation un women, whereas such

in connection with the removal of 1

Judge James' decision has most
effectively disposed of any possible
inhibition on the power of the Board
of Trustees to invest in stocks. He
finds fir.-t that the trustees are not
forbidden by any expressed terms
of the trust as now in force to in
vest any of the trust funds in de
bentures or stocks.
Restrictions May Be Removed
Lawyers who have contended that
the trust did forbid investment in
stocks, based their contention upon
i the provision by Mrs. Stanford that
the affirmative votes of nine trustees
should be necessary to invest the
endowment funds of the University
in bonds and bonde d securities. '
It is not clear from Judge James'
opinion whether he considered that
! this provision was in the nature of
a by-law having reference to the
i number of trustees required for ac
tion. or in the nature of an implied
restriction on the power to invest.
It is possible from the language of
the Court that the Court may have
decided, as the trustees contended.
Ihat even if Mrs. Stanford did im
pose such restriction, it was removed
by subsequent directions which she
had given.
In any event, the decision is very j
clear on the point that no such re- !
striction, by expressed terms of the j
trust, exists at the present time. So !
much for the first hurdle.
Broad Powers of Investment
The Court then goes on to find
that there is nothing in the common
law or statutes of this state which
inhibits investments in common |
stocks by the trustees, thereby re- I
moving the second hurdle.
The following paragraph from !
Judge James' opinion gives to the i
Board of Trustees very broad pow- j
ers of investment:
"I am of opinion that the petition- j
ers may lawfully and properly make j
investment from trust funds coming j
to their hands, in bonds, debentures
and shares of stock of private cor- i
porations which are well-managed, |
and have enjoyed for a considerable j
period of time such a reputation for i
permanence and stability that they j
command the general confidence of j
careful and intelligent investors; and
may likewise invest in other gen- i
erally lecognized forms of invest- j
msnt providing an adequate rate of
interest and affording reasonable j
assurance of stable values. This is ,
not intended to exclude other pow
ers of investment heretofore exer- i
cised or decreed to them."
In a previous court action which I
the University instituted in 1907, j
the Court confirmed the power of i
the Board of Trustees to invest in i
mortgages and real property. The •
question has been raised as to why
the Board of Trustees did not at !
that time ask for a determination of
its power to invest in stocks. The i
answer is that investment conditions !
have changed greatly since 1907.
Inflation Endangers Stocks
At that time most trustees consid
ered that bonds were the most pru
dent and satisfactory form of in
vestment for trustees. Under pres
ent conditions, however, with the j
possibility of serious inflation fac- j
ing them, many prudent trustees !
have come to the conclusion that
the investment of a reasonable per- |
centage of endowments in stocks, is i
a safe and advisable method of con- j
serving the principal of trusts 1
against the results of inflation.
The problem which confronts the
present Board of Trustees of the
University today is vastly different j
from that which the Trustees of |
1907 were facing.
Ratio of Holdings Unfixed
It should be pointed out that the
fact that the trustees now have con- i
firmation of their power to invest j
in common stocks, does not mean
that the board will immediately
rush into the stock market and pur
chase great quantities of stocks.
Such stocks as the University may
purchase will be acquired only after
very careful study and analysis of
the whole situation, and pursuant to
a long-time program which has not j
yet been determined by the Invest
ment Committee.
Most endowed institutions which j
have invested in common stocks'
have limited their holdings of stocks i
to amounts not to exceed between !
15 to 30 per cent of the total trust j
fund. The Skinfold Board of Trus- '
tees has not as yet fixed any ratio !

(. omptrolicr of Stanford University
(C opyriffht, 1030, by The Stanford
Daily)
When the depression struck Stan
ford, the University found itself
equipped with a staff and plant ca
pable of caring for 4000 students.
I he number of men students drop
ped off sharply while hundreds of
well-qualified women were being
denied an education at Stanford.
Even with the declining number of
men registered, the ratio of men to
women was still much greater than
that which existed when Mrs. Stan
ford imposed her five hundred limi
tation.
The drop in enrollment, with the
resulting loss of tuition income,
coupled with a concurrent loss of
income from investments, due to
defaults, created a most serious
finmciai situation, and made it nec
essary for the University in May
1933 to cut faculty salaries, and to
curtail its entire program.

It was at once apparent that new i
conditions had arisen which justi- :
fied the trustees in exercising the

of the University.
Furthermore, since it was essen
tial to the proper maintenance of
Stanford as a university of high de
gree that the tuition from additional
women be made available, the

"paramount purpose."
To summarize, the answer to the

Judge James' decision has most
effectively disposed of any possible
inhibition on the power of the Board
of Trustees to invest in stocks. He
finds fir.-t that the trustees are not
forbidden by any expressed terms
of the trust as now in force to in
vest any of the trust funds in de
bentures or stocks.
Restrictions May Be Removed
Lawyers who have contended that
the trust did forbid investment in
stocks, based their contention upon
i the provision by Mrs. Stanford that
the affirmative votes of nine trustees
should be necessary to invest the
endowment funds of the University
in bonds and bonde d securities. '
It is not clear from Judge James'
opinion whether he considered that
! this provision was in the nature of
a by-law having reference to the
i number of trustees required for ac
tion. or in the nature of an implied
restriction on the power to invest.
It is possible from the language of
the Court that the Court may have
decided, as the trustees contended.
Ihat even if Mrs. Stanford did im
pose such restriction, it was removed
by subsequent directions which she
had given.
In any event, the decision is very j
clear on the point that no such re- !
striction, by expressed terms of the j
trust, exists at the present time. So !
much for the first hurdle.
Broad Powers of Investment
The Court then goes on to find
that there is nothing in the common
law or statutes of this state which
inhibits investments in common |
stocks by the trustees, thereby re- I
moving the second hurdle.
The following paragraph from !
Judge James' opinion gives to the i
Board of Trustees very broad pow- j
ers of investment:
"I am of opinion that the petition- j
ers may lawfully and properly make j
investment from trust funds coming j
to their hands, in bonds, debentures
and shares of stock of private cor- i
porations which are well-managed, |
and have enjoyed for a considerable j
period of time such a reputation for i
permanence and stability that they j
command the general confidence of j
careful and intelligent investors; and
may likewise invest in other gen- i
erally lecognized forms of invest- j
msnt providing an adequate rate of
interest and affording reasonable j
assurance of stable values. This is ,
not intended to exclude other pow
ers of investment heretofore exer- i
cised or decreed to them."
In a previous court action which I
the University instituted in 1907, j
the Court confirmed the power of i
the Board of Trustees to invest in i
mortgages and real property. The •
question has been raised as to why
the Board of Trustees did not at !
that time ask for a determination of
its power to invest in stocks. The i
answer is that investment conditions !
have changed greatly since 1907.
Inflation Endangers Stocks
At that time most trustees consid
ered that bonds were the most pru
dent and satisfactory form of in
vestment for trustees. Under pres
ent conditions, however, with the j
possibility of serious inflation fac- j
ing them, many prudent trustees !
have come to the conclusion that
the investment of a reasonable per- |
centage of endowments in stocks, is i
a safe and advisable method of con- j
serving the principal of trusts 1
against the results of inflation.
The problem which confronts the
present Board of Trustees of the
University today is vastly different j
from that which the Trustees of |
1907 were facing.

It should be pointed out that the

Ratio of Holdings Unfixed
It should be pointed out that the
fact that the trustees now have con- i
firmation of their power to invest j
in common stocks, does not mean
that the board will immediately
rush into the stock market and pur
chase great quantities of stocks.
Such stocks as the University may
purchase will be acquired only after
very careful study and analysis of
the whole situation, and pursuant to
a long-time program which has not j
yet been determined by the Invest
ment Committee.
Most endowed institutions which j
have invested in common stocks'
have limited their holdings of stocks i
to amounts not to exceed between !
15 to 30 per cent of the total trust j
fund. The Skinfold Board of Trus- '
tees has not as yet fixed any ratio !
of stock holdings.

(. omptrolicr of Stanford University
(C opyriffht, 1030, by The Stanford
Daily)
When the depression struck Stan
ford, the University found itself
equipped with a staff and plant ca
pable of caring for 4000 students.
I he number of men students drop
ped off sharply while hundreds of
well-qualified women were being
denied an education at Stanford.
Even with the declining number of
men registered, the ratio of men to
women was still much greater than
that which existed when Mrs. Stan
ford imposed her five hundred limi
tation.
The drop in enrollment, with the
resulting loss of tuition income,
coupled with a concurrent loss of
income from investments, due to
defaults, created a most serious
finmciai situation, and made it nec
essary for the University in May
1933 to cut faculty salaries, and to
curtail its entire program.

It was at once apparent that new i
conditions had arisen which justi- :
fied the trustees in exercising the
power conferred upon them in the
Enabling Act to change the rules
and regulations for the management
of the University.
Furthermore, since it was essen
tial to the proper maintenance of
Stanford as a university of high de
gree that the tuition from additional
women be made available, the
trustees wore justified in consider
ing Mrs. Stanford's limitation on the j
number of women as being inci
dental and subordinate to such |
"paramount purpose."
To summarize, the answer to the
question, "Why did the University
not find it necessary to resort to
Court action in removing the limi- |
tation un women, whereas such
Court action was deemed necessary
in connection with the removal of 1
the restriction on forms of invest- |
mentis that the latter problem
presumably involved a common law
restriction arising entirely outside of
and independent of the Stanford
trust, the validity of which could I
only be determined in a Couit ac
tion, which was not involved in lim
itation «n income.

»
Judge James' decision has most
effectively disposed of any possible
inhibition on the power of the Board
of Trustees to invest in stocks. He
finds fir.-t that the trustees are not
forbidden by any expressed terms
of the trust as now in force to in
vest any of the trust funds in de
bentures or stocks.
Restrictions May Be Removed
Lawyers who have contended that
the trust did forbid investment in
stocks, based their contention upon
i the provision by Mrs. Stanford that
the affirmative votes of nine trustees
should be necessary to invest the
endowment funds of the University
in bonds and bonde d securities. '
It is not clear from Judge James'
opinion whether he considered that
! this provision was in the nature of
a by-law having reference to the
i number of trustees required for ac
tion. or in the nature of an implied
restriction on the power to invest.
It is possible from the language of
the Court that the Court may have
decided, as the trustees contended.
Ihat even if Mrs. Stanford did im
pose such restriction, it was removed
by subsequent directions which she
had given.
In any event, the decision is very j
clear on the point that no such re- !
striction, by expressed terms of the j
trust, exists at the present time. So !
much for the first hurdle.
Broad Powers of Investment
The Court then goes on to find
that there is nothing in the common
law or statutes of this state which
inhibits investments in common |
stocks by the trustees, thereby re- I
moving the second hurdle.
The following paragraph from !
Judge James' opinion gives to the i
Board of Trustees very broad pow- j
ers of investment:
"I am of opinion that the petition- j
ers may lawfully and properly make j
investment from trust funds coming j
to their hands, in bonds, debentures
and shares of stock of private cor- i
porations which are well-managed, |
and have enjoyed for a considerable j
period of time such a reputation for i
permanence and stability that they j
command the general confidence of j
careful and intelligent investors; and
may likewise invest in other gen- i
erally lecognized forms of invest- j
msnt providing an adequate rate of
interest and affording reasonable j
assurance of stable values. This is ,
not intended to exclude other pow
ers of investment heretofore exer- i
cised or decreed to them."
In a previous court action which I
the University instituted in 1907, j
the Court confirmed the power of i
the Board of Trustees to invest in i
mortgages and real property. The •
question has been raised as to why
the Board of Trustees did not at !
that time ask for a determination of
its power to invest in stocks. The i
answer is that investment conditions !
have changed greatly since 1907.
Inflation Endangers Stocks
At that time most trustees consid
ered that bonds were the most pru
dent and satisfactory form of in
vestment for trustees. Under pres
ent conditions, however, with the j
possibility of serious inflation fac- j
ing them, many prudent trustees !
have come to the conclusion that
the investment of a reasonable per- |
centage of endowments in stocks, is i
a safe and advisable method of con- j
serving the principal of trusts 1
against the results of inflation.
The problem which confronts the
present Board of Trustees of the
University today is vastly different j
from that which the Trustees of |
1907 were facing.
Ratio of Holdings Unfixed
It should be pointed out that the
fact that the trustees now have con- i
firmation of their power to invest j
in common stocks, does not mean
that the board will immediately
rush into the stock market and pur
chase great quantities of stocks.
Such stocks as the University may
purchase will be acquired only after
very careful study and analysis of
the whole situation, and pursuant to
a long-time program which has not j
yet been determined by the Invest
ment Committee.
Most endowed institutions which j
have invested in common stocks'
have limited their holdings of stocks i
to amounts not to exceed between !
15 to 30 per cent of the total trust j
fund. The Skinfold Board of Trus- '
tees has not as yet fixed any ratio !
of stock holdings.
