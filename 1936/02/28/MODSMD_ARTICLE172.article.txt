# Sweaters In Solid Colors, Simple Design
## 
### 
New innovations in sweaters for
the rough this spring will mainly
consist of changes in the texture,
according to men's fashion author
ities. Fancy weaves will predom
inate, while fine soft wools will also
be featured.
Solid colors will continue to be
popular, mainly in such light shades
as canary, white, and powder blue.
Green is also expected to make a
decided comeback.
In contrast to the shirred and free
swing baclcs which were so promi
nent last year, the tendency this
spring will be toward a plain or at
least modified fancy back.
