# Shorts Remain Fashionable
## Men Show Preference For Comfort and Brevity In Present Fashions 
### 
You can't say very much about j
men's shortsâ€”except that they're
still being worn.
Snug - fitting, mildly - supporting
jockey shorts will lead spring and
summer sales, haberdashers say. J
With warmer weather and more |
action, the jockey shorts are more |
comfortable. Plain, white broad- j
cloth shorts are popular, too.
Glenurquhart and tattersal plaids, ]
from Scotland, are coming in, j
though they don't threaten the '
whites very much. They're wild;
checks, like some of the shirts
you see around. Because they show j
through when worn with white 1
trousers, Roughs are wary about I
stocking up very heavily on them, j

Jeans are now being worn by j
women students on the campuses of j
Eastern colleges.
