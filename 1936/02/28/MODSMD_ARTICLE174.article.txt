".slack sock," half-length foot-and- I
leg-wear, guaranteed not to get un
der the heels.

wear with summer slacks, these sox
will be featured in pastel shades—

blue. They will generally be avail- i
able in cotton, lisle, or part wool, i
Striped Hose Popular
Another family of slack socks for
the gaudier-minded Stanfordite will
have wide stripes in the loudest of
colors, from crimson to orange to
purple.
For more formal summer wear, ]
light colored full-length sox with
clockings will head the list. The
trend is more toward plain colors
or mild designs, with clockings than
to the more ostentatious patterns.
Lighter Shades Worn
With the rise in popularity each
year of light suits and slacks for
summer wear —linens, palm beach,
flannels—the colors of sox tend gen
erally toward the lighter shades,
especially pastels ;.nd whites. The
darker browns and blacks will still
be worn, but not by the large num
bers.
For the student with spare cash J

be the argyles, soft woolens
at a "quality" price. As usual, these
are available in bright plaids, checks i
and stripes.
