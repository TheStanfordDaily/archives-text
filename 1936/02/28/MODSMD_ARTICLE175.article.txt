lar. The coat is a double-breasted
ulster with slanting flap pockets, and
| an outside ticket pocket. Lapels are
j convertible to permit buttoning
! around the throat, and the collar j
I has a weather tab. The coat is pri
i marily for country wear, but may

lard muffler, rough finish bowler,

j to their origin they are fairly horsey
J in nature, with raised seams, slant
