# Midnight Blue Still Popular
## Full Dress Suits Gain In Approval; Roughs Are Disdainful of Pumps 
### John Rice 
Midnight blue from the top of his
head to the tip of his toes still is
what the well dressed man will wear
to a formal in the East.
Double breasted, midnight blue
dinner jackets with either a peak
or a shaw collar and grosgrain la
pels; pleated, high waist band, Eng
lish type trousers are now quite the
thing for the dashing youngster, but
his older brothers will be more in
clined to wear the standard, black,
single breasted tuxedo, styled sim
ilarly to its New York ancestors.
Shirts continue to be of the usual
stiff front variety, except for a
slight tendency for using either
pleated fronts or soft attachable col
lars with double - breasted coats,
only.
Midnight blue 'toppers, not to
mention the "blacker than black"
pumps, are now quite popular with
the less cautious smoothies, but
this mode has not yet penetrated
the borders of Farm. May we
offer a vote of thanks!
A very marked increase in the
popularity of fuil dress suits has
been bobbing up all along the Pa
cific Coast this year, and, not to be
left behind, the rcughs have been
buying tails to the left and right of
them; breaking all preconceived
sales records, as well as the dam
sels' hearts.
The tendency for increased use of
formal wear has been slowly rov
ing westward from the sophisticated
haunts of our Eastern brothers, and
has now caught the Farm by the
scruff of the neck.
Midnight blue is available in tails,
too, but most men seem to prefer
regulation cut suits, except that they
usually like trousers with higher
waist bands than did their fathers.
