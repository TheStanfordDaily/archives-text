# Play-Off Now Certainty If Indians Win
## 
### 
The Faculty Athlctic Commit
tee yesterday definitely announced
that it would not stand in the
way of Stanford's basketball
team in the event that the In
dians should be in the play-off for
the Pacific Coast Conference title
on March 13, 14. and 16.
Fear that the hoop team would
have to default to the northern
division winner due to final ex
aminations commencing March 17
was dispelled by this ruling. The
committee's action will also en
able the team to compete in the
Olympic Games elimination tour
nament on March 13 and 14 in the
event that they lose the southern
division title.
