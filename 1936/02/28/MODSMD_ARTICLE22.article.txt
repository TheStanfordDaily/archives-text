# Indians Face Cal Here With Title Hopes At Stake
## Coach Sunn's Squad on Short End of Odds Tonight Despite Three Victories Over Troy 
### Phil Duffy 
Stanford's varsity basketball team,
the only group to win a series from
Southern California in the seve.i
years that Sam Barry has coached
at that university, goes on the Pa
vilion floor tonight at 8 o'clock
against the University of California
in the most crucial game of the
season.
Odds Favor Bears
California in all her basketball
"glory'' and with all her "great"
teams has never won a series from
the Trojans in those seven years.
Victors in three of the four games
played with Troy this year, the
Stanford team faces the Bears to
night on the short end of the bet
ting odds, and with only one game
to California's two.
A win for the Indians tonight
means an almost certain claim to
the southern division title, and a
good chance of winning the con
ference basketball title; something

I
unheard of in the realm of Farm
hardwood history. Not only that,
but it means the realization of the
dreams of John Bunn who has
coached Stanford hoop teams
through seven torrid seasons.
Varsity Fulfills Wish
It has taken Coach Bunn seven
years of foresight and building to
realize one of his desires. This
year's varsity team fulfilled his wish
when it won a series from U.S.C.
Tonight that same team has the
power to reward John Bunn for his
patience and work, by defeating
California and bringing home to the
Farm basketball honors it right
fully deserves.
Two juniors and three sophomores
will start against the Golden Bears
tonight. They have made no vows,
but a victory tonight will make
them a team of destiny. Every one
of these boys will return next year
and their record for this season, now
almost gone, heralds them as pros
pective champions of the Pacific
Coast for two years to come.
Card Fight Jinx
Captain "Dinty" Moore, Howell
Turner, "Hank" Luisetti, Art Stoe
fen, and Jack Calderwood will start
the game tonight and with such a
future they should not lose. Victory
means innumerable basketball hon
ors in readiness to be conquered.
Defeat means a cry of the usual
"jinx" and oblivion for the best
Stanford basketball team in 15 long
years.
