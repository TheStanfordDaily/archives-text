DID YOU NOTICE what Avery
Brundage had to say about the treat
ment that American and other ath
letes received at Garmisch-Parten
kirchen? The pre*-ident of the U.S.
Olympic Association denied that the
American team was greeted with si
lence during the open ceremony pa
rade.
"'lhere were plenty of cheers. I
was in the parade and heard them.
I also saw any number of salutes
from Germans and others in the
crowd when the Stars and Stripes J
were carried by," he said.
BRUNDAGE WAS the leader of
the American group advocating en
trant :• and participation in the Olym
pics at Berlin this summer. Samuel
Untermeye;' was a leader of the
Olympic bo.cott movement among
American Je\'s.
Brundage b 'lieved that the de
v lopments at G irmisch justified his
stand. Untermeyer probably cannot
understand how the Winter Games
took place without some atrocious
atrocity. ,
Snid Brundage: 'Hitler, Goering,
and other German officials gave us
perfect treatment. Hitler especially
was most democratic. There was 1
not the slightest evidence of racial j
discrimination. In fact, the Germans '
•had loudest cheers l'or their best -
lockey piayer, Rudi Ball, a Jew."
ALL OF WHICH GOES to show
hat the dire predictions of Unter- I
leyer and his tiupportei's were
/rong. There wers some men that
ad more faith in the Olympic spirit
lan Untermeyer. One of these men
> /as Brundage.
THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT is an in
definable emotional experience |
hich transcends all pettiness and j
arrowness associated with race dis- |
i imination, and primitive thought, j
he thrill of the Olympic Spirit, |
hatever it may be, is a great one. j
Spectators at the closing cere- j
l. onies of the 1932 Olympics in Los j
ngeles uniformly felt a great emo- j
on. Those who didn't have tears j
. i their eyes, felt like crying. Any
< le and everyone might right then |
id there have walked up to a reg- 1
ter and signed his life away, if j
icessary, for the cause of interna- j
l una I peace and friendship. There j
as something alive and breathing i
i i the stadium that day which pulled j
the soul of everyone witnessing !
I'ie spectacle.
THE FRIENDSHIP created at i
' lose games was greater, more sin
c ;re, and more lasting than the half
hearted efforts we make toward
:ace as a result of the speeches of
v 31'bose and hypocritical diplomats
. id windbags. The spirit of the day
might have defeated any machina- {
ins and intrigue planned to bring :
jout war.
I
THAT SPIRIT seems to be dying i
it, and the stimulus of the coming
Olympics and the recently-passed!
V inter Games will give and has J
veil a new meaning and a new j
ission to the spirit, besides recreat- ;
i g it.
An Olympic boycott would have !
Idled that spirit and would also
! ive ground it into the filth of in- i
I rnational hatred. An Olympic boy
i >tt on the part of tho United States j
i .ight have given birth to a new and I
wful spirit—that of international i I
1 atred.
THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT of friend
■ hip is rekindled rnd burns every \
our years at the Games whether [
hey be in Berlin Angeles, in !
pite of racial attitudes or a super
colossal Chamber of Commerce.
The spirit has to be born anew at |
each Olympiad because the wear l
and tear of international ignorance,
hatred, and selfishness almost de- j
stroys it in the short space of four
years.
