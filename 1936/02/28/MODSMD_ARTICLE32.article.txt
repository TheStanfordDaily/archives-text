# Union Dispells Sudden Gloom With Candles
## 
### 
Union Cellar patrons were in
the ilark yesterday morningâ€”
until someone got out the candles.
Lights all over the campus went
out about 11:30 o'clock due to
main-line wire trouble. Rut the
Cellar manager whipped out ten
or a dozen candles he kept for just
such occasions.
And presto! just like in a movie
a warm, soft glow swept over the
eatery, kept customers pleased
until 3 minutes of noon, when
P. G. and E. power surged again
through the lines.
