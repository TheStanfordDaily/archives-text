clown deep in the human mind and
the human social structure," Dr.

litical science department of the
University of California, asserted at

< wn property and to derive wealth
from it is recognized by all of the
primitive peoples that I have ever
seen," Dr. Barrows explained, in
telling of his experience among the
mountain tribes of Luzon, principal
island of the Philippines.
With ten years in the islands as a
background, the speaker discussed
the social institutions of these na

ficulties have be -n confronted by
mankind over and over again.
Dr. Barrows was commissioned by
President T;.ft in ISOI to study the
Philippine tribes and recommend
