From Susan of Vox Campi fame
comes a reply to Practical's letter
and to the column of last week. It
reads, in part, as follows:
"I disagree with you about the
merits of secretarial training at
Stanford. You evidently regard
earning a living as an end in itself
rather than a means to an end. A
great University, in my opinion,
should teach one how to live."
* * *
That is just the point, Susan.
Stanford should teach one how to
live. As far as the cultural and the
professional lives are concerned, the
University succeeds very admirably.
That is not the argument.
While enjoying the so-called "cul
tural life" after graduation, a woman
finds bread and butter very neces
sary. This she can provide for her
self in two ways: she can earn her
self a living; she can find a man to
earn that living for her; or she can
do a little of both.
Stanford does not specifically train
a woman to do either. Unless she
numbers among the few who take
up a profession, she finds herself at
the end of four years totally un
prepared either to find and hold a
job, or to get married.
* * *
In addition to the secretarial
training Stanford should provide
preparation for marriage. A course
in budgeting would not be amiss.
Also classes in meal planning and
even cooking would come in handy,
if the college woman is to start her
wedded life on a par with her less
ambitious sister, who has stayed at
home and learned to cook under
mother's guidance. And finally a
course in marital relations would
provide insurance against potential
divorce.
The argument, Susan, is not set
ting the practical college life against
the cultural one. Rather, it is a
suggestion to combine the practical
college life with the cultural one,
in order to insure the graduate of a
well-rounded, happy future.
