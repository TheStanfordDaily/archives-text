# Health Service Aims To Prevent Infection
## Drs. Dorothy Heilman and Helen Pryor Supervise Work of Organization 
### 
"We emphasize prevention more
than cure," said Dr. Helen Pryor,
of the women's health service, in
discussing its purpose and operation
in connection with the rest home
and hospital.
iJnder the direction of Dr. Doro
thy Heilman and Dr. Pryor, the
service aims to pick up beginning
infection cases which might spread
over the campus. "Although it at
times works hardships on single in
dividuals to isolate themselves when
they may not be seriously ill, the
idea is to protect the student body
at large."
Aim of Rest Home
The health service is primarily for
ambulatory cases, she said, and for
those who need 24-hour care, the
hospital is the only alternative. The
rest home, however, is maintained
for the care of fatigue, colds, and
minor infections.
Dr. Heilman, now in her second

versity in 1927 and received her
M.D. in 1931 there. Since then she

and from 1932 to 1934 did rural re
search for the Rockefeller Founda
tion.
