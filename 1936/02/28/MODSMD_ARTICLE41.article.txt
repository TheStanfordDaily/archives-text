# Writer Birds 'Big Shots' For Earning Titles, Blankets

### Anne Ritchie 
Do you know what a little dope j
you were for seeing "Peter Pan"
seven times and clapping so hard
for Tinkerbell that you knocked out
two men and a boy with your
elbows at every performance? Sure
you do.
Now you are a sophisticated Stan
ford woman who sits up till all I
hours bull sessioning.
Well then, do something. Be
an Activities Woman. I)o some- j
thing for Stanford and country. |
Stop being a vegetable. Be an
animal or a mineral.
First of all come the athletes. All
you have to do is push that oxygen- j
starved, flabby-muscled frame of j
yours over to the Gym on all the
balmy afternoons when all the '
smart money is down the highway.
If you do this faithfully all year you
may be chosen to represent Stanford
at the Tri-Sports Day Circus. You
get a picnic lunch and plenty of
fun, you bet. If you do this for
four years you may get a blanket.
You will probably need it. What is
more exciting than Female Athlet
ics? (Yes what?)
Or maybe you would rather
spend three years sorting over \
the rogue's gallery and get to be !
Women's Editor of the Quad.
Even better, you can put in
twelve hours a day including
Sundays and Banknitcs, uncover
a scoop on Hoover being kind of
against the present administration,
and get to be Women's Editor of
the Daily. You can also pick

lilies for dance decorations com
mittees and get to be a member
i of Cap and Gown. If you start
i yelling "Quiet!" soon enough in j
your freshman year you are a j
cinch to be a sponsor.
But the best part of being a big
I shot is not the sense of achievement,
; the sense of a task well and nobly
done. No indeed. The best part
consists of impressing the masses.
What if you should say, "Well, as
I was telling Ray and George—"?
After this nothing can stop you.
Especially if you say it loud enough.

You will probably need it. What is
more exciting than Female Athlet
ics? (Yes what?)
Or maybe you would rather
spend three years sorting over \
the rogue's gallery and get to be !
Women's Editor of the Quad.
Even better, you can put in
twelve hours a day including
Sundays and Banknitcs, uncover
a scoop on Hoover being kind of
against the present administration,
and get to be Women's Editor of
the Daily. You can also pick

lilies for dance decorations com
mittees and get to be a member
i of Cap and Gown. If you start
i yelling "Quiet!" soon enough in j
your freshman year you are a j
cinch to be a sponsor.
But the best part of being a big
I shot is not the sense of achievement,
; the sense of a task well and nobly
done. No indeed. The best part
consists of impressing the masses.
What if you should say, "Well, as
I was telling Ray and George—"?
After this nothing can stop you.
Especially if you say it loud enough.
