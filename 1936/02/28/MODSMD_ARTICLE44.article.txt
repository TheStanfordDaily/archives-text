# Roble Is 'Home' To Mrs. Mort
## 
### 
Mrs. Ina Mort, the Fidus Achates
of so many of the great 500, the
j recently acquired 1000, and now the
1100, when asked how long she had
| been admitting late leavers within
i the sacred portals of Roble Hall,
I confessed that she had been at her
post for many years, in fact since
j 1916, with the exception of five years
I in the '20' S.
During 1916 and '17 the scene ol
Mrs. Mort's activities was Old Roble
now Sequoia—the stronghold of the
fast-vanishing Stanford Rough. In
1918 the present hall was completed,
and Stanford women, with their
"night hostess," moved in.
When asked how she liked her
job, Mrs. Mort said, "I love it—and
the girls too!" which is easily proved
by her j ears of service.
She knows the names of almost
all the girls by the end of their first
quarter, although she admitted that
this has become a more difficult
proposition since Roble has become
entirely inhabited by freshmen, es
pecially since they have fewer late
leaves than formerly.
Asked if she wouldn't like to come
to Lagunita for a change of scene,
she replied that she liked knowing
all the new girls as they come to
Stanford, and that, after all, aftei

so many years Roble has become
home to her.
