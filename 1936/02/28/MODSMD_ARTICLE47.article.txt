# Indian Frosh Cagers Meet Cal Tonight
## Third and Deciding Contest In Little Big Series Starts At 6:30 in Pavilion; Zonne Out 
### 
'"We haven't given up yet." With j
those words Coach Jimmy Bradshaw |
yesterday described the outlook for j
his Indian frosh hoopsters, who play j
their final game with the Bear Cubs j
tonight.
This third and deciding contest
of the Little Big Series will start j
at (i:3O o'clock to warm the Pavilion |
floor for Stanford and California j
varsities. More than just a good
floor-warming will be on display for
fans arriving early, however.
Captain Not To Piay
Bradshaw will definitely not use !
Captain Phil Zonne, after all. He's I
taking no chances on a recurrence I
of the star center's injuries. What's
more, the little yearling mentor has j
made hie plans without Zonne, who I
has been out for more than a week, j
Football-playing, slow but steady !
Wally deWitt will start in Phil's j
place. The big ex-guard did a good
job against the U.S.F. frosh, and has j
worked into the Bradshaw system j
fairly well.
Calkins, Kcssol To Start
"Lymie"' Calkins, a good floor man, j
and Jack Kessel, a scrappy little j
ballhawk, will start at forward. Big j
Dick Neeley, best under-basket man j
now that Zonne's gone, and Pete |
McArthur, a smooth ball-handler J
and a dead-eye on long shots, are
the guards.
A versatile reserve man, Chuck
Fisher, is ready to go in at either
forward or center. Bob Brooke, an
other sub forward, and Jack Cowan i
and Chuck Melczer, guards, will j
probably play, especially it' either
team gets more than a few points i
ahead.
Cubs Favored
It would not be at all surprising J
if the game see-sawed back and'
forth, tighter than a piano wire. Al
though the Cubs are favored, pre
game odds mean even less to the
frosh than to the varsity. Stanford
won the first, 37 to 28, in the Pa
vilion three weeks ago. California
did better by one point in a 38-28 I
victory at Berkeley a week later.
Davis, a Blue and Gold regular
who has been injured since early
season, will probably start opposite
Snyder at forward. Chalmers at
center, and Garretson and Golden
son at guard are most likely to com
plete the Cub line-up.
"The idea of a superior race is
preposterous, scientifically speak
ing," Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole, head of
the department of anthropology of
the University of Chicago, declared
recently.

'"We haven't given up yet." With j
those words Coach Jimmy Bradshaw |
yesterday described the outlook for j
his Indian frosh hoopsters, who play j
their final game with the Bear Cubs j
tonight.
This third and deciding contest
of the Little Big Series will start j
at (i:3O o'clock to warm the Pavilion |
floor for Stanford and California j
varsities. More than just a good
floor-warming will be on display for
fans arriving early, however.
Captain Not To Piay
Bradshaw will definitely not use !
Captain Phil Zonne, after all. He's I
taking no chances on a recurrence I
of the star center's injuries. What's
more, the little yearling mentor has j
made hie plans without Zonne, who I
has been out for more than a week, j
Football-playing, slow but steady !
Wally deWitt will start in Phil's j
place. The big ex-guard did a good
job against the U.S.F. frosh, and has j
worked into the Bradshaw system j
fairly well.
Calkins, Kcssol To Start
"Lymie"' Calkins, a good floor man, j
and Jack Kessel, a scrappy little j
ballhawk, will start at forward. Big j
Dick Neeley, best under-basket man j
now that Zonne's gone, and Pete |
McArthur, a smooth ball-handler J
and a dead-eye on long shots, are
the guards.
A versatile reserve man, Chuck
Fisher, is ready to go in at either
forward or center. Bob Brooke, an
other sub forward, and Jack Cowan i
and Chuck Melczer, guards, will j
probably play, especially it' either
team gets more than a few points i
ahead.
Cubs Favored
It would not be at all surprising J
if the game see-sawed back and'
forth, tighter than a piano wire. Al
though the Cubs are favored, pre
game odds mean even less to the
frosh than to the varsity. Stanford
won the first, 37 to 28, in the Pa
vilion three weeks ago. California
did better by one point in a 38-28 I
victory at Berkeley a week later.
Davis, a Blue and Gold regular
who has been injured since early
season, will probably start opposite
Snyder at forward. Chalmers at
center, and Garretson and Golden
son at guard are most likely to com
plete the Cub line-up.

preposterous, scientifically speak
ing," Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole, head of
the department of anthropology of
the University of Chicago, declared
