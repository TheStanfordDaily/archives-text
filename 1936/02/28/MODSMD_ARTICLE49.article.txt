[ Dick Winzler, John Pease, a new
j comer, but who has already won a
' reputation as a hard hitter, and Sims
j deVeuve and John Fowler, who have
I also won both of their matches this
! season.
Mac Pope left the hospital Wed
nesday morning to make the trip,
instead of Barney Greenlee, as was
previously announced.
