# Stanford Nine Opens Against Broncs Here
## Coach Wolter's Varsity Meets Santa Clara Tomorrow In Initial Conference Contest 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's 1936 edition
of the Stanford varsity ball team
will make its initial conference ap
pearance before local fans tomorrow
afternoon when it tangles with the
Santa Clara Broncos. The game is
scheduled for 2:30 on the sunken
diamond.
On the basis of its record in
practice games and its showing
against the strong St. Mary's nine
last Wednesday, the Indians are
conceded at least an even chance of
defeating the visitors.
Infield errors, the bugaboo of the
Stanford team in its first few prac
tice games, were noticeably absent
against the Gaels. The smooth
working inner garden combination
is composed of Darrel Holman at
first hase, Jack Huddleston at sec
ond, George Farrel at short, and
Bill Nev/som at third.
Wolter indicated yesterday that he
would again start Ray Weiershau
ser, who was the victim of some
lucky hits in the Gael game, on the
mound for the Cards, with Glenn
Hamilton and Fred Furman being
held in reserve. Leo Hagerty will
catch.
The rest of the lineup will prob
ably remain unchanged from that of
the St. Mary's game with the excep
tion of Tom Killefer and A1 Brent,
left-handed hitters, who may start
with Captain Bones Hamilton in the
outfield if the starting Santa Clara
pitcher is right-handed.
