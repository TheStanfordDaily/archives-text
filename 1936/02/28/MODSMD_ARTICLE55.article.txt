# KEEP 'EM OUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Just why I should feel impelled
to rise to the defense of Los An
gel-as is, even in my own mind, a
question.
However. I happen to live a little
closer to that city than Eeeloo Bel- i
gium, where Mr. Enke hails from, j
so it is but natural that I feel rather
upset by his attack on the city of
Los Angeles.
Los Angeles, in particular, and all i
of California in general, has been \
suffering from an influx of tran
sients since the heyday of Upton j
Sinclair. Chief Davis is doing the
entire state a great favor by keep- !
ing these would-be influxers out.
Chief Davis should be accorded
the support of all Californians. Ari
zonans, to be sure, have some reason
to complain, as they have handled
the unemployment problem there
quite handily in the past by paying
the expenses of the unemployed to
the California border.
