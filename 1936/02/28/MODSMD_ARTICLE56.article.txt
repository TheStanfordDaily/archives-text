The Editor, Sir:
One of the essential constituents
of the gentleman is honesty, but ap
parently some of the Stanfordites j
do not regard if as such. This was !
forcibly brought to my attention ,
when some person mangled a feri- [
dei on my car, which was parked <
near Toyon Hall, and did not leave j
a note or any other means of identi- j
fication to enable me to find him
and settle the damage at the ex- j
pense of his insurance. Since then j
1 have learned of three other simi- j
lar incidents.
The people who do not find the !
parking facilities around the halls
spacious enough should either give
up driving or pay for the damage 1
they do.
I never expect to meet the person
who mangled my fender, but 1 cer- j
tainly would appreciate the oppor-r
tunity to make his acquaintance.
