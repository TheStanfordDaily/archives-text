# PACIFISM VS. R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
To the Editor, Sir:
On the assumption that Stanford
students desire peace and in the in
terest of that desire, may we call
certain facts to the attention of said
students?
First, the United States does not
co-operate with the League of Na
tions by participating in active
membership.
Second, we believe the League,
being international in scope, de
serves the primary allegiance of
peace-lovers.
Third, R.O.T.C. trains men to be
lieve armed preparedness is neces
sary. It is training some of our best
men for Nationalism, which is a
major barrier to international peace.
Fourth, the R.O.T.C. is giving a
military ball—putting glamour into
war preparations. The women of
Stanford wait expectantly for an in
vitation. The men will look fine in
their best uniforms. Too bad they
won't look as pretty when gassed,
maimed, and dead!
We believe that those students
who attend the military ball are
contributing to destructive nation
alism—which is destroying the pos
sibility of a world-wide co-opera
tive solution of our problem—of our
hope for peace.
