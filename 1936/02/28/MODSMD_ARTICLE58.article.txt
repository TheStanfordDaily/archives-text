The Editor, Sir:
Dear Eisenbach—There must be
some sort of a mean between corn
ing to college purely for academic
purpose and coming to the "rat
race." The social virtues may per
haps get too much attention from
too great a proportion of Stanford
students, but they are an invaluable
part of our total education, espe
cially since when we are through
with school many of us will use
handbooks and do as the boss wants
instead of doing our own thinking.
Then it will be necessary to have
mastered the. art of maintaining
harmonious human relationships as

well as to have academic training.
It would be tine if our social pur
suits could be pursued on a higher
level which would encourage a little
critical or creative thought at times.
Then they would have a greater
value to us. —Walter Powell
