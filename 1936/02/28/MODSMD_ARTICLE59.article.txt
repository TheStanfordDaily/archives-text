# IT'S AN OUTRAGE

The Editor, Sir:
It is time the high-handed politics
of the B.A.C. were brought to a
stop. It is outrageous that students
should be charged 40 cents to the
basketball games.
This latest insult from the B.A.C.

is too much to be taken lying down.
May 1 ask the B.A.C. a question?
Why do we have a basketball team
here at Stanford? Is it supposed to
be a team of the students, for the
students, or is it to be run as a
money-making scheme, or what is
â€¢ the answer? Bill Tuttle
