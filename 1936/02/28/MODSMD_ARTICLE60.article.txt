Stanford dimes get a chance to

1936 Olympic Games and give the
Roughs an afternoon of thrills be- |
sides, when headline stars swim for
five Pacific Association champion- !
ships here tomorrow.
Late entries swell the number of i
Buy Region teams competing in
Stanford's benefit sport-show to ten.
The meet begins promptly at 2
o'clock.
Wcrson Favorite
Three of the greatest breast- !
stroke swimmers ever to compete
on the Pacific Coast come together 1
in Ihe 220-yard race. Don Towne,
greatest breast-stroke ever !
produced on the Coast and holder of
two world's records, tries the long
distance for the first time in com- I
petition.
Favored in the event is Califor
nia's Jim Werson, who swam an
amazing race against Reed of Ore
gon last week to set a new 200-yard
breast-stroke P.A. record in 2:33.3. i
He will be swimming a distance |
"right up his lane" tomorrow, and
he should avenge the defeat he re
ceived this month in Sun Francisco i
when the Stanford freshman,'
Towne, beat him in record-making 1
time for 100 yards.
Towne Big Threat
Earle Teasdale of the Olympic
Club, present record-holder for the
event, will be in there to defend his
title. Towne, swimming his unique
under-water fashion, should pro
vide plenty of excitement for the
first 150 yards, but it is possible that
Cox of the Olympic Club, Lawrence
or Collins of California may catch
him before the end.
In the 150-yard back stroke there
are Roy Siem of California, defend
ing champion, Frank YVithycombe l
of San Jose State, and Bob Walker j
of Stanford, former holder of the '
world's record for the 400-meter
back stroke. All three are evenly
matched.
Vidian Relay Threats
Crack relay teams from the San
Francisco Y.M.C.A., California, San
Jose State, and Stanford will com
pete in a 400-yard race definitely
threatening the existing mark of
3:46.5. The Indian team, composed
of Jack Vibert. Captain Kuhn, Alec
MacKenzie, and Martin Scatena, has
broken it time and again unofficially.
Winfield Needham, Stanford
freshman middle-distance swimmer,
showed just how good his chances
are of taking Dick Keating of the i
Olympic Club in the 500-yard fx-ee '
style when he unofficially clipped
two-tenths of a second from the
P.A. record for the' distance on his I
way to the half-mile.
The diving, featuring eight bril
liant spring-board artists including 1
Tom Boothe of Stanford, Danny
Kuhns of California, and Frank
McGuigan of the Fairmont Swim- i
ming Club, will wind up the after
noon's events.
