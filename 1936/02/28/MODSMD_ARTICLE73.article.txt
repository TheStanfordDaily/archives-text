WATCH BEAR IlirS;
ANI) PICK THE CARDS

Here's a little dope that might aid
you in post-game bull sessions to
night and thereafter.
Watch the Cal players' hips to
night.
There has been much ado about
the oflicialing in the conference this
season — charges that either the
players are allowed to get too rough
or that they can't make any manner
of normal contact.
A lot of this yelling has come
because the local officials have
been too busy watching the ball.
They have neglected to watch the
body-hip-elbow stuff that some of
the rougher boys have been pull
ing pretty constantly.
For example, Hank Luisetti toted
around sore black-and-blue spots,
all over him for a full week after
the last Cal game, the one lost by
such a frightful margin.
So watch the blue 'n' goldies'
hips tonight, and when you see
Herwig or one of the other Frice
coachcd men ram one of our boys
with a knee or a hip into the ribs,
and you see the officials ignore it
and keep eagle-eyeing the ball,
there's no reason in the world
why you shouldn't boo. just like
they do at Berkeley. Only this will
be for a justifiable cause.
All of this naturally follows a
condition where Stanford, with tall,
lean fellows and a fast-passing at
tack has to play the driving, ag
gressive style that Price uses, stress
ing "guts," as Bill Leiser says.
As for the game itself, Stanford
should win, go into the California
play-otl with S.C., and stride on
toward the Olympics.
And up in the Great Northwest
indications are expanding to the ef
fect that the southern division win

ner is going to have a lot more
chance of beating the north champ
than was believed a month ago.
For Washington, the northern
leader, has lost three of its last four
starts—one to the cellar Idaho Van
dals, and two to Washington State.
Oregon State is now a lone game
behind the Huskies.
And a note of encouragement to
Stanford. Wagner, the Washing
ten forward who practically cooled
the Cards single handed in the
two December games by scoring
40 points in two games, has scored
the tremendous total of 3X points
in the last eight games. So he
must have been terrifically "hot"
in the two Card games.
DON'T FORGET Nort Thornton's
big splash tomorrow afternoon over
at the Pools. There will be lots of
close races and records in jeopardy.
It's for a worthy cause, too, raising
funds for transportation of Amer
ican athletes to the Olympiad this
summer.
Included are Don Towne, Bob
Walker, Winfield Needham. and
Tom Boothe, with the crack 400-
yard relay team, representing
Stanford; Danny Kuhns. Jim Wer
son, and Roy Siem, Bear stars;
Dick Keating, Herb Brotman,

and Bob Diamond from the Olym
pic Club, and a host of other tank
luminaries from the Bay Region.
GUFF: Elroy Robinson, the Fres
no N.C.A.A. 880 champ, is a great
hand for collecting flora—brought
12 sacks of flowers and plants back
from his running tour of Europe
last summer . . . Earl Hoos, counted
on as a first-line Card blocking back
and signal caller next fall, is work
ing on the income tax in the city
. . . Gene Venzke got more than a
full column in the New York Times
on his great race beating Glenn
Cunningham last week, which is
typical of the general bravos being
accorded Venzke these days and the
general Bronx-cheer for Cunning
ham . . . Peanut sales at the bas
ketball games have increased 100
per cent . . . Alf Brandin may re
turn to school next fall to play cen
ter—frosh Dick Sutton is being
counted on to play quite a bit at the
pivot post, too . . . March and April
are going to be fine for skiing in the
Sierras this year . . . Pete Zagar

Here's a little dope that might aid
you in post-game bull sessions to
night and thereafter.
Watch the Cal players' hips to
night.
There has been much ado about
the oflicialing in the conference this
season — charges that either the
players are allowed to get too rough
or that they can't make any manner
of normal contact.
A lot of this yelling has come
because the local officials have
been too busy watching the ball.
They have neglected to watch the
body-hip-elbow stuff that some of
the rougher boys have been pull
ing pretty constantly.
For example, Hank Luisetti toted
around sore black-and-blue spots,
all over him for a full week after
the last Cal game, the one lost by
such a frightful margin.
So watch the blue 'n' goldies'
hips tonight, and when you see
Herwig or one of the other Frice
coachcd men ram one of our boys
with a knee or a hip into the ribs,
and you see the officials ignore it
and keep eagle-eyeing the ball,
there's no reason in the world
why you shouldn't boo. just like
they do at Berkeley. Only this will
be for a justifiable cause.
All of this naturally follows a
condition where Stanford, with tall,
lean fellows and a fast-passing at
tack has to play the driving, ag
gressive style that Price uses, stress
ing "guts," as Bill Leiser says.
As for the game itself, Stanford
should win, go into the California
play-otl with S.C., and stride on
toward the Olympics.
And up in the Great Northwest
indications are expanding to the ef
fect that the southern division win

ner is going to have a lot more
chance of beating the north champ
than was believed a month ago.

WATCH BEAR IlirS;
ANI) PICK THE CARDS

Here's a little dope that might aid
you in post-game bull sessions to
night and thereafter.
Watch the Cal players' hips to
night.
There has been much ado about
the oflicialing in the conference this
season — charges that either the
players are allowed to get too rough
or that they can't make any manner
of normal contact.
A lot of this yelling has come
because the local officials have
been too busy watching the ball.
They have neglected to watch the
body-hip-elbow stuff that some of
the rougher boys have been pull
ing pretty constantly.
For example, Hank Luisetti toted
around sore black-and-blue spots,
all over him for a full week after
the last Cal game, the one lost by
such a frightful margin.
So watch the blue 'n' goldies'
hips tonight, and when you see
Herwig or one of the other Frice
coachcd men ram one of our boys
with a knee or a hip into the ribs,
and you see the officials ignore it
and keep eagle-eyeing the ball,
there's no reason in the world
why you shouldn't boo. just like
they do at Berkeley. Only this will
be for a justifiable cause.
All of this naturally follows a
condition where Stanford, with tall,
lean fellows and a fast-passing at
tack has to play the driving, ag
gressive style that Price uses, stress
ing "guts," as Bill Leiser says.
As for the game itself, Stanford
should win, go into the California
play-otl with S.C., and stride on
toward the Olympics.
And up in the Great Northwest
indications are expanding to the ef
fect that the southern division win

ner is going to have a lot more
chance of beating the north champ
than was believed a month ago.
For Washington, the northern
leader, has lost three of its last four
starts—one to the cellar Idaho Van
dals, and two to Washington State.
Oregon State is now a lone game
behind the Huskies.
And a note of encouragement to
Stanford. Wagner, the Washing
ten forward who practically cooled
the Cards single handed in the
two December games by scoring
40 points in two games, has scored
the tremendous total of 3X points
in the last eight games. So he
must have been terrifically "hot"
in the two Card games.
DON'T FORGET Nort Thornton's
big splash tomorrow afternoon over
at the Pools. There will be lots of
close races and records in jeopardy.
It's for a worthy cause, too, raising
funds for transportation of Amer
ican athletes to the Olympiad this
summer.
Included are Don Towne, Bob
Walker, Winfield Needham. and
Tom Boothe, with the crack 400-
yard relay team, representing
Stanford; Danny Kuhns. Jim Wer
son, and Roy Siem, Bear stars;
Dick Keating, Herb Brotman,

and Bob Diamond from the Olym
pic Club, and a host of other tank
luminaries from the Bay Region.
GUFF: Elroy Robinson, the Fres
no N.C.A.A. 880 champ, is a great
hand for collecting flora—brought
12 sacks of flowers and plants back
from his running tour of Europe
last summer . . . Earl Hoos, counted
on as a first-line Card blocking back
and signal caller next fall, is work
ing on the income tax in the city
. . . Gene Venzke got more than a
full column in the New York Times
on his great race beating Glenn
Cunningham last week, which is
typical of the general bravos being
accorded Venzke these days and the
general Bronx-cheer for Cunning
ham . . . Peanut sales at the bas
