Often cursed by the Old (iuard as necessary
evils, products of the depression, and un
wanted invaders, Stanford women have
weathered a three-year storm of "we resent
you" at the hands of die-hard Houghs, and
emerged a hardy race.
So successful, in fact, was the weathering,
that in this era of emergence little rationali
zation is necessary to make the admission
that, in view of the "eleven hundred," Stan
ford is a better place at which to attend school.
Comptroller Roth's answer to the statement
that tlie additional (>OO women are here in
direct violation of Mrs. Stanford's wish that
the .">OO remain .">OO, is received heartily in the
feminine quarter of the student body.
He reciles (hat the original founding grant,
which was executed by both Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, provides that "The Trustees shall
have the power, and it shall be their duty . . .
to afford equal facilities and give equal advan
tages in the t'niversity to both the sexes."
That provision never has been neglected. In
days of prosperity the ratio of men to women
was easily maintained. Depression brought

the need for added enrollment, and because
women were clamoring at the gates, the bars
were raised. Hut the old ratio has been main
tained.
As the bars went lip, I lie women rushed in.
With a "what have we here?" attitude, the
men watched their coyness in classrooms,
their audacity in lighting cigarettes on the
Quad, their invading of the sacred Law Steps,
and their general taking-things-over attitude.
Then a spark kindled, l ies began to ap
pear; p;inls were pressed; Stanford men, in
herently gentlemen, let their genllemanliness
emerge and show on the surface.
According to Western standards, at least,
separating the sexes, even while they are be
ing educated, is not normal. Boosting the
number of women to the point where a more
varied class of them can be admitted has
done away with much of the artificiality of
university life.
The Farm has become a normal, actually
co-educational school. And it is the belter
for it.

you" at the hands of die-hard Houghs, and
emerged a hardy race.
So successful, in fact, was the weathering,
that in this era of emergence little rationali
zation is necessary to make the admission
that, in view of the "eleven hundred," Stan
ford is a better place at which to attend school.
Comptroller Roth's answer to the statement
that tlie additional (>OO women are here in
direct violation of Mrs. Stanford's wish that
the .">OO remain .">OO, is received heartily in the
feminine quarter of the student body.
He reciles (hat the original founding grant,
which was executed by both Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, provides that "The Trustees shall
have the power, and it shall be their duty . . .
to afford equal facilities and give equal advan
tages in the t'niversity to both the sexes."
That provision never has been neglected. In
days of prosperity the ratio of men to women
was easily maintained. Depression brought

the need for added enrollment, and because
women were clamoring at the gates, the bars
were raised. Hut the old ratio has been main
tained.
As the bars went lip, I lie women rushed in.
With a "what have we here?" attitude, the
men watched their coyness in classrooms,
their audacity in lighting cigarettes on the
Quad, their invading of the sacred Law Steps,
and their general taking-things-over attitude.
Then a spark kindled, l ies began to ap
pear; p;inls were pressed; Stanford men, in
herently gentlemen, let their genllemanliness
emerge and show on the surface.
According to Western standards, at least,
separating the sexes, even while they are be
ing educated, is not normal. Boosting the
number of women to the point where a more
varied class of them can be admitted has
done away with much of the artificiality of
university life.
The Farm has become a normal, actually
co-educational school. And it is the belter
for it.
