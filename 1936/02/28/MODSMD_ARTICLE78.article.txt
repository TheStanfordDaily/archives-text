# Series Shows That Appeal Is to Mind, Not Anatomy

A good-sized (rowd in the Pavilion last
night did as .lascha Heiletz predicted they :
would: applauded generously and did not
hiss.
The good-sized crowd can be laid at the
door of Ihe cfiicient Concert Series manage
ment, which lined up a good list of artists this
year and then went out and blanketed the
campus with season tickets in an effective
house-to-house selling campaign.
The failure to hiss can be blamed on the i
sheep-like qualities of the audience or the '
lad that Mr. Heit'etz' art stilled the savage
breast.
One thing is certain, Concert Series, which
in had a loss of >> 1 and faced a threat

of its being dropped from seliool lor deficits
unbecoming, is attaining heights of prosperity
and filling seats in the Pavilion, which are far
more uncomfortable than the Assembly Hall
seats that Dramatic Council says they cannot
fill. Which means that soft seals do not a
profit make, nor iron girders a stage.
