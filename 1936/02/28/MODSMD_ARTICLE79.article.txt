# Another Term in Sight?

### John Kline 
(Editor's Note—ln the last of a three-article
series, John Kline today sums up President
Roosevelt's chances of re-election and gives a clue
as to the President's probable campaign tactics.)
Although loss popular, il seems a safe guess that
politically clover Mr. Roosevelt will be returned to
office in November. Chief bases: the incumbent is
always likely to get the call when things are going
"pretty well"; the opposition apparently hasn't what
it takes.
The inarticulate masses are still largely with the
President. His inconsistencies, his blunders, have been
pounded into them by the usual moulders of opinion;
but general feeling still holds that he has tried like
the dickens, thiit he is the underdog's friend, and that
his job of breaking the depression has been well done.
* * * *
No doubt F.R. is vulnerable to the charge of going
back on campaign promises. Yet he can come back
any time the battle gets rough and say, "I didn't
realize how desperate the situation was going to be.
I could have kept my promises; but it would have
meant starvation, and maybe revolution."
It takes a good man to know when to reverse him
self. Possibly an unbalanced budget is preferable to
closed school:;, starving citizens—Mr. Landon will no
doubt hear that argument many times.
# * At *
Many anti-N w Dealers will put X's on the line
for F.R. because his administration has not shown the
niggardliness associated with the G.O.P. Townsend
itc.s, Share-the-Wealthers, Farmer-Laborites, Com
munists, Socialists, Coughlinites, Epics, and the unem
ployed pack a lot of votes.
# * * <c
By election time, business faction? may not be so
anti-F.R. as they now register. The very bitterness of
iheir attack may create a backwash of Roosevelt popu
larity thai will engulf its generators. Even more ob
vious hope for F.R. is that the upswing in general
prosperity keeps on. bringing with it psychological
unwillingness to change leaders.
# # * *
South and West are almost a cinch for Roosevelt,
especially since the chief sore-spot, Louisiana, is elim
inating itself as the late Kir.gfish's henchmen clamoi to
board the Demo bandwagon. If labor swings into line
and carries a big Eastern state or two, the election
would be as in-the-bag as the nomination.
Since the Civil War, but one President has gotten in
without N.Y.'s electoral votes. No one is sure how
F.R. stands now in his home state. Upstate, he's
stronger than his party; in the City, he's weaker.
* * * *
Mr. Ro.'i.sovlt has been characterized as "slipping
at a Mails pace.' If the G.O.P. is to win, it must
speed up th > turning tide, especially in New York,
whose support is requisite.
Rapid sentiment shifts are not uncommon nowa
days. Witne.s a nation so apparently dry that every
politician was gun-shy of the Repeal issue. Next mo
ni"nt, Repeal was in. and a Dry was a public menace.
* * * *
Without a "cause," Republicans will never win.
Mr. Hoover struggled manfully to give them the "Lib
erty" one. but it didn't take. The Constitutional issue
isn't v( rv lively, since the Supreme Court is holding
its own quite nicely, thank you. "Planned economy"
is as d' id a catchword as "Technocracy" or "Coue
ism."
Old Republican gripes of communistic and dicta
torial tendencies in the New Deal are losing their
.'ting. American intelligence may t.ot be on dizzy
heights, hul that line of attack evidently underrates
it, judging by the lack of response.
• * » *
If the G.O.P. rants on bitterly enough, F.R. can
forget the whole e -npaipn. He would then appear
as il ; champion of the underman, a.s a man who had
risked his hide for suffering America. He might not
stand out as a popular great reformer, but he'd still
stand ; s the lesser evil.
Un! I>< publicans eonvinci the people that they
have i ♦nine'! to the progressivism and humanitarian
ism of EooM'veb I. the i ace will be won in a breeze.
F.K. will zig-zag on his way and come in under
the wire.

(Editor's Note—ln the last of a three-article
series, John Kline today sums up President
Roosevelt's chances of re-election and gives a clue
as to the President's probable campaign tactics.)
Although loss popular, il seems a safe guess that
politically clover Mr. Roosevelt will be returned to
office in November. Chief bases: the incumbent is
always likely to get the call when things are going
"pretty well"; the opposition apparently hasn't what
it takes.
The inarticulate masses are still largely with the
President. His inconsistencies, his blunders, have been
pounded into them by the usual moulders of opinion;
but general feeling still holds that he has tried like
the dickens, thiit he is the underdog's friend, and that
his job of breaking the depression has been well done.
* * * *
No doubt F.R. is vulnerable to the charge of going
back on campaign promises. Yet he can come back
any time the battle gets rough and say, "I didn't
realize how desperate the situation was going to be.
I could have kept my promises; but it would have
meant starvation, and maybe revolution."
It takes a good man to know when to reverse him
self. Possibly an unbalanced budget is preferable to
closed school:;, starving citizens—Mr. Landon will no
doubt hear that argument many times.

Many anti-N w Dealers will put X's on the line
