# Yes, Thanks, Our Liquor System's Fine

An enterprising survey company has sent
Tin: Daily a questionable which asks, among
other things: "What is the present college al
titude toward beer and 'hard' liquor legisla
tion?"
Of course the I'niversity's own private legis
lation on the matter prevents the presence of
liquor on the campus, but laws and facilities
are such that normal demands for alcoholic
beverages are satisfactorily met without un
due traveling on the part of the students.
The provision in the liquor law prohibiting
sales to minors might be objectionable to
many students were it not for the fact that
the provision is quite completely ignored by
many near-by dispensaries.
The Board of Equalization, furthermore, is
sufficiently lenient in granting licenses so that
there is no shortage in houses of refreshment,
and moderate enough with their taxes so that
prices are not prohibitive.
In reply to the questionaire, therefore, it
might be said that students are fairly well
satisfied with liquor legislation as it stands.
