# Our Hasher Sez:

Now that basketball season is almost begun, and
football season is almost begun, and life has just
begun al the comparatviely slow speed of 40, and
beeause it is four days late, and spring cannot be far
behind, I will tell a stoi-y about nothing at all.
It seems that we had a football raliy Tuesday night.
It was rally a nice rallies as rallies gesies. Everybody
was happy. During the course of the evening a news
cameraman took pictures, and gags thai would not even
go in Our Hasher wero passed around.
Anyway, it seems that a football coach (four
wheelsâ€”no breaks, go ahead and say it) from South
ern California was in a great hurry to get to the Stan
ford Union, where he was to meet people who would
take him to the rally. So he drove up at a terrific
clip (with just a suggestion of a block) in front of an
imposing structure where many bright-faced lads were
lounging about. Said the coach:
"Is this the Stanford Union?"
"Hell, no, buddy," said they. "This is the Phi Dclt
house.''
Current sport on Lagunita is a game called "Frog
over Frisco." The Mosses in the bullrushes take
amphibious aim at girlies paddling by in canoes, and
the splashure is all theirs.
Business getting bad these days. A desperado
called up the Oaks a few days ago, said he was Our
Hasher, averred he was doing some consumer's re
search, and asked if he could come down.
Suspecting an Oaks Hoaks, but having plenty to
Sez about Our Hoaxer, the ochres invited him down
and in. After asking around about interest in the
column, the misguided youth found out what people
really think. So he tried to back out, finally admitting
that he was only my brother, and that the whole
family weren't all like that.
Branner boys have now grown up to the grammar
school age. A state of warfare exists because some
of the militarist party broke into a room and assas
sinated some ot the beds, by throwing them out of the
window. It is said that the Administration is con
sidering employing some, freshmen as sponsors in
Bran nor.
