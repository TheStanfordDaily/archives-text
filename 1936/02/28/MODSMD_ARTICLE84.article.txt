# Inadequacy of Cast Marks 'Collegiate'
## 
### 
In Collegiate, Jack Oakie, as a j
i care-free playboy, inherits a young
j ladies' seminary from his wealthy
I aunt. Aided by his anti-publicity
I agent (Ned Sparks), his right-hand |
man (Lynne Overman), and a !
nameless victim of amensia who
; conveniently keeps producing $100 i
bills (Joe Penner), he turns the
seminary into a charm school where j
girls learn how to dance, sing, and
j wear stylish clothes.
The plot comes to a routine con
clusion when the school proves to
be a tremendous success and Oakie j
finds himself in love with his once
drab little secretary (Frances Lang- ,
i ford), who has brushed up on a few !
charm lessons herself.
The chief trouble with Collegiate
is that it is inadequately cast. Jack [
Oakie, plus his pigs-bristly mous- j
tache, takes himself too seriously, i
j and Joe Penner fails to squeeze
| many laughs out of his part. Ned
Sparks, however, turns in his usual !
droll performance and Lynne Over- ;
man is moderately funny when he .

becomes Penner's exasperated cus
todian. Good tunes are "I Feel Like
a Feather in the Breeze" and "You
Hit the Spot."
The Last of the Pagans is a story
of native love in the South Sea
Islands. It is spoken in native dia
lect, the most important lines being
translated. Splendid photography of
tropical scenes helps the picture
considerably. â€”M. Loud
