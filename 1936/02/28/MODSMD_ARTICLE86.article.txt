THE PRESSURE ACT
Though they ar_> fighting tooth
ana-nail to preser/e their constitu
tionul status as free men, two Uni
versity of California professors are
today "sitting on their hands."
They are Dr. Max Radin, world
famous legal authority, and Henry
Conover, assistant professor of eco-

nomics. Accord
ing to the district
attorney of Stan
islaus County, Dr.
Radin is generally
led and specific
ally contemptu
ous of the district
attorney's meth
ods and ethics.

The D.A. charges Dr. Radin with
being a communist, and points out
that Dr. Radin believes six San
Francisco longshoremen he charged
with dynamiting were "framed."
What the D.A. means to say isn't
that Dr. Radin's alleged communism
is a crime. lie doesn't even mean
to make Dr. Radin's "frame-up"
charge a weapon in his light on the
accused professor.
All ho wants is to rile the public,
It will fight the professor to a bit
ter finish while the D.A. sits back
and watches the fun.
For Dr. Radin has signed his own
death warrant. He has committed
the cardinal professorial sin—talk
ing about his unoithodox thoughts,
having the public courage of his
private convictions.
* « * •
Now we feel justified in guessing
that Dr. Radin not only knows a
good deal more law than the D.A.,
but has a nodding acquaintance with
fields of knowledge the D A. hasn'c
»ven he,<rd of.
But there is one thing that the
D.A. knew that Di. Radin didn't;
that to Mr. and Mrs. Public, profes
sors are crackpots.
* it *
Dr. Padin forgot that as their
employee, he was not entitled to
say ihings opposed by the millions
of taxpayers who support the uni
versity. He forgot that to the aver
age man he was somewhat of a
parasite, living on public sufferance
with the boot of public disapproval

always behind him and always
ready for action. He forgot that pro
viding bed and board for a "high
brow" is something the public sel
dom does willingly, and will not do
at all if the professor doesn't at least
outwardly worship the principles
held sacred by the average man.
♦ * *
Today Dr. Radin is lighting with
every legal resource at his com*
mana to keep his job and his self
respect, but he hasn't a thing to say
about the outcome of his own battle.
That's up to the D.A., who holds the
throttle of the juggernaut called
public prejudice. All he has to do i;;
to see the right reporters, and Dr.
Radin's goose i*- cocked to a frazzle.
He will be forced out by the in
tolerance, bigotry and ignorance of
a public that demands their "serv
ants" too the intellectual mark. Dr.
Radin, you see, forgot that despite
his lifetime of learning, he was still
the servant of the merest grammar
school graduate who pays the bills.

tionul status as free men, two Uni
versity of California professors are
today "sitting on their hands."
They are Dr. Max Radin, world
famous legal authority, and Henry
Conover, assistant professor of eco-

nomics. Accord
ing to the district
attorney of Stan
islaus County, Dr.
Radin is generally
led and specific
ally contemptu
ous of the district
attorney's meth
ods and ethics.

The D.A. charges Dr. Radin with
being a communist, and points out
that Dr. Radin believes six San
Francisco longshoremen he charged
with dynamiting were "framed."
What the D.A. means to say isn't
that Dr. Radin's alleged communism
is a crime. lie doesn't even mean
to make Dr. Radin's "frame-up"
charge a weapon in his light on the
accused professor.
All ho wants is to rile the public,
It will fight the professor to a bit
ter finish while the D.A. sits back
and watches the fun.
For Dr. Radin has signed his own
death warrant. He has committed
the cardinal professorial sin—talk
ing about his unoithodox thoughts,
having the public courage of his
private convictions.
* « * •
Now we feel justified in guessing
that Dr. Radin not only knows a
good deal more law than the D.A.,
but has a nodding acquaintance with
fields of knowledge the D A. hasn'c
»ven he,<rd of.
But there is one thing that the
D.A. knew that Di. Radin didn't;
that to Mr. and Mrs. Public, profes
sors are crackpots.
* it *
Dr. Padin forgot that as their
employee, he was not entitled to
say ihings opposed by the millions
of taxpayers who support the uni
versity. He forgot that to the aver
age man he was somewhat of a
parasite, living on public sufferance
with the boot of public disapproval

always behind him and always
ready for action. He forgot that pro
viding bed and board for a "high
brow" is something the public sel
dom does willingly, and will not do
at all if the professor doesn't at least
outwardly worship the principles
held sacred by the average man.
♦ * *
Today Dr. Radin is lighting with
every legal resource at his com*
mana to keep his job and his self
respect, but he hasn't a thing to say
about the outcome of his own battle.
That's up to the D.A., who holds the
throttle of the juggernaut called
public prejudice. All he has to do i;;
to see the right reporters, and Dr.
Radin's goose i*- cocked to a frazzle.
He will be forced out by the in
tolerance, bigotry and ignorance of
a public that demands their "serv
ants" too the intellectual mark. Dr.
Radin, you see, forgot that despite
his lifetime of learning, he was still
the servant of the merest grammar
school graduate who pays the bills.
