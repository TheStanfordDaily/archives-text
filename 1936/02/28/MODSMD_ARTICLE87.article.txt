Trends in suits for spring and
early summer wear indicate impor- 5
lant changes only in cut and color I
patterns, according to advance re- j
ports on fashionable attire for the
male.
In continuing its fight for popu
larity with sports combinations of
coats and s'acks, the suit will soon
! lossom forth in colorful and attrac
ve patterns, with multi-stripe ma
ri::i featured. This latter develop
ment follows in the wake of the gen
al trend of stripes in preference
to checks.
Clothing stylists, in veering away
in the radical sports backs popu
in suits a reason or two ago, have <
dilied the fad in the new spring
,'i ments. Coats will be seen either
A r ith plain backs or with yokeless,
i a If-belt designs, the the. material
;'.irred or pleated at the waist.
