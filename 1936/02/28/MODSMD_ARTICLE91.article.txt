# Spring Brings Wrinkles In Toilet-Goods Combinations
## Manufacturers Put Razors In Brush As Part Of The New Spring Outfit 
### 
Combiners have been at work
again in the toilet-goods industry.
The latest wrinkle in shaving
kits is a clothes brush, believe it or
not. The top of the brush opens with
a zipper, revealing a shaving brush,
safety lazor and blades, and a metal
tube for a shaving stick. A comb is
concealed in a slot between the back
and the bristles. With such an outfit
the well-dressed rough may prance
off to the City with a minimum of
trouble and time.
Cigarette cases, another favorite
field for the gentlemen who put all
their eggs in one basket, have now
blossomed forth as combination cases
and lighters. Chief exponent of these
is Lektrolite, offering a handsome
case equipped with all the fixin's.
