# Only Sissies Tote Garters
## Are Sanctioned, However, For Use With Black Silk Socks and Tuxedo 
### Dave Botsford 
If you wear them, you're sissy; if
you don't, you're sloppy. That's the
enigmatic garter situation faced by
campus roughs.
How well you can take it will
probably decide the matter â€”if you
figure the added comfort and smooth
appearance more than make up for
the birds you'll get, go ahead and
wear the things. Personally, they
scratch.
There are times when garters are
legitimate: with black silk socks
and a tux, for instance.
Two garter-jumps ahead of Stan
ford, we hear, are most Eastern
campuses. Back there the Harvard
man, Princetonian, and Cornellite is
considered almost nude without
sock-holders.
