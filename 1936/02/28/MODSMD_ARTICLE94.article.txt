# Plain Pajamas Lead Styles
## Solid Shades Are Popular; Open at Throat Styles Replace V – Cut Neck 
### 
Pajamas—Model 1936— are mark
edly characterized by their extreme
simplicity, according to Esquire and
the most up to date authorities on
Ihp subject.
The college man prefers a solid
shade pajamu, preferably white or
black, with a narrow cord of a con
trasting color setting off the edges
of the garment. An open throat
with a lay-down collar is more pop
ular with him than either the Style
Russ with its high neck, introduced
last year, or the plain V-cut neck
which has been popular in pre
ceding years.
In tho East, lamb's fur collars are
quite popular on overcoats.
