# Men Should Wear Color Says Expert
## Brightly Hued Attires Is Man's Inherent Right, Says Leading Stylist 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 27 (/P).—Cus- I
torn tailors urged today that men, |
like male birds, wear the more gor- j
geous attire.
"If milady can effect reds, blues,
old rose and pastel shades, there is I
no reason for men to appear on the |
same scene in 10 or 20-year-old eve- ,
ning tails or tuxedo," said the tail- i
ors, here for their seventh annual ;
style show today.
"But, before we hope to acquaint j
men with their inherent right to j
color—a fact the birds and animals \
set the precedent lor —we hope to i
have each man, regardless of his j
station in life, acquire a full and |
complete wardrobe."
Man',3 greatest fault is in his I
choice of accessories, all at the show |
agree. As a result custom tailors j
will strive to familiarize men with 1
what should go with what, and
when'.
Fullness for Sport
Sports clothing is stressed in the j
show. The -one-time favorite Nor- !
folk jacket with belted effect has ;
many variations this season. Many [
coats lack the belt but have shoul- |
der ple;:ts for fullness and back, J
hidden pleats for the man of im
mense shoulder, but lesser waist
proportion.
Colored Evening Attire
Colors in evening attire especially
for hosts' coatings, are startling, i
One, a hunting red tuxedo with j
contrasting kummerbund, caused 1
many eyebrows to be raised. Others |
are in pastel and deeper shadings !
but with each, it was said, the black
or midnight blue dress trousers will
be worn.
They are called host coats, the
officials said, because it is realized
that for the present the departure
would be too much for all to digest.
"But if we can get the host wearing
them, others will fall in line in turn j
and eventually mere man may burst
forth in regal splendor which after !
all is his inherent right."
