# Congress To Face Taxes, Relief Next
## Administration Said To Favor Early Settlement of Fight Over Ocean-Mail Subsidies 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 1 (/P). —A
politically conscious Congress will
start tomorrow what Administration
leaders hope will be its final two
months of labor with only two major
obstacles ahead—taxes and relief.
Both of these issues are regarded
as loaded with potential dynamite
that may have detonating effects in
the coming presidential campaign.
Fiscal Policy at Stake
The whole fiscal policy of the
Government is bound up in the sub
jects saved for the preadjournment
floor battles. There will be other
fights, of course, before the legisla
tors trek homeward for political
fence building, but Administration
chiefs are not worried over their
outcome.
The White House, it is said, would
like very much to see the long
standing controversy over a dix-ect
ship subsidy bill ended and all
factions brought together on how to
displace existing ocean mail-subsidy
contracts. Unless a compromise is
reached by March 31 President Roo
sevelt imust cancel or modify these
agreements.
Other Bills Pending
Two other bills that will require
lengthy debate and may win presi
dential support, if modified, are the
pending Norris rural electrification
proposal and the Wagner low-cost
housing measure about ready for
introduction.
Democratic leader Robinson may
call up at any time between action
on appropriation bills his proposal
to strengthen the anti-trust law to
prevent discrimination in prices and
sale terms in favor of chain stores
in certain instances.
A check on the first two months of
congressional activity today showed
the House has only four more sup
ply bills and probably another defi
ciency measure to pass before ad
journment. The four are those for
the State, Justice, Commerce, and
Labor departments; the Navy, the
legislative, and the District of Co
lumbia.
Economy Urged
Reluctantly awaiting a $786,000,000
presidential tax message within 48
hours, Congress tonight heard a Na
tional Economy League demand to
curtail spending rather than "soak
the poor."
In a letter to all Senators and
Representatives, the League urged
rejection of a reported proposal that
farm relief "be paid out of a new
half-billion dollar tax on the Amer
ican breakfast table and the for
gotten man's shirt."

outcome.
The White House, it is said, would
like very much to see the long
standing controversy over a dix-ect
ship subsidy bill ended and all
factions brought together on how to
displace existing ocean mail-subsidy
contracts. Unless a compromise is
reached by March 31 President Roo
sevelt imust cancel or modify these
agreements.
Other Bills Pending
Two other bills that will require
lengthy debate and may win presi
dential support, if modified, are the
pending Norris rural electrification
proposal and the Wagner low-cost
housing measure about ready for
introduction.
Democratic leader Robinson may
call up at any time between action
on appropriation bills his proposal
to strengthen the anti-trust law to
prevent discrimination in prices and
sale terms in favor of chain stores
in certain instances.
A check on the first two months of
congressional activity today showed
the House has only four more sup
ply bills and probably another defi
ciency measure to pass before ad
journment. The four are those for
the State, Justice, Commerce, and
Labor departments; the Navy, the
legislative, and the District of Co
lumbia.
Economy Urged
Reluctantly awaiting a $786,000,000
presidential tax message within 48
hours, Congress tonight heard a Na
tional Economy League demand to
curtail spending rather than "soak
the poor."
In a letter to all Senators and
Representatives, the League urged
rejection of a reported proposal that
farm relief "be paid out of a new
half-billion dollar tax on the Amer
ican breakfast table and the for
gotten man's shirt."
WASHINGTON, March 1 (/P). —A
politically conscious Congress will
start tomorrow what Administration
leaders hope will be its final two
months of labor with only two major
obstacles ahead—taxes and relief.
Both of these issues are regarded
as loaded with potential dynamite
that may have detonating effects in
the coming presidential campaign.
Fiscal Policy at Stake
The whole fiscal policy of the
Government is bound up in the sub
jects saved for the preadjournment
floor battles. There will be other
fights, of course, before the legisla
tors trek homeward for political
fence building, but Administration
chiefs are not worried over their
outcome.
