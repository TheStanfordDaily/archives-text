# Hoover War Library Displays Memoirs
## 
### 
Personal memoirs and accounts of
the World War are displayed by the
Hoover War Library this week.
Items range from General Per- i
shing's authoritative autobiography j
to "The Big Show," by Elsie Janis.
Of especial interest is the fact that 1
many modern-day authors are rep
resented. Hervey Allen, of "Anthony
Adverse" fame, is author of |
"Toward (he Flame," a diary of his
experiences at the front. Edith '
Wharton offers "Fighting France: 1
From Dunquerque to Belfort." Ir
vin S. Cobb and Ring Lardrier are i
each represented.
