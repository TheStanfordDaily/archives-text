(Daily)
The financial situation of the
University will be considered from
two aspects. We shall first discuss
the permanent income-producing
endowment of the University, and
secondly, the position of the Uni
versity with respect to its operating
income.
The total assets of the University
as of August 31, 1935, amounted to
$40,525,324. Of this amount the sum
of $31,863,977 represented income
producing endowment assets of the
University. The balance represented
value of plant and other non-in
come-producing assets. Included in
these assets were bonds of a total
par value of $24,500,806, corporate
stocks with a value of $461,166, and
mortgages totaling $1,750,000. The
bonds were distributed as follows:
Petroleum Corporations ... $ 467,829
Steam Railroads 8,895,052
Street and Interurban Rail
roads 738,783
Other Public Utilities 8,498,374
Federal, State, and Munici
pal 1,243,784
Office and Other Buildings. 1,157,053
Industrial 2,861,359
Foreign Corporations and
Cities 503,895
Farm 9,998
Real Estate and Mortgages. 124,679
In explanation of the fact that the
University already owns some
stocks, it should be pointed out that
these securities have come to the
University as gifts and do not repre
sent investment of the original en
dowment.
Action Limited
Incidentally, the recent court ac
tion was limited to the original
Stanford endowment: Under the
provisions of the Stanford grant,
donors have the right to prescribe
the terms of investment covering
their gifts to the University, and
several gifts of stocks have been
made. In other cases the donors
have specifically provided that the
University should have the power
to invest in stocks.
The amount of endowment ior
general maintenance originally re
ceived from Leland and Jane La
throp Stanford was $21,297,336. Since
the original foundation the Univer
sity has received additional endow
ment from gifts for general main
tenance in the total sum of $166,-
537.50. making a total of $21,464,273.
Endowment Increase
The original endowment from the
founders shows a capital increase
since endowment of $4,494,144. This
increase is a tribute to the sound
management of the Stanford trust
ees.
The total amount now available is
unrestricted endowment for general
maintenance of the University from
all these sources is $25,958,417. The
balance of the income-producing
endowment of the University is rep
resented in restricted endowments
given for specific purposes amount
ing to $6,905,558.
It is the history of every univer
sity that, more gifts are received for
restricted purposes than for general
maintenance. In some instances the i
burden of maintaining and operating
buildings given to universities as ,
gifts, out of income from the univer- ,
sity's general endowment, has be- i
come so heavy that it has been nec- .
essary for trustees to prescribe that ]
any gifts for buildings must be ac- ,
companied with endowment for
their maintenance.
Increase Necessary
When one considers that unre
tricted gifts for general purposes 1
have amounted to less than 1 per |
cent of the original endowment, but j
that the number of students and !
faculty members has almost trebled j
and the physical plant has more than j
doubled in the last 20 years, it will j
be realized that Stanford is reaching j
the point where it must increase its
available endowment for general
purposes.
Each new building adds a burden I
on the general endowment for heat- j
ing, lighting, janitor service, and j
other maintenance costs. Further- i
more, each new gift made for aca- |
demic purposes adds a burden in |
the form of administration and j
general overhead costs on the un- J
restricted endowment of the Uni- |
versity.
Although the University at the !
i

present time has bonds of a total par
value of $3,604,450 in interest default,
the principal of the trust is quite se
cure and the University is not likely
to suffer a great loss as a result of
defaults in principal. The largest
single holding in default as to in
terest consists of Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railway bonds in
the amount of $1,500,000 which are
very well secured in principal.
