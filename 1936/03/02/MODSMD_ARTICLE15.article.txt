### 
WITH THE NORTHERN ITAL
IAN ARMY IN ETHIOPIA, AT THE
FRONT, March 1 (/P).â€”'The Ethio
pian army of Ras Kassa in the Tem
bien area was destroyed today like
that of Ras Mulugheta was two
weeks ago.
Kassa fled with a few followers,
leaving the heaviest losses in men,
animals, and munitions.
Five thousand Ethiopians left in
the Tembien area are completely
surrounded but still holding Abbi
Addi. They face extermination or
necessary surrender as the third
artmy corps of white soldiers and an
Eritrean corps pour artillery fire
into the town.
Round Italian estimates placed the
Ethiopian dead at 10,000 and the
Italian at not over 1000 from a string
of severe fights starting the night
of February 26.
Planes are following the retreating
warrior columns across the Gheva
and Takazze rivers, bombing them
heavily. Italian pilots reported the
Ethiopians are throwing away their
guns, swords, and munitions in order
to appear as peasants.
