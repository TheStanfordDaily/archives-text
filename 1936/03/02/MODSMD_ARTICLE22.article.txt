known as the "Jinx Pavilion," when
Stanford's greatest hoop team rap
ped out a 40-26 victory over Cali
fornia. More will be made next Sat
urday night in that pavilion when
i Stanford and U.S.C. play for the
' Southern Conference championship.
The Trojans cinched their chances
|by crushing U.C.L.A. 55-28
At only one time in the game did
the California team lead and that
was in the first five minutes of play
when Ray Olson sank a field goal
to put his team ahead 2-1. From
then on the Indians put on consist
ent pressure and succeeded in
building up a 19-10 margin at half
time.
At the start of the second half,
Stanford, as if showing their mastery
and complete domination of the
game, allowed California to creep

up within two points of them at
22-20. Working on this two-point
margin, the Indians had established
a 34-25 lead in a few minutes, and
went on to win handily 40-26.
Flashing an offense they have
not displayed for several games,
the Stanford five drew out the
Bear defense time and again to
j sink easy set-ups. The score rising
; against them in the first half,
j found the Bears throwing the ball
away and shooting wild in an at
tempt to cope with the team they
thought was "easy meat."
Captain Ray Olson, "Chief Cud
geler" Herwig, and "Amorous" Don
Jensen, who delighted in hooking
j his arm around Howell Turner's
■ neck, all left the game via the four
| personal foul route, and allowed the
i Indians to cash in on 10 out of 14
I free I brows.
j Howell Turner played one of the
| best games of his career, garnering
9 points and displaying an aggres
siveness that broke up many a Cali
fornia play. "Hank "Luisetti was
high-point man for the evening with
11. Arl Stoefen with tough luck on a
couple of shots paced Turner with
D points also. Jack Calderwood loop
ed in 7 points besides playing a
j bang-up defensive game at guard.
Captain Dinty Moore, with only
I three points was the steadying in-
I fluence on the Cardinal team when
i it threatened to get a little wild.
