ABE KUEF IS DEAD.
Every Californian should know
the story of one of the state's most j
spectacular men. Ruef was no car- !
toon political boss. He wasn't fat
and big, and never wore a plaid
weskit with a huge watch chain j
draped over a pot-belly, for he didn't ;
have a pot-belly. He was small, thin j
and Jewish —no Irishman like the |
political bosses we have come to :
know through the caricatures in the
muck-raking days.
HE WASN'T like the Eastern j
bosses who knew the men and the ,
system and little else. He went to j
California. He was an honor stu- |
dent — potential Phi Bete — and a
leader during his school days.
With $8 and some friends he !
started the co-operative store at j
Berkeley. "We started that store to '
£ive the students cheaper text
books. They were very expensive in '
that day."

RUEF'S POLITICAL career be- |
gan in 1902. San Francisco was even j
in those days a "union labor town." I
And Ruef was the first organizer to i
realize the strength of the labor j
organization.
lie chose from the Musician's
U lien a bearde.l, jovial, and pop- j
ular violinist by the name of
Schmitz and made that man the i
mayor of San Francisco.
By 1906, Ruef was the power be- j
bind the city government and run- 1
niug things pretty well as he liked. J
Then came the prick that burst the j
bubble of Ruef's power —the earth- ;
quake and fire on April 18, 190(5.
TIIE EARTHQUAKE purged the
city of its political boss. During the |
reconstruction period there arose a I
scandal over the renewing of li- |
censes for "French restaurants." j
Ruef as attorney for the restaurant
powers, interceded with the Police
Commission and had his stooge,
Mayor Schmitz, change the person- j
nel of that commission so that the |
licenses would be renewed by j
"friendlier" commissioners.
The reform movement under the j
direction of Rudolph Spreckels and j
James D. Phelan, later U.S. Senator, |
got on Ruef's tail for this, and the
famous "graft prosecutions" of 1906,
1907, and 1908 took place.
THE PROSEC UTION was a spec
tacular one. Heney, the prosecut
ing attorney, was shot in the neck j
by Haas, a mechanic. Heney lived, i
but Haas committed suicide in his j
cell at the County Jail with a pis- '
tol he had hid in his old-fashioned i
gaiters on being admitted to the
prison.
Then came Rabble-rouser Hiram j
Johnson. He volunteered to carry |
on the prosecution of Ruef. He se- j
cured a conviction and the case j
made him famous. In 1910 he was
elected governor of California.
THE FAMOUS TRIALS made
more than one man famous. Detec
tive William J. Burns became a na- j
tional figure for his work in the case. I
It was said at the time that Ruef I
changed his plea to guilty because |
Burns used the third degree to |
murderous intensity by keeping j
Ruef awake day and night by high- j
powered lights shining constantly in I
his face.
MUC K-RAKER LINCOLN STEF- i
FENS was on the job. He reported !
the trial nationally. It was just his j
meat.
So the boss was indicted with the |
man whom he had made mayor. !
Ruef was released from San Quen
tin in 1915, after finally being sen
tenced in 1911 to 14 years imprison
ment for 4iis connection with the
"graft cases." Governor Stephens j
pardoned him in 1920. Since then he J

I had bceome a picayunish real estate !
! agent. And the only place his name '
I appeared after years of being in the j
| newspaper headlines was on the
i door of his small two-room office in
J a shabby office building on Kearny
| Street — "ABE RUEF — REAL ES
| TATE."
THAT'S ALL that was left of the
] name of the man who had once
| ruled San Francisco —the man whose j
' career was second only to the quake 1
j and fire of 1906 as San Francisco's '■
j biggest local excitement.
