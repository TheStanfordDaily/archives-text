# Ingenious Crashers Use Trees, Uniforms. Baseball Comps To Get View of California Game
## 
### R. B. Jones 
If a man wants to see a basket
ball game he's going to see it, as was
proved when rooters without ducats
stormed the Pavilion Friday night.
"Red" (heavy duty), on guard,
climbed a ladder and grappled with
two obstinate Oakland high school
ers on a 12-inch ledge jutting from
the highest pavilion windows. This
act of justice was witnessed by four
more rooters who swayed undis
turbed in the branches of a nearby
pine tree.
Wears Uniform
One ingenious gate-crasher walk
ed nonchalantly through the turn
stiles bedecked in his cardinal band
uniform that he had brutally taken
from a timid player.
Others had seven cents and pushed
baseball "comps" in the innocent
usher's hands, and then went to see
the baseball game on the following
day by using their student body
cards.
Roughs Climb Tree
One group of stormers by use of
a well situated tree climbed on to
one of the lower tile roofs only to
be invited down by guards. Not to
be stopped by one refusal, one of
them "shinnied" up a window, and
he rlid right into the waiting arms
of the ever-watchful guards.
Paly High was well represented
by boys who climbed up over the
handball fences and knocked on
doors till someone came to make
them stop. They rushed the door
without success.
One fellow even thought of rush
ing the band drummer and hiding
inside his drum . . .
