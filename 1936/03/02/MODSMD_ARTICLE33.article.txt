# Modern Writers Too Limited, Says Walpole
## English Novelist Emphasizes Correlation of Imagination, Reality in San Mateo Talk 
### Grant Leibert 
Tht main concern of the novelist j
should be to tell .an interesting 1
story, "not to exploit himself, his
characters, or his period as a case j
study in psychology," maintained {
Hugh Walpole, English novelist, in
his discussion of "The Author and
the Modern Novel" Friday evening
at the San Mateo Junior College.
To the detriment of the novel as j
something one can read for enjoy- ;
ment and relaxation, Mr. Walpole
said, the modern writer too defi- j
nitely tends to limit himself to the
presentation of what he considers j
"truth," or "reality," and thereby j
ignores the intangible, transcend- j
ental qualities of life.
Overlooks Religion
Proceeding from the assumption
that only what he can see or touch j
is real, the modern realistic novelist i
overlooks the "third distance," thp j
philosophic or religious elements of j
life, and is thus, by the narrow
rigidity of his own strictures, de
feating his avowed purpose —to pre
sent life as it really is.
Admitting that he was a romantic
and mystic, Mr. Walpole confessed
his inability to think of as real a
life which had no connection with 1
another life to come.
For the most' part, he chose to be
witty and discerningly facetious in j
speaking of his contemporaries.
Henry James, "father of the intel- I
lectual post-war novel," and his fol
lowers were characterized as sur- i
geons who sawed for several chap- j
ters on their characters' heads until
they had removed the crown and j
were able to probe for the "idea," j
which, in the last chapter, was j
placed under the microscope for the |
reader's inspection.
"Reading Aldous Huxley is like
watching several goldfish circling
around in a bowl: they just open ]
and close their mouths, and never j
get anywhere," Mr. Walpole assert- j
ed, "with all due respect to Mr. j
Huxley." '

"Imagination and sympathy are
two of the most conspicuously ab
sent elements in the modern novel,"
affirmed Mr. Walpole, "without
which no novel has ever achieved
greatness."
Modern Writers Afraid
The modern novelist, if he has
imagination and sympathy, seems
afraid to exhibit them. His only
concern is with reality and tech
nique. His unpleasant pessimistic
attitude leads one to believe only
that there is nothing worth while
to write about. He seems to lack
the strength to rise up, look about,
and see that writing has always been
| conditioned by the period in which
[ it was written; he seems to have
| lost his individuality, and with it
I the power to express what in his
i heart he really believes, not what
1 he has been taught to think.

"Reading Aldous Huxley is like
watching several goldfish circling
around in a bowl: they just open ]
and close their mouths, and never j

Huxley." '

"Imagination and sympathy are
two of the most conspicuously ab
sent elements in the modern novel,"
affirmed Mr. Walpole, "without
which no novel has ever achieved
greatness."
Modern Writers Afraid
The modern novelist, if he has
imagination and sympathy, seems
afraid to exhibit them. His only
concern is with reality and tech
nique. His unpleasant pessimistic
attitude leads one to believe only
that there is nothing worth while
to write about. He seems to lack
the strength to rise up, look about,
and see that writing has always been
| conditioned by the period in which
[ it was written; he seems to have
| lost his individuality, and with it
I the power to express what in his
i heart he really believes, not what
1 he has been taught to think.
Tht main concern of the novelist j
should be to tell .an interesting 1
story, "not to exploit himself, his
characters, or his period as a case j
study in psychology," maintained {
Hugh Walpole, English novelist, in
his discussion of "The Author and
the Modern Novel" Friday evening
at the San Mateo Junior College.
To the detriment of the novel as j
something one can read for enjoy- ;
ment and relaxation, Mr. Walpole
said, the modern writer too defi- j
nitely tends to limit himself to the
presentation of what he considers j
"truth," or "reality," and thereby j
ignores the intangible, transcend- j
ental qualities of life.
Overlooks Religion
Proceeding from the assumption
that only what he can see or touch j
is real, the modern realistic novelist i
overlooks the "third distance," thp j
philosophic or religious elements of j
life, and is thus, by the narrow
rigidity of his own strictures, de
feating his avowed purpose —to pre
sent life as it really is.
Admitting that he was a romantic
and mystic, Mr. Walpole confessed
his inability to think of as real a
life which had no connection with 1
another life to come.
For the most' part, he chose to be
witty and discerningly facetious in j
speaking of his contemporaries.
Henry James, "father of the intel- I
lectual post-war novel," and his fol

geons who sawed for several chap- j
