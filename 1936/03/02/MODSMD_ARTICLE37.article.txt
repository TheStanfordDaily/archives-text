# Card Nine Beats Santa Clara By 5 to 3 Score
## Heads-Up Ball Gives Stanford Victory in League Contest Played Here Last Saturday 
### 
Playing heads-up baseball all the
way, Coach Harry Welter's fast
improving varsity nine won its
first conference victory Saturday
afternoon by defeating the Santa
Clara Broncos, 5-3.
This was the first conference ap
pearance of the Cards on the local
diamond and makes their record in
conference competition one victory
and one defeat.
The strong St. Mary's nine which
defeated the Indians in their first
start last Wednesday also defeated
California Saturday afternoon, 7-6.
Stanford scoring was mainly con
fined to one inning, the fourth. After
Santa Clara had batted in two runs
in her half of this inning, the
Cards came back with a rush to
score four runs, and take a lead
which the Broncos could not over
come.
Ray Weiershauser and Glenn
Hamilton pitched for Stanford.
All four runs were scored after
two were out, as two-hit batsmen
and a base on balls granted by Larry
Bertolani, the Santa Clara pitcher,
were followed by solid hits from
Dari'el Holman and Glenn Hamilton.
Batting honors for the day went
to Holman, who drove out a double
and two singles in four trips to the
plate, while Leo Heagerty and Bill
Newsom starred in the field, each of
them having a sensational catch to
his credit.
Newsom's marvelous catch of
Bassi's hard drive in the ninth inn
ing, provided the last out of the
game and shut off a threatening
Santa Clara rally.

Playing heads-up baseball all the
way, Coach Harry Welter's fast
improving varsity nine won its
first conference victory Saturday
afternoon by defeating the Santa
Clara Broncos, 5-3.
This was the first conference ap
pearance of the Cards on the local
diamond and makes their record in
conference competition one victory
and one defeat.
The strong St. Mary's nine which
defeated the Indians in their first
start last Wednesday also defeated
California Saturday afternoon, 7-6.
Stanford scoring was mainly con
fined to one inning, the fourth. After
Santa Clara had batted in two runs
in her half of this inning, the
Cards came back with a rush to
score four runs, and take a lead
which the Broncos could not over
come.
Ray Weiershauser and Glenn
Hamilton pitched for Stanford.
All four runs were scored after
two were out, as two-hit batsmen
and a base on balls granted by Larry
Bertolani, the Santa Clara pitcher,
were followed by solid hits from
Dari'el Holman and Glenn Hamilton.
Batting honors for the day went
to Holman, who drove out a double
and two singles in four trips to the
plate, while Leo Heagerty and Bill
Newsom starred in the field, each of
them having a sensational catch to
his credit.
Newsom's marvelous catch of
Bassi's hard drive in the ninth inn
ing, provided the last out of the
game and shut off a threatening
Santa Clara rally.
