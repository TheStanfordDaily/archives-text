BEAT THE BEAKS
AT OWN GAME

A few points shimmering about j
the campus after the win over Cal: 1
1. Stanford to play S.C. here Sat
urday night for the Southern Divi
sion Conference title, probably fa
vored.
2. The rise of basketball as a
money-making sport to the 8.A.C., ;
with a sell-out, waiting list attend- •
ance.
3. The return of Cap Dinty Moore
as a heady floor leader and steady- |
ing influence.
4. Definite evidence that Angelo
Luisetti. Howell Turner, and Jack
Caldcrwood are of all-Coast cali
ber.
5. Assurance that the smooth
passing Cards can descend into the
rough-tough charge - 'em - Herwig I
type of play when authorized.
(I. And that Card rooters can j
boo when judicious, and that this 1
good sportsmanship stuff is a dis
agreeable, irrational mixture of ,
straw, hooey, and tommyrot, when
we play a Cal basketball team.

HERE'S YOUR 1!)36
ALL CONFERENCE FIVE

Which leads us naturally to the
103(5 All-Conference team. There's
not much doubt any more about
who .should go on it. With Stan
lord i's probably the best basketball
ti; 'ii in (he circuit, three Cards get

berths. Here it is: simple, sweet, and
a fancy five.
Iloweli Turner (S). forward.
Jack Hupp (S.C., forward 1

John Ball (U?C.L.A.), center.
Ilank Luisetti (S), guard.
Jack Calderwood (S), guard.
Spotting Hank at guard is no
butch. Even if he wouldn't bo a
I swell guard, it doesn't make much
difference what position on the floor
a guy plays anyway.
On the second team you'd want
Gracin and Olsen as forwards,
Stoefen at center, and Moore and
Oram at guards.
ADD A WHOOP or two for the
baseball team. They fielded well
and hit okay to beat Santa Clara
Saturday afternoon in the finest
possible ball weather.
It was a conference game, so Wol
-1 tcr's nine is doing .500. —Breed

Spotting Hank at guard is no
butch. Even if he wouldn't bo a
I swell guard, it doesn't make much
difference what position on the floor
a guy plays anyway.
On the second team you'd want
Gracin and Olsen as forwards,
Stoefen at center, and Moore and
Oram at guards.
ADD A WHOOP or two for the
baseball team. They fielded well
and hit okay to beat Santa Clara
Saturday afternoon in the finest
possible ball weather.
It was a conference game, so Wol
-1 tcr's nine is doing .500. —Breed
BEAT THE BEAKS
AT OWN GAME

A few points shimmering about j
the campus after the win over Cal: 1
1. Stanford to play S.C. here Sat
urday night for the Southern Divi
sion Conference title, probably fa
vored.
2. The rise of basketball as a
money-making sport to the 8.A.C., ;
with a sell-out, waiting list attend- •
ance.
3. The return of Cap Dinty Moore
as a heady floor leader and steady- |
ing influence.
4. Definite evidence that Angelo
Luisetti. Howell Turner, and Jack
Caldcrwood are of all-Coast cali
ber.
5. Assurance that the smooth
passing Cards can descend into the
rough-tough charge - 'em - Herwig I
type of play when authorized.
(I. And that Card rooters can j
boo when judicious, and that this 1
good sportsmanship stuff is a dis
agreeable, irrational mixture of ,
straw, hooey, and tommyrot, when
we play a Cal basketball team.

HERE'S YOUR 1!)36
ALL CONFERENCE FIVE

Which leads us naturally to the
103(5 All-Conference team. There's
not much doubt any more about
who .should go on it. With Stan
lord i's probably the best basketball
ti; 'ii in (he circuit, three Cards get

berths. Here it is: simple, sweet, and
a fancy five.
