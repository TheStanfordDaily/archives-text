## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism With $115 Involved, the Rough Isn't A Bad Risk for a Five-Buck Check 
### 
In a few short days, the sign goes up in the
Cellar to the cflcct that no checks are cashed
until the beginning of next quarter.
This is a very interesting fact. Another
interesting fact is that the Cellar will not cash
student checks over *2, while next door, a
barber cashes them in practically unlimited
amounts.
Other interesting facts are that the Union
is run for the convenience of the students,
that students are still paying -Si a quarter as
part of the Union fee, and that the barber has
had only two checks bounce against him in
15 years.
Now it is granted that il would be an incon
venience to maintain enough cash on hand
to cash student checks, but il is also incon
venient for the student to be limited to $2
checks.
The Cellar, through the University, has the
means of [jutting the screws on the student,
through the cancellation of registration. Jim,
the Union barber, finds it good business to
cash checks without such protection. Surely,
a *5 limit on checks should not be too much
to expect from a business that is run for the
convenience of the students.
