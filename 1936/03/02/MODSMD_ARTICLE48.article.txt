# They're Still Shopping For an Apathy-Shaker

### 
Success to date of Stanford's Concert Series
proves to many that culture is actually exist
ent among Farm students. To others, how
ever, it emphasizes an entirely different fact:
that the number of factors which can shake
the average apathetic student from his usual
round of library, Frantic, and Sunday eve
ning suppers is highly limited.
The Concert Series did it with "big names,"
always luring; the new theater will do it with
its novelty, at least for a while; the basketball
team has done it with a chance at a confer
ence title.
So far, Dramatic Council has been able to
turn the trick only with Gaieties and other
musical productions of a light nature. Sooner
or later, however, it may, by word-of-mouth
propaganda, educate blase Stanford to the
fact that even local-talent drama may be
worth the students' valuable time, of a Friday
evening. When this time comes, another
apathy-shaker will have been invented.
