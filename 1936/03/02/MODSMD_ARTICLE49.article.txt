### 
Ii.A.C. moguls arc deeply repentant this
week.
They were deeply repentant last week when
the Pavilion had been sold out, but there was
nothing to do about it then.
Anyway, with the Stanford S.C. playoff
coming up Saturday, the Hoard has taken
precautions against student squawks, and
has marked its sales booth "for students only"
until Wednesday morning. Only tickets left
over from today's and tomorrow's pawing
ovcr by students will go on public display.
