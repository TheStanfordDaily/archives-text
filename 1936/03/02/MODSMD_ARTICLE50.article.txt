# ...And Santa Claus Comes in the Spring
## 
### 
A warm sun. Green grass. Canoeing. A
world of blue sky and green hills is all that
is important. Spring on the Farm! (That is,

if il isn't snowing this morning.) Nothing is
closer to heaven on this earth than Farm Cli
mate on the Farm, unless it is a car traveling
75 011 the Bayshorc.
Brotherly love rules the world. The Japa
nese don't hate the Chinese. The Germans
don't hate the French. Nobody calls anybody
else a liar. There are no vested interests.
Every man born in a log cabin can be Presi
dent some day. Dramatic Council will make
money. Students will get an education. The
snail's on the thorn.
Ah, spring, you make fools of us all!
