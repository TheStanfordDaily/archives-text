Now that spring is here, what are you going to
do about it? Of course, the good book says spring is
sprung, but there have been instances of springing in
winter. Summer is also good for romance and romance
is good for you, and you are good for nothing, because
you are here in college on your old man's money. There
is also a good deal of springing in the fall, and a good
deal of falling in sprunging. Spring is here. True
Confession is good for the soul. True Story is good
for the heels. But spring. It is good for nothing, be
cause it is here on your old man's money. What are
you going to do about it? Spring is here. Are you
going to take it lying down?
Yes.
There is one nice thing about the Far East—it is
o much nearer than the Near E;ist. This is a paradox.
A paradox is distinguished from a paradise in that
you cannot gamble with a paradox.
Then, too, a paradox can fall in love and soon there
will be a floxadox. A paradox can then spend its
spring laying down.
This has nothing to do with bits of flufT, or fuzzie
wuzzies, but the Alpha Phi house seems like home to
the Alpha Phis. But that's nothing, it seems like home
to some Alpha Delta Phis, too. Anyway, there used to
be a feud for thought between these two tongs. The
feud started when the Alpha Delts started singing
hymns in the showers, and singeing hers with their
flashlights.
But it all ended last week, when the Alpha Phis
had an Alpha Delt house mother. It seems that a
graduate of the latter brotherhood is a professor and
.m illustrious authority on who the Japanese are kill
ing these days. His wife is a good friend of Mrs.
Holman, the Alpha Phi housemother. These two Indies
were going out for the evening, so Mr. Treat sug
gested that he take the place of the Alpha Phi house
mother. This was speedily arranged.
So the Alpha Delt alumnus sat in the house mother's
chair, insisting that he was Mrs. Holman, demanded
that the girls use better manners at the table, and
generally conducted himself as the last word in house
mothers.
The Alpha Phis will now probably claim Our Hasher
is spending his spring in some low-down lieing.

winter. Summer is also good for romance and romance
is good for you, and you are good for nothing, because
you are here in college on your old man's money. There
is also a good deal of springing in the fall, and a good
deal of falling in sprunging. Spring is here. True
Confession is good for the soul. True Story is good
for the heels. But spring. It is good for nothing, be
cause it is here on your old man's money. What are
you going to do about it? Spring is here. Are you
going to take it lying down?
Yes.
There is one nice thing about the Far East—it is
o much nearer than the Near E;ist. This is a paradox.
A paradox is distinguished from a paradise in that
you cannot gamble with a paradox.
Then, too, a paradox can fall in love and soon there
will be a floxadox. A paradox can then spend its
spring laying down.
This has nothing to do with bits of flufT, or fuzzie
wuzzies, but the Alpha Phi house seems like home to
the Alpha Phis. But that's nothing, it seems like home
to some Alpha Delta Phis, too. Anyway, there used to
be a feud for thought between these two tongs. The
feud started when the Alpha Delts started singing
hymns in the showers, and singeing hers with their
flashlights.
But it all ended last week, when the Alpha Phis
had an Alpha Delt house mother. It seems that a
graduate of the latter brotherhood is a professor and
.m illustrious authority on who the Japanese are kill
ing these days. His wife is a good friend of Mrs.
Holman, the Alpha Phi housemother. These two Indies
were going out for the evening, so Mr. Treat sug
gested that he take the place of the Alpha Phi house
mother. This was speedily arranged.
So the Alpha Delt alumnus sat in the house mother's
chair, insisting that he was Mrs. Holman, demanded
that the girls use better manners at the table, and
generally conducted himself as the last word in house
mothers.
The Alpha Phis will now probably claim Our Hasher
is spending his spring in some low-down lieing.
Now that spring is here, what are you going to
do about it? Of course, the good book says spring is
sprung, but there have been instances of springing in
winter. Summer is also good for romance and romance
is good for you, and you are good for nothing, because
you are here in college on your old man's money. There
is also a good deal of springing in the fall, and a good
