# Fair Play Might Help the Code
## 
### 
If a protestor in the Letters column of Time
is to be believed, the expulsion of 10 students
at North Carolina University for cheating was
an asinine way of handling the affair.
After declaring that the affair gave N.C.U.
a black eye, produced a permanent bad effect
on the 40 victims, and did not prove the stu
dents were at fault, the letter-writer hit the
nail on the head when he said that the trouble
lay in the education system.
"... I am a graduate of Penn State, which
is noted for its Penn State Honor Code. Still
there is cheating. Yet there is no cheating in
classes conducted by profs who play fair with
the students," the letter said in part.
The understanding Men's and Women's
Councils are attempting to gain between pro
fessors and students, whereby the profs will
"play fair with the students," may help clean
Honor Code skirts on the Stanford campus.
