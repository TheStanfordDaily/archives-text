(From the U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin)
Boogey, boogey, boogey.
Another red menace.
And this time it is not the students, but the pro
fessors, two of them at the University of California at
Berkeley, who are undermining the morals and bour
gois sentiments of young America.
The whole program of communist destruction might
never have been publicly known had it not been for
the district attorney of Modesto, California. In a letter
to President Sprout, Mr. Clearly, the D.A. of Modesto,
said the University ought to get rid of Max Radin,
professor of law, and Harry Conover, teaching assist
ant in economics, because "they addressed commun
ist meetings."

And not only that, but the two instructors had been
"consorting with such people as Harry Bridges and
Ella Winter." Bridges is affiliated with the Seamen's
labor union in San Francisco, and Ella Winter is the
wife of the very great man Lincoln Steffens.
As for Professor Radin, the appalling thing about
this discovery of his injudicious sympathies is that the
man has been a member of the Berkeley teaching
staff since 1919. And in 17 years, the number of stu
dents exposed to Radin's doctrines obviously consti
tutes a genuine force for the immediate dislocation of
the society of District Attorney Cleary.

The District Attorney of Modesto may be a per
fectly good patriot and a perfectly good crime dc
tector, but the one charge he will find difficult to
avoid is his indecent indiscrimination in the handling
of the English language.
Mr. Cleary said in his letter to President Sproul
that the retention of "such men" as Radin and Conover
was "nothing less than an outrage to the intelligence
of the people who support the institution."
Not exactly the intelligence, Mr. Cleary. Perhaps
the prejudices.
