## OUR INDIVIDUALISTIC PROFESSORS 
### 
The only group of employes in the
world who are literally a law unto
themselves, who are hired at high
salaries to do their job in almost any
manner they see fit are right under
our knowledge-seeking-out noses.
They are the college professors.
"You teach American history," a
college board of regents will com
mand a new hireling, and forth he

goes to teach
American history
in his own way.
He can give the
kind of exams,
lectures, and as
signments he
wants to. He re
tires behind the
closed door of

classroom and dispenses knowledge

j ings, the professors are advantage
j takers—in this case of the freedom
I allowed them.

For example, many a college pro
fessor is dogmatic about the way he
: teaches. He decides on a course of 1
! procedure and will stick by it re
j gardless of the results it achieves.
; Sometimes he lAiows what he is
trying to accomplish in a course, but
i if he does, he seldom pauses to
consider whether or not he is ac
complishing it.

If a stump puller can't pull
: stumps with his out-of-date stump
puller, he looks around for some

way of putting it over.
