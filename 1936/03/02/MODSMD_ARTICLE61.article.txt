# INSIDE, OUTSIDE THE LAW

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Just like Mr. Wyant, I can't think
why he wanted to write the letter ,
that he did. Since residence in Santa (
Barbara apparently qualifies one as
an authority, I should like to go on
record as having lived in that town
for a number of years, and make a i
few further comments.
I'm sorry I can't feel even a little i
appreciative towards dear Chief
Davis, although I understand his J
gangster methods are saving Los;
Angeles business men quite a lot of
money. In any case, Mr. Wyant I
completely missed the point.
What annoys me is that the pros- j
ent border patrol came about at the j
suggestion of the Chamber of Com- j
merce. Now that. Mr. Wyant, does
n't look like democracy.
It is a remarkable fact that in
this country some people seem to !
be above the law, while others are i
just outside it. This-situation is j
largely due to persons such as Mr. j
Wyant who are ready to overlook 1
irregularities when they "consider j
them advisable.
There are too many pleas of cx- !
tenuating circumstances. Men are j
lynched, murderers escape trial, |
civil rights are denied, and all the j
while the officials responsible are |
excused by irrational and prejudiced
persons who compose the public. |
A nation deserves the kind of gov- ,
ernment it has: I suppose Mr. Wyant '
finds everything quite satisfactory.
