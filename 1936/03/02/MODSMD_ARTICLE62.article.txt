The Editor, Sir:
On last Friday a Vox Campi
writer assumed that Stanford stu
dents desire peace. In the interest
of that desire she presented four
arguments and a conclusion, point
ing out how the United States gov
ernment and Stanford University
arc shamefully disregarding this de
sire.
Now a few contradictions:
1. The League of Nations has ef
| fectually demonstrated its impo
! tency.
i 2. Military training, such as that
| given in the R.0.T.C., does not lead
to war. No part of the population
wants war less than those who must
fight and die.
3. Americans do not want war.
i But all nations do not enjoy eeo-
I nomic and political set-ups comp
arable to our own. Witness the state
of Germany under the despotism of
an irresponsible and fanatical dicta
j torship.
4. E\en the highly peaceful U.S.
; S.R. believes in security and that
skin-saving wails, like charity,
J should begin at home.
The highest ideals cannot eradi
cate the inherent baseness of human
nature which leads to war. Armed
j conflict, though terribly wrong, is
| inevitable for quite a long time.
I Somebody will get the axe; it is
| our natural duty to prevent our
| being on the receiving end.
