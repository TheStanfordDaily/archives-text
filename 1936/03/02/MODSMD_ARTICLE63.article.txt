# Mae West Still Lush, Lusty At Fox Stanford
## 
### 
Lush and lusty, upheaving and up- j
holstered, Mae West is back again, J
boys. Those who seek double mean- ■
ings may be disappointed in ;
"KLONDIKE ANNIE," now at the !
Fox-Stanford. But others who like i
Mae for what she is won't be.

While "Klondike i
Annie" follows quite [
the basic Westian ;
formula, it's differ- j
ent in that she does j
no one wrong. As,
the Frisco Doll, she !

starts out b?>dly but a missionary I
shows her the light.
Pseudo - sophisticated collegians I
who think it's smart to brand Mae j

professors must be—it's traditional.
A professor can't be ordinary or no
one would pay him any heed. He
must have eccentricities peculiari
ties, or idiosyncrasies to go along
with his individualism.

But withal, we wouldn't have in
dividualism abandoned in the fac
ulty ranks. If reform is needed, it
is needed in the attitude of pro
fessors as to the purpose and actual
results of such teachings.
—John McClelland

West as "low, coarse, and vulgar"
are all wet. She's fine and noble, and
if you don't like her, I don't like
you. —Botsford
