# 'Martha' Ably Done By Lucille Meusel
## 
### 
Von Flotow's lovely opera, "Mar
tha," in English, was ably presented
by the San Carlo Company Satur
day afternoon. The musical direc
tion was satisfactory and the cast
responded well.
Lucille Meusel was good as Mar
tha; her rendition of "The Last Rose
of Summer" drew great applause.
Rolf Gerard as Lionel was the high
spot of the opera. His arias, sung in
rich tenor, were beautifully done.
"Martha" is a tuneful opera, with

a quiet blending of romance and
music. The San Carlo Company
drew a graceful halo around the
opera's history Saturday.
