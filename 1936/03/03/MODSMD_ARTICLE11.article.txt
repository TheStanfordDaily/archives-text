After perching their easels all over j
the campus and peering at archi- j
tectural angles and shadows, seven j
Stanford art students are slated to
win fame and a free Quad in Editor
Don Hanson's sketching contest.
With a .'5OO per cent gain in en- i
rollment in the art department in the j
last (wo years, Hanson felt the new j
"1000" artists ought to be encour- j
aged in their efforts. So he has;
planned to give the best seven char- !
coal sketches submitted prominence j
in the opening view section of the
yearbook. Quads will be given to
the artists.
Sketches already entered are on
display now in the Graphic Arts
Building, and will be judged at the
end of the week by Don Hanson, and
Edward Farmer, head of the art de
partment.
