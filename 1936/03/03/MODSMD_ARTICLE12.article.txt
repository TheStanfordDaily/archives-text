# Quad Opens Post Office Sale Today
## 
### 
Continuing the new yearbook sales
plan, the Quad today begins the
second of its "First of the Month"
sales with the usual desk at the
post office. Staff members will be
there from 8 to 12:10 o'clock today,
tomorrow, and Thursday for the
convenience of those who have not
yet ordered their copy of the book.
The Quad canvass of the Row will
be concluded this week, and the
staff will begin canvassing the Halls.
Second installments on Quads not
fully paid for were due on March 1.
First installment orders will still be
taken, however.
