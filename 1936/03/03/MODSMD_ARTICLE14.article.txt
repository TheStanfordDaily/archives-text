Comptroller of Stanford University

Daily)
The position of the University
with respect to its operating income
is a rather serious one and is likely
to become more difficult. Stanford
has passed through three severe
financial crises during its short life
of approximately 45 years.
The first crisis came in 1893, when
the very existence of the University
was threatened by the institution
of a suit by the United States gov
ernment in the nature of an in
junction to prevent distribution of
(he Stanford estate, end by the con
current Panic of 1893. Great per
sonal sacrifices on the part o( Mrs.
Stanford and on the part of the
faculty of the University enabled it
to continue operations.
Tuition Fees Help
The second crisis occurred in 1920
when the University found itself
faced with the necessity of provid
ing a pension plan for its faculty,
and of increasing its faculty salaries
in cider to maintain some fair re
lation to salaries then being paid by
eastern institutions which had re
cently received very considerable
additions to their endowments.
At lhat time Stanford University
changed a very nominal tuition. The
situation was met by the inaugura
tion of tuition fees which provided
funds for operation equivalent to the
income on an approximately $10,-
000,000 endowment. The new income
from tuition fees saved the day for
Stanford.
"New 500" Saves Day
Again in the spring of 1933 the
University faced another severe
crisis. A decline in enrollment re
sulted in an annual loss in income
from tuition fees in the amount of
$220,000. At the same time the Uni
versity suffered an annual loss in
income in the sum of $120,000 due
to defaults in interest on bonds.
On this occasion the "New 500"
saved the day for Stanford. Not
withstanding the increased tuition
income from additional women, it
was still necessary to make a 10
per cent reduction in the salary of
the faculty and all university em
ployees who received more than
$1000 p:er year and to seriously cur
tail liie University's program.
Must Reinvest Now
The University is now facing a
new crisis in its financial history, as
a result of the general decrease in
interest rates and the necessity of
reinvesting more than half of its in
come-producing endowment within
the next five years. Many bonds
which are now paying 5 to 5V2 per
cent will undoubtedly be called
within this period and refunded on
the basis of to 4'/4 per cent.
If the University is able to aver
age 4 per cent on new investments
which it must make within this pe
riod with the proceeds of called and
maturing bonds, it will be fortunate.
It is estimated that the annual loss
in income due to refunding opera
tions during the current year have
already amounted to $42,000.
Will Reduce Income
It is impossible to estimate ac
curately the probable loss of annual
income which the University must
face from prospective refunding op
erations, but if we assume that cor
porations generally can refinance on
a 4 per cent basis, and if we further
assume that all callable bonds will
be called, the University's annual
income will be reduced in the sum
of $233,000. This indicated shrink
age of income is entirely aside from
any loss which the University might
sustain in its capital account as a
result of serious inflation, if it should
come.
Unfortunately, no new source of
additional income would seem to be
available to meet the situation at
this time. Since the University's fa
cilities are now taxed to capacity,
new income cannot bo developed
through the admission of more stu
dents as was done in 1933. Inas
much as we are already charging
tuition, the very considerable new
income available in 1920' likewise
cannot be resorted to.
Will Avoid Tuition Raise
Tuition at Stanford University is
considerably lower than that charged
by some privately endowed univer
sities of comparable rank in eastern
states, and it has been suggested that
the solution of Stanford's present
financial crisis lies in an increase
in tuition fees. Thus far the Board of
Trustees has not considered this
alternative, and I Ihink it is safe to
say that the attitude of the Trustees
and the Administration would be to
do everything possible to avoid
such an increase.
In the meantime it should be re
membered that although Stanford is
still balancing its budget, it is doing
so on the basis of a 10 per cent cut
in salaries. If Stanford is to main
tain its position in the educational
field the former salary scale must be
restored.
Must Restore Salaries
Stanford faces this predicament:
it must restore its salary schedule
to maintain its position in the edu
cational field; it must also provide
more funds for its increasing pen
sion load; furthermore, it must in
crease its expenditures for plant
maintenance; its heating plant and
much of its classroom lighting is in
great need of modernization; many
needed building repairs can no
longer be deferred.
And all of this must be accomp
lished i t a time when the University
is confronted with the certainty of
a serious decrease in endowment in
come and little prospect that new
sources of income for general pur
poses can be developed.
A hopeful aspect of tlie situation

arises from the possibility that pay
ment of interest may be resumed
within the next two years on sev
eral very large holdings of railroad
bonds which are now in default.
There is also the prospect that addi
tional gifts may be received. Unless
such gifts are unrestricted and
available for maintenance and fac
ulty salaries, they will afford little
relief.
In this connection it is gratifying
to note that the sum of $100,000 has
been received by the University
within the past two years as un
restricted endowment for general
purposes.
Hope for Gifts
It must not be inferred that the
difficulties above enumerated are
peculiar to Stanford. In fact, more
than 250 colleges and universities
cut salaries before Stanford did. A
number of leading universities in
the East have found the solution of
their financial problem in the form
of annual contributions for general
purposes from alumni and friends of
the University.

Even before the depression some
widely known eastern universities
found it necessary to rely upon such
gifts in order to balance their cur
rent budgets. In one instance, these
gifts ran as high as $500,000. Press
dispatches of last week carried the
news that Northwestern had re
ceived a gift of $7,000,000 and Har
vard one of $3,000,000. Stanford
hopes that its friends and alumni
v/i 11 help it meet its latest financial
crisis through gifts for general pur
poses.
