# Chapin Traces Debate History
## Coach Foresees New System Of Interviews between Colleges To Replace Formal Argument 
### 
"When the purpose of debating
has been served, it should die a
natural death," said Leland T.
Chapin, debate coach, in his radio
talk on "Debating in an Age of Con
troversy" last night.

"There is nothing more ridicu
lous to me than unrestrained wrang
ling or formal argument for argu
ment's sake," the speaker affirmed,
in forecasting that a system of
friendly interviews between college
students of different countries will
take the place of debating if and
when .t .should become unnecessary.
Tracing the history of the art from
the unscientific days of Plato and
Aristotle, touching lightly upon the
Chinese system, Mr. Chapin ex
plored the present field of debate—
that of human relations—for which
he said "no adequate laboratory has
yet been constructed. Miscrocopc
and acid test have not been able to
solve t+ie problems of government,"
he added.
