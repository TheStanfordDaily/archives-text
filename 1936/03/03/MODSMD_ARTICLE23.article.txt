# Code Will Be Reviewed By New Panels
## Groups Seek Student, Faculty Opinions of Honor System; Councils Sponsor Discussion 
### Johnson Hill 
Decisions to sponsor two panels
for student and faculty discussion
as the major action in their joint
campaign for evaluation ot the Hon
or Code was announced yesterday
by Men's and Women's Councils
after their meeting in the Ex Com
mittee rooms.
The panels will be held in the first
and second weeks of spring quar
ter, -according to Gib Holloway,
chairman of Men's Council. Attend
ance at the first session will be lim
ited to professors and student execu
tives, who will arrange the second
discussion.
Second Open To Students
The latter will be open to all stu
dents and will feature addresses by
persons who have figured in the
Councils' project.
Simultaneously came the report
that assurance of co-operation in en
forcing the Honor System has been
given by all departments of the Uni
versity except one. This action was
the goal of an effort to place the
Code's principles on a stronger op
erating basis, it was said.
The English Department, which
for years has itself handled viola
tions within its scope, agreed to re
port with recommendation of pen
alty to Men's and Women's Coun
cils all cases where students are
suspected of academic misdemeanor.
All department heads were asked
to codify the system's regulations
for their own use and convenience.
Co-operation Promised
No blanket, specific arrangement
of the Honor Code will be published
for general application. Officials
believe that with such a statement
in circulation, over-critical persons
would deliberately seek loopholes
for disregarding the rules.
The inquiry was begun two weeks
ago at the request of Pat Flavel,
Women's Council chairman. Mem
bers of the two groups have been
sounding out student and faculty
opinion to bring out weak phases
in the system's operation, and to
clarify it so that deported violations
can be satisfactorily dealt with.
Holloway and Flavel asserted
that with the specific, academic as
pects of the Honor Code clearly in
view, students will get a better un
derstanding of the "fundamental
standards" which underlie its prin
ciples iii governing conduct in gen
eral.
