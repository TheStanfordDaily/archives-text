### Gray Creveling 
PEARSON AND ALLEN'S Wash
ington Merry-Go-Round column
was devoted yesterday to the Presi
dent's correspondence.
Largely from people who cannot
even spell, the following is a typ
ical example of one of the letters
written in a lopsided scrawl: "I
never saw a President I would write
to until you've got in your place.
But I have always felt like you and
your wife and your children were
just as common as we are."
MK. ROOSEVELT gets 3,000 of
that kind a day, and a special staff
handles the heavy stream of letters.
They are all delivered—all those in
long-hand—to a barn-like place on
Constitution Avenue where 50 clerks
make it their business to answer
each note. The Correspondence Di
vision of WPA is the official title
of the s'aff.
A special collection of humorous
letters are kept to show the Presi
dent. Excerpts: "We are living with
my sister's husband that died last
March."
"1 am a licensed portable engi
neer and a fairly good mechanic
thrown in."
"I was a former vaudeville con
tortionist, and have been out of work
a year now, and I hardly know which
way to turn."
"Every time it rains my house
leaks full speed."
THERE ARE STOCK answers to
most letters asking for relief. The
commonest reply is, "See your local
relief administrator."
But obviously there is no stock
answer to ones like these.
"I am the father of 16 children
and am and have been on relief for
some time. Will you kindly send me
all available information on birth
control."
"I must get my skin out of other
people's eyesight," a Negro wrote
expressing in his own way that he
needed clothes.
"I have tryed all I could possibly
do—first God and then you, and you
are the only one that I trust that
can help me."
MRS. ROOSEVELT likes to see
those letters reflecting unusual need
or praiseworthy struggle, and some
of those sent to her in that category
read like this:
"I have nothing to eat and no
table to eat it off of."
"It is a simple thing to die, but a
fearful thing to live."
"We have 15 chickens and a little
cow helping us."
"My children are also sticking out
of their shoes."
"1 believe I owe five months rent,
but I will know for sure when the
landlord calls."
LETTERS LIKE THESE turn up
every day.
"Dear Honored Mr. Roosevelt,
dear sir, I take pleasure in hands to
drop you a few lines of very im
portance."
"I am very green on writing a
letter to a President."
'Is there any alphabeticaly ar
rangement that I can get some aid
from."*
"In the name of the Lord or the
Democratic Party send the money.
I am 12. I am small to my age, but
my mother is dead so I am the old
est Will you please send about
two thousand dollars and dont send
a chock, send it in money allready
coined out."
SOME ARE BASHFUL. For ex
ample: "The reason I have delayed
writing is that I consider you the
most busy man of all the Presidents
we have had, and have did more for
the massasses of the people."
The mail received by the Presi
dent is dominantly from poor
people. It also Ls greater in volume
than that of any of his predeces
sors.
Notice how every time the word
PRESIDENT" is used in the let
ter:;, it is invariably capitalized.

PEARSON AND ALLEN'S Wash
ington Merry-Go-Round column
was devoted yesterday to the Presi
dent's correspondence.
Largely from people who cannot
even spell, the following is a typ
ical example of one of the letters
written in a lopsided scrawl: "I
never saw a President I would write
to until you've got in your place.
But I have always felt like you and
your wife and your children were
just as common as we are."
MK. ROOSEVELT gets 3,000 of
that kind a day, and a special staff
handles the heavy stream of letters.
They are all delivered—all those in
long-hand—to a barn-like place on
Constitution Avenue where 50 clerks
make it their business to answer
each note. The Correspondence Di
vision of WPA is the official title
of the s'aff.
A special collection of humorous
letters are kept to show the Presi
dent. Excerpts: "We are living with
my sister's husband that died last
March."
"1 am a licensed portable engi
neer and a fairly good mechanic
thrown in."
"I was a former vaudeville con
tortionist, and have been out of work
a year now, and I hardly know which
way to turn."
"Every time it rains my house
leaks full speed."
THERE ARE STOCK answers to
most letters asking for relief. The
commonest reply is, "See your local
relief administrator."
But obviously there is no stock
answer to ones like these.
"I am the father of 16 children
and am and have been on relief for
some time. Will you kindly send me
all available information on birth
control."
"I must get my skin out of other
people's eyesight," a Negro wrote
expressing in his own way that he
needed clothes.
"I have tryed all I could possibly
do—first God and then you, and you
are the only one that I trust that
can help me."
MRS. ROOSEVELT likes to see
those letters reflecting unusual need
or praiseworthy struggle, and some
of those sent to her in that category
read like this:
"I have nothing to eat and no
table to eat it off of."
"It is a simple thing to die, but a
fearful thing to live."
"We have 15 chickens and a little
cow helping us."
"My children are also sticking out
of their shoes."
