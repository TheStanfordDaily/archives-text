# Nine Traffic Violators Fined by Council
## 
### 
Men's Council yesterday fined
seven speeders and two overtime
parkers, a new record in numbers
during its regular meeting yester
day.
Other business taken up was a
warning to two men students for
passing checks which "bounced" to
the Stanford Union. Had the action
been intentional, the students would
have been expelled, the council im
ported.
