# Soil Conservation Bill Is New AAA — Dr. Grant
## Danger of Unconstitutionality Is Eliminated Through Use Of Government's General Fund 
### 
The Administration's new "soil j
conservation" bill which became
law with President Roosevelt's sig
nature Sunday is essentially another J
AAA, Dr. James A. C. Grant, assist
ant professor of political science,
told The Daily yesterday.
"The difference between the new
bill and AAA," Dr. Grant explained,
"is the method of financing. The j
AAA was financed by processing
taxes, which were declared illegal
by the Supreme Court. The new
program is financed from the gov
ernment's general fund.
"Processors could object and sue
the government. But states and tax
payers, the court has ruled in the
past, cannot sue the federal govern j
ment for misuse of general funds. !
Unless the court reverses this rul- i

| ing, the new farm program is there- '
i fore rafe from an unfavorable court
decision."
j Through the Secretary of Agricul
] ture and state agencies, farmers will *
i be paid certain amounts for not -
growing anything on marginal land,
i or for growing only soil-benefiting ]
| crops, like clover, instead of cotton, |
wheat, and other products.
"Though it is ostensibly a 'soil
j conservation' program, I can't see j
| any difference in effect from the pre- j
j vious 'crop reduction' AAA," con- },
i eluded Dr. Grant. "The same end j
j will be reached without danger of
the law being declared unconstitu
j tional by the Supreme Court."
