The Sequoia boys played the old.
old slory of the strawberry roan
last night, with scenery and sound
effects.
All in all it was a big night, with
a wagon put in the first lloor of
fice (through the transom, may
be) a tractor run up the front
steps, and a horse led up the
stairs to the second floor.
That's the end of the first act.
Next comes George Burns, the
dctccattiff, and Fred Frehc, who
put on a horsey petting party. But
best of all was when the sheriff
put his arm of the law where it
did the most good, and pushed
the thing right down stairs and
out into the yard.
'"It's charm that did it," he said.
The horse walked home.
