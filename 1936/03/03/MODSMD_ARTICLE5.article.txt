tion's views, Interfraternity Council
and Interfraternity Board's special
rushing committee will attempt
rushing rules revision at tonight's
meeting.
Two plans were sent to the 24
houses for vote last night. The fra
ternities' preferences will be dis
cussed tonight and a final plan prob
ably drafted. After passage by the
council, the revised rushing rules
must pass Interfraternity Board, the
houses themselves, and final ap
proval by the Administration.
First of the suggest plans is es
sentially the same as the one used
this year. A change might be made,
however, to prohibit any formal
rushing autumn quarter. Pledging
would climax an intensive three
weeks rushing pei'iod in January.
Off-campus contacts would be al
lowed only during vacations.
Complete campus freedom is of
fered Row men and rushees under
the second plan, fundamentally the
same as one suggested by Dr. Wil
bur. Contacts would be unrestricted
all year and pledging would be de
layed until the first week of spring
quarter. This plan would prohibit
all off-campus rushing and require a
C average before initiation.
