WHY IIIE CARDS
LOST 'I HE RELAY

Last Thursday at S.F.'s second In
door Meet the California relay team
beat the Stanford team.
It wasn't a very startling victory,
except for the fact that it was the
second time a Bear relay team had
beaten a Card team for 20 years.
The first time in 20 years was two
weeks before, at the first Indoor
Meet.
A very interesting saga is told of
that relay race Thursday night.
For ihe fourth and last leg of the
race Cal's Jim Helmer took the baton
and beat Stanford's Jim Kneubuhl
to the first turn. Kneubuhl promptly
passed Helmer, and stayed ahead.
Auditorium officials, however,
pulled a horrible butch. Instead of
shooting the gun off, with one lap to
go, which is the traditional sign of
the last lap in any race, the offi
cials held up a big card with the
number "2" on it, signifying that
there were two more laps to go.
So Kneubuhl contented himself
with keeping ahead of the Bear.
Helmer, however, sensed a mistake,
and looked sharp as he rounded the
turn into the stretch. Seeing a tape
stretched there waiting for the fin
ish, he lengthened his stride a bit
and eased past the coasting Kneu
buhl, who was just making ready
for his "gather" for a last lap sprint.
It was a boner comparable to
those pulled in the Olympic Games:
where the officials made the steeple
chase men run an extra lap, and
where the discus officials were so
busy watching the girls' hurdles
that they failed to see a winning
throw made by a very indignant
Frenchman.
ALREADY results are coming in
from the sportatorial published in
this column last Thursday advocat
ing volley ball as an intramural
sport.
Sunday Phi Delts and Dee Gees
had a little intramural volley ball

gams of their own; the anchor girls
were ahead at half-time, accord
ing to Our Hasher's report. Also
Alpha Delts are considering a court
in the schoolyard next door, Sigma
Chis may rtVHinp their badminton
court for the new craze, Encina
may put one up in the lobby, and
the Zetes figure there is plenty ol
room for a court in the lot be
tween their house and the Row buck
alley. â€”Breed
