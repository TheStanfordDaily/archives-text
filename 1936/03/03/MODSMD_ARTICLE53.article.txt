## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism Need for Rushing Compromise May Be Shown When Row Meets Administration 
### 
Dr. Wilbur and Interfraternity Council
will meet in joint session tonight for the ad
vertised purpose of ell'ecting an agreement be
tween now conflicting Administration and
fraternity ideas of an ideal rushing system.
As a result of that meeting, the houses, act
ing through Interfraternity Hoard, must ei
ther evolve a set of new constructive rushing
i tiles, or forget about the whole idea and con
tinue under the hectic and haphazard control
llie present crop of altogether inadequate
regulations affords.
Tonight's meeting has all the prerequisites
ol success. II will be the first time —since the
recent mid-winter blow-up forced the issue—
that the Council, Board, and Dr. Wilbur have
met to hear, first hand, each other's angles on
llie problem, to hear what the other is pro
posing, and why.
As each side prepares its offense and de
fense, il is clear that the principals—the fra
ternities and the Administration—are still
agreed on two points: that rushing should be
entirely on-campus, and should entail fewer
petty restrictions.
Neither of the plans submitted at last
week's Council meeting has a chance in a
million, in ils present form, of getting through
both the houses and Dr. Wilbur.
However, there is still room for a compro
mise.
That compromise might be a rushing plan
where contact would be completely unre
stricted—with two exceptions: that it be en
tirely on-campus, and that frosh not be al

lowed in houses or Row-men in Eneinu ex
cept on two specified days each week (pos
sibly one week day and one week-end day,
to he detenniend by Intel fraternity Council).
Pledging would be in winter quarter as it was
this year.
These simple rules could he enforced —not
by a proctor system, but by gentlemen's
agreements among the houses. The last-min
ute stress would not be as nerve-racking as it
now is, since the fraternities for four and a
half months could invite freshmen up to
dinner two days a week, and could normally
contact their rushees any place else on the
campus during the other live days; hence
they could line up their classes even more
satisfactorily than they now do under the
rushing-date system.
This proposal, or a plan resembling it, prob
ably would pass Dr. Wilbur—if the houses
can <jel totjclher. Every reasonable delegate
to tonight's meeting understands that a com
promise is the rushing system's only salva
tion. If the fraternities choose to be too bull
headed, of course, they will have to struggle
through another cumbersome year with the
present unwieldy rushing system.
Perhaps when dirty linen involving If) or
20 of the houses, instead of just one as was
the case this year, is aired, the houses will
finally agree that their rushing set-up has a
bad odor. If they forestall this eventual dis
aster tonight by coming to their senses and
effecting the necessary compromise, so much
the better.
