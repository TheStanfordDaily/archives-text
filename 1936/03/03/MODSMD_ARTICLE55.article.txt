When Girls Study
(From the University <>f Washington Daily)
Nobody knows who started the first sorority study
table.
Whoever the inventor was, she has earned the title
of the world's greatest optimist—she evidently believed
it possible to gather ten to twenty co-eds around a
table and still maintain a silent, scholarly atmosphere.
+ * * *
What a blow it would be to the good woman if she
could see the study table of today—an ordinary dining
table surrounded by a harried-looking upperclass
woman arid irreverent pledges, who seem to have for
gotten the purpose of study table is to aid in acquiring
knowledge.

The casual observer might glance at a study table
and think its charges a model of concentration—unless
he knew that most of those upright notebooks con
cealed the latest Reader's Digest or Good Housekeep
ing—or unless he knew ihat most of those busily scrib
bling pencils are telling what a perfect date Roland is
except that he talks about his economics prof all the
time—or unless he knew that those lowered heads are
bowed, not in contemplation of the symptoms of para
noia, but in sweet dreamless sleep.
Many and ingenious are the frosh student's methods
of whiling away the hours between 7:30 and 10 p.m.
Developing a recurrent thirst for a drink of water from
the kitchen, opening and closing the windows, and
creating weird-looking lips with a pledge sister's
lipstick arc standard timc/-passers. Some of the moiv
ingenious of frosh stealthily fill their neighbor's purse
with water or shoot paper wads, inaccurately, at the
upperclasswoman.
* * * *
The fifteen minute recess at 9 p.m. signals a rush
to the smoking-room where the scholars stage an im
promptu cigaret-consuming tournament. The winner
returns at 9:15 pale, but triumphant.
The sorority study table may not lead to more
A's, but no one can deny it binds the pledge class into
a more closely knit unit.
Because of the study table's obvious social value,
it would be a shame to see it go.
