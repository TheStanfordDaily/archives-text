# The 						Date Bureau

### 
(From the University Daily Kansan)
The mere mention of the name Date Bureau is
greeted with smiles, laughs, slurring remarks, and is
the object of much joking and raillery. But when one
sets aside the humorous aspect, he can see that there
is really a need for such an institution on a campus
harboring over 4000 men and women students. The
small minority of students in the organized houses
have their social life laid out for them. Open house,
parties, and older friends on the campus soon make
them feel acquainted and welcome.
The majority of men and women students on the
campus come to the University as total strangers.
The only way they have of meeting people of the
opposite sex is in the classroom, and that is generally
limited to the persons sitting nearby. What good is
one's education if he has no one with whom to enjoy
it? The student receives as much education from
contacts with people whom he becomes acquainted
with during his college years as he does from his
books. A date bureau, sponsored by the University
and accepted by students as a matter of course, would
do much to widen student acquaintanceships.
