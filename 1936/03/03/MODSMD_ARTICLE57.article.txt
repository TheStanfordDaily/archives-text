Despite the spring thaw, the boxing team found
that up in Washington State there is really the frozen
north. While people roll in the aisles at Stanford, the
boxers say they roll in the sidewalks at 12 o'clock at
Washington.
Social regulations are distinctly anti-social. On
week days, the college Avomen have to be in by 9:30,
and on week-ends by 12. Not only that, but men are
not allowed in sorority houses.
This did not bother the pugs, however. They de
cided it was their turn to ask, "Are we men or are
we mice," with the result that there were some
narrow squeaks.
On the pretense that the local chapter of Pi Beta
Phi was sending a message of cheer, the men walked
into the Washington Pi Phi house. They happened to
arrive during lunch time. Since nobody answered the
bell, they walked in, just as if they were raised in
Encina, or a barn, or something.
Now the gals didn't know exactly what to think.
And the boxers didn't exactly know what to do. No
body came to greet them. A certain Phi Psi boxer
got rather nervous standing around, and started to
shadow-box in front of a mirror. He didn't realize,
however, that the mirror reflected directly into the
dining room.
There is a Sigma Chi who does a bit of basketball
managing these days. He has a reputation of being
loquacious. The Sigma Chis tried to get at the cause
of the trouble and provided him with a muzzle last
Christmas. This only seemed to have a momentary
effect, so the basketball team on one of its trips
tried to approach the problem from a different angle.
Since there seemed to be no hope of the success of
such a preventative as a muzzle, the team banded
together and tried a preventative. They presented
him with a bright, shiny, new shovel.
