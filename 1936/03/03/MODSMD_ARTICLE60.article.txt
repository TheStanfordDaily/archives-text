## MONEY MAKES THE FARMER GO 
### 
This business of making Stanford
students thjnk isn't a job, it's an
impossibility. Ask Bill Millis, who
gives free copies of his liberal maga
zine, Student Opinion, in an en-
I deavor to point out the fact that
the Farm is not an isolated isle in
; the swirl of human tides.
Ask Dick Strouse and Bill Rog
ers, who struggled before him to put

over the magazine
"News'," good
enough to stand
on its own feet
on almost any
campus but this
one.
Ask Wal 1 y
Brooke, who told
us that he is eo-

j ing nuts trying to get some spirit
in a new-fangled rugby deal.
Ask this Bull Sessioner, who had
| his faith in collegiate brain-power
! broken by the success of Susan and
| the failure of his serious offerings.

Campus newshawks, given to
drooling over copies of ihe Daily
j Californian, still packed with hot
| news c.bout hot issues, wonder
I vainly what they can do about
mental mummification on the Farm.
Almost unthinkingly, when Daily
1 editors ;.re forced to an editorial on
an off-campus issue, they start with
| the fact that while this or that is
happening, the Far mis going its own
sweet way, doing, may we add, its
i own nweet things, things so sweet
j that they are as sickening as an
over-dose of simple syrup.

The truth of the matter is, of
j course, painfully apparent—simply
! that you can't make a thinker out of
! someone with $100 per month. Di
vide papa's $300 first-of-the-quarter
check by the three months in the
| average quarter, and that's the an
swer.
I It is the answer, too, why students
I can't get themselves into an intel
! lectual lather over campus politics
j any more than they can over the
fall of the AAA and the rise of
i Townsend.

I For Stanfordites are people who

1 can afford the luxuries. And
thoughts are not luxuries to the be
doughed individual. Their utility
seems strictly relative to the amount 1
of money in the checking account, j
To the man with the greased wallet, j
| luxuries are the thoughtless eve- j
| nings on town dance floors ruining
feet and digestion or pleasant bore- I
; dom among the gallery goons of \
Palo Alto,
The man who counts his nickels j
often turns to thinking as his chief j
iimusement and not the movies or i
the dance floor, because he has to. j
! Stanford students neither have to I
i count, nor do they have to think to !
j have a good time.

Money makes many things go
other than the proverbial mare. Un
fortunately, it often makes the brain
stop.
