# Row To Confer On Rushing
## Two Plans for Rules Revision Voted on Yesterday; Result May Be Basis for Change 
### 
President Wilbur will confer to- i
night with members of Interfra- j
ternity Council and the Interfra- j
ternity Board's rushing committee,
in an effort to make satisfactory re
vision of the University's rushing
rules. The meeting was postponed
from Monday.
Houses To Report
The session will feature a report ]
of the 24 fraternities voting yester- I
day on the proposals advanced at a j
previous meeting. Revision of the j
rushing system, it was reported, |
probably will be based on the choices !
indicated by the various organiza- j
tions.
First of the two plans up for vote j
yesterday follows materially the
lines of the present regulations.
Terms of the proposal provide that
actual rushing would be done dur
ing a three-weeks period in Janu
ary, and that no off-campus rushing j
would be permitted except during |
vacation periods.
C Average Proposed
The second plan offers freedom of I
contact at any time between Row j
interests and rushees, and sets the !
date of pledging at the end of the j
first week of spring quarter. No
off-campus rushing would be al- j
lowed, and each have 1
to have a scholastic Average of C be- j
fore initiation.
The proposal which is adopted by
the council must pass Interfrater
nity Board, the Row organizations
themselves, and administrative ap
proval before it can be put into
operation.
