# Watch Yourself Talk On Electrical Lab Machines
## 
### David Leff 
Have you ever seen yourself talk?
Well, you can, up in the electrical
commas.ications lab.
You talk into an instrument that
looks like a portable typewriter.
Students up there call it an oscillo
graph but you don't have to. You
just talk, or shout, or whisper into
it.
It's hooked up with lots of dials
and across the front there's a
ground-glass screen. Across this a
little green dot shoots back and
forth when sounds are made, waving
.so fast that it looks just like a green
line. ,
Watch It Jump
One of the fellows said "Stanford
University" and you should have
seen the dot jump. And maybe the
Republicans would like to know that
a New Dealer spieling over the ra
dio made the line scramble up like
a ball of green yarn.
"I Feel Like a Feather in a Breeze"
registered just like a feather in a

breeze. A symetrical wavy undula
tion was the electrical wizards way
of describing it. The machine
couldn't take Cab Calloway's hi-de
hoes. The line jumped clear ofT the
screen.
Students Build 'Em
Here in this lab, using equipment
which Associate Professor F. E. Ter
man says is as complete as any col
lege radio equipment in the country,
electrical engineering students are
building machines which demon
strate not only the awesome abili
ties of modern science, but the skill
of the modern scientific student.
The students themselves built this
remarkable oscillograph, and are
now planning some kind of a phone
transmitter with which they can
talk to amateur stations in the east
ern states. When their station,
K6YZ, iÂ« finished, anybody with an
all-wave radio will be able to listen
ii on two-way conversations be
tween Stanford radiosters and
"hams" way back east.
