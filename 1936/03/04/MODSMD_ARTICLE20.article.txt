# League Sends Peace Plea To Italy, Ethiopia
## Peace Move Is French Idea; British Circles Pessimistic; Sanctions To Be Continued 
### 
GENEVA, March 3 t/P). â€” The
League of Nations appealed to Italy
and Ethiopia today to make peace,
but optimism was noticeably absent
among officials. One week was given
for a reply.
Some members of the "committee
of 13," including all members of the
council save the belligerents them
selves, found hope in the fact that
Premier Mussolini has not yet offi
cially and finally rejected the peace
project.
Peace Move French
In British circles pessimism was
pronounced. It was repeatedly em
phasized that the peace move was a
French idea and that sanctions
would continue as usual until peace
is actually concluded.
Moreover, the sanctions commit
tee of 18 will meet tomorrow to in
struct its technical committee to
proceed to draw up a detailed plan
for enforcement of an oil embargo,
so as to have it ready if the peace
move fi-ils.
In other words, the deck is to re
main cleared for action and guns
loaded.
Sanctions Possible
If Italy and Ethiopia refuse the
overture for peace, the sanctions
committee of 13 will meet March 11
to vote on an oil embargo and pos
sibly other sanctions, such as clos
ing port of League members to
Italian ships.
The text of the appeal follows:
"The Committee of 13, acting un
der the mandate which the council
entrusted to it by its resolution of
December 19, addresses a pressing
appeal to the two belligerents toward
the immediate opening of negotia
tions within the framework of the
League of Nations and the spirit of
the covenant with a view to the
prompt cessation of hostilities and
the definite re-establishment of
peace.
"The Committee of 13 will meet
March 10 to take note of the replies
of the two governments."
