I WASHINGTON, March 3 (TP). —
| A tux revision program which stun
j ned Congress by its hreadth was
proposed by President Roosevelt
■ today as a means of raising reve
nue for the farm program and the
j bonus.
In a special message, which was
greeted coolly by some Democrats
j and condemned from within Re- j
publican ranks, Roosevelt asked re
peal of the present corporate tax
i system, which brings in almost a
thousand million dollars a year, and
I urged substitution of a drastic tax
on undisturbed corporation profits.
This levy, designed to force thou
sands into distribution among stock
holders, was estimated to yield, |
! roughly 1600 million dollars.
Treasury experts said the new'
proposal would not only cover the
taxes the President asked Congress
I to repeal, but would raise $620,000.-
000 a year additional for the farm
program and the bonus.
This was the only permanent lax ,
j proposed. I
