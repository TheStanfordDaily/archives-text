# No Jap-Russo War, Say Treat
## Professor Sees Settled Future For Japan, China; Advises U.S. Recognize Manchoukuo 
### 
There will be no war between Ja
pan and Soviet Russia, Dr. Payson
J. Treat told a Tuesday evening
lecture audience last night in the
Assembly Hall.
"I do not anticipate Japanese con
quest of any part of China," Dr.
Treat said, "nor the overthrow of
the Japanese government by its own
people. Until China, Russia, and
Japan learn to conduct themselves
as "friendly neighbors," however,
petty incidents will recur and ani
mositities increase, Dr. Treat point
ed out.
Need Recognition
Drawing attention to the rich field
for American investments in the
rising state of Manchukuo, only fully
available with American diplomatic
recognition, Dr. Treat prophesied a
repudiation in the near future of
the Stimson doctrine, applying to
that state.
Not desirous of making it depend
ent on Japan, Dr. Treat said, Japa
nase specialists in Manchukuo in
tend to set up a strong independent
state where Chinese, Mongols, Kor
eans, Manchus and Japanese can
live in equality. That she is ac
complishing this is illustrated in the
tremendous industrial progress
throughout Manchukuo, where cities
are being built, railroads and high
ways put through, and banditry and
lawlessness greatly minimized.
Chinese General Powerful
What would happen to National
ist China should misadventure be
fall Chiang Kai Shelc was a ques
tion Dr. Treat did not answer. In
control of the treasury and of the
military forces, that general, he
states, IS the government.
Japan, in contrast to the United
States with her millions of unem
ployed, Dr. Treat said, is a nation at
work. If the nations create trade
barriers to prevent Japanese com
merce and access to raw materials,
they will face the renewed problem
of Japanese emigration.
