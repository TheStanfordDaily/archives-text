# Physician Revives Human Hearts For Laboratory Study
## 
### 
DETROIT, Mich., March 3 (/}>).â€”
Human hearts which have stopped
beating can now be brought back to
life for study in the laboratory.
Dr. William B. Kountz of St.
Louis Mo., described to the Amer
ican College of Physicians today how
he had restored the hearts of (J3 per
sons to approximately normal life
and kept them beating in order to
study their action as affected by va
rious diseases and drugs.
Dr. Kountz did not explain his
method of keeping the hearts alive
but physicians attending the annual
meeting of the society declared that
it was probably an adaptation of the
apparatus developed by Dr. Alexis
Carrell of New York and Colonel
Charles A. Lindbergh to keep many
human tissues alive.
