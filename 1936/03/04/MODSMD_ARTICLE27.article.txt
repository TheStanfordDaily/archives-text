Should Stanford take a definite
stand on national affairs?
Ex Committee faccd that question
in last night's session. Result may
1 be a student panel foi diseussion of
the NYA and Nye-Kvale Bill.
A subcommittee was named to de
cide Ex Committee policy on facing
; national issues, and whether or tot
j student interest was high enough to
! make a vote or panel advisable.
"U.C.L.A. thinks — why shouldn't
we?" queried President Wally
Brooke, and cited the record vote
against compulsory R.O.T.C. as
proof.
Such discussions are the major
student activity in the East, he said.
"They think we're crazy to try to
control finances." Creamer, Hansen,
Brown, Grover, Grayson, and An
| derson will thresh out the matter.
PUBL I C A T lONS COUNCIL
naming Dick Creamer as secretary,
j providing for a new cabinet for the
| Daily, and allowing Chaparral to
i purchase two new typewriters, were
approved.
A BY-LAW CHANGE eliminating
J the Quad building fund and conse
quent red tape was tabled. "Can't
pass it tonight," said Brooke. "Have
■ n't a three-fourth majority."
"Let's phone Mrs. Grayson and
I tell her we need a by-law passed,"
j advised Bob Gros.
DATES GRANTED included Al
pha Phi, April 17; Junior Carnival,
1 April 24; Beta, May 15; and Toyon,
May 15.
CARDINAL MINUTES, provid
ing that three absences would force
a member to resign, were accepted.
"Ought to start that on Ex Com
j mittee," said Gros.
CONVALESCENT HOME DRIVE
J committee heads were approved.
; A POST-U.S.C. GAME dance
was suggested and referred to Cardi
nals for final decision.
STANFORD QUESTIONNAIRES
with alumni inquiries and Presi
i dent Wilbur's answers were passed
out for perusal.
SPEAKERS' BUREAU, with bud
get of $25, is actually accomplishing
things, reported Brooke. Talks rang
ing from volcanoes to Communism
are now available.
EX COMMITTEE REVISION has
retired to revise itself, reported
Dick Creamer. It will emerge soon
in perfected form.
A I ox of candy and two telegrams
were borne in by a Postal Telegraph
messenger for Mr. Erooke. "Why
not open 'em?" invited Creamer,
after an expectant pause.
"What I'm interested in is the
candy,' observed Gros, contcmplat
ingly.
"The first one says, 'How could
you—you have wrenched my
heart,' reported Brooke dubiously.
"Wally, dear, if only the beauty of
our friendship could have remained
| unspoiled," lamented the second.
"I tnove that Ex Committee go on
j record as extending condolences,"
i suggested Gros. The meeting ad
j journed in confusion, with mutters
of "I didn't send it."
