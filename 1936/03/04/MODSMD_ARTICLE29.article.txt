WHEN ROBINSON made the Ad- 1
ministration's reply to A1 Smith's j
late tirade against the New Deal,
Smilh was on a train bound for Palm
Beach to be the guest Q f such men \
as Myron Taylor, U.S. Steel's presi
dent, other big lawyers and sports- '
men.
A1 has been given a terrific whirl
and giddy days with the Liberty |
Leaguers and more stuffed shirts
have made him so popular that he
is their leading choice for the next j
president of the U.S. (but notice not
of the U.S. Steel, they wouldn't trust !
him with that job). Score of a straw- I
poll taken at an exclusive Palm
Beach society carnival: Smith 705, j
Lalldon 090, Roosevelt 0.

UNEXPLAINABLE IS the fact
(hat the Union Cellar did $89,000
worth of business last year (can j
you imagine that!) but (more un- j
imaginable) the Cellar LOST $1500 j
doing it.
To think that Stanford students
have to pay that monopolistic mon- j
ster — the Union—three dollars a j
year is galling enough, but when [
the Cellar loses money—Oh, God Al- I
mighty . . . what's the use?
A HOT DOG stand across the \
street from the Cellar could make |
money. It is difficult to see how \
anyone with a monopoly in any way j
comparable to that of the Cellar
could help but make money.
Why should we have to pay i
three dollars to make the opera- j
tion of a clumsy corporation pos
sible, when anyone else could
make barrels of money and prob
ably still be able to give the stu
dents a better price for food?
"The hashers are well paid," is ;
one of the excuses made for the i
Cellar's losses. But if the hashers
are that well paid, they ought to re- (
tire after a year's work and drive
Pierce Arrows ever after. But the
hashers do not. Let's have another
excuse. "Next?"

LET'S TURN our Union Dollar!
over to the University, or to the
students, or to the Convalescent
Home, or to . . . hell, any outfit, '
except the Union.
Every campus journalist's ambi
tion since time immemorable has |
been to "expose" the Union some- j
day before he leaves school, prefer
ably when he has his diploma
in hand. But there seems to be j
nothing to expose. It's all as plain I
as day.
Co-eds at the University of Wash- ;
ington have been proved to be less j
radical than men. '
