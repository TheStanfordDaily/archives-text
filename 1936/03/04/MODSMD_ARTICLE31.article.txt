# Farm Traffic System Contains Traffic Hazards Similar To Those of Town and Cities
## Gordy Davis Anxious To Cut Student's Accident Tolls, Presents Daily with Facts 
### Jim Hurst 
Responding to a nation-wide call,
"Cut traffic deaths and injuries,"
Stanford car operators have joined
the cause of careful driving. Only
by a united campaign for safety on
the highways can America's huge |
annual toll of traffic injuries and
fatalities be reduced.
Stanford streets and avenues hold
as many traffic dangers as the aver
age city, perhaps more. Campus of
ficer Gordy Davis, anxious to cut
accidents, yesterday presented The j
Daily with the facts.
In an adjoining quotation he j
points out the particular traffic dan- j

! gers along Lasuen from the Row to
j the English corner. All the injuries
| on the campus this school year ex
cept one have occurred in this sector,
Davis said.

j vealed.
Although Galvez Street in front
| of the B.A.C. is marked a 20-mile
| zone, and is obviously dangerous be
j cause of the necessity of backing into
the street from parking places, many
j drivers barrel through at a high
\ rate of speed, records show.
Considerable doubt prevails as to
| right of way of cars turning left
I from Palm Drive into the El Ca
mino Real.
After making this turn, the driver
faces a red light, and still has a lane ;
of traffic to cross. The law is that
the Palm Drive ti'affic lane has the
right of way, the car making the i
left turn being required to stop. If j
i there is no car within 200 feet com- ,
ing along Palm Drive, the car may
then go through, in the opinion of
Gordy Davis.
Visibility Blamed
The largest number of serious and j
fatal accidents on the campus have !
occurred between cars and sta- i
tionary objects, such as trees and !
telephone poles. This is due partly j
to the poor visibility, and partly to j

the fact that the drivers do not i
watch their speedometers and fail
to realize how fast they are going.
Though no one spot can claim the
majority of the serious accidents on >
the campus in past years, there be- '
ing seemingly a number of places j
uniformly dangerous, nearly all of
the fatalities have occurred some
where along Palm Drive. This seems
to be the place where high speed is
rampant. Especially bad has been 1
the point where Palm Drive inter
sects the circle from Lasuen and j
Lomita. | 1

The largest number of serious and j
fatal accidents on the campus have !
occurred between cars and sta- i
tionary objects, such as trees and !
telephone poles. This is due partly j
to the poor visibility, and partly to j

the fact that the drivers do not i
watch their speedometers and fail
to realize how fast they are going.
Though no one spot can claim the
majority of the serious accidents on >
the campus in past years, there be- '
ing seemingly a number of places j
uniformly dangerous, nearly all of
