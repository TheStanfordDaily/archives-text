"I'd like to emphasize par
ticularly the danger along the
Row and all the way down
Lasuen, past the Post Office to
the English corner. There's a
great deal of pedestrian traf
fic along there, and drivers
seem to forget that the pedes
trian at all times has the right
of way.
'"Many of the fellows and
girls think they can drive with
their horns and accelerators,
never using the brakes. And
at night lots of them drive just
as fast as in the day time. With
these black streets, particularly
in rainy weather, they should
cut down their speed at least 25
per cent at night.
