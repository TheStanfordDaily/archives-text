# Football 'Gate' Is Biggest B.A.C. Money-Maker
## Pigskin Profits Make Up 85 Per Cent of Receipts; Funds Used for P.E., Branner Hall 
### 
Football provided 85 per cent of I
the funds required to support Stan
ford athletic and physical educa- i
tion activities during the 1934-35 j
fiscal year, recent B.A.C. figures re
veal.
Over 345,000 football dollars rolled j
into the B.A.C. for the 1034 season,
while less than $10,000 was grossed
by six other sports. Gate receipts |
totaled $5,269 from track, $3,355 j
from basketball, $522 from boxing, j
$341 from baseball, $139 from swim- |
ming, and $15.7G from tennis.
ToUtl B.A.C. receipts were $408,- j
586, over $21,000 more than total !
expenditures. Besides $100,000 inter- !
collegiate sports expense, B.A.C.
funds pay for building and grounds
maintenance, the School of Physical
Education, and regular annual pay
ments on Branner Hall.
Excess funds last year made pos
sible two $25,000 Branner Hall pay
ments for this and next year. An- j
gell Field reconstruction will run
1935-36 expenses above last year's, !
but increased basketball and foot- \
ball receipts will probably offset the
additional expenditures, officials
said.
