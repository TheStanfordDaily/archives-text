# Top Score Hoopsters Play in Indian-Troy Game Saturday Night
## Teammates 'Mask' Luisetti To Help Ward Off Stanford's Overzealous Kissing Co-eds 
### Roger Kimball 
Rounding into top form for Satur
day night's play-oif game with
U.S.C., Indian hoopsters gave a
present lo Hank Luisetti, listened to
a chalk talk by Coach John Bunn,
and went through u drill on attack
yesterday.
Hank's present was a baseball
umpire's mask, which the team
gave him through Captain Dinty
Moore. In a short talk, Moore ad
vised Luisetti to protect himself
from overzealous female rooters in
the future by donning the mask im
mediately after each game. It seems
that Angelo was the embarrassed
victim ol' one such admirer's kiss
just after Stanford's victory over
the Bears.
"Moore Must Feel Good"
As the star forward accepted the
gift with a grin and a remark that
"Moore must feel pretty good now,"
Bunn started a chalk talk on of
fensive tactics to be used against the
Trojans.
Principles of the talk were then
put into practice by Luisetti, Moore,
Art Stoefen, Howie Turner, and
Jack Calderwood. The boys looked
good working the ball down for set
ups while Bunn shouted instructions
from midcourt.
Second and third string men
watched from the sidelines during
much of yesterday's session, but to
day they will engage the regulars
in scrimmage. A light workout to
morrow may be followed by another
Friday.
Indians Favored
Three wins in four games this year
make the Indians a slight favorite
over U.S.C., especially with the
game on the Farm. Four of the
southern division's five high scorers
will start. They include Luisetti,
first, and Turner, fifth, for Stanford;
Captain Jack Hupp, second, and
Jerry Gracin, fourth, for the Tro
jans.
