# Wylie's Ruggers In Crucial Bear Tilt Saturday
## Contest Decides League Crown, Possibility of Northern Trip For Indians during Vacation 
### 
Stanford Ruggers gunning
for the Bears in a big way yesterday
alter noon with a scrimmage between
the varsity and the seconds.
Although no score was kept, Coach
Jim Wylie saw marked improvement
in his men who will trek over to
Berkeley next Saturday afternoon
to determine the champion of the
California Intercollegiate Rugby
League. Stanford's record is marred
only by a tie with U.S.C.
Reisner May Not Play
It is almost certain that Johnny
Reisner, whose rugby play Coach
Wylie declares is unsurpassed in
America, will not be able to play
Saturday. His brilliance will be
missed, but Coach Wylie feels that
if the rest of the team plays up to
its capabilities, they will be able to
dispose of the Bears.
Indians Hold Record
Indians have an additional in
centive to beat the Bears —to pre
serve their undefeated record, which
may determine whether the Board
of Athletic Control will give its
financial support to a spring vaca
tion trip on which the ruggers have
been invited to play the University
of British Columbia at Vancouver
and the city teams of Vancouver and
Victoria.
