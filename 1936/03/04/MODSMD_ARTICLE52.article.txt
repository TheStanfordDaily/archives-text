Coach John Bunn and his bas
keteers want to win the play-off
with Troy Saturday night like no
| body's business.
For, in gradual steps, they can
| proceed to the Pacific Conference
Championship, the Tenth District
I championship, the Fifth Disliict
championship, and thence to finals
j for the Olympic Games in Madison
j Square Garden in April.
And seven members of the team
that wins the National Champion
j ship will go to Berlin for the Olym-
I pic exhibitions. Three from the
I runner-up will go, and one each
I from ihe other four teams playing,
i So as there are at least seven
members of the present varsity who
wouldn't at all mind getting the free
; boat-ride to Germany, you can be
i confident that those seven and oth
| ers who may take part will be play
ing with one eye on a colorful trip
up the Rhine this summer.

' HUPP DETAILED
BY CALDERWOOD

Saturday night Troy's big threat
j will be Captain Jack Hupp, who has
; pushed in 138 points this season,
I which is surely no sign of a hard
; winter for Mr. Hupp.
Watching over the Tro-captain,
j like a dog over its sleeping master,
; will be Jack Calderwood, often
: called "Joe Calderbrush" by his
| mates.
In the last Troy series Hupp
i scored 23 points the first night, and
j 7 the second. He only made that
J negligible amount because watch
• ing his every move was Calder

| wood.
So if Joe can subdue Hupp as
nicely Saturday night, Sam Barry
will be bereft of his mightiest of
fensive weapon. Those who saw the
Cal game last Friday know that Joe
played a magnificent defensive game.
Some call him the best guard in the
; conference.
With Hupp being beaten down by
Calderwood, Jerry Gracin remains
j Troy's other offensive threat. Gracin
! is a very smooth bucket-swisher,
and is hard to stop when hot. Ward
t Browning remains as the big pow
erful boy in the Troy offense.

BEST GOLF TEAM
IN THE COUNTRY?

Although it never gets as much
j mention as some of the major sports,
j golf at Stanford is still a .sport that
j Farm people may rightfully brag
| about.
For years now the golfing class
1 about the Farm has said that Eddie
! Twiggs had the best 10-man golf
! team of any college in the country.
Yesterday that boast was pre ft y
well qualified and backed up. Twiggs
released his ladder, and a little cal
culating showed that 14 men were
I averaging below 80 for their last five
rounds.
Now, having 14 men shooting in
the 70's is grounds for declaring, not
boasting any more, that Stanford has
the best golf team in the U.S.A.
