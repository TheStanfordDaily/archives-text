## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism Daily Offers Poll To Aid Proposed Student Expression of Political Views 
### 
One of the most important questions of
public policy that lias been brought before an
Executive Committee in recent years last night
was referred to a committee embodying over
half of the present student governing board.
The question, in effect: Is it advisable for
the Associated Students to go on record as
either approving or disapproving national or
external problems that are of interest or sig
nificance to university students?
The answer to this policy question, and the
answer on which Kx Committee's National
Student Affairs sub-committee undoubtedly
\\ ill agree, is that, in order to encourage stu
dent interest in the outside, oflicial A.S.S.U.
expression of sentiment on national affairs is
desirable.
The committee then must hash out ways
and means of applying a sounding-board to a

slightly lackadaisical student body.
A resolution by Kx Committee could not be
representative enough to stand alone as Stan
ford's student opinion.
Unless the question under discussion were
of great importance, not only nationally but
locally, a student plebiscite would be just as
futile; only the very biased or opinionated
students would drag themselves to the Law
Steps to cast a ballot.
Yet Kx Committee will need some reliable
survey, in order to act on any national (pies
lion.
To facilitate the sounding out of a cross
section opinion, Tim-; Daily oilers to publish
ballots on pertinent national problems, as a
convenient poll for questions Kx Committee
deems worthy of an oflicial A.S.S.l 1 . expres
sion.
