Any wide-awake econ prof can tell you thai
the automobile is hound to replace the horse.
Hut Sequoia Hall hasn't found that out yet.
The other night a group of college youths took
a coll up to the second lloor of the Hall.
Hack in the days when the Mandolin Club
met every Thursday night and men played
football for fun, a horse oil the second lloor
came under the heading of original thinking.
Hy IU;W, however, the gag has the newness
ami punch of a history assistant's joke. Hut
we are supposed to excuse the musty smell on
the grounds that Sequoia is the stamping
ground of that vestigial remainder of the old
Stanford society—the Stanford Rough.
The Rough, that child of impulse, would
never have thought that a horse on Sequoia
was tunny. That would have been child's
play then, as it is now.
Let's frankly admit that the band of ec
centrics in the old homestead is an anachro
nism in an enlightened age when pants are
pleated and coats are bi-swung, when the Axe
is anchored by cold steel to the lloor of a soda
fountain, safe from Herkeley shop-lifters,

where the poor boy lives not on his wits, but
on the NYA.
So it is time for our anti-social rugged indi
vidualists to get on the band-wagon. They
should come out of the stables and onto the
clothes-horse. Meanwhile they can leave the
horsing around to Encina, Pan-Hell, and Dra
matic Council.
