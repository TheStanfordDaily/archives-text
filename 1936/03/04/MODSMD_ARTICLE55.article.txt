# Gentleman from Idaho
## 
### Leonard Blaikie 
(Editor's Note—Senator Borah lias thrown his
hat into the Republican primary ring. Just how
serious the ''Great Isolationist" is in seeking the
nomination and what his chances arc of getting
his party's support come under discussion in
"Gentleman from Idaho." a two-article series hy
Leonard Blaikie which starts today.)

"You can get along without my support, but I
cannot get along without my views," Senator Wil
liam E. Borah is reported to have told President
Harding when the chief executive asked him to be
administration leader on the Senate floor.
Such independence is typical of the 70-year-old,
vigorous, bushy-haired Idaho Senator who is a con
tender for the Republican nomination for president.
Despite Borah's contention that he is angling for
the post, many observers believe that he is seeking
only to gain prestige over his most serious contender
for his seat in the Senate, Governor C. Ben Ross, the
only man ever to be elected for three successive terms
to be the head man of Idaho.
Supporting this contention is the fact that Borah
has been flirting with the Townsend Plan, which is
very popular with the Idaho potato growers, but not
so much so with the hard-headed business men who
form the driving force behind the G.O.P. machine.
Borah's long-standing hatred of the sales tax is not
likely, however, to sit well with any support that he
might give to Dr. Townsend's $200-a-month handout
to the aged.
* * * *
Ross, a mild New Dealer, in his public speeches
actually supports Senator Borah for the presidential
nomination. He, unlike Borah, is distinctly a man of
the street. He speaks in homely language, often using
poor grammar and resorting to religious metaphors
and scriptural quotations to capture the imaginations
of his hearers.
In recommending himself over Borah for the cov
eted seat in the Senate, however, Ross charges that
Borah spends too much time on foreign affairs and not
enough on the affairs >f his home state. Ross has em
barrassed Borah by asking why Borah, the great iso
lationist, voted to plunge America into the World War.
* * * *
Senator Borah rose to fame as the prosecutor of
Big Bill Haywood, who was defended by Clarence
Darrow. In 1907 on his second attempt he was elected
to the United States Senate and he has been re-elected
on five successive occasions.
During his long career in the Senate, Borah has
gained the profound respect of his colleagues, and was
rivaled only by the late Huey Long in packing the
Senate galleries when he spoke. Yet Senator Nye
is the only one of Borah's insurgent Republican allies
who has openly supported him for the presidential
nomination.
Senator Borah has been a loyal supporter of the
liberal movement; hence, he has not been a favorite
with any partisan group. His support was instrumental
in the passage of constitutional amendments provid
ing for the direct election ;ind imposition of the federal
income t;ix. He was one of the first to urge recognition
of the Soviet Republic when that was an extremely
unpopular stand. He campaigned and successfully
maneuvered the Washington naval conference.
* * * *
Mark Sullivan, Washington commentator on po
litical affairs, sums up the principles of the "Gentle
man from Idaho as follows: "Whatever may be Sen
ator Borah's individual eccentricities, he has never
in the faintest degree modified his loyalty to the
American form of government."
However, Borah's lifetime of no.i-allegiance to the
group whose support he now seeks stands in his way,
observers believe, of securing the Republican nomina
tion at Cleveland in June. His strong support in the
Far West is expected to be offset by the opposition of
eastern G.O.P. leaders who are most influential in
selecting the party candidate.

Senator Borah rose to fame as the prosecutor of
Big Bill Haywood, who was defended by Clarence
Darrow. In 1907 on his second attempt he was elected
to the United States Senate and he has been re-elected
on five successive occasions.
During his long career in the Senate, Borah has
gained the profound respect of his colleagues, and was
rivaled only by the late Huey Long in packing the
Senate galleries when he spoke. Yet Senator Nye
is the only one of Borah's insurgent Republican allies
who has openly supported him for the presidential
nomination.
Senator Borah has been a loyal supporter of the
liberal movement; hence, he has not been a favorite
with any partisan group. His support was instrumental
in the passage of constitutional amendments provid
ing for the direct election ;ind imposition of the federal
income t;ix. He was one of the first to urge recognition
of the Soviet Republic when that was an extremely
unpopular stand. He campaigned and successfully
maneuvered the Washington naval conference.

Mark Sullivan, Washington commentator on po
litical affairs, sums up the principles of the "Gentle
man from Idaho as follows: "Whatever may be Sen
ator Borah's individual eccentricities, he has never
in the faintest degree modified his loyalty to the
American form of government."
However, Borah's lifetime of no.i-allegiance to the
group whose support he now seeks stands in his way,
observers believe, of securing the Republican nomina
tion at Cleveland in June. His strong support in the
Far West is expected to be offset by the opposition of
eastern G.O.P. leaders who are most influential in
selecting the party candidate.
(Editor's Note—Senator Borah lias thrown his
hat into the Republican primary ring. Just how
serious the ''Great Isolationist" is in seeking the
nomination and what his chances arc of getting
his party's support come under discussion in
"Gentleman from Idaho." a two-article series hy
Leonard Blaikie which starts today.)

"You can get along without my support, but I
cannot get along without my views," Senator Wil
liam E. Borah is reported to have told President
Harding when the chief executive asked him to be
administration leader on the Senate floor.
Such independence is typical of the 70-year-old,
vigorous, bushy-haired Idaho Senator who is a con
tender for the Republican nomination for president.
Despite Borah's contention that he is angling for
the post, many observers believe that he is seeking
only to gain prestige over his most serious contender
for his seat in the Senate, Governor C. Ben Ross, the
only man ever to be elected for three successive terms
to be the head man of Idaho.
Supporting this contention is the fact that Borah
has been flirting with the Townsend Plan, which is
very popular with the Idaho potato growers, but not
so much so with the hard-headed business men who
form the driving force behind the G.O.P. machine.
Borah's long-standing hatred of the sales tax is not
likely, however, to sit well with any support that he
might give to Dr. Townsend's $200-a-month handout
to the aged.
* * * *
Ross, a mild New Dealer, in his public speeches
actually supports Senator Borah for the presidential
nomination. He, unlike Borah, is distinctly a man of
the street. He speaks in homely language, often using
poor grammar and resorting to religious metaphors
and scriptural quotations to capture the imaginations
of his hearers.
In recommending himself over Borah for the cov
eted seat in the Senate, however, Ross charges that
Borah spends too much time on foreign affairs and not
enough on the affairs >f his home state. Ross has em
barrassed Borah by asking why Borah, the great iso
lationist, voted to plunge America into the World War.
