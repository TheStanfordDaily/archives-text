Why is it that when you drop ,
down to the Union for a coke after ;
a dull 10 o'clock, you feel a sense !
of gloom descend upon you. You i
climb on a stool and look down the 1
row. The sorriest looking people sit I
musing over cups of coffee either j
absently preoccupied or muttering 1
seriously in low tones among them- j
selves. They couldn't all have just j
flunked an ex or received bad news I
from home.

You look up to the right where* a !
' few rays of the light of day filter in j
around Ihe leather furniture. Two j
' or three sad souls (they're usually |
I the same ones day after day) sit j
j silently blowing smoke and reading i
| newspapers. The cigar counter man i
I stands dreamily behind his counter !
doing nothing.
Then a dexterous hasher hands \
I you the coke, a glass of water and |
| the check all in one motion and
1 with a gesture that indicates he is j
I through with you.

If, when you're through drinking !
the coke, you continue to sit, you ;
; feel as if someone were staring at '
you from behind wondering why you j
j don't get up and leave. So you non- I
| chalantly light a cigarette, walk (
1 over to the grating which is ex- '
actly like the one at the place you
pay speeding fines, and lay down |
your nickel before the woman who I
never says a word.
Then you get a lift upon leaving
j the cellar that beats any brand of
j smoke ever produced.

What a blow a scenario writer
who can't conceive of a college
j without a campus "hangout" where
i the gang gathers to plunk ukeleles,
I give cheers for the team, hail their
j fellows as well met, and sluff up
| parfaits would get if he came to the
I Farm. He's think the Cellar was

THAT DREARY HOLE IN THE GROUND

the faculty club, not the only place
where you can buy an ice cream
cone.

Consolation on the whole unfor- j
tunate matter is not lacking, how- ;
ever. The Cellar has not always
been, and we can hope that it will
not always be. In the days of
Sticky Wilson, that little building
back of the Bookstore was really a
bright spot on the campus. Every
body made it a point to be seen
in Sticky's at least once a day. But
who cares if he's seen by the group j
of people who frequent the Cellar? (
