# CONCERNING WAR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is a pleasure to find someone
thinking critically on the question of
war and peace as is Mr. Ralph Stots
ky in his recent letter to Vox Campi.
Can his reasoning be carried just a
few steps further?
1. The League of Nations is im

: portant in practice, no matter what
the reality of the need for co-opera-
I tion. The mere ideal of co-opera
tion is ineffective before the neces
sity of conflict of our present na
tional economic structures, where
economic control is steadily being
tightened to maintain profits, the
share of labor is diminishing, espe
| cially in Italy and Germany, de
j stroying the home market with the
result worthy of Munchausen that
every nation must, and expects, to
sell more than it buys.
2. Mr. Stotsky is right about the
R.O.T.C. in that it is unimportant
compared to real sources of war.
i But like Hitler's Storm Troopers, a

widespread habit of military dis
cipline is not compatible with dem
ocracy for long.
But â€”where is the "inherent base
ness of human nature" that leads to
war? Wouldn't it be belter to say
that struggle is necessary for
growth? Drayton S. Bryant
