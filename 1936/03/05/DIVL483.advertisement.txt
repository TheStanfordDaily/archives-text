We suspect that the 1936 man is the most exacting
person we have tried to please in a long time. For
the past few years the man of America has been
heading straight in the direction of tailored precise
ness in his clothes. Style has become a brave bid for
success and fortune. Style is looking up. Well, sir,
to you as the 1936 man we say that The Manhattan
Shirt Company has developed a group of shirts that
will be a welcome sight for your critical gaze. For
here are shirts that have style and more —they have
finish, polish, the smart distinction that only truly
accomplished tailoring can impart to men's shirts. All
the new style developments are here, created for the
1936 man. New collars and new colors . . . new
pit terns, new ideas aplenty. See them today
