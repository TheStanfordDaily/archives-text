# Cagers Work To Penetrate U.S.C. Attack
## Scrub Quintet Employs Trojan Tactics for Varsity Practice; Shooting Is Also Emphasized 
### 
Stanford's Olympic-bound basket
ball loam should not be baffled by
the U.S.C. system Saturday night in
the southern division play-off. That
much was evident in practice yes
terday.
After four regular games this sea
son, Coach John Bunn gave his
charges a more recent introduction
to Trojan methods, imitated by
Wytze Goiter's scrub quintet. Led
by Chief Imitator Gorter, who
played the role of Jack Hupp, the
reserves employed tactics similar to
those taught by Sam Barry.
Attack Broken
This exhibition, lacking only in
polish, failed to bother the Indian
regulars to a great extent. The
team that beat the Bears —Hank

Luisetti and Howell Turner, for
wards; Art Stoefen, center; and
Captain Dinty Moore and Jack
Calderwood, guards—broke up tht
"Trojan" attack and pierced its de
fense with considerable success.
Calderwood and Turner drew a
shout of "Good, good!" from Bunn
early in the session by co-operating
on a nice piece of ball-stealing and
scoring. Judging from this scrim
mage, Messers. Hupp, Graein,
Browning, Oram, and Muth of the
Trojans must play better ball than
in their two Pavilion games back in
January to have any better luck.
High Score Likely
Warning reports from the South
indicate that U.S.C. has matched In
dian progress since their last meet
ing. Her 55-26 victory over U.C.L.A.,
even though the Bruins were "off,"
makes the chance of a high-scoring
game appear likely.
If Moore and Calderwood guard
the Trojan forwards as well as they
bottled up California's, Luisetti,
Turner, and Stoefen will have an
easier time scoring enough points.
New offensive and defensive plays,
cooked up for this game, were out
lined by Bunn on the blackboard
yesterday, to help solve both prob
lems.
Both first and second teams prac
ticed shots from an imaginary arc
about 20 feet from the basket. There
will be no scrimmage today, but
more work on shooting will be in
order, to keep eyes for the basket
sharp. A final light drill may be
held tomorrow.
