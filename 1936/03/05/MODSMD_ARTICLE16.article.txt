All undergraduate students on
NYA who wish to continue working
spring quarter must fill out new
application blanks this week, as sep- j
arate applications must be on file
for each quarter, announces Mrs.
Irene W. Coverley.
Those undergraduates who can
not work their full 30 hours before
March 20 should let Mrs. Coverley

new payroll period will start March
21 as usual.
All undergraduate students are I
requested to get their release cards
before leaving the campus for spring !

Students on NYA who plan to re

their regular jobs during vacation if
the department where their work is
done stays open.
