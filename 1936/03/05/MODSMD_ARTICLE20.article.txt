# Compromise Between Wilbur, Houses Seen
## Proposed Plan Includes Open Week-end, on Campus Rushing During Autumn Quarter 
### 
Dr. Wilbur came up on the Row
last, evening to aid in the settling
of the knottiest of all fraternity
problems—rushing.
When he left, after explaining his
views plainly to Interfraternity
Council members, the Row men
found themselves clear on at least
one point—how far they could go in
revising the present rushing rules.
Plan Is Compromise
With that point cleared, the j
Council set itself to enlighten the
committee of the Interfraternity
Board, which will draft new rush
ing rules, as to what kind of rush
ing plan it favors.
That plan is substantially a com
promise to the one which Dr. Wil
bur himself laid before the council,
ing throughout autumn quarter with
ing through autumn quarter, with
no off-campus rushing, and pledging
in the first part of winter quarter.
With a vote of 13 to 5, the council
went on record as favoring this pro
posal. And with another, and this
time unanimous, vote, it defined a
week-end as ending before dinner
on Saturday nights.
Council Votes
Desiring to get a majority opin
ion on all proposed points, Presi
dent Littlefield called for a vote on
the following proposals:
1. Fraternity men to stay out of
Encina during entire rushing pe
riod—passed unanimously.
2. Pledging as soon as possible in
the winter quarter—passed unani- j
mously. |
3. Complete open rushing during 1
autumn quarter—defeated by vote
of S to 12.
4. Open rushing every week on ;
Wednesdays and Sundays—passed i
by vote of 8 to 7.
5. Open rushing during first two
weeks of winter quainter just before j
pledging—defeated by vote of 7 to 11. j
6. No rushing of any kind during
first two weeks of autumn quarter
—passed unanimously.
With these recommendations in
hand, the Interfraternity Board's
special committee will draft a set
of rushing rules to be presented to :
President Wilbur, probably next j
week, for approval.
