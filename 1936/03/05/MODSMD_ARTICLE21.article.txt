# Union Hasher Nearly Loses Life in Lake
## 
### 
Lagunita nearly took its toll last !
Sunday when Vince "Tex" Ryan, I
Union hasher, tipped from his canoe !
and became stricken with cramps.
Because Ryan was tall enough,
being 6 feet 9 inches, to raise his .
hand out of the water, and because i
Bob Sutherland realized that Ryan

| was not joking, big Tex is able to
j tell his story today.
Ryan was knocked from his canoe
three times during a water fight
with several other boys. The third
time he was seized by leg cramps
j and unable to kick up. His com-
I panion, knowing that he could swim,
had taken the canoe back to shore.
