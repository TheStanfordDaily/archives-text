# A.S.S.U. No One-Horse Affair; Spent $128,000 Last Year
## 
### Margaret Loud 
If you think your student body
organization is some one-horse af
fair which any Milpitas clerk could
run, go talk to Student Manager i
Bob Gros.
"It's a business institution, as big I
as lots of corporations. Why, we
take in and spend over $128,000 in a j
single year," he told us yesterday j
from behind a desk full of business i
papers.
To control efficiently the finances I
and accounting of almost 100 cam
pus ciubs, from Phi Beta Kappa to '
Roble to the German Club, back in !
1920 A.S.S.U. officials developed the !
business-like central banking sys
tern in use today, the Students' Or- I
ganizations Fund.
Unwind Red Tape
Club treasurers, to get money for
organization expenses, must unwind ,
a lot of red tape—authorizations, 1
payment orders, signatures, and i
counter-signatures. Funds are pro
tected by a system of check-ups all
along the line. Books are audited |
yearly, managers of activities (like!
dramatic manager) and publication '
managers are under bond, and all
money not budgeted must be spe- i
cifically appropriated by Ex Com
mittee.
A1 Masters, popularly connected
only with B.AC., is really the finan
cial baron of the entire A.S.S.U.
General manager of the fund and I

financial adviser of the student body,,
Masters appoints a student manager
—that's Bob Gros, right now — to
handle most of the work.
Just Works Here
"I wish people would forget the I
myth that I control funds," he
I sighed. "Ex Committee's my boss.
I I just work here." Gros administers
I funds subject to Ex Committee ap
proval.
Last year's turnover —$128,000 —is
j more than twice that of 1920. Single
expenditures range anywhere from
' $10,000, first contribution to the the
ater fund, to 16 cents for a gallon
of gas to take President Wally
| Brooke to Redwood City (on busi-
I ness.)
Student property is fully insured
for fire, earthquake, and theft. There
i is even workmen's compensation for
1 employees—so when a dance direc
! tor tumbles from a ladder, his hos
pital bills will be paid.
Real Kingp.ns
| Three full-time clerks in the |
! A.S.S.U. office tend to routine busi- 1
ness. Miss Stevens and Miss Aten,
Gros says, are the real kingpins of
i the whole set-up because of their
experience and knowledge of prece
! dent.
Salaries of such student officers as
publication editors and dramatic!
\ manager are paid from the central
I fund. Police for campus grounds!

and dances, Daily delivery boys,
dance decorators, concert workers—
the A.S.S.U. pays 'em all.
Student Manager Gros has the
job of seeing that student affairs
conform to the rules set down for
them. More than once Bob says he's
gotten all tuxed up to go to a dance
for 20 minutes to see if the punch
isn't dishwater instead of the gin
gerale the contract promised.
"At the Alpha Delt formal at
the St. Francis last week-end," he
said, "I caught myself looking to see
if the hat-checkers were accepting
tips."

Unwind Red Tape
Club treasurers, to get money for
organization expenses, must unwind ,
a lot of red tape—authorizations, 1
payment orders, signatures, and i
counter-signatures. Funds are pro
tected by a system of check-ups all
along the line. Books are audited |
yearly, managers of activities (like!
dramatic manager) and publication '
managers are under bond, and all
money not budgeted must be spe- i
cifically appropriated by Ex Com
mittee.
A1 Masters, popularly connected
only with B.AC., is really the finan
cial baron of the entire A.S.S.U.
General manager of the fund and I

"I wish people would forget the I
myth that I control funds," he
I sighed. "Ex Committee's my boss.
I I just work here." Gros administers
I funds subject to Ex Committee ap
proval.
Last year's turnover —$128,000 —is
j more than twice that of 1920. Single
expenditures range anywhere from
' $10,000, first contribution to the the

of gas to take President Wally

I ness.)
Student property is fully insured
for fire, earthquake, and theft. There
i is even workmen's compensation for

| Three full-time clerks in the |
! A.S.S.U. office tend to routine busi- 1

Gros says, are the real kingpins of
i the whole set-up because of their

publication editors and dramatic!

and dances, Daily delivery boys,
dance decorators, concert workers—
the A.S.S.U. pays 'em all.
Student Manager Gros has the
job of seeing that student affairs
conform to the rules set down for
them. More than once Bob says he's
gotten all tuxed up to go to a dance
for 20 minutes to see if the punch
isn't dishwater instead of the gin
gerale the contract promised.
"At the Alpha Delt formal at
the St. Francis last week-end," he
said, "I caught myself looking to see
if the hat-checkers were accepting
tips."
If you think your student body
organization is some one-horse af
