# One â€“ year Rule Essential In Rushing Scheme, President Tells Fraternity Council
## 
### John McClelland 
"What would you think of keep
ing the pledge date as it is, have no
off - campus rushing, and confine
your rushing to week-ends?"
Willi that question Dr. Wilbur
last evening admitted he was will
ing to compromise with the frater
nity men on the question of revised
rushing plans, and struck what ap
peared to he a chord of agreement
among the Row leaders.
Date Discussed
Move the pledging date back and
get rushing over early! That has
been the cry of the fraternities. If
any change i.s to be made, pledging
date should be moved into spring
quarter! This has been the answer
by Dr. Wilbur.
A compromise seemed inevitable.
And a compromise looms as the
councils turn their attention from
the problem of pledging date to the
problems of actual rushing tactics.
Wilbur Answers
Dr. Wilbur appeared before the
Interfraternity Council at the Phi
Delt house last night in the role of
answer man. For every question put
to him by the fraternity leaders he
had an answer reflecting the Admin
istration's long standing attitude
toward the whole fraternity situa
tion.
The one-year rule, Dr. Wilbur
said, must stand. "It is not wise for
a freshman to have too early a
choice. He should have a chance to
get acquainted on the campus, and
to prove his capacities.
Problem Stated
"One of the greatest difficulties in
the University if that of students
leaving school early in their sopho
more year. This fact is in large
part due to maladjustments in the
fraternity houses.
"fraternities arc no longer the
gathering points of the men; they
are the distributing points. They
are supporting a lot of hotels and
road houses, and the freshmen
arc brought into this atmosphere
all too soon."
Expressing again his desire for a
minimum of rushing rules, the
President said:
"The rules we had never seemed
grown up to me. They seemed high
schoolish. The rules existed but
were continually broken."
In defense of his proposal that
pledging take place in spring quar
ter, Dr. Wilbur pointed out that in
the early rush for freshmen, many
junior college men and transfers
were overlooked.
Honor Plan Lauded
A gentleman's agreement, accord
ing to Dr. Wilbur, is the substitute
for minor rushing rules.
"We have an honor code," ho
said, "and I think the fraternity
men as well as the freshmen would
be more willing to abide by it than
by petty rules."
Asked if he considered sophomore
"deaths" were due in part to the
fact that sophomores did most of the
rushing, Dr. Wilbur replied:
"In the first place I object to
the term 'rushing.' A man should
not be rushed into a life-time
association. That should be done
leisurely. And sophomores cer
tainly are not the men to do the
rushing. They are essentially
'squabs.' No stage in life is quite
as bad as that of (he sophomore.
They are the biggest fools, and
when they attempt to run the
houses, they make endless mis
takes."
Dr. Wilbur ended his comments
with a clear statement as to what
he hoped the Council would ac
complish:
"If you can work out a plan," he
said, "with a gentleman's agreement
in it and a minimum of rules, I'd
be perfectly willing to go on with it
on that basis."
