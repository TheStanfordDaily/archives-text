SENIORS are being appointed by
thair class president to do almost
everything. A member of the Class
of '36 who doesn't land some sort of
job on one of those committees ought
to feel as ignominious as a football
player who doesn't make at least
one of the myriads of ALL-Some
thingorother teams named at the
end of the season.
I>R. TREAT put scareheads and
jingoes on the run last night in his
turn at the Tuesday Evening Lec
ture Series. Garbled press reports
and hair-brained analyses of the
situation by self-alleged "experts"
like Chester Rowell are enough to
have most Americans licking their
chops in anticipation of seeing a
I!usso-Japanese war.
Stanford can thank its lucky star
that it retains a man who really
knows what it is all about as its
consulting Far East informer.
RUSSIA'S GREAT worry, Dr.
Fisher of the Hoover War Libe will
tell you, is Germany. The recent
pact between Russia and France is
a "non-aggression" agreement pro
viding for Russian alliance with
France if Germany attacks the lat
ter, and vice-versa.
Germany, therefore, is pretty well
sewed up by the two countries
which fear her most. An alliance
with Italy or England is about all
there is left for der vaterland.
ROY HOWARD, chairman of the
board of the Scripps-Howard news
papers, obtained a three-hour inter
view with Comrade Josef Stalin
Tuesday. Much publicized by the
United Press and by the Associated
Press, the interview is noteworthy
only because it is one of those rare
things—an interview with Stalin.
Neither noteworthy or sensational
is the revelation that Russia would
take positive steps to evict Japan
from Ulan Bator, the capital of
Outer Mongolia, if the Nipponese
troops seized the city.
Why? Because it wouldn't be
news were President Roosevelt to
say that the U.S. would war on the
Japanese if they were to seize Mex
ico City. Because it wouldn't be
news if the Emperor of Japan were
to say that Japan would try to kick
Russians out if the comrades moved
in on the capital of Manchukuo.
Because it wouldn't be news for you

to announce that you would kick a
tramp out of the neighbor's yard, if
you have been given that yard to
care for, or if the tramp's presence
in that yard were dangerous to your
welfare.

Nearly 150 languages are spoken in
the Soviet Union of Russia. •
