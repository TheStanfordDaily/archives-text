# Sunday Night Will Find Libe Open
## 
### 
The library will remain open
until 10 o'clock for the two fol
lowing Sundays, March 8 and 15.
This action was taken by Direc
tor Nathan van Patten as a "trial
move."
"If the students take advantage
of this effort to aid them," he said,
"the policy of having the Stanford
Library open on Sunday nights
will be a permanent one."
