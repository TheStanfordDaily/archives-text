# Farm's Story Reads Like Exciting Drama

Stanford. The University will
celebrate Founder's Day next
Monday, March !).

Senator Stanford lay dead, his
guiding hand removed from the
University he had founded in his
son's memory. Dark days were to
follow . . .
Her two weeks of mourning seclu
sion over, Jane Lathrop Stanford
faced an America stunned by the
debacle of the Depression of 1893.
She found herself called upon to
make superhuman decisions; and
she knew that one false decision
might mean that the doors of the
University would close forever. The
story of how she almost single
handed brought the school through
its darkest days forms one of the
most dramatic pages in the history
of the Farm.
All incomes from business had
ceased. With the exception of a
collection of rare jewels given her
by her husband, Mrs. Stanford had
nothing but the community estate,
and this she could draw upon for
personal maintenance only until all
obligations were cancelled—a mat
ter of a year or two, if all went

well. What was she to do?
Only for a second did she hesi
tate before signifying her intention
to proceed with the University. She
would let the Board of Trustees
have all the money she could pos
sibly secure; for a time it might not
be much—but she knew that the
doors must not close.
At first it seemed the school could
not possibly continue. Teachers' sal
aries had to be paid by personal
check, the Probate Court regarding
them as Mrs. Stanford's servants,
since the University as yet had no
legal status. The court would allow
her $12,500 monthly over and above
her personal needs; but the salary
roll alone amounted to $15,000
monthly.
Obviously some further source of
income must be found, and so it was
decided to impose a tuition fee of
$20. The situation was further alle
viated by the decision of President
Jordan and the faculty to accept a 10
per cent cut in salary, and virtually
waive all right to claim the money
at some later date.
Clearly Mrs. Stanford was not
alone in her fight, and for a time
things seemed to be growing better.
But Stanford was by no means out
of danger, and it was several years
before the heroic work of its re
maining founder was done.

ceased. With the exception of a
collection of rare jewels given her
by her husband, Mrs. Stanford had
nothing but the community estate,
and this she could draw upon for
personal maintenance only until all
obligations were cancelled—a mat
ter of a year or two, if all went

well. What was she to do?
Only for a second did she hesi
tate before signifying her intention
to proceed with the University. She
would let the Board of Trustees
have all the money she could pos
sibly secure; for a time it might not
be much—but she knew that the
doors must not close.
At first it seemed the school could
not possibly continue. Teachers' sal
aries had to be paid by personal
check, the Probate Court regarding
them as Mrs. Stanford's servants,
since the University as yet had no
legal status. The court would allow
her $12,500 monthly over and above
her personal needs; but the salary
roll alone amounted to $15,000
monthly.
Obviously some further source of
income must be found, and so it was
decided to impose a tuition fee of
$20. The situation was further alle
viated by the decision of President
Jordan and the faculty to accept a 10
per cent cut in salary, and virtually
waive all right to claim the money
at some later date.
Clearly Mrs. Stanford was not
alone in her fight, and for a time
things seemed to be growing better.
But Stanford was by no means out
of danger, and it was several years
before the heroic work of its re
maining founder was done.

lating dramatic struggles of early
Stanford. The University will
celebrate Founder's Day next
Monday, March !).

Senator Stanford lay dead, his
guiding hand removed from the
University he had founded in his
son's memory. Dark days were to
follow . . .
Her two weeks of mourning seclu
sion over, Jane Lathrop Stanford
faced an America stunned by the
debacle of the Depression of 1893.
She found herself called upon to
make superhuman decisions; and
she knew that one false decision
might mean that the doors of the
University would close forever. The
story of how she almost single
handed brought the school through
its darkest days forms one of the
most dramatic pages in the history
of the Farm.
