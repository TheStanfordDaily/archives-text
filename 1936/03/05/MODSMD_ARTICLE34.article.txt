# Sideline Slants...
## NO SLIM CHANCE FOR HORSEHIDERS 
### 
Eight days ago Harry Wolter and
his baseball team op tied the con
ference icason by getting beaten by
St. Mary's.
But that was no insult, for St.
Marys is the team that is being
loomed to win the pennant this
year.
La I Saturday, Stanford won
handily from Santa Clara. That was
.something, for the Btoncs are a
heavy-hitting outfit and were con
sidered one of the most improved
teams in the circuit.
When the Cards slipped the
Drones the Bronx cheer, it was like
a millenium for Card baseball, for
then and there they wire shoved
up into a sunny place of conference
ball favor, in line to give the Gaels
and Trojan: biggest pre-season fa
vorites, nine innings of good ball.
This year the rise of Stanford to
pennant possibility further compli
cates the conference race. Troy
and Moraga loom strongest. St.
Mary's has Lefty Flannagan on the
mound, and Troy has "Goofy Joe"
Gonzales for his final semester of
hurling duty.
California, usually moulded by
Clint Evans into .1 pennant con
tender, is not so strong with the bat
1 his year, many of last year's slug
gers having graduated. While many
regulars are recruited from the
football team, Vince Fite, regular
first sacker, is out for the season.
Uela and Santa Clara are also in
the race with good fielding teams.
The Broncs have Bill Dutton, Joe
Schick, and Dick Bassi for the heavy
slick-work, while Radunich, a new
pitcher, has the makings of one of
the state's best.
