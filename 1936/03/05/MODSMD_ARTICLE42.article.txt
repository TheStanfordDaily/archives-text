### Phil Klauber 
Ay now is the time for all good
handicappers to start their concensus
of the coming Berlin Olympiad, the
ol' "boy wonder coach,"' Hubert Ly
man Tempieton, put himself into
high gear yesterday and made some
predictions on Stanford chances, to
be dated under February:
"There's no one can beat Ben
Eastman at either 400 or 800 meters
tiiis summer. The 800 comes first, so
his easiest race will ba there.
"Norm Bright should make the
American 5000-meter, team easily,
but his troubles will begin in
Europe.
"Slinger Dunn is probably the
best American discus thrower,
which means he will be in a good
j way over there.
"Johnny Lyman is in Heidelberg
now, and doesn't want to come over
! here to qualify. He won't do much
shot-putting until this spring; they
! may let him qualify without return
ing He can show them.
"Johnny Mottram oughta make
the American javelin team. Then
we'll see.
"If Bud Deacon competes this
j season, he could make the pole
vault grade.
"A1 Blackmail can run in any
body '.s quarter. Comeback? He
never was down!
"The way Jim Reynolds is shot
j putting now, he may get there.
"Phil Levy in Ihe discus has a
i chance, too.
i "Here Laborde may return to dis

cus competition this year, and prob
ablv could make the Berlin team.
"Sam Ivlopstock has a good
chance in the hurdles.
"Roy Kirkpatrick is a cinch to
make the trip as a hurdler.
"Humbert Smith and Les Steers, I
am afraid, are up against too many
smokes in the high jump.
"Because the number of relay
men that are selected for the 400
and 1600 meter teams, Weierhauser,
Mallott, Kneubuhl. all oi them might
get on board."
Bill Miller, polu vr."lter, Bob
Jones, Harlow Rothert, and Nelson
Gray, weightmen greats of other
years, are through competing, con
cluded Tempieton.
