Although probably very few of the house
presidents realize it, Interl'raternity Council
last night virtually arrived at the long-sought
compromise in rushing procedure.
Dr. Wilbur conceded one point: he will per
mit the houses to continue winter quarter
pledging. The fraternities also conceded a
point and silenced their requests for autumn
pledging. Both points were foregone conclu
sions before the meeting look place.
The significant thing, however, was the un
ollicial Council vote which strongly favored
unrestricted on-campus rushing, with the
exceptions that How-men would agree to stay
out of Encina entirely and that the frosh
would be permitted in the fraternity houses
only on week-ends.
That was Dr. Wilbur's plan. The most
practical and virtuous point in the President's
entire proposal, however — a gentleman's
agreement—was bandied about with a lot of
words that apparently meant little to the
house-representatives who spoke them.
The houses have tentatively agreed to give
the open week-end plan a year's try, but they
still have no true conception of the only

means of enforcement that could ever make
any rushing program effective.
They spoke of gentleman's agreements and
an "honor system," and in the same breath
hatched out cute little proposals for mutually
proctoring each other.
The Interl'raternity Hoard's special com- '
mittee now has something with which to
work, and finally may draft a satisfactory
rushing system. Hut that system —or any
other—will not work until each of the houses
takes the knife out of the other's back.
The apparent assumption among Stanford's
fraternities is that there is no honor among
thieves. None of the houses will trust the j
others, and for that matter, very few of them
have given any indication that thev them
selves can be trusted in this competitive mat
ter of rushing.
Much educational work in each of the !
houses and in Encina along the lines of honor ;
and gentlemanly behavior will be a prerequi
site to putting over any gentleman's agree- j
ment in rushing. The end. nevertheless,
clearly is worth all the bother this means
would entail.
