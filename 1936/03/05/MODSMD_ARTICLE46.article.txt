## 
### 
Fortunate indeed is Mr. Henry A. Colom
bek, young navy petty ollicer, charged with
the murder of Helen Tarbox last November,
for he has the most powerful friend in all
California â€”a press that takes the trying of
criminal cases into its own hands.
Convinced from the first that he is inno
cent, the San Francisco Chronicle has under
taken to acquit (iolombek in the eyes of pub
lic opinion just as many newspapers at
tempted to convict David Lamson and Bruno
Hauptinnnn before their trials were even
begun.
Is it that the courts cannot be depended
upon, or is the press simply getting presump
tuous?
