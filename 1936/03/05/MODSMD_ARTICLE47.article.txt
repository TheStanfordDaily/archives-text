# Mural Sports Need A Bigger Budget
## 
### 
When the Board of Athletic Control meets
this evening to start its annual dollar-juggling
act, it will of course lake a look at last year's
budget which was balanced to perfection due
to a golden inpour from Pasadena.
Down through the live-figure items titled
intercollegiate sports, maintenance, adminis
trative expense, etc., the board of ten will find
an insignificant sum which rides along year

alter year at $500. Jt is the amount appro
priated to cover the expenses of the intra
mural sports program.
Now it' the Board should desire to preface
ils hair-tearing over the mulli-thousand-dollar
items with some simple mental arithmetic, it
could consider this problem: In the year's in- j
tramurul program there were 2,000 partiei- j
pants. At $500 that makes two hits a man.
The intramural program, obviously, pro
vides athletic competition for more men than i
all intercollegiate sports combined. And it has !
managed to get along on its $500 allotment
which is used principally for equipment and
trophies.
But so important is the intramural pro
gram in the sphere of campus activities that
it can stand substantial boosting. Increasing
the annual allotment to .$l,OOO would cer
tainly be no extravagance and ils usefulness
in promoting intramural sports is beyond
question.
