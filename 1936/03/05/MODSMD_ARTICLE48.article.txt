### Leonard Blaikie 
(Editor's Note—Senator Borah's foreign policy
furnishes the meat of Leonard Blaikic's second
article on the Great Isolationist's potentialities as
a presidential threat.)
If Senator William E. Borah possesses no other
qualifications for the presidency, he has the courage
of his convictions, despite opposition from deeply in
trenched partisan groups.
When his colleagues in the Senate decided to raise
their salaries from $7,500 a year to $10,000 the veteran
senator bitterly opposed this "money-grabbing" and
for several years after the raise was secured over his
objections, he refused the extra $2,500 in his pay
envelope.

Senator Borah, although he represented in the
Senate a relatively small constituency devoted largely
to the humble tasks of raising potatoes, cutting tim
ber, or mining ores, became better known both at
home and abroad than any of his colleagues.
His interests centered largely upon foreign affairs,
holding since 1924 the position of chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee. He has championed the
cause of isolation, affirming only recently his beliefs
in |an address upholding President Washington's
advice to avoid foreign entanglements.

Senator Borah is also an ardent supporter of the
Constitution and the present status of the Supreme
Court. Writing in the February issue of Redbook
magazine, he said, "A little patience, a little courage,
a little faith, will stimulate tremendously one's confi
dence in the efficiency and permanency of constitu
tional government."
Answering one by one the criticisms hurled at the
Constitution, Senator Borah in the article confirms his
faith in the American charter document and the Su
preme Court's adaptation of its principles to the prob
lems of modern life.
"There is no finer record in protecting human
rights," he said, "than that recorded in decisions of i
the Supreme Court of the United Stales."
To the proposal that Ihe Supreme Court pass upon
the constitutionality of contemplated legislation, he
replied that any scheme which embarrasses the Court
in giving a free, full, unbiased, uncommitted con.sid- |
eration to the claim of a private citizen strikes at the
very foundation of the Court's dignity and worth.

Of the plea for centralization of national leader- 1
ship, the 70-year-old dean of American senators said,
"Mussolini never stated ihe doctrine of fascism with i
greater boldness or clarity than in this clamor . . .
Individual leadership has its place, but there is a
higher leadership to which all individual leadership
must be subordinated, and that is the leadership which
comes from the combined heart and brain, and from
the conscience and the soul of millions of intelligent
and patriotic people. That is a leadership less amen
able to the call of ambition, less likely to suffer from
the corroding cffect of power, and more likely to take
into consideration the welfare of all."
Whether the Republican powers-that-be would
choose such an individualist as Borah for its bid for
the presidency remains be seen. Other men in the
running are supporting the stand-pat-on-thc-Consti
tution policy who may be more regular than Borah
in their political activities and hence more attractive
to the G.O.P. leaders.
