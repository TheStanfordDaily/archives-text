The Psych department is always testing things.
When they get enough things tested, which happens
about every month or so, depending on the weather,
death, and taxes, they add them all up. After carefully
checking their findings, why, then they correlate them,
being sure not to reach any conclusion, because that
is unscientific. Then thuy write a paper on it. They
affix a catchy title, send it East to some scientific
journal, and then everybody immediately forgets all
about the whole business.
One of these very scientific surveys at one time was
testing dexterity and how it was affected by age. The
scientists had whipped out a tremendous graph, which
showed that from the age of 50 on, skill fell off
rapidly. But suddenly, at the age of 80, the graph
shot up so that an 80-year-old man was represented
as a spry youth of 50.
The secret of this great discrepancy is that the
only man whom they could test at this age, was a
certain Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of geology,
who knows more about earthquakes than the earth
quakes do themselves.
Dr. Willis keeps his youth with vigorous exercise.
Almost every afternoon in the week finds the bewhis
kered scientist taking a vigorous workout on the
weights in Encina Gym. He lopes about the campus
at a fast pace, while his younger but more sedentary
colleagues pant along behind him. If there are stairs
to climb, he doesn't walk up them, he runs. This,
combined with his venerable appearance, has set him
off as a campus figure.
When the Golden Gate Bridge engineers started
sinking their shafts to bridge the bay a couple of years
ago, Dr. Willis, who knows the San Gabriel fault by
heart and backwards and forwards, noticed that they
were building their pier on serpentine rock along the
fault line. He told them ihis, but they wanted to build
a bridge, so they called him a liar, and got a Cal
geology prof who would say it wasn't so. Thanked
in this way for his solicitude, Dr. Willis withdrew
from the controversy.
This tremendous account is all in the way of an
introduction to a story overheard by one of my H-men
about the scientist. It seems that an A.K.L. was wan
dering through the bosky dells back of the campus
last week when Bailey Willis came striding up to him.
Dr. Willis, who wanted to know the composition of a
rock he was carrying, asked, "Are you a chemist?"
"No," said the A.K.L., who though the man was
probably a Townsendite on the loose, "why don't you
go see a geologist?"

to climb, he doesn't walk up them, he runs. This,
combined with his venerable appearance, has set him
off as a campus figure.
When the Golden Gate Bridge engineers started
sinking their shafts to bridge the bay a couple of years
ago, Dr. Willis, who knows the San Gabriel fault by
heart and backwards and forwards, noticed that they
were building their pier on serpentine rock along the
fault line. He told them ihis, but they wanted to build
a bridge, so they called him a liar, and got a Cal
geology prof who would say it wasn't so. Thanked
in this way for his solicitude, Dr. Willis withdrew
from the controversy.
This tremendous account is all in the way of an
introduction to a story overheard by one of my H-men
about the scientist. It seems that an A.K.L. was wan
dering through the bosky dells back of the campus
last week when Bailey Willis came striding up to him.
Dr. Willis, who wanted to know the composition of a
rock he was carrying, asked, "Are you a chemist?"
"No," said the A.K.L., who though the man was
probably a Townsendite on the loose, "why don't you
go see a geologist?"
The Psych department is always testing things.
When they get enough things tested, which happens
about every month or so, depending on the weather,
death, and taxes, they add them all up. After carefully
checking their findings, why, then they correlate them,
being sure not to reach any conclusion, because that
is unscientific. Then thuy write a paper on it. They
affix a catchy title, send it East to some scientific
journal, and then everybody immediately forgets all
about the whole business.
One of these very scientific surveys at one time was
testing dexterity and how it was affected by age. The
scientists had whipped out a tremendous graph, which
showed that from the age of 50 on, skill fell off
rapidly. But suddenly, at the age of 80, the graph
shot up so that an 80-year-old man was represented
as a spry youth of 50.
The secret of this great discrepancy is that the
only man whom they could test at this age, was a
certain Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of geology,
who knows more about earthquakes than the earth
quakes do themselves.
Dr. Willis keeps his youth with vigorous exercise.
Almost every afternoon in the week finds the bewhis
kered scientist taking a vigorous workout on the
weights in Encina Gym. He lopes about the campus
at a fast pace, while his younger but more sedentary
colleagues pant along behind him. If there are stairs
to climb, he doesn't walk up them, he runs. This,
combined with his venerable appearance, has set him
off as a campus figure.
