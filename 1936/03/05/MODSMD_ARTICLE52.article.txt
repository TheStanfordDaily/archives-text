# Japanese Prima Donna Pleases As 'Butterfly'
## 
### 
A sensation? No.
But Hizi Kovke, diminutive Japa
nese soprano of the San Carlo Opera
Company, who will repeat her por
trayal of Cho-Cho-San in "MAD
AME BUTTERFLY" tomorrow
night, has a sweet, clear voice and a
pleasing personality.
In contrast to the elephantine
prima donnas who usually sing this
role, Miss Koyke is not only lovely j
to look at but also shows consid- I
erable acting ability. As the pitiful |
"Butterfly," her performance is con- i
vincing and enjoyable.
The rest of the east in last week's
production was poor. Voices that in
many instances lacked the volume
necessary to fill San Francisco's |
Opera House made the audience 1
strain to catch the music. Direction,
too, was not all that it should have j
been, singers often being too far
back on the stage; the scenery in |
the first act was too colorful.
Nevertheless, this opera of Puc
cini's based on the book by John L.
Long and the drama by David Bel- i
asco, is worth hearing if only for the !
sake of Miss Koyke and the charm- ;
ing music and story. Levi

cisco cultural front include the New
