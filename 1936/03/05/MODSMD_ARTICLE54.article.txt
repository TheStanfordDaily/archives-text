# MAJORITY EQUALS DEMOCRACY

### 
The Editor, Sir:
When people of a theoretical vs.
practical outlook come into contact,
there often is difference of opinion.
Using my authority vested in me as
a resident of Santa Barbara by Mr.
i Enke, I choose to take it that I am
j upholding the practical viewpoint.
Looking at the situation from this
j standpoint it appears that Southern
i California has been confronted with
a transient problem. These people
have been coming over the border
by the thousands, the greater ma
jority to go on relief roles upon
j arriving.
Now then, the problem was, what
j to do? Mr. Enke apparently would
' do nothing. Chief Davis, with the
i aid of funds voted him for the pur
! pose by the city council, is doing
! something. The fact that his action
has the approval of the Chamber of
i Commerce does not of itself con
demn it. So far as the threat to
democrary subtly hinted at by Mr.
! Enke goes, it has been my impres
sion that one of the more important
concepts of democracy is majority
| rule.
If I am not mistaken the majority
of Californians do not favor paying
j high taxes to support indigents
j merely for the pleasure of reducing
I the taxes of citizens in other states.
I After all, that would be a little too
altruistic to be probable in this era
of entrenched greed.
