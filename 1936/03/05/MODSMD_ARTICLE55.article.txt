They would never again whisper
"get a horse," and they would al
low the campus police force un
troubled sleep.
But with a wisdom perhaps largely I
instinctive, they will probably con
tinue to play pranks, which, to the
"better" of us, are pitifully conscious
and paihetically inadequate attempts
at "college life." '
For they, whose nocturnal amuse
ments seem so unnecessary, realize
that a good scrap such as Sheriff vs.

Front Steps, will continue as su

True, in skeleton form their gag was j
trite. It has been done for Culver- j
knows-how-long. Only those who
had a hand in the escapade, even
though an objective one, realize j
the infinite number of subtle varia- [
tions that made their latest horse- |
play completely different from all
previous ones, and as such a gag of \
definite verity.
It will be remembered with em

bellishments by all concerned. It
will pass across reunion dinner
tables to roars of laughter twenty
years from now. It will be told to
the kiddies, when and if they come,
as a sacrosanct experience, definite
part of the psycho-chemical com
pound called college life.
The axe, it is true, is chained
down. The Mandolin Club, as much
so as the theatrical road, has been
killed by the safer and less sane
movie. An unassailable bus has re
placed the conveniently assailable
trolley. But the restrictions inherent
in such social and economic prog
ress must not deny us our stupid but
satisfying memories of "them days."
The Sequoians now have a story
to tell—which to them will be the
sweetest story ever told. If we can
not congratulate them, we can at
least express a secret envy.
