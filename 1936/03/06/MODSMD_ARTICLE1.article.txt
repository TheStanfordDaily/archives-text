# Cards, Troy In Title Game Tomorrow
## Light Practice Winds Up Final Preparation For Title Game; New Plays Confront Troy 
### Roger Kimball 
Seeking their first southern divi- !
sion title, Coach John Bunn's In
dian basketecrs will take the Pa
vilion floor against U.S.C. in a one- |
game play-off at 8 o'clock tomor
row night.
By virtue of three victories in four
games with the Trojans this year,
Stanford is a slight favorite. A
strong showing in the conquest of
California contributes to this edge.
Questioned yesterday as to his J
opinion of the game, Bunn re- ;
marked:
''If we play as good defensive ball |
as we did against Cal, and if our j
offense clicks, U.S.C. will never beat J
us."
No Scrimmage Held
Both departments received a final I
polishing in practice yesterday. No j
scrimmage was held, but the first ;
arfd second strings worked out to- j
gether, concentrating on a fast j
break. Shooting practice, from the j
free throw line and elsewhere, also i
received attention.
Bunn has developed new tactics !
this week, especially for the Trojan
game. The team has watched him
diagram them on the blackboard, ;
and then practiced them on the j
floor. Stanford's success will depend |
on how well the boys perform these
plays, designed to overcome Sam i
Barry's system.
