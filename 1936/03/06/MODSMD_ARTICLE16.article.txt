While Mrs. Stanford was fighting |
to rtcure legal control as trustee,
the Vina estate, part of the land left
by Senator Stanford, was plunging
the University into debt at a rate
of $500 a day.

down; the vineyardists couldn't be
paid. They threatened to burn the
buildings, but just in time a paid
up insurance policy was found, the
only one the Senator ever carried.

expected blow, bringing suit for an I
injunction to restrain distribution of
the Stanford estate until a debt of
$15,000,000, borrowed by the Cen

expressed in the letter she wrote
President Jordan toward the end of

"Evciy dollar I can rightfully call
mine is sacredly laid on the altar of
my 'ove for the University, and thus

U.S. Brings Suit <
Toward the end of 1893 the United
States dealt the little school an un
expected blow, bringing suit for an I
injunction to restrain distribution of
the Stanford estate until a debt of
$15,000,000, borrowed by the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad, should mature
and Lc paid. |

Only after the case had been car
ried to the United States Supreme
Court did the government lose ' its
case.
While the state legislature was de
bating the question of creating Stan
ford a legal public institution, Mrs.
Stanford left for London with a col
lection of jewels valued at half a
million, hoping to sell them to world
socialites gathered for Queen Vic
toria's Jubilee.
Jewel Fund Used for Hooks
Failing in this, she gave them to
the Hoard of Trustees in 1905, estab
lishing the Jewel Fund, which has
been exclusively used to purchase
books.
At last Stanford's troubles were
over, tnd by the time of her death,
Mrs. Stanford could be assured that
the University was a triumph for
that steady devotion which is best
expressed in the letter she wrote
President Jordan toward the end of
18%:
"Evciy dollar I can rightfully call
mine is sacredly laid on the altar of
my 'ove for the University, and thus
it shall ever be."
