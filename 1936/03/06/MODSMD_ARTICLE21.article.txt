# 'Big Shots' Say Their Piece In Chaparral
## Famed Big Wig Issue of Funny Mag Sticks Its Nose Out At Eight for Public Approval 
### 
Contrary to general belief which
has regarded the entire matter as a
hoax, the Celebrity Number of
Stanford Chaparral, which goes on
Quad sale at 8 o'clock this morning,
consists throughout of cartoons, ar
ticles, and gags expressly contrib
uted to the comic by well over 20
of America's foremost headline
crashers.
Unique, certainly, in the history of
collage humor magazines, the
March Chappie believes to have
gathered together under one cover
more and better known celebrities
than any other periodical hereto
fore.
Such being so, the Stanford Chap
arral is receiving national recog
nition, reports Old Boy Jimcopp.
There will appear "Echoes from
Woodlake" and "Now That Music,"
written exclusively for This issue by
Joe Thompson, "Stop and Go" edi
tor of Life magazine.
Topping off an edition that is al
ready tops is a cover in modeled
and colo-pholographed clay, de
signed, executed, and staged lay Gil
man Gist.
