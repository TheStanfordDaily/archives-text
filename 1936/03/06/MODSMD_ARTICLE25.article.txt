COMMUNISM. Red-baiters and
r<d-baiters. Every day The Ex
aminer has some story about na
tionul Congressmen iauding the
lli iirst press for exposing radicalism
, nd W.R.'s stand on the question.
Yesterday's Examiner carried on its
front page a story about a debate
in Congress concerning the general
prevalence of "un-Americanism."
Blanton, Democratic representative
from Texas, wanted the reporters for
the Communist newspapers "kicked
out" of the press galleries.
HKAItST IS the leader of the
f(„ which tried to prevent the Co
lumbia Broadcasting System from
putting Earl Browder on yesterday.
J'ti pn-sentative Curley of New York
: aid, "As long as there is a Hearst
py| • r printed, Communism will
re vct el. a foothold in this country."
'illl! AMERICAN LEGION passes
all oils of resolutions — each post
vi rages two-a-day — condemning
"red schemers," etc., etc.
The membership of the Com
munist Party is so piteously small
that it is hard to see how anyone
g«'ts worked up over the idea.
However, one way to certainly in
crease that faction's membership
and its strength is to give it so
.inn h l üblieity—good or bad.
IM THIS land of freedom and
quality, why shouldn't a man be a
Communist if he wants to? Why
In iliJn't his papers have access to
:v press galleries of Congress?
Any man can be a Republican, if
I;e < desires. Or a Presbyterian, or
, Farmer-Laborite, or a Catholic.
h re is no justice or "life, liberty,
.nd the pursuit of happiness" for a
urn who sincerely believes in the
acilines of Marx not being able to
r; ach those doctrines, or believe
um, or print them.
THE COLUMBIA Broadcasting
y,stem's action in letting the Com
'.unist party present its views yes
•rday is no more damnable than
ie company's letting the Republic
is or the Democrats or the Social
it use their facilities for the same
LU pOS*.
A thinking man cannot imagine
uyone being less competent than
ie Democrats or the Republicans
i unning the government.
IN COLONIAL DAYS it was in
ariably the sect that had been most

vociferous in its cries for religious
equality that was the first to evict
anyone falling away from the com
mon beliefs. The Puritans were
ready to throw anyone out of their
colony who didn't completely con
form to Puritanism. Yet they had
come to this country seeking re
ligious freedom.
II all depends on your point of
view.

HEARST CAN hardly be blamed
for his war on Communism, for he
and his properties would be wiped
out. Everything that he represents
and believes would fall.
But he should be aware of the
fact that the Communists do not
present the threat to government,
as we know it, that he believes
they present.
Jesus Christ had plans for hu
manity. Were even such ideas of
his as cancellation of debts every
seven years, or outlawing of inter
est on capital adopted in the U.S.,
Hearst and his press would scream:
"UNAMERICAN! COMMUNISM!"
ADIOS. And remember that there
are many virtues in life, but the
greatest of these is TOLERANCE.
The Javanese drama consists ex
clusively of episodes from the Hin
du epics, the "Mahabharata" and the
"Ramayana," and the Banji cycle of
semi-historical legends of Java.
