# Councils Urge Respect For Code During Finals
## 
### 
With two student-faculty panels ;
i on their joint Honor Code inquiry '
| scheduled for early next quarter,
j officials of Men's and Women's |
Councils yesterday emphasized im- ;
portance of respecting the Code
in the approaching final examina- ,
tions.
Code Criticized
j "Recently there has been a great
dea' of criticism of the Honor Sys
tem," Gib Holloway, Men's' Council
i chairman, asserted. "Some people j
! believe that the Code is on the wane I
| at Stanford. I am not of that opin- I
I ion.
"If students really believe in the
1 Code and if they want to retain it j
| in preference to the proctor system, j
i they can best indicate their feeling
| by displaying honorable conduct
i during the coming examinatiois," j
j Holloway said.
Two Panels Planned
The two panels are tentatively |
I planned for the first two weeks of j
spring quarter. Only professors j
I and student executives will attend
the first meeting, at which definite j
arrangements will be made for the
second. The latter discussion will j
! be open to all students.
Council officials have received ;
assurance of full cooperation from
1 the faculty in handling violations
of the Honor Code. Department
heads will codify the system's prin
• ciples so that they may have an
accurate plan on which to base re
commendation to the councils.
Campaign Two Weeks Old
The campaign for clarification and
! strengthening of the Code was begun
| two weeks ago when the two organ- j
1 izations met in joint session at the
request of Pat Flavel, chairman of j
| Women's Council.
