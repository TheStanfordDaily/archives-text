# English Club Recommends Prize Stories
## 
### 
Special recommendation to
Story Magazine's $100 and $50
prize contest as well as a chance
at the $25 bounty given by the
English Club yearbook is the re
ward of the two best prose stories
submitted in the yearbook compe
tition, according to Hal Evarts,
yearbook editor.

Since each college is allowed to
submit only two entries to the
magazine contest, no stories are
eligible unless first turned in to
the yearbook.
Among the judges obtained to
rate the manuscripts are Joseph
Henry Jackson and Max Miller,
author of "I Cover the Water
front."

The ordnance department of the
U.S. army spent nearly half as much
money in 1917-ISJIB, us the entire
American government had spent
since its beginning in 177 G.
