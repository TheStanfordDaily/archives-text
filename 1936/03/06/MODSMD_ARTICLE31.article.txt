'32 and John McClelland '36 have
doped out the "dating" situation
from the masculine point of view.
Now the time has come for the
"1100" to raise its voice in its own
defense.
Right is their analysis of the situ
ation B.F. (Before the Flood). The
Stanford man's defense mechanism
went into action after he had been
turned down a couple of times by
the girl he wanted to date. He
salved his wounded ego by saying,
"Stanford women are dopes any
way. I'll get a good date from Mills
for the Masque Ball."
Right is their conclusion that the
dating situation is more normal now
the feminine population on the
"Farm" numbers 1100." Right is
today's observation that some wom
en chase the campus "big shots."
* * *
Now lot the men take a good
square look *he mirror them
selves. There is Species I, the sup
posedly intelligent man-aboui im—
pus, who calls up Roble for a >-
date with any pretty face. Speci
11, the unkempt dub who fancies
himself, insists on pestering the
popular girl at the jolly-up and
leaves nice but plain Amanda lean
ing against the wall.
Obnoxious is Species 111, who is
turned down time after time, but
won't take "no" for an answer.
Species IV considers himself a "big
shot" and does not deign to look at
anyone not included in a clique of
some fifteen or twenty attractive
girls.

In the end it all boils down to the
pot calling the kettle black!
