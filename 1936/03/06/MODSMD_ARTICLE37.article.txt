# Minutes That Made History
## 
### 
Today there are 1100 women at
| Stanford. A few years ago there
i were only 500, but for five tense
minutes back in 1905 it looked like
there would be no women at all.
Mrs. Stanford was resigning as j
I active head of the University; she |
j had her resignation ready for the

Board of Trustees. Only one thing [
bothered her—the women.
Reports that "a number of men j
and women students have been seen |
promenading upon the walks and |
drives of the campus in the late I
evening hours" had reached her. J
Maybe co-education wasn't such a

| I
j good thing.
Disturbed by the reports, half I
hesitant, Mrs. Stanford stood ]
thinking. Alarmed, Judge George
Crothers, one of the trustees, asked >
for a five-minute recess.
For five minutes, the fate of thou- ,
i sands of Stanford women-to-come
! hung by a thread. Judge Crothers
| pled with the aging woman, told
| her that her fears were unfounded,
j She and the judge returned to the
| meeting.
Mrs. Stanford had made up her
i mind. She stood before the trustees
J and solemnly read her resignation—
with no changes.
