TIE GAME

When the seniors played the frosh,
Tuesday, they were definitely off
form and were lucky to tie the score
in the last second of play. Trailing
throughout the game, they rallied in
the final period until they were but
one point behind. Then, just as the
whistle blew, Ruth Schmidt looped
a free shot through the basket to
tie the score at 23 all. The frosh
have improved noticeably but their
of stature is still a pretty
big handicap.
Today's game and two next week
wind up the final round of the
tournament. The frosh and sophs
meet Monday and the juniors and
seniors play Tuesday. All games
are played in the Women's Gym
and start promptly at 4:20 o'clock.
