# SINCERE SUGGESTIONS
## 
### 
The Euilor, Sir:
Mr. McClellandâ€”Possibly it would
please you to know that we are
considering starting a petition to the
Union Board of Governors in which
we would ask them to redecorate
the entire premises of the Union
! Cell: jr in old rose and cream blue,
| and add dim lights, hot music, and
; highballs; vivacious blonde host
j esses to greet you with that "Pep
; sod >nt smile" and muscular tone ac
quired I y strict indulgence in the
| seven-day course of Bernard Mc
| Fadden.
Finally, we hyve decided to ask
( to have all the inmates of Agnew
1 over for cokes at 10 o'clock, in or
l der to create an atmosphere which
j will be more pleasing to the whims
of a potential editor.
We hope these suggestions meet
with your approval, and if you have
any more constructive criticisms to
offer, we are sure they will be ap
preciated by all concerned.
