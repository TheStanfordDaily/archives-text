# NO. NOT CHILDISH

The Editor, Sir:
Just load the editorial and see its
reformatory ideas on how to run Se
suoia Hall! Since when have such
pranks as taking a horse upstairs
been considered childish around this
campus? It takes men to do that, at
least to bring them down again (as

' Officer Burns will testify).
If the horse gag was so old-fash
ioned, didn't the tractor on the steps
I lend a modern touch to the affair?
Besides, a stunt doesn't have to be
original to be interesting; witness
the Pajamarino and mud light.
I If this is the way we choose to
! amuse ourselves, why should others
(with the exception of the "powers
that be") concern themselves with
I our actions?
