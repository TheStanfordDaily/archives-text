# A 						RIGHT STEP

The Editor, Sir:
Your publishing the Daily Kansan
editorial on "'The Date Bureau" is a
step in the right direction. I hope it
means that you have recognized the
existence of such a problem on the
Stanford campus.
The trouble here is not only that
many students have difficulty in get
ting acquainted, but that, once ac
quainted, there is very little for
them to do together.
With the Date Bureau must go,
on :he Stanford campus, a realiza
tion that friendship and enjoyment
are r>':t necessarily confined to the
dance floor or show.
A Dale Bureau that works both
ways, and better facilities for
friendships based on common activ
ities and interests, could improve
Stanford greatly.
