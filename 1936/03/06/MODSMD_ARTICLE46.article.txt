# Indian Five Out For Olympics
## Win Over S.C. Gives Stanford Cagers Bid for Pacific Coast Semifinals in Washington 
### 
A trip to the Olympic Games may
be the final reward for Stanford
hoopsters, it they beat U.S.C. to
morrow night. Even a less to the
Trojans would still leave a chance,
; though the trail would be more
rocky.
For basketball players this year,
that path to Berlin goes through
Seattle and New York. By winning
| the southern division crown, the
Indians could automatically enter
; the Pacific Coast semifinals in the
former city, March 25 and 2G. The
result of their playoff series with
' the champions of the northern sec
tion would have no effect on this.
If John Bunn's men lose to U.S.C.,
j they could still enter the Seattle
i tournament, though indirectly. They
i would compete with numerous oth
i er college teams in their own Pa-
I vilion on March 13 and 14 to detcr
! mine the champion of the State of
California, regardless of the Con-
I ference.
The winning team j.l Seattle will
be one of eight in the national play-
I off at Now York, April 5, G, and 7.
Five college outfits, two A.A.U.
quintets, and a Y.M.C.A. team will
fight it out in the big town, stealing
| the show from track and baseball.
i Chosen from this competition will
I be the 14 men to play basketball for
; the United States at Berlin in Au
-1 gust. Not more than eight will be
picked from the winning team at
New York, and not more than six
; from the runner-up.
Dr. Baine of the, University of
Miami asserts tV.nt "college nv re
member little of what they learn in
' the textbooks and more from the
i acquired intellectual interests and
! human sympathies developed dur
j ing the four years of college."â€”
