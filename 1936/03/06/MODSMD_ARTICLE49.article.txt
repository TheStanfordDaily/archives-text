! COACH JOHN BI'NN
TEAM'S SIXTH MAN -

Mr. John Bunn, the basketball i
[ coach, does not come in for a great
deal of praise when the newspaper
! columnists and sideline scowlers
| start enumerating the points on why
j Stanford won."
It always the great individual
i work of one of his players that gets
the picture taken, or the headline, or
i the t'itp-on-haek.
Now there may have been some I
! hair-line reason for this hack in [
| the darker ages of Bunn's coaching j
! here, when he had little or no mate- j
I rial to work with.
Hut now that he has the niate
' rial, and has shaped it into a
championship unit, he does de- .
i serve the credit of being its direct- j
ing Jorce, its guiding hand.
I He has taken the material and j
j built or;e of the smoothest offensive j
, fives seen on this coast within mom
' ory. It is in no way a one-man team,
l but a team that goes out and works
i Bunn's plays like one man — the
! clean, {Cansas type of bail.
I And besides, John is sort of a
! "mental mentor." His almost lath- i
| erly «ye to the welfare of his team,
i never "going out to win regardless." |

one iij.e fellow and a great coach.
