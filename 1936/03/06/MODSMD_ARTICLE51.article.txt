# Kappa Sigs To Play Hoop Final
## 
### 
LAST NIGHT'S RESULT
Kappa Sig I 42. Theta Chi I IS
TOMORROW NIGHT'S GAME
Pavilion: p.m., Breakers I
vs. Kappa Sig I.
Breakers' basketball team may be
defending university champs, look
good, and all that, but they haven't
yon this year's title yet.
, r hey meet Kappa Sig in the finals
tomorrow night as a preliminary
game to the varsity-Trojan tilt, and
from the looks of Kappa Sig's play
last mght trimming a good Theta
Chi quintet, it is still anybody's
ball grme.
Both teams have literally plas
tered all opponents in both league
competition and championship play
offs, and the two styles of j/U'y «;ve
similar—ball hawking, slow break
with careful passing, and scoring by
the gents elected to that purpose.
These gents in question are Rog
Munger of Breakers, and Bernie
Layer and Verne Johnson of Kappa
Sig, til of whom will be on John
Bunn's rushing list next year, or we
miss our guess.
The competitors are warned that
they, too, are presenting tickets to
their game.
Last night's summary: Kappa Sig:
Layer 15, Acker 9, Dewar 3, Rus
sell, McMillan, Johnson 12. Theta
Chi: Slusser 1, Gill, Bush 1, Trom
pas 14, Miner 2, Hanzlik.
