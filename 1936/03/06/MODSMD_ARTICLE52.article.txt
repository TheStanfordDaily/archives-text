# Mermen Battle Cal Tomorrow
## Indians To Compete in Athens Club Meet with Northern California Crown at Stake 
### Hunter Hendee 
Biggest obstacle in Stanford's way
to a Northern California swimming
team championship tomorrow is a
pack of those Berkeley Bears that
have a habit of making the going
tou.;h for the Indians.
Cal didn't show up so well in the
two Pacific Association contests this
last month because those meets
didn 4 include the events in which
she has her strength. At the Athens
Club tomorrow all the Bears will be
out there, and they will be strong
contenders for team championship.
Bob Walker, Stanford's newly
crowned king of the P.A. 15Q-yard
backstroke, has a fast race ahead of
him when he meets Roy Siem of the
Bears. Athens Club's Corson, how
ever, may give them both a surprise.
Bieaststroke swimmer Jim Wer
son and the medley relay team prac
tically guarantee California of two
first places, and Danny Kuhn, diver,
is almost sure to figure high.
Stanford's best chances seem to
rest with her 400-yard free-style re
lay team that set a new P.A. record
last week, and Jack Vibert in the
220.
