## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" Co-operation Through Criticism Building Champions Has Taken 8 Years; Building Men Is Right Down His Alley

It's taken eight years, hid tomorrow night
Coach John Bunn sends his Indian basketball
team into a game where victory will mean a
southern division championship.
Eight years of building, alumni sports
writers have been hinting lor about seven
years, is too long. There should have been
other championship teams in that time, in
timate the scribes.
Hid even in this year of triumph, or poten
tial triumph, "Genial John" has not even
been graced with an "it's-about-tiine" atti
tude. All season the public prints have made
much of Stanford's material, undeniably first
class. And they've made very little of the
coaching that has been required to bring a
green team into championship calibre.
Despite frequent claims to the contrary,
Stanford does not have a one-man team. And
the team-work that has marked the Indians'
smooth lloor and passing game results from
long hours of training and much thought on
the part of the team's coach.
True, there have been seven years of not
loo-successful basketball seasons. Hut in that
time, there have been few charges of ditry
playing, few pokes at unethical tactics, and
110 claims thai Stanford played a victory-at
any-cost type of ball.
John Bunn, Builder of Men, tomorrow
night may become a Builder of Champions.
If so, the odds are against his being acclaimed
as such.
