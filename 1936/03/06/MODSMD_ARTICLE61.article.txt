# Calendar Sneaks Up On Eight Profs This Year
## 
### 
Another school year soon will be closing,
and the inexorable hands of the time clock
will tick over, placing on the emeritus list
at the end of this quarter, eight more of Stan
lord's distinguished faculty.
To the faculty members, the emeritus list
ing means more time for desirable activities,
less hashing over of class-room facts. Certain
it is that the retirement age is far more pain
ful to the worker, who has only a specialized
skill to account for his (if) years, than to the
scholar, who has something of a specialized
mind to keep him company.
For the students, though, Ibis chronologi
cal distinction means that they will lose, after
this quarter, the valuable class-room contact.
Students should remember nexl week when
they JirP making out their programs for next
quarter that this is the last chance they will
have for taking course's-from Professor R. \V.

in Insects and Disease, Bev. Dr. D. Charles
