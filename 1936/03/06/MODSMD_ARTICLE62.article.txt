## Five Beers for the Board

(From the Brown Daily Herald)
Fred B. Perkins, coach A the Brown debating team,
and three Brown professors in talks before an insti
tute on "Alcohol and Modern Life" yesterday advo
cated the elimination of alcohol in the modern machine
age as the solution of the liquor problem.
There can be no quarrel with those who feel that
the dry position is the best for themselves as individ
uals. Nor can we quarrel with those idealists who
attempt to make their practice a universal creed—
provided they do not go back to the Prohibition policy
of legal restriction of individual taste. However, it
must be admitted that i less rockbound creed .seems
to us a pleasanter and more practical position.

The speakers last night emphasized the loss of
physical efficiency resulting from four teaspoonfuls of
alcohol; they stated that common sense and alcohol
cannot be mixed. All would admit that for the top
flight, athlete this loss of efficiency is tremendously
important.
Indeed, during a long session of brain work liquor
is out of place. But for the ordinary mortal, in his off
moments, the cult of physical efficiency need not
restrain a man from a pleasant eveping in which mod
erate drinking plays a part.

Important as it is, physical efficiency is not the
be-all and end-all of life. The man who dies in old
age, still physically the top, may or may not have had
a rich career. Indeed, the attitude of the worthy
speakers last night seems to us to hare a faint resem
blance to the hypochondriac's fear of drafts.
The moderate use of liquor, especially the use of
wine and beer, is associated in many countries with
some of the most friendly and engaging of the local
customs. Indeed, it is hard to imagine French life
without the "vin du nays," and Munich hospitality
without a foaming stein of beer.
To us these pleasures seem well worth the trifling
loss of physical efficiency. To most mortals, we feel,
they offer a pleasant ind, in the last analysis, a more
"common sense" alternative to excessive drinking
than does the unbending dry credo.
