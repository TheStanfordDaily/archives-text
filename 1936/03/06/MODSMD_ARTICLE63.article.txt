The title of a new movie could be "Through Dark
est Stanford," with not Frank Buck, but with George
Burns. Mr. Burns is campus nightwatchman, and he
prowls around the Quad in the dark of night with a
gun in hand. His duty is to shoot owls that perch
under the roofs, and the right he has to deny the owls
their right to live is chiefly chemical.

Marksmanship has been shown also by none other
than Bill Ellington, assistant track coach. Ellington
gets up early in the morning and picks off the black
birds by the B.A.C. building, with a rifle.
"We haven't any proof against the blackbirds," says
Mr. Ellington, "but it seems that they are pretty mad
about the B.A.C.'s cutting the birdseed budget."
There has been a correlation between the return
of sun-tanning on the campus to the altitude at which
airplanes fly. There is the matter of jail and a fine
for flying low over buildings, but the aviators are said
to be trying to brush a couple of Kappa Sigs off
their roof and over onto the Kappa sun porch. Of
course, the aviators have no other interest in this.
The fraternity roofs look like a Cecil B. DeMille
extra vanganza of ancient something or other, or may
be it's just the influence )f the art. work in last year's
Quad.
This sun-bathing business has completely demoral
ized the Tri-Delt feeding force. It seems that the Tri-
Delt kitchen is next to the Pi Phi house, and the
Pi Phis like to take sun baths. Things got so bad that
the Tri-Delts weren't getting any food last week. After
lunch had been delayed until 12:40 the other day,
the Tri-Delts finally phoned the Pi Phis to "get off the
air," and finally the hashers returned to normalcy.
