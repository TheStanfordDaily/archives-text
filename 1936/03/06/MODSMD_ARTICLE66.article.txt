## HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED 
### 
Back in '152 when the prolific Abe
Mcllinkoff signed his name to this
column, there appeared this state
ment:
"Why do Stanford women have the
reputation of being the least ITish

women in captiv
ity or out? The
answer is simple
when wc consid
er who it is that,
gives the women
their reputation
for beauty or
anything else. It's
th e m en, of

course. llow do men judge pulchri
tude? By the actual comeliness of
the co-eds? By certain abstract
standards of feminine beauty? Not
at all. The gauge of loveliness is the
facility in getting dates."

Farm women were tough to date
in those days. There were only 50?
of them, and because of the law of
accessibility—if there is such i law
—the presentable ones were an much I
in demand as ice cream bars at a j
May afternoon track mjet. Thus,
the odds were against you every
time you took down the phone re
ceiver.

Then came the reformation. And j
where before one woman stood de
fiantly facing the multitude of men, j
another appeared beside her smil
ing come hitheringly. The old guard
sat back in bewilderment while the
newcomers scrambled over them in j
the race for popularity.

j Now do Stanford women have a
reputation for lacking ITishness?
No. Do the men judge their pul
chritudinous classmates by actual
: comeliness? Absolutely. And are
I the odds overwhelmingly against
you when you trod phoneward with
a date in mind? Not at all. The old
order changeth, and the new order
bringeth normality.

Certain highly interesting phe
nomena, however, came in with the
order and furnish unending amuse
ment to the male contingent. For
i example, so great was the shift of
' odds from the women's favor that
now they can almost be said to stand
on the men's side. Some claim that
the men can even sit back and let
feminity be aggressive, and, judg
ing from external characteristics of
i the escorts with whom some of the
reputedly "popular" women are
seen, the claim seems justified.

Then there is the "political" aspect.
The latter half of the 1100 are an
ambitious lot. Their ego and eag
erness to make a name for them- |
selves leads (hern to campaign for
! the bigger shots in a manner which
just borders on the verge of the ob
vious. And it's a well known fact
that certain groups of young ladies
have a code which consists of: Get
, taken anywhere you can be seen—
. preferably with well known or popu
j lar men—but above all, get taken
out.

Yes, indeed, times have changed.
It's tough on the women who aren't
endowed by nature with the kind of
drawing power that beckons to
males from clear on the other side
of the Quad, but it's easy on the men
who in the old days would never
have had a chance.

No. Do the men judge their pul

on the men's side. Some claim that

Yes, indeed, times have changed.
It's tough on the women who aren't

"Why do Stanford women have the

women in captiv

answer is simple

their reputation
for beauty or

th e m en, of

course. llow do men judge pulchri
tude? By the actual comeliness of
the co-eds? By certain abstract

in those days. There were only 50?
