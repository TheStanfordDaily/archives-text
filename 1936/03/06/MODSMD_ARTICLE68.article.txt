The Editor, Sir:
"Let the winds of freedom blow"
i is an excellent motto, but when
horses are found on Ihe second floor,
I it's getting a bit drafty, eh?
you're right. Perhaps all
! the p.'rls should wear middies, and
j we should march to and from
classes four abreast. Perhaps we
i should do away with football and
j turn Ihe stadium into a sea garden.
Maybe we should eliminate ihe
| cheering at basketball games and
! rewaid the players by putting pretty
little gold stars after their names.
College is no longer college. There
I is no longer a place for the rough
stuff that has made college days
j pleasant for many generations. Sure,
i these are days for modern ideas, but
let us remind you, dear editor, that
even the roughs realized that. They
could only get a tractor up as far as
j the front door, however.
Yes, the "axe is anchored by cold
steel to the floor of a soda foun
tain, safe from Berkeley shop lift
ers," but don't forget, dear chil
| dren, that it was the Sequoia Rough
who put it there!
Yours for a Laff
