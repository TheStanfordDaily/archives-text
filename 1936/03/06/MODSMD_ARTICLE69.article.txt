# AN IDEA

i The Editor, Sir:
I If some of the profs are dry and
; don't get their stuff across it's be
j cause the students are apathetic and
don't tcke an interest in the pre
-1 sentation of their courses. To rem
edy this, each department might
hold a ballot at the end of the quar
ter so students could indicate what
'.hey thought of the course and if
they felt they had learned any-
I thing. Profs are experienced enough

so that they could weed out the
constructive criticism. Their courses
wouid 4 hen become living instruc
tion, amended from year to year as
need arose.
