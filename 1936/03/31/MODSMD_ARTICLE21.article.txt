# $35,000 Gift Received For Ampitheater
## Howard Frost Gives Fund For Building, Grounds As Memorial for Son 
### 
Announcement of a $35,000 gift to
the University, which will be applied
on the cost of construction and tree
planting for the outdoor auditorium,
was made last night by Comptroller
Almon E. Roth.
Mr. Howard Frost, of Los Angeles,
granted the money in commemora
tion of his son, John Lawrence
Frost, member of the Class of '35,
who died in Italy while enrolled as a
student.
The yift was Mr. Frost's second to
Stanford. Last November he found
ed the John Lawrence Frost Loan
Fund nlacing at the University's
disposal property in Los Angeles
valued at $25,000.
Construction To licgin
Major construction of the amphi
theater will begin as soon as plans
have been completed for landscaping
the project, Roth asserted. At pres
ent workmen are building up the
stage end of the auditorium with
excavations from the railroad under
pass on the Embarcadero.
The outdoor pavilion will be lo
cated between Galvez and Lasuen
Streets, near the new theater, sur
rounded by a forest of native trees
which will be planted on and around
walls of earth surrounding the bowl.
Paths will be made from the streets
to sloping steps at the east end to
the general entrance.
Seating accommodations will be
made for approximately 7500 per
sons in the bowl. The stage, which
will have a lawn for flooring and a
semicircular, wooded embankment
for a background, will probably be
large enough to seat an entire class
for commencement exercises, Roth
said.
Location Advantages
"The proximity of the outdoor
auditorium to the new theater will
make its location especially advan
tageous," the comptroller pointed
out. "The theater dressing rooms
may be used by performers in either
place.
"We deeply appreciate Mr. Frost's
gift, particularly because we can put
it to a lasting use. With an open air
bowl and a complete theater located
in the same block practically in the
center of the campus, Stanford
should become widely recognized as
a center of drama and architectural
art," Roth declared.
