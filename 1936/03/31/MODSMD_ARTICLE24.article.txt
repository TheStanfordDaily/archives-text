# World Activities Cram Press During Vacation

### Bob Eisenbach 
Il s a far cry from Carmel's well
lit sands and not so well-lit bars to
the spine-chilling cries of Europe's
war-birds, the roar of flood-waters,
the yammering of politicians and
the monotone of court-clerks.
But in three weeks of academic
cramming and one of unacademic
comfort, the cacophony of world
news-makers rose to a roar heard
even by those who shy from papers
and news broadcasts.
Tlie best, bit in the journalistic
stew was also the biggest bit, a
flood in which 200 wore believed
dead, 300.000 homeless, by hectic
newshawks who viewed devastation
in about five eastern states. F.D.R.,
trapped between an election and an
army of relief woikers waiting for
relief, at lfist had a God-tailored rea
son for federal appropriations. His
flood hirelings may aid at the polls
next November by slush
in March. Meanwhile, the nation is
stunned at an event meteorologists
predicted three months ago.
Lamson May («o Free
Dave Lamson. whom hysterical
female court addicts call the "stone

[ face" because he didn't get hysterical
during his third trial for the murder
of his wife, Allene. is fairly sure to
be freed April 3. Thirty of thirty
six Santa Clarans believe him guilty.
The culmination of his third trial in
disagreement will clear Lamson not
because the state believes him in
nocent, but because trial expenses
are trial expenses.
Europe's cannoneers have been
loading and polishing guns ever
since Versailles. They almost fired
them recently when Germany used
the Locarno pact for scratch paper,
marched troops onto the blood-sea- :
soiled banks of the Rhine, threw
politicians into a talkative dither.
The guns remained quiet, the coun- j
cil halls remained noisy when Hitler
pointed out that moving his troops
was no more a violation of the pact
than the Franco-Russian mutual as
sistance alliance. The World Court
is to ponder.
Tale of Hoffman
Jockeying desperately between a
German electorate and the nation's"
demand lor justice, N°w Jersey's
Governor Hoffman last week said !'
"yes, and again no" on the question j;
of Bruno's reprieve, spiced his ob- 1
vious confusion with reports of a
new confusion that would, or
wouldn't clear the Bronx carpenter
whom the state declares has Lind
bergh blood on his hands.
Townscnd, fair-headed boy of a
generation, had his hair mussed by
a gleeful Senate when his crusad
ing pensioneer was found to be quite
liberally pensioned himself, and old
enough to be quiet about it. One
million a year is the organization's
take, an investigating committee
found. Meanwhile, Republicans old
and new continued to beef at Roose- (
velt, and Roosevelt continued to
laugh, v/hile the world laughed at or
wilh him, depending on observers'
viewpoints.
"Be Good, Tlagood!''
General Johnson Hagood, dubbed
by many a martyr to administrative
mercilessness, was out of uniform
as a result of saying "WPA money
is stage money." He has shown ir- ,
responsibility in the past as well, ac- i
cording to his chief, Major General
Malin Craig. Roosevelt agreed, but
may reinstate the ousted soldier.
To do our bit for him, we will dis- [
miss California School Head Vier
ling Kersey and his amazing marital
(angle with a line. To do our bit
for you if you haven't already
messed this page with Union coffee,
we won't even speak about Miss
