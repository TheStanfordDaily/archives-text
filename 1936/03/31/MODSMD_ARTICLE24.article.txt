# World Activities Cram Press During Vacation

Il s a far cry from Carmel's well
lit sands and not so well-lit bars to
the spine-chilling cries of Europe's
war-birds, the roar of flood-waters,
the yammering of politicians and
the monotone of court-clerks.
But in three weeks of academic
cramming and one of unacademic
comfort, the cacophony of world
news-makers rose to a roar heard
even by those who shy from papers
and news broadcasts.
Tlie best, bit in the journalistic
stew was also the biggest bit, a
flood in which 200 wore believed
dead, 300.000 homeless, by hectic
newshawks who viewed devastation
in about five eastern states. F.D.R.,
trapped between an election and an
army of relief woikers waiting for
relief, at lfist had a God-tailored rea
son for federal appropriations. His
flood hirelings may aid at the polls
next November by slush
in March. Meanwhile, the nation is
stunned at an event meteorologists
predicted three months ago.

Dave Lamson. whom hysterical
female court addicts call the "stone

[ face" because he didn't get hysterical
during his third trial for the murder
of his wife, Allene. is fairly sure to
be freed April 3. Thirty of thirty
six Santa Clarans believe him guilty.
The culmination of his third trial in
disagreement will clear Lamson not
because the state believes him in
nocent, but because trial expenses
are trial expenses.
Europe's cannoneers have been
loading and polishing guns ever
since Versailles. They almost fired
them recently when Germany used
the Locarno pact for scratch paper,
marched troops onto the blood-sea- :
soiled banks of the Rhine, threw
politicians into a talkative dither.
The guns remained quiet, the coun- j
cil halls remained noisy when Hitler
pointed out that moving his troops
was no more a violation of the pact
than the Franco-Russian mutual as
sistance alliance. The World Court
is to ponder.
