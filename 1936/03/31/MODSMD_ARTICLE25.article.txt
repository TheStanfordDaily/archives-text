# New Division Will Place Emphasis On Industrial Problems
## Division Formed in Business School by Donations of Industrialists 
### 
Dean J. Hugh Jackson of the
Graduate School of Business an
nounced yesterday the formation of
a new Division of Industrial Rela
tions in tlie business school, begin
ning next September, by act of the
Board of Trustees in their meeting
March 19.
"The purpose of the new divi
sion,'' said Dean Jackson, "is the
bringing about, in the very broadest
sense, of a better understanding of
employer and employee relation
ships."
Industrialists Finance
The department, which has been
made possible by the gifts of leading
industrialists of the Pacific coast and
the nation, will be quite similar to
the Industrial Relations Section at
Princeton University, Dr. Jackson
asserted. It will be the only univer
sity department of its type west of
the Mississippi.
Said Charles N. Reynolds, profes
sor of sociology, concerning this in
novation:
"There is a great need for this
sort of tiling at present. An organi
zation such as this which will inves
tigate impartially the employer-em
ployee problem, regardless of where
the information may lead, will cer
tainly be a great benefit to our social
system."
To Compile Reports
According to Dean Jackson, the
Division will assemble at Stanford
the publications and reports of busi
ness organizations throughout the
United States concerning industrial
relations and social security. A spe
cial library will be established
where such materials will be avail
able not only to the faculty and stu
dents of the University, but also to
industry throughout the Pacific
Coast.
Special research will be developed
in such subjects as industrial pen
sions, group insurance, employee
stock ownership and savings plans,
age limitations, social security legis
lation, unemployment insurance
plans, group relations, and hours,
wages, and conditions of employ
ment, with publication from time
to time of results of this research,
Dean Jackson stated.
Courses in social security and in
dustrial relations will be offered for
ail interested students of the Uni
versity as well as for the students of
the Graduate School of Business.
