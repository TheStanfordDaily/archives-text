HELLO. Hitler and the floods
have viefl for headline supremacy j
during vacation. Hitler is no swim
mer; consequently, the floods have ;
outdone him on the front pages.
Ask any man which is more j
destructive, fire or water. If lie
doesn't stop to think, he'll say fire.
II he does stop to think, he'll say
water.
Ever since Noah outwitted the i
world's first flood, water, along with
war, fire, and automobiles, has made
quite a name for itself as one of j
history's greatest "killers."

HIE MOST DISASTROUS flood
in the United States was the famous j
Johti iiown flood of 1889. Johnstown ,
lie, on level ground at the junction '
(.1 tin' Little Conemaugh and the |
Stony Creek rivers which join to 1
Minn ilie Conemaugh River. Eightyj
mil* < ast of Pittsburgh in the i
onthwestern portion of Pennsyl- j
.*:iiiiii, Johnstown is almost enclosed i
by high precipitous hills.
After torrential and unprece
dented rains late in May of the
iatcful year, a 117-year-old dam
across the South Fork River high
iit Johnstown's surrounding hills |
! ' miles from the town gave way i
-.ml unleashed a lake two and a 1
lia'f miles long and a mile and a
•i ll wide which swept down into
lie valley, inundating Johnstown '
ind seven other towns in the j
one naugh Valley.
The 700 acres of water 50 feet j
i . rolled down into the valley as :
. wall 20 feet high at the rate of 20 j
i)es an hour, and within an hour j
ter the dam's collapse, Johnstown
is almost completely destroyed
d the other towns were entirely
iped out.

HIE PENNSYLVANIA Railroad
i id' " withstood the force of the
it' r and the debris piled against it
' the, water formed a mass of
v '. ckiige on which many people
■re saved from drowning only to
burned to death when it caught
later in the clay. Out of Johns
an \ 188!) population 30.000, some
)() people were lost.
A cemetery overlooking Johns
nvn has a large plot containing
7!) unmarked graves containing
odies that none of the survivors
mild identify.
Relief was given to the survivors
1 rough a $4,000,000 fund raised by
nation-wide subscription. An old
i nor tells the story of a locomotive
Idly blowing its whistle as it raced
(' wn the hillside ahead of the wall
water. The screeching whistle
irned the inhabitants as they
itched what seemed to be a great
>ud of dust rolling toward them,
le identity of the heroes who
mded the warning as they stood in
2 cab of that frantic locomotive
is never known, for the raging
iter overtook the engine and no
i ice of it was ever found.

IHE RECENT FLOODS have
I : unpted flood control plans and
t week army engineers handed
.tigress a $.'500,000,000 flood-pre
ntion scheme.
f the plan is not immediately ef
•11 d, the engineers said, the life

i ■ ure will dwarf the sum total of
previous damage in the United
Sates.

WONDER HOW LONG that dike
; ilding Lagunita out of Roble and
I' tniita Court boudoirs will last
the rain keeps up and the outlet
louid become plugged.
Also to wonder — the amount of
• aniage the Quad would know if
oarsville Dam broke one of these
ne wet days.

ONE OF AMERICA'S greatest
ood calamities occurred when the
an Francisquito Dam broke and
wept through the Santa Paula Val
•y in 1928. The waters covered long
ik's of automobiles driving along
he highways, ruined farms and
it''us orchards, and killed hundreds
i f people.
Hut nothing before or since in the
'Jiiitod States has ever rivaled the
ild "Johnstown Flood."
