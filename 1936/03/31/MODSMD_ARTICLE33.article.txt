# New Rushing Rules Await Approval Of Row Councilmen
## Ed Littlefield Followed By Tom Boothe as Head Of Fraternity Board 
### 
After many unsuccessful attempts
to devise a set of rushing rules sat
isfactory to both the Interfraternity
Board and Dr. Wilbur, a plan has
been accepted by both parties, and
remains only to be approved by the
Interfraternity Council to become
officially Stanford's new rushing
rules.
Pending approval by the Council,
the only features of this plan which
are available are the following three
main points: first—rushing will take
place only on week-ends; second—
formal pledging will take place the
second week of winter quarter;
j third—the success of the new plan
| will depend on a "gentleman's
| agreefcnent" between the houses.
Interfraternity Council elected
Bob Hoover, Phi Delt, as president,
and Joe Clark, Sigma Nu, as sec
retary-treasurer for the next school
| year.
However, as Ed LittlMield, pres
j ent president of the council, has
i graduated, Hoover has taken over
j the duties of his office immediately.
Tom Boothe, Delt. has replaced Lit
j tlefield as chairman ol the Interfra-
I ternity Board.
