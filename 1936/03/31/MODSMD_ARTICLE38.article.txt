funds" of the organization.

plan of robbery," the elderly Long
Beach, Calif., physician told the
Evening Sun.
"There have been small pecula
tions by some of our workers. It
was inevitable.
"Some of these workers were out
on commission-—that's the only way
we could deal with them—and when
the commissions sometimes were
not enough lor them to eat on or
live on, they dipped into the main
funds.
"But it was not inherent dishon
esty—simply necessity."

started without funds and that vol
unteer workers had to be accepted
"without any sort of investigation
into their backgrounds."
Dr. Townsend predicted the con
gressional inquiry into the organi
zation "will arouse the people more
than anything else that could be
done to the necessity for national
action."
