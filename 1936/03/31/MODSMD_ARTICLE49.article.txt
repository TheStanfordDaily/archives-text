## 
### 
Traveling everywhere from San j
Pedro through Los Gatos to North j
Vancouver, Stanford athletes drifted I
back to the Farm for the new quar
| ter with about a B average in inter -
| collegiate competition.
Ten teams in all, representing ten
i sports, toured the country on B.A.C.
money to do battle with various
and sundry opponents.
Basketball
On Saturday night, February 15,
the Stanford varsity basketball five
defeated Washington, northern di
vision champs, to win the Coast
Conference Crown; they had won
; the night before when Angelo Lui
' setti couldn't miss and scored 32 j
points all by himself.
Then in final district playoffs the |
i Cards, handicapped by lack of prac- j
tice, finals, and the long train ride, |
' lost to Oregon State, thereby being i
dropped from Olympics considera- j
tion.
Track
i Venturing down to Fresno the day
j after finals, Dink Ternpleton's un-
I derwear athletes breezed through
the strong Fresno State squad, win-
I ning 93Vfe-37Vfe. In Seattle last Sat
j urday they took revenge over Hec j
Edmundson's Washington U. team
! 71-60.
Baseball
On their annual spring vacation
trip, the horsehiders did not come ;
i out too handily, winning three, los- j
ing five games. The varsity beat an
| alumni team and the marines twice,
j lost a pair to both U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C.

dily, Nort Thornton's swimmers ran
! off with the Northern California
| swimming championship in Oak- j
land.
Tennis
Finding Gene Mako and his team- j
' mates a bit too tough to handle, the j
' tennis team dropped their match to !
Troy, 6-3, but came right back to
outstroke U.C.L.A. by the same
margin.

Spec Stewart returned to school, j
finding Don Edwards, Moe Erskine, |

: foils championships as Stanford's
team tied for second with Troy in
