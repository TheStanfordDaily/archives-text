# New Field Open To Track Men
## $24,000 Plant Is Ready For Competition 
### 
Climaxing a year's campaign by
students to get a new track, and a
three months' campaign by coaches
and runners against Sam McDon
ald and Jupiter Pluvius to get to use
it after they had it, Coach Dink
Templeton's trackmen formally
moved in on the renovated Angell
Field on March 19.
The $24,000 plant is pronounced
by all a success—"Like runnin'
down hill," is the comment of most
of the cindermen. Weiershauser
promptly cut his personal quarter
mile time to 48.7.
The new track is almost exactly
on the same site as the old one, but
a number of changes have been
made in the javelin, pole vault,
broad jump, and discus depart
ments. Oldlimers will scarcely rec
ognize the place with the old trees
cut down, the new inner 'turf, and
the fancy takeoffs and pits. As soon
as runners and jumpers get used to
the softer cinder mixture as com
pared with other Stanford tracks,
some records are going to fall.
Meanwhile Templeton's men come
home from Seattle to wajt for dry
enough weather to prepare for the
Olympic Club meet to be held here
Saturday afternoon. Coach Charley
Hunter's men have already defeated
the strong University of California
team, and will be favored Saturday.
Stanford's track schedule:
April 4—Olympic Club, here.
April 11—U.C.L.A., here.
April 18—U.S.C., in Los Angeles.
April 25—California, here.
