JUST WHY TIIE PHONEY
BASKETBALL PLAYOFF?

i With registration and spring
i homecoming and everything, there
1 remains m the mind of local sport
fans, now that the Stanford basket
ball team (all honor to its name)
has been erased as an Olympic
contender, just why they had to
have that extra taeked-on play-off
last week.
For the week before they kept
spotless their southern division
title by beating Washington, the
i team now rolling East for the
Berlin series, in two straight
; games.
But be cause they lost to Oregon
State, a long-shot if there ever
was one, in one game, they were
relegated to the also-ran cate
gory.
"Why," you will wail, "why, oh
why the playoff?"
Well, to be frank, no one around
I the B.A.C. can answer that, at least
after conducting a most cursory
j quiz.
But they have ideas, and as the
ideas check very dovetailLshly, they
are pretty likely based on fact.
You can picture a dozen or so
national athletic executives mak
ing up a board that invariably
plans these tournaments, leaning
back in comfortable chairs, be
j stockinged feet on (lie round
table, with cigars and Shasta water
siphons handy, droning "All
right now, we'll have the two best
north and south Pacific Confer
-1 ence teams play off for the 10th
district title. Yah, we realize
they've already had thampion
j ship play-offs, hut what the hell
this will make it official and all
that."
Thus Hie play-off was made fact,
; and Stanford made mud, as far as
' the Berlin boat-ride goes.
| It was too bad, too, for all of the
' authorities on the Coast basketball
situation admitted that John Bunn
had the cream team of the western
! crop.
But of course there were winter
quarter finals a couple of days be
fore Luisetti and the boys took on
Oregon State. And the train ride,
loss of sleep, foreign court, and such
similar hazards were not conducive
to great vitality by the Card quin
tuplets. So they lost to the Slaters.
Further in the mystery of why
they had t«» have the play-off is
the realization that no one of the

j nine Conference coaches was
known to have favored the play
off plan. John Bunn certainly did
not want the repetition routine,
f Sam Barry did not want it, and the
Northwest is said to have opposed
: it-
Nibs Price and Caddy Works,
State school coaches, did not openly I
favor it, so there is no visible rea- 1
1
son, as far as the coaches and teams |
| themselves were concerned, why the
play-offs had to be at ail. But still
there is the all-too-possible of big
; wig manipulation of the district

1 remains m the mind of local sport
fans, now that the Stanford basket
ball team (all honor to its name)
has been erased as an Olympic
contender, just why they had to
have that extra taeked-on play-off
last week.
For the week before they kept
spotless their southern division
title by beating Washington, the
i team now rolling East for the
Berlin series, in two straight
; games.
But be cause they lost to Oregon
State, a long-shot if there ever
was one, in one game, they were
relegated to the also-ran cate
gory.
"Why," you will wail, "why, oh
why the playoff?"
Well, to be frank, no one around
I the B.A.C. can answer that, at least
after conducting a most cursory
j quiz.
But they have ideas, and as the
ideas check very dovetailLshly, they
are pretty likely based on fact.
You can picture a dozen or so
national athletic executives mak
ing up a board that invariably
plans these tournaments, leaning
back in comfortable chairs, be
j stockinged feet on (lie round
table, with cigars and Shasta water
siphons handy, droning "All

north and south Pacific Confer
-1 ence teams play off for the 10th
district title. Yah, we realize
they've already had thampion
j ship play-offs, hut what the hell
this will make it official and all
that."

' the Berlin boat-ride goes.
