Innocent sounding, apparently worth while,
yet taring rather high Congressional hurdles,
the Nye-Kvale hill received an ollieial set
hae.k hnt popular approval on two compul
sory-It.(>.T.C.-infested t'niversity of Calilor
nia campi a short time ago.
The Nve-Kvale hill would make military
training in all state and land grant schools
and colleges elective rather than compulsory.
I'.C.L.A. and Berkeley student groups
joined forces and petitioned the Calilornia
Hoard of Hegents to do away with compulsory
training and make H.O.T.C. optional at the
two schools. Ihe Hoard deliberated 20 min
utes, then allii'ined compulsory drill, assert
ing "legal and moral obligations."
Stanford is n<>t bothered by provisions ol
the Nye-Kvale bill; the Farm military train
ing is already optional, for which every stu
dent whether pacifist or jingoist, whether a
prospective army ollicer or claimant of ex
emption for Hat feel has reason lo be thank
ful.
Stanford's military department finds little

] dissent, and no claim that personal liberties
' are being tampered with, lis students are
studying the technique of war because of
preference for one reason or another. And
the department annually enrolls a fairly large
. class, without compulsion.
II optional instead of mandatory, R.O.T.C.
! would face a similar situation at either of Ihc
I
i (iUliformas.
Instead of a MM) per cent enrollment of,dis
satisfied moaners, constantly and justifiably
complaining that democracy was being
stamped out, there would be a or f>() per
cent enrollment of students who appreciated
the courses oil'ered and who had only lo drop
! out if they morally objected to preparing for
j war.
It's the old story of compulsion taking Ihe
joy ttiil of anything, it's the argument of
democracy vs. fascism.
Yet Hearstian spokesmen for "national de
! fcnse" are making the prospects of Ihe Nye
! Kvale bill's passage more and more dubious.
