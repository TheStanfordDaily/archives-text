# NOW THAT Humor Magazines Have Taken to Crusading
## 
### 
NOW THA T the Pacific Coast's oldest hu
mor magazine reverted to some of the Pa
cific Coast's oldest humor and started picking
an editorial bone with Tin-: Daily, social jus
tice may again return to the Farm and the
heavy hand of monopoly may consider itsell
unhanded.
The specific charge against I in: Daily was
that the paper was suffering from editorial
hardening of the arteries, that the organ had
betrayed its trust to the people because it had
not attacked the vested interests, and princi
pally the Union.
The fact that Tin: Daily had spluttered
against the Union shortly before the edit ap
peared look a bit of the hot air out of the
Chappie s;tils, and seemed to point to the fact
that perhaps part of the charge was ground
less.
Hut it still raises the question: does the
success of Stanford journalism rise and fall
on tilling at windmills for the sake of the
emotional appeal of a campaign, or can an
editorial policy be successful if it tries to
remedy these "grave abuses" by quietly en
deavoring from lime to lime to co-operate
through constructive criticism?
If, in our quiet way, Tin-: Daily finds "grave
abuses" among any of the vested interests, of
which the Union is by no means the only one,
there will appear the usual fumings in news
print subsequently during the quarter. How
ever, there will be no prolubering of the
shnozzlc merely for exhbiition purposes.
Meanwhile, if Chaparral is so anxious for
Tin: Daily to lake over its ideas and exploit
them, perhaps it should have some ideas.
Chappie can remember when Tin-; Daily
was a crusading paper.
And Tin: Daily can remember when Chap
pie was a humor magazine.
