# A New Fieldâ€”And Farm Gets In on Ground Floor

While tlu- students scattered homeward for
llie second annual belwectwpiarters loaf, I lie
I'niversitv quietly lei the public in on ils
latest big secret.
A new division, to he known ;ss the Division
of Industrial delations in the (Iraduate School
of IJusiness, is to he established and will be
listed in the time scheuule next fall.
The new division will have as its purpose
the bringing about of a better understanding
of employer and employee relationship's. ICven
college students to whom industry, labor,

strikes, walk-onts, lock-outs, collective bar
gaining, and wage scales are ail a part of a
world they have not yet had to lace can appre
ciate the importance of what the Industrial
Relations Division will attempt to do.
In an atmosphere of impartiality which can
only be possible in a private institution, the
spirit of selfishness which prods labor to
scream for maximum wages and minimum
hours, and the relentless drive for profits
which forces employers to cut costs regard
less of consequences, may be forgotten as un
biased students seek to find and publish
heretofore undiscovered truths.
ISest of all, from the undergraduate view
point, is the announcement that courses in
social security and industrial relations will
be offered to students outside the Graduate
School. This will provide the rare privilege
of studying in a department which not only
teaches knowledge but creates it.
