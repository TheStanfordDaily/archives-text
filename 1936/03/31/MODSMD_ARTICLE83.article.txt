Conditions are getting so bad th.it all these brutes
that go by the name of Stanford men will have to
carry barometers on their watch chain to decide

America is getting white-shoes conscious, and it is
a comforting thing to think that college men are lead

nose, too. Comforting for the women that is, not the
nose.
It is not so comforting to realize that A Certain

laugh. And then the subject came up before the
President of the University. And Dr. Wilbur, who
had heard of the activities scholastic, academic, and
extra-curricular of the old Stanford Tradition, didn't
laugh either.
