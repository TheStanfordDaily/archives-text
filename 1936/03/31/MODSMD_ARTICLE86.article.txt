# Democratic Education?
## 
### GILBERT HARRISON, Editor California Daily Bruin, U.C.L. A 
There are some students v/ho are not interested in
the technique of killing.
The value of that technique has never been suffi
ciently proved to students to demand that they partici
pate, regardless of inclination, in training for war.
It has not been proved at all that one of the pur
poses of American education is instruction in the art
of fighting.
On the contrary, it has been accepted that the pur
pose of American education is instruction in the art
of thought. The success of America as a democracy
has been said to be dependent upon the success of that
instruction in the art of thought.
Education for a democracy is education of men to
think for themselves. It is not education by command.
It is not education by dictation. It is not education by
propaganda. It is not education which preaches any
bland of doctrine, nor is it education for the populariza
tion of any school of opinion. Education for a democ
racy teaches men to consider opinions wisely.
Compulsory military training is not concerned with
the wise consideration of the problems of war and
peace. It is not concerned with inquiring into the
causes of war or into the ways of realizing peace. It is
not interested in investigation of the value of war or
that of peace. It is concerned with the technique of
killing. It Ims for its business the selling of that tech
nique to its students. Its aim is the development of a
military-minded youth.

We do have an American tradition. It is not what
is so often referred to as an American tradition. What
we have been told are American traditions have been,
in many cases, merely convenient slogans by which
certain groups or individuals would organize the emo
tions of the American public to the service of certain
narrow ends.
But still, young as we are, we do have a real
American tradition. It is the tradition of the right of
man to believe as he would.
The American democracy was born out of a people
who valued their own convictions above those of the
government of their tinv. Obedience to God was
greater than obedience to State. Religious devotion
was superior to national devotion.
Excellence in the art of war was not and is not a
requirement of man's conscience. It is not taken as
valuable by the counsels of religion. It is a standard
of excellence set up by the governments of men. It is
a practice insisted upon by men who wish to preserve
their own power.
The founders of America had seen much of com
pulsion, of Imposition of political force against the
independent notions of religious thought.
America was ordained as a land for the protection
of men who would believe honestly end who would
act upon those beliefs honestly.
