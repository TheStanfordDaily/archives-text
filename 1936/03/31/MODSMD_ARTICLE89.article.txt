The Trail of the Lonesome Pine
is a sentimental melodrama adapted
from John Fox Jr.'s well known
novel. It tells the story of a long
standing feud between two fami-

lies of Virginia
mountaineers, the
Tollivers an d the
Falins, whose mu
tual difficulties are
increased when the
building of a rail-

road through their property makes
civilization conflict with old moun
tain customs. Through several tear
ful reels, June Tolliver (Sylvia Sid
ney), betrothed to her cousin Dave
(Henry Fonda), falls in love with
1 the railroad construction engineer
(Fred Mac Murray); little Buddy
Tolliver is killed when a sneaky
member of the Falin clan dynamites
the newly-begun railroad; the same
Falin shoots Dave in the back. When
this is over, the families decide to
patch up their differences after all.
Not the story but the technicolor
photography makes The Trail of the
Lonesome Pine significant. It sets
a new high for all-color films.
) However, the splendid shots of out
| door panoramas are still vastly su
: perior to the somewhat unnatural
close-ups of the actors' faces.
F-Man, on the same bill, is a
stupid filler about the dumb boy
from Oakda'.e, Nevada (population
1184), who decides tn turn G-man in
the big city. Jack Haliy offers his
usual vapid smile and inane actions.
Pictures of this sort ought not to
| encouraged. â€”Loud
