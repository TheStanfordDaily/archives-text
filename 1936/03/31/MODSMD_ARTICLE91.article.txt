There'll be no nudes in San
Francisco for the 1939 fair — if
City Administrator A. J. Cleary
can help it.
The Paris Exposition had Sep
tember Morn, Panama-Pacific had
Stella, Chicago had Sally Hand,
San Diego has a nudist colony.
Nudity, in fact, has always been
an integral part of world fairs.
But visitors to San Francisco in
1939 will, according to Cleary,
"look at our beautiful setting—
the shoals, the bay, the skyline,
and the bridges—instead of thighs
and legs."
The useful life of a modern air
plane varies frchi 5 to 10 years.
