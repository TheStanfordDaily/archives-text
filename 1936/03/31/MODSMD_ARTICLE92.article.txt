## AND DAVID LAMSON WILL GO FREE 
### 
Twelve more Santa Clara County
jurors couldn't find David Lamson
innocent. Three of them could, hut
the other nine fell in line with the

2 1 guilt - finders
of two previous
trials.
So the score
now stands 30 to
(5 for conviction,
but David Lam
son appears sure
to go free when
he appears in
court next Friday
— chielly because
taxpayers balk at
paying for a
fourth trial of a

crime which no one can prove was
ever committed.
# * *
Yes, the man who has endured
three bitterly disappointing trials
and been forced to spend nearly
three years of his life in that bastile
| of San Quentin and hell-box of San
j Jose is destined to go free. That day
i when freedom comes will be a day
j of glory for David Lamson himself,
j But what will it mean to Stanford—
1 his home, his school, the place where
! he earned his living after a brilliant
j undergraduate career?
* * *
What will it mean to such persons
| as Margery Bailey who sat on the
| witness stand in San Jose and de
j scribcd the relationship between
j David and Allene as "idyllic"? And
1 to kindly Mrs. Uhl, keeper of the
j women's clubhouse, who took the
i stand and compared the devotion of
j Mr. Lamson with that oi her own
i husband? What will it mean to those
members of the faculty who have
' written pamphlets, presenting talks,
sponsored petitions, and spread a
! wholesome propaganda in an at-
I tempt to make the cause of David
i Lamson the cause of the citizenry in
' general?
And what will it mean to the stu
, dents, most of whom were not in
1933, who delight in pronouncing
what they obviously think is so
phisticated condemnation, but who
! couldn't answer a simple question
| about the case if their diploma de
: pended on it.
i That attitude of the students, how

ever, is not important. But the fact
that the present study body is just
a few college terms removed from
the David Lamson who was editor
of Chappie, member of Hammer and
Coffin, Ram's Head, Sigma Delta
Chi, and a social fraternity, is im
portant.
* * *
Up until now obtaining freedom
for David Lamson has not been the
concern of the whole of Stanford—
the Stanford which was described on
the witness stand two weeks ago as
being "one big family where every
one in some way knows everyone
else." Now that freedom is almost at
hand, Stanford, collectively speak
ing, should and must have a new
concern —how will David Lamson be
received should he decide to return
to his home.
# * *
If I were he, I would come back,
shamelessly, confidently, perhaps a
little defiantly — just to put this
place with its traditions, ideals, and
spirit of equality and fraternity to
test. It would be a glorious oppor
tunity to prove sincerity or hy
pocrisy.
» * *
But whether David Lamson conges
back or not, after his freedom has
been gained, and whether or not
Stanford turns a haughty, hypo
critical back or extends a warm
hand of sympathy, he will be known
to many as a Stanford man who has
won a fight greater than most Stan
ford men will ever have to face.

j But what will it mean to Stanford—
1 his home, his school, the place where

* * *
What will it mean to such persons

j scribcd the relationship between
j David and Allene as "idyllic"? And
1 to kindly Mrs. Uhl, keeper of the

i That attitude of the students, how

ever, is not important. But the fact
that the present study body is just
a few college terms removed from

Up until now obtaining freedom
for David Lamson has not been the
concern of the whole of Stanford—
the Stanford which was described on
the witness stand two weeks ago as
being "one big family where every
one in some way knows everyone
else." Now that freedom is almost at
hand, Stanford, collectively speak
ing, should and must have a new
concern —how will David Lamson be
received should he decide to return
to his home.
# * *
If I were he, I would come back,
shamelessly, confidently, perhaps a
little defiantly — just to put this
place with its traditions, ideals, and
spirit of equality and fraternity to
test. It would be a glorious oppor
tunity to prove sincerity or hy
pocrisy.
» * *
But whether David Lamson conges
back or not, after his freedom has
been gained, and whether or not
Stanford turns a haughty, hypo
critical back or extends a warm
hand of sympathy, he will be known
to many as a Stanford man who has
won a fight greater than most Stan
ford men will ever have to face.

Twelve more Santa Clara County
jurors couldn't find David Lamson
innocent. Three of them could, hut
the other nine fell in line with the

2 1 guilt - finders
of two previous
trials.
So the score
now stands 30 to
(5 for conviction,
but David Lam
son appears sure
to go free when
he appears in
court next Friday
— chielly because
taxpayers balk at
paying for a
fourth trial of a

crime which no one can prove was
ever committed.
