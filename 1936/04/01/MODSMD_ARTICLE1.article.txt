# Bruno Lives; Jury To Probe 'New Angles'
## Warden Grants Two-Day Extension as Scheduled Hour for Death Arrives 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., March 31 (#>).â€”
Bruno Richard Hauptmann tonight
received a dramatic 48-hour exten
sion of life even in the hour he had
resigned himself to death in the
electric chair.
As the clock struck the hour for
his execution as the Lindbergh baby
killer, Warden Mark O. Kimberling
of State Prison announced a two
day delay to afford the County
Grand Jury additional time in which
to investigate what he called "some
interesting new angles in the case."
While Hauptmann remained in his
death house cell the Grand Jury
pressed ahead with its independent
inquiry into the repudiated "con
fession" of Paul H. Wendel, a former
Trenton attorney.
The delay in carrying out the
execution mandate was made by ihe
warden himself on the authority he
held, even as the executioner waited
for Hauptmann.
Warden Kimberling, authorized
under the terms of Hauptmann's
sentence to inflict the death penalty
any time he chooses "during the
week of March 130," said he acted at
the request of the Grand Jury.
With a crowd of several hundred
persons waiting outside the prison
walls for word that Executioner
Robert Elliott had performed his
duty, Warden Kimberling faced the
group of men who had gathered in
his office to act as official witnesses
and said:
"There are some interesting new
angles in the case they wish to in
vestigate."
