# Interfraternity Council To Vote On Rushing Plan
## Program To Include New Rules; Hoover Asks For Closer House Relations 
### George Veness 
Tonight at 7:15 o'clock the Inter- j
fraternity Council will meet at the |
Phi Delt house to decide whether the
new rushing system which was pro- \
mulgated by a special Intefraternity j
committee and has been passed by
both the Interfraternity Board and i
Dr. Wilbur will become Stanford's 1
official rushing system.
Three-Point Plan
The proposed plan, which will be
presented to the Council by Tom
Boothe, chairman of the Intefrater- '
nity Board, has three salient fea
tures: first—rushing will take place j
only on week-ends; second, formal 1
pledging will take place the second
week of winter quarter; third, the j
success of the new plan will depend
on a "gentleman's agreement" be- !
tween the houses.
The Interfraternity Board feels
that only by a concerted moral ac- j
tion among the houses can the best t
results be attained in eliminating 1
illegal rushing and its corresponding I
evils, according to Boothe.
Thus the "gentleman's agree
ment" is little more than an Inter
fraternity Honor Code. Should any
violations arise under this system j
the Interfraternity Board would be
empowered to act at its discretion. ,
Co-operation Sought
When asked concerning his opin- |
ion of the "gentleman's agreement" j
by which it Is hoped to make the :
plan effective, Bob Hoover, new i
president of the Interfraternity j
Council, said, "I believe that this :
agreement can be promoted best j
only by the creation of a better j
spirit and better feelings among the ;
fraternities . . . Actual social rela
tions between fraternities on the j
campus are relatively scarce —an in
crease in interfraternity functions |
and activities such as exchange din
ners or joint dances would breed
more friendly relations among the j
houses."
