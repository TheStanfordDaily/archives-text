CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 31
(AP). — A new seismograph for
airplanes, to read imitation earth
quakes running through a plane
from engine vibration, was an
nounced today at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
The flying seismograph will pick
up the shocks from one or several
different parts of the engine, si
multaneously, and record them all
at the same receiving station,
which can he set at any convenient
point in the ship.
