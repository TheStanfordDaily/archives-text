If you're "out to get an all-round f
education but don't cure what you '
learn," ask the Bookstore to order j
for you the 90-page, anonymously- !
written "Psychology of Getting
Grades."
The little "cheater's bible" was \
discovered by Registrar Mitchell
himself but, he tells us, "the only
person cheated is the student him
self."
Avoid Lab Courses
In the first place, the book recom- j
mends, choose a few large unit i
courses rather than many small unit j
ones and avoid lab courses. If you j
must take them, accept the fact that j
all lab assistants are poor teachers.
Don't hesitate to drop a disagree
able course when it's only an elec- '
five.
Regarding professors, Ihe book ,
suggests that a mature one always
be chosen—one whose heart would
break if he ever flunked a student.
Avoid profs who say "probably true
to some extent but not to it certain
degree," and pick a man who has
written his own texts. He'll repeat
himself in lectures, you see.

The best time to impress a pro
fessor is during the first two weeks.
If he likes you at first he's apt to
be more lenient later on. Find out
his hobby and talk to him about it
after class.
"If the professor calls on the
dumbells," says the nameless au
thor, "look intelligent even if it's a
strain." But never argue with him.
Always Ilave an Answer
When you get caught with an un
answerable question, don't say "I
don't know" but guess instead. If
the guess is wrong, look extraordi
narily surprised, and gaze enrap
tured at the student who gives the
correct answer. (Some are worth
while gazing at even with the wrong
answer though this, of course, is a
personal matter.)
"There is a higher relationship
between college grades and success
on jobs than between success and
intelligence," the manual reveals.
This point, that the development of
salesmanship ability through con
stant striving towards getting good
grades with a minimum of work, is
whiit Dr. Mitchell feels justifies tin*
presence of the book at Stanford.

Regarding professors, Ihe book ,
suggests that a mature one always
be chosen—one whose heart would

Always Ilave an Answer
When you get caught with an un
answerable question, don't say "I
don't know" but guess instead. If
the guess is wrong, look extraordi

answer though this, of course, is a
personal matter.)

written "Psychology of Getting
Grades."
