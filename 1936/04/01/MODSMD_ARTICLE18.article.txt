# Seek Code Reaction
## 
### 
Recent investigation of viola
tions has caused the Councils to
express their opinions on the
Honor Code. The system under
which we study and take exam
inations was evolved by an agree
ment between the administration
and students.
Has morale here slipped so
much that we are no longer able
to use personal honor as a basis
for academic conduct?
GIB HOLLOWAY,
Chairman, Men's Council

The Daily's poll tomorrow is a
definite move which will offer
students an opportunity to settle
permanently a question which has
grown out of frequent criticism
or lack of interest in Stanford's
Honor System.
We urge all students to take
advantage of ihis ballot, and to
express their opinions on the
problem of maintaining the Honor
Code.
PAT FLAVEL,
Chairman, Women's Council
