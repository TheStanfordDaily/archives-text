With the announcement of the

plans for the 1936 edition of the
| Convalescent Home Drive grew
| apace.

will hold its first meeting at 4

| offices were Don Dewar, Betty Grov-
J er, Harmon Howard, A1 Hyman,
, Ralph Keating, Elsie Lillard, Norm
! Maclntyre, Welton Smith, and
I Walt Vincenti.
Scheduled for Friday, April 24, no
; definite plans have yet been made
j either for the decorations or music
lat the Masque Ball. However, at
present there seems to be consider
able favor for a Venetian motif.
Tentative plans will be made at this
afternoon's meeting, and, as Franich
expressed it, "things will start with
j a bang, if all the committee mem
! bers show up."
Tomorrow afternoon the chairmen
j of the various committees will visit
1 the Convalescent Home, so that they
I can better understand the organiza
' tion for which they are working.
