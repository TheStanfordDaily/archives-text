# Daily To Take Farm Poll On Honor System
## Will Sound Out University Opinions by Questions On Code's Effectiveness 
### 
To assist student governing bodies
in their efforts to place the Honor
Code on a stronger, recognized
basis, Tlie Stanford Daily tomorrow
will conduct a Farm-wide poll of
replies to seven relative questions
appearing as a ballot.
Council Heads Consulted
Decision to sponsor the poll came
after editorial executives had con
ferred with Men's and Women's
Councils officials last night on pro
posed climaxes for the Councils'
joint Honor System inquiry begun
last quarter.
Results of tomorrow's action will
be employed by both the Councils
and Ex Committee, it was reported.
Tabulations will be released in the
newspaper Monday, after which the
official groups will take steps either
to strengthen existing policies or to
supplant them with another system
of the proctor type.
Brooke Statement
•' Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president
and chairman of Ex Committee, is
sued the following statement:
"The Honor Code for too long has
been taken for granted, but in view
of recent investigations by the
Councils into Honor Code viola
tions, an accurate indication of how
the student body feels about the
Code and its alternative, the proc
tor system, is highly important to
me.
"The Executive Committee will
heavily weigh The Daily poll's re
sults as a factor in considering a
resolution commending, changing,
or abolishing the Honor Code. Such
an action is quite within our power
as regulators of student conduct."
Questions which will appear on
The Daily's ballot are:
1. Do you think the Honor Code
is working effectively?
2. Do you consider the signing of
the pledge superfluous?
3. Would you report a student
whom you were convinced had vio
lated the Honor Code?
4. If not, would you take any steps
(such as warning the person) to aid
observance of the Code?
5. Do ynu believe student govern
ment, rather than the administra
tion, should enforce the Code?
6. Do you favor continuation of
the Honor Code at Stanford?
7. If not, would you favor install
ing the proctor system?
Comment Asked
In addition, space will be provided
on the ballot for individual com
ment. The queries were composed
by members of The Daily editorial
staff in collaboration with Pat Fla
vel and Gib Holloway, chairmen of
Women's and Men's Councils.
The question forms are to be torn
from the page, marked, and de
posited in a box which will be placed
in the lobby of the Union Cellar.

To assist student governing bodies
in their efforts to place the Honor
Code on a stronger, recognized
basis, Tlie Stanford Daily tomorrow
will conduct a Farm-wide poll of
replies to seven relative questions
appearing as a ballot.
Council Heads Consulted
Decision to sponsor the poll came
after editorial executives had con
ferred with Men's and Women's
Councils officials last night on pro
posed climaxes for the Councils'
joint Honor System inquiry begun
last quarter.
Results of tomorrow's action will
be employed by both the Councils
and Ex Committee, it was reported.
Tabulations will be released in the
newspaper Monday, after which the
official groups will take steps either
to strengthen existing policies or to
supplant them with another system
of the proctor type.
Brooke Statement
•' Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president
and chairman of Ex Committee, is
sued the following statement:
"The Honor Code for too long has
been taken for granted, but in view
of recent investigations by the
Councils into Honor Code viola
tions, an accurate indication of how
the student body feels about the
Code and its alternative, the proc
tor system, is highly important to
me.
"The Executive Committee will
heavily weigh The Daily poll's re
sults as a factor in considering a
resolution commending, changing,
or abolishing the Honor Code. Such
an action is quite within our power
as regulators of student conduct."
Questions which will appear on
The Daily's ballot are:
1. Do you think the Honor Code
is working effectively?
2. Do you consider the signing of
the pledge superfluous?
3. Would you report a student
whom you were convinced had vio
lated the Honor Code?
4. If not, would you take any steps
