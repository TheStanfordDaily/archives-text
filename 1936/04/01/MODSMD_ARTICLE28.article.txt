### Grey Creveling 
IF YOLK COLUMNIST were at
Republican instead of a political ag
nostic, he would boost William Ed
gar Borah for the nomination to the
presidency.
Republicans can have all they
want of half-baked budget-bal
ancers like "Genial Alf" Lamlon.
or stuffed shirts like Frank Knox,
or favorite sons like Arthur Van
denberg, the affable Dutchman.
Give me the old tearer-downer—
Borah.
There are a lot of things against
Borah—his age, 71 in June, his nar- i
row views on international relations
and so on. But there are things in !
his favor.
HO It AII IS the "most famed Sen
ator of this century," as TIME puts
it. He is a forceful man who weasels i
less than any of his contemporaries, j
lie is progressive and a self-avowed
liberal. He does not hang back with i
the Old Guard of the GOP. In fact,
he takes every oppoit unity offering j
itself to punch the reactionaries right
in their solemn faces.
He hates the old gang. Of them
he says, "If the men who have led
the organization are sitting on the
front row at the Cleveland con
vention and dominate the platform
and the name of the candidate,
that ten million (Republicans who
strayed from the ranks to support
Roosevelt in 1 fKI2) never will come
back and other millions (will be
lost) with them.'
An enemy of monopoly, Borah ;
was one of the big politicos sup
porting Teddy Roosevelt in his
trust-busting activities.
IFE HAS ALWAYS been the de- i
fender of the Constitution, and j
whether that is to his credit or not, ;
1 leave to you. But he further con- {
demns contemporary leaders of his j
party with such statements as:
"It is a question of the perform
ance of the highest duty offered
Republican citizens and you may
forget me, if you desire, but not
certain men. whose faces are
toward the dawn, who believe in f
liberalism and who want to re- i
turn the Republican party to
power."
Borah means but one thing. The |
Republican platform must be writ- I
ten and the nominee must be chosen j
in view of the liberal policies which ;
Borah has espoused during his long
career as "Gentleman From Idaho"
-Roosevelt I to Roosevelt 11.

TIIE THREE PENALIZED sorori
ties did pretty well for themselves
after all. Rushing rules and penal
ties for breaking them are about as
effective as the federal laws prohib
iting the transportation of prize fight
motion pictures in interstate com
merce.
A doddering but constantly snub
bed plan for rushing is the scheme
which postpones pledging until
spring quarter. The obvious advan
tages provided by allowing the
freshman to really make up his mind
and to acquaint the greenhorn with
what it is all about seem to go un
heeded by the Greek gods who are
trying to fix up the rushing rules.
Why not combine an honor sys
tem with spring pledging and give
that plan a chance. Let's have some
real penalties. If Greeks really
mean it, stiff punishments should be
just the thing to stop the illegal
horse-play. The plan, therefore,
amounts to the honor code plus rig
orous penalties for violation — the
same kind of an arrangement that is
employed for scholastic examina
tions.
