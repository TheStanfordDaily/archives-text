# Hitler Proposes Short Truce In Rhineland Crisis
## No Border Troop Increase During 4-Month Peace If Other Powers Agree 
### 
BERLIN. March 31 (/P). â€”A four- i
month "armistice" with a three- j
man international commission to
control both the German and the j
French-Belgian sides of the frontier !
was reliably said tonight to be j
Adolf Hitler's counter-proposals to !
the Locarno powers in the Rhine- j
land crisis.
During the "figurative or moral j
armistice" Germany would agree j
not to increase her Rhineland troops, I
but France ind Belgium would j
have to give the same guarantee.
This plan was flown to London by i
Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's j
special ambassador, for delivery to |
Anthony Eden, British Foreign Sec- ;
retary. Von Ribbentrop arrived at
Croydon airport at 8:30 p.m.
Hitler proposes that the Interna
tional Commission he composed
of an Englishman, an Italian, and
a neutral to be chosen by the Eng
lish and the Italians.
This commission would not only
control +he German side of the bor- ;
der to see that troops are not in
creased but also the French-Belgian
side.
The Locarno proposal of an inter
national police force on German
soil apparently was rejected.
This was said to be the kernel of ;
the long document which Von Rib- j
bentrop took to London.
Hitler considers the negotiations
for a "more peaceful peace" ought
to be completed within the four
month period.
