# Going For a Walk? Carry a Pedometer

"But gee, pop, you don't know I
what it's like without a car at '
Stanford. I gotta walk so far."
Now the fellow who said that to
his dad last week was right. And to 1
find out once and for all just how
much difference a car makes — in
actual miles covered on foot—the
Daily fastened pedometers on Cet- |
tain Students around the campus j
and then checked up on the facts, j
Tlie average pedestrian-rough
ran the pedometer needle to 3.625
miles in the course of one day's j
campus peripatetic activities. His
more fortunate car-driving brother !
walks but 1.001 mile per day, the
dial revealed. j
Walked a Mile
One of the "riding-roughs" regis- I
tered just a mile for 24 hours. Dur
ing that time he went to a jolly-up, '
too. He must dance like a dream if |
his fox-trot makes no impression on i
the otherwise infallibly-sensitive i
pedometer.
I don't know where they carried j
the thing, but several women had |
their walkings l'egistered also. The
average poor thing with no car of !
her own covered 2.125 miles—and we
had to set the pedometer to a de- [
murely-feminine 23-inch pace (the i
men's averaged an even yard.)
The Woman Driver
Only three-quarters of a mile did j
the woman driver wa1k—3,960 feet. '
Why, that's not even once around
the outer quad.
We slipped one of the tell-tale j
little instruments into an Encina
hasher's pocket the night of the I
Lagunita Formal last quarter and |
waited for him to come home. He'd
gone 4.0G25 miles from 9:30 to 2:30. i
Little did he and his partner know 1
that with every swing of the rhythm

the pedometer needle was going
round and round. They took a walk
out to the lake, he admitted later.

gone 4.0G25 miles from 9:30 to 2:30. i
Little did he and his partner know 1
that with every swing of the rhythm

the pedometer needle was going
round and round. They took a walk
out to the lake, he admitted later.
"But gee, pop, you don't know I
what it's like without a car at '
Stanford. I gotta walk so far."
Now the fellow who said that to
his dad last week was right. And to 1
find out once and for all just how
much difference a car makes — in
actual miles covered on foot—the
Daily fastened pedometers on Cet- |

Tlie average pedestrian-rough
ran the pedometer needle to 3.625
miles in the course of one day's j
campus peripatetic activities. His
more fortunate car-driving brother !

dial revealed. j
Walked a Mile
One of the "riding-roughs" regis- I
tered just a mile for 24 hours. Dur

I don't know where they carried j
the thing, but several women had |
their walkings l'egistered also. The
average poor thing with no car of !
her own covered 2.125 miles—and we

men's averaged an even yard.)

Only three-quarters of a mile did j

Why, that's not even once around
the outer quad.
We slipped one of the tell-tale j
little instruments into an Encina

Lagunita Formal last quarter and |
