# Tension Exists Over Jap Dead
## Bodies of Men Slain By Mongols Not Returned 
### 
TOKYO, March 31 </P).—An au
thoritative source said tonight that
Premier Koki Ilirota had informed
his Cabinet that the latest series of
clashes on the frontiers of Manchu
kuo were already "being liquidated
through diplomatic channels."
Nevertheless, the Domei (Japa- ;
nese) News Agency reported from
Manchukuo that Russian border
guards had not returned the bodies
of two Japanese killed last week.
It was reported that the com
mander of the Soviet frontier post
alleged he had received no instruc
tions—perhaps owings to interrupted
telegraphic communications.
There were no further develop
ments in the tension between Man
chukuo and Outer Mongolia, and
their advisers, Japan and Russia.
