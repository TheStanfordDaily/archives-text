# Card-St. Mary's Game To Be Played Today
## Second Base Post Sought By Howell Turner; Team Needs Batting Practice 
### 
Because of the* soggy condition of
the sunken diamond, the baseball
game between the Card nine and St.
Mary's scheduled for yesterday has
been postponed until today.
Turner Reports
Wolter intends to use Dick Arm
strong on the mound against the
league-leading Gaels, with Leo
Heagerty behind the bat. Starting
pitcher for St. Mary's is unknown,
but will probably be Yost or Flana
gan.
Yesterday Coach Harry Wolter
put his charges through a brief bat
ting and fielding drill in preparation
for the Gael invasion. Howell Tur
ner, second baseman last year, who
was busy playing basketball all last
quarter, reported for practice today,
and may work into the line-up.
Hits Needed
If the Cards can overcome their
inability to hit in the pinches, which
cost them several ball games in their
tour of Southern California over
spring vacation, they may be able
to upset the league-leading Gaels.
In both ball games against the
U.C.LA. nine, the Indians had nu
merous chances to win but failed to
come through with hits when men
were in scoring position.
Hamiltons Hit
Red Holman, Bones and Glenn
Hamilton, and Bill Newsom were
doing yeoman work with the wil
low on the trip, and when the day
comes that the Cards can bunch
their hits they will surprise the
other teams by amassing a> quantity
of runs.
With Turner lttw out in a suit,
the second base situation is further
complicated. Frank Tremaine, two
years ago a regular third baseman,
played most of the games on the trip
at the keystone position, supplant
ing Jack Huddleston, who had oc
cupied the spot during all of March.
