# U.S.C. Favored In Swim Friday
## Boothe, Relay Team Best Bets in L.A. Contest 
### 
Tom Boothe dives for the first
' time as captain of the Stanford
i swimmers Friday niyht when the
Indians, with little chance for vic-
I tory, tangle with the powerful Tro
i jan team at the Olympic pool in
j Los Angeles.
Stanford's best event will be the
400-yard free-style relay. Holder
of the Pacific Association record, the
Indian team should win.
Boothe finds plenty of competi
| tion for himself, for Olympic Games
Diver Frank Kurtz will be perform -
I ing for U.S.C.
Roger Hatch, considered the
| greatest sprinter on the Coast, will
I churn through the short distances
j for the Trojans. Stanford's Martin
J Scatena will oppose him in the 50,
j and Sophomore Jack Vibert is en
| tered against him in the 100.
Paulsen, Olympic games breast
stroke swimmer, and Boals, distance
I ace, seem to be sure of wins for
Troy. Paulsen held the world's rec
ord for the 50-yard breast-stroke
until his mark was broken this win
ter by Stanford's Don Towne, fresh
man.
