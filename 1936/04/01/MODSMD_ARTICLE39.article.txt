# Spikers Breeze Through Races On New Track
## Voigt's Eligibility Bolsters Sprint Team; Dellinger Returning to 440 Form 
### 
The new and greater Angell Field
I came through its first test yester-
I day with a score of exactly 83. The
track drainage is perfect; difficulty
! was found only in weight throwing
| rings and jump take-offs.
It really gave Dink Templeton's
lads a new and grand sensation to
i be able to start preparations for the
Olympic Club meet this Saturday
half a day after the rains stopped.
A little mud stuck to the spikes
i and slowed down the times, but the
; looting was hard and sure, and all
| hands were running full distance.
Workmen will start erection of a
grandstand today, in preparation for
! the several meets to be held at the
i new plant this season.
In the meantime, Stanford en
i thusiasts hailed with glee the re
: turn of Chuck Voigt, sprinter, to
I eligibility, and watched Truck Del
j linger stride through a :53 quarter
: in told-time bull-chested style. Del
j linger has been out for the season
I with a badly pulled thigh muscle,
but has recovered enough to predict
j a return to competitive shape for
' the Big Meet April 25.
Jim Reynolds, weightman who has
j been under the flu for a week, has
i returned to the fold, and yesterday
! was working with Slinger Dunn,
who will oppose him Saturday.
I Wally Hardin, tops javelin man,
j however, has incurred a wrenched
J back that may ruin his season.
