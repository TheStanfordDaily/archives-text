Now that the Olympic Club has |
beaten California in a dual track j
meet, we shall see what the star
spangled club can do against the
Dink Templeton array.
It would be outright hypocrisy
to say that we'll win, just for pa
triotic reasons. Because Charley
Hunter's club, gathered together in
this, the Olympic Games year,
boasts most of the local track
athletes who are not eligible for j
collegiate competition, and really
should heat any other team in the
country.
Htonter has Bright, Eastman, j
Robinson, Kirkpatrick (if they al- |
low him to race), Dunn, Mottram, !
Mauger, Blackman, Clark, Bob
Jones, Marty, Waterburyâ€”to men
tion only the most familiar and ef
ficient performers.
With this list of biggies, it looks
like Stanford must take her first
loss of the season Saturday, for in
the aforementioned array the Club
has a x'easonable bet to win ten
events at the minimum. The three
shorter races are the Club's only
mediocre spots, counting Kirkpatrick
in on the hurdles.
Out of the 17 Californians who
were picked by an eastern poll as
Olympics representatives, more than
half wear the red silkies and be
winged "O" on Saturday afternoons.
This plus big young Kirkpatrick, '
who is an under-rated contender
running in record time with a vic
ious. yet pretty swing over the
barriers.
