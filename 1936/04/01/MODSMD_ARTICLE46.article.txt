# Large Turnout Starts Spring Football Today
## Eighty-five Sign on For 3 Workouts Per Week; Tiny Builds New Team 
### 
Eighty-five men filed spring foot- j
ball blue cards yesterday, ana that '
number will don cleats and padding !
this afternoon for the curtain-rais
ing move toward the inception of the
1936 Big Red Machine, a brand new |
model.
This year's model will be an ex- j
ception to the rule in that there will 1
be no nucleus of "Vowing Sopho- j
mores" or "Laughing Boys" to build \
the team around.
Positions Open
There will just be a bunch of i
varsity men from last year, a husky ,
bunch of frosh and a few picked jay- j
see transfers, with at least nine po
sitions on the first string open to a I
free-for-all fight, with the jobs go- :
ing to the best men.
On the sign-up list of 85, the name '
of Claude Callaway is not to be >
found. It is still not yet certain .
whether the big tackle, one of the |
original "Vowing Sophomores," who j
stayed off the team last fall, will !
wear his old Number 11 jersey again j
next fall.
New Tackles
At tackle, however, Coach Tiny
Thornhill has little worry except as
to who the regulars will be. There
are Pop Grant, from last year's
varsity, Pete Zagar, the frosh star, j
Don Giddings, Menlo transfer and 1
reportedly a coming great, and two
new jaysee transfers.
3 Weekly Workouts
Coach Thornhill will give his men
a workout today and one Friday, ,
and then will work them at least
thrice a week thereafter. Funda
mentals will be stressed during the
spring session. To climax the quar- j
ter's work there will be a scrim
mage among two choose-up teams, !
which will see each of the members
of the squad getting a chance to
show his prowess.
Among those signing up, of un
usual interest, were Earl Hoos, who
worked in the city all last quarter, j
and who is expected to give a hot t
battle for a backfield job, Monk
Moscrip, and Frank Alustiza.
