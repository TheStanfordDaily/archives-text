College men—collect bonuses im- !
mediately for wars which you will 1
fight in the future.

College womeiv —travel to • Eu- j
rope to see the undug graves where j
your future husbands and children
may be buried as victims of the
next war.

These are the aims of the "Veter- I
ans of Future Wars" organization
and its auxiliary the "Home Fire |
Division," recently established at i
Princeton University and Vassar and j
sweeping to collegiate popularity all
over the United States.

Wally Brooke, student body presi
dent, last night indicated that' action
on whether or not a Stanford post
is to be organized would be referred '
to the Committee 011 National and
Student Affairs and would be j
brought up in Ex Committee meet- 1
ing next week.
Demand SIOOO
The two organizations are pri
marily for students and demand im
mediate payment of a bonus of $1000 j
plus 3 per cent interest compounded
annually from June 1, 1965 to June j

1, 1936, retroactively to the men who
will fight in the next war.
The Home Fire Division, started as
the Gold Stan - Mothers of Veterans
of Future Wars, but changed be
cause of protest, is composed of col
lege women who plan to travel
abroad to visit the future graves of
their husbands and children. This
auxiliary was started at Vassar at
the same time as was Princeton's
main group.
Tiger Heads Group
As the organization chief defend
er, L. J. Gorin of Princeton, x-ecently
elected National Commander, com
ments:
"There are several reasons for this
demand. First, there is absolutely
no justice in paying a bonus after a
war, for by then the most deserving
bloc of veterans has always been
killed. Second, an immediate pay
ment will help lift us out of the
depression."
Veterans Protest
Despite protest from Veterans of
Foieign Wars, who recently success
fully deinanded immediate payment
of their bonuses, the new organiza
tion has swept to popularity all over
the country.
Dr. Henx-y Reining, Jr., of Piince
ton and fix-st faculty member to en
ter the x'anks of the Futux - e Veterans,
said, "I am happy to become a mem
ber of this splendid ox*ganization.
I approve of its objectives. It is high
time Amex'ica thought in tex'ins of
the futui'e as well as the past.
Opposed at Troy
Students at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, Troy, N.Y., have formed
an opposition faction by organizing
a "Profiteer's of Future Wars"
group.
''We're going to get in orx the
gravy, instead of being made into
gravy," Buell Webstex*, pi'esident,
remarked. Irx a statement of policy
the oxganization announced that it
would lobby for immediate payment
of profits froiTi contracts not yet let
for supplies and would violently
fight the payment of bonuses.
Hearst Honored
At the Univex'sity of Idaho a Wil
liam Randolph Hearst post of the
V.F.A. was established last week.
The name of "the virile, red-blooded
publisher" was chosen without
comment.
The Idaho post pledged itself to
"stamp out the subversive elements
in our schools and colleges" as soon
as they undex-stood the meaning of
the teiTn.
