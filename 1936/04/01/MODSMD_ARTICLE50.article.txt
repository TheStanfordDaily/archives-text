## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" Co-operation Through Criticism" Exchange Dinners, Joint Dances Fine; But Why Limit Them to the Houses? 
### 
In suggesting means of creating a better
inter-fraternity feeling, Hob Hoover, new fra
ternity council head, last night hit on a point
which, it adapted to other campus living
groups as well as the houses, can promote a
significantly worth-while advance in Stan
lord's social relations.

Hoover said, . . an increase in interfra
ternity functions and activities such as ex
change dinners or joint dances would breed
more friendly relations among the houses."
All of which is not only a probability, but a
sure-lire bet.

Hut why not stretch it to the sororities?
And to the dormitories and eating clubs?
And even socially intermingle Row and Hall?
It couldn't do any harm —particularly not
until the spring elections convince the vari
ous campus politicians that Hall and How are
farther apart than Berlin and Paris.

Now, with the stress on house dances or
Toyon smokers, a large portion of the stu
dent body knows few campus contacts other
than those olTcred by one small living group.
The plan to emphasize inter-group func
tions probably will get an official send-off at
tonight's Interfraternity Council session,
when more complete plans for means of ef
fecting the campaign will be discussed.
When the system of inter-lraternily func
tions has been installed, the move for more
informal contacts between other living
groups may gain momentum.
A Kappa-El Toro exchange dinner or a Phi
Dclt-Hreakers joint dance on the Stanford
campus would be a rare but interesting phe
nomenon. And it would be a God-send for a
couple of the Farm's tottering traditions—
the spirit of equality and campus-wide friend
liness.
