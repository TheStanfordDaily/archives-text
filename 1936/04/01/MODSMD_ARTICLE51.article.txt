# Compulsory R.O.T.C. Fails As Arm of National Defense
## 
### 
ll' compulsory R.O.T.C. actually contrib
uted to American defense against war, as a
Vox Cam pi writer suggests, it would justify,
in the lay mind at least, the toil and trouble
it lias caused.

Rut there is justification in doubling this
assumption. The R.O.T.C. conducts the stu
dents in the art of carrying the harquebus,
harnessing horses, and in squads-lefting and
squads-righting. It hopes by Ibis means to
develop a corps of "reserve oilieers," who will
rush to the colors as experienced hands in the
arts of war when the call is sounded.
For two years, three hours a week, students
must march and countermarch on the parade
grounds. At the end of Ibis time, the dissent

ers depart and those who wish to continue on
and become reserve oilieers may do so.
It is bard to see how drilling conscientious
objectors three hours per week for two
years is going to prepare America for war.
It certainly has not made the students reserve
officers. It has taught them very little of
military discipline and much of the spirit of
revolt against restraint.
The Army obviously hopes to lure the dis
all'ected into the camp by making R.0.T.C..
compulsory, but it is an axiom in student
life that what is compulsory is disagreeable.
Ry making the system compulsory, the serv
ice thus loses what enthusiasm it may pos
sibly engender in some students and kills
morale through the whole service by attempt
ing to train grumblers.
If the Army is to organize America into an
cllicient lighting machine in some future war
with "the enemies of Democracy," it should
<111 it antagonizing the liberals and malcon
tents, should not waste its money on the dis
interested, but should concentrate on really
training men who can be military leaders.
