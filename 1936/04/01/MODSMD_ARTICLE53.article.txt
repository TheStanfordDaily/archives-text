# It's Sugar-Coated Enough Without Making It Compulsory

"We won some things from the war, that were
not on the program. For example, we had a com
plete demonstration of the fallacy of the old tra
dition that preparedness prevents war."—George
11. Dern, in an address at Riverside, California,
December 1931.
In December, 1935, Mr. Dern, as Secretary of War,
was busy spending the largest peacetime military ap
propriation in the history of the United States, making
capital of "the old tradition that, preparedness pre
vents war" to hasten the drive toward a bigger and
better war.
The patriotcers—including, we trust, Mr. Dern—
have not forgotten the institutions of higher learning.
To date more than two hundred campuses hava found
a place for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. An
other hundred are expected to add military training
to their curricula in the near future. In 118 institu
tions of learning drill is not only offered but required.

Senator Nye of North Dakota and Representative
Kvale of Minnesota have introduced a bill .... that
would stipulate that no R.O.T.C. unit be approved at
any school or college "until such institution shall have
satisfied the Secretary of War that enrollment in
such unit (except in the case of essentially military
schools) is elective and not compulsory."
Mild as it may appear, consonant with the demo
cratic idea as it is, the Nye-Kvale Bill is by no means
assured of passage.
No sooner did the campaign against militarism in
education begin to assume formidable proportions
than spokesmen for "national defense" rushed forward
with euphemisms and counter-charges. The R.O.T.C.
was a higher form of "physical education"; the goose
step was "character education"; compulsory drill was
"citizenship training," an antidote for the subversive
agitation of students who felt, and said, that it was un
necessary and futile and they would have nothing to
do with it.

It means little to the defenders of the R.O.T.C.
that the best minds in the field of physical education
have characterized as a hollow falsehood the claim
that drill "builds men."
It is irrelevant to the apostles of chauvinism that
the kind of "character" developed by the corps is other
wise known as the "military mind" which—Professor
Reinhold Niebuhr once stated — "makes unthinking
obedience the summum bonum in the hierarchy of
virtues."
What that "citizenship" implies was once illustrated
in an official R.O.T.C. manual (withdrawn from cir
culation. thanks to student protests, ten years ago).
One passage read: "This inherent desire to fight and
kill must be carefully watched for and encouraged by
the student. . . ." And further: "To finish an opponent
who hangs on or attempts to pull you to the ground,
always try to break his hold by driving the knee or
foot to his crotch and gouging his eyes with your
thumbs."
"Citizenship," indeed!
Wide public support for the Nye-Kvale Bill may
not signify the beginning of the end for the R.O.T.C.
But it will prevent further expulsions of students
who, on religious or political grounds, refuse to
submit to compulsory drill.
♦ * * *
It is encouraging that the tremendous growth of
the RO.T.C. since the war has not occurred without
artificial stimulation. Although the cavalry went out
of style and utility after Appomatox, thousands of
horses have been provided as sugar-coating for the
pill of compulsory training. Fortunes have been spent,
on flashy uniforms. Pretty girls have been recruited
as "sponsors." The enemy has been resourceful.
There is going to be a fight to the finish between a
strong student peace movement and a highly-subsi
dized regiment <>f training for slaughter. The outlook
will be more reassuring once the Nye-Kvale Bill is
law.
