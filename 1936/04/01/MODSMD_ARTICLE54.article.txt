# Our Hasher Sez:

Today is the day devoted to all the stooges who
don't get in on St. Patrick's Day, or Arbor Day, or
National Baker's Week, or the American Legion's
Fourth of July (under new management).
But authorities will tell you, and authorities never
miss, that the Day of the April Fool is gone. Now that
everyone has become an authority, people are no
longer fools, but anti-social phenomena.
Seeing that this old American tradition has faded,
I shall have to list the anti-social phenomena for
April. (Drain, refool, then listen.)
1. Doc Townsend, he now has a system where the
old age revolving pension revolves back to Doc Town
send.
2. Pop Coughlin, he has been popping off again.
3. Heil Hitler, many report that Hitler is pulling
another Fascist one.
4. Emperor Haiho Selassie, the Emperor has found
the Italian Balm-balms are keeping his warrior's
skin chapped, and is reported willing to cede Italy to
the League of Nations as a price of peace.
5. Mrs. F.D.R. —It was our wedding anniversary
todciy, so as a special treat we had mother for dinner.
Martha Graham, who is the modern Isadora Dun
can, who in her day was the feminine Nijinsky, who
in his day was the modern St. Vitus, is going to risk
her life on the Assembly Hall stage tomorrow night,
all to interpret American life to Stanford students,
who have never found out about it, because they come
from very fine homes and believe in the honor code.
Says Martha Graham: "As we begin to take more
and more honor in the interpretation of the American
scene, our dance takes deeper and deeper root . . .
America does not concern itself now with impression
ism. The psyche of the land is to be found in its
movement."
If La Graham can get the movement of a college
graduate being kicked out of an office while apply
ing for a job because the wife and kiddies are starving,
of a knock-kneed amateur hour amateur trying to
interpret Mae West, of a humor columnist thinking
up a really funny gag, of a muscle bound football play
er trying to scratch that back itch while hashing for a
tableful of lovely sorority girls, of a pawn shop mer
chant explaining the extreme cheapness of prices and
great value of the merchandise, then she may get a
little of some of the great American movements but,
of course, that would not be art.

3. Heil Hitler, many report that Hitler is pulling
another Fascist one.

the Italian Balm-balms are keeping his warrior's
skin chapped, and is reported willing to cede Italy to
the League of Nations as a price of peace.
5. Mrs. F.D.R. —It was our wedding anniversary
todciy, so as a special treat we had mother for dinner.
Martha Graham, who is the modern Isadora Dun
can, who in her day was the feminine Nijinsky, who
in his day was the modern St. Vitus, is going to risk
her life on the Assembly Hall stage tomorrow night,
all to interpret American life to Stanford students,
who have never found out about it, because they come
from very fine homes and believe in the honor code.
Says Martha Graham: "As we begin to take more
and more honor in the interpretation of the American
scene, our dance takes deeper and deeper root . . .
America does not concern itself now with impression
ism. The psyche of the land is to be found in its
movement."
If La Graham can get the movement of a college
graduate being kicked out of an office while apply
ing for a job because the wife and kiddies are starving,
of a knock-kneed amateur hour amateur trying to
interpret Mae West, of a humor columnist thinking
up a really funny gag, of a muscle bound football play
er trying to scratch that back itch while hashing for a
tableful of lovely sorority girls, of a pawn shop mer
chant explaining the extreme cheapness of prices and
great value of the merchandise, then she may get a
little of some of the great American movements but,
of course, that would not be art.
Today is the day devoted to all the stooges who
don't get in on St. Patrick's Day, or Arbor Day, or
National Baker's Week, or the American Legion's
Fourth of July (under new management).
But authorities will tell you, and authorities never
miss, that the Day of the April Fool is gone. Now that
everyone has become an authority, people are no
longer fools, but anti-social phenomena.
Seeing that this old American tradition has faded,
I shall have to list the anti-social phenomena for
April. (Drain, refool, then listen.)
