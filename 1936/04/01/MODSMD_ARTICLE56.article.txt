## AND DAVID LAMSON WILL NOT GO FREE 
### 
Under the law of the land David !
Lamson will probably go free April I
i 3, almost three years after he was !
! first charged with wife-murder, i
! n:iv i (I I jmsnn imm

j uavm j_.amaon
will then be able
• to vote, pay taxes,
I to own a home, to
Igo where he ,
pleases when he ■
j pleases.
But David Lam
! son, like anyone
| charged but not
j exonerated, will!
! never be free. A|
jury sentenced
; him to life im
nrisonment when

piisuiunt'iii wiivn
they couldn't decidc his guilt.
* * *
You and I and the man next
door are the wardens. The County
of Santa Clara will deliver Lamson
into our custody Friday and we will
take him as directed by a law unto
ourselves, a law that does not re
l' spect anyone in Lamson's position.
Though he has lived in a cell three
I years his imprisonment is just be
: ginning. His attorney asked that he
! be allowed to go home, tearfully
1 pleaded with his jury to let him raise
his daughter. But Lamson, like

' hundreds who have stood before the
I bar, can never go home because he
| has no home.
* * ♦
Whether or not we want it to be
| so, Lamson is no longer of us. Not
I because he murdered his wife, but
| because the district attorney of
Santa Clara County believed he did,
i he is forever an outlander.
His name, that not long ago fig
ured in the Quad and Daily with
hundreds of others, isn't like yours
or mine. Look at it—David Lamson
! —that's not a name, that's a book,
I a headline, a symbol.
If you saw him walking down
! University Avenue you'd turn back
j and whisper, "there he goes."
Everything about him has been
! splashed with notoriety. Even his
! old home is a curiosity.
* * *
] How can we say that Stanford will
! take Dave Lamson back? It is a
' pretty gesture, but it is a gesture.
! Dave Lamson knows that in a spe
■ cial and definite sense he can never
I come back here or anywhere.
| He must always stand apart. Even
j his livelihood must be a capitaliza
j tion of his own unique status.
