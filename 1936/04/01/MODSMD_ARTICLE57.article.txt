"LA MATERNELLF,," much
j touted French production, opens at
i the Clay International Theater in
San Francisco on Saturday, after a
j five months' run in New York. Di
i rected by the famous Jean Benoit
| Levy and Marie Epstein, this poig
! nant and appealing story concerns
| a little waif from Montmarte and the
1 love and understanding given her
I and her companions in a Day Nurs
ery in the Latin Quarter of Paris.
! For those who do not understand
j French, full English titles make the
] picture comprehensible.
SYLVIA LENT, American violin
j ist, will play for the first time before
j a San Francisco audience when Con-
I ductor Pierre Monteux presents her
| as guest soloist with the San Fran
! Cisco Symphony Orchestra at the
1 Opera House concert pair Friday af
; ternoon at 2:30 and Saturday night
; at 8:30 o'clock.
Miss Lent studied with Leopold
; Auer for six yeai's. She made her
| debut in Berlin in 1923 and has
filled frequent engagements in Eu
rope and the East. She will play the
Mozart Concerto in A major, Bach's
suite in B minor, and Bx-ahm's Sym
i phony No. 4 in E minor.
The five programs of EARLY

timers as "A Trip to the Moon,"
dated 1902; "Queen Elizabeth" with
Sarah Bernhardt, 1911; "The Cov
