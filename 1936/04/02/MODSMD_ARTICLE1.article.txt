# Danseuse To Give Recital Here Tonight
## Martha Graham Stresses Directness of Motion, Simplicity in Programs 
### 
"I always hope that new audiences
will not try to find specific stories in
my dances," says Martha Graham,
leading American danseuse, who
makes her first appearance at Stan
ford this evening in the Assembly
Hall at 8:20 o'clock.
Miss Graham does not believe in
hidden meanings. "Mine is the
language of the body," she declares.
"Movement itself speaks directly to
the audience.
New Music Featured
"If I raise my arm, I mean just
that: an arm being lifted, for what
ever emotional reason I intend. It
is not a tree growing or a reed in
the wind."
This evening's program, directed
by Louis Horst, America's principal
composer for the dance, contains
contemporary music which will be
heard for the first time on the pen
insula. Among Miss Graham's
numbers are two by Horst, his
famous "Frontier" and the "Build
ing Motif," both of which reflect the
pioneer spirit of the West. She will
introduce herself with Paul Nord
off's "Praeludium No. 1," a dance of
greeting, and end with the "Harle
quinade" by Ernst Toch.
Likes Plain People
Miss Graham is unique in her de
sire to perform before audiences of
plain people, and declares herself
more interested in their reactions
than in those of connoisseurs of the
dance. With this in mind she began
the transcontinental tour which in
cludes her performance on the
Farm,
Tickets for the recital, priced at
$1.65, $1.10, and 55 cents are on sale
at the Concert Series Office in the
Old Union, Keeble's in Palo Alto,
