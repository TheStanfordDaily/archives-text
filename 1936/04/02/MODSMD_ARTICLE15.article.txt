# Tahiti Selected As Ball Theme
## Women Committee Heads Named by Co-chairmen; Positions Still Available 
### Jim Hill 
From a smoke-filled committee
room in the A.S.S.U. offices plans
for the annual Masque Ball began
to assume definite shape. Sugges
tions, ranging from the romantic to
the grotesque, including among oth
er things the threat of a transformed
"pavilion" Animal Kingdom and a
Night-in-Venice.
Such past gems as a Night-in-
Hcll and Egyptian Dreams (Nubian
Slave, Walton) will pale into insig
nificance by the side of 1936's Night
in-Tahiti. Let's see Samoa!
Today, the committee heads will
adjourn to the Stanford Convales
cent Home to see for themselves
why Stanford has so loyally and
unfailingly supported this worthy
cause in the past. Chairman Gib
Holloway requests that Committee
heads meet in the A.S.S.U. offices at
3:30 for a brief discussion before the
tour of inspection.
Other news of interest was the
announcement of women's commit
tee heads by co-chairmen Ruth
Goodan and Peggy Sim. Chosen as
painting chairman was Mary Bab
son; yard chairman, Mary Lewis;
candy concession, Margaret Loud;
playground chairman, Maxine
Moore; ice-cream concession, Dulce
Parker; toys, Margaret Williams;
and strawberx-y brunch, Peggy
Woodard.
For those students who still cher
ish hopes of working on this year's
Drive, Chairman Gib Holloway an
nounces that he will be in the
A.S.S.U. offices every day from 2
to 4.
