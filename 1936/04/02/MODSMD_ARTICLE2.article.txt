# British Approve Reich Program
## Cabinet Considers Peace Proposals Favorably 
### 
LONDON, April 1 (iP).-A vir
tual British acceptance of many of
Reichsfluehrer Hitler's counter
proposals for safeguarding the peace
of Western Europe was indicated
in authoritative quarters tonight
after a day-long Cabinet discus
sion.
Acting with speed, the British let
it be known they regard the pro
posals as conciliatory, valuable and
worthy of negotiation, despite the
fact that Hitler has shown no peni
tence for his march into the Rhine
land nor has contributed much to
calm fears resulting from that ac
tion.
Officials here, however, appeared
to be dubious that the French and
Belgians would as quickly see merit
in Germany's suggestions.
Hitler's program was handed to
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
today by Joachim von Ribbentrop,
special German Ambassador, along
with an almost complete rejection
of the proposals France, Britain,
Belgium and Italy put forward a
fortnight ago.

Eden took the document before
the Cabinet. The Cabinet probably
will meet again tomorrow for a fur
ther discussion, while Eden sum
moned Von Ribbentrop for clarifica
tion of various points.
