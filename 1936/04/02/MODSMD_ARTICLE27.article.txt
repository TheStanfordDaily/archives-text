### George Veness 
Last night the Interfraternity
Council put the final stamp of ap
proval on the new rushing plan
which a special interfraternity com
mittee devised, and which has al
ready been passed by the Interfra
ternity Board and by Dr. Wilbur.
Creation of a more informal rela
i ing periods is the chief feature of
j tion between Row men and the
j frosh by means 01 week-end rush
| the new plan. Otherwise the "new"
rules are the same as were previ
ously held.
However, it is hoped that a plan
I for the enforcement of the rules can
;be developed by the arousal of a
j feeling of moral responsibility with
;in the houses themselves. A cam
paign of education regarding the
rules is to be carried on within the
: houses and by this means effect a
| personal response from house mem-
I bers.
To aid this plan, Bob Hoover,
j president of the council, suggested
i that creation of a better spirit and
i better feelings among the fraterni
! ties was of prime importance. A
program of interfraternity exchange
| dinners or an interfraternity "sing"
i was discussed. A committee, com
posed of Louis Bansbach, Alex Ber
ger, and Louis Mendelssohn, was
j appointed to consider ways and
1 means of creating better interfra
j ternity relationships.

| the new plan. Otherwise the "new"
rules are the same as were previ
ously held.

program of interfraternity exchange
