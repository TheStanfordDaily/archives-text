### Gray Creveling 
GUYS I D HATE TO BE:
Bruno Richard Hauptmann. He
gets a stay every now and then.
He is believed innocent by many.
Some think he would have confessed
by now if he had anything to con
fess. There is good reason to be
lieve him a misguided tool of some
"master mind."
Governor Hoffman of New Jersey,
fie tries to wash his hands of the
whole affair with little success.
David Lamson. Although he wrote
a successful book, he'll find peace
nowhere. Or his daughter.
Charles A. Lindbergh. He is
doomed to a life of a gold fish.
Harassed by his own countrymen, he
sc eks peace elsewhere, but, like
Lamson, will have to try Admiral
Byrd's cubby-hole in Little Amer
ica.
Edward VIII of England. He has
no privacy, either. Has to marry
some questionable blueblood like
Princess Julianna of the Nether
lands.
Thomas Mooney. Labor's martyr
; dmits the martyr business isn't
what it's cracked up to be.
Senator Black of Alabama. As a
result of his investigating, he .has
become the brunt of Hearstian
taunts and spite.
A Hearst editor who has to take it
and like it.
W. R. Hearst, himself. Whether
dncora or not, he lives in a world
lilled with boogaboos of his own
creation.
Marion Davies. For reasons.
Lawson Little. lie faces a re
juvenated Bobby Jones soon in the
Augusta Master's Tournament—
Jones' own tournament over the
course (hat he designed. Later
in the year he faces the world's
best again in the U.S. Open—the
toughest assignment of them all.
Lamson's relatives. They have
lortgaged their all to the hilt in
>yalty to Dave.
Woody Adams. He has scores of
jaming - at - the-mouth committee
len to deal with.
Adolf Hitler. Although he is able
> spellbind anyone, he is probably
he most univex*sally hated man in
he world. Outside of Russia there
re rrjany people who sit around for
n hour each day hating Stalin, too.
Martha Graham. She "is going to
isk her life on the Assembly Hall
tage" tonight, as Our Hasher sez,
death-defying act.
Bob Hoover. He is going to try
to engender a co-operative spirit
along the Row. Sincere in his
ideas, Bob plans a Row dance, an
interfraternity sing, exchange din
ners. More power to him.
One of Beltramo's eggs. They
ounce.
The Dionne Quints. The adver
sers will give them no peace dur
ig their entire lifetime. We, the
resent generation, will have to look
t their pictures on calendars, etc.,
>r the rest of our lives.
Miss Christine Ricker. She takes
beating from campus' columnists
nd communists.

GUYS I D HATE TO BE:
Bruno Richard Hauptmann. He
gets a stay every now and then.
He is believed innocent by many.
Some think he would have confessed

fess. There is good reason to be
lieve him a misguided tool of some
"master mind."
Governor Hoffman of New Jersey,
fie tries to wash his hands of the
whole affair with little success.
David Lamson. Although he wrote
a successful book, he'll find peace
nowhere. Or his daughter.
Charles A. Lindbergh. He is
doomed to a life of a gold fish.
Harassed by his own countrymen, he
sc eks peace elsewhere, but, like
Lamson, will have to try Admiral
Byrd's cubby-hole in Little Amer
ica.
Edward VIII of England. He has
no privacy, either. Has to marry
some questionable blueblood like
Princess Julianna of the Nether
lands.
Thomas Mooney. Labor's martyr

what it's cracked up to be.
Senator Black of Alabama. As a
result of his investigating, he .has

Lamson's relatives. They have
lortgaged their all to the hilt in
>yalty to Dave.
Woody Adams. He has scores of
jaming - at - the-mouth committee
len to deal with.
Adolf Hitler. Although he is able
> spellbind anyone, he is probably
