## 
### 
Positions on the technical staff of
the Barnstormers' musical show,
"Three Sheets to the Wind," will be
filled from a list of applicants sub
mitting their name to George Lin
dahl, dramatics manager, before
Sunday. Electricians and those in
terested in set construction are par
ticularly needed.
An unusual feature of the show
will be a full male chorus. Any
body who wants to direct that
should also see Lindahl.
