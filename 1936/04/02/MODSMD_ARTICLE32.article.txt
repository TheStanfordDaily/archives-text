Officers and students of the Stan
ford R.O.T.C. unit are working over
time in preparation for the annual
corps area inspection of college mili
tary units, which takes place Mon
day, April 13.
This year, Brig.-Gen. Sherwood E.
Cheney of the Ninth Coast Artil
lery District and his stall watch the
student soldiers as they pass in re

Honors Awarded
The annual inspections are an im
portant aid to the War Department
in rating local units for their effi
ciency. Since the inauguration of
this system. Stanford has rated "ex
cellent" every year.
The review provides the occasion
for the awarding of various honors
to deserving cadets. Among the
most coveted in the artillery depart
ment are the Walters Awards, given
to those three seniors highest
ranking in military worjc at Stan
ford. The Ordnance Department
honors its two highest ranking stu
dents with the Army Ordnance
Scholarship keys, awarded on a
basis of excellence in classwork.
Prepare for Review
In preparation for the review, the
outstanding R.O.T.C. event of the
year at Stanford, a specially aug
mented Monday drill class is ma
neuvering several extra hours per
week in order 1o present a polished
appearance.
Tactics will not vary considerably
from those reviewed with favorable
comment last year by Maj.-Gen.
Paul B. Malone. The "army" will go
through all the motions of civilized
warfai'e; imaginary shots will be
fired; horses will draw cannon and
caissons through mud, real or imag
inary; student officei's will bark or
ders at buck privates who will
"prepare for action," perform "col
umn left into line," and "halt" with
all the grim purposefulness of a
major campaign.
