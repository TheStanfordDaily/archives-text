The Editor, Sir:
The present crisis over the Stan
ford Honor Code surely deserves the
serious consideration of the student
body. We have a certain pride in
being a member of the University
which has its name.

Stanford stands for good sports
manship and superiority in ath
letics as well as in academic work.
If we lack intellectual integrity
the news will travel fast. Some
thing must be done in impressing
on the students the fact that this
is a matter of self-protection for
them, and it is their code to make
or break.
Feeling confident that the type of
student who has made for Stanford
a good name in the past is still here.
I am sure the Honor System can be
made to work if we give it another
chance.
More Specific
But shouldn't we be more specific
and exact about both its rules and
enforcement? In the first place all
things which belie its existence
should be completely wiped out.
This means no yellow books, alter
nate seats on exams, and such in
consistencies. Secondly, we should
analyze the features we want in our
code. Only the consensus of opinion
can make a law anyhow. Not mei'e
indifference but active condemna
tion of any unfair conduct should
exist.
If you are really mad about the
way some things are going isn't if
up to you to do something to help
improve matters? You aren't tat
tling—you are breaking down your
own side of the Code if you do not
help to enforce it. "Noblesse oblige."

Then only such features should be j
included in the Code which infringe
on our integrity. Only important
matters such as cheating and plag
iarism, for example, which are ac- !
cepted without question as being
generally harmful. Social and other
regulations should be handled on an
entirely different plan. Anything
which is a disputable matter should j
be excluded, for we must have pure
matters of honesty enforced above J
all else.
University Co-operation
Then if there is some trouble the
university must be behind the stu- !
dents to enforce the penalty, abso- 1
lutely and immediately. Any breach
of such a code is an action unworthy
of a Stanford man or woman. And
the University's name must be held
with respect among outsiders as well
as ourselves.
I would suggest that when some
such modifications to the present
Code were made that it should be
presented to the faculty and Ad
ministration for acceptance if they
agree to support the plan. Stanford
need not fear that her moral stahd
ard will go down.
But if the administration cannot j
approve fully of our method, they
should be given complete control to
reinstate a proctor system or what
ever they find necessary. It will '
then be entirely their affair to main
tain the academic honor of the Uni
sity.
The problem of enforcing the !
Honor Code or some moral discipline
is the joint responsibility of faculty
and students. But with a few points
of modification to limit the scope and j
emphasize the importance of the j

code, can't we build up a pride
which will stamp any graduate for
his honesty and character?
