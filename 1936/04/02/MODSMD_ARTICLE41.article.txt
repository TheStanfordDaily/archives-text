# Creamer Gives Approval Of VFW Program
## Establishment of Campus Chapter Urged by Head Of Affairs Committee 
### 
Interviewed lust night on the
question of the establishment of a
Stanford chapter of the "Veterans of
Future Wars" and an auxiliary
"Home Fire Division," which move
ments are rapidly sweeping the col
leges of the country, Dick Creamer,
chairman of Committee on National
and Student Affairs, voiced his com- |
plete approval of the plan.
"No one is so deserving of a bonus
as the men who are going to die in
the next war," Creamer said.
"To pay each of these men now
$1000 plus 3 per cent interest com
pounded over tiie next 30 years
would afford the opportunity of en
joying a bonus to many deserving
young men who will never live
through the next war to get one in
the usual way. What could be more
lilting?
Need Money Now
"If these men could get the money
right away, as is proposed, they
would have it at a time when they
need it most, just when they are
starting out into the business world.
"Tlie proposal that our college
women members of the 'Home Fire j
Division' should travel abroad to '
visit the future graves of their bus- j
bands and children is excellent.
Profitc crs Co-ope rat e
"Concerning the proposed organ- |
ization 'Profiteers of Future Wars,' [
which would demand immediate '
payments of excess profits from fu- i
ture wars, I can see no reason why !
it shouldn't co-operate with the |
VFW. Past wars have shown us ;
that there is a striking similarity J
between the aims of these two pro- j
posed organizations.
"The question of forming Stanford ]
chapters will be brought before my j
committee on Monday night. Rec- j
ommendations will be considered by ■
Ex Committee Tuesday.
"Oh, yes, about the pledge of the I
Hearst Post of the VFW at the Uni- [
versity of Idaho to 'stamp out, the |
subversive elements in our schools j
and colleges' in deference to the |
'virile, red-blooded publisher,' I !
have a brief suggestion. I propose
a tax of 1 per cent on the bonuses of
the VFW to provide a fund to in
vestigate the subject. Or perhaps !
just to investigate the 'virility and |
red blood' of the publisher."

"Oh, yes, about the pledge of the I
Hearst Post of the VFW at the Uni- [
versity of Idaho to 'stamp out, the |
subversive elements in our schools j
and colleges' in deference to the |
'virile, red-blooded publisher,' I !
have a brief suggestion. I propose
a tax of 1 per cent on the bonuses of
the VFW to provide a fund to in
vestigate the subject. Or perhaps !
just to investigate the 'virility and |
red blood' of the publisher."
Interviewed lust night on the
question of the establishment of a
Stanford chapter of the "Veterans of
Future Wars" and an auxiliary
"Home Fire Division," which move
ments are rapidly sweeping the col
leges of the country, Dick Creamer,
chairman of Committee on National
and Student Affairs, voiced his com- |
plete approval of the plan.
"No one is so deserving of a bonus
as the men who are going to die in
the next war," Creamer said.
"To pay each of these men now
$1000 plus 3 per cent interest com
pounded over tiie next 30 years
would afford the opportunity of en
joying a bonus to many deserving
young men who will never live
through the next war to get one in
the usual way. What could be more
lilting?
Need Money Now
"If these men could get the money
right away, as is proposed, they
would have it at a time when they
need it most, just when they are
starting out into the business world.
"Tlie proposal that our college
women members of the 'Home Fire j
Division' should travel abroad to '
visit the future graves of their bus- j
bands and children is excellent.
Profitc crs Co-ope rat e
"Concerning the proposed organ- |
ization 'Profiteers of Future Wars,' [
which would demand immediate '
payments of excess profits from fu- i
ture wars, I can see no reason why !
it shouldn't co-operate with the |
VFW. Past wars have shown us ;
that there is a striking similarity J
between the aims of these two pro- j
posed organizations.
