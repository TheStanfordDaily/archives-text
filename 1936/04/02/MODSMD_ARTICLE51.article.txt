# Harvard Invites Farm Students
## Tercentenary To Be Held In East This Summer 
### 
Stanford, together with over 500
other universities throughout this I
country and abroad, was invited to
send two undergraduates to the
Harvard Tercentenaiy Celebration I
to be held in Cambridge September I
IG, 17, and 18.
In calling attention of the Asso- j
dated Students to the commemora
t
tory ceremony, President Ray Ly
man Wilbur termed it "the most'
interesting opportunity for one or
two Stanford undergraduates that is
apt to be offered for some years."
Rather than send two students
across the continent on A.S.S.U. j
funds, Wilbur suggested that stu- ,
dents who will be in the East at the
time be chosen as representatives j
and that a small contribution be ;
made to their expenses to give the j
selection ollicial color.
A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke j
asks that all students who will be i
in the vicinity at the time, and who j
would be interested in acting as
Stanford representatives, come to
his office and discuss the matter.
