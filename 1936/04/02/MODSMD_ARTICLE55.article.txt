# IS IT REPRESENTATIVE?
## 
### 
j The Editor, Sir:
It goes without saying that The
Daily's Honor Code ballot admirably
covers the provocative points, but j
| will student answers to the ques
tions be representative and truth-
I ful?
First there's the problem of
i samplingâ€”getting a true cross
section of the student body. It's a
I highly uncertain process at best, but
! completely uncontrolled in the hap
| hazard "vote or not" system which
I the Daily plans to use.
Then this business of answer
! significance; isn't it more reason
l able to suppose that voters will give
[ "right" answers rather than true
answers? People tend to say not
j what they actually have done and
| will continue to do, but what they
[ think they should do.
To be carefully considered, in
I view of recent wholesale violations
' of the code, are the answers of those

inclined to cheating, who view the
Honor Code as a protection for their
dishonesty. For the Code, designed
to spare the feelings of those who
observe it, is a Godsend to those
who violate it.
