Boh O'Bi ion, St. Mary's Hurler,
had too much on the ball for Indian
hitters yesterday, limiting them to
four hits while his mates were bat
tering the horsehide for fourteen
hits and an 8-3 victory.
This was the first appearance of
the Cards this quarter and their
first contest with the league-leading
Gaels on the local diamond.
For the first four innings it was a
tijuht tussle, and at the end of that
time the Cards were leading 3-1. In
the fifth and sixth, however, the
Gaels succeeded in turning six hits
into as many runs and took a lead
which Stanford could not overcome.
Dick Armstrong started on the
mound for the Indians, but was re
lieved in the sixth inning by How
ard Paine, who finished the game.
Leo Heagerty was behind the bat.
Both teams played good ball in
the field, only two errors being
chalked up against Stanford and
three against St. Mary's. Heagerty
led Indian hitters wilh a triple and
a single, while Johnny Trutta of the
visitors came through with a home
run and a double. Every one of the
Gaels got at least one hit.
