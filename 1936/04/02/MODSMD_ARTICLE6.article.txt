# Comedy Named For Spring Play
## 'Once in a Lifetime' To Be Drama Group Reading 
### 
"Once in a Lifetime" by George
S. Kaufman and Moss Hart was se
lected yesterday at a luncheon
meeting of Sword and Sandals to be
the first reading of the spring
quartei\
Dick Dawson, director of this
reading, announced that tryouts will
be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock
in the Little Theater and tomorrow
at 1 o'clock. Inasmuch as the play it
self is a lively and entertaining
satire about Hollywood involving
more than 20 players, he is hoping
for a large turnout.
"We need as many women tryout
ees as men," asserted Dawson.
"There are 10 good women's parts;
I would like to be able to choose
from double this number."
Dawson particularly urged that
all tryoutees bring copies of the
play if possible.
