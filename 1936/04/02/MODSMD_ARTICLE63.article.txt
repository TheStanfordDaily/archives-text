## 
### Phil Klauber 
To local track enthusiasts there
will be a big homecoming next Sat- j
urday afternoon—the 193G Temple
ton-Ellington machine goes to work
in its front yard for the season's
home opener.
Coach Charley Hunter of the •
Olympic Club brings his powerful
bunch of students, businessmen,
and loafers down to give the new
Angell Field its dual meet baptism, 1
and the Cardinal cindermen go out
to show the home folks the wares i
they have sported at three San :
Francisco indoor meets, at Fresno !
State, and at Washington.
Club Optimistic
Stanford's runners will feel vic
torious if they garner 50 points, oth- i
er than the customary (iG. All be
cause the Winged O'.s, in Olympic
year strength, have been doped all
week not only to defeat Stanford, j
but to whitewash her quite some
what.
Against the world we say that
Smith, Levy, Reynolds and Weier
shauser are against no greater than
2 to 1 to cop the high jump, discus,
shot, and quarter mile, with luck, 1
and performing at home as they
are.
Seconds May Help
Which leaves Bright in both dis
tances, Eiastman in the 880, Mauger
and Garret in the pole vault, Clark
in the broad jump, and Mot tram in
the javelin as the club's six cinch
firsts.
Stanford's hopes bank on Klop
stock, sprinters Dean and Voigt, the
2 to 1 boys listed above, and maybe ,!

a relay win. All of Nimmo, Bur
rows, Hershey, Malott, Cranston,
Kellogg, and Kneubuhl, stand sure
to get into the second and third
place money and may pile in the
points.
