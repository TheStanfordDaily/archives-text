# Bobby Grayson Ben Winkelman Start Duties
## New Members of Coaching Staff Help Tiny To Build 1936 Grid Team 
### 
Bobby Grayson and Ben Winkel
man slipped on moleskins, spikes,
and sweatshirts yesterday afternoon
and trotted out on the frosh football
field to help Headman Tiny Thorn
hill-build a football team.
ft was the first coaching day for
the lormer pair, just as it was the
first get-together of seme three
score athletes who will man next
fall's Big Red Machine.
Few Vets Left
Gone were the nine Cocky Sopho
mores, later the Successful Seniors,
leaving only Jimmy Coffts, Bill
Paulman, Dave Cuneo, Pop Grant,
Carl Schott, Earl lloos, and a few
others who have seen much var
sity experience, to become the nu
cleus of veterans.
Not in suits were Fred Williams,
an outstanding contender for Gray
son's key man position, who will not
be sufficiently recovered from a
tonsilectomy until Monday; Joe
Vigna, unaccounted for since the
rugby trip to Canada; Pete Zagar,
touted frosh tackle who is playing
spin the platter with the frosh track
team; Bob Matthews, leggy guard,
now employed as a baseball player.
Kun Pass Plays
Thornhill spent most of the after
noon running teams through a sim
ple pass formation, using the day
chiefly as a kink-looser and a re
union of players with the workout
routine.
Outstanding was the number of
new faces mingling with the old
heads. Among the foreign visages
were several picked junior college
transfers who are as yet sleepers
in the actual doping of first team
rosters. With a few weeks of spring
practice, however, they will become
better known and figured on as con
tenders for the varsity, on which
there are nine or so positions wide
open for claimants.
