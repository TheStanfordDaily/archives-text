For those who are initiated, and
who scorn the ordinary dry-land
lubberish sports, there is still a bit
of snow on the ground up in the
High Sierras—higher, at any rate,
than 1500 feet elevation.
Thanks to a series of generous
flurries over the spring vacation,
there is still about 10 feet on the
hills near Norden and the Auburn
ski slopes, and almost as much at
Barged Pass, just below Glacier
Point, for the Yosemite visitors.
Last year Californians skied
way into June, and the Lord and
everybody's cousin knows that
there has been more weather this
winter than last, so some of the
more zealous are already plan
ning summer vacation ski trips.
At any rate, these nice week-ends
should see a goodly number of Stan
fords up in the altitudes practicing
their christies, with a good part of
their bodies exposed to the scorch
ing snowburn on sunny days. Plenty
of them went up last quarter, and 75
per cent of the guests at the Norden
Sierra Club lodge over spring vaca
tion week were from the Farm.

Some of the locals are pretty
darned agile on the planks and know
how to stop when they come to a
precipice or turn skillfully when a
tree comes tearing up the hill at
them.
Some can slide a while without
falling down, and others just can't
stand up, go up, or come down with
out making a huge and dangerous
bathtul?, or sfitz mark in the snow
when they fall down.

christie to right or left at a rea
sonable speed, this column has no
I word. They are out of the run
; cf-the-mill class and really rare in
California.
But if you can't stop or turn with
out using your nose for a brake, here
are a few good old pointers.
Stop by using a

on which way you want to turn,
out and at an oblique angle to the
other one, put your weight on
the oblique one, then step around
and you sail oIT at right angles.
For perfect control learn the
"Christiania," or christie, which is
used to either stop, turn, or check

There are about 115 schools of

Two things more—ski jumping and
