# Tennis Coach Says Varsity To Beat Bears
## Indians Show Strength In Most Matches; Bennett, Newton Play for Cal 
### 
Sherman Lockwood, who guides
the destinies of the Stanford tennis
team which meets California on the
Berkeley courts this afternoon, is no
pessimist. In fact, quoting him di
rectly: "We should win from Cal
seven matches to two, and have a
possible chance to whitewash them."
There are six sturdy Stanford fel
lows who are largely responsible
for having Mr. Lockwood entertain
this optimistic belief. Johnny Law,
Indian captain, will play first sin
gles against Bennett of the Bears.
Ben Dey will represent the red
skins in second singles in a clash
with Paul Newton, another Blue and
Gold ac 3.
Other matches find Porr.mer (S)
piaying Coulthard (C), Seward (S)
vs. Tanaka (C), Braly (S) vs. Mas
sie (C), Underwood (S) vs. Schwarz
(C) who also is a member of Stub
Allison's football crew.
The boys from the Campanile
country boast the national inter
collegiate champions in doubles,
Bennett and Newton. Dey and
Pommer will be on the other side of
the net against the title-holding pair
this afternoon. Braly and Under
wood (S) piay Coulthard and Mas
sie (C) in second doubles, while
Law and Braly (S) clash with
Schwartz and Tanaka in third
doubles.
Dan Clark will accompany the
boys from the Farm as an alternate,
hoping to see some action.
The local courts will be the scene
of the Stanford-Cal frosh tennis
battles next Friday. A strong squad
is reported to be wearing the Cali
fornia yearling colors, and the Cubs,
led by ImhofT, are favorites to win.
Jack Erhart, Jack Laney, Malcolm
Black, Sherwood Armstrong, Phil
Griffith, and Don Bohr compose
Stanford's well - balanced squad,
which is however lacking in out
standing stars.
