# Bruno Granted New Reprieve By Warden
## Hauptmann's Execution In Doubt as Jury Debates Wendel Affair Decision 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., April 1 (/P).—
Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who has
lived beyond three of his death
dates, faced a new one tonight —
Friday night at 8 o'clock—but under
cond-K'bns which made it extremely
doubtful he would die even then for
the Lindbergh baby murder.
Col. Mark O. Kimberling, state
prison warden, moved the death
time back a day later than was
asked by the Mercer County (Tren
ton) Grand Jury, whose unexpected
intervention halted the execution on
the hour set for it last night.
Failure of the Grand Jury to
reach a decision by Friday night
in the strange case of Paul Wen
del, held on a murder charge for
the same crime which condemned
Hauptmann, would bring a still
further delay, Kimberling said.
He was faced on the one hand
by a court mandate requiring him
to have Hauptmann put to death
during the current week, and on
the other by the prospect that an
other man might be indicted for the
same crime.
If the dilemma is not solved by
Saturday night, Kimberling said
he would seek advice from Su
preme Court Justice Thomas W.
Trenchard, who signed Hauptmann's
death warrant, on whether the
"week of March 30" for which he
fixed the execution, ends Saturday
or Sunday midnight.
