Stanford is to be represented in
the Olympic tryuuts in the East,
not as a school but by several stars
who have been invited to join dif
ferent athletic teams, clubs, or are
freelancing.
Winfield Needham, captain of the
freshman water polo team and crack
distance swimmer, is the only par
ticipant that Stanford as a school
hopes to send back. He will try out
in the 1500-nu'ter race if the B.A.C.
approves.
Bob Haslacher, unanimously voted
all-conference water polo guard,
will definitely go back as a member
of the Westwood All-Stars, made up
of the U.C.L.A. conference winners
plus guest players.
Jerry Bowen, Card Pacific Coast
Junior champion, has left for New
York where on April 29 he will
with the outstanding fenc
ers of the United States for a berth
on the U.S. fencing team.
The other Stanford swimmer who
hopes to represent the L.A.A.C. in
the 100-meter tryouts is Jack Vi
