## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily Co-operation Through Criticism" Today's Poll Is Fair, Unbiased Attempt To Get Student Reaction to Honor Code 
### 
If the Honor (lode is to he a success, it must
rest upon wholehearted student support of it
ns a system.
For this reason, Tin: Daily, in co-operation
with and with (he advice of the Men's and
Women's Councils and Ex Committee, is con
ducting today's informal Honor Code poll in
the Union Cellar.
Shorn of the sentimentality, emotionalism,
and the ethical implications of the word "hon
or," the students know the Honor ('ode as an
administrative device intended to assure a fair
return on each student's grade investment.
II il has failed as an administrative device,
only the students know it, and only the stu
dents can show it.
The Honor Code is no instrument of the
faculty. It is a device instituted for the stu
dents. 11 they think it effective il is effective.
If they give it grudging support it is a failure.

| Part of the questions of the poll are to de-
I (ermine student reaction to the Onde, others
| are to determine just what direction the stu
dent groups may take in improving the Code
j as an administrative device.
No special claims are advanced for the aceu
| racy of the poll. If it is large il may imply
i certain interpretations of the results of the
i vote. If it is small, it may imply others. Its
; value, then, will lie in the focusing of student
| attention to the activity and the cerebration
| it will cause among student leaders who are
i attempting to interpret the results.
! That the poll will he fair, may he assumed
from the fact that there are no vested interests
1 involved. No one is trying to prove anything,
i No one is going to secure an unfair advantage
i over anyone else. It is a fact-linding poll,
j There should he no ballot shilling. Hemem
| her: it is conducted under the Honor Code.
