## On Cribbing 
### 
(from The Daily Mini)
Although differing on the severity of punishment
needed and the methods of enforcing the rules, the
faculty was almost unanimous in its condemnation of
the present situation in regards to "cribbing" or
cheating at examinations.
That same statement can be made about the student
body at large. Students, taken as a whole, do not like
the cribber and believe that the act of cheating in order
to get a grade is vicious and should be ended.
♦ * * t
There are a great many proposals and remedies
.suggested for the abolition of the practice. A closer
proctoring might be helpful although in the long run
such an attitude will not end cheating but rather sup
press it. Many feel that a more severe treatment of
offenders might go far toward preventing cribbing.
But perhaps the most fundamental approach to
the evil was the statement made by F. S. Siebert,
assistant professor of journalism, who said that "Exam
inations should be so constructed that they make
cribbing ineffective."
* * * *
An examination should examine intelligence rather
than parrot-mindedness. If the faculty really desires to
end cribbing it must look at its own mistakes at the
same time it looks at the students' errors.
Students will show a decided disfavor towards
anyone who cheats on someone who is playing fair with
them and they will play fair with the faculty member
who does so with them. But if (hey feel that they
are being taken advantage of they will throw their
scruples to the wind and fight back in the same way.
