# Finances Not the Issue In Libe Controversy
## 
### 
The announcement that the library can
not be kept open Sunday night because of
finances still doesn't relieve the* fundamental
problem.
If the library were closed on Friday nights,
it would have the funds to open on Sunday
nights. But Sunday opening is opposed by
several graduate schools on the grounds that
the graduates wish to study on Friday nights.
There has been some question as to
whether graduates are human or not, but it
is note entirely unreasonable to assume that
graduates are tired of the week's grind by
Friday night and are ready to begin the aca
demic battle on Sunday night again, like ordi
nary mortals.
A walking tour of the library on Friday
nights shows that there is no great body of
either graduates or undergraduates studying
there at that time. But a survey of the library
taken on Sunday night a week before the
height of final-week studying showed a large
number of both.
