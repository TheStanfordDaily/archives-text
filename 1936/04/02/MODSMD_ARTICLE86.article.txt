Wring the Bell is the economic theory of the con
spirators of the coin box. As long as it is a telephone
monopoly that is being gypped, college youth is will
ing to gyp it.
One of the examples of the quaint gypsy life was a
certain bold sovil who used to delight his aged mother
by phoning home every night long distance. His
mother considered it' very thoughtful of him, and it
was. He was full of thoughts on the effect of metal
slugs on bells, silver bells. Every time he wished to
phone he dropped one of his little numismatic tokens
coined in the ratio of 16-1 down the phone slot (16
coins for one penny, no tax).
This system has proven quite effective, so effective
in fact that there is a law promising a penny-temporary
term in some Federal con-box for anyone caught with
out the goods.
Its effectiveness, however, is limited to druggery
phones. The pay phones in fraternity houses make
the system extravagant on house bills, for the tele
phone company charges the house for every call of
the wild, and the house manager in his usual sneak
ing manner, runs the slugger to earth.
There are two schools of gyppery that have grown
up in response to this sentimentalism. One is the
coughing coffer, and the other is the satisfaction
grunted on your ice pack school.
The first is the development of the t.b. or not t.b.
idea. The huskies stand and hawk before the phone
when the operator asks them to "deposit the coin,
please. It. requires a peculiar form of cough in order
to make it sound right, a cough half-way between
bronchitis and double pneumonia, and death from
natural causes.
For brothers who wish to live and lung, though,
Chemistry and Science have come to aid. By a process
of super-freezing of liquids, the brothers can de
velop a pellet that sounds just like Edgar Allan Poo
on a xylophone when deposited, but thaws out, leav
ing nothing more than a spot of rust for the collector
when he calls around.
I suggest that the telephone company write ils
Senator immediately.
