## ACTS OF GOD AND ITCHING PALMS 
### 
LONGVIEW, Wn„ April I.—This :
i*egular customer didn't show up in
the Ad building Monday morning
ready with a $115 check to buy an-

other 15 units of
education. Ci r -
cumstances de
prived him of the
incomparable ex
perience of walk
ing into that bar
gain basement at
mosphere to el
bow and shove
his way up to the
H to P counter
and watch the
lady with the
"gimme it" left

hand and fast-stamping right fist
! swing into action.
* * *
But nobody missed this customer.
Enough others showed to ring the j
register by something less than j
$400,000 and make the Farm's treas- j
ury department forget about the;
| absentees for the moment. But j
| those counted among the missing i
! are well provided for. A sliding >
j scale of fines which makes a stu- '
dent increasingly valuable t*he
longer he postpones registering is in !
! effect and it will nick your agent j
1 just 10 stone when he pulls in next j
! Monday.
* * *
Now this tardiness fine is waived j
j if an act of God is involved. At least j
so they say. But just what is this j
| constant reference to the activities I
' of the Deity? There's no definition \
j in the frosh bible, the founding I
1 grant, or the Bawlout, so the whole j
| thing must be in somebody's mind, j
i One way of finding out what isn't j
! an act of God is to apply for per- I

mission to miss an Econ ex, take a
leave of absence, take exams ahead
of time, or register late sans fine.
Somewhere in the higher levels is a
person or committee or court of
judgment which seems capable of
turning down any petition that
doesn't involve fire, flood, death, or
pestilence.
* * *
This Bull Sexsioner's reason for
being a week late is pretty fair as
reasons go, but when it is presented
in a kind of half-hopeful timid
voice next week, the anticipatory
feel of $10 in somebody's palm is
going to make somebody decide it
was not perpetrated by the Lord.
Come to think of it, viewing the
Farm collectively as only one can
from 700 miles off, the whole place
seems afflicted with that chronic
itchiness.
t * *
What about that $24 it cost to
| take three quarters of unwanted ele
; mentary French. What about that
js3 charge by the library when
j someone lifted a sickly, worn-out
history book right in the libe's own
' reading room—and the dollar fine
for keeping a reserve book out a
few hours late. What about the $8
| charge for breaking things in En
| cina when I never so much as broke
| a light bulb. And what about the
j high cost of Bookstore books, Union
| food, golf course green fees, senior
| balls and junior proms, the Quad,
j syllabus fees, and Co-op food. May
j be it's all justified, but somehow,
i back of it all, that same itchiness
I seems to prevail.
* * *
Just thinking about it makes a
j stay-awayc'i* almost want to con-
I tinue to stay away.

; Besides there's a police judge
down in Sunnyvale who just can't I
wait to get his itchy hands on $10
he says I have to pay for the privi- I
lege of violating California's gem of j
| legislation—the 45-r.iile speed law. I

being a week late is pretty fair as
reasons go, but when it is presented
in a kind of half-hopeful timid
voice next week, the anticipatory
feel of $10 in somebody's palm is
going to make somebody decide it
was not perpetrated by the Lord.
Come to think of it, viewing the
Farm collectively as only one can

seems afflicted with that chronic
itchiness.

js3 charge by the library when

history book right in the libe's own
' reading room—and the dollar fine
for keeping a reserve book out a
few hours late. What about the $8
