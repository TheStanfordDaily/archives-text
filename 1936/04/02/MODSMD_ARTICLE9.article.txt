# Cardinals Prove Big Activity Promoters
## 
### Allen Drury 
They're behind the funny man
with the megaphone. They're the
custodians of that new Stanford tra
dition, "The Big Red Toboggan."
They're the la.st representatives of
the "Stanford spirit,!' and proud of
it. Ladies and gentlemen — The
Cardinals.
Does the campus want an after
game dance? The Cardinals will
manage it, as they did for U.C.L.A.
and Santa Clara fall quarter. Is a
crucial contest coming up? The
Cardinal* will furnish stickers,
stunts, and speakers, as they did be
fore the big red toboggan slid over
Washington.
Founded Two Years Ago
To paraphrase a popular song
that had something to do with the
British, "Oh, look around no mat
ter where—you'll find that the
Cardinals are there."
Founded two years ago by Stan
Beaubaire, the organization has
rapidly become one of the most im
portant on the campus. Under the
chairmanship of Will Eisner the
Cards last year made a tremendous
success of the Convalescent Home
Drive, and ure promising to repeat
this year under the direction of Gib
Holloway.
They have complete control over
this all-campus function, the or.iy
restriction being that Ex Committee

| mast approve the choice of commit
tee heads.
Sponsor Washington Campaign
Arranging for practice rallies be
fore the Washington game, and the
subsequent campaign which includ
ed stickers and speakers and a send
ofT for the team, were among the ac
tivities of the Cardinals during foot
ball season.
The Axe Ceremonial, the Big
Game Rally and Bonfire, and the
Daily's attack on the B.A.C. ticket
policy were all sponsored by the
Cardinals.
Supply High School Speakers
It is not realized by the campus at
large that many peninsula high
schools often ask for Stanford
speakers. The special high school
assembly committee is directed by
ihe Cardinals. Then there is the
matter of greeting and entertaining
visiting celebrities, another activity
run by the group.
Cardinals are found literally in
every school activity. Chairman
Dick Stark yields his post as Head
Yell Leader to a fellow-Cardinal,
Webb Jones. Phil Coghlan is Men's
Rally Chairman and Dottie Sweet
is Women's Rally Chairman. Cardi
nal Wally Brooke is president of the
Associated Students, and Gib Hol
loway is this year's Convalescent
I Home Drive Chairman.
