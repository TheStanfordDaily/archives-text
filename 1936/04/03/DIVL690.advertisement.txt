Culottes
For Sports
CULOTTES—divided skirts to
you—come as a boon to women
golfers who have hesitated to
wear shorts on conservative golf
courses yet long for the freedom
of movement these costumes af
ford their tennis-playing sisters.
Allowing perfect case and com
fort, one, two, or three-piece
culottes are apropos for any
sports occasion. They are avail
able in both cottons and flannels
at The Clothes Closet.
DENIM PLAY TOGS are an
other new sports wrinkle The
Clothes Closet is featuring. In
expensive and smart, they come
in all shapes and colors. For in
formal horseback riding, con
ventional navy Jeans, called
Lady Levi's and made to fit,
make an ideal costume when
combined with a hill-billy shirt.
