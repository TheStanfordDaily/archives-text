# Students Uphold Code 447 Ballot In Daily's Poll
## Student Government Officials Issue Statements On Results of Ballots 
### 
Student government officials, with i
whose sanction The Daily's poll of ;
sentiment on the Honor System was j
conducted yesterday, issued the
following statements at a late hour
last night.
PAT FLAVEL, Chairman of Wom
en's Council: "The poll indicates
that at least a part of the student j
body is actively interested in what
is done to or with the Honor Code.
"We have read the comments car
ried on the ballots, and have ob
tained information which will un- [
doubtedly aid in our inquiry.
"If students maintain during the |
next week the interest shown in '
The Daily's poll, the Code problem
should be solved in the near fu
ture."
GIB HOLLOWAY, Chairman of
Men's Council: "This poll, if really
indicative of student opinion, shows !
that the students really want the
Honor Code to be continued, but are
uncertain as to how it is to be en
forced.
"I appreciate the sentiment of J
those who would hesitate to report a j
violator, but I absolutely believe a j
student should speak to, or warn, a
fellow student whom he believes to
be cheating.
"The Honor Code is the business
of everyone of us, and only by mak- |
ing its enforcement our business will
it be effective in the future."
WALLY BROOKE. A.S.S.U. Pres
ident: "Is it valid to infer that the
trouble with the Honor Code at
Stanford comes from the hesitancy
and refusal of three-fourths of the
student body to report a cheater in
examinations, although by a vote of
409 to 29 they showed their favor of
the Code's continuation?"
"Or is it the type of grading sys- i
tem and examinations which point !
out the way of cheating to the weak- !
willed or lazy student? I believe
that Ex Committee and the Councils
through their power to regulate
forms of student conduct must first j
find some means to educate the re- '
luctant student to the fact that he
must report a cheater.
"That is as much a part of the
Code as is the individual's honesty." !
