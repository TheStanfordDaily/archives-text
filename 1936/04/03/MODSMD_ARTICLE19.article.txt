# Students Offer Suggestions In Daily Poll
## 
### 
Interspersed with answers to di
rect questions on ballots in The
Daily's Honor Code poll yesterday
were individual comments regard
ing practically every phase of the
system's principles and operation.
Because these remarks reflected
a representative vein of student
thought. The Daily herewith pre
sents a portion of them, selected at
random:
"I have had experience with both
! the Honor and Proctor Systems,
and despite its faults, the former
is much preferable." . . . "Despite
violations, the proctor system
would cause more trouble by its
i seeming license."
"Retain the system, by all
means!" ... "I believe firmly the
Honor Code should he kept—be
cause there would be just as much
and more cheating if it were aban
doned; why give up the last tradi
tion?" . . . "It should be put up
to the students better.*'
"In four years I have never seen
a violation, so help me!" . . . "New
j students, especially junior trans
fers, should be taught what the
Code means." . . . "Tighten up,
new students, frosh and transfers
arc the worst offenders."
"I was once flunked in a course
for reporting to the professor that
a certain athlete and his fraternity
brothers had cheated in an exami
nation. But I still favor the Honor
i System — with faculty co-opera
! tton."
|
"There must he sonic way of
i reporting violations without pub
lishing names, unless the charges
are denied. Details enough could
he given to indict, as a rule, if the
I student had a guilty conscience.
i
"There should he stronger and
j constant emphasis on personal
' honor."
"To have examinations in which
no one would cheat, a proctor
I system is absolutely necessary."
"Eliminate grades and quit
worrying about it. . . . The Honor
Code is O.K. but professors make
mistrust of students much too ob
vious."
"Proctors would be a great help
j to class averages."
