Landslide for Continuing
In reply to the query, "Do you
favor continuation of the Honor

affirmative, against 29 in the nega
tive. Sponsors of the poll last night
interpreted this tabulation as a defi
nite trend toward solution of the
Code controversy.
Balloting on other questions re
vealed by a 336 to 84 majority that
the voters would not report viola
tions of the Honor System, but that
they would aid, if possible, observ
ance of the Code. Results of the
latter point gave an affirmative mar
gin of 197 votes.
Pledge Not Superfluous
The question "Do you think the
Honor Code is working effectively?"
brought a 295 to 140 favorable re
ply, and to "Do you consider the

148 votes yes, and 293 no.
A 347 to 75 majority favored stu
dent, rather than administrative, en
forcement of the Code. Thirty-six

used both by Men's and Women's

further action to settle the conflict
which arose last quarter over the
advisability of maintaining the
Honor Code at Stanford.

ford student body yesterday polled
ballots in The Daily's Honor Code
straw vote, indicating by strong
margins renewed support of the ex
isting Code's fundamental policies.
Tlie vote, which was regarded as
a cross section of opinion on the
topic, had reached a total of 447
when the ballot box in the Union
Cellar was closed at 5 o'clock.
Students expressed their prefer
ences by answering seven direct
questions on the Honor Code which
were printed in yesterday's Daily.
Landslide for Continuing
In reply to the query, "Do you
favor continuation of the Honor
Code at Stanford?" 409 voted in the
affirmative, against 29 in the nega
tive. Sponsors of the poll last night
interpreted this tabulation as a defi
nite trend toward solution of the
Code controversy.
Balloting on other questions re
vealed by a 336 to 84 majority that
the voters would not report viola
tions of the Honor System, but that
they would aid, if possible, observ
ance of the Code. Results of the
latter point gave an affirmative mar
gin of 197 votes.
Pledge Not Superfluous
The question "Do you think the
Honor Code is working effectively?"
brought a 295 to 140 favorable re
ply, and to "Do you consider the
signing of the pledge superfluous?"
148 votes yes, and 293 no.
A 347 to 75 majority favored stu
dent, rather than administrative, en
forcement of the Code. Thirty-six
voted to install the proctor system
in preference to the Honor Code.
Councils To Use Poll
Results of The Daily's poll will be
used both by Men's and Women's
Councils and by Ex Committee in
further action to settle the conflict
which arose last quarter over the
advisability of maintaining the
Honor Code at Stanford.

An all-University panel, in which
students and faculty members will
have an opportunity to match opin
ions point for point, is scheduled for
next week. The definite date will
be announced Monday.
