# Indians Face Favored O.C. Runners Here
## Eastman, Bright, Marty With Strong Club Team Meet Cards Tomorrow 
### Phil Klauber 
It's the business men against the
| students tomorrow afternoon when
! Charley Hunter brings his favored
Olympic Club track team down to
tangle with Dink Templeton's Stan
ford varsity on Angell Field at 2:15
| o'clock.
All kinds of record book men and
i other high shots, led by Ben East
man, Walter Marty, Slinger Dunn,
Norm Bright, and Johnny Mottram
have come into the Winged O fold
I this Olympic year and present a
practically unbeatable array, but the
J Templeton - Ellington men, with a
good week's practice and several
out -of - town appearances behind
them, can easily keep the affair from
being one-sided.
Injuries Heavy
Injuries have already hit the Car
j diual squad. Humbert Smith, high
â–  jumper, Wally Hardin, javelin, and
J Tiger Alexander, distance man, will
I not appear due to a sore foot,
j wrenched back, and spiked toe, re
spectively. None of these injuries,
, however, except possibly Hardin's,
j will be significant next week. Chuck
j Voigt's broad jump and sprint de-
I but may be hampered by a weak
I ankle.
The club too is having difficulties,
in that Norm Bright, ace distance
man, may have to confine himself to
only a two-mile victory, due to a
bad cold early in the week. The mile
will stiil be the race of the day, how
j ever, as Chuck Nimrno and Elroy
; Robinson will not be picking pop
i pies.
Close 140 Predicted
Weiershauser and Cranston of
i Stanford will help Wisler and A1
! Blackman of the club to put on a
I close quarter-mile show, and Truck
| Dellinger will be there starting the
! long road back, after months on the
I sidelines.

i All hands present will watch with
interest the work of world record
men Eastman, Marty, and Dunn,
championship men Bright, Klopstock,
Clark, Robinson, and Mottram, and
sprinter Ray Dean, who has been
going at such a clip this year that
he is now touted to do both this and
that.
Wind is going to hurt the times in
the short races, but the rest of the
plant is in fine shape. The 3000-seat
grandstand is finished and ready for
the show.
