# Modern Dancer Pleases Farm
## Costumes Are Large Part Of Effective Program 
### Barbara Sweet 
Despite gloomy predictions, Mar
tha Graham, modern dancer, man
aged to draw a good-sized Stanford
audience to the drafty Assembly
Hall last night and excite both its
wonder and admiration.
Essentially contemporary in feel
ing, Miss Graham's dancing can be
understood only in terms of motion.
As she insists, there is no literary
meaning behind her dances, only an
effort to convey a mood or impres
sion through movement. Her skillful
technique and vivid imagination
make this easy, and the audience
had no difficulty in grasping her
intended meaning.
An integral part of her art arc the
fantastic costumes which she de
signs herself. In "Lamentation," in
which she so effectively expressed
tragic grief, Miss Graham appeared
swathed in yards and yards of blue
gray cloth. In "Satyric Festival
Song" she impishly poked fun at
herself in a long, tight dress of
convict-stripe design.
Miss Graham's program was var
ied. In two of her numbers, "Fron
tier" and the Puritanical "Act of
Piety," were expressive.
