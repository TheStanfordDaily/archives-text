# Gray Matter

### Grey Creveling 
I!!TLEK IS LIKE a man who
comes along and pats you on the
back when you are feeling low.
You have been beaten and hog-tied
by your enemies, and as you begin
to stretch and twist with the strength
that has been slowly coming back
to you, a friend comes along and
tries to untie the cords that bind
you.
He says, "Stand up and lift your
head high. Your enemies defeated
you but they have no right to tie
you down and forever prevent youi
recovery. You must get up. Be a
man. Stand up straight and look the
world in the eye."
THIS FKIEND encourages you to
be your old self and you feel your
pride returning. He holds oft" your
• -names who try to keep you tied
down. He even defies your enemies
ind you are proud to have him en
•ourage you and stick up for you.
Finally, when you stand com
i)!.>tely erect, still a little weak, but
tretched to your full height, your
most bitter enemy wants to sail right
i lto you again or else make you lie
down and be relied before you have
chance to completely recover,
ou have no ideas of starting an
i her fight. Your actions would not
alarming to the enemies if they
I. new you were merely trying to
•gain strength to live peacefully
w ithin yourself.
ONE OF TIIE MEN who pitched
i on your enemy's side during the
i; I fight is, for some unknown rea
; n, tolerant and friendly toward
u. He has given up the old
. udges and now is wiliing to help
a a friend. He is a friend on the
< • tside, a friend in the enemy camp
who is doing his best to prevent
ur real enemy from attacking you
. ain.
jfour Good Samaritan, your sec
> ■; d, Hitler, stands firm in fighting
1 • your rights. You see a new life
:.c! a new hope.
H ST WHAT IS HITLER pro
l -ing in order to give Germany
uality in the neighborhood of
n: tions?
Ie wants the right for Germany to
i; »ve troops to any spot it desires to
-upy within its borders. It breaks
:i treaty. "So what?" asks Hitler.
veryone has taken his turn at
. aty-breaking. Why not Ger
v. tny?"
EQUALITY! EQUALITY! Every
ijor power's right has been de
i d Germany — today a major
wer if thert ever was one.
Vow comes Hitler demanding that
< Uriliiy and seemingly well on the
iy toward getting it. A new Lo

carno Pact will be formed, and if
Hitler has anything to say about it, '
the new arrangement will provide '
for equality, non-aggression agree- I
ments, etc.
THE OLD LOCARNO Pact is 1
gone. It has been outdated. Treaties j
must change as well as laws and
social theories. We repealed the 18th ,
amendment. Russia has been social- j
istic for quite some time now. Spain J
is as red as it can be. Japan moves i
across China. Change is inevitable. |
The repudiated Locarno was not a |
failure, just outgrown.
