I I have discovered a gentleman.
! At the end of last quarter I in
| vested in a black leather notebook,
| which became the apple of my eye
I and the pride and joy of my ex-
I istence. Last evening it was repos
! ing on my desk in Enema, full of
I indices, blank paper, and a History
jof Western Civilization syllabus. I
j went out. When 1 returned, the light
| of my life had gone out. In a neat
I pile on my desk were the indices,
j the blank paper, and the History of
! Western Civilization syllabus.
The gentleman was a gentleman,
j He realized that indices, blank pa
| per, and a History of Western Civ
; ilization syllabus are indispensable
: adjuncts to a successful college ca
reer. I was overwhelmed by his

consideration.
