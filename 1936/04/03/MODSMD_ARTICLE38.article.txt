### Women's Editor 
By the latest count, the women
registered in the university number
1020. Unfortunately this balls up the
significance of our page's title, "In
View of the Eleven Hundred." To
lie perfectly accurate, our flag,
should be changed to read "In View
of the One Thousand and Twenty."
This can't be done, type and space
being what they are, without en
croaching on the next page, the
sport sheet. So our original title
will have to stand, with the hope
that in the next few days 80 more
women will come "Back to the
Farm."
All 1020 of us owe our support to
Lagunita next Sunday in their plan
to bring all campus women together
at an open house. Since the Con
ference Party last fall, this has been
the only attempt of such a nature.
Lagunita Court has gone to a lot of
trouble to put the tea over in a big
way. It ought to be fun.

Since the university can't see its
way clear to granting women spon
sors exemption from paying board
and room, the least it should do is
to assure those women rooms in the
living groups of their choice for
spring quarter.
When a woman becomes a sponsor
or an administrator, she very nat
urally makes a number of sacri
fices. She gives up living with her
circle of friends for two quarters.
She is assigned one of the least at
tractive rooms in Roble, for she must
live as close to the middle of her
corridor as possible. She must give
up a good deal of free time, and be
reconciled to interruptions of her
privacy at any hour of the day or
night.
It would not be necessary for the
university to keep the sponsors'
rooms empty for two quarters.
Rather, the rooms could be reas
signed with the understanding that
in the spring the sponsors would
have first claim upon those particu
lar rooms. When a woman does give
up a room in a living group she likes
in order to serve the university, she
should certainly have the privilege
of returning to that jroup in the
spring.

registered in the university number
1020. Unfortunately this balls up the
significance of our page's title, "In
View of the Eleven Hundred." To
lie perfectly accurate, our flag,
should be changed to read "In View
of the One Thousand and Twenty."
This can't be done, type and space
being what they are, without en
croaching on the next page, the
sport sheet. So our original title
will have to stand, with the hope
that in the next few days 80 more
women will come "Back to the
Farm."
All 1020 of us owe our support to
Lagunita next Sunday in their plan
to bring all campus women together
at an open house. Since the Con
ference Party last fall, this has been
the only attempt of such a nature.
Lagunita Court has gone to a lot of
trouble to put the tea over in a big
way. It ought to be fun.

Since the university can't see its
way clear to granting women spon
sors exemption from paying board
and room, the least it should do is
to assure those women rooms in the
living groups of their choice for
spring quarter.
When a woman becomes a sponsor
or an administrator, she very nat
urally makes a number of sacri
fices. She gives up living with her
circle of friends for two quarters.
She is assigned one of the least at
tractive rooms in Roble, for she must
live as close to the middle of her
corridor as possible. She must give
up a good deal of free time, and be
reconciled to interruptions of her
privacy at any hour of the day or
night.
It would not be necessary for the
university to keep the sponsors'
rooms empty for two quarters.
Rather, the rooms could be reas
signed with the understanding that
in the spring the sponsors would
have first claim upon those particu
lar rooms. When a woman does give
up a room in a living group she likes
in order to serve the university, she
should certainly have the privilege
of returning to that jroup in the
spring.
