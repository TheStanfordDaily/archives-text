## 
### Margaret Loud 
No, the Sigma Chis aren't inten
tionally turning their house into a i
barn, or their lawn into a barnyard, j
All those piles and bales and stacks
of hay (one hundred fifty of them) !
you see scattered around the Sig '
Chi domicile in your morning stroll j
down the Row are merely tempo
rary. They're part of the decora
tions for the fraternity's annual Wild !
West Dance, to be given in the
house tonight.
To carry out the theme, the walls
of the house are being decorated j
with flashy murals of cowboys, j
painted ladies, stampeding horses— i
all the people and paraphernalia of
the old West. Besides, all couples
must come in appropriate Wild
West costume.
An old-fashioned hay wagon is
being sent around to the houses and
women's dorms to pick up the Sigma
Chi s gal friends. Another feature
of the evening will be the bar (with
bartender) serving — cider and I

I
doughnuts. Carvel Craig's orchestra I
will play.
With less than a week of the
quarter gone, however, spring social
events are not yet in full swing. 1
Other than the elaborate Sigma Chi I
affair, the only dance scheduled for j
the week-end is a radio dance given |
by the Union Club in the Women's
Clubhouse Saturday night.
