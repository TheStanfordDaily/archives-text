## WHEN IT'S SPRING COEDS TURN TO BASKETBALL 
### 
Now that the basketball has been
put back into the closet for another
year, the Farm coeds, like their
brothers, have turned to baseball.
Already they can be seen scamper
ing around the baseball field, snag
ging grounders and batting flies in
practice for their coming games.
Baseball, the main team sport this
quarter, is coached by Grace King,
who has charge of all four class
teams. The student head of baseball
is Ruth Schmidt, the mainstay of the
senior pitching stafT. It was her fast
ball last year that won every game
for the seniors and enabled them to
win the championship, and if she is
in as good form this season there is
no reason why they shouldn't re
peat.
