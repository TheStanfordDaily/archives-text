# SOPHS AGAIN HOOP CHAMPS; ALL-STARS NAMED
## 
### 
Just a final word about the bas
ketball season. The sophs remained

undefeated throughout the season
and retained the championship. The
all-star team, chosen by coaches, '
managers and captains, would be a |
formidable opponent for any worn- i
en's team. The forwards are Dottie j
Burgers (sen.), Caryll Mudd (jun.), j
and Marie Farmer (soph.); and the
guards, Doris Burke (sen.), Phyllis
Boothe (jun.), and Sally Harwood
(soph.). Ruth Schmidt (sen.), Bar
bara Murphy (soph.), Helen Watters 1
(sen.), Kay Moran (jun.), Kay Ken
nedy (soph.), and Martha Jane
Knecht (frosh) were named as sub- j
stitutes. â€”Jane Heenan
