## BRIGHT DIDDLES; ANOTHER GNASH FOR HUNTER 
### 
Norm Bright—Olympics 5000 me
ters contender, schoolmaster, and
chronic late arrival at track meets.
Ihe first two designations are a
matter of everyday concern, but the
third is not so well known. Bright,
nevertheless, has a singularly
consistent habit of showing up late
for races and holding up track pro
ceedings.
Such action has taken place three
separate and distinct times within
the last six months.
The most well-known was the
occasion of the second S.F. Indoor
meet, whin Bright was supposed to
meet Glenn Cunningham and Joe
McCluskey in the Call-Bulletin
mile.
Now Norm did not want to run
the mile against Cunningham and
McCluskey. He wanted to run the
two-mile—Heaven knows why any
one should want to but the fact re
mains that he took no joy of op
posing Cunningham in that mile.
So when the time for the featured
and muchly ballyhooed mile ar
rived Brightie was nowhere to be
found. Charley Hunter, the smiling
but nervous meet proprietor, im
mediately instigated a posse to rout
out the missing miler.
He was found, 15 minutes later, in
the men's lounge. He was very
mad when they dragged him out
and set him off against Cunning
ham. The result, as everyone
knows, made Norm smile, for it was
a victory in the astonishing indoor
time of 4.1(3.
Then there was Blight's first tardy
appearance. It was last November,
at the Cal-Card cross country meet,
held on the local golf course.
All of the Cal and Stanford un
derwear athletes were on their
marks, champing at the bit, on the
first hole waiting for the gun to set
them off on the grueling five-mile
grind.
Then all of a sudden the as

semblage heard a high, tremulous
cry from over in the adjacent cow
paddock. "Hey, hold that gun a
minnit," was the appealing plea, and
it did not take long before every
one knew it was Bright.
He came tearing along through
the pasture, hopped over a fence',
under a couple of trees, and begged
for a moment to change his clothes.
For he was fully clothed, carrying
his running next-to-nothings »in a
bundle under his arm.
And while all of the gathered
runners, coaches, and spectators
turned and looked away, Bright
stripped his street wear, behind a
kindly protecting tree trunk, slip
ped on the shorts and lined up with
the rest of the pack ready for the
word "go."
After all of this trial, incidentally,
Bright was only running "for the
workout," because his eligible col
lege days were over.
