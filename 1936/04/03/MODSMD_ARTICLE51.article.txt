# AND LASTLY, AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
And now lastly in the annals of
the Bright tardiness is the yet un
told tale of last Saturday, at the
Olympic Club-Bear meet.
The Bellingham (Wash.) bricktop
was one of the featured attractions
at this meet, too. He was to run the
mile with Elroy Robinson and Bob
Heavey.
But came 2 o'clock, the time when
all Berkeley meets begin on the dot
with the mile, and no Bright was in
appearance.
To make this tale a short, stubby
one, the missing Bright mystery
was solved when a wandering soph
omore manager heard some fright
ful hangings on a dressing room
door, found it was Norm locked in.
The door was opened and he was
let out, a mere 10 minutes late.
There is a rumor, unconfirmed,
that B.A.C. officials are assembling a
picked bodyguard to escort the fu
ture Olympics star out to the track
Saturday so that the patrons will
not be kept on the edges of their
seats waiting for a half-hour while
Bright is taking a dip in the En
cina pools, or some other distract
ing diversion.
S LINGER DUNN'S back, re
turned from Honolulu one week ago.
He looks to be in fine shape, says he
lost considerable avoirdupois over
there working out fairly regularly,
but gained a little of it back on the
Frisco-bound Matson packet.
