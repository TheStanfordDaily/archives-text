### Hunter Hendee 
A double-barreled team comprised
of Fulierton Junior College and High
School swimmers, the United States'
second best high school team of 1935,

gle at 4 o'clock wilh the greatest
freshman team in Stanford history.
Fulierton boasts four all-Amcrican
swimmers: Sellers, second best high
school 50-yard man last year; Whita
ker, sprint ace in the 100; Summers
in the 220; and Chapman, number
two among American junior divers.
Stanford youngsters are led by a
Junior National champion, Captain
Winfield Needham, who will swim

American breast stroke swimmer,
holder of two world's sprint records,
and Roy Winkelman, all-American
junior diver number three, complete
the Indians' list of big names.
But according to Nort Thornton,
coach, it won't be any of those three
that will decide whether the fresh
men win over the southerners. One
Spence Moehler juggles the fate of
the team when he swims against
Whitaker in the 50 and 100.
Towne swims his favorite distance,
100 yards, against breast* stroke
sprinter Sellers—in what promises to
be a real race all the way. Winkel
