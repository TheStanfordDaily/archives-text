# Wolter's Nine Meets U.S.C. Here Tomorrow
## After Revenge for Two Losses to Troy in Los Angeles on Spring Tour 
### 
Varsity baseballers will attempt to
gain revenge for two shutouts hand
ed them on their Southern California
tour when they meet the U.S.C.
Trojans on the Sunken Diamond
tomorrow afternoon. The game is
scheduled to start at 3:15 o'clock to
allow fans to see the track meet.

In their two meetings last week on
*he S.C. diamond, Trojan pitchers
joth times succeeded in whitewash
ing the Cards, winning 4-0 and 10-0.
Card hitting seems to be in a slump
at present as they have collected
only 3 runs in the last 4 games.
Ray Weiershauser, with a full
week of rest under his belt, will
.start on the mound for the Indians
with Glenn Hamilton and Fred
Furman in reserve. The infield, with
Darrel Holman at first, Frank Tre
maine at second, George Farrel at
short, and Bill Newsom at third, will
remain intact, but Wolter is con
sidering some changes in the out
field spots, with Tom Killefer or
Bob Matthews liable to replace Ed
Clark or Bones or Glenn Hamilton.
Leo Heagerty, who led the Card
hitting attack against St. Mary's
Wednesday, will again start behind
the bat.
