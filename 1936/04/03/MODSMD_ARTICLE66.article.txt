# Bear Netmen Take Cards, 6-3
## Law, Dey, Seward Lose Top Singles Matches 
### 
University of California net squad
defeated Coach Sherman Lockwood's
Stanford varsity 6-3 on the Berkeley
courts yesterday, and thereby nosed
the Indians out of second place in
league standings.
California showed unforeseen
strength in the top singles and
doubles matches, Johnny Law, Ben
Dey, and Bill Seward all losing to
Bennet, Newton, and Tanaka of the
Bears, after having played much bet
ter tennis against U.S.C. last week.
In case the lads were off form, they
will be able to make it up when the
two teams clash again at Stanford
April 25.
