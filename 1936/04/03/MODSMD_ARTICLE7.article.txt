# Bruno Unafraid To Die Tonight
## Grand Jury Investigates Wendel, Spitz Cases 
### 
TRENTON, N.J., April 2 (A 3 ). â€”
Bruno Richard Hauptmann had but
one more day to live under the ten
tative ruling of Keeper Mark O.
Kimberling of the New Jersey State
Prison at Trenton, that he be put to
death at 8 p.m. Friday.
The Mercer County grand jury
sought to compare the handwriting
of the Lindbergh ransom notes with
that of Paul H. Wendel to help de
termine if his "confession" of the
celebrated kidnap-murder was true
or false.
New York authorities searched
Brooklyn to learn whether Wendel
had been abducted there and mis
treated to force his "confession."
High state officials said the arrest
of one of Wendel's abductors was
expected shortly.
Stephen Spitz, Chicago former
convict, was reported planning to
come East with a story that he
bought "hot' Lindbergh money from
a New Jersey gang.
Mrs. Hauptmann was to pay her
third "last visit" to her doomed
husband.
Hauptmann himself, least inform
ed of anyone concerning the devel
opments whirling about him, was
unchanged. He has wept some un
der the strain of the last few days,
and his face shows his mental suf
fering.
His story of innocence, however,
remains unaltered in any detail; and
he has said in a letter to the gov
ernor that he is not afraid to die.
