## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Results of Daily's Poll Not Startling; But Several Features Highly Significant 
### 
Four hundred nine Stanford students yes
terday east ballots favoring continuation ol'
the Farm's Honor (-ode; only 29, probably in
cluding the usual number of wise-crackers,
voted against the system.
To say the least, this overwhelming elec
toral support of the ('.ode was in no way sur
prising. The only unusual factor in the regis
tered 409-29 vote was that so few wise-craek
ers cast ballots.
So the 499-29 support of the Honor ('.ode,
when viewed as a cross-section ratio,of the
whole student body was the natural, inevi
table, and expected reaction, slightly reassur
ing, bill by no means the poll's most significant
revelation.
In fact, the only columns of tabulated lig
ures whose ratio was at all unexpected were
the answers to Questions ,'l and 4, in which
the 417 voting members of the local electorate
admitted, 330-S4, tlnd they would not report
a student who they were convinced had vio
lated the Honor ('.ode, but claimed, 297-109,
that they would take steps (such as warning
the person) to aid observance of the Code.
This feature, when properly weighed in stu
dent council session, may lead to a change in
means of enforcement. The feeling had been
that Ibis "hesitance to tattle" was existent,
though in a lesser degree which might prove
to be the ease if the entire campus were con
tacted.
All in all, however, the most significant re
actions to the poll were nearly 209 comments

scrawled on the ballots, several of which are
published in another column of Tin: Daii.y.
Through its Vox Campi medium, Tin; Daily
welcomes further criticisms of details of the
Code's effectiveness and enforcement.
As suggested in several of the comments—
such as "The ('.ode is 0.K., but the Irosh
should get the old training given in the past,"
and "Tighten up; new students, Irosh, and
transfers, are the worst offenders"—there is
a justified feeling that Honor Code education
of "young Stanford" could be stepped up.
This has already been set as one of the
Councils' main aims; they hope to co-operate
with sponsors in Kncina and Koble, and will
endeavor to instill the spirit of the "Funda
mental Standard" into freshmen by means of
a well-organized campaign early next fall.
This year's Men's and Women's Councils
are to be congratulated for viewing the Honor
Code as a Stanford tradition, instead of as
merely a statute book with themselves as
prosecuting attorney, judge, and defense coun
sel rolled into one. The Councils have taken
an objective interest in the Code as a workable
student institution; consequently, they co
operated in making the poll a serious rellec
tion of campus opinion and comment.
The Councils and Daily join in welcoming
further suggestion, whose incorporation into
the Code might help to insure the perpetua
tion of Honor Code as an effective living Stan
ford tradition.

All in all, however, the most significant re
actions to the poll were nearly 209 comments

scrawled on the ballots, several of which are
published in another column of Tin: Daii.y.

As suggested in several of the comments—
such as "The ('.ode is 0.K., but the Irosh
should get the old training given in the past,"
and "Tighten up; new students, Irosh, and
transfers, are the worst offenders"—there is
a justified feeling that Honor Code education
of "young Stanford" could be stepped up.
This has already been set as one of the
Councils' main aims; they hope to co-operate
with sponsors in Kncina and Koble, and will
endeavor to instill the spirit of the "Funda
mental Standard" into freshmen by means of
a well-organized campaign early next fall.
This year's Men's and Women's Councils
are to be congratulated for viewing the Honor
Code as a Stanford tradition, instead of as
merely a statute book with themselves as
prosecuting attorney, judge, and defense coun
sel rolled into one. The Councils have taken
an objective interest in the Code as a workable
student institution; consequently, they co
operated in making the poll a serious rellec
tion of campus opinion and comment.
The Councils and Daily join in welcoming
further suggestion, whose incorporation into
the Code might help to insure the perpetua
tion of Honor Code as an effective living Stan
ford tradition.
Four hundred nine Stanford students yes
terday east ballots favoring continuation ol'
the Farm's Honor (-ode; only 29, probably in
cluding the usual number of wise-crackers,
voted against the system.
To say the least, this overwhelming elec
toral support of the ('.ode was in no way sur
prising. The only unusual factor in the regis
tered 409-29 vote was that so few wise-craek
ers cast ballots.
So the 499-29 support of the Honor ('.ode,
when viewed as a cross-section ratio,of the
whole student body was the natural, inevi
table, and expected reaction, slightly reassur
ing, bill by no means the poll's most significant
revelation.
In fact, the only columns of tabulated lig
ures whose ratio was at all unexpected were
the answers to Questions ,'l and 4, in which
the 417 voting members of the local electorate
admitted, 330-S4, tlnd they would not report
a student who they were convinced had vio
lated the Honor ('.ode, but claimed, 297-109,
that they would take steps (such as warning
the person) to aid observance of the Code.
This feature, when properly weighed in stu
dent council session, may lead to a change in
means of enforcement. The feeling had been
that Ibis "hesitance to tattle" was existent,
though in a lesser degree which might prove
to be the ease if the entire campus were con
tacted.
