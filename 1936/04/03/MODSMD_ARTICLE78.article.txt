# Back to the Farm For The Big Spring Season
## 
### 
What do Stanford students do on week
ends?
Do they work their way through college?
Do they study in the library? Do they catch
up on sleep? Do they read philosophy? Do
they work out their conceptions of life, heauty,
ethics, culture? Wel-I-I-I-I, not exactly.
The only reliable information that can be
gleaned from a survey of abandoned living
quarters, library, and Quad is that the stu
dents certainly do not stay on the Farm.
Sometime between Friday dawn and the
sunset, there comes a sudden pause in the
day's occupation, the Farm population sud
denly rushes to cars and departs for various
urban areas.
While campus halls of learning stand empty
and dark, San Francisco halls stand choekfull,
cars line the Sandhill road, realtors in Carmel
up their rates.
Everywhere there is a great tendency of
people to crowd together in stull'y places,
while Farm lands take a two-day drop to the
subinarginal.
History says the week-end migration dales
back a number of years to the adjunct of the
horseless carriage.
But history and common sense show that
il is more justified in the drizzly winter sea
son, and even alter the autumn football game,
than dining the Farm's Big Spring Social
Season with its proms and dances, heavenly
nights on and near Lagunita, house and club
form a Is, Irack-lennis-baseball-golf-swiinming
sports parade of a Saturday, class and organi
zation social activities.
Back to the Farm until after Commence
ment.
