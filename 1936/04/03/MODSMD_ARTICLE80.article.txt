"Will you promise, in the event of your reinstate
ment, to present news without color or bias?"
"Certainly," replied Harrison.
With this simple interchange of words between the
U.C.L.A. student executive council and Gilbert Har
rison, editor of the Daily Bruin, the furor raised in
midweek by the attempted ouster was quieted.
This diplomatic answer satisfied the politicians who
had claimed that the Daily Bruin editor had used his
news columns unfairly and presented news stories in
a manner which tended to further his editorial aims.
The answer also satisfied Harrison because, while
on the surface it smoothed all the trouble, it actually
was not the answer the executive council had expected.
Harrison always has, to the best of his ability, given
the U.C.L.A. readers an unbiased news presentation
and his promise to do so was no concession to the
wishes of the council but rather a declaration that
he would continue to run his paper as best he could,
just as he has since taking office in September,
The insistence of the executive council for "uncol

ored" news is laughable when one reads the issue over
which that board had partial control, through its tri
umvirate of censors. In it appeared one of the most
highly colored stories possible when the report of the
council meeting, as written under the direction of the
censors, featured the dismissal from the campus of Ifi
organizations and listed several other actions before
it finally reached, in the next to the last paragraph, the
news that the editor had been ousted.
With such an example of obviously poor interpreta
tion of relative news values in a story written under
its direct supervision, how can the council set itself
up as a judge of whether or not Harrison, a trained
journalist, is coloring news?
