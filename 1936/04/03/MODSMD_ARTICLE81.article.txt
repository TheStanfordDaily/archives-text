This was clean speech week at the fire house, well,
for a while, anyway. The boys had a moral house
cleaning. It seems that Mrs. Roth from her judge's
stand across the street had called up and told the fire
house laddies that they were noisier than the Phi
Delts. So they determined that anyone indulging in
profanity or made any cross-references to anything of
a low nature, was reprimanded by being made to
stand with his head bound until released by common
consent of the fire laddies. But Chief Dugan com
pletely wrecked the morale. When the chief was repri
manded for offending the delikate sense of the Legion
of Dcency he said: "'i'JQKGVBG&XZi', you're getting
to be a bunch of !Â£*%?:s& around here." The boys
all got up and bowed their heads.
The guides who meet the lowa Dust as they blow
in to the Memorial Court on their way to God's House
of Faith and Hoover's Home of San Juan Hill, live a
colorful existence among their mosaics, their flowers,
their books, the natural wonders of the Memorial
Church, and their archeological and historical relics
excavated from the seventh sack (gunny) of the Book
store.
One bewhiskered old codger some time ago stalked
up to the guide, poked his chin out at him, and asked if
the guide remembered him. "I was here a few years
ago," he said.
Tlie guide rather condescendingly replied that he
couldn't remember, "We meet so many people, you
know."
"Yes," said the codges, "I suppose you do."
So the guide took him through the religion mill,
explaining how the gold bricks had been brought over
piece by piece from Italy, and how the gold leaf was
turned over every year by conscientious students, and
how, if you stand right here you can see Adam wink
ing at Eve.
The stranger took it all in passively, and then he
finally wandered off.
The codger was George Bernard Shaw (remem
ber?).
A legal mind is a fine thing. A legal mind can make
distinctions. Given facts on one side of a question, and
then given the facts on the other side, the legal mind
can then look in a big book with a lot of numbers and
footnotes, and decide that neither is light. This is
progress.
It seems that down at the Law School, there is a
legal mind who has transferred from U.S.F. Now
U.S.F. Law School is not looked upon with such favor
at the local bar. And the legal mind is not given
credit for a certain Property Rights course he took at
U.S.F. because the school is not considered an ac
credited one. However, the legal mind finds now that
he can't take the Property Rights course here at
Stanford because he's already taken it at U.S.F. This
is progress.
