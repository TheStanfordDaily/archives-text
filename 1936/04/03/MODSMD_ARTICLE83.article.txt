## "THEY CAN'T BURN BRUNO" 
### 
j Today Bruno is chief fakir iji (he ]
world's circus. He walks the slack '
j wire of the law while above him j
j hangs a Damoclean sword appar- j
; ently suspended by the classic
i thread, but actually held by a strong j

i cable called poli
: tics.
Governor Har
old Hoffman has
patents on the il- l
lusion. Not long 1
ago he was good
i senatorial timber,
but today the
i wood seems only
; in his head. Byl
| attempt ing to I
! make sure it was*
I Bruno who bash-

i ed in Charles
1 Lindbergh Jr.'s skull, he has shored .
j up the vengeance of New Jersey's !
| German electorate, and put himself
I under the capable hoof of the Amer- j
ican elephant, who never, never j
forgets.
Solon Hoffman is obviously play
' ing politics, a tune that never sounds
I well on the public piano. He wants !
| to save Hauptmann not because he j
j is too doubtful of his guilt, but be- {
! cause he lias no doubt that Bruno i
I while alive is a ticket to the gov- |
' errorship, and when dead, is just !
! dead. 1

! Although the governor hasn't said !
i so, it seems to us that the Bronx
' carpenter who made the gold clause
I famous couldn't be legally convicted '■
or executed on the Lindbergh mur- I
; der charge.
! If the law of the land still puts
j the burden of proof on the prose
j cution, Bruno was convicted of |
i nothing more than complicity in the
! kidnapping. The money in the ga- J

rage, the telephone number in the
closet, the ladder—all are proof;
beyond reasonable doubt of par
ticipation, but no proof at all that
it was Hauptmann who climbed the
ladder, took the Lindbergh baby
from his bed, and either dropped
him or killed him.
It's a strange commentary on jur
ies and American justice that the
"reasonable doubt" clause, which !
should save anyone who doesn't of- j
ficially confess, is smashed to drift
wood by the twin breakers of cir- |
cumstantial evidence and wild emo- I
tionalism.

It was an easy step for Trenton's '
12 tried and true citizens to ration
alize from the probability of guilt as [
charged to guilt itself. And it was
not only easy, but mandatory that j
New Jersey satisfy the nation by I
charging Bruno with an unprovable '
crime. From the first "everybody j
rise," it was dead cinch that the j
prosecution couldn't legally convict, I
but that they'd get a conviction.
Bruno didn't confess; no one saw
him take the baby, much less kill
it; no one could forge a single un
breakable link in the chain, yet
Bruno is almost certain to be strap
ped to his throne as king of Ameri
ca's criminals.
For his pari in the crime, it seems
perfectly right that he should die. j
New Jersey's death-house, Bruno
But if and when the lights do dim in
will pay-off not because he was
guilty on written law, but on un
written law—that legislation which
sweeps aside such technicial piddles
as charges and the pertinency of evi- -
dence thereto, and which works in
fallibly when girls are attacked or
babies killed.
