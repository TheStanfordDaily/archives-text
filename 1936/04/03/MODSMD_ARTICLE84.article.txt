# "Shark Island" Tells Story Of Martyr Doctor
## 
### 
Had John Wilkes Booth been i
more of an athlete and less of a cur, j
i "The Prisoner of Shark Island," now
at the Fox Stanford, would never
! have been filmed. For after he shot j
Abraham Lincoln, he leapt to the j
Ford Theater stage and broke his
| leg.
The innocent country doctor who ■
some hours later set the assassin's
leg was Samuel A. Mudd, sympa- j
j thctically played by Warner Baxter. I
; It is the tale of this unfortunate j
doctor, victim of a ruthless court
martial, that director John Ford,
! Academy Award winner, spins into j
an intense, vivid photoplay.
Quite as good, in its way, as the .
Mudd story, is "Snowed Under." |
i Maybe Warner Bros, just pulled the !
: wool over my critical eye, but after j
the weighty and depressing Shark
Island this gay little bit of cinema
insignificance seemed all right,
j The story's not much. An ir- j
responsible playwright (George
Brent) tries to find quiet in his
! snow-bound country house. But
soon the place is swarming with
sweetheart Patricia Ellis, ex-wives ;
Genevieve Tobin and Glenda Far
rel,l and Sheriff Frank McHugh.
But the cracks arc good. Silly, :
but good. Tobin's cute, Farrell's |
j seedy, and Ellis is—well, you know J
what Patricia Ellis is. "Snowed
Under," unlike the run of second
features, is spontaneous good fun. I
