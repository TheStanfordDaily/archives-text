# IT'S YOUR CODE, STUDENTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford is an idealistic institu
tion, refreshing in her democracy
and encouraging in her optimism.
As befalls any dynamic society, she
is unsettled at times. At present
one of her best, and basic, props is
buckling—her Honor Code.
According to the cynical "Skeptic,"
the Code "is a Godsend to those
who violate it"; but this need not be
so for it is also a Godsend to those
who observe it.
Let us consider the part the fac
ulty must play in its effective func
tioning. Students have pointed out
that there is much greater incen
tive to cheat on an ex in which the
course grade depends almost if not
entirely on the final or, almost as
bad, on a midquarter and a final.
Each professor can alleviate the
strain of finals (and the Honor
Code) by going to the trouble of
making up a few more tests during
the quarter and putting less weight
on the value of the finals.
What can students do to help mat
ters? They must realize that it is
their system and each has responsi
bility in its effectiveness. If 1 were
to ask you if you would report a
violation to our Code many of you
would say "No." You think you
would be brotherly, broadminded,
magnanimous. But you wouldn't;
you'd be a weakling and a coward.
Anyone can shut his eyes to that
which he wishes to ignore, but. it
takes a real man to keep them open,
stand up on his hind legs and do
something about it.
Students, do you have the in
testinal fortitude to fight for your
integrity?
As a newcomer faculty member,

I look upon the Honor Code as one
of (he finer things of Stanford's; I
am proud of its presence and sensi- I
tive to its injury. Few if any con- I
scientious persons would care to
abolish it —but better that than to let
it linger on a feeble invalid.
Suggestion No. I—Faculty: don't
grade only on a final, or a final and
a midterm.
Suggestion No. 2—Students: if
you haven't got what it takes to turn
the culprits in, tell someone who
has. At any rate, somehow, help
defend this fine heritage of yours.

tive to its injury. Few if any con- I
scientious persons would care to
abolish it —but better that than to let
it linger on a feeble invalid.
Suggestion No. I—Faculty: don't
grade only on a final, or a final and
a midterm.
Suggestion No. 2—Students: if
you haven't got what it takes to turn
the culprits in, tell someone who
has. At any rate, somehow, help
defend this fine heritage of yours.

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford is an idealistic institu
tion, refreshing in her democracy
and encouraging in her optimism.
As befalls any dynamic society, she
is unsettled at times. At present
one of her best, and basic, props is
buckling—her Honor Code.
According to the cynical "Skeptic,"
the Code "is a Godsend to those
who violate it"; but this need not be
so for it is also a Godsend to those
who observe it.
Let us consider the part the fac
ulty must play in its effective func
tioning. Students have pointed out
that there is much greater incen
tive to cheat on an ex in which the
course grade depends almost if not
entirely on the final or, almost as
bad, on a midquarter and a final.
Each professor can alleviate the
strain of finals (and the Honor
Code) by going to the trouble of
making up a few more tests during
the quarter and putting less weight
on the value of the finals.
What can students do to help mat
ters? They must realize that it is
their system and each has responsi
bility in its effectiveness. If 1 were
to ask you if you would report a
violation to our Code many of you
would say "No." You think you
would be brotherly, broadminded,
magnanimous. But you wouldn't;
you'd be a weakling and a coward.
Anyone can shut his eyes to that
which he wishes to ignore, but. it
takes a real man to keep them open,
stand up on his hind legs and do
something about it.
Students, do you have the in
testinal fortitude to fight for your
integrity?
As a newcomer faculty member,

I look upon the Honor Code as one
of (he finer things of Stanford's; I
am proud of its presence and sensi- I
tive to its injury. Few if any con- I
scientious persons would care to
abolish it —but better that than to let
it linger on a feeble invalid.
