# Inter-House Group Plans Greek Ties
## Special Committee Meets At Council Session; Plan Exchange Dinners 
### 
Extensive plans for interfraternity
exchange dinners and singing con
tests to strengthen friendship ties
along the Row were last night being
formulated by Bob Hoover, Inter
fraternity Council president, and his
special committee for consideration
at their meeting Tuesday night.
The committee will decide be
tween two exchange dinner plans at
that time.
First is the one used at California.
Sophomores there report to upper
classmen each week the houses
where they've had dinners.
Under the second proposal specific
exchange dinners would be arranged
between the houses.
Besides exchange dinners the
committee will consider President
Hoover's pet scheme, interhouse
singing contests. Eastern colleges
are enthusiastic, he says, about the
"fun and fellowship derived from
these group singing contests."
Hoover's special committee —
Louis Bansbach (Sigma Nu), Alex
Bcrger (Delta Chi), and Louis Men
delssohn (S.A.E.) —over the week
end sought campus opinion as to the
best means of promoting interhouse
friendship and will present its find
ings to Hoover Tuesday night.
Plans proposed by the committee
at that time will be presented for
final approval to the Interfraternity
Council next week.
Hoover believes some action must
be taken soon. "Actual social rela
tions between fraternities on the
campus are relatively scarce," he
said. "An increase in interfraternity
functions and activities such as ex
change dinners or- joint dances
would breed more friendly relations
among the houses."
