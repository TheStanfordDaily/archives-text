AFTER NEARLY THREE YEARS' imprisonment David A. Lamson
met his 5-year-old daughter, Allenc, when he was freed from wile
murder charges after two succeeding trials in which juries were
deadlocked. At first little Allelic did not know her father, but
after a few minutes, shouted "Daddy," and Hung her arms around
his neck. (A.P. Photo)
