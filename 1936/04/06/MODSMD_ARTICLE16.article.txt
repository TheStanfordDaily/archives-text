# Lamson Opens House; 'Glad To Be Home'
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
It was Christmas in April over at
the Lamson's Friday.
They were holding open house for
reporters that careened up Creek
Drive as well as for anonymous
well-wishers just wanting to shake
Dave Lamson's hand.
Save for the tracked-up front
walk, there was no evidence inside
or out of Dr. Margaret Lamson's
shingled cottage that they were
doing anything but spending a rainy
afternoon. In the cozy living room
you'd find a handful of close friends
sitting by a hearth which Dave
tended, and a glass of lemonade in
everyone's hand.
Dave, himself, was in his shirt
sleeves, pink-cheeked and full
faced, laughing and talking so per
fectly composed, so ready with the
smart answer and the pleasant
quip, that if you didn't recognize
him you'd figure you were in the
wrong home.
More Nervous Than He
If you accidentally stumbled as
you step down into the room, Dave
would grab you and say "steady
there," and you'd realize that you
were more nervous than he was.
It seemed impossible that seven
hours before, he walked into the
courtroom, where he fought three

times for his life, acLually doubting
he would be freed.
"I thought District Attorney
Thomas would surely go again," he
laughed. "I can't tell you how it
felt when I suddenly realized what
had happened. You might call it in
credulity. One doesn't stop to ana
lyze feelings at a time like that."
Looks, Feels Fine
His voice was perfectly normal,
not so much as an extra line on his
face or a hint of fatigue in his
eyes.
His sister was bustling in the
kitchen, and as she came into the
living room with a box full of fire
wood, Dave took it from her and
set it on the hearth. Everyone was
smiling easily, not with the hyster
ical relief one might expect but in a
kind of silent happiness, of satis
faction in the occurrence of a cer
tainty.
Dave knew no more what he was
going to do in a month than what
he was going to do that ngiht. "I've
grown used to living in the mo
ment," he laughed. "Ive found it
doesn't pay to plan and worry."
Partial to Writing
As for writing, he's still decidedly
partial to it. But despite the fact
that his book, "We Who Are About
to Die," has become a best-seller
on its literary merit, not as a sensa
tionalized confession, Dave can't see
himself as a professional fictioneer.
"I'm just a reporter. My book was
only an account of what happened.
I never have had an ability for
fiction, and I don't intend to try
now. It'll be articles, maybe, and not
about myself or prison life. I've
had my say on that."
Dave smiled and looked around
the room at his sister, at 6-year-old
Allene, his daughter, Miss Hope
McDonald, her nurse, and Mr. Frank
Ellis, a juryman in his second trial
and now one of Dave's personal
friends.
The man who had once held
Dave's life in his own hands was al
most bursting with delight. He,
more than anyone in the room, was
looking at the scene objectively,
watching the principles in a tragedy
playing light comedy again.
Juries Well Divided
"Don't ask me how the jury feels
about Dave," he grinned. "This
last one was too well divided. And
there wasn't a total of 36 of 'em,
either," he said, emphasizing the
point with a wave of his smoking
pipe. "Why, the Supreme Court
said the first 12 weren't jurymen at
all!"
There was laughter at that, but not
the triumphantly bitter kind you
might expect, just a laugh for it's
own sake.
Dave himself has already started
a long rest, physically fit, and with
his three years of hell already far
behind him in feeling, if not in
time.
"I'm going to stay here and take
it easy for a while. As for visiting
Stanford, I haven't thought about it
yet. By the way, how is the old
place—still going strong? Sure, call
me up if you want any more infor
mation. Sorry I can't tell you
more . . ."

wrong home.
More Nervous Than He
If you accidentally stumbled as
you step down into the room, Dave
would grab you and say "steady
there," and you'd realize that you
were more nervous than he was.
It seemed impossible that seven
hours before, he walked into the
courtroom, where he fought three

times for his life, acLually doubting
he would be freed.
"I thought District Attorney
Thomas would surely go again," he
laughed. "I can't tell you how it
felt when I suddenly realized what
had happened. You might call it in
credulity. One doesn't stop to ana
lyze feelings at a time like that."
Looks, Feels Fine
His voice was perfectly normal,
not so much as an extra line on his
face or a hint of fatigue in his
eyes.
His sister was bustling in the
kitchen, and as she came into the
living room with a box full of fire
wood, Dave took it from her and
set it on the hearth. Everyone was
smiling easily, not with the hyster
ical relief one might expect but in a
kind of silent happiness, of satis
faction in the occurrence of a cer
tainty.
Dave knew no more what he was
going to do in a month than what
he was going to do that ngiht. "I've
grown used to living in the mo
ment," he laughed. "Ive found it
doesn't pay to plan and worry."
Partial to Writing
As for writing, he's still decidedly
partial to it. But despite the fact
that his book, "We Who Are About
to Die," has become a best-seller
on its literary merit, not as a sensa
tionalized confession, Dave can't see
himself as a professional fictioneer.
"I'm just a reporter. My book was
only an account of what happened.
I never have had an ability for
fiction, and I don't intend to try
now. It'll be articles, maybe, and not
about myself or prison life. I've
had my say on that."
Dave smiled and looked around
the room at his sister, at 6-year-old
Allene, his daughter, Miss Hope
McDonald, her nurse, and Mr. Frank
Ellis, a juryman in his second trial
and now one of Dave's personal
friends.
The man who had once held
Dave's life in his own hands was al
most bursting with delight. He,
more than anyone in the room, was
looking at the scene objectively,
watching the principles in a tragedy
playing light comedy again.
Juries Well Divided
"Don't ask me how the jury feels
about Dave," he grinned. "This
last one was too well divided. And
there wasn't a total of 36 of 'em,
either," he said, emphasizing the
point with a wave of his smoking
pipe. "Why, the Supreme Court
said the first 12 weren't jurymen at
all!"
There was laughter at that, but not
the triumphantly bitter kind you
might expect, just a laugh for it's
own sake.
Dave himself has already started
a long rest, physically fit, and with
his three years of hell already far
behind him in feeling, if not in
time.
"I'm going to stay here and take
it easy for a while. As for visiting
Stanford, I haven't thought about it
yet. By the way, how is the old
place—still going strong? Sure, call
me up if you want any more infor
mation. Sorry I can't tell you
more . . ."
It was Christmas in April over at
the Lamson's Friday.
They were holding open house for
reporters that careened up Creek
Drive as well as for anonymous
well-wishers just wanting to shake
Dave Lamson's hand.
Save for the tracked-up front
walk, there was no evidence inside
or out of Dr. Margaret Lamson's
shingled cottage that they were
doing anything but spending a rainy
afternoon. In the cozy living room
you'd find a handful of close friends
sitting by a hearth which Dave
tended, and a glass of lemonade in
everyone's hand.
Dave, himself, was in his shirt
sleeves, pink-cheeked and full
faced, laughing and talking so per
fectly composed, so ready with the
smart answer and the pleasant
quip, that if you didn't recognize
him you'd figure you were in the
wrong home.

living room with a box full of fire
wood, Dave took it from her and
set it on the hearth. Everyone was
smiling easily, not with the hyster
ical relief one might expect but in a
kind of silent happiness, of satis
faction in the occurrence of a cer
tainty.
Dave knew no more what he was
going to do in a month than what
he was going to do that ngiht. "I've
grown used to living in the mo
ment," he laughed. "Ive found it
doesn't pay to plan and worry."
Partial to Writing
As for writing, he's still decidedly
partial to it. But despite the fact
that his book, "We Who Are About
to Die," has become a best-seller
on its literary merit, not as a sensa
tionalized confession, Dave can't see
himself as a professional fictioneer.
"I'm just a reporter. My book was
only an account of what happened.
I never have had an ability for
fiction, and I don't intend to try
now. It'll be articles, maybe, and not
about myself or prison life. I've
had my say on that."
Dave smiled and looked around
the room at his sister, at 6-year-old
Allene, his daughter, Miss Hope
McDonald, her nurse, and Mr. Frank
Ellis, a juryman in his second trial
and now one of Dave's personal
friends.
The man who had once held
Dave's life in his own hands was al
most bursting with delight. He,
more than anyone in the room, was
looking at the scene objectively,
watching the principles in a tragedy
playing light comedy again.
Juries Well Divided
"Don't ask me how the jury feels
about Dave," he grinned. "This
last one was too well divided. And
there wasn't a total of 36 of 'em,
either," he said, emphasizing the
point with a wave of his smoking
pipe. "Why, the Supreme Court
said the first 12 weren't jurymen at
all!"
There was laughter at that, but not
the triumphantly bitter kind you
might expect, just a laugh for it's
own sake.
Dave himself has already started
a long rest, physically fit, and with
his three years of hell already far
behind him in feeling, if not in
time.
"I'm going to stay here and take
it easy for a while. As for visiting
Stanford, I haven't thought about it
yet. By the way, how is the old
place—still going strong? Sure, call
me up if you want any more infor
mation. Sorry I can't tell you
more . . ."
It was Christmas in April over at
the Lamson's Friday.
They were holding open house for
reporters that careened up Creek
Drive as well as for anonymous
well-wishers just wanting to shake
Dave Lamson's hand.
Save for the tracked-up front
walk, there was no evidence inside
or out of Dr. Margaret Lamson's
shingled cottage that they were
doing anything but spending a rainy
afternoon. In the cozy living room
you'd find a handful of close friends
sitting by a hearth which Dave
tended, and a glass of lemonade in
everyone's hand.
Dave, himself, was in his shirt
sleeves, pink-cheeked and full
faced, laughing and talking so per
fectly composed, so ready with the
smart answer and the pleasant
quip, that if you didn't recognize
him you'd figure you were in the
wrong home.
More Nervous Than He
If you accidentally stumbled as
you step down into the room, Dave
would grab you and say "steady
there," and you'd realize that you
were more nervous than he was.
It seemed impossible that seven
hours before, he walked into the
courtroom, where he fought three

times for his life, acLually doubting
he would be freed.
"I thought District Attorney
Thomas would surely go again," he
laughed. "I can't tell you how it
felt when I suddenly realized what
had happened. You might call it in
credulity. One doesn't stop to ana
lyze feelings at a time like that."
Looks, Feels Fine
His voice was perfectly normal,
not so much as an extra line on his
face or a hint of fatigue in his
eyes.
His sister was bustling in the
kitchen, and as she came into the
living room with a box full of fire
wood, Dave took it from her and
set it on the hearth. Everyone was
smiling easily, not with the hyster
ical relief one might expect but in a
