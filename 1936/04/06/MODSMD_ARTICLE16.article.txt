# Lamson Opens House; 'Glad To Be Home'
## 
### Bob Eisenbach 
It was Christmas in April over at
the Lamson's Friday.
They were holding open house for
reporters that careened up Creek
Drive as well as for anonymous
well-wishers just wanting to shake
Dave Lamson's hand.
Save for the tracked-up front
walk, there was no evidence inside
or out of Dr. Margaret Lamson's
shingled cottage that they were
doing anything but spending a rainy
afternoon. In the cozy living room
you'd find a handful of close friends
sitting by a hearth which Dave
tended, and a glass of lemonade in
everyone's hand.
Dave, himself, was in his shirt
sleeves, pink-cheeked and full
faced, laughing and talking so per
fectly composed, so ready with the
smart answer and the pleasant
quip, that if you didn't recognize
him you'd figure you were in the
wrong home.
More Nervous Than He
If you accidentally stumbled as
you step down into the room, Dave
would grab you and say "steady
there," and you'd realize that you
were more nervous than he was.
It seemed impossible that seven
hours before, he walked into the
courtroom, where he fought three

times for his life, acLually doubting
he would be freed.
"I thought District Attorney
Thomas would surely go again," he
laughed. "I can't tell you how it
felt when I suddenly realized what
had happened. You might call it in
credulity. One doesn't stop to ana
lyze feelings at a time like that."
Looks, Feels Fine
His voice was perfectly normal,
not so much as an extra line on his
face or a hint of fatigue in his
eyes.
His sister was bustling in the
kitchen, and as she came into the
living room with a box full of fire
wood, Dave took it from her and
set it on the hearth. Everyone was
smiling easily, not with the hyster
ical relief one might expect but in a
kind of silent happiness, of satis
faction in the occurrence of a cer
tainty.
Dave knew no more what he was
going to do in a month than what
he was going to do that ngiht. "I've
grown used to living in the mo
ment," he laughed. "Ive found it
doesn't pay to plan and worry."
Partial to Writing
As for writing, he's still decidedly
partial to it. But despite the fact
