# Final Plans Laid For Soph Fete
## Work Starts on Concessions for Carnival 
### 
A closed date is Saturday, April
31, night of the annual Sophomore
Carnival, held in the Pavilion. Fea
turing booths of all sorts for both
food and games, and taxi-dancing
at ten cents a dance, the Carnival
has always been one of the out
standing afTairs sponsored by the
sophomore class.
Discontinued last year, it has now
been revived by the Class of 1938.
Both a soph committee and an ad
visory committee of Cardinals have
been working on it.
The usual concessions of ping
pong, popping balloons with darts,
pounding nails into boards, and
penny-tossing have been planned by
the various houses and halls. More
unusual ones are the pie-throwing,
rat-racing, voice-recording, and tur
tle-racing booths. Pink lemonade,
doughnuts, popcorn, and taffy ap
ples will be sold.
Charlie Horton's orchestra will
play for the dancing from 8 to 12
o'clock. The Pavilion will be divided
into two sections, one for dancing,
the other for booths.
