# Certified Report Cards Stymie Chicago Kiddies

### 
CHICAGO, April 5 (/}»).—When
little Willie flunks on Chicago's new
cheat-proof report cards, he stays
flunked—even when the cards get
home to pa.
The time worn loophole through
which young Will escaped sessions
in the woodshed by grace of an
eraser will he shut tight by this
newest weapon of the schoolma'am,
High School Superintendent Wil
liam Johnson said today.
Marks cannot be changed on the
new cards because there are carbon
copies.
And even if a poor grade were
erased in favor of a better, the card
would hold mute witness to the
falsehood. The reasons for the fail
ure would stand checked on the
following list:
Does not study enough, does not
do required work, absent too much,
poor reader, employed after school,
too many outside activities and poor
health.
The new cards actually will be
books, 40-page affairs, with five
pages devoted to each of eight
high school semesters.
They will trace Willie's scholastic
record from his first freshman day
to the commencement ceremony.
And, incidentally, let pa know if
he plays hookey very often.
