Though not yet complete, the cast
for the Sword and Sandals reading,
"Once in a Lifetime," Hollywood
satire by George Kaufman and
Moss Hart, to be given Wednesday,

waiting one or two days until the
spring play, "June Moon," is cast
before making the decision who
shall have the leading roles.
From among one of the largest
groups of students ever to try out
for a reading, Dawson and Assist

however, selected the following:
Paul Crary is the temperamental
movie director, Mr. Glogauer; Bob
Garred is George, who spoils the
sound effects with his peanut crack
ing antics; Kay Campbell is Susan
Walker.
Singer Shirley Jones is Miss
Chaser, one of the secretaries. Bar
bara Reinhardt, new to Stanford
dramatics, is Miss Leighton, the
other one. The difficult dialect parts
are taken by Bill Goldner and John
Steinhardt. Others in the cast in
clude Nancy Scoggins, Jerry
Schreiber, Paula George, Jeanne
Melton, and Walton Wickett.
