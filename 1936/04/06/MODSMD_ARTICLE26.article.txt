Bid for Stanford as site of the
1937 national convention of the Vet
erans of Future Wars was sent by
telegraph Saturday night lo National
Commander L. J. Gorin at Prince
ton University by the local "One-
Eyed Connelly" V.F.W. post.
This was the first official move of
the campus post, organized last week
by Dick Creamer, chairman of the
A.S.S.U. Committee on National and
Student Affairs.
Creamer, elected post commander
by 25 members at Saturday night's
special meeting, yesterday expressed
confidence that Stanford's conven
tion bid would be accepted by na
tional headquarters.
Only Bidder
Though no word had come last
night from Princeton, Creamer be
lieves Stanford the only contender
for the 19137 convention.
Principal purpose of the meeting,
set for August of next year, will be
to spend the bonus which Congress
is now considering paying each
member of the V.F.W. Representa
tive Mavarick, Texas democrat, last
week introduced a House bill pro
posing immediate payment of $1000
plus 31 years 3 per cent com
pounded interest to each 'â€¢veteran."
"It ought to be a tremendous con
vention," Creamer said. "Palo Alto
hotel managers have pledged full
co-operation, promising reduced
rates. Reservations are already
coming in, and local hostelries will
soon be filled."
"Mothers" Organize
The Home Fire Division, women's
auxiliary of the V.F.W., will prob
ably meet in Palo Alto at the same
time if Vassar College headquar
ters approve. Betty Grover, Ex
Committee member, has been named
"Grand High and Exalted Mother"
of the local Home Fire group.
Phil Coghlan, Rally Committee
head and secretary-treasurer of the
"One-Eeyed Connelly" Future Vet
erans, last night called for prospec
tive and charter members to meet
in the Ex Committee room of the
Old Union at 5 o'clock today.
