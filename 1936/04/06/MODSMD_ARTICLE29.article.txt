### Cray Creveling 
STRANGE, wasn't it? Lamson
went free and Hauptmann burned
in the chair on the same day.
Hauptmann was declared dead six
hours and 47 minutes after Lamson
stepped out of jail into a spring
shower at 11 o'clock Friday morn
ing.
Now that Hauptmann is dead, the
governor of New Jersey orders a
thorough investigation of the whole
affair. "Hoffman To Press Full In
vestigation" the headlines scream
now that Bruno is dead. Fine stuff!
THE LIBERTIES which the
American press takes with Ameri
can justice constitute rape. The en
tire Hauptmann trial was a disgrace
ful hippodroming of American jur
isprudence by the press, lawyers,
and everyone concerned.
The fault lies with the judge,
and yet. he only does what is de
manded of him by outside pres
sure. He has to think of re
election. If he were in office for
life, he could ban from his court
room all of the sob-sisters, trained
seals, stuffed ermine coats, scan
dal mongering photographers, and
the rest of justice's prostituters.
The solution, then, of how to put
an end to over-publicized trials is
to appoint all judges for life.
FEDERAL JUDGES are ap
pointed for life, and one can not
help but believe that if the Haupt
mann case had been handled in a
federal court, the affair would have
been carried off with some dignity,
less fanfare.
II" you want the low-down on
the Hauptmann trial, read a cer
tain chapter in "Mrs. Astor's
Horse," a hook treating with re
cent americana.
The author, Stanley Walker, re
veals how the sheriff charged every
member of the press ten dollars to
get in. But the reporters were
lucky. They got season tickets for
that amount, the rest of the spec
tators had to pay ten stones every
time they wanted to get in. Even
then they weren't sure of a seat.
People sat on the window sills, stood
along the wall, squatted on the
floor. The usual disorder of the trial
was increased by the tinkle of
breaking window panes and the
clatter of falling plaster.
THE WHOLE THING was a farce.
The American Bar Association de
claimed the treatment given it in
the newspapers. Learned jurists
commended only the judge whose
conduct of the case was as com
mendable as it could be under the
circumstances. The attorneys came
in for their share of damning by
lawyers who abhorred Riley's and j
Wilentz's spectacular tactics.
Clarence Darrow (who believes
Ilauptmann's death will hide for
ever the secret of the Lindbergh
kidnap case) pleaded for another
(rial because the German carpen
ter had never yet had a trial in 1
the "true sense of American jur
isprudence." However, some peo
ple believe that he got a trial in
the true American sense and that
is just why lie should have an
other one.
Little dignity remains in Amer
ican jurisprudence because the
elective judges cater to pressure j
from the newspapers who, in turn,
are catering to certain members of j
the reading public who, in turn, are j
beasts.
Students on the University of
California campus are now insured
.' gainst being called on in class
when unprepared. Give the agent a
nickel per class; if called on, the j
damaged party receives twenty-five J
cents.

the rest of justice's prostituters.
The solution, then, of how to put
an end to over-publicized trials is
to appoint all judges for life.
FEDERAL JUDGES are ap
pointed for life, and one can not
help but believe that if the Haupt
mann case had been handled in a
federal court, the affair would have
been carried off with some dignity,
less fanfare.
II" you want the low-down on
the Hauptmann trial, read a cer
tain chapter in "Mrs. Astor's
Horse," a hook treating with re
cent americana.
The author, Stanley Walker, re
veals how the sheriff charged every
member of the press ten dollars to
get in. But the reporters were
lucky. They got season tickets for
that amount, the rest of the spec
tators had to pay ten stones every
time they wanted to get in. Even
then they weren't sure of a seat.
People sat on the window sills, stood
along the wall, squatted on the
floor. The usual disorder of the trial
was increased by the tinkle of
breaking window panes and the
clatter of falling plaster.
THE WHOLE THING was a farce.
The American Bar Association de
claimed the treatment given it in
the newspapers. Learned jurists
commended only the judge whose
conduct of the case was as com
mendable as it could be under the
circumstances. The attorneys came
in for their share of damning by
lawyers who abhorred Riley's and j
Wilentz's spectacular tactics.
Clarence Darrow (who believes
Ilauptmann's death will hide for
ever the secret of the Lindbergh
kidnap case) pleaded for another
(rial because the German carpen
ter had never yet had a trial in 1
the "true sense of American jur
isprudence." However, some peo
ple believe that he got a trial in
the true American sense and that
is just why lie should have an
other one.
Little dignity remains in Amer
ican jurisprudence because the
elective judges cater to pressure j
from the newspapers who, in turn,
are catering to certain members of j
the reading public who, in turn, are j
beasts.
Students on the University of
California campus are now insured
.' gainst being called on in class
when unprepared. Give the agent a
nickel per class; if called on, the j
damaged party receives twenty-five J
cents.
STRANGE, wasn't it? Lamson
went free and Hauptmann burned
in the chair on the same day.
Hauptmann was declared dead six
hours and 47 minutes after Lamson
stepped out of jail into a spring
shower at 11 o'clock Friday morn
ing.
Now that Hauptmann is dead, the
governor of New Jersey orders a
thorough investigation of the whole
affair. "Hoffman To Press Full In
vestigation" the headlines scream
now that Bruno is dead. Fine stuff!
THE LIBERTIES which the
American press takes with Ameri
can justice constitute rape. The en
tire Hauptmann trial was a disgrace
ful hippodroming of American jur
isprudence by the press, lawyers,
and everyone concerned.
The fault lies with the judge,
and yet. he only does what is de
manded of him by outside pres
sure. He has to think of re
election. If he were in office for
life, he could ban from his court
room all of the sob-sisters, trained
seals, stuffed ermine coats, scan

the rest of justice's prostituters.
