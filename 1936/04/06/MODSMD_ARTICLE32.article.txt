PASADENA, April 5 (/P).â€”Robert
Tate Bakeman, California Institute
of Technology student, put his col
lege education to use Saturday in an
effort to save himself a speed law
violation fine.
He appeared before Kenneth C.
Newel on a charge of driving at 55
mies per hour in a residential area.
"Judge, I just couldn't have been
going that fast," he said.
Then the youth backed up his
contention with testimony about
relativity, wind resistance, and fric
tion.
Bakeman produced figures to
show that in order to reach a 55-
mile per hour speed it would have
been necessary for him to have had
and uninterrupted runway of 1400
feet.
He asserted no such space was af
forded at the point where Sergeant
Clarence H. Morris arrested him.
Sergeant Morris declined to be
impressed.
