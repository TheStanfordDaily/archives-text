# New Prison Warden Needs Longer Bed
## 
### 
When Court Smith prepared to
move to San Quentin for his new
home in the warden's quarters, he
first requested a new hed. He asked
that it be made to order—more than
7 feet long.
He further stated that the bed
which was the resting place of the
former warden, James H. Holohan,
for 8 years, just wouldn't do, even
though Holohan himself stood well
over the 6-foot mark. The prison
board asserted the new warden will
bring along his own bed from home.
Home economics majors at the
University of Oklahoma are now
called "Veterans of Future Mar
riages."
