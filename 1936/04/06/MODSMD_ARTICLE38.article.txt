BRUTUS TIIE JUGGLER;
MANEUVERS HURDLERS
It is interesting to read in the pa
pers from time to time of the amaz
ing juggling actions performed in
Berkeley by the old trouper, Coach
Brutus Hamilton.
Brutus will do almost anything to
get a relay team —at least so it
seems. Maybe it's only the foible
of circumstance, but in the last two
years he has done enough juggling
of his runners and hurdlers to run a
little competition to Harry Houdini
at his best.
Especially cagey is Brutus about
his hurdlers. He lias fenaygled
not one, but five of them to the
relay team from time to time.
First was Stout, who was North
Coast record-holder from Berkeley
High in both barrier events, but who
is now a steady one-lap man.
Then came Del Fishback, Sacto
Jaysee low hurdling star, who ap
pears every now and then in the
quarter.
Tom Moore, the long shank who
ran 14.2 at Fresno last spring, is
also drafted into the quarter mile
ranks if needed.
Fourth is Kent Weaver, last
year a star frosh hurdler, who is
now one of the Edwards' Field re
lay record holders. Weaver is an
other fellow who went to Menlo,
yearned to he a Stanford rough,
wasn't admitted, and is "getting
revenge" at Cal.
Lastly is Len Charvet, big time
politics mogul, aspirant for the stu
dent body presidency at Berkeley,
once a record holder in the lows,
who only recently started run
ning quarters.
NOT ONLY FROM HURDLES,
BUT ANYWHERE
Then, too, Mr. Hamilton is not
proud where he gets his relay men,
just as long as they can run close to
50 seconds.
He took Rob Hoavey a month
ago, gave that miler with the size
I.'! shoes a trial, and now Heavey is
on the relay team, doing better
than 51 seconds, despite the suit
case gambs.
Last year there was the case of
Everett Leek, who came out for
track just for the scenery, and was
developed into the best 440 man on
the team.
Jim Helmer, a great 220 man from
Piedmont, found too much compe
tition from George Anderson, took
up the quarter, and is now one of
Ihe best relay men on the Coast.
Lastly Brutus dipped into San
Mateo, got the light-tan Archie
Williams, and has him now as a
threat to any quarter miler in the
country.
So we must give credit to Brutus
for expansive imagination and high
class juggling. Whether, however,
his 1936 quartet will beat the Card
team is a question open to much ar
guing in the next three weeks.

at his best.
Especially cagey is Brutus about
his hurdlers. He lias fenaygled
not one, but five of them to the
relay team from time to time.
First was Stout, who was North
Coast record-holder from Berkeley
High in both barrier events, but who
is now a steady one-lap man.
Then came Del Fishback, Sacto
Jaysee low hurdling star, who ap
pears every now and then in the
quarter.
Tom Moore, the long shank who
ran 14.2 at Fresno last spring, is
also drafted into the quarter mile
ranks if needed.
Fourth is Kent Weaver, last
year a star frosh hurdler, who is
now one of the Edwards' Field re
lay record holders. Weaver is an
other fellow who went to Menlo,
yearned to he a Stanford rough,
wasn't admitted, and is "getting
revenge" at Cal.
Lastly is Len Charvet, big time
politics mogul, aspirant for the stu
dent body presidency at Berkeley,
once a record holder in the lows,
who only recently started run
ning quarters.
NOT ONLY FROM HURDLES,
BUT ANYWHERE
Then, too, Mr. Hamilton is not
proud where he gets his relay men,
just as long as they can run close to
50 seconds.
He took Rob Hoavey a month
ago, gave that miler with the size
I.'! shoes a trial, and now Heavey is
on the relay team, doing better
than 51 seconds, despite the suit
case gambs.
Last year there was the case of
Everett Leek, who came out for
track just for the scenery, and was
developed into the best 440 man on
the team.
Jim Helmer, a great 220 man from
Piedmont, found too much compe
tition from George Anderson, took
up the quarter, and is now one of
Ihe best relay men on the Coast.
Lastly Brutus dipped into San
Mateo, got the light-tan Archie
Williams, and has him now as a
threat to any quarter miler in the
country.
So we must give credit to Brutus
for expansive imagination and high
class juggling. Whether, however,
his 1936 quartet will beat the Card
team is a question open to much ar
guing in the next three weeks.

BRUTUS TIIE JUGGLER;
MANEUVERS HURDLERS
It is interesting to read in the pa
pers from time to time of the amaz
ing juggling actions performed in
Berkeley by the old trouper, Coach
Brutus Hamilton.
Brutus will do almost anything to
get a relay team —at least so it
seems. Maybe it's only the foible
of circumstance, but in the last two
years he has done enough juggling
of his runners and hurdlers to run a
little competition to Harry Houdini
at his best.
