# Frosh Mermen Swim Against Fullerton Today
## Champ J.C. Team Favored Over Stanford; Towne, Sellers in 100-yd. Sprint 
### 
All-Americans from Fullerton |
i Junior College and High School
come up against what Coach Thorn- J
ton calls "Stanford's greatest fresh
man swimming team" this afternoon |
at 4 o'clock in the Encina pools.
In spite of Stanford names —Need- ;
ham, Towne, Winkleman —Fullerton i
lias a bunch picked to win. As a
I high school team last year they
i were the greatest assemblage on the |
Coast and the second best prep team !
in the country.
Fancy Diving
Biggest attraction of the after- j
noon should be staged from the 10- :
foot board when Fullerton's Chap- i
man, judged second among high
school divers, performs it out with
the freshman star, Winkleman, j
judged third among those same
] high school divers.
Fullerton hoped to pull a fast one
when they asked for a sprint race
(100 yards) in the breast stroke in
stead of the customary 200 yards.
Their breast stroke ace, Sellers, is j
I fast for the short distances but tires j
in anything over 100 yards.
Towne in Sprint
) Thornton, with a P.A. champ in I
I 100 breast stroke, Don Towne, was ;
only too willing to comply to the re- j
quest, and a rip-snorting race is j
sure to result. Sellers is about a |
1 second slower than the Stanford j
j freshman.
The Indian yearlings' captain, 1
Winfield Needham, is favored to take '
| the 220 and the 440. Spence Moeh
| ler will represent the freshmen in
the 50 and 100 against all-American
j Witaker of Fullerton. The meet is ;
■ open to the public.
