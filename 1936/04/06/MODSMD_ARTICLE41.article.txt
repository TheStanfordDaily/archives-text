j Bruins, 30-34.
MacKenzie, Godman, Scatena, and
Vibert had an easy time of it
against U.S.C. relaymen, but it
I turned out that their win was Stan
ford's only one against Troy.
Against U.C.L.A. the Indians
showed up much better. Vibert
emerged the outstanding meet fa
vor, winning the 100, and anchoring
both the 400-yard relay and the
medley relay teams to victories.
Walker handily won the 150-yard !
: back-stroke, and Harvey came
thrpugh with an equally decisive
win in the 200-yard breast-stroke, j
: Captain Tom Boothe did a bit of \
j brilliant diving to capture that event
for the Indians.
