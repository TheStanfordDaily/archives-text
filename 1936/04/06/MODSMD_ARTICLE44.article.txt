# Farm Host For Olympic Tryouts
## Masters Grants Permit For Use of Diamond 
### 
That Stanford will be host to
Olympic baseball tryoutees became
probable yesterday when it was
learned that Graduate Manager Al
Masters has given the Olympic
Committee permission to use the
Sunken Diamond next June.
Unless present plans are changed,
the tryout period for all western
players will be held here from June
20 to June 30. Eastern trials will be
held in Baltimore at (he same time
and those chosen for the team will
leave immediately for the Olympic
Games in Berlin.
Harry Wolter, varsity baseball
coach, who will probably coach one
of the Olympic teams, received the
letter from the Olympic Committee
asking to use the Stanford diamond.
Athletes who wish to enter the
tryouts will be required to pay $100
admission fee. This money will be
used to help defray the expenses of
sending the team to Germany.
