# Track Meets Cancelled After Wet Weather
## Indians Drop Two Cinder Tilts To Delay Premier Show on Campus Oval 
### 
With unseasoned jump takeofls
soft as slush and rain and wind beat
ing down the straightaway, Al Mas
ters and Sam McDonald went into 1
conference, decided to call off the 1
Olympic Club and S.F.J.C. track
meets, originally scheduled as An
gell Field openers Saturday.
The Olympic Club meet, which
was to be the first home appearance
of Dink Templeton's 193G squad,
and was headlined by such names
as Ben Eastman, Walter Marty,
Johnny Mottram, Elroy Robinson,
Slinger Dunn, and others, will prob
ably be canceled altogether, as no
applicable future date presents it- j
self.
The Stanford Frosh, however, will
probably arrange another date with j
San Francisco J.C., as the '39 sched
ule was light in the first place. ]
Also rained out over the week
end was a U.S.C.-Fresno Slate meet j
in the valley; of interest to local j
track fans was the strong showing j
of California in beating U.C.L.A. 97- !
34 in muddy conditions in the south.!
Stanford meets U.C.L.A. here next j
Saturday.
