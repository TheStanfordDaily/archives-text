# Frosh Tennis Meet Rained Out Friday
## 
### 
Wet weather intervened and saved
the Stanford frosh tennis sextet
from a possible licking at the hands
of the heavily favored California
yearlings last Friday.
Due to numerous conflicts in
schedule, the date of renewal of the
Bear-Indian papoose rivalry has not
as yet been determined.
