## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" The 						Code Is A Matter of Practical Expedience as Well as Personal Honor 
### 
Well, the large majority has coine out in
favor ol' the Honor Code. The Republic is
Saved! We can all settle back and rest in
peace that righteousness has triumphed. So?
Men's and Women's Councils, however, are
made of sterner stuff. The Councils face the
task of effectively maintaining a morale. Their
job is just beginning; their next step is a panel
now being arranged for Wednesday night in
the Women's Clubhouse.
There were some comments on ballots in
the recent Daily poll that the Honor Code was
0.K., that Tin-: Daily and the Councils were
seeing ghosts. But there were others imply
ing the Code was a failure, that it worked for
ordinary students but fell down for football
players.
The great mass of the students do not be
lieve Ibis. But it is not only upon the mass
that the Code depends for its life. If a mi
nority is honestly dissatisfied, the dissatis
faction easily can spread and impair the
workings of the Code.
There is no doubt that the Code must be
preserved. The fundamental idea is sound.
And the fundamental idea is that student
enforcement is more efficient than the proctor
system.
It is a foolproof system because it is more
a matter of practical protection than of per
sonal honor. It becomes incumbent on the

individual student to see that it is enforced,
because the class average must be preserved.
Most cases of violation occur where stu
dents place inordinate emphasis on grades.
The majority does not care enough about the
little chirographs on report cards to violate a
sense of morality and honor, and many who
care a great deal for grades also have a great
fear of their own consciences, or the workings
of the Code.
The obvious thing to do is to make the Code
efficient by impressing it upon the students
that they must enforce their own Code by
turning in offenders. It has been shown by
the Ml thai the vast majority of students will
not turn in offenders, even when the violation
is flagrant.
The reason is that expulsion from the Uni
versity is commonly considered the result of
violation of the Honor Code. That it is not
always so is clearly shown by the fact that
in the recent debacle how mentioned on the
bulletin board by the Ad building, Certain
Students were not expelled from the Univer
sity, but penalized by being made to flunk
the course and take a quarter's more Work.
If this is a new trend in administration of
the Code, or if it has been a long-time policy
of the Councils, it should be explained, so that
the fear of causing a fellow student to be
dishonorably dismissed from the University
does not prevent efficient enforcement.
