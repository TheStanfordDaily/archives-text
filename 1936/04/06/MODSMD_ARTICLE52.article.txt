# Lamson Goes Free, But How Far Does Freedom Go?
## 
### 
.Justice dismissed two of its most famous
criminal cases Friday - the result, one de
fendant is now dead; the other is ollicially
reinstated as a respected citizen of the United
States and Palo Alto.
Bruno Richard Hauptmann Friday paid
the recognized price for kidnapping and mur
dering Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., four years
ago when a New Jersey electrocution special
ist pulled the switch that climaxed the most
famous judicial sideshow in the history of
American court procedure.
Six hours earlier, Pacific Coast headlines
had screamed that another famous case was
ended with the dismissal of charges that Da
vid Lamson had killed his wife nearly three
years earlier.
Ilauptmann is dead. Guilty or innocent,
and lay opinion can be found to argue both
ways, the ease is closed.
lint Lamson is living. And that case will
never be closed, in his mind, or in those of
several people, for many years.
Ollicially, David Lamson is just a Stanford
graduate and Palo Alto resident.
Unofficially, however, he is a man with a
record, and will always be under society's sur
veillance. Consequently, many of the ordinary
run of professions are closed to him; he is
no longer the normal citizen.
But there are fields where Lamson's ex
perience, ability, and keen brain can make his
life worth living and can be of undisputed
value to society. The former University Press
executive is reported to be considering work
on penal reform and criminology. Three years
of imprisonment have given him an experi
ence, insight, and sincerity that might even
make him an eminent sociologist. And Lam
son can write.
So the professional Held is not closed so
tight that he cannot hope to crash it.
Neither his guilt nor his innocence was
proved conclusively in court. One thing, how
ever, has been obvious from the start —

David Lanison cannot be compared to the
gangsters or thugs who clutter up America's
courtrooms.
Once again a free man, Lamson has the
personality and intelligence to make him a
social asset.
All he needs is the right profession—and a
chance.
