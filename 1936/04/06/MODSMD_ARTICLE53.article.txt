The Chi O hashboys were on the anxious scat last
week, and it wasn't for kidnapping the Lindbergh baby,
either. It seems that the hashboys .spend their spare
hours between lunch and dinner shifting a sofa from
the second floor to the third floor and back again. The
gals don't quite like the looks of it in either place,
ao they keep it in motion.
But one night the hashboys foxed them. While the
gals wore housemeeting, the boys set the sofa down for
a while, dipped their hands into the kitchen cracker
barrel and put crackers in the beds on the sleeping
poch. Just for variety, they short-sheeted one bed.
A couple of days went by and since nothing hap
pened one of the kitchen utensils squealed. The
house proxy then threatened the boys with dishon
orable dismissal, the boys countered with a threat to
picket the house, "Chi O kitch unfair to disorganized
labor, but the conflict was resolved when the gals
threatened to get even some other way. The hashmen
are now gingerly watching for itching powder in their
hasher's jackets.
A story has just reached the International Hasher's
Syndicate. It happened during the hoopee season.
The Stanford hardwood bounders achieved a good deal
of prominence in the city papers during the year by
performing novel tricks with catcher's masks and shov
els, so that everybody was saying that Bunny was
putting all his acts in one basketball team.
This was even before Easter, too. However, the
great prominence acquired by our laughing boys did
not turn their head, that is, not to be kissed when
somebody put all their bags in one Exit.
It seems that the barbers always become authority
on matters financial, political, and athletic. So the
Union barbers one day were discoursing at length
about the prowess of the local team after the first
Washington game. Court strategy and morale were
carefully gone into.
To make conversation, the barber asked the victim
in his chair, who had kept pretty silent during the
sermon, if he had gone to the game the night before.
"Yes, I was there," said Dinty Moore.
