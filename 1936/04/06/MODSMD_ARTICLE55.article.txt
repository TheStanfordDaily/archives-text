Hill-billy opinion as represented by Rep. Claude A.
Fuller, D., Ark., is up in arms against the satirical
activities of the Veterans of Future Wars and the
Future Gold Star Mothers of America. The move
ments inspired by a Princeton undergraduate are
"communistic" and a "boring from within against our
government." Each Future Gold Star Mother and
Veteran is a "termite" busy piling up sawdust.
* * * *
The Far West sends its thanks to Representative
Fuller. No organization had been formed to any ex
tent on this campus because its nature was not quite
clear. Now that the truth is out, the movement can
die. If not for the Arkansas Paul Revere, many of
us might now be plotting the "gory details" of bloody
revolution.
Representative Fuller is also to be commended on
giving some excellent advice to college coeds for it is
his opinion that they should stop talking about having
baby sons and "devote their time and attention to
lipstick, cosmetics, society and a study of birth control."
* * * *
This is disaster- preventing comment, for not only
have the gals been talking about having babies but
rumor has it that coeds have also been concerning
themselves with such subjects as the class war, Marx
ian dialecticism, Hegelian ethnocentricism, Jefferson
ian democracy, and integral and differential calculus.
The services of a Congressman are multifold as
Representative Fuller so ably proves and for his
noble, patriotic, unselfish and courageous stand against
the Gold Star Mothers and Vets of the future, he
deserves our thanks as the savior of our youthful lives
and youthful fortunes.
