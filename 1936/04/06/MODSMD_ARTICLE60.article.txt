# Bull Session
## SPRING, SHE IS HERE 
### 
Three thousand miles away in !
America's cradle-land spring is a
pretty diffident lady. Her entrance, j
like many a knowing dowager's, is j

made impressive
by delay. She
honors old man
Adam's children
only after they
have stood for a
good long time in
winter's sour
slush. Even in
April, her month
of glory, she often I
shoots them a|
chilly glance, and
always reserves
as 1-eminders the

rustle of last autumn's leaves and |
old branches.
Everyone is thankful for spring ,
back there. The curried debutante I
can now mince on God's own side- !
walks and not on manicured the- '
ater lobby carpets. The threat of i
employment is gone for the Union '
Square bum, for all the snow is
shoveled and melted, and he can bet j
on kind-hearted housefraus with
open ears and fairly open ice boxes.
* * *
When spring smiles on places that i
know winter's ugly face, it means
more than sunshine and roses.
Magically, rib-sticking vittels are
served from soup-kitchens, and
melons ripe for the cutting sprout
from inky corporation ledgers.
In Manhattan spring means rest
ing time, with something to rest
from. The shows are running
smoothly on Broadway's incandes
cent tentacles, and people go to J
Gallagher's and Barney's after the
ater for food, not ballast. One drinks
for an added increment of warmth, !
not because one needs another shot
of anti-freeze.
In America's arctic spring is a re
ward, which presumes a sacrifice.
It's getting the interest on a lot of
sockcd-away capital, getting it in a 1
lump, too, with God's mandate that
it be squandered.
* * *
No wonder the job-shackled east
erner looks enviously at promotion
pictures of westerners on sun-swept
beaches. He not only probably, but
actually devours a Stanford circu
lar, replete with palms, blinding
light and clean shade, muttering,
"Lucky bums."
The epithet is accurate. We're
lucky beyond the wishes of anyone

but an insane Nature; and we're
perpetual bums (in the nice sense,
of course). Hardly is there a day in
the three school quarters when we
work in the sheer necessity of work
ing. We can always excuse ourselves
with the tropical rain that consti
tutes our winter or the commanding
order to strike that constitutes our
spring.
Actually, this is perpetual Arcady.
Meteorologists can take their vernal
equinoxes and use them.
Spring, ol' girl, we didn't even
miss you!

When spring smiles on places that i
know winter's ugly face, it means
more than sunshine and roses.
Magically, rib-sticking vittels are
served from soup-kitchens, and
melons ripe for the cutting sprout
from inky corporation ledgers.
In Manhattan spring means rest
ing time, with something to rest
from. The shows are running
smoothly on Broadway's incandes
cent tentacles, and people go to J
Gallagher's and Barney's after the
ater for food, not ballast. One drinks
for an added increment of warmth, !
not because one needs another shot
of anti-freeze.
In America's arctic spring is a re
ward, which presumes a sacrifice.
It's getting the interest on a lot of
sockcd-away capital, getting it in a 1
lump, too, with God's mandate that
it be squandered.

No wonder the job-shackled east
erner looks enviously at promotion
pictures of westerners on sun-swept
beaches. He not only probably, but
actually devours a Stanford circu
lar, replete with palms, blinding
light and clean shade, muttering,
"Lucky bums."
The epithet is accurate. We're
lucky beyond the wishes of anyone

but an insane Nature; and we're
perpetual bums (in the nice sense,
of course). Hardly is there a day in
the three school quarters when we
work in the sheer necessity of work
ing. We can always excuse ourselves
with the tropical rain that consti
tutes our winter or the commanding
order to strike that constitutes our
spring.
Actually, this is perpetual Arcady.
Meteorologists can take their vernal
equinoxes and use them.
Spring, ol' girl, we didn't even
miss you!

Three thousand miles away in !
America's cradle-land spring is a
pretty diffident lady. Her entrance, j
like many a knowing dowager's, is j

made impressive
by delay. She
honors old man
Adam's children
only after they
have stood for a
good long time in
winter's sour
slush. Even in
April, her month
of glory, she often I
shoots them a|
chilly glance, and
always reserves
as 1-eminders the

rustle of last autumn's leaves and |
old branches.
Everyone is thankful for spring ,
back there. The curried debutante I
can now mince on God's own side- !
walks and not on manicured the- '
ater lobby carpets. The threat of i
employment is gone for the Union '
Square bum, for all the snow is
shoveled and melted, and he can bet j
on kind-hearted housefraus with
open ears and fairly open ice boxes.
