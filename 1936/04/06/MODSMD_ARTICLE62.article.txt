# Star Only Flaw In "Rose Marie," Says Reviewer
## 
### 
"ROSE MARIE, I love you" . . .
I and Nelson Eddy, and Lake Tahoe, J
] and the whole entertaining, im- j

plausible Friml op- j
eretta, now playing j
at the Stanford The
ater.
Jeanette Mac Do- ;
aid, famous opera |
star, goes to the res- '

| cue of her brother, who is hiding
: out in the Canadian woods after i
! escaping from prison and killing a 1
j member of the Mounted Police in
I the process. Nelson Eddy is the
: "Mountie" sent out to get him. You !
i can probably guess the rest, so I
won't spoil it by telling.
The only flaw in the picture is
Jeanette Mac Donald. Or, to be more
j gracious, Jeanette Mac Donald's
; voice. If the rarefied atmosphere of
I Lake Tahoe improves the recording
of singers' voices, as the producers
claim, may I suggest Mount Everest j
as the scene of Miss Mac Donald's 1
next picture? Or else that she be
teamed with some star whose sing- !
ing won't show her up. â€”B. Sweet I
