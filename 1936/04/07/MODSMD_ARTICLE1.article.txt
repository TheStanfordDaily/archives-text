# 225 Dead As Gales, Fires Sweep South
## Thousands Are Injured As Tornadoes Hit 6 States; Damage Totals Millions 
### 
GAINESVILLE (Ga.), April 6 (/P).
—Spring wind-storms swirling
through the South with fire adding
to their destructive force left more
than 225 known dead, thousands of
injured, and millions of dollars in
property damage in their wake to
day.
Striking just as the working day
began, the latest of the tornadoes
laid waste the business section here,
killing upward of 75. Flames which
seared the wreckage hampered res
cue forces.
New Blow Falls
The blow fell even as workers
were removing the dead from the
devastated westside residential sec
tion of the thriving little city of
Tupelo in northeast Mississippi
where 124 were known to be dead.
Fire also added to the gravity of the
situation there.
Estimates of relief authorities on
property damage in the two towns
hardest hit of the tornado stricken
communities ran from $1,000,000 to
$6,000,000.
Rescue workers feared the death
toll here might mount appreciably
as the wreckage was cleared.
Six states suffered from the erratic
storms which danced about Sunday
and today from Arkansas to South
Carolina.
The storms struck first in Arkan
sas, twisted eastward into Missis
sippi and Alabama, and then lashed
at Tennessee and skipped into Geor
gia and South Carolina.
Path Irregular
Cutting an irregular pattern of
wreckage, the tornadoes leveled
and damaged structures along a
dotted path ranging from a hundred
feet or so to more than 400 yards
wide in the afTected areas.
At Tupelo, where relief workers
estimated more than 1,000 were in
jured, a relief train from Memphis
brought a corps of physicians, nurses
and needed medical supplies. In
jured were distributed among near
by cities as quickly as they could
be moved.
