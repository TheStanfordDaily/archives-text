# Basis Of Acting Called Universal
## English Professor Talks on Classical, New Drama 
### 
The fundamentals of modern and
classic acting are the same. Over
tones make the difference, Dr.
Margery Bailey, assistant professor
of English and general director of
the course in stage classic produc
tions, told a Stanford Radio Hour
audience last night.
"Where classic acting was found
ed upon emotion and expression,
modern acting is essentially repres
sion and suggestion. The chief thing
which the modern actor has in
common with the classic actor is his
acceptance of the fact that he is be
fore us to make us feel as he seems
to do," Dr. Bailey declared.
Classic acting depends upon actors
who "have an air of ease, gracious
ness, light readiness, and flexibility
of body and mind which make us
happily confident that he can not
only face, but manage, any situa
tion great or small.
Dr. Bailey sees a growing force
towards the "true depth of art—to
see one's own generation in uni
versal terms of suffering and ex
altation."
It is highly possible, she said, that
we shall have no longer classic or
modern schools of acting, but simply
sound actors."
