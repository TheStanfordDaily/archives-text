# D. G.'s, El Toro To Break the Ice Join At Dinner
## 
### 
The Hall-Row-friendship band
l wagon got two customers last night
I when officials of Delta Gamma and
! El Toro announced plans for an
i exchange dinner between the
; sorority and eating club Thursday
| night.
The revolutionary move was
hatched out in conference between
Toro and Degee socialites over the
! week-end, and received official
: sanction of the organizations at
i house and club meetings last night.
Number one in the move for closer
I contact between the two campus
: factions, the gals who frosted some
! east windows to discourage Phi
Delts and the men with the finger
j in every campus pie will gather to
! crook little fingers over water glasses
i and heckle hashers.
Conversation topics on the Thurs
i day night docket are the weather
j and the relative merits of food
j from different campus kitchens.
Subjects which probably will not be
i mentioned are the coming spring
I elections and the Masque Ball King
| Queen contest.
