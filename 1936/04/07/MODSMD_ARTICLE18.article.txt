# Museum Locomotive Sailed Around Horn
## 
### Allen Drury 
The locomotive that came around
ihe Horn and was greeted on its first
run with a salute of 35 guns is today
the largest single exhibit in the
Stanford Museum.
Created Sensation
The "Governor Stanford," as the
"ngine was christened, was No. 1
of the Central Pacific Hail road, and
created as much stir in its day as
'.he latest streamlined train does
today.
Built in 1863 by Richard Norris
of Philadelphia, the locomotive was
brought around Cape Horn in the
sailing ship "Herald of the Morn
ing. It arrived in San Francisco
August SJ. 1863. and was transferred
to the schooner "Anna H. Forbes,"
which took it to Sacramento Octo
ber 7, 1863.

Greeted by Salute
After a trial run which called
forth a salute of 35 guns, it was used
as a switch engine and for local
service, being too light for road
! work.
In 1804 the "Governor Stanford,"
now the property of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, was on its way to
i the junk heap. At the suggestion of
S.P. officials it was added to the Mu
seum's large collection of Stanfor
diana, making the last run under its
own power.
Museum Wall Cut
When it arrived on the Farm, it
was found that the engine was too
large to enter the Museum by any
ordinary means. It was necessary to
cut a hole in the wall of the building
j and pull the train through.
