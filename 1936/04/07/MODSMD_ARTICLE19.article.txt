Student Body President Wally
Brooke occupied the chair at the
; meeting which was officially one of
the A.S.S.U. Committee on National
| and Student Affairs of which Crea-
I mer is chairman. Later Brooke
turned over the gavel to Creamer,
who reported that Stanford's bid
i for the 1937 national convention of
I the V.F.W. had been sent to na
j tional headquarters at Princeton, but
that as yet no reply had been re
ceived. He said, however, that he
, felt confident that the invitation
| would be accepted.
In response to Commander Crea
| mer's request for more officers, the
post elected Brooke to the position
j of national corresponding secretary.
1 Commander Creamer commented,
j "The matter of correspondence in
| connection with the convention will
j be left entirely up to Brooke."
Objective of the V.F.W. as outlined
by Commander Creameu is the im
j mediate payment of $1000 plus 31
years' interest at 3 per cent to all
"veterans" between the ages of 18
[ and 36.
Plan Parade
Mitchel Saadi suggested that April
j 21, when a "seditious peace demon
stration" is scheduled, would be an
appropriate date for a preparedness
parade, Commander Creamer ap-
I pointed a committee to plan the
1 counter demonstration against "this
un-American movement."
Commander Creamer explained
that the payment of dues would be
| postponed until after the bonus bill
| introduced in Congress by Repre
sentative Mavarick, Texas Democrat,
j is passed.
Acting upon a motion made from
i the floor by Brooke, Commander
Creamer appointed Sterling Cot
j trell chairman of a committee to
I investigate the possibility of stag
ing the next war in the proximity
I of Paris so that leaves to the gay
| city might be assured. Brooke sug
: gested also that the "rates" at the
| French capital might also be studied.
Betty Grover, Grand High Exalted
Mother of the local Home Fire Di
| vision, declared, "The mothers will
j object to this 'rates' investigation."
Brooke Restates
Thereupon Brooke amended his
J motion so that the investigation be
I of "hotel rates."
Phil Coghlan, secretary-treasurer
of the post, moved that the organi
zation adopt red, white, and blue
shirts as its official uniforms in or
der to present a united front. The
motion was tabled, however, after
Commander Creamer asserted, "The
possibility of receiving $1,000 should
be enough to keep any organization
together."
A resolution was passed to the
effect that seditious, un-American
practices be opposed wholeheartedly
by all members of the organization.

that as yet no reply had been re
ceived. He said, however, that he
, felt confident that the invitation

In response to Commander Crea

post elected Brooke to the position

1 Commander Creamer commented,
j "The matter of correspondence in

Objective of the V.F.W. as outlined

years' interest at 3 per cent to all
"veterans" between the ages of 18
[ and 36.
Plan Parade
Mitchel Saadi suggested that April
j 21, when a "seditious peace demon
stration" is scheduled, would be an
appropriate date for a preparedness
parade, Commander Creamer ap-
I pointed a committee to plan the
1 counter demonstration against "this
un-American movement."
Commander Creamer explained
that the payment of dues would be
| postponed until after the bonus bill
| introduced in Congress by Repre
sentative Mavarick, Texas Democrat,
j is passed.
Acting upon a motion made from
i the floor by Brooke, Commander
Creamer appointed Sterling Cot
j trell chairman of a committee to
I investigate the possibility of stag
ing the next war in the proximity
I of Paris so that leaves to the gay
| city might be assured. Brooke sug
: gested also that the "rates" at the
| French capital might also be studied.
Betty Grover, Grand High Exalted
Mother of the local Home Fire Di
| vision, declared, "The mothers will
j object to this 'rates' investigation."
Brooke Restates
Thereupon Brooke amended his
J motion so that the investigation be
I of "hotel rates."
Phil Coghlan, secretary-treasurer
of the post, moved that the organi
zation adopt red, white, and blue
shirts as its official uniforms in or
der to present a united front. The
motion was tabled, however, after
Commander Creamer asserted, "The
possibility of receiving $1,000 should
be enough to keep any organization
together."
A resolution was passed to the
effect that seditious, un-American
practices be opposed wholeheartedly
by all members of the organization.
Crowds unprecedented in the his
tory of the Ex Committee room
| stormed the student government
sanctuary yesterday afternoon to
! attend a meeting of the One-Eyed
Connelly Post of the Veterans of
Future Wars. Commander Dick
| Creamer was overwhelmed by the
enthusiastic support of charter and
prospective members of the post.
