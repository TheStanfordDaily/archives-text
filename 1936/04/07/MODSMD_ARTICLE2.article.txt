# Flays Teachers' Loyalty Oaths
## St. Mary's Head Declares Practice 'Infantile' 
### 
Declaiing that his institution
would never countenance the tak
ing of loyalty oatlis by its teach
ers,. Brother Albert, president of
St. Mary's College, yesterday termed
the practice "one of the most per
nicious in modern education."
"St. Mary's College has never
compelled an oath of any type from
the laymen who make up half its
teaching staff, - ' said Brother Albert,
"and as far as I am concerned it
never will. Compulsory oaths are
infantileâ€”a reduction of a mature
man to the level of a prisoner given
parole.
"When an executive engages a
professor," he continued, "he is ex
pressing his belief in that man's
honesty, ability, and integrity. If
he does not trust that employee's
devotion to the cause of truth he
does not hire him. Hence, enforc
ing an oath is superfluous as well as
insulting to both parties concerned."
