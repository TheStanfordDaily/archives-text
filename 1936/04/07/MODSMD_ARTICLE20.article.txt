# Fire Damages S.F. Bay Bridge
## 16 Workers Escape In Spectacular Rescue 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 6 (/P).â€”
A 30-ecnt red hot rivet caused $10,-
000 damage and endangered 16
workers on the huge Bay Bridge
today by igniting a wooden pier
fender soaked with creosote.
The spectacular (ire, which called
out all available fire boats and sent
dense smoke billowing hundreds of
feet into the air, occurred just cast,
of mid-bay Yerba Buena Island on
a pier supporting (he western end
of a 1400-foot cantilever span.
A workman on the bridge deck,
185 feet above the water, dropped
the rivet. It landed directly on the

wooden fender which is around the
base of the concrete pier and about
10 feet above and below the water
line.
Two city fircboats and one from
the island Navy depot finally doused
the flames, but not before they had
wrecked the fender, blister
ed paint over 100 feet, up the steel
bridge tower, and spread soot to
the very top, 250 feet above the
water.
Charles H. Purcell, chief engineer
of the bridge, said no part of the
actual structure had been damaged.
