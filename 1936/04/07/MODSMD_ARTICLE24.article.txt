# Wood Sculptor Talks Tonight
## Alec Miller To Illustrate With Own Carvings 
### 
Alec Miller, wood sculptor, will
illustrate his lecture tonight in Ihe
Assembly Hall with some of his own
wood carvings, and slides. He is to
speak on "Tendencies in Modern
Sculpture," including modes from
Rodin to Archipenko.
Mr. Miller is from Chipping
Campden, England. He is a mem
ber of the Art Workers' Guild, and
for a number of years his work has
been shown at many exhibitions, in
chiding The Royal Academy, the
Arts and Crafts Society's Exhibi
tions, the Palace of Arts (British
Empire Exhibitions). Small exhi
bitions devoted solely to his work
have also been held at important
galleries both in England and the
United States.
It has been said that wood lends
a warmth and, under Mr. Miller's
touch, an "aliveness" to portraiture
that cannot be obtained in cold
marble. Those who have seen his
work exhibited in the museums of
Cleveland, Rochester, and other
cities, testify to his remarkable .'.kill
in this field of art.
