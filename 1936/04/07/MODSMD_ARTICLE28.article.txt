A GROUP of Republican women
banded themselves together about
four years ago and founded an or
ganization to study American poli
tics and government. They called
their organization PRO-AMERICA
and dedicated themselves to the ed
ucation of women.
The organization has grown with
the increasing anti-Roosevelt senti
ment and today it has all of four
thousand members, mainly in west
ern states. Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt
I wrote their national constitution
and the organization has incorpo
rated itself in the several states in
which it has recruited sufficient
strength.

BUT PRO-AMERICA has fallen
into the hands of the Republican
Party, and the original idea of edu
cating American women politically
has degenerated into a movement
endeavoring to inculcate into hapless
women the Republican philosophy
of government.
f I hey are now devoting themselves
to anti-New Dealism and nothing
else. Only one side of the question
before the American electorate to
day will be presented to these ladies.
Their plans for education are now
merely schemes for propaganda.

SAMPLES OF what Pro-America I
members must stomach and digest:
A deed a day to defeat the New
Deal. Wake up American women! |
The issues of the presidential cam- j
paign are vital! The trend toward a !
dictatorship in our United States
threatens the destruction of govern
ment of, by, and for the people.
"In this real crisis in our history,
let every woman be a modern Paul
Revere and sound the alarm to 'the
man on the street' and the family
on the farm. DO YOUR PART!
"What every woman can do: Keep
a pair of scissors on your desk and
clip from daily papers editorials
and statements made by responsible
business men, manufacturers, mer
chants or bankers and unprejudiced
students of government, be they
Democrats or Republicans, con
taining facts and figures which show
conclusively:
The mounting COST OF LIVING
due to New Deal measures—
The TAX BURDEN which will
rest heavily upon every man, wom
an and child by reason of the
waste and reckless expenditures of
the Roosevelt Administration—
The DANGER OF INFLATION
with its further devaluation of the
dollar—
The SOCIALISTIC AND COM
MUNISTIC INFLUENCE behind
many of the so-called economic and
social reforms perpetrated by this
administration under the misnomer
of 'Social Justice'."
AND THAT ISN'T ALL. Samples
continue:
"Write to the Liberty League, The
Crusaders, The National Economy
League, Sentinels of the Republic,
and other organizations which issue
leaflets or publications, and secure
the material which they publish.
"Enclose either a clipping or one
of these pamphlets in each letter you
write and enlist your friends to
carry out this kind of work among
their group of friends.
"Inquire whether your friends in
diflerent sections of the country are
members of the Republican organ
ization in their own town or com
munity, and if not, why not."

THAT'S EDUCATION! May the
Lord deliver us from education and
give us just good old fashioned cam
paign bunk.
