# 'Old Thirteen' Replaced By New Ladder Truck
## 
### Dave Leff 
The old order changeth, and the [
' oldest active piece of fire-fighting
| equipment on the Stanford campus j
was replaced last week by a shiny
i new 50-foot extension ladder
I truck.
j "Old thirteen," as the boys some
times called her, is and has been for
| the last quarter century a model T
Ford of ISI2 vintage, mounting
chemical extinguisher apparatus. ,
Present at Big Games J
Far from a museum piece, this
| little truck is considered the most j
j valuable fire-fighter on the Farm. It
i has been present at every Big Game
and other Important event since its
! acquisition, and has been the for
| midable guard of all prc-Big Game '<
j bonfires.
The efficiency of this seeming an
tique lies in its ease of maneuver- j
, ing, and in the localized spray of 1
chemical extinguisher that it can di- j
rect at fires. By far the majority of j
j

Stanford conflagrations are small i
affairs; in the event of a grass fire, |
the larger and more up-to-date !
pump and tank machines are called !
into action.

Contrary to what one might slip- ;
pose, "Number Thirteen" will not j
be placed beside the "Governor ]
Stanford" locomotive in the mu- j
seum, but is to be turned over to j
the military department, which |
maintains an auxiliary fire service '
working in conjunction with the J
Stanford Fire Department.
The new ladder truck is also a j
Ford chassis mounting two 28-foot !
ladders which extend to a 50-foot j
length. It is regarded as the equal I
of any other ladder truck with
comparable fire-protection respon- \
sibility.
Co-ordinate with the increased !
size of the fire-vehicle department, j
a new entrance to the firehouse is i
now in progress of construction. |
This will replace the old single exit j
with three gateways, thus allow
ing each truck and car its own '
means of egress. !

Stanford conflagrations are small i
affairs; in the event of a grass fire, |
the larger and more up-to-date !
pump and tank machines are called !
into action.
Joins Military Department
Contrary to what one might slip- ;
pose, "Number Thirteen" will not j
be placed beside the "Governor ]
Stanford" locomotive in the mu- j
seum, but is to be turned over to j
the military department, which |
maintains an auxiliary fire service '
working in conjunction with the J
Stanford Fire Department.
The new ladder truck is also a j
Ford chassis mounting two 28-foot !
ladders which extend to a 50-foot j
length. It is regarded as the equal I
of any other ladder truck with
comparable fire-protection respon- \
sibility.
Co-ordinate with the increased !
size of the fire-vehicle department, j
a new entrance to the firehouse is i
now in progress of construction. |
This will replace the old single exit j
with three gateways, thus allow
ing each truck and car its own '
means of egress. !
