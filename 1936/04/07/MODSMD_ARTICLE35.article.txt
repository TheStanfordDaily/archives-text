# Zeta Psi Reforms Win Tenement Fight Walls Corked Up
## 
### 
Be it ever so humble, the Zetes
call it homeâ€”and now the Zeta Psi
"barn" takes on new dimensions as
the old wing is balanced by a new
one, changing a box-like structure
to a U-shaped mansion.
Somewhat relieving the present
tenement conditions, the wing under
construction will contain new living
quarters while in another part
members can take workouts behind
a ping-pong table. This will be the
recreation room. Visitors will rest
comfortably in the guest room next
door.
Life-preserver cork will cut Zeta
Psi shrieks to mere bellows for the
benefit of the ambitious souls in
the new study room.
