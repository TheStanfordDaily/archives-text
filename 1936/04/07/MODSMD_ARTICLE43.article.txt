# Large Turnout Starts Practice For Uclan Meet
## Smith, Hardin, Alexander Voigt Out with Injuries; Luisetti, Myers Report 
### 
A nearly complete turnout greet
ed Coaches Templeton and Elling
ton yesterday as Stanford's varsity
tracksters started preparation for
Saturday's dual affair with U.C.L.A.,
to be held on Angell Field.
Missing was Humbert Smith, 6-5
hi>>h jumper, who, with his perenial
hard luck, has bruised a foot that
may keep him down a week or so,
while Wally Hardin, javelin tosser,
Tiger Alexander, 2-miler, and
Chuck Voigt, broad-jumper, were
taking it easy in favor of a wrenched
back, spiked toe, and weak ankle,
respectively.
New Faces
New faces were out there—Hank
Luisetti jumped 5-11 on his first day
at high jumping, and Giff Myers, re
leased from the ruggers, looks to Ix?
a coming 220 strider.
From the looks of things last week,
Templeton's men can take the
Bruins (if it doesn't rain), but the
sloppy track in Los Angeles Satur
day casts out hope of comparative
data.
Ilain Softens Field
Angell Field is a success — last
year's plant was a constant mire
from January to April—but the
Olympic Club meet last Saturday
was called off because hard or soft
track it is unhealthful and no fun
to run and jump in the cold and
storm.
Fro.sh tracksters are preparing for
Modesto J.C. on Angell Field Satur
day. Rudy Kelly, number 1 sprinter
and broadjumper, is still out with a
pulled muscle.
