## RAIN ON THE HOOF; SCHEDULES RENOVATED 
### 
As too much water went under the
bridges toward the end of last week,
the sports schedules were jiggled
around, and considerable cancelling
and calling games on account of
rain had to be effected.
But they've got most of that set
tled now, and the various senior
managers can go back to their cus
tomary routine.
There will be a baseball double
header here tomorrow, to make up
for the time lost sloshing around last
Saturday. It will be a very profit
able afternoon if you want to know
what the teams in the C.1.8.A. are
doing, with the least effort on your
part.
U.S.C., Santa Clara, and Stanford
will display their varsities in two
games. With conference standings
at stake the games should have gin
ger enough, and with the present
hot weather spell it is a very recom
mendable afternoon's disport. Plus
peanuts, ice cream, plenty of seats
for everybody, and lots of taunting
chatter from the stands.
The varsity and frosh track, and
swimming schedules are also patch
ed up a.s well as might be expected
The track sked, the Olympic Club
meet in particular, is still a subject
of discussion.
Of course there is no Saturday
available before the Big Meet with
Cal in which to place the Club meet.
There are two Saturdays open after
the Big Meet, however, the first two
in May, which could very reasonably
house a contest with the Club. The
Fresno Relays and the Coast Inter
collegiates follow in May, and it
might not be a bad idea to meet the

veteran Club before, for the expe
rience and workout.
