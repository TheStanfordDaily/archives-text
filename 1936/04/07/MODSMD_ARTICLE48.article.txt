El Trojan's fr.osh tennis team will
take the court against the Indian
first-year men at 1:45 this afternoon.
They come as a vanguard for their
big brothers, the Trojan varsity net
men who are to invade thfe Farm
nest Saturday.
Heading the Trobabe team is
Lawrence Nelson, who teamed with
Bob Underwood of the present
Stanford varsity, to take the run
ner-up position in last year's Na
tional Junior Doubles Tournament.
At present eight players of some
what similar capabilities are bat
tling for the coveted six places in
the starting line-up against the sons
of Troy. They will probably play in
the following older this afternoon
Sherwood Armstrong, Jack Ehrhart,
Jack Laney, Phil Griffith, Malcolm
Black, and Qutntin Birchard. Chuck
Fisher and Don Bohr are alternates
who may see service. These same
boys will pair for doubles play.
Coach Lockwood is a by averse to
making any optimistic statements to
the press after "missing" his guess
on the Indian-Bear tilts last week.
