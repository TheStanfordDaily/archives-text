# Trio Of Nines To Play Today
## Trojan Varsity Will Battle Indians, Santa Clara In Diamond Contests Here 
### 
Campus ball fans will be treated
to a double-header tomorrow after
noon. when U.S.C. will meet both
Stanford and Santa Clara nines on
the Sunken Diamond.
Postponment of the game between
the Cards and U.S.C., set for last
Saturday, caused a rearrangement
of conference games. Instead of the
contest with Santa Clara originally
â€¢ scheduled for tomorrow, the Indian
j nine will take on the Trojans, and
the Santa Clara game will be played
j at a later date.
The first game between the U.S.C.
I team and Santa Clara will start at
1:30 with the Card-Trojan tussle
following immediately.
Coach Harry Wolter of the In
i dians is undecided as to his starting
j pitcher in the nightcap but it is ex-
I ported that he will use Dick Arm
- strong, with Glenn Hamilton held in
reserve. Ray Weiershauser, who is
suffering from a slight cold, will
probably be saved for the big game
j coming up against California this
Saturday.

The storms known as hurricanes in
the West Indies and South Pacific
are known as typhoons off the east
coast of Asia, cyclones in the Indian
seas, and baguios in the Philippines.
