## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Paly Drives for Safety, Strikes Gold --—Which Will Remain Prime Objective? 
### 
As Palo Alto's eagle-eyes of the roadways
continue their admirable safety campaign
with ever-increasing vigilance, the scale of
prices for violations of a rigid pace-regulation
goes steadily up, and the commonwealth reaps
a nice harvest from unsuspecting passers
through.
Three cases grouped in a single day re
cently drew a minimum line of $60. That
was the fare for 00 miles on a 45-mile stretch
of the Bayshore. For 75 miles, straight speed
ing, a motorist forfeited $100, his driver's
license, and drew a six months' suspended jail
sentence.
Palo Alto asscrledly is carrying safely one
step farther: in speeding cases where the
motorcycle-man hasn't time to pace the of
fender and thus bring a formal charge, the
motorist is stopped, and booked without line,
until such time as lie commits another breach

—in such case the line is stepped up to cover
the original, unprovable misdemeanor.
It is not just coincidence that Palo Alto's
accidental-death rate has been held to a mini
mum during the past few years. Nor is it
happen-chance that Paly is the most feared
spot in the state by the speeding classes of
not only Stanford, but the rest of the penin
sula as well.
As long as Palo Alto keeps her safely cam
paign on the altruistic plane it now occupies,
the drive will be successful. If she should
go the way of many small towns, however,
and count on using cash lifted from passing
motorists as a considerable percentage of the
city's current operating budget, justice, safety,
and respect for Palv's campaign all would
SiiilTer, especially in view of the unusually
strict interpretation the city is putting on the
state traflic laws.
