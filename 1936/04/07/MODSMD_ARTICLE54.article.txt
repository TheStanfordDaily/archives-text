# It's Time for The Big Social Plunge

### 
How can we best "go social" as a house and
how can we do it gracefully?
That question was raised in many a Row
chapter hall last night as a result of Inter
fraternity Council's determined effort to bring
its members into a closer bond of friendship.
The end is admittedly desirable, the means
puzzling.
Will exchange dinners between fraternities
and sororities and between Row and Hall
groups serve their intended purpose? Will
visiting groups of sophomores lay a founda
tion for future relationships? And would in
ter-group singing meets or contests break the
ice of long-existing estrangement?
None of these ideas — even the singing
which has proven successful in many colleges
is to be sneered at. They are all worth a
try. The lirst, at least, with several exchange
dinners being planned, will get a try.
Some houses arc worried that a sudden div
ing into the so-called "social whirl" would
show their awkwardness. They forget, how
ever, that it" everyone dives at once, they will
all be in the swim at the same time.
The success of the move for better relation
ships is much dependent on this—on forget
ting how "graceful" an effort may be, and on
concentrating on making the effort success
ful.
