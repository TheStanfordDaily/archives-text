# â€” He Even Threw Out His "Red Line Extra"
## 
### 
So the great journalist, Willie Randolph
Hearst, has had another burglar under his
bed, and those two great clarions of truth that
he blankets the city with every day are not
allowed to mention the Stanford Red any
more on their sport pages.

Now, we are completely unable to get very
wrought up about Hearst, because his days
are certainly passed. He has yelled "wolf" for
so many years that his marginal utility has
sunk.
The propaganda in the Sinclair campaign
showed that Americans, through public edu
cation, have so advanced in civilization that
they now require subtler devices to be misled.
However, it is quite an interesting note to
see that his bugaboos have extended to the
primary color in all aspects. Maybe that's
the reason he gave the swimming pools and
the buildings to Cal. Maybe that explains why
he has so frequently put Stanford into the
list of radical schools and included the Farm
in the Red Network.
So we hope that Santa Claus in his pretty
suit gives him a red tulip for Christmas, and
that every time he sees a sunset he quivers all
over.
The Cardinal is waving, Mr. Hearst. What
do you think about our song that sings "Each
Loyal Comrade Brave and True"?
