(Editor's Note: Would you like to have a pro
fessor standing over you as you write out every
examination? Johnson Hill, in the following
article, offers a comparison of the Honor Code
and the Proctor System.)
Top-rank among the problems confronting aca
demic administrators in universities today is that of
placing examinations and other school work on an
honest level satisfactory to all concerned.
The assertion could be expanded, in fact, to in
clude every hall of learning, hfgh school and college,
and every instructor and student. For the issue is
one of comparatively fundamental principle, even
though the principle is applied in a foreign environ
ment.

Recently the problem received the immediate at
tention of a cross section of student thought at Stan
ford, when The Daily polled a straw vote of opinion
on the Honor Code. The questions and answers were
direct; the results were definite. An overwhelming
majority of the voters favored continuation of the
Honor System at the University.
Since the smoke has momentarily cleared away from
the Code conflagration, presentation without danger of
undue criticism can be made of facts and comparisons
on the subject made by a former Stanford student in a
Ph.D. dissertation.
The work was written by William Giles Campbell,
and may be found as a bound volume in the library.
It contains comparisons of the Honor Code and the
Proctor System based on experiments at the Univer
sity of Texas, where students in recent years have
worked under both standards.
Campbell reached the following conclusion at the
completion of a series of tests:
"The amount of classroom dishonesty ob
served, measured, or admitted was greater among
among similar subjects working under the honor
students working under the proctor system than
system. In situations where the conditions were
directly comparable, the difference in amount was
reliable."
In addition, the writer stated that "the honor sys
tem, even when it was not at its best, was superior to
the proctor system."
Campbell's experiments emphasized the conduct of
student subjects under the two codes, and were made
candidly, without injection of personal opinion. They
offer conclusive illustration of the value of both the
Honor Code and the Proctor System in actual practice.

With the results of The Daily's poll and Campbell's
experiments in view, even casual observation would
indicate continuation of the Code at Stanford a logical
assumption. Further expression of student sentiment
in panels this week will give officials adequate mate
rial upon which to base final decision on the eontro-
