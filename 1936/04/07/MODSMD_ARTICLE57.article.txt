Seeing as Hoo interfraternity relations are becom
ing Hooverized, it is fine to note that the interhouse
groups are planning Greek ties.
Now, I recorded last quarter a little scenario on the
resumption of Alpha Delt-Alpha Phi relations after
many years of hack-yard back-biting, but at the risk
of becoming tedious, I am relating the new interhouse
accord which is now being fit to be tied.
The volley ball craze that is sweeping the campus
like the American Building Maintenance Corp. first
started in that area of good Breeding known as The
Daily sports page. Then the Phi Delts and the Sigma
Chis took it up and the exercise became socially ac
ceptable.
The Alpha Phis sent longing looks at the clandestine
volley ball games between the Phi Delts and the local
sisterhood of Delta Gamma, so they installed a net
and ball and went to work.
Pretty soon the Alpha Delts came wandering over
onto the Alpha Phi greensward and engaged in the
sport of jump and jitter.
This was all very jolly.
So that night one of the Alpha Phi men in the
Alpha Delt house went over to the Alpha Phi menage
with a list of men who wanted dates that night. After
working out the cross-word puzzle, everybody got in
cars and adjourned to the City where they engaged
in the sport of jump and jitter in the Mural room.
This was all very jolly.
The next day there were more volley ball games.
This lead that night to an impromptu exchange dinner.
Some Alpha Phis visited the Alpha Delt dwelling and
vice-versa, then everyone trooped over to the Alpha
Phi house for tea and crumpets and there was bridge
till all hours of the night.
This was all very jolly.
Then 8 o'clock Saturday night various members in
both houses were sitting around with time on their
hands, until somebody suggested a co-educational
picnic.
So they all got into cars, went out to the picnic
ground back of the campus, built a eampfire, and
jumped and jittered. The whole affair was an over
whelming success. But strangely enough some of the
Alpha Phis began to lament for the good old days
when they could hate an Alpha Delt in the accepted
manner.
This was all too damn joLly, said they.
