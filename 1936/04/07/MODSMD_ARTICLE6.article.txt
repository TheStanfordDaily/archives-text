# Row Committee Reports Tonight
## Results of Inter – House Query To Be Weighed 
### 
Tonight the special committee that
Bob Hoover, president of the Inter
fraternity Council, appointed to in
vestigate the possibility of increased
fraternity relationships and to de
termine the attitude of the fraterni
ties to such a scheme, will make its
report to him.
During the week the committee,
composed of Louis Bansbach, Alex
BergeP, arid Louis Mendelssohn,
have made unofficial queries •of
house presidents and Row men to
determine their feelings toward such
a plan.
Two plans for exchange dinners
have been so considered: first sopho
mores only trade dinners among the
houses; second, the houses conduct
specific exchange dinners among
themselves.
In addition to the exchange din
ners which are being considered are
interfarternity "sings" whereby the
different houses conduct singing
contests. According to Hoover,
these contests are very popular
elsewhere in the country, and he be
lieves they might be accepted as a
source of fun and fellowship at
Stanford.
The plans which the committee
discusses tonight will be presented
to the Intefraternity Council at its
meeting next week.
