## FLAGGING DOWN THE GRAVY TRAIN 
### 
Gripes on governmental gravy are J
peculiar to those who stand in life's |
soup-lines watching the full-bellied j
eat life's filet mignons.
Almost universally, the grousers <

get their ethical
indigestion from
a n unappeased
hunger—or, more
correctly, a hun
ger they're gen
erally too lazy or
inept to appease.
It's a deficiency
disease common
to the hoi polloij
of all govern-!
ments where
money is collect-

Ed in large
amounts, and necessarily is dis
pensed to the mighty, in large
amounts.

Here at Stanford, where Quads
cost $5.65 and student body mem
bership $15, where basketball games
cost 75 cents and elementary French
costs $8, there's not only resentment,
but accusation of filthiness because
the Chappie manager this year
stands to collect something like
$2000, because Mr. Gros collects $80
per month, because the editor of the
Quad will make $50 ir each similar
period plus 30 per cent on all profits
up to $1700, because the Daily edi
tor will collect a similar monthly
stipend plus 10 per cent on profits
up to $1000.

Because they are professional
grousers, perhaps because they are
concealing their inability to do the
high-paid college job by hog-callinp,
the side-line boys will not face the
fact that all along the college line
jobs are not only paid, but paid
well. Those who are working to get
to the top are not starving to death,
nor are they complaining that the
money doesn't trickle down to their
stratum.

OfThand, we think of the 10 per
cent that each Chappie ad solicitor
gets for each ad obtained, the as
sistant office manager of the Daily
business office who nets $15 per
month, the B.A.C. student police,
who get 50 cents an hour, the treas
urers of dormitory clubs who re
ceive $10 or $15 per quarter, the
drama electrician who receives a
$10 check for each production.

There is not only honor, but mon
ey too in just being a brakeman on
the Stanford gravy train. Besides
the prospect of someday moving
into the engineer's cab, besides the
privilege of getting free rides, there
is good hard cash for the working.

But like any train on the better
railroads, there is no place for the
hoboes, who scream at the hired
help even though they are not
thrown off with the help of a size
11 logger's boot.
With all due respect to him,
Chappie's Dick Creamer will prob
ably earn more this year than he
will in any one of 10 years after he
leaves college. But the enormity of
his amount isn't important. What is
important is that Dick Creamer
earns that money. Today Dick,
among others, is in the engineer's
cab, but Dick was once a brakeman
when his contemporary financial
sabotagers were hobos.
The hobos are still howling. Dick
has the dough.
