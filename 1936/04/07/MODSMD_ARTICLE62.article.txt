# 'Country Club' Colleges Flayed By Dr. Hutchins
## 
### 
Universities of today have only
themselves to blame if the general
public confuses them with country
clubs and reformatories, according
to President Robert M. Hutchins of
the University of Chicago in his first 1
book, "No Friendly Voice," just off 1
the press.
The university of today has the
problem of clarifying its position in \
the public mind by its emphasis on |
the intellectual reports out. Since
the old emotional methods of re- 1
ligious appeal have lost their ;
strength, the approach to God today i
must be intellectual, says Dr. I
Hutchins.
Sixty per cent of the "useless j
facts" crammed by the student have :
to be repeated every quarter to pass J
countless tests.
Because the student's intellectual
interest is stifled by the hopeless j
prospect of acquiring all the in- |
formation he is told he must pos- |
sess, he treads his weary way I
around picking up a fragment here |
and a fragment there, until he has
been examined on fragment after 1
fragment and served his time.
Western greater universities must !
discard their "inferiority complexes" |
and teach the student to think, I
writes Dr. Hutchins.
Eastern schools are advised to
"junk" the first two years of col- |
lege. He recommends that the east- |
ern preparatory schools become col- j
leges and that the students be se- j
lected more carefully.
