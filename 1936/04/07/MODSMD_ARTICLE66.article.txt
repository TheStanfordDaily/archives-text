# SPARE THE ROD

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In Monday's editorial on the
Honor Code you are guilty of an
j oversimplification. The Honor Code
i has meant something to Stanford,
| because in our own smug little way,
we Farm students have considered it
i a tradition and a vital part of the
Stanford milieu.
To say that the Honor Code is |
nothing more than an administra
tive device for the protection of the
' class average is a direct slap in the
face of the generations of Stanford
: men who fought to uphold tradition
j and who were not so glib in sneer
| ing at anyone who could be honest
l or sincere.
i If we quit mollycoddling our de
generates, and really expelled the
I violators, those who had respect for
I what Stanford has stood these many
I years could be free to restore some
J of the shattered mores and folk
ways that have been broken down
since the depression years and the
influx of the new women and jaysee
transfers.
Sincerely,
Code Control
