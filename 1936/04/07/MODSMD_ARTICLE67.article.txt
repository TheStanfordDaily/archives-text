# MORE ON CONDUCT...

The Editor, Sir:
Last quarter, about a week before
finals, some needy student borrowed
my notebook without my knowledge
from the library. Foi'tunately, I
pulled through my exams. I hope
that student did too. Now I ask you
â€”is that the proper way to earn a
grade?
It flatters me to think that my
notes should be considered by any
one to be of sufficient value to war
rant this slight breach of the honor
system. Please note that I do not
criticise the system, for such things
happen in any institution.
Now, however, that our mutual
courses are over, I would appre

ciate the return of the other notes
upon which three quarters of inde
pendent study depend and which, I
am very sure, no other person could
possibly have any use for.
I have always supposed the library
was a safe place to leave a note
book, at least for a few minutes. I
should he pleasantly surprised to
find it where I left it one of these
fine days.
Very truly yours,
Ed Gilmore
