# Hoffman Probe Move Defeated
## G. O. P. Claims 'Jersey Justice Travesty' 
### 
TRENTON", N.J., April 6 (/P).—
The New Jersey Assembly tonight
defeated 23 to 31 a resolution pro
viding for appointment of a citizens'
committee to investigate the activ
ities of Governor Harold G. Hoffman
in his reopened investigation of the
Bruno Hauptmann case. The reso
lution lacked eight votes of ap
proval.
The resolution, introduced by As
semblyman Charles R. Geddes, anti-
Hoffman Republican from Union,
was' opposed by the governor's sup
porters because it would have con
fined the investigation to the period
following affirmation of Haupt
mann's conviction by the court of
errors and appeals.
Opposition to the governor's can
didacy for delegate -at -1 arge to the
Republican National Convention,
first voiced Saturday by former
Representative Franklin W. Fort,
came today from two candidates for
district delegates in Union County.
The candidates, Col. Edward B.
Twombly of Summit and C. Benson
Wigton of Plainfiold, said the gov
ernor had made a "travesty of Jer
sey justice" and should be "re
pudiated by the Republican Party."
They announced they would fight a
reported move to have him nom
inated for the vice-presidency.
