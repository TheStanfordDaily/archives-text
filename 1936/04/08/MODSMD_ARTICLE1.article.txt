### George Veness 
Interfraternity Council's special
committee on fraternity relations
last night presented a plan for
sophomore exchange dinners in its
report to officials of the Council and
of its subsidiary board.
Dinners Favored
After several days of investiga
tion among the houses, the commit
tee, composed of Louis Bansbach,
Alex Berger, and Louis Mendel
ssohn, reported its findings to Bob
Hoover, president of the Interfra
ternity Council.
ssohn, reported its findings to Hoo-
The six men then formulated a
plan which will be presented to the
Interfraternity Council at their
meeting a week from tonight.
The plan as it is suggested by the
investigating group at present in
volves only sophomore exchange
dinners.
The two chief points in the plan
are: first, half of the sophomores in
one house will exchange with half
the sophomores in another house,
thereby evenly dividing the two
groups; second, each week the com
mittee will decide which houses are
to exchange dinners and present
their schedule to the Council for its
approval.
At the Council meetings the
house presidents can arrange the de
tails of the dinners and carry the
edict of the Council back to their
sophomores.
Unity Sought
In having the house presidents
back of the movement, it is be
lieved that a more generally uni
fied program will result. Exchange
dinners chiefly among the sopho
mores are believed to be the most
practical to start with because they
are more closely related than are
the present upperclassmen, and as
time passes the future sophomores
will complete the cycle of class
dinners.
