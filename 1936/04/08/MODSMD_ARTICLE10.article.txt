# Miller Analyzes Art Paradox
## Lecturer Decries Modern Defiant Attitude 
### 
The paradox of primitivism in a
sophisticated age was one of the
modern art tendencies discussed by
Alec Miller, English wood sculptor,
in the Assembly Hall last night.
Illustrating his lecture with repre
sentative works, Miller decried the
modern attitude of complete defi
ance to the past, its preoccupation
with the paleolithic man. Contrast
ing the "Night" of Michelangelo to
that of Jacob Epstein, Miller de
scribed the latter grim work as a
"shriek in stone."
Rodin Worked in Clay
Mr. Miller points out as dangerous
the practice of sculptors who con
ceive of their work in clay, delegat
ing the final marble or bronze chis
eling to their assistants. Rodin, rele
gated to limbo by modern critics,
worked entirely in clay, Mr. Miller
said, his assistants carrying out the
final forms. As a result in im
mobile bronze or marble such works
as "The Thinker" or "Victor Hugo"
have a plasticity unfitted to their
medium, a certain "chewed" quality.
Modern sculpture is largely, Mr.
Miller points out, a reaction to the
plasticity, the emotionalism of
Rodin, "the artistic Zola."

Besides works by Epstein, signifi
cant pieces of Eric Gil, Dobson, and
Archipenko were discussed, their
similarities with negro, Egyptian
and archaic sculptures pointed out.
Several of the artist's own wood
carvings, one a head of his daugh
ter executed in two woods, were ex
hibited.
Mr. Miller defines sculpture as "a
process of giving form to the percep
tions of the spirit by the wisdom of
the hands." The significance of
modern sculpture, he emphasizes,
lies not in its distortions, but in its
import of the eternal and the uni
versal.
