# Coghlan To Caper With Fowls In Soph Carnival
## 
### Margaret Loud 
Imagine Phil Coghlan, head of
Rally Committee, turning soft
hearted and playing nursemaid to a
duck! Occasion? The last Sopho
more Carnival.
It all happened in the "Win a
Duck" booth, which is being spon
sored again this year by El Cuadro
Club. The object of the concession
was to throw rings over the necks
of some? ducks swimming around in
water. Several days before the car
nival, Coghlan engaged the neces
sary ducks from a farm down the
highway, but since they were bor
rowed, he had to take special care
of them. »
He kept the pets in Toyon, but
■ pretty soon one of the little quack -
[ ers proceeded to catch cold from the

I dormitory drafts. To restore it to
health Coghlan put it in the shower
room, turned on all the hot water
and gave the duck a steam bath.
I Finally, Coghlan gave the patient
his own bed. with all blankets and
pillows. Results: speedy recovery—
for the duck.
Another incident occurred the
night of the Carnival in the Thela
Xi "Duck the Sucker" booth, which
is also being repeated.
Ihota Xi pledges were placed on
seats over icy water and for a dime
a throw their friends tried to hit the
latch that would make them fall.
A careless brother forgot to tighten
the latch up with the result that the
least touch would knock the pledges
■ off. This booth closed early.
