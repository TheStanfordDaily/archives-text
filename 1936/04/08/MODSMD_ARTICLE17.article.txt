# Tracksters Get Ready For U.C.L.A. Clash
## Dual Meet Saturday; Kellogg May Be Out For Season Due To Injury 
### Phil Klauber 
With all hands planning on a repe
tition of last year's 82-49 win over
the Bruins, it was full distance again
in yesterday's practice as Dink
Templeton, nattier than ever, sent
his tracksters through preparatory
workouts for the U.C.L.A. dual meet
on Angell Field Saturday.
Injuries Hinder
The injuries' balance sheet just
about broke even, as Humbert Smith
returned to serious high jump work
to offset the loss of Sam Kellogg,
number 1 javelin man, who has a
strained elbow which may hinder
his throwing for the rest of the sea
son. Wally Hardin, number 2 spear
man, may recover from his back in
jury in time to place Saturday.
Relay stock climbed yesterday as
quarter miling conditions seemed to
be good. Cranston, Weiershauser,
Malott, and Dellinger ran 49.8, 49.9,
50.4 and 51.4, respectively, while Cy
Oberg, usually a low hurdler, took
a 51.5 Monday. Dellinger is return
ing to form at the rate of 1 second
per day, which should put him down
there in just three days.
Record Cut
Bill McCurdy stole the plaudits
of the crowd by cutting his personal
half mile record to 1:57.7. Whether
Murphy, the stellar Bruin, will be
up here to get in Mac's hair Satur
day is not known, as the former has
been under the weather.
Jim Kneubuhl, the sprinter whom
Templeton has been praising for
some months, is getting down close
to Ray Dean, the man who already
begins to look as good as any on the
coast. The lads scampered through
a couple of 10.1's, telling stories on
the way. Klopstock also ran a 10.1
yesterday.
Bruins Look Good
The Bruins look pretty good in
four events—they should win easily
the 880, broad jump, javelin, and
pole vault, while the rest of their
49 points, it appears, must come
from place and show money.

The Bruins look pretty good in
four events—they should win easily
the 880, broad jump, javelin, and
pole vault, while the rest of their
49 points, it appears, must come
from place and show money.
With all hands planning on a repe
tition of last year's 82-49 win over
the Bruins, it was full distance again
in yesterday's practice as Dink
Templeton, nattier than ever, sent
his tracksters through preparatory
workouts for the U.C.L.A. dual meet
on Angell Field Saturday.
Injuries Hinder
The injuries' balance sheet just
about broke even, as Humbert Smith
returned to serious high jump work
to offset the loss of Sam Kellogg,
number 1 javelin man, who has a
strained elbow which may hinder
his throwing for the rest of the sea
son. Wally Hardin, number 2 spear
man, may recover from his back in
jury in time to place Saturday.
Relay stock climbed yesterday as
quarter miling conditions seemed to
be good. Cranston, Weiershauser,
Malott, and Dellinger ran 49.8, 49.9,
50.4 and 51.4, respectively, while Cy
Oberg, usually a low hurdler, took
a 51.5 Monday. Dellinger is return
ing to form at the rate of 1 second
per day, which should put him down
there in just three days.
Record Cut
Bill McCurdy stole the plaudits
of the crowd by cutting his personal
half mile record to 1:57.7. Whether
Murphy, the stellar Bruin, will be
up here to get in Mac's hair Satur
day is not known, as the former has
been under the weather.
Jim Kneubuhl, the sprinter whom
Templeton has been praising for
some months, is getting down close
to Ray Dean, the man who already
begins to look as good as any on the
coast. The lads scampered through
a couple of 10.1's, telling stories on
the way. Klopstock also ran a 10.1
yesterday.
