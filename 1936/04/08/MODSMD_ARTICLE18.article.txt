# Fang Talks For Strong League
## Chinese General Pleads For War Eradication 
### 
A plea for a strong League of Na
tions "with teeth in it" was voiced
yesterday by General Fang Chen
Wu of the Chinese Army, who spoke
in the Little Theater.
The biggest problem the world
faces today, said General Fang, is
the limitation of armaments and the
avoidance of war. Two things must
be done to eradicate war, he de
clared. One is the revision of exist
ing treaties which impose inequali
ties on various nations, and the
other is control of armament manu
facturers.
Elimination of national armies and
navies and substitution of one in
ternational league armed force,
with League control of all munitions
manufacturers, is the solution, ac
cording to General Fang. Short of
that, only a strike by munitions
workers could bring peace.
Applying his thesis to China, Gen
eral Fang pointed out that almost
90 per cent of China's resources are
now spent on armaments, and this
tremendous drain from productive
enterprise is what is holding his na
tion back. If the need for and supply
of armaments could be eliminated,
all this could be spent on production.
General Fang spoke in Chinese,
interspersed with what little Eng
lish he could muster. An inter
preter translated the body of the
speech.
