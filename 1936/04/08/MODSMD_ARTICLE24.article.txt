Delta Gammas weren't eating
yesterday. Neither were El Toros.
For Thursday about 6:30 these
two representatives of How and Hall
will sit down at one big labie to
getherâ€”the first Row-Hall social
encounter since the two factions be
gan warring over elections and
things in the '90's.
"I'm glad that we can be the first
to develop this new friendliness be
tween the houses and eating clubs,"
Roy Anderson, El Toro president,
declared last night.
"So am I," said Frances Strong,
Delta Gamma president.
Considering it a big move toward
happier all-campus relations, Bob
Hoover, Interfraternity Council
president, looked for many spring
quarter exchange dinners between
fraternities, eating clubs, and Row
houses.
