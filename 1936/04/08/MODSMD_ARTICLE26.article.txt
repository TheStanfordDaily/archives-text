## 2 Temporary Vacancies To Be Filled by Appointment Next Week 
### Annalee Whitmore 
The Veterans of Future Wars,
Stanford chapter, last night hit its
first snag.
After enthusiastic but disorderly
recognition by Ex Committee, it was
finally decided to lay the measure
on the table. The motion was alter
ed to read "under the table," in spite
of cries of supporters, but formal
approval of the organization and its
rapidly increasing auxiliaries is be
ing urged by ardent members.
Membership Discussed
Some discussion was held as to
whether or not members shooting
off their arms now should be paid
double, or whether or not feeble
minded and crippled should be ad
mitted.
Final decision was that member
ship, according to the latest revision,
will be limited to those either "able
or unable."
Minor Business Listed
Other Ex Committee business in
cluded approval of Dramatic Coun
cil minutes. Rams' Head representa
tive will be replaced this quarter by
a Barnstormer delegate. The Coun
cil also plans to hold a song-writing
contest in connection with "June
Moon," to provide music for the
play and find new talent on the
campus.
PUBLICATIONS COUNCIL min
utes, recommending a by-law
change to do away with the Ham
mer and Coffin building fund, were
passed. "Merely eliminates red
tape," explained Dick Creamer.
RESIGNATION of Bobby Gray
son was refused. A second vacancy,
left by Jackie Brown's temporary
absence from school, necessitated
either an expensive special election
or passing of a by-law.
"We can refuse to accept Gray
son's resignation. Then he'll be ab
sent temporarily, and we can name
a substitute for him under this new
by-law, and no election will be
necessary. It costs too much," said
President Brooke.
The constitutional amendment,
providing that appointments could
be made to fill the positions of mem
bers temporarily absent was passed.
"It's unconstitutional," came the fa
miliar voice of Frank Fullenwider,
in an unofficial capacity as visitor.
AN ASSEMBLY featuring the
music of Griff Wiliiams, who of
fered to play for an hour free of
charge, was approved.
"Public Exercises Committee says
we can't call it an assembly, though
—it isn't educational," said Brooke.
The "audition" will be held be
tween 5 and 6 o'clock, probably next
Wednesday.
"SPEAKERS' BUREAU has pro
gressed," reported Chairman Chuck
Schaffer. "We've spent $11.45 so
far." Additional funds for trans
portation, office expenses, and sal
ary were granted.
CONVALESCENT HOME drive

man Gib Holloway. Innovations

night at a Palo Alto theater, and a
golf tournament.
