IE YOU WANT something to
read, get a-hold of this week's I
TIME and pour over the article on i
Daniel Webster Hoan, Milwaukee's i
Socialist Mayor. If you want to get j
the political situation in California j
cleared up, read Coastal Confusion
under Political Notes.
TIME shows how the Warren
Free Delegation of the Republican
party is a lloover instrument,
how the Landon delegation is a
Mcrriam-supported Hearst instru
ment. On reading San Francisco
(tapers, you can not learn what the ,
political scramble in California is
all about.
Prejudice, thou art everywhere! |
lint you are minimized in TIME, j
just about the last remaining news )

grind, no motive for coloring news, j
STANFORD WILL once again
have the privilege of hearing the
redoubtable Norman Thomas. Mark
April 21 down in your date book ,
and go to hear an intelligent man '
take your breath away with what
he says. Thomas spoke here two
years ago and impressed listeners
with 11is sincerity and his truths.
Speaking of prejudice, this man is
like TIME. He's one of the few left
who can see daylight, and can
preach it.
WONDER WHAT ever happened
to Wally Brooke's intramural house.
Maybe it has been built.
The Commonwealth Club debate |
Friday afternoon was pretty feeble \
from what Stanford's participants
t-ay. The girls from California had
canned speeches, canned rebuttals.
Mid on one occasion the ladies had
to be prompted. The coach made
part of one speech by prompting the
{..ill, then she would repeat the cue
to the audience; and then wait for
the next verbal nudge, and so it
went for an embarrassingly long
time.
SANDERSON SMITH, son of the
late Everett Wallace Smith, beloved
journalism professor, has just writ- ;
ten a book on "How to Swim" and
it should be off the presses and on
public sale within a month. "Sandy" !
has written two articles for ES
QUIRE on swimming and diving
and is an aquatic sports enthusiast.
Member of the Stanford swimming i
and water polo squads in years past,
Smith is no aquatic great, but he
has the interest and the brains to
popularize the sport.
He designed a swimming score
board which was used Monday at
the Fullerton-Frosh meet. The ar
rangement is for the benefit of the
swimmers and the public as well. 1
The time of each lap is marked up
and the swimmer can squint up at it
from (he water as he races by and
tell just how well he is doing.
Smith's idea is to make swimming
e.'isy to understand to "someone
who doesn't know a thing
about it."
