The Editor, Sir:
F"om the time I arrived at Stan
ford in September until now I have
had "Honor Code" pounded into me.
I never heard the word honor men
tioned at the college from which 1
transferred and yet when I analyze
it I find that honor there was high.
Certainly the students there were
not a more select, honorable group
than Stanford students. They had
no pledges, no laws, and no proc
tors. *
It was taken for granted that a
person came to college with as much
of a sense of honor as with entrance
requirements. If a student failed to
measure up he learned either by the
examine of those about him or bv

ostracization. However, in two
years 1 never sa - v a person cheat.
Stanford has created a paradox by
trying to codify honor into it law
i system. The articles of the Honor
I Code are more of a bugbear than a
proctor pacing the aisles. How can
I we suddenly learn to tattle on our
fellow students when we have been
taught all our that it is only
honorable to mind our own busi
ness in such cases?
Why can't we calm down about
the whole honor system? Each pro
fessor could do whatever he chose
and the result would be that those
who trusted their classes would re
ceive their honor and respect while
those who proctored would be as
! sured of the honesty of the exams.
It might also be arranged accord
ing to types of courses—uniformity
is not necessary. In some very
I large courses a proctor might be a
wise move, but in small classes or on
essay or personal opinion questions
j a.proctor would be useless.
