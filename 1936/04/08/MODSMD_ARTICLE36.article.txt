Hobbs Adams is coach of fresh
man football at the University of
Southern California. One can easily
see that the southern institution has
a nugget in Hobbs, for a number of
reasons.
Firstly, Hobbs knows his football
through and through — strategy is
right up his alley, and ten years out
of college he is still nearly as hard
to tackle as many of the best backs
in the game today.
But more than this, Hobbs is a
very smooth chap to talk to. He can
give a dissertation first about the line
points of the game, choice of plays,
what to do on third down on the
24-yard line, second, about the pos
sibilities of a degree in education,
the coaching field as a vacation,
and even then a little about the joys
of college life.
All of this stuff comes out smooth
ly, pleasantly, between smiles, and
no one can help liking the guy.
And Hobbs is in top form this
year, because, out of the 11 men that
were selected last fall as an all-
Southern Cal prep football team,
and between you and the gate post a
splendid lot of players, Adams will
have exactly 13 on his frosh squad
next season.
You guessed it—two are from the
second all-star team.
