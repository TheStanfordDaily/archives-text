# NEWSOM GOES TO TOWN
## 
### 
There are lots of little quips about
Coach Wolter's vacation baseball
expedition. This one is about the
second game of the Marines series
in San Diego.
Bill Lane, new 76-year-old owner
of the Coast League San Diego
Padres, and his veteran right hand
Jack Thompson, were watching the
fray, and between reminiscences on
Frank Chance and the great Napo
leon Lajoie, were singing some
praises of the work that the Stan
ford third baseman was doing at the
lime.
Yessir, Newsoni was really doing
himself proud with some pretty
stabs down at the hot corner, and
his hitting eye was there.
Then young Tom Killefer, of the
Indianapolis and Sacramento Kille
fers, came over to greet Owner
Lane, as he evidently knew him

from way back.
Next young Killefer returned to
the Cardinal dugout with the tid
ings that a Coast League owner was
in the stands.
That was bad, because Newsom
immediate'y blew sky high, got
caught off base twice and made two
splendid errors.
But the story ends happily, be
cause Newsom still had Lane's
plaudits after the game, and Stan
ford won, 11-8. â€”Klauber
