# Double-Header To Be Played At Sunken Diamond
## Stanford, U. S. C., Santa Clara Meet This Afternoon in Baseball Games 
### 
A double-header with three i
teams, Stanford, U.S.C., and Santa
Clara, participating, is on tap for
. campus baseball fans at the sunk- ,
, en diamond this afternoon.
The first game, starting at 1:30, j
will feature the Trojans against :
1 Santa Clara, and the Cards will meet
j U.S.C. in the second contest.
Rain, which forced postponement
! of the Card-Trojan contest slated for
last Saturday made rearrangement
of the schedule necessary. The
! game between the Cards and the
' Broncs which was to have been
! played today has' been put off in- j
definitely.
Indian Coach Harry Wolters said j
he expects to start Dick Armstrong
on the mound, with Glenn Hamil- I
ton ready to relieve him if neces- J
sary. Leo Heagerty will catch.
The infield will remain the same ;
as usual with Darrel Holman at j
first, Frank Tremaine on second,
George Farrel at short, and Bill
Newsom on third. If U.S.C. should
start a left-hander in the box, Wol
ter intends to use Ed Clark and Bob
Matthews in the outfield along with
Captain Bones Hamilton. Otherwise
Tom Killifer and Verne Johnson
will start.
