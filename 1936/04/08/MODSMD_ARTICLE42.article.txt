After months of tine-easing ef
forts the statisticians have released
some Rose Bow! tabulations that
seem to explain even better than
the Phi Delt wagers the Stanford
victory last New Year's Day. It
was those white jerseys. Re

In 1925 Stanford lost to Notre
Dame 27-10. Four horsemen?
Yes, but Warner's Cards were
dressed in red. 1927 — a 7-7 tie
with Alabama — white shirts. 1928
— Stanford defeated Pitt, 7-6 —
white shirts. And then two more
games in the red. 7-0 from Colum
bia in the slush in '33, and 29-13
from Alabama in '34.
Came again the white age this
year; you were all there to sec
them take S.M.U., 7-0. Tiny, it
doesn't seem to fail. For a sure tie
or win at Pasadena in the future,
drag out the white uppers.
