## Thornton Rates Vibert As Mainstay of Team; Jim Wearson Bear Threat 
### 
Nineteen consecutive Big Meet
wins—that's the record Stanford
.swimmers will try to increase Satur
day morning when tankmen lroin
California come down to churn up
Encina pools against the Indians.
With team ratings over Cal in two
Pacific Association and the North
ern California team championship
meets already this year, Stanford
would seem to be heavy favorites to
stretch their string to 20.
Coach Nort Thornton's counting
on Jack Vibert to do most, of the
point-picking for the Indians. Be
| .sides Vibert, there's Bob Walker,
' P.A. champion in the 150-yard hack
stroke; Captain Tom Boothe, diver;
and Bill Lhamon, splinter; they're
the big guns of the Cardinals.
Greatest among the Bears is Jim
Werson, the fastest 200-yard breast
; stroke man the Coast has ever had.
Werson, Captain Welden Smith, who
swims the 220 and the relay, and Jim
Shields, sprinter, are the main
■ threats of the Berkeley men.
