## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" How Can the Code Best Be Administered? Tonight's Panel Faces This Problem 
### 
Of 450 Cnl students suspected of cheating
in a recent mid-term examination, 10 cheat
ers, including 3 football players and 5 women,
this week were "reprimanded" by university
ollicials.
The proctor system is plainly passing
through its stresses and strains, partly he
cause the proctor idea contains this anomaly:
it attempts to appeal to the student's moral
sense at the same time that it sets up a spy
system that cannot work.
Ethics are a tetchy subject and properly
should he left to Ihe sociologist and other
persons who don't know much about "prac
tical affairs."
But at Stanford, the plumed knights ride
again, and declare: Chivalry is not (lead.
However, the champions of honor and glory
in Vox Campi yesterday and this morning are
confusing the present Honor Code conllict by
trying to attach moral issues to it.
For ethical concepts, Stanford has its basic
tradition the Fundamental Standard; for an
administrative device it has the Code.

Morals have only this bearing on the sub
ject: that the concept of honor and honesty
of any group rests on the general acceptance
of the whole. It is true, as this morning's Vox
Campi points out, that students have fre
quently been taught to consider it ignoble to
"snitch" 011 one another.
This is a natural reaction of the herd as a
protection against arbitrary authority. When
the authority, however, is the herd itself, then
the emphasis changes to a self-protection of
another sort.
If it is a sin to cheat it is a sin against the
class average, and not against Cod or Man.
It is thus a means of taking an unfair advan
tage on other members of the class.
The panel tonight should consider these
"points: how to make the Code more effective
as ;in administrative device, how to make
students more willing to report violations;
how to make violations easier to detect; and
how to persuade the faculty to give courses
and exes that make the students think, rather
than "parrot" facts.
