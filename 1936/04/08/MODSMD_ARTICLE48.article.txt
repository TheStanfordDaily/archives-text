# $3 Prom Bids Would Be Penny Wise, Pound Foolish
## 
### 
Again the annual twin problems of prices |
and orchestras has confronted the Junior }
Pnjm Committee and upper classmen are he- |
ing questioned in an attempt to please the
majority.
Frank Taylor, the prom chairman, has
announced that il a local orchestra is hired
bids will be sold for and that if an outside
band is brought in, the tax will be $3.75. The j
question: is a famous name with perhaps a |
smoother swing worth six bits?
From the committee's standpoint, which .
naturally is a financial one, an affirmative
answer to this question is the only logical
one. Experience proves that the novelty of a
big name at no more than $3.75 is a virtual
cinch to till the floor.
To the students, 75 cents one way or the
other is not a tremendous consideration when
the levels to which the prices of most campus
dances soar is considered. And when the best
can be obtained for such a little more, it's not
an offer to be turned down.
As a matter of fact, the junior committee
is much more fortunate than are the sponsors
of the Senior Ball, who are circulating ques
tionnaires on an $8.50 or $10 Ball, depending
on whether a local or outside band is em
ployed. The extra $1 .50 is not such a paltry

sum when high finance like $1(1 and $8.50
is involved, as 75 cents added to a totally
reasonable $3 hid would be.
That a $3.75 Junior Prom with a nation
ally known orchestra would have appeal
seems obvious; on the other hand, whether
a Senior Ball would have $10 worth of appeal
is questionable.
