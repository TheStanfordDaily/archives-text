# Knox-Journalism's Gift to Politics

### Peter Allen 
(Editor's Note: Publisher of the paper that has
rapped most consistently and most constructively
at the New Deal, Col. Frank Knox, Chicago Daily
News mogul, has thrown his hat into the Repub
lican presidential ring. His chances for the nom
ination arc discussed in a two-article scries by
Peter Allen.)
Colonel Frank Knox, big, sandy-haired, ruddy
faced publisher of the Chicago Daily News, is today's
political riddle. Six or eight months ago he was un
known outside of New Hampshire and Illinois. He
has never held public office. And yet today he is
keeping company with Landon, Borah, and Hoover as a
contender for the Republican nomination.
How did it happen? Well, as a matter of fact,
Knox made his dramatic appearance on the election
horizon by pure chance. In the autumn of 1934 a bunch
of loyal Chicago Republicans decided to have a dinner
and start replenishing the campaign coffers. At the
last minute their speaker was called away and Colonel
Knox agreed to substitute. Before the evening was
over $75,000 had been pledged. So when Detroit, Cin
cinnati, and Cleveland held their money-gathering
banquets, expert haranguer Knox was called in.
♦ * * *
Then he began speaking at G.O.P. rallies all over
the Middle West and after each meeting enthusiastic
listeners rushed up to shake his hand and urge him
to seek the nomination. His transition into a full
fledged candidate was the obvious result. By last
September Knox himself took his chances seriously and
began to travel over the nation, speaking, making
friends and girding himself for the convention which
will be held in June.
His swift ruse in national politics is typical of Knox.
He's led a life of action. When he came to Chicago
in 1931 as a prospective buyer of the Daily News,
Knox had been a Rough Rider, a political aide of
Teddy Roosevelt, an Artillery Major overseas, and a
crusading editor who had defended his policies with
fists and played target for the bullets of an enraged
citizen.
♦ * * *
He began his publishing career in Sault Ste Marie
in 1902. He was spotted by Hearst talent scouts in
1927, and when he quit four years later because his
business judgments differed from the chiefs, he was
general manager of the whole Hearst chain.
Since l! c time he became publisher of the Daily
News he has beco» ie a prominent Chicagoan in a
publishing way. But whenever his associates talk of
him as a presidential nominee, they usually remark:
"He's a Grade A business man but what does he
know about politics?"

They forget, or never knew, that in 1910 he en
gineered a complete Progressive Republican ticket
into the state Capitol of Michigan. They forget that
he was key man in the Midwest campaigns of Teddy
Roosevelt in 1912 and 1916 and for Leonard Wood in
1920. They forget that four years later Knox ran for
governor of New Hampshire and lost a close race
apparently because he refused to spend more on his
campaign than the law allowed.
Since then his political talent has lain idle while
he concentrated on the publishing game. But now
Knox has returned to the ring and in tomorrow's
article the probable success of his comeback will be

campaign than the law allowed.

he concentrated on the publishing game. But now

(Editor's Note: Publisher of the paper that has
rapped most consistently and most constructively
at the New Deal, Col. Frank Knox, Chicago Daily
News mogul, has thrown his hat into the Repub
lican presidential ring. His chances for the nom
ination arc discussed in a two-article scries by
Peter Allen.)
Colonel Frank Knox, big, sandy-haired, ruddy
faced publisher of the Chicago Daily News, is today's
political riddle. Six or eight months ago he was un
known outside of New Hampshire and Illinois. He
has never held public office. And yet today he is
keeping company with Landon, Borah, and Hoover as a
contender for the Republican nomination.
How did it happen? Well, as a matter of fact,
Knox made his dramatic appearance on the election
horizon by pure chance. In the autumn of 1934 a bunch
of loyal Chicago Republicans decided to have a dinner
and start replenishing the campaign coffers. At the
last minute their speaker was called away and Colonel
Knox agreed to substitute. Before the evening was
over $75,000 had been pledged. So when Detroit, Cin
cinnati, and Cleveland held their money-gathering
banquets, expert haranguer Knox was called in.
♦ * * *
Then he began speaking at G.O.P. rallies all over
the Middle West and after each meeting enthusiastic
listeners rushed up to shake his hand and urge him
to seek the nomination. His transition into a full
fledged candidate was the obvious result. By last
September Knox himself took his chances seriously and
began to travel over the nation, speaking, making
friends and girding himself for the convention which
will be held in June.
His swift ruse in national politics is typical of Knox.
He's led a life of action. When he came to Chicago
in 1931 as a prospective buyer of the Daily News,
Knox had been a Rough Rider, a political aide of
Teddy Roosevelt, an Artillery Major overseas, and a
crusading editor who had defended his policies with
fists and played target for the bullets of an enraged
citizen.
♦ * * *
He began his publishing career in Sault Ste Marie
in 1902. He was spotted by Hearst talent scouts in
1927, and when he quit four years later because his
business judgments differed from the chiefs, he was
general manager of the whole Hearst chain.
Since l! c time he became publisher of the Daily
News he has beco» ie a prominent Chicagoan in a
publishing way. But whenever his associates talk of
him as a presidential nominee, they usually remark:
"He's a Grade A business man but what does he
know about politics?"
• * * *
They forget, or never knew, that in 1910 he en
gineered a complete Progressive Republican ticket
into the state Capitol of Michigan. They forget that
he was key man in the Midwest campaigns of Teddy
Roosevelt in 1912 and 1916 and for Leonard Wood in
1920. They forget that four years later Knox ran for
governor of New Hampshire and lost a close race

campaign than the law allowed.
