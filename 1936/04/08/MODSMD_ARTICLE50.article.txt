# Sunday's Still Study-Night â€” Despite Library Budget
## 
### 
What a quiet place the Libe is on Friday
night! How much fun it would be l<> study
there! Or what a good place for Ah in Karpis
to hide from the G-men!
Last Friday night, the education grad was
sitting in his seat in the Reserve Book Boom,
and he seemed to be enjoying himself. He
seemed a bit forbidding, so we didn't ask him
whether he would rather study in the Libe
on Sunday night. Maybe he wouldn't.
However, there are 100 or so Stanford stu
dents who believe that Friday night was made
for relaxation, and Sunday night made for
study in the Library.
But nobody considers undergraduates. They
just pay the tuition and the syllabus fees so
that the graduates can learn about the ell'ect
of the morphology of the Spasmodic Gan
grenous Gruttly, and other interesting sub
jects.
