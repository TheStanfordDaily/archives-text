# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
That rugby is a brutalizing sport is the conclusion
derived from accounts of the ruggerous tour recently
taken into British Columbia by the local side-kicks.

A story goes that a Chi Psi had undertaken to
entertain one of the Canadian beauties and they were
parked in one of nature's spots of beauty. All was
quiet and still save the golden notes pouring from the
bursting throat of a nightingale, or maybe it was a
turkey buzzard. The beauty gazed at him with wide,
languorous eyes. The Chi Psi said "Mmmmmm?" The
beauty said '"Mmmmmha." So they drove off and
went to a show.
Food is a wonderful thing. If it were not for the
fact that we mortals had such a race to keep up with
the old nitrogen cycle, think of all the hashers who
would be out of jobs. Then, too, there are the aesthetic
considerations involved. There is the enjoyment to be
received from eating food.
That boys who live at Encina Commons have be
come somewhat calloused to the aesthetic considera
tions has been the contention of campus gagmen for
years, but it really was substantiated at the El Pussy
Cat eat house, which reactionaries call El Tigre.
On April 1, the hashers fixed up a horrible concoc
tion of tea, salt, pepper, and tooth powder, and served
it to the boys.
Half of the men drank it and half of the men didn't.
But nobody guessed it was a joke.
The news that the Chinese general Fang Chang
Wu nearly had a tray of soup spilled on him at the
Sigma Nu house yesterday, reminds the old timers
of the stories of tray-droppings of the past.
There is a tale about a fire-house laddie who
hashes in the Union dining room. It seems that he
was bussing out a big tray of dishes one time, when
the law of gravity sneaked up behind him. He dropped
the whole mess v,Uh a fearful clatter just as he was
heading for the kitchen door. Tearfully, penitently, he
scraped up the garbage, put it all back on his track.
Carefully he straightened up and started to make an
other attempt at getting out of the dining room, this
time his feet slid in the goo, and he went down for
the count with the tray and the plates and the gar
bage all over him. Men tittered and women guffawed.
The whole dining room rocked and roared.
Next came the problem of getting the hasher, the
tray, the plates, and the goo out of the dining room.
1. First the hasher picked himself up and shook
himself.
• 2. Then he picked up the tray.
3. Then he opened the kitchen door.
4. And slowly and deliberately threw the plates
one by one into the kitchen.

A story goes that a Chi Psi had undertaken to
entertain one of the Canadian beauties and they were
parked in one of nature's spots of beauty. All was
quiet and still save the golden notes pouring from the
bursting throat of a nightingale, or maybe it was a
turkey buzzard. The beauty gazed at him with wide,
languorous eyes. The Chi Psi said "Mmmmmm?" The
beauty said '"Mmmmmha." So they drove off and
went to a show.
Food is a wonderful thing. If it were not for the
fact that we mortals had such a race to keep up with
the old nitrogen cycle, think of all the hashers who
would be out of jobs. Then, too, there are the aesthetic
considerations involved. There is the enjoyment to be
received from eating food.
That boys who live at Encina Commons have be
come somewhat calloused to the aesthetic considera
tions has been the contention of campus gagmen for
years, but it really was substantiated at the El Pussy
Cat eat house, which reactionaries call El Tigre.
On April 1, the hashers fixed up a horrible concoc
tion of tea, salt, pepper, and tooth powder, and served
it to the boys.
Half of the men drank it and half of the men didn't.
But nobody guessed it was a joke.
The news that the Chinese general Fang Chang
Wu nearly had a tray of soup spilled on him at the
Sigma Nu house yesterday, reminds the old timers
of the stories of tray-droppings of the past.
There is a tale about a fire-house laddie who
hashes in the Union dining room. It seems that he
was bussing out a big tray of dishes one time, when
the law of gravity sneaked up behind him. He dropped
the whole mess v,Uh a fearful clatter just as he was
heading for the kitchen door. Tearfully, penitently, he
scraped up the garbage, put it all back on his track.
Carefully he straightened up and started to make an
other attempt at getting out of the dining room, this
time his feet slid in the goo, and he went down for
the count with the tray and the plates and the gar
bage all over him. Men tittered and women guffawed.
The whole dining room rocked and roared.
Next came the problem of getting the hasher, the
tray, the plates, and the goo out of the dining room.
1. First the hasher picked himself up and shook
himself.
• 2. Then he picked up the tray.
3. Then he opened the kitchen door.
4. And slowly and deliberately threw the plates
one by one into the kitchen.
That rugby is a brutalizing sport is the conclusion
derived from accounts of the ruggerous tour recently
taken into British Columbia by the local side-kicks.
