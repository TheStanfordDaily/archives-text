# Bull Session
## WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO FIGHT 
### 
Hold out your arm, palm up in [
the "'pit it out in mama's hand"
manner. If you have a determined
foothold on the ground and the
right "gimme it" look in your eye,
you're giving the newest in Amer
ican salutes —the salute of the Vet
erans of Future Wars. The official
description is—right arm held out, |
palm upward, expectant.

Now that Patriot Creamer has j
seen the possibility of some $1,000
birds in the hand—the amount of

bonus asked by
the V.F.W. — and
upstarted the ,
Stanford ''One 1
Eye Connelly" J
Post, that salutory f
gesture may well ;
supersede the
grunt of greeting
supposedly tradi
tional on the!
Farm. Facility in a
right arm waving 1
should come nat- I
„n

urally to all oi us
grade school graduates.

It's something of a shame that
Stanford had to horn in on the
movement as it did. Pulling a Con
nelly and crashing the gate was one
of the most undignified things Farm
students ever had to do. Back at
Princeton, .which is to the Future
Veterans what Long Beach is to the
Townsends, some aristocratic eye
brows very likely rose when Com
mander Creamer's much publicized
telegram arrived.

! The fact that the western schools \
weren't officially or otherwise asked |
to join seems to indicate that the ,
haughty easterners may* think we !
wouldn't help them fight the com- '
ing year? Now we weren't selfish |
like that about our Epic plan or our |
Townsend movement. And after all, '
we're prospective veterans of a fu— i
1 ture war. We have R.O.T.C. and !
L.I.D.

The Farm, if one stops to think <
about it, is an ideal spot for a ]
V.F.W. post. They have an aux
iliary known as the "Homefire Divi- j
sion." Several hundred Farm women
I who came to college to find husbands |
j are in line for that. And they also i
have an association for instruction |
in writing atrocity stories. There's ;
i timber for that here too. This Bull j
Sessioner, for example, has had no i
little experience in writing atro
ciously, so it is said.

I Out here on the coast with the
| mighty Nipponese warriors only
j 4000 miles away, the call to arms is
; something to expect momentarily, j
We who are about to fight need j
, compensation for the mental anguish j
which thinking about being gassed i
i and shot creates. And the price of
i that compensation, coincidently,
| comes to just $1,000.

MODESTO, April 7 (/P).—General
John J. Pershing was cited today for
speeding by three highway patrol j
J officers who once served under the
! wartime commander as enlisted
| men.
