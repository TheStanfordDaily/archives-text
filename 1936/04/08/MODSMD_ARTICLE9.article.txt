# VFW Measure 'Under Table' But Not Out
## Gros Proposes 'Slackers Of Future Wars'; Plans Pushed for Auxiliaries 
### Dave Botsford 
Post Commander Dick Creamer
and his aides came away from Ex
Committee meeting last night with
an official though "temporarily with
held" recognition for their "One-
Eyed Connelly" post of the Veterans
of Future Wars.
Members Limited
The committee unanimously ap
proved the new organization at the
first vote, but a later amendment
was passed limiting V.F.W. members
to those who are "able or unable."
Chief thorn in the veterans' side
was Frank Fullen wider, former
graduate man on Ex Committee,
"tramp out this movement now," he
said in an emotional 5-minute ora
tion. "Congress is annoyed enough
with lobbies and cranks. This
V.F.W. bonus thing is just another
bother."
A counter-organization to "com
pletely annihilate this damned
nuisance" was proposed by Student
Manager Bob Gros—the Slackers of
Future Wars.
'Under Table'
"Everybody knows that a disabled
veteran gets more bonus than an
able one," he said. "Therefore let
the V.F.W. shoot off the arms of
each Stanford chapter member; thus
doubling his bonus. Deceased vet
erans are worth still m6re, and if
Creamer's gents would commit sui
cide their unborn babies can collect
triple bonus without ever having to
bother about either another war or,
indeed, even a daddy."
Nevertheless, the committee meet
ing ended with the V.F.W. recog
nized but "under the table." Com
mander Creamer pled that since the
whole national membership had
been invited to a convention here in
August, 1937, the committee could
n't afford to ignore his Veterans.
Celebration Planned
Meanwhile, new V.F.W. plans
called for an Armistice Day cele
bration the day before Armistice
Day. "Anything to get ahead of
seditious peace makers," said
Creamer.

Subsidiary batallions of the wom
en's auxiliary, the Home Fire Divi
sion, were formed—the Sock-knit
ters and the Bandage-makers.
Grand and Exalted Mother Betty
Grover insists that knitting and
bandage-making for the next war
will begin immediately. All future
mothers are urged by Mother Grover
to attend a huge mass-meeting Fri
day afternoon.

Next meeting of the V.F.W. was
called for early next week when
convention plans will be laid. Until
then, Creamer's cry is "Unite, Fu
ture Soldiers, against Seditious
Peace Makers!"

called for an Armistice Day cele
bration the day before Armistice
Day. "Anything to get ahead of
seditious peace makers," said
Creamer.

Subsidiary batallions of the wom
en's auxiliary, the Home Fire Divi
sion, were formed—the Sock-knit
ters and the Bandage-makers.
Grand and Exalted Mother Betty
Grover insists that knitting and
bandage-making for the next war
will begin immediately. All future
mothers are urged by Mother Grover
to attend a huge mass-meeting Fri
day afternoon.

Next meeting of the V.F.W. was
called for early next week when
convention plans will be laid. Until
then, Creamer's cry is "Unite, Fu
ture Soldiers, against Seditious
Peace Makers!"
Post Commander Dick Creamer
and his aides came away from Ex
Committee meeting last night with
an official though "temporarily with
held" recognition for their "One-
Eyed Connelly" post of the Veterans
of Future Wars.
Members Limited
The committee unanimously ap
proved the new organization at the
first vote, but a later amendment
was passed limiting V.F.W. members
to those who are "able or unable."
Chief thorn in the veterans' side
was Frank Fullen wider, former
graduate man on Ex Committee,
"tramp out this movement now," he
said in an emotional 5-minute ora
tion. "Congress is annoyed enough
with lobbies and cranks. This
V.F.W. bonus thing is just another
bother."
A counter-organization to "com
pletely annihilate this damned
nuisance" was proposed by Student
Manager Bob Gros—the Slackers of
Future Wars.
'Under Table'
"Everybody knows that a disabled
veteran gets more bonus than an
able one," he said. "Therefore let
the V.F.W. shoot off the arms of
each Stanford chapter member; thus
doubling his bonus. Deceased vet
erans are worth still m6re, and if
Creamer's gents would commit sui
cide their unborn babies can collect
triple bonus without ever having to
bother about either another war or,
indeed, even a daddy."
Nevertheless, the committee meet
ing ended with the V.F.W. recog
nized but "under the table." Com
mander Creamer pled that since the
whole national membership had
been invited to a convention here in
August, 1937, the committee could
n't afford to ignore his Veterans.
