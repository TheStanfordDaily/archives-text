Willi all departments developing .
into mid-season form, predictions j
hold that, barring rain, a real old- j
time track meet will be held on I
Angell Field Saturday when Dink
Templeton's varsity meets Harry j
Trotter's U.CL.A. Bruins.
It's the first home start and the
first league start for the Cards, to |
say nothing of being a baptism for j
Stanford's new track plant, touted i
by many to be the coming head- j
quarters for western track and field j
athletics, and the times and dis
tances are going to be noteworthy. I
Kellogg and Hardin Out
Sam Kellogg and Wally Hardin ,
have been declared out of the jave- j
lin competition Saturday, due to in
juries, leaving third and fourth men j
Stone and McNitt to enjoy the fun |
with Bruin Carlin, who probably j
would have won anyway.
Another field event that might be |
tight is the broad jump, with U.C. i
L.A.'s Marumoto handicapped by j
the crowds ahead of Stanford's Dean, j
Voigt, and Kneubuhl. These latter
claim more fame from the field of j
sprinting, but all have been known '
to get out a soaring leap about once j
in every twenty.
Dean, Kneubuhl in Form
Kneubuhl and Dean are in plenty J
good form—they galloped a 22.1 220 I
yesterday without much effort be- !
hind Roy Kirkpatrick, who came j
down from San Mateo J.C. to pay I
a call. Chuck Voigt's ankle is stiil J
taped.
On the track the race of the day j
looks to be the 880. with Murphy |
and Young of the Bruins up against '
Malott, McCurdy, Burris, and maybe
Chuck Nimmo of Stanford. Murphy, j
when set right, is a corker, but. so '
are the others. Malott ran 1:57.3 in i
practicc yesterday; Nimmo has been j
complaining about feeling punk re
cently, but Nimmo always complains. !
He will probably win whatever he j
and Dink decide to enter him in Sat- ]
urday.
The pole vault belongs to Valen- i
tine and Massey of the Bruins al- '
ready, but a swell high jump league J
will be in action Saturday. Hank l
Luisetti jumped 6-1 five times yes- j
terday to become the fifth Stanford j
man over that height this year, while |
Houghton of U.C.L.A. is at home up j
there.

tight is the broad jump, with U.C. i

to get out a soaring leap about once j
in every twenty.

good form—they galloped a 22.1 220 I
yesterday without much effort be- !

down from San Mateo J.C. to pay I

taped.

looks to be the 880. with Murphy |
and Young of the Bruins up against '
Malott, McCurdy, Burris, and maybe
Chuck Nimmo of Stanford. Murphy, j
when set right, is a corker, but. so '
are the others. Malott ran 1:57.3 in i
