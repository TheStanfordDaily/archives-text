# Officials In Favor Of Exchange Dinners
## Deegees, Toros Promote Friendship Campaign 
### 
Tonight half the members of El ■
Toro, men's eating club, will sit j
down to dinner with half the mem- j
bers of Delta Gamma at the DG ;
house up the Row. At the same !
time the other halves of the two i
groups will dine at the eating club's !
dining room.
This exchange dinner marks the |
opening of a campaign to promote j
closer friendships between the Hall j
and Row factions on the Farm. !
Frances Strong, DG president, and j
Roy Anderson, president of the club, j
found in planning the get-together '
that it could be carried out without j
any extra expense.
Conversation topics which will I
be in order at the dinners will be
the relative merits of the honor code j
and proctor systems of examinations, j
the relative quality, quantity, and j
service of food at the two eating es- I
tablishments.
Approval of the campaign came I
from many sources on the campus j
last night. Following are typical j
statements:
Mrs. Alice I. Bodle, assistant dean
of women—
"It is a very good plan. I think j
however that it might be more ef- |
fective if it were carried out upon
an interest basis. Those participat- I
ing in an exchange dinner probably |
would not have enough interests in j
common to form a basis for lasting ,
friendship."
George B. Culver, dean of men—
"I think that it is a splendid idea.
Such ideas must be tried out to de
termine their success. The main !
!hing is the spirit behind it."
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president—
"I feel that this plan is entirely in !
keeping with the democratic spirit i
of the Stanford constitution and the
original University grant. Anything !
which will break down the caste
system between living groups is i
highly worth while. I think that a '
get-together of the whole student
body around a fire during the spring
would do much to unite the Farm."
