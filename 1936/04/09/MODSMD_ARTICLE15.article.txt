# Magazine Kid Has Faith, Makes Profit
## 
### Johnson Hill 
Most of you have seen him, this ]
little kid who sells magazines by
remote control in the Union Cellar.
He's of grammar school age . . . his |
name is not important.
You can walk in the Cellar lobby I
any time and see his stacks of mag
azines, together with the slotted cans
in which you put the price if you
take one. He doesn't stand by the
magazines and collect his money !
because he has to go to school, but j
that doesn't seem to make any dif- j
ference. He makes a pretty good '
deal of cash, anyway.
Business Better
And he's been making more since I
the Bookstore decided to remove its j
periodical racks from the Cellar last
winter.
Officials explained the action by
declaring that they consistently lost t

money, chiefly because, they alleged,
students had the habit of carrying
away magazines without forfeiting
the prix fixe.
Loses Little Money
The kid said yesterday that he
hadn't had much trouble along that
i line.
"Once in a while someone takes a
i magazine without paying for it, but
j not very often. I cxpect to lose a
| little bit that way. I guess people are
| in a hurry and forget to put the
noney in the cans," he smiled.
Business Shows Profit
He comes around every day, usu
| illy, to pick up his collections. And
' he collections are always there. The
| business always shows a profit.
He doesn't know exactly why the
Bookstore removed its racks, but
he's rather glad it did. He sells more
i magazines now.
