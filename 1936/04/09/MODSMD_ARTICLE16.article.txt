# Lanky Lads Sought For King
## Six Students Needed For Off-campus Canvass 
### Dave Botsford 
Know any tail, lean fellows built
on the bean-pole motif? Well, get
them out for the Masque Ball ruler
contest. They want a bean-poler for
king this year.
Remembering that there's still a
depression, it was suggested that
thinnies instead of fatties be favored
as candidates for king of the Masque
Ball.
Nominees Suggested
Suggested as possible nominees to
"honor the depression—it'll soon be
gone" are John Fowler, Barney
Greenlee, Hunt Kingsbury, Johnny
Porter, and Clem Smoot. Wes Mul
ler and Jack Loupe are being con
sidered for voters with cash for the
"heavies."
Nominations for both king and
queen, accompanied by ten signa
tures each, can be turned in at the
A.S.S.U. office or to Phil Coghlan,
Jim Ludlam, and their nominating
committee, from tomorrow until
Tuesday noon. Voting will begin
next Wednesday—at a penny a vote.
To Canvass Paly
Nancy Pettigrew, last year's queen,
and Helen Ramming, her sky-writ
ing competitor, wouldn't talk last
night about running again. Miss
Ramming, however, was reported
planning to back her best friend,
whose name was withheld.
Meanwhile, Art Lundin and Syl
via Case, heads of the off-campus
drive, were planning to move into
their downtown offices next week.
Mr. Allen of the Palo Alto Hardware
Company donated office space at 420
Byron street.
Twenty couples on Lundin's com
mittee will begin next Wednesday
to canvass Palo Alto residences for
funds for the Convalescent Home.
He still needs three men and three
women to cover the Menlo-Ather
ton territory, he said.
