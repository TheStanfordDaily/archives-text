# Panel Emphasizes Student Guidance For Honor System
## Students, Faculty Meet In Open Discussion Of Code Controversy 
### Johnson Hill 
Men's and Women's Council heads
made good their promises for dis
cussion on all phases of the Honor
Code last night when more than 150
persons rallied in the Women's
Clubhouse to participate in a stu
dent-faculty panel.
At the close of the session, three
definite plans were outlined for fur
ther consideration by Council offi
cials. They were:
1. A workable, efficient system of
guidance regarding the Code must
be provided for the benefit of
freshmen and transfer students en
tering the University for the first
time.
2. Supervision and direction of
the Honor Code can best be handled
through departments, with the
Men's and Women's Councils acting
as judicial medium for violations.
3. Steps must be taken to remedy
the "cowardice" of students in their
failure to consistently report viola
tions of the Honor Code made by
their fellows.
Those who attended the meeting
in preference to the fashion show
heard the panel of eight figures
prominent in campus activity lead
the discussion on problems of the
Honor System, which was followed
by questions from the floor.
Miss Louise Price, serving as
chairman, began the proceedings
with a statement of the topic, "What
Is the Matter with the Honor Code?"
and a brief interpretation of its
scope. Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. pres
ident, continued with a reading of
the fundamental standards doctrine
and the Honor Code as contained
in the University handbook.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, third
of the panel speakers, cited the ac
tual records included in the Presi
dent's Report, which described the
installation of the Honor Code at
Stanford in 1921. Roth added to his
remarks with an account of his ex
periences as a student before thu
Code was officially in operation.
Representing the English depart
ment at the table was Dr. Margery
Bailey, who emphasized removal of
the Honor Code from "the category
of jurisdiction." This action, she as
serted, would render the system
"more workable, pointed and hu
man."
Dr. Harold Hand of the School
of Education struck a dissenting,'
note when he declared that the
Bawlout, directory of students and
faculty members, exists as a hin
drance to the progress of the Honor
Code.
"The unmistakable pressure
brought to bear upon students' and
their academic conduct by the
Bawlout certainly is not an incen
tive to the practice of honesty in ex
aminations and the like," Dr. Hand
stated.
"Fundamentally., however, hon
esty in examinations is not the ob
ject of the Honor Code. That is a
part of our curriculum."
Dr. Hand's comment drew critical
attack from all sides of the table,
leader of which was Roth.
Jane Dodge, former women's edi
tor of The Daily, came forth with a
statement describing as an "insult"
the University's move last fall to
make examination booklets with a
variety of colors, replacing the tra
ditional "bluebooks." Gib Hollo
way, chairman of Men's Council,
presented a dissenting opinion.
Other discussion leaders on the
panel included Millard Browne, edi
tor of The Daily, Pat Flavel, chair
man of Women's Council, and Bo)>
Gros, student manager.
Seventy students competed in Ok
lahoma's intramural carnival.
