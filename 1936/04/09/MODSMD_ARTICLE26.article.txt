# Gray Matter

### Gray Creveling 
I BELIEVE that I'll take back
wh I I said about hating to be Tom
Mooney. I saw him during his trial
yesterday and he looks as well fed
as a capitalist.
Tic is the idol of millions of labor- !
crs and the sainted martyr of the i
cause. Adored by his laboring con- ]
temporaries, Mooney is a celebrity, j
and being a celebrity must be fun. j
At his present trial, which is a
hearing before the Supreme Court j
of California, Mooney is the only
one who seems to remember much ;
about the old Mooney-Billings trial.
He remembers "Exhibit H" and
"Exhibit Q ' as if he had just looked
at them. He whispers with his law
yer, George Davis, and then Davis
lives the witness some hell. He j
whispers again, and Davis gives the
vvitness additional hell.
MOONEY smiles, laughs, and !
okes with his counsel. He ribs his
flendants, and apparently basks
t I' j'ivably in his position. He would
n't have much to do if he were let |
< ut. What a let-down that will be {
; >r everyone concerned — the day j
.'/loon.' y is vindicated!
Jovial Tom draws the biggest'
< owds in the Superior Court cham- :
•rs on the fourth floor of the City
Hall. Other suits and trials are at- !
I''tided by a mere handful of people, j
There is one case up there in which |
someone is suing a restaurant for :
X".00() because he tripped on a faulty J
air, fell and broke his ankle, but
