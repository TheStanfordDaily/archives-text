## 
### John Shallenberger 
A large, grey Cad Vl6 pulled up
and parked in front of the Adminis
tration building, and the first man
to get out was tall, elderly, and had
a white mustache.
Your aspiring Daily reporter who
had been lying in wait for a man of
this description became nervous at
the first sight of the man he had
been assigned to interview.
As the gentleman in the company
of another man and two ladies
passed the first arch on his way to
Memorial Chapel, your reporter, bit
ing his lip. approached his man from
the rear, almost frightening him as
he asked, "General, what do you
think of ?" The man with the
white mustache turned around, i'his
wasn't General Pershing; it was
Lewis Stone. "Er, ah, Mr. Stone, ah,
what do you think of Stanford's new
theater project?"
But the expression on "Mr.
Stone's" face showed him he was
wrong again. This was John Living
ston, New York anthracite coal ty
coon. His companion was F. E. Kel
ler, Los Angeles oil magnate.
Feeling that these men would cer
tainly be insulted if Ihey weren't in
terviewed the men anyway.
"The Memorial Church is lovely,"
they said.
Now to find General Pershing.
Pershing would be eating lunch in
Paly, and would have reservations.
He called every restaurant in Stan
ford's beautiful suburb. The news
leaked out that the general was
planning to have lunch at the Presi
dent Hotel at noon.
At 11:30 your reporter was pacing
up and down in front of the en
trance to the hotel. At last, a chance
to interview his man. He stood at
the curb to hold the car door for
the real general, v/hen he arrived
at 12 o'clock. The reporter talked
about the humidity as he accom
panied the general to the dining
room. The crucial moment came
when the General and his sister had
settled down to rest after their trip.
"General, may I ask what you think
of ?"
"I'm sorry, but I cannot answer
any questions" was the reply.
Dr. Blaine of the University of
Miami asserts that "college men re
member little of what they learn in
textbooks and more from the ac
quired intellectual interests and hu
man sympathies developed during
the fours years of college."

Pershing would be eating lunch in

leaked out that the general was
planning to have lunch at the Presi

to interview his man. He stood at
the curb to hold the car door for
the real general, v/hen he arrived

Lewis Stone. "Er, ah, Mr. Stone, ah,
what do you think of Stanford's new
theater project?"
