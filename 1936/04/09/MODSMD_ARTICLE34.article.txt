# Il Duce Orders 'Annihilation'
## Revenge Sought by Italy For 1632 War Dead 
### 
ROME. April 8 (/P). â€” Premier
Mussolini declared today only "total
annihilation" of Ethiopian forces
would satisfy Fascist colonial secu
rity as Italy counted her war dead
from the African campaign.
Italian newspapers published what
were termed complete lists of East
African fatalities, naming 1632 Ital
ian soldiers killed, fatally wounded
or disappeared since the Ethiopian
invasion began.
II Duce's declaration was ad
dressed to members of the Fascist
Cabinet called together in a special
unannounced session.
He asserted total destruction of
Emperor Haile Selassie's armies
"cannot be lacking nor delayed,"
and at the same time declared "the
battle against sanctions proceeds ev
erywhere with the greatest decision
and success."
Convened at the same time the
League of Nations committee of 13
was meeting in Geneva to discuss
measures to bring peace to the Italo-
Ethiopian war, the Cabinet was re
minded by the Fascist dictator that
Italy sent an affirmative reply to the
league appeal for negotiations to end
hostilities.
