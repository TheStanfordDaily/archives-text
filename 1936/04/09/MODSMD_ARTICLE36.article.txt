COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, April 8
(/!'). â€”The mayor's secretary stacked
up a pile of circulars consigned to
the waste baskel. One envelope
seemed a little thinner than the
others. She took another look and
gasped. II contained a PW'A check
for $413,000, representing a 25 per
cent payment on a flood control
project here.
