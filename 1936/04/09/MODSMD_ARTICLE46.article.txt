## New Events Center On Increased Club Activity, Membership Campaign 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Council
adopted a preliminary plan for the
next five years' work for the Alumni
Association at a meeting Friday
night in San Francisco.
The plan centered about increased
activity in regard to new clubs, more
effective scholarship committees, the
use of motion pictures and alumni
conferences. Particularly to be
stressed will be a thorough campaign
for increased membership in the
Alumni Association.
The program also mentions one
of the most important alumni events
in the University's history, which
will be the 501b anniversary of the
beginning of Stanford, the celebra
tion to be held five years from now.
At the recent meeting the Council
also voted to reduce the association
membership fee of $4 to $2 for the
V'st year of membership for the
C\ass of 1936. The regular fee will
be charged after the first year.
