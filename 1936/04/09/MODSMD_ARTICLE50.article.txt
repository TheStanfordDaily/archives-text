"Has any seal been ordered for
i the University? If not, it should be
I attended to soon, and some little
i care should be taken to have one
! of which we will not in the future
' be ashamed."
Thus wrote David Starr Jordan,
t Stanford's first president, to Charles
G. Lathrop on August 3, 1891. Mr.
Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother,
manager of Senator Stanford's af
fairs in San Francisco, wrote to Mr.
Stanford:

"Referring to the attached com-
I munication from Dr. Jordan, I would
j ask for some suggestions from you
i in the matter of a seal for the »Uni
j versity. Do you think it would be
! well to have a seal made with the
I Palo Alto tree in the center, some
-5 thing like the attached, only smaller,
encircled with Ihe name 'Leland
| Stanford Junior University, Palo
: Alto, California'?"
The original of this letter is in the
j possession of Dr. Orrin L. Elliott,
j Registrar emeritus, who is now en
| imaged in writing a history of Stan
ford. Pasted to the bottom of the let
| ter is a picture of the Palo Alto tree,

! with a little steam locomotive, 1391
edition, standing by it.
Used on Diplomas
As revealed by Dr. Elliott's files,
this picture was used as the center'
portion of Stanford's first seal, en
circled by the inscription "Leland
Stanford Junior University, Organ
ized 1891." Diplomas were stamped
with it.
Today the "President's seal," as it
is called, is used by the President
and the Registrar on various official
communications. A reduced size has
been made for diplomas, with a few
hills and bushes added for back
ground.
When, in 1903, Mrs. Stanford
turned over the management of the
University to the trustees, they re
solved to adopt an official "trustees'
: seal." After debating the question
for five years, they finally in 1908
decided on one quite similar to the
President's seal.

| "Evergreen," beside the tree. At ;

present it is used by the Comptroller
and the trustees on otlicial docu

The seal seen most frequently
the one on notebooks, stationery,
and other Bookstore articles, is not
an otlicial seal.

Thus wrote David Starr Jordan,
t Stanford's first president, to Charles
G. Lathrop on August 3, 1891. Mr.
Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother,
manager of Senator Stanford's af
fairs in San Francisco, wrote to Mr.
Stanford:

"Referring to the attached com-
I munication from Dr. Jordan, I would
j ask for some suggestions from you
i in the matter of a seal for the »Uni
j versity. Do you think it would be
! well to have a seal made with the
I Palo Alto tree in the center, some
-5 thing like the attached, only smaller,
encircled with Ihe name 'Leland
| Stanford Junior University, Palo
: Alto, California'?"
The original of this letter is in the
j possession of Dr. Orrin L. Elliott,
j Registrar emeritus, who is now en
| imaged in writing a history of Stan
ford. Pasted to the bottom of the let
| ter is a picture of the Palo Alto tree,

! with a little steam locomotive, 1391
edition, standing by it.
Used on Diplomas
As revealed by Dr. Elliott's files,
this picture was used as the center'
portion of Stanford's first seal, en
circled by the inscription "Leland
Stanford Junior University, Organ
ized 1891." Diplomas were stamped
with it.
Today the "President's seal," as it
is called, is used by the President
and the Registrar on various official
communications. A reduced size has
been made for diplomas, with a few
hills and bushes added for back
ground.
When, in 1903, Mrs. Stanford
turned over the management of the
University to the trustees, they re
solved to adopt an official "trustees'
: seal." After debating the question
for five years, they finally in 1908
decided on one quite similar to the
President's seal.
Trustees Copy
It has the same tree, with the
words "Seal of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, 1885" in the mar
gin, and "Semper Virens," meaning i
| "Evergreen," beside the tree. At ;

present it is used by the Comptroller
and the trustees on otlicial docu
ments.
The seal seen most frequently
the one on notebooks, stationery,
and other Bookstore articles, is not
an otlicial seal.
"Has any seal been ordered for
i the University? If not, it should be
I attended to soon, and some little
i care should be taken to have one
! of which we will not in the future
' be ashamed."
