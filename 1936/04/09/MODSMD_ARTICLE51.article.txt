TOP ROW? AZUCAR? ,
INDIAN BROOM? WHICH?
It .should be a stirring race next 1
Saturday — the $10,000 Marchbank j
Handicap Saturday at Tanforan. 1
This despite the small entry, most ]
of the owners being frozen out with
the apparent "cinch" yielded to Top
Row.
That trim horse, late winner of the
top $100,000 Santa Anita stake, is
still the odds-on favorite, regardless
of a noticeable limp shown in early
week workouts.
Top Row will carry a stifT 324
pounds, but with Jockey Wayne
Wright up should cop the purse.
Carrying the bantam impost will
be Indian Broom, at 94 pounds.
This red-coat pony is the outsider,
with little backing until he upset
the Peninsula Handicap field last
Saturday. Basil James, an able ap- I
prentice, is up.
That race last Saturday was the
most impressive victory of the
Tanfo meeting. Getting ofT to a
poor outside start, Indian Broom
began to overhaul the others
coining out of the first turn, kept
right on breezing past, canic into i
the stretch neck and neck with !
1 lie leader and rocked home liy
lengths, with plenty of run left.
And an awfully pretty stride.
The question-mark of the race
will be F. M. Alger's Azucar, who, j
in this world of multiplicity and
change, can run any West Coast
three-year-old into the ground on a !
good day, but who ought to be in
front of a milk wagon on others, j
There is, however, a good race or j
two in this stake pony, and Satur- 1
day may be the palmy day.
Fourth contender is Thursday, one
of Santa Anita stars. Open Range |
is the leading outsider in the betting. !
The others are running for the ex- i
ercise.

back a four bits or so on the $2 —
usually. (2) Pick a lively long-shot
and play him on the nose. If he
romps home 20 to 150 dollars slip
into the old sock. This is where the
"hunch" and the "tip" come in.

STANFORDS GOOD AT
FOLLOWING THE HORSES

During the Tanforan meeting, !
which closes Saturday, considerable
interest has been shown by Stan
ford men and women. The happy 1
point, for racing followers, is that
those who come once come again |
often.
Students who pay the 40-cent ad
mission don't go just to watch the
horses run, either, they go to bet;
splitting up a $2 ticket two or more |
ways is a modest investment and I
fine entertainment. Some good •
money has come back to the Farm, |
too, as well as a quota of empty j
pockets.
They bet either one of two ways:
(1) Bet on the favorites to place
(second) or show (third) and get
TOP ROW? AZUCAR? ,
INDIAN BROOM? WHICH?
It .should be a stirring race next 1
Saturday — the $10,000 Marchbank j
Handicap Saturday at Tanforan. 1
This despite the small entry, most ]
of the owners being frozen out with
the apparent "cinch" yielded to Top
Row.
That trim horse, late winner of the
top $100,000 Santa Anita stake, is
still the odds-on favorite, regardless
of a noticeable limp shown in early
week workouts.
Top Row will carry a stifT 324
pounds, but with Jockey Wayne
Wright up should cop the purse.
Carrying the bantam impost will
be Indian Broom, at 94 pounds.
This red-coat pony is the outsider,
with little backing until he upset
the Peninsula Handicap field last
Saturday. Basil James, an able ap- I
prentice, is up.
That race last Saturday was the
most impressive victory of the
Tanfo meeting. Getting ofT to a
poor outside start, Indian Broom
began to overhaul the others
coining out of the first turn, kept
right on breezing past, canic into i
the stretch neck and neck with !
1 lie leader and rocked home liy
lengths, with plenty of run left.
And an awfully pretty stride.
The question-mark of the race
will be F. M. Alger's Azucar, who, j
in this world of multiplicity and
change, can run any West Coast
three-year-old into the ground on a !
good day, but who ought to be in
front of a milk wagon on others, j
There is, however, a good race or j
two in this stake pony, and Satur- 1
day may be the palmy day.
Fourth contender is Thursday, one
of Santa Anita stars. Open Range |
is the leading outsider in the betting. !
The others are running for the ex- i
ercise.

back a four bits or so on the $2 —
usually. (2) Pick a lively long-shot
and play him on the nose. If he
romps home 20 to 150 dollars slip
into the old sock. This is where the
"hunch" and the "tip" come in.
