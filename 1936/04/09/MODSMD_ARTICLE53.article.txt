# Indians Get Hits, Outscored By Troy, 16-13
## Two Big Innings Win For U.S.C.; Cards Meet Cal In First Game Saturday 
### Dale Reimer 
In a wild free-hitting contest,
U.S.C. baseballers yesterday after
noon succeeded in lacing out a 16-13
victory over the Card nine. The
game was the second part of a
doubleheader in the Sunken Dia
mond, the first game of which was
also won by U.S.C. from Santa
Clara by an 8-4 margin.
The Card-Trojan contest was a
real slugfest, with the Indian gar
nering 14 hits off three Trojan
pitchers, including Joe Gonzales,
Trojan star, and the men from Troy
getting 16 bingles off a like number
of Stanford hurlers.
Two big innings, the third and
fourth, in which U.S.C. scored 6 and
8 runs, respectively, built up a big
lead which the Cards were unable
to overcome.
Up to the third inning the Cards
enjoyed a 4-2 lead by virtue of a
four-run outburst in the first inn
ing. But the 12-run lead which the
Trojans assumed in the fourth was
too much for the Cards to overcome
although they rallied desperately in
the latter part of the game.
Batting honors were fairly evenly
divided among Card players, every
member of the team except the
pitchers getting at least one hit. Bill
Newsom was the star, however, with
four, a triple, two doubles, and a
single, in five trips to the plate. Hal
Sieling and Dave Schwartz of the
visitors both drove out home runs,
while Richard Herzog also collected
four hits.
Glenn Hamilton started the game
for the Cards and pitched three inn
ings, when he was relieved by How
ard Paine. Paine pitched only one
inning before he was succeeded by
Spike Furman, who finished the
game, permitting only three hits and
no runs the rest of the way.
Saturday the Cards are scheduled
to take on California in the first of
a three-game series. The dope on
the two teams indicates a toss-up as
each has won one game, the Cards
beating Santa Clara, while the Bears
have given U.S.C. its only defeat.
