# Vibert Is Hope for Swim Win Over Cal
## 
### 
When the Indians tangle with a
California swimming team, starved
of Big Meet wins since 1917, al 10
o'clock Saturday morning in Encina
pools, it will be Jack Vibert who
will navigate most of Stanford's
hopes for victory.
Coach Nort Thornton says in spite
of ratings over Cal in team cham
pionship meets this year, this year's
Big Meet will be the biggest, as far
as equally strong teams are con
cerned, in Stanford's swimming
history. . j
Vibert will anchor the free-style
relay team, unbeaten in collegiate
competition this year, and he will
swim both the 100 and the 220. The
relay will have to remain unbeaten
Saturday if the Indians are to chalk
up another Big Meet victory.
Captain Welden Smith comes up
against Vibert in the 220. Smith has
been swimming better time than
when the Stanford sophomore
touched him out in the event at the
team championships last month. But
it's a matter of an oath with Vibert
that Smith will be beaten Saturday.
Jim Werson and Paul Collins will
probably take one-two in the breast
stroke. Werson is sure to crash tjie
old Big Meet record of 2:36.4.
Against Fullerton J.C. this week he
swam the 200 yards in 2:31.6 —
smashing the Coast record by four
seconds! He's the man, too, that
stands in the way of the Indians
taking the medley relay.
Big Bill Lhamon and Henry God
man should even up points lost in
the breast stroke by picking up the
first two places in the 50. If Law

rence of California squeezes in ahead
of either of these two —well, to quote
Thornton, "it will be things like that
that will lose the meet."
Roy Siem, the man that will make
Cal figure in the back stroke, has
been suffering from a weak heart
and may not be on deck Saturday.
If he's there he'll give Bob Walker
a very close race; if he's not, you
can count that race for the Indians.
In the 440 it will be an unpre
dictable three-way race among Don
Peterson and Dave Rider of Stan
ford and Jack Dozier of California.
Dozier and Peterson always put on
a good race, but it's only been the
last week and a half that Rider has
shown himself as the one to beat.
Captain Tom Boothe will have
no trouble out-diving Danny Kuhn
of the Bears. He has beaten him
twice this year.

Saturday if the Indians are to chalk
up another Big Meet victory.
Captain Welden Smith comes up
against Vibert in the 220. Smith has
been swimming better time than
when the Stanford sophomore
touched him out in the event at the
team championships last month. But
it's a matter of an oath with Vibert
that Smith will be beaten Saturday.
Jim Werson and Paul Collins will
probably take one-two in the breast
stroke. Werson is sure to crash tjie
old Big Meet record of 2:36.4.
Against Fullerton J.C. this week he
swam the 200 yards in 2:31.6 —
smashing the Coast record by four
seconds! He's the man, too, that
stands in the way of the Indians
taking the medley relay.
Big Bill Lhamon and Henry God
man should even up points lost in
the breast stroke by picking up the
first two places in the 50. If Law

rence of California squeezes in ahead
of either of these two —well, to quote
Thornton, "it will be things like that
that will lose the meet."
Roy Siem, the man that will make
Cal figure in the back stroke, has
been suffering from a weak heart
and may not be on deck Saturday.
If he's there he'll give Bob Walker
a very close race; if he's not, you
can count that race for the Indians.
In the 440 it will be an unpre
dictable three-way race among Don
Peterson and Dave Rider of Stan
ford and Jack Dozier of California.
Dozier and Peterson always put on
a good race, but it's only been the
last week and a half that Rider has
shown himself as the one to beat.
Captain Tom Boothe will have
no trouble out-diving Danny Kuhn
of the Bears. He has beaten him
twice this year.
When the Indians tangle with a
California swimming team, starved
of Big Meet wins since 1917, al 10
o'clock Saturday morning in Encina
pools, it will be Jack Vibert who
will navigate most of Stanford's
hopes for victory.
Coach Nort Thornton says in spite
of ratings over Cal in team cham
pionship meets this year, this year's
Big Meet will be the biggest, as far
as equally strong teams are con
cerned, in Stanford's swimming
history. . j
Vibert will anchor the free-style
relay team, unbeaten in collegiate
competition this year, and he will
swim both the 100 and the 220. The
relay will have to remain unbeaten
Saturday if the Indians are to chalk
up another Big Meet victory.
