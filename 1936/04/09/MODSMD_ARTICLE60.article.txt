##

I , ,
Cleaned by Cal s up and coming
! frosh tracksters, but still hoping to
] stop Stanford's yearlings, the Mo-
I desto J.C. spikesters are slated to
i meet the Indian beginners on An
j gell Field Saturday morning at 10
o'clock.
Pole vaulter Kenny Dills of the
Modestans has exceeded 13 feet in
j 'he pole vault; while Todd, javelin
j thrower, has pegged the spear over
I 200 feet.
i They are also reported to be

strong in the shot and discus, bu
seem to lack outstanding men ii
the other events. This means thn
the steadily improving Indian Fro.-1
may have a chance to win, despit<
the fact that Rudy Kelley, s'
broad jumper and sprinter, will i>
out for another week, allowing i
pulled muscle to recuperate.
