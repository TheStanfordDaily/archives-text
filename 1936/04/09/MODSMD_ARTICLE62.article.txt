# U.S.C. Mystery Tracksters To Reveal Wares
## Meet Saturday with Cal Will Show Strength Of Highly Praised Trojans 
### 
Three stories will be told Satur
day afternoon in Berkeley when
the mysterious track forces from
U.S.C. venture to battle with the
California varsity.
Tale number one will bo an an
swer to the question "just how
strong is the Trojan track team?"
Number two will go far to tell learn
strengths on the Coast, with results
also available from the Stanford-
Uela meet here in the stadium.
Number three is concerned with the
stars who will go to Berlin with the
Olympic team this summer.
Strength Unknown
Actual strength of Dean Crom
well's sun-bathed tracksters is not
known in these parts, it being the
policy of Cromwell and his comrade,
the publicity dispenser, Al Wesson,
to clothe the early-season strength
■if their team in the deepest shrouds
of mystery.
Local gossip has it, however, that
the southern warriors are three
deep in every event, and should be
able to beat Cal in a jog. It is a
known fact that Cromwell has the
best college team in America today.
Many Stars
Take, for instance, the pole vault,
with five men over 13.G, Meadows
and Sefton given an even chance for
the Berlin trip. Or the sprints, with
Foy Draper, Al Fitch, and George
Boone, plus new frosh, good for 9.7
centuries.
Then they have IGO-foot discus
tossers, 215-foot javelin throwers,
6.7 high-jumpers, 1.52 half-milers,
two 14.2 high hurdlers—all ranking
as top cream in the American bottle.
Saturday will also show with what
Cromwell will welcome Templeton's
forces when the locals journey to
Los Angeles April 18.
