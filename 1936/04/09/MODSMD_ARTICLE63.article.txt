California freshman swimmers
come down to the Farm along with
the varsity team Saturday morning
to race against the Indian yearlings
at Encina pools in the annual Little
B>ig Meet.
The two freshman captains,' Win
field Needham of the Cardinals and
Bill Newsom of Ihe Bears, are the
stand-outs. Needham will be out to
shatter records in the 220 and the
440.
Coach Thornton says the Stanford
youngster is Olympic Games mate
rial for the 1500 meters. "I've
watched Medica, Gilhula, and all
the rest of them," he goes on. "but
Needham's the prettiest bit of swim
ming machinery I've ever seen."
Sprinter Newsom equaled Stan
ford's Reggie Harrison's 10-year-old
mark of 24.8 in the 50 the other
day against Fullerton J.C. A little
later he came out to swim through
the 100 in 55.6. That means he's not
bad either.
California freshmen beat Fuller
ton swimmers in a tri-cornered meet
including the Bear:-:' varsity. Stan
ford freshmen lost to Fullerton Mon
day 43-40.
