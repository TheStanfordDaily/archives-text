## Captain of Team Assigns His Own Conquerors 
### 
HOUSTON, Texas, April 8
Wilmer Allison, captain of the
United States Davis cup team for
the matches against Mexico, today
assigned Bryan M. Grant and Don
Budge to play the singles matches
after they had wrecked his title
I hopes in the River Oaks tennis
tournament.
Grant won his second consecutive
River Oaks championship yesterday
by defeating the 1935 national
champion, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. It was
! the first time in years that Allison
had dropped the decisive set of a
j match without winning a game.
Hopeful of salvaging at least a
I share of the doubles championship,
the Texan then teamed with John
j Van Ryn against Budge and Gene
i Mako, but the colorful young Cali
; fornians provided too much compe
j tiiion. They won, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.
j Members of the Mexican team
I took their final workouts today.
