# Legality Of New Regulation Questioned
## Charges Made Regarding Appointment By – Law For Ex Committee Posts 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Delayed research into Tuesday's
hurriedly passed constitutional
amendment, providing that appoint
ments could be made to fill tempo
rarily-vacated posts on Ex Com
mittee, began yesterday after
charges were made that the by-law
was unconstitutional. The measure
was passed unanimously by Ex
Committee with no mention of the
fact that its legality might be ques
tionable.
This bit of political maneuvering
which made Ex Committee refuse
Bobby Grayson's resignation ap
parently was caused by a wish fox
economy from that previously
freely dispensing body.
If Grayson remains nominally a
member for two more weeks, no
special election will be required.
Therefore he will be called "tempo
rarily absent," replaced by an ap
pointee, and will be at liberty to
resign in two weeks, when the ap
pointee may legally remain in office
until the end of the quarter.
. "A maneuver, yes—but justified
by the expense a special election
now would cause," claims President
Wally Brooke. "It's just a political
dodge—even the by-law is unconsti
tutional," asserted ex-member Frank
Fullen wider.
Refusal of a closed date for the
spring musical was another signifi
cant move of Tuesday's Ex Commit
tee session. Friday has already been
granted; a second performance may
be given Saturday, but other cam
pus affairs may also take place, de
creed the group.
This refusal to mollycoddle dra
matics to an even greater extent
will result in a lowered box office
take, assert Dramatic Council mem
bers. Granting of a closed date
would make other spring social ac
tivities even more limited, insists
Ex Committee.

The Griff Williams assembly
scheduled for next week was cheer
fully passed. "Advertising for
nothing? Maybe. But it'll be good
entertainment," said the group.

In continuance of President
Brooke's National Interest policy
was the endorsement of the Ameri
can Youth Act.
It is another fund-distributing
policy, coming up for a Congres
sional vote in the near future, which
aims to provide financially for the
youth of the nation. Stanford will
send in figures, proving that 12 per
cent of the student body now re
ceives NYA money and thus de
serves future relief, and thus enter
ing their claim on any future divi
dends.

take, assert Dramatic Council mem
bers. Granting of a closed date
would make other spring social ac
tivities even more limited, insists
Ex Committee.

The Griff Williams assembly
scheduled for next week was cheer
fully passed. "Advertising for
nothing? Maybe. But it'll be good
entertainment," said the group.

In continuance of President
Brooke's National Interest policy
was the endorsement of the Ameri
can Youth Act.
It is another fund-distributing
policy, coming up for a Congres
sional vote in the near future, which
aims to provide financially for the
youth of the nation. Stanford will
send in figures, proving that 12 per
cent of the student body now re
ceives NYA money and thus de
serves future relief, and thus enter
ing their claim on any future divi
dends.
Delayed research into Tuesday's
hurriedly passed constitutional
amendment, providing that appoint
ments could be made to fill tempo
rarily-vacated posts on Ex Com
mittee, began yesterday after
charges were made that the by-law
was unconstitutional. The measure
was passed unanimously by Ex
Committee with no mention of the
fact that its legality might be ques
tionable.
This bit of political maneuvering
which made Ex Committee refuse
Bobby Grayson's resignation ap
parently was caused by a wish fox
economy from that previously
freely dispensing body.
If Grayson remains nominally a
member for two more weeks, no
special election will be required.
Therefore he will be called "tempo
rarily absent," replaced by an ap
pointee, and will be at liberty to
resign in two weeks, when the ap
pointee may legally remain in office
until the end of the quarter.
. "A maneuver, yes—but justified
by the expense a special election
now would cause," claims President
Wally Brooke. "It's just a political
dodge—even the by-law is unconsti
tutional," asserted ex-member Frank
Fullen wider.
Refusal of a closed date for the
spring musical was another signifi
cant move of Tuesday's Ex Commit
tee session. Friday has already been
granted; a second performance may
be given Saturday, but other cam
pus affairs may also take place, de
creed the group.
This refusal to mollycoddle dra
matics to an even greater extent
will result in a lowered box office
take, assert Dramatic Council mem
bers. Granting of a closed date
would make other spring social ac
tivities even more limited, insists
Ex Committee.
