# Trojan Netmen To Meet Cards Here Saturday
## S.C. Squad Comes North Minus Make; No. 1 Man Is in Pre-Davis Cup Play 
### 
From the distant era of the south
land comes the rumble of the in
vading Trojan racketeers. They will
endeavor to put the defenders of
Stanford tennis honor on the spot
when they clash with them here
Saturday.
Victors in the first matches played '
between the two teams, the boys
from Los Angeles are favored to re
peat. However, sans the service of
i their ace. Gene Mako, they may find
1 it harder going against the Laws,
| Deys, Underwoods. Sewards, Pom
mels, Bralys, and Clarks, who fly
! the Stanford net flag.
Carr S.C. Star
Although Mako is in the East pre- '
paring to take an active part in
| Davis Cup play, several good boys
\ are pledged to "carry on for Gene."
These include Chuck Carr, Vein
John, Jack Nemeyer, Louis Wether
; ell, Jack Cremer. Jack Hall, Lloyd
i Hansen, and Bob Rawley.
Carr is the team's star during the
! absence of Mako, and is one of the
j best known college netmen on the
; Coast.
Underwood Improves
Steadily improving, arid showing |
great promise this spring, is the {
sophomore, Bob Underwood. He '

worked his way up the ladder from
sixth to third position during the
season, and showed his mettle last
Friday by trimming Tate Coulthard,
the touted Cal third man, winning
the last two sets without loss of a
game.
The first doubles team is still Dey
and Pommer, combining the flashy
play of Dey and the steadying in
fluence of Pommer; second doubles
is still Bill Seward and Underwood.
"Red" charges are being investi
gated at Minnesota.
