# Ten Bucks Worth Of Maneuvering

|{ccause Frank Fullenwider, I he uncanny
former (loan of campus politics, chanced to
atlciul Kx Committee Tuesday night, I ho
question ol' constitutionality ot Kx Commit
tee's now oloolion hy-law has boon brought to
light.
Tho moasuro deals with tho resignation of
Kx Committee inoinbors and is designed to
cover tho recent withdrawal of Bob Grayson.
Kx (loin mil tee reasoned by refusing to accept
Grayson's resignation, they could appoint a
ineirtber "temporarily" to take his place.
So they passed a by-law, which stated that
temporary absences on Kx Committee could
be (i I let I by thai body itself. The lad that
Grayson's absence was not temporary, but a
resignation, the fact that the by-law is pal
pably unconstitutional is a point if not a
letter.
That Kx Committee was acting not from
political motives, but on the basis of expedi
ency, seems also true. Two weeks appears to
be a short time, and *10 for an election seems
a lot of money to Kx Committee.
It inav be a lot of money now, but if it opens

tip a legal loop-hole that may lead to future
political manipulation, ward-heeling, and the
destruction of student control of alVairs, it
will be one of the most costly $10 the Kx
Committee ever spent.
Kx Committee is ;i jolly body. II has more
good gag men than can be found on Molly
wood Boulevard. That is as it should he.
Still. ;is Mr. Creamer points out, it could
stand a coincidence Unit combines ability
with power.
