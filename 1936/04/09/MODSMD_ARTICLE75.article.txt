# Knox--Journalism's Gift to Politics
## 
### Peter Allen 
(Editor's Note: The following is the second ar
ticle in which Peter Allen talks over Col. Frank
Knox's professional and political policies. The
Chicago publisher will he prominently mentioned
in the Republican National Convention this sum
mer.)
Publisher Frank Knox certainly gives his writers on
the Chicago Daily News a free hand. Take the case of
Columnist Howard O'Brien who often looks at his
boss from the other side of the fence. He wrote: "I
am convinced that Frank Knox would be a good
president, efficient, worthy of all trust; but I am
equally convinced that as president he would do
things that are utterly abhorrent to him now and per
force leave undone practically all of the things he
now advocates."
May lie O'Brien is right. Knox says he's mad and
then gives him a column to be mad in. At any rate,
Knox's proposals follow. For O'Brien sympathizers
they represent what the Chicago publisher will not do
if elected.
11;- has been an anti-New Dealer editorially since
the middle of 11)33, and in the same manner his cam
paign promises are more anti-New Deal than pro-
G.O.P. Like all sane Republicans in 1936, he pledges
a balanced budget a spend-what-you-have policy as
opposed to Rooseveltian extravagance.
"Reasonably accurate calculations," he says, "indi
cate a pent-up demand of not less than twenty billion
dollars for new equipment, machinery, and goods of
every description."
A spark of confidence would start that billion
dollar demand rolling, Knox believes, and lie hopes it
will be supplied by the prospect of sound governmental
economies and return to the gold standard, which he
will fight for. Once men are back to work, relief
appropriations would he carved out of Federal ex
penditures and budget-balancing would be easy.
On the social front Knox favors securities regula
tion, collective bargaining for labor hut not by the
coercion of the Wagner Bill, and a healthy competitive
system in industry with the Big Stick lurking in the
background. He is opposed to constitutional changes.
Whatever you think of Knox's proposals (and to
say the least they possess the short-sightedness com
mon to Republican methods) I believe he has the
personal strength to put them across if he ever moves
into the White House. Almost exactly twenty-four
years ago, Knox and a couple of confederates were
trying to cajole Roosevelt the First into snatching the
Republican nomination from Taft. T.R.'s refusal was
firm.
Finally Knox exploded, "Why, Colonel, this is the
first time I've known you to show the yellow streak."
Then it was Roosevelt's turn to explode, but Knox had
won his point.
That remark gives you a good picture of Frank
Knox. He's blunt, impetuous, independent and hard
driving.
But all the strength in the world won't do Knox
any good ft he isn't elected, and lie probably won't be.
He's got most of the upper few thousand on his side,
and they could nominate him. But straw poll figures
released earlier this week by the American Institute
of Public Opinion make the facts plain. Unless Knox
can think up some method of pulling mass votes among
the farmers and workers, his chances for election are
pretty slim.
