make interâ– fraternity rules which are literally
Nazi-like in their strictness.

their aclivilies suspended and their houses
closed for the remainder of the quarter. They
had violated the anti hell week rule. Knforec
incnt like that is something lor the Farm's
much - troubled - with - rules Inlerfraternily
Hoard to think about.
