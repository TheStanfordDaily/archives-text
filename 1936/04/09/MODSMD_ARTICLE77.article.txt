Knocking about the Law L.ibe is a book from the
International Correspondence School on ' Negligence."
This is quite a sad thing, when students going to law
school use correspondence school books, the old grads
might say. But what they would say when they found
out that a distinguished Stanford law prof wrote it,
I don't know.
One of the Phi Delt sophomores was having a guest
to lunch, just to prove, probably, that people can have
guests to lunch without being given a requisition by
the Interfraternity Council. Anyway, he was having
a guest to lunch. As he walked over the spacious Phi
Delt lawn, he happened to notice a row of Deegees
oil their porch silhouetted against the sky. The sopho
more and his guest gazed upwards as they walked
along. Suddenly, the Phi Delt stubbed his toe on a
daisy and fell flat on his face.
Everybody likes to serve on dance committees for
big dances. Primarily, the reason is that it is fun to
put up decorations, write grut publicity for The Daily,
shift chairs around, and sneeze when the dust gets in
your nose. Of course there is another angle to it, in
that there are free bids passed around to deserving
youths on the committees.
The fact that we have coeducational committees
might make it seem unfair to women members, since
they wouldn't have to pay for their bid anyway, or
so they say. But the free bid has a great deal of
value to the womanly woman.
There are a great mass of slickers on t lie campus,
who watch out for the paper's announcement of women
who get on the committees and therefore receive free
bids. Women committee members report a great in
crease in telephone calls the night that the commit
tees arc announced.
One Lagunita woman on the Junior Prom reported
receiving several "sealed proposals" from a brakeman
on the El Toro gravy train. While one Lagunita per
petual committee woman with a motherly disposition
who was 011 both the Junior Prom and Masque Ball
committees got two invitations to attend these two
social affairs of the season from the enterprising Rally
Committee head, who tried to get in on the inside
track by finding out his facts early and asking her
before the committee members were announced.
It is said, however, that both women are holding
out for higher offers.
