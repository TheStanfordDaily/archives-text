# Society Selects Spring Reading
## Sword, Sandals To Give Anniversary PlaY 
### 
Bulwer-Lytton's famous play,
"Richelieu," was chosen yesterday
at a meeting of Sword and Sandals
for (he club's anniversary reading to
be given in May. Since there will
be no admission charge, it was nec
essary to choose a play without a
royalty.
"Prometheus Unbound," a myth
ical and spectacular poetical drama
by Percy B. Shelley, was a close
contestant, but considering the suc
cess which attended the recent read
ing of "Cyrano de Bcrgerac" by Ed
mund Rostand, the society finally
| decided in favor of "Richelieu" in
asmuch as it is better known.
Before commencing rehearsals on
this reading, however, the club will
conclude rehearsals on "Once in a
Lifetime," to be given next Wednes
day. Wiih the casting of "June
Moon" relatively complete, Dick
Dawson, director of the reading, has
now assigned the remaining parts.
Rosemary Benet will read May,
Mary Ann Wheeler is Helen Hobart,
while Fred Clark and Mac Gordon
take the important men's parts of
Lawrence Vale and Jerry, respec
tively. About 20 students will par
. . . . i â€ž r
I ticipate in the reading.
