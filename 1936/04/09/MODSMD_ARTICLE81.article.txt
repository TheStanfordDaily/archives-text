"IN DI HIOLS BATTLE." by John
Steinbeck. New York: C'ovici-
Friedc, lft.'MJ
Reminiscent of California's recent
j agricultural labor disputes, this pro
! letarian novel by a Stanford gradu
! ate deals with a strike among the
; fruit-pickers of the "Torgas Valley."
Jim Nolan, discouraged by the sor
-1 did hopelessness of his life and that
i of his parents before him, joins ths
[ Communist party. His first assign
ment is to help h; rd-boiled, soft
' hearted "Mac" foment trouble among
' the "fruit tramps." Their aim is not
jto win the strike, although that
w«.uld be acceptable, but to teach
! the "working stills" to co-operate |
! and learn their collective power.
By the end of the book, the ruth
| lessncss of the strike has hardened
I Jim into a first-class Communist, j
IHe can watch without flinching i
I while "Mac" dispassionately beats a '
j high-school youth into a pulp, as an
j example to his interfering class- !
i mates. When Jim's face is blown off
by a vigilante's shotgun, the Party !
! loses a promising Comrade.
If Mr. Steinbeck' s aim was to fur- ,
thcr the cause of Communism, he
! fails. The very cold, brutal detach- j
I ment with which the story is told
| leaves one with as much a horror
of the workers' excesses as of the
j owners' cruelty.
However, I do not think that this
i was the author' , purpose. Although j
j sympathetic with the workers, he I
i wants to be impartial, to see both :
| sides of the question. Like quizzical j
] "Doc" Burton, who is not a Party :
member but helps them out during!
strikes, he might say, "I want to see j
the whole picture as nearly as I can.
.... I want tq be able to look at the
whole thing."

If Mr. Steinbeck' s aim was to fur- ,

of the workers' excesses as of the

However, I do not think that this

member but helps them out during!
strikes, he might say, "I want to see j
the whole picture as nearly as I can.
