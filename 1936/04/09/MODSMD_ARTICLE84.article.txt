# HAIL TO THE MED CORPS

The Editor, Sir:
Our attention has been called to 1
the fact that various patriotic citi
zens are in the very commendable j
process of organizing combatant!
forces for engaging in possible fu
ture wars, and we feel that we, as I
potential members of a time-hon
ored profession, should not be back- 5
ward in supporting this worthy en
terprise. Therefore, we announce at
| this time the formation of the Med
l ieal Corps of the Veterans of Future
f Wars.
Naturally, in the event of any fu
ture bonus benefits wo shall be only 1
too glad to share in those imme
diately, thus forestalling the dis
astrous consequences of any unfore- ;
seen, but admittedly possible casual- !
ties. As is obvious, the measure of i
our services will be in our ability
to decrease the formation of a large ;
, active number of Future Home Fire
Mothers. We wish to stress the fact '
that we are in no way prompted by
| selfish motives, but only by that I

great sense of responsibility that is
inbred in all of us. We trust that
our action will serve as a stimulus
to the formation of other like units,
thus furthering this splendid move
ment toward a better international
understanding.

$8.50 vs. $10
The Editor, Sir:
1 lie point taken in this morning's
editorial concerning orchestras and
prices for the Junior Prom and the
Senior Ball was one which touches
a sore spot with a good many seniors
and particularly with me.
Why is It that the juniors have
an opportunity to receive the serv
ices of a first-class orchestra and can
do it for $.5.75 while the seniors are
asked to pay $10 for the same privi
lege witli no assurance that they may
gi't a first-class orchestra?
The seniors last year had a good
orchestra and a good ball for $7.50.
Is there any reason why the present

senior class with more members
should not have one thus year for its
little as $8.50. God knows that's
hiyh enough, but $10 is just too
much. â€¢
While on the subject of finances,
may I ask why we should be ex
pected to pay senior dues? What do
we receive for this extra outlay of
money other than the privilege to
buy a senior ball bid?
