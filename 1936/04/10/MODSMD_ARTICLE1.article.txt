### 
With all its novel concessions and
unusual prizes, the long-awaited

because of conflicting living group
dances, the Carnival was set for

merly an annual affair, it had to be
re-established by the present
sophomore class.

Main feature of the entertainment
offered by the sophomores tomorrow
night is taxi-dancing to the music of
Charlie Horton's orchestra from 8
to 12. One-half of the Pavilion will
be roped off for the ten-cents-a
dancers.
Tlie other side of the Pavilion will
be lined with booths, giving Stan
ford roughs and co-eds a chance to
prove their skill and to win original
prizes. Live ducks are offered to
those who can ring their necks by
one of the eating clubs.
The Sigma Chis are giving free
cigarettes to anyone who can sit on
a barrel, pick up a cigarette and a
match and successfully light the
cigarette. Chances on a $28 radio
arc being sold by the A.T.O.'s.
Pledges Are Targets
Any secret pet hates against Theta
Xi or Fiji pledges may be settled in
the fraternities' ducking and pie
throwing booths, where the pledges
are the targets. Regular race-track
betting can be carried on at the
turtle- and rat-racing booths, both
run on a pari-mutuel basis.
Taffy apples, popcorn, pink lem
onade, and doughnut booths will be
set up, as well as regular carnival
concessions such as ping-pone,
bingo, nail-pounding, basketball
throwing, penny-toss, bowling, and
hitting the milk bottle. The Breakers
are giving hay rides on the R.O.T.C.
nags and the A.K.L.'s will record
your voice singing your favorite
tune.
Booths Constructed
A1 Oddie and his construction
committee are making the booths
this afternoon in the Pavilion and
all living groups who have planned
concessions must get their necessary
paraphernalia in them tomorrow
morning.
The whole carnival has been
planned by a committee of sopho
mores, headed by Bob Mcßoskey,
and an advisory committee of Cardi
nals. Mcßoskey said, "We want to
prove that the Class of '38 really
can revive the Soph Carnival suc
cessfully."

are the targets. Regular race-track
betting can be carried on at the
turtle- and rat-racing booths, both
run on a pari-mutuel basis.
Taffy apples, popcorn, pink lem
onade, and doughnut booths will be
set up, as well as regular carnival
concessions such as ping-pone,
bingo, nail-pounding, basketball
throwing, penny-toss, bowling, and
hitting the milk bottle. The Breakers
are giving hay rides on the R.O.T.C.
nags and the A.K.L.'s will record
your voice singing your favorite
tune.
Booths Constructed
A1 Oddie and his construction
committee are making the booths
this afternoon in the Pavilion and
all living groups who have planned
concessions must get their necessary
paraphernalia in them tomorrow
morning.
The whole carnival has been
planned by a committee of sopho
mores, headed by Bob Mcßoskey,
and an advisory committee of Cardi
nals. Mcßoskey said, "We want to
prove that the Class of '38 really
can revive the Soph Carnival suc
cessfully."
With all its novel concessions and
unusual prizes, the long-awaited
Sophomore Carnival starts tomor
row night at 8 o'clock in the Pa
vilion. Postponed from last quarter
because of conflicting living group
dances, the Carnival was set for
April 11, which became a closed
date.
Tomorrow's Carnival will be the
first one held for two years. For
merly an annual affair, it had to be
re-established by the present
sophomore class.
Frizes Are Novel
Main feature of the entertainment
offered by the sophomores tomorrow
night is taxi-dancing to the music of
Charlie Horton's orchestra from 8
to 12. One-half of the Pavilion will
be roped off for the ten-cents-a
dancers.
Tlie other side of the Pavilion will
be lined with booths, giving Stan
ford roughs and co-eds a chance to
prove their skill and to win original
prizes. Live ducks are offered to
those who can ring their necks by
one of the eating clubs.
The Sigma Chis are giving free
cigarettes to anyone who can sit on
a barrel, pick up a cigarette and a
match and successfully light the
cigarette. Chances on a $28 radio
arc being sold by the A.T.O.'s.
Pledges Are Targets
Any secret pet hates against Theta
Xi or Fiji pledges may be settled in
the fraternities' ducking and pie
throwing booths, where the pledges
are the targets. Regular race-track
betting can be carried on at the
turtle- and rat-racing booths, both
run on a pari-mutuel basis.
