# Council Heads Plan Second Panel On Code
## Holloway Declares Honor Code Work Unfinished; Roth Has New Proposal 
### 
Plans for a second all-University
panel discussion on the Honor Code
controversy were announced last
night, as Men's and Women's Coun
cil executives renewed investigation
of the problem, using results of the
student-faculty meeting Wednesday
night as a basis.
Gib Holloway, chairman of the
men's judicial group, said, "The last
panel was highly informative, in
teresting. and helpful.
Question Unsettled
"However, we feel that there is
still a great deal to discuss anent the
Honor System at Stanford. For this
reason, we believe that another pan
el, dealing with possible solutions to
our difficulties, is in order," he de
clared.
Officials listed the following points
for particular consideration in the
second panel:
1. Techniques which students
will definitely be willing to use to
bring pressure upon others who vio
late principles of the Honor Code in
academic work.
2. Whether a violator should be
automatically suspended, In accord
ance with a measure approved in
1931, or whether penalties such as
added units or automatic failures
are better.
3. Means of building faculty con
fidence in students and in the stu
dent councils regarding their ability
to effectively uphold the Code.
Roth Suggests
Another proposal, made by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth, which will
receive emphasis is that of provid
ing "Honor System education or
guidance" for all freshmen and
transfer students.
Professor John McClelland of the
English department announced the
preparation of a mimeographed
paper containing definition of mis
conduct in composition work. The
paper will be distributed among
students in the department next
week.
Councils' officials confirmed the
i report that they will contact mem
r'bers of the faculty, during their sur
vey, to determine the advisability of
drawing up other standard prin
ciples on the English department's
| pattern.
