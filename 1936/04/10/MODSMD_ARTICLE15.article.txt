# Indians Meet Bruin Trackmen Tomorrow; Cranston Ineligible
## Cards Face Bruins Minus Star 440 Man; Marty, Eastman ,Dunn to Show 
### Phil Klauber 
Although still conceded an eds?e j
in tomorrow's dual meet with
U.C.L.A., Dink Templeton's varsity
tracksters will enter the field with ,
sorry faccs, as it was learned yes- j
terday that A1 Cranston, stellar \
quarter miler, has run his last for
Stanford.
Cranston was declared ineligible
in a communication from Professor
H. C. Willett of U.S.C., Pacific Coast
Conference eligibility guardian. The
charge is that Cranston, who trans
ferred from Pomona, a four-year
college, competed unattached in a
mile relay team at Santa Barbara in
1934, and thus lost a year of com
petition, ending his Stanford career
last season.
Loss Irreparable
Al's loss will be irreparable to this
year's relay team, and won't do the
Card 440 strength any good. Pun
ning principally with his shoulders,
he is a 49-second man any day of
the week, and ran on last year's
3:14.5 relay team.
Meanwhile, Templeton, in work
ing clothes for the first time in
months, put the Indian squad
through last preparations for the
Bruin affair, which starts at 2:15.
Entries in each event will be limited
to two from each team, and elimina
tions were held yesterday in several
questionable events. A light work
out is planned for today.
Eastman, Marty May Enter
A good chance that Ben Eastrfian,
Walter Marty, and Gordy Dunn will
compete unattached here tomorrow
was voiced after the Olympic Club
team entry was scratched due to a
contract with San Jose State which
is binding upon Charley Hunter's
forces. Several Stanford men may
compete unattached in white shirts
for the practice, if Coach Harry
Trotter of the Bruins does not object.
So there it is. Sam McDonald has
erected more seats; come on out
and see the fun, which should in
clude:
Some good sprint times from Dean
and Kneubuhl (S) who have been
practicing together to beat each oth
er out.
A good half-mile race, amongst
Co-captain Murphy and Young of
the Bruins and Malott and McCurdy
(S), all of 1:57 caliber at present
writing.
Nimmo, Dixon Warned
Nimmo and Dixon (S) running a
mile pretty fast, under penalty of
being entered at 2 miles in their
next start, if they fail. â€ž
Co-captains Massey tjind Valentine
of the Bruins tying for a win in the
pole vault; Bruin Carlin winning
, the javelin from the crippled Stan
ford team of Wally Hardin, Grant
Stone, and Jack Carlson.
Marumoto of the Bruins winning
the broad jump; Stanford's George
Tharp is out of the meet with a
muscle spasm or something. A good
mark in the high jump, with Hum
Smith leading a lot of prospectively
unattached Stanford jumpers.
Stanford scoring 80 points.
