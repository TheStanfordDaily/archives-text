# Marx, Retiring Professor, Is Better at Camping than Billiards
## 
### Jim Hurst 
A professor's first duty is to his
students, that they may get the most
from their university education. This
is the unusual principle which has
guided Professor Guido H. Marx,
who will retire in June, through 41
years of teaching at Stanford.
That a true teacher subordinates
his career and research to the heeds
of his students, striving to awaken
their intellectual curiosity, has been
his first axiom of instruction. Testi
mony to the sincerity of his efforts
is found in the unfailing apprecia
tion of his former pupils.
Teaches Winners
The fact that more of Professor
Marx's student have won student
and junior prize awards of the
American Society ol' Mechanical
Engineers than students of any other
single instructor or from any other
single institution is perhaps more
authoritative evidence of the suc
cessful teaching methods of Stan
ford's professor of machine design.
Social functions of the engineer
have always been of great concern
to Professor Marx; he was one of
the first to recognize the need of
training outside of the technical

, fields for engineers.
No Preacher
No mere preacher of principles, he

, has spent a great part of his time
; outside the University dealing with
| problems of society. He served for
i several years on the Palo Alto
| School Board, pioneered in endeav
oring to improve the economic status
of the college professor, served as
consulting engineer for a number of
California cities including Palo
I Alto.
lie has been active in political
groups, is chairman of the Public
Utilities Section of the California
| Commonwealth Club of San Fran
cisco, and has been named a mem
ber of the Third World Power Con
ference to be held in Washington
| this year.
Played Outfield
Having been an outfielder on the
| faculty baseball team of prehistoric
j days, he admits he is now merely a
i punk billiard player, a slightly-less
punk bridge player, claims to be a
! good camp cook. His summers are
| spent at his self-engineered shack
j which he put up in 1913 at Fallen
j Leaf.
"What will I do now?" he muses.
"I can't decide whether to run for
; congress or to write the secret his-
I tory of Stanford."

Professor Guido 11. Marx
llis Billiards Arc Poor
A professor's first duty is to his
students, that they may get the most
from their university education. This
is the unusual principle which has
guided Professor Guido H. Marx,
who will retire in June, through 41
years of teaching at Stanford.
That a true teacher subordinates
his career and research to the heeds
of his students, striving to awaken
their intellectual curiosity, has been
his first axiom of instruction. Testi
mony to the sincerity of his efforts
is found in the unfailing apprecia
tion of his former pupils.
Teaches Winners
The fact that more of Professor
Marx's student have won student
and junior prize awards of the
American Society ol' Mechanical
Engineers than students of any other
single instructor or from any other
single institution is perhaps more
authoritative evidence of the suc
cessful teaching methods of Stan
ford's professor of machine design.
Social functions of the engineer
have always been of great concern
to Professor Marx; he was one of
the first to recognize the need of
training outside of the technical

, fields for engineers.
No Preacher
No mere preacher of principles, he

, has spent a great part of his time
; outside the University dealing with
| problems of society. He served for
i several years on the Palo Alto
| School Board, pioneered in endeav
oring to improve the economic status
of the college professor, served as
consulting engineer for a number of
California cities including Palo
I Alto.
lie has been active in political
groups, is chairman of the Public
Utilities Section of the California
| Commonwealth Club of San Fran
cisco, and has been named a mem
ber of the Third World Power Con
ference to be held in Washington
| this year.
Played Outfield
Having been an outfielder on the
| faculty baseball team of prehistoric
j days, he admits he is now merely a
i punk billiard player, a slightly-less
punk bridge player, claims to be a
! good camp cook. His summers are
