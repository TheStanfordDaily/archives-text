# Masque Ball King-Queen Race Opens
## Ten Signatures Constitute Nomination; Free Votes To Students Wednesday 
### 
Ten signatures will start your
favorite beauty or pretty boy on her
or his way to Queen or King of the
annual Masque Ball April 24.
Nominations will be accepted from
today until Tuesday noon either
through committee members or the
A.S.S.U. oflice, Chairman Jim
"Captain Bligh" Ludlam an
nounced.
Waltinan Favored
Mentioned as a favorite in this
year's contest is Bill Waltman, man
behind-the-scenes of last year's
contest, who knows all the angles of
election and bids for a corner on
much of the campus cash.
Yesterday's announcement that
lankics would be subsidized brought
a howl of protest from some quar
ters, out of which arose the proba
bility that Fred "Honey" Borden
would go for the middle-sized vote
as a compromise candidate.
Dcy To Kun
The dark horse department offers
Ben "Happy" Dey, while the wet
platform has come out in support of
Jim "Moonshine" Mullen. Virility
will be represented by Barney
"Gorilla" Vierling, if you like viril
ity.
Ludlam, with his ear to the
ground, was sounding out prospec
tive candidates. "Any good Toros
for King?" lie asked Jan North, who
had just favorably reported the
D.G.-Toro fest.
Report Uncertain
"Well, I was only with them for
one evening," Jan retorted, "and I
didn't get to know any of them very
well.' The episode led to a rumor
that the Toro's gesticulating prize,
Jim Ransohoff, will be among the
royal candidates.
Early returns on the queens pros
pective indicate that leaders in the
nominations will include Bette
' Easy' Going, Liz "Cambodia"
Ehrens, and Joan "I'm the Top"
Brandel.
Pi I'hi's Silent
Alpha Phi assertedly plans to rely
on reflected glory from their dow
ager queen of last year's ball, while
Pi Phi "made no statement" as to
intentions, although opinion was that
the ball monopolists of other years
may be planing to ring in a ringer
towards the close of nominations.
Each student will get a free vote
next Wednesday; after that, voters
must support their candidates with
actual dollars and cents.
