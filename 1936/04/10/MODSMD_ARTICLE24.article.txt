JOURNALISES far and wide J
have condemned the Ethiopian war
as "the biggest flop in journalism
history becau.se they never saw a
real battle. From that point of view,
wars like the World War and the
Spanish - American War were
-great."
Laurence Stallings of Fox Movie
tone News feels that he wasted six
months of his life by going to
Ethiopia. He was in charge of seven
crews of cameramen and sound
-11 in k men and left Ethiopia as soon
as he sensed that the full news
value of the war had been exploited.

STA LLINGS is taking things
easy at his North Carolina country
home. He tells how the Italians were I
more co-operative than the Ethiop
ians. The blacks laid heavy restric- i
lions on the photographic jyork and
limited correspondents to but 100
words a day. "They were afraid [
someone might tell the truth about
Abyssiniaâ€”one of the most dismal I
places I have ever seen."
Difficulties of all sorts were en- .
countered by his outfit in getting |
the pictures out of the country.
They employed couriers, camels and
lit'planes. Remember those pictures ,
of the bombing of Adessa? Well,
ihose shots cost the company $4000
a) transport to Paris.

WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE, the
:>age of Emporia, believes, "The
ind of men and women which the
c.olleges are turning out today is
nitty poor stuff."
The man who wrote, "What's the
latter with Kansas?" has little faith
i us. The Orientals have the right '
lea, he believes, because they are |
giving their lives where they think
i will count." He feels that we, j
i allege students, view university 1
i. jurses as a training school for sue- |
i. ?ss and urges that Christian col
-1 ges be given more support so that
ley might set up another type of
lucation along standards differing
l . om those employed today."
I leave it to you whether White
lould retain his title of "sage."

THE ROOSEVELT REACTION is
strong one. People with the ut
. lost faith in the man cannot get
- ver the amount of money that the 1
. dministration is spending.
As time goes on and thinking !
I eople get fed up with do-nothing j
republicans and wasteful Demo
< .ats, they will become convinced
i lat a nation lives and prospers in
:>ite of its government and not be- j
Rise of its government.
If Roosevelt will do an about face j
.id balance the budget during his I
! cxt term, he'll ruin his party. If
1 e doesn't balance the budget, God
i elp us because the Republicans,
light get back in. Republicans are
ying to make Americans believe
iat there is nothing so important as ;
! alancing the budget, and so, if it !
n't balanced in the next four 1
\ 3ars, and Americans are so con
duced. in they come, automatically. :
One thing is clear. People who j
ke their politics seriously are to '
I 3 pitied.
