# DISPUTES GRAY MATTER

The Editor, Sir:
After reading Mr. Creveling's
statement in the Daily concerning
the origin of the Veterans of Future
War, I wish to correct him on one
or two minor points.
The V.t'.W., although organized
at Princeton, was not their original
idea. It was the brain-child of W.
A. Gallemore and W. C. Walther,
of Juneau, not Nome, Alaska. These
so-called "monkeys" had no inten
tion of starting a nation-wide or
ganization when they wrote their
letter to "Time," which was pub
lished in the February 17 issue, tell
ing of the idea which occurred to
them on one of Mr. Creveling's
"black polar nights."
Perhaps all this business is a
little absurd, but I believe there is
some truth in Anna Eleanor Roose
velt's statement concerning the
V.F.W. that, "These young people
have a grand weapon."
