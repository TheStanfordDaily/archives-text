# DEFENDS BALL PRICE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For many years the price of the
Senior Ball bids was $10; during the
last three years the traditional qual
ity of this dance has been lowered
to permit the bids to sell at a lower
price. The Class of 1936 Senior Ball
Committee desires to know whether
the majority of the seniors want to
pay $8.50 for the dance, or pay $10
for a dance that will be as good as
any of the Senior Balls of the past.
Contrary to the opinion expressed |
in Wednesday's editorial, the dif
ference between an $8.50 dance and
a $10 dance does not depend alone
on whether a local or a nationally
famous orchestra is hired. A $10 bid
would not only permit the hiring of
a better orchestra, but would also
make it possible to include many
desirable featux'es that would not be
feasible for $8.50.
A 10 per cent Federal tax places
an additional burden on this year's
budget that did not exist in pre- !
vious years. This tax is to be in
cluded in the price of the bid.
Those who compare the Senior
Ball with the Junior Prom fail to
take into consideration the fact that
an orchestra for the Senior Ball
must play until 4 o'clock in the
morning; that two dance floors are
used; that breakfast is served fol
lowing the dance; that double the j
number of police are required; that
twice as many refreshments are j
needed; and that favors are given '
