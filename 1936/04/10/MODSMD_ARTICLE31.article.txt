# D.G.'s, Toros Break Bread
## Elusive Asparagus Stumps Men 
### a D. G 
Chicken—apple pie a la mode—
no bread throwing—all combined to
make last night's dinner outstand
ing by any standards.
But there was a drawback. Was
it the Toros who threw stink bombs,
or was it another club? And do
they do it every night, or was this
a special event? The Deegees won
der.
The Toros lived up to the occa
sion by serving both soup and salad,
and both dessert and fruit. The
food, the company, and the idea
were all very good, concur the Dee
gees. But the atmosphere? No!
each couple.
