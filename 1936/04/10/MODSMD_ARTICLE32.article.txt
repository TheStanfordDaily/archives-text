# BITTER PILLS
## 
### a Toro 
The Editor, Sir:
As an anepdote for "cases" of j
spring fever(?) I suggest the "Hos- \
pital Boys" do some imbibing of !
the spirit and ideals of their glori- J
ous profession. »
War means physical and mental J
suffering for humanity. The profes- |
sion of medicine ever strives toward
their prevention and cure.
Jesting blatantly about mankind's
infirmities present or future is "un- \
medical" even for freshmen med
ical students.
Rough, '35
The sun each year expends j
enough heat on the earth to melt a
terrestrial layer of ice 424 feet thick, i

El Toro's invading group of ex- j
i change-diners dispelled all rumors j
' of "the bull in the china shop" j
when their conquest of the Delta
Gamma house ended with nothing
[ bi'oken.
, Faring much better than the
brother bulls who remained behind
to cope with the stink bomb Break
ers' bores, the visiting group tucked
: away a mighty fine meal and topped
things off with a round of dancing.
The only slip-up of the evening
j came when the inconsiderate Dee
gees served the asparagus in a dish
1 instead of on the individual plates,
and consequently the none too dex- '
trous Toros made several slips twixt j
dish and plate.
Midst the dancing a Deegee and a
! Toro were seen stealthily climbing
the stairs. Another pair followed to
j watch the first, a third team as- |
j cended to chaperone the second
| pair, and so on, until the bulls had
j inspected every nook and cranny
i of the most spacious house.
The first to enter the Deegee j
| sleeping porch were startled to see |
I the figure of a MAN lying on the !
bed. But it was only a dummy— 1
I dammit. * \
