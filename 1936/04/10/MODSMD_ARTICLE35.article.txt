Now that the hue and cry over il
legal rushing has died down, Pan-
Hellenic's revamping of the rush
ing system seems to be at a stand
still. During the time that Inter
fraternity Council has completed a
new set of rules and is all ready to
go, come autumn quarter, Pan
liellenic is still awaiting the return
of its alumnae president from the
East.
Such a reorganization should take
place while last quarter's fiasco di
clearly in mind, while the Row can
still remember the strain of the in
vestigation and the freshmen the in
convenience of delayed pledging.
The rushing system should prove
a fertile field for the introduction of
i r. effective Honor System. If each
hu use would trust the others to be
above board in rushing, as they
trust each other in scholastic mat
ters, Stanford would pretty nearly
be a Utopia.
There could be closer contact be
tween Roble and Row, even before
actual rushing starts, and a frosh
could really get to know a house
before she decides to spend her next
three years there, and vice versa.
She would not be faced with para
dox of an Honor Code in force as
regards her academic work, but
which is openly violated by older
sorority women who should set an
example.

Women transfers, it seems, feel
that they are not getting a break at
Stanford, as far as social life and
activities are concerned. Socially,
their complaint is certainly justified.
Placed in living groups where the
majority of women have made their
men friends as freshmen while at
Roble, they are decidedly at a dis
advantage.
It is up to these living groups to
see that their transfers are properly
introduced to campus social life, in
order that they have a chance to get
around. The men too could do their
parts, by showing attention to the
beauties from Podunk J.C.
A consideration of the roster of
activities' big shots will show that
transfers of the right calibre can get
ahead. Peg Schaeffer and Pat Fla
vel, this year's Women's Council
chairmen, Sue Clarke, Lagunita
ho'td, are all transfers. Roble
Presidents lone Collins and Virginia
Rooney, Head Sponsor Joyce Dunk
erley, did not start at Stanford as
freshmen, but all made the grade.
If transfers have the right stuff, it
can be done.
