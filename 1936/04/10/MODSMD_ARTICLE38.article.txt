Kidnapping, sky-writing, hair- j
pulling and other features of the [
Masque Ball queen contests of the :
past are excitedly recalled as this
year's ball draws near.
Nancy "Fancy" Pettigrew, last \
year's "Night in Egypt" queen, had !
to cope with a sky-writing rival, |
Helen Ramming, and barely fini.shed
in the lead.
Then there is the sad tale of '
Eleanor "Hey-Hey" Harris, abducted '
queen of 1934's Masque Ball. Her !
mysterious disappearance the;
morning of the great event caused j
tense excitement until her kid- j
nappers finally took pity and re- j
leased her just in time to be
crowned.
"Mr. and Miss Bratchberry" was )
the title taken by two contestants for j
king and queen in 1933. Their (
identity was kept a secret until the j
end of the contest, when their vie- i
tory disclosed Rose Cubbison as the i
winning queen.
