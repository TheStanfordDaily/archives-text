## 
### 

ROW AND HALL WILL FROLIC together
tomorrow night in the Pavilion at the Soph
Carnival, scenes from which are shown here.
Above: Don Douglas is aiming a piece of
pie at the head of his brother Fiji, John
Wickctt, whose head is protruding through
the sheet.
Right, above: Dolly Kohnke, Delta Gamma,
is trying her skill on the Sigma Chi barrel
concession, (he central idea of which is to
sit on the barrel, pick up a cigarette with one
hand, a match with the other, and then light
the smoke without rolling off. Jan North, an
other D.G., and Bill Moses, Delta Chi, are
looking on.
Right: Alan Palmer, El Capitan, is dis
playing ducks which will be given to those
who can ring their necks with hoops in this
concession.
