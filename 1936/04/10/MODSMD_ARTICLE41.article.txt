## VOLLEYBALL CRAZE SWEEPS CAMPUS 
### 
With 15 teams already signed up i
to play in the intramural volleyball j
tournament, it begins to look like 1
the sport really has taken the cam- i
pus by storm. Marie Manchee, fac- |
ulty advisor on intramurals, claims j
that this tournament looks to be
even more popular than the basket
ball one was last quarter.
Martha Jane Knecht is taking
charge of the affair and together j
with Miss Manchee and Frances
Strong, intramural head, is making
out the schedule. The games will be I
played on the two new volleyball I
courts erected next io the women's
swimming pool.

According to Miss Manchee the j
teams will be placed in various divi- \
sions and the tournament run off in
round-robin fashion. Games start at
5 o'clock Wednesday and both
courts will be in use.
The Row, in particular, displays j
the trend toward volleyball, for each j
sorority has entered a team and the j
Kappa pledges have their own
group. Roble has several teams and j
Lagunita at present has one.

Gertrude Hawley's and Sherman
Lockwood's advanced tennis classes
have started competition in the an- '
nual W.A.A. ladder tournament
which will continue throughout the
quarter.
"Five matches must be played be
fore May 18," announced Miss
Hawley, ''in order to qualify for the
elimination tournament which will
determine the University cham
pion."
After May 18 the first 16 players
on the ladder comprise the all-star [
team and are eligible to compete for I

the University championship. The
final matches usually take place on
Field Day, early in June. Betty
Pearce, head of tennis, won the title
last year and holds the W.A.A. ten
nis cup.
Each Thui'sday class period is de
voted to tournament play and a rec
ord of the match and the score must
be kept by the players.

Though there is a dearth of jun
ior and senior baseball players at
present, there are enough freshmen
and sophomores to fill any vacan
cies on the upperclassman teams.
In this way, Ruth Schmidt, base
ball head, promises that there will
be four teams as usual entered in
interclass competition. Next week
the schedule for the feminine Tigers,
Yanks, Cards, and Giants will be
announced. —Jane Heenan

The number of lockouts appearing
before Women's Council in the
spring quarter is nearly twice as
great as in any other quarter. The
reason for this is merely that the
fourth lockout received during the
entire year is sent then.

ANNUAL W.A.A. TENNIS
LADDER TOURNAMENT STARTS

According to Miss Manchee the j
teams will be placed in various divi- \
sions and the tournament run off in
round-robin fashion. Games start at
5 o'clock Wednesday and both
courts will be in use.
The Row, in particular, displays j
the trend toward volleyball, for each j
sorority has entered a team and the j
Kappa pledges have their own
group. Roble has several teams and j
Lagunita at present has one.

Gertrude Hawley's and Sherman
Lockwood's advanced tennis classes
have started competition in the an- '
nual W.A.A. ladder tournament
which will continue throughout the
quarter.
"Five matches must be played be
fore May 18," announced Miss
Hawley, ''in order to qualify for the
elimination tournament which will
determine the University cham
pion."
After May 18 the first 16 players
on the ladder comprise the all-star [
team and are eligible to compete for I

the University championship. The
final matches usually take place on
Field Day, early in June. Betty
Pearce, head of tennis, won the title
last year and holds the W.A.A. ten
nis cup.
Each Thui'sday class period is de
voted to tournament play and a rec
ord of the match and the score must
be kept by the players.

Though there is a dearth of jun
ior and senior baseball players at
present, there are enough freshmen
and sophomores to fill any vacan
cies on the upperclassman teams.
In this way, Ruth Schmidt, base
ball head, promises that there will
be four teams as usual entered in
interclass competition. Next week
the schedule for the feminine Tigers,
Yanks, Cards, and Giants will be
announced. —Jane Heenan

The number of lockouts appearing
before Women's Council in the
spring quarter is nearly twice as
great as in any other quarter. The
reason for this is merely that the
fourth lockout received during the
entire year is sent then.
With 15 teams already signed up i
to play in the intramural volleyball j
tournament, it begins to look like 1
the sport really has taken the cam- i
pus by storm. Marie Manchee, fac- |
ulty advisor on intramurals, claims j
that this tournament looks to be
even more popular than the basket
ball one was last quarter.
Martha Jane Knecht is taking
charge of the affair and together j
with Miss Manchee and Frances
Strong, intramural head, is making
out the schedule. The games will be I
played on the two new volleyball I
courts erected next io the women's
swimming pool.
