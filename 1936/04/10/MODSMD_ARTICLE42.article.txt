# More Women—--Less Culture, Says Bailey
## 
### Ruth Goodan 
"When the doors were flung wide
open," declares Dr. Margery Bailey,
English professor, "Stanford was
just recovering from a raw, crude
stage and beginning to respect ideals
of culture—now we are flooded with
masses of undisciplined students.
Naturally campus life is gayer and
more cheerful with the advent of
more women. However, in the ef
fort of students to have a good
time, their interests in drama, good
books, and music has been griev
ously neglected."
Dr. Bailey believes that the cul
tural life of the campus should cen
ter in the drama group. "The New
Theater will be useless," she claims,
"unless it becomes a school. Dr.
Uhler, who will lead dramatic ac
tivities this summer, has had expe
rience on the professional stage and

shows a lively interest in modern as !
well as classical drama. Now, if j
ever, is our opportunity to begin a J
Theater School."
Dr. Bailey's interest in the theater !
began at the age of six. She has
never been stage-struck and has
always had a "mania for good act- :
ing." She took many important
roles here at Stanford, and assisted i
in the direction of the Shakespeare j
Guild of America in the 1934-35 !
tour.
This summer Dr. Bailey will assist
in the dramatic activities. She hopes \
that the theater will once again be
the center of cultivated life, that !
those students who are in the habit
of relegating poetry and good drama !
to the English Corner will start 1
Stanford once again on a career of \
thoughtful interest in artistic en- i
deavor.
