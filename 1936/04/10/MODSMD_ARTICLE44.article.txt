# Pan-Hell Sets Dates For Row Initiations
## 
### 
May 9 and 10 have been set by
Pan-Hellenic Council as the dates
for the initiation of women pledges
last January.
Those women pledged by houses
whose rushing was postponed may
not be initiated until the beginning
of fall quarter, the Council ruled.
Further considerations of new plans
for rushing and pledging await the
return of Mrs. Walter Bingham,
president of sorority alumnae, who
is at present on a trip.
