# Alumni Propose Local Meetings
## Plan Annual Conclaves For Founders Day 
### 
Arrangements for one alumni
meeting to be held each year in each
locality for a complete discussion of
the "state of the University" are part
of the five-year plan outlined at a
recent Alumni Council meeting, ac
cording to Secretary Harlow Ro- j
thert.
These discussions would involve I
such subjects as the University, |
trustees, administration, students, I
athletics, and alumni. The most ap- I
propriate time for the meetings, the i
Council suggested in outlining the |
plan, would be Founders' Day.
In connection with the drive to
increase alumni membership, the
Council suggested the use of $1,500
to $3,000 of the reserve funds for a 1
campaign to concentrate on the
10.000 non-member alumni who have
been contacted by Stanford Asso- i
ciates. The increased membership
is desirable for the advancement of i
the Illustrated Review and the schol- i
arship funds, and for the increased 1
work of the Alumni Association.
