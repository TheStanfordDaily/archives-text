### 
. . . OR WHY TRACK
COACHES GET GRAY

If it isn't on? thing it's another—
or so the old aphorism goes.
And doesn't Dink Templeton
know it. Poor Robert Lyman. Heavy
heavy hangs over his be-stetsoned
head all of the time.
His track team seems, to him, at
least, to be made up of citizens more
temperamental than Mme. Jeritza
ever was. Either they aren't good
enough in the first place, or they
don't follow his tips on form, or
they won't work hard enough—yes,
the life of the track coach is truly
a sad one, an unhappy lot, a 1936
vale of tears.
Something always seems to be
wrong wilh that team, and when the
reform and recuperation are in view,
something else happens. So Dink is
in the constant state of flux, uncer
tain as to the whims of his ath
letes. Of course his teams have
copped a half-dozen national cham
pionships in the past decade, buf still
Dink can never be sure of anything.
Last fall, when the tracksters
signed up, there was a definite weak
ness in the splints, pole vault, and
broad jump. There is Dink's first
worry.

EVEN STEADY DISTANCE
MEN CAN WAVER

INJURIES. WHIMS
DOG DINK'S LIFE

He has Nimmo, Burrows. Dixon—
proven in the distances, and Mc-
Curdy, Mallott, Alexander, Burris,
Beman, D'Evelyn, and Dern with
varying degrees of promise. Every
thing will be fine in this department,
figures the smiling coach.
But things begin to go wrong even
in this outward prosperity. Burrows,
who ran 9.40 in January, has a hard
time finishing a practice two-mile.
Nimmo, who ran 1.56 in the half
and 9.37 in the two-mile, tries a 440
in practice and Dink shouts him out
when he runs the first 220 in 30
seconds flat. Dixon, last year win
ner over Bob Heavey in the Big
Meet mile, finds it an uphill buttle
to get into shape this spring. Bill
McCurdy runs a half in 1.57 one day,
can't break two minutes the next.
So it goes, the old seesaw, with
Templeton beaming with Beauty one
minute, scowling with the weight of
adversity the next.
Then there are the sprints; Kneu
buhl, Voigt, and Dean are all sprint
ters of the A-l variety, but why, oh
why, sighs Dink, don't they turn in
a good practice time for me. He
knows they are good, but they go on
turning in 10 fiat hundreds.

In the javelin he isn't sure wheth
er one of the boys will begin flip
ping the spear 200 feet or not. Sev
eral on the squad could start doing
that very thing at any time, too, but
now Kellogg and Hardin are tem
porarily disabled. And when, he
wonders, will Jim Reynolds, a prom
inent Olympics contender, get over
the effects of a spring vacation case
of flu.
The jumpers, Humbert Smith and
George Tharp, are always liable to
pull a tendon or something. Tharp,
crack track gagman and center of
much of the afternoon's by-play, is
out right now with a bad thigh
muscle.
Dink wants a winning track team
so bad that any one of these mis
haps hurts him like downing a meal
of old sweat-sox.
And so he goes on, directing his
team every afternoon at four, an
absolute monarch of his quarter
mile Angell Field domain, nattily
dressed on his throne, a green and
red collapsible sun-porch stool. Or
maybe it's a camp stool. If it isn't
one thing it's another. —Breed
