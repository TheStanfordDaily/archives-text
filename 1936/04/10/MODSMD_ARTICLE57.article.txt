# Indian Nine Opens Series At Cal Tomorrow
## Bears Favorites To Win; Weiershauser Is Likely Choice for Mound Duty 
### Dale Reimer 
Stanford baseballers will meat
their big test tomorrow afternoon
when they clash with the California
varsity in the first of the three-game
series which will determine Card-
Bear supremacy.
The game tomorrow, as well as the
second game of the series, to be
played a week later, will be at Ed
wards Field, Berkeley, while the
third tilt will occur here on April
25, the same day as the Big Meet.
Game time this Saturday will be
3:15 o'clock in order to allow spec
tators to see the Cal-U.C.L.A. track
meet first.
Hard Battle Expected
Although neither team is in the
running for the conference cham
pionship, the contest is expected to
be a bitter battle, with both teams
fighting to get a head start in the
traditional rivalry.
On the basis of conference rec
ords to date the Bears must be in
stalled favorites, as they have won
three games, one each from U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Santa Clara, while the
Cards' only mark in the win column
is a victory over the Broncos.
Show Improvement
Coach Harry Wolter's nine has
been showing improvement lately,
however, especially in the hitting
department, evidenced by the close
16-13 victory eked out by the Tro
jans Wednesday. With a good pitch
ing performance they may upsat the
dope.
Ray Weiershauser will probably
be chosen by Coach Harry Wolter to
carry the pitching burden against
the Bears tomorrow, with Leo
Heagerty catching.
The probable line-ups:
Stanford California
Killefer, If Archer, cf
Farrel, ss Porterfield, ss
