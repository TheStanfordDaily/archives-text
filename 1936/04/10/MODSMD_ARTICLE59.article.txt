# Coach Bunn Lauds Washington Five; New Rules Used
## 
### 
Coach John Bunn returned from
New York yesterday full of praise
for the flashy play of the Wash
ington five in the recent Olympic
eliminations. He said the Huskies
had the smoothest team in the con
test, and lacked only size for better
results.
He also indicated a strong national
trend in favor of the elimination of
the center jump, shown by a coach
es' questionnaire and sentiment at
the Rules Committee meeting.
