# Bear, Card Mermen Meet Tomorrow
## 
### Hunter Hendee 
California's strongest swimming
team since 1917 seeks vengeance for
18 straight defeats by Stanford mer
men—the longest wait ever en
dured by any athletic team of Bears
—tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock in
Encina pools.
From Cal's standpoint, whether or |
not her long famine of Big Meet
wins ends tomorrow depends pretty I
much on the performance of two of j
her tankmen, Captain Welden Smith j
and Jim Shields. The third Califor
nia ace, Jim Werson, will coast to !
an easy victory in the 200-yard 1
breast-stroke anywhere from 10 to
15 seconds ahead of the first Indian. (
Werson Important
However, Cal's chances in the
medley relay race will depend on
the lead Werson gives. It's that lead
that Henry Godman, swimming an
chor-man, will have to overcome if j
what may be the deciding event is 1
to go to the Cardinals.
Winning the 400-yard free-style
relay is imperative if Stanford is to
stretch her long list of wins. The
men on whose shoulders rest that :
burden are, as announced by Coach
Thornton: Martin Scatena, Alec
MacKenzie. Henry Godman, and 1
Jack Vibert.
Vibert Has Hard Day
Not only will Vibert, Stanford's ,
sophomore free-style sensation, have
to anchor the relay to victory, he
has to take the 100 and the 220. It !
so happens he takes on both of
California's sprint aces.
The Bears are counting on big
Jim Shield's taking the Stanford
sophomore just as whole-heartedly .
as the Indians are counting on their
man in the 100. After swimming
the relay and the 100, Vibert will
churn through 220 yards against
Smith.
Smith To Compete
Smith will be fresh, and if Vibert
isn't all winded out by 220 time, he
certainly will be when it's all over, i
Bob Walker, P.A. champion in the j
150-yard backstroke, and Captain !
Tom Boothe appear to be the only !
two "sure" Stanford events—"sure" \

| if any event can be certain in such
competition.
If Roy Siem of the Bears should
be allowed to swim, however, Stan
! ford's chances of winning the back
stroke would be a great deal less.
Because of the track meet in the
afternoon, this year's Big Meet will
I be swum off at 10 o'clock in the
morning. The California and Stan
-1 ford freshmen meet at Encina pools
j at the same time, their events al
ternating with the varsity's. Ad
j mission price to both meets is 25
; cents.
