# Tiny Plans Initial Scrimmage For Next Wednesday
## 
### 
Ending the second week of spring
practice, Tiny Thornhill will open up
and send his prospective 1936 Big
Red Machine through its first scrim
mage next Wednesday afternoon.
With many of the squad still in
dulging in other spring sports, the
fracas Wednesday should be rich in
the uncovering of promising new
material from frosh and jaysee
transfer ranks. The new men will
be given all the chance they need
to learn the system, as Thornhill is
planning light scrimmages daily
thereafter and short games each
Thursday.
Of coaches Bobby G/ayson and
Ben Winklemcn, Thornhill says,
"They are working right into the
scheme of things. Of course Bobby
is pretty familiar with our system
and I have had an opportunity to
teach it to Winkleman in several
summer coaching schools."
