## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Year's Third Conference Championship Goal as Track Season Opens Tomorrow 
### 
Olympic bound some of them at least
Stanford trackmen open their outdoor com
petitive season tomorrow, weather permit
ting.
Coach Dink Templeton remembers the time
when his squad annually produced Stanford's
only Pacific Coast Conference or national
championship.
This year, he faces the embarrassing possi
bility of being one of the few major sports
coaches at Stanford without a conference
crown as a souvenir of the 19.'5.) ,'{(> compe
tition.
Hut the cause, says Dink, is not lost yet.
If the Indians continue lo gain momentum
between now and the Conference meet as
rapidly as they have since they inauspiciously
began training last fall, Stanford may add a
track trophy lo those contributed by "the best
team on the Coast" in football and basketball,
respectively.
Many of the trackmen think they can win
the Big Meet, hut concede the S.C. meet and
Conference title to the Trojans. Dink, how
ever, casts covetous eyes at all three contests.
While the wishful thinkers among the
Farm's athletic-minded occupy themselves
with murmiirings about three major Confer
ence titles the sports coup d'etat of the dec
ade the (ireat Optimist points his guns at
Cal, 5.C,., the Conference, and even Berlin.
Dink, in the past, has had worse material
and come through; we hope his guns turn
out to he the cannons he thinks they are.
