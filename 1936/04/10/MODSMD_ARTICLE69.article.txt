(From the Daily Californian)
Speaking with a candor and humility that is re
freshing, a professor in the University stated last
Friday to his classes that he had been "trying for
thirty-five years to find a solution to the problem of
examinations."
And no answer had been found, it was indicated.
It is very probable that no answer ever will be
found until there is an efTort by the faculty to experi
ment with various other methods for testing the knowl
edge and thinking capacity of students.
If it is agreed that the present system of examina
tions is obstructing the work of higher education, then
there should be a definite eagerness on the part of
educators to revise that system.
* * * *
At the University of Chicago that revision is being
attempted. An experimental program of comprehen
sive examinations is being tried.
Those who formulated and arc carrying out the
"Chicago Plan" are apparently of the opinion that
higher education should not be interfered with by
frequent, unnecessary and distracting quizzes. In each
course there is one examination which is given at the
end of the semester and that examination is a compre
hensive one, that is, it covers the entire subject which
has been under consideration by the student and pro
fessor.
• * * *
Student:; are not coached with the aim of passing
regular two-week or monthly tests. All examinations
are prepared by a Board of Examiners. The function
of examining is not that of the professor.
The teacher is not the judge, or the accuser and
the student is not the petitioner for gracc. At Chicago,
the faculty administration is hoping to work out an
arrangement in which student and instructor are co
partners in the adventure of learning, with the pro
fessor enjoying ;t respect 1 hat is the result of his
superior knowledge and insight.
The "Chicago Plan" of comprehensive examinations
is frankly an experiment.
It seems to hp functioning exceedingly well.
At least at that institution there is some practical
endeavor to determine how the present examination
evils may be overcome.

The committee will undoubtedly he told of
traditional spring evenings under the stars
when choruses of male and female voices
Moated out over the Senior steps, the Campa
nile, or the Quadrangle.
Probably the Council will hear that such
"sings" started spontaneously, and developed
without prodding or forced encouragement
on the part of any sponsors.
And if the Council committee acts wisely,
as il has done in the matter of suggesting ex
change dinners, it will report to How leaders
that "sings" have possibilities of being one
of the most valuable and amusing phases of
the fellowship scheme.
Then it would be up to the houses, or the
hall groups for that matter, to furnish the
spark of enthusiasm which will start action.

It is very probable that no answer ever will be

edge and thinking capacity of students.
If it is agreed that the present system of examina

At the University of Chicago that revision is being
attempted. An experimental program of comprehen
sive examinations is being tried.
Those who formulated and arc carrying out the
"Chicago Plan" are apparently of the opinion that
higher education should not be interfered with by
frequent, unnecessary and distracting quizzes. In each
course there is one examination which is given at the
end of the semester and that examination is a compre
hensive one, that is, it covers the entire subject which
has been under consideration by the student and pro
fessor.

Student:; are not coached with the aim of passing
regular two-week or monthly tests. All examinations
are prepared by a Board of Examiners. The function
of examining is not that of the professor.
The teacher is not the judge, or the accuser and

the faculty administration is hoping to work out an

The "Chicago Plan" of comprehensive examinations
is frankly an experiment.

At least at that institution there is some practical
endeavor to determine how the present examination
evils may be overcome.

The committee will undoubtedly he told of
traditional spring evenings under the stars
when choruses of male and female voices
Moated out over the Senior steps, the Campa
nile, or the Quadrangle.
Probably the Council will hear that such
"sings" started spontaneously, and developed
without prodding or forced encouragement
on the part of any sponsors.
And if the Council committee acts wisely,
as il has done in the matter of suggesting ex
change dinners, it will report to How leaders
that "sings" have possibilities of being one
of the most valuable and amusing phases of
the fellowship scheme.
Then it would be up to the houses, or the
hall groups for that matter, to furnish the
spark of enthusiasm which will start action.
(From the Daily Californian)
Speaking with a candor and humility that is re

Friday to his classes that he had been "trying for
thirty-five years to find a solution to the problem of
examinations."
