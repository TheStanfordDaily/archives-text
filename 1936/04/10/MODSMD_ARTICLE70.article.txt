The Veterans of Future Wars, local One-
Eyed Connelly post, asks for wholehearted
support from the student body.
It is undoubtedly the most heart-warming
demonstration of sincere Stanfordism ever
seen on the Stanford campus.
It is gratifying that some 150 members are
now enrolled.
It is regrettable that more are not enrolled.
It is to be hoped that many more will soon
enroll. •
Stanford should have 3,<500 members. That
would bring $3,800,000 on the campus as soon
as the bonus bill now before Congress is
passed. That would bring joy to a tuition
note-holding Administration, black ink to the
Union's books, prosperity all up and down
the highway, and a dozen new houses up and
down the Row.
The very best people are joining the V.F.W.
Even the aspiring political candidates are en
tering the fold. Some of the very most influ
ential vote influencers are already in the fold.
It provides an invaluable mingling ground. It
all is commendable.
