## OARP FINALLY FALTERS 
### 
Nothing hampers a good, friendly
i race between an elephant and a
donkey as much as a pack of hyenas
yapping up and down the race track.

I They can't step
ion the hyenas;

gety. But they
I can get rid of
i them by starting
I a fight among
i them.
Nothing was

like the way their dime-a-month
dues had been spent, and their faith
was so shaken that they're drop

when the jack-pot is hit.

And as they drop, the (rue con
sistency of OARPers' intelligence is
laid open for inspection. You could
n't convince a Townsendite that his
plan was economically unsound. If
he'd listen to you, which was seldom,
he couldn't comprehend your rea

simple terms as: The $200 a month
pension plan couldn't possibly in
