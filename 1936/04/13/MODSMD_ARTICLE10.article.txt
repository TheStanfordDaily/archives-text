# Barnstormers Ask for Singers
## Male Choir Will Feature Mac Gordon Songs 
### 
Tryouts for the male choir, a spe
cial feature act of Barnstormers'
spring musical "Three Sheets to the
Wind," will be conducted from 4 to
5:30 o'clock this afternoon in the
downstairs lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse by John Shidler, choir
director.
This group, conceived in the style
of Waring's Pennsylvanians, will
sing a number of songs written es
pecially for them by Mac Gordon.
All men interested in singing and in
gaining experience in group work
are urged to try out.
Further tryouts for actors who
wish to take part in the show will be
held tomorrow afternoon from 3 to
5 o'clock in the committee room of
the Old Union. These interviews are
for all who were unable to apply
Friday.
Owing to the large cast required
by the show, no general tryouts will
be held, but small group tryouts will
be conducted later in the week so
that all applicants will be given full
opportunity to display their ability.
