## 
### 
David Lamson will "go into the ]
movies" not just to get a job, but
because motion pictures will give I
him a chance to tell "his story," he
declared yesterday. Lamson plans
to leave the Menlo Park home of his
sister, Dr. Margaret Lamson, Tues
day to start adapting his best-seller, ;
"We Who Are About To Die," for !
RKO.
"It's been my privilege to have an |
unusual experience, learning a lot
about what happens to ordinary '
people suddenly placed in the posi- I
tion of a social enemy. Working in i
Hollywood will be my way of justi- !
fying myself in the eyes of friends '
who helped me," he said.

enemies don't recognize me, for I
| haven't been slighted, so far as I
| know,"
Lamson took his daughter to the
circus, attends the Paly shows, and

lene and my evenings with friends;
the rest of the time I just live, and
that's ft great sensation."
