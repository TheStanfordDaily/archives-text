just part of the saga of 115 bucks—
a monetary romance with its full
share of mystery and comedy. It
starts like this:
Once on a time, before Stanford
became a big business necessarily
collecting money to be necessarily
spent, the student community had a
bankbook no fatter than need be,
and sometimes a little underweight.
Today the community is a pros
perous affair, with its own fund in
excess of $45,000 per quarter.
That is a big puddle of money,
but it is only the aggregate of
small droplets, 15000 droplets at $15
per.
First off, your health is insured
for five dollars. One-third of the
fee is an insurance premium, your
bet that you will get just sick
enough to go to the hospital but not
sick enough to run into the extra
charges for extraordinary hospital
treatment. The money goes into
the Student Hospital- Guild Fund
invested through the comptroller,
who stands ready to pay when sick
ness strikes. Four dollars of the
Palo Alto Hospitals' rate of $5 for a
place in a student ward is taken
care of by the fund.
One-third to Gyms
Another five dollars helps defray
operating charges of the men's and
women's gym exclusive of teaching
salaries, and to support health serv
ices for both sexes, including phys
icians' salaries and medical sup
plies.
One dollar goes to the Memorial
Theater Fund dispensed directly
through the accounting office—the
famous Theater Dollar added last
fall.
The Union Dollar — also fa
mous—is actually collected under
that name from both men and
women. But the women's dollar
goes to support the Women's
Clubhouse. It is the men's dollar
that goes to the Union, includ
ing all parts of that organization.
The books show two dollars going
to the A.S.S.U. for support of stu
dent activities not taken care of by
other divisions of the community
