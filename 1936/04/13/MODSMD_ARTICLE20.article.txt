# Cranston Ruling Protest Planned
## Locals Say Bush, Draper, Pollock Ineligible 
### 
Signs that the last chapter of the
ineligibility of A1 Cranston, Stanford
star quarter-miier, has not yet been
written are indicated in word that
several local but unofficial track en
thusiasts are formulating a protest to
be sent Professor H. C. Willett of
U.S.C., in charge of Pacific Coast
Conference eligibility.
Cranston was declared to have lost
a year of competition for running on
an unattached relay team in Santa
Barbara in 1934. The home guard is
compiling newspaper evidence of
similar violations by other Confer
ence track athletes, including Mushy
Pollock, Foy Draper, and Ross Bush.
The recent controversy and protest
are believed certain to result in ei
ther a clarification of the clause vio
lated, the reinstatement of Cranston,
or some wholesale disqualifications.
