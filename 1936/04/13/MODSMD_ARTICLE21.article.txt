# Toros Douse Rival Clubs; Stray Shot Brings Out Cops
## 
### 
Trying to drown their sorrow and
the El Campos and Breakers, after
the odorous D.G. exchange dinner
Thursday, El Toro men called forth
their humidity brigade and dunked
the two rival tongs Friday.
Despite the fact that it was all in
fun, a passing Econ professor, whose
car got in the way of one of the
several fire hoses and Toros playing
about the scene, called out the
militia.
Fearful of soil erosion, the dogs of
the law pulled the drain while the
reel sulk hose men dried their tears,
attempting some osmosis in the
bullrushes.
