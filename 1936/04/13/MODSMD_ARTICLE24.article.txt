# Cinder Squad Shows Power In Bruin Win
## Big Meet Victory Looms After 99 1/5-31 4/5 Score; Meet Troy Next 
### Phil Klauber 
It happened just as scheduled, ex
cept a little more definitely than
expected, when Coach Dink Temple
ton's varsity tracksters thumped
the U.C.L.A. Bruins 99 1-5 to 31 4-5
on Angell Field Saturday afternoon.
Showing good strength in nearly
every event, the Cards yielded but
three first places, swept two events,
and scored in every one. California
whipped Harry Trotter's men 97-34
in Los Angeles last week, and in
view of the whitewash across the
bay yesterday, everything points to
a very interesting and enlightening
Big Meet here April 25.
Smith Jumps 6-7'/i
Headliners for the U.C.L.A. after
noon were of course Humbert Smith
and Chuck Nimmo. Smith won the
high jump at 6-3, made 6-5 on his
fourth try, and then surprised him
self and everyone else by clearing
6-7'/i on his second jump. It was
a good clean leap, Smitty just
barely scratching the bar in his
flight, but the three misses at 6-5
keep the mark out of the summary.
Now 6-7 l A is considerable of a
jump for a white man; it is an inch
and a half higher than Smith h«d
ever gone before, and the Stanford
record is only 6-6%, set by Bob
King in 1928. Bob King was,
amongst other things, Olympic high
jump champion that year.
Nimmo Runs Fast Mile
Nimmo got into the fame column
by running his mile in 4:19.7, a hot
day, with no one within 50 yards to
press him. What he will do on his
best day no one can say, but they
are handicapping him number one
on the coast now. Skin Wilson's
Stanford mile record, set in 1914,
stands at 4:19.4.
Chuck Voigt was the upset man
of the day, in taking both sprints
from Ray Dean, who has already
proven to be a runner. Voigt started
fast, was able to retain a scant lead
at the finish in each at 9.9 and 21.6.
Weiershauser in 440 Win
Jack Weiershauser won the quar
ter in 48.5 from Douda of the Bruins,
while Truck Dellinger showed the
least effects of his muscle injury yet
this month in taking third. Both are
serving notice on Cal's Williams,
which is considerable of a notice.
Jack Carlson, in his first col
legiate competition, won an upset in
the javelin from Carlin of U.C.L.A.
at 180 feet. Wally Hardin has been
injured ,took third.
Klopstock Double Winner
Klopstock won both hurdle races,
but this gent Hunt Kingsbury, who
has been chasing him for years, was
but a foot behind in the highs, a
yard behind in the lows. Kingsbury
may beat the little champion any
day now.
Bruin victories were by Massey
and Valentine in the pole vault,
Baird in the broad jump, and Young
in the 880. Murphy, number 1
Bruin half-miler, has been under
the weather, is not back in shape.
