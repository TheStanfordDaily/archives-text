### Grays Creveting 
TO READER Jean Faulkner J
thanks for correction on Veteran of {
Future Wars origin by way of her j
letter in Vox Campi Friday. Gallen- j
more and Walther's letter to TIME |
appeared in the magazine's fort- j
nightly supplement LETTERS and
was the granddaddy, indeed, of the i
whole idea.
Reader Faulkner may remember |
that Gray Matter some time ago
(March) told of V.F.W.'s founding
in Alaska, along with the mention
of "Retire-at-Birtli Plan," and
ther absurdities.
PEOPLE CAN celebrate the new
year on January first, il they like,
but to me Easter is the beginning j
of the new year.
Nature's revival and the anniver- j
sary of Christ's resurrection are i
combined in one day of the year— j
Easter Sunday.
Everything starts anew. The
slate of one's life on which all of
the errors of the past year have
been written is wiped clean, and
you have a new chance. Start all j
over again, for yesterday the new j
year began.
ALLAN HOOVER has received
$4,800 in AAA benefits from the New 1
Deal. "I hold a minority interest in ]
the Greenfield ranch south of |
Bakersfield (California) and re- ;
ceivcd (the money) from the Agri
cultural Adjustment Administra
tion for payment under a cotton
agreement," he said.
Whether this fact is more embar
rassing to his father, the former
president and New Deal's strong
est opponent, than to the present ;
administration is difficult to deter- j
mine. But Herbert Hoover's young- |
est son is a farmer and as such re- !
t"jives benefits from the AAA.
The New Deal is certainly not J
playing politics in this case with its
AAA. Secretary 'Wallace is out
$4800 and has no vote to show for it.
My, my, what'll Boss Farley have to
say about this?
WE CIVILIANS wonder al people
who take R.O.T.C.
Are they brave? No, because they
.say to us, "We'll be behind the lines
directing operations while you guys
are up in the trenches being slaugh
tered. We feed you to the cannons
and remain whole ourselves. We
live to receive the glory, while you
die to receive the worms."
Are R.O.T.C. men yellow or
smart, therefore? Maybe they are
both!
ASK ANY of your contemporaries
what they would do if they knew
war to be declared next week.
Ninety per cent wouid tell you that
they would hie themselves up into
the north woods and eat berries.
The other 10 per cent would let their
best girl shoot off one of their toes.
But should a drum and bugle
corps boom down the street shaking
buildings with its roar, many a man's
hair would stand on end, and the
First Volunteer Infantry would be
manned in no time.
I>R. GEORGE GALLUP'S Insti
tute of Public Opinion statistics this
month show that 12 states with elec
toral votes of totaling 150 are Re
publican, that 35 states with 365
electoral votes are Democratic (266
necessary to win), that Roosevelt's
pcpuiai standing is higher by one
half of one per cent this month over
last.
The poll shows many other
things, most interesting among
which are the facts that a ballot
among people listed in "Who's Who"
returned 32 per cent for Roosevelt,
68 per cent for a Republican; that
reliefers are for Roosevelt 78 per
cent.

ASK ANY of your contemporaries
what they would do if they knew
war to be declared next week.
Ninety per cent wouid tell you that
they would hie themselves up into

The other 10 per cent would let their

I>R. GEORGE GALLUP'S Insti
tute of Public Opinion statistics this
month show that 12 states with elec
toral votes of totaling 150 are Re
publican, that 35 states with 365
electoral votes are Democratic (266
necessary to win), that Roosevelt's
pcpuiai standing is higher by one
half of one per cent this month over
last.
The poll shows many other
things, most interesting among
which are the facts that a ballot
among people listed in "Who's Who"
returned 32 per cent for Roosevelt,
68 per cent for a Republican; that
reliefers are for Roosevelt 78 per
cent.
