'Bruno Was the Man'
Dr. Condon identified Bruno

the principal keeper of the state |
prison delay execution of Haupt- !
mann 72 hours while the grand |
jury investigated Wendel's repu
diated "confession."
Freeman said he sent the follow- I
ing telegram to Dr. Condon tonight:
'"We request your appearance be
fore the Mercer County Grand Jury
Wednesday, April 15, in connection i
with the Wendel case. Your ex- !
penses will be paid."
Expert Summoned
Freeman said he had also sum- j
moned Mahlon B. Foster of Wil- '
mington, Del., to appear Tuesday. I
The grand jury foreman said Foster j
would compare the handwriting of j
Wendel with samples from the ran- |
som note.
"Is Foster a handwriting ex- j
pert?" Freeman was asked.
"I'm not sure he is listed as one,"
replied Freeman, "but his evidence i
appears worth consideration."
