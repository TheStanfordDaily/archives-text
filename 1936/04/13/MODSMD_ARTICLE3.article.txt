A SPECTACULAR I 1 IKE broke out at one of the piers of the
cantilever section of the San Francisco-Oakland bay bridge when
a rivet dropped on creosote-soaked piling. Sixteen workmen were
rescued from the pier and a fircboat extinguished the blaze which
was visible from all parts of San Francisco. (A.P. Photo)
