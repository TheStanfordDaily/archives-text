# Chaplain Originated' Convalescent Home
## Dr. Gardner's Kindness To First Waifs Recalled 
### Dave Botsford 
Ever since David Charles Card- i
ner brought his British accent and !
Oxford manners to the Farm as
chaplain 33 years ago, he has been
doing things for other people.
He probably didn't realize, 19
years ago, just how much good he |
was doing. That summer —1917—he
and a few Stanford students brought j
underprivileged children down from j
San Francisco for a vacation. They 1
established something of a summer i
camp here on the campus, and the j
children liked it.
120 Kiddies Helped
They rented a home and in the j
next two years about 120 children |
had benefited from Dr. Gardner's |
and his students' kindness.
In 1919 the Stanford children's j
home attracted wide attention for i
the work it was doing. So, with the i
sanction of the Board of Trustees, !
Mr. and.Mrs. Timothy Hopkins es- j
tablished the Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children. Governor
Stanford's old ranch-house, dam
aged by the earthquake, was ren
ovated and made into the first per- I
manent building of the Home.
Soon the Stanford Home became a |
favorite charity for San Francisco j
and peninsula people. Hundreds of
ailing children who most of all
needed fresh air and sunshine to
make them well were sent down
from the city. Doctors marveled at
the Home's effectiveness in restor
' ing happiness where only pain had
j been before.
Mrs. Crocker Aids
i Mrs. Henry Crocker of San Fran
cisco in 1923 built a $50,000 addition,
the Kate D. McLaughlin unit, and
j a year later another bequest en
j abled the Home to expand again.
Today with an annual budget of
$63,000, the Stanford Convalescent
I Home cares for 70 children at a time.
A superintendent, seven graduate
j nurses ,and two teachers look after
] the children's needs, while four doc
j tors of the medical faculty give of
I their time.
I Chaplain David Gardner two
1 months from now will leave his
chapel and his Farm to another. His
1 Carmel cottage is waiting for him.
i When he goes, he may well pass
| with pride the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
For it was the unselfish kindness
j of this man, and of his loyal student
! friends, which started the Home.
I Stanford and thousands of San
j Francisco youngsters thank you,
j "Padre."
