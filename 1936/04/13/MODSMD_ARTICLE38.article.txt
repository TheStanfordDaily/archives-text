# Stanford To Eat Half-ton of Beans At Chanty Drive
## Convalescent Home Seeks $500 Goal in Bean Day Fete To Help Cripples 
### 
"Eat a Bean for the Babies."
Adhering strictly to an all-bean
diet, campus eating organizations
will celebrate the annual Convales- j
cent Home Drive Bean Day at the !
mid-day meal two weeks from to
day, announced Bean Day Chairman I
Margaret Johnson.
Mr. Kenner of King City is donat
ing the 1000 pounds of beans which j
will be consumed on the campus j
that day, as well as the cost of trans- ,
portation, which would otherwise >
have lowered the Convalescent
Home Fund by $80. Milk will be
provided for both sororities and fra
ternities on that day by the Gold
Seal, Golden State, Milbrae, and
Peninsula creameries.
To add variety to the bill of fare,
negotiations are being made to ar
range for a large supply of apples
which it is hoped will be donated
free of charge.
This, the fourth annual Bean Day,
should net about $500 for the Con
valescent Home, says Margaret
Johnson. Since this sum is $150
greater than the amount collected in
past years, the full co-operation of
(he campus will be needed in the at
tainment of this goal.
The average campus meal costs
about 35 cents, and since Bean Day
lunches cost between six and eight
cents, a saving of approximately 30
cents per meal is made possible. Of
the half ton of beans, 100 pounds
will go to Encina, 25 pounds to Roble
and Lagunita, 15 pounds to the
, Union, and 10 pounds to each fra
ternity, sorority, and eating club.
This will provide between a third
and a half pound of beans for each
student.
Students not affiliated with any
of the eating organizations are
asked to patronize the Union Cellar
on that day. Beans will be served
there, and the money saved will be
donated to the Home.
