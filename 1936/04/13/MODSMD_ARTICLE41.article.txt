## TORRID CLIME GOOD TIMES 
### 
It came up piping hot at two
chimes Saturday afternoon, and
there resulted some very good track
times and distances as well as no
little degree of discomfiture in the
bleachers as the sun, which is sup
posed to be 93,000.000 miles away,
seemed no farther away than the
Kentucky Derby, and you may be
assured that the latter joust is not
very far off.
The best track performance of
the afternoon, bar none, was the
1:47 2/5 world record set by the
Daily's favorite, Indian Broom, at
Tanfo as the spanking chestnut
3-year-old whipped in by seven
lengths, going all the time from
Top Row and Azucar to pocket the
$10,000 stake. His abnormally long
stride rocked the little apprentice
jockey Basil James like the Malolo
on a stormy morning. Tab this pony
for your Derby choice; the classic
comes up early in May.
But as this is primarily a college
sheet, generally scorning such drivel
as ponies, let us consider the more
refined occupation of track and field
athletics.
All in all the Stanfords did mighty
well. You will recall how California
beat UCLA 97-34 last week, so things
are looking up when the Reds score
a 9!) point win over the same Uelan
varsity.
Chuck Nimmo started right off
to win the mile by 100 yards in the
very good time of 4.19.7—and after
the nervous-running senior had
looked like a drowned animal in
practice all week. He did a fleet
stint in the relay as well.
