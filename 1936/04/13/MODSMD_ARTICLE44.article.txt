# Take Two Doubles
## 
### 
In addition to the previously men
tioned "crucial" in which Stanford
clinched the honors, they won an
other doubles match. Law and
Braly (S) proved that their united
efforts were superior to those of the
Trojans Hall and Rawley, winning
from them by a 6-1, 6-1 score. The
remaining doubles match went the
other way. Carr and John (SC)
were a trifle too strong for Stan
ford's Dey and Pommer, whom
they bested 6-2, 8-6.
The outcome of these contests was
a vindication of the prophetic ac
curacy of Sherman Lockwood, In
dian mentor, who had fearlessly pro
claimed that his boys "had a good
chance to win." When the two teams
met in the south earlier in the spring
the Troymen were the winners, so
the series is now even.
Next competition for the farm
netmen will be furnished by
U.C.L.A.
