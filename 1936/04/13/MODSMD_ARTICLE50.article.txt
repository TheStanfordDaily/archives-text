# Cardinal Nine To Clash With Bruins Today
## Indians Hope To Break Bruin Jinx; Bears Win 4-3 after Ten Innings 
### 
Varsity baseballers will have an i
opportunity to revenge two close I
defeats at the hands of U.C.L.A,
when they clash with the Bruins 1
j this afternoon on the Sunken Dia- !
j mond. The game will start at 3:15.
i It is expected that Coach Harry
Wolter will start Dick Armstrong ;
i on the mound against the southern- 1
! ers. Only other change contemplated j
! is putting Bob Matthews in the out- j
| field in place of Bones Hamilton, j
j who is in a batting slump.
Last Saturday California squeezed
i across a run in the tenth inning to j
eke out a narrow win over Stanford,
after the Cards had rallied in the
! tie up the score.
j The game was a tight pitcher's |
! ninth inning to score two runs and
1 battle all the way, with Charles
| Hardt going the full route for Cali
; fornia and giving up six bingles,
! while Ray Reiershauser, who pitched
' for Stanford, allowed nine hits. In
thiv field the Indians played much
j better bal lthan the Bears, much ;
j charged with only two boots, while 1
| the Cal nine committed seven I
| bungles.
Two more games remain in the i
! series, one to be played at Edwards
; Field again next Saturday, while
the third will be played on the
Farm, April 25.
