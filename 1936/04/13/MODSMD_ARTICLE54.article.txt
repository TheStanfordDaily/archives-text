## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Pre-Registration Educational Program For Frosh Next Fall Would Be Valuable

Discussion at lasl Wednesday's Honor Code
panel wandered oil' into many side-lraeks at
odd intervals, but one of these oll'-thc-point
sub-discussions prompted a remark, by Comp
troller Almon K. Roth, which may be the most
significant outgrowth of the entire meeting.
A* two-dlay period just preceding autumn
registration, in which freshmen and transfers
would receive comprehensive education on
Stanford traditions mixed with adequate con
ferences on vocational guidance, might build
up a respect for the Code, Mr. Roth suggested.
The worth of a brief pre-registration pro
gram like this—both to the individual new
comers and to the student body at large—•
seems so obvious that it is hard to under
stand why il lias not been done in the past few
years.
There was a time when a freshman got to
"fed" Stanford tradition in a few short weeks;
there was also a time when each student could
find enough time on registration day to give
a certain amount of real thought to his cur
riculum, and maladjustments were reason
ably scarce.
Rul I he Farm has become too crowded for
that; some organized guidance of this sort
has become necessary.
To facilitate an educational plan of this
sort, I lie men's and women's sponsors, Men's

and Women's Councils, professors and in
structors, and a few of the individual student
leaders could return to the campus a few days
ahead of time; most of them do anyway.
It would not be too much to require the
frosh to report three days early, and it would
give them a much more satisfactory start at
Stanford if they knew something about Ihe
place, and about the courses they were des
tined to take before they were railroaded into
them by hurried "advisers" who had 25 other
freshmen waiting to see them on Reg. day.
This program, of course, would necessitate
considerable preparation on the part of the
upperclassmen entrusted with tradition edu
cation.
The new students would have to be divided
into small groups and bold "bull sessions" on
only the nihil, fundamental Stanford tradi
tions—the Honor Code, Fundamental Stand
ard, Spirit of Equality, and the comparatively
few other "typical Stanfordisms."
But when the details of administration have
been worked out, and when the upperclass
men who themselves "feel" Stanford tradi
tions most wholeheartedly have been selected
to transfer their spirit to the newcomers, the
vocational-guidance-tradition-education pro
gram could make freshmen much more valu
able to the University and the University much
more valuable to them.
