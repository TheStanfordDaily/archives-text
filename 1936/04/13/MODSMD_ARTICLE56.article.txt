# Carnival Aids Charity, School, and Chiselers
## 
### 
Figures indicate that Saturday night's
Sophomore Carnival was, financially, the most
successful in history.
Hut the most important conclusion drawn
from the event was that supposedly blase stu
dents can have fun with simple pleasures, that
they do not need a big name band, an over
crowded nnd study dance floor, and San Fran
cisco's waiters and chauffeurs stepping on
their toes, to have a good time.
On the great Stanford wild animal preserve
students have found there is a field where
they can multiply their pleasures. Stanford
needs more of this week-end horseplay on the
home grounds.

However, there is a most important unfa
vorable conclusion that can he derived from
the event. There was evidence of widespread
financial peculations union# the booth man
agers of the concessions. Instead of demand
in# the Carnival tickets as a requirement for
participating* in their concessions, they ac
cepted profTered dimes.
Reports claim many of these dimes never
found their way to the Carnival management
or the Convalescent Home, as advertised.
The flower of Stanford's manhood may have
peculated dimes in 1929. lint growing stories
of athletes losing their wallets while compet
ing for the school in track meets, of students
losing their binders in the library and their
living quarters, of robberies here and there
should give pause.
