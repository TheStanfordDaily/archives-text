## The 						Working Student 
### 
(From the Minnesota Daily)
There is another side to Dean Nicholson's recent
statement that those students who must work their
way through college are definitely the happiest ones.
Recognizing that self-supporting students are often the
type most interested in their studies, there still re
mains the question, can the student do justice to his
studies by by burdening himself with outside work?
The average working student works 3 hours a day
for his board. This means that he works 21 hours a
week. Instructors say that for every credit hour a
student carries he should plan for 2 hours of study.
In other words, the time that the average working
student spends on his work is the equivalent of 7
hours of curricular work.
♦ * * *
Even if he is carrying the minimum of 12 hours
allowed him, he is doing work to the equivalent of
1J) credits, which is 1 more than the maximum usually
allowed a student in curriculum courses. A student
carrying 15 hours of work, which is usually a neces
sary average if he is to graduate in 4 years, is carrying
the equivalent of 22 hours a quarter.
The usual answer is that he should spend an extra
quarter or two in school and carry less hours. That,
of course, is possible but just prolongs the agony.
If he conscientiously applies himself to getting an
education he has little time for the social affairs that
have been so generously provided him, nor will he, in
most cases, find time to get the amount of recreation
necessary to maintain his health.
♦ * * *
Unless he is a genius, something must slip, either
his grades or his health. Unfortunately, it is often
both, and then his only recourse is to drop out of
school entirely. Hundreds of students do succeed in
working their way through to a degree, but only too
often what they have gained through learning respon
sibility and hard work they have lost in grades, en
thusiasm and vitality.
