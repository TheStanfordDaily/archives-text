# Easter Parade Fills Memorial Church
## Campus Celebrates With New Togs, Egg Hunt 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Yesterday being Easter, the fash
ion parade flounced into Memorial
Church for devotional exercises.
Jammed into the church was a sea
of femininity.. There were dry eyes
in the house, but not a head with
out a bonnet, or without a bird or
ribbon on it. The old song goes:
"The bird on Nellie's hat has rings
around its eyes."
Sunday, the bird on Nellie's hat
had rings around its eyes and, in
many cases, so did Nellie—and the
bird who took her.
Men in White
Men exhibited themselves in deli
cate tints of gabardine and worsted,
while the hashers and baggage men
appeared with Palm Beach suits,
blue shirts and white ties.
While (he parade moved about the
Quad, Chi Omegas, armed with 200
dyed eggs, conducted the annual
Easter Egg hunt at the Convalescent
Home.
A flood of convalescing kiddies
poured over the lawns and through
the shrubs on the Home grounds.
The kids on crutches had an ad
vantage because they could put
pressure in the pinches, making tre
mendous leaps when pressed.
Dreamy Annie Scores
But the girls with the dreamy
eyes overcame the lead with devices
known only to girls with dreamy
eyes. The devilish little Spanish
moppel, Annie, was definitely dis
covered wangling a chartreuse egg
from a Chinese gentleman,
Several capitalistic individuals
amassed 20 or .'5O eggs, but in defiance
of Hearstians, the subversive head
nurse effected a Communist settle
ment by dividing the eggs evenly
among the urchins.
