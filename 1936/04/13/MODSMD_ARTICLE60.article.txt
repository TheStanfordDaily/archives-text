# Our Hasher Sez:

A boy came up to me on the Quad one day and
suggested that they ought to change the name of the
local post of the Veterans of Future Wars to the
"Uncle Remus Post" because they are boring from
within, and then went off laughing and chuckling to
himself. I guess it is very funny, if you come to think
of it.
It is sad to see how some of Our Hasher's old fa
vorites have faded in the past years. The Gloomy
Moor has become a Social Sciences major, plays volley
ball, and smiles once in a while, but Desdemona, may
the Easter bunny bless her, goes marching on.
Dear friends will remember many of Desdemona's
past exploits, for she is an indefatigable worker. And
her latest achievement, according to contemporary
authority, is up to standard.
A gentleman, seeking some innocent fun, secured a
date with the lovely Desdemona for a date to play
bridge one night. Summarily ,the gentleman called.
Desdemona said, "I'll be down in a minute."
One hour later, the gentleman, becoming weary,
went home. One hour and fifteen minutes later,
Desdemona swept down the stairs.
Surprised that her friend had left, she said, "I
didn't know he was in a hurry."
Lives of women all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
If departing, we leave behind us
Cosmetics, powder, bobbie pins, grime.
—and women, too.
The Alpha Sigs were having an open house some
time ago, and they found it a bit difficult to add to the
color scheme of the fraternity living room. Finally
they found a gay little bit to drape the radio, which
touched off the whole ensemble.
At tea time, however, the color of the Chinese mis
cellany became extremely offensive to one of the
brothers, and he was all for destroying it in front of
all the assembled women guests.
» The decorator, alarmed, rushed to the breach,
shouting, "Don't, that's the cook's bathrobe."
