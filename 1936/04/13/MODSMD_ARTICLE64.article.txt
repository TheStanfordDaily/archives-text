The Editor, Sir:
I am a college graduate and al
though I am not from Stanford I
love your school for its high ideals
and its high standards. I read the
Daily regularly and take a keen in
terest in all of the campus activi
ties. I notice now that the honor
code is under fire.
Often, one can see the value of
certain things in retrospect much
better and more clearly than when
on the scene of action. With this in
mind, 1 beg of you who carry the
banner for Stanford, do not, now
or ever, discard the honor system.
By "you" I mean professors and in
structors as well as students. An in
structor who spies on a violator of
the code is himself guilty of break
ing it. His action Ls a complete con
fession of the fact that he expects
others to place a low value on
honor.
The mark of a truly educated per
son lies in the way he looks at
things, in the value he places on
certain principles. For example, we
know that a man or woman who
values honesty, self-respect, and the
truth far above the mere accumu
lation of knowledge or high grades
is truly well educated. You will
all find, when the smoke clears
away, that there is a vast difference
between a well informed fool or
cheat and an educated man or
woman.
And so I urge you Stanford men
and women, keep the honor code!
Make it live! Make it one of your
attitudes of mind! It will pay big
dividends later on.
