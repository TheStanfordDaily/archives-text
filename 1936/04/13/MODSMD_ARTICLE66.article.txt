# 'Colleen' Lacks Plot; Thumbs Up To Added Show
## 
### 
COLLEEN is not a story, in fact ,
its plot makes a good vaudeville j
show. Dick Powell makes has usual |

gestures, and the j
songs he sings will i
not likely be hits, j
The choruses are the '
same old Hollywood I
extravaganza type:
• dancing on marble

■■ - 1 ■ — un nidi uiu ,
floors with lattice work and stair
cases in the background. i
Ruby Keeler and Paul Draper do [
two clever dances, but only the j
latter is really entertaining. Hugh !
Herbert, a crazy business executive, !
who is alwaye getting into trouble
through his insane pranks and a |
tendency to look at another woman,
.stole the show.
In the added attraction we at last
have a show worth sitting through.
"TOO MANY PARENTS" seems to
be the wrong title for the show, for j
the entire story dwells on the life of 1
a young boy who is neglected by a '
father whom he adores. He goes
to * school in a typical movieland
military school, where life is one
round of fun. He is hurt by the fact j
his father doesn't write him, and he
tries to show his schoolmates what
a great man hi?; father is by writ- !
ing false letters to himself. He is !
found out and loses his hard earned
sword for falsification.
