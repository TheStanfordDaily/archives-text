## THE 						SPORT OF KINGS 
### 
Some sleek, long legged nags frol
icked in last Saturday afternoon's
Hades-like heat, and a goodly and
prosperous crowd was there —
goodly to the extent of 30,000 pairs
of vicious feet and prosperous
enough to intrust some $300,000 to
the care-free animals which per
formed between the oval fences.
* * *
Now it seems a certain erstwhile
expert on this nag-frolicking busi-

ness whispered in
the ear of a
stranger to the j
bet - your - mon- J
ey - and - watch J
'em - run sport '
that a certain i;
stipend placed on
the nose of a cer
tain horse was
sure to come I
back enriched by I
100 per cent. So 1
the stranger went (
out in the noon-

day sun prepared to round the
corner around which prosperity was
said to linger, and joined the throng
headed up the peninsula.
The goodly crowd had put its
means of transportation in all the
convenient spots and it was tramp,
tramp, through heat and dust in a
long trek to where you stand in line
to pay 40 cents for the privilege of
getting in where the stipends are
placed. Inside there are several
hundred persons who apparently are
there for the express purpose of
stepping on strangers' white shoes
for they did so with wonderful ef
fect. And there are many thousands
on hand to sit in all the shady seats
and scowl threateningly at stranger

would-be sitters.
The certain horse wasn't going to
frolic until the sixth race, so that
left about three hours of standing
around praying for the breeze which
the erstwhile expert said would
come in from the bay when the
sixth race was run.
Thirty thousand people sat around
picking their teeth, consuming tepid
beer, exhaling cigar smoke, and ra
tionalizing about their best during i
the half hours between races or
stood up with pecuniary glints in
their eyes when the nags frolicked, i
* * *
With a flourish that beats any
thing ever seen in the Ad building, i
a grasping hand added the strang
er's stipend to the $70,000 fortune
which was bet on the sixth race.
And prosperity became imminent. !
The certain horse was called |
Euchre or something which sounded '
very similar and he certainly eu
chred the stranger. He was one of
those hang-backers, and he hung
back so far all the way around the
track that there were some other '
horses which finished the race be
fore he did. From the looks of
faces round about, the stranger fig
ured he was one of the minority !
which didn't know which horse Wcis
going to win all the time.
The sport of kings they used to j

call it. Now it's big business with
a state tax like all important busi
nesses have imposed upon them, and
its popular with the masses. But to
a stranger who couldn't recognize a
bad thing when it's shown him, it's
(he hottest, slowest, smelliest form
of gambling yet devised, and it was
tough finding out.

Some sleek, long legged nags frol
icked in last Saturday afternoon's
Hades-like heat, and a goodly and
prosperous crowd was there —
goodly to the extent of 30,000 pairs
of vicious feet and prosperous
enough to intrust some $300,000 to
the care-free animals which per
formed between the oval fences.
* * *
Now it seems a certain erstwhile
expert on this nag-frolicking busi-

ness whispered in
the ear of a
stranger to the j
bet - your - mon- J
ey - and - watch J
'em - run sport '
that a certain i;
stipend placed on
the nose of a cer
tain horse was
sure to come I
back enriched by I
100 per cent. So 1
the stranger went (
out in the noon-

day sun prepared to round the
corner around which prosperity was
said to linger, and joined the throng
headed up the peninsula.
The goodly crowd had put its
means of transportation in all the
convenient spots and it was tramp,
tramp, through heat and dust in a
long trek to where you stand in line
to pay 40 cents for the privilege of
getting in where the stipends are
placed. Inside there are several
hundred persons who apparently are
there for the express purpose of
stepping on strangers' white shoes
for they did so with wonderful ef
fect. And there are many thousands
on hand to sit in all the shady seats
and scowl threateningly at stranger

would-be sitters.
The certain horse wasn't going to
frolic until the sixth race, so that
left about three hours of standing
around praying for the breeze which
the erstwhile expert said would
come in from the bay when the
sixth race was run.
Thirty thousand people sat around
picking their teeth, consuming tepid
beer, exhaling cigar smoke, and ra
tionalizing about their best during i
the half hours between races or
stood up with pecuniary glints in
their eyes when the nags frolicked, i
* * *
With a flourish that beats any
thing ever seen in the Ad building, i
a grasping hand added the strang
er's stipend to the $70,000 fortune
which was bet on the sixth race.
And prosperity became imminent. !
The certain horse was called |
Euchre or something which sounded '
very similar and he certainly eu
chred the stranger. He was one of
those hang-backers, and he hung
back so far all the way around the
track that there were some other '
horses which finished the race be
fore he did. From the looks of
faces round about, the stranger fig
ured he was one of the minority !
which didn't know which horse Wcis
going to win all the time.
The sport of kings they used to j

call it. Now it's big business with
a state tax like all important busi
nesses have imposed upon them, and
its popular with the masses. But to
a stranger who couldn't recognize a
bad thing when it's shown him, it's
