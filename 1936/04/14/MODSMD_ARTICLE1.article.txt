# Student Fund Shows Dimes Not Dollars
## Public Record Lumps Big Amounts, Gives Many Pages To Small Sums 
### Bob Eisenbach 
(Editor's Note: This is the scc
ond article of a series explaining
and interpreting the Students Or
ganizations Fund.)

That Stanfordites spent nearly
$130,000 of their own money in and
on their own college during the last
bookkeeping year is no secret to
anyone who cares to ask.
Those who got beyond Trigonom
etry II and who care to get details
can also find that the German Honor
Society credited their expense ac
count with 21 cents for postage in
the same period; that Sigma Delta
Rho bounced 82 cents to the Stan
ford Union for spangles. (Yep, that's
right.)
Gives Party
But not evident, even to detail
seekers who have weathered Inte
gral Calc, Ls the fact that $149.80
credited to Ex Committee by Ex
Committee from the A.S.S.U. budget
was spent on Ben Cave's famous
party-party.

Nor is another little item of
$2079.48 on A.S.S.U.'s disbursements
for 1934-35 exactly clear.
It's labeled "office," but did the
whole Stevie - and-Aten-Daten-Ac
countin' Station run the year out on
two grand? And if it did, how much
did Misses Aten and Stevens get?
Now that two grand, Stevie ex
plains, represents merely the
A.S.S.U.'s share of office expenses,
1.4 per cent of A.S.S.U.'s gross in
come.
Organizations Pay
Other organizations pay a simi
lar fee on their gross incomes. The
amount most emphatically does not
include Miss Steven's salary.
But try and find that in the Report
on the Students' Organizations Fund,
supposedly containing all the dope.
Again, evident is the Chess
Club's balance of 3.84, but not so
evident is a somewhat larger item
on A.S.S.U.'s budget tagged "New
Projects," costing just $702, "New
Projects," hmmni . . .
Now Aten-Stevie says that book
keeping is bookkeeping, and if
A.S.S.U. expenditures were detailed
for public inspection they's fill the
Encyclopedia Britannica.
Gros 'Just Banker'
Now Bob Gros will tell you that
he's just a banker for most of the
$135,000 he's due to handle, and that
he plans to bomb a few things with
his manager's report. Gros has con
trol only over A.S.S.U.'s approxi
mate $14,500. The balance is merely
administered by him through the
Students' Organizations Fund, a
bookkeeping service of which A.S.
S.U. is merely as participant as are
other organizations.
But the fact remains that A.S.
S.U.'s disbursements totaling ap
proximately $11,500 get just about
a page of space in the Fund report,
while the Associated Students'
Dance Scries, with disbursements
of approximately $1000. get about
two pages, outlined in detail down
to such stuff as $1.50 for hat
checking. 93 cents for gasoline and
$1.33 for cards and spangles
(again!).
Smaller organizations may have
their own way of listing their
own ten cents worth. But is that any
reason for cloaking Ex Committee's
$150 party under just "Ex Com
mittee?" The dime's worth would
take care of itself as part of a two.
or three-buck operating expense.
The $150 is something not only to
worry about, but for the student
body to know about.
Which is not to imply that a party
isn't legitimate expense, popularly
considered, but which is to imply
that $150 for party should be listed
for party—Ex Committee Party —
like that.

Dance Scries, with disbursements
of approximately $1000. get about
two pages, outlined in detail down
to such stuff as $1.50 for hat
checking. 93 cents for gasoline and
$1.33 for cards and spangles
(again!).
Smaller organizations may have
their own way of listing their
own ten cents worth. But is that any
reason for cloaking Ex Committee's
$150 party under just "Ex Com
mittee?" The dime's worth would
take care of itself as part of a two.
or three-buck operating expense.
The $150 is something not only to
worry about, but for the student
body to know about.
Which is not to imply that a party
isn't legitimate expense, popularly
considered, but which is to imply
that $150 for party should be listed
for party—Ex Committee Party —
like that.

That Stanfordites spent nearly
$130,000 of their own money in and
on their own college during the last
bookkeeping year is no secret to
anyone who cares to ask.
Those who got beyond Trigonom
etry II and who care to get details
can also find that the German Honor
Society credited their expense ac
count with 21 cents for postage in
the same period; that Sigma Delta
Rho bounced 82 cents to the Stan
ford Union for spangles. (Yep, that's
right.)
Gives Party
But not evident, even to detail
seekers who have weathered Inte
gral Calc, Ls the fact that $149.80
credited to Ex Committee by Ex
Committee from the A.S.S.U. budget
was spent on Ben Cave's famous
party-party.

Nor is another little item of
$2079.48 on A.S.S.U.'s disbursements
for 1934-35 exactly clear.
It's labeled "office," but did the
whole Stevie - and-Aten-Daten-Ac
countin' Station run the year out on
two grand? And if it did, how much
did Misses Aten and Stevens get?
Now that two grand, Stevie ex
plains, represents merely the
A.S.S.U.'s share of office expenses,
1.4 per cent of A.S.S.U.'s gross in
come.
Organizations Pay
Other organizations pay a simi
lar fee on their gross incomes. The
amount most emphatically does not
include Miss Steven's salary.
But try and find that in the Report
on the Students' Organizations Fund,
supposedly containing all the dope.
Again, evident is the Chess
Club's balance of 3.84, but not so
evident is a somewhat larger item
on A.S.S.U.'s budget tagged "New
Projects," costing just $702, "New
Projects," hmmni . . .

keeping is bookkeeping, and if
A.S.S.U. expenditures were detailed
for public inspection they's fill the
Encyclopedia Britannica.
Gros 'Just Banker'
Now Bob Gros will tell you that
he's just a banker for most of the
$135,000 he's due to handle, and that
he plans to bomb a few things with
his manager's report. Gros has con
trol only over A.S.S.U.'s approxi
mate $14,500. The balance is merely
administered by him through the
Students' Organizations Fund, a
bookkeeping service of which A.S.
S.U. is merely as participant as are
other organizations.
But the fact remains that A.S.
S.U.'s disbursements totaling ap
proximately $11,500 get just about
a page of space in the Fund report,
while the Associated Students'
Dance Scries, with disbursements
of approximately $1000. get about

on A.S.S.U.'s budget tagged "New
Projects," costing just $702, "New
Projects," hmmni . . .

keeping is bookkeeping, and if
A.S.S.U. expenditures were detailed
for public inspection they's fill the
Encyclopedia Britannica.
Gros 'Just Banker'
Now Bob Gros will tell you that
he's just a banker for most of the
$135,000 he's due to handle, and that
he plans to bomb a few things with
his manager's report. Gros has con
trol only over A.S.S.U.'s approxi
mate $14,500. The balance is merely
administered by him through the
Students' Organizations Fund, a
bookkeeping service of which A.S.
S.U. is merely as participant as are
other organizations.
But the fact remains that A.S.
S.U.'s disbursements totaling ap
proximately $11,500 get just about
a page of space in the Fund report,
while the Associated Students'
Dance Scries, with disbursements
of approximately $1000. get about
two pages, outlined in detail down
to such stuff as $1.50 for hat
checking. 93 cents for gasoline and
$1.33 for cards and spangles
(again!).
Smaller organizations may have
their own way of listing their
own ten cents worth. But is that any
reason for cloaking Ex Committee's
$150 party under just "Ex Com
mittee?" The dime's worth would
take care of itself as part of a two.
or three-buck operating expense.
The $150 is something not only to
worry about, but for the student
body to know about.
Which is not to imply that a party
isn't legitimate expense, popularly
considered, but which is to imply
that $150 for party should be listed
for party—Ex Committee Party —
like that.
