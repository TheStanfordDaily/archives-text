Western tryouts for the Olympic

in June, according to Ernst Brand
sten, Stanford diving coach and head
of the Olympic swim trials for this
section of the country, who returned
last week from New York.
Tryouts, which will include water
polo and men's and women's swim
ming events, will probably be held
during the week-ends of June 6-7
and 13-14, Brandsten said. Winners
will compete in the final tryouts at
Chicago later in the summer.
