# Fraternities Plan Relations
## Council Will Investigate Possibility of 'Sings' 
### 
Tomorrow night the Interfrater
nity Council will meet to consider
the proposed plan for holding inter
fraternity exchange dinners when it
will be presented by the council's
special committee on interfraternity
relationships.
In addition to this the council is
planning a discussion of the possi
bility of holding an interfraternity
"sing." A report is to be made to
the Council first by President Bob
Hoover, who has been conducting a
private investigation into the various
systems of fraternity "sings" as
successfully carried on in many
eastern colleges and universities.
The plan for exchange dinners has
two features of importance. First,
only sophomores will be "exchang
ed" between the houses; second,
each week the council will decide
and approve of the houses which are
to trade that week after the dates
have been suggested by the special
committee.
Details concerning these arrange
ments are to be discussed at the
meeting tomorrow night.
