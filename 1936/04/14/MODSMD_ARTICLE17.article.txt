# Visit From Grayson Thrills Youngsters
## 
### 
One day last week was a big one
for 70 little Convalescent Home
youngsters. Bobby Grayson came to
visit them.
At first they wouldn't believe it.
"He's not really Bobby Grayson!"
They'd seen his

picture plenty of
times but — well,
Bobby Grayson
just wouldn't
come to see
them.
Most of these
little boys and
girls have never
seen a football
game. Fifty of
them can't get out
of bed, but that
doesn't keep them
from being great
fans of Bobby
Grayson.
Grayson spent
I about an hour

visiting all the wards and talking to
all the bedridden youngsters. Even
the girls knew all about him.
The day after Bobby was there,
Bennie Salamoni, a San Jose lad
who is almost well now after six
months in bed, wrote him a letter.
"Dear Bobby," he scrawled. "How
, are you? I am fine. Boy was I glad
| to see you when you came to see
I us. lis the first time in my life I
I ever talked to an Ail-American

! football player like you. I think its
the best opportunity a boy or girl
| can have. I have listened to most of
the games over the radio and from
I what they said you're one of the
! greatest football players in the

1 world.
"Bobby I would like to have your I
photograph and 1 wish you would j
give me one. My friend Dirk says
he thinks your a swell and great j
guy, and so do I even if we are \
for Cal."
Mrs. Margaret Atwood later said
thsit Grayson's vi.sit had been a great,
help in keeping the children happy.
And when they're happy, they get
! well faster.
