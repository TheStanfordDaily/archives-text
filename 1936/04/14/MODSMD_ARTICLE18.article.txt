# Committeemen Complete Plans For Home Drive
## King-Queen Contest, Bean Day, Barbecue, Ball, and Labor Day Included 
### John Rice 
While the Stanford populace
firmly planted its feet and waited for
the annual Convalescent Home
Drive beginning tomorrow to hit it
from all angles, Convalescent Home
committeemen were busy last night
retouching various details of the
drive.
First activity is the King-Queen
election, featuring campus politics
at its worst—or at its best—in a
battle royal with row, halls, and
clubs fighting tooth and nail to elect
a representative to the throne. Final
fnoney votes will be cast on April
22.
Royalty Floats
Those chosen to head Stanford's
Royal Court will first be seen in
their official capacity on the after
noon of April 24, when they take
their places in the royal float pro
vided for them at the Junior Water
Carnival. Donning the royal purple
they will proceed later in the eve
ning to their thrones in the midst of
the splendor that is the Masque
Ball.
Beans Coming
Bean Day, and the strawberry
brunch on April 27, are two of the
more familiar of the Drive activi
ties. On that day a mid-day meal
consisting almost entirely of beans
will be served to the campus, and
the money saved will go to the
home.
Climaxing the Drive activities
comes Labor Day. On April 29 the
Farm will move out to the Conval
escent Home en tot. That night
there will be an all-campus barbe
cue with entertainment and food for
all.
After the entertainment there
will be a jolly-up, and after that—
the committee chairmen hope—
there will be a larger sum to con
tribute to the home then there has
ever been in previous years.
