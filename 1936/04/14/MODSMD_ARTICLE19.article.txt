# Seniors Favor Ten Dollar Bids
## Elfving Visits Campus To Complete Ball Plans 
### 
No decision has been made as yet
as to the price of bids for the senior
ball, but cards sent to members of
the class revealed to date that 157
favor-the price of $10, and 103 the
$8.50 bids.
Bob Elfving, chairman of the Sen
ior Ball committee, made a flying
visit to the campus last week to
confer with his committee on points
which have been under discussion
in arrangements for the ball.
It was pointed out that the gov
ernment amusement tax will take
away 10 per cent of the money made
on each bid, so that only $7.65 would
go to the committee making ar
rangements if the lower priced bids
were accepted, whereas $9 would be
available if the higher priced bids
were used.
Seniors who wish to attend the
ball are advised to reserve their
bids at the A.S.S.U. office imme
diately.
