gests the new angle which he will j
discuss in relation to the current j

Starting with the latest movements j
of German troops into the Rhine- :
land by Herr Hitler, Mr. Buck will !
correlate the two or three other
similar instances in recent German
foreign movements. A little over a
year ago there was a conscription '
move, and re-establishing of the
army and navy by Hitler. A year
before that, Germany withdrew from
the League of Nations.
Therefore, by "diplomacy by
crisis" Dr. Buck implies that perhaps j
Hitler is developing a method of
producing situations requiring ad
justment.
