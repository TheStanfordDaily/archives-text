# Two-Day Period To Orient New Students Advocated By Roth
## Pre-Registration Period To Instruct Transfers, Frosh in Local Customs 
### Johnson Hill 
From several corners of the Farm
approval was voiced last night of a
proposal to give incoming freshmen
and transfers some knowledge of
Stanford's customs and traditions in
a pre-registration period of instruc
tion next fall.
The suggestion was made by
Comptroller Almon E. Roth in the
Honor Code panel last week. At
present, it is being discussed by stu
dent and faculty organizations.
Must Come Early
Roth's plan, if approved and put
into effect by the administration,
will require early appearance of
new students so they may be ini
tiated into the "Stanford system of
education." The program, it was
understood, probably will include a
series of assemblies and conferences
in which upperclassmen and pro
fessors will outline the University's
activities.
"I would be very happy if there
were some period arranged when all
these things could be ironed out,"
Roth commented in support of his
project.
Mallatratt Agrees
Gordy Mallatratt, head sponsor in
Encina Hall, joined in approval of
the plan. "If Mr. Roth's suggestion
is put into practice, it will be a
worthwhile thing for all new stu
dents," he declared. "Similar ideas
have been given to me by students,
so I think there would be little
difficulty in getting the freshmen
and transfers to co-operate."
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, director of
vocational guidance, gave the fol
lowing statement:
Residence Is Advantage
"Stanford has a tremendous ad
vantage over most schools in that it
is a residence university and there is
more opportunity for personal rela
tionships and contact.
"Such a thing as freshman week
is to be avoided," he asserted, "and
the University and students could go
half and half in educating those new
to our system. A workable plan
would be to arrange meetings be
tween small groups of freshmen and
I sponsors or other men in their hall."
Comment Favorable
In addition, comment favoring the
proposal was received from Wally
Brooke, A.S.S.U. president. "It's an
j excellent idea," he said, "and should
be worked out for use next fall,
! providing the administration can af
■ ford to open Encina a day or two
early."
The suggestion will be discussed
in panels and other group assemblies
thus spring. Contact must be made
j with University officials before defi
| nite action can be taken, it was re
ported.

Comptroller Almon E. Roth in the
Honor Code panel last week. At
present, it is being discussed by stu
dent and faculty organizations.
Must Come Early
Roth's plan, if approved and put
into effect by the administration,
will require early appearance of
new students so they may be ini
tiated into the "Stanford system of
education." The program, it was
understood, probably will include a
series of assemblies and conferences
in which upperclassmen and pro
fessors will outline the University's
activities.
"I would be very happy if there
were some period arranged when all
these things could be ironed out,"
Roth commented in support of his
project.
Mallatratt Agrees
Gordy Mallatratt, head sponsor in
Encina Hall, joined in approval of
the plan. "If Mr. Roth's suggestion
is put into practice, it will be a
worthwhile thing for all new stu
dents," he declared. "Similar ideas
have been given to me by students,
so I think there would be little
difficulty in getting the freshmen
and transfers to co-operate."
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, director of
vocational guidance, gave the fol
lowing statement:
Residence Is Advantage
"Stanford has a tremendous ad
vantage over most schools in that it
is a residence university and there is
more opportunity for personal rela
tionships and contact.
"Such a thing as freshman week
is to be avoided," he asserted, "and
the University and students could go
half and half in educating those new
to our system. A workable plan
would be to arrange meetings be
tween small groups of freshmen and
I sponsors or other men in their hall."
Comment Favorable
In addition, comment favoring the
proposal was received from Wally
Brooke, A.S.S.U. president. "It's an
j excellent idea," he said, "and should
be worked out for use next fall,
! providing the administration can af
■ ford to open Encina a day or two
early."
The suggestion will be discussed
in panels and other group assemblies
thus spring. Contact must be made
j with University officials before defi
| nite action can be taken, it was re
ported.
From several corners of the Farm
approval was voiced last night of a
proposal to give incoming freshmen
and transfers some knowledge of
Stanford's customs and traditions in
a pre-registration period of instruc
tion next fall.
