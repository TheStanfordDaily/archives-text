### Les Squires 
In matters poetic
My diction's pathetic,
It seems I just can't rhyme a line;
In fact all my verses
House nothing but curses,
And seldom approach the sublime.
But here, with your pardon,
I'll trot out my jargon—
(My Ko*><'t I just had to pawn)
And expose for your pleasure
That ultimate treasure
A rhythmical "Time Marches On."
The President fishes—
The G.O.P. wishes
He'd stray to the island of Guam;
Those Republican charmers,
The "view with alarmers,"
Shout a hissingly sibilant "damn."

Tfie Lion of Judah,
An African poobah,
J'Vi-ls no love for his potential tamer,
So he shaves off his jaws,
And sheathes up his claws,
And scrams like a long-distance
runner.

The British endeavor
As stoutly as ever
To speak with the accent of right;
Yet the fleet's! in position,
And even is wishin',
To shout with the accent of might.

The Russians are raising
The cost of evading,
The woes of a married man's plight;
While Italy praises
The lady who raises
More babies to fodder the fight.

Our congressmen falter
And shrink from the halter
Involving new taxes this season,
There's nothing revolter
Than making a voter
Pay cash while he listens to reason.
