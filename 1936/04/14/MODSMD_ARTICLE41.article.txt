KINGSBURY WORKS,
THREAT TO TROY
While Roy Staley and Phil Cope, |'
the U.S.C. world-record hurdlers, ,
are looked on to take one-two in the
high hurdles when Tribe meets Troy
in Los Angeles next Saturday, the j
dopers are missing up on one bet.
They forget that Stanford has a !
oouple of hurdlers, too. Of course j
Sammy Klopstock is always danger- '
ous no matter who he is facing, !
whether it be highs or lows, fair i
weather or foul.
Sam, with a form all his own, can
out-hurdle most anybody in the
land at his optimum condition—he
has done that. And this year he has
a partner who will bear watching '
the rest of the season. And all the j
watching this helpmeet gets he will j
deserve.
The fellow is Hunt Kingsbury. i
Hunt was a star as a frosh, split
ting victories right along with Klop- |
stock. The pair was boomed as an j
invincible three-year combination, j
until Hunt fell in a practice meet I
two years ago and v/as badly hurt.
He was out all his soph year. He <
tried to come back last year, but the |
ailment persisted. He worked re- )
gardless, jogging, sprinting, exer- |
cising, a little hurdling.
Then last Saturday Klopstock ran |
14.9 and 24 flat in the two barrier i
events. Kingsbury was but a jersey's j
width astern the little family man in !
both. Two, three years' work cul- !
initiated, and we now have Hunt |
back as a potential point scorer next i
Saturday.
A little jinx item came to light |
Saturday at the Cal-Stanford swim
ming meet. It concerns Tom Boothe,
the Cardinal diver.
It seems that although experts
over at the Encina pools say Tom
has been the best diver in "Big
Meet" swimming for four years, he
has never won the event from Cal.
Heralded as a great star as a
frosh, and truly showing a good
record through the frosh season,
Tom only got third against Cal.
As a soph, and again as a junior,
he was relegated to back seats in

j the Bear meets.
j Then, despite the fact that he was
I favored to win Saturday, he just
j couldn't erase the Indian sign, got a
j second place, a few points behind the
j Cal diver.
ALONG THE SAME lines is a
yarn about Danny Kuhns, the flashy
young Cal diver. In the Olympics
j fund meet held here five weeks ago,
! Danny failed to win the springboard
j competition.
In the five weeks since that meet,
j the Bear coach has seen neither hide
nor hair of Danny. No explanation
or anything—that's all there is.

KINGSBURY WORKS,
THREAT TO TROY
While Roy Staley and Phil Cope, |'
the U.S.C. world-record hurdlers, ,
are looked on to take one-two in the
high hurdles when Tribe meets Troy
in Los Angeles next Saturday, the j
dopers are missing up on one bet.
They forget that Stanford has a !
oouple of hurdlers, too. Of course j
Sammy Klopstock is always danger- '
ous no matter who he is facing, !
whether it be highs or lows, fair i
weather or foul.
Sam, with a form all his own, can
out-hurdle most anybody in the
land at his optimum condition—he
has done that. And this year he has
a partner who will bear watching '
the rest of the season. And all the j
watching this helpmeet gets he will j
deserve.
The fellow is Hunt Kingsbury. i
Hunt was a star as a frosh, split
ting victories right along with Klop- |
stock. The pair was boomed as an j
invincible three-year combination, j
until Hunt fell in a practice meet I
two years ago and v/as badly hurt.
He was out all his soph year. He <
tried to come back last year, but the |
ailment persisted. He worked re- )
gardless, jogging, sprinting, exer- |
cising, a little hurdling.
Then last Saturday Klopstock ran |
14.9 and 24 flat in the two barrier i
events. Kingsbury was but a jersey's j
width astern the little family man in !
both. Two, three years' work cul- !
initiated, and we now have Hunt |
back as a potential point scorer next i
Saturday.
A little jinx item came to light |
Saturday at the Cal-Stanford swim
ming meet. It concerns Tom Boothe,
the Cardinal diver.
It seems that although experts
over at the Encina pools say Tom
has been the best diver in "Big
Meet" swimming for four years, he
has never won the event from Cal.
Heralded as a great star as a
frosh, and truly showing a good
record through the frosh season,
Tom only got third against Cal.
As a soph, and again as a junior,
he was relegated to back seats in

j the Bear meets.
j Then, despite the fact that he was
I favored to win Saturday, he just
j couldn't erase the Indian sign, got a
j second place, a few points behind the
j Cal diver.
ALONG THE SAME lines is a
yarn about Danny Kuhns, the flashy
young Cal diver. In the Olympics
j fund meet held here five weeks ago,
! Danny failed to win the springboard
j competition.
In the five weeks since that meet,
j the Bear coach has seen neither hide
nor hair of Danny. No explanation
or anything—that's all there is.
