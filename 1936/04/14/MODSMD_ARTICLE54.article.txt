Professors arc not any more stupid than
ordinary people, they are merely the perpetra
tors of the more refined types of stupidity.
Still, it is frequently a valuable kind of stu
pidity and America needs more of it.
After our brilliant scholars have ground out
their seven or eight years as students under
professors who do not worry about the Honor
Code, do not care about student activities or
their effect, they hand in a bit of fact-digging !
that attempts to isolate one unimportant fact
from an inter-relationship of important facts, j
and after the usual process of assisting and
instructing become professors who do not care j
either.
Tins Daily realizes that, since professors j
arc not any more stupid than ordinary people, ■
and are capable of isolating these facts from i
the inter-related facts, they should be allowed j
these whimsies to have full play. Tin: Daily
has never considered abolishing professors. As j
a matter of fact, they are perfectly harmless i
unless attacked.
But since we have them, we ought to do
something with all this potential isolating
power.
The best idea that comes to hand as a tem- j

porary expedient is that Stanford should pub
lish a monthly or quarterly journal ot' Social
Sciences, containing some of those valuable
contributions to arts and sciences that the
professors must be working on during those
long hours when they can't be found in their
ollices or marking attendance in the class
rooms.
There is 110 such journal 011 the Coast. Cali
fornia and Southern California have law re
views. Oregon has the Commonwealth lie
view, which is severly limited to slate politics.
The success of the more general reviews,
such as the Vale Review and the Southwestern
and Sewanee Reviews, hints that Stanford,
with a fairly well-balanced university of lib
eral arts and technical schools, as a repre
sentative of a colorful section in America, and
with a faculty who are well up on current
trends, could contribute something valuable
to culture and science in such a journal.
Of course, such a publication would have
to be subsidized. It would not be a very suc
cessful medium for cigarette or liquor adver
tising. But it might be worth the cost, if the
social science professors would contribute
their background and understanding of social
problems to a collection of this sort.

their seven or eight years as students under
professors who do not worry about the Honor
Code, do not care about student activities or
their effect, they hand in a bit of fact-digging !
that attempts to isolate one unimportant fact
from an inter-relationship of important facts, j
and after the usual process of assisting and
instructing become professors who do not care j
either.
Tins Daily realizes that, since professors j
arc not any more stupid than ordinary people, ■
and are capable of isolating these facts from i
the inter-related facts, they should be allowed j
these whimsies to have full play. Tin: Daily
has never considered abolishing professors. As j
a matter of fact, they are perfectly harmless i
unless attacked.
But since we have them, we ought to do
something with all this potential isolating
power.
The best idea that comes to hand as a tem- j

porary expedient is that Stanford should pub
lish a monthly or quarterly journal ot' Social
Sciences, containing some of those valuable
contributions to arts and sciences that the
professors must be working on during those
long hours when they can't be found in their
ollices or marking attendance in the class
rooms.
There is 110 such journal 011 the Coast. Cali
fornia and Southern California have law re
views. Oregon has the Commonwealth lie
view, which is severly limited to slate politics.
The success of the more general reviews,
such as the Vale Review and the Southwestern
and Sewanee Reviews, hints that Stanford,
with a fairly well-balanced university of lib
eral arts and technical schools, as a repre
sentative of a colorful section in America, and
with a faculty who are well up on current
trends, could contribute something valuable
to culture and science in such a journal.
Of course, such a publication would have
to be subsidized. It would not be a very suc
cessful medium for cigarette or liquor adver
tising. But it might be worth the cost, if the
social science professors would contribute
their background and understanding of social
problems to a collection of this sort.
Professors arc not any more stupid than
ordinary people, they are merely the perpetra
tors of the more refined types of stupidity.
Still, it is frequently a valuable kind of stu
pidity and America needs more of it.
