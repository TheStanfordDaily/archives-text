# Pre-Registration Period Deserves a Try
## 
### 
Rallying student, faculty, and Administra
tion support yesterday indicated that a pre
registration period of instruction in Farm
traditions and vocational guidance for fresh
men and transfers may be inaugurated at
Stanford next fall.
The final decision, of course, must await
the return of President Ray Lyman Wilbur
and Registrar .1. P. Mitchell. But it is not en
tirely upon the Administration forces that the
success of the project will depend.
In order to make the pre-school period
something more than two or three days of
boring speeches for the freshmen, an organ
ized program in which faculty and student
participation is co-ordinated must be worked
out in advance.
Purposes of the pre - registration period
would be: first, individual conferences with
freshmen and transfers to aid them in deter
mining their major subject and in selecting
their courses; second, an explanation of the
history of Stanford together with an outline
of what the Farm stands for, presented with
the attitude that "Stanford men do this and
that," and "Such and such just isn't done at
Stanford"; and third, to acquaint the new
comers with some of the activities and oppor
tunities the University oilers.
Eneina and Roble sponsors are Ihe logical
guardians of tradition among the freshmen;
but to insure the prc-regislration period's suc
cess they must make some preparations for
a series of informal bull sessions with the

I'rosh, and must themselves have more than a
surface respect tor those traditions.
At any rate, to help preserve fast-dying
Stanford principles, and for the sake of new
comers, the pre-registivation period deserves a
trv.
