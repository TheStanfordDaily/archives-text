## Peace Is Expensive

Peace is an expensive luxury. It is so expensive
that the countries have never yet been willing to pay
its price. The world can have peace whenever it really
wants it more than anything else, but up until now men
have never wanted peace as much as at the present.
The price of peace is free movement of trade, free
movement of populations and adjustable distributions
of territory. This is an expensive demand. It will not
be until we see the superlative value of peace that we
shall be willing to meet it.
♦ * * *
At the present moment we have national trade
barriers that have set up artificial and expensive
systems so as to cut off from others the normal
markets in which they might dispose of their goods.
Our own tariff is an example. It was adopted over
the protest of fifty nations. It was one of the most
difficult policies of the contemporary world making
for a dislocation of normal world markets, shutting
off other nations from natural outlets for their surplus
products and so condemning millions of their people
to live at starvation levels. We cannot escape respon
sibility for the resulting tendency to war.
Would we fight rather than surrender the right to
control our tariffs to suit our own welfare? Would
Great Britain call out her army and navy before she
would part with a square mile of her empire? These
are (he questions whose answers reveal whether we
arc willing to pay the price of peace. My own guess
is that there are some things we value more highly than
peace, and this leads me to the belief that it is not
until we are willing to say that we want peace more
than economic or territorial or colonial advantages
that we shall have peace.
» * * ♦
This has produced the most enthusiastic belief of
our currcnt world, namely, that we serve our own best
interest to the nation above all other. The supreme
good in the mind of the average man is not the building
of peace among nations, but the securing of the ad
vantages of his own nation before that of any or all
other nations. As long as this is true every man is the
raw material of an army and popular psychology sup
ports our own economic nationalism in a tendency
toward international strife. It will not be until we are
ready to put international good above national ad
vantage that we shall be prepared for peace.
The first advance on the road to peace is to recog
nize its cost. Peace is an easy word to praise, but a
costly one to live with. Nevertheless, it is only on the
keeping the peace that we shall achieve those goals
that set men free. There is no other way. There is no
cheaper way.

Peace is an expensive luxury. It is so expensive
that the countries have never yet been willing to pay
its price. The world can have peace whenever it really
wants it more than anything else, but up until now men
have never wanted peace as much as at the present.
The price of peace is free movement of trade, free
movement of populations and adjustable distributions
of territory. This is an expensive demand. It will not
be until we see the superlative value of peace that we
shall be willing to meet it.

At the present moment we have national trade
barriers that have set up artificial and expensive
systems so as to cut off from others the normal
markets in which they might dispose of their goods.
Our own tariff is an example. It was adopted over
the protest of fifty nations. It was one of the most
difficult policies of the contemporary world making
for a dislocation of normal world markets, shutting
off other nations from natural outlets for their surplus
products and so condemning millions of their people
to live at starvation levels. We cannot escape respon
sibility for the resulting tendency to war.
Would we fight rather than surrender the right to
control our tariffs to suit our own welfare? Would
Great Britain call out her army and navy before she
would part with a square mile of her empire? These
are (he questions whose answers reveal whether we
arc willing to pay the price of peace. My own guess
is that there are some things we value more highly than
peace, and this leads me to the belief that it is not
until we are willing to say that we want peace more
than economic or territorial or colonial advantages
that we shall have peace.

This has produced the most enthusiastic belief of
our currcnt world, namely, that we serve our own best
interest to the nation above all other. The supreme
good in the mind of the average man is not the building
of peace among nations, but the securing of the ad
vantages of his own nation before that of any or all
other nations. As long as this is true every man is the
raw material of an army and popular psychology sup
ports our own economic nationalism in a tendency
toward international strife. It will not be until we are
ready to put international good above national ad
vantage that we shall be prepared for peace.
The first advance on the road to peace is to recog
nize its cost. Peace is an easy word to praise, but a
costly one to live with. Nevertheless, it is only on the
keeping the peace that we shall achieve those goals
that set men free. There is no other way. There is no
cheaper way.
