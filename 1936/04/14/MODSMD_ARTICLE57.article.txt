An Uncertain Student who plays basketball and
things recently became fascinated by a transfer who
lives in the Union but will shortly change cars for the
Pi Phi house.
This wonderful person effected a moral regeneration
on the Uncertain Student, and he decided to make a
deep impression by asking her to attend the Easter sun
rise services Sunday.
The project was agreed to and plans were care
fully laid. The basketball player set the Phi Delt
alarm clock for 5 o'clock in the morning and went to
sleep, peacefully contemplating when his soul should
rise on Easter morning.
The Demon, incarnated in the shape of a godless
fraternity brother, however, came out that night on
the sleeping porch, discovered the phenomenal hour
set for the awakening, and switched of! the clock, de
termined that nothing should rise on the Phi Delt
porch at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, Easter or no
Easter.
Five o'clock came, and the soul made several at
tempts to rise, but the mortal flesh snoozed on.
Meanwhile, at Union square, the wonderful person,
togged out in Easter sunrising vestments, and the
Easter bonnet, had signed out, and stood waiting in
the early morning chill for the soul to call around
for her.
Time passed by. The Uncertain Student did not
appear. Because she had signed out, the wonderful
person could not re-enter , the dormitory.
When the sun finally rose on the beautiful Easter
morning, it found mortal flesh snoozing on the Phi
Delt sleeping porch, and in a porch swing in the
Union Court.
Easter morning also found a woman eating break
fast in Sequoia dining hall. The last time the Sequoia
roughagers got a filly (remember?) in Sequoia, they
couldn't get her out, and the startled Sequoians who
came in to eat breakfast began to have visions. How
ever, everything seemed to be on the up and up. In
the first place, the gal was from Paly. In the second
place, her host had brought her in for breakfast after
the sunrise service.
Members of the Soph Carnival committee spent
their Easter morning undoing Easter eggs from the
B.A.C.'s new handball courts. It seems that the
Carnivores had expressly promised the B.A.C. that
they would provide adequate protection for the courts
behind the egg-tossing booth. The committee mem
bers had counted on the target stopping the eggs, but
he ducked too well. Besides, the egg-throwing
branched out and several of the boys started free
lancing, as Swampum Barnes would say.
When the sun rose Easter morning, the Carnivores
found the hot courts had cooked a likely looking
omelette. ,
From this the committee deduced that some of the
Easter Eggs had been pretty fried the night before.

things recently became fascinated by a transfer who
lives in the Union but will shortly change cars for the
Pi Phi house.
This wonderful person effected a moral regeneration
on the Uncertain Student, and he decided to make a
deep impression by asking her to attend the Easter sun
rise services Sunday.
The project was agreed to and plans were care
fully laid. The basketball player set the Phi Delt
alarm clock for 5 o'clock in the morning and went to
sleep, peacefully contemplating when his soul should
rise on Easter morning.
The Demon, incarnated in the shape of a godless
fraternity brother, however, came out that night on
the sleeping porch, discovered the phenomenal hour
set for the awakening, and switched of! the clock, de
termined that nothing should rise on the Phi Delt
porch at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, Easter or no
Easter.
Five o'clock came, and the soul made several at
tempts to rise, but the mortal flesh snoozed on.
Meanwhile, at Union square, the wonderful person,
togged out in Easter sunrising vestments, and the
Easter bonnet, had signed out, and stood waiting in
the early morning chill for the soul to call around
for her.
Time passed by. The Uncertain Student did not
appear. Because she had signed out, the wonderful
person could not re-enter , the dormitory.
When the sun finally rose on the beautiful Easter
morning, it found mortal flesh snoozing on the Phi
Delt sleeping porch, and in a porch swing in the
Union Court.
Easter morning also found a woman eating break
fast in Sequoia dining hall. The last time the Sequoia
roughagers got a filly (remember?) in Sequoia, they
couldn't get her out, and the startled Sequoians who
came in to eat breakfast began to have visions. How
ever, everything seemed to be on the up and up. In
the first place, the gal was from Paly. In the second
place, her host had brought her in for breakfast after
the sunrise service.
Members of the Soph Carnival committee spent
their Easter morning undoing Easter eggs from the
B.A.C.'s new handball courts. It seems that the
Carnivores had expressly promised the B.A.C. that
they would provide adequate protection for the courts
behind the egg-tossing booth. The committee mem
bers had counted on the target stopping the eggs, but
he ducked too well. Besides, the egg-throwing
branched out and several of the boys started free
lancing, as Swampum Barnes would say.
When the sun rose Easter morning, the Carnivores
found the hot courts had cooked a likely looking
omelette. ,
From this the committee deduced that some of the
Easter Eggs had been pretty fried the night before.
