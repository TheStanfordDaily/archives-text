## "I'SE A MUGGIN' AN' FACIN' THE MUSIC" 
### 
Back in the days when tunes were ■
just tunes and you played them
yourself, a squeaky violin, grand
pap's bass fiddle and ma's piano

constituted an or
chestra what was
an orchestra. It
had a repertoire i
of five and a half t
selections, it 1
sounded like En
cina the last night
of spring quarter,
but it made cred
ible music and itfl
was heard, not!
passively listened*
to.

God knows none
of us would by choice return to that
fire side substitute nor the tunes it
played. But if God should give us
choice between Dorsey and the
home-cooked outfit, we should take
Dorsey not because we loved him
more but because we could stand
him better.

Blame it on the times, blame it ;
on the administration, blame it on
my youth, but the fact remains that j
the indefinable stuff of music is to j
most of us nothing but noise—pleas- ,
ant noise, but noise nevertheless.
Witness that eminent levee who
lean nightly at Beltramo's hearing !
the "Bed Spring Blues" and "One j
Night (Oh Chiquita, Oh Stuff) in I
Monte Carlo," played simultaneously I

lon radio and phonograph. Do they
wince, squirm or swear? No, sir,
I they just get mellower and mud
dler.
Take the same flock of audience
| and have them leaning over Busi-
I ness Law in the University's mon
{ asteries. Music will be there but
j still only as auditory background.
The best of the bands can literally
! blow their brains out on a l'azz-'m
taz break, and our monkish friends
! don't even knqw what happened.
The simple-syrup "Goody-goody"
| blends in their consciousness with
j the distinguished "Let's Face the
! Music and Dance."

There are those of us who al
legedly see a certain artistic merit
in songs of the day. To fill our own
cultural gaps we elevate the "Pig
Meat Strut," perhaps not unjustifi
ably, to the rank of negro folklore—
the sort of thing Dvorak might have
j held at the end of a 10-foot pole
I while lining up the New World Sym-
I phony.
But there are others, and we mean
! the majority, who don't give a damn
whether it's "Hold That Tiger,"
| "Uhhhh," or "Good-night Sweet
i heart," so long as it's noisy, rhyth
mic and continuous.
If and when they go to their re-
I ward, we prescribe the New York
; Philharmonic giving hell to an eter-
I nity of all-Bach.
