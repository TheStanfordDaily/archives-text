# APT, YET UNJUSTIFIED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial squib about the:
selection of the "June Moon" cast
was appropriate, although not en
tirely justified.
It was appropriate because it in- !
volves sound criticism. And to my j
remarks about it I hope you can
give some publicity for the sake of
Stanford dramatics. Persons who
are interested will find that I am
very sympathetic toward neophytes.
Beginning next fall, when I assume
my duties as a regular member of
the faculty, I will give as much at
tention to freshmen and sophomores
as to upper classmen—to novices as
to veterans. It will be a definite
policy to find new talent, as to de
velop the old.
Your editorial is not entirely jus- '
tified in that, for "Paths of Glory,"
about three-fourths of the cast in- j

j eluded inexperienced actors. For
! "June Moon" exactly half the cast
\ is comparatively new—Miss Janet
Dole, Miss Jean Reeder, Miss
Frances Farmer ,and Messrs. Beatty,
1 Barnett, and Goldner.
1 I was in sore need of a few vet-
I erans because the time for produc
i ing "June Moon" is brief, even for
professionals. And then, too, since
Clark, Garred, Crary, Dawson, and
Miss Albertson graduate this June,
it seemed like a fitting gesture to let
them partake together, for the last
time, in an activity to which they
have devoted much effort. To ex
clude them now would be like keep
ing such men as Bones Hamilton,
and Moscrip, and Grayson out of the
Stanford-California football game.
I was pleased with your editorial,
| however, because friendly criticism,
! whether adverse or favorable, will
; always be a great help,
