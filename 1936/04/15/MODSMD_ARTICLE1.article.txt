# New Lake Planned As Stanford Settles Water Difficulties
## Would Provide Irrigation For Farm, Year-Round Playground for Roughs 
### Johnson Hill 
A greener Stanford campus, a new
lake twice as large as Searsville,
Felt and Lagunita combined, pro
viding a year-round resort center,
and an untainted water supply be
came a possibility yesterday when
the University reached an agree
ment with the Bear Gulch Water
Company over water rights of San
Francisquito Creek.
Although the new lake is not as
sured, the University was given per
mission in the contract to construct
it, providing the project is com
pleted in two years.
Would Take a Year
The Administration must decide
within a year whether or not to un
dertake the construction, because
engineers have estimated that it
would require at least a year's work.
Site of the proposed lake dam is
one mile below Searsville, on San
Francisquito Creek, according to
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, who
represented the University in nego
tiations with the water company.
"The lake would cover 5300 acre
feet, and would cost approximately
$400,000," Roth explained. "The dam
would be 95 feet high and approxi
mately 1250 feet long, backing the
creek waters up to the bottom of the
present Searsville dam.
"Figures indicate that there
would be a run-off of 3,151,000,000
gallons of water annually at the dam
site," he said.
Conflict Settled
Under tho agreement, the Univer
sity would sell to the water company
each year a minimum of 200,000,000
gallons of water, which would yield
an average return of 3.85 per cent
on the total investment.
In addition, there would be a
surplus of approximately 347,000,000
gallons which the University may
dispose of in other sales or uses.
This water, it was understood, could
be piped out of the lake to irrigate
arid sections of land for cultivation.
Before the agreement was reached,
the water rights dispute had in
volved Stanford, the Bear Gulch
Water Company, and the University
of California. The latter owns the
property in which springs feeding
San Francisquito Creek are located.
Conflict, Roth pointed out, arose
over the company's right to pump
water from the creek to its reser
voir tank which supplies a number
of peninsula communities.
