Woh Chung came to Stanford from
China two years ago. The first thing
he did was to see Dr. Wilbur about
a job.
"I need a house boy," said the
president. "You're hired."
Some time later a picture of royal
Chinese to be feted in San Fran
cisco Chinatown appeared in the city
papers. One of the men in the pic
ture was Woh.
"If you are of royal blood," Dr.
Wilbur asked him, "why did you
take this position as house boy?"
"My family sent me here to see
what America is like," Woh replied.
"They told me to obtain work with
some good middle-class family."
