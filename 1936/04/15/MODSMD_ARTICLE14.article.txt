Fifty thousand dollars of "print
ing press money," more than that
used in any other collective campus
activity, makes possible your morn
ing Daily, your monthly Chaparral
and your yearly Quad.
The sum is enormous, but printing
is an enormous business with a fat
wage scale and a sky-high over
head.
» Also relatively enormous is the
"take" of campus editors, advertising |
tycoons, and their helpers—about ;
$7500 per year. But the business of
publication is quite as big as the
amount they earn.
Largest collections and disburse
ments are for and by the Daily,
Stanford's only subsidized publica
tion, which last year collected nearly
$27,000 $7,000 from A.S.S.U. guar- j

The Daily regrets that in yes
terday's article it inadvertently
ascribed a $150 expenditure of

cluded many additional items,

tionery, and miscellaneous
expenses.
