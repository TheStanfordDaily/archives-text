# League Awaits Fascist Terms
## Italy Accused of Using Mustard Gas Bombs 
### 
GENEVA, April 14 (/P). â€” The
League of Nations, once more
wrestling with the Italo-Ethiopian
war, gloomily awaited tonight the
arrival of Italy's peace terms as com
munications were received from
both belligerents.
An Ethiopian note accused the
Italians of gassing 13 Ethiopian
towns. Italy asserted that Premier
Mussolini is freeing slaves in the
African kingdom.
Signed by the Ethiopian delegate
to Geneva, Wolde Mariam, the
Ethiopian communication listed 13
towns and the dates on which they
were supposed to have been attacked
with poison gas.
Part of the note said: "During the
last four bombardments of Quoram
April 4, 5, 6 and 7, the town was
literally drenched with gas. The
gas most frequently used was mus
tard gas."
Color blind drivers can now use
light filters on their windshields to
distinguish red and green.
