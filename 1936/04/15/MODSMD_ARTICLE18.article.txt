# Spring Musical Tryouts Close
## Final Conferences Today From 3 to 5 o'clock 
### 
Today is the last day for singers
and actors to sign up for parts in
"Three Sheets to the Wind." Final
conferences will be held this after
noon from 3 to 5 o'clock in the com
mittee room of the Old Union.
Since the cast calls for more than
40 actors, some of whom are re
quired to sing, no general tryouts
will be held. Separate tryouts will
be arranged for parts that require
only singing, those that require only
acting, and those that call for both.
All men and women interested are
urged not to miss this last oppor
tunity to make applications.
The casting committee appointed
by Barnstormers will include Di
rector Frank O'Neill, Mac Gordon,
Rosemary Benet, and Dramatic
Manager George Lindahl. Assistant
directors on the show will be Bud
Cady and Press Ellington.
