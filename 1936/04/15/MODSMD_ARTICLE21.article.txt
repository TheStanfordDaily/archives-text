# Holloway Urges Students To Pay $2.31 Apiece; Golf Meet Scheduled
## 
### John Rice 
Convalescent Home committee
men today opened fire with well
oiled armaments in an effort to
make this year's drive that oft
vaunted "biggest success ever."
As collections both on and off the
campus begin today and as specially
appointed speakers appear before
the various eating groups to urge
generosity and to explain the or
ganization and activities of the
drive, the Stanford populace is be
ginning to think about the events to
come.
Events Eagerly Awaited
Masque Ball, King-Queen elec
tion, Bean Day, the golf tournament,
and Labor Day are all numbered
among the favorite events in the
spring social activities, and as such
they are eagerly awaited.
Drive Chairman Gib Holloway
urged last night that each student
contribute $2.31 —the amount nec
essary to pay the expenses of one
child for one day—but if this is not
possible to give as much as he can
possibly afford.
Golf Entries Open
Initiating an all-University handi
cap tournament, Don Edwards and
Morse Erskine, co-chairmen of the
Convalescent Home Golf Tourney,
announced that entries for the event
will open today at the golf course
and at the Deke iiousc. The contest
will be in the form of a 36-hole
medal tournament for both men
and women, with two prizes to be
given in each flight.
