PAUL, the genial guy behind the !
cigar counter at Thurlow's, told me |
that Palo Alto merchants aren't
making any money.
"The beer joints and the slot ma- I
chines are taking all of the students' i
money. They haven't anything left '
with which to buy anything in ;
town," he says.
Stanford men and women don't J
spend fortunes on beer, but a stag
{•i ring sum of money slides down the j
slot-machine sewers. And you
haven't got a chance to win. You i
can't beat a machine. Heaven only j
knows that at dice the player has a
little enough chance of winning, but
with a machine that is mechanically
set against you, you just can't win. '
liIJLL SESSIONER McClelland J
has a good gripe about horse racing. (
But a still better gripe are those dev- i
ilish machines. Some 50 per cent J
goes to the house, about 10 per cent ]
to some lucky player, and the rest of !
the nickels and dimes go to big !
sports and gamblers in the East.
When you are about to put a j
nickel in one of those whirling der- |
vishes, stop and say to yourself, l
"I've got one chance in a hundred j
of winning, and all the money I lose
goes to a New York gambler. I am
making him fat with money the old
man gave me to pay my laundry
bill!"
Maybe it would cure you to lose
a lot of money, but a loss never
cured anyone. There always re
mains that hope for a jack-pot that
seldom comes. Meanwhile your bills
go unpaid and you hate yourself for
being a sucker for some bloated pig
controlling those devices.
WE CALIFORMANS should get
acquainted with Japan's new pre
mier - Koki Hirota. You'll hear a lot
about him if a crisis arises one of
these days. And thei'e is nothing as I
prevalent as crisis in the Far East.
Hirota is what is known to polit
ical observers as a "common sense
diplomat" and a renowned concilia
tor. Hirota says, "I have no defi
nite policy for the settlement of
diplomatic affairs other than the use
of common sense."
Hirota's appointment was satisfac
tory to the army and the capitalists,
the nationalists at home and the
Chinese officials abroad.
He is not outstanding. He can
not be classified as'belonging to any
particular creed or group. He has
never done anything sensational. He
has won his following by quietly in
spiring trust in his ability—an abil
ity as yet unrevealed. Common
places are typical of his speeches,
( yet commonplaces seem remarkable j
if they come from him.
He is neither this nor that. He is I
a Fabian. He is not afraid to fight, j
but he believes it saner not to risk |
a political battle when avoidable be- |
cause he feels that objectives of an J
undefeated man can still win fol
lowers but those of a defeated man ;
die with him.

IIIROTA'S METHOD S are Uiose
of compromise. Whether his meth
ods can calm the conflict among the
forces that have brought a crisis in
Japan's national life no one c;fn pre
dict. Nor can anyone see what effect
his means will have in coping with
the international problems that con
front Japan.
But his methods are novel to us
Occidentals who have always be
lieved Japan to be controlled by un
flinching militarists or astute parlia
mentarians.
