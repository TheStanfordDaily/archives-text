# FRENZIED FINANCE

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has come to the attention of
these two overworked "gravy en
gineers" that the world's funniest
newspaper is conducting a campaign
which wi'l get at the bottom of
various financial outrages which are
taking place in this fair estate of
ours. It is our honest opinion that
the purpose of a newspaper is to
present uncolored, unbiased and
TRUTHFUL news. The four page
throwaway which appeared April 14
seems to have missed this very vital
point.
In the first place, the $149.80 "Ex
Committee party" was a bit of fiction 1
which was obviously conjured up in
the sacred sanctuary of our noble
paper. An accurate check of the
existing records (A.S.S.U. audit)
will show that the party represented
a total investment of $37.50. Which
is however a minor mistake of only
$112.30. This party for Ex Com
mittee was really a tremendous
affair compared to one party given

for last year's Daily staff which cost
the good people a mere $141.08.
Another hint which might lead to
the cleaning up of somebody's own
backyard refers to a small matter
which was omitted from the worthy
dispenser of private opinion which
appeared on April 13. Our gentle
men of the press attempted to show
the distribution of the $15 commun
ity fees. They neglected to mention
that $7238.00 o£ last year's fees were
donated to the needy and to the de
serving: to-wit (legal phrase), the
Stanford Daily.

(Editor's Note: The "world's
funniest newspaper" frankly ad
mits the truth of the figures pre
sented. but believes the financial
czars of the world's funniest hu
mor magazine and the all-Amer
ican yearbook have swerved way
off the track in their insinuations
and implications. As to the "own
backyard" reference, the self
alleged "gravy engineers" seem a
bit super-sensitive — however,
they can rest easier with the
promise that the Daily, having
implicit faith in human nature,
has no intention of raking muck in
the offices of its journalistic col
leagues.)
