## MUCH ADO ABOUT DOPING DISTANCES 
### 
They are stili consuming great i
reams of scratch paper, as Dick
Friendlich has already pointed out, j
in juggling and haggling over second
and third places in the Tribe-Troy ■
dopefest.
Just to make a central subject, let |
us take the distance runs.
If one coach is.1 better "Old Fox"
and master strategist, his team can
win ali three of the distances, while 1
the other coach butches horribly.
First off, Nimmo should win the
mile. If he runs like he did last |
Saturday he will. With a week's ,
improvement and th< i added com- 1
petition the slight, fleet Hollywood |
boy can do a mile in 4.1(5. Even I
if the Dean casts Lanlz for Chuck's !
rival, Charles Colvin Nimmo j
should get the blue ribbon.
The half rightfully belongs to 1
Johnson and Cassin of Troy. Both '
are under 1.54, with Nimmo a sec- j
ond behind and McCurdy and Mal
lott three seconds astern.
Ed Burrows in the two-mile is the I
logical choice, especially if Lantz 1
runs the mile. Burrows jogged 10 [
flat in the scorching .sun last week, j
and with three seconds off on each j
lap, more or less, can trim any j
Trojan going; it is time for the lank 1
sophomore to abandon the restraint !
of modesty and break 9.40.
