# DINK STILL KNOWS which way to turn
## 
### 
A little thing came up Saturday
morning—an incident that was wit
nessed by not more Ihari three souls
—proving that Dink Templeton, the
storied "Boy Mentor" of champion
.ship track and field teams, has not
lost the old grip after four and one
half years of ailment, but even
showed that he is the more shrewd.
Dink these fine spring days is
truly showing more ginger out at
Angell Field than for most of the
time within the memory of the
present college generation. He
ambles about the field like he
used to on the same (but un
improved) Angell oval when he
was a high jumper and broad
jumper for post-war Card teams.
In fact, he hints once in a while
that he can heat George Tharp in a
100-yard dash.
But, pardon the digression, the
aforementioned incident. Dink an
swered the plea of Bob Jones, ex-
Card discus star, to come down to
the discus area to find out why Bob
was in a slump.
Dink trots down and watches
Bobby whirl a few out. He sees
immediately what's wrong.
"Just look back when you spin,
Bob," he drawled. "The way you're
doing il now all co-ordination and
balance is impossible."
So Bobby tried the words of
wisdom, and lo he got out a toss of
1.IS feet. 15 feet farther than he
luid done for weeks.
Whereupon Dink climbed up out
of the trench, muttering a few
pleased words about, "Yep, I guess
the old master can still show 'em
what's what"—or words to that ef
fect-- at least so the report goes.
