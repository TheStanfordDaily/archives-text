# Fraternity Sings, Exchange Meals To Be Discussed
## Interfraternity Council To Consider Newly-passed Rushing Rules Tonight 
### 
A different system for conducting
exchange dinners and a renewed
discussion of the recently passed
interfraternity rushing rules will be
the chief features of tonight's In
terfraternity Council meeting, to be
held in the Beta house at 7 o'clock.
During the past week, the much
discussed plan for interfraternity
exchange dinners has been brought
to an abrupt termination by alumni
powers of the Interfraternity Board.
Jud Crary, present member of the
board, and Dr. W. W. Behlow, one
time official of the board, have sug
gested that the spontaneity of the
individual houses t in promoting ex
change dinners was of vital impor
tance.
In addition tu rehashing the ex
change dinner situation, the council
will be informed as to the results of
the investigation about interfrater
nity singles, which Bob Hoover,
president of the council, has been
carrying on. Hoover is presenting a
man well informed on the subject
to give council information.
When the rushing rules were
passed by the council at their pre
vious meeting, a slight revision of
the Friday evening house closing
time was made. The council de
cided that an 8 o'clock closing time
was sufficiently late and made that
change in the rules.
However, the board feels that
compulsory early closing hour will
defeat the purpose of the original
rule i-evision, that of creating a more
informal spirit among the rushees
and house men. This evening the
council and board hope that any dif
ferences of opinion about the rules
which exist between them will be
ironed out for once and all time,
according to Hoover.
