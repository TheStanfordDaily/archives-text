# Saturday Tank Meet Here Will Star Gilhula
## 
### 
Jimmy Gilhula, holder of 13
world's records at one lime or an
other, leads the onslaught against
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate swim
ming records Saturday afternoon
when the four fast teams from
Stanford, Cal, Southern Cal and
U.C.L.A. thresh it out for suprem
acy of the Southern Division of the
conference here at the Farm.
Trojans Favored
The Trojans with Gilhula, Frank
Kurtz, John Paulsen, Roger Hatch,
and Bud Park are expected to find
little trouble swimming away with
top honors. Gilhula was co-captain
of the American swimming team that
traveled to Japan last summer, and
he is considered today one of the
United States' best hopes for turn
ing back the Nipponese ihis year at
Berlin.
Gilhula will swim in the 220, the
440, and probably the free-style re
lay. Kurtz is the Coast Intercol

legiate diving champion and the man
who took third in the 1932 Olympic
Games platform event. Paulsen
swam the breast-stroke for Amer
ica in the Games.
Wersun To Star
Two marks to be shattered most
completely Saturday arc the 200-
yard breast-stroke and the 300-yard
medley relay. With Paulsen at his
heels all the way, Jim Werson of
California will glide through the
distance seconds better than Stan
ford's Bob Foster's record of 2.35.4.
In the Big Mi'et last week Werson
clipped four second.; from that
mark, and he was at no time being
pressed. Park, Werner, and Hatch
are favored 1o take the medley relay
for the Trojans in record-making
time.
The meet begins at 2 o'clock Sat
urday, and track results will be
announced after every event at Los
Angeles. Admission will be 25
cents.
