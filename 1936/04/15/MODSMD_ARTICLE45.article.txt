Those 70 children whose health became tlie
concern of Stanford when they were taken
into the care of the Convalescent Home might
gaze in wonder if they could see the furor and
activity accompanying the drive for their ben
efit which ollicially starts today.
And if, as they watched the enthusiasm over
the King-Queen contest, Masque Hall, Water
Carnival, Labor Day, and Junior Carnival,
they should say: "This can't all be for us,"
they would be right in one sense at least.
It's true that the most ingenious types of
hullabaloo conceivable to a hullabaloo-con
scious campus have been developed to gi't the
students to loosen up once a year for the bene
fit of the Convalescent Home, and it's true that
the profits from the ingenious fund-raising
devices go exclusively to help the kiddies re
gain their health.
Hut no one can fool himself into thinking
and if there weren't more in the Convalescent
Home drive for the students than the feeling
of well-being which accompanies giving to a
worthy cause, there wouldn't be much of a

Convalescent Home.
The drive virtually is the Farm's Fourth of
July. It is the fireworks of a diverting week of
recreational activity and the fiesta spirit
which descends on some of the major events
that are looked forward to by the students. It
is one of the few thinys that can really draw
the student body together.
Hut just as most persons are at least half
conscious that the Fourth is an historical com
memoration day, so do most students remem
ber that their part in Convalescent Home drive
week is beneficial to some very deserving chil
dren.
If il conies right down to the question of
who gels the most benefit from the drive, a
question arises. The kiddies over in the Home
get fbe benefits of financial aid, but the stu
dents gel the comparable benefit of the most
entertaining series of on-cainpus functions of
the year.
So Ihe kids can look over at the students
and say: "Thanks for the help," and the stu
dents can look back and reply: "Thanks for
the opportunity." And they both mean it.
