# Water Rights May Open Way To Fertile, Green Campus
## 
### 
When the University yesterday signed an
agreement on water rights which may make
practical Ihe construction of a lake-forming
dam on San Franeisquito creek, it brought
visions of literal green pastures to many a
dei)lorer of dust-dry campus expanses.
(>f course the mere signing ol' the agreement
doesn't mean that the big lake is something to
he counted on. hut it is a possibility and within
a year the University must decide whether
or not it will be built.
ll' it is built, arid lields and hillsides could
be irrigated and planted in alfalfa, and the
areas of formal gardens and groves could be
extended to make of the Farm a campus sec
ond to none in natural beautv.
