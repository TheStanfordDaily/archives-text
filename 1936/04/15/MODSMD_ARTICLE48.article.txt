According to H-mcn advices from the front, and
back, the Alpha Phi-Alpha Delta Phi rapprochement
is continuing unabated.
A red-headed Alpha Delt hasher came booming out
of the dining room before noon one day last week,
swearing a gun-metal blue. Surprised ho was when he
Hushed a covey of Alpha Phis who were timorously
decorating the fraternity living room with flowers.
This led to further innocent fun between the
houses that used to be bitter enemies. After the
formation of a joint flower committee, executives of
both tongs got together and planned for further volley
ball games and hinterland picnics.
The whole Alpha Delt house was dark and de
serted over the week-end as all the brothers scoured
the countryside on Alpha Phi picnics.
This has lead to complications, however, because
this Friday night brings the Alpha Phi formal. And
social standing around the Alpha Delt house depends
<*i being asked across the alley.
A "form" chart has been posted in the hall, and bets
are being laid at varying odds. Every time the phone
rings, sophomores actually answer it, and rumors send
the odds up and down. At 10 and 12 o'clock every
night there is a deadline and new data is issued, with
consensus selections which say peculiar things, such
as: "Fast on the home stretch," or "a great mudder,"
or "this nag belongs in front of a beer wagon."
Then everybody gathers round and laughs and
laughs.
Poly Sci Prof. J. A. C. Grant was explaining length
ily to a class about the legislation attendant to the
Prohibition Amendment. He covered the subject so
thoroughly, however, that by the time the hour was
over he hadn't got around to Repeal. But a gal in the
back of the room was not to be denied. "And what
happened then?" she asked as the bell rang.
Replied Unconditional Surrender: "Haven't you
heard? Haven't you tasted any of it?"
At Castilleja school for young ladies, many deserv
ing Stanford students hash. Two of these deserving
hashers until a few days ago were Kappa Alpha
gentlemen. It seems that these men suddenly severed
their connection with the Castilleja kitchen, when it
was discovered that they had been aiding several of
the young ladies to escape the rigorous confinement
of the school at 3 o'clock in the mornings.
"I'se a Smuggling" sang the hashers. "1-2-3-4-5-6-
uin-um."
"8-y-woof-wuof," i>ang the superintendent.
