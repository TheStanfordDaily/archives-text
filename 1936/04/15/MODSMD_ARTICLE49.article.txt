One editorial submitted to the Fddic Cantor
peace contest was ruled out partly because
the writer forgot to include his name and
address. 11, however, hit the nail on the head
and was considered among the lirst half-dozen
best works submitted. The editorial:
Dear luldie Cantor,
I know a German boy and a Hussion girl
and I know a Japanese and two Italian boys
and they are awfully nice and I think: if every
one knew how nice folks from other countries
are. then they wouldn't want to fight and so
America wouldn't yet into war.
i J lease send the prize money to my sister
cause I'm going to be a pirate ami don't want
to yo to college.
Willi love,
Bon mi:
