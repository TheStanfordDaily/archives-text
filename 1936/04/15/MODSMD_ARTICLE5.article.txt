Waterfront employers of San Fran
cisco severed relations with the
International Longshoremen's As
sociation local yesterday, charging
it with persistent violations of the
1934 arbitration award. The ac
tion came as a result of longshore
men's refusal to work the Grace
liner, Santa Rosa, which they
termed "unfair."
Harry Bridges, local longshore
men's leader, last night charged
the employers with violating the
arbitration agreement by starting
a "lockout."
Col. Frank Knox stepped ahead at
an almost two to one pace over
Senator William Borah last night
in their duel for the Illinois Re
publican primary vote.
Former President Herbert Hoover
said last night President Roose
velt's newest advocacy of shorter
hours for increasing employment
was "a most desirable end" but
that it had failed two years ago as
an emergency measure. Hoover
suggested a program for putting
long-term capital to work as a
means of drawing workers back
to jobs.
In Washington, the Republican
high command and the American
Liberty League termed Roose
velt's suggestions "impossible" and
of doubtful legality. Democrats
came forward in praise of the
idea.
William Randolph Hearst was term
ed "a hitch hiker on the Landon
band wagon" by Kansas Editor
William Allen White last night.
"So far as I am personally con
cerned," said White, who supports
Landon, "I believe that Hearst as
an ally of any politician is a form
of political suicide."
Great Britain and France may clash
