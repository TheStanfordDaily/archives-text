# Students Really Aren't Such a Bad Risk

Suggestions, as a rule, either go by the
board as a result of proven inadvisability or
they are adopted.
Neither of these fates, however, has come
to Tin-: Daily's suggestion that the Union set
its check-cashing maximum at $f> instead of
*2. The Union Hoard of Governors evidently
has ignored the proposal; students still must
trek lo Paly banks or stores in order lo avail
themselves of enough ready cash to finance an
evening's entertainment.
II the cashing of larger checks would be a
great inconvenience, or if il would cause the
Union to assume an unjustifiable risk, then il
would be inadvisable. But the keeping of
slightly larger sums of cash in the <Vawers to
cover the larger checks can hardly be termed
much of an inconvenience for a business run
for the benefit of the students.
Last year, the Students' Organizations
Fund reports show, the Union collected
$289.25 in linesâ€”lines for bounced checks.
And during the same period it lost just >$ fi
from bad checks.
