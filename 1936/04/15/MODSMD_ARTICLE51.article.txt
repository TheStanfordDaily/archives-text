## Male Warblers

(From the Syracuse Daily Orange)
What has happened to the all-University men's
: singing contest which was scheduled to get under
way before spring vacation?
* # *
While the women are practicing poise, posture, and
walking—with some accent on the voice, Ihe men sit
back, listen to Rudy Vallee and whistle. Fraternities
and living centers, it has been said, are ready and eager
to show male superiority; thoy are willing to co
operate to squash any notions that women might pos
sibly have better voices.

Since the times when the playful little Dinosaurs
I used to sit down by the ole swimmin' hole and pcace-
I fully chirp their song of good-will, the contest as
whether male or female possesses the best voice has
i been going on. Little Robin red-breast, so seldom a
! visitor in Syracuse, has also entered the competition.
Maybe Frankenstein couldn't sing, but he was
i only one man. Look at Caruso.
So, men of Syracuse, dust off the voices and sing
j —while the rest of the campus faces the music.
