## BREAKING THE NEWS TO THE FROSH 
### 
High school big shots they are
when they first climb Encina's steps.
Self confidence and egotism fairly

shine in their
faces as thoughts
of new worlds to
conquer quell
I those first trem
j ors at facing the
ib i g University
j alone. And if no
I one paid them any
! official heed, they
| would be none
' the less happy
j and probably flat
l tered to think
I i-T a. i 1

I that they were
i considered knowing enough to get
' started without someone taking them
by the hand.

But the new-hatched Stanfordites
j are to be taken by the hand if any
, thing comes of the present move for
a pre-registration orientation period,
i Before the fledglings of the Class of j
j '40 Ilex their wings for a first flight I
i into the turmoilous atmosphere of j
i activities .athletics and academics, \
they may be expected to open wide 1
! their fledgling beaks while choice j
! angleworms of advice and instruc- j
i tion are dropped therein by fatherly
I sponsors and grandfatherly faculty
1 men.

To say that September freshmen
J don't need advice or guidance would ;
be like disagreeing with Prof. La-
Piere on the matter of human help- ;
lessness at birth. But the correct
preachment to give them and the
effective way to present it is another !
matter. What very likely will hap
j pen is something which has already
been suggested. The incoming frosh \
j will be treated as a great mass of
j raw material to be moulded by tell- ;
ing them that "Stanford men do this
I and that," and "Such and such just !
| isn't done at Stanford." Conformity j
to the old — discouragement to the
.
new!
* ♦ *
Of course it would be wise to tell |
| the first-year men that it is tradi- '
tional for them to fight with mud and
water, shout to hell with the class
above them, gripe about the Com- 1
! mons food, break furniture, go out j
with only frosh women, and try to '

puil wool over sponsors' eyes—just
in hopes that they will rebel at doing
the usual things. And they should
be tolu about the two or three es
sential traditions, the fraternity
rushing rules, and how to get into
activities.
* * *
But if the pre-registration com
mittee, or whoever runs the show,
thinks that the objective is to pound
home the several dozen quaint local
mores and folkways which if im
planted into a student's code of be
havior will make of him a typical
Stanford man, or to present the
present crop of upper-classmen as
ideal Stanford types, then pitiful is
the fate of future freshmen. For it
is not impossible that awe-struck
frosh might take the "such and such
just isn't done at Stanford" philoso
phy seriously, and the desirable pos
sibility of new "such and suches"
would be impaired.
* * *
An attempt to keep student life in
a state of easy going and familiar
inertia by preaching conventions to
freshmen could hardly be tolerable.
