# French Waifs Star In Picture Of Paris Life
## 
### 
America neither would nor eould !
make a picture like "LA MATER
NELLE," French film current at
the Clay-International in San Fran- j
cisco.
Acclaimed as one of the best pic
tures produced anywhere last year,

"La Maternelle" tells j
the vital, human
story of the waifs of
the Mont mart re,
cheap night - club
district of Paris. Its
characters, a hun-

died or more French children, live a
sordid life—they're crammed into a
little school in the day time and go
home to ugly garrets at night.
Little Paulette Elambert is unbe
lievably real as Marie, the lonely
gamin whose mother is a street
walker. When she loses her mother
to an "admirer," she develops an in
tense hatred of men. And when
Rose, the tender maid who be
friends her at school, falls in love,
too, she attempts a pitiful suicide. 1
"La Maternelle" isn't a "nice"
movie. Hollywood, if it could find
children like these, probably would
n't make expenses. There's nothing
of the Shirley Temple-Dickie Moore
element in these youngsters of the j
Montmartre. They are dirty and
filthy, but like all children, they
want loving kindness.
France may well be proud of this
film—it's a pi''are of a Paris you
probably know little about.
