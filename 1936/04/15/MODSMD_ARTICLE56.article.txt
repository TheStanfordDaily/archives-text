Lack of standard rates for Quad
space is not the result of favoritism,
Business Manager Chuck Fontius
explained. That classes pay $70 for
two pages, Union Club $75 for four,
is the result of original allocation of
space rates on ability to pay, done
long before the present Quad ad
ministration.
Attempts to standardize have
brought screams from old organ
izations once unable hut now able
to pay more—other screams from
new organizations who point in
fury to lower rates of some old
organizations. Quad needs the
space charge to defray expenses.
Quad's top salaries are $50 per
month, to Editor Don Hanson and
Business Manager Chuck Fontius.
Managing Editor Virginia King re
ceives $10 per month, John Loomis,
stafl accountant, $15 per month.
Profits under $1700 are split 30 per

tius, 5 per cent to each of four jun
ior managers—Bob Wright, Clinton
Scott, Polly Mannon and Margaret
Lazz-irone, 20 per ccnt to the Quad
