Councils in instructing frosh. A
J committee to investigate the plan
will include Gordy Mallatratt, Don
Pierose, Jean Reynolds, Mary Craig,
| Irvin Jorgensen, and Carter Kirven.
JIMMY DORSEY will play at the
; Junior Prom if he can be obtained,
J decided the group. Bids would be
! $3.75 with Dorsey and $3.00 with a
local orchestraâ€”student opinion fa
vored the former, said Chairman
Frank Taylor.
Bob Gros, student manager, be
lieved that the dance might possibly
run a deficit as Dorsey would cost
$900, and had turned the measure
over to Ex Committee for final de
cision.
