"~y NUBS in GREY, /

V ~?s I I
Our shirt designer perceiving
the popularity of Irish Donegal tweeds,
wittingly wiled the weedy weave into
hard wearing oxford cloth (even to
Donegal's bright multicolor flecks
called nubs) and produced NUBS...
sporty shirt sensation. NUBS has our
own design, wide-spread Kent collar
with button-down points. The body
is shaped and preshrunk, and tubbing
won't affect the three colors .. $2.50
