(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth in a series of articles ex
plaining the collection and dis
bursement of student funds.)

Take $30,300, divide it among four
classes, 19 clubs, four engineering
societies, 33 honor societies, and
you have a young fortune and a lot
of bookkeeping just to make every
body happy.
For it was just that amount
campus organizations took in last
year from A.S.S.U. and from mem
bers.
CLASSES
Why the Class of 1935 should use
about $3,200 isn't hard to under- |
stand, but how did the frosh dis
pense their collection of about $1,190
The best they could do, according
to the Organizations' Fund report, j
was to spend $50 on the mudfight, 1
581.29 for "Miscellaneous" and $16.69
for accounting. That wild splurging j

left a balance on hand of about
$1000 which, according to Stanford's
method of carrying through funds
from freshman to senior years, left
the frosh well heeled for the soph
omore year. If they keep on as
sessing themselves, what a senior
ball they can throw!
CLUBS
High-point for the clubs was
Roble, which took in approxi
mately $3000, mostly in the $3 per
girl dues. What did Roble do with
the money?— Well, the gals helped
pay for their late leaves. As a mat
ter of fact, it cost them just $368.50
to be locked out after 12 o'clock.
The University pays for an attend
ant to let em in and out only up to
midnight. If the girls want to play,
they can pay.
Stanford may offer tremendous
social opportunities to worried
mothers of worried daughters, but
it's indirectly papa who pays for
daughter's finishing. Out of Miss
Roble's dues last year came $500
worth of teas, $800 worth of danc
ing, $200 worth of entertainment,
and $73.22 worth of canoeing. And
if little Anna swoons one fine night,
she'll be revived by smelling salts
from $31.19 worth of medical sup
plies, also paid for out of dues. Stu
dent Treasurer Betty Davis will
collect something like $25 a quarter
for her services. 0.K., Betty.
It's much the same performance
with I.agunita and Union Club.
The latter now has a corner on
coin collected from Elm Cottage, i
Madrono, and Mariposa. It cost i
the gals from the swell-elegant
compound by the lake $311.50 to
be locked out last year. Three
hundred dollars went for dinners
and teas and $500 for dances. They
don't faint as much as at Roble,
however, for they used up $10 less
medical supplies. Union gals spent
only $1,470. and there isn't a lock
out charge listed anywhere.
Eneinamen collected $1,700 last
year, spent $1,364 on everything un
der the sun. Billiards cost $5.95
