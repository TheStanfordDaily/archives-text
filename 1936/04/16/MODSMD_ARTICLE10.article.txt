# U.S.C. Meet Entries Named By Templeton
## Twenty-six To Compete In Los Angeles Saturday; Chances Nil for Win 
### Phil Klauber 
Mustering all available fighting
forces, Colonel Dink Templeton yes
terday named the regiment that he
will take with him to the U.S.C.
dual meet in Los Angeles Saturday
—theirs not to reason why but
theirs to go down and make 50
points, if humanly possible.
Twenty-six tracksters will make
the trip, with even money giving
them 43 points, 2 to 1 against their
making 53, while it takes 66 to win.
Those who saw Dean Cromwell's
team in action across the bay last
week have never mentioned Stan
ford's chances of beating the Tro
jans; it just isn't done this year.
Voigt, Dean, Kncuhuhl To (Jo
The sprint and broad jump trio
of Voigt, Dean, and Kneubuhl
should get in the score somewhere,
probably not in the jump, where
Cromwell is three deep.
Klopstock can easily win one hur
dle race, may take both, while
Kingsbury is going down and this
year will earn his trip.
Weiershauser and Dellinger are
Dink's entries in the quarter, while
A1 Cranston may be declared eli
gible in time to compete. Giff Myers,
who stole the show at yesterday's
practice with a 50.7 quarter, second
in his life, may make the trip, may
stay here pending experience.
Half Milers
Malott, Burris, and McCurdy go
down as 880 and relaymen, will be in
their fastest race this year. Bur
rows and Alexander will handle the
two-mile, while Warren Dixon keeps
one thing on his mind these days—
"Beat Zamperini."
Chuck Nimmo will probably get
the drawing room on the car, be
cause if Dink goes after the points,
Chuck is going to be running dis
tances all afternoon. He is a cinch
in the mile or two-mile, may come
out of the fray as high point man.
Entries in Field Events
The weight corps this time con
sists of Reynolds, Hershcy, Levy,
Hurley, and maybe Gribben. Rey
nolds and Hershey are set up in the
shot; Levy beat Carpenter in the
discus a couple of times last year,
but that was last year. Hurley threw

148-5 yesterday to put him in good
second place shape.
Hardin, Carlson, and Stone are
going to Los Angeles to throw the
javelin, and for the ride, while
i Teeny Ginn got the pole vault bid
over Gill. Teeny doesn't know
| whether he's lucky or not.
And last comes the high jump
team of Smith, Luisetti, and John
Moller. Smith should win in Los
Angeles, while Moller and Luisetti
; did 6-2V4 yesterday in the elimina
| tions for the trip. For these two lads
6-2'/4 is a very good leap. They
; are coming along.

| whether he's lucky or not.
And last comes the high jump
team of Smith, Luisetti, and John
Moller. Smith should win in Los
Angeles, while Moller and Luisetti
; did 6-2V4 yesterday in the elimina
| tions for the trip. For these two lads
6-2'/4 is a very good leap. They
; are coming along.
Mustering all available fighting
forces, Colonel Dink Templeton yes
terday named the regiment that he
will take with him to the U.S.C.
dual meet in Los Angeles Saturday
—theirs not to reason why but
theirs to go down and make 50
points, if humanly possible.
Twenty-six tracksters will make
the trip, with even money giving
them 43 points, 2 to 1 against their
making 53, while it takes 66 to win.
Those who saw Dean Cromwell's
team in action across the bay last
week have never mentioned Stan
ford's chances of beating the Tro
jans; it just isn't done this year.
Voigt, Dean, Kncuhuhl To (Jo
The sprint and broad jump trio
of Voigt, Dean, and Kneubuhl
should get in the score somewhere,
probably not in the jump, where
Cromwell is three deep.
Klopstock can easily win one hur
dle race, may take both, while
Kingsbury is going down and this
year will earn his trip.
Weiershauser and Dellinger are
Dink's entries in the quarter, while
A1 Cranston may be declared eli
gible in time to compete. Giff Myers,
who stole the show at yesterday's
practice with a 50.7 quarter, second
in his life, may make the trip, may
stay here pending experience.
Half Milers
Malott, Burris, and McCurdy go
down as 880 and relaymen, will be in
their fastest race this year. Bur
rows and Alexander will handle the
two-mile, while Warren Dixon keeps
one thing on his mind these days—
"Beat Zamperini."
Chuck Nimmo will probably get
the drawing room on the car, be
cause if Dink goes after the points,
Chuck is going to be running dis
tances all afternoon. He is a cinch
in the mile or two-mile, may come
out of the fray as high point man.
Entries in Field Events
The weight corps this time con
sists of Reynolds, Hershcy, Levy,
Hurley, and maybe Gribben. Rey
nolds and Hershey are set up in the
shot; Levy beat Carpenter in the
discus a couple of times last year,
but that was last year. Hurley threw

148-5 yesterday to put him in good
second place shape.
Hardin, Carlson, and Stone are
going to Los Angeles to throw the
javelin, and for the ride, while
i Teeny Ginn got the pole vault bid
over Gill. Teeny doesn't know
