# A.S.S.U. Vote Not Necessary
## Ex Committee To Appoint Grayson's Successor 
### Annalee Whitmore 
What last week was one of Ex
Committee's most flagrant political
maneuvers of recent years died yes
terday of its own volition.
The plan whereby a substitute
could be named for members tem
porarily absent, the cases in question
being Bobby Grayson and the sopho
more woman position, is now unnec
essary. The sophomore woman,
Jackie Brown, returned to school.
Grayson's successor can now be
named in less time than it would
take to hold a special election.
But the by-law still stands. In
teresting vistas of future campaign
nig and vote-forcing are the result.
Bob Gros, at Tuesday's session,
termed it "against the constitution
in spirit if not in letter", and fur
ther suggested that the Dean of
the Law School be consulted.
President Wally Brooke promised
to do so. Question: Will the emer
gency measure, now that the emer
gency has failed to materialize, re
main as a permanent source of
conflict, or will it be settled within
the next week?

A constructive policy on the here
tofore haphazard granting of Regis
tration Dances seems to be in the
making. Ex Committee's move in
giving Cap and Gown the affair, in
order to make possible a second
scholarship, was perhaps the first
time in recent years that the organ
ization appointed as sponsor did not
intend to pocket the take.

Statistically interesting is the !
four minutes spent in voting $25
for the Student Peace Conference,
and one half hour which passed
last week in an attempt to avoid
spending $8 for a special election.
"The best reason for granting
it is that we need the money,"
said Drayton Bryant. The actual
merit of the plan was secondary.
! Little preliminary research had |
been made into the proposed 2-day
pre-registration period for orienta- !
tion of new students. But Ex Com- I
mittee, after dubious discussion, '
agreed to the worth-whileness of
j the plan and actually named an
1 A.S.S.U. committee in investigate.
It was held doubtful if the com
mittee's research will yield any
more facts than did the Vocational
Guidance report of last year. But
that was not the object. A.S.S.U.
prestige, with a working commit
tee, will do much to put across the
j plan, which was all that was want
i ed.
Since the report included a poll I
| of every freshman woman and every !
transfer, outlined possible proceed- j
1 ure during the period, and represen- '
ted a quarter of research, the com- i
mittee probably will peruse the vol- |
uminous survey before smarting one
; of their own.

Since the report included a poll I

What last week was one of Ex
Committee's most flagrant political
maneuvers of recent years died yes
terday of its own volition.
The plan whereby a substitute
could be named for members tem
porarily absent, the cases in question

more woman position, is now unnec

Jackie Brown, returned to school.
Grayson's successor can now be
named in less time than it would
take to hold a special election.

Bob Gros, at Tuesday's session,
termed it "against the constitution

the Law School be consulted.
President Wally Brooke promised
to do so. Question: Will the emer

gency has failed to materialize, re
main as a permanent source of
conflict, or will it be settled within
the next week?

A constructive policy on the here
tofore haphazard granting of Regis
tration Dances seems to be in the

giving Cap and Gown the affair, in
order to make possible a second
scholarship, was perhaps the first
time in recent years that the organ
ization appointed as sponsor did not
intend to pocket the take.

Statistically interesting is the !
four minutes spent in voting $25
for the Student Peace Conference,
and one half hour which passed
last week in an attempt to avoid
spending $8 for a special election.
