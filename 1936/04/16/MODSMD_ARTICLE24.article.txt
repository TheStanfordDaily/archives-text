# Frosh Education Move Grows
## Initiation Period Receives Student-Faculty Okay 
### 
The current proposal to initiate
freshmen and transfer students into
Stanford's curriculum in a pre
registration period of guidance re
ceived additional strength yesterday
as student and faculty leaders
joined in expressing approval of the
plan.
The suggestion provides for a se
ries of conferences between the new
students and groups of upperclass
men, sponsors, and faculty advisers.
Appropriate study plans, class
schedules, the Honor Code, and
Stanford customs could be explained
in these meetings.
Professor E. E. Robinson, acting
president during Dr. Wilbur's ab
sence, said:
"The idea is not a new one; I have
thought, for several years that it
would be an excellent program. In
creased student enthusiasm at pres
ent makes the possibility of its adop
tion doubly strong."
