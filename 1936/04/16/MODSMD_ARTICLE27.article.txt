# Twenty-seven Women In Royal Nomination List Of Masque Ball Contest
## 
### Hunter Hendee 
With tho.se kiddies at "Stanford's
Own" convalescent home getting
bread-'n'-butter from the profits,
27 fillies of the Farm, Paly High,
Mills, and Callander, Ontario, strut
their stuff tomorrow 'til Wednes
day in the annual penny-getter, the
election for Queen of the Masque
Ball.
Quints To Run
Those five cunning co-stars of
the moving pictures and Mr. Hearst's
front-page, Misses Emilie, Cecilie,
Annette Marie, and Yvonne Dionne
take their curtseys as prospective
queens under the auspices of the
Home-Fire Division of the V.F.W.
and Betty Grover. Unfortunately,
Misses Dionne will run incognito
here at the campus until elected.
Voted most popular girl in her
own tong, Phyllis "Admirable"
Dewey will be floating Paly High
colors in the race. Information was
lacking regarding "Madame X" from
Mills at the time of writingâ€”maybe
you guys know her?
