# Swingin' The News

### Les Squires 
"Gimme re-write, please!"
Reporters jangle bells and pound
Their beats; the quintups sneeze,
The "Santa Rosa" comes to port,
Some movie star proceeds to court,
A movie lenser features ladies
b.v.d.'s,
"Gimme re-write, please!"
# *
"Gimme the News!"
Tom Coakley leaves the Frantic
cold
To take up law, the quintups snooze,
While campus leaders, totaling
twenty-five,
Seek a crown to keep the kids alive,
On Easter Sunday students fill the
pews,
"Gimme the News!"
* * *
"Copy! Boy!"
The track team meets the Trojans in
The south; the quints are acting coy,
Stanford plans a lake to swim in,
An added feature for (and by) the
women,
The Hearst Press chases down a red
decoy,
"Copy! Boy!"
* # ♦
"Give it a spread!"
The frosh next year'll start in
Kindergarten; the quintups go to
bed,
The "row" is friendship bent,
And Sophs hold carny's in a tent,
FLASH—"Hearst sees red!"
"Give it a spread!"

Shall we be completely pedantic
For the moment and discuss the ro
mantic
Possibility, the coming election—
Now, there's a theme for introspec
tion,
For it's a fact
That whether a Republican
Or a Democrat occupies the seat,
Boondoggling, taxes, processed meai
Are here to stay.
