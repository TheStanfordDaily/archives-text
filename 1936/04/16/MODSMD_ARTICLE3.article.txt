# Interfraternity Dinner System To Be Set Up
## Council To Draw Plan Of Exchange Meals For House Sophomores 
### George Veness 
Plans for conducting interfrater
nity exchange dinners, which had
been formulated by a committee on
fraternity relations, were last night
approved by the Interfraternity
Council.
After a long discussion over the
advisability of having compulsory
dinners, a plan containing four
salient features was passed.
The plan as it was passed—
1. A schedule to be drawn up by
the committee each week, pairing
off the houses, so that twelve ex
changes will be scheduled.
2. The schedule for each week to
be presented to the house presidents
at the council meeting of the pre-,
ceding week, arrangements as to
day of the week, etc., to be made by
the respective house presidents.
3. The dinners to be held prefer
ably once a week, or at least every
two weeks.
4. The exchange to consist of half
of the sophomore class of each house
exchanging and half remaining at
home. The limitations to sophomore
class also optional with respective
house presidents.
Program To Start
This program will go into effect
the week after next, following the
x - eport of a committee on interfra
ternity sings, consisting of Jack
Craven, Louis Mendelssohn, and
Chuck Wallace, which was appoint
ed by Bob Hoover to make a local
study of a potential "sing."'
In response to a suggestion of the
Interfraternity Board that the
Council reconsider the time set for
closing houses during Friday rush
ing as it was previously passed by
them, it was voted that houses would
remain open until 12 o'clock. An
additional rule reading, "No pledge
shall be binding until formal pledge
day" was added at the request of
the administration for a clarifica
tion of the conditions governing
pledging.

Tom Boothe, chairman of the In
terfraternity Board, informed the
council that the University had
asked for the fraternities to enforce
the initiation scholarship require
ments of pledges, which had become
lax in recent years. This rule re
quires that all pledges—first, are not
on probation at the time of initia
tion; second, must have made at
least a C average the previous
quarter. Records of pledge scholar
ship are to be handled through the
Board.

4. The exchange to consist of half
of the sophomore class of each house
exchanging and half remaining at
home. The limitations to sophomore
class also optional with respective
house presidents.
Program To Start
This program will go into effect
the week after next, following the
x - eport of a committee on interfra
ternity sings, consisting of Jack
Craven, Louis Mendelssohn, and
Chuck Wallace, which was appoint
ed by Bob Hoover to make a local
study of a potential "sing."'
In response to a suggestion of the
Interfraternity Board that the
Council reconsider the time set for
closing houses during Friday rush
ing as it was previously passed by
them, it was voted that houses would
remain open until 12 o'clock. An
additional rule reading, "No pledge
shall be binding until formal pledge
day" was added at the request of
the administration for a clarifica
tion of the conditions governing
pledging.
Scholarship Enforcement
Tom Boothe, chairman of the In
terfraternity Board, informed the
council that the University had
asked for the fraternities to enforce
the initiation scholarship require
ments of pledges, which had become
lax in recent years. This rule re
quires that all pledges—first, are not
on probation at the time of initia
tion; second, must have made at
least a C average the previous
quarter. Records of pledge scholar
ship are to be handled through the
Board.
Plans for conducting interfrater
nity exchange dinners, which had
been formulated by a committee on
fraternity relations, were last night
approved by the Interfraternity
Council.
After a long discussion over the
advisability of having compulsory
dinners, a plan containing four
salient features was passed.
The plan as it was passed—
1. A schedule to be drawn up by
the committee each week, pairing
off the houses, so that twelve ex
changes will be scheduled.
2. The schedule for each week to
be presented to the house presidents
at the council meeting of the pre-,
ceding week, arrangements as to
day of the week, etc., to be made by
the respective house presidents.
3. The dinners to be held prefer
ably once a week, or at least every
two weeks.
4. The exchange to consist of half
of the sophomore class of each house
exchanging and half remaining at
home. The limitations to sophomore
class also optional with respective
house presidents.
