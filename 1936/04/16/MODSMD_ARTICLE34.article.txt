# Air Fraternity Buys Plane, To Elect Head
## 
### Dave Botsford 
When Walter A. Rosenfield was a
sandy-haired little boy in Rock
Island, Illinois, he made and remade j
model airplanes. And as soon as his
father would let him, he took his \
first ride in a real plane.
In fact, he knew all about the j
workings of airships long before he
ever went up in one. His room at j
home was scattered with aviation ;
magazines, engine catalogues, and
air company reports. He lived, ate,
and slept aviation.
Learns To Fly
When he got into his teens he
earned enough money to take lessons i
at the Rock Island airport. And it
wasn't long before he had a student's
permit and was 'soloing' in a friend's
plane up and down the Mississippi !
valley.
Today a tallish, leanish junior in
the Stanford engineering depart- j
ment, young Rosenfield makes the j
Palo Alto airport his unofficial head
quarters, a small Taylor "Qib"
monoplane his unofficial home.
He'd only been on the Farm a short
while when he discovered other
young fellows who, like himself,
were tremendously interested in avi- '
ation. He worked with them in his
engineering labs, '"played" with them
at the airport.
Club Organizes
Last quarter these Stanford flyers j
—about 10 of them—decided they
were paying too much rent on planes. ,
A club like the ones at Harvard and i
other eastern schools would, they I
figured, reduce their expenses and |
sort of band together those of the j
"flying fraternity".
The Stanford Flying Club, long |
just Walt Rosenfield's dream, is to- '

| day a reality. Before spring vaca- j
tion its dozen or so original mem- >
! bers dug down into their jeans and
pulled out almost $1,500. With this
I the Associated Air Service, opera
tors of the Palo Alto Airport, sent a
! man back to Pennsylvania.
Elect Officers Tonight
Last week about 20 men stood on
i the air field and glared into the
! eastern sky. A small yellowish
j monoplane was droning gently to
the ground. It landed and scraped
to a stop. Out of the two-seated
cabin hopped Pilot Fred Harvey and ,
the Stanford flyers cheered. This '
was their own plane.
In a corner of a hanger tonight
these 20 men gather* to elect their
| permanent officers. Walter A. Rosen
: field of Rock Island, Illinois, has a
' good chance of being named presi
! dent.
