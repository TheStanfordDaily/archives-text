# Pop-Off Back In April Chappie
## Comic Magazine To Come Out Next Thursday 
### 
An anonymous contribution by
Peyton Walmsley telling one and all
"How To Get Rid of Prowlers in
Your Garden'' and a soul cry from
A1 Drury, "Yahoo Voice," which
takes phone girls apart but doesn't
put them together again, sound the
keynote of the April Chaparral,
which hits the Quad Thursday,
April 23.
Little Pop-Off is back on the
Farm! This time Chief Charles Hood
fixes it so he winds up heap happy.
The good townsfolk of Woodlake
go into their Bible Corner.
Curt Prendergast scrawls "Fables
of the Farm." Chappie Editor Jim
Copp cackles gleefully on the edit
page and elsewhere.

Rosemary Benet, Fred Clark,
Jimmy Dorsey, Pres Ellington, Bob
Hartman, Dave Leff, George Mc-
Kenna, and Dan Mendelowitz all
crash the shiny paper of the April
Chappie, out one week from today,
Thursday, April 23.

A two-pound mushroom was
found in France recently. |
