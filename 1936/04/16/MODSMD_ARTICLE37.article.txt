## ABOUT POLE-VAULTERS; NINE POINTS FOR S.C. 
### 
Among the skyscrapers of Los
Angeles are Earle Meadows and
Bill Sefton. Thesj two pole-vault
for the Conquering So-We've-Heard
of U.S.C. They both approach
world's records every other Satur- f
day and are zealously conning Ger
man dictionaries already (meaning
that they are prime favorites for
the Olympic Games).
And besides having these two
titans of the bamboo shinny on his
team, Dean Cromwell down at S.C. |
has Day, Fimple, and Hooker, who 1
are known to have cleared 13.G on
good afternoons.
Of course 13.6 is mere warm-up
activity for Meadows and Sefton,
but when you figure that no Stan- ,
ford vaultcr has cleared 13 feet in
competition this year why we'll for
get about how mediocre Day, Fim- J
pie, and Hooker are.
"Tini" Ginn and Sumner Gil! are i
the Card vaulters. Both have nego
tiated 13 feet to their own satisfac
tion, but 12.6 is their usual stint.
Then there is Card jumper Ike
Walsh, who did 12.G consistently in
a Fresno Muscat grape patch, close j
kin to Cornelius Warmerdam's spin- |
arh plot, publicized by Will Con- i
nolly. But Ike finds the competition i
from the Gill-Ginn duo too much.
So we'll have to accord nine points
to Troy in the pole vault Saturday
while Gill and Ginn enjoy the train
ride and get a brisk workout in the
Coliseum.
