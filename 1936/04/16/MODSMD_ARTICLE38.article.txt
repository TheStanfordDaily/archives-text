# NO POLE-VAULTERS; NO SKY-SCRAPERS
## 
### 
Ever since Bill Miller and Bud
Deacon blew the Quad, Dink Tem
pleton has lacked a pole vaulter.
The '37 frosh just didn't have any I
pole vaulter at all. There was Ray
Williamson, who told Bill Elling- |
ton one day that he used to vault a
bit up in Concord. Bill almost had j
apoplexy over the prospect of hav- j
ing a vaulter on the team.
Ray, however, weighed 200 pounds j
and played football and tossed the j
javelin, and when he tried to vault (
one day he shattered most of the j
poles and uprights, so that hope i
folded. j
Then there was Shel Riley, Phi )
Delt. Shel, it seems, got on the I
training table all spring because I
Ellington heard that he used to try j
out for the junior high team down j
in Los Angeles once. But Shel, after
clearing 9 feet a couple of times, |
showed that he had not the stuff !
of which champion pole-vaulters!
are made, and just let it go at that.
