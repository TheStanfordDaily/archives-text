Split in Tucson Last Year
In the first of a two-game series j
played between the same teams last I
November at Tucson, Arizona won
j by the same score, while Stanford i
came back two days later to defeat
Col. A. W. Holderness' team 5-3.
Both teams alternated with the
1 same horses yesterday, so they were j
equally well mounted. Leon Derby
scored both goals for Stanford. War- j
ren Hargraves, Arizona's prodigious
hitter, scored three goals on both
forward and back strokes. Gregory j
i Hathaway, playing in the No. 2 posi
tion, also scored three for the Tucson |
i team, while George Evans at No. 2 i
and George Judson in the No. 3 ;
saddle scored two apiece.
Hathaway Leads Scorers
Hathaway played a fast and hard- !
riding offensive game, and retained j
his position as high-point man for j
Arizona. Judson, who is also a high- |
scorer, was especially outstanding j
on the defensive in yesterday's |
game. Jim Fullerton, m his first
year at Stanford, is developing into
' a strong varsity rider.
