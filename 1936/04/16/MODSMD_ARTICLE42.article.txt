# Swim Season Ends Saturday
## Relay Will Try for Title Of Southern Division 
### 
Stanford's 400-yarcl free-style re
lay team has but one more meet to
swim through before it folds up its
! suits for another year, unbeaten in
I collegiate competition.
j That one more meet comes Sat
urday afternoon at 2 o'clock in En
cina pools against relay fours
which the team of Scatena, MacKen
zie, Godman. and Vibert has beaten
j individually in dual meetsâ€”all that
i remains is to beat them collectively
[ in the Pacific Coast Conference
J southern division championships.
Best diving seen in these Encina
| pools is slated when Frank 'Kurtz
of the '32 Olympics "sails through
the air." Kurtz is the Coast inter
collegiate champion.
Second place honors will be
fought out between Stanford's
Captain Tom Boothe and the man
j who beat him last, week, Farquhar
of California; there will be no "Big
! Meet Jinx" to figure in with Boothe's
| score.

Highway mileage of the world is
in the neighborhood of 9,000.000
miles, of which one-third is in (he
United Slates.
