## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Class Endowment Fund a More Practical Senior Gift Than the Usual Fountain 
### 
The Commemoration Committee of the
Class of '30 shortly will decide what memento
the class will leave as a gift to the University
when it drives down Palm Drive diploma-in
liand.
Among the proposals this group has under
consideration is the establishment of an en
dowment fund under Ihe class's name as a
part of the Stanford Funds, recently inaugu
rated by the Stanford Associates.
This type of direct money endowment to
the University would be such a revolutionary
departure from the traditional Senior gift of
a fountain or memorial bench, that the com
mittee may refer final action on the commem
oration directly to a vote of the class members.
It the endowment is approved, the amount
(roughly $250) budgeted for a class gift will
go into the fund, and committee members
probably will solicit added donations from
some of the more money-laden seniors.
The Stanford Funds plan, copied from
many of the privately endowed universities
of the Fast, is a move to encourage the en
dowments from alumni. Each individual gift
will be acknowledged, and each class will be
credited with its yearly contribution.

As Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, president of
Stanford Associates, explained to Ex Com
mittee and a group of seniors Tuesday night,
the elass gift, if it were in the form of an
endowment, would serve as the foundation for
a fund that would grow more and more rap
idly as the graduating seniors gained distinc
tion and wealth in later years as alumni.
The fund, that is, would he bait for later
endowments. And in the future, even more
than in the past, Ihe University will need the
financial help of its alumni, in order to insure
its progress and growth'.
The Administration, furthermore, is much
better able to decide what new structures it
needs, what investments will be most valu
able, what form of branching out will do the
University the most good, than is any small
body that may choose to leave a plaque or
trophy case as "a gift from the Class of '30."
So the Senior Class would be materially
furthering Ihe University's future —to a much
greater extent than the monetary value of the
$250-0(1(1 it may contribute —by being the first
class to climb aboard and set up a separate
endowment fund, administered by the Hoard
of Trustees, as a part of the Stanford Funds.

of Trustees, as a part of the Stanford Funds.
The Commemoration Committee of the
Class of '30 shortly will decide what memento
the class will leave as a gift to the University
when it drives down Palm Drive diploma-in
liand.
Among the proposals this group has under
consideration is the establishment of an en
dowment fund under Ihe class's name as a
part of the Stanford Funds, recently inaugu
rated by the Stanford Associates.
This type of direct money endowment to
the University would be such a revolutionary
departure from the traditional Senior gift of
a fountain or memorial bench, that the com
mittee may refer final action on the commem
oration directly to a vote of the class members.
It the endowment is approved, the amount
(roughly $250) budgeted for a class gift will
go into the fund, and committee members
probably will solicit added donations from
some of the more money-laden seniors.
The Stanford Funds plan, copied from
many of the privately endowed universities
of the Fast, is a move to encourage the en
dowments from alumni. Each individual gift
will be acknowledged, and each class will be
credited with its yearly contribution.

As Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, president of
Stanford Associates, explained to Ex Com
mittee and a group of seniors Tuesday night,
the elass gift, if it were in the form of an
endowment, would serve as the foundation for
a fund that would grow more and more rap
idly as the graduating seniors gained distinc
tion and wealth in later years as alumni.
The fund, that is, would he bait for later
endowments. And in the future, even more
than in the past, Ihe University will need the
financial help of its alumni, in order to insure
its progress and growth'.
The Administration, furthermore, is much
better able to decide what new structures it
needs, what investments will be most valu
able, what form of branching out will do the
University the most good, than is any small
body that may choose to leave a plaque or
trophy case as "a gift from the Class of '30."
So the Senior Class would be materially
furthering Ihe University's future —to a much
greater extent than the monetary value of the
$250-0(1(1 it may contribute —by being the first
class to climb aboard and set up a separate
endowment fund, administered by the Hoard
of Trustees, as a part of the Stanford Funds.
