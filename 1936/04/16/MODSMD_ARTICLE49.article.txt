# Next Fall's Profits Will Stay on Campus, Anyway
## 
### 
Ex Committee suffered another one of its
strange, conscientious reversals of form Tues
day night, and granted Cap and Gown, wom
en's honorary fraternity, permission to hold
next fall quarter's Reg. Dance.
Cap and down, as in years past, will use
the money obtained for scholarships.
Ham's Head, which lends its name to the
Hig Came Gaieties every year, does not give
scholarships, but has found a new means of
spending Reg. Dance profits.
Ram's Head secured permission to hold the
Winter Quarter Reg. Dance by putting on a
clever skit in front of Ex Committee that
charmed the campus fathers into submission.
From the dance, Ram's Head got 40 per cent
of the net income-â€”s7o. f>o.
Tonight, Rani's Head members hold their
initiation banquet. The members have char
tered a bus, in which all will ride. The bus
will take them to an inn in San Mateo for the
preliminaries. From that spot, the members
will continue on to the Mark.
The cost of the party will be .$70.50.
