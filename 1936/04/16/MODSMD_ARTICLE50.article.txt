# 1,300 Mural Participants Deserve B.A.C. Consideration
## 
### 
That time lias conic when the B.A.C. seri
ously faces the financial tacts and draws lip
its next year's budget. One minor item on the
potential budget the appropriation for in
tramural sports—apparently became of wide
spread concern when the official student body
representative — Kx Committee — resorted to
the medium of resolution Tuesday night.
Informed by President Wally Brooke that
the Hoard had tentatively set intramural's
slice at the usual .$5OO, the executive body
went on record as favoring an increase to
*750. The Hoard will hear the resolution at its
next meeting.
Considering that some 1,5100 students take
part in intramural during the year, and that
*">()() doesn't allow for the best in trophies,
equipment, and officiating, the move by Kx
Committee is obviously justified and seems a
fair expression of student opinion.
Intramural is not, <>1 course, an income
producing sport and docs not deserve the
budget of one. But if the number of partici
pants means anything to the Board as it di

vides up its expense dollars, Ihc re(|iiest for
additional funds will not he disregarded.
