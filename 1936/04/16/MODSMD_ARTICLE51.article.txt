## Learning to Live 
### 
(From the Daily Texan)
The average person thinks that the university's
paramount purpose is to teach students how to make
a better living. Consequently many come here with
the exclusive idea of seeking knowledge to that end,
failing to realize that a higher purpose of the univer
sity is to teach individuals how to live better.
There are so many things in this world which arc
enjoyable. Mixed up with the splotches in life's picture
is a lot of fine color. And the reason a lot of us don't
see anything but the smudges is that we have come to
think that activity is worthless unless it is required or
is materially productive in an immediate sense.
* * * *
Many of us were urged to think in these terms very
early, learned to plf-y marbles for keeps when kids,
and never got out of the tendency to avoid that activity
which does not yield something which can be taken
home in the pocket.
Learning how to relax—take pleasure in super
ficially unproductive activity—is one of the important
lessons of more pleasant living.
One does not have to resolve to be a loafer, in the
highly prejudicial sense of the word, to learn to relax.
There is an art to good idling, the kind which ovcs
your sensibilities a chance to exercise themselves,
affords the setting for the cultivation of an apprecia
tion for beauty and the tendency to look for the in
spirational rather than the sordid things in the pan
orama of society.

The means to pleasant living these days cannot be
completely divorced from the dollar mark. But the
student who abandons or ignores the sources of bene
fit in the idler's art for nothing but the search to
make a better living does himself an injustice. And
what he gets out of the university cannot properly be
termed a higher education.
