# Farm's Peace Day Will Be Mild and Sensible
## 
### 
While the American Student Union is in a
frenzy over its many college peace strikes next
Wednesday, the Farm will quietly assemble
to hear the Socialists' perennial candidate for
the presidency—Norman Thomas.
l»ul because Socialist Thomas is one of the
higher class extremists and demands a small
fee for preaching his doctrine, it's going to
cost Stanford something to hear ils peace
lesson. Ex Committee Tuesday night fooled
the hill with a $2f> appropriation, which is,
as was somewhat ironically pointed out, a
pretty cheap price for peace.
Besides the lecture, Peace Day will have
round tahle discussions sponsored by the
Kami Peace Conference. The day, as a whole,
undoubtedly will prove far more sensible and
effective than the mass walk-outs from classes
which have so closely identified peace move
ments with outright radicalism on many other
college campi.
