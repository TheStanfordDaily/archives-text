Early this year, one svelte freshman with a Con
tinental atmosphere about him, prepared to summon a
hasher for seconds.
"Garcon, oh garcon!" he cried.
Nothing happened, but a very impressed freshman
looked at the linguist.
"Garcon, oh garcon, seconds!" the call repeated.
The hasher, who was a large lug, leered.
The very impressed freshman wanted to be helpful.
"Why don't you try calling him by his first name?"
he said.

They have developed a wonderful device down in
the physics department, and a very complicated ma
chine it is indeed.
It takes hold of alternating current, sinks its hooks
into the passing electrons and whips them into a frenzy
on the hiccoug 1 r, and squashes them on the down
grade slip.
This quite logically and plainly leads to the develop
ment of high voltage. Voltage so high, in fact, that
its potentialities are theoretically limitless.
The wizard, Prof. Hansen, who has this long-stand
ing grudge against the atom was asked by one of the
students if he wasn't afraid that all this power would
kill the animals in the Biology Building.
"To Hell with the animals," said the wizard.
"What I have to worry about is myself."
It is said, however, that the white rats in the psych
