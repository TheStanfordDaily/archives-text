## MAKE 'EM LOOK PRETTY 
### 
It's not an untruthful truism that j
many people look better after being |
made up by the undertaker than
they ever did in their lives. And to
make this an analogy, we advocate !

not publishers
but morticians
for textbooks —
not only because
texts are dead
but because they
are in dire need
of an undertak
er's prettying-up.
Amazingly
enough, book'-l
designers' wh o|
cover an absorb
ing detective
story with a pan-

oply of color and illustrations see i
no reason for giving a facial to !
Dr. Glutz's tome on political science. I
As students buy it, the book is I
about as attractive as Dr. Glutz !
himself. It is bound in dark green 1
cloth. Splashed on the back is a
piece of black paper with the title
and author's name stamped in gold
like the word of God. The frontis
piece probably scares even the
author. The pages are set neatly
and firmly in 10-pt. primer; the
paper is as glossy as Stepin Fechit's
face; the whole thing is as heavy
as a drowned dog.
Dr. Glutz certainly achieved a
funereal dignity perhaps appropriate |

to his life-time of suspended ani
mation in libraries. But Dr. Glutz
achieved about as much reader in
terest as last year's phone book.
* * *
First off, he scares militantly col
legiate students by ringing in a co- I
author, also a Ph.D. Then he excites ,
a cold sweat by telling in what uni- j
versities Dr. Glutz and his colleague
warmed-up for their 500-page cross- j
cover obstacle race. Then he gets I
into the text, which like as not is set
absolutely solid—and here it is mid
night and the student v/ith 50 whole >
pages to read before 8 o'clock. We'll
just dismiss those exquisitely cruel j
footnotes telling in what literary
mausoleums Dr. Glutz played ghoul.
* * *
Now jUst as a psychological dodge, !
we suggest dressing Dr. Glutz's tome
in a snappy red jacket with a draw
ing superimposed on the title. Then
we suggest Dr. Glutz forget his de
grees, and we further urge Dr.
Glutz to insist on a picture every j
two pages—a cut of anything just
to interrupt the heart-breaking con
tinuity of stuff we didn't know 'til
now.
Then, even if we're assigned 75 i
pages instead of 50, we'll feel we
haven't so much to read. We'll ap
proach Dr. Glutz's volume at least
ignorant of his intentions. And we'll
at least lose that dentist's bill feel
ing about paying for it.
