( The Editor, Sir:
After what happened at Berkeley
: last week-end, there is hardly a
: Stanford student who would concede
I the Indians a Chinaman's chance
against the "greatest aggregation of
stars ever assembled at one col
lege" in their dual meet next Satur
i day in Los Angeles. And if the
I members of the team feel that way,
| I wouldn't give them a chance
| either. But. those who are addicted
J to the indoor sport of doping meets
J can assure you that the Stanford
| track team does have a chance
: against the mighty Trojans, IF—and
it is a big if—the individual mem
i bers of the team just won't be
I beaten. We have the potential points
if we can collect them. If the same
spirit that "Truck" Dellinger shows
when he runs a quarter could be
made a team spirit, the Trojans
would have a very busy afternoon
come next Saturday — perhaps too
; busy to make it profitable.
