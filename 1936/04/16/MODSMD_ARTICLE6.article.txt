# Union May Honor Five Dollar Checks
## 
### 
Checks up to five dollars will
be honored by the Stanford Un
ion, if a proposal Boh Gros will
make before the Union Board of
Directors is favorably considered,
he announced yesterday.
Gros' proposal supports the
Daily's requests for larger checks
to avoid student recourse to Palo
Alto merchants for credit privi
leges.
