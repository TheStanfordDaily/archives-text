# Chaplin Battles Turbines In 'Modern Times'
## 
### 
"Modern Times," Charlie Chap
lin's unspoiled battle with technoc
racy is a good show. Time clocks

and turbines present
plenty of problems
for Charlie but he
finds happiness in
the end. The public
it from the first
shot on.

Without the help of sound Chap
lin still is a fine actor. Paulette God
dard, a super-gamin, is rouish and
good looking. Good shots—depart
ment store with Charlie doing the
rounds on skates; and cafe with
songbird Charlie playing ingenue.
