Money is again at the root of evil
as general faculty opinion along
Stanford's tradition-soused arcades
reacted favorably to The Daily's
proposal that the University pub
lish a social sciences journal, but
looked dubiously at the practical re
alization of such a project.
Valuable Work Lost
Affirming the need at Stanford
for a journal of this nature, Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell, head of
the School of Social Sciences, said
that much valuable work of Stan
ford professors was being lost for
lack of publication outlets in the
East. His opinion was, though, that
a large subsidy would be required,
and that some "angel" would have
to be found.
Professor Edgar Eugene Robin
son, head of the history department,
expressed great sympathy for the
plan, saying "I think it is an ex
cellent idea," but questioned finan
cial backing. He considered it im
possible for the University to sub
sidize it itself.
Needs Vigorous Leaders
Dr. John Bennet Canning, pro
fessor of economics, recently elected
head of the Social Sciences Research
Council of the Pacific Coast, and for
several years publisher of the pro
ceedings of the Pacific Economic So
ciety also doubted the financial
practicability of the undertaking,
but said it might become a valu
able thing "if it had a vigorous edi
torial board and a good business
manager."
The Daily has editorially proposed
the journal for the publication of
contributions to thought made by
the academic minds of the Pacific-
Coast region, and particularly here
at Stanford. The journal would be
patterned somewhat on the plans of
The Yale Review, The Virginia, and
The Southwestern Review.
