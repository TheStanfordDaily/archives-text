jUST WHAT THE
DOCTOR ORDERED
The few words and sym
bols which your doctor
uses when he writes a
prescription are vitally
important.
The success of his ef
forts in your behalf may
depend largely upon strict
adherence to these in
structions by the pharma
cist.
At the University Phar
macy your prescriptions
will be compounded
promptly and accurately
exactly as the doctor or
dered.
