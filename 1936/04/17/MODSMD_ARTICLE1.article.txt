# Union Dollar Turned Into Union Profit
## Theater Fund Gets 75% of Yearly Gains, $7,000 Student Dues Included

student funds.)

Except the men's dormitory, every
division of the Stanford Union —cel-
lar, women's and regular dining
rooms, ice cream plant and Encina
store, made a profit last year. The
net gain was $23,000, but only $16,000
was actually earned.
How come? Simply because every
male .student is paying one dollar of

his $15 community fee to the Union,
which neither wants nor needs his
help—paying $7,000 a year to an
organization that made over twice
that much profit on its own hook.
The dollar is listed as "dues," and
time was when it was allocated for
equipping the new Union dining
halls. Today the equipment is paid
for, but a few blocks north another
structure is going up, and being paid
for.
Believe it or not, Stanford's men
arc giving $7000 to the Union to
help finance the new theater.
It's a terrific financial rat-race,
but it isn't as evil as it sounds. It
starts like this:
In 1934, the Union Board of Di
rectors, then including Marvie Kahn,
Ben Cave, Johnny Mottram, and Art'
Azevedo, decided the Union Dollar
should continue to go to the Union,
although that organization had no
pressing use for it. Their decision
was contingent to allocation of 75
per cent of the Union's net operating
profits to the Memorial Theater
Fund.
But although the need for the
Dollar passed when indebtedness
for equipment had been liquidated
and the Union had built up a suffi
cient contingent reserve for emer
gencies, the students asked that it
be continued and allocated to the
theater fund. Today the dollar is
passing through the Union as part
of the organization's legitimate earn
ings, being .spent and returned in the
common course of Union business.
While it is true that in paying
their dollar to the Union 25 per
cent sticks with the University and
doesn't go to the theater, the deal is
in no sense of the word a stick-up
as is popularly imagined.
Students themselves have bond
ed their children by their alloca
tion of the Union dollar to the Un
ion for 1!) years. The construc
tion of the New Theater is con
tingent upon a certain amount of
Union profits, partially accruing
from the student-paid "dues."
In keeping with the University's
policy of getting as much theater
money as possible, ihe Union ice
cream plant, part of the Union or
ganization but also indirectly part of
Stanford, is selling ice cream at a
profit to dining halls serving Encina,
Koble, Lagunita, and the Oaks.
In other words, the University
is taking money from its own dor
mitory food allowances, passing it
through its own Union, and pay
ing for its own theater. The ice
cream plant's charge, however, is
less than that of oIT-campus cream
manufacturers.
As for the women's Union Dollar,
it doesn't go to the Union at all but
to maintaining the Women's Club
house,
The Cellar, Union records showed,
operates on a slim 2¥> per cent
profit, and its prices are at all points
commensurate with those prevail
ing in similar eating establishments
ofi" campus. Division of Cellar oper
ating costs are as follows: labor

32 per cent, food 52 per cent; other
operating expenses (heat, light, etc.),
18 per cent; general expenses, 5 per
cent.
Student workers are paid one
dollar's food per day at retail
prices for two hours work. Their
"food credit" carries over a 15-day
period, but not over the semi
monthly pay days, when books are
closed. There is no overtime labor.
