Three Stanford students and a
C 4.iOs Angeles business man ap
pealed to the China Clipper for
help today when they were
stranded in an open motor boat
near Dumbarton bridge and got it.
Harold A. Sorsby, Kathleen
Bardwell, Elizabeth Stearns, and
Bud Dreyer, formerly of Stanford,
went out in the boat at 11 o'clock,
and were beyond the bridge when
the engine failed. Dreyer started
swimming for the shore after un
successfully trying to attract aid.
â€¢ Meanwhile, the China Clipper
flying overhead was attracted by
the signals and, landing 011 the
bay near a small sloop, advised the
owner, Robert llelmholz of Stan
ford, of the stalled motorboat.
llelmholz and his companions
towed them into the harbor.
