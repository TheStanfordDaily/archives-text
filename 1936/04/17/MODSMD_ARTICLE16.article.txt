# Walls Crumbled, Roughs Tumbled 30 Years Ago

### Hunter Hendee 
Thirty years ago tomorrow morn- |
ing the Farm rolled over, land- '
marks came tumbling down, and we !
had the biggest hcll-weck on tec- ;
ord ... in short, there was an j
earthquake. Stanford, in spite of I
$2,800,000 worth of fallen buildings,
came out very, very luckily.
But Junius R. Hanna, '08, wasn't 1
as fortunate as the 1785 other stu
dents who emerged thinly-clad from
halls and dormitories shortly after
5:18 a.m., the time of the first tremor, i
He and 20 others were buried under I
the wreckage of three floors at En
cina, but he was the only one who j
didn't get out alive.
The real hero was an engineer, or
maybe we'd call him a janitor, whom I
everybody has forgotten. Ho dashed
into the engineering building and
turned off campus electricity, there
by preventing devastation by fire.
But he never got out. He was ;
crushed by a tall stone chimney that
crumbled on top of him as he was |
attempting his escape. His name
was Otto Gerdis, and Stanford stu
dents raised better than $2000 with.

I which to support his mother.
But even the quake had its lighter I
! side. Chaplain Gardner tells a story j
about Dr. David Starr Jordan, then |
! president of the University, and j
' considered a "granddaddy" to sci
ence here on the Farm.
It seems that every chimney was
knocked down that morning, and so
hot coffec and flap-jacks for break- I
fast were an impossibilityâ€”that is, ]
every chimney except the iron one
i on Roble. So the Robleites decided
I to call up the Jordans and invite
them to a sunrise breakfast. The
] Jordans were only too happy to
i accept.
During the course of the breakfast
I Dr. Jordan remarked a well known (
fact that earthquakes come in I
bunches, and that Stanford might j
expect another tremor soon. The I
Hasher heard, as hashers do, and he j
rushed out into the kitchen to tell i
| the Chinese chef the horrible news. '
j "Another quakie, Hash-boy?"
queried the Chinaman, unconcern
edly flipping flap-jacks. "Helly,
i why he not telly us about first one?" ,
