SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (/P).
—Harry Bridges, embattled long
shoremen's leader, tonight accused
the Waterfront Employers' Asso
ciation of "chiseling" and using
"lying" propaganda and claimed in
creasing union support for his cause
in the newly precipitated waterfront
crisis.
The fiery left-winger hinted addi
tional demands for shortening of the
longshoremen's working hours
might be made.
Would Extend Prerogative
He suggested that if waterfront
employers would give his longshore
men a voice in the selection of offi
cers of the organized employers, the
union would "stand ready to extend
a like prerogative to you."
Bridges charged the employers
were seeking disruption of the union
and a return to "company union
slavery" on the waterfront.
The Bridges union received assur
ances of support from the Pacific
Coast District International Long
shoremen's Association, which
claims a membership of 12,000 to
15,000 workers. William J. Lewis,
district president, said the coast
wide organization had no alterna
tive but to stand behind the local
union.
Reader To Co-operate
The employers previously had
announced they would not deal with
the local union, but were ready to
co-operate with the district organ
ization.
Bridges announced a mass meet
ing of longshoremen tonight to hear
"all the details and reasons for your
attempted enforcement of the re
turn of our membership to the com
pany union conditions."
