# Poll On Cranston Due Today; Cinder Men Off For Troy Tonight
## Voting by Telegraph; Indian Hopes for Good Score Tomorrow Climb 
### Phil Klauber 
With the answer on A1 Cranston's
eligibility due a few hours before
train time, Coach Dink Templeton's
Cardinal track squad embarks on
the Lark tonight for tomorrow's
dual meet with Dean Cromwell's
Trojans.
But two votes are known in the
conference poll on Cranston's sta
tus, both U.S.C. and Stanford hav
ing voted to permit him to return
to competition untainted.
Stanford stock has held up well
this past week, and the consensus
now gives the Cards over 60 points
tomorrow if everything goes well,
and with the shaky events colored
a distinct Cardinal. But 60 points
won't win the meet.
Indian Milers Ready
Chuck Nimmo and Warren Dixon
scampered a 3:08.4 (hree laps yes
terday, breaking Nimmo's Stanford
record of 3:09, and indicating that
the Indian mile corps this year is
the best ever. To make it interest
ing, Coach Cromwell has sent up
word that his Freddie Lantz will
enter that race instead of his cus
tomary two-mile. However this re
port, as well as the info that Tex
Milner, leading Trojan javelin man,
is out of the meet with a bum arm,
is thrown into the basket labeled
"Cromwell crud."
Nearly every event tomorrow will
list participants that could place in
any national meet you can mention.
Of the five Trojan world record
beaters in the pole vault enough has
been said. They are tops. But also
the high jump is going to be good,
with Humbert Smith battling the
equally erratic Trojan Delos Thur
ber. It may be won at 6-1, or it may
be 6-7.
Ken Carpenter looks to have Phil
Levy's number in the discus this
time; however, Stanford's Reynolds
and Hershey are set up in the shot.
Both weights will see good marks.
Milner and Thurlow of S.C. are both
200-footers in the javelin, which
mark has not been reached on this
campus this year.
Short Runs All Toss-ups
The sprints are really going to be
doubtful. All that can be said is
that the Trojans are three deep, led
by national champ Foy Draper, and
that Stanford is also three deep, led
by Ray Dean, Chuck Voigt, and Jim
Kneubuhl.
Last thesis is on Sam Klopstock
in the hurdles. You've watched
Sam run for two years; watch him
tomorrow.

With the answer on A1 Cranston's
eligibility due a few hours before
train time, Coach Dink Templeton's
Cardinal track squad embarks on
the Lark tonight for tomorrow's
dual meet with Dean Cromwell's
Trojans.
But two votes are known in the
conference poll on Cranston's sta
tus, both U.S.C. and Stanford hav
ing voted to permit him to return
to competition untainted.
Stanford stock has held up well
this past week, and the consensus
now gives the Cards over 60 points
tomorrow if everything goes well,
and with the shaky events colored
a distinct Cardinal. But 60 points
won't win the meet.
Indian Milers Ready
Chuck Nimmo and Warren Dixon
scampered a 3:08.4 (hree laps yes
terday, breaking Nimmo's Stanford
record of 3:09, and indicating that
the Indian mile corps this year is
the best ever. To make it interest
ing, Coach Cromwell has sent up
word that his Freddie Lantz will
enter that race instead of his cus
tomary two-mile. However this re
port, as well as the info that Tex
Milner, leading Trojan javelin man,
is out of the meet with a bum arm,
is thrown into the basket labeled
"Cromwell crud."
Nearly every event tomorrow will
list participants that could place in
any national meet you can mention.
Of the five Trojan world record
beaters in the pole vault enough has
been said. They are tops. But also
the high jump is going to be good,
with Humbert Smith battling the
equally erratic Trojan Delos Thur
ber. It may be won at 6-1, or it may
be 6-7.
Ken Carpenter looks to have Phil
Levy's number in the discus this
time; however, Stanford's Reynolds
and Hershey are set up in the shot.
Both weights will see good marks.
Milner and Thurlow of S.C. are both
200-footers in the javelin, which
mark has not been reached on this
campus this year.
Short Runs All Toss-ups
The sprints are really going to be
doubtful. All that can be said is
that the Trojans are three deep, led
by national champ Foy Draper, and
that Stanford is also three deep, led
by Ray Dean, Chuck Voigt, and Jim
Kneubuhl.
Last thesis is on Sam Klopstock
in the hurdles. You've watched
Sam run for two years; watch him
tomorrow.

Levy's number in the discus this
time; however, Stanford's Reynolds
and Hershey are set up in the shot.
Both weights will see good marks.
Milner and Thurlow of S.C. are both
200-footers in the javelin, which
mark has not been reached on this
campus this year.
Short Runs All Toss-ups
The sprints are really going to be
doubtful. All that can be said is
that the Trojans are three deep, led
by national champ Foy Draper, and
that Stanford is also three deep, led
by Ray Dean, Chuck Voigt, and Jim
Kneubuhl.
Last thesis is on Sam Klopstock
in the hurdles. You've watched
Sam run for two years; watch him
tomorrow.
