SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA will
<>on have enough Mexican ex-presi
tl« lit: to hold a picnic. Maybe from
«.ut of Long Beach will emerge a
f-iOO-a-month Revolving Pension
Plan for Mexican Ex-presidents.
Don't waste any sympathy on
Pluturco Elias Calles, however. His
New York bank accounts could pay
off the war debts and he exiled
plenty of political enemies in hi.s
day, besides excluding church big
wigs from Mexico who stuck their
tongues out at him.
MANY 7 PEOPLE wonder what
cau es all of these flare-ups between
l!" Japanese and Outer Mongolian
border patrols.
The answer, first of all, lies in the
fad that the Manchukuo-Mongolia
boundaries are undefined and un
delerinincd. No markers appear to
fit'line the lines because the lines are
unknown. Half the time the soldiers
don't know whether they are in
Manehukuo or in Outer Mongolia or
in Russia.
The "incidents" occur when a
company of soldiers swoops down on
tie enemy in order to occupy the
cction on which the enemy is
' amped. The Japanese nudge the
.longolians over a little, and then
the Mongolians, aided and abetted
y Russian strength, give the Japa
nese a healthy shove back in the
' ther direction.
And all this will continue until the
I .li lies involved will agree to pre
•iil the whole trouble to an inter
national arbiter such as the Hague
ourt. The boundaries will then be
;tabli bed and marked. Only until
tin will these border skirmishes
(cage.
NEWSPAPER READERS should
it take the incidents too seriously
. id should realize that war is not
i-ar whenever one or the other
nder patrol massacres the enemy.
But on reading of Japan, Mon
• 1 or Russia actually massing
oops and moving them toward the
izy borders, you can lick your
uips and expect a war in the Far
i ist.
TOWN SEN DITE CLEMENTS, on
t stand before the congressional
vestigating committee, admitted
i: at he had never read any book
(..i economics. Fine stuff! Clements,
therefore, was merely the organ
-'i for the political doctor, and un
indful of the plan's merits or de
erits. He didn't care whether the
i; in was feasible or not. He must
.ve merely considered himself as
i ample-salaried promoter of a
heme good or bad.
However, whatever may be said
, ainst the Townsend Plan does not
< iscure the fact that the idea is a
i anifestation of the ever-increas
. 4 desire and need for old age pen
ins or security of some sort for
lfortunate American oldsters. The
ed for such a plan becomes evi
nt as time goes by. The desire
r pensions is always present, so
■ won't worry about that. What
e Long Beach doctor has devised
fantastic for many reasons, mainly
•cause he asks for too much money
hI has ill-defined notions about
here all the money should come
i om.
There is the possibility that Dr.
iwnscnd is asking for $200 for
/cry citizen over (50 in hopes of
Ming $20 a month for those who
i 'ally need it. Who can tell?
