The Eciitor, Sir:
Mild and sensible, we are in
formed by yesterday's editorial,
will be the.Peace Conference next
Tuesday afternoon. But with Mr.
Thomas speaking, it is certain to be
more interesting than tepid.
The members of the V.F.W. will
undoubtedly be anxious to take ad
vantage of the opportunity to com
bat this move which threatens to rob
them of their gratuities, and surely
the Home Fire Division should be in
the front row with their knitting
needles. We hope the R.O.T.C. will
be present—in civilian clothes. Fu
ture big-business men and future
wives of big-business men will want
to learn how Norman Thomas could
advocate .such a thing as peace—
and perhaps these people will want
to express themselves on behalf of
the vested interests. In fact, even
those with no axe to grind should
come.
