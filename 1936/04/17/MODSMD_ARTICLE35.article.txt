1 Permit me to endorse without res
ervation the Stanford Mother's plea
for the maintenance of the Honor
Code in the Vox Campi column of
the 13th instant. Were I a Stanford
I alumnus or member of the faculty
, or student body I would fight for
and support the Code as whole
heartedly as I would condemn the
iniquitous, snooping proctor system,
with its inevitable suspicions, hu
miliations, and degradation of man
! and womanhood.
My alma mater was a technical
, school where in the nineties the
proctor system and its variants were
practiced according to the notions
! of the professor in charge of a de
partment. I never saw a proctored
I examination that was not crooked
us a bedspring nor one depending
I upon trust in the innate student
| honor that was not as straight as the
! Golden Rule. Invariably the pres
ence of proctors was a challenge to
the sporting proclivities of the class
j and they retaliated in proportion to

the surveillance imposed—and got '
away with it.
Because any operable honor code
is as dependent upon faculty atti
tude upon student morality, I be- !
lieve that accretions to the Stanford
faculty from other colleges should
be as carefully coached and im
pressed with the sacredness of 'the
Stanford traditions and Code as the j
student transfers and freshmen.
Stanford University, with its
splendid record, cannot afford . . .
to retrogress and revert to a policy
based upon the presumption that
every student is a potential liar and
cheat with aspirations for postgrad
uate courses at San Quentin, Fol
som, and Alcatraz.
