# PUBLIC ENLISTING POST

The Editor, Sir:
Would you be kind enough to in- ,

form me where it is possible for
Stanford men to enlist in the local
chapter of the Veterans of Future
Wars?
We think that the local strength of
the organization would be greatly
increased if a public enlisting post
were established.
It is going to irk us plenty if we
fiiid the dough slipping through our
fingers. Let us take this organiza
tion out of local politics and estab
lish it on the high level that it
merits.
"All for the thousand bucks and a
thousand bucks for all."
