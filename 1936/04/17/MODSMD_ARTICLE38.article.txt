## In View of the Eleven Hundred Features, Fashions Pan-Hell Council Reviews Old Bidding Contract Vacation Rushing, Teas To Be Voted on By Sororities This Week 
### Florence Brown 
In a determined effort to formu
:e a workable rushing plan, Pan
?llenic Council went over the en
e old bidding contract Tuesday
ght and suggested several im
rtant changes which will be voted
>on by the houses this week.
While the main part of the bidding
ntract was kept intact, the sixg
sted changes, it is hoped, will be
fficient to insure the efficiency of
e plan. One of the suggestions
vv.ts to make the freshmen women a
party to the contract. At present
this idea is under consideration not
only by the houses, but by Mrs.
Alice Ingraham Bodle, who is acting
in the place of Dean Yost.
Vacation rushing, which was a
source of some trouble in past
years, was another subject under
consideration by the council. It
was decided that the policy of al
lowing informal contact during the
summer, as long as such contact is
reported, should be continued. But
it was emphasized that there should
be no rushing at all during Thanks
giving or Christmas vacations.
Formal rushing is still to be held
in winter quarter, if the council's
suggestions are approved by the
houses. But it has been suggested
to hold three Pan-Hellenic teas on
successive Sundays, possibly to re
place the Women's Conference party.
One-third of Roble and one-third
of the houses would be included
each week, according to alphabetical
lists.
Next Monday tho Council will
meet again, at which time Mrs.
Bodle will speak to the members.
When these suggestions have been
decided upon by the houses, the
election for new Pun-Hellenic of
ficers will be held. It is hoped that
the discussion of changes in the bid
ding contract v/ill be definitely con
cluded with the vote of the houses
on the suggestions within a week.
