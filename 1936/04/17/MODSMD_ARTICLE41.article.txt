### Woman's Editor 
She surveys the dining hall with
an eagle eye, to spot the unfamiliar
face of a guest. She hastens to the
side of the stranger's hostess to
perform the unpleasant duty of col
lecting for the as yet uneaten meal.
She is the dining room hostess.
Roble, Lagunita, and Union din
ing halls charge uniform rates for
guest meals, payable in script bought
from the University. They charge
35 cents for breakfast, 50 cents for
lunch, and 60 cents for dinner.
Sunday the ante for dinner is raised !
to 75 cents, while for supper the j
charge is 35 cents.
The dining halls make no refund '
whatsoever for meals missed, except j
in the case of an illness lasting over j
five days. If a woman goes away
for the week-end, she continues to
pay for her meals in the hall, even
though she is not there to eat them.
She must be ill in the Rest Home
or hospital for six days before the
dining hall will give her a refund.
This money is not paid upon the
scale of the cost of guest meals, but
on a pro-x-ata basis determined by
the charge for board and the number
of days in the quarter.
Hall women feel the injustice of
being unable to obtain refunds for
meals missed, while at the same
time they must pay high prices for
each guest they bring into the din
ing room. Such is not the case on
the Row. There has been adopted a
workable system of guest privileges,
which could easily be put into ef
fect in the dormitory dining halls.
This system would necessitate a
bulletin board on which each
woman would sign the day before
she intended to go out for a meal.
In return she would get a guest
meal, in proportion, for example, of
one guest meal for each meal missed.
To be eligible for a guest meal, she
must sign her guests up at least a
day in advance.
With this system the dining room
would be able more accurately to
gauge the number of meals to pre
pare. The saving in food would
compensate for the lack of revenue
[ from guest meals. And a more
j friendly atmosphere between living
! groups would be fostered.
I Hall women miss enough meals
I to warrant guest privileges.
