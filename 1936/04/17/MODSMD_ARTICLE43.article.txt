# Claire MacGregor Values Self-Development In Speech
## 
### 
If you want to improve your con- I
versation, you must first develop
yourself. That's the theory which
Claire MacGregor, instructor in
Stanford's public speaking depart
ment, holds about public speaking.
"A person's speech is no better
than himself," Miss MacGregor tells
her classes. Because both conversa
tions and public speaking are so
closely connected with the individ
ual, he can say nothing which he
doesn't have within him.
It wasn't so long ago that Miss
MacGregor was a student at Stan
ford herself, acquiring those speech
theories which she now interprets.
Transfering as a junior from Carle
ton College, she graduated and took
her M.A. from Stanford. After a
year at Sioux Falls, in South Dakota,
she retuxned here in 1931 to take
the position of public speaking in
structor which she now fills. *
Always interested in public speak
ing, she won declamatory and ora
torical contests in high school, an
all-state contest in Montana, and an
intercollegiate contest at Carleton.
The tx-aditional Junior Opera
started her in her Stanford dramatic
career. But her principal campus
activity was in the Chappie, for
which she wrote. The Old Boy even
px*esented her with an engraved
silver cupior selling the most Chap
pies of the year. *
Because she attended Stanfox-d
hex-self, Miss MacGregor has some
definite ideas of how to meet stu
dent problems in her work here.
The trouble with a large university,

she says, is that there are few ac
tivities which show a person what
he can or cannot do- —something he
must" know before he can adjust
himself. To resolve such confusion,
she instituted her well known in
dividual conferences, in which she
evaluates each student's capa
bilities for him. She also organizes
conversation classes —all outside of
the regular class work.
In the classroom, she believes per
sonal development results through
oral reading and speech making. We
choose the readings to fit the person,
she says. If he lacks strength, we
give him a powerful selection to
draw that quality from him. But
everyone should set aside a few
minutes each -I'iy to consciously de
velop himself.

"A person's speech is no better
than himself," Miss MacGregor tells
her classes. Because both conversa
tions and public speaking are so
closely connected with the individ
ual, he can say nothing which he
doesn't have within him.
It wasn't so long ago that Miss
MacGregor was a student at Stan
ford herself, acquiring those speech
theories which she now interprets.
Transfering as a junior from Carle
ton College, she graduated and took
her M.A. from Stanford. After a
year at Sioux Falls, in South Dakota,
she retuxned here in 1931 to take
the position of public speaking in
structor which she now fills. *
Always interested in public speak
ing, she won declamatory and ora
torical contests in high school, an
all-state contest in Montana, and an
intercollegiate contest at Carleton.
The tx-aditional Junior Opera
started her in her Stanford dramatic
career. But her principal campus
activity was in the Chappie, for
which she wrote. The Old Boy even
px*esented her with an engraved
silver cupior selling the most Chap
pies of the year. *
Because she attended Stanfox-d
hex-self, Miss MacGregor has some
definite ideas of how to meet stu
dent problems in her work here.
The trouble with a large university,

she says, is that there are few ac
tivities which show a person what
he can or cannot do- —something he
must" know before he can adjust
himself. To resolve such confusion,
she instituted her well known in
dividual conferences, in which she
evaluates each student's capa
bilities for him. She also organizes
conversation classes —all outside of
the regular class work.
In the classroom, she believes per
sonal development results through
oral reading and speech making. We
choose the readings to fit the person,
she says. If he lacks strength, we
give him a powerful selection to
draw that quality from him. But
everyone should set aside a few
minutes each -I'iy to consciously de
velop himself.
If you want to improve your con- I
versation, you must first develop
yourself. That's the theory which
Claire MacGregor, instructor in
Stanford's public speaking depart
ment, holds about public speaking.
