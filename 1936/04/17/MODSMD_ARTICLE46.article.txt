## JUNIORS, SENIORS MERGE, FOIL BASEBALL HEAD 
### 
Woman's prerogative ot changing
her mind has even entered the base
ball sanctuary, as Ruth Schmidt,
W.A.A. head of baseball, discovered ;
to her sorrow. After patiently labor- j
ing last week to make out a schedule '
for interclass games, Ruthie learned j
the other day that her work was all |
in vain.
Contrary to the original plan of
filling the vacancies on the junior j
and senior teams with extra sophs |
and frosh, the t upperclassmen j
changed their minds and decided to j
pool their resources! This little J
maneuver threw Ruthie's schedule
completely out, for how could the j
juniors play the seniors when they
were all on one team? And how
could four teams play when there
were only three teams?
