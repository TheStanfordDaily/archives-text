# SOPHS SAVE SITUATION FORM TWO TEAMS
## 
### 
The sophs settled the latter ques
tion by coming to the fore with
enough players to make two teams, j
So now everyone is happyâ€”except j
Ruth, who has to plan a whole new j
schedule.
But Ruthie has the laugh on all i
those who come to bat against her. !
They may swagger up to the plate
with a confident grin, but when that I
fast ball goes zinging by the gx'in
abruptly vanishes and a rather anx- j
ious look takes its place. At practice I
the other day the frosh played I
against the junior-senior aggrega- |
tion and when it came their turn to j
bat their practice consisted mostly j
of swinging at thin air. Some of j
them were too scared to hit the ball, j
and those who weren't couldn't. For |
the most part, it made no difference j
whether a ball was good or bad, |
they swung anyway.
