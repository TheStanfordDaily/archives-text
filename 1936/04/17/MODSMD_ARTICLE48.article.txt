While it is still a little early to
judge, the junior-senior team does j
I seem to have the edge on the oth
ers. Besides the pitcher, it is forti- j
fied with a good bunch of hitters,
all of whom can be depended upon
to come through in a pinch. When
i Dolly Burke, Helen Watters, and j
Caryll Mudd are in good form, their
i hits are usually good for extra bases, i
: Fielding weaknesses are still ap- |
j parent but should iron out with a
i little more practice. Only, as one

get any practice when Ruth is
pitching."
