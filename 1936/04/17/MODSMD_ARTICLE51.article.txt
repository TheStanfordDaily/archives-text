# Husky Track Stars Meet Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
Twenty - two Washington track
men arrive in Berkeley today to
meet California in a Conference
dual meet tomorow. The Huskies
were beaten in a spring vacation
meet by Stanford, 71-60.
The Bears figure to capitalize and
win on the Husky weakness in the
field events. Cal, however, will be
minus the services of Bob Fowler,
George Anderson, and Bob Heavey,
three of their stars.
