# Hunt Shoots Rapids, Risks Life on Outing
## Coach Spends Nine Days On Dangerous River 
### Tim Hays 
Spring vacation, which found
Roughs basking in the sun at Car
mel, found "Husky" Hunt of the
football coaching staff risking his
life on the first known non-portage
expedition down the San Juan Riv
er, tributary of the Colorado.
"Husky," with J. C. Irwin of the
B.A.C. and Charles Elkus of San
Francisco, negotiated the treacher
ous stream in a 16-foot boat for two
hundred miles between Mexican
Hat, Utah, and Lee's Ferry, Arizona.
Norman D. Nevills of Medicine Hat
served as boatman.
Low water enhanced the dangers
of the perilous rapids and the hid
den boulders with which the stream
is studded. The party was told be
fore its departure that no one could
shoot all of the San Juan's rapids
and live, but "Husky" has motion
pictures to verify his success.
"Husky" described the party's 16-
foot boat, supplied by the boatman,
as being "box-like." It was rec
tangular, flat-bottomed, and home
made. It proved, however, to be the
right boat for the trip. Sturdily
constructed, it withstood blows
against rocks in the stream bed.
The party had been particularly
warned against attempting the
Thirteen Foot Rapid, so named be
cause the river at this point drops
13 feet in 75 yards. In the course
of shooting these rapids they were
hurled upon a rock where they re
mained stranded for several minutes
until they could push themselves off.
One hundred and thirteen miles
of their route lay through a colorful
canyon in the Painted Desert re
gion.
The group made a side trip of six
miles to the Rainbow Bridge, the
largest natural bridge in the world.
Not discovered until 1909, this phe
nomenon is still so remote that it is
infrequently visited. "Husky" had
visited the bridge a year before and
had signed his name in the regis
tration book as visitor number 2113.
This time he signed as visitor num
ber 2193.
The trip started discouragingly
with a "man overboard." During
the first hour J. C. Irwin fell into
the stream when the boat struck a
hidden rock.
Nine days were spent on the river.
The party left Stanford on March 30
and returned April 5, one week
after registration.

nomenon is still so remote that it is
infrequently visited. "Husky" had
visited the bridge a year before and
had signed his name in the regis
tration book as visitor number 2113.
This time he signed as visitor num

The trip started discouragingly
with a "man overboard." During
the first hour J. C. Irwin fell into
the stream when the boat struck a
hidden rock.
Nine days were spent on the river.
The party left Stanford on March 30
and returned April 5, one week
after registration.
Insects frozen in Arctic ice for
centuries have been made to live by
Soviet scientists.
Spring vacation, which found
Roughs basking in the sun at Car
mel, found "Husky" Hunt of the
football coaching staff risking his
life on the first known non-portage
expedition down the San Juan Riv
er, tributary of the Colorado.
"Husky," with J. C. Irwin of the
B.A.C. and Charles Elkus of San
Francisco, negotiated the treacher
ous stream in a 16-foot boat for two
hundred miles between Mexican
Hat, Utah, and Lee's Ferry, Arizona.
Norman D. Nevills of Medicine Hat
served as boatman.
Low water enhanced the dangers
of the perilous rapids and the hid
den boulders with which the stream
is studded. The party was told be
fore its departure that no one could
shoot all of the San Juan's rapids
and live, but "Husky" has motion
pictures to verify his success.
"Husky" described the party's 16-
foot boat, supplied by the boatman,
as being "box-like." It was rec
tangular, flat-bottomed, and home
made. It proved, however, to be the
right boat for the trip. Sturdily
constructed, it withstood blows
against rocks in the stream bed.
The party had been particularly
warned against attempting the
Thirteen Foot Rapid, so named be
cause the river at this point drops
13 feet in 75 yards. In the course
of shooting these rapids they were
hurled upon a rock where they re
mained stranded for several minutes
until they could push themselves off.
One hundred and thirteen miles
of their route lay through a colorful
canyon in the Painted Desert re
gion.
The group made a side trip of six
miles to the Rainbow Bridge, the
largest natural bridge in the world.
Not discovered until 1909, this phe
nomenon is still so remote that it is
