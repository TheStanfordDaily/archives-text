# Kelley's Injury Handicaps Frosh
## Pulled Muscle Will Put Star Out for Season 
### 
A bombshell struck with shatter
ing force in the freshman track
camp yesterday. Rudy Kelley,
sprinter and broad jumper, who
was counted on for heavy duty
against Cal next week, is out for
the season with a pulled muscle.
This leaves the sprinting and'
broadjumping chores in the hands
of Thompson, Carew, Soltero, and
Taggart against the Alameda All-
Stars here tomorrow, and also
against the Cal Cubs later.
Only sure-shot winner in the
meet with the All-Stars is Pete
Zagar, discus tosser, whose 150-foot
throws make him virtually an "un
touchable." Progress of hurdlers

Hawkins and Bale, who are show
ing marked improvement, will be of
interest tomorrow.
The meet starts at ten o'clock,
with the javelin and shot put on
tap fifteen minutes earlier.

Purdue's charter stipulates that
there will be on the board of re
gents "one farmer, one woman, and
one person of good moral character."
