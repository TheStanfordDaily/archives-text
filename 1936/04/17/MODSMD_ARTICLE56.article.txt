# Gilhula Makes S.C. Favorite in Title Swim Tilt
## Indians, Bears Wage Duel For Second in Southern Division Championship 
### 
Jimmy Gilhula will be out to hang
up new intercollegiate records when
the four Pacific Coast Conference
teams tangle for southern division
honors in Enciru' pools at 2 o'clock
tomorrow, according to Fred Cady,
U.S.C. swimming coach.
Gilhula hopes to beat the confer
ence records of 2:12.8 in the 220
and 53.7 in the 100. He himself set
the mark in the 220 last year and
will show just why he's a sure bet
for the coming Olympics.
Second-place honor is the big
unknown in the conference compe
tition, with Stanford and California
tankmen figured to s*age a terrific
duel for it.
The Trojans swim heavy favorites
to take the championship for the
second straight year. U.C.L.A. has
little chance of ending up above the
cellar position.
Frank Kurtz —best diver on the
Coast and another past and prob
able future Olympic Games star—
will do the diving as it's really done.
John Paulsen, the third of Troy's
Olympic representatives, is on the
small end of the odds in the 200-
yard breast stroke race.
Gilhula in the 100 and the 220,
Kurtz in the diving, Jim Werson of
California in the breast stroke ar-e
all big favorites to win. Stanford's
chances of winning the 400-yard
free style relay are considerably di
minished by the news that Gilhula
will anchor the Trojan team.
Results of the Southern Cal-Stan
ford track meet at Los Angeles will
be announced as they are received
at the pools. Admission will be 25
cents.
