# Farm Netmen Expect Win From Bruins
## Dey, Law Favored To Win Single Matches in Tomorrow's Uclan Meet 
### 
Stanford's traditional lust for bear
meat is scheduled to burst its
bounds again tomorrow when the
Indian netmen will whet their
tomahawks (rackets) in anticipa
tion of a feast at ihe expense of the
U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Coach Sherman Lockwood, farm
tennis tutor, with his characteristic
optimism says, "We will beat the
Uelans worse than we did last time."
(Score on the previous occasion fa
vored the Stanlords G-3.)
Cause of the coach's rosy outlook
is the fact that John Law and Ben
Dey, his two topflight players, were
winners over the Bruin's best in
their first encounter a month ago,
and are expected to rejpeat.

Manager Milton Mack re
quests that all tennis tryoutees
not actively engaged in the
U.C.L.A. matches report on the
courts this afternoon to make
arrangements to help officiate
Saturday.

The singles contests are poten
tial ly supposed to supply the fire
works tomorrow, but the doubles
play which always comes after the
completion of the one-man affairs
may decide the issue — especially
should the seeded Indians suffer any
unexpected setbacks in the opening
matchs.
Representing the Farm in the
aforementioned doubles are: Dey
and Pommer, Seward and Under
wood, and Law and Braly. Lineups
for the singles battles find the fol
lowing men on opposite sides of the
net. Law (S) vs. Hellman (UCLA),
Dey (S) vs. Stewart (UCLA), Sew
ard (S) vs. Anderson (UCLA),
Pommer (S) vs. Barker (UCLA),
Braly (S) vs. Stanley (UCLA), and
Underwood (S) vs. Uhl (UCLA).
Fans are asked to be present early
as the play begins at 2 o'clock.
