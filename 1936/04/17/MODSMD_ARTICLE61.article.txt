It happened in the Daily shack I
at about 10:30 last night. It was of 1
evil, ominous portent. No one was
awake but the night editor, who was
dozing over the page proof of page 3.
He was trying to figure out how to
spell Weirshauser ... or Weier
shaueser . . . wait a minute, now j
don't tell me . . . Weirhausar? . . . j
Anyway, from out of the night j
that was dank and cold, down
from the wooded tLmberlaud fast
i nesses above the campus tottered |
in that perennial, Ã¼biquitous, in
dubitable son of the rich wooded
hills, John Drofnats, cousin of the
equally famous seer, Sylvestre J.
(no relation, however, of Nimrod
Jughead Drofnats, who is at pres
ent boondoggling in Washington).
"Why, hello, John," said the night
editor. "What brings you here so j
late at night."
John said nothing, but drew out
from an immense portfolio some
three or four reams of yellow fools
cap, upon which were scrawled all
manner of cryptical penciled hiero- !
glyphics.
"Why. John, what is all this
minutiae?" asked the night ed, per
plexed.
"Troy-Tribe track test," finally i
spoke up Jawn, obviously plagiar- I
izing pet phrases of the sports editor.
"Ah," mouthed the night ed, who
was in truth no one but M Jack
Newman, catching on. "You have a
dope sheet, John, telling us just
who is going to place one, two, and
three in the impending athletic en
counter at the Los Angeles Coli-
I seum."
