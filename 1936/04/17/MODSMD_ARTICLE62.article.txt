# DROFT PICKS WE 14. THEY 117

The night ed was visibly im
pressed with the mystic power of
this small, rat-like figure. "What do
you think the score will be tomor
row? Will our Palo Alto (mustn't
use Stanford) boys score 50 points, |
John?"
"No," replied Jawn, stamping
his club foot (the left) phleg
matically on the desk. The score
will be U.S.C. 117, Stanford 14.
M Jack gulper. "Yeah, you really
think so?"
At this point the wizened seer
grew tense, smoothed out his grubby
sackcloth cassock, and waxed elo
quent.
"You think," he sneered, "that
U.S.C. has just another team this
year. Well, let me tell you Dean
Cromwell only had his shock troops I

against Cal last week—he was hold
ing his aces in the hole—except
Staley, Meadows, Fitch, and Bush—
they are pretty good."
Emjak sat there mute, motionless,
aghast at these words. Jawn went
on.
"And listen here. You think, I
suppose, that Humbert Smith is go
ing to win the high jump Saturday."
"Yeh, cinch," bragged the night
ed.
"Well, let me tell you. Thurber,
their No. 1 jumper against Cal last
week, won't even jump. Crom
well's got three other guys, na
tives of the ant-hill region of
South Africa, all of whom jump
S feet—any old time, at the count
of 10."
