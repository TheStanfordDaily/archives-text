## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Practical Nick-Nacks Hard to Find; Why Not an Endowment Fund, Seniors 
### 
The clock tower, the fountain in Union f
Court, Quad drinking fountains, and many
other little trinkets, artistic and convenient,
adorn Stafford's campus as property of the !
University by virtue of various Senior Class i
gilts in past years.
Four classes, in fact, have pooled their gilt- ;
budgets into one large sum with which they 1
specified that a fountain should be constructed
in front of the library. These were the classes
of '28, '29, '30, and '.14; the pooled resources i
totaled $1,800.93.
To do this job right, Comptroller Almon E. i
Moth informs, a modest sum of from $25,000
to $30,000 would be required. That would
mean similar gil ts from the next 30 - odd j
classes before the fountain could be made pos- j
sible solely on senior gift funds.
But it' the next 30-odd classes are deter- 1
mined to make their gifts something of a con
crete and beautifying nature, they might as
well pour them into the library fountain —
because the number of nick-nacks that would

make suitable gilts is getting more and more
limited, and any new ones will become more
and more useless.
The Class of 1030 apparently would be far
wiser to forget about leaving behind a material
memento and make its parting gift in the
form of a general endowment fund. After all,
it would be no particular satisfaction for a
senior to return to the campus after 20 years,
point proudly to the library fountain, and
proudly gush, ".!/{/ class was responsible for
one-371h of this."
Seniors of future years — probably next
year if not this—will swing to endowments
as a mass show of appreciation for an educa
tion and group of college contacts that were
only about 30 per cent paid for.
This particular Senior Class —the Class of
'30—has a chance to inaugurate the policy of
setting up a class endowment fund as its gift
to the University.
After all, it is more practical to give the re
ceiver of a gift the wherewithal and let him
pick out his own "Christmas tie."

it would be no particular satisfaction for a
senior to return to the campus after 20 years,

proudly gush, ".!/{/ class was responsible for

Seniors of future years — probably next
year if not this—will swing to endowments
as a mass show of appreciation for an educa
tion and group of college contacts that were
only about 30 per cent paid for.
This particular Senior Class —the Class of
'30—has a chance to inaugurate the policy of
setting up a class endowment fund as its gift

pick out his own "Christmas tie."
The clock tower, the fountain in Union f
Court, Quad drinking fountains, and many
other little trinkets, artistic and convenient,
adorn Stafford's campus as property of the !
University by virtue of various Senior Class i
gilts in past years.
Four classes, in fact, have pooled their gilt- ;
budgets into one large sum with which they 1
specified that a fountain should be constructed
in front of the library. These were the classes
of '28, '29, '30, and '.14; the pooled resources i
totaled $1,800.93.
To do this job right, Comptroller Almon E. i
Moth informs, a modest sum of from $25,000
to $30,000 would be required. That would
mean similar gil ts from the next 30 - odd j
classes before the fountain could be made pos- j
sible solely on senior gift funds.
But it' the next 30-odd classes are deter- 1
mined to make their gifts something of a con
crete and beautifying nature, they might as
well pour them into the library fountain —
because the number of nick-nacks that would

make suitable gilts is getting more and more
limited, and any new ones will become more
and more useless.
The Class of 1030 apparently would be far
wiser to forget about leaving behind a material
memento and make its parting gift in the
form of a general endowment fund. After all,
it would be no particular satisfaction for a
