# The 						Union Dollar Comes Back from the Laundry
## 
### 
Long and incessant have been the groans
:il)onl the internal workings ol' the Stanford
Union and its chief organ, the Cellar. Mut
tered complaints have run the gauntlet I'roni
exorbitant prices to over-depreciation to such
an extent that a "something rotten in Den
mark" altitude has become widespread with
out justification.
In its last article on student finances today,
Tin-: IVwi.y attempts to present the Union
financial picture clearly enough so that many
misunderstandings may be cleared up once
and for ail.
The Union does make a profit, but not he
cause the Cellar charges 21) cents for sundaes.
It is fortunate to make 2 V 2 per cent profit what
with vacations and week-ends when overhead
goes on and trade all but dries up.
And when the Union dollar, which goes
only in part to the new theater, is brought out
in the open, it is found to be as untainted by
graft as a Ked Cross membership fee. Men
students pay roughly $7,000 annually in Union
dues. Seventy-five per cent of this, and at the
same time 7f> per cent of the Union's profits,
go to the theater fund.
The rest goes into a Union reserve fund,
part of which some day may be used to build
an A.S.S.U. building large enough to ade
quately house headquarters for most of the
campus activities.
So, as in the beginning it's the student who
pays, in the end it's the student who benefits.
