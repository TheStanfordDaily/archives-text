## Fascistic R.O.T.C. 
### 
(From the Columbia Spectator)
The menace of the R.O.T.C. as a weapon for mili
tarist propaganda and as a potential Fascist force has
been pointed out for years by organizations seeking
to disband this educationally worthless and socially
unsound project in "physical education."
The striking parallel between these student ".sol
diers" and the youthful gun-toters of Germany and
Italy fias become increasingly apparent to Americans
in the past year or so, and to strengthen this belief
there comes from Penn State University this week
some of the most damaging evidence yet produced.
* * * *
The Penn State Collegian, charging that students
making low rifle scores are forced to run the gauntlet
of other students armed with cartridge belts, accuses
Major Arthur F. Bowen of provoking "most shocking
and disgraceful examples of storm-trooper sadism."
The Committee on Militarism in Education, famed
foe of the R.0.T.C., replies to Major Bowen's conten
tion that the "paddle line was held just for fun" and
was "entirely voluntary" with the assertion that a
student "was tongue lashed by a sergeant, and lec
tured on the inadvisability of being a slacker when he
refused to participate in the mauling."
When rifle scores were tallied, the campus paper
states that Major Bowen issued the command, "These
men were low. Take off your belts gentlemen." The
seventy-odd "gentlemen" are then said to have pro
ceeded to get their licks at whacking the unfortunate
marksmen as they ran through the armory.

This may be all good fun, but to us, as to the
Collegian, it's altogether too reminiscent of the prac
tices of Herr Hitler and of the forebodings of Mr. Sin
clair Lewis.
A representative of the United States government
indulging in hell-week practices may be doing it
"just for fun," but this cruel exercise of superiority
by mediocre individuals is the kind of fun to which
Fascism appeals.
Secretary Derrf should act decisively on his prom
ise of an investigation of the situation, and should
make a complete report of the results, whether or not
they are favorable to the W;;r Department.
Further publicity, good or bad, can do little to
alter the bad name ihe R.O.T.C. has among thoughtful
groups in the nation.
