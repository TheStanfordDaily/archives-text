# Our Hasher Sez:

The K.K.G. tong is moaning again.
The Kappatalists charge grave social and economic
injustice, bias, prejudice, gross inequalities, regi
mentation, and the subjection of the individual to the
group in the existing order.
Now, when the Kappatalists start moaning, then
the existing order might as well collapse.
Collapse.

The cause of the K.K.G. moan, strangely enough,
is publicity. People had begun to scent revolutionary
movements afoot, when the Kappa entered into a volley
ball combine with the Kappa Sigs and erected a not
right smack-smack on the front lawn.
Those who remembered the days when the Kappas
used to pin their men at the jolly-ups were sur
prised to see that the chase hud been brought out
into the open.

Still No publicity

Then the hashers started doing cute things, and still
no publicity. Finally, the revolt flared out, and every
one agreed something must be done. The trouble, as
it was poignantly expressed by one Kappa is: "The
Kappa hashers are just as smart and do just as cute
things as other hasheis, but they never get mentioned
in Our Hasher."

Collapse

The Kappa hashers are big,Â»and strong, and very
handsome, and very cule. They belong to Zeta Psi
fraternity, and it is rumored that they play football.
One night, when the Kappas were all dressed up
for the Conference Party, the hashers tied plates on
their head with gauze, and stuck lighted candles on the
plates, and had the young ladies in hysterics all
through the meal.
Then, one day the girls composed a cute little
ditty with many verses. But of course they can't all
be printed, you know that.
One of them went something like this:
We are the girls of K.K.G.
Pooh, pooh.
We raise a furore
Cause we are purer
We are the girls of K.K.G.
Pooh, pooh.
So the hashers came in and did a lot of cute things
and sang this song:
We are the hashers of K.K.G.
Pooh, pooh.
We like the prexy
Because she's hard to handle
We are the hashers of K.K.G.
Pooh, pooh.
Collapse.
