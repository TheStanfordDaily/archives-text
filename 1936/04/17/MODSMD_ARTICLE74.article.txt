## "DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR...? 
### 
An ex that was not an ex. Yellow
blue books and pens, but no groping
for words or recitation of studied
facts. Was it a new level in sanity
or the latest thing in silliness?
The exam books were passed out
and the class was asked to list the
reading it had done thus far in the
course. That was all. No whys were
answered, no reasons were given.

Well, apparently the professor
wanted to know to what extent his
students were
delving into the
100 - odd reading
sources he had
given them, and
chose the most
formal method of
inter rogation
known to educa
tion — the blue
book—to find out.
But certainly the
professor did not
choose this meth
od primarily be
cause he wanted honor-(code)-
bright answers. For many a con
scious-stricken person who would
net let his hands bring a pony to ;
class or his eye stray to his fel
low's paper, would not have to ra
tionalize long to write "no unper
mitted aid given or received" after
a list of books he has supposedly
read. He wouldn't need aid to copy
down a list, nor for that matter
would he need aid in reading the
books even if he had read them.

What was in the professor's mind,
no doubt, was a belief that by a
process of association the yellow
blue book has come to be synonym- '
ous with honesty, and that honor
conscious students just couldn't
mar the neat white pages with
falsehoods. And I imagine that few !
if any did. There was no reason 1
for not telling the truth.

This question of trusting or not
trusting one's fellow men to tell the
truth is age-old ;tnd endlessly tire—
j some. It starts in Sunday school

with "Thou shnlt not lie." (Often
wanted to visit a theological sem
inary find see how they handle the
! honor code question there.) Then
i there are adventures in trying to
get teacher to believe you in grade
I school, and the never-to-be-forgot

ten sight of faculty proctors hanging !
over you in high school.
In college there are more proctors j
or a constant signing of an honor '
pledge. (If on registration day |
everyone would stand before the j
registrar and recite: "Everything I
do in classes this year will be hon- j
orable, wholly honorable, and noth
ing but honorable, so help the honor '
code," things would be easier and I
just as effective.) And of course ;
when college is over and life has ]
begun, nobody trusts anybody. I
That's why notary publics, court
clerks, and judges thrive.

A very wise man once said: "No,
I don't trust my neighbor, because I
know myself very well and I sus
pect the same things of everyone
else." Think that of these people
who hand you pledges to sign and it
won't be so hard to take.

for not telling the truth.

This question of trusting or not
trusting one's fellow men to tell the
truth is age-old ;tnd endlessly tire—
j some. It starts in Sunday school

with "Thou shnlt not lie." (Often
wanted to visit a theological sem
inary find see how they handle the
! honor code question there.) Then
i there are adventures in trying to
get teacher to believe you in grade
I school, and the never-to-be-forgot

ten sight of faculty proctors hanging !
over you in high school.
In college there are more proctors j
or a constant signing of an honor '
pledge. (If on registration day |
everyone would stand before the j
registrar and recite: "Everything I
do in classes this year will be hon- j
orable, wholly honorable, and noth
ing but honorable, so help the honor '
code," things would be easier and I
just as effective.) And of course ;
when college is over and life has ]
begun, nobody trusts anybody. I
That's why notary publics, court
clerks, and judges thrive.

A very wise man once said: "No,
I don't trust my neighbor, because I
know myself very well and I sus
pect the same things of everyone
else." Think that of these people
who hand you pledges to sign and it
won't be so hard to take.

An ex that was not an ex. Yellow
blue books and pens, but no groping
for words or recitation of studied
facts. Was it a new level in sanity
or the latest thing in silliness?
The exam books were passed out
and the class was asked to list the
reading it had done thus far in the
course. That was all. No whys were
answered, no reasons were given.

Well, apparently the professor
wanted to know to what extent his
students were
delving into the
100 - odd reading
sources he had
given them, and
chose the most
formal method of
inter rogation
known to educa
tion — the blue
book—to find out.
But certainly the
professor did not
choose this meth
od primarily be
cause he wanted honor-(code)-
bright answers. For many a con
scious-stricken person who would
net let his hands bring a pony to ;
class or his eye stray to his fel
low's paper, would not have to ra
tionalize long to write "no unper
mitted aid given or received" after
a list of books he has supposedly
read. He wouldn't need aid to copy
down a list, nor for that matter
would he need aid in reading the
books even if he had read them.

What was in the professor's mind,
no doubt, was a belief that by a
process of association the yellow
blue book has come to be synonym- '
ous with honesty, and that honor
conscious students just couldn't
mar the neat white pages with
falsehoods. And I imagine that few !
if any did. There was no reason 1
for not telling the truth.
