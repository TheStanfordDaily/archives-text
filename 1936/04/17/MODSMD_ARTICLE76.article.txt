# Garber, Venuti Swing Music Is Good On Discc
## 
### 
The swing boys seem to be pre- (
ponderant among current disc re
leases, Norvo, Hawkins, and Ve- j
nuti taking the prizes.
On the sweet side, Jan Garber!
does "Lost" and "The Touch of Your j
Lips" on Decca 739. Garber fans !
will like this, because it's as good a j
job as he's ever done, but it's just |
so much Garberage to this reviewer.
(Sorry, but I had to get that crack
in.)
Red Norvo does one of his own
".Decca Stomp" on
691, that's swell, genteel swing. |
Vibraphone is featured, as on the |
coupling, a blah number called j
"Gramercy Square."
Several old Joe Venuti masters;
have been re-released on Vot'Lilion. I
"Sweet Sue" and "Blue Room" are j
coupled on 3011. "Four String Joe"
and "Penn Beach Blues" arc
matched on 3160, and 3043 couples i
"Raggin' the Scale" with "Goin' j
Home." Venuti gets more out of his j
five pieces than Goodman with twice !
that many or more.
Back on Decca are two numbers
by Coleman Hawkins' orchestra.
This is one of Decca's best aggre- j
gations, a sort of cross between Glen I
Gray and Duke Ellington, if you can !
imagine such a combination as be- j
ing excellent rather than night- i
mareish. Their two on this re- j
lease, 742, are "Meditation" and j
"What Harlem Means to Me." Both '
sides feature some excellent saxo- \
phone work ,only one "commercial" j
chorus marring the latter.
