# New Deadlock Reached In Dock Strike
## Longshoremen Repudiate Tentative Agreement Ending Present Trouble 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 19 (/P).
â€”San Francisco's Waterfront Labor
Union, which virtually had closed
the port, was deadlocked again to
night with longshoremen repudiat
ing a tentative agreement with em
ployers to end the present trouble.
In Portland, Oregon, indications
arose of disagreement between Wil
liam Fischer, president of the Ma
rine Federation of the Pacific, and
Harry Bridges, left-wing president
of the San Francisco local Interna
tional Longshoremen's Union, who
has been a central figure in the dis
pute.
Liner Sales
The Grace liner Santa Rosa, the
arrival of which precipitated the
trouble a week ago, sailed from here
tonight for San Pedro still bearing
cargo which longshoremen refused
to unload. Company officials said
attempts would be made to unload
the vessel at San Pedro.
Two statements were issued on
behalf of the longshoremen. The
first, by the I.L.A. labor relations
committee, said union negotiators
exceeded their authority in signing
the agreement and that if carried to
completion, it would end local au
tonomy. The other statement, by the
I.L.A. publicity committee, said re
pudiation was necessary because the
the ship-owners' violation of the
local "is in no way responsible for
working award in looking out for
longshoremen."
Bridges Challenged
The statement said that the local
believes the arbitration award made
after the strike in 1934 was still in
existence. Bridges, who went to
Portland to explain the situation
here, was challenged several times
by Fischer at a meeting of long
shoremen there.
"The Federation is willing and
ready at all times," Fischer said, "to
go along with the good of the entire
I.L.A. on this coast, but not for one
group or individual. There are lots
of things on which I am in agree
ment with Bridges, and there are
other things on which I do not
agree."
