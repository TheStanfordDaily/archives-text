# 'Indian Art' Is Year Book Theme
## Student Talent To Carry Out Complete Idea 
### 
With "Indian Art" as the central
theme which is to be completely in
stigated by student talent, Don Han
sen, Quad editor, hopes to produce
an edition of the Quad which will
have more student interest than any
of the former editions.
Subjects for the division pages
and art work throughout the book
are to be from authentic In
dian pottery. It will include figures
and symbols of Indian design. Color
work in the book will also carry out
the theme, being done only in In
dian colors.
Other features that will be in
cluded in this issue are the large
social section and a great amount of
candid camera shots taken about the
campus. The social section will in
clude pictures of most of the dances
and activities that have been pro
duced under student direction.
Most of these shots and other pic
tures will be reproduced in a defi
nite black and white contrast, shad
ows and night shots will carry out
this idea. Each of the dormitories
will be shown on a full page layout,
taken in this manner.
The newest idea of the Quad will
be a section devoted to the music
department. Each group is to be;
given a page layout with camera
shots for additional student interest.
