# Good Grades Go With Politics, Not Athletics

Scholastically Ex Committee tops
not only the football and foiskctball
teams, but also the Cardinals. Re
search in the latest "Bawlout" re
vealed that the Farm's legislators
have a ratio of grade points to units
of 2.93, compared with (he football
team's 2.30 ratio, the basketball
team's 2.23 ratio, and a Cardinal
ratio of 2.89.
The Ex Committee figure applies
only to the undergraduate members,
as the graduates marks are outside
the reach of "Bawlout" snoopers.
The football and basketball team
figures apply to the starters in the
Rose Bowl and the Washington
series, respectively.
Further papers anil pencil work
brought out the "Bawlout" supe
riority of Women's Council over
Men s Council. The feminine judges

I boast a 2.72 ratio, compared with a
figure of 2.G0 for the men.
Farm students may speak dispar
agingly of class-average-raisers, but
when elections roll around they
place these same objects of criti
! cism in the important offices. The
above figures for student officers all
top last year's all-university grade
ratio of 2.54.
Included in the membership of
both Ex Committee and Cardinals is
; the Upper Division's number one
I scholar, Betty Orover. Indeed, three
of the Upper Division's ten scholas
tic leaders, Belty Orover, Chick
Franich, and Gib Holloway, are on
the roll of Cardinals. Two of these.
Graver and Franich, are also on the
Ex Committee. Holloway heads
Men s Council. Women's Council
! includes another of this "first ton,"
Esther Pelton.
