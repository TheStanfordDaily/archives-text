# Masque Ball Contest Starts Wild Clamor To Determine Winner
## Final Nominees Number 24; Campus Resembles Stock Exchange at Polls 
### 
Bearing a marked resemblance to
the New York Stock Exchange after
a heavy day of bargaining, the cam
pus yesterday started the wild spec
ulation which will determine the
winners of the Masque Ball King-
Queen Contest.
Because of close balloting for the
final candidates, 24 nominees will en
ter the final contest which starts
this morning at 10 o'clock.
Representation Good
Good representations from both
Hall and Row were shown in the
choice of final candidates. Poten
tial queens are Joan "Clothes
Horse Brandel, Liz "Cambodia"
Ehrens, Harle "The-gang'sall-here"
Barth, Bette "Easy" Going, Louise
Belle Howell, Jean "Two Time"
McMillan, Corinne "Texas" Moller,
Dulce "Painless" Parker, Kaky
"Front" Page, Barbara "Terrific"
Reinhardt, Nancy "Party-Party"
Scoggins, and Dotty "Ina" Swett.
The Dionne quintuplets, who were
said to be strong candidates, were
put out of the final race because the
votes were so split between them
that no one of them came out on
top. The nominating committee is
still in doubt as to which Jean Mc-
Millan is running, and they prom
ise eternal gratitude to anyone who
can enlighten them on this subject.
