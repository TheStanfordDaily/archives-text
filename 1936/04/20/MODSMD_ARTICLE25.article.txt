# Indian Cinder Men Lose To Trojan Team
## U.S.C. Tracksters Score 86 1/2 – 44 1/2 Win; Cards Prepare for Cal Meet 
### 
The Great Optimist, Coach Rob
ert L. "Dink" Templeton, main
tained his reputation in good shape
over the week-end—he went away
saying Stanford wouid make "46 or
48 points" against U.S.C., and, just
as if the tabulation were made to
order, the final count at Los Angeles
read "South California 86'/2, Stan
ford 44 1 /a."
All the predictions made here and
there about "the greatest track
team in the country" came true;
Stanford's cindermen took the field
in full strength, and with a few ex
ceptions, the results were as
as could be expected. Although the
waxing was thorough, Cardinal
supporters had lots to be # happy
about, with some good perform
ances indicating a plenty good
chance for victory in the Big Meet
here Saturday.
Nimmo Wins
Chuck Nimmo started the after
noon off by taking the mile in 4:23.8,
leaving the pace setting to U.S.C.'s
Lantz, as per instructions. Warren
Dixon proved his return to last
year's form by nipping Lantz for the
place position.
The sprints turned out to be dis
appointing for Stanford—Ray Dean
took a nice second in the 100 to Foy
Draper of the Trojans in a blanket
finish that was a pain in the neck to
the judges. Chuck Voigt, who beat
Dean in both sprints a week ago,
pulled up lame with a pulled
muscle sheath in the 100 which fin
ished his afternoon's activity and
may keep him out of competition for
months.
Next came the quarter, with
Weiershauser running about 48.8,
but 48.8 was good only for show, be
hind Smallwood and Fitch of U.S.C.
Just out of the money were Cassin
of U.S.C. and Cranston and Del
linger of Stanford; Cranston was de
clared eligible Friday when confer
ence schools voted to waive a re
stricting ruling in his case.
Two-milers Conic Through
Others who came through nicely
to win their first Block S were Bur
rows and Alexander, first and third
in the two-mile, and Bill McCurdy,
second in the half, which was won
by Trojan Ross Bush at 1:55.3, just
a Jittle over Mac's head at this time.
Wally Hardin and Humbert Smith
deserve special mention — Hardin
threw 190 in the javelin to lose first
place by 2 inches, while Smith for
got his leg pain long enough to win
the high jump from U.S.C.'s Thur
ber at 6-4.
Biggest disappointment to Cards
fans was the failure of hurdler Sam
Klopstock. Sam has had a tough
time getting into shape this season,
with colds, and was in a stiff league
Saturday. He was third to Cope's
world record tieing 14.2 in the highs,
but relinquished the points to Hunt
Kingsbury for knocking down too
many hurdles( and was third to La
fond's 23.6 low hurdle flight.
Reynolds Wins Again
Jim Reynolds was as consistent as
ever in winning the shot at 51 feet;
Hershey keeps moving out, hit 48-11
Saturday, while Mel Hurley was an
other new letterman in taking third
in the discuss behind Ken Carpen
ter and Phil Levy. Carpenter's 165
feet is a new meet record; Levy was
7 feet behind his old rival.
Teeny Ginn finally got over 13 feet
in the pole vault for a new personal
record, but in spite of the fact that
the number 1 Trojan Meadows was
a spectator, didn't quite the
money.
The relay was a corker, with
Cranston, Dellinger. Malott, and
i Weiershauser finishing a yard be
hind the U.S.C. team of Fitch, John
! son, Cassin, and Smallwood which
j set 3:14.8 as the best time made on
the coast this year.
So it's all over now, and next we
! gun for the less impossible Golden
| Bear. Wait an' sec.

All the predictions made here and
there about "the greatest track
team in the country" came true;
Stanford's cindermen took the field
in full strength, and with a few ex

as could be expected. Although the
waxing was thorough, Cardinal
supporters had lots to be # happy
about, with some good perform

chance for victory in the Big Meet
here Saturday.
Nimmo Wins
Chuck Nimmo started the after
noon off by taking the mile in 4:23.8,
leaving the pace setting to U.S.C.'s
Lantz, as per instructions. Warren
Dixon proved his return to last
year's form by nipping Lantz for the
place position.
The sprints turned out to be dis
appointing for Stanford—Ray Dean
took a nice second in the 100 to Foy
Draper of the Trojans in a blanket
finish that was a pain in the neck to
the judges. Chuck Voigt, who beat
Dean in both sprints a week ago,
pulled up lame with a pulled
muscle sheath in the 100 which fin
ished his afternoon's activity and
may keep him out of competition for
months.
Next came the quarter, with
Weiershauser running about 48.8,
but 48.8 was good only for show, be
hind Smallwood and Fitch of U.S.C.
Just out of the money were Cassin
of U.S.C. and Cranston and Del
linger of Stanford; Cranston was de
clared eligible Friday when confer
ence schools voted to waive a re
stricting ruling in his case.
Two-milers Conic Through
Others who came through nicely
to win their first Block S were Bur
rows and Alexander, first and third
in the two-mile, and Bill McCurdy,
second in the half, which was won
by Trojan Ross Bush at 1:55.3, just
a Jittle over Mac's head at this time.
Wally Hardin and Humbert Smith
deserve special mention — Hardin
threw 190 in the javelin to lose first
place by 2 inches, while Smith for
got his leg pain long enough to win
the high jump from U.S.C.'s Thur
ber at 6-4.
Biggest disappointment to Cards
fans was the failure of hurdler Sam
Klopstock. Sam has had a tough
time getting into shape this season,
with colds, and was in a stiff league
Saturday. He was third to Cope's
world record tieing 14.2 in the highs,
but relinquished the points to Hunt
Kingsbury for knocking down too
many hurdles( and was third to La
fond's 23.6 low hurdle flight.
Reynolds Wins Again
Jim Reynolds was as consistent as
ever in winning the shot at 51 feet;
Hershey keeps moving out, hit 48-11
Saturday, while Mel Hurley was an
other new letterman in taking third
in the discuss behind Ken Carpen
ter and Phil Levy. Carpenter's 165
feet is a new meet record; Levy was
7 feet behind his old rival.
Teeny Ginn finally got over 13 feet
in the pole vault for a new personal
record, but in spite of the fact that
the number 1 Trojan Meadows was
a spectator, didn't quite the
money.
The relay was a corker, with
Cranston, Dellinger. Malott, and
i Weiershauser finishing a yard be
hind the U.S.C. team of Fitch, John

j set 3:14.8 as the best time made on

Chuck Nimmo started the after
noon off by taking the mile in 4:23.8,
leaving the pace setting to U.S.C.'s
Lantz, as per instructions. Warren
Dixon proved his return to last
year's form by nipping Lantz for the
place position.
The sprints turned out to be dis
appointing for Stanford—Ray Dean
took a nice second in the 100 to Foy
Draper of the Trojans in a blanket
finish that was a pain in the neck to
the judges. Chuck Voigt, who beat
Dean in both sprints a week ago,
pulled up lame with a pulled
muscle sheath in the 100 which fin
ished his afternoon's activity and
may keep him out of competition for
months.
Next came the quarter, with
Weiershauser running about 48.8,
but 48.8 was good only for show, be
hind Smallwood and Fitch of U.S.C.
Just out of the money were Cassin
of U.S.C. and Cranston and Del
linger of Stanford; Cranston was de
clared eligible Friday when confer
ence schools voted to waive a re
stricting ruling in his case.
Two-milers Conic Through
Others who came through nicely
to win their first Block S were Bur
rows and Alexander, first and third
in the two-mile, and Bill McCurdy,
second in the half, which was won
by Trojan Ross Bush at 1:55.3, just
a Jittle over Mac's head at this time.
Wally Hardin and Humbert Smith
deserve special mention — Hardin
threw 190 in the javelin to lose first
place by 2 inches, while Smith for
got his leg pain long enough to win
the high jump from U.S.C.'s Thur
ber at 6-4.
Biggest disappointment to Cards
fans was the failure of hurdler Sam
Klopstock. Sam has had a tough
time getting into shape this season,
with colds, and was in a stiff league
Saturday. He was third to Cope's
world record tieing 14.2 in the highs,
but relinquished the points to Hunt
Kingsbury for knocking down too
many hurdles( and was third to La
fond's 23.6 low hurdle flight.
Reynolds Wins Again
Jim Reynolds was as consistent as
ever in winning the shot at 51 feet;
Hershey keeps moving out, hit 48-11
Saturday, while Mel Hurley was an
other new letterman in taking third
in the discuss behind Ken Carpen
ter and Phil Levy. Carpenter's 165
feet is a new meet record; Levy was
7 feet behind his old rival.
Teeny Ginn finally got over 13 feet
in the pole vault for a new personal
record, but in spite of the fact that
the number 1 Trojan Meadows was
a spectator, didn't quite the
money.
The relay was a corker, with
Cranston, Dellinger. Malott, and
i Weiershauser finishing a yard be
hind the U.S.C. team of Fitch, John
! son, Cassin, and Smallwood which
j set 3:14.8 as the best time made on
the coast this year.
So it's all over now, and next we
! gun for the less impossible Golden
| Bear. Wait an' sec.

The Great Optimist, Coach Rob

over the week-end—he went away

Dean in both sprints a week ago,
pulled up lame with a pulled
muscle sheath in the 100 which fin
ished his afternoon's activity and
may keep him out of competition for
months.
Next came the quarter, with
Weiershauser running about 48.8,
but 48.8 was good only for show, be
hind Smallwood and Fitch of U.S.C.
Just out of the money were Cassin
of U.S.C. and Cranston and Del
linger of Stanford; Cranston was de
clared eligible Friday when confer
ence schools voted to waive a re
stricting ruling in his case.
Two-milers Conic Through
Others who came through nicely
to win their first Block S were Bur
rows and Alexander, first and third
in the two-mile, and Bill McCurdy,
second in the half, which was won
by Trojan Ross Bush at 1:55.3, just
a Jittle over Mac's head at this time.
Wally Hardin and Humbert Smith
deserve special mention — Hardin
threw 190 in the javelin to lose first
place by 2 inches, while Smith for
got his leg pain long enough to win
the high jump from U.S.C.'s Thur
ber at 6-4.
Biggest disappointment to Cards
fans was the failure of hurdler Sam
Klopstock. Sam has had a tough
time getting into shape this season,
with colds, and was in a stiff league
Saturday. He was third to Cope's
world record tieing 14.2 in the highs,
but relinquished the points to Hunt
Kingsbury for knocking down too
many hurdles( and was third to La
fond's 23.6 low hurdle flight.
Reynolds Wins Again
Jim Reynolds was as consistent as
ever in winning the shot at 51 feet;
Hershey keeps moving out, hit 48-11
Saturday, while Mel Hurley was an
other new letterman in taking third
in the discuss behind Ken Carpen
ter and Phil Levy. Carpenter's 165
feet is a new meet record; Levy was
7 feet behind his old rival.
Teeny Ginn finally got over 13 feet
in the pole vault for a new personal
record, but in spite of the fact that
the number 1 Trojan Meadows was
a spectator, didn't quite the
money.
The relay was a corker, with
Cranston, Dellinger. Malott, and
i Weiershauser finishing a yard be
hind the U.S.C. team of Fitch, John
! son, Cassin, and Smallwood which
j set 3:14.8 as the best time made on
the coast this year.
So it's all over now, and next we
! gun for the less impossible Golden
| Bear. Wait an' sec.
