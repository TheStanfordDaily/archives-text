SOME READERS of this column I
misinterpreted my admonition last |
Wednesday about throwing money
away on slot machines. I meant no
slur on Ted Thurlow, and did not i
mean to imply that he was crying, ;
"Sour grapes." The mention of i
Paul's remark was merely a specific ,
example with which I wanted to
lead up to my little sermon. Thur
low himself begrudges no one any
thing, and is probably the best
friend that Stanford men have
among Palo Alto merchants.
THE I)U FONTS, the Morgans,
the Sloans, and their ilk do not
care which party gets their dona
tions as long as that party is anti-
New Deal. The Liberty League
financed a goodly portion of Georgia
Governor Talmadge's Goober Demo
crats convention because he ranted
long and loud against the admin
istration. The League also donates
generously to the Republican party,
for it is also a sworn enemy of
Roosevelt.
President Roosevelt has made
himself some very potent enemies.
They don't care where their money
goes, just so it's anti-F.D.R.
MAJOR PARTIES will be some
what worried about a couple of is
sues this summer. Old age pensions
a la Townsend and shorter hours
for labour —amounting to the gen
eral, all around betterment of liv
ing conditions among the laboring
classes
There are vague promises about
old-age pensions, social security and
so on. Old age pensions are prac
tically here. But America is most
interested today and will be for some
time to come in the solution of un
employment. Roosevelt puts the
matter up to business, asking in
dustry to shorten hours, increase
employment and at the same time
maintain the existing wage scale.
He has a billion and a half dollars
for WPA jobs and believes that will
take care of relief. He thinks the
solution of unemployment, there
fore, depends on how well industry
will succeed in this common job.
Stanfordman Hoover believes the
solution of the problem of unem
ployment "will come about when
sound economic policies for handling
the depression are restored and not
before." His principle of retrench
ment is this—the reduction of prices,
so that more people can buy, more
consumption, more jobs. "It takes
patience. It takes courage. Losses
are inevitable," he says.
BOTH IDEAS amount to the same
thing, only Hoover would spend no
federal money for relief. But the
states would have to spend it in or
der to prevent wholesale starvation
or even revolution, and it all comes
back on Johnny Q. Public to foot the
bill.
Sometimes I think Roosevelt can't
fee the trees because his eye is on
the forest, and Hoover can't see the
forest because he concentrates on
the trees.
It all goes back to the industrial
revolution when the world got off
on the wrong foot by prostituting the
machine, back when the machine got
into private hands and was em
ployed to enrich a handful of for
tunate capitalists, instead of serv
ing its true purpose—that of en
riching humanity, and serving the
people as a whole.
THE FIRST FAMILY will be
deeply grieved at the death of Louis
McHenry Howe. He died in his
•sleep at the Naval Hospital in Wash
ington where he had been taken last
.summer when the White House was
being repaired. Howe was the Emil
Hurja of his day. But as a political
.strategist, Howe needed few figures
and lew straw polls. He could "feel
it in his bones" what to do next.
WIIKN HEARST was trying to be
roped in on this Warren "Free"
Delegation (they needed his sup
port), he had the editor of the Los
Angeles Examiner mail each would
be delegate in the group a straw poll
ballot asking them to indicate whom
they favored for the Republican
nomination. All but one replied,
"Hoover." Hearst doesn't exactly
like Hoover, so he decided to form
a delegation of his own. So you
registered Republican voters have
your choice of Hearst or Hoover,
Landon or Landon.

SOME READERS of this column I
misinterpreted my admonition last |
Wednesday about throwing money
away on slot machines. I meant no
slur on Ted Thurlow, and did not i
mean to imply that he was crying, ;
"Sour grapes." The mention of i
Paul's remark was merely a specific ,
example with which I wanted to
lead up to my little sermon. Thur
low himself begrudges no one any
thing, and is probably the best
friend that Stanford men have
among Palo Alto merchants.
THE I)U FONTS, the Morgans,
the Sloans, and their ilk do not
care which party gets their dona
tions as long as that party is anti-
New Deal. The Liberty League
financed a goodly portion of Georgia
Governor Talmadge's Goober Demo
crats convention because he ranted
long and loud against the admin
istration. The League also donates
generously to the Republican party,
for it is also a sworn enemy of
Roosevelt.
President Roosevelt has made
himself some very potent enemies.
They don't care where their money
goes, just so it's anti-F.D.R.
MAJOR PARTIES will be some
what worried about a couple of is
sues this summer. Old age pensions
a la Townsend and shorter hours
for labour —amounting to the gen
eral, all around betterment of liv
ing conditions among the laboring
classes
There are vague promises about
old-age pensions, social security and
so on. Old age pensions are prac
tically here. But America is most
interested today and will be for some
time to come in the solution of un
employment. Roosevelt puts the
matter up to business, asking in
dustry to shorten hours, increase
employment and at the same time
maintain the existing wage scale.
He has a billion and a half dollars
for WPA jobs and believes that will
take care of relief. He thinks the
solution of unemployment, there
fore, depends on how well industry
will succeed in this common job.
Stanfordman Hoover believes the
solution of the problem of unem
ployment "will come about when
sound economic policies for handling
the depression are restored and not
before." His principle of retrench
ment is this—the reduction of prices,
so that more people can buy, more
consumption, more jobs. "It takes
patience. It takes courage. Losses
are inevitable," he says.
BOTH IDEAS amount to the same
thing, only Hoover would spend no
federal money for relief. But the
states would have to spend it in or
der to prevent wholesale starvation
or even revolution, and it all comes
back on Johnny Q. Public to foot the
bill.
Sometimes I think Roosevelt can't
fee the trees because his eye is on
the forest, and Hoover can't see the
forest because he concentrates on
the trees.
It all goes back to the industrial
revolution when the world got off
on the wrong foot by prostituting the
machine, back when the machine got
into private hands and was em
ployed to enrich a handful of for
tunate capitalists, instead of serv
ing its true purpose—that of en
riching humanity, and serving the
people as a whole.

It all goes back to the industrial
revolution when the world got off
on the wrong foot by prostituting the
machine, back when the machine got
into private hands and was em
ployed to enrich a handful of for
tunate capitalists, instead of serv
ing its true purpose—that of en
riching humanity, and serving the
people as a whole.
THE FIRST FAMILY will be
deeply grieved at the death of Louis
McHenry Howe. He died in his
•sleep at the Naval Hospital in Wash
ington where he had been taken last
.summer when the White House was
being repaired. Howe was the Emil
Hurja of his day. But as a political
.strategist, Howe needed few figures
and lew straw polls. He could "feel
it in his bones" what to do next.
WIIKN HEARST was trying to be
roped in on this Warren "Free"
Delegation (they needed his sup
port), he had the editor of the Los
Angeles Examiner mail each would
be delegate in the group a straw poll
ballot asking them to indicate whom
they favored for the Republican
nomination. All but one replied,
"Hoover." Hearst doesn't exactly
like Hoover, so he decided to form
a delegation of his own. So you
registered Republican voters have
your choice of Hearst or Hoover,
Landon or Landon.
