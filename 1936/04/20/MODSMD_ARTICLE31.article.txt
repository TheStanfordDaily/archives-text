# Hashers to Benefit In Retired Chef's Will
## Dobbins Deeds Ranch To Form Loan Fund 
### Dave Leff 
Retired at the end of last quarter
to his Acampo ranch in the Sacra
mento valley, was John Williams
Dobbins, 77, for eight years the head
chef at Encina Commons.
More than popular with Encina
hashers, the chef was known as a
good-natured, kindly man who
never lost his temper or raised his
voice. In this respect, he differs en
tirely from most chefs who usually
suffer with the "artistic" tempera
ment.
Dobbins himself never quit study
ing. Three years ago he estimated
that he had read over 4000 volumes,
and he puts Confucius and Einstein
on his preferred list. The philoso
phies of the former are interesting,
he says, and the latter he finds not
too difficult to comp'rehend.
A great admirer of Stanford, Dob
bins' sympathies leaned especially
toward hashers working for their
education, and more pai'ticularly
toward those planning on medicine
or the bar, because their difficulties
follow them for many years after
graduation.
Because of this, he has placed his
will in the possession of the Univer
sity, deeding to it many valuable
date and grape lands "for the pur
pose of establishing a fund to be
known as the John Williams Dob
bins Encina Commons Loan Fund
. . . to be used in making loans to
needy, deserving, and capable stu
dents at Stanford University, . . .
after as well as before graduation."
Now that he is gone, hashers will
miss the chef's good-humored quo
tations from classical sources—he
has a remarkable memory, particu
larly for history—and his kindliness
in general.
