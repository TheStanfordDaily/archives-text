1 The Editor, Sir: s
Gros—S2s is a cheap price for J
peace.
With that the A.S.S.U. Executive '
I Committee casually stamped its ap- ,
| proval and gave its financial sup- i
; port to the Stanford Peace Confer
ence scheduled from 3 to 8 o'clock
i tomorrow. I wonder if our student
! government had any idea of the
| wheels they may have set in motion
| by such a decision!
Sporadic interest in world issues
has flickered among Stanford stu
dents—demanding now and then,
j though unsuccessfully, concrete
j channels of expression. Peace, to
| day, is the question which synthe
| sizes current political, economic, and
social problems, and unifies the ac
tion of conservative, liberal, and rad
ical groups.
In the days of David Starr Jor
dan, Stanford was known for its
peace-action leadership. Now peace j
organizations ranging from the
Quaker-started Emergency Peace j
Campaign to the Veterans of Future |
Wars and the League Against War j
and Fascism are crying for Intelli- j
gent leaderships-is Stanford going to
supply some of it?
When Norman Thomas opens this '
Peace Conference and is followed by j
faculty-led round-tables on current ;
problems affecting peace, a definite '
challenge is thrown to world-mind- '
ed students. Here may be the be- j
ginning of chances to supply the
greatly needed leadership for wise j
peace action and of opportunities to i
lend the prestige and comparative !
wealth that the Stanford student and I
faculty member holds to the bat- J
tling, muddled attempts to unify 1
local, national, and international j
peace efforts.
