# OPEN THE PARKING LOTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The writer wishes to call the at
tention of the student, body or the !
appropriate authorities having juris
diction over the matter in question, !
to a reform which will undoubtedly i
prove helpful in the parking facili- i
j ties on the Quad.
Stanford purports to be run for
1 the collective benefit of the students,
its paying patrons, yet a situation
exists with regard to the parking
facilities that can hardly be recon
j riled with this accepted notion.
I Along the east side of the library is
j especially reserved a parking area
| for the exclusive use of the library ;
staff rpembers, employees of the i
| University.
j This portion of the already inade- j
quate parking accommodations is;

prohibited to the student who is
forced almost daily to the incon
venience of locating some distant
parking space while these privileged
spots remain vacant.'
There is no reasonable basis for
this arbitrary discrimination against
the student in this matter and to
fail to consider his needs, at least on
an equal basis with those of the
school's employees, is strikingly un
just and unfair.
Let the winds of freedom blow
down upon the east side of the
"libe" and equitably return to us
those often unoccupied and much
needed parking spaces.
