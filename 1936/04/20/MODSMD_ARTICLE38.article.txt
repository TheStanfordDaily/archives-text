UK; MEET WIN NEK?
HUNT ESKING

So the Indians scored 44 points
against S.C., which was according to
unbiased form, and the Bears .skin
ned the Huskies. Very good.
Which means' that this will be
another week of everyone asking
who is going to win the Big Meet
next Saturday. People who don't
know anything about it, but think
they do, will answer that one team
or the other is a cinch. People who
know the athletes won't say. It is
too close right now.
On the desk beside me here is a
piece of manila copy-paper with a
dope sheet on it. The final score
goes (Mi-(>s. Which team has the
<»(» is not important; the important
thing is that no one will know the
winner until about IS o'clock next
Saturday, when two lajis are gone
in the relay or thereabouts.
A novel thing is the wuy of Big
Meets this year is that of the 15
events only two are one-sided for
the favor of either team. Stanford
should get eight points in the mile,
Cal eight in the pole vault. Most
of the other events go five-and-four
or six-and-three.
Reading the Sunday sport sections
Card performances standing out are
Nimmo and Dixon's mile, Reynolds'
improving 50-foot put, Hardin's 190—
loot spear Hip, McCurdy's 1.56.5 880,
and the relay team's 3.15 second
place.

ARCHIE WILLIAMS IN
GREEN PASTURES

Archie Williams' 47.4 lap over at
Edwards Field was soundly convinc
ing, even to deep-dyed Stanford
.supporters. The high-brown strider
went out in front and stayed there,
won driving and going away. The
fast 220 made Jim Helmer and
Drury, the fast Husky, tie up badly
after rounding the curve, while Ar
chie loved the going and tore in
25 yards in front, and equalling the
old Ben Eastman time# on the same
track.
We will have to concede Archie
a first next Saturday, with Jack
Wciershauscr right behind him.
Hnt conversely, let's give Temple
ton's quartet the relay victory,
'i lie (i(>-()5 dope mentioned above
gives Williams a first in the 410
and 220. and lie can't be in the
pink for a fast anchor lap after
such a workout, especially with
Ray Dean. Jimmy Kneubuhl, and
Chuck Voigt forcing him to bet
ter than 21.4.
Also, don't be deceived by the poor
Bear javelining Saturday. There
was a stiff cross-wind blowing from
the sea and topnotch spear flipping
was mightily discouraged. In fact,
the javelin may be our downfall.
LOCAL YOKELS who saw the
big swimming splash here Saturday
are still talking about the magnifi
cent diving exhibition of Frank
Kurtz, the Troy Olympic Games
man. Nut one, but many commented

A novel thing is the wuy of Big
Meets this year is that of the 15
events only two are one-sided for
the favor of either team. Stanford
should get eight points in the mile,
Cal eight in the pole vault. Most
of the other events go five-and-four
or six-and-three.

Card performances standing out are
Nimmo and Dixon's mile, Reynolds'

ARCHIE WILLIAMS IN
GREEN PASTURES

Archie Williams' 47.4 lap over at
Edwards Field was soundly convinc
ing, even to deep-dyed Stanford
.supporters. The high-brown strider
went out in front and stayed there,
won driving and going away. The
fast 220 made Jim Helmer and
Drury, the fast Husky, tie up badly
after rounding the curve, while Ar
chie loved the going and tore in
25 yards in front, and equalling the
old Ben Eastman time# on the same
track.
We will have to concede Archie
a first next Saturday, with Jack
Wciershauscr right behind him.
Hnt conversely, let's give Temple

'i lie (i(>-()5 dope mentioned above
gives Williams a first in the 410
and 220. and lie can't be in the
pink for a fast anchor lap after
such a workout, especially with
Ray Dean. Jimmy Kneubuhl, and
Chuck Voigt forcing him to bet
ter than 21.4.
Also, don't be deceived by the poor
Bear javelining Saturday. There
was a stiff cross-wind blowing from
the sea and topnotch spear flipping
was mightily discouraged. In fact,
the javelin may be our downfall.
LOCAL YOKELS who saw the
big swimming splash here Saturday
are still talking about the magnifi
cent diving exhibition of Frank
Kurtz, the Troy Olympic Games
man. Nut one, but many commented

another week of everyone asking
who is going to win the Big Meet

too close right now.
