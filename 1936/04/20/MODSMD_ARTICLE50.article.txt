# It Works Here; Why Not In National Government?

Current Ex Committee controversy on the
constitutionality of the recently enacted va
cancy by-law, which provided that a presiden
tial appointment could (ill a brief absence
from Ex Committee sessions, brings up an
interesting parallel between local student and
national government operation.
Though most of the Farm citizenry may be
unaware of the fact, their own campus gov
ernment believes in and practices one of the
most enlightened theories of modern legis
lalive procedure judicial review before an
act goes into ell'ect.
The present Ex Committee "beef" arose be
cause of considerable doubt as to the by-law's
constitutionality, and it now awaits oilicial
review by M. K. Kirkwood, Law School dean.
While state and national governments go on
passing their annual quota of laws which,
after they have cost taxpayers much money
or caused some citizens much grief, are
thrown out as unconstitutional, the executive
body of the A.S.S.t'. usually manages to steer
clear of constitutional snags by submitting
questionable measures to its legal department,
the law school, before they are written into
the books.
The obvious advantages of preliminary ju
dicial reviewâ€”the saving of tax money and
the minimization of lengthy, expensive appeal
litigation are well known. Hut if the Su
preme Court is ever to pass judgment on Con
gressional measures before they are put into
efl'ect, a consittutional amendment is neces
sary, and whether the matter is of enough
importance or popular interest to merit an
amendment vote is questionable.
Most of the cases on which the Supreme
Court must pass judgment, however, involve
slate laws. If the states had provisions for
preliminary review in their own judicial sys
tem, the load on the Supreme Court certainly
would be lightened.
State controversies have original jurisdie

tion in the Supreme Court. If the justices
would recognize a state's right to protest a
national law without a test case being in
volved, a new and effective form of judicial
review could be started. The constitution does
I not object to this, but the ollieers of the court
do.
