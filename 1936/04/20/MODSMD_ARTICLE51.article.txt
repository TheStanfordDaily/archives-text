# High Schools Held Guilty Of Suppressed Teaching
## 
### 
In one of the conferences of the California
Educational Hcsearch Association's conven
tion held on the Farm last week-end, Law
rence T. Crawford of Chico Stale Teachers
College presented the results of a research
project which showed that high school stu
dents know very little about current events in
spite of the fact that teachers are well posted
on contemporary allairs.
Mr. Crawford went on lo explain his lind
ings in terms of the much debated issueâ€”re
strictions and limitations in the leaching of
contemporary issues. He had figures to prove
that teachers are not allowed to deviate from
the straight and narrow text-book path long
enough to instruct their pupils in present
day a Hairs.
Those same uninformed high school stu
dents go to college, and because they haven't
been taught lo expect current affairs instruc
tion in secondary schools, they don't miss it
in the universities.
If Mr. Crawford's findings are true of most
high schools, then colleges have a dual re
sponsibility. The wonder is that more col
leges and college professors don't recognize
this responsibility.
