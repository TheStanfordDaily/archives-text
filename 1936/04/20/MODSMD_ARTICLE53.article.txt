## How Do You Do? 
### Professor Leon J. Richardson, University of California 
A man with a pleasant voicc said: "How do you
do?" A good salutation merits a good response. What
then should it be? Certainly not: "Fine," "Just fine!"
The man used a rhetorical question, like the old Roman
greeting "Quid agis? ' No literal answer was expected.
He would have been quite taken aback had his polite
inquiry led you to say: "Doing well, thanks. No
sciatica. Step aside and I'll go into particulars." His
question was in effect a statement, showing his friendly
attitude toward you. Your response, therefore, could
be a smile, a nod, or the man's very words returned,
"How do you do?"

Several upstart expressions now and then try to do
duty for the noble Anglo-Saxon word "yes." One is
"ok," suitably used only in fun or in vulgar dialect.
Jt is not very funny, but quite vulgar. Sometimes, too,
an individual is found who, strangely enough, assents
by saying "You bet." That is enough to drive Gadarenc
swine violently down a steep place into the sea.
Again, the depression has brought us few more de
pressing moments than those in which some one has
"contacted," as he said, sundry persons. So speaking
he damns himself among lovers of good English. Only
vapid wretches say "alrightie."

Let there be no confusion between these vocables
and slang. Slang plays a useful part in the economy
of language, for it tries to find new ways of saying
things; it may not be trite; it must quickly evoke a
vivid image; and about it there usually plays an air of
whimsicality, humor, or wit. Julius Caesar used lan
guage effectively. His rule for diction, like Pope's, was
Be not the first by whom the new arc tried, nor yet
the last to lay the old aside." "Thanks a million,"
once was funny but now trite, should be laid aside.
It is a dull tool, not good enough to keep.
The field of slang is a drill-ground for recruits.
Sometimes an expression, tried out there, passes muster
and is put into the regular ranks of our speech.
Acceptable, for example, seems to be newcomer "He
got by with it."
