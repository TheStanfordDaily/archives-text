The psychologists have alt kinds of names for
people who do all kinds of things. Claustrophobia is
a psychosis, they tell me, that makes every room a
telephone booth to somebody. A claustrophobe feels
that he is related to the walls of a room as a weenie
is to its skin.
Now an infracaninophile is a body who has a sym
pathy for the underdog. This accounts for the re
markable upturn in the wholesale prices of the
dachshunds.
As for myself, I have always hated dachshunds.
This might stamp me as a supracaninophile, if it were
not for the fact that I do not like any dogs, no matter
how thin or in what plane you slice them. Personally,
I'll take a good, clean gutter rat. This would prob
ably get me in Dutch with the Humane Society, if it
were not for the fact that there is said to be a pro
gutter-rat element in the national organization.
By looking in dirty books, the psychologists can
give you a name if you are one who wants to jump
off of high places or if you are one who does not want
to jump off high places.
However, it is reported that there is a psychosis
prevalent on the Farm that nobody has named yet.
Those who arc in the know report that Stanford
women can be divided into two classes: those who
want to jump out of cars and those who do not want
to jump out of cars.
Being irrevocably opposed to all class conflicts,
particularly those caused by having two classes that
meet three times a week at 8 o'clock, I don't believe
it is true.
However, there is strong evidence that this jump
ing psychosis has assumed amazing proportions. Some
say it is caused by the volley ball craze. While others
say it comes from a desire not to play ball. Most men
agree it gives them a jumping pain.
At hand is information brought in by several H
men. A certain smoke house tiger-man who hashes to
the D.G.'s took out one of the members recently. While
they were riding around, the member suddenly an
nounced she wanted to jump out of the car.
Said the smoke house hero: "I don't care one way
or the other, but hurry up and shut the door. It's get
ting cold." This has earned him the tiger-man title,
and it is said that he is going to the Masque Ball in a
leopard skin.

At hand is information about the most beautiful
Phi P.si in the world, who is credited with reviving
the "Hello tradition" among Helena, Mont., telephone
girls this year.
He took the most beautiful Shirley Temple of Stan
ford out for a ride at one time. She suddenly got the
jumping psychosis into her bean.
In this case, the victim really jumped. So the Phi
P.si put himself and his car in low, and rode herd on
the young lady all the way back to the Phi Phi house.
They say he is going to the Masque Ball in a cow
boy suit. .
At hand is information that rumors have it that it
is reported that Our Hasher is going to the Masque
Ball attired as a gutter rat. The rumor is unfounded.
But ain't it fun, though? â€¢
