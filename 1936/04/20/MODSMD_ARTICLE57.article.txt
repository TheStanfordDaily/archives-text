In Tibet are the Lamas—tall, as- ,
cetic, yellow-skinned men of God
who live alone in monasteries cling
ing to bleak cliffs, out of the world
and away from its troubles—almost
a race apart.
At Stanford, we also have Lamas j
— Peninsula Lamas — pleasure-lov-

ing, of varying
heights, perenial
ly sunburnt, who
live in under- ■
.slung buildings /
out of the world I
and away from its '
troubles — a race
apart.
It's possible that
in the Tibet chap-j|
ter are monksß
who at least yenT
for a Shanghai
paper. And it's a

suppressed fact that in the Stanford
chapter there are heretics con
cerned with war and peace, what
Roosevelt is doing, and the opinions j
of such unpleasant outlanders as 1
Oswald Garrison Villard and Walter
Lippman.
Perhaps the reason the Tibet
Lamas don't take the Shanghai pa
pers is the lack of sufficient mem
bers who want them. Similarly, the
reason why Stanford is a cyclone
cellar so proof to external tempest
cellar so proof to external tempests
is that there aren't enough Stanford
Lamas who care about them. I

Those of us in the "collegiate- |
know" frequently speak of Cal's |

STANFORD'S LAMAS

"red-hots," always celebrating,
striking or rioting about an "issue"
intellectually verboten on the Farm.
We assume not only a greater
number, but a larger percentage of
these "unpleasant thinkers" at Cal
than at Stanford.
We are probably wrong: Stanford
has its thinkers and its organizations
devoted to thinking just as has Cal.
Moreover, the percentage of brain
users here is probably close to the
percentage at Berkeley.
But the number here is far less.
Stanford gives the impression of in
tellectual sterility because it has in
sufficient man-power to force fre
quent assemblies devoted to think
ing, and Cal gives the opposite im
pression only because it has that suf
ficient man-power.
For it seems fairly true, within
personal experience, that Cal's ma
jority and Stanford's majority are
equally careless of the destinies
manufactured in Washington and
Geneva that shapes their ends—in
bed or on a battlefield.
* * *
But Cal's majority, apathetic as
hell except when eggs are provided
for peace-strikers, is no match for
the powerful if small group of in
tellectual tanks who shove their is
sues right over Cal's ex committee.
Poor Stanford is short on intel
lectual tanks. Like the Tibet Lamas,
we haven't enough here to force a
subscription to the "Shanghai pa
pers," in our case, mass meeting,
perennial assemblies and punch
punctuated riots.
All of which is one explanation of

why we don't get more Norman
Thomases, and why, when we have
gotten them, it's usually not their
talks but Union coffee that is con
sumed. —Bob Eisenbach
