# Montgomery In 'Fever', Chan At Circus: Ho-Hum

) You may be disappointed in
"PETTICOAT FEVER," now at the
Fox-Stanford. Many months have
passed since Robert Montgomery
I has played in a picture, and Myrna

Loy is currently do
ing big things ("The
Great Ziegfeld,"
"Wife vs. Secre
tary"). A film star
ring them both
should be something

I special. "Petticoat Fever" is noth
| ing special.
I Ihe plot was taken from a so-so
j Broadway play, and you can tell it.
| A bored young man (Monigoiucry)
I operates a radio station someplace in
l the Labrador snow-fields. When a
I beautiful young woman (Miss Loy)
j and her titled fiance (Reginald
Owen) blow in on him from a plane
J crash, he promptly contracts an an
i noying case of "petticoat fever."
j For a radio operator who hasn't
seen a beautiful woman in two
years, Montgomery is alarmingly
adept at impromptu courting. But
Robert Montgomery always was.
J Yes, girls, I suppose he's still "cute."
I Too cute' if anything.
j I wasn't especially taken with
Myrna Loy this time. Her nose is
; still perky but her usually-sparkling
! sophistication is a bit flat. Maybe
j the lines are at fault—(the author's,
I not hers).

"CHARLIE CIIAN AT TIIE CIR
CUS" is, I guess, a better-than-av
erage companion feature but a
worse-than-average Charlie Chan
ner. Since the death of Earl Derr
Biggers, the Chinese detective's
originator, Fox's own writers have
been concocting his adventures with
just ordinary success. This one is—
well—just Charlie Chan at the cir
cus.
Though Charlie Chan and his en

algetic offspring probably wont' be
there, A1 G. Barnes and his ele
phants and things will be in Palo
Alto for a one-day stand tomorrow.
It's supposed to be more of a show
than Tom Mix's war. If you haven't
seen it every year since you were
three, it might be a good thing to
drop around. —Botsford
A tornado can take a tight-fitting
cork out of a bottle. It reduces the
air pressure to the extent that the
normal pressure inside the bottle
blows out the cork.
