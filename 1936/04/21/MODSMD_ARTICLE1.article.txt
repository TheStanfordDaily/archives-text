# Miners Fight To Liberate Buried Men
## Aid Near for Two Locked In Abandoned Shaft; Rescuers Race Time 
### 
MOOSE RIVER, N.S., April 2 (A*).
â€”Minutes slipped into hours as res
cuers fought through a solid wall of
rock to deliver the release they had
promised tonight to Dr. D. E. Rob
ertson and Alfred Scadding, im
prisoned for eight days in the Moose
River gold mine.
"We'll reach you in a few min
utes," the confident voice told the
cold, hungry, sickened men crouch
ing above the rising level of water
141 feet below the surface shortly
before 9 p.m.
One hour later the mine manager,
F. D. Henderson, said he could not
estimate the time needed to pene
trate the remaining feet of rock, be
lieved to be few.
Minutes or Hours
"It be a matter of minutes
and again it might be hours," Hen
derson told the crowd of anxious
watchers and the weary crew of
miners working desperately in short
shifts in a narrow shaft.
"But we'll have them out by
morning."
Apparently exhausted and fearful
of dynamite blasts which might send
tons of rock crashing down upon
them, Dr. Robertson and Scadding
repeatedly asked assurances from
the miners on the surface to push
their efforts to reach them.
"There is good drinking water
down here," they told the rescue
party, "but there is too much of it."
Charles Ivey, Robertson's broth
er-in-law, after an extended con
versation with the imprisoned man,
said they were "getting shaky."
Heard Rescuers
"They heard the rescuers," Ivey
declared, "but think they are so far
away they will take 10 or 12 hours.
He (Robertson) thinks we are lying
to him when we say a couple of
hours."
After the underground diggers re
ported they were nearly in contact
with the entombed men, Mrs. Rob
ertson said:
"They tell me it is only a ques
tion of shearing down and making
the passageway that they cut per
fectly safe. It may be two hours
yet. They want to be sure. Isn't it
wonderful?"
Talking to Ivey, Dr. Robertson
pleaded that no blasts be set off for
fear of caving in the jagged walls of
the old mine, recently purchased by
Robertson and a friend.
