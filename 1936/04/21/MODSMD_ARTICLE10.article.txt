# Plans For Junior Water Carnival Near Completion
## Entry List for Tilts Close Tomorrow at 1 o'clock, Eight Events Listed 
### Johnson Hill 
As campus living groups practice
water sports and transform canoes
into barges, Chairman Mort D'Eve
lyn yesterday gave detailed descrip
tions of the events scheduled for
the annual Junior Water Carnival
Friday afternoon on Lagunita.
Three additional organizations —
Madrona, Union, and Roble—have
entered the competition, D'Evelyn
said. Entry lists for all tilts close
tomorrow at 1 o'clock.
Events Listed
The events for men will include:
1. 100-yard free-style race. Swim
mers start at the boathouse, go
around the first raft, and return.
2. Canoe jousting, one man with
paddle and one jouster in each canoe.
Contestants will start in heats of 10
each and attempt to overturn rivals.
Poles will be provided.
3. Tandem racing. The inside arms
and legs of each pair of competitors
will be tied together. Each team
will dive from the Boathouse land
ing and propel itself for 50 yards by
any means of self-transportation.
4. Canoe racing. One entrant will
swim 75 years from shore to the
canoe containing his partner, climb
aboard, and paddle around the lake.
Tilts for Women
The four women's events are:
1. 100-yard free-style, over same
course used in men's race.
2. Nightgown race, requiring
teams of four. One and 3 start from
the Boathouse, 2 and 4 from the raft
50 yards out. One swims to the raft,
removes nightgown and gives it to
2, who puts it on and swims to 3,
etc. Nightgowns must have sleeves.
3. Inner tube race, with the tubes
tied together. Contestants will
mount tubes at the Boathouse and
race 75 yards.
4. Canoe bobbing. Each contestant
stands in one end of his canoo, and
by alternately raising and lowering
the prow, propels the canoe 75 yards
without paddling.
Special Racc Considered
From a number of groups re
quests have been received for a
mixed tandem swimming tilt, D'Eve
lyn stated. If five teams agree to
compete the event will be held as
an added attraction.
To add realism to the royal barge,
which will transport the king and
queen of the Carnival and Masque
Ball, Jimmy Kneubuhl, legal resi
dent of Pago Pago, Samoa, is giv
ing technical direction in decora
tion to committee members under
Harmon Howard.
