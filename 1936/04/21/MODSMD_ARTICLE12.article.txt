# Roughs Ask For Good Cooks, Good Looks in "Future Wives"

"Some like 'cm hot—some like I
'cm cold."
In a survey of "the kind of women !
Stanford men want to marry," the j
Stanford men agree in some of the |
main points only. Man's first 1
thought, it seems is, as usual, his i
stomach, so his first requirement is
that She must be a GOOD COOK. 1
But there were other things, too.
Most of the men in question had |
rather definite ideas. Only one,
Dinty Moore, had no ideas at all. !
"Just what I've seen in the movies."
Prexy Wally Brooke, admitting
his requirements were "immature," I
listed many specifications. She must
have an all-inclusive intelligence,
physical health, and be a helpmate,
not a patient to him. A sense of !
humor and slunk were listed as
well. Also, beauty which goes more
than skin deep. "However, I would
probably chuck most, of these under
certain circumstances, but why j
not?"
Creamer Disillusioned
"The age-old idea of any man's
picking his woman is quite obviously
ridiculous," says Dick Creamer, j
famous for his V.F W. move. Asking
for intelligence is entirely too much,
he modestly admits, as is a sense of

humor, for as far and as long as he
has looked (10 years) he can not find
one who will laugh at his gags.
Jim Copp, of the Stanford Chap
arral, says the woman he marries
must have a wooden leg, on which
he can carve a notch each time she
throws a rolling pin at him. Cheer
ful guy!
Our Hasher Lenient
Our Hasher, when quizzed, said,
"One who will support me in the
style to which I am accustomed."
He was the one person who didn't
require a good cook. "Naw, we can
live on love. And I don't want one
who smokes, but one who burns!"
But on second thought, he decided
he didn't want to get married. "I
wanna live in sin."
Sports Editor Breed said She's got
to be (1) lots of fun, (2) fairly in
tellectual, (3) fairly good looking,
(4) good cook, and he's not particu
lar as to hair, eyes, or figure. But
"I'm gonna be a bachelor," he said,
so that ended that.
Miscellaneous Items
Some accumulated suggestions for
us poor Stanford women have been
collected from various and sundry
Stanford Roughs. We hereby offer
them: She must be a good sport,
like football, sports, the theater,

horse racing, opera, roughing it,
horseback riding, 1 ike? to take a
chance, ;snd She must be a Stanford
j graduate. Some men say she can
, work after marriage if she wants to.
i And most men want to live in the
j country, or on a ranch, so she has
to like that, too. Whatawoman!
When Bob Gros was asked, he said
very definitely what he wanted,
j "as I am already engaged." Beauty,
I sweetness, culture, refinement are to
I be preferred to brains. She must be
i practical — "Lord deliver me from
! marrying an intellectual!" but I do
i crave common sense. (She is a jun
ior, and applications will be taken
. from 2 to 4 on Thursdays.)
Ilolloway Particular
Gib Holloway, "if ever able to
support a wife, asked for intelli—
gence, philosophic disposition, sym
i P*tby, physical activeness, and she
! will be "the finest of fine friends."
* Monk Moscrip prefers "blondes,"
j with good personalities, fairly good
figures, looks, etc. (hut anyone, as
! long as he loves her!) She can't drink
and must be just a moderate
smoker. Hank Luisetti was pretty
j bashful when contacted on the
I question.
Now go ahead, girls. This is Leap
| Year.
