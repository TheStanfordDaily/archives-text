# Row Over Thomas Causes Cal Revolt
## Cal Requests Axe For Rally Brooke Approves Lending Trophy to U.C. 
### 
U.C.'s request for the axe, tradi
tional Big Game trophy, will be one
of the main issues in tonight's Ex
Committee session.
The Berkeley campus wants the
trophy for their annual Axe Rally,
scheduled for Thursday night, to
prepare for Saturday's track meet.
Lending the axe would be a good
idea, considers President Wally
Brooke.
In the first place, he points out,
the agreement now in force between
the two schools would guarantee
that no damage would be done the
axe. The loan would also revive in
terest, besides creating good will in
case Stanford wants to borrow the
axe when Cal has it.
Campus sings, a suggested method
of building up campus good will,
will be discussed. Dean Marion
Kirkwood's ruling on the by-law
which provides that substitutes can
be named for Ex Committee mem
bers temporarily absent will be re
ported by President Brooke. Wheth
er or not the by-law will stand de
pends upon Kirkwood's interpreta
tion of it.
A dance after the Big Meet Sat
urday has been suggested for the
Toyon lobby.
