# House Approves Plane Increase
## 4,000 Planes Authorized For Air Corps by Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (/P). â€”
The House today passed a bill by
Representative Rogers (D., N.H.)
authorizing an increase of army air
corps' strength to 4000 planes. The
measure now goes to the Senate.
The present authorized strength
is 1800 planes, but War Department
officials contend the army air corps
is far below that figure. The pro
posed increase would be built up
over the next five years.
The House at the same time
passed a companion bill by Chair
man McSwain (D., S.C.) of the
House Military Committee for or
ganisation of an air reserve training
corps.
