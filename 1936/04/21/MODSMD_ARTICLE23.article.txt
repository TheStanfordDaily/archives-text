WASHINGTON, April 20 (/}'). -
Zoo officials today hailed the birtli
of triplet bears as phenomenal in
the animal world as the Dionne
quintuplets were among human be
ings.
"It's quite an accomplishment,,"
said Dr. William M. Mann, "for
bears to have three cubs in one lit
ter, but the astounding thing is that
they were born to breeds at the very
opposite ends' of the bruin family
tree, of which the mother is a kodiak
and the father is a polar.
