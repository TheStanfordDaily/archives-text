# Ethiopians Start Capitol Exodus
## Thousands Leave City As Enemy Reported 
### 
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (/P).â€”A
general flight from Addis Ababa
began today. Thousands poured out
on the Jima road, the nation's best
highway leading to the southwest,
or sought refuge in mountains.
Unfounded rumors led many to
believe the Italians actually were on
the outskirts of the capital, despite
the fact that the last reports from
Debra Birhan state they have not
yet begun an ascent of the moun
tains south of Dessye.
The rumors were sufficient to
start the exodus. Most of the 3000
foreigners in Addis Ababa remained
behind, including American, French,
and Swedish missionaries, who are
sticking to their jobs in hospitals.
Members of the royal family re
mained here. Emperor Haile Se
lassie is believed to be at the front.
Hundreds of persons besieged the
British Legation, which is well
equipped for defense. It has a well
fortified compound and bomb-proof
cellars.
