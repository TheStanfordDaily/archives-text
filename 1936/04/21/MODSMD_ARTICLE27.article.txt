### Les Squires 
Id re: the matter of the V.F.W.
The problem's this—
Are they shirkers, scamps, or fools,
Or merely communislie tools;
Are they forthright, honest, brave,
Or just spoiled kids who've never
learned how to behave.

The legion shakes its greying head,
Weighed down wilh troubles —
Pensions, bonuses, and big red
bubbles.
"What's the younger generation
coming to,"
They moan, "It's proper we get paid,
After all that we've been through;
* * * €
Cunning practice, then perhaps a
raid
On some Y.M.C.A. canteen.
The whole blame business's just a
screen,
To hide the fact that they're afraid
To lace with tact the fact that we've
been paid,
For doing what they've got to do,
And what they'll do before they're
through."

And Congress ponders on the fate
Of senators who deeply hate
To turn thumbs down on any bill
That helps the public drink its fill
From Uncle Samuel's buried treas
ure.
And then the boys who stage the
show,
Quite manly lads who hardly know
The depth of this new toy. To them
it's
Just a game, a sport that fits
Into the studied artificiality of life
In college. "Bring on your drum and
fife."
They say, "for here's a stunt'll break
The dull monotony. We're so blase!
We'll take
A chance on this. Blare out the
bugle call,
For after all—
It's still a month before the Senior
Ball.

In matters arithmetical
An answer's always right
And anything that doesn't fit
Has errors problematical.
In matters educational 7
The scholars have their say,
And anything that doesn't fit
They damn as mere sensational.
In matters governmental
The nine old men decide,
And anything that doesn't fit
They declare unconstitutional.
Alas, in matters personal
The public sets the pace,
And anything that doesn't fit
Is spurned with shrugs fanatical.
