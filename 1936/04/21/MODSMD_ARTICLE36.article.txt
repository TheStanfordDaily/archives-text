# RHYTHM FOR THE V.F.W.

### 
, The Editor, Sir:
A suggestion for a V.F.W. song to
j be sung to the tune of "She'll Be
I Coming Around the Mountain When
! She Comes."
j Oh we'll kill the old invaders when
they come,
Oh we'll kill the old invaders when
they come,
Oh we'll kill the old invaders and
feed them to the traitors,
■ Oh we'll kill the old invaders when
they come.
]
j Oh we'll cripple and we'll maim
them just for fun,
Oh we'll cripple and we'll maim
them just for fun,
Oh we'll cripple and we'll maim
them just to show you we can
tame them,
Oh we'll cripple and we'll maim
them just for fun.
Oh we'll shame the R.O.T.C. with
our brains,
: Oh we'll shame the R.O.T.C. with
our brains,
| Oh we'll shame the old Reserve
boys and use them all for decoys,

Oh we'll shame the R.O.T.C. With
our brains.
Oh a paltry thousand dollars is our
price,
Oh a paltry thousand dollars is our
price,
For a paltry thousand dollars we'll
wear gas masks for collars,
And we'll store our own traditions
on the ice.
Music is inspirational and the
melody of this famous old song
should arouse the fighting spirit of
every hopeful fodder on the Farm.
