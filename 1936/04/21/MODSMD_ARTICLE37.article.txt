# A.S.S.U. ON THE AIR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What is the possibility of a Stan
ford University radio station, a sta
tion managed as an A.S.S.U. activ
ity?
Considering the fact that there are
no stations on the peninsula be
tween San Jose and San Francisco,
such a project is not commercially
impossible, in view of the number of
local merchants in Palo Alto. etc.
Furthermore, the number of local
activities in sports, dramatics, and
other fields, along with student tal
ent, would supply a wide diversity of
programs, which could be answer
able to the students' desires for en
tertainment.
