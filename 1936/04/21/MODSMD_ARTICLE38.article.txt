# V.F.W. Plans Preparedness Day Parade
## Demonstration To Start At 2:30 from Library; Call Issued for Volunteers 
### 
A special Preparedness Day Pa
rade will march from the Reserve
Book Room at 2:30 o'clock today led
by Commander Dick Creamer and
his Stanford post of Veterans of
Future Wars.
At a meeting of Stanford's One-
Eyed Connelly Post last night,
Creamer issued a call for volunteers
to take part in the great demonstra
tion. 1
"We'll have martial music and
colorful banners and regalia,"
Creamer said. "The troops will
march over the campus invoking
the support of all red-blooded sons
of* Stanford."
'Music' Wanted
Volunteers who bring bass drums
or tubas will receive special decora
tion, he addi'd.
Plans for an all-campus jolly-up
sponsored by the Home Fire Divi
sion were placed in the hands of
Nancy Scoggins at the meeting last
night.
Commander Gros
Vice-commander Jim* Copp pro
posed that Bob Gros be named
commander of the Slackers of Fu
ture Wars, since he would apparent
ly be the only slacker and might as
well be the commander.
Creamer moved that the question
be dropped, contending that the age
limit in itself would prevent Gros
from being a veteran even of a
future war.
