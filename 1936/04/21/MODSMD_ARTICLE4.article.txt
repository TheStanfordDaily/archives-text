Two candidates at the bottom of

Dotty "Ina" Swett, Barbara "Ter
rific" Reinhardt, Ben "Body" Hen
! ley, a last-minute substitute for
•John "Frat House Freddie" Mer
ritt, and Larry "Carmel Kid."
The four last candidates following
tomorrow's balloting will also be
eliminated.
Rumor leaked out from the nom
inating committee last night to the
effect that there will be a sensational
exhibition at the polls and at the
Post Office at noon today.
Consternation reared its ugly head
before the committee when it was
discovered that there arc two Jack
Kings in school, as well as two Jean
McMillans, and the committee is at
loss to know which one of either
name is officially running.
Following yesterday's procedure,
the balloting will be closed during
the last five minutes today, and a
bonus will be awarded to the two
leading candidates at the end of
that period.
While the contest is garnering
much of the campus cash, plans for
the Masque Ball, over which the
king and queen will reign, are pro
gressing under the leadership of
Chick Franich, chairman of the Ball
committee.
! The Tahitian motif v/ill be car
| ried out in the decorations, and in
! the setting for the king and queen.
; Their palace will be a grass shack,
in which will be situated their log
| thrones. For the first time in the
history of the ball, the skit has been
written a week ahead of time. It is
the work of Jim "Old Boy" Copp,
j and will be his last contribution to
' Stanford dramatics and literature.
Costumes, which are being fur
nished by Goldstein's from San
Francisco, will be on display and
may be rented beginning today and
continuing throughout the wefck
from 10 to 5 o'clock in the A.S.S.U.
