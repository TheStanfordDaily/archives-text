With desire for revenge written
over their tanned countenances j
Stanford's netmen are making ready i
to meet their Golden Bear adver- 1
saries here at 1:30 o'clock this after- ;
noon.
It was the stubboifi California
outfit that knocked the props from '
under the Indians title hopes when J
they gi.ve them an unexpected lick
ing at Berkeley three weeks ago. I
On this former occasion Bob Under- |
wood and Bob Braly were the only |
farm netmen to win in singles, and j
Bill Seward and Underwood gar
nered the only Stanford doubles I
victory. The boys hope to do better
this time.
Dey Faces Bennett
John Law qnd Ben Dey, leading
lights of the local aggregation, will
face Dick Bennett and Paul Newton, i
California's classiest, in the two most |
important individual battles of the j
day. As their foemen came out on
the long end of the score last time,
the Indian aces are looked upon to j
show their top form today.
Third singles will see Bob Pcm- '
mer (S) matching strokes with
George Tanaka (C). Then Bob Un
derwood (S) is slated to tangle with
Tate Coulthard (C) while Bob Braly
tests his prowess against Harper ,
Massie, Bear captain. Lastly, Bill
Seward, another wearer of the Stan
ford sweater, meets Don White of
Cal.
Doubles Contests
In the doubles matches Seward
and Underwood (S) are favored to
repeat their triumph over Massie j
and Coulthard (C). Stanford's Dey- !
Pommer combination forced Cali- i
fornia's Bennett and Newton to three
sets last time, and are hopeful of
ekeing out a win over them today.
Law and Braly (S) are planning a |
warm reception for Tanaka and
White (C) in the terminating test of |
the afternoon.
While Coach Tom Stow of Cali
fornia could not be caught long I
enough to air his opinions, Sherman
Lockwood, Indian instructor, had
plenty to say. "We are out for blood
and for revenge this time," said the j
peace loving Mr. Lockwood, and fur
thermore "we are just beginning to ;
get in shape and should stage a I
comeback against Cal."
