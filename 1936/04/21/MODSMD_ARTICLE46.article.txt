2:j points in
THE DISTANCES?

While we're figuring just who is
going to win the Big Meet, in come
a couple of boys from the track team
who tell how we can score 23 points
in the three distance runs—23 out
of 27.
And here's how they figure: First
and third in the 880, sweep the mile,
and first and second in the two-mile.
The mile comes first, and should
see Nimmo and Dixon winning
easily. Cal's Bob Heavey will not
run, and their best man is Herbig,
who is not very good, so some Stan
ford man may get third.
Then in the two-mile Ed Burrows
is a pretty good bet to win. He beat
Freddy Yates of S.C. with a power
ful finish after running three and
one-half laps in the mile Saturday.
Then Chuck Nimmo could get sec
ond, and Voorhees, the Cal pace
runner, third.
The half is hardest to juggle
around. Bill McCurdy may win over
Dick Brace of Cal, who did not im
press in the Washington meet Sat
urday. Brace tried to make his usual
last 220 kick, and could not get any
where at all. Mac ran 1.56 against
Troy and can beat the Cal senior.
Joe Burris and Ray Malott have the
third place all to themselves.
Or Dink may juggle it a bit more,
putting Nimmo in the 880 and Dixon
in the two-mile. At any rate, 23
points is no wild guess.

HIGH SCHOOL PANTS
FOR DIXON, NIMMO

Speaking of Dixon and Nimmo, it
brings up the point of the incongrui
ties of the workout garb of this
pair. Both insist on wearing their
high-school running pants, seem
ingly believing in an athlete's super
stition of some sort.
Nimmo trots out for his daily
practice with a pair of mottled gray
flannel lowers, of such a length that
you can't tell for sure whether they
are long short pants or short long
pants.
Dixon's habitual running togs
are a pair of flaming faded yellow
lowers, harking back to the days
when Warren was a star half-miler
at Mission High School in the city.
And, more than just the faded yel
low lowers, the diminutive Dixon
insists on keeping a big safety pin
sticking on the rear, fastened up of
course, a souvenir of a race when

the runners had to wear numbers
on their backs.
A little hint on the Big Meet—
don't concede Mushy Pollock a win
in the 220 until he has beaten Ray
Dean. Dean almost took Foy Draper '
Saturday and he was a sick man at i
the time. He came through last year i
against Cal, and may repeat.
Miscellaneous note: Tom Coakley,
who once played basketball at Cal
(that's how we can fit him in here
somewhere), will still have to stay
up nights at the Frantic. He is 1
business manager for Carl Ravazza 1
(who is, incidentally, a fine tennis
player). —Breed
