# Varsity Nine To Play Aggies
## Cal Game Saturday Ends Regular Season 
### 
Card baseballers enter their last j
week of competition with games ;
scheduled against California Aggies
tomorrow and California next Sat
urday.
Coach Harry Wolter's nine will
probably be favored against the Ag
gies when they invade the Farm to- !
morrow. The only comparative ;
scores available show that the In- j
dians defeated Santa Clara, two
games out of three, whereas the
Broncos trimmed the Farmers, 4-0. I
Meet Bears Saturday
The Cal game on the Farm Sat
urday will be the third of the series, |
the Bears already having won the |
first two, which were played at
Berkeley.
Although the Cal game will close
the regular season, the Cards will
meet Waseta University next
month, when the Japanese team ar- i
rives in this country for a tour. !
Wolter is also contemplating some |
post-season practice games with the j
Moffat Field Air Squadron at Sun
nyvale.
