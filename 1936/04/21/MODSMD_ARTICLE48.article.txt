# Track Men Hopeful For Big Meet Win
## Voight Improved, Says He Will Run Saturday 
### Phil Klauber 
The bookies may be placing 2 to
j 1 against a Stanford win in the Big
j Meet in the stadium Saturday, but
\ no one would know it from the looks
) of things in track practice yesterday. !
All hands had straggled in from
! the week-end's adventure in the i
| south, and between time trials in
! this or that were arguing here and
there in little groups about where
| those 66 plus points will come from,
i Surprising that the trackmen them
! selves of all people are far and away
| the most optimistic on the campus.
Chuck Voigt, who pulled up lame
, in the 100 at U.S.C. and thought
; himself through for the season, came
| out to report he felt better and prob- 1
! ably would enter both sprints and
| the broad jump Saturday.
However, Cy Oberg took Chuck's
place on the injured list; Cy hit a :
hurdle in the low barrier race in i
Los Angeles and says he is through
for this year.

Amongst the booty brought home
I from the southern trip was a new
all-metal javelin that Coach Tem
pleton picked up cheap somewhere.
' The thing is straight from Finland,
| rumored to have been used by the
great Jarvinen, and the boys were
getting off some nice throws with it
last night, in spite of the fact that
it doesn't plunge into the grass as
j well as wooden ones do.
Also from Los Angeles came talk
that Troy is considering withdrawal
I in full from the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Meet at Berkeley May
29 and 30 in favor of the 1.C.4-A- at
i Cambridge. This gave rise to the
j first rumblings of the annual Stan
ford campaign for funds and per
mission to go to the big national
| meet.
