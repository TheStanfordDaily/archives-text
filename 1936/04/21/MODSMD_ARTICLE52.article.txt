# Frosh Aim at Little Big Meet Victory
## 
### 
Bill Ellington's frosh trackmen j
went through a strenuous workout j
on Angell Field yesterday in prepa
ration for Friday's Little Big Meet '
at Berkeley.
Frosh marks in last Saturday's
meet have raised Ellington's hopes
for victory, particularly Taggart's
leap of 22-8 in the broad-jump and
I Thompson's 21.9 220. Bill Hawkins,
j ace hurdler, was seen testing his skill
I with the discus, his first attempt of
the season in this department.
! Don Riggs, a husky 22-year-old
1 Eastern college student, is working
his way through school as a dress
' maker.
