## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Guest Privileges for Women Could Make Drive for Informal Contacts Succeed

Campus-wide ballyhoo urging informal con
tacts and more closely-knit reeling between
Hall and Row finally is getting results among
most of the Farm living groups.
Interfraternity Council is planning a well
organized program of exchange dinners and
inter-house "sings," several fraternities -and
sororities have scheduled exchange dinners,
and eating clubs are beginning to lake up the
cry by booking joint functions with each other
or with various fraternities and sororities.
'file only large factions of students that
remain in the recluse class are women of the
Stanford dormitories. And they aren't doing
it because they are snooty. Oh, no. To have a
guest for dinner at Lagunita, it costs the in
formal-contact-conscious co-ed who does the
inviting just 00 cents. The fare for lunch is
50 cents.
So it is not hard to understand why the
same faces, abetted by an alarmingly small
number of guests, adorn the dining tables of
the Koble, Lagunita, and Union units day
after day.
The t'nion women pay the usual 50 or 00-
cent fare even if they invite a guest from La
gunita, and the soup virtually conies out of
the same pot. Furthermore, the 50 and 00-

cent prices are more than the women pay for
their own meals.
If some system of free guest privileges were
set up, there would be no great change in the
number of women to be served at each meal.
Supposing there were 20 guests at one meal;
the chances are that on the same day 20 other
regular customers would be eating at a soro
rity house or at another dormitory.
Moreover, the dining hall management
could install a more accurate check if it were
deemed necessary. The women even could be
required to sign in a guest 24 hours early, as
many of the sororities do. Or they could work
out a system whereby each meal missed would
enable the paying-boarder to have one guest.
The fraternities and eating clubs have en
tirely free guest privilegesâ€”and no great Hood
of aliens ever taxes the budgeted food supply
to such an extent that the house manager or
sophomores go hungry. Even with a "hap
hazard system" like this, the houses and clubs
seem to make ends meet financially.
Inauguration of guest privileges in the
women's dormitories would give the move to
unify the Farm's social feeling a tremendous
boost, and it would enable Hall women to
get acquainted with fellow co-eds other than
their roommates or immediate neighbors.
