# Still a Great Talker; No Longer a Boogey-Man
## 
### 
The last time that Norman Thomas spoke
on the campus he talked for an hour to a
small group of L.1.1), and Walrus Club mem
bers in the basement of the Women's Club
house. That was two years ago.
The year before, though he offered to speak
to the campus, he was turned away because
"no presidential candidate can speak at the
University." That was during election year.
Now Stanford finally discovers that Farm
students don't have to go oil' behind the barn
to hear academic discussions on Socialism. ♦
Why this sudden reversal of form? Is the
great liberal college of the West getting very,
very liberal? Is it just because the talks are
on Peace, which everybody is willing to vote
for these days? Or is it due to the fact that
Norman Thomas, former preacher and presi
dential candidacy addict, is not feared by any
one any more?
After 10 years as America's number one
Socialist, Mr. Thomas has finally lost his
drawing power as number one boogey-man.
Fven the cradles of Western culture are find
ing out that a number one Socialist can be a
visionary evangelist.
The imiufediate class struggle elicits no en
thusiasm in the Thomas breast. His appeal
is not to the proletariat, but to the enlightened
lower middle class, to the idealists and emo
tionalists who band together in little coteries
in colleges and churches.
There is a distinct and pervasive aroma of
emotionalism in the soaring rhetoric and win
ning charm of a Thomas talk.
So Mr. Thomas will give a "stimulating"
speech today. Those of the faithful who at
tend will he "stimulated" — emotionally at
least; those who stay away will miss a bit of
"brilliant" oratory. In no event have the
reactionaries any reason to fear what Mr.
Thomas will sav.
