## "Evil" of the AAA 
### 
(From the Minnesota Daily)
Publicity for the huge AAA payments to a few
companies and individuals is significant at least in
revealing for the umpteenth time the absurdity and
shallowness of political argument, that of Republicans
and Democrats alike. With fine avoidance ol funda
mental facts and a traditional observance of super
ficiality, critics of the administration snatchcd up with
considerable glee the opportunity afforded by such
revelations as that of $1,000,000 paid out in benefits
in three checks.
♦ * * *
We do not, of course, expect the politician to forego
the opportunity, nor do we fail to recognize the reason
behind the attack. It is such an easy method of argu
ment. To the world's largest hog farming company was
paid $157,000. Ergo there must be something evil and
corrupt in the whole set-up of the AAA, and therefore
in the Democratic administration. No attempt is made
to delve more deeply into the matter and ascertain
exactly what the figures mean in relation to other
facts in the case.
» * * *
It requires but little more insight to realize the
relative significance of the figures, and then one won
ders if something very terrible had been unearthed
after all. Secretary Wallace pointed out that only .7
per cent of the cotton payments were in the $10,000
and-over class. The small producer, whose benefit
was the fundamental concern of the administration,
likewise received the lion's share in the other fields.
♦ » ♦ ♦
The real justification of the payments, however, is
that they were the price which the AAA had to pay
to secure the co-operation of the large scale farmers
and producers. The administration was committed to
the policy of raising farm prices by curtailment of
surplus. Unless the large units joined the program it
would have been impossible to inaugurate measures
to benefit the small producer.
Far from serving as a condemnation of the admin
istration, payment in proportion to the number of im
planted acres is only upholding the inviolability of
contact, so warmly advocated by Republicans.
