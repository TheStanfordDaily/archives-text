## UP IN ARMS AGAINST ARMS 
### 
Of course the quarter million or
so high school and college students
who will cut their 11 o'clock classes
tomorrow in the annual anti-war
strike won't know just why they ai - e

striking. The girls
will giggle and
the boys will look
defiant and all
will go out in the
yard and smoke
cigarettes or play
one-o-cat. Some
may attend as
semblies and
listen to tirades.
Some may write
editorials on "in
creased student
anti-war senti-

I ment" in student newspapers. Some J
j may go home and polish their i
R.O.T.C. boots.
Myself, I'm going to join the strike.
I'll cut the class taught by a man
who fought the Huns in 1917, walk
past the foundations of the new War
! Memorial theater, and sit in the
shadow of the Hoover War Library.
! Then I'll put my bright blue V.F.W.
: button out of sight and mutter: "Will
| you again unknit this churlish knot ,
! of all-abhorred War . . . ?" (Shake
' speare).
* * *
We as a university, however, will
not be up in arms against arms to- I
] morrow. Instead we're up in hot air
| for peace today, with exactly a i
J round dozen speakers, headed by
j Norman Thomas, due to sound off
between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m.
Tomorrow's strikers will have a
hard time figuring out how their
I class-cutting demonstration is going
to put any more "anti" in "anti
war," but today's peace conference
speakers will be just as much at a
loss putting more "further" in their
"peace furtherance" movement.
♦ * *
Stanford, however, as an entity
! should be proud of its peace move
[ ment today. For Stanford with its
I heritage of David Starr Jordan is a
peace-loving institution. Dr. Jordan,
the educator, the biologist, the phi
| losopher, was also a pacifist—a rabid
pacifist. He knew the fame or in
famy of being thrown off the capital
grounds for leading a peace parade
in the year America entered the last
war. He learned how futile it was to
j protest against inflamed jingoism.
* ■* *
Peace movements in peace time

are popular, but not nearly as popu
lar as preparedness moves in war
times. The end of action is more
stimulating than the end of mili
taristic inertia. And the peace move
ment, when the long list of national
movements in this country are con
sidered, probably graces the extreme
lower part of the list insofar as ef
fectiveness is concerned.
* * *
Almost everyone wants permanent
national peace, but almost no one
lives a life without hearing: "War
Declared." And to sit around tables
discussing ways and means of avoid
ing war is strangely suggestive of a
conference on methods of stopping
the next earthquake.
Wars, like earthquakes, are chiefly
remembered for the mischief they
bring, and wars like earthquakes are
quite impervious to fantastic plans
to stamp them out.
* * *
The American Student Union's
peace strike tomorrow is destined to
be a failure—a glorious, hooray-for
the-impossible failure.

Tomorrow's strikers will have a
hard time figuring out how their
I class-cutting demonstration is going
to put any more "anti" in "anti
war," but today's peace conference
speakers will be just as much at a
loss putting more "further" in their
"peace furtherance" movement.

Stanford, however, as an entity
! should be proud of its peace move
[ ment today. For Stanford with its
I heritage of David Starr Jordan is a
peace-loving institution. Dr. Jordan,
the educator, the biologist, the phi
| losopher, was also a pacifist—a rabid
pacifist. He knew the fame or in
famy of being thrown off the capital
grounds for leading a peace parade
in the year America entered the last
war. He learned how futile it was to
j protest against inflamed jingoism.

Peace movements in peace time

are popular, but not nearly as popu
lar as preparedness moves in war
times. The end of action is more
stimulating than the end of mili
taristic inertia. And the peace move
ment, when the long list of national
movements in this country are con
sidered, probably graces the extreme
lower part of the list insofar as ef
fectiveness is concerned.
* * *
Almost everyone wants permanent
national peace, but almost no one
lives a life without hearing: "War
Declared." And to sit around tables
discussing ways and means of avoid
ing war is strangely suggestive of a
conference on methods of stopping
the next earthquake.
Wars, like earthquakes, are chiefly
remembered for the mischief they
bring, and wars like earthquakes are
quite impervious to fantastic plans
to stamp them out.

The American Student Union's
peace strike tomorrow is destined to
be a failure—a glorious, hooray-for
the-impossible failure.

Of course the quarter million or
so high school and college students
who will cut their 11 o'clock classes
tomorrow in the annual anti-war
strike won't know just why they ai - e

striking. The girls
will giggle and
the boys will look
defiant and all
will go out in the
yard and smoke
cigarettes or play
one-o-cat. Some
may attend as
semblies and
listen to tirades.
Some may write
editorials on "in
creased student
anti-war senti-

I ment" in student newspapers. Some J
j may go home and polish their i
R.O.T.C. boots.
Myself, I'm going to join the strike.
I'll cut the class taught by a man
who fought the Huns in 1917, walk
past the foundations of the new War
! Memorial theater, and sit in the
shadow of the Hoover War Library.
! Then I'll put my bright blue V.F.W.
: button out of sight and mutter: "Will
| you again unknit this churlish knot ,
! of all-abhorred War . . . ?" (Shake
' speare).
* * *
We as a university, however, will
not be up in arms against arms to- I
] morrow. Instead we're up in hot air
| for peace today, with exactly a i
J round dozen speakers, headed by
j Norman Thomas, due to sound off
between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m.
