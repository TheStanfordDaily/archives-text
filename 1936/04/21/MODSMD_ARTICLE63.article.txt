# Daylight Saving Time Jumbles Radio Programs
## 
### 
GRIFF WILLIAMS, bandleader
who graduated from Stanford in '31,
is leaving the Mark Hopkins to tour
the country. He will be rep „ced
Friday, April 24, by the VELOZ
AND YOLANDA orchestra, direct- i
ed by GEORGE HAMILTON, play
ing a 16-day engagement in Peacock
Court. Veloz and Yolanda, dance
team par excellence, come here
from the Cocoanut Grove.
DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME,
with its usual resulting confusion to j
West Coast programs, starts Sun
day, April 26. Eastern broadcast
progi-ams will be heard out here
one hour earlier. Reason: radio ;
contracts are written in "current"
New York time.
When GEORGE BURNS and
GRACIE ALLEN; radio's prize nit
wits, were honeymooning in Mont- j
real, JACK BENNY phoned them
three times from Chicago to ask j
"What do you want?" Snapped the
exasperated George, "Ham and eggs, !
stupid," and hung up. Half an hour
later, 18 orders of ham and eggs ar
rived (collect) to the Burns' hotel
room, sent up from near-by restau
rants on urgent wires from Chicago.
