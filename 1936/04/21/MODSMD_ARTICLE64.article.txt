# Swords and Sandals Present Radio Play
## 
### 
"From day to day the work of a
newspaper is taken for granted. An
emergency proves its value" was the
theme of a play presented for a
radio audience last night by mem
bers of Sword and Sandals, cam
pus drama organization.
Using the San Francisco disaster
of 1906 as a basis for a story, the
group pointed out how the press in
action performed a civic service in
crushing wild rumors by carrying
out "its self-imposed duty of fur
nishing the news," against almost
impossible circumstances.
