# Off-Campus Total Hits $350
## Jerry Reed Appointed As Co-Head of Brunch 
### 
Announcing that the record
smashing sum of $350 had been
collected by the Convalescent Home
Drive off - campus committee of
which he is chairman, Art Lundin
said that he hoped to increase this
sum before the end of the week.
Over four times the total amount
collected last year, $350 marks a
new high in off-campus collections.
Meanwhile the only other news
to break on the Convalescent Home
Drive front was that Peg Woodard
is going to the national meeting of
the Y.W.C.A. next week and will no
longer be able to hold her place as
co - chairman of the Strawberry
Brunch.
Jerry Reed was appointed to take
her place. This was done because
she already knows most of the
necessary information about the
Brunch, having been in charge of
the entertainment committee for the
past several weeks, and in this ca
pacity helping on general plans.
