GABARDINE
I Suits for Young Men j
Gabardine drapes as does no other fabric. It has
a finish that's unique and distinctive. It wears well,
holds it's press better than most woolens. And,
it's one of the smartest suit fabrics for Spring.
These suits are styled for Young Men, with the |
new sports-back that is gathered in natural folds
above the belt, shoulders and pleated
patch pockets. They are suits that compliment
the athletic figure (and are kind
to embonpoint!) Pastel and dnrk 4% Wj|
shades of Blue, Brown and Grey
SINGLE OR DOUBLE-BREASTED MODELS
