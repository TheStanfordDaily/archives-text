# Hitler Is Priest Declares Pastor
## Dr. Turner Believes Spirit Is Sword of Peace 
### 
Th;it National Socialism in Ger
many has become a religion of race
with Hitler as its high priest was
the opinion of Reverend Dr. Ewart
E. Turner, pastor of the American
Church in Berlin, speaker at the
Tuesday night lecture.
Believing that should there be a
future war Germany will go bol
shevik, Reverend Turner says, "Hit
ler is sincere in his desire for peace,
believes he can secure by diploma
cy the restoration of Germany to its
pre-war power."
What Nazis most fear, Reverend
Turner believes, is a return of the
reactionary monarchical group to
power. The Communist movement,
weakened by nationalistic fervor
and Nazi repression, is virtually
nonexistent. Communists them
selves, completely disillusioned,
Reverend Turner observed, admit
the hopelessness of welding a polit
ical counter movement.
To explain the downfall of Ger
man democracy Reverend Turner
lists the eight national catastrophes
Germany has experiences since 1914.
The continuation of the food block
ade after (he loss of the war, the
signing of the Versailles treaty, in
flation, the Ruhr invasion, the sign
ing of the Young Plan and the col
lapse of 1929—these were the "coffin
nails" of the republic. To vindicate
these reverses Hitler has come to
power.
World peace, Reverend Turner
states, must come not by the sword
of Communism or national socialism,
only by the sword of the "spirit."
