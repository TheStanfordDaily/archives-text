### John McClelland 
"Yes, I'll probably run for presi
dent again."
It was the nation's number one
Socialist making this calm declara
tion of candidacy. Norman Thomas,
the man who was in and out of the
Farm yesterdayâ€”just long enough
to evoke loud applause from a Stan
ford audience with a mixture of
anti-war-Socialistic oratory and to
answer this and that reporter's
questions, and out before anyone
had a chance to answer back.
"I'd rather run for some of
fice in New York than l>c a presi
dential candidate again, but if
they nominate me, I'll accept . . .
We have to keep the public con
scious of the party, in other words
I'm not supporting Roosevelt."
Obviously Mr. Thomas is aware
that another campaign year is here.
Somebody who had met the great
liberal in the midwest mentioned
getting a job in Kansas. "Well, you
might get a job with Landon be
fore the election; certainly not
after." There was polite laughter at
this, and then: "Of course Landon
has done one thing commendable.
He's read a book. That's more than
most governors have done."
The local V.F.W.'s being so ob
viously present, Mr. Thomas was
led to make comment.
"It's a good thing but it can be
run to the ground," he said, eye
ing the big V.F.W. sign which was
held beside him when the picture
was snapped. "There is a positive
source of strength in expressions
for peace by the present college
generation."
Silver-haired, the vigorous polit
ical theorist who from the side re
minds one of Lewis Stone, the actor,
usually had time for a smile or a
quip, but when the serious is
brought up, he has a habit of gazing
beyond the crowd and weighing
carefully his comments.
Do you think the New Deal is
Socialistic?
"Emphatically no. Mr. Roose
velt did not carry out the Social
ist platform, unless he carried it
out on a stretcher. Not only is the
New Deal not socialist, but this
state capitalism, this use of bread
and circuses to keep the people
quiet, is largely the necessary de
velopment of a dying social or
der."
What do you think of the Supreme
Court's treatment of New Deal leg
islation?
"Recent Supreme Court decisions
have been dangerous to the country.
I cannot favor a system where the
government is ruled by the courts.
Ending the courts' power to legis
late is something necessarily desir
able."
Admitting that he is not his own
master insofar as his time is con
cerned, Mr. Thomas is being whisked
about by his manager as if he were
making a campaign tour.
Tonight he speaks in San Fran
cisco, and tomorrow he becomes, as
he admitted himself, the "storm
center at California" where lie will
talk outside, inside, or under "the
gate," according to the final results
of an administration - student con-
I n/vcrsy.
