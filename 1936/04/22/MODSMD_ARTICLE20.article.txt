# World Issues Discussed By Round Tables
## Students, Professors Join For Peace Confab 
### Margaret Loud 
Various aspects of peace and war
were examined in the nine round
table groups following the peace as
sembly yesterday. Each group be
gan with an informal talk by an
authority on the particular subject
and ended with discussion led by a
student chairman. Main points
brought out by the groups were:
LABOR, UNIONS, AND WAR—
Charles Hogan. The international
interests of labor are stronger than
those of any other group; as inter
nationalism is the only cure for war,
we can look to labor unions to ac
complish this end. If American
labor were strong enough to strike
generally, it could not only avert
war but could use its power to ac
complish other things.
IS WAR IN EUROPE IMMI
NENT?—Jean Pajus. "War is not
imminent. It will come, but not so
soon." The people of Fiance do not
want war and the sentiment of those
who have been the closest to the
danger spots is for peace at any
cost, because the French are sick and
tired of paying all the bills.
WAR AND PEACE IN THE FAR
EAST—Lt.-Commander S. F. Bry
ant. Japan has no one great control
over her military forces; the United
States has more favorable advan
tages for advancement than " any
other nation in the world. These are
the main causes of unrest between
America and the Orient. Others are
yellow journalism and tariffs, forces
within our control.
Japan is progressive and needs
more markets for products to buy
those which she can not produce. It.
is possible that she will take the
Philippine Islands for agriculture if
the United States entirely frees
them.
DOES AMERICAN NEUTRALITY
MEAN WAR—Professor Philip W.
Buck. The economic embargo and
suspension of equal rights clauses
in the existing neutrality law would
lead to an economic depression and
immediate- unemployment in the
United States in the event of a war.
FASCIST TRENDS IN THE
UNITED STATES—Bert Leech. One
of the most outstanding examples
of the Fascist element is William
Randolph Hearst, the Hearst press,
and the general press.
In California, the two crucial
points for Fascist movements are in
the maritime and agricultural situa
tions. In the nation as a whole, the
American Liberty League is one of
the focal Fascist elements.
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF WAR
—Bernard F. Haley. There arc four
economic circumstances propitious
to war: colonial development, ex
port of capital to foreign countries,
pressure of population, and fight for
more raw materials. Nations feel
the need for more colonies to in
sure raw materials and trade. The
high tariff barrier of one country
against another does nother to fur
ther peace.
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN
TIIE PEACE MOVEMENT—Student
Panel. Students are comparable to
an organized labor group because
they have little at stake in a war
and nothing to g.m», Peace assem
blies should result from student ini
tiative, not from a wish of the Uni
versity faculty. Then, those inter
ested in peace could call student
meetings in times of crisis. The
value of the American Student Un
ion lies in its united front.
CAN THE CHURCH LEAD
FIGHT FOR PEACE?—Rev. Harold
Brewster. Development of Chris
tian forgiveness of enemies is the
only possible way out of the pres
ent war danger. If men would take
gospel teachings more seriously
and conquer their own anger, paci
fism would advance far. The church
has always fostered truth, learning,
and intelligence, without which
there can be no peaceful democ
racy.
PROPAGANDA AND WAR —
Ralph 11. I.ut/. In the event of an
other war, propaganda will prob
ably be necessary. The organization
and handling of that propaganda
will follow defined media. Although
educated peoples are as suscep
tible to its influence as the unedu
cated, education is the only pro
tection against propaganda.
WAR AND THE CONSCIEN
TIOUS OBJECTOR: Guido Marx,
speaker at the peace dinner. "The
moral equivalent for war is war
against war. But if you enlist in
this war, you must not do it with
any less earnestness, intelligent con
viction, and utter devotion than you
would enlist wtih in any other war.
And do not expect any quarter—for
you'll get none."

American Liberty League is one of
the focal Fascist elements.
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF WAR
—Bernard F. Haley. There arc four
economic circumstances propitious
to war: colonial development, ex
port of capital to foreign countries,
pressure of population, and fight for
more raw materials. Nations feel
the need for more colonies to in
sure raw materials and trade. The
high tariff barrier of one country
against another does nother to fur
ther peace.
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN
TIIE PEACE MOVEMENT—Student
Panel. Students are comparable to
an organized labor group because
they have little at stake in a war
and nothing to g.m», Peace assem
blies should result from student ini
tiative, not from a wish of the Uni
versity faculty. Then, those inter
ested in peace could call student
meetings in times of crisis. The
value of the American Student Un
ion lies in its united front.
CAN THE CHURCH LEAD
FIGHT FOR PEACE?—Rev. Harold
Brewster. Development of Chris
tian forgiveness of enemies is the
only possible way out of the pres
ent war danger. If men would take
gospel teachings more seriously
and conquer their own anger, paci
fism would advance far. The church
has always fostered truth, learning,
and intelligence, without which
there can be no peaceful democ
racy.
PROPAGANDA AND WAR —
Ralph 11. I.ut/. In the event of an
other war, propaganda will prob
ably be necessary. The organization
and handling of that propaganda
will follow defined media. Although
educated peoples are as suscep
tible to its influence as the unedu
cated, education is the only pro
tection against propaganda.
WAR AND THE CONSCIEN
TIOUS OBJECTOR: Guido Marx,
speaker at the peace dinner. "The
moral equivalent for war is war
against war. But if you enlist in
this war, you must not do it with
any less earnestness, intelligent con
viction, and utter devotion than you
would enlist wtih in any other war.
And do not expect any quarter—for
you'll get none."
Various aspects of peace and war
were examined in the nine round
table groups following the peace as
sembly yesterday. Each group be
gan with an informal talk by an
authority on the particular subject
and ended with discussion led by a
student chairman. Main points
brought out by the groups were:
LABOR, UNIONS, AND WAR—
Charles Hogan. The international
interests of labor are stronger than
those of any other group; as inter
nationalism is the only cure for war,
we can look to labor unions to ac
complish this end. If American
labor were strong enough to strike
generally, it could not only avert
war but could use its power to ac
complish other things.
IS WAR IN EUROPE IMMI
NENT?—Jean Pajus. "War is not
imminent. It will come, but not so
soon." The people of Fiance do not
want war and the sentiment of those
who have been the closest to the
danger spots is for peace at any
cost, because the French are sick and
tired of paying all the bills.
WAR AND PEACE IN THE FAR
EAST—Lt.-Commander S. F. Bry
ant. Japan has no one great control
over her military forces; the United
States has more favorable advan
tages for advancement than " any
other nation in the world. These are
the main causes of unrest between
America and the Orient. Others are
yellow journalism and tariffs, forces
within our control.
Japan is progressive and needs
more markets for products to buy
those which she can not produce. It.
is possible that she will take the
Philippine Islands for agriculture if
the United States entirely frees
them.
DOES AMERICAN NEUTRALITY
MEAN WAR—Professor Philip W.
Buck. The economic embargo and
suspension of equal rights clauses
in the existing neutrality law would
lead to an economic depression and
immediate- unemployment in the
United States in the event of a war.
FASCIST TRENDS IN THE
UNITED STATES—Bert Leech. One
of the most outstanding examples
of the Fascist element is William
Randolph Hearst, the Hearst press,
and the general press.
In California, the two crucial
points for Fascist movements are in
the maritime and agricultural situa
tions. In the nation as a whole, the
American Liberty League is one of

sembly yesterday. Each group be
gan with an informal talk by an
authority on the particular subject
and ended with discussion led by a
student chairman. Main points
brought out by the groups were:
LABOR, UNIONS, AND WAR—
Charles Hogan. The international
interests of labor are stronger than
those of any other group; as inter
nationalism is the only cure for war,
we can look to labor unions to ac
complish this end. If American
labor were strong enough to strike
generally, it could not only avert
war but could use its power to ac
complish other things.
IS WAR IN EUROPE IMMI
NENT?—Jean Pajus. "War is not
imminent. It will come, but not so
soon." The people of Fiance do not
want war and the sentiment of those
who have been the closest to the
danger spots is for peace at any
cost, because the French are sick and
tired of paying all the bills.
WAR AND PEACE IN THE FAR
EAST—Lt.-Commander S. F. Bry
ant. Japan has no one great control
over her military forces; the United
States has more favorable advan
tages for advancement than " any
other nation in the world. These are
the main causes of unrest between
America and the Orient. Others are
yellow journalism and tariffs, forces
within our control.
Japan is progressive and needs
more markets for products to buy
those which she can not produce. It.
is possible that she will take the
Philippine Islands for agriculture if
the United States entirely frees
them.
DOES AMERICAN NEUTRALITY
MEAN WAR—Professor Philip W.
Buck. The economic embargo and
suspension of equal rights clauses
in the existing neutrality law would
lead to an economic depression and
immediate- unemployment in the
United States in the event of a war.
FASCIST TRENDS IN THE
UNITED STATES—Bert Leech. One
of the most outstanding examples
of the Fascist element is William
Randolph Hearst, the Hearst press,
and the general press.
In California, the two crucial
points for Fascist movements are in
the maritime and agricultural situa
tions. In the nation as a whole, the
American Liberty League is one of
the focal Fascist elements.
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF WAR
—Bernard F. Haley. There arc four
economic circumstances propitious
to war: colonial development, ex
port of capital to foreign countries,
pressure of population, and fight for
more raw materials. Nations feel
the need for more colonies to in
sure raw materials and trade. The
high tariff barrier of one country
against another does nother to fur
ther peace.
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN
TIIE PEACE MOVEMENT—Student
Panel. Students are comparable to
an organized labor group because
they have little at stake in a war
and nothing to g.m», Peace assem
blies should result from student ini
tiative, not from a wish of the Uni
versity faculty. Then, those inter
ested in peace could call student
meetings in times of crisis. The
value of the American Student Un
ion lies in its united front.
CAN THE CHURCH LEAD
FIGHT FOR PEACE?—Rev. Harold
Brewster. Development of Chris
tian forgiveness of enemies is the
only possible way out of the pres
ent war danger. If men would take
gospel teachings more seriously
and conquer their own anger, paci
fism would advance far. The church
has always fostered truth, learning,
and intelligence, without which
there can be no peaceful democ
racy.
PROPAGANDA AND WAR —
Ralph 11. I.ut/. In the event of an
other war, propaganda will prob
ably be necessary. The organization
and handling of that propaganda
will follow defined media. Although
educated peoples are as suscep
tible to its influence as the unedu
cated, education is the only pro
tection against propaganda.
WAR AND THE CONSCIEN
TIOUS OBJECTOR: Guido Marx,
speaker at the peace dinner. "The
moral equivalent for war is war
against war. But if you enlist in
this war, you must not do it with
any less earnestness, intelligent con
viction, and utter devotion than you
would enlist wtih in any other war.
And do not expect any quarter—for
you'll get none."
