# Thomas Blasts Profits
## Jibes Roosevelt, London Socialist Leader Will Run For Presidency Again In Event of Nomination 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
I Flailing his arms, beating his fists j
on the platform stand, wringing his '
! audience in alternate trances of '
: emotional enthusiasm and strain- j
| lifting laughter, a reformed minister
conducted a revival in the Assembly i
j Hall yesterday afternoon.
The former minister was Norman
| Thomas, four times candidate for
J president of the United States, and
white-haired boy of American so
! cialism.
Crowd Enthusiastic
With enthusiasm and widespread j
| applause, the audience of 1200, made
, up of many Palo Alto oldsters and a
; good sprinkling of students, filled
the lower floor of the hall and part
of the balcony, and listened to the
cotton - pated speaker gesture
through the ills of capitalistic na-
I tionalism.
He pointed to heaven and he
pointed to hell, but he made it plain
to his hearers that war was hell, and |
that the profit motive, and the econ- I
omy of scarcity were at the very j
bottom of it.
The subject of the talk was "War j
or Civilization" and it was a cred- '<
i itable performance.
Mr. Thomas was introduced by !
Ken Livingston, former student !
body presidential candidate, who I
promised the speaker and the audi- j
ence that there was a rebirth of en- ,
lightenment on student opinion, as j
manifested in the nationwide student
! peace-strike.
Drayton S. Bryant preambled the
main speech by saying ihat agitation
was not useless, and urging students
tired of "intellectual tree-sitting
and the perfect level of scholastic
futility" to join with campus or
ganizations established to discuss
these problems.

Mr. Thomas did not reveal any
startling secrets about war. He
did not offer any universal cure
all or palliatives. He did not prom
ise any immediate hope of avert
ing war. save by painful surgery at
the root of the economy of scarc
ity. He did not intend to. He re
stated in a forceful, simplified, and
entertaining way the fundamental
stand of American Socialists.
The speaker graphically painted
the horrors of war in a mechanized
society, doubting that modern de
fense methods would enable modern
cities to protect themselves against
a persistent and concerted bombing
attack. If the defense were once
penetrated, Thomas said that once
would be enough, that the results
would be the devastation of cities,
and eventually civilization.
"We can allow for overstatement
in the direct casualties of war," he
said, "but we cannot deny that a war
in such a complex society as ours
will be such a tragedy of social de
struction and disorganization as the
world has never seen."
Even though the oceans seem to
protect the United States, he said
that the United States could not
stand the strain on its social institu
tions caused by a complete collapse
of Europe or Asia.
The horrors painted, he wrapped
his audience around the causes of
war and the chances of averting it.
Profits Denounced
Denying that war is inherent, that
it stimulates progress, that it is bio
logical, Mr. Thomas laid the cause
of war on the gilded doorstep of the
"Golden Calf." "You can't main
tain peace and the worship of profit
at the same time," he said.
Though living in an economy of
abundance, the people of Ihe world,
he says, have stupidly refused to
face the fact that there is no longer
a need for exploitation of each other,
but the profit system and the edu
cational program set up by the profit
system have blinded them to the
fact.
Favors Neutrality
Granting that there was no hope
for immediate change in the pres
ent system, the speaker advocated
ameliorative activities such as abso
lute and rigid neutrality, national
ization of the profits of war, and re
duction of armaments.
Peace strikes he looked on with
favor as "peace is something that
has to be waged no less than war."
But the fundamental problem re
mains unsolved.
He pleaded with youth that they
attempt to face intelligently the
problems of the existing system, and
fight to change the problems. "You
cannot win without suffering, but
you can win."

his audience around the causes of
war and the chances of averting it.
Profits Denounced
Denying that war is inherent, that
it stimulates progress, that it is bio
logical, Mr. Thomas laid the cause
of war on the gilded doorstep of the
"Golden Calf." "You can't main
tain peace and the worship of profit
at the same time," he said.
Though living in an economy of
abundance, the people of Ihe world,
he says, have stupidly refused to
face the fact that there is no longer
a need for exploitation of each other,
but the profit system and the edu
cational program set up by the profit
system have blinded them to the
fact.
Favors Neutrality
Granting that there was no hope
for immediate change in the pres
ent system, the speaker advocated
ameliorative activities such as abso
lute and rigid neutrality, national
ization of the profits of war, and re
duction of armaments.
Peace strikes he looked on with
favor as "peace is something that
has to be waged no less than war."
But the fundamental problem re
mains unsolved.
He pleaded with youth that they
attempt to face intelligently the
problems of the existing system, and
fight to change the problems. "You
cannot win without suffering, but
you can win."
I Flailing his arms, beating his fists j
on the platform stand, wringing his '
! audience in alternate trances of '
: emotional enthusiasm and strain- j
| lifting laughter, a reformed minister
conducted a revival in the Assembly i
j Hall yesterday afternoon.
The former minister was Norman
| Thomas, four times candidate for
J president of the United States, and
white-haired boy of American so
! cialism.
Crowd Enthusiastic
With enthusiasm and widespread j
| applause, the audience of 1200, made
, up of many Palo Alto oldsters and a
; good sprinkling of students, filled
the lower floor of the hall and part
of the balcony, and listened to the
cotton - pated speaker gesture
through the ills of capitalistic na-
I tionalism.
He pointed to heaven and he
pointed to hell, but he made it plain
to his hearers that war was hell, and |
that the profit motive, and the econ- I
omy of scarcity were at the very j
bottom of it.
The subject of the talk was "War j
or Civilization" and it was a cred- '<
i itable performance.
Mr. Thomas was introduced by !
Ken Livingston, former student !
body presidential candidate, who I
promised the speaker and the audi- j
ence that there was a rebirth of en- ,
lightenment on student opinion, as j
manifested in the nationwide student
! peace-strike.
Drayton S. Bryant preambled the
main speech by saying ihat agitation
was not useless, and urging students
tired of "intellectual tree-sitting
and the perfect level of scholastic
futility" to join with campus or
ganizations established to discuss
these problems.

Mr. Thomas did not reveal any
startling secrets about war. He
did not offer any universal cure
all or palliatives. He did not prom
ise any immediate hope of avert
ing war. save by painful surgery at
the root of the economy of scarc
ity. He did not intend to. He re
stated in a forceful, simplified, and
entertaining way the fundamental
stand of American Socialists.
The speaker graphically painted
the horrors of war in a mechanized
society, doubting that modern de
fense methods would enable modern
cities to protect themselves against
a persistent and concerted bombing
attack. If the defense were once
penetrated, Thomas said that once
would be enough, that the results
would be the devastation of cities,
and eventually civilization.
"We can allow for overstatement
in the direct casualties of war," he
said, "but we cannot deny that a war
in such a complex society as ours
will be such a tragedy of social de
struction and disorganization as the
world has never seen."
Even though the oceans seem to
protect the United States, he said
that the United States could not
stand the strain on its social institu
tions caused by a complete collapse
of Europe or Asia.

was not useless, and urging students
tired of "intellectual tree-sitting
and the perfect level of scholastic
futility" to join with campus or
ganizations established to discuss
these problems.

Mr. Thomas did not reveal any
startling secrets about war. He
did not offer any universal cure
all or palliatives. He did not prom
ise any immediate hope of avert
ing war. save by painful surgery at
the root of the economy of scarc
ity. He did not intend to. He re
stated in a forceful, simplified, and
entertaining way the fundamental
stand of American Socialists.
The speaker graphically painted
the horrors of war in a mechanized
society, doubting that modern de
fense methods would enable modern
cities to protect themselves against
a persistent and concerted bombing
attack. If the defense were once
penetrated, Thomas said that once
would be enough, that the results
would be the devastation of cities,
and eventually civilization.
"We can allow for overstatement
in the direct casualties of war," he
said, "but we cannot deny that a war
in such a complex society as ours
will be such a tragedy of social de
struction and disorganization as the
world has never seen."
Even though the oceans seem to
protect the United States, he said
that the United States could not
stand the strain on its social institu
tions caused by a complete collapse
of Europe or Asia.
The horrors painted, he wrapped
his audience around the causes of
war and the chances of averting it.
Profits Denounced
Denying that war is inherent, that
it stimulates progress, that it is bio
logical, Mr. Thomas laid the cause
of war on the gilded doorstep of the
"Golden Calf." "You can't main
tain peace and the worship of profit
at the same time," he said.
Though living in an economy of
abundance, the people of Ihe world,
he says, have stupidly refused to
face the fact that there is no longer
a need for exploitation of each other,
but the profit system and the edu
cational program set up by the profit
system have blinded them to the
fact.
Favors Neutrality
Granting that there was no hope
for immediate change in the pres
ent system, the speaker advocated
ameliorative activities such as abso
lute and rigid neutrality, national
ization of the profits of war, and re
duction of armaments.
Peace strikes he looked on with
favor as "peace is something that
has to be waged no less than war."
But the fundamental problem re
mains unsolved.
He pleaded with youth that they
attempt to face intelligently the
problems of the existing system, and
fight to change the problems. "You
cannot win without suffering, but
you can win."
