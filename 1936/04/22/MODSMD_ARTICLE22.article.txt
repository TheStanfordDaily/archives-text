I Flailing his arms, beating his fists j
on the platform stand, wringing his '
! audience in alternate trances of '
: emotional enthusiasm and strain- j
| lifting laughter, a reformed minister
conducted a revival in the Assembly i
j Hall yesterday afternoon.
The former minister was Norman
| Thomas, four times candidate for
J president of the United States, and
white-haired boy of American so
! cialism.
Crowd Enthusiastic
With enthusiasm and widespread j
| applause, the audience of 1200, made
, up of many Palo Alto oldsters and a
; good sprinkling of students, filled
the lower floor of the hall and part
of the balcony, and listened to the
cotton - pated speaker gesture
through the ills of capitalistic na-
I tionalism.
He pointed to heaven and he
pointed to hell, but he made it plain
to his hearers that war was hell, and |
that the profit motive, and the econ- I
omy of scarcity were at the very j
bottom of it.
The subject of the talk was "War j
or Civilization" and it was a cred- '<
i itable performance.
Mr. Thomas was introduced by !
Ken Livingston, former student !
body presidential candidate, who I
promised the speaker and the audi- j
ence that there was a rebirth of en- ,
lightenment on student opinion, as j
manifested in the nationwide student
! peace-strike.
