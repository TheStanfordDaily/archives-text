# Full Agreement Ends S.F. Strike
## Federal Judge Confers With Spokesmen 
### 
Peace terms, ending the San Fran
cisco longshoremen's dock strike,
were signed yesterday by members
of the Waterfront Employers' Asso
ciation and representatives of the
strikers.
Cessation of the strike came after
a meeting with Judge M. C. Sloss,
federal arbitrator, at. which it was
determined that work should no
longer be hindered, that longshore
men will handle hot cargo, and that
all disputes will be settled by Judge
Sloss.
Following the agreement, more
than 1600 men were ordered to re
port for duty on the 40-odd ships
which were standing idle in the bay.
Those signing the agreement were
Harry Bridges, president; and Ivan
Cox, secretary, San Francisco Local
38-79, 1.L.A.; William J. Lewis, Pa
cific Coast president, and W. T.
Morris, Seattle, secretary, District
38, 1.L.A., and Thomas G. Plant,
president, and A. Boyd, secretary,
Waterfront Employers' Association.
Spokesmen from the three groups
agreed unconditionally to abide by
the agreement, the award, and the
conditions of the court's service. In
his questions, Judge Sloss made it
plain that he wanted definite an
swers from the representatives,
particularly concerning "job action"
and "hot cargo."
