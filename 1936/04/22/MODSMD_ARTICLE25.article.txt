# Ex Committee Loans Axe To Cal For Rally
## 'Unconstitutional' By-Law Made Legal; Group Encourages 'Spring Sing' 
### 
j California will have the axe for
! their annual pre-meet Axe Rally
I tomorrow night, decided Ex Com
' mittee.
The group agreed that there was
little possibility that the trophy
would not be returned intact. "After
all, you can't eat an axe," sagely ob
served President Wally Brooke.
Creation* of future good will was
the major reason for the philanthro
pic gesture. Second was the seem
ingly irreconcilable satisfaction of
"dangling it before their faces."
CONSTITUTIONALITY of the
much-discussed temporary appoint
ment by-law is "in part valid and in
part invalid," according to a report
from Dean Marion R. Kirkwood.
If the member is still registered in
school, but unable to perform Ex
Committee duties, a temporary
substitute can be named. If he
drops out of school, a special elec-
I tion will be necessary.
BOBBY GRAYSON's position, the
j emergency for which the by-law was
I passed, will be filled next week. An
! appointment, made then will come
' under the "month before regular
| election" clause of the constitution,
j making the by-law unnecessary,
j "Maybe we'll need it sometime,
j though," said Brooke.
A POST-MEET DANCE, sug
, gested by Myron Birnbaum, who of
| fered to provide a ten-piece orches
tra, will probably not be held. The
jolly-up, if held, would conflict with
the baseball game and next week's
Convalescent Home jolly-to.
A SPRING SING, to be held at
the "pavilion, sunken diamond, polo
field, football practice field, stadium,
or shores of Lagunita"—"or the Deke
house," supplied Hank Luisetti—will
! be given a trial at the Labor Day
I barbecue.
Accompaniment and songs will be
; furnished, and if the affair is a
| success the "spring sing" may be
! added to the list of Stanford insti
, tutions. "Quite ethereal, out not so
.silly as it sound," was Brooke's re
action.
"Any more business?" queried
Brooke. "Let's have a party in the
city," suggested Gib H >!loway The
motion was overlokoed.
DATES GRANTED included
Theta, May (i; Class of '36, May 7;
Pi Phi, May 9; Lagunita, May 14;
j Class of '36, May 14; Sequoia, May
j Hi; Phi Phi, May 30; Quad, May 30;
j Union, May I—"if they can get
j dates. There arc three other dances
that night," amended the commit
tee.
NOMINATIONS should be made
by a more efficient system than the
present haphazard and biased cau
cuses, suggested Brooke. Ex Com
mittee agreed.
An investigating committee com
posed of Gib Holloway, Hank Lui
setti, Chick Franich, and Jean An
derson w'll conduct research in an
j effort to see if the present Hall-Row
I split, is inevitable, or if some other
! system could be adopted.
Charges that Row caucuses were
| hold with hand-picked delegates,
j that the Hall caucuses at least had
the virtue of being open meetings
.but were controlled by regimented
I groups, were made.
Suggestions included recognition
! of tli" Hall-Row split, factions as
separate parties, with reorganized
nominating systems; a combined
caucus for the entire campus; elim
ination of "machines"; and an in
terfraternity-chosen group of dele
gates for Row meetings.
I Absent were Bobby Grayson and

I in Palo Alto.

Suggestions included recognition

separate parties, with reorganized

caucus for the entire campus; elim
ination of "machines"; and an in
terfraternity-chosen group of dele

I Absent were Bobby Grayson and

I in Palo Alto.
j California will have the axe for

I tomorrow night, decided Ex Com

little possibility that the trophy
would not be returned intact. "After

served President Wally Brooke.
Creation* of future good will was
the major reason for the philanthro
pic gesture. Second was the seem
ingly irreconcilable satisfaction of
"dangling it before their faces."
CONSTITUTIONALITY of the
much-discussed temporary appoint
ment by-law is "in part valid and in
part invalid," according to a report
from Dean Marion R. Kirkwood.
If the member is still registered in
school, but unable to perform Ex
Committee duties, a temporary
substitute can be named. If he
drops out of school, a special elec-
I tion will be necessary.
BOBBY GRAYSON's position, the
j emergency for which the by-law was
I passed, will be filled next week. An
! appointment, made then will come
' under the "month before regular
| election" clause of the constitution,
j making the by-law unnecessary,
j "Maybe we'll need it sometime,
j though," said Brooke.
A POST-MEET DANCE, sug
, gested by Myron Birnbaum, who of
| fered to provide a ten-piece orches
tra, will probably not be held. The
jolly-up, if held, would conflict with
the baseball game and next week's
Convalescent Home jolly-to.
A SPRING SING, to be held at
the "pavilion, sunken diamond, polo
field, football practice field, stadium,
