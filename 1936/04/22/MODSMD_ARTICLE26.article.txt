THE NETHERLANDS haven't
had a prominent figure in the world
of painting since the old Dutch mas
ters. They've been too busy coloniz
ing and keeping their guilder on the !
gold basis.
But along comes this Vincent Van
Gogh, and he has the critics compar-,.
ing him to Rembrandt in his ap- j
proach to the common things in life.
A Van Gogh exhibition will open j
next Tuesday at the Palace of the
Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park,
San Francisco. The snme collection
of pieces that broke all attendance !
records at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York will go on display.
VAN GOGH had a tough time of
it. He worked in his uncle's art
firm for a while, then taught school
in England, then became a minister
of the gospel in a miserable Belgian
mining community. Not until he
was 28 did he decide to become a j
painter.
In Holland he struggled for five
years learning to paint and trying
to keep body and soul together at the 1
same time. During this * miserable
part of his life his paintings were
dark and murkyâ€”brownish greens
and dull subjects. In 1886 he was 33
and went to Paris, and his works be- '
gan to brighten as everyone's must j
the minute they get to Paris. In
France he met the impressionists, j
and expressed his passionate inter
est in the working classes.
He sold only two of the 700 can
vases he painted and lived in misery \
most of the time. Not until after his
death did the world take any recog
nition of his works. Then, sud- j
denly, came an international appre
ciation of the things he had painted.
Today he is almost a fad with
pseudo-appreciators of art. Textile
manufacturers have printed silks j
with the brilliant patterns that he
created, and these "Van Gogh
Prints" are the most expensive
dress-making materials.
Whoever "discovered" Van Gogh
did the world a favor, and, although j
the appreciation of his work today is
universally a fad and a whim, true
art lovers will always hold him in
the greatest of admiration after this
popular and unlearned adoration
passes as all fads must pass away.
ITALY HAS lost half of its gold
reserve since the Ethiopian war's
outbreak. Mussolini is trading his
nation's economic security for a hor
rible desert that'll cost him a for
tune to hold now that he's got it.
And guess what Italian soldiers
found in the cave which Emperor
Ilaile Selassie used for his head
quarters during the four-day battle !
of Lake Ashangi! Eau de cologne,
cosmetics, choice wines, and a bux
om sewing machine. The Lion of '
Judah like Caesar went forth to
battle well perfumed and well
oiled, and the cave was even air
conditioned.
MUSSOLINI didn't have to beard
the Lion in his own den, for the Lion j
of Judah has shaved himself and i
headed for points south. This
Ethiopian war will soon be over. !
Mussolini's troops are practically in
Addis Ababa, and it's hard to believe
that they'll go any farther than the
capital.
