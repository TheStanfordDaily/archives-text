# Stanford Students Just Kids At Circus
## 300 Roughs Ask for Jobs To Get Passes 
### Alberta Garden 
The circus is in town!
And how well the Stanford
roughs knew it. Over three hundred
"college kids" applied for jobs to
day at the circus, for tickets for
themselves—and the girl friend. All
were willing to turn juvenile for the
; day, if they got tickets to see the
i Big Ring in action.
Students Thrilled
The students who could afford it
were there—with bells on. They en
joyed it just as much as the little
kids who whooped and hollered
i throughout the performance. The
lions 'n tigers 'n elephants hold
thrills for everyone it seems. Even
I the clowns don't mind acting for col
i lege students. They said so.
I went back behind those canvas
walls and talked to them—and the
! trapeze artists, and the horseback
riders, and the "barker" and the
matron who has charge of all the
single girls in the show. They were
swell. I asked them if they liked
I college towns and the audiences
they produced, and they said, "Sure,
college kids are just as easy to
; please as anyone else."
Collcgiates Observing
• However, the managers and offi
cials realize that college audiences
are much more observing and par
ticular than the younger element.
They notice the workings behind the
j scenes, the moving of sets, etc. The
j "barker" told me this. He said they
I were in that way harder to please.
There were surprisingly few
! around after dinner, so I asked
| where they all were.
It seems they all went to "the
I show"—for a change!
