# False Alarms Keep Fire Brigade Busy
## 
### 
An S O S to the Beta house
brought the Stanford fire brigade out
at 9 o'clock Tuesday night. The
trucks rushed up the Row only to
find all in order.
Yesterday afternoon the squad
went to the aid of a motorist on
Salvatierra whose brakes were
burning, making a record of three
fire calls in two days, counting the
one to a burning shack on the Webb
farm Tuesday afternoon.
Insects frozen in Arctic ice for
centuries have been made to live
again by Soviet scientists.
