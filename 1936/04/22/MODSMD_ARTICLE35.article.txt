# Card Track Hopes Bright For Saturday
## Madlem Out for Practice After Football Season; Dellinger May Not Run 
### Phil Klauber 
Stanford's hopes for a win in the j
Big Meet hero Saturday rose just
about four points yesterday when
young Leo Madlem came out for his
first workout of the season. Not
that Leo's personality would do it,
but one of his 23-fuot broad jumps j
ought to help.
Madlem, who has been playing
football ever since a pulled muscle
ruined his frosh track season last
year, took exactly five leaps yester
day, the fourth at 215-1 and the fifth
at 23-3'/a.
Relay Chances
Other encouraging performances
were Joe Burris's 49.5 quarter, with I
Bill McCurdy two yards behind. Just j
what the relay team will look like j
Saturday won't be known till post !
time; Weiershauser, Cranston, Mal
ott, Burris, McCurdy, Dellinger, and
Nimmo can all better 50 seconds
for a quarter, but Dellinger is feel
ing a recurrence of his old leg hurt
that may keep him out of suit Sat- !
urday.
Giir Myers, a newcomer to the
cinder path, is cutting his quarter
mile times as regularly as clock
work, and may surprise a lot of J
people in the meet.
Ed Burrows ran 7:05 six laps to '
look the best he has since his peak |
two months ago when he touched I
9:40. One of the greatest Angell j
Field mysteries these days is just
exactly how fast a two-mile Ed j
can run.
Nimmo To Star
Some people think he could take
this year's distance supremacy
away from Chuck Nimmo, who hit
9:37 a month ago. Nimmo, inci- !
dentally, is in for a full day Satur- \
day, as is always the case with Nim- j
mo when points are needed. Chuck (
will be in the mile, of course, but I
in addition maybe the half, maybe -
Ihe two, maybe the relay, perhaps '
all four.
Pete Kump, reserve broadjumper, '
incurred a badly sprained ankle j
when he lit in a hole in the sand j
pit that will finish his season.
