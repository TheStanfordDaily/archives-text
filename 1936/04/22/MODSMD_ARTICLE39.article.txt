## THEY NEVER PICK THEIR OWN TEAM 
### 
It's amazing the way these athletes
and coaches are everlastingly pessi
mistic about the chances of then
teams in the big struggles. Especially
when they are quoting for publica
tion are they wreathed with the dark
cloucls of skepticism.
Stub Allison, the Cal football
coach, is perhaps the best example
of this phenomenon. Cal played nine
games last year and before each one
Stub moaned how his team was
going to lose. Even when his Golden
Bears faced the College of the Pa
cific did he predict defeat.
They are running true to form in
pre-big meet dope sheets as well.
Dink Templeton picks his Cards to
lose, Brutus Hamilton expresses
grave doubts as to the chances of
his team, and now comes a letter
from the sports editor of the Daily
Californian showing step by step
how the Indians are going to make
the Bears bite the dust.
It may all be just "newspaper
talk," but it's awfully funny busi
ness all around.
