## Law, Dey, Pommer Star In Singles; Cards Lose Two Doubles Matches 
### Tim Sullivan 
Under the withering fire of sharp |
shooting Stanford racketeers, the
California tennis team succumbed
seven matches to two here yester
day. Victory insured the Indians of
second place in the final conference
standings, and atoned for a former j
defeat suffered at the hands of the I
Bears. j
Strange to say, all faces were not ,
aglow on the courts immediately '
after the triumph—the boys were a
bit peeved that they had let a pos
sible clean sweep slip through their
fingers.
From beginning to conclusion the
singles play was all Stanford.
Johnny Law won going away from
Dick Bennett 6-3, G-2. Ben Dey was
far from being extended in giving j
Paul Newton the skids 0-2, 0-4.
Similarly, Bob Pommer solved Tate
Coulthard's style of play and j
smothered him under a 6-3, 6-4
score.
Though something out of the ordi
nary would have been welcome, the
Indians continued to reap a plente
ous harvest. Bill Seward set George \
Tanaka back in straight sets 7-5, 7-5. I
Then the smoothness of the tri
umphant tide was somewhat ruffled,
but Bob Braly managed to pull a i
warm one out of the fire from Cal's !
Meyer. Score was 8-6, 5-7, 6-3. Bob
Underwood completed the coat of
red paint when he brushed off Altos
6-1, 6-3.

Newton and Bennett (C) ran Dey

second place in the final conference

singles play was all Stanford.
Johnny Law won going away from
Dick Bennett 6-3, G-2. Ben Dey was

smothered him under a 6-3, 6-4
score.
Though something out of the ordi
