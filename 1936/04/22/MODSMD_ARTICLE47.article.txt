## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Emotional Appeal Is Quicker, But More Fickle; Stanford Tries a Slower Road 
### 
As predicted, Mr. Norman Thomas ade
quately put over a "stimulating" speech at
yesterday's Stanford peace conference meet
ing in the Assembly Hall.
And, as expected in many quarters, the key
note of Mr. Thomas' talk was to the elTeet that
no permanent peace would ever be possible
under a capitalistic, proiit system.
"A property system, which divides people
and nations into haves and have-nots, is
congenial to war," the noted Socialist force
fully charged.
However, Mr. Thomas, admitting the fu
tility of an immediate change from capitalism
to socialism, concerned much of his talk with
flic more practical topic of "what to do about
peace NOW."
And the number one Socialist and idealist
clearly placed himself as firmly in favor (as
a temporary measure) of such sound pacifist
policies as a drastic reduction of arms, main
tenance of an absolute neutrality, and a re
ligious embargo on arms and other contra
band so that no private individuals or cor
porations will profit directly by war.
This problem of "how to insure peace"
typified the whole tone of Stanford's intelli
gent, worth-while, and exceedingly practical
"peace demonstration."
While college and high school students
throughout the country were making plans for

today's one-hour peace strike, which neces
sarily is placed on an emotional, rather than
an academic or intellectual basis, the Farm
yesterday did as sane and constructive a thing
to insure peace as any college can hope to do.
Nine round-table conferences and two spe
cial speeches one by Mr. Thomas, the other
bv Professor (luido Marx practically cov
ered the lield; they attempted to gel at the
causes of war, they identified the tinder spots
that may lead to immediate future wars, they
objectively weighed the forces that might best
be employed to discourage war, and tlicy at
tempted to find how to combat the opposing
forces that are encouraging future wars.
No great conclusions were reached; but
many Stanford students and professors started
thinking, along lines that may not have oc
curred to them earlier. That is all a Uni
versity can hope to oiler; from that may come
something that actually will cure war.
Meanwhile, students of Stanford's sister
universities plan nation-wide "peace strikes"
—an appeal to the emotional.
An emotional appeal that is used to "insure"
peace, can quickly be reversed to insure war
—emotions are "easy meat" for any govern
ment's War Propaganda Service.
An intellectual appeal, such as that em
ployed by Stanford's peace conference, is not
so fickle.
