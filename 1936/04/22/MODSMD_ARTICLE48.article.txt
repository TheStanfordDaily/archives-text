# Give 'Em the Axe — It'll Be in Safe Hands
## 
### 
For the tirst time since HMO. the Stanford
Axe will leave the home grounds and appear
at an Axe rally in Berkeley.
After a few stormy protests, Fx Committee
granted its permission to lend the Big Game
trophy to the t'niversity of California in last
night's session, on the double grounds that it
would stimulate an oil-season interest in the
Axe, and that it would create good will.
For these • reasons, and others, the move
seems to be a wise one. Since the Axe is being
loaned upon California's own request, there
will be no reason to fear for its safe return.
Moreover, the temporary loan will be like
dangling a piece of meat just out of reach of
the wolf (or Bear, in this case), which ob
viously will stimulate the Stanford-California
rivalry during a season when this rivalry is
not as strong as it might be.
But the real point is that, since Cal made
the request and thus obligated herself, Stan
ford might as well comply and look to the
time when she might have some small favor
to ask from her friendlv eneinv across the Bay.
