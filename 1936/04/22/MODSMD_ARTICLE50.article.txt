## Campus Politics 
### 
(From the U.S.C. Daily Trojan)
Most noteworthy contribution of the year in the
field of .service to universities is the recent nation
wide survey of campus politics conducted by national
officers of Mortar Board, senior women's honorary.
With the co-operation of active chapters, the na
tional officers of social fraternities and sororities, the
national Panhellenic congress, and the deans of women
in each of the (50 colleges where chapters of Mortar
Board exist, a revealing and discouraging survey of
politics was conducted by Mortar Board's national
president.
With members of Mortar Board, senior campus
leaders well acquainted with the politics of their
respective campuses, it may be conceded that the con
fidential material they sent their national office was
authentic.
Most of the colleges reported the existence of three
definite party groups, membership in which remained
the same year after year, although less influential
groups frequently floated, if it gave them an advantage.
Less than half of the groups felt that all the officers
merited their election.
College administrations in a number of schools
have interfered in elections, some of them going as
far as to call new elections. One questionnaire stated,
"When a girl was marred by acid-throwing, the ad
ministration decided to interfere in campaigning," on
the theory that it was better late than never, perhaps!
Reforms effected during the past few years include
supervision of caucuses and voting by members of the
faculty or honor groups. Elimination of graft in con
nection with election funds and student body funds
through the handling of all money by the college
business office.
Abolition of political organizations by administra
tion may eliminate unfair election practices, but what
assurance can the administration have that these or
ganizations can be abolished in a more than nominal
manner?
Curbing of expensive campaigning, advertising, etc.,
would seem to be another solution to the problem.
Adoption of the merit system and abolition of empty
honors and useless offices, particularly class offices,
seem to bf> the two most valuable suggestions evolved
from this study of campus politics.
Conduction of an absolutely fair, constructive elec
tion, without mud-slinging, with fair balloting and,
most important, fair counting of ballots, would not only
prove a novelty it would prove that college students
are the intelligent, thinking leaders of the next gen
eration.
If four years in university is preparation for life,
there is no conceivable reason \yhy its students should
ape the despicable practices of cheap politicians, whose
work they will so decry, whose elimination from gov
ernment they will demand, in future years when it
becomes their turn to be taxpayers.
