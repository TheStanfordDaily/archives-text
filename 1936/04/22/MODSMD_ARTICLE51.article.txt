When the moneychangers in the Shirley Temple
contest figured out a new publicity stunt, they rea
soned:
That if beauty's epidcrmical
Then great beauty's pachydermical.

out of it. I think they ought to give them a consolation
prize of a week at the Convalescent Home, all ex
penses ($2.21 per day) paid.
