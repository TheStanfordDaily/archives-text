The Editor, Sir:
The Daily's suggestion that the
learned and talented men who make
up our faculty issue a "Stanford
Review" is very good. Such a pub
lication would enhance the Univer
sity's reputation and fill a real cul
tural need. *
If Our faculty authorities could
write for a "Sociological Journal,"
could they not leave aside their class
room cares and formality and inter
pret important news of the day to
Stanford students by way of the
Daily? If they would do so, many
students whose time is filled with
requirements would get the bene
fits of their insight and experience.
The profs are too tied down by
classroom routine. Lei's give them a
chance to express themselves in
formally in the Daily on topics which
they know most about.
