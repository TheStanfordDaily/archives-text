# THE 						DAILY STANDS NOT ALONE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily's current campaign to
open the library Sunday nights is a
commendable one and should be
pushed to the limit.
Perhaps library authorities be
lieve, however, that it is the Daily
alone who feels that the move would
be a wise one, and are withholding
action because they believe student
opinion is not behind the move.
It is my opinion, then, that all
students who are vitally interested
in the question should not hesitate
to write in and let their feelings be
known to library authorities. Should
this not prove practical, how about
a Daily straw-poll on the question?
