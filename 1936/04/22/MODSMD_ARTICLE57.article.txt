# Bull Session
## OUR BLUSHING YELLOW-PERIL 
### 
Is Mr. Hearst's face red! Here he's
been screaming like the eagle on
his masthead about Communism at
his favorite university, and it turns
round and gets reactionary on him.
Time was when it paid Mr. Hearst
to subsidize the University of Cali
r •TT O -1..

forma. U.C. stu
dents were cer
tain to make a
fine policy story
at least once a J
week by rioting, I
striking, or S,a- '
ther-gateing.
But them days
are gone with
Landon's chances
For yesterday!
Cal's administra-T
tion refused to al-

low just an ordi
nary Socialist to speak his peace be
cause he wasn't sponsored by the
right people.
And the irony of it all. Here's
Stanford, the Hearstian untouchable,
from whose corporate pants William
Randolph would gladly bite the seat,
making the best kind of news by not
only allowing Thomas to speak but
officially sanctioning his address.
It just ain't fair to the journalistic
yellow-peril, having a red-menace
blush violently in a place he prom
ised not to mention.
* * *
The whole business is a bit con
fusing in spots other than the Ex
| aminer and Call-Bulletin city
rooms, however. It'must be consid
! erable of a puzzle to many Cal-men,
to say nothing of many Stanfordites.
For the Farm's intellectual hay
! seeds who believe that Stanford's
free wind-machine is in the corpora
tion yard, the rip-snorting peace
rally removed another landmark in
i their social panorama. It blasted the
theory that Stanford is a pickling tub
j for reactionaries.
To Cal's red-hots and luke
; warms the disillusionment is a
double one. For not only did stuffy
Stanford put one over on them, but
U.C. couldn't even work up a cam-
I pus-size blister. And that, my

| friends, Ls a real tragedy or you don't
know Cal.
But more than smashing false
streotypes, the appearance of Mr. !
Thomas, the words of Dr. Marx and
the round-table discussions here j
yesterday proved that Stanford can
not only talk about the untalkable,
, but do it like a gentleman—on-cam
pus and under the university eye.
Unquestionably there were plenty 1
i of roughs and maids too worried j
about Kings and .Queens to debate
having their heads shot off in the !
next war. But their unconcern hard
ly alters the total effect of Peace \
Day, when Stanford at least officially ]
considered the future's Marching j
Johnnies.

If the whole business did nothing
else, it did re-establish the Farm as
; the same pierce that long ago gained
a world-wide reputation for think
ing without benefit of brickbat.
