# Trite Plot Of Opera Picture Saved By Stars
## 
### 
Once again the local boy makes
good on the opera stage, but "CilVli
US THIS NKillT" is charming,

melodious and gay
despite its trite plot.
Its picturesque set
ting, an Italian sea
coast village, and its
two talented stars
are chiefly respon-

sible for this.
Jan Kiepura is the exuberant, un
sophisticated fisherman whodb spon
taneous love of life and song get him
into all sorts of scrapes and finally
lead him to success. Gladys Swarth
out is the prima donna who gives
him his chance, after hearing him
sing first in church, then in jail,
The producers are to be praised
for combining two such glorious
voices in this picture, and for let
ting the stars use these voices more
often than in most operatic pictures.
