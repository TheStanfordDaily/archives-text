EVOLUTION OF A SIIRAII SACK... \
( CUBAN RUM AND \
PHELPS-TERKE I'S
BURR-A-lAPA
Style scouts scooped BURR-A-LAPA
and left the Cubans holding the sack.
Down there they were rum, rhumba
ing and revolting in a sugar sack shirt.
You can use your BURR-A-LAPA for
lounging . . golf.. . tennis... sailing ...
fishing or what you will. Wear it out
side your trow (like the Cubans) or
or tuck it in and wear a tie. Either way
you'll say its the smartest, most com
fortable sport shirt ever designed.
