### 
By a two-point margin Ervin An
derson won the Joffre debate last

California win in the last 16 years
of the traditional contest when he
outpointed second-place winner Bill
Kuzell of Stanford, 12-14. Lowest
score determines first place.
Anderson, with Hunt Kingsbury
and Ed Lindblom of Stanford, ar
gued the negative of the question:
"Resolved, that France has attained
security apart from the collective
security of all European nations."
Morris Herzig of California, total
ing 15 points, debated a close third,
Herzig upheld the question with
Kuzell and Stanley Johnson of U.C.
Anderson claimed that a League
of Nations was not only the possible
but the probable answer to "a bal
ance of power." He said that some
sort of Utopian judiciary system
between nations was an absolute ne
cessity.
Dr. Raoul Blanquie, French vice
counsel and president of the French
Alliance, presented Anderson with
the winner's silver medallion. The
French government, through the
Alliance, annually sponsors the de
bate.
