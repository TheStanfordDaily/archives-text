# Surprise! Professors Prove Adept At Sports
## 
### Margaret Loud 
You may think the professor who
painfully drones out an 8 o'clock
lecture doesn't know what a ping
pong ball is. Well, he does. More
than that, he plays bridge, golf, and
the saxophone—even shoots at pool
balls all hours of the night.
The Faculty Club, squat brown
building down in the eucalyptus
grove past the 8.A.C., is the center of
much faculty recreation. There are
pool and ping-pong tables down
there, and a tennis court outside.
Pool Popular
Professors Yamato Ichihashi and
David Harris forget their histories
for cues and eight-balls at the club.
Ichihashi is a great fisherman and
Harris is a saxophone player, too.
Dr. Graham Stuart may know
most, of the details of political sci
ence and international relations but
he also rivals Culbertson as a eon
tract-hridge player. Some years ago
in Paris he actually beat the great
God Ely. But Stuart admit* that
Culbertson's improved a lot since
then.
Trick Pulled
Albert C. Whitaker goes in for
chess. And Paid Kirkpatrick of the
physics department, fools his col
leagues with all sorts of clever
tricks and games.

If you know him at all, you won't
be surprised to learn that Edward
Hulme is a connoisseur of restau
rants—of good things to eat and
drink. So is Percy Martin. Maxwell
Savelle and Tom LaFargue, frosh
history instructors, run around
taking people's pictures.
Athletes Found
Athletics seem to center around
certain departments. Poly Sci is
noted for its golfers—Edwin Cot
trell, Hugh Clokie, and especially
Thomas Barclay. Theodore Boggs
leads tennis enthusiasts in the econ
department. The chemistry faculty
is adept at light, sports like ping
pong.
Such professors as Edgar E. Rob
inson and Payson Treat invite stu
dents to weekly open houses and
teas. Charles Barker holds an un
dergraduate round-table regularly
at the Union, like the one famous
Samuel Johnson had in an English
coffee-house. There's a similar table
for the faculty in the Cellar.
Married couples of the faculty be
long to a dancing club. The Harry
Rath buns are outstanding members.
So for all their gravity Stanford
faculty members don't go in for
formal activities outside the class
rooms.

Athletics seem to center around
certain departments. Poly Sci is
noted for its golfers—Edwin Cot
trell, Hugh Clokie, and especially
Thomas Barclay. Theodore Boggs
leads tennis enthusiasts in the econ
department. The chemistry faculty
is adept at light, sports like ping
pong.
Such professors as Edgar E. Rob
inson and Payson Treat invite stu
dents to weekly open houses and
teas. Charles Barker holds an un
dergraduate round-table regularly
at the Union, like the one famous
Samuel Johnson had in an English
coffee-house. There's a similar table
for the faculty in the Cellar.
Married couples of the faculty be
long to a dancing club. The Harry
Rath buns are outstanding members.
So for all their gravity Stanford
faculty members don't go in for
formal activities outside the class
rooms.
You may think the professor who
painfully drones out an 8 o'clock
lecture doesn't know what a ping
pong ball is. Well, he does. More
than that, he plays bridge, golf, and
the saxophone—even shoots at pool
balls all hours of the night.
The Faculty Club, squat brown
building down in the eucalyptus
grove past the 8.A.C., is the center of
much faculty recreation. There are
pool and ping-pong tables down
there, and a tennis court outside.
Pool Popular
Professors Yamato Ichihashi and
David Harris forget their histories
for cues and eight-balls at the club.
Ichihashi is a great fisherman and
Harris is a saxophone player, too.
Dr. Graham Stuart may know
most, of the details of political sci
ence and international relations but
he also rivals Culbertson as a eon
tract-hridge player. Some years ago
in Paris he actually beat the great
God Ely. But Stuart admit* that
Culbertson's improved a lot since
then.
Trick Pulled
Albert C. Whitaker goes in for
chess. And Paid Kirkpatrick of the
physics department, fools his col
leagues with all sorts of clever
tricks and games.

If you know him at all, you won't
be surprised to learn that Edward
Hulme is a connoisseur of restau
rants—of good things to eat and
drink. So is Percy Martin. Maxwell
Savelle and Tom LaFargue, frosh
history instructors, run around
taking people's pictures.
