(AP). —At 12:45 a.m. today Dr.
I). Ed win Robertson and Charles
A. Scudding, trapped for 10 days
in (lie old Moose River gold mine,
were brought #» the surface by
rescuers. Robertson surprised

MOOSE RIVER, N.S., AprU 22 (/P).
—Hardy Nova Scotia miners bur
rowed their way today to a point
where they could see the two men
buried alive for ten days in the
Moose River gold mine, but tonight j
actual contact was prevented by
crib-work which blocked the tun
nel.
As darkness fell, the rescue crew
was cross-cutting in an attempt to
get around the mass of steel and
wood, and officials in charge would j
not estimate how long the job would j
take. Engineers expressed the be
lief that if the diggers attempted to i
remove the crib-work, another cave
in would be caused.
Dr. D. Edwin Robertson, 62, one
of the men who had survived the !
agonizing ordeal deep in the earth, !
asked the tunnelers to bring a hy
podermic, and this gave rise to the
belief that Alfred Scadding, 44, his
companion, was in a serious condi- j
tion. Erman Magill, 32, the third j
man trapped by the April 12 cave-in, ;
died in the underground chamber
Monday.
Reports that the draegermen (the
name given to the skilled rescue

dally denied.
