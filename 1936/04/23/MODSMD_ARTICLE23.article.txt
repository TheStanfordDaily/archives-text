A serious insurrection among the
northern Ethiopian armies was re
ported unofficially in Addis Ababa
today as the youthful Crown Prince
Asfa Wosan returned to the old pal
ace to resume his place as his
father's deputy in the capital.
Refugees from the North brought
varied reports of disaffection, but it
was uncertain whether this is han
dicapping Emperor Haile Selassie,
who is organizing a last stand in de
fense of Addis Ababa in the tower
ing Shoan mountains south of
Dessyc.
Some Northern Galla and Tigrean
tribes in the territory which the
Emperor was forced to evacuate are
believed involved.
Rome reports snid Italy's north
ern army, driving on Addis Ababa,
was only 70 miles from the capital.
The Crown Prince returned after
four months in Dessye, where he
had a taste of fighting. He resumed
control of the government here on
orders from his father. All other
members of the imperial family, ex
cept the Emperor, are still here and
have made daily appearances in the
streets in their American limousine
to reassure the -population.
