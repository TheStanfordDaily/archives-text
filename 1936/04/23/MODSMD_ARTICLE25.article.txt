Parker garnering over $900 of this.

* Unsurpassed excitement attended
the last hour of voting, with a crowd
of about 300 milling around the polls.
Closed voting started at 4 o'clock
for kings, with several $100 bilLs
. plunked down on Vierling, who
maintained the lead all day.
A cheer, started by the Fijis and
taken up by the rest of the crowd,
greeted Vierling as Contest Chair
man Jim Ludlam led him onto the
platform and declared him winner.
I Vierling attempted to say a few
| words, but only vague mumblings
about starting to tear the house
down today could be heard.

were placed on queen candidates
during the closed voting, and the
winner was not decided until the
