# Caucus Plan Scored By Ex Committee
## Campus Political System Under Fire; Hall – Row Split Solution Sought 
### 
"Fly-by-night — haphazard —
harum-scarum" — these and other
equally derogatory adjectives were
applied to Stanford's nominating
system in Tuesday's Ex Committee
meeting.
All are appropriate. And Ex
Committee's action in recognizing
a defect, and attempting if possible
to do something about it, is ex
tremely laudable.
Charges Hurled
Major charges were hurled at the
caucus system. "The man backing
a candidate phones picked delegates
arid announces a caucus," accused
President Wally Brooke. "The
loudest talkers win," was said of
halls. Naming a nominating com
mittee is definitely not the solution,
decided the group. Reason: graft.
Problems finally narrowed down
to whether or not the present Hall-
Row split was inevitable, and if so
what to do about it.
Committee Named
A committee named to investigate
this and the alleged "sophomore
ring" which is reputed to have
formed an efficiently functioning
machine will report next week. Re
sults should be interesting. Whether
or not anything constructive is ever
done about it should also be inter
esting.
"This is the first body of politicians
ever to investigate politics," said
Dick Creamer truthfully.
The temporary appointment by
law, having been patched up, is now
at least dubiously constitutional.
Even after changing the wording to
provide that the officer must still be
registered in school, Ex Committee
was not sure if Dean Marion Kirk
wood knew that the by-law was a
by-law before he okayed it.
The by-law is not needed now.
If any question existed, why not
postpone a vote for a week?
