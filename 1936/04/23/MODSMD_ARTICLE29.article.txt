# TRAPPED 'GATOR FREED
## 
### 
FORT MYERS, Fla., April 22 (/P).
- A five-foot alligator with a flair
for exploration was free today from
a sewer prisonâ€”thanks to G. G.
Cook. The reptile entered the sewer
a week ago, found it was getting no
where and couldn't turn around.

The camel, native of Arabia and
Africa, is believed to have come
originally from North America.
