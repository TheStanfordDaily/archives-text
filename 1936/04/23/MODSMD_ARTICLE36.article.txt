# V.F.W. CAUGHT NAPPING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Chronicle told the world this
story of Stanford's Peace Day:
"A counter demonstration by the
I V.F.W. almost broke up a mass •
J peace meeting here today. While :
i Norman Thomas and student leaders j
! spoke in behalf of peace, the 'future j
j veterans' chanted: 'Down with peace! j
| We want our bonus!' "
This story was not a "mistake," j
[ for the Chronicle too obviously \
' avoids the truth. But closer to home
is the fact that the V.F.W. has been
caught napping.
The motive behind the V.F.W. is j
that it should be a magnificent and j
dramatic ridicule of the pernicious I
"war spirit." But—when that satire
can be "bought out" by the enemy,
it becomes tragedy—for it destroys
I its own ends.
The V.F.W. should either make its
position so dramatic and so scathing
j that the opposition would fear to j
j touch it—or it should give up the I
| idea as dangerous to the interests it
j seeks to further.
