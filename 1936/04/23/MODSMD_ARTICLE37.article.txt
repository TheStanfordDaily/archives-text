# Thomas Speaks At Cal Anti-War Meet
## 
### 
Norman Thomas, speaking at the
University of California without
student body or university sanction,
addressed nearly 3000 students out
side the campus yesterday.
Addressing an anti-war meeting,
Thomas contradicted himself by
reprimanding the students, saying
they were not serving the cause of
peace by gathering peacefully. He
said, "There must be color and
drama and life in peace action."
President Sproul was not present,
but Vice-president Monroe Deutsch
urged the students not to interfere
during the meeting.
Cutting ice for home use, farm
ers along the Smoky River, near
Lindsborg, got a liberal supply of
frozen fish.
