U:<> MADLEM'S
NO NOVICE

Considerable of a surprise to the
lay public is this new broad jumper
Leo Madlem who did 23-3'/a his first
day out, and who promises to be the
best Stanford chance at salvaging
some long leap points from the doz
ens of greats across the bay that
Brick Morse writes about.
But just think back a bit. Leo
(where he got the name "Cooky"
no one seems to know, but it doesn't
sound unlike Liebendorfer coinage)
came to Stanford with his fame as a
broad jumper already known.
He was a member of that El Cen
tro High track quartet of Roy Kirk
patrick, Myrel Gillett, and Elbert
Berry that used to get 30 points out
of any meet you put them into, and
took the state championship in 1933.
Madlem jumped 23-G before he left
high school.
He didn't make a frosh track
numeral last year, as numerals are
given for points earned in the Little
Big Meet, and Madlem pulled a
muscle in the 100, first of his events.
In the meantime he had played foot
ball for Bradshaw, and had put on
some weight.
Then Tiny Thornhill took him in
tow with some talk about what a
fine left half he would make, all 160
pounds of him, and everyone knows
it is better to be a good left half
than a good broad jumper. So Leo
hadn't touched a spiked shoe for
nearly a year till last Tuesday.
It suddenly occurred to someone
that he might be of some Use next
Saturday, with points at high
premium, and stealthily behind
Thornhill's back Madlem (he didn't
know Templeton very well) got his
suit from Bill Ellington, and to
gether they went out with the tape
measure.
A couple of run-throughs and his
step was right; the third jump was
23-1 and the fourth 23-3Va, without
even a wry face. Ht? is under orders
to do no more work this week.

PACIFIC COAST
INTERCOLLEGIATES?

Dink Templeton and a number of
other friends of the track and field
have long been advocating a Pacific
Coast Conference Meet, to include
all members of the league instead of
just this four-school affair we have
been having.
This year the thing was just about
a reality, being scheduled by the
graduate managers of the confer
ence for May 29 and 30 in the Olym
pic Stadium, when difficulties be
gan to accrue. In the first place, no
one had thought of finding whether
they could get the stadium that day,
nd by cracky it turned out they
couldn't—someone else had already
hired it.
Next they forgot that the 1.C.4-A.,
grandpa of all the big national meets,
has by custom always taken the last
week-end in May, and had also
scheduled for May 29 and 30.
So that leaves us where? The
Pacific Coast Intercollegiates, which
everyone admits could be built into
a swell affair, has been resched
uled for Edwards Field in Berkeley
May 29 and 30, but whether anyone
will be there that day is not known.
Dean Cromwell of U.S.C. has
nothing to gain by taking his men
there instead of to the 1.C.4-A., and
from the drift of talk on the south
ern campus when Stanford went
south last week, probably will
choose the big meet in Cambridge;
Hec Edmundsen of Washington
didn't know if he would attend in
Berkeley in May, as he hadn't been
formally notified; and Harry Trot
ter of U.C.L.A., when he was up
here, was as much in the fog about
the whole affair as anyone.
No one could blame Cromwell
very much for upping stakes on this
party. And if and when he does, a
lot of athletes from other schools are
going to want to go East too. What
then of the Pacific Coast Conference
Intercollegiates? —Klauber
