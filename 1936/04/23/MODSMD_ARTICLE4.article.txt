### Phil Klauber 
Assuming the truth of all the re
ports that waft their way here from
across the bay, one of the unluck
iest guys in the world is Coach
Brutus Hamilton of the University
of California track team.
Yesterday it was announced that
Hamilton's latest loss is Dick Brace,
stellar half-miler, and a sure point
winner in the Big Meet here Satur
day, who has taken the count with a
case of measles.

First it was Bob Fowler, two
miler, then the great George Ander
son, sprinter, then Bob Heavey,
miler, all good
competitors, and
all out with in
juries, although
Heavey may be
over the measles
sufficiently to en
ter Saturday.
Once they said a
California vi c -
tory was in the
bag; now it looks
a great deal like a
track meet.
Coach Dink
Templeton has
begun to taper ofT his work, and with
everyone arguing odds on the King-
Queen contest, it took a scared jack
rabbit that capered across the in
field to get the best performances
yet this season out of some of the

boys.
Voigt Recovering
Truck Dellinger's leg is still in
poor shape, and he looks to be a
possible spectator Saturday, v/hile
Chuck Voigt is recovering slowly
from a muscle pull incurred last
week. Otherwise the team is in good
shape.

After all is said and done then, 1
it doesn t look so bad. Cal's losses
will not be a sudden count, as An
derson and Fowler have been shaky
entries for months past, and Dan
Carter, Bear second half-miler, is
capable of 1:58.
Anything Goes
The dope sheets present all kinds
of variation, to limits of 30-point
victories either way. But they all
look very conservative, and every
one seems to forget that this is the
Big Meet, with California, where
anything goes.
A lot of guys have been saving
up for big performancesâ€”hardly
any one of the Stanford team has i
performed up to his real possibilities
yet, and this is the biggest meet of
the season. Something is bound to
happen, citizens; come on out and
see it.
