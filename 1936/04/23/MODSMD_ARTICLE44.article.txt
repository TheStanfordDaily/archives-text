# Bre'r Rabbit Flees From Injun Runners
## 
### 
As good an indication as any
that the Cards are ready for Cal is
that some of the runners really
got going yesterday afternoon and
caught a rabbit at his own game.
The hapless hare hippety-hop
ped out on the track late in the
afternoon. Phil Levy, Ed Bur
rows, Bill McCurdy, and Tiger
Alexander spotted the quarry and
gave chase. Br'er Rabbit, fright
ened by the quartet of rogues,
whipped into a clump of hushes
and broke his leg.
With the rabbit beaten, the boys
swear that if they trim the Bears
Saturday they arc going to tackle
the tortoise.
