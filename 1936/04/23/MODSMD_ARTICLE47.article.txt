# Freshmen Shift Track Stars In Hope Of Cal Win
## U.C. Coach Expects Squad To Score Overwhelming Victory over Frosh 
### 
An ingenious shifting of men is
calculated to bring the Stanford
freshmen tracksters within striking
| distance of California's highly touted
I Cubs when they clash with them on
the Berkeley oval tomorrow.
Hurdler Bill Hawkins is slated for
discus and shot putting duties, in
addition to his regular timber top
ping chores. Wally deWitt has been
| recruited from the baseball squad to
i .shove the shot. Leo Feder, nom
inally a half-miler, may be shifted
to the mile in order to save John
Emmanuel, best frosh four-lapper,
for the two-mile.
Another strategic move may find
Harry Soltero. speedy sprinter, be
ing held out of the dashes in order to
conserve his best efforts for the re
layâ€”which event it is a Stanford
tradition to win.
It is interesting to note that Brick
Morse, bald Berkeley cinder seer,
picks Cal to score a sweeping tri
umph against the local papooses.
While definitely entrenched in the
underdog position the farm yearlings
are in a situation where they may
be able to give the baby Bears more
trouble than they anticipate.
