## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Hall-Row Politics Obviously Exist; Let's Concede the Point and Clean Them Up 
### 
In Ex Committee's decision Tuesday night
to investigate campus political conditions is
found a hint that possibly the student legis
lature soon will step entirely out of the path
of ils predecessors and ollicially recognize the
existence of the two unoflicial, yet obviously
existent factions in campus politics.
The moguls of A.S.S.I', now are looking into
the feasibility of regulating A.S.S.U. nomina
tions bv working directly through Hall and
Row caucuses which in elTecl implies a rec
ognition of these two as the Farm's student
political parlies.
This would be one of the present Ex Com
mittee's most praiseworthy moves. These
factions exist; why not face that tact and
make the most of it.
True, there is no logical reason lor dividing
the campus arbitrarily in Ibis lashion, but
there is no logical explanation for many
things in politics —campus or national.
The only rationalization of a Hall-Row split
is lhat whoever runs for ollicc needs support,
and the most practical way to secure that sup
port is to promise your support in return to
the other fellow. This you-support-me-I'll
support-you feeling automatically makes tor
at least two groups, with each group working
together against the other. Since as a rule
there can be no vital issues on a university
campus, there is bound to be some arbitrary
formation of parties.
So the bitter Hall-Row election campaigns

are pointless. But it is generally conceded
that any move to abolish this annual tight
would he futile.
Hence, Ex Committee would he taking the
hesl possible means of combatting a haphaz
ard, inefficient nominating system if it should
directly and openly face the fact, as it ap
parently may do, that the Hall and Row fac
tions exist, and work from there to clean up
the caucus system.
To do this, some means of insuring fair rep
resentation in each of the caucuses is neces
sary. This could he done on the Row by
putting the matter in the hands of Interfra
ternity Council and Pan-Hellenic, with some
Ex Committee supervision. Each house —that
is, the majority of each house, not just the
one or two house politicians—could he given
one vote in an open, publicized caucus. A
similar plan, identical in eU'eet though neces
sarily different in organization, could be
worked out for the halls.
This system, which Ex Committee may
adopt, would do away with most of the rail
roading and maneuvering by the Farm's em
bryo politicians.
Assuming then, that Hall-Row factions do
exist and nothing can be done to discount
them, the most practical way to insure clean
nominations would be by a seini-olTicial nomi
nating body, resembling the national Repub
lican and Democratic conventions. This could
be done by openly recognized and satisfacto
rily regulated caucuses.
