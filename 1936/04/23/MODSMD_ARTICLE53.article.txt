# Tail Wagged the Dog In This Convalescent Drive
## 
### 
Sorority women cutting each other's throats
out in the open by invading fraternity houses
in search of funds for their candidate, a how
dah containing the candidates themselves
bobbing on top of one of A1 H.'s gooher-burners
right out by the Quad, and over 900 bucks
put on the nose of one filly to place in the
Masque Hall King and Queen Contest!
Over $4,000, more than the total take ot
all of last year's Convalescent Home Drive,
whose King and Queen Contest was in turn
more than the whole Drive of the year betore,
was taken in in this week's Armageddon; It
seems to indicate that the long-run trend is
toward an increase in suckers by geometric
progression.
Hizarre and unusual it certainly is. Over
organized and ultra-propagandized it is cer
tainly becoming. As the funds mount higher
year by year, and the pranks get larger and
larger, the contest becomes more and more a
struggle in financial hysteria between certain
organized groups.
Students are finding that the Contest is
over-shadowing the Drive. The tail is not
only wagging the dog, it is shaking it to
death. The Drive has in the past been ol
more value to the campus than it has been to
the Home, because it is a means for students
to gather together in a common enterprise.
Hut the Contest seems to be getting out of
hand. As a comparatively painless way of ex
tracting money from the ostentatious indi
viduals who wish to exploit their bank balance
and the University as fuel for their ego and
for the benefit of the kiddies it is fine. As an

entertaining and amusing part of campus lite,
it is rapidly losing its spontaneity.
