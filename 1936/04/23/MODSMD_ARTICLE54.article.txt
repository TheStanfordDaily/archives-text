Since we've elected the king and queen of the
carnival, everybody can now sit back and think of
what fun it is to be mad at everybody else, and the
king and queen can sit back and think how important
they are, and how drunk the kings and queens used
to get during Prohibition.
It is really quite a good deal of fun to think of how
you are very rich and have lots of money, that you
have done very much for the children of the Convales
cent Home, that you fooled everybody you disliked in
the last few minutes, that the kings and queens used
to get drunk during Prohibition, and that you have
somehow made a very silly ass out of yourself.
There is a story about a little interlude during the
heights of the spring quarter madness. Everybody was
cozing over the steps of the Quad, watching the mark
ers in the pit, exhibiting the follies and fables of the
royal contest. One of Stanford's all-University jani
tors stepped up to one of the slouchers and asked him
what was going on.
The lookers-onners explained carefully, and delib
erately, what was going on.
"Well," said the clean-up man as he swept over
to the booth, "I guess I'll put four bits on Parker."
That the contest got rather heated, and there was
a good deal of scurrying for funds is quite true, though
it is said that in the old days some of the houses used
to make candy and sell their home-made products on
the streets of Paly to raise funds, while several El
Campos during one memorable contest solicited from
house to house in Paly and particularly at one house
of a rather wealthy Stanford benefactress, implying
that the money was going directly to the Home.
The Thetas solicited from house to house this year,
but they were all fraternity houses.
It seems that the Thetas sent their promotion man
agers around to the houses for dinner Tuesday night.
As soon as the Kappas heard about it, they sent out
telephone calls to all their stooges in the various
houses to see if they couldn't stop the graft dough
going to the Thetas, but alas it was too late. The
Pi Phis also tried a counter-attack by sending their
minions around Wednesday noon, but general indica
tions were that the Thetas had picked the boys clean.
At the Beta house Tuesday night there was a defi
nite clash since the Kappas sent their representatives
across the street as soon as they got wind of Den
mark, and the two contingents sat across the room at
each other and ylowerrd quite prettily, while the
Beta* had a ureal deal of fun out of it.

The Thetas solicited from house to house this year,
but they were all fraternity houses.
It seems that the Thetas sent their promotion man
agers around to the houses for dinner Tuesday night.
As soon as the Kappas heard about it, they sent out
telephone calls to all their stooges in the various
houses to see if they couldn't stop the graft dough
going to the Thetas, but alas it was too late. The
Pi Phis also tried a counter-attack by sending their
minions around Wednesday noon, but general indica
tions were that the Thetas had picked the boys clean.
At the Beta house Tuesday night there was a defi
nite clash since the Kappas sent their representatives
across the street as soon as they got wind of Den
mark, and the two contingents sat across the room at
each other and ylowerrd quite prettily, while the
Beta* had a ureal deal of fun out of it.
Since we've elected the king and queen of the
carnival, everybody can now sit back and think of
what fun it is to be mad at everybody else, and the
king and queen can sit back and think how important
they are, and how drunk the kings and queens used
to get during Prohibition.
It is really quite a good deal of fun to think of how
you are very rich and have lots of money, that you
have done very much for the children of the Convales
cent Home, that you fooled everybody you disliked in
the last few minutes, that the kings and queens used
to get drunk during Prohibition, and that you have
somehow made a very silly ass out of yourself.
There is a story about a little interlude during the
heights of the spring quarter madness. Everybody was
cozing over the steps of the Quad, watching the mark
ers in the pit, exhibiting the follies and fables of the
royal contest. One of Stanford's all-University jani
tors stepped up to one of the slouchers and asked him
what was going on.
The lookers-onners explained carefully, and delib
erately, what was going on.
"Well," said the clean-up man as he swept over
to the booth, "I guess I'll put four bits on Parker."
That the contest got rather heated, and there was
a good deal of scurrying for funds is quite true, though
it is said that in the old days some of the houses used
to make candy and sell their home-made products on
the streets of Paly to raise funds, while several El
Campos during one memorable contest solicited from
house to house in Paly and particularly at one house
of a rather wealthy Stanford benefactress, implying
that the money was going directly to the Home.
