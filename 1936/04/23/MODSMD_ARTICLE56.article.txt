## Voting to Go to War 
### 
(From the Daily Texan)
One of the most interesting proposals for avoiding
i war brought forward in many years was that presented
by Colonel Arthur Little, a World War veteran who
enlisted as a private and came out as a major with
| eight decorations for conspicuous valor and service.
His plan reads:
"Before this country engages in any war, except,
j to repel invasion, let the question of our entering upon
1 such an engagement be the subject of a nation-wide
I referendum. Let the vote be by signed ballot (no
, secret ballot). Have each affirmative vote so worded
| as to constitute a pledge of enlistment, or, if by exam
ination the affirmative voter should prove to be un
available for military service, then to constitute a
pledge of half his or her fortune (in kind) for the
uses of the war for which he or she votes."
# * * *
Colonel Little's plan would obviously lessen but not
■ abolish the possibility of our going to war. It might
stem, but not stop. Taking for granted that the nation
wide referendum would be held as soon as pro-war
or anti-war spirit was running high instead of when
they were rumors about wars, or after public
sentiment had already been molded by the propagan
dists, then the outcome of the vote might serve its
purpose.
It is a good idea. An individual would count to
10 several times before he signed himself into an en
listment, or voted away half his fortune. The big job,
| though, is to avoid any need for such a vote.
Such a proposal by a man who has been exposed
; to the horrors of war is doubly potent. Perhaps when
civilization keeps pace with evolution such a plan will
be in effect: or better yet, there will be no need for
any kind of plan to purge humanity of that dreaded
1 scourge.
