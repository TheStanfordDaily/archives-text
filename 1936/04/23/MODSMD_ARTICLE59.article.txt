## IT SMELLED SO '38 INTRODUCED DEODORANTS 
### 
Comes springtime on the Farm
and the great yearly round-up of
politicos for shipment to the polls
gets under way. But it's not a
round-up native westerners should
be proud of.

For the round-uppers on both the
Hall and Row ranges like the "Wah-
I hoo for the gimme-my-boots-and
| saddle" part of
ro.und-upping so
1 well that they
won't leave their
diddling until
I about a day be
j fore the train to
; the poll leaves.
Then it's frenzy
i in a frat house,
; and hell - bent -
over - backwards
I for election in the
I halls until in
j some screw-loose
manner the caucuses catapult a few
j hats in the ring.

Last year a small group of thirty
[ eighters with .sensitive nostrils lean
i ed out of Encina windows along
i about election time and detected a
I distinctly pungent scent in the
atmosphere. At that time the pres
ent so-called "sophomore machine"
! for which certain peoples are now
i looking into corners was born. Their
object was to take certain helpless
j things into their own hands —in
i short, to get a little organization in
; the political battle.

Well, they did. In a manner com
| mendable for its quietude, the lead
ers of the move lined up Row
pledges and put those freshmen of
; their choosing in office. In true party
i form they united behind candidates
for higher offices, and, as certain
Greek house office holders know, the
! organized frosh vote was something
| of a deciding factor.

This year those thirty-eighters arc
sophomores and their organization
| is ineptly called a "machine." And
! because it is called by this name it is
j of course accused of under-handed
. tactics, self-interest, selfish motives,
I railroading, and subversive activities
harmful to the best interests of the
people. If any group of sophomores
could be all that, they would be in
line for congratulations. As it is,
they're just sophomores who don't
agree with the rest of the campus
j that some unseen, omnipotent force
will guide the right candidates un
| aided into the right offices.

I UnofTicially the Row find Halls line
up facing each other when an elec
tion rolls around. Officially this
perfectly natural division is not rec
ognized. It is, however, such a hap
[ hazard line-up, it's .1 wonder how
any but the athletes ever get elected.
But the system goes on because the
campus has become impervious to
the pungent scent noticed by the
fresh noses of the freshmen last
year.
♦ *. »
Now the chances are that the
sophomore "machine"' will be al
lowed to go unmolested on their way
in attempting to dominate caucuses
and electing their own candidates.
But the sophomores have a glori
ous opportunity. They can make
their deodorant so smelly that even
a stench-unconscious campus will
begin to snilf. Then sanity mil lit
find its way into the political round
