# Immigrant Life Told In Novel Of Nebraska
## 
### 
"TAKE ALL TO NEBRASKA'' by
j Sophus Keith Winther is a sweeping
novel of immigrant life in the Mid
dle West. Oscar Winther, instructor
j in history at Stanford is the brother
of the author.
The story is parcel of the soil,
of the sowing of seed and the
j shucking of corn, the tending of
cattle and hogs and the unromantic
drudgery of every day farmer's
chores. It is told with a warm
comprehension that lifts the reader
into the unplastcred, cold living
room of the Grimsens at Weeping
Willow, Nebraska.
There, Peter Grimsen had settled
j with his family. It wasn't a good
j farm and the Grimsens, three years
i from Denmark, didn't know any
! thing about America. Townspeople
| out-traded them and their children
taunted the Grimsen boys. Hard
i winters followed hot summers and
i bumper harvests filled the cribs,
until the Grimsens had to build
j new barns and buy more hogs.
The troubles of immigrant
families in America is painted
clearly as is the blind courage
that these families, possess, with
their roots in the Old World and
| their bodies in the new.
Hans, .the third eldest son, is the
most appealing. Meta, the mother,
steadies the story, though the
father, Peter, is not as clearly defined
