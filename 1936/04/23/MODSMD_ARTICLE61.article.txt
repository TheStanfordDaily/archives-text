# Real Peace Contest Winner Named
## 
### 
Owen W. Matthews 3rd, a high
school graduate of Portland, Ore.,
was announced winner of the Eddie
Cantor $5,000 peace scholarship
prize, after the first named winner
was disqualified.
The judges, Robert M. Hutchins,
Frederick Bertrand Robinson, Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and Henry Noble
MacCracken, had previously chosen
Matthews' essay as second choice,
because it was "the most construc
tive, sincere, and interesting letter,
regardless of fancy writing."
as would seem best.
The book is well written, with a
running style that is direct and
sympathetic. The author under
stands children arid takes the reader
with them as they play Jesse James.
It is the casualness of such inci
dents that lends variety to this
rugged story.
