# Free Guest Meals Opposed
## Irregular Number Served Would Raise Board 
### 
Although it received enthusiastic
support from women of Stanford's
various dormitories, the prospect of
less expensive guest privileges and
mutual dining invitations yesterday
met up with an administrative finan
cial barrier.
The barrier, as Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls, ex
plained, is the fact that an irregu
larity in number of meals served
such as might be caused by free
guest privileges would have to be
met by higher board rates.
Advance Check
To make the plan at all feasible,
it was pointed out, some adequate
advance check on the number of
guests served in each dormitory
would have to be set up, and bal
anced against the number of paying
boarders who would be dining in
one of the other campus eating
groups for each particular meal.
This would add a great admin
istrative difficulty, officials claimed.
Meanwhile, proponents of the plan
argued that the ".slight increase in
expense and complications" would
be more than compensated by the
added informality of campus con
tacts and "tendency to unify the
Farm's social feeling."
Mercedes Bergmann, chairman of
Women's Conference, believes that
these increased privileges "would
certainly promote a greater feeling
of friendliness among the women,"
and therefore would be a good move.
Up to Union
She said, however, "The matter is
not up to the students but to the
Union Dining Hall, which manages
the others." She indicated, though,
that. Conference might attempt to
negotiate concerning the matter with
the University.
In explaining the? University's
financial stand, Miss Ricker said, "In
any university the board rate is
considered with regard to the aver
age attendance expected at meals,
which is never maximum.
"Also the fact must be considered
that in large units meals are plan
ned several days in advance, and the
ordering must be done three or four
days ahead. This necessary system
would meet with complications un
der a plan in which the amount of
dining room attendance would be
uncertain."
