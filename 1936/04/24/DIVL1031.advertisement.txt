Stanford's Seventh Annua!
Convalescent Home Drive
Stanford's way of doing things is too fully appreciated
to excite comment. But this year, in a greater degree
than ever before, Stanford has demonstrated its willing-
I ness to give wholeheartedly and unstintingly to a
worthy cause. A gay and joyous two weeks tempored
by the knowledge that fun for Stanford means sunâ€”
and food and health for the children in the Convalescent
Home.
