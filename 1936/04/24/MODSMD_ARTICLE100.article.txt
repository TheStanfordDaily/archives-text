Intercollegiate yachting — long
neglected in West Coast college
athletics —looms as a possibility
this summer. A letter recently re
ceived from the vice-president of
the Associated Students at Cal
Tech, Frank Jewett, asks Stan
ford's support and entry in a pro
posed regatta to be held in San
Diego June 14.
Through negotiations with
Southern California yachtsmen
Jewett has obtained the use of
eight Pacific Coast One-Design
sloops and the facilities of the San
Diego yacht harbor for the third
week in June.
Each university will enter one
crew of either three or four men
to handle one of the sloops in an
intercollegiate series of five races.
There will be a limit of eight
teams.
Possibility of Stanford's partici
pation rests chiefly upon the ob
taining of enough interested men
from which to select the crew.
Wally Brooke asks that all men in
terested who have had some sail
ing experience communicate with
him immediately.
