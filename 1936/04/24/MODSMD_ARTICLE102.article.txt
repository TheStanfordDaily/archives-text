# Dixon, King, Malott On J.C. Honor Roll
## 
### 
The N.C.A.A. puts out a know
it-all track pamphlet every year,
and included therein is a depart
ment devoted to the boys who get
little publicity anywhere else- the
J.C. runners. This year's J.C. honor
roll looks like an entry list of the
Big Meet tomoriow. Look:
American J.C. records are held
by Mushy Pollock of Cal in three
events—loo yards at 9.0, 220 yards
at 21.1, and the broad jump at
24-7 :i i. Mushy is a pretty good
runner, you see, and while U.S.C.
had him farmed out at Riverside
J.C. he really went to town.
Dixon's Fame
Warren Dixon of Stanford holds
the American J.C. mile record at
4:21?. fi, which he set while at San
Mateo J.C. in '154. Dix is trembling
when he watches the work of Cecil
Colo, another S.M.J.C. man who is
burning up the four-lap route this
year.
Tom Moore of California holds the
American J.C. high hurdles mark
at 14.5, while Del Fishback, another
Golden Bear, is co-holder of the
23.9-second low hurdle record. Both
were set at Sacramento J.C. in 1934.

tomorrow, but not competing. Gor
dy Dunn's 48-2' ! i shot put set at
Mcnlo J.C. in 1932, and Jack King's
149-4 discus throw at San Mateo

J.C. in 1934 arc still on the books
as American J.C. records. Another
orchid to Coach Tex Byrd of San
Mateo —he sure turns 'em out.
On the 1935 J.C. honor roll we
find another group. Rex Heap of
California is listed at 100 yards, 9 9;
200 yards, 21.8; and broad jump,
23-10%.

On the 1935 J.C. honor roll we
find another group. Rex Heap of
California is listed at 100 yards, 9 9;
200 yards, 21.8; and broad jump,
23-10%.
Archie Outranked
Here's one: Jack Weiershauser of
Stanford is listed ahead of Archie
Williams in the 220, the former hav
ing made 21 4 at Modesto and the
latter 21.9 at San Mateo, while Kay
Malott of Stanford is listed ahead of
the dusky Golden Bear in the quar
ter, with a mark of 49.5 set at
Fullerton J.C., outranking Williams'
49.7 best of last year.
Others on the honor roll are Do-
Witt. Good of Cal, fi-4 ; 's high jump
at San Mateo J.C.; John Wall of
Cal, 137-' i; discus throw at Recdley
J.C.. and Jack Lipman of Stanford,
45-11'j shot put at San Mateo J.C.
The N.C.A.A. puts out a know
it-all track pamphlet every year,
and included therein is a depart
ment devoted to the boys who get
little publicity anywhere else- the
J.C. runners. This year's J.C. honor
roll looks like an entry list of the
Big Meet tomoriow. Look:
American J.C. records are held
by Mushy Pollock of Cal in three
events—loo yards at 9.0, 220 yards
at 21.1, and the broad jump at
24-7 :i i. Mushy is a pretty good
runner, you see, and while U.S.C.
had him farmed out at Riverside
J.C. he really went to town.
Dixon's Fame
Warren Dixon of Stanford holds
the American J.C. mile record at
4:21?. fi, which he set while at San
Mateo J.C. in '154. Dix is trembling
when he watches the work of Cecil
Colo, another S.M.J.C. man who is
burning up the four-lap route this
year.
Tom Moore of California holds the
American J.C. high hurdles mark
at 14.5, while Del Fishback, another
Golden Bear, is co-holder of the
23.9-second low hurdle record. Both
were set at Sacramento J.C. in 1934.
Dunn. Kin;; Caesars
Other record holders will be there
tomorrow, but not competing. Gor
dy Dunn's 48-2' ! i shot put set at
Mcnlo J.C. in 1932, and Jack King's
149-4 discus throw at San Mateo

J.C. in 1934 arc still on the books
as American J.C. records. Another
orchid to Coach Tex Byrd of San
Mateo —he sure turns 'em out.
