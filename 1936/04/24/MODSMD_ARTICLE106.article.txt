### Tim Sullivan 
Veterans of future Stanford track
wars will face their first major en
gagement when they skirmish with
California's freshmen spikesters on
Edwards Field in Berkeley this
afternoon.
After a careful analysis of the
season's statistics the Bear Babes,
on past performances, are duped to
win, but many spirited individual
rivalries are expected to make the
Little Big Meet worthy of its name.
A series of come through perform
ances by Stanford could upset the
' prognostications and result in a
Papoose victory.
Speed Merchants
Both aggregations boast a prom
ising crop of sprinters. Captain Roy
Thompson of Stanford and his fleet
running mate Dick Carew are count
! Ed on to score heavily in the dashes
j against Lewis and Frick of the Cubs,
i Plenty of points are expected to go
| Farm-ward as a result of the timber
; topping labors of Bill Hawkins and
! Dick Bale who have been showing
| marked improvement each week and
are due to strike their peak today.
Hopes for a 440 triumph rest on
; Wilson Slater and Clinton Olson,
! while half mile duties go to John
j Fuller. These events are California's
forte and points picked up here
would give Indian chances a big
| boost.
Distance Dcmolishcrs
John "Workhorse" Emmanuel is
1 the local two mile candidate; the
mile will be handled by Leo Feder
! and John Paulson, who have only
' an outside chance to place. How
ever there is always the possibility
that the old workhorse will be
| trotted out for this race also.
Stanford will win the discus. This
' prediction is made fearlessly and
without reservation. Pete Zagar is
! a cinch to cop the top spot here, and
| should break the meet record.
Steve Taggart has a real jom in
j upholding the Indian end of the
j broad jump. Three Cal boys have
beaten 2.'} feet, with Kido setting a
! new Stanford-California record at
23 feet 6 inches.
Jumping Choiccs
Jack Siefert. (S) and Bob Canning
| (C) are both six footers in the high
jump; in the pole vault profound
i pessimism is the proper Papoose
j outlook. Smith can go 10 feet, but
I that isn't likely to offer any greater
| reward than the exercise gained in
I so doing.
j Bill Brownton, a potential 180—
, footer, should swing the javelin to
Stanford. The quarter-mile quartet,
of Thompson, Carew, Taggart, and
Soltero is counted on to break the

Edwards Field in Berkeley this
afternoon.
After a careful analysis of the
season's statistics the Bear Babes,
on past performances, are duped to
win, but many spirited individual
rivalries are expected to make the
Little Big Meet worthy of its name.
A series of come through perform
ances by Stanford could upset the
' prognostications and result in a
Papoose victory.
Speed Merchants
Both aggregations boast a prom
ising crop of sprinters. Captain Roy
Thompson of Stanford and his fleet
running mate Dick Carew are count
! Ed on to score heavily in the dashes
j against Lewis and Frick of the Cubs,
i Plenty of points are expected to go
| Farm-ward as a result of the timber
; topping labors of Bill Hawkins and
! Dick Bale who have been showing
| marked improvement each week and
are due to strike their peak today.
Hopes for a 440 triumph rest on
; Wilson Slater and Clinton Olson,
! while half mile duties go to John
j Fuller. These events are California's
forte and points picked up here
would give Indian chances a big
| boost.
Distance Dcmolishcrs
John "Workhorse" Emmanuel is
1 the local two mile candidate; the
mile will be handled by Leo Feder
! and John Paulson, who have only
' an outside chance to place. How
ever there is always the possibility
that the old workhorse will be
| trotted out for this race also.
Stanford will win the discus. This
' prediction is made fearlessly and
without reservation. Pete Zagar is
! a cinch to cop the top spot here, and
| should break the meet record.
Steve Taggart has a real jom in
j upholding the Indian end of the
j broad jump. Three Cal boys have
beaten 2.'} feet, with Kido setting a
! new Stanford-California record at
23 feet 6 inches.
Jumping Choiccs
Jack Siefert. (S) and Bob Canning
| (C) are both six footers in the high
jump; in the pole vault profound
i pessimism is the proper Papoose
j outlook. Smith can go 10 feet, but
I that isn't likely to offer any greater
| reward than the exercise gained in
I so doing.
j Bill Brownton, a potential 180—
, footer, should swing the javelin to
Stanford. The quarter-mile quartet,
of Thompson, Carew, Taggart, and
Soltero is counted on to break the
tape for the Indian babes in the
relay.
Veterans of future Stanford track
wars will face their first major en
gagement when they skirmish with
California's freshmen spikesters on
Edwards Field in Berkeley this
afternoon.
