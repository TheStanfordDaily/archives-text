# Law, Dey, Pommer, Braly Play in Ojai
## 
### 
Off for Ojai yesterday on a free
lance tour, four members of the dis
banded Stanford tennis team are
now engaged in competing in the
annual southern tournament. Ben
Dey, John Law, Bob Pommer, and
Bob Braly are the racket men who
comprise the wandering Indian
quartet.
Walt Ralphs and Art Stoefen are
reported to have embarked for Ojai
also, to have their fling at tourna
ment tennis.
