# Interest Booms In Women's Field Events
## Marlborough Grads Lead Field In Revival Of Feminine Farm Sports 
### Jane Heenan 
Not since 1929 has the women's j
oval been the scene of feminine 1
track and field events. The track, i
located in back of the hockey fields, !
was a very fine one, according to !
Grace King, member of the physical J
education staff, but because of the
great expense necessary to keep it in I
condition and because only a few j
were interested, the sport was aban
dond in 19130.
No Action This Spring
A petition was made this spring
by several Marlborough graduates
to have track autivity revived, but
nothing could be done this yeiu' as i
it was too late to include it in |
the department's budget. Barbara
Murphy, Trolley Mitchell, Phyllis ;
Boothe, Virginia Swafford, Kappas,
and Kay Moran, Pi Phi, were all
prominent in track and field events
in high school.
Barbara achieved success in
breaking the school record in the j
broad jump. She also high
jumped. ran in the dashes, and
threw the basketball. Kay and
Phyllis participated in the bas
ketball and baseball throws and
broad jump.
In 1929, the last successful track (

year for women, the turnout was
smaller than usual with only 20
women participating. Interclass
meets were held and the big meet
was run off on Field Day.
Eight Records Broken
Elizabeth Woody att was track
manager that year and part of her

| report states: "Although the turn-
I out for track was too small to make
j for any competition for positions on
class teams, there was a great deal
of individual interest and very bril
liant individual performance. Eight
existing records were broken and
the seniors were named champions."
The eight broken records were:
100—Marion Halle,v, 12 0; (15 high
I hurdles—Katherine Doyle, 10 2;
100 low hurdles — Doyle, 14 0;
running broad jump—Holley, 10
11 : shot put—Lydia Bowen, !>1
0; baseball throw—Thelma Pat
ton, ISI 7% ; basketball throw—
Holley, 74 1 ; arid relay—senior
class, 4.
Next year, if sufficient interest can
be worked up and agitation started
soon enough, it is very possible that
, track will once more be included on
the spring sports program.
