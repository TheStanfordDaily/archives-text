# Fowler Turns To Photos As Tendon Heals
## 
### 
Bob Fowler, the Cal track captain
hors de combat with a bum Achilles
tendon, is not through taking part
in the Big Meet.
Tomorrow spectators in the Sta
dium will see the lanky, be-specta
cled two-miler, in cords and Big C
sweater, flitting about the field with
his newest hobby, a camera, in hand,
snapping pictures of all of the ath
| letes in action.
Fowler, a geology major from
Piedmont, is a hard-working team
i captain, always giving a hand to any
of the men on his team, and finds
photography, amateur as it may
be, an interesting avocation while
watching over the welfare of his
mates.
