# Indians Meet California Golf Teams Today
## Four Stanford Men Still In Race for Northern California Links Title 
### M. Jack Newman 
Stanford faces its biggest golf
week with the California matches for
both varsity and Freshmen and the
final matches of the Northern Cali
fornia Amateur Championship at
Sacramento.
As this morning dawns about 20
Stanford golfers set out for the
Bear's day to bait him with a series
of drives, mashie shots and putts.
This year the Stanford men are not
over-confident as they were two
years ago when an unknown Cali
fornia team eked out a half-point
win over a highly touted Cardinal
aggregation.
Team Partially Named
Varsity men who are scheduled to
go are Stewart, Edwards, Thompson,
Erskine, O'Neal, Crable, Wallace,
Dillon, Cannon, Hass, Davis, and
Welch.
Stanford will have four chances
out of eight to win the Northern
California Amateur Golf cham
pionship tomorrow.
It doesn't take any betting com
missioner or higher math shark to
figure that out; four gentlemen by
the names of "Spec" Stewart, Don
Edwards, Hank Edwards, and Bill
Dwyer took special care of that by
winning berths in the quarter-final
matches, which will be played in
Sacramento tomorrow morning.
Dwyer Battle
Along with these Stanford can lay
a claim to Tom Dwyer who, now an
alumnus, played golf for the Stan
ford team in the past three years.
He was the one who burned up the
Sacramento course Saturday to
snatch medal honors. Pa Dwyer's
going to be put in a tough spot on
Saturday as his two boys brush up
against each other in civil warfare.
In the other side of the bracket,
Ernie Peiper plays Frank Sheldon.
Peiper is a national figure in golf
and should be favored, though his
game has not been tops of late. He
had a tough time putting Stanford's
A1 Hyman out in a match in which
neither of them broke 80.
In the lower bracket the first
match is an all - Stanford battle
between Don Edwards and Spec
Stewart, Stanford's two top mashie
wielders. Flip a coin and call your
choice; they have played plenty of
matches around the Farm and it
looks as though it's best to call the
winner when it's all over.
In the last match. Hank Edwards,
the Farm's forgotten but improv
ing golfer, meets up with Carl
Swanson, who seems to be a "dark
horse" in the galaxy of Stanford
white hopes. If Hank holds to his
present game he may be the man
to play the winner of the Stewart-
Edwards match.
