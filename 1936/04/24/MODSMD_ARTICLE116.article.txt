# Big Meet A Toss-up, Says U.C. Writer
## Cal Hopeful Despite Loss Of 4 Stars; California Claims 4 Cinch Firsts

Minus four stars —Captain Bob !
Fowler, George Anderson, Dick
Brace, and Bob Heavey—who would
give them a definite advantage in
the pre-meet dope sheets, Cali
fornia's Golden Bears will invade '
Palo Alto Saturday for the 43rd Big
Meet with a fifty-fifty chance of
winning.
Fowler has definitely given up
hope of competing at all this year
and is saving his eligibility for 1937. j
Heavey and Anderson are both
hopeful of getting into the meet at
the last minute but their condition >
is so doubtful that Boar fans are not
counting on their appearance.
Hamilton Silent
Performances by both Indians and
Bears have been so contradictory in
competition to date that it is diffi
cult to "call" the meet at all closely.
Brutus Hamilton, the California
mentor, refuses even to discuss a
possible dope sheet, saying "There
is only one thing I am sure of in this
meet and that is that we won't get
better than a third place out of the
mile."
Blue and Gold supporters, how
ever, figure that the Bears are sure
of first places in the 440, low hurdles,
pole vault and javelin. Stanford
appears a cinch in the mile, 880, dis
cus and high jump with the remain
ing seven places very much of a
tossup.
Favors Dean
Most doubtful of all the events is
the broad jump. Here anything is
liable to happen. Neither team has
anyone who can jump consistently
over 23 feet. But on past perform
ances, it appears that Ray Dean of
the Card is the most likely winner.
Despite the fact that California's
relay team won three early season
tests from the Indian quartet, the
Bears are hoping that they can clinch
the meet before the final event. Fail
ure to click in recent meets plus the
fact that probably all of the Bear
relay men will be running their sec
ond or third race of the day pre
vents Berkeley fans from putting
too much dependence on their
quartet.
