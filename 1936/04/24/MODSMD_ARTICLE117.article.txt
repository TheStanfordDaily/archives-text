For the benefit of visiting alumni,
Coach Tiny Thornhill will hold a
special football scrimmage this after
noon at 4:15 o'clock.
Scrimmaging on the first string
this quarter have been Williams,
Coffis, Paulrnan, and Collins in the
backfield. Chet Olcott and Carl
Scljott, both experienced varsity
men, have been playing on the
flanks. Tackles are Dave Carnahan,
star of the freshman line, and Bob
Mangan, a veteran; Jay Holdridgs
and Ralph Quails at guard; and
Nellie Heath and Dick Sutton alter
nating in the pivot position, com
plete the lineup.
Leo Madlem, small, speedy full
back, has left spring practices to join

the track team.
Thornhill plans to give as many
players as possible a chance to show
their ability in this afternoon's
scrimmage. About nine new men
reported this week, but they are not
in good enough shape for scrim
mage.
