# 10.7 In Century! They Walked the Mile Gay, Gray 90's
## 
### 
It was back in '93, just 43 years
I ago, that a fellow named Bernard
shot through the century in the
i amazing time ol 10.7 to make track
history for Stanford in the first Big
Meet.
i California heat the Indians that
day with times like 28 2/5 in the
low hurdles, 2:05.4 in the 880, 5:04
j in the mile, 52.5 in the 440. The

shot put was won by a tremendous r
heave, 36 feet 8 inches. The pole
vaulters balked at anything over l'Ji
I feet, and the high jump event wei jft j
i at 5 feet 8 inches.
Even in '99 the best Smith, Sta n- |
ford's ace miler, could do was 4:39i.8. j
1 Of course. Smith had a good exc use. j
The Daily reports (April 21, J X 99) j
that Smith "has been confined to his
room with a budly inflamed toe." J
But Smith (all honor to his ifame)
! came through and won.
Not only did they run the oiile in
the gay nineties but they -walked
it too! Cal took that event, 7.':42. By
that time, though, they hat) raised j
the shot put mark to 39 feet 10 j
inches.
My, Sarah, how tirrios have ;
' changed!
