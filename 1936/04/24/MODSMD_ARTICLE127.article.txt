# B. V.D. 's For Coach, Also Fish, Clarinet

### Dave Botsford 
Moon-faced, heavy-jowled '"Big j
Ben" Winkleman, recruited from
Texas this quarter for Tiny Thorn
hill's coaching staff, sat down heav
ily in his B.A.C. swivel chair yes
terday and told about himself.
"I may kid you some," he grinned, j
J "but I won't lie." His twinkling eyes
and genial Southern accent proved
him not the gangster-type he looks
i in newspaper photos.
Every grid coach has his super- ;
| stitions. Favorite ties, shirts, and
especially underwear are Ben H.
Winkleman's.
Superannuated Drawers
r "I had a pair of old B.V.D.'s I wore
lat every big game for 12 years. I
I guess my wife got tired of sewing
! new seats in them for when we
! came out here last month she threw
i them away."
Next to football, fishing is Big
Ben's hobby. Pie spends two months
of every summer up in Yellowstone
angling for trout. Fact is, he got to
really know Tiny Thornhill on a
fishing trip.
"I came out to Stanford in 1931
to the summer coaching school di
rected by Tiny and Pop Warner," he
said. "Afterwards, Tiny, Pop, my
wife and I went on a four weeks'
fishing trip. We really caught some
beauties that time."
He enjoys track, thinks the Cards
| have a big chance of beating the
I Bears tomorrow, but in college—
j the U. of Arkansas—he concentrated
I on football and baseball.

I "I earned my way through school j
l playing the clarinet and sax. I i
1 guess I was bandmaster, but the
college band wasn't much. Some of
us got up a dance orchestra and
that brought in some handy cash."
When Mr. and Mrs. Winkleman
migrated here from Fort Worth,
where he coached high school foot
ball successfully for nine years,
they brought young Mr. Winkleman
with them — Ben Warner, age 5.
' Like his mat her, he's a great foot
ball fan, but thinks he'll be a beefy j
; tackle rather than a quarterback.
Likes Air Attack
Texas and the Southwest is the
center of wide-open football, but
Winkleman believes the ground
| game fundamental and the aerial
j attack augmentary.
I "It's sometimes overlooked that
Stanford has a fine passing team as j
far as percentages are concerned, j
i Tiny's passing attack is well con- ;
j ceived. I guess I'll just help him j
| carry it out."
Sandy-haired and tanned, Coach
Winkleman looks much less than
; his 37 years—l 4 of them coaching
' years. His 5 feet IOV-j inches carry
| 205 pounds. From the looks of things
! out at spring practice, I guess he
; is as tough as he looks.
