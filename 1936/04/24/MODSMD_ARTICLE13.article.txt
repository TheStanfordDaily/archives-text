# Bookstore Profits Voted to Student Aid
## Board Okays Plan Which Student Poll Favored 
### 
Profits from the Stanford Book
| store will be turned over to the
I Commission for Student Aid and the
j rebate system will be abandoned as
J a result of action taken by the board
of directors of the store, Professor
j E. P. Lesley, president of the board,
| announced yesterday.
In taking this action the hoard
adopted the proposal which re
ceived a plurality vote in a poll
taken at the time of the mid-year
A.S.S.U. elections in February.
Of the plans submitted the schol
arship contribution received 403
j voces; continuation of the pro rata
' rebate, 318; establishment of a stu-
I dent loan library, 265; and miscel
laneous proposals, 69. Only about
one-third of the students registered
! at Stanford voiced their opinions at
the election.
Professor Lesley estimates that
| profits for this year will amount to
between $2,000 and $3,000, which
will flow into the coffers of the
scholarship fund.
In order to effect the change from
the rebate system the board passed
the following amendment to the by-
I laws of the store:
"Net profits shall constitute the
residuum after all expenses and re
! bates, if any, have been paid or pro
vided for, and may be added to the
1 common property of the Bookstore
or devoted to educational, chari
table, or benevolent purposes con
nected with the functions of the
University at the discretion of the
Board of Directors."
