ermen. But there doesn't seem to be
many good fishing spots any more."
Theodore Jesse Hoover, dean of
the Stanford engineering school
since 1925, is retiring in June—to
fish. He's frankly worried about
fishing possibilities of the future. As
a member of the Stale Chamber of
Commerce's conservation committee
he's going to see that the lot of the
trout fisherman is improved.

will give up engineering and take up
fishing for good.
