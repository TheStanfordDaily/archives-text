# Hoover Retires to Seek Good Fishing
## 
### Walton Wickett 
"We Hoovers are a family of fish
ermen. But there doesn't seem to be
many good fishing spots any more."
Theodore Jesse Hoover, dean of
the Stanford engineering school
since 1925, is retiring in June—to
fish. He's frankly worried about
fishing possibilities of the future. As
a member of the Stale Chamber of
Commerce's conservation committee
he's going to see that the lot of the
trout fisherman is improved.
Class of '01
First of all, though, Dean Hoover
is an engineer. He entered Stanford
as a freshman in 1897 with no plan
for his future. For no particular
reason he began majoring in mining
engineering, graduated with his A.B.
in 1901 to begin 18 years' commer
cial work as a mining engineer.
From a position as assayer for a
California company, he jumped to
London as a consulting engineer.
With this British concern he devel
oped the fiotation process of ore con
centration, went to Australia to ap
ply the process in actual mining
work.
After conducting mining opera
tions in Australia, Russia Europe,
the engineering faculty.
India, and even faraway Burma,
Theodore Jesse Hoover landed bnek
at the Farm in 1919 as a nu'inhcr <>f

After he has retired in June, fin
ished his third book next, year—a
non-technical work entitled "Voca
tional Guidance for Young Engi-

neers' with Professor Emeritus John
C. L. Fish as co-author—the dean
will give up engineering and take up
fishing for good.
This small, pudgy man, who looks
not unlike his famed brother Her
bert. likes to tell nbout his under


Theodore J. Hoover
graduate days on the Farm.
"The student manager in those
early years spent all the A.S.S.U.
I funds as he got them. But with the
' help of The Daily I got through the
| system of saving five per cent of the
annual income. In a few years the
student body found itself with a
sizeable bank account. Enough
money had been saved to build a
j training house, track, and stadium,
later replaced by the present ones."
Hoover has words to encourage
the youngster who enters college
i with little idea of his future. "1
don't think it lies within the power
of the individual to plot out his life
while just a student in college. One
thing develops out of another. The
fact to be emphasized is that each
day's work should be done well."
His ranch on the .sea-coast near
Pescadero is well known to Stan
ford men who have played ball there
at the annual engineers' picnics.
■ Here he will make his home, quietly
| carry on his experiments with fish
j propagation. If you don't find him at
| his ranch, though, try the .best trout
I streams in the High Sierras.

"We Hoovers are a family of fish
ermen. But there doesn't seem to be
many good fishing spots any more."
Theodore Jesse Hoover, dean of
the Stanford engineering school
since 1925, is retiring in June—to
fish. He's frankly worried about
fishing possibilities of the future. As
a member of the Stale Chamber of
Commerce's conservation committee
he's going to see that the lot of the
trout fisherman is improved.
Class of '01
First of all, though, Dean Hoover
is an engineer. He entered Stanford
as a freshman in 1897 with no plan
for his future. For no particular
reason he began majoring in mining
engineering, graduated with his A.B.
in 1901 to begin 18 years' commer
cial work as a mining engineer.
From a position as assayer for a
California company, he jumped to
London as a consulting engineer.
With this British concern he devel
oped the fiotation process of ore con
centration, went to Australia to ap
ply the process in actual mining
work.
After conducting mining opera
tions in Australia, Russia Europe,
the engineering faculty.
India, and even faraway Burma,
Theodore Jesse Hoover landed bnek
at the Farm in 1919 as a nu'inhcr <>f

After he has retired in June, fin
ished his third book next, year—a
non-technical work entitled "Voca
tional Guidance for Young Engi-

neers' with Professor Emeritus John
C. L. Fish as co-author—the dean
will give up engineering and take up
fishing for good.
This small, pudgy man, who looks
not unlike his famed brother Her
bert. likes to tell nbout his under


Theodore J. Hoover
graduate days on the Farm.
"The student manager in those
early years spent all the A.S.S.U.
I funds as he got them. But with the
' help of The Daily I got through the
| system of saving five per cent of the
annual income. In a few years the
student body found itself with a
sizeable bank account. Enough
money had been saved to build a
j training house, track, and stadium,
later replaced by the present ones."
Hoover has words to encourage
the youngster who enters college
i with little idea of his future. "1
don't think it lies within the power
of the individual to plot out his life
while just a student in college. One
thing develops out of another. The
fact to be emphasized is that each
day's work should be done well."
