## Construction of Dam Will Add to Water Supply

â€¢
i Alumni returning to the Farm for
University Day two years hence will
| include a new beauty spot in their
i sightseeing itinerary, if the admin
! istration approves a proposal to
build a new lake one mile below
Searsville dam.
Decision on the matter must be
made within a year, according to an
I agreement reached between Stan
ford and the Bear Gulch Water
Company last week.
] The water company granted per
i mission to build a dam 95 feet high
j across San Francisquito Creek, from
which it now obtains part of its
water supply for peninsula commu
| nities.
Engineers estimate that one year's
I time would be required for con-
I struction of the project, and the
| agreement states that the work, if
; undertaken, must be completed two
I years from the date of signature.
The proposal is now under consid
eration by University officials.
The new lake, which would be
twice as large as Searsville, Felt, and
Lagunita combined, would provide
not only an abundant source of
fresh drinking water, but would
also furnish a year 'round resort
I center and facilities for irrigation
I of now arid lands.
