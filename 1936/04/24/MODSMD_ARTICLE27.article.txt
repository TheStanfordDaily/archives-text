# Cards, Bears To Settle Track Supremacy In Big Meet Tomorrow
## Indians Slightly Favored To Score Twelfth Win Over Cal in 13 Years 
### Phil Klauber 
Its Bis Meet day again tomorrow,
folks. With all the heritage of 43
years of Stanford-California track
meets back of them, a bunch of run
ners and jumpers will go out in the
Stadium arena and settle the issue,
settle whether that dumping last
year started a long downswing of
the cycle, or whether it was just a
momentary dip, an intermission in
Cardinal Big Meet supremacy.
I'or its just that. Both schools
have their new track plants, and the
start tomorrow — javelin at 1:45,
mile at 2:00—will be from scratch.
Alter the score board has upset
the usual number of dope sheets,
the winning team will be on the
"in" for a long while, as the results
will really determine where the
new generation of track athletes
wilt go to school this decade.
No use predicting, as anything
, can happen—it always does—in the
Big Meet. The great rivals seem to
do something to each other that gets

out come-through performances in
I no way related to pre-meet marks.
The best thing to do is to talk about
| the boys at the shorter odds.
Dink Optimistic
Coach Dink Templeton, the Great
I Optimist, who has won 11 of the last
12 Big Meets, first picks one team,
! then the other to win by 20 points,
finally ends up by saying "It de
j pends a lot on how Dean and Klop
; stock come out in their early races.
If we didn't get points in the 100
j and the highs, we would be in an
j awfully tough spot."
Cal's loss of I)ick Brace, who
, came down with the measles Wed
nesday, brings the meet down to
close proportions and ruins what
would have been a great half-mile
race, as Dick hasn't met a Stan
ford front runner like thus Bill
McCurdy since he's been here.
It is hoped the 880 won't be the
final deciding factor.
Stanford's big hopes lie in the
distance runs, the discus, and high
jump. Chuck Nimnio, in spite of the
cold he has contracted, is expected
to do one or both of two things—run
front in the mile for a new meet rec
ord, which he both wants and de
serves, or lie back, take the race, and
save something for points in the
two-mile, which Dink wants him to
run, or the 880, which he will prob
ably run.
.Toe Burris, Warren Dixon, and Ed
| Burrows are all in tip-top shape,
1 and will not surprise by winning
J their long-distance runs.
I The Stanford discus crew of Levy,
; Gribben, Hurley, and Hershcy can
j easily sweep their event, although
; John Wall of California is expected
to break in. The seven high-jutnp
| ers who have cleared 6-1 this year,
led by Humbert Smith with a top
| of 6-714, must take a majority of
| the points in that event.
From there it gets a little shakier
! Reynolds (S), Kitts (C), Hershey
, (S), and Mackey (C) have all hit 50
i feet in the shot, so you pick one.
! Reynolds has the most experience
; beyond 51 feet. The broad jump is
I wide open, with Stanford': Leo
Madlem and Ray Dean, the co-win
ner oi' last year, up against Wilson,
Pollock, and Heap, all capable Gold
en Bears.
California may have the man of
the day in Archie Williams, wlao has
been coming too close to record
times for comfort. He should run a
sterling quarter tomorrow, and then
will either enter the 220 or relay,
both of which need him badly. The
Mushy Pollock-Ray Dean 100 is
picked by the wags to be a natural,
but the time, as all stadium times,
will be slower than representative of
the race I hat is run.
The hurdles are still wide open,
with Sammy Klopstock running
against Moore and Fishback of Cal,
both world-beaters at their best.
Forget not that Sam is a former na
tional champ in both races, and that
he has been working this week.
The finale of the afternoon, the
relay, will be like last year—close.
If Stanford needs the points, Tem
picton has promised Jack Weiers
hauser a 10-yard lead for his an
chor lap against Williams. But can
you pile up 10 yards against Wea
ver, Stout, and Helmer?

against Moore and Fishback of Cal,
both world-beaters at their best.
Forget not that Sam is a former na
tional champ in both races, and that
he has been working this week.
The finale of the afternoon, the
relay, will be like last year—close.
If Stanford needs the points, Tem
picton has promised Jack Weiers
hauser a 10-yard lead for his an
chor lap against Williams. But can
you pile up 10 yards against Wea

Its Bis Meet day again tomorrow,
folks. With all the heritage of 43
years of Stanford-California track
meets back of them, a bunch of run
ners and jumpers will go out in the
Stadium arena and settle the issue,
settle whether that dumping last
year started a long downswing of
the cycle, or whether it was just a
momentary dip, an intermission in
Cardinal Big Meet supremacy.
I'or its just that. Both schools
have their new track plants, and the
start tomorrow — javelin at 1:45,
mile at 2:00—will be from scratch.
Alter the score board has upset
the usual number of dope sheets,
the winning team will be on the
"in" for a long while, as the results
will really determine where the
new generation of track athletes
wilt go to school this decade.
No use predicting, as anything
, can happen—it always does—in the
Big Meet. The great rivals seem to
do something to each other that gets

out come-through performances in
I no way related to pre-meet marks.
The best thing to do is to talk about
| the boys at the shorter odds.
Dink Optimistic
Coach Dink Templeton, the Great
I Optimist, who has won 11 of the last
12 Big Meets, first picks one team,
! then the other to win by 20 points,
finally ends up by saying "It de
j pends a lot on how Dean and Klop
; stock come out in their early races.
If we didn't get points in the 100
j and the highs, we would be in an
j awfully tough spot."
Cal's loss of I)ick Brace, who
, came down with the measles Wed
nesday, brings the meet down to
close proportions and ruins what
would have been a great half-mile
race, as Dick hasn't met a Stan
ford front runner like thus Bill
McCurdy since he's been here.
It is hoped the 880 won't be the
final deciding factor.
Stanford's big hopes lie in the
distance runs, the discus, and high
jump. Chuck Nimnio, in spite of the
cold he has contracted, is expected
to do one or both of two things—run
front in the mile for a new meet rec
ord, which he both wants and de
serves, or lie back, take the race, and
save something for points in the
two-mile, which Dink wants him to
run, or the 880, which he will prob
ably run.
.Toe Burris, Warren Dixon, and Ed
| Burrows are all in tip-top shape,
1 and will not surprise by winning
J their long-distance runs.
I The Stanford discus crew of Levy,
; Gribben, Hurley, and Hershcy can
j easily sweep their event, although
; John Wall of California is expected
to break in. The seven high-jutnp
| ers who have cleared 6-1 this year,
led by Humbert Smith with a top
| of 6-714, must take a majority of
| the points in that event.
From there it gets a little shakier
! Reynolds (S), Kitts (C), Hershey
, (S), and Mackey (C) have all hit 50
i feet in the shot, so you pick one.
! Reynolds has the most experience
; beyond 51 feet. The broad jump is
I wide open, with Stanford': Leo
Madlem and Ray Dean, the co-win
ner oi' last year, up against Wilson,
Pollock, and Heap, all capable Gold
en Bears.
California may have the man of
the day in Archie Williams, wlao has
been coming too close to record
times for comfort. He should run a
sterling quarter tomorrow, and then
will either enter the 220 or relay,
both of which need him badly. The
Mushy Pollock-Ray Dean 100 is
picked by the wags to be a natural,
but the time, as all stadium times,
will be slower than representative of
the race I hat is run.

times for comfort. He should run a
sterling quarter tomorrow, and then
will either enter the 220 or relay,
both of which need him badly. The
Mushy Pollock-Ray Dean 100 is
picked by the wags to be a natural,
but the time, as all stadium times,
will be slower than representative of
the race I hat is run.
The hurdles are still wide open,
with Sammy Klopstock running
against Moore and Fishback of Cal,
both world-beaters at their best.
Forget not that Sam is a former na
tional champ in both races, and that
he has been working this week.
The finale of the afternoon, the
relay, will be like last year—close.
If Stanford needs the points, Tem
picton has promised Jack Weiers
hauser a 10-yard lead for his an
chor lap against Williams. But can
you pile up 10 yards against Wea
ver, Stout, and Helmer?
Its Bis Meet day again tomorrow,
folks. With all the heritage of 43
years of Stanford-California track
meets back of them, a bunch of run
ners and jumpers will go out in the
Stadium arena and settle the issue,
settle whether that dumping last
year started a long downswing of
the cycle, or whether it was just a
momentary dip, an intermission in
Cardinal Big Meet supremacy.
I'or its just that. Both schools
have their new track plants, and the
start tomorrow — javelin at 1:45,
mile at 2:00—will be from scratch.
Alter the score board has upset
the usual number of dope sheets,
the winning team will be on the
"in" for a long while, as the results
will really determine where the
new generation of track athletes
wilt go to school this decade.
No use predicting, as anything
, can happen—it always does—in the
Big Meet. The great rivals seem to
do something to each other that gets

out come-through performances in
I no way related to pre-meet marks.
The best thing to do is to talk about
| the boys at the shorter odds.
Dink Optimistic
Coach Dink Templeton, the Great
I Optimist, who has won 11 of the last
12 Big Meets, first picks one team,
! then the other to win by 20 points,
finally ends up by saying "It de
j pends a lot on how Dean and Klop
; stock come out in their early races.
If we didn't get points in the 100
j and the highs, we would be in an
j awfully tough spot."
Cal's loss of I)ick Brace, who
, came down with the measles Wed
nesday, brings the meet down to
close proportions and ruins what
would have been a great half-mile
race, as Dick hasn't met a Stan
ford front runner like thus Bill
McCurdy since he's been here.
It is hoped the 880 won't be the
final deciding factor.
Stanford's big hopes lie in the
distance runs, the discus, and high
jump. Chuck Nimnio, in spite of the
cold he has contracted, is expected
to do one or both of two things—run
front in the mile for a new meet rec
ord, which he both wants and de
serves, or lie back, take the race, and
save something for points in the
two-mile, which Dink wants him to
run, or the 880, which he will prob
ably run.
.Toe Burris, Warren Dixon, and Ed
| Burrows are all in tip-top shape,
1 and will not surprise by winning
J their long-distance runs.
I The Stanford discus crew of Levy,
; Gribben, Hurley, and Hershcy can
j easily sweep their event, although
; John Wall of California is expected
to break in. The seven high-jutnp
| ers who have cleared 6-1 this year,
led by Humbert Smith with a top
| of 6-714, must take a majority of
| the points in that event.
From there it gets a little shakier
! Reynolds (S), Kitts (C), Hershey
, (S), and Mackey (C) have all hit 50
i feet in the shot, so you pick one.
! Reynolds has the most experience
; beyond 51 feet. The broad jump is
I wide open, with Stanford': Leo
Madlem and Ray Dean, the co-win
ner oi' last year, up against Wilson,
Pollock, and Heap, all capable Gold
en Bears.
