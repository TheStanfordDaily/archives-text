# Springtime Means Kisstime to Huskies
## 
### 
Spring has come to the northland
' —especially to the Seattle campus
of the University of Washington.
And with spring have come kisses,
as plentiful as the daffodils.
Husky men and co-eds a few
| mornings ago winced .at "Watch
man Whistles — Overlooks Campus
! Kisses," an article on spring kisses
Iby a campus "authority" in the
I Washington Daily.
"Only the campus moon could
j number the kisses exchanged under
! its dim glow. Wise men investigate
other things, probably because
| thinking and kissing do not go well
together. But the subject is ever on
I the mouths of warm-hearted co-eds
! and soft-hearted collegians," the
story began.
"The soft, new breath of spring
makes a better setting than frost or
I rain. Winter kisses are hot-house
plants. A kiss is more than four lips
j and two smacks. Although not es-
I thetic to watch, to indulge is heaven,
j hell, fire, and bliss. The kiss is theft,
| a delight, an error, a betrayal, an
I ecstasy. It is a tease. It is nothing.
| It is everything."
| Washington readers were re
minded that cheap kisses, with the
] people who gave them, are soon for
j gotten. But a hard-won kiss is re
! membered long—a master key which
j has opened many hearts to each
I other.
I A kiss was found insufficient evi
j dance in breach of promise suits—
j it's too common and insignificant in
| the eyes of the law. But an uncon
i sented kiss is battery. Washington
; too hot to handle. Carpenter has

j and has been an active officer of the
League for Industrial Democracy.
That's one on Henry P. Fletcher!
| CHARLES SCHWAB, the steel
j tycoon, gathered reporters around
| him last week just before his
! steamer set sail for England.
"I have spent my entire life in
; the pursuit of money, and now that
i I have become an old man I realize
that a lifetime spent in doing noth
i ing but amassing a fortune is of no
value. I am not happy. I advise
j the youth of America to seek other
| fields of endeavor if they want to
I find happiness.

kissers can be fined and jailed for 30
' days for such an "unwanted" of-
I fense.
"Kisses exchanged on the cheek
; are not satisfactory — except for
grandmothers and cousins. A kiss
traded with the lips receives what
it gives, and more."
Short kisses were found unsatis
factory. A goodnight kiss is the
most tender. It is a "symbol of
friendship, an intimate farewell, a
sweet salve to the pain of parting."
Men contemplating a kiss must be
| confident above all, the reporter ad
vised. Most girls don't mind being
kissed, but they like to make up
their minds. It is merely a matter
of understanding the girl, of know
ing when she is ready to succumb,
because the most satisfactory kiss
is one which has mutual consent.
The article concluded: "The mas
terful male draws her slowly and
; lovingly to his heart—yet firmly.
She may resist but he is stronger.
He takes good aim—the lips meet—
: the eyes close—Perfection."
