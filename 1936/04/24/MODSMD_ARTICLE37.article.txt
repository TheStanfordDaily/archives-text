## DOPE PICKS CARDS, BUT TOO ROSY A HUE? 
### 
Everything looks rosy. Strictly,
however, a Cardinal rosy with all
the dope sheets around here saying
that the Cardinals are going to win.
Which is all very fine, hut when
you begin to figure that last week
our coach and most everybody else
was moping around and picking Cal,
it seems almost too good. The only
thing that's happened since last week
is that Brace is out, and on a strictly
rational plane it is hard to see why
just one man can cause all of this
cinch talk going the rounds.
But darn it, the dope sheet Dink
gives us on Page 3 looks O.K. if
you're from Stanford. The score
could very well be 79-52. But it also
could be Cal G7-(>4 if the possible
phoney breaks did materialize.
It is, in toto, a come-back to the
old chestnut of "all a matter of de
gree." If the breaks go even, in this
matter of degree, we will win. But
that debacle (you pronounce it) of
last spring thai saw the Bears whip
us with an avalanche of well-timed
upsets is like a spectre hovering over
/he Stadium, like a Goodyear blimp,
but not quite as real.
When you recall how few dope
sheets have had any cogency at all
in the past you must lose any sound
faith in them. And when you realize
that these hoys are nervous and tem
permental actors in Big Meet compe
tition, you can not go down the list
of events and pick them with any
surety at all.
But I'd personally give a night's
sleep and a couple of meals to see
our men win the meet, and will
stand firmly, as firmly as possible,
behind the Daily's 70Vz to 60'/a
choice.
Dink Templeton, maestro and
spearhead of the Red phalanx, spots
as his "crooshul" the 100-yard dash.
The dope sheet boys give it to Pol
lock. Dink thinks Ray Dean will
have something to say about that.
Pollock last week was five yards
ahead of the field in the century, and
about two ahead at the finish. Dink
figures that Ray will he two yards
behind after 25 yards and one ahead,
just enough to win. at the tape. He
fondly hftpes so. and if Ray can do
just that Dink figures that his wor
ries arc about over.
In other events, especially the
broad jump, shot, javelin, 220, and
hurdles the stakes are high. The
athletes who come through in these j
will be deciding the meet.

you're from Stanford. The score
could very well be 79-52. But it also
could be Cal G7-(>4 if the possible
phoney breaks did materialize.
It is, in toto, a come-back to the
old chestnut of "all a matter of de
gree." If the breaks go even, in this
matter of degree, we will win. But
that debacle (you pronounce it) of
last spring thai saw the Bears whip
us with an avalanche of well-timed
upsets is like a spectre hovering over
/he Stadium, like a Goodyear blimp,
but not quite as real.
When you recall how few dope
sheets have had any cogency at all
in the past you must lose any sound
faith in them. And when you realize
that these hoys are nervous and tem
permental actors in Big Meet compe
tition, you can not go down the list
of events and pick them with any
surety at all.
But I'd personally give a night's
sleep and a couple of meals to see
our men win the meet, and will
stand firmly, as firmly as possible,
behind the Daily's 70Vz to 60'/a
choice.
Dink Templeton, maestro and
spearhead of the Red phalanx, spots
as his "crooshul" the 100-yard dash.
The dope sheet boys give it to Pol
lock. Dink thinks Ray Dean will
have something to say about that.
Pollock last week was five yards
ahead of the field in the century, and
about two ahead at the finish. Dink
figures that Ray will he two yards
behind after 25 yards and one ahead,
just enough to win. at the tape. He
fondly hftpes so. and if Ray can do
just that Dink figures that his wor
ries arc about over.
In other events, especially the
broad jump, shot, javelin, 220, and
hurdles the stakes are high. The
athletes who come through in these j
will be deciding the meet.

Everything looks rosy. Strictly,
however, a Cardinal rosy with all
the dope sheets around here saying
that the Cardinals are going to win.
Which is all very fine, hut when
you begin to figure that last week
our coach and most everybody else
was moping around and picking Cal,
it seems almost too good. The only
thing that's happened since last week
is that Brace is out, and on a strictly
rational plane it is hard to see why
just one man can cause all of this
cinch talk going the rounds.
But darn it, the dope sheet Dink
gives us on Page 3 looks O.K. if
you're from Stanford. The score
could very well be 79-52. But it also
