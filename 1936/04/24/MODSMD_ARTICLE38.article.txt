# Yale Phi Betes Plan Requirement Change
## 
### 
Vale chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
has proposed changing requirements
for membership, making general
achievement more important than
high marks. The committee pro
poses "that prior consideration be
given to averages, but due regard
also be given such factors as diffi
culty of courses taken, the quality
of preparation for college, . . . and
the improvement in grades since
freshman year."
