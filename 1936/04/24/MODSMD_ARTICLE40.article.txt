# Brutus Gives Cards Edge For Victory
## 
### 
Brutus Hamilton, the big, silent
California track coach, feels that,
with breaks being evenly divided,
Stanford should annex a majority
of the points tomorrow afternoon.
He stated as much last Saturday
after the Washington meet, and
the implication goes with even
more strength now that George
Anderson is definitely out of the
meet, Dick Brace is in bed with
(he measles, and Bob Heavey still
weak from the satne affliction.
He also stated that he knew
nothing definite on the current
squabble concerning his team's
participation in the California In
tercollegiates or the 1.C.4-A. May
29 and 30.
