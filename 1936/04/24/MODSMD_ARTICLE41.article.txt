# Rival Coaches Once Olympic Teammates
## 
### 
Watching from opposite sides of
(he stadium tomorrow the teams
they have trained will be two for
mer team-mates, Stanford's Robert
Lyman "Dink" Templeton and Cali
fornia's Brutus Hamilton.
It was at Antwerp in 1920 that
Hamilton and Dink competed in the
decathlon and broad jump, respec- i
tively, for the American Olympic
team.
A tow-headed kid from the West,
Dink attended the Olympic try
outs in the high jump, but his j
jumping didn't suit the officials, who i
barred his style. But Dink would
not be licked. Determined to go to j
Antwerp, he entered the broad
jump. In the tryouts he took one
leap, and turned the trick.
Hamilton was competing in the â– 
decathlon then at the University of |
Missouri, where he was a sopho- j
more. His specialty was the pole j
vault. lie had little trouble in the
tryouts, and managed to take sec
ond place in the decathlon event.
When he was graduated from
Missouri, Brutus began teaching in
high school, where he was again
attracted to (he pits and cinders. He
put in his spare time coaching the J
school's track team. He was so suc
cessful with his high school team !
that he was recalled to Missouri
University as head track coach. I
Here he turned out two indoor and j
two outdoor championship teams.
When Hamilton started coaching j
at Cal, his main interest was'still
the decathlon. In 1932 he sent "Jar
ring Jim' Bausch to Los Angeles '
to win the decathlon and chalk up
a record point total. Glenn Cunning
ham, world-famous miler, is also j
one of Brutus' prodigies.
