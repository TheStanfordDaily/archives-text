Looking to the future while the
Big Meet is the center of interest,
no less than 30 California and Stan
ford men are in the running for
berths on the American Olympics
Expeditionary Force to Berlin this
summer.
Stanford alumni are ripest choices
for Olympics recognition. In the
weights there are Gordy Dunn,
Henri Laborde, Johnny Mottram,
and Johnny Lyman, pending his re
turn for the tryouts in New York.
Eastman Once More
Ben Eastman in the half is one of
the best bets, Norm Bright in the
5000 meters is a solid contender,
and A1 Blackmail in the 400 is not
out of the race.
From the present varsity are Hum
Smith, up against a soaring field in
the high jump; Jim Reynolds in the
shot; Phil Levy in the discus; Sam
Klopstock in the hurdles; Ray Dean
in the sprints; Chuck Nimmo in the
1500 meters.
From Berkeley among the present
varsity ranks are George Anderson,
insured sprint star; Mushy Pollock
in the 100; Archie Williams in the
400; Jim Kitte and George Mackey
in the shot; Mackey in the decath
lon; Tom Moore in the high hurdles;
and Moore and Del Fishback in the
400-meter hurdles.
Needham in Swim
Bear alumni who are contenders
are Bob Clarke, decathlon, and Ed
Waterbury in the javelin.
In the way of aquatic sports, Stan
ford has Winfield Needham, frosh
phenom, in the 1500 meters free
style; Bob Haslacher, all-conference
goalie, one of the West Coast all
stars; and any of several Card wa
ter-polo men who seek to try out in
New York.
The Bear swimmer is Jim Werson,
Coast's best breast-stroker.
Three Card fencers are still in
line for foils tryoutsâ€”Louis Latail
lade, Jerry Bowen, and A1 Snyder.
The final athlete is Leland Gale,
Bear middleweight wrestler, who
won in the tryouts at Lehigh and is
awaiting final decision.
