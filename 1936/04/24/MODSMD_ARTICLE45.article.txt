## De Witt, Hege Best Hopes For '37 Varsity 
### 
Although several promising frosh
baseball stars were discovered and
developed this year, the team as a i
whole failed to produce a consist
ently successful season.
Practice was rather disorganized
as Ernie Nevers, regular frosh
coach, was obliged to quit in the
middle of the season to take up his
football coaching duties at Lafayette I
College. Coach Jimmy Bradshaw i
took over his duties in spring quar
ter, but much valuable time had
been lost in the interim.
Walt Hege and Wally de Witt
Stanford in both hitting and pitching
roles throughout the season. Other
chuckers of promise were Lloyd
Davis, Bob Collman, and Phil Zonne. i
Jack Huebel, who was ineligible
the first of the season, supplanted
Bill Barkan and Harry Cohn behind '

the bat.
In the infield, Hege played first
base most of the time, Tony Mecia,
and Pete McArthur alternated at
second, Henry Glasser shortstopped,
and Verne Maino was at third.
Zonne, de Witt, Ed Gamier, and
Charles Hayward supplied the
punch in the outfield.
The season was climaxed when
the Cai frosh twice drubbed the
locals. A third game was scheduled,
but so many of the papooses re
ported lor football that the contest
was abandoned.
