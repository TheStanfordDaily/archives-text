# Stanford Track Men Push I.C.4-A. Drive
## Entry Urged In National Elite Affair Templeton, Tracksters In Move To Quit N.C.A.A., Collegiates for Classic 
### Warren Breed 
Once more the Stanford track
team starts its drive to go 1o the
1.C.4-A., national blue-ribbon clas
sic.
Conditions are such that in this,
the Olympics year, it seems best for
all concerned to enter this top-notch
track and field meeting to be held
in Philadelphia May 29 and 30, re
gardless of the fact that entry to the
affair was voted down last year.
The question recently arose when
trackmen, coaches, and associates
came to the realization that the Pa
cific Conference Intercollegiate meet
was not going to assume the propor
tions that it had promised earlier in
the year, and that the N.C.A.A.,
which was going to be the national
competition for the Cards this year,
was found to come the week-end
before the sectional trials for the
Olympic Games.
N.C.A.A. Dinged
Putting these simple facts together
the result is this: that going to the
N.C.A.A. would seriously endanger
chances of Stanford men to qualify
in the Western Olympics trials. The
three - day train ride from back
East to the coast would do track men
no good.
The 1.C.4-A. and the Pacific In
tercollegiates fall on the same week
end. Local authorities agree that
the former meet would be of little
importance, the latter of great sig
nificance.
Coach Dink Templeton and his
athletes and associates have drawn
up a set of reasons why Stanford
should go to the 1.C.4-A. this year.
They could be summarized into the
following "Eight Points":
Eight Cogent Points
1. Traditional — for Stanford to
enter and do well (Cardinal teams
have won it four times in the last
ten years and placed second as many
times).
2. A national meet—the only one
open to the Card schedule.
3. A blue - ribbon meet — older
standing, comprising schools of high
scholastic standing like Harvard,
Yale, Cornell, Princeton; invitational
and selective.
4. Nationally favorable publicity—
more than any other meet. A good
performance in this classic does
much to attract favorable prep
graduates to the University.
5. National competition — neces
sary to the men who will take part
in the Olympics tryouts later; expe
rience and stiff competition very
useful.
0. Reward for the athletes—after
missing on the N.C.A.A.
7. Better time for the national
competition, with no conflict with
Olympics tryouts.
8. Necessary general requirements
available—funds, good enough team
to compete successfully with the
Eastern schools, and necessary need
of big-time competition for the
Olympics,

athletes and associates have drawn
up a set of reasons why Stanford
should go to the 1.C.4-A. this year.
They could be summarized into the
following "Eight Points":
Eight Cogent Points
1. Traditional — for Stanford to
enter and do well (Cardinal teams
have won it four times in the last
ten years and placed second as many
times).
2. A national meet—the only one
open to the Card schedule.
3. A blue - ribbon meet — older
standing, comprising schools of high
scholastic standing like Harvard,
Yale, Cornell, Princeton; invitational
and selective.
4. Nationally favorable publicity—
more than any other meet. A good
performance in this classic does
much to attract favorable prep
graduates to the University.
5. National competition — neces
sary to the men who will take part
in the Olympics tryouts later; expe
rience and stiff competition very
useful.
0. Reward for the athletes—after
missing on the N.C.A.A.
7. Better time for the national
competition, with no conflict with
Olympics tryouts.
8. Necessary general requirements
available—funds, good enough team
to compete successfully with the
Eastern schools, and necessary need
of big-time competition for the
Olympics,
Once more the Stanford track
team starts its drive to go 1o the
1.C.4-A., national blue-ribbon clas
sic.
Conditions are such that in this,
the Olympics year, it seems best for
all concerned to enter this top-notch
track and field meeting to be held
in Philadelphia May 29 and 30, re
gardless of the fact that entry to the
affair was voted down last year.
The question recently arose when
trackmen, coaches, and associates
came to the realization that the Pa
cific Conference Intercollegiate meet
was not going to assume the propor
tions that it had promised earlier in
the year, and that the N.C.A.A.,
which was going to be the national
competition for the Cards this year,
was found to come the week-end
before the sectional trials for the
Olympic Games.
N.C.A.A. Dinged
Putting these simple facts together
the result is this: that going to the
N.C.A.A. would seriously endanger
chances of Stanford men to qualify
in the Western Olympics trials. The
three - day train ride from back
East to the coast would do track men
no good.
The 1.C.4-A. and the Pacific In
tercollegiates fall on the same week
end. Local authorities agree that
the former meet would be of little
importance, the latter of great sig
nificance.
