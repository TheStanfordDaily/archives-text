# Contests Begin on Lake This Afternoon at 2:00; Royalty Gives Sanction
## 
### 
The shores of Lake Lagunita, I
whose grassy slopes have been host .
to picnickers and sun bathers for !
more than a generation, will again |
feel the beat of many feet this after- |
noon when students, professors, and j
visitors mingle to witness the 1936 j
edition of the Junior Water Carni- I
val.
The program will start at 2
o'clock, with Jim Triolo as master !
of cercmonies. Barney Vierling j
and Dulce Parker, king and queen j
of the Masque Ball, are scheduled j
to appear to administer royal ap
proval, besides leading the parade '
cf floats in the royal barge.
First event will be the preliminar- j
ies in the men's canoe jousting con- I
test, after which living groups will
maneuver their floats past the
judges' stand.
The other contests, in order of
procedure, will be the men's free
style swimming race, women's free j
style race, canoe bobbing, prelim- |
inaries and finals in canoe jousting, j
tandem race, the nightgown race j
(women's), the canoe race, and the
inner tube tilt (women's).
Trophies Offered
Two silver cups will be awarded !
to the men's and women's groups j
which score the largest number of j
points in all events. Points will bo
given by the following method:
Floats in contest, seven points for j
first place, five for second, three for 1
third, one for fourth. Three points j
will be awarded for first place in j
both free style swimming races, two !
for second, one for third. All other ;
events will include three places, with !
five, three and one points given in i
descending order.
"All floats should be assembled
on the cast shore of the lake," j
Chairman Mort D'Evelyn said
yesterday. "Canoes must be kept \
out of the area between the boat
house and the first float, except
when they arc needed in the
events."
Tom Boothe and Roy Kinkelman, |
Stanford swimmers of national rec- ]
ognition, will stage a special diving |
exhibition between regular events
of the Carnival. Their stunts will be I
burlesqued by Lloyd Philip and Jack
Marietta in a comic diving skit.
A last minute change in the events
concerned the men's tandem race.
Instead of both arms and legs being (
tied together as announced Wednes
day, the pair of contestants will be
tied together only at the ankles.
