# New Theater Ends Fifteen Years' Planning
## Structure To Stand As Memorial To War Dead; Will Withstand Quakes 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Fifteen years of preparation will j
be climaxed by the erection of Stan- j
ford's campus theater, which is |
scheduled for completion by the end
of next fall quarter.
The structure began with the War
Memorial Fund, which was raised to 1
construct a memorial to the war ;
dead of the University. The final re- !
suit will be a $583,701 building which
will include classrooms, little the- ;
ater seating 150, a total capacity of i
1500, and in addition an outdoor J
amphitheater which can accommo- j
date 7500.
Twenty Years' Payment
Approximately 20 years will be
required for payment. Going toward j
expenses for the theater will be the 1
Union profits, the additional dollar i
per quarter now paid by each Stan
ford student, the original War Me
morial Fund, and the $4000 col- J
lected hy a student Theater Com- j
mittee.
The theater will be the only all j
class A structure on the campusâ€” I
that is, all steel structure and earth- j
quake proof. Lagunita and the |
library are mostly class C.
Three complete sets of plans were ;
drawn up before one was finally ac- j
cepted. Assisting on the last drafts
were Lee Simonson, scene designer i
for the Theater Guild in New York; '
Irving Pichel, RKO actor-director;
and Kenneth MacGowan, producer. I
Bronze plaques will be installed ;
in the lobby as the major memorial I
feature.
Capacity May Vary
The theater can be reduced in size |
by novel drapes to seat either 1500, |
850, or 650, with perfect visibility ;
and acoustics for each size. It can j
thus be used for assemblies, plays, !
concerts, or almost any necessary I
function.
Over 500 people could be seated on
the stage alone, according to Comp- !
troller Almon E. Roth. Two park
ing lots, each holding 300 cars, and
an entire new street 50 yards wide
have been built.
Air conditioning, dual lighting,
broad aisles, well upholstered seats,
and technical equipment rivaling
anything on the Pacific Coast are all
planned for the structure.
