# Farm Fund Started To Repay University
## 
### Dave Botsford 
"Stanford Fund," a money-raising
organization making it easy for
alumni and students to contribute to
the University, will be sponsored
next year by Stanford Associates,
Dr. Harry Reynolds, Associates
president, declared yesterday.
'"In the past," he said, "there has
been no organized method by
which alumni could help pay back
the founders for the education they
received on the Farm."
First Campaign Planned
The first campaign, directed by the
Associates, will be conducted along
three lines next year. The group will
work through trust companies and
trust officers who, they hope, will
urge wealthy Pacific Coast people to
endow the University with trust
funds.
Stanford lawyers will be con
tacted to stimulate gifts in bequests,
and class officers will appeal directly
to the alumni. The Associates will
also urge philanthropists to give
large amounts toward the Stanford
Fund.
Eastern Schools Successful
"Eastern colleges have been ex
ceptionally successful in raising
money through these funds," said
Dr. Reynolds. "The Harvard Fund,
for instance, nets about a half
million every year."
The Stanford Associates have long
been active in work beneficial to
the University. An alumni organ
ization separate from the official
Alumni Association, it contains 250
men who have become leaders in
their communities and have, Dr.
Reynolds said, passed the "sopho
moric stage" in their alumni rela
tion toward Stanford.
Sponsor Dinners
For the last two years the Asso
ciates have been "improving alumni
and public relations toward the Uni
versity." They have sponsored

j alumni dinners throughout the
United States—(Associates members
are scattered all over the country).
This year, under Associates direc
tion, illustrated brochures of Uni
j versity departments have been sent
, to interested people on the Coast
I and in the East. The brochure on
the chemistry department, "Blazing
New Trails in Chemistry," attracted
wide interest from commercial and
research chemists and important
executives.
Work with A.S.S.U.
I The Associates are in complete
t harmony with the administration,
; A.S.S.U., and the other alumni or
| ganizalions although their work,
| Dr. Reynolds emphasized, is sepa
j rate from any other group.
"These are the men," he explained,
' "who hiive at least the serious in
| terests of the University. If the Stan
j ford Fund is as financially success-
I ful as other college funds have been,
i our founders will be partially repaid
for the great interest they took in
| the youth of America."

million every year."
The Stanford Associates have long
been active in work beneficial to
the University. An alumni organ
ization separate from the official
Alumni Association, it contains 250
men who have become leaders in
their communities and have, Dr.
Reynolds said, passed the "sopho
moric stage" in their alumni rela
tion toward Stanford.
Sponsor Dinners
For the last two years the Asso
ciates have been "improving alumni
and public relations toward the Uni
versity." They have sponsored

j alumni dinners throughout the
United States—(Associates members
are scattered all over the country).
This year, under Associates direc
tion, illustrated brochures of Uni
j versity departments have been sent
, to interested people on the Coast
I and in the East. The brochure on
the chemistry department, "Blazing
New Trails in Chemistry," attracted
wide interest from commercial and
research chemists and important
executives.
Work with A.S.S.U.
I The Associates are in complete
t harmony with the administration,
; A.S.S.U., and the other alumni or
| ganizalions although their work,
| Dr. Reynolds emphasized, is sepa
j rate from any other group.
"These are the men," he explained,
' "who hiive at least the serious in
| terests of the University. If the Stan
j ford Fund is as financially success-
I ful as other college funds have been,
i our founders will be partially repaid
for the great interest they took in
| the youth of America."
"Stanford Fund," a money-raising
organization making it easy for
alumni and students to contribute to
the University, will be sponsored
next year by Stanford Associates,
Dr. Harry Reynolds, Associates
president, declared yesterday.
'"In the past," he said, "there has
been no organized method by
which alumni could help pay back
the founders for the education they
received on the Farm."
First Campaign Planned
The first campaign, directed by the
Associates, will be conducted along
three lines next year. The group will
work through trust companies and
trust officers who, they hope, will
urge wealthy Pacific Coast people to
endow the University with trust
funds.
Stanford lawyers will be con
tacted to stimulate gifts in bequests,
and class officers will appeal directly
to the alumni. The Associates will
also urge philanthropists to give
large amounts toward the Stanford
Fund.
Eastern Schools Successful
"Eastern colleges have been ex
ceptionally successful in raising
money through these funds," said
Dr. Reynolds. "The Harvard Fund,
for instance, nets about a half
million every year."
