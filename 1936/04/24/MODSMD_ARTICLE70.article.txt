# Theater Group Plans Complete
## Gift Makes Amphitheater Building Possible 
### 
The ouldoor auditorium, which
with the new theater will form the
nucleus of Stanford's contemplated
"Arts Group" as conceived by
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, is rap
idly becoming a reality as prelim
inary earthwork progresses and
plans near completion.
The amphitheater is made pos
sible at the present time largely
through the gift presented by Mr.
Frost of Los Angeles in commemo
ration of his son. John Lawrence
Frost, member of the Class of '35,
who died in Italy a short time ago
while enrolled at Stanford. The gift
of $35,000 is being applied to gen
eral construction and landscaping
for the outdoor auditorium.
Located in the same block with the
new theater, between Lasuen and
Galvez Street, the outdoor pavilion
will consist of a large earth-walled
bowl, accommodating 7500 persons,
encircled by a grove of native
trees.
Arizona has the largest yellow
pine forest in the United States.
