# New Rough Is Chip Off Old Block: Padre
## He's Smoother, But Has Same Stanford Spirit 
### Bob Eisenbach 
Have Stanford students < hanged
in 38 years? Are they smarUr or
dumber, naughtier or nicer, more or
less sophisticated than they were
when Mrs. Stanford imported mar
ble statues for the chapel and
Herbert Hoover was a mining en
gineer trying to get along?
We put the question to the Padre.
(For non-initiates, we add that he is
the Rev. D. Charles Gardner, D.D.,
as much a part of Stanford as ihe
church in which he preaches Sun
days and the vestry where he hears
of week-end escapades on Mon
days.)
A little sentimental, still regard
ing Stanford and its troubles sub
jectively, Padre stacks those ol the
present generation in the same pile
with those of the old. Why? Because
they're fundamentally the same
breed of animal, he believes, though
iheir essential nature is today ob
scured by a crusting of sophistica
tion and social gee-gaws.
Fundamentally the Same
"They're smarter, better dressed,
more polished, perhaps younger, but
they're impelled by a variable oJ the
same generosity and sweetness that
chax*actei ized the prehistoric rough,"
Padre declared. "Take the Convales
cent Drive; students will work thoir
heads off today just as they did 20
years ago. You may think them ir
religious, but the spirit of devotion
they show in the Baccalaureate
Service belies their glossy finish."
Padre is quick to admit that the
rough as popularly pictured has
vanished from the Farm. But he
steadfastly maintains the metamor
phosis is a superficial oneâ€”that the
butterfly is still essentially moth.
Product of Prosperity
Although he is a sentimentalist
from way back, Dr. Gardner has a
materialistic conception of Stan
ford's history.
In 1840 there were three cities in
California, he explains, and the re
gion's chief industry was hides and
tallow. When Stanford opened, the

state was feeling just the spray of
expansion's tidal wave that is today
| sweeping it on to prosperity like a
surf-board rider is swept toward
shore. The ancient and honorable
rough was a product of early hard
ship. and the sternness that was
struggle. Padre believes.
j "But because the modern student
' wears cream-puff flannels, shaves
every day, and comports and dis
ports himself with knowing discre
tion," he vehemently continues, "is
no indication of a basic change in
1 make-up. Like glittering cellophane,
he is basically a rough tree trans
formed by the catalyst of intelli
gence and wealth."
