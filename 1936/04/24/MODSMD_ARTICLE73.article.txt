# "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" What is it That Will Bring 400 Alumni Back to the Farm for "University Day"? 
### 
They don't call it "Homecoming" as most
colleges do. Tomorrow is "University Day"
on the Farm.
No one is trying to fool the three or four
hundred returning grads that they have
"come home." The University isn't their home
any more but il is still their university. On
that premise that "their university" still
means something to them the alumni are
asked to come back to the Farm for a day,
and the invitation assumes that they should
want to accept.
The fact that today is also I Meet day is
neither a coincidence nor an indication that a
special event was necessarily needed to gel
the alums out. The alumni olliec, which spon
sors the whole thing, doesn't merely want to
impress progress on the former students by
showing them the new .buildings; it wants to
let them see the students and their activities
in action.
lint just why does the I Diversity want the
grads to visit the campus even il for but a
day?
Is it to put the bee on them to pay their
alumni dues or shell out money lor some
scholarship or pet fund? Is il lo instill pride

• by showing oil' a larger and in many ways a
better university? Is it to impress upon them
the fact that "Stanford expects every grad to
do his duty" in recruiting desirable under
graduates? Or does the University merely
want to give old class-mates a chance for a
friendly reunion?
"University Day" is, in part at least, a
composite of ;ill these reasons. What is more
important are the reasons why the alumni
come.
For those who are here with ;i fat pocket
book attention is called to the newly created
"Stanford Funds" an endowment proposi
tion into which donations will be put accord
ing to class years.
| For those who wish to see a larger and bet
ter University, attention is called to Lagunita
Court, the New Theater foundations, Toyon,
iiranner, the women's gym, and to the new
division of industrial relations to be estab
lished in the graduate school of business.
And for those who came to reminisce and
talk over old times, attention is called to the
class reunions and to a score or more pro
i lessors whose term of service has made their
I names institutional.

the alums out. The alumni olliec, which spon
sors the whole thing, doesn't merely want to
impress progress on the former students by
showing them the new .buildings; it wants to
let them see the students and their activities
in action.
lint just why does the I Diversity want the
grads to visit the campus even il for but a
day?
Is it to put the bee on them to pay their
alumni dues or shell out money lor some
scholarship or pet fund? Is il lo instill pride

• by showing oil' a larger and in many ways a
better university? Is it to impress upon them
the fact that "Stanford expects every grad to
do his duty" in recruiting desirable under
graduates? Or does the University merely
want to give old class-mates a chance for a
friendly reunion?
"University Day" is, in part at least, a
composite of ;ill these reasons. What is more
important are the reasons why the alumni
come.
For those who are here with ;i fat pocket
book attention is called to the newly created
"Stanford Funds" an endowment proposi
tion into which donations will be put accord
ing to class years.
| For those who wish to see a larger and bet
ter University, attention is called to Lagunita
Court, the New Theater foundations, Toyon,
iiranner, the women's gym, and to the new
division of industrial relations to be estab
lished in the graduate school of business.
And for those who came to reminisce and
talk over old times, attention is called to the
class reunions and to a score or more pro
i lessors whose term of service has made their
I names institutional.
They don't call it "Homecoming" as most
colleges do. Tomorrow is "University Day"
on the Farm.
No one is trying to fool the three or four
hundred returning grads that they have
"come home." The University isn't their home
any more but il is still their university. On
that premise that "their university" still
means something to them the alumni are
asked to come back to the Farm for a day,
and the invitation assumes that they should
want to accept.
The fact that today is also I Meet day is
neither a coincidence nor an indication that a
special event was necessarily needed to gel
the alums out. The alumni olliec, which spon
sors the whole thing, doesn't merely want to
impress progress on the former students by
showing them the new .buildings; it wants to
let them see the students and their activities
in action.
