# It's 80,000 People Smaller But Actually Just as Big

The gales <>l Stanford Stadium capacity:
90,000 will swing open tomorrow and an es
timated throng of Irom 10,000 to IT),000 will
liller in and crowd around the finish of the
100-yard dash as Indian meets Hear in dual
track competition.
To Stanford and California citizenry to
morrow is Big Day No. 2.
On Big Day No. 1, the Stadium capacity:
90,000 usually is jammed. But that is for
football, the spectacle sport. A "handful" of
10,0011, however, can he classed as "a record
crowd" for a track meet.
There is no use denying the fact that the
Big Meet will always he "small fry" as com
pared to the Big (lame. Football season car
ries too much glamor, 100 much ballyhoo, and
100 much plain hysteria.
Track will always remain the participant
sport. It is more or less an indivdual compe
tition event, and the public lias not been edu
cated to thrill to a race as it does to a long
touchdown run or pass.
II is because Stanford regards track as a
participant sport that more than *2 1,000 was
spent in rebuilding Angell Field, now "the
lines! track plant in America." This plant,
in fact, is used almost solely for practiceâ€”so
slight is the attempt to play up track to the
spectator.
But Big Day No. 2, with its crowd of 10,000,
is certainly on an athletic par with Big Day
No. 1 drawing power, 90,000. There is less
hysterical glamor, a few less column inches in
the sport pages, HO,OOO fewer people in at
tendance; but there is just as much hard,
clean, and skillful combat, and nearly as
much popular reputation at stake.
