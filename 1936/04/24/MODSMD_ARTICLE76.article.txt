## College Propaganda

(From tiie Michigan Slate News)
Colleges are now developing a race of "yes men,"
Dr. Glenn Frank, president of the University of Wis
consin, declared last week at the schoolmen's week
program at the University of Pennsylvania. Accord
ing to Doctor Frank, the colleges are being unduly
influenced by agencies of the right and left.
In Russia, Italy, and Germany, said the educator,
the authoritarian social order has imposed its pattern
upon the schools. Americans consider this enslave
ment dangerous, but American agencies are demanding
the same sort of training in their own schools.
On one side we have fascism, advocating one plan
for social health. On the other we have communism.
American democracy is neither.

The survival of American democracy, he said, de
pends on training for leadership and popular under
standing. This meant, he added, that schools must
concern themselves not only with the "old truth" but
must also "blaze new trails into the future." They must
realize that the many should think as well as feel
politically.
Doctor Frank, apparently, is hitting at the popular
tendency to "rubber stamp" the undergraduate. Col
lege men are bring taught how to act, not how to think.
It is interesting to note how students in different
colleges follow the popular leader, how uniform are
'heit philosophies. At many eastern colleges it is
fashionable to oppose capitalism, to strike with ihe
workers and help them picket. At colleges in the
west it is fashionable to oppose radicals with violence
on the grounds that they are undermining the Amer
ican ideal.
They all agree in the individual colleges; conse
quently, they emerge with stereotyped attitudes. It
would be much more wholesome if they fought, it out
among themselves during their undergraduate days,
unhampered by the dictates of their faculties, and
finally arrived at a happy medium of thought.
