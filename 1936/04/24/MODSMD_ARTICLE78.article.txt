Swing your sweetie
To Tahiti.
Swing your snootie
Tutti-fruiti.
Swing her blotto
In the Franich grotto.
Tried to swing sweetie but sweetie wouldn't swing.
Twing your sweetie
To Tahiti.
Swing Polynesians.;
Make foreign lesions.
Swing your pretty
To a ditty.
But if you swing to me only with thine eyes.
I'll swing you around to swat the flies.
Tried to swing sweetie, but sweetie wouldn't swing.

Sorry sister, I can't swing it this time.
It is said that there is an Alpha Delt house on this
campus. And there is a fine, old story going around
about the youths in this house. During the height of
the King and Queen Contest, first the* Thetas, then
the Pi Phis, then the Kappas came around to ask the
boys to contribute to the respective candidates.^
The brothers looked upon the excitement as a mere
sociological manifestation of the cosmis, collective in
feriority complex, and took it all with a great deal of
tranquility.
They gave a dollar to the Kappas, a dollar to the
Thetas and nothing to the Pi Phis, because they had a
grudge against them, induced by a certain experience
when one of their bandy-legged pledges tried to
wheedle some money out of a cynical sophomore.
The freshman appealed to Home, to Family, to Country,
to Honor, and to the Unearned Increment, but the
sophomore insisted upon looking at the afTair as a
sociological manifestation.
Just to m;ike their position more emphatic on the
subject, however, the brothers banded together, spread
some wild story about going up to Bay Meadows,
winning $200 bucks, find planning to put it on some
candidate. All afternoon the supplicants came to
(lie Alpha Delt house, but the brothers would not
fiivulge what they were going to do with the money.
Finally they hinted, that ihey were throwing it to
the Thetas, and went down to the boolh during the
closed bidding and deposited the dough with a great
air of secrecy.
The envelope contained four-bits for "Raw Meat,"
the Alpha Delt. pony.
The Pi Phis, the Kappas, the Tri-Delts are not
speaking to Alpha Delts these days.

It is said that there is an Alpha Delt house on this
campus. And there is a fine, old story going around
about the youths in this house. During the height of
the King and Queen Contest, first the* Thetas, then
the Pi Phis, then the Kappas came around to ask the
boys to contribute to the respective candidates.^
The brothers looked upon the excitement as a mere
sociological manifestation of the cosmis, collective in
feriority complex, and took it all with a great deal of
tranquility.
They gave a dollar to the Kappas, a dollar to the
Thetas and nothing to the Pi Phis, because they had a
grudge against them, induced by a certain experience
when one of their bandy-legged pledges tried to
wheedle some money out of a cynical sophomore.
The freshman appealed to Home, to Family, to Country,
to Honor, and to the Unearned Increment, but the
sophomore insisted upon looking at the afTair as a
sociological manifestation.
Just to m;ike their position more emphatic on the
subject, however, the brothers banded together, spread
some wild story about going up to Bay Meadows,
winning $200 bucks, find planning to put it on some
candidate. All afternoon the supplicants came to
(lie Alpha Delt house, but the brothers would not
fiivulge what they were going to do with the money.
Finally they hinted, that ihey were throwing it to
the Thetas, and went down to the boolh during the
closed bidding and deposited the dough with a great
air of secrecy.
