# Plot Slow, Stars Save "Thirteen Hours By Air"
## 
### 
THIRTEEN HOURS BY AIR, and
|it seems like hours in the show.
: The action is slow and the plot is
i even slower. Fred Mac-Murray plays
I his usual manly type of role, but he
is still good at it, and backed by the
very lovely Joan Bennett he is even
better. Zasu Pitts and "Sir Walde
mere Pitt" did darn well in the
humor roles.
A cocky ladies' man mail-pilot
(Mac Murray) with one of those
I never-fail records is flying his way
through a snow storm in an effort to
get his love-to-be to San Francisco
I in time to save her sister from mar
rying a dirty Russian. The snow
forces them down, and aboard the
plane a detective, a brat, a stupid
woman, the Russian's brother, and
a killer, cause a lot of complications
plus a couple of murders.
Mac Murray's list solves the com
plications and the brat turns true
blue and his squirt gun prevents
any more murders. Not much of a
plot, but it's a good show and ends
happily.
If you can imagine Irish Indians,
a jerky film, a lousy Western thrill
er which doesn't thrill, and an in
congruous plot starring a feminine
he-man with a grating voice, then
you are thinking of THE SINGING
VAGABOND starring Gene Autry.
