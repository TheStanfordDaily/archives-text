# JOHNNY COMES HOME
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A little ditty composed for our
Veterans of Future Wars to the
, tune of "When Johnny Comes
Marching Home Again." Apropos,
j what?
When Johnny goes off to war again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a noble send-off then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Standard Oil we'll all turn out
For J. P. Morgan we'll raise a shout
And we'll all feel proud
) When Johnny goes off to war.
When Johnny does not come back
again
Alas! Alas!
We will feel a little sadder then
Alas! Alas!
When they lead us off to kill once
more
j Will we flock like sheep to "end all
war"
Will we go off to fight another war?
D. S. Bryant
