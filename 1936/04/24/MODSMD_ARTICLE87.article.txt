## PARDON US, INTREPID 21 
### 
Don't be too critical of us, you I
i
titans of the good old days . . . you,
Howard Avery, and Arthur L. Mil
ler, and Donald Kropp and Eric
Hill—you immortal gents who made
history six years ago.
We'll never forget you're risking
your necks to recover the axe from ;

Cal April 3, 1930.
Just think of the
care we've given
it: it's been park
ed in a pretty
glass case in the
Union Cellar.
We've shown it
proudly at Big
Game rallies.
We've painted ill
and plated it and|
mounted it on a
special board with
engraved names

and dates. We've made it a spoil
of the Big Game.
And yesterday we lent it to Cal
for their rally.
What's that you say, Mr. Avery?
Now you shouldn't swear on Quad.
Hey, Mr. Miller, we're not either
sissies!
Gee, fellows, we thought you'd
like our pretty gesture to Cal. It was I
all legal; we got the axe back, didn't j
we?
What's that? You say you wish
Cal had kept it and punched us in
the puss? What's the matter with
you Mr. Avery—we're trying to be
friends with Cal. Sure you fellows
did a great job, but there's no reason
Cal and the Farm shouldn't be pals.
I Heck, it's a lot more convenient not !
to scrap.
I What's the matter, Mr. Avery?
, You look sick. Better go to the Ad

I Building and lie down.
You say it isn't like the good old
days? No, Mr. Miller, so we've been
told. Now look, you worried about
the axe, O.K. Now we've got wor
-1 lies, too, like the Masque Ball and
who's going to buy her way to the
queenship.
Sure, we don't mess around fight
ing with Cal. We take things easy.
! Sure, we admit it!
j Did you mumble something about
I traditions, Mr. Kropp? Oh, you
! mean like smoking on the Quad,
huh?
. . . Gosh, what's the matter with
Mr. Miller? Is he getting a stroke, do
you 'spose? You go to the 8.A.C.,
i Mr. Miller, and get glanced at . . .
* + *
I guess he didn't realize how much
the Farm's changed. Yeh, he knows
now awright. You must realize, Mr.
Kropp, that we have to watch our
step, what with 1000 women. Can't
do wild things any more. Naw. And
fighting about the axe—well, that's
j an awful lot of trouble over just an
axe, now isn't it? You see, we want
to be successes in life, and that
means being dressed just so and
having the right vocabulary.
Oops, Mr. Kropp! Say, this sun's
| pretty hot. You just go and sit in
j the Chapel for a while.
* *
\eh, Mr. Hill? Oh, the axe . . .
well now, that axe is O.K. We had
:it protected with signed agree
ments. A couple of Cal fellows said
i they'd take good care of it. What's
that . . . they're pansies too? . . .
j Say, you're a pretty tough egg.
' Kow come they let you in. Boy,
they had no standards at all in your
day . . .
Hey, Mr. Hill! Mr. Hill!
Gosh, I'd better get Doc Storey.
