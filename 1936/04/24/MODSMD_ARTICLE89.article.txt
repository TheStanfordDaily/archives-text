# Stanford Nine To Play Cal Tomorrow
## Last Conference Game Of Season; Indians Ready To Avenge Early Losses 
### Dale Reimer 
Card baseballers tomorrow after
noon will attempt to gain some
measure of revenge for two defeats
at the hands of the California var
sity when they clash with the Bears
in the final game of the series and
the last conference encounter. The
game will begin immediately after
the Big Meet.
Although the Cal nine won both
of the previous contests played in
Berkeley, the Indians are hoping to
reverse the decision on their home
field.
Weiershauser to I'itch
Coach Harry Wolter's pitching
choice for the final game probably
will be Ray Weiershauser, mainstay
of the staff all season, who was un
lucky to lose his first start against
the Bears. If Leon Heagerty over
comes the ankle injury received in
practice this week, he will start be
hind the bat. Otherwise, Mike
Ferro will catch.
The same infield which played
most of the conference games will
be on hand tomorrow with the pos
sible exception of Bill Newsom, who
injured his foot sliding into second
base in the game against Cal Aggies
Wednesday.
Right Field Undecided
Wolter is undecided as to who
will start in right field but intends
to use Ed Clark and Bob Matthews
in the other two outfield spots.
Choice for the other post rests be
tween Captain Bones Hamilton, Tom
Killefer, and Verne Johnson. Should
Charles (Lefty) Hardt, star Bear
portsider, start, it is expected that
one of the Hamiltons, both right
handed hitters, will be in the out
field.
