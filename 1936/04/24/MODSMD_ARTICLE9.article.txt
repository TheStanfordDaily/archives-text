# Bear Rooters Rally 'Round Stanford Axe
## 
### 
When followers of the Blue and
Gold jam tile Berkeley Greek the
ater tonight for their prc-Big Meet
rally, a few thousand blood-pres
sures will rise at the sight of the
famous Stanford Axe.
For this was the Axe which
California held as a spoil of war
for 31 years, then lost to Sequoia
roughs as the result of the most
liigh - powered hoodwinking in
Stanford-Cal history.
Since tlyd memorable April
night in 1930, the Axe has peace
fully rested in the Union Cellar.
This week, though, Wally Brooke
approved their request and lent it
to the Bears for their mass Big
Meet rally.
