### 
Dink Templeton, his back to the
i wall and a comfortable divan in his
home at the end of Lasuen Avenue,
| came out with a bit of the old "boy
I coaeh" enthusiasm and optimism and
picked his track team to whitewash
Cal 79 to 52.
He wanted to make it plain that
he was not basing this latest dope
i sheet on past meet performances,
! but what he thought was going to
j transpire here at the Stadium tomor-
I row afternoon.
While expressing regret at the
| long injured list dogging the Bears,
; he said that he thought that this was
J his year and he had picked his boys
all along to win.
It will depend on how the boys
like Nimmo, Myers, and Dellinger
feel tomorrow afternoon as to what
[ races they'll run.
Here is the Templeton "scoop"

j wind in the Red sails in a Redder

Dink Templeton, his back to the
i wall and a comfortable divan in his
home at the end of Lasuen Avenue,
| came out with a bit of the old "boy
I coaeh" enthusiasm and optimism and
picked his track team to whitewash
Cal 79 to 52.
He wanted to make it plain that
he was not basing this latest dope
i sheet on past meet performances,
! but what he thought was going to
j transpire here at the Stadium tomor-
I row afternoon.
While expressing regret at the
| long injured list dogging the Bears,
; he said that he thought that this was
J his year and he had picked his boys
all along to win.
It will depend on how the boys
like Nimmo, Myers, and Dellinger
feel tomorrow afternoon as to what
[ races they'll run.
Here is the Templeton "scoop"
| dope sheet, which puts plenty of
j wind in the Red sails in a Redder
sunset.
