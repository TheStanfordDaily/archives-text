A1 Jolson, Mr. Ilyde, Little Lotus
Flower, Ilarpo Marx, Admiral
B.yrd, Grand Duke Nicholas,
Fletcher Christian and scores of
his island beauties—they were all
in "Tahiti" Friday night and it
was some party.
The 1936 Masque Ball, ruled by
the $4000 royal couple, Dulcc
Parker and Barney Vierling, was
financially and entertainingly the
most successful hall yet thrown
together by a Convalescent Home
Drive Committee.
The evening netted over $500
clear profit for the Home young
sters and more than 100 bids were
sold at the door—a record.
To most of the Tahiti-mound
dancers the affair ended with a
Saturday morning headache. To
Aline Goldstein and Boh Zeimer
it didn't—as door prize they won
"a week-end for two at Del
Monte."
