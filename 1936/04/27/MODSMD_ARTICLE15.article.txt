## 
### 
Hundreds of Stanford students
each summer find jobs to earn
money or to keep busy. In little
more than a month summer will
have arrived —with or without a job.
To help students line up the sum
mer's work is Mrs. Irene Coverley's
Student Employment Bureau's prin
cipal activity right now.
"Every fellow who really wants a
job and tries intelligently to get
one, will, despite depression or any
thing else," Mrs. Coverley said Sat
urday. She emphasized the follow
ing 14 things to remember when ap
plying for work:
1. Arrange for a definite inter
view with the employer. (The Bu
reau supplies this service.)
2. Carry some sort of credential
or letter of identification describing
your qualifications. (The Bureau
supplies these in some cases.)
3. Never try to see an employer
I just before lunch or closing time.
4. Don't say "I'll do anything"—
j the employer wants your special in
j tcrest or aptitude.
5. Know beforehand exactly what
you wish to say and say it in the
| gush.

(>. Never claim experience you
have not had. He ordinarily doesn't
expect you to be an expert, but
wants an honest estimate of your
limitations.
7. If you know there's a vaeansy,
be sure your credentials assert yoiTV
1 ability along that line.
8. Girls, the less make-up, the
fewer frills—the better.
J). 13c polite. Don't put your feet
on chairs or otherwise display un
couthness.
10. Don't take it for granted that
your man smokes—don't blow fumes
in his face.
11. Display intelligent interest,
sympathy, and curiosity toward the
work in question; your prospective
employer is at. once on your side.
12. Be direct. Don't use slang or
beat around the bush.
j 13. Neatness and cleanliness
counts. Watch especially hair, fin
gernails. hands, and face.
14. "Big talk" never gets you any
place. Don't refer to acquaintances
with prominent persons. If you
i really know any, gi>t a card or letter
of recommendation.
