# Tempest In Farm Teapot Steams Prexy
## Brooke Favors Cleanup In Campus Political Setup; Report Due Tomorrow 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Flattered that someone, even if a
group of sophomore ward heelers,
were taking an actual interest in stu
dent politics, A.S.S.U. President
Wally Brooke said last night, "I've
no objection to the sophomore ma
chine, if they'll take enough inter
est to nominate good candidates."
But Brooke doubted that the ma
chine could know who the best
nominees would be.
Committee Reports
Brooke's statement was made in
regard to the political stew that will
be stirred by the Ex Committee
subcommittee when it delivers its
teapot report on the campus polit
ical tempests to Ex Committee to
morrow night.
The committee was appointed to
see if the present Hall-Row split is
inevitable, to investigate pressure
group nomination In Hall and Row
cauc-ied cauci, and to get to the
bottom of the alleged sophomore
nominating ring.
Reliable sources indicate that it
was organized to get jobs for sopho
mores in class officerships, and to
elect the sophomore representative
on Ex Committee.
Little Glory Left
The few individuals who hang
around to see Ex Committee swing
from ring to ring in its Tuesday
evening circus remember the fare
wells of oldsters Bill Rogers and
Frank Fullenwider, who both point
ed out that campus officers elected
by the people are mainly stuffed
shirts who are chosen because they
care enough about the meagre per
sonal glory and wisps of minor gravy
that come to a stuffed shirt to or
ganize votes behind themselves.
The inference was that campus
politics, devoted to campus futility
and sterility, did not harm anyone,
that as long as they appealed to per
sonal ego-mania, and required or
ganization for that gratification, that
they would appeal only to glory
conscious groups.
If there were any issues, they
reasoned, the sleepy giants of the
halls might awake, that a general
student body interest might wrest
away pressure-group control.
Until that time, the Ex Commit
tee sub-committee has to figure out
how it can devise a system to keep
the pressure groups from being pres
sure groups, or manipulate them so
that artificial respiration may apply
the proper pressure to the "proper"
candidate.
