# Card Track Men Take Ten Firsts In Big Meet Win
## Levy Breaks Krenz's Meet Discus Record; Nimmo, Madlem, Reynolds Star 
### Phil Klauber 
As in all Big Meets, the unexpect
ed come-throughs proved to be the
margin of victory Saturday when
Dink Templeton's Stanford track
sters took Brutus Hamilton's deter
mined Golden Bear team down the
line by a 75%-55% score.
Just when bad talk had begun to
hum behind their backs for dog
ging it, Ray Dean and Sam Klop
stock, Little Champions if ever
there were such, took their early
races which were practically a cinch
for California on the dope sheets, set
the Bears far enough behuid to
cause them to press, and put Stan
ford into a lead that the Cards
never lost.
Madlem New Broad Jump Find
But it wasn't as easy ;is the score
sounds; without some other un
expected performances Stanford
would still be in a bad way. Leo
Madlem is the one. With but one
workout this season, and with three
days of bronchitis behind him, Mad
lem, an old broad jumper, came out
and won his event v/ith a leap of
23-s'a, set some more dopesters
down on their heels, and set him
self up as a possible coming inter
mission in a long, long dearth of
Stanford winning broad-jumpers.
With all proper condolences to in
valid Bears Bob Fowler, Dick
Brace, and Bob Heavey, the Cardinal
long distance corps was the strongest
in the field. The mile was 9-0 for
Stanford, with Chuck Nimmo, War
ren Dixon, and Bob Alexander run
ning a race for points, at 4:25.7. And
then the 2-mile, with both Ed Bur
rows and a Nimmo that reminds of
the '33 and '34 seasons, in ahead of
Cal's Les Voorhees in a stirring
finish for one-two.
The half-mile was the only other
sweep of the day, with McCurdy,
Malott, and Burris all finishing
ahead of the first blueshirt, winning
time of 1:57.2, Mac, with one more
year, is really going to have a
career.
Levy, Williams Sel Marks
Archie Williams of Cal tied Bud
Spencer's Big Meet quarter-mile
record with a :48 fiat race, while
Phil Levy had five fair discus
throws over 159, and a top of 162-1%
for his best ever and the only Big
Meet record set Saturday. Williams
later won the 220 in 21.8 to become
the day's-only double winner; Levy's
throw bested the former mark set
by the late Eric Krenz in 1930 by
two inches.
Jim Reynolds continued as the
most dependable man on the Stan
ford squad by winning the shot at:
51-6.
