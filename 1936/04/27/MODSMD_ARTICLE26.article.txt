### Gray Creveling 
IF YOU DIDN'T already know it,
you wouldn't be long in guessing
that the mayor of San Francisco is
a florist.
The majestic city hall entrance
and foyer has almost too many
boxed palm trees situated under
arches and at other artistically stra
tegic positions. The scores of palms
make the inside of the building look
like a south-sea movie set. During
last week's mayors' conclave, the
huge stairway leading up to the sec
ond floor was a mass of flora. Huge
rhododendron trees lined the stair
case and the entire building smelled
like a columbarium. The cigar and
cigarette smoke from the two press
rooms had little chance to overcome
the aroma of so many flowering
trees.

Mayor Rossi's office has two of
these gigantic trees on either side of
the chief executive's desk. Two of
the largest Easter lily plants in ex
istence are also in the room and
they grace a huge flat top table
across from the mayor's desk. Wait
ing to see the mayor is like waiting
for a funeral. The heavy aroma of
(lowers plus the beauty and natural
dignity of the office could make you
think of little else.

MAYOR ROSSI, himself, is a
.small, bald man who treats the re
porters as confidants and is positive
of their friendship and good will in
a pinch. He wears a morning suit
and is strictly formal at all times in
his attire. Although possessive of
all the charm of a polished politi
cian, he does not outdo his secretary,
Malcolm Frazer, when it comes to
remembering people's names and
making everyone he meets feel like
a million dollars.
The mayor has an impish negro
flunkey who is forever running
about clipping dead blossoms from
the many plants in the office, keep
ing the furniture dusted off and per
sonally attending to the mayor's
every sartorial desire. He "doesn't
know anything." Reporters have no
luck in finding out from him "who
that big politician is in there with
the mayor" or "When'll he be back?"
or anything, for that matter.

THERE ARE REASONS which
indicate that Governor Alfred Lan
don is not as "available" for the Re
publican nomination as some people
might think.
G.O.P. big shots may do all in
their power to prick his boom bubble
and prevent his nomination because
he is too vulnerable as opponent for
Roosevelt. Hearst's billing and coo
ing with Landon and Landon's ap
parent acceptance of the advances
are frowned upon. Landon's career
a.s an independent oil producer and
operator leaves him wide open to
charges of being a candidate of the
oil industry, and charges that his
campaign is being financed by oil
barons. The charges will of course
come from the Democratic national
committee, so Republican leaders
believe. Landon has denied the im
plications, but if he had to go
through his entire campaign deny
ing things, the Republican drive
would be turned into a defensive
campaign and that's the last thing
the leaders want.
Landon is a dry, and the wet East
could be easily made to believe that
Kansas drys, already organizing a
campaign to once more realize na
tional prohibition, would have suf
ficient power with one of their
members in the White House to
take away the personal liberties re
tored to Americans on the repeal of
the 18th amendment.

WELL, IF the big shots don't
want Landon, who do they want?
Answer: Lester J. Dickinson, Re
publican senator from lowa.
Dickinson is a thoroughgoing re
actionary, with a constant record of
vehement opposition to the New
Deal's expensive programs. Long
experienced in national affairs,
Dickinson is oratorically able — a
rabble-rouser of the first water—
