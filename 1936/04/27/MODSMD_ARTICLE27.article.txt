. TRENTON, N.J., April 26 (TPl.—
New Jersey's militant unemployed,

I provided relief funds, sat with
bowed heads today while a Trenton
clergyman prayed they be given
! "power and strength to carry on
without rest their fight for justice
i and right."
In the otherwise empty State
House, where they eat and sleep, the
i tattered band of jobless held church
i services today—the first many of
[ them hud attended in years. For a

chamber.
I This group, termed "uninvited
squatters" yesterday by an Assem
blyman who urged Governor Hoff
man to call the state police to oust
them, heard Mr. Smith read the
story of the good Samaritan.
