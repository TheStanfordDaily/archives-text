# BUDGE DROPS TILT
## 
### 
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS,
W.Va., April 26 (/P>.—Bryan (Bitsy)
Grant, Atlanta, Ga„ dropped the
first two sets today, but came back
brilliantly to defeat Donald Budge,
Oakland, Calif., and win the Mason
Dixon tennis championship. The
score: 2-6. 4-6. 6-3, 6-0, 6-4.
and not an unimpassioned reader of
platitudes like Landon.

WELL, the fun will soon begin
and no one knows who will be the
lucky groom to join the Republican
pachyderm in the bonds of holy
nomination.
