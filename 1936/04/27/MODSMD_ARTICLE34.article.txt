# Frosh Downed By Cal Cubs 55-76 In Little Big Meet
## Captain Thompson Takes 100,220; Carew Second; Hawkins Wins Hurdles 
### Tim Sullivan 
California freshmen showed them
selves inconsiderate hosts as they
sent their guests, the Stanford year
lines, back to Palo Alto with only
55 points, selfishly having garnered
70 for themselves at the Little Big
Meet in Berkeley Friday.
When the Indian Babes scored,
however, they went on a spree.
Prize for pulling the unexpected
went to Hoy Thompson, Papoose
captain, who blazed to victory in
both 100 and 220-yard dashes. Dick
Carew, also of the Farm, copped a
pair of seconds in the same races.
Times were 10 and 22 flat, respec
tively.
Win Both Hurdles
Bill Hawkins skimmed smoothly
to a win in the high hurdles and re
peated the performance later in the
low timbers. Dick Bale .was a split
horse hair behind the "hawk" in the
latter race, and also nabbed a third
in the highs.
After slamming the shot past the
41-foot mark to insure himself of
first place in that event, Pete Zagar
wandered over to the discus ring
and sent the Little Big Meet discus
record spinning into oblivion. His
throw of 151 feet 7 inches bettered
the old mark by more than five
feet.
Too Many Rivals
John Emmanuel, Stanford's lone
long distance runner, pitted himself
against five Bear Cubs in the two
mile, and beat four of 'em, only to
have the remaining Cub out-claw
him on the home stretch. Leo Feder
picked up a point for the local lads
in the mile, as did Wilson Slater in
the 440.
Spear-slinging Bill Brownton
pierced the turf 180 feet out to take
the javelin for the Indians, and Jack
Siefert threw himself over the bar at
fi feet in the high jump, to gain a tie
with Cal's Canning. Elliot Hillback's
third in the discus completed the
scoring on Stanford's part.
California Collects
Pole vault, 880, broad jump, and
relay were all California clean-ups.
Steve Taggart of the Farm crew had
particular misfortune, losing out in
the broad jump with a leap that
would have placed in varsity com
petition.
