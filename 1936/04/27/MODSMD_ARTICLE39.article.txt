## BIG MEET THROUGH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES 
### 
THE COME THROUGH BOYS:
Leo Madlem, with a form all his
own, plunging into the sand to sur
prise the myriad Bear leapers, but
not himself . . . Ray Dean, doing
what a few thought he might, lick
the Cal mite Mushy Pollock after
little Morris led three yards at the
25-yard line . . . Sam Klopstock—
well, just imagine the race he ran,
doing 14.7 on the wind-swept
straightaway that saw Dean beat
Pollock in the novice time of 10.1
. . . Jim Reynolds, coupling canny
psychology and a tremendous heave
on his first put to completely tic
up his two Cal foes, keeping them
below 50 feet . . . Chuck Nimmo, just
wanning up in the mile and trim
ming Voorhees handily in a come
back two-mile. Smiling James
Kneubuhl, glissing through for a
second and third in the sprints, up
setting friend Dean and Cal's Helmer
in the furlong. Some say Jimmy
might have won that 100.
MORSELS: Truck Dellinger's
lowdown "guts" sprint finish in his
relap lap after reclining lame on the
trainer's table most of the week . . .
GifT Myers, the "second-a-day boy,"
loping through his lap at 50 fiat,
with his feet touching the ground
about a dozen times the whole
quarter . . . Ed Burrows looking
dead on the middle laps, as usual,
then showing a convincing sprint to
cop the two-mile . . . Phil Levy
anxiously measuring his mark in
the discus with two large track
shoes to see if ho had busted Eric
Krenz' record . . . The happy Rey
nolds spiriting himself about the
field, the first to congratulate each
of the come-through shots . . . Bur
rows and Bob Fowler, the ailing Cal
captain and two-miler, exchanging
shafts of wit each time the two
milers came around to where Bob
was sitting and snapping pictures.
Dink almost ruining his straw hat
when Hank Luisetti was trying at a
height that would have won the
event . . . And the boy coach wor
rying about Chuck Nimmo in the
two-mile until the little senior
stopped shuffling and took his head
off his shoulder in the sixth lap and
began to take an active interest in
the race ... 24 Stanford boys, more
than have placed in many a Big
Meet for a long time, earning their
blocks in, incidentally, the 24th
Big Meet victor in meet history
. . . "Hard Luck Boy" Hardin, los
ing second place by seven inches
lifter being out-tape-measurod at
Troy by two inches . . . The stymie

twins, Tini Ginn and Alex Doran,
pole-vaulters, tying for the fourth
time in as many Card-Bear track
fests.
DAILY DOPESTERS almost se
cretly pulling for Helmer to beat
Weiershauser as the pair raced
round the turn in the relay finish.
Had Helmer taken advantage of his
two-yard lead and won, the Daily's
form-chart dopesheet would have
been correct on the nose to 'g of a
point. As it turned out, the final
score was a clean 50-50 compromise
between the official Daily dope and
the score Coach Dink stipulated in
the Daily. Dink's gave us 79 points,
the Daily's 70V2.
LAST TUESDAY Sideline Slants
here gave reasons why the Cards
should score 23 points in the three
good, as they came through the pile
up 26 of the 27 possible points.
Tuesday, of course, we were figur
ing Dick Brace for at least three in
the half.
