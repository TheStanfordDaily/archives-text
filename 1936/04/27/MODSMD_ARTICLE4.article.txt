## Several Hundred Onlookers View Annual Fete 
### 
Exhausted Chi Psi and Kappa
Kappa Gamma representatives
walked away from the cheers and
applause of several hundred on
lookers at the annual Junior Water
Carnival Saturday afternoon, victors
of the annual dunk day.
Each organization finished the
competition with safe margins over
its closest rival. Chi Psi amassed 16
points, including second place in the
floats contest, to win in the men's
division. Delta Chi took second and
Delta Upsilon third.
Kappas Victors
Kappa Kappa Gamma tallied 17
points, defeating Alpha O and
Gamma Phi Beta with seven apiece.
The Alpha O canoe, transformed
into a huge red and blue dragon
fly, won first place in the floats con
test. Second prize went to Chi Psi
for it model of "Swampum Con
struction Company's Dirty Crusher,"
a large red steam roller.
Pi Beta Phi's entry, a flower-be
decked float with the sorority let
ters inlaid in a large pin, was judged
superior to the Oak.s "bus" for third
place.
King and Queen Rein
King Vierling and Queen Parker
held royal sway over the festivities
from their facsimile of a Tahitian
monarch's vessel. Jack "Tiger-tail"
Murietta "officially crowned" the
two rulers and completed his act
with a series of aquatic stunts.
From his post on the boathouse
balcony, Jim Triolo performed his
duty as master of ceremonies, as
sisted by Mort. D'Evelyn, general
committee chairman. Jim Reynolds,
junior class president, awarded the
prizes to winners in each event.
