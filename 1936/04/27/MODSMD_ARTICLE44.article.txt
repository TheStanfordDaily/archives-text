# Cal Nine Takes Cards; Easy Win
## 12-2 Victory Scored In Last Game of Series 
### 
I Before Card pitchers could settle ;
down Saturday, California batters
' put together enough base hits, walks
j and hit batsmen to score nine runs
i which enabled them to coast to an
j easy P2-2 victory in the third and
final game of the series.
I Th roe ptchers. were used by
| Coach Harry Wolter in the first inn
| ing before the side could be l'etired,
j and a fourth was sent into the game
the following stanza. From then on
| the game was fairly even, but Card
i batters yrere unable to overcome the
I commanding Bear lead.
No more games remain on the
; regular Card schedule. Two exhibi-
J tion games have been scheduled
I with Waseta University when the
■ Japanese team tours this country'
I next month.

Giant rays, although they reach a
width of 20 feet, and weigh more
