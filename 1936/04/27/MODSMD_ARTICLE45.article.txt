## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Track Trip to I.C.4-A. Not Worth the Price of 'Selling Out' Coast Conference 
### 
Saturday's smashing IJig Meet triumph sat
isfactorily closed Stanford's dual track com
petition, and today Dink Templeton's squad
ollicially commences training for the coming
sectional and national meets.
Even before their clash with California,
many of the hucksters expressed a desire to
to the 1.C.4-A. meet, "Blue Ribhon classic
of the East," instead fo the conflicting Con
ference meet in Berkeley on May 29-30.
The final decision, of course, will be left to
the B.A.C. and will be definitely settled at
next week's Board meeting.
II the team does go East for the 1.C.4-A.,
however, il would materially injure the Con
ference meet, which Stanford herself was in
strumental in reviving. The Conference meet
is a "natural" for the West Coast. Four of
the schools included in it—Stanford, U.S.C.,
California, and U.C.L.A. — have consistently
won the 1.C.4-A. during the past decade, and
il probably would be only a few years before
the records sel up by the Coast Conference
would be better, on the whole, than the marks
in the Intcrcollegiates.
Standing by their own Conference will not
rob the Indian athletes of a trip East—they
can still go to Chicago for Ihe N.C.A.A. —the
only truly representative national meet —and
again to the Olympic finals if they arc for
tunate enough to place at Chicago.
It was too bad the Conference meet had to

be scheduled on the same week-end as the
1.C.4-A., but that was the only open date, and
the schedule makers particularly
the representatives of the four California
schools —last December wisely considered a
revival of the Pacific Coast Conference more
important and more directly worth while for
the "Rig Four" than the Intcrcollegiates.
After all, if it weren't for the performances
by the Western athletes, the 1.C.4-A. would be
a strictly sectional meet. Without them, .it
amounts to little more than a Conference meet
of Eastern schools, taking in a geographical
area smaller than that of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Of course, Stanford could look good at Phil
adelphia if U.S.C. stayed away. Rut Stanford
could look equally good at Berkeley on the
same day, and here she would have a chance
to accomplish the "impossible" feat of scor
ing three major Conference championships in
one year—if S.C. stayed away.
Moguls of the Coast Conference this year
have done much to cure the Conference of its
many ills and make it the most potent sec
tional collegiate athletic association in the
country; a successful track meet would give
Ibis move a big boost.
The "favorable publicity" and trip to Phila
delphia afforded by the "Blue Ribbon classic"
hardly seem worth "selling out" the Confer
ence and turning down the N.C.A.A., a meet
that is really national in scope.

After all, if it weren't for the performances
by the Western athletes, the 1.C.4-A. would be
a strictly sectional meet. Without them, .it
amounts to little more than a Conference meet
of Eastern schools, taking in a geographical
area smaller than that of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Of course, Stanford could look good at Phil
adelphia if U.S.C. stayed away. Rut Stanford
could look equally good at Berkeley on the
same day, and here she would have a chance
to accomplish the "impossible" feat of scor
ing three major Conference championships in
one year—if S.C. stayed away.
Moguls of the Coast Conference this year
have done much to cure the Conference of its
many ills and make it the most potent sec
tional collegiate athletic association in the
country; a successful track meet would give
Ibis move a big boost.
The "favorable publicity" and trip to Phila
delphia afforded by the "Blue Ribbon classic"
hardly seem worth "selling out" the Confer
ence and turning down the N.C.A.A., a meet
that is really national in scope.
Saturday's smashing IJig Meet triumph sat
isfactorily closed Stanford's dual track com
petition, and today Dink Templeton's squad
ollicially commences training for the coming
sectional and national meets.
Even before their clash with California,
many of the hucksters expressed a desire to
to the 1.C.4-A. meet, "Blue Ribhon classic
of the East," instead fo the conflicting Con
ference meet in Berkeley on May 29-30.
The final decision, of course, will be left to
the B.A.C. and will be definitely settled at
next week's Board meeting.
II the team does go East for the 1.C.4-A.,
however, il would materially injure the Con
ference meet, which Stanford herself was in
strumental in reviving. The Conference meet
is a "natural" for the West Coast. Four of
the schools included in it—Stanford, U.S.C.,
California, and U.C.L.A. — have consistently
won the 1.C.4-A. during the past decade, and
il probably would be only a few years before
the records sel up by the Coast Conference
would be better, on the whole, than the marks
in the Intcrcollegiates.
Standing by their own Conference will not
rob the Indian athletes of a trip East—they
can still go to Chicago for Ihe N.C.A.A. —the
only truly representative national meet —and
again to the Olympic finals if they arc for
tunate enough to place at Chicago.
It was too bad the Conference meet had to

be scheduled on the same week-end as the
1.C.4-A., but that was the only open date, and
the schedule makers particularly
the representatives of the four California
schools —last December wisely considered a
revival of the Pacific Coast Conference more
important and more directly worth while for
the "Rig Four" than the Intcrcollegiates.
