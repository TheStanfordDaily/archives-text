# Yale Phi Betes On the Right Track
## 
### 
The Yule Phi. Bete chapter is considering
changing its membership requirements to
make admission commensurate with general
achievement rather than mathematical grade
point superiority.
They propose ad justing election to the diffi

culty of course taken, the quality of prepa
ration, and improvement of grades since
freshman year.
Such an effort is laudable. It is in response
to the criticism often leveled at campus Phi
Betes that they are students who grind for
grades, that they are scholastic successes but
intellectual dullards.
That Phi Betes at Stanford are not all grind
ers for grades is evidenced by the fact that
many members and many prospective mem
bers are prominent in activities. They recog
nize, however, that a Block "S" in a sport evi
dences a specialization in physical activity,
that election to an office evidences a specializa
tion in glad-handing.
The Phi Beta key is a little more subtle
appeal dangled in front of the student to grind
for grades. The inference is that if the stu
dent grinds for grades he may possibly learn
something.
It is imposible to measure knowledge, im
provement, or wisdom, under the present
blue-book school of culture.
Not until there is some method of measuring
what a student is going to remember and ap
ply, what he has learned at the Palace of Fine
Arts, what he luis learned in browsing around
the Periodical Boom, or what kino of a phi
losophy of living he has evolved at the steak
houses and dance parlors, can a truly appro
priate system for granting Phi Beta Kappa
honors be concocted. The Yale chapter, how
ever, has the right idea.
