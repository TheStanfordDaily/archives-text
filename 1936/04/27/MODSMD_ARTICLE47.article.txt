### Mitchel Saadi 
(Editor's Note: In "Election by Propaganda,"
Mitchel Saadi, political scicnce assistant and au
thority on propaganda, leads off with a scries of
articles on the propaganda that will be used in the
coming presidential campaign.)
The war of propaganda is on!
It will be fun to sit on the sidelines and watch the
mud fly.
A few days ago Herbert Hoover announced that
. . the New Deal subordinates have loosed a smoke
screen of personalities and have begun to fire the
.squirt guns of propaganda." That gave him an excuse
to throw a few handfuls of his own.
A few weeks before, James A. Farley prophesied
. . our opponents will make this the bitterest and
certainly the dirtiest political struggle any of us here
can remember." That was his excuse and justifica
tion for mudslinging.
Those who read the Hearst press, or the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, or the Los Angeles Times need no
further assurance that the war of propaganda is on.
The Liberty League, the Manufacturers' Association
and the Crusaders, the DuPonts, the A1 Smiths and the
Talmadges are all lined up on their side of the mud
puddle, firing occasionally but mostly preparing mud
pies for the great offensive which starts in June.
On the other side of the pond may be found the
Coghlins, the Townsends and the Sinclairs offering to
lead the multitude out of the wilderness, but mean
while urging the workers, the farmers, and the idle
(old and young) to prepare for the impending War of
Propaganda.
Propaganda! Everyone is afraid of it. Everyone is
proficient at it. Everyone decries it and everyone
denies it.
What is it?
Is it lies and falsehoods? Or may it be truth? Is it
exaggeration or may it be enthusiasm? Is it based on
fear or may it be based on hope? Is it necessarily
alien or may it be 100 per cent American? Is it always
for an evil purpose or can it be for a worthy purpose?
What makes it so insidious?
The answer to all but the last of these questions
is both yes and no. And that is what makes it so
insidious. Most people don't know what propaganda
is—and so they fear it.
Propaganda is a handy sort of bugaboo. When
you can't answer your opponent's arguments logically,
just scream "propaganda!" When you can't deny ac
cusations, pass them off as propaganda. When you
wish to win the crowd's sympathy, say you've been
a victim of propaganda.
Never admit that you are "shooting the squirt guns
of propaganda." This is easy to do because what you
disseminate are pure facts, reliable information. You
don't propagandize—you educate. It's the other side
that sins.
Perhaps the best way to clear up our thoughts on
the matter—and that must be done if we would enjoy
the political circus that's coming to town —is to find
new terms with which to express ourselves.
First of all, let us restore the word propaganda to
its respectable pre-war meaning. Then and, in fact,
today, propaganda was and is defined as "any or
ganization for spreading a particular doctrine or
system or "any plan or scheme for propagating such
doctrine or system."
Liberally, this may be interpreted to be "the dis
semination of information and arguments for the pur
pose of winning support to a cause or a course of
action." This meaning is still held in Europe.
Please note the absence of any and all aspersions on
the truth of the information, the value of the ultimate
purpose and the character of the propagandist. There
is no evil connotation involved.
But, you say, there should be a word to cover the
efforts of a person who propagandizes by lies, who
has an ulterior motive, who plays upon the emotions,
who withholds important facts, who hides behind a
mask. What shall that be called?
In all seriousness and in honor of the man who
has done more than any other to develop the tech
nique of befuddling the befuddled—l submit the term
Hearsteria.
(Tomorrow Mr. Saadi will continue by giving
the reasons for his choice of the term llearsteria.)

In all seriousness and in honor of the man who

The war of propaganda is on!
It will be fun to sit on the sidelines and watch the
mud fly.
A few days ago Herbert Hoover announced that
. . the New Deal subordinates have loosed a smoke
screen of personalities and have begun to fire the
.squirt guns of propaganda." That gave him an excuse
to throw a few handfuls of his own.
A few weeks before, James A. Farley prophesied
. . our opponents will make this the bitterest and
certainly the dirtiest political struggle any of us here
can remember." That was his excuse and justifica
tion for mudslinging.
Those who read the Hearst press, or the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, or the Los Angeles Times need no
further assurance that the war of propaganda is on.
The Liberty League, the Manufacturers' Association
and the Crusaders, the DuPonts, the A1 Smiths and the
Talmadges are all lined up on their side of the mud
puddle, firing occasionally but mostly preparing mud
pies for the great offensive which starts in June.
On the other side of the pond may be found the
Coghlins, the Townsends and the Sinclairs offering to
lead the multitude out of the wilderness, but mean
while urging the workers, the farmers, and the idle
(old and young) to prepare for the impending War of
Propaganda.
Propaganda! Everyone is afraid of it. Everyone is
proficient at it. Everyone decries it and everyone
denies it.
What is it?
Is it lies and falsehoods? Or may it be truth? Is it
exaggeration or may it be enthusiasm? Is it based on
fear or may it be based on hope? Is it necessarily
alien or may it be 100 per cent American? Is it always
for an evil purpose or can it be for a worthy purpose?
What makes it so insidious?
The answer to all but the last of these questions
is both yes and no. And that is what makes it so
insidious. Most people don't know what propaganda
is—and so they fear it.
Propaganda is a handy sort of bugaboo. When
you can't answer your opponent's arguments logically,
just scream "propaganda!" When you can't deny ac
cusations, pass them off as propaganda. When you
wish to win the crowd's sympathy, say you've been
a victim of propaganda.
Never admit that you are "shooting the squirt guns
of propaganda." This is easy to do because what you
disseminate are pure facts, reliable information. You
don't propagandize—you educate. It's the other side
that sins.
Perhaps the best way to clear up our thoughts on
the matter—and that must be done if we would enjoy
the political circus that's coming to town —is to find
new terms with which to express ourselves.
First of all, let us restore the word propaganda to
its respectable pre-war meaning. Then and, in fact,
today, propaganda was and is defined as "any or
ganization for spreading a particular doctrine or
system or "any plan or scheme for propagating such
doctrine or system."
Liberally, this may be interpreted to be "the dis
semination of information and arguments for the pur
pose of winning support to a cause or a course of
action." This meaning is still held in Europe.
Please note the absence of any and all aspersions on
the truth of the information, the value of the ultimate
purpose and the character of the propagandist. There
is no evil connotation involved.
But, you say, there should be a word to cover the
efforts of a person who propagandizes by lies, who
has an ulterior motive, who plays upon the emotions,
who withholds important facts, who hides behind a

First of all, let us restore the word propaganda to
its respectable pre-war meaning. Then and, in fact,
today, propaganda was and is defined as "any or
ganization for spreading a particular doctrine or
system or "any plan or scheme for propagating such
doctrine or system."
Liberally, this may be interpreted to be "the dis
semination of information and arguments for the pur
pose of winning support to a cause or a course of
action." This meaning is still held in Europe.
Please note the absence of any and all aspersions on
the truth of the information, the value of the ultimate
purpose and the character of the propagandist. There
is no evil connotation involved.
But, you say, there should be a word to cover the
efforts of a person who propagandizes by lies, who
has an ulterior motive, who plays upon the emotions,
who withholds important facts, who hides behind a
mask. What shall that be called?
In all seriousness and in honor of the man who
has done more than any other to develop the tech
nique of befuddling the befuddled—l submit the term
Hearsteria.
(Tomorrow Mr. Saadi will continue by giving
the reasons for his choice of the term llearsteria.)
