## DEAR MR. HEARST 
### 
Mr. William Randolph Hearst, i
San Simeon, Calif.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
The unique honor you have be
stowed upon—well, I shall spare
you the mention of the name—upon
this certain large Northern Califor
nia University located in the vicinity
of Palo Alto has gone unacknowl
edged long enough.
I wish to take this opportunity to

say that the dis
tinction of having ;
our name placed !
upon the famed
Hearst blacklist is
not unappreciat
ed, and at the
same time to con
fess that it em
barrasses us to go
on accepting the
honor which our
modesty prevents
us from believing
is due us.

* *• *
Now of course we realize why we
were awarded number one position
on your list of unmentionables. And
if we had dreamed we were in line
for such renown we would have
done something which would have
made us really worthy of our re
ward. As it is, we are placed in the
position of the questionably danger
ous gangster who is suddenly flat
tered with the title of public en
emy number one.
* * *
In your eyes, apparently, the fact
that Professor George S. Counts of
Columbia University is going to pay
the Farm a brief visit next summer
to give a single speech is grounds
for excluding our name from all of
your 23 daily and 16 Sunday news
papers. Being perpetually at war
with those whose thoughts or be
liefs blush a red, pink or rosy hue,

| you obviously think that our aca
demic interior decorations have as-
I sumed the tint of our athletes' block
j S sweaters because we have ex
; tended Professor Counts this invita
j tion. The famous educator from the
; university with which we had per-
I sonal football relationships in 1934
I is undoubtedly one of your "pink«."
i He writes about Soviet Russia, has
| been associated with several pur
portedly "un-American" movements,
] and, it is rumored, even sent greet
• ings to the Soviet commemorating
' the fifteenth anniversary of the Rus
i sian revolution.
, * * *
If Mr. Counts was being hired by
the University, if he was coming
here to preach revolution, or even
to teach a course, then we might
have no qualms about accepting the
position you have given us. We
; would point with pride to the stu
i dious way your writers concoct
j synonyms for our true and legal
i name. We could boast that our
i teaching staff has become so dan
| gerously liberal that we have been
| relegated to oblivion in the eyes of
jso many millions of newspaper
! rqaders.
* * #
But as it is Mr. Counts is just
stopping in to give a talk to a few
| students down in the Graduate
School of Business on his way to
the N.E.A. convention in Portland.
And since we can't claim him as one
j of—whoa, I nearly said it —as one
! of the Indians' own, it pricks our
j consciences a little when we have to
j explain why we enjoy the distinc-.
I tion you have bestowed upon us.
Thanks, Mr. Hearst, but we don't
J really deserve it. Any college could
] have done the same thing. We were
just lucky.
Respectfully yours,
John McClelland
