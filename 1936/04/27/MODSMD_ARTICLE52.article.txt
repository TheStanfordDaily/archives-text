# 'Singing Kid', 'Boulder Dam' Entertaining
## 
### 
At last A1 Jolson is on to him- I
self —no more out-moded Mammy i
stuff and "THE SINGING KID"
turns out to be an amusing, fairly j

entertaining picture, j
He even goes so far |
as to satire his own j
Mammy singing, in ]
one of the best ]
scenes of the picture, J
the "I Love to Singa" |

routine. Cab Calloway's presence is I
partly responsible.
Sybil Jason, current Shirley Tem
ple rival, also helps make this pic- |
ture what it is—a better than aver- I
age Jolson opus. Less vivacious |
than Shirley and less adept at sing- i
ing and dancing, little Sybil never- !
theless has a winning way that is !
very appealing and will probably J
get her somewhere.
Worst shot: Jolson and the entire j
cast "goin* to heaven without a i
mule" in typical Jolson manner.
"BOULDER DAM" is noteworthy j
because of some very fine shots of |
the dam, particularly the "scaling" j
activities of the hero, Ross Alexan
der, and the cable cars crossing high
above the canyon. "Scaling" is
drilling into the side of a precipitous
cliff while suspended from rope. The
Bay bridge will probably be next in
line.
