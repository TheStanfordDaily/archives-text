# Roble Club Plans Paris Supper Dance
## 
### 
Dinner at a sidewalk cafe, wan
dering musicians, French food and
decorations will contribute to the
"Paris in the Spring" motif of the
Roble Club supper dance to be held
from 6:30 to 12 o'clock, May 2.
Freddie Nagel's orchestra, with
specially arranged vocalizations,
will furnish the music. Jean Darsie
will sing with the strolling minstrels.

Gas explosions can now be pre
vented by smothering the dangerous
vapors with carbon dioxide and ni
trogen.
