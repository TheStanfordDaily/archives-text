# Stanford Theatre Cornerstone To Be Laid June 2
## Structure To Be Dedicated To Student War Dead; Plans Near Completion 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Cornerstone laying of Stanford's
new campus theater will be held
Tuesday, June 2, although delays in
construction for a while made it
doubtful whether or not the cere
mony could be held at all thus quar
ter.
Theater committee members
Wally Brooke, Annalee Whitmore,
and A1 Hyman met yesterday with
Paul Holden of the Public Exer
cises Committee and have almost
completed plans for the program.
Dailies in Cornerstone
Included in the cornerstone will be
newspapers of the day, Dailies with
key stories concerning progress of
the theater, a list of the Stanford
war dead, to whom the theater will
be dedicated, copies of the speeches
to be made, a list of the two student
theater committees, and a bawl-out.
The last is so that the students who
aided construction by paying the
additional dollar per quarter would
be represented.
Invitations will be issued by the
committee this week, and a list of
the notables wiil be announced
soon.
Program Brief
The program will be brief, ac
cording to the committee. No seat
ing facilities can be provided, as the
entire cornerstone laying will be on
the site of the theater where it
would be impossible to place chairs.
Members of the present senior
class who aided in making arrange
ments for building of the theater
were the main reason for having the
ceremony this quarter. Since stu
dents played such a large part in
making construction possible, they
should be enabled to see the pro
gram and take part in it, the com
mittee decided.
The theater will probably be com
pleted by ths end of next fall quar
ter. The original schedule called
for completion during the summer,
but floods in the East, delaying
steel, and rains on the campus,
which held up excavation work,
have postponed the date at least
two months.
