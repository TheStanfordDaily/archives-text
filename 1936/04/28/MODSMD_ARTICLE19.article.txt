# Curti Questions V.F.W.'s Originality
## 
### John McClelland 
Not even Ihe V.F.W., the newest
in American peace movements, is
new. At least not to those few men
who have delved into the history of
this renewed struggle for peace.
Professor Merle E. Curti of Smith
College, visiting Stanford to give a
Tuesday evening lecture tonight, is
one of those few. His studies of war
and peace movements and the prop
aganda accompanying both have led
to the writing of three books and a
thorough knowledge of this unusual
phase of history.
Kidirule Used in 1904
"Back in 1904 ridicule and satire
were first used by a youth group to
combat war," Professor Curti said in
explaining the unoriginality of the
Veterans of Future Wars. "The
Collegiate Anti-War League pub
lished a humorous periodical pictur
ing war as being ridiculous.
"Neutrality, embargos, peace
strikes, pledges not to go to war—all
have been experimented with in the
past. And all have been known to
fail," Dr. Curti said. "One of the
chief reasons for the weakness of
the struggle against war is the con
fusion of objectives."
Interprets Statement
This statement lie interpreted fur
ther by saying: "Any movement

against war which plays down the
internal causes of war is bound to
be ineffective. And very few who
claim they are combatting war put
the ideal for peace above all else.
"Every major war that this coun
i try has fought has been accompa
nied by propaganda proclaiming:
| 'a war to end war'."
But Professor Curti doesn't dis
credit peace movements entirely. He
i believes, instead, that their effective
i ness cannot be measured since one
can never tell just when a war was
i prevented or why.
Credit Given 'Feeling'
"In 1927. for example, there was a
definite crisis with Mexico, and most
people gave the credit for prevent
i ing a war to Dwight. Morrow,
j Charles Lindbergh, and Will Rog
ers. Actually, a definitely formed
; feeling against war should be given
' the credit."
Preparedness is one weapon for
peace which Dr. Curti discounts
. entirely. The V.F.W., he believes,
j made a little contribution but is too
j superficial, too fragile to be lasting.
I But all student peace movements,
short lived or fruitless though they
j may seem, have one great value.
; They keep the younger people aware
I of the one thing everyone wants.

peace which Dr. Curti discounts
. entirely. The V.F.W., he believes,
j made a little contribution but is too
j superficial, too fragile to be lasting.
I But all student peace movements,
short lived or fruitless though they
j may seem, have one great value.

I of the one thing everyone wants.
Not even Ihe V.F.W., the newest
in American peace movements, is
new. At least not to those few men
who have delved into the history of
this renewed struggle for peace.
Professor Merle E. Curti of Smith
College, visiting Stanford to give a
Tuesday evening lecture tonight, is
one of those few. His studies of war
and peace movements and the prop
aganda accompanying both have led
to the writing of three books and a
thorough knowledge of this unusual
phase of history.
Kidirule Used in 1904
"Back in 1904 ridicule and satire
were first used by a youth group to
combat war," Professor Curti said in
explaining the unoriginality of the
Veterans of Future Wars. "The
Collegiate Anti-War League pub
lished a humorous periodical pictur
ing war as being ridiculous.
"Neutrality, embargos, peace
strikes, pledges not to go to war—all
have been experimented with in the
past. And all have been known to
fail," Dr. Curti said. "One of the
chief reasons for the weakness of
the struggle against war is the con
fusion of objectives."
Interprets Statement
This statement lie interpreted fur
ther by saying: "Any movement

against war which plays down the
internal causes of war is bound to
be ineffective. And very few who
claim they are combatting war put
the ideal for peace above all else.
"Every major war that this coun
i try has fought has been accompa
nied by propaganda proclaiming:
| 'a war to end war'."
But Professor Curti doesn't dis
credit peace movements entirely. He
i believes, instead, that their effective
i ness cannot be measured since one
can never tell just when a war was
i prevented or why.
Credit Given 'Feeling'
"In 1927. for example, there was a
definite crisis with Mexico, and most
people gave the credit for prevent
i ing a war to Dwight. Morrow,
j Charles Lindbergh, and Will Rog
ers. Actually, a definitely formed
; feeling against war should be given
' the credit."
