# Ex Committee Probes Politics
## A.S.S.U. Nominating Plan To Be Reorganized 
### 
Results of a week's muck-raking
in local politics will be discovered in
tonight's Ex Committee meeting, as
members report on their investiga
tion of alleged sophomore machines
and deficiencies of the caucus sys
tem.
Definite action will be taken, said
President Wally Brooke. The pur
pose was originally to discover if
the Hall-Row split was inevitable,
and to reorganize the 'nominating
procedure for A.S.S.U. elections.
Other business will include a re
view of the action taken on the re
bate system by the Book Store
Board, and a grant to send Wally
Brooke and the president-elect to
the Pacific States President's Con
vention, to be held in Los Angeles
and Catalina May 21 to 24.
Possibility of establishing yacht
ing as a minor sport was seen, as
over 20 students volunteered to rep
resent Stanford at the regatta on
June 14, which will be held at San
Diego. Most coast schools will be
represented, said Brooke, and a
financial grant might possibly be
made to the Farm's entry, if one is
officially named.
