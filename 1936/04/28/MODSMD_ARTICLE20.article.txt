# Masters, Dink Disagree On I.C.4-A Entry
## Pacific Conference Meet, Eastern Classic To Be Held During Same Day 
### 
Advising strongly against a Stan
ford entry in the 1.C.4-A. in Phila
delphia May 29 and 30, Graduate
Manager A1 Masters yesterday said
he had no word that U.S.C. or any
other Pacific Coast Conference
school would withdraw from the
Berkeley affair in favor of the east
| ern meet that is running the same |
days.
Chicago Trip
Masters also announced that Stan
| ford and other coast collegiate ath
letes could qualify for the American
Olympic eliminations in New York
July 10 and 11 by placing in the
N.C.A.A. at Chicago June 19-20,
thereby eliminating the quick trip
back to the Los Angeles qualifying
meet. This would make possible a
Stanford trip to Chicago, and ruin
the best argument of the 1.C.4-A.
| faction.
Masters was particularly desirous
of not bogging down the new-born
Pacific Coast meet, which this year
is including all nine schools of the
conference for the first time in over j
a decade, and for which Stanford j
was largely responsible.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiates, j
he believes, in time could be built
up into an affair as important as the
1.C.4-A. itself, which is, in truth,
outside of the far western entries,
a meet including only east coast
: and near-east coast schools.
Meets Conflict
If Stanford goes to the N.C.A.A.,
i however, they enter a meet much
more national in scope, and at the
same time make their eastern cam
paign at a time that doesn't conflict
with western dates.
Dink Templeton's of the opinion
that the N.C.A.A. is not given the
respect throughout the country that
is tendered the 1.C.4-A. He is at
-1 tached to the 1.C.4-A. after a decade
of campaigning there with admirable
showings each year. He feels that
the Intercollegiates at Berkeley,
with the loose organization and pub
licity they have shown so far, will
i more or less fall through and is still
in favor of Stanford's participation
i at Philadelphia.
