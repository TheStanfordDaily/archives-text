# 'Steel Man' At Theater Blamed On Pranksters
## 
### 
Student pranksters were held
responsible for a "steel man" dis
covered atop the cement chute by
John Leiber, superintendent of
(he construction of the new Stan
ford Theater, when he arrived at
work this morning.
"Who is that fellow?" he asked.
"They told me Jie's a steel man
from the bay bridge," a worker
offered. "He wants a job."
Leiber shouted to the fellow and
failed to stir him. Upon investiga
tion the "steel man" was discov
ered to be a carefully prepared
dummy.
