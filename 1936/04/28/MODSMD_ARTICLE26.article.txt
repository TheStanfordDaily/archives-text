# Train Chairs Figure in Play
## Prologue of 'June Moon' Staged On Train Set 
### 
A pair of borrowed parlor car
chairs from a local railroad are
among the unusual items secured
for Dramatic Council's production of
"June Moon" to be presented in
Stanford's Assembly Hall on May 8.
The chairs, which will be mounted
on a movable platform built to rep
resent a section of a parlor car, will
be used for the prologue of the pop
ular Lardner-Kaufman comedy.
Two Pianos Used
Other requirements for the show
include two instead of the usual one
piano, because of the actor's lack of
piano playing ability, and a com
plete set of office equipment to be
used in several of the scenes.
Two realistic sets of the box va
riety will be used and will represent
a song writer's apartment in New
York's east 70's and a song publish
ers' office in the down town area.
One Scene Change
Only one scenc change will be
necessary, inasmuch as the last two
acts will take place in the publish
ing office. The intermission, as a
result, will be held after the first
act, to give stage hands an oppor
tunity to change scencs. "Striking,"
or changing the set, will be accomp
lished by folding the "flying" stage
units.
Technical direction will be han
dled, as it was last quarter, by Phil
Brown, who will be assisted by the
class in theatrical workshop.
