# Rush Changes Voted By Pan-Hell Council, Ratified by 5 Houses
## Five Houses Accept Proposed Revision Involving Points in Conflict 
### Florence Brown 
Pan-Hellenic Council and five of
the campus' nine sorority houses
yesterday voted their approval of a
complete program of changes in the
rushing system, statements of future
policy, and definitions of rushing
terms.
The five houses, Chi 0, Gamma
Phi Kap, Pi Phi, and Theta, accepted
the changes as they stood in the
program presented to these houses
at meetings last night. Alpha Phi
reserved their decision on the new
plan until a discussion of several
minor points could be made, and
Alpha O and Tri Delt did not take
up the question at all.
Six-Point Program
The new program involved six
main points particularly concerning
the subjects of recent controversy.
They are necessarily general, ac
cording to Jeanne Keesling, Pan-
Hellenic president, and it is only
hoped, she said, that "each house
will abide by the program and try
to have faith in its operation." The
points are as follows:
1. The committee investigating
present difficulties decided that
"secret" bidding and "implied" bid
ding were the same thing, and that
a discussion of financial or other aid
before or during rushing would be
termed secret bidding. 'In the event
of this, if the discussion had been
held before the end of the second
period of formal rushing, the house
involved would suffer the loss of
bidding privileges for the current
school year. If discussed after this
second period the penalty would be
lessened at the discretion of the
joint committee. If, however, secret
bidding is a definitely established
fact, the committee had no choice
but to impose the full penalty.
Joint Committee
2. No member of the joint com
mittee, which is composed of the
president of Pan-Hellenic, the dean
of women, and two seniors elected
by Pan-llell, can be a member of
a sorority house involved in charges
of illegal rushing.
3. If a sorority is brought before
the committee for violation of rush
ing rules the alumni adviser may be
present at the meeting but has no
vote in the procedure.
Illegal Entertaining
4. Illegal entertaining or contacts,
such as off-campus parties, entails
the loss of rushing dates, the num
ber to be decided by the joint com
mittee. The penalty for illegal con
tacts during rushing before bidding
shall be deferred bidding for the
individual by the house involved,
but other houses may bid the in
dividual.
5. The joint committee shall have
the power to decide whether the
spirit of the bidding contract has
been broken or contact with new
women through alumnae or mem
bers of other chapters has been un
warranted. They shall also have
the power to deal out the penalty
in accordance with the infringe
ments.
6. Violation of the rushing rules
must be placed before Pan-Hellenic
as a body, the penalty to be deter
mined by it.
The new rules also stated that all
summer rushing was to be abso
lutely forbidden, and all informal
contacts must be reported to Pan-
Hellenic Council.
Last night's vote on the proposed
changes will be final and the new
program will go into .effect next fall
unless houses which have not yet
voted propose any particularly sig
nificant or important changes, which
is deemed unlikely since the com
mittee has gone over every possible
point with considerable detail.
