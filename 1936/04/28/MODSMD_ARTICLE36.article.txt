# Polo Player Rides Own Ponies on 'Job'
## Sheriff Frehe Inspects 8,000 Acres Daily

| A polo player? Must be a pluto-
I crat!
But did you ever hear of a polo
1 player, experienced rider, and owner
j of a string of ponies playing polo as
j a "job"? There is just such an in
dividual on the Stanford campus.
He has four horses —all "honeys"—
| and rides every day. He plays polo,
i rides in horse shows, rodeos, and ex
hibitions.
Bay Point, Gold Run, Short Cargo,
! and Cherico are all registered ponies,
i Two have raced, and all play polo.
I They have a pal, Whoopie, who ac
f companies them whenever they go
out on the road. He is a large,
shaggie collie, and very smart,
Whoopie, in wet weather, earns his
board 'n keep by letting his master
I "rope" him, just like they do wild
steers. He will run up and down the
track, dodge the lasso, and slip out
of it easily if he does get caught.
Sheriff Frehe, Owner
The owners of this particular
string of ponies are Deputy Sheriff
Frehe and his son. Mel. Being fore
man of all outside Stanford property,
including 8000 acres around the
; campus, Mr. Frehe and son ride the
ranges in true cattleman spirit. All
the cattle and horses need looking
after, so, using these same horses,
j they work out in the "wide open
j spaces" every day.
During the summer Mel rides in
shows and rodeos, carrying his
horses with him in a trailer. He also
plays polo with several different
teams here in northern California.
He won the Governor's Cup last
year with a team across the bay.
Breaking ponies and selling them is
part of the job, too.
Have Silver Saddle
The Frehes own a complete outfit
of trappings, including one of the
famous Helman silver saddles. Mel
rode for several years with the Hel
man string in Southern California
and led the parade of horses down
the stairs inside the Rose Bowl one
New Year's Day. It was the biggest
thrill he had ever had, he says.
These same "plutocrats" have a
track of their own in the summer,
too. It's a five-eighths-mile run,
with exceptionally good footing.
And, guess where—it's in the middle
of Lake Lagunita. Around the com
that's there every summer, at that!
