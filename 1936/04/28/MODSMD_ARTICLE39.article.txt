The Editor, Sir:
Any newspaper that misrepresents
facts for the sake of sensationalism
belongs very definitely in the class
of Hearst publications.
In its editorial of April 21, The
Daily stated that "Farm students
don't have to go off behind the barn
to hear academic discussions on So
cialism," intimating that the Admin
istration is becoming more liberal in
allowing Norman Thomas to speak
in the Assembly Hall.
The Daily stated that during Mr.
Thomas' last visit to the campus he
was allowed to speak before only a
small gathering in the Women's
Clubhouse. True as this may be, The
Daily suppressed the fact that dur
ing the very same year Mr. Thomas
addressed a packed Assembly Hall
and was introduced to the student
body by Dr. Wilbur himself.
I like to feel that this misrepre
sentation of fact for the sake of se
curing sensationalism was not in
tentional on the part of The Daily.
It should probably be excused on
the grounds that once more The
Daily is living up to its traditional
policy of getting few facts straight.
Harold Charters
(Ed. Noteâ€”The Daily is very flat
tered to think that our correspondent
thinks the edit columns sensational,
in fact, quite surprised that anyone
reads them at all.
In order to establish the FACT
that Norman Thomas did not favor
the campus with two visits in the
same year, The Daily submits this
chronology of the Thomas visits
within historic times:
October 4, 1932, Thomas speaks at
Scottish Rite auditorium in city.
Campus "red-hots" slink up to lis
ten. Thomas denied request to

I harangue at University, on grounds
' that "no presidential candidate al
' lowed to speak at Stanford."
j October 18, 1933, Thomas speaks to
i campus, introduced by Dr. Wilbur,
; gives practically same speech he de
livered last week.
November 19, 1934, LID and Wal
rus Club listen to Thomas in the
Women's Clubhouse.)
