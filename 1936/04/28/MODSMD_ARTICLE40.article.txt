# Convict Killed In Alcatraz Escape Attempt
## Mail Robber Hurtles Sixty Feet to Bay Waters In 'Devil's Island' Break 
### 
In a desperate escape attempt from j
Alcatraz Island, Joe Bowers, 40- ;
year-old mail bandit, was killed j
yesterday as his bullet-riddled body J
hurtled GO feet into San Francisco i
Bay.
Victim of the first try to break I
America's escape-proof Devil's |
Island, Bowers braved the fire of
armed guards, climbed a barbed
wire fence, and as he was about to
dive into the bay was peppered with |
bullets. His body fell from the top ,
of the fence onto wave-washed
rocks at bay level.
Bowers' attempt occurred at 11
o'clock as Warden James O. John- \
ston was inspecting the prison work
shops. Completing his work at the i
prison incinerator, the post office |
robber ran to a wire fence enclos- j
ing the work area instead of pro- j
ceeding down the prison stairway, 1
j Warden Johnston said.
Disobeys Guards
As he broke into a run across the
j yard guards ordered him to halt.
| When he disregarded their com
j mands they fired twice into the
ground. Bowers continued on until j
reaching the fence which skirts a GO
- drop into the bay. He scaled it
and dropped to the other side as
guards fired two more shots, these
deliberately aimed.
The bullets caught him as he was
preparing to leap, and he fell
plummet-like. Jagged rocks, bared
by low tide, caught his fall. Bowers'
body was found hanging to the rocks,
his neck broken, according to Dr.
Horace Hess, prison physician, who
rode the prison launch dispatched to
recover the body.
Escape Impossible
Even though Bowers would have
been successful in reaching the
water his escape would have been
impossible, prison authorities de
clared. Water surrounding the island
is within machine gun fire and all
boats approaching the penitentiary
I within 200 yards draw Federal bul
lets.
And even should Bowers have
miraculously escaped these man
made barriers, swift currents flow
ing about the island would have
j made it impossible for him to reach
the mainland.

Alcatraz Island, Joe Bowers, 40- ;
year-old mail bandit, was killed j
yesterday as his bullet-riddled body J
hurtled GO feet into San Francisco i
Bay.
Victim of the first try to break I
America's escape-proof Devil's |
Island, Bowers braved the fire of
armed guards, climbed a barbed
wire fence, and as he was about to
dive into the bay was peppered with |
bullets. His body fell from the top ,
of the fence onto wave-washed
rocks at bay level.
Bowers' attempt occurred at 11
o'clock as Warden James O. John- \
ston was inspecting the prison work
shops. Completing his work at the i
prison incinerator, the post office |
robber ran to a wire fence enclos- j
ing the work area instead of pro- j
ceeding down the prison stairway, 1
j Warden Johnston said.
Disobeys Guards
As he broke into a run across the
j yard guards ordered him to halt.
| When he disregarded their com
j mands they fired twice into the
ground. Bowers continued on until j
reaching the fence which skirts a GO
- drop into the bay. He scaled it
and dropped to the other side as
guards fired two more shots, these
deliberately aimed.
The bullets caught him as he was
preparing to leap, and he fell
plummet-like. Jagged rocks, bared
by low tide, caught his fall. Bowers'
body was found hanging to the rocks,
his neck broken, according to Dr.
Horace Hess, prison physician, who
rode the prison launch dispatched to
recover the body.
Escape Impossible
Even though Bowers would have
been successful in reaching the
water his escape would have been
impossible, prison authorities de
clared. Water surrounding the island
is within machine gun fire and all
boats approaching the penitentiary
I within 200 yards draw Federal bul
lets.
And even should Bowers have
miraculously escaped these man
made barriers, swift currents flow
ing about the island would have
j made it impossible for him to reach
the mainland.
