### Phil Kiauher 
Tentative arrangements for that
"natural" track meet between the
Olympic Club and the Stanford var
sity which was postponed because
of rain last April 4 were announced
yesterday, rescheduling the affair
for Angel 1 Field May 9, a week
from this Saturday.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters has
secured the whole-hearted accept
ance of Charley Hunter, Winged-0
coach, and final details await only
the ratification of the engagement by
higher officers of the San Francisco
club.
Agreement Waived
An agreement between Cul and
Stanford that neither would partici
pate in a dual meet after the Big
Meet was waived yesterday by Bill
Monahan, California graduate man
ager.
Local track fans hailed the new
engagement with glee, as it makes
an otherwise short dual meet sea
son a well-rounded affair, and gives
an opportunity to watch the poten
tial Olympic men, Eastman, Dunn,
Marty, Bright, Clark, et al in action
once more before their serious
eastern campaign.
Tracksters Resting
Meanwhile at Angell Field yes
terday all was calm, with the track
sters resting up from their Big Meet
victory by a little change—those that
came out warmed up with a decath
lon in events they hadn't touched
ever, or since high school.
Principle reminiscing amongst the
boys about the meet concerned the
100-yard dash, won by Ray Dean,
with Mushy Pollock of Cal second
and Jim Kneubuhl third. Concensus
was that Kneubuhl was further up
in the finish than the judges gave
him. Anybody take any pictures?
