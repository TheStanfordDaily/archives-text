# New Candidates Out for Football
## Bill Corbus, Jim Reynolds Watch Gridiron Hopes 
### 
With seasons closed for several i
spring athletic teams, nearly all
varsity candidates turned out for !
yesterday's football practice. Leo
Madlem, star broadjuinper and re- i
cent find of the varsity track squad, 1
will not be out this week.
Passes Stressed
Coach Tiny Thornhill drilled the
men mostly in forward pass protec- I
tion. This was the first time this J
quarter that gridders have been ;
trained in protecting the passer
while ends and backs run down the :
field.
Fellows who were out for the first j
time yesterday or last week were
formed into separate strings in or
der that they can learn plays and get
into condition before they take part
in the scrimmages. They will run
through plays and practice funda- j
mentals.
Scrimmage Daily
Tiny expects to hold a scrimmage
at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon with 1
light scrimmages almost daily for the j
rest of the quarter.
Every Thursday there will be a
short game. Evenly matched teams
