### 
Bob Haslacher, all-Coast 'goalie,
will lead the "Cardinal Indians"
water polo team against Bay District
teams in the Olympic sectional try- I
outs May 16-17 with a good chance
to place Stanford men on the Amer- i
ican team.
At ihe same time Winfield Need- !
ham, Stanford's promising freshman
distance man, makes his bid for a
berth on the Olympic swimming
team when he churns through the
1500 meters event outstanding favor
ite to win.
Predicts Yearling Win
Coach Thornton predicts the In
dian yearling will out-swim his
nearest rival, Dick Keating of the
Olympic Club, by 25 to 50 meters.
If Needham swims to a win he will
journey to Providence, R.1., for the
finals to be held July 10.
Because no single water-polo I
teum in the district stands a chance
of upsetting the powerful Los An
geles Athletic Club team, Bay re
gion talent will »be "pooled" and |
stars from Stanford, California, and
Athens Club teams will join Charlie
Hunter's Olympic Club outfit.
To Pick Individuals
So in the last analysis, tryouts at
the Fleishhacker pool next month
will be played off to pick individ
uals and not any single team.
While the "Cardinal Indians" will 1
not officially represent the univer- j
sity, they will comprise what is to be
Thornton's next year's varsity. '
Graduates and senior members will
be used only as substitutes.
