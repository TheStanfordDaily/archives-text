## N.C.A.A, AND TYLER TOO? 
### 
As these words are being written,
the whole Conference-1.C.4-A. thing
is clearing up in this still slightly
fuddled brain.
As it looks right now the Confer
ence Meet, May 29-30, is on. the
1.C.4-A. of the same week-end is off,
and the N.C.A.A. is a definite possi
bility.
What we want to do is to make
that N.C.A.A. a reality.
Among other things that have
been cleared up in the past week,
the week, incidentally, that blew the
whole thing up. is the fact that the
N.C.2-A. is a semi-final qualifier for
the final Olympic tryouts to be held
in New York this summer.
So one of the best points of the
1.C.4-A.-bound campaigners bites
the dust. They were saying that if
we went to the N.C.2-A. the team
would have to compete there Sun
day, take the train from Chicago to
Los Angeles, and try out for the
Berlin finals after the rids and loss
of practice. Which as it turns out is
not true.
If Stanford fellows place in the
Chicago Nationals they art- thereby
qualified to go to the final tryouts.
Those who do not place have one
more shot at a chance by going to
Los Angeles and meeting the West's
best there.
But if a man does not place in the
N.C.2-A. it is not hard to see lhat he
is going to have one helluva time
qualifying in Los Angeles and again
in New York against the country's
best, where all college, non-college,
club, and miscellaneous champs are
going to put out their best for a
jaunt to Berlin.
