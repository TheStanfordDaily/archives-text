# CONFERENCE MEET ON, N.C.2-A. TOO
## 
### 
A1 Masters yesterday was of ihe
opinion that tfcis Conference meet,
for May 29,30, the one that conflicts
with the 1.C.4-A., was still definitely
"on"' and that no one of the ten
Conference schools that agreed to
have the meet had backed out as yet.-
Masters personally called up Tro
jan authorities on the long-distance
wide last week when rumors had it
that Troy might pull out of the
Conference embroglio and go to the
1.C.4-A. Troy replied that this ru
mor was not at all as it should be,
and told the B.A.C. leader that they
were going to come to the 10-way
meet.
So with S.C. and its band of head
ling artists practically assured, and
good chances for northern schools to
send their best men, the Coast. Inter
collegiates will in no manner be a
bust.
So with this hypothesis as pretty
well accepted, there will be the Col
legiates on the 29th and the N.C.2-A.
June 19 and 20.
Money for the trip to Chicago on
the latter date is supposed to have
been already set aside, so that bar
rier is out.
With all of the above honeyed tid

ings going into effect, all should be
O.K. with the track men, who will
be getting their trip, their Olympics
tryouts, their acquiescence to the
dictates of the Conference, and good
blood all around. â€”Breed
