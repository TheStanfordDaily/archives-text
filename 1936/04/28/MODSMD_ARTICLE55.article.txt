# Golfers Compete For Novice Title
## Varsity Players Excluded From Week's Play 
### 
The golf novice comes into his
own at the Stanford golf course this
week with the end oi the big time
golf season and the beginning of the
all-University tournaments. The
i qualifying rounds for the novice
must be played by a week from
today.
The field of this tournament is
limited by the fact that it is intended
for the lower class golfer who has
never won or been runner up in
what might be called a major tour
nament. Former winners of the
novice tournament and varsity
golfers are excluded from competi
i tion in this tournament.
i The first 16 men in the qualifying
round will play for the Novice
Championship while the next 16 will
I compete in the second flight; the
j third flight will be for the remain
der. There will be a trophy for the
winners in each flight.
The novice tournament in the
past has been one of the best places
for the new golfer to show his metal.
The varsity and the more experi
enced men are eliminated, giving full
run to the newcomer and ex-duffer
| to come through without getting
buck-fever or being scared into sub
i mission by one of his betters.
