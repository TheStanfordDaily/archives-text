## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Choice of Best Women Sponsors Being Hindered by Economic Discrimination 
### 
Springtime brings sponsor-selecting time.
A special committee spent Sunday night se
lecting the "first" list of women nominated to
he Hoble sponsors next year.
At a time when the campus, through agita
tion lor a pre-registration period and strength
ening of Honor Code, is becoming increasingly
conscious of a need for more ellicient induc
tion into the Stanford tradition, the securing
of the best possible sponsors is of paramount
importance.
What a good sponsor is will never be de
cided in an editorial, but what is significant is
tli;d lasl year, those the selecting committee
considered the best women did not all become
sponsors. Only three of the lirst list of 17
accepted the nomination. And it was not until
the third list was drawn up that the quota was
lilted.
Reasons advanced by the women were prin
cipally economic.
Because Kncina freshmen break glass, wood,
furniture, and University property generally,
and Kohle freshmen do not, Kncina sponsors
get policeman's pay of free rent, and lloble
sponsors do not.
There is also the argument advanced by
administrative circles that if Roble sponsors
were given free rent it would have a delete
rious ell'ect on sponsor morale, that it would

encourage choice of women sponsors on the
basis of need rather than ability.
From this would follow that Kncina spon
sors are selected on the basis of need rather
than ability. There is a bit of campus legend
which hints that in some cases they were se
lected on the basis of neither.
Sorority women find that their pains to
educate the neophytes actually cost them
nearly $20 per quarter. This reckoning comes
from the difference in cost of the Roble board
and room and the average sorority house-bills,
the requirements to pay Roble dues, denial of
free guest privileges, and the expense of fur
nishing the room "so that it will be an attrac
tive haven for freshmen women."
Hall women do not have all these economic
differences, but they find that no provision is
made for the reservation of their rooms, so
that when the sponsor's job is over spring
quarter, they may not always return to their
circle of friends in Lagunita or Union, but
sometimes are required to room at Oaks or
Madrono.
Rarely does a woman selected for sponsor
ship begrudge the time and service required,
hut until such time as she can live as eco
nomically in Roble as she can in her sorority
house or Lagunita, she can hardly be blamed
for being forced, for financial reasons, to turn
down the honor.

Sorority women find that their pains to
educate the neophytes actually cost them
nearly $20 per quarter. This reckoning comes
from the difference in cost of the Roble board
and room and the average sorority house-bills,
the requirements to pay Roble dues, denial of
free guest privileges, and the expense of fur
nishing the room "so that it will be an attrac
tive haven for freshmen women."
Hall women do not have all these economic
differences, but they find that no provision is
made for the reservation of their rooms, so
that when the sponsor's job is over spring
quarter, they may not always return to their
circle of friends in Lagunita or Union, but
sometimes are required to room at Oaks or
Madrono.
Rarely does a woman selected for sponsor
ship begrudge the time and service required,
hut until such time as she can live as eco
nomically in Roble as she can in her sorority
house or Lagunita, she can hardly be blamed
for being forced, for financial reasons, to turn
down the honor.
Springtime brings sponsor-selecting time.
A special committee spent Sunday night se
lecting the "first" list of women nominated to
he Hoble sponsors next year.
At a time when the campus, through agita
tion lor a pre-registration period and strength
ening of Honor Code, is becoming increasingly
conscious of a need for more ellicient induc
tion into the Stanford tradition, the securing
of the best possible sponsors is of paramount
importance.
What a good sponsor is will never be de
cided in an editorial, but what is significant is
tli;d lasl year, those the selecting committee
considered the best women did not all become
sponsors. Only three of the lirst list of 17
accepted the nomination. And it was not until
the third list was drawn up that the quota was
lilted.
Reasons advanced by the women were prin
cipally economic.
Because Kncina freshmen break glass, wood,
furniture, and University property generally,
and Kohle freshmen do not, Kncina sponsors
get policeman's pay of free rent, and lloble
sponsors do not.
There is also the argument advanced by
administrative circles that if Roble sponsors
were given free rent it would have a delete
rious ell'ect on sponsor morale, that it would

encourage choice of women sponsors on the
basis of need rather than ability.
