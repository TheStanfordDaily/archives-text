# Election By Propaganda

### Mitchel Saadi 
(Editor's Note: Mr. Saadi today describes
"hearsteria" in his second article on the propa
ganda that will feature the coming presidential
campaign.)
The term Hearsteria is self-explaining. It connotes
hysteria, artificially created on a large scale. It is
called Hearsteria, not because Mr. Hearst is the sole
user of the technique, but because he, more than any
other man, has perfected it.
Starting with the now-famous cable Mr. Hearst sent
to his artists in Cuba in 1898 urging thern, "You fur
nish the pictures, I'll furnish the war," a student of
Hearsteria can find an abundance of illustrations.
Turn back the newspaper pages and see how success
fully he worked the nation into a high pitch of mad
ness. How he aroused emotion and fears and preju
dices with faked pictures of atrocities and catchy
slogans of "Remember the Main" and "Cuba libre!"
Find out how he increased the circulation of the
New York Journal from 500.000 to 1,600,000.

Then turn your attention to the fit of Hearsteria
our hero caused with such editorial tid-bits as this:
The bullet that pierced Goebel's chest
Cannot be found in the West;
Good reason, it is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier.
Another:
Institutions, like men, will last un.til they die; and
if bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of
only by killing, then the killing must be done.
Was it any wonder that President Theodore Roose
velt believed the assassination of McKinley was due to
such Hearsterical promptings?
* * # v »!
What is this technique we call Hearsteria? Why
is it practiced?
The answer is simple.
Hearsterical people don't think. They are more
easily frightened into doing something they wouldn't
rationally do. Their reason is dulled and their emo
tions are aroused. They are less critical of the de
mands placed before them, less likely to see the ulterior
motive.
Here is what Elihu Root thought of Hearsteria in
1906:
"It is not the calm and lawful redress of wrongs
which he seeks; it is the turmoil of inflamed passions
and the terrorism of revengeful force; he spreads the
spirit, he follows the methods, and he is guided by
selfish motives of the revolutionist; and he would
plunge our peaceful land into the turmoil and discord
of perpetual conflict."
Why would any man or group do that?
* * * *
Artificial Hearsteria is created in about this man
ner:
You go into an emotional fit and by suggestion,
insinuation, and repetition others will become excited
too. Yoti appeal to every emotion the individual or
the group may have. You arouse these emotions and
then you sustain them until your end is won. If there
are no appropriate attitudes of prejudices to be
appealed to —you create them. If you have no facts
on which to base your Hearsterical appeals—create
them too, even if you have to resort to lies, forgery,
exaggeration, misrepresentation, and censorship.
Again turning to the jaundiced journalism of Mr.
Hearst we find abundant examples of stolen letters,
forged documents, falsified documents, faked photo
graphs, imaginary interviews, fictitious claims, ex
aggerated reports, deleted statements, and misleading
headlines—all to furnish the missing basis of emo
tional appeal.
We find there, also, artificially created waves of
Hearsteria over the RED MENACE of BOLSHEVISM,
COMMUNISM in th<- COLLEGES, THE YELLOW
PERIL, THE FREEDOM of the PRESS, The FLIGHT
of CAPITAL from income taxing CALIFORNIA, the
INIQUIIY of the WORLD COURT (or better, the
LEAGUE of NATIONS COURT), the IMBECILITY
of DISARMAMENT, the SEDITION of the PACIFIST
TERMITES.
Tomorrow, >Ir. Saadi leaves .Mr. Hearst and
shows evidences of Hearsteria in the coming elec
tion.

To see how the other half does it, A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke sent to the National
Student Federation for information on honor
systems in several of the Eastern colleges.
Because honor systems in the Stanford sense
of the phrase seem to he a Western product
exclusively, however, the report won't help
the panel much in solving the "how to en
force it" problem.
The University of Alabama was the only
college mentioned in the report which openly
admitted it had a student code of honor. But
to enforce it, they say shamelessly, faculty
members remain in the rooms during exami
nations.
At the University of Chicago they don't even
have student government, let alone an honor
system. Nebraska claims that neither the fac
ulty nor the students are interested in having
an honor code. Dartmouth and the University
of Georgia have no honor system, but are in
terested in the subject. Vassal* and the Uni
versity of Illinois claim they are getting along
well enough without a definite honor system.
This group represents a fair cross-section
of east-of-the-Mississippi colleges. The facts
speak for themselves. Even these skeleton re
ports show rather clearly that Stanford and
other Western schools are far and away ahead
of the East in student government as well as
in codes of honor.

our hero caused with such editorial tid-bits as this:
The bullet that pierced Goebel's chest
Cannot be found in the West;
Good reason, it is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier.
Another:
Institutions, like men, will last un.til they die; and
if bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of
only by killing, then the killing must be done.
Was it any wonder that President Theodore Roose
velt believed the assassination of McKinley was due to
such Hearsterical promptings?

What is this technique we call Hearsteria? Why
is it practiced?
The answer is simple.
Hearsterical people don't think. They are more
easily frightened into doing something they wouldn't
rationally do. Their reason is dulled and their emo
tions are aroused. They are less critical of the de
mands placed before them, less likely to see the ulterior
motive.
Here is what Elihu Root thought of Hearsteria in
1906:
"It is not the calm and lawful redress of wrongs
which he seeks; it is the turmoil of inflamed passions
and the terrorism of revengeful force; he spreads the
spirit, he follows the methods, and he is guided by
selfish motives of the revolutionist; and he would
plunge our peaceful land into the turmoil and discord
of perpetual conflict."
Why would any man or group do that?
* * * *
Artificial Hearsteria is created in about this man
ner:
You go into an emotional fit and by suggestion,
insinuation, and repetition others will become excited
too. Yoti appeal to every emotion the individual or
the group may have. You arouse these emotions and
then you sustain them until your end is won. If there
are no appropriate attitudes of prejudices to be
appealed to —you create them. If you have no facts
on which to base your Hearsterical appeals—create
them too, even if you have to resort to lies, forgery,
exaggeration, misrepresentation, and censorship.
Again turning to the jaundiced journalism of Mr.
Hearst we find abundant examples of stolen letters,
forged documents, falsified documents, faked photo
graphs, imaginary interviews, fictitious claims, ex
aggerated reports, deleted statements, and misleading
headlines—all to furnish the missing basis of emo
tional appeal.
We find there, also, artificially created waves of
Hearsteria over the RED MENACE of BOLSHEVISM,
COMMUNISM in th<- COLLEGES, THE YELLOW
PERIL, THE FREEDOM of the PRESS, The FLIGHT
of CAPITAL from income taxing CALIFORNIA, the
INIQUIIY of the WORLD COURT (or better, the
LEAGUE of NATIONS COURT), the IMBECILITY
of DISARMAMENT, the SEDITION of the PACIFIST
TERMITES.
Tomorrow, >Ir. Saadi leaves .Mr. Hearst and
shows evidences of Hearsteria in the coming elec
tion.

To see how the other half does it, A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke sent to the National
Student Federation for information on honor
systems in several of the Eastern colleges.
Because honor systems in the Stanford sense
of the phrase seem to he a Western product
exclusively, however, the report won't help
the panel much in solving the "how to en
force it" problem.
The University of Alabama was the only
college mentioned in the report which openly
admitted it had a student code of honor. But
to enforce it, they say shamelessly, faculty
members remain in the rooms during exami
nations.
At the University of Chicago they don't even
have student government, let alone an honor
system. Nebraska claims that neither the fac
ulty nor the students are interested in having
an honor code. Dartmouth and the University
of Georgia have no honor system, but are in
terested in the subject. Vassal* and the Uni
versity of Illinois claim they are getting along
well enough without a definite honor system.
This group represents a fair cross-section
of east-of-the-Mississippi colleges. The facts
speak for themselves. Even these skeleton re
ports show rather clearly that Stanford and
other Western schools are far and away ahead
of the East in student government as well as
in codes of honor.
(Editor's Note: Mr. Saadi today describes
"hearsteria" in his second article on the propa
ganda that will feature the coming presidential
campaign.)
The term Hearsteria is self-explaining. It connotes
hysteria, artificially created on a large scale. It is
called Hearsteria, not because Mr. Hearst is the sole
user of the technique, but because he, more than any
other man, has perfected it.
Starting with the now-famous cable Mr. Hearst sent
to his artists in Cuba in 1898 urging thern, "You fur
nish the pictures, I'll furnish the war," a student of
Hearsteria can find an abundance of illustrations.
Turn back the newspaper pages and see how success
fully he worked the nation into a high pitch of mad
ness. How he aroused emotion and fears and preju
dices with faked pictures of atrocities and catchy
slogans of "Remember the Main" and "Cuba libre!"
Find out how he increased the circulation of the
New York Journal from 500.000 to 1,600,000.

and the terrorism of revengeful force; he spreads the
spirit, he follows the methods, and he is guided by
selfish motives of the revolutionist; and he would
plunge our peaceful land into the turmoil and discord
of perpetual conflict."
Why would any man or group do that?

Artificial Hearsteria is created in about this man
ner:
You go into an emotional fit and by suggestion,
insinuation, and repetition others will become excited
too. Yoti appeal to every emotion the individual or
the group may have. You arouse these emotions and
then you sustain them until your end is won. If there
are no appropriate attitudes of prejudices to be
appealed to —you create them. If you have no facts
on which to base your Hearsterical appeals—create
them too, even if you have to resort to lies, forgery,
exaggeration, misrepresentation, and censorship.
Again turning to the jaundiced journalism of Mr.
Hearst we find abundant examples of stolen letters,
forged documents, falsified documents, faked photo
graphs, imaginary interviews, fictitious claims, ex
aggerated reports, deleted statements, and misleading
headlines—all to furnish the missing basis of emo
tional appeal.
We find there, also, artificially created waves of
Hearsteria over the RED MENACE of BOLSHEVISM,
COMMUNISM in th<- COLLEGES, THE YELLOW
PERIL, THE FREEDOM of the PRESS, The FLIGHT
of CAPITAL from income taxing CALIFORNIA, the
INIQUIIY of the WORLD COURT (or better, the
LEAGUE of NATIONS COURT), the IMBECILITY
of DISARMAMENT, the SEDITION of the PACIFIST
TERMITES.
Tomorrow, >Ir. Saadi leaves .Mr. Hearst and
shows evidences of Hearsteria in the coming elec
tion.

To see how the other half does it, A.S.S.U.
President Wally Brooke sent to the National
Student Federation for information on honor
systems in several of the Eastern colleges.
Because honor systems in the Stanford sense
of the phrase seem to he a Western product
exclusively, however, the report won't help
the panel much in solving the "how to en
force it" problem.
The University of Alabama was the only
college mentioned in the report which openly
admitted it had a student code of honor. But
to enforce it, they say shamelessly, faculty
members remain in the rooms during exami
nations.
At the University of Chicago they don't even
have student government, let alone an honor
system. Nebraska claims that neither the fac
ulty nor the students are interested in having
an honor code. Dartmouth and the University
of Georgia have no honor system, but are in
terested in the subject. Vassal* and the Uni
versity of Illinois claim they are getting along
well enough without a definite honor system.
This group represents a fair cross-section
of east-of-the-Mississippi colleges. The facts
speak for themselves. Even these skeleton re
ports show rather clearly that Stanford and
other Western schools are far and away ahead
of the East in student government as well as
in codes of honor.
(Editor's Note: Mr. Saadi today describes
"hearsteria" in his second article on the propa
ganda that will feature the coming presidential
campaign.)
The term Hearsteria is self-explaining. It connotes
hysteria, artificially created on a large scale. It is
called Hearsteria, not because Mr. Hearst is the sole
user of the technique, but because he, more than any
other man, has perfected it.
Starting with the now-famous cable Mr. Hearst sent
to his artists in Cuba in 1898 urging thern, "You fur
nish the pictures, I'll furnish the war," a student of
Hearsteria can find an abundance of illustrations.
Turn back the newspaper pages and see how success
fully he worked the nation into a high pitch of mad
ness. How he aroused emotion and fears and preju
dices with faked pictures of atrocities and catchy
slogans of "Remember the Main" and "Cuba libre!"
Find out how he increased the circulation of the
New York Journal from 500.000 to 1,600,000.

Then turn your attention to the fit of Hearsteria
our hero caused with such editorial tid-bits as this:
The bullet that pierced Goebel's chest
Cannot be found in the West;
Good reason, it is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier.
Another:
Institutions, like men, will last un.til they die; and
if bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of
only by killing, then the killing must be done.
Was it any wonder that President Theodore Roose
velt believed the assassination of McKinley was due to
such Hearsterical promptings?

What is this technique we call Hearsteria? Why
is it practiced?
The answer is simple.
Hearsterical people don't think. They are more
easily frightened into doing something they wouldn't
rationally do. Their reason is dulled and their emo
tions are aroused. They are less critical of the de
mands placed before them, less likely to see the ulterior
motive.
Here is what Elihu Root thought of Hearsteria in
1906:
"It is not the calm and lawful redress of wrongs
which he seeks; it is the turmoil of inflamed passions
and the terrorism of revengeful force; he spreads the
spirit, he follows the methods, and he is guided by
selfish motives of the revolutionist; and he would
plunge our peaceful land into the turmoil and discord
of perpetual conflict."
