Crunch, munch
Strawberry Brunch,
Carl Ravazza in the plaza;
The committee thinks it's pretty snazza,
The committee hazza snazza jazza in the Plaza.

The berry's a sunch.
Speaking of unusual diets, there is a Zeta Psi sopho
more who eats spiders and pollywogs. Though some
unkind people might say that he is just an exhibition
ist, the general conclusion is that he thinks he's a
Stanford Indian, or maybe a Zeta Psi sophomore.
But he's a dental cripple just the same.
A hungry Beta junior who smoots to kill is also a
dietician tactician. He heft a great big lobster trap in
the middle of his room. So far, it seems he has not
caught any lobsters, but he has certainly caught lots
of Betas.
But he's a mental cripple just the same.
A couple of D.G.'s one Friday night didn't want to
admit that they didn't have dates, although they
wanted to go to the show. So instead of riding down
to the megalopolis on the Paly Transit, they charterÂ®!
a taxi, and embarrassed about announcing the fact
that they were going to the show alone, they told the
driver to take them to Tinney's Funeral Home.
The driver was a bit startled at this. After they
rode along for a while, he turned around, and said,
"That's a rather unusual place to be going at this
time of night, isn't it?" .
"Yes," they admitted. "You see, we're friends of
theirs."
That's fine," said the driver, 'I am too. Just knock
on the door, ask for Ray, and tell him I sent you."
Then the driver added: "Well, I've always heard
that Stanford women were dead, but I didn't know it
had got this bad yet."
