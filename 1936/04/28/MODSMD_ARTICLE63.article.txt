RAY NOBLE, popular English
I composer, was the only band leader
j in the world without a band until he
I came to New York. Whenever he
| had an engagement or made a new
record, he assembled the best avail
j able musicians, rehearsed, conduct
ed, and disbanded them. Another
| paradox in his career: he was trained
to write classic music but won his
success in popular music.
