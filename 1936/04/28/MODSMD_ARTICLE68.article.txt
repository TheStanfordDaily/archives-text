## FOR THE KIDDIES—REMEMBER? 
### 
Except for a taste and an odor, ,
i the Masque Ball is over. The taste i
is readily explainable—it is possibly
! still in your mouth.
The odor is not so readily ex
' plainable. But it's there, and for i

i those whose noses
t are more sensitive
i than tneir stom- .
; achs, it definitely S
dwarfs the taste. J
The smell start- 1
| ed somewhere on *
I the Row, accord
j ing to the halls,
! about the Friday
j before The Fi'i-fl|
day. 8
! As Dor Tag ap- T
! proached, the
I odor grew more

and more terrific. As it got terrifick
er, nature compensated and the
odor-smellei - s got more and more j
used to it.

About last Monday it crept out of j
' the sisterhoods and into the broth
] erhoods while a big cloud of it i
I broke loose in Lagunita cow-ses- j
sions.
Meanwhile, that clinking you
heard was not the exploding of gas
shells, nor was it the Comptroller's
Oflice clearing the counting house
for next Registration Day. That
clinking, it is said, was the Thetas,
or the Pi Phis, or the Chi O's, or
even the Tri Delts, or even perhaps
and possibly the Lagunitans, all
tearing purses from around papa's
dough.
Being enterprising young ladies,
they didn't stop there. We under
stand the Convalescent Home con
i tribution of an administration ex
ecutive accidentally went on a
queen's nose, although the poor ex- j
ecutive was betting on the Home 1
Kiddies.

As befits the most successful
Masque Ball in years, there were no
casualties. No one caught their fin
gers between a couple of spinning ;
dollars or sorority steam-rollers.
. nor was anyone gassed into nausea.
The King-Queen Job was almost
as successful and colossal as re- 1
gards industrial safety as the Golden
Gate Bridge. Perhaps even more so. j
Bridge engineers allow one death for
' each $1,000,000 worth of construc

tion.
As for the money itself, in the end
it all went into one pot as what
doesn't. But because the final des
tination is up-and-up, is that any
reason for putting the coin through

a couple of phony fare-boxes?
Moral: To all you gals whose hors<
scratched, next time try India!
Broom. It sweeps clean.
