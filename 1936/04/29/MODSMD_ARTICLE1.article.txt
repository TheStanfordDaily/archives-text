# China Quake, Famine Take Heavy Toll
## Hunger – crazed Victims Resort to Cannibalism; Children Sold for Food 
### 
CHUNGKING, Szechwan Prov
ince, China, April 28 (A 3 ). —This city,
surrounded by a countryside in the
throes of starvation, was shaken to
day by a heavy earthquake.
The earthquake caused only small
damage in the city, but the alarm
was great.
The area of the quake was be
lieved to extend throughout West
China, over Szechwan and Kansu
provinces, where there was no way
of determining immediately how
great the damage may have been.
Shock Hits Tuchienlu
The shock followed one which, oc
curring yesterday, hit Tachienlu on
the Tibetan border. It was the
worst recorded in many years.
A terrible famine sweeping Szech
wan and North Honan province as
sumed the proportions of a national
disaster today with estimates of the
number of natives dead or facing
death ranging from 10,000,000 to
30,000,000.
Chinese vernacular newspapers
reported that some hunger-mad
dened victims were resorting to
cannibalism and that other starving
parents were selling their children
to gain money for food.
Floods Are Cause
The appalling conditions were at
tributed to repeated floods, followed
by unusually dry summers, and to
successive disastrous incursions by
Chinese Communist soldiers who
have swept the country like a plague
of locusts in the last two years.
Soldiers and civilians alike have
resorted to violence to obtain food
for themselves and their starving
families.
Bands of armed men, numbering
from 1000 to 5000, are roving the
countryside, terrorizing, plundering,
kidnaping and killing.
Disease Spreads
In some sections of Szechwan
Province, in West . China proper,
once China's "great granary," more
than 70 per cent of the towns and
villages have been destroyed by
Chinese Communist soldiers who
have themselves been unpaid and
are starving.
While millions of Chinese are fac
ing certain death from starvation,
other millions are suffering "defi
ciency" diseases which American
and other missionary doctors say
must lead inevitably to death.

must lead inevitably to death.
CHUNGKING, Szechwan Prov
ince, China, April 28 (A 3 ). —This city,
surrounded by a countryside in the
throes of starvation, was shaken to
day by a heavy earthquake.
The earthquake caused only small
damage in the city, but the alarm
was great.
The area of the quake was be
lieved to extend throughout West
China, over Szechwan and Kansu
provinces, where there was no way
of determining immediately how
great the damage may have been.
Shock Hits Tuchienlu
The shock followed one which, oc
curring yesterday, hit Tachienlu on
the Tibetan border. It was the
worst recorded in many years.
A terrible famine sweeping Szech
wan and North Honan province as
sumed the proportions of a national
disaster today with estimates of the
number of natives dead or facing
death ranging from 10,000,000 to
30,000,000.
Chinese vernacular newspapers
reported that some hunger-mad
dened victims were resorting to
cannibalism and that other starving
parents were selling their children
to gain money for food.
Floods Are Cause
The appalling conditions were at
tributed to repeated floods, followed
by unusually dry summers, and to
successive disastrous incursions by
Chinese Communist soldiers who
have swept the country like a plague
of locusts in the last two years.
Soldiers and civilians alike have
resorted to violence to obtain food
for themselves and their starving
families.
Bands of armed men, numbering
from 1000 to 5000, are roving the
countryside, terrorizing, plundering,
kidnaping and killing.
Disease Spreads
In some sections of Szechwan
Province, in West . China proper,
once China's "great granary," more
than 70 per cent of the towns and
villages have been destroyed by
Chinese Communist soldiers who
have themselves been unpaid and
are starving.
While millions of Chinese are fac
ing certain death from starvation,
other millions are suffering "defi
ciency" diseases which American
and other missionary doctors say
must lead inevitably to death.
