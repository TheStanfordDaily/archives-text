# 'Fool College Kid' Proved Safe Driver
## 
### Dave Botsford 
"Some fool college kid!" I
When a bright blue roadster darts '
in front of a motorist on the high
way, almost crashes into an oncom- j
ing car, drivers sputter some oath,
blame it on a "college kid."
College Drivers Educated
Fact is, under the direction and
guidance of the National Student |
Federation of which Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur is an adviser, colleges and
universities all over the land are
developing traffic safety and educa
tion campaigns, proving that the
"college kid" is one of the safest
of American drivers.
Ohio State, Antioch, Centre, Ben- '
nington, and Alabama are notable
for their student-conducted safety
programs.
Ohio Has Police School
Ohio State's principal safety prob
lem of Columbius' main boulevard,
which brings a heavy traffic volume
smack through the campus. Parking
spots are scarce, and pedestrian
troubles are many.
The college, as a result., has not \
only placed two campus officers on i
the dangerous section, but has put it.s
academic resources to work. Every
six months the University holds a |

1 police school, emphasizing traffic.
The psychology department is sur
veying the traffic problem and re
cently gave a preliminary report be
fore the Ohio Academy of Science.
Students Hold Traffic Court
Students tagged by officers appear
before a Student Court whose seven
| justices are elected by the student
' senate. The court is operated under
the regular judicial procedure, with
prosecuting attorney, bailiffs, and
clerks. Its verdict may be appealed
to the University president.
Cars Inspected
Antioch, another Ohio school, re
| quires official inspection of student
cars twice a year. Under a Student
1 Traffic Committee, safety propagan
da is posted and distributed, and
! adequate insurance is compulsory.
Drivers planning out-of-town trips
must register before the committee
and receive the dean's approval.
Traffic accident reduction, author
ities assert, is a gradual process
achieved by continuous application
i of the fundamental principles of en
i forcement, engineering and educa
tion. The National Student Federa
tion and its intercollegiate safety
| program aims at permanent control.

"Some fool college kid!" I
When a bright blue roadster darts '
in front of a motorist on the high
way, almost crashes into an oncom- j
ing car, drivers sputter some oath,
blame it on a "college kid."
College Drivers Educated
Fact is, under the direction and
guidance of the National Student |
Federation of which Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur is an adviser, colleges and
universities all over the land are
developing traffic safety and educa
tion campaigns, proving that the
"college kid" is one of the safest
of American drivers.
Ohio State, Antioch, Centre, Ben- '
nington, and Alabama are notable
for their student-conducted safety
programs.
Ohio Has Police School
Ohio State's principal safety prob
lem of Columbius' main boulevard,
which brings a heavy traffic volume
smack through the campus. Parking
spots are scarce, and pedestrian
troubles are many.
The college, as a result., has not \
only placed two campus officers on i
the dangerous section, but has put it.s
academic resources to work. Every
six months the University holds a |

1 police school, emphasizing traffic.
The psychology department is sur
veying the traffic problem and re
cently gave a preliminary report be
fore the Ohio Academy of Science.
Students Hold Traffic Court
Students tagged by officers appear
before a Student Court whose seven
| justices are elected by the student
' senate. The court is operated under
the regular judicial procedure, with
prosecuting attorney, bailiffs, and
clerks. Its verdict may be appealed
to the University president.
Cars Inspected
Antioch, another Ohio school, re
| quires official inspection of student
cars twice a year. Under a Student
1 Traffic Committee, safety propagan
da is posted and distributed, and
! adequate insurance is compulsory.
Drivers planning out-of-town trips
must register before the committee
