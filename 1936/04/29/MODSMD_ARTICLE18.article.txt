# King Fuad Dies Leaving Egypt In Political Strife
## Throne Passes to 16-year old Prince under Regency for Two Years 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, April 28 (/P). —
Egypt's King Fuad I died today a
few hours after he had insisted he
would not, and the throne of the
ancient Pharaohs passed to a 16-
year-old boy.
"I am not going to die," whispered
the 68-year-old monarch from his
death-bed shortly before the end.
But he succumbed, despite an en- 1
couraging morning rally.
He will be buried in El Raifai
Mosque, a hillside citadel he built
himself facing across the Nile to
ward the Sahara desert.
.Political strife which has torn the
country in recent months, including
bloody anti-British rioting, was com
plicated by the death of Fuad,
placed in power by Great Britain
during World War days.
His only son, 16-year-old Crown
Prince Farouk, who is studying in
England, was notified of the death.
The youthful new monarch, who
was preparing for entrance to the
Royal Military Academy, at Wool
wich, is expected to return here to
face a life sharply contrasting with
schoolboy days in England.
Farouk, who is 6 feet tall, will
reign under a regency for two years,
but the exact procedure is confused,
owing to the fact that the constitu
tion of 1923 provides regents can
not function until they have taken
an oath in the presence of Parlia
ment.
Fuad was suffering from a gan
grenous infection in his throat
which prevented him from taking
food, but the cause of his death was
ascribed to heart trouble, which
brought on a gradual weakening of
the circulation.
