## 'June Moon' Authors Tops For Satire, Stories 
### 
George S. Kaufman and Ring
Lardner, authors of "June Moon," j
to be presented in the Assembly Hall
on May 8, were, until Lardner's;
death, one of the most widely known j
and acclaimed teams Broadway has j
ever known.
Each had been famous in his own '<
field before joining forces with the [
other. Kaufman had turned out sev
eral satirical dramatic hits while '
Lardner had long been popular as a j
short story writer.
Kaufman reached >his greatest ]
height, however, after the publica
tion of "June Moon." This was in i
1932 when, with Morrie Ryskind, he â– 
wrote "Of Thee I Sing," the Pulitzer
prize winner for that year. Among
his other better known plays are j
"Begger on Horseback," written with
Marc Connelly, "Butter and Egg
Man," "Morton of the Movies," j
"Once in a Lifetime," in collabora- j
tion with Moss Hart, "Royal Fam- j
ily," which he wrote with Edna Fer- j
ber, and "Dinner at Eight."
Lardner, before his death, was ;
considered one of the greatest, if not I
the greatest, of American short story !
writers. His satirical stories about j
the sport and theatrical world are
still considered as "tops."
