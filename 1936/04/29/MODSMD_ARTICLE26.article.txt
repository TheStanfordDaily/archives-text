# Nomination Plan Referred Back To |Sub|-|Committee
## Anderson Chosen Senior Man; Functional Representation Plan Dropped 
### 
Muck-raking last night went into
serial form, as Ex Committee de
cided that the investigation of nom
inating systems would be continued
next week.
A by-law providing that a caucus
be held to name Row candidates,
with the time of meeting to be pub
lished in advance and delegates to
be chosen by a majority vote of each
living group, was defeated. "Would
only result in secret pre-pre-cau
cuses," prophesied Bob Gros.
Assembly Proposed
Ken Livingston raised a "small
cry from the wilderness' 'and sug
gested an all-University assembly to
introduce candidates, to make the
campaign one of issue and personal
ity rather than machine. "Political
parties might be a good idea," sug
gested Betty Grover.
A sub-committee composed of
Chick Franich, Jackie Brown, Jean
Anderson, Gib Holloway, and Hank
Luisetti will survey possible substi
tute methods of nominating, to be
presented next week.
ROY ANDERSON will fill the po
sition of senior man, vacated by
the acceptance of Bobby Grayson's
resignation.
CREAMER'S AMENDMENT, per
fected and purified, was again resur
rected. Five minutes later it retired
for further renovation. Ten minutes
later it was dropped completely.
The plan called originally for a
functional system of representation
on Ex Committee, except for a pres
ident and vice-president.
"We have complete functional
representation now, even though
by chance," commented Gros. "The -
present plan is far more impartial.
A board with the power invested
in this committee should definitely
be chosen by the students at
large."
"I object.—this has been a serious
attempt of Dick's to do something,"
said Chick Franich.
"I move we give him a vote of
thanks," suggested Millard Browne,
closing the issue.
DELEGATES to the Harvard Ter
centenary Convention this summer
will be Wilson Footer and Betty
Grover. An expense account of two
dollars per day for the three-day
period was voted for each.
APPOINTMENT BY-LAW, the
dubiously constitutional storm cen
ter of the past three meetings, will be
inserted with due ceremony under
"Miscellaneous," according to Dean
Marion Kirkwood.
BOOK STORE REBATES will go
toward both the Student Aid Fund
($2000) and toward the Book Store
reserve fund ($1000).
YACHTING may become a future
minor sport at Stanford. The Col
legiate Regatta, newly organized
this year, will probably be entered
by a Stanford boat, as over 30 men
have offered to participate. Final
naming of a crew will be done after
further research.
FLYING CLUB w?s officially rec
ognized as a student organization.
Twenty members, all licensed pilots,
have as their goal arousal of inter
est in flying. Dues will go toward
"clubroom furniture, plane repairs,
or a dance."
"We may hold a contest —bomb-
dropping, for instance," said Henry
God man.
"Let Ex Commillce designate the
target," requested Bob Gros.
