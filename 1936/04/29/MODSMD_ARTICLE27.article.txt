THE PRESIDENT'S sensational
tax measure is going the way of all
too-hot-to-handle election year bills.
The Senate Finance Committee
and the House Ways and Means
Committee are ready to tear the
thing apart bit by bit. Members of
these two committees are largely
anti-tax die-hards, and on top of
that they are irked because the
President handed them the hot tax
potato and then clammed up and
they haven't heard from him since.
TIIE COMMITTEES decided that
if the boss wasn't there to show
them what to do with the hot potato,
they were going to do their best to
cool it off. They've air conditioned
the thing by riddling it with so
many exemptions that it resembles
nothing so much as a Swiss cheese.
It seems that certain exemptions
had to be made for small corpora
tions who found themselves in the
red and had depended on piling up
surpluses to meet their obligations.
Once Congressmen begin making
exemptions, there is no stopping the
movement and like a juggernaut it
rolls every bit of effectiveness out of
a bill.
THE BILL RAISED a furore of
protest when the President intro
duced it and it has run into so
many difficulties that there is little
hope for it to come through in any
shape resembling its original form.
Now ambiguously worded, the bill
is a maze of verbose meanderings
incomprehensibly strung end to end,
;ind no one in Washington knows
how much money it will raise.
What may finally result from the
President's plan for redistributing
wealth may be so deformed that it
will have to be completely junked,
and the committees will evolve a
new measure embodying a tax on
undistributed profits plus the old,
reliable, and much used corporation
levies of previous years.
THE CHRONICLE has begun a
series of graphs appearing each
Sunday showing the stock market in
presidential years. The first one, the
McKinley-Bryan election of 1900,
gives you the cold dope, showing the
sharp drop in June and September
of that year—months when the in
dustrial East thought Bryan might
be elected and they shivered in their
boots.
Bryan didn't run on his free silver
platform but the Easterners knew
what he stood for and knew of his
strength in the Mid-west and South.
His platform was in opposition to oc
cupation of the Philippines. When
it looked most like a Bryan victory
in September, also the time of the
coal strike, the market slumped way
down. The day following McKin
ley's election, the average daily
closing prices of 12 leading indus
trial stocks shot upward and within
a week had gained nine points.
THE GRAPHS are an interesting
picture of a very queer institution
in American life. Stock markets
.seem to be just about the touchiest
things in the world, especially dur
ing an election year. They're like
sea anemones, or a snail, or a hermit
crab—they all recoil on being
touched.
Let's hope that the market hasn't
been going up so steadily this year
in hopes of a Republican winning
the presidency. If that is the case,
you can expect the worst market
crash in history on the first Tuesday
after the first Monday of November
in this year of our Lord 1936.

Bryan didn't run on his free silver
platform but the Easterners knew
what he stood for and knew of his
strength in the Mid-west and South.
His platform was in opposition to oc
cupation of the Philippines. When
it looked most like a Bryan victory
in September, also the time of the
coal strike, the market slumped way
down. The day following McKin
ley's election, the average daily
closing prices of 12 leading indus
trial stocks shot upward and within
a week had gained nine points.
THE GRAPHS are an interesting
picture of a very queer institution
in American life. Stock markets
.seem to be just about the touchiest
things in the world, especially dur
ing an election year. They're like
sea anemones, or a snail, or a hermit
crab—they all recoil on being
touched.
Let's hope that the market hasn't
been going up so steadily this year
in hopes of a Republican winning
the presidency. If that is the case,
you can expect the worst market
crash in history on the first Tuesday
after the first Monday of November
in this year of our Lord 1936.
THE PRESIDENT'S sensational
tax measure is going the way of all
too-hot-to-handle election year bills.
The Senate Finance Committee
and the House Ways and Means
Committee are ready to tear the
thing apart bit by bit. Members of
these two committees are largely
anti-tax die-hards, and on top of
that they are irked because the
President handed them the hot tax
potato and then clammed up and
they haven't heard from him since.
TIIE COMMITTEES decided that
if the boss wasn't there to show
them what to do with the hot potato,
they were going to do their best to
cool it off. They've air conditioned
the thing by riddling it with so
many exemptions that it resembles
nothing so much as a Swiss cheese.
It seems that certain exemptions
had to be made for small corpora
tions who found themselves in the
red and had depended on piling up
surpluses to meet their obligations.
Once Congressmen begin making
exemptions, there is no stopping the
movement and like a juggernaut it
rolls every bit of effectiveness out of
a bill.
THE BILL RAISED a furore of
protest when the President intro
duced it and it has run into so
many difficulties that there is little
hope for it to come through in any
shape resembling its original form.
Now ambiguously worded, the bill
is a maze of verbose meanderings
incomprehensibly strung end to end,
;ind no one in Washington knows
how much money it will raise.
What may finally result from the
President's plan for redistributing
wealth may be so deformed that it
will have to be completely junked,
and the committees will evolve a
new measure embodying a tax on
undistributed profits plus the old,
reliable, and much used corporation
levies of previous years.
THE CHRONICLE has begun a
series of graphs appearing each
Sunday showing the stock market in
presidential years. The first one, the
McKinley-Bryan election of 1900,
gives you the cold dope, showing the
sharp drop in June and September
of that year—months when the in
dustrial East thought Bryan might
be elected and they shivered in their
boots.
