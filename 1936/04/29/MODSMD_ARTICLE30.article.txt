# First Measles, Now Flu No Rest For Health Service
## 
### 
Last spring it was the measles;
this spring it was the flu. The rest
of the time it's the possibility of
either one or both or a thousand
other epidemics that keeps the little
publicized University Health Service
always on its toes.
As far as numbers are concerned,
the department isn't so very large.
In fact, the staff consists of only
Director Walter H. Brown, who is
the president of the American
Health Service on the side—which,
incidentally, is one of the greatest
honors an American physician can
attain—and Miss Yvonne Fay, one
of whose more interesting duties is
getting illness biographies out of
campus Chinese chefs.
Periodically a few professional
inspectors join the staff to circulate
about the Farm, checking up on
cleanliness of the back yards, swim
ming pools, kitchens of the dorms
and houses, and so on. But the bulk

of the responsibility for preventing
campus epidemics falls on the shoul
ders of Dr. Brown and Miss Fay.
Just what do they do to combat
sickness waves before they come?
First of all they receive all sus
pected cases of communicable di
seases on the campus. Observation
is made from day to day of every
patient. If the disease develops, the
patient is confined to the hospital.
Then the real work begins. Room
mates of the patient are notified
and examined. The house director is
notified, and the patient's room is
completely cleaned, re-linened, and
so forth. Day to day check up from
the department continues, and it as
sumes responsibility for keeping
their patient in out of the way of
others.
Sometimes this is a pretty big as
signment—especially when it means
keeping a 200-pound footballer with
a slight case of German measles
from a week-end trip to Carmel. If
the footballer is too insistent and the
case of German meases too slight, it
means contacting Carmel health au
thorities and escorting the patient to
the seashore.
Then, too, the department con
ducts a rigid examination of campus
food-handlers. Restrictions are
great, and complete examinations
are frequent, so Stanford cooks are
just about the pick of the lot.
The real reasons for epidemics are
neglect of "slight colds" and other
insignificant ailments, Miss Fay
points out. The Administration has

provided the weapon to make all
campus vacations to the hospital im
possible. It just remains for the stu
dents to give it a chance!

the department isn't so very large.
In fact, the staff consists of only
Director Walter H. Brown, who is
the president of the American
Health Service on the side—which,
incidentally, is one of the greatest
honors an American physician can
attain—and Miss Yvonne Fay, one
of whose more interesting duties is
getting illness biographies out of
campus Chinese chefs.
Periodically a few professional
inspectors join the staff to circulate
about the Farm, checking up on
cleanliness of the back yards, swim
ming pools, kitchens of the dorms
and houses, and so on. But the bulk

of the responsibility for preventing
campus epidemics falls on the shoul
ders of Dr. Brown and Miss Fay.
Just what do they do to combat
sickness waves before they come?
First of all they receive all sus
pected cases of communicable di
seases on the campus. Observation
is made from day to day of every
patient. If the disease develops, the
patient is confined to the hospital.
Then the real work begins. Room
mates of the patient are notified
and examined. The house director is
notified, and the patient's room is
completely cleaned, re-linened, and
so forth. Day to day check up from
the department continues, and it as
sumes responsibility for keeping
their patient in out of the way of
others.
Sometimes this is a pretty big as
signment—especially when it means
keeping a 200-pound footballer with
a slight case of German measles
from a week-end trip to Carmel. If
the footballer is too insistent and the
case of German meases too slight, it
means contacting Carmel health au
thorities and escorting the patient to
the seashore.
Then, too, the department con
ducts a rigid examination of campus
food-handlers. Restrictions are
great, and complete examinations
are frequent, so Stanford cooks are
just about the pick of the lot.
The real reasons for epidemics are
neglect of "slight colds" and other
insignificant ailments, Miss Fay
points out. The Administration has

provided the weapon to make all
campus vacations to the hospital im
possible. It just remains for the stu
dents to give it a chance!
Last spring it was the measles;
this spring it was the flu. The rest
of the time it's the possibility of
either one or both or a thousand
other epidemics that keeps the little
publicized University Health Service
always on its toes.
As far as numbers are concerned,
the department isn't so very large.
