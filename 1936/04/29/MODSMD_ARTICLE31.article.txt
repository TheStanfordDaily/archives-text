## Lawyer Is Called Before Committee of Congress; Says Lobby Cost $22,500 
### 
LOS ANGELES, April 28 t/P).â€” !
O. Otto Moore, Denver lawyer, told
a congressional subcommittee today
that Robert E. Clements when sec
retary-treasurer of the Townsend
old age pension movement, once
said:
"We don't care a damn about the j
old people."
Moore said Clements made the re
mark at a meeting of Townsend I
leaders in a Washington, D.C., hotel '
in reply to a question by Mrs. W. M. |
Marshall of Colorado Springs, Colo,,
who had asked: "What are the old
people going to do? They're ex
pecting so much."
Moore was the first witness called
by the subcommittee opening hear- j
ings here into the Townsend move- j
ment. He said at least $22,500 was i
raised to support the Townsend I
lobby in Washington last year.
Moore said he was a member of
the delegation sent to Washington !
in 1935 to urge legislation embody- j
ing a $200 monthly pension for all
persons over 60.
"How much money was raised by
the Townsend movement to send j
this delegation to Washington?" I
asked James Sullivan, special coun
sel for the subcommittee.
"Mr. Clements told me in March, j
1935, it was $22,500. I myself knew i
of other funds that were raised
later," Moore replied.
Clements was co-founder with Dr. |
Francis E. Townsend of the old age j
pension movement.
