## STRANGE FATE OF CARD TRACK CAPTAINS 
### 
With Sammy Klopstock chosen
captain of the 1936 track team, the
question arises in bull session cir
cles, especially among those who are
riot overly familiar with the past few
years of Cardinal track history,
why the captain was not picked ex
actly one year ago, as is the custom.
It almost suffices to say that the
main reason is that the past six —
count 'em, no more, no less—track
captains on the Farm have not been
acquainted with even normal or av
erage physical health and well being.
It may be superstition or a mystic
voodoo jinx of some sort, but it
surely is the reality and a matter of
record.
So after A1 Blackman, last year's
leader, pulled a muscle in practice
last spring and was unfit for big
time competition thereafter, it was
just taken for granted that we would
have no captain to flip !!*• coins this
spring.
Sammy's election comes at the
right time —after the two "senti
ment" meets with Cal and Troy are
done and before the national com
petition gets under way.
For a matter of record and general
interest let us go back six years
when this captain hoodoo made itself
a jarring and evil reality to Stanford
track teams.
