# FOR SIX YEARS CAPTAIN BEWITCHED
## 
### 
1930: Eric Krenz, captain. Krenz
brake the world's record in the dis
cus throw at 163.8 in his junior year.
The year after he graduated he was
drowned in Emerald Bay, Lake
Tahoe.
1931: Podge Smith, captain. The
best high hurdler on the Coast at the
lime, he was bothered all through
the important April meets with a re
curring muscle injury that was a
constant threat to his peak form
over the barriers.
1932: Alvin "Ike" Hables, captain.
Although not smitten as many times
as his hard-luck brother, Abe Ike
had flu, pneumonia, and muscle in
juries during his captaincy and took
a leave of absence during his last
winter quarter.
1933: Benjamin Bangs Bast man,
captain. World record holder in
half-dozen middle-distance events,
and first man to crack 47 seconds in
the quarter. Pulled muscle April
10. 1933, pacing A1 Blackmail in a
practice meet quarter, never as good
since that day, and not able to go
into the big meets at all that year.
1934: Gus Meier, captain. 1.C.4-A.
high hurdles champion. Hit a low
hurdle in a March preliminary meet,
seriously fractured his arm and
wrist bones, never hurdles since.
1935: A1 Blackmail, captain: I.C.
-A. 440 champion. Pulled a muscle
on backstretch of Angell Field track
in practice early last year, out of all
of big competition, only recently re
turning to form after a year of work
and gambling against the bad mem
ber.
So, although fhe number of col
lt .L'c people who hold stock in super
stitious omens is very few, we'll
have to agree that the past six years
of hard luck on our track captains
is a factor not to be piffled at, and a
factor definite enough to warranl
tin present wide berth accorded bj)
this week's late election. â€”Breed
