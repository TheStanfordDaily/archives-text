# Sam Klopstock Elected 1936 Track Captain
## Templeton Wary of Jinx, Delays Naming Leader Until Big Meet Is Over 
### 
Sam Klopstock, stellar senior
hurdler, was yesterday elected cap
tain of Dink Templeton's varsity
track team for the remainder of the
1936 season.
Templeton, wary of selecting a
captain at all this year because of
ihe infallible hard luck that has
dogged track captains of the past,
delayed the election until after the
Big Meet to give a new system a try.
Klopstock was co-captain of his
frosh team, holds the Stanford rec-

ord of 23.2 in the lows and 14.4 in
the highs, was 1.C.4-A. low hurdle
champ and N.C.A.A. high hurdle
champ in 1934. The boys imme
diately pounced upon him yester
day to enforce one of the oldest of
Stanford traditions—where a newly
elected captain .sets up the gedunks.
Meanwhile, preparations went for
ward for the Olympic Club meet
May 9. the next Cardinal competi
tion, with quarters the prescription
for those few who have straggled
back after the Big Meet campaign.
The 1.C.4-A.—Pacific Coast Inter
collegiates controversy is still just
that. The jist of the Cal tracksters'
conversation last Saturday was that
they were not especially interested
in having the new Coast affair over
there May 29 and 30; it has been an
nounced to be limited to 15 entrants
per school, in assistance to the
northern schools who will travel,
but a 15 entrant limitation will
seriously hamper the unbeatable
strength of U.S.C.
