# Hoop Men Open Spring Practice
## Varsity To Concentrate On Weaknesses 
### 
j With the Pavilion free once more
after the Masque Ball and the ping
pong tournament, which have pre
vented hoopsters from using the
floor, spring basketball practice
will start again Thursday afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
Since last season Coach John Bunn
has analyzed each player's game,
and has planned an individual type
of practice for each man. Varsity
candidates will follow these plans
for the next several weeks in order
to improve their weaker points.
Coach Bunn expects to devote the
last four weeks of the quarter to
organized play. This will be espe
cially valuable, since next year's
season will start earlier than usual.
Scrimmages will be held almost
daily during this period.
Yesterday afternoon Coach Bunn
had several of the 1936 varsity hoop
sters on the joor posing for pictures,
which were taken for coaching pur
poses in the future. They will be
t used in years to come to illustrate
| various positions to be assumed by
players in different shots, passes,
j catching rebounds, and other com
j mon situations.
A new hope for next year's squad
j is Dick Lyon, who was outstanding
| on the frosh team two years ago,
S but has taken this year off to travel
in Europe. Dick will return next fall
i as a sophomore.
| With all last year's championship

squad remaining in school and a
promising set of freshman hoopsteis'
trying out, next year'* basketball
geason*vlu)uld be especially success
ful.
Lightning does not flash but builds
up in a series of steps which have
been photographed.
