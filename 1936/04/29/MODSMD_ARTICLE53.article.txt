## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Ex Committee Categorically Disposes Of Plan for Functional Representation 
### 
Ex Committee last night very definitely
stepped on Dick Creamer's proposal for func
tional, rather than popular representation on
that body.
The long-awaited revised copy of Mr. ('.rea
mer's amendment met an even more concerted
disapproval than did the original draft, pre
sented over three months ago.
Reason for dropping the matter; The plan
even in its revised form did not, and appar
ently never could, overcome many disadvan
tages that far outweigh its one asserted ad
vantage of "combining ability with Ex Com
mittee power by something more than coin
cidence."
Among the more obvious objections: (1)
that no matter what the ratio of representa
tion, student democracy would be killed; (2)
that Hie plan would open itself up to too much

log-rolling by the various activity interests
represented; (3) that the members of a func
tional Ex Committee would be representing
their own activity, rather than the entire stu
dent body; (4) that it would make arbitrary
group distinctions that are not necessarily
proportionate to the organization's impor
tance and power as a student unit; (.">) that it
assumes the bureaucrats in control of the
activities are necessarily more capable than
any leader the student electorate could choose.
On the whole, however, it was fortunate the
plan was suggested last night. It gave Ex
ecutive Committee a chance, for once, to take
a definite stand; and il exonerated Mr. ('.rea
mer of any charge that may have been levied
to the effect that the proposal was a campaign
stunt. At any rate, Mr. Creamer appeared
wholly sincere.
