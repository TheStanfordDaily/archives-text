# Election By Propaganda

(IVIr. Saarii presents his third article explain
ing the nature of the propaganda war to he waged
in the coming presidential election.)
To the many inquiries that have been coming in,
let me say that though we offer the term Hearsteria in
honor of Wm. R. Hearst, we by no means limit the
practice to him.
Many other persons and groups have used and still
do use the technique. It was used to defeat LaFollette
as a Communist in 1924. The Hoover campaigners used
it to prove Smith was a puppet of the Pope in 1928,
and again they tried to frighten the voters in '32 with
slogans about "grass in city streets."
The New Deal resorted to Hearsteria in 1933 to
distract attention from its executive dictatorship and
to sell the NRA. The Merriam forces had to create
a state-wide Hearsteria in 1934 to defeat Sinclair, who
had already aroused a million voters into a religious
frenzy. To Father Coughlin goes the credit of the
national Hearsteria that killed our entry into the World
Court. The Senate Committee is still trying to deter
mine who was responsible for the Hearsteria that
almost defeated the Utility Holding Company bill.
Nor is the technique of Hearsteria limited to Demo
cratic America. The British Government in 1926 con
ducted a classic campaign, through its official Gazette,
to frigtyon the people and break the general strike.
(See how S.F. copied the stunt in 1934.)
In countries like Italy, Germany, and Russia,
Hearsteria is easier to create and maintain. This is due
to two things.
First of all, the dictators can at a moment's notice
create situations which will distract the attention of
the masses from the problems at. hand.
If Mussolini is afraid the people are getting hungry,
he starts a war with Ethiopia. This gives him an ex
cuse to take over more power and gives the people a
slogan to starve and die for.
When the voters in Germany are boisterous, Hitler
takes occasion to create a crisis; he leaves the League,
he rearms the nation, or he reoccupies the Rhineland.
Then (as if Hearsteria weren't enough) he asks his
people, "Are you for me, or are you for me?"
The second advantage a dictator has in creating
Hearsteria is his control of the news. He tells his
press what stories to tell and what issues to editorial
ize. He censors all stories which might in any way
lessen the state of Hearsteria.
Thus fictitious victories are forgotten. Atrocities
are invented and insults are exaggerated. Support is
magnified and criticism is belittled.
One more query should be cleared up. The term
Hearsteria is not intended to cast any evil insinuation
against anyone. The technique may be used equally
well for a good or bad motive.
Who is to say the Hearsteria of the Anti-Saloon
League is better than that of the wet Crusaders?
The Hearsterics promoted by the Ku Klux Klan, the
American Legion, the Townsendites, the Jew Baiters,
the Elizabeth Dillings, the Liberty Leaguers, the Re
publicans. the Democrats arc no less Hearsterical be
cause of their motive than that of the Fascists or Com
munists. '
We are dealing here with techniques—we leave the
question of values and ethics to the philosophers.
Finally, the term Hearsteria is broad enough to
cover all types of mass hypnosis whether it be to sell
Liberty bonds, mining stock, share-the-wealth plans,
or wash-away-your-sins gospel. In fact a fanatical
revival meeting of holy rollers is a perfeet illustra
tion of Hearsteria carried to its illogical conclusion.

(IVIr. Saarii presents his third article explain
ing the nature of the propaganda war to he waged
in the coming presidential election.)
To the many inquiries that have been coming in,
let me say that though we offer the term Hearsteria in
honor of Wm. R. Hearst, we by no means limit the
practice to him.
Many other persons and groups have used and still
do use the technique. It was used to defeat LaFollette
as a Communist in 1924. The Hoover campaigners used
it to prove Smith was a puppet of the Pope in 1928,
and again they tried to frighten the voters in '32 with
slogans about "grass in city streets."
The New Deal resorted to Hearsteria in 1933 to
distract attention from its executive dictatorship and
to sell the NRA. The Merriam forces had to create
a state-wide Hearsteria in 1934 to defeat Sinclair, who
had already aroused a million voters into a religious
frenzy. To Father Coughlin goes the credit of the
national Hearsteria that killed our entry into the World
Court. The Senate Committee is still trying to deter
mine who was responsible for the Hearsteria that
almost defeated the Utility Holding Company bill.
Nor is the technique of Hearsteria limited to Demo
cratic America. The British Government in 1926 con
ducted a classic campaign, through its official Gazette,
to frigtyon the people and break the general strike.
(See how S.F. copied the stunt in 1934.)
In countries like Italy, Germany, and Russia,
Hearsteria is easier to create and maintain. This is due
to two things.
First of all, the dictators can at a moment's notice
create situations which will distract the attention of
the masses from the problems at. hand.
If Mussolini is afraid the people are getting hungry,
he starts a war with Ethiopia. This gives him an ex
cuse to take over more power and gives the people a
slogan to starve and die for.
When the voters in Germany are boisterous, Hitler
takes occasion to create a crisis; he leaves the League,
he rearms the nation, or he reoccupies the Rhineland.
Then (as if Hearsteria weren't enough) he asks his
people, "Are you for me, or are you for me?"
The second advantage a dictator has in creating
Hearsteria is his control of the news. He tells his
press what stories to tell and what issues to editorial
ize. He censors all stories which might in any way
lessen the state of Hearsteria.
Thus fictitious victories are forgotten. Atrocities
are invented and insults are exaggerated. Support is
magnified and criticism is belittled.
One more query should be cleared up. The term
Hearsteria is not intended to cast any evil insinuation
against anyone. The technique may be used equally
well for a good or bad motive.
Who is to say the Hearsteria of the Anti-Saloon
League is better than that of the wet Crusaders?
The Hearsterics promoted by the Ku Klux Klan, the
American Legion, the Townsendites, the Jew Baiters,
the Elizabeth Dillings, the Liberty Leaguers, the Re
publicans. the Democrats arc no less Hearsterical be
cause of their motive than that of the Fascists or Com
munists. '
We are dealing here with techniques—we leave the
question of values and ethics to the philosophers.
Finally, the term Hearsteria is broad enough to
cover all types of mass hypnosis whether it be to sell
Liberty bonds, mining stock, share-the-wealth plans,
or wash-away-your-sins gospel. In fact a fanatical
revival meeting of holy rollers is a perfeet illustra
tion of Hearsteria carried to its illogical conclusion.
