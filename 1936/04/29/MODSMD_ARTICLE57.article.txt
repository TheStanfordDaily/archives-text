# Happy Birthday
## 
### 
Out of respect for a man, who alter years
as an active American newspaper publisher
sees lit to prohibit the use of the word "Stan
ford" in 2.'J of the country's largest daily
newspapers, Tin-: Daily pauses to say "happy
birthday to Mr. William Randolph Hearst,"
74 years old today.
The activities of California's most famous
journalistic son are well known, especially in
the field of political drum thumping.
We feel that the third article of Mr. Saadi's
"Election by Propaganda" series is something
of a tribute on this, Mr. Hearst's birthday.
