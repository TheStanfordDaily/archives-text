all frosh courses by those who have taken
them, not taught them, and classifying each
j one "go," "stop," or "caution" according to
1 its worth, degree of difficulty, and elements
i of interest.
i Here on the Farm where freshmen are con
fronted by the same problems as Harvard firsl
j year men, a similar guide would go a long way
1 toward solving the problems which led to
the recent proposal for a "prc-rcgistration
i orientation period." Standing in the way, of
course, are the obstacles of sponsorship and
finance. If these could be overcome, a Stan
ford freshman guide might enhance and sup
plement the frosh bible.
