Two frosh crew men from the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley came down last week-end to show
the hicks on the Farm what a bunch of tide water
sailors could do. So they gathered uja a sophomore
Tri-Delt and meandered over to Lake Lagunita.
They deposited the little lady in the canoe, shoved
off from shore, churning water fore and aft. It didn't
row like any boat they'd been in before, but they got
out into mid-channel, before something snapped.
Then, practically immediately, two frosh crew men
from the University of California at Berkeley, and the
sophomore Tri-Delt were swimming for shore.

For quite a while, the D.G.'s had decided they
didn't like to play volley ball. Then all at once they
looked down from on high and noticed the Gamma
Phi Betas playing volley ball with the Sigma Chis, and
the Chi O's playing volley ball with the Phi Delts.
Then, practically immediately, the D.G.'s decided
they like to play volley ball; so the Chi O's and the
D.G.'s have a race every day to see who can put on
their trickiest looking shorts and race down to play
volley ball.
The D.G.'s and the Phi Delts weren't speaking to
each other for quite a while, due to past offenses of
shooting, ice-box raiding, and long-distance tele
phoning without reimbursement.
But volley ball has changed all this. No longer do
the Phi Delts try to bag D.G.'s with their air guns.
When person Ivey was running for King of the
Massacre Ball, the D.G.'s fished up 40 bucks for the
cause, and then abandoned their evening dinner, and
went over and partook of beans at the Phi Delt.

Delts would support the D.G. candidate next year.
So no longer do the Phi Delts try to bag D.G.'s with
their air guns, but from the volley ball games, one
D.G. has received a torn ligament, and a broken
nose.

didn't like to play volley ball. Then all at once they
looked down from on high and noticed the Gamma
Phi Betas playing volley ball with the Sigma Chis, and
the Chi O's playing volley ball with the Phi Delts.
Then, practically immediately, the D.G.'s decided
they like to play volley ball; so the Chi O's and the
D.G.'s have a race every day to see who can put on
their trickiest looking shorts and race down to play
volley ball.
The D.G.'s and the Phi Delts weren't speaking to
each other for quite a while, due to past offenses of
shooting, ice-box raiding, and long-distance tele
phoning without reimbursement.
But volley ball has changed all this. No longer do
the Phi Delts try to bag D.G.'s with their air guns.
When person Ivey was running for King of the
Massacre Ball, the D.G.'s fished up 40 bucks for the
cause, and then abandoned their evening dinner, and
went over and partook of beans at the Phi Delt.
menage. This was all on the promise that the Phi
Delts would support the D.G. candidate next year.
So no longer do the Phi Delts try to bag D.G.'s with
their air guns, but from the volley ball games, one
D.G. has received a torn ligament, and a broken
nose.
