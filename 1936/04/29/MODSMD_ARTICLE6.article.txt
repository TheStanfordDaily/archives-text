# Italian Infantry Nears Capital
## Refugees Establish Camp Outside Addis Ababa 
### 
ROME, April 28 (/P). â€”Raly's mo- j
torized infantry was climbing the j
last plateau leading straight to Addis |
Ababa, the army command indicated I
tonight, as reports from the Ethi
opian capital told of thousands of
Ethiopian troops, war-worn, ex
hausted and hobbling on bare feet,
began to stream in today from the
northern front.
Most of them primitive fighters j
of the Wallaga province army, they j
presented a sharp contrast to the j
fiery Wallaga warriors who paraded j
last November before Emperor Haile |
Selassie.
Famished and gaunt from lack of !
food and water, the refugees estab- i
lished their quarters in a large camp j
outside the capital, by order of
Crown Prince Asfa Wosan, so that j
Addis Ababa might maintain, its'
status as an "open town."
Many of them were wounded and j
were carried on roughly improvised
stretchers. Those not wounded
dragged guns picked up from their I
j fallen comrades.
