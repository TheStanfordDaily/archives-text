# Bull Session
## NOW IS THE TIME FOR EVERY GOOD... 
### 
On a memorable summer night in
'32, roaring hot with what the sun
had left behind and with political
convention fever, old John Nance
Garner pondered his decision to
drop down a notch in favor of the

Hew York gov
ernor and sum
med up the situa
tion to a reporter,
saying: "Politics is
funny, son."
A comparative
ly conseiivative
o1 d campaigner,
John Nance bare
ly touched on the
truth. Politics
funny? Politics
galloped up the

mountain of hu
mor astride a Harlequin in cap and
bells in 1932, and in this year of our
Lord it's over the top and on its way
down to burlesque absurdity.

Now is the time, nevertheless, for
every good college man to come to
the aid of his party. It doesn't make
any difference which party, for both
need the same kind of aid—aid in
making the opposition look silly.
Being recognized masters of the art
of horse-play, university folk are
being appealed to for contributions I
to the campaign of absurdity.
Last week mail boxes were stuff
ed with the first edition of the j
Young Republicans' "Trumpeter."
It was masterful. "The Republican
Party has neither a secret platform
nor a secret candidate," it solemnly
asserted. (That was interesting be
cause if they had either it most ,
certainly was secret.) Then it !
trumpeted on through 20 pages of
graphic and Chappie-like ridicule to
wind up with an announcement of a
prize contest for the best satires on
the New Deal.

But the Demos latest contribution
is just twice as masterful and twice
as effective in that one need not be
literate to understand it. A bright
"good luck piece" with a picture of
Roosevelt and Garner on one side
and a panorama of the north end of
an elephant going south on the other
proclaims: "heads you win; tails you
lose."

Obviously the coming campaign
will not be one of issues beyond thai
of magazine issues. It will be, or
rather it is. a campaign of wetted
loam pitching. The only difficulty is
that the hands of the throwers are
dirtied every time a toss is made and
the pilch often misses its mark.
Students, famous for their polit
ical apathy, are being enticed into
the fray by appealing to their lowest

] but most popular interests. But
! every time the Young Democrats or
Young Republicans sign up another
mud tosser, they are putting in a
lick for the other side. For the
citizens, in spite of their probable
j 14-year-old mental age level, aren't
| going to respect that party most
which shouts nasty names best.
