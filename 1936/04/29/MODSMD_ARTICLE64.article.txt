# Stokowski To Offer S.F. Three Concerts
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast is to hear for
the first time in person the great I
conductor, LEOPOLD STOKOWSKI
and his PHILADELPHIA ORCHES
TRA of one hundred and ten mu- i
sicians, who are to give three con- j
certs this week-end in the War
Memorial Opera House.
Stokowski is known the world
over by radio. He has always ad- ;
vocated music for the masses, and j
was one of the first of the famous i
conductors to actively support radio '
broadcasts of fine music. His tour,
the first of its kind ever attempted,
was conceived as a means of his
meeting his radio audience in per
son. The tour will include 20 citius
and last five weeks.
Programs were selected from a
state-wide poll, and include classical
and modern composers. Evening
performances begin at 8:20, the
Sunday matinee at 3 o'clock.
The current exhibition of the
works of VINCENT VAN GOGH,
famous Dutch modern, which opened
Monday at the San Francisco Palace
of the Legion of Honor, has aroused
a great deal of interest in the Bay
region.
The exhibition comprises about
100 works, lent by many institutions
and individuals, including the artist's
nephew. The great bulk of the oils,
water colors, drawings, and prints
have never been shown before in
the United States, and a great
number of people have already
taken advantage of this opportunity j
to see for the first time some of the ]
major masterpieces of the artist.
A preliminary Van Gogh show
was given at Lagunta Court Sunday j
night, when a large number of re
prints of the artist were put on ex
hibition. Slides of Van Gogh char- |
coals were shown for students and '
faculty-guests, and a well known
San Francisco artist discussed the
characteristics of Van Gogh's work.
The San Francisco exhibit will
remain on view for a month.
