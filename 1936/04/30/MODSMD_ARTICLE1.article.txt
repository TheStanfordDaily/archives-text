# Sophs Pick Killefer For Junior Prexy
## Thirty Eighters Convene In Special Caucus To Select Row Candidate 
### 
Tom Killefer was unofficially
nominated as the Row's candidate for
junior class president by sophomore j
representatives of 23 fraternities and :
sororities meeting in special caucus
session last night.
The nominee's name will be pre
sented at the official Row caucus
as the unanimous choice of Row
sophomores.
Support Assured for Two
Priscilla Merwin and Margaret
Woodard, nominated at a women's
sophomore caucus earlier in the year
for the offices of junior woman on
Ex Committee and secretary-treas
urer of the junior class, respectively,
were given assurance of support by
last night's caucus by a unanimous
vote.
Merwin and Woodard were nom
inated at the same time as Jackie
Brown, present sophomore repre
sentative on Ex Committee.
Three names — Killefer, George
Ditz, and Ed Burrows—were pro
posed for the junior executive posi
tion. Ditz was eliminated in the
first vote, and Killefer was named j
by a 19-15 majority in the second
after several minutes of discussion.
'Machine' Sponsors Session
Last night's meeting, held in the
Kappa Sigma house, was called by
leaders of the so-called sophomore
"political machine" which prompt
ed Ex Committee to appoint an "in
vestigating committee" last week.
Each house was asked to send a del
egate.
Dick Riddell, Sigma Chi, opened
the meeting as temporary chairman.
Both he and Bud McDuffie were
nominated for permanent chairman, j
but upon McDuffie's declination,
Riddell kept the chair. Sally Weston
was appointed to serve as secretary.
Before the question of nomina
tions was brought up, Riddell ex
plained that the group disclaimed
any intention to be a secret body
and was organized for the purpose
of seeking election of those candi
dates which it considered best suited
for the office.
Unanimous Rally Neccssary
Women representatives expressed
the necessity for unanimous sup
port of nominees chosen at the cau
cus. Bud McDuffie, representing the
Phi Delt fraternity, declared: "We
have a strong class, and there's
nothing we can rightfully do but
hold together."
Bill Hulbert, S.A.E., brought up
the question of distribution of ap
pointive positions within the class
saying that in the past year only six
sororities and 12 fraternities have
been represented in 65 appointed
posts. Of these, he said, one-half
have been filled by members of two
sororities and five fraternities.
To this charge Chairman Riddell
replied: "We can't really start a
gravy train going. We're just a
nominating body and we haven't
control of appointments."
'Democracy' Underlies Act
Recognizing that the problem
merited consideration, Guy
Neely, Kappa Sigma, moved that
the body go on record as favoring
a more democratic distribution of
appointments. The motion Was car
ried without dissent.
All representatives were asked to
report at their next house meetings
and to urge that the decisions of the
caucus be supported by the Row as
a whole.
Houses represented at the caucus
were: Sigma Chi, Theta, Pi Phi,
Beta, Delta Chi, Theta Delta Chi,
A.T.0., Alpha Phi, Fiji, Chi Psi,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Sigma
Nu, Theta Chi, S.A.E., Phi Delt,
Theta Chi, Tri Delt, Sigma Chi,
D.G., Chi O, and Alpha Delt.
