## Taxes Deplete Savings Spent on Labor 
### 
j WASHINGTON, April 29 (/P).â€”
i The convention of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States was
told today American business spent
$20,000,000,000 from its past sav
ings to maintain employment during
the depression.
William L. Sweet, Rhode Island
manufacturer, said this huge sum
. was paid out "in providing work and
i wages beyond the amounts war-
I ranted by the current volume of
j business."
This, he said, was a denial of
charges by some that employers
were "ruthless exploiters of labor."
The convention had just heard
Fred H. Clausen, Wisconsin manu
facturer, and Roy C. Osgood, Chi
; ct'.go banker, contend that the Ad
; ministration tax program will hin-

: der such savings. They demanded
I a tax reform as a measure of stim
! ulating re-employment.
Twelve former members of Chap
arral are now on the staff of Walt
I Disney in Hollywood.
