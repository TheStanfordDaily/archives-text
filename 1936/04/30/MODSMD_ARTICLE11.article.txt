# Want Summer Job?—-- Discard White Collars
## 
### Dave Leff 
If you're thinking of nabbing a '
"job on a boat" this summer you'd
bettor get busy—or give up the idea.
That's the advice of Mrs. Irene
Coverley, director of the Student
Employment Bureau, who is swamp
ed with applications requesting 1
summer jobs.
"Two years ago positions on ships ;
were fairly plentiful," she declares.
"Today it is practically impossible to 1
get one. Union opposition, strikes,
and the habit young fellows have of
'jumping ship' at romantic ports
have hardened the hearts of marine
employers toward youthful labor."
Outlook Better
There has, however, been an up- j
turn in the number of summer jobs
in the past two years. Most of these,
Mrs. Coverley says, are manual and
semi-skilled ones such as construc
tion work on houses, roads, and gov
ernment projects, farming, hauling,
and factory work.
Last summer Mrs. Coverley placed
over 400 Stanford students as clerks,
train waiters (they weren't all col
ored), secretaries of all sorts, camp
directors, tutors, truckers, invoic
crs, and chauffeurs.
About 95 per cent of summer jobs (
pay but little and are not very ex- i
citing, Mrs. Coverley said. The j
really likeable positions are ex- j
tremely rare and often require spe- j
cialized knowledge and skill. On the |
whole, they average $35 to $150 per
month, usually plus room and board.
Sonic Pleasant Jobs
Mrs. Coverley's records do, how- >
ever, contain cases of "enjoyable ]
positions obtained through the
bureau: !

A woman student was placed as
companion to a young girl on a trip
to Europe. A man student cruised
the world as French, swimming,
boxing, and fencing instructor to
two children. Not bad, and only
charm, education and athletic pro
ficiency were needed.
Men skilled in photography, art,
radio, and science have joined ex
ploring expeditions to the South
Seas, Alaska, and the high Sierras.
Varied Testings
A cannery took microscope tech
nicians, chemists, and bacteriologists
in responsible and highly paid posi
tions on Mrs. Coverley's recom
mendation.
Summer camps and dude ranches
come to the bureau for directors,
guides, secretaries. Library staffs,
depleted during the summer, need
fill-in workers. Mrs. Coverley has
found Stanford men and women to
answer these needs. Dance orches
tras on summer tours have taken
Farm musicians.
"Anyone, if he tries hard enough,
can get a job this summer," Mrs.
Coverley believes.
At this very moment, a position as
governess i.s open to the first de
sirable girl applicant who speaks
French fluently.
A boys' camp offers salary and
summer maintenance to a boy with
experience as a counselor. He must
play a musical instrument.
Besides these, Mrs. Coverley has a
considerable number of jobs avail
able a.s housekeeper and cook (for
a girl graduate), as chauffeur, for a
boy with knowledge of automobile
