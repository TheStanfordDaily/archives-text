# Mural Budget Up For Vote
## Brooke To Ask Larger Sum From B.A.C. Monday 
### 
Proposal will be made by Wally
Brooke, A.S.S.U. president, that the
budget for intramural sports be in
creased from the usual $500 to $750
at the meeting of the Board of Ath
letic Control next Monday night.
Brooke is a student member of the
board.
Ex Committee has gone on record
as favoring the proposal, the last de
cision resting with the BA.C. The
board's meeting Monday will be for
the purpose of planning next year's
sports budget. To increase the in
tramural budget l members of the
board must give a slightly larger
percentage of the sports appropria
tions to this department.
Brooke Has Collected Data
Brooke will accompany his pro
posal with reports he has collected
from University of California, U.C.
L.A., Southern California, and oth
ers concerning their intramural
sports appropriations and systems
of administration.
Feasibility of building an intra
mural house, as proposed earlier in
; the quarter, has been found impos
sible, although there is a chance
that one will be constructed within
the next several years, according to
Brooke.
Plaques, Volleyball Suggested
If the requested amount is appro
priated, the first improvement of
the intramural sports program will
be the purchase of bronze plaques
to be given in addition to the cups
now offered as rewards for winners
in the various sports.
Harry Wolter, chairman of the
intramural committee, reminds that
volleyball has been proposed as a
new type of competition to be added
to the intramural program, and that
an increased appropriation would be
a great help in buying necessary
equipment if the proposal is ac
cepted by the committee.
