## Three Senate Factions Plan To Attack Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 29 (TP). â€”
Senate majority leaders declared
themselves ready tonight to speed
consideration of the Administration's
$208,000,000 tax bill which swept
through the House this afternoon by
the one-sided vote of 267 to 93.
Some trouble signals nevertheless
loomed ahead. Two drives were in
formation, one led by a Democrat
and another by a Progressive, to re
vise the plan through a sharp boost
in income taxes.
Republicans have been sum
moned to outline a concerted attack.
generally conceded the Sen
ate could not even approach the al
most record shattering speed with
which the bill was handled on the
House floor.
Despite this, Administration chief
tains contended both publicly and
privately that the President's pro
gram for a drastic revision of the
entire corporation tax structure
would be written on the statute
books without fundamental change.
