# Lost By-Law Finds Home In Handbook
## No Muck, No Raking, So Committee Calls a Halt; Seek Change of Caucus 
### 
Ex Committee's lost orphan has a
home. In next year's handbook, the
maybe-constitutional hybrid by-law
concerning temporary appointments
will be placed under the ample wing
of "Miscellaneous," there to live
happily ever after. The by-law has
a promising future, thinks Ex Com
mittee, but not even Ex Committee
quite knows what it will grow up
to be.
MUCK-RAKING was postponed
by Ex Committee this week for lack
of sufficient muck. Any change in
the present nominating system
would be a fine thing, thinks Ex
Committee, but changes suggested
so far were rejected as merely com
plicating the status quo without re
moving its glaring faults.
A set caucus, even though pub
licized and attended by supposedly
unbiased delegates, would only
cause an overnight crop of pre
caucuses decided the group. So that
idea died by the wayside.
KKN LIVINGSTON, last year's
defeated independent candidate
suggested an all-A.S'.S.U. assembly
at which candidates would make
speeches. This, he said, would make
the campaign one of issue and per
sonality rather than of machine.
Onlookers remembered, ruefully,
the previous gatherings held for the
same purpose, and the 30-odd bored
spectators who turned up to boost
their particular pet candidate. They
also ruminated about the eager
search of candidates for stray
.platforms, and the attempts maybe
sincere, probably comicâ€”of these
same candidates to carry out the
platforms once elected.
Good in theory but useless in
practice, decided Ex Committee
knowingly.
A RULING providing that all
caucuses, to be official, would have
to be publicized three days in ad
vance was dinged half-heartedly.
This would at least eliminate the
high-powered salesmanship of a
campaign manager who happily
plans a caucus, invites a picked list
of staunch supporters, railroads his
candidate through, and then advises
all other Row aspirants to decline
gracefully because "his man is the
official nominee."
Any ideas for improving the
present set-up will be welcomed by
a would-be reform group on Ex
Committee. Faults are seldom rec
ognized. Now that recognition has
come, something should definitely
be done about it.
