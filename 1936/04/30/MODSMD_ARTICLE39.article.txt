Two championship bracket games

Business School II vs. Phi Delta Phi,
and the semi-final round will be
reached tomorrow.
Business School, last year's cham

reached the play-off.
Baseball teams are warned to be
out on time, as a number of for

because of lateness. Sign-ups will

swimming meet Thursday and Fri

lays have tentatively been scheduled
for May 22. Get back into shape,
boys.
