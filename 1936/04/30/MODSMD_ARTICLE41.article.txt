THE MYSTERIOUS CASE
OF SIIAW
Ol' Bill Ellington, the jocund as
sistant track coach, is still in the fog
about something that happened last
Friday at the Little Big Meet at
Berkeley.
The whole thing is wrapped
pround the mysterious question,
"Who is Shaw?"
For it was this absolutely unknown
papoose, Shaw, that for 700 yards
made a monkey out of the Cal frosh
captain and star half-miler, Biggs.
After the high hurdles up there at
Edwards Field, the announcer yell
ed the customary "last call for the
880." Well, the frosh were a bit
embarrassed at this, for they had no
880 man.
Leo Feder and John M. Fuller,
who are the frosh half-milers on
! paper, were both in other events and
could not enter. So the announcer
went a bit beyond his station, when
no papoose showed up at the start
of the straightaway for the half, and
called out for any Stanford men to
come down and enter the event, just
for the principle of the thing, as it
were.
Then all was well and the race
started. Five runners came down
the track, three Bears and two
Cards. One of the Cards was Hum
Smith's little brother, who does a
bit of high-jumping and vaulting
j for the frosh.
'Ihe other red-shirt no one even
recognized. He was in the lead,
acting like he was in the wrong

! race and looking guilty as if he
thought that lie shouldn't he out
in front, especially with the Cub
captain, the famed Biggs, behind
him. lie kept looking around,
| evidently wondering why no one
passed him. That was Shaw, we
i afterward learned.
And of all things, when he came
down in front of the stands we
could see that the bounding fel
; low was wearing a pair of regu
' lar black street shoes, which is
worse than wearing an overcoat
and a pair of hip boots in a 50-
yard backstroke race.
But they passed the quarter in 58
seconds with this enigma Shaw still
I in the lead. And he stayed in the
lead until the last turn, where the
! Cub captain and his mates, with
years of training behind them,
j steamed past and finished in a sweep.
But that was a pictureâ€”Shaw in
the 880 looking like Charlie Chaplin
in a prize-ring and making more
silly conlortions than Chuck Nimmo
ever thought of making, and Bill
Ellington wondering all the time
who he was.
It happens that Shaw was out for
the high jump, wasn't very good,
and he and Hum Smith's little
brother thought they'd enter the half
just for the prank. Now if this Shaw
j does come out and work a bit on
sprint laps and quarters and jog
ging like the other boys, why he may
make an 880 man yet, and beat
i Biggs next year.
TWO JUMPERS you ought to
know about: Guy Manuel and John
i Moller.
j Moller is the Stanford high jump-
I er who was one of the eight to tie
[ for first in the Big Meet. He is a
junior, a big muscled blond fellow
who got his first break in three years
when he cleared 6-2 the Wednesday
before the S.C. meet, thereby quali
fying for the trip South. It was the
, highest he had ever soared.
He has been out for the high
jump ever since he came to Stanford
in the fall of '33, He failed to make
j the frosh team, but kept coming
back, winter, spring, and fall, al
ways trying to get a form a little
i more graceful than his old one,
which was on the Parker-house roll
motif. Finally, after ihese many
years of practice, his form did im
prove, and so now he has his
Block S.
Manuel is th# Cal frosh broad
jumper who broke the Little Big
Meet record by about a foot and a
half last Friday, at 24.4.
He is without a wisp of a doubt
