# Thornton Pins Olympic Hopes On Needham
## Frosh Swimmer Will Face East's Stars at Two Elimination Tourneys 
### 
Lone hope for bay district repre
sentation on the Olympic Games
swimming team this summer rests
with one Stanford freshman, Win- j
field Needham'by nam<?, Coach Nort
Thornton said in effect yesterday
when reviewing chances of placing
Indians on the American squad.
"He's the smoothest, most relaxed
swimmer I've ever seen," he de
clared. "Swimming critics familiar
with his stroke agree with me in I
saying he is exceptional. His sue- ,
cess is due to his complete relaxa- i
tion, his long glide and powerful
kick, and the fact that he wastes
absolutely no motion. Certainly, he's
the greatest Stanford distance man
of all time."
Figures Show
Just to back up his contention,
Coach Thornton brought out a few j
figures. Needham broke Little Big
Meet records for both the 440 and |
the 220, lopping 23 seconds off the j
time for the former distance and 4 |
off Austin Clapp's seven-year mark
in the 220.
He is the Junior National and Pa- i
cific Association champion in the
500-yard free-style. His mark of j
5:43 fiat for the latter title hacked j
off 16.8 seconds from the record of i
Ted Wiget, Stanford's three-time!
National Intercollegiate champion.
Equals IVlcdica
On his way to the 500, the In- 1
dian yearling broke five minutes for !
the 440, a thing only Washington's j
Jack Medica, heralded world's great- l
est swimmer, and Jimmy Gilhula of !
Southern Cal had ever before done j
in competition swimming in a 25-
yard pool. Medica, incidentally, is
the only man ever to beat Needham
in any distance over 220 yards.
"Needham's chances of making the
Olympic Games this year are pretty
fair," Thornton continued. "Un- '
doubtedly Medica, Gilhula, and'
Flanagan of Miami can beat him at
the 1500 meters, but only Flanagan
is concentrating on that event.
"Hoigt of Yale, Cristy of Michi
gan, and Gilman of Ohio State are
the three men whom Needham will
have to beat in the finals at Provi
dence, R.1., this July—that is, of
course, if he qualifies at the sec
tional tryouts next month at the
Fleishhacker pool. But I think he
will do that all right!"

the largest track man, excluding
shot-putters, that I have ever seen.
About 6 feet 4 and solidly built, he
just unlimbers down the take-off
and chucks himself out and there
he is. He also pole vaults, throws
the javelin, and is undoubtedly good
for a race or two besides. —Breed i
