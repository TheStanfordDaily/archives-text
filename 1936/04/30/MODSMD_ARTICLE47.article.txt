## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" New Theater, New Organization Open Up Many New Fields to Stanford Dramatics 
### 
When Ex Committee last quarter politely sug
gested that Dramatic Council reorganize itself
along more workable lines, the campus drama
tists stalled, in anticipation of the time when a
complete overhauling was to take place.
That time is now at hand, and Dr. L. E. Bas
sett yesterday promised some new plan to co
ordinate the relation of students to faculty in
dramatics would be hatched next week.
When Stanford's much-publicized Memorial
Theater is ready for occupancy late in autumn
quarter, an entirely different type of organi
zation will take control of Farm productions.
The University probably will have full finan
cial responsibility for most regular plays; stu
dents will continue to finance productions such
as the Gaieties, Spring Musical, and readings.
Dramatics Council re-organization probably
will include two major changes: it will be made
smaller by eliminating three or four of the
present members, and will be directly under
the jurisdiction of the University, rather than
Ex Committee.
The New Theater offers new opportunities to
Stanford dramatics. It should be feasible and

comparatively inexpensive to add a School of
the Theater as a regular University department;
the additional expense would be in enlarging
the faculty.
Under the present system, student dramatic
productions can't pay for themselves. The Dra
matic Council now contributes S7OO a year to
the director's salary, and the plays, exclusive
of the Gaieties and Spring Musical, usually go
just about $700 annually into the red.
The SI top price for seats is more than a stu
dent audience will pay to watch the normal
amateur performance, yet a lower fee would not
draw enough more people to make financing
possible.
When the University assumes control of the
finances, consequently, it can charge director's
salary off as faculty expenses, and look at
dramatics as a training ground in theatrical
work, rather than as a leisure-time activity.
The School of the Theater, if one is eventually
organized, could concentrate on artistic produc
tions, more of them, and utilize the theater edu
cationally, instead of throwing together a "pot
boiler," primarily selected to draw the greatest
possible attendance.
