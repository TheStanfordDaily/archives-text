# Trouble in Paradise, Or It's the Woman Who Pays
## 
### 
Before the flood of new women deluged the
campus, a picturesque society existed at Stan
ford. Right was right, and wrong was wrong,
rules of the game were pretty static and ac
cepted without question, and it was an honor
and longed-for privilege to be a sponsor.
The 1,000 women who have come are no
worse, or better, than the pretties who were
here before, but there are more of them, and the
old rules have been strained. Now, it is still
an honor, but not such a privilege, and con
siderably more of a task to be a woman sponsor.
In the old days the prestige was easily worth
the pain and expense; today this worth seems
debatable.
Following a recent editorial on the subject,
the Women's Conference president came to the

editorial sanctum, stated The Daily's figures
were decidedly wrong, and quoted statistics
which in many cases were good, in fact much
better than The Daily's.
The Daily had quoted figures, unearthed in
its inter-office secret service, that only three
out of the 17 sponsors asked on the first list last
year had accepted. She informed that 10 of the
17 accepted, three declined for family reasons,
three because of subsequent political jobs, only
one refused for house reasons. The Daily's inter
office memo is no proof against such good sta
tistics; however, there is the fact that of this
year's sponsors, only two are Row women.
Which, if it means anything, shows either
that there was discrimination against Row
women in choosing sponsors, that the Row is
decadent and has no good sponsor material, or
that satisfactory Row women could not see their
way fit to take the job under the present set-up.
The Daily is implying no Hall-Row feud in
sponsor selections. The Row woman has no
more gripe against the set-up than the Hall
woman. Both must undergo nearly an equal
amount of sacrifice, the balance of which is not
quite made up in prestige or in concessions.
Another set of figures the Women's Confer
ence president challenged was the comparative
cost of living in Hall and Row. She denied The
Daily's assertion that it was cheaper for a Row
woman to live in a house than to be a sponsor.
As to board and room, a poll shows that for
next year three sororities are lower than the
halls. But house, national, and social dues lump
on to this to confuse things to such an extent
that mere figures cannot entirely clarify them.
Further complications: several houses rebate in
the short June month for surpluses accumu
lated; house dues, in several cases, had to be
paid because of inescapable national laws, al
though the sponsor was actually inactive; and
social dues had to be paid if the sponsor was to
have the privilege of house social facilities.
Statistics are fascinating and convincing, but
no matter who quotes them, the fact remains
that there is a sponsor trouble somewhere.

Following a recent editorial on the subject,
the Women's Conference president came to the

editorial sanctum, stated The Daily's figures
were decidedly wrong, and quoted statistics
which in many cases were good, in fact much
better than The Daily's.
The Daily had quoted figures, unearthed in
its inter-office secret service, that only three
out of the 17 sponsors asked on the first list last
year had accepted. She informed that 10 of the
17 accepted, three declined for family reasons,
three because of subsequent political jobs, only
one refused for house reasons. The Daily's inter
office memo is no proof against such good sta
tistics; however, there is the fact that of this
year's sponsors, only two are Row women.
Which, if it means anything, shows either
that there was discrimination against Row
women in choosing sponsors, that the Row is
decadent and has no good sponsor material, or
that satisfactory Row women could not see their
way fit to take the job under the present set-up.
The Daily is implying no Hall-Row feud in
sponsor selections. The Row woman has no
more gripe against the set-up than the Hall
woman. Both must undergo nearly an equal
amount of sacrifice, the balance of which is not
quite made up in prestige or in concessions.
Another set of figures the Women's Confer
ence president challenged was the comparative
cost of living in Hall and Row. She denied The
Daily's assertion that it was cheaper for a Row
woman to live in a house than to be a sponsor.
As to board and room, a poll shows that for
next year three sororities are lower than the
halls. But house, national, and social dues lump
on to this to confuse things to such an extent
that mere figures cannot entirely clarify them.
Further complications: several houses rebate in
the short June month for surpluses accumu
lated; house dues, in several cases, had to be
paid because of inescapable national laws, al
though the sponsor was actually inactive; and
social dues had to be paid if the sponsor was to
have the privilege of house social facilities.
Statistics are fascinating and convincing, but
no matter who quotes them, the fact remains
that there is a sponsor trouble somewhere.
Before the flood of new women deluged the
campus, a picturesque society existed at Stan
ford. Right was right, and wrong was wrong,
rules of the game were pretty static and ac
cepted without question, and it was an honor
and longed-for privilege to be a sponsor.
The 1,000 women who have come are no
worse, or better, than the pretties who were
here before, but there are more of them, and the
old rules have been strained. Now, it is still
an honor, but not such a privilege, and con
siderably more of a task to be a woman sponsor.
In the old days the prestige was easily worth
the pain and expense; today this worth seems
debatable.
