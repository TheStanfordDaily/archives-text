# Election By Propaganda

### Mitchel Saadi 
One of the most deeply seated attitudes in the adult
American is on race and class hatred. Arouse that
prejudice by the proper emotional appeals and the
public goes Hearsterical.
South of the Mason and Dixon lino the bugaboo
of color is ever ready to come forth, and when it does,
any kind of hell may pop. It may be a lynching
party for an innocent negro, or a ridiculous series of
trials for the Scottsboro boys, or it may be a sequence
of mysterious floggings, killings, or tar and featherings.
% * * * *
This bugaboo is now being dressed up for the com
ing campaign of Hearsteria. Opponents of the New
Deal, admittedly financed by the DuPonts and Sloans
of the Liberty League, recently had a chance to use
this appeal.
Photographs of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt and
two "nigger escorts" entering a building where a
Negro meeting was to take place were distributed
throughout the South. This was to prepare the mood
in which delegates to the Talmadge Grass-roots con
vention were to meet and denounce the president.
* * * *
Nor arc the negroes, the Japanese, or the Hindus
the only ones for whom hatred can be aroused. Thanks
to the propaganda of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the Better American Federation, the Amer
ican Legion and the Hearsts, there is today a feeling
akin to fear and hatred of any foreigner.
Hence the ease with which opposition to "foreign
entanglements," "World Court," "League of Nations,"
"lower tariffs," and "alienisms" can be aroused.
The last of these "alienisms," we shall see used a
great deal in the next campaign. The terms fascism,
socialism, communism, bolshevism, despotism, will be
used indiscriminately. ,
Mr. A1 Smith, for example, has already gone on
record as opposing the socialism of the New Deal.
But just as we begin to classify Mr. Roosevelt as a
radical along comes Hearst, who gives him the second
barrel. He writes on April 15, "Nothing irritates a
New Dealer so much as to show him up for the reac
tionary which he is—a flagrant, unqualified, and
extreme reactionary, and NOT a liberal in any sense
of the word."
* * * *
So we foresee an attack of Roosevelt from both sides
—he will be simultaneously a fascist and a commun
ist, a wild-eyed radical and a cold-blooded tyrant.
He will be labeled with every alienism that can be in
vented, simply because people don't know what those
isms mean, but they do know they don't like them.
* ♦ * »
I felt sorry for those people who apologized for the
erudeness of the whispering campaign agajnst A1
Smith's catholicism. They explained that the Ku
Klux Klan tactics used in 1928 to make the nation
Hearsterically opposed to the Happy Warrior on re
ligious grounds were cultural throwbacks.
But evidence of even nastier and dirtier tactics for
the next campaign is appearing through the mails.
These emotional appeals will depend upon an easily
aroused hatred of the much maligned Jews.
Jew baiting in this country has, happily, been well
suppressed. So had it been for a long time in Germany
■ but when the need of a handy bugaboo came—Jew
baiting became popular.
Anonymous documents are already being circulated
widely, purporting to prove that America is being
ruled by an international ring of Jewish bankers.
That these conspirators have in mind a systematic
plan for overthrowing this government and all other
governments and bringing to successful culmination
tile aims of the Protocols of Zion. (These protocols
have been, time and again, exposed as fakes, till now,
to most of us it is a joke, but to great masses who
don't know, it might be gospel.)

Hearsterically opposed to the Happy Warrior on re

Jew baiting in this country has, happily, been well

baiting became popular.
Anonymous documents are already being circulated

That these conspirators have in mind a systematic
plan for overthrowing this government and all other
governments and bringing to successful culmination

have been, time and again, exposed as fakes, till now,
to most of us it is a joke, but to great masses who
don't know, it might be gospel.)
One of the most deeply seated attitudes in the adult

South of the Mason and Dixon lino the bugaboo
of color is ever ready to come forth, and when it does,
any kind of hell may pop. It may be a lynching
party for an innocent negro, or a ridiculous series of
trials for the Scottsboro boys, or it may be a sequence
of mysterious floggings, killings, or tar and featherings.

This bugaboo is now being dressed up for the com
ing campaign of Hearsteria. Opponents of the New
Deal, admittedly financed by the DuPonts and Sloans
of the Liberty League, recently had a chance to use
this appeal.
Photographs of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt and
two "nigger escorts" entering a building where a
Negro meeting was to take place were distributed
throughout the South. This was to prepare the mood
in which delegates to the Talmadge Grass-roots con
vention were to meet and denounce the president.

Nor arc the negroes, the Japanese, or the Hindus
the only ones for whom hatred can be aroused. Thanks
to the propaganda of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the Better American Federation, the Amer
ican Legion and the Hearsts, there is today a feeling
akin to fear and hatred of any foreigner.
Hence the ease with which opposition to "foreign
entanglements," "World Court," "League of Nations,"
"lower tariffs," and "alienisms" can be aroused.
The last of these "alienisms," we shall see used a
great deal in the next campaign. The terms fascism,
socialism, communism, bolshevism, despotism, will be
used indiscriminately. ,
Mr. A1 Smith, for example, has already gone on
record as opposing the socialism of the New Deal.
But just as we begin to classify Mr. Roosevelt as a
radical along comes Hearst, who gives him the second
barrel. He writes on April 15, "Nothing irritates a
New Dealer so much as to show him up for the reac
tionary which he is—a flagrant, unqualified, and
extreme reactionary, and NOT a liberal in any sense
of the word."
* * * *
So we foresee an attack of Roosevelt from both sides
—he will be simultaneously a fascist and a commun
ist, a wild-eyed radical and a cold-blooded tyrant.
He will be labeled with every alienism that can be in
vented, simply because people don't know what those
isms mean, but they do know they don't like them.
