# Frosh Reading Test To Be Given Today
## 
### 
All freshmen who have 10 o'clock
free this morning are requested to
come to the Assembly Hall for a
second reading test, a follow-up of
that given last fall.
The test, for which no charge is
made and from which results will
subsequently be released to stu
dents, is an educational study, and
is to find what progress each fresh
man has made in reading ability
since the test last fall.
