Yesterday there was a little epic on the subject of
broken noses and torn ligaments in Phi Delt-Deegee
volley ball games. Today comes a story of another sort
of affliction, but the hoarse is on the Phi Delts this
time.

One of the brothers of Phi Delta Theta got a dose
of the common cold. As he sniffled through the Libe
between the flosses row on row, all parked in place,
and in the wings, the book-hasher no longer call-slip
flings, scarce heard amid the Phi Delt's blow by blow.

The Deegee suggested to the Phi Dolt, she sug
gested to him, she says, "Why don't you take bicarb
of soda for your cold?"
Said the Phi Delt, says he to her, "That is a
idea, it is."

The curtain falls to indicate the lapse of a fev hour
and the Phi Delt.

Calls he up to her at 12 o'clock that n'ght: "Did
you say I should take for my cold baking soda or
baking powder?"
"Baking soda," she says to him.
"Oh," he says, "I took baking powder."

The Phi Delts spent the rest of the evening pour
ing the whites of eggs down the inner tube of the
dough-heavy brother.

It is said that he rose to the occasion
