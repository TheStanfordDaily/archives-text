## BOSS FLANNEL 
### 
They tell us New York's infamous !
Boss Tweed was clumsy, unscru
pulous and not very brilliant. That
being so, only one thing can explain
(he strangle hold he had on Amer-

ica's Queen City
— Boss Tweed
came to the right
place at the right
time.
The place was
New York when
one drink bought
three votes.
The time was
prior to the turn I
of the century. I
when the polit
ical office-holder

was just a bother.
New Yorkers carelessly gave the
(rouble of selection and election of
civic officials to the man with the
time and initiative for the job.

Far be it from us to compare the j
j Union Cellar to thu Bowery, the i
[ How to Riverside Drive, campus
I politicians to such men as Boss
I Tweed, or the Sophomore Machine
1 to Tan many Hall.
Though family resemblances are
there (even campus politicos find a
certain delight in the fact), though
the machine i.s undeniably busy gct
; ting certain men in certain campus
offices—offering plums to the stub
born, compromises to the eager —we
| cannot place the onus of infamy on
Stanford's political Austin.
For the rugged old steam-roller of
; history was after positions as a
means to an end—the public treas
ury. Stanford's one-cylinder affair
is just after the positions, thank
I you.
But superficially there is a sus
picious identity between the old
adult and the new collegiate model.
Both had a boss. One was called
| Tweed. VVe might call our's Flan
j nel. And both were a product of a
time and place. In our case, the
| place is here. The time is spring
j quarter. And, like that venerable
juggernaut engineered by the be- I
paunched cigar-smelling Mr. Tweed,
Stanford's sophomore stream-line
runabout, driven by smooth and
pink-cheeked collegians, is also do
ing a public service, a service, that
is, that the public is too busy to '
do itself.
With its clever leader, it is set to
, run the next campus election, for
whether we like it or not, the aver
i age student looks at the labor of

vote-easting much as he looks at
janitoring or garbage-collecting, a
duty that has to be done, but one
he'd rather let someone else perform,
or at least facilitate.
* * •
Stanford life has made us careless,
spring has made us dopey. And
since we haven't enough energy or
initiative to run our own election,
why not let the machine run it?
Actually, not 400 of us give much
of a damn who gets elected to what
and why. Though those 400 good

citizens will scream like eagles at
the sophomores and their vote-get
ing device, the rest of us haven't a
moan coming.
Stanford's student body, by its
own carelessness and laziness, has
made the time and the place for
the Sophomore Political Machine.
Let the machine* do the work we
have delegated to it.

Though family resemblances are

Stanford's sophomore stream-line
runabout, driven by smooth and
pink-cheeked collegians, is also do

is, that the public is too busy to '
do itself.
With its clever leader, it is set to
, run the next campus election, for
whether we like it or not, the aver
i age student looks at the labor of

vote-easting much as he looks at
janitoring or garbage-collecting, a
duty that has to be done, but one
he'd rather let someone else perform,
or at least facilitate.

Stanford life has made us careless,
spring has made us dopey. And
since we haven't enough energy or
initiative to run our own election,
why not let the machine run it?
Actually, not 400 of us give much
of a damn who gets elected to what
and why. Though those 400 good

citizens will scream like eagles at
the sophomores and their vote-get
ing device, the rest of us haven't a

Stanford's student body, by its
