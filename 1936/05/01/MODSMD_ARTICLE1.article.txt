# Redwood City Boy Drowned In Felt Lake
## Harold Svani, 15, Perishes As Rescue Try Fails; Inhalator Unsuccessful 
### 
A tangled fishing line brought
death in Felt Lake yesterday after
noon to Harold Svani, 15, of Red
wood City. One of a group of stu
dents from Mt. Carniel Parochial
School in Redwood, picnicking in a
nearby grove, he and one or two
companions separated from the main
group to fish in the lake.
His line tangled in a tree near
shore, and, though he could not
swim, he entered the water in an
attempt to free the line, lost his
footing on the rocky lakeside, and
drowned.
Greenlee Finds Body
His body was pulled from the
lake three-quarters of an hour after
he first went down by Barney
Greenlee, who was taken to the
scene by Officer Gordon Davis after
bystanders had phoned the Palo
Alto Fire Department. The phone
call failed to specify the name of the
lake, and Fire Chief Clemo first
came out to Lagunita, picking up
Davis on the way.
A phone call to Searsville Lake
by Davis revealed nothing wrong
there, so Davis, Clemo, and Green
lee proceeded to Felt Lake.
Firemen from Palo Alto and
Menlo Park worked over Svani's
bydy with artificial respiration and
an inhalator for an hour and a half
at the lake, after which the body
was taken to Palo Alto Hospital and
placed in a respirator for oxygen
treatment for another half hour.
Died of Drowning
Svani was at first through by by
standers to have been the victim of
heart failure when no water came
from his lungs as firemen applied
artificial respiration by the banks of
the lake. But Dr. Harvey Slater,
who directed treatment at the hos
pital, said there was no sign of
heart failure, and a small amount of
water was found in the lungs when
the body was brought to Palo Alto.
Dr. Slater explained that Svani
probably swallowed a large amount
of water in his fright, which weighed
the body down, after which only a
small amount of water in the lungs
was necessary to cause asphyxia
tion.
Norman Videau, one of Svani's
companions, attempted to drag him
from the water when he first went
in, but was unsuccessful.

treatment for another half hour.
Died of Drowning
Svani was at first through by by
standers to have been the victim of
heart failure when no water came
from his lungs as firemen applied
artificial respiration by the banks of
the lake. But Dr. Harvey Slater,
who directed treatment at the hos
pital, said there was no sign of
heart failure, and a small amount of
water was found in the lungs when
the body was brought to Palo Alto.
Dr. Slater explained that Svani
probably swallowed a large amount
of water in his fright, which weighed
the body down, after which only a
small amount of water in the lungs
was necessary to cause asphyxia
tion.
Norman Videau, one of Svani's
companions, attempted to drag him
from the water when he first went
in, but was unsuccessful.
A tangled fishing line brought
death in Felt Lake yesterday after
noon to Harold Svani, 15, of Red
wood City. One of a group of stu
dents from Mt. Carniel Parochial
School in Redwood, picnicking in a
nearby grove, he and one or two
companions separated from the main
group to fish in the lake.
His line tangled in a tree near
shore, and, though he could not
swim, he entered the water in an
attempt to free the line, lost his
footing on the rocky lakeside, and
drowned.
Greenlee Finds Body
His body was pulled from the
lake three-quarters of an hour after
he first went down by Barney
Greenlee, who was taken to the
scene by Officer Gordon Davis after
bystanders had phoned the Palo
Alto Fire Department. The phone
call failed to specify the name of the
lake, and Fire Chief Clemo first
came out to Lagunita, picking up
Davis on the way.
A phone call to Searsville Lake
by Davis revealed nothing wrong
there, so Davis, Clemo, and Green
lee proceeded to Felt Lake.
Firemen from Palo Alto and
Menlo Park worked over Svani's
bydy with artificial respiration and
an inhalator for an hour and a half
at the lake, after which the body
was taken to Palo Alto Hospital and
placed in a respirator for oxygen
treatment for another half hour.
