# Freshmen Hold Regatta Tonight
## Nautical Dance To Feature Carvel Craig's Music 
### 
Men in white flannels and dark
coats with a nautical swing will be
complemented by women in summer
formals at the Freshman Regatta,
which will get under way at 9 o'clock
tonight in the Encina lobby and drop
anchor at 1.
Carvel Craig's orchestra will play
for the event in the hall which will
be converted into a typical yacht
harbor, with all one side covered
with sailing pennants. The event
is open to all students, and bids can
be obtained for $2 at the A.S.S.U.
office.
Andy Shirey heads the committee
for the Regatta, assisted by Florence
Brown, Bernardino Culver, Henry
Halverson, Hershey Julian, Kay La
Gasa, Betsy MacElroy, Dean Pierose,
and Dick Spenser.
