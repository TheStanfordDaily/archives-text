# Cathcart To Talk On Radio Hour Monday
## 
### 
From where does the United States
Supreme Court derive its power to
pass upon the constitutionality of
i the acts of Congress? Should this
power be abolished or curtailed? To
what extent, if at all, could Congress
j ilself, without a constitutional
amendment, prevent the court from
passing on the constitutionality of its
j acts?
These are some of the questions
that Professor A. M. Cathcart, of
the Stanford University School of
Law will discuss in a radio talk,
"Congress and the Supreme Court,"
to be broadcast from station KGO
next Monday evening at 7:15
; o'clock.
