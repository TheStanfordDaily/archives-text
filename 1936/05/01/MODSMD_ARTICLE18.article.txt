# Second Honor Code Panel Debates Values
## Solution of Problems Seen In Determining Roles Of Student, Faculty Groups 
### Johnson Hill 
Winds of freedom in hurricane
proportions blew over the Stanford
campus last night, leaving in their
wake a small group of faculty dele
gates, interspersed with students,
engaged in ardent discussion on
sundry phases of the Honor Code.
The occasion was an all-Univer- \
sity panel, the second sponsored
jointly by Men's and Women's i
Councils in the lounge room of the
Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, chairman
of the meeting, took the floor with a
brief outline of the topics for dis
cussion, namely the roles played by
students, by professors, and by the
Councils in handling the Code. An
hour later, however, the three points
were lost in a flurry of debate be
tween the floor and the panel.
Panel Satisfies
Although no tangible results were
obtained from the discussion, spon
sors expressed satisfaction with the
number and character of suggestions
offered. A shorthand record of the
entire procedure will be transcribed
and used by the Councils in consid
eration of Honor Code problems.
Professor David L. Webster, head i
of the physics department, opened
the panel conversation with the
statement:
Praises Code
"The Honor Code should be up
held for the good of the students.
It is an integral part of the compen
dium which maintains a Stanford
degree in the high regard it now
enjoys.
"I believe that students should be
responsible as they nominally are
now for enforcement of the Code. It
might be advantageous for each liv
ing group to hold periodical meet
ings in which relative problems
might be discussed," he added.
Criticize Flunks
Aftpr the airing of a number of
opinions on proper penalties for vio
lations of Honor System principles,
mention was made of the prevailing
policy of giving "flat flunks" to stu
dents convicted of their charges.
Said Professors E. E. Robinson
and Ernest Hilgard, "Does a flunk
constitute the penalty for violation
of the Honor Code?" The series of
talks which followed indicated a
general negative response.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, com
menting on the English department's
problem of correcting students' pla
giarism in composition work, said:
"I hope we don't carry this thing
too far. If we do, some professors
may be forced to reveal where they
get some of their own stuff."
Other members of the panel in
cluded Professor Bernard Haley of
the economics department, and Gib
Holloway, Barbara Kimball, Chick
Franich, Ann Cornwell, and Dean
Pierose.

might be discussed," he added.
Criticize Flunks
Aftpr the airing of a number of
opinions on proper penalties for vio
lations of Honor System principles,
mention was made of the prevailing
policy of giving "flat flunks" to stu
dents convicted of their charges.
Said Professors E. E. Robinson
and Ernest Hilgard, "Does a flunk
constitute the penalty for violation
of the Honor Code?" The series of
talks which followed indicated a
general negative response.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, com
menting on the English department's
problem of correcting students' pla
giarism in composition work, said:
"I hope we don't carry this thing
too far. If we do, some professors
may be forced to reveal where they
get some of their own stuff."
Other members of the panel in
cluded Professor Bernard Haley of
the economics department, and Gib
Holloway, Barbara Kimball, Chick
Franich, Ann Cornwell, and Dean
Pierose.
Winds of freedom in hurricane
proportions blew over the Stanford
campus last night, leaving in their
wake a small group of faculty dele
gates, interspersed with students,
engaged in ardent discussion on
sundry phases of the Honor Code.
The occasion was an all-Univer- \
sity panel, the second sponsored
jointly by Men's and Women's i
Councils in the lounge room of the
Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, chairman
of the meeting, took the floor with a
brief outline of the topics for dis
cussion, namely the roles played by
students, by professors, and by the
Councils in handling the Code. An
hour later, however, the three points
were lost in a flurry of debate be
tween the floor and the panel.
Panel Satisfies
Although no tangible results were
obtained from the discussion, spon
sors expressed satisfaction with the
number and character of suggestions
offered. A shorthand record of the
entire procedure will be transcribed
and used by the Councils in consid
eration of Honor Code problems.
Professor David L. Webster, head i
of the physics department, opened
the panel conversation with the
statement:
Praises Code
"The Honor Code should be up
held for the good of the students.
It is an integral part of the compen
dium which maintains a Stanford
degree in the high regard it now
enjoys.
"I believe that students should be
responsible as they nominally are
now for enforcement of the Code. It
might be advantageous for each liv
ing group to hold periodical meet
ings in which relative problems
might be discussed," he added.
