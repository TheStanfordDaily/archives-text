# Humor, Not Cash, Is Essential Requisite of Co-Eds' Husbands
##

Wealth doesn't eount. Hand
someness isn't essential. But the
man who successfully would woo the
Stanford woman must be able to
appreciate the funny side of life.

He must have a good sense of humor.
These facts were revealed this
week in a survey of representative
Farm women. The ideal husband j
must be a little more intelligent than
| she is, and he must be on the whole !
a little superior to her in most char
acteristics if he is to command her J
love, honor, and obedience. He !
must take an interest in sports, be I
considerate and understanding, and j
| display a sense of responsibility. He |
need not be handsome, nor consti- j
tute, in collegiate terminology, "a i
good date." Above all, he needn't
be well to do.
Some Stanford women have a set
formula to which their ideal hus
bands must conform, while others,
less analytically inclined, would
"just know" the right man when he
comes along.
Women's Council Chairman Pat
F1 avel in a simple statement de
scribed her ideal man. "He doesn't
need to be all the superlatives which
an ideal husband is traditionally,"
she said. "Let him be as human as
the rest of us, but I would want a
man with a bigness about things not
found in just everybody."
The husband of Betty Grover,
junior woman on Ex Committee, |
will have to reconcile himself to
her pursuing a career. He must be
interested in good books, opera, and
plays. He must also bo adent at

some form of sport, such as golf,
tennis, or horseback riding. She
wouldn't mind if he were Rood look
ing, and he should have money
enough to get along.
"I would like to marry a man with

greatet intelligence than 1 have so
that I could look up to him and ad
mire him," said Dulce Parker,
i Masque Ball queen. "Money is im
portant but not essential. He would
have to be a man whom I could
| trust implicitly, so that I wouldn't
be afraid that he might run off."
Susan, campus figure who broke
: into prominence through a contro
versy with the Bull Sessioner over
the relative merits of Farm men
and women, wants a well-rounded
man for her husband. He must be
physically healthful and culturally
intellectual. The average Stanford
man, she said, falls far short of this
| standard. Adaptability, apprecia
tion of children and animals, the
ability to know when to give in and
when to hold his own, steady nerves,
and intelligence are the principal re
j quirements for Susan's Prince
Charming. Financial standing is her
; last consideration.
A normal, intelligent man will
satisfy Jackie Flanders, A.S.S.U.
vice-president, as a husband. She
added, however, that he must be a
man "not easily brow-beaten."
"He needn't be good looking, ath
letic, nor wealthy, although it would
help if he were adept at swim-
I ming," she stated.
The tastes of Esther Pelton, wom
i en's council member, definitely run
toward blondes, although a good
sense of humor is her prime pie
requisite. Her man should be in
telligent, but not the book-worm
type, rather, he should have an alert
mind. "A good sun-tan would be a
definite asset," she admitted.
The ideal husband for Annalee
Whitmore, member of women's
council, not possess special so-,
cial graces nor be handsome in a
! "collar ad-ish way." Rather, he
* must be intelligent, talented, and
have a sense of responsibility.
Vitality is one of the prime pre
requisites of Pat Skinner, Robleite.
Her husband must, in addition, be
fairly good looking, a good dancer,
and free from conceit. He should be
intelligent, but not studious; witty,
but not punny. â€¢
Men possessing the qualifications
listed by these women are advised
to make formal applications for in
spection. Don't hurry, boys.
