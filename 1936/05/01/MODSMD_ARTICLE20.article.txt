# Humor, Not Cash, Is Essential Requisite of Co-Eds' Husbands

Wealth doesn't eount. Hand
someness isn't essential. But the
man who successfully would woo the
Stanford woman must be able to
appreciate the funny side of life.

He must have a good sense of humor.
These facts were revealed this
week in a survey of representative
Farm women. The ideal husband j
must be a little more intelligent than
| she is, and he must be on the whole !
a little superior to her in most char
acteristics if he is to command her J
love, honor, and obedience. He !
must take an interest in sports, be I
considerate and understanding, and j
| display a sense of responsibility. He |
need not be handsome, nor consti- j
tute, in collegiate terminology, "a i
good date." Above all, he needn't
be well to do.
Some Stanford women have a set
formula to which their ideal hus
bands must conform, while others,
less analytically inclined, would
"just know" the right man when he
comes along.
Women's Council Chairman Pat
F1 avel in a simple statement de
scribed her ideal man. "He doesn't
need to be all the superlatives which
an ideal husband is traditionally,"
she said. "Let him be as human as
the rest of us, but I would want a
man with a bigness about things not
found in just everybody."
The husband of Betty Grover,
junior woman on Ex Committee, |
will have to reconcile himself to
her pursuing a career. He must be
interested in good books, opera, and
plays. He must also bo adent at

some form of sport, such as golf,
tennis, or horseback riding. She
wouldn't mind if he were Rood look
ing, and he should have money
enough to get along.
