University Medical School's depart

PRESIDENT KAY LYMAN WIL
BUR: "Dr. Hinsey is one of the most
helpful men on the Stanford fac
ulty. He has entered into many ac
tivities willingly and we will be
sorry to see him go. But we are
glad that he has another opportunity
which he will enjoy. Sometimes
we've felt that we've been robbing
him of time for his medical studies."
DR. THOMAS STOREY , execu
tive head of the 8.A.C.: "I will miss
Joe Hinsey both as an associate and
as a personal friend. The boys cer
tainly will. He's known them all
personally and taken great interest
in them."
COACH TINY TIIORNHILL: "I
don't know where we'll find another
man like Joe Hinsey. He's been a
great friend and a great help to me
with the boys. They've all liked him
and sometimes they would tell him
things they wouldn't tell me."
DEAN GEORGE B. CULVER:
"Dr. Hinsey has been a remarkable
influence in anything he stepped
into. He likes fraternity work and
is a sincere friend of Stanford frater
nities. As an advisor to lower
division students he has helped
many students get started in medi
cine."
GRADUATE MANAGER AL
MASTERS: "Joe Hinsey has always
shown a keen insight into the prob
lems of intercollegiate activities. He
has been extremely successful in his
work with the Conference and it
will be hard to replace him."
