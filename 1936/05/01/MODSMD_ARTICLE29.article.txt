THE CO-OPERATIVE STORES
movement which is so popular in
England, Sweden, Denmark, and
Finland, has reached Palo Alto. For
many months a store for Palo Altans
has been housed directJy across the
. Inct from the police station.
The local unit is a grocery store
for I lie convenience of members and
the public. Members pay $10 as a
membership fee. This money goes to
■ toek the store with supplies; there
after the member can buy what he
wants at a price which soon saves
him enough money to make up for
the original investment.

HIE PALO ALTO society has 80
members. It claims to sell only the
finest, merchandise at prices below
(In- lowest rates of the largest chain
grocers, and prospers well.
'I he society formed by these
people who hand themselves to
gether provides a medium by
which consumers can collectively
imrchase and distribute commodi
ties. They insure a saving by so
doing and insure the quality of
the foods by careful choosing.
The thing works for the benefit of
consumers because they control the
management through a board of di
rectors thus it amounts to indus
rial democracy on a small but ef
o( live fashion.

WHATEVER SAVINGS may re
ult from this communal enterprise
•••re returned to the members in pro
ertion to the amount of their pur
liases—a sort of patronage dividend,
r gate prize.
The capital is secured from the
- riginal $10 membership fee, through
ivings, and loans, but there is no
•oek of any sort issued. Although
nyone may buy his groceries at
k e stores, the patronage dividends
re returned only to members.

THE IDEA IS AX old one, of
ourse. Practical application of it
I a.s been carried out in Europe and
merica for more than a century
nd is apparently satisfactory in all
ays and is economically sound.
The Consumer's Co-operative So
■ iety proves one thing: that a group
I' people working together can ac
( omplish more to their mutual eco
omic advantage than by acting in
< ividually. Co-operation instead of
( mipetition. Co-operation will take
are of mankind as effectively as
ompetition, and what's more, there
'on't be a lot of bones broken like
it re are in the devil-take-the-hind
ui.st rush of every man for himself.

'I HE NEW PHILIPPINE govern
lent is no old-fashioned instru-
K iifality. It has launched a national
dense program just like any Eu
>pcan country. All males 20 and
ver must register. From these men
■ill be chosen the first class con
•ripts who will begin training in
137.
General Douglas Mac Arthur, head
the U.S. army mission to the
hilippines, has worked out a pro
rarn for a standing army of about
»,OQO. The army will be augmented
y conscripts, but will never exceed
),000 in number of men under
rms. By 1946 the islands will have
)().(K)0 men fully trained.
1 he islands are not only progress-
U' niilitaristically, but their govern
h nt has had an auspicious start in
tier fields. Immediate confidence

ind order are being maintained.
\ r < iie of (he expected outbreaks and
mnditry have come and no foreign
lower has taken them over as yet.
