# Geology Professor Talks in San Jose
## 
### 
Dr. C. F. Tolman of the geology
department expounded a new theory
about the sinking floor of Santa
Clara Valley before the Engineers'
Club of San Jose yesterday.
Over-pumping from valley wells
has depleted water in underground
gravel channels until it has reduced
the pressure to such an extent that
the land is sinking, he said.
