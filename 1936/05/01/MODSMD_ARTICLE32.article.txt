# What Makes Sophs' Machine Click?

### Solon O. Swampum 
(The following Stanford-Day
| by-Day column will sip-pear dur-
I ing the coming A.S.S.U. election,
as an up-to-date bulletin board of
j political rumors.)
Two weeks ago the current ques
tion was "What's the sophomore
machine?"
Now it's, ''How do they do it?"
| For it met, quietly and without
| ballyhoo, and picked three candi
] dates. The entire Row contingent of
j sophs will back them to the limit.
Origin Traced
Who started it? Thy most logical
I rumor has it that Jim Ludlam, effi
j cient and political minded Sigma
| Chi, gave the inspiration to Dick
i Riddell and Guy Hagerty. These
j three were instrumental in calling

last spring and winter caucuses,
which nominated Jackie Brown and
Hank Luisetti for Ex Committee, and
watched without surprise as they
won by large margins.
Only Row holder-outers last year
were the Zetes. Their candidate lost.
This year, although no Zete ap
peared at the caucus, Tom Killefer
won the nomination. Why? No one
knows. Perhaps the sophs really
intend to choose the best available
man, regardless of affiliation. They
say they do.
Support Candidates
When Ja ckie Blown was picked
for the soph woman post. Pre Mer
win was slated to run for the junior
position, and Peg Woodard for class
secretary. These two were re
indorsed Wednesday night.
Big shots in the caucus include
Riddell, Hagerty, Guy Neely, Jack
Huddleston, Bud McDuffie, and Jack
Loupe â€” a majority of Sigma Chi's
and Phi Delts.
Clean Up on Jobs
As proof of their efficiency, 65
soph appointive positions were held
this year by the Row. Six sorori
ties divided 25 jobs, with two hold
ing half of these. Only 12 fraterni
ties were represented. Five held
half the posts. Notable absentees
from the caucus, and also from the
job list, were D.U., Phi Psi, Zete
(except for the presidential nomina
tion) and Kappa.
The caucus, reminded of this,
went on record as "favoring a more

democratic distribution of offices."
The caucus also came out into the
open, although some time after the
Damocles sword of a threatened Ex
Committee probe had been hung
over their heads.
"All on the up-and-up," say or
ganizers. "We want to get behind
the best candidate."
