If they can do it at Vassar, if they
can do it at Pomona, why can't they
do it here? Both Vassar and Po
mona have workable systems pro
viding for guest privileges in the
dining hall with no extra charge.
Stanford might profitably take a tip
on how it is done at other places.
Vassar's eight dining rooms, re
ports show, accommodate over
1100 women, approximately the
same number of women as attend
Stanford. These women may have
guests from other halls free of
charge. It is preferable that guests
come for dinner, although they may
come at lunch time if they so choose.
Vassar dining halls find no sign-
J'.p system necessary. Planning for
meals is done on a seasonal basis.
Each dining room has its own
kitchen with a central bakery. Tui
tion and board at Vassar, however,
are higher than at Stanford.
Pomona seems to have evolved an
ellicient means of granting guest
meal privileges. Women are allowed
nine guest meals free a semester.
If a woman misses three meals in
succession, .she is entitled to an ad
ditional guest meal, provided she
signs up for her absence in advance.
A list is posted in the dining hall
on which guests must be signed up
and absences noted. Pomona charges
slightly more for room and board
than does Stanford.
Such systems have proved work
able in other schools. If a work
able one c«n be evolved on the
Stanford campus much will have
been done to induce friendly rela
tions. A more friendly Hall-Row
spirit would be fostered with a more
frequent exchange of hospitalities.
Hall women would get a chance to
know women living in other halls if
they could informally drop in for
meals. Because of the give and take
between the various halls and the
Row, the cost of such a plan would
not be overly great. The return in
friendly feeling would certainly be
worth any additional cost entailed.
