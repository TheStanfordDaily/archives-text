# Last Remnant Of "500" Will Hold Picnic
## Ehrens, Hind Plan Beach Party for Seniors From Original Class of 1936 Sue Hammond 
### 
When in the spring quarter of
'33 a startled Roble dining hall was
told that the University Board of
Trustees had deeided to admit 300
additional women, bringing the total
from 500 to 800, the announcement
was met with loud boos.
Tomorrow, 44 of the 54 remnants
of the class who are still in sehool
will organize for the first, and prob
ably the last, time since their fresh
man year, for a beach picnic.
The party will meet at Roble at
10 o'clock in the morning, and will
travel to the beach near Half Moon
Bay for a day of swimming, sun
bathing, and games.
Elizabeth Ehrens and Edith Hind,
co-chairmen of the affair, have as
their assistants Jean Albertson, in
charge of organization and enter
tainment; Jean Anderson, food;
Wilma Conn, transportation; and
Mercedes Bergmann and Ruth
Nutting, contact.
The members of this old guard
have also ordered small scarf pins
in the shape of a 500 as a reminder
of "the good old days."
