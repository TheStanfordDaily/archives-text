UPPERCLASSMEN DEFEAT
FROSH, 7-1
Though unable to cope with the
no-hit pitching of Ruth Schmidt, j
the frosh still put up a good fight ,
against the uppercla ssmen in the
opening game of the oaseball season
on Tuesday. With the aid of a
couple of passes and errors they
managed to score one run and
threatened to put over two more.
Unfortunately for the freshmen,
"Weinie" Wilder put an end to that
rally by neglecting to touch the
plate when she ran home. The final
score was 7-1, the junior-senior ag
gregation having little trouble solv
ing the delivery of Kay Durrell, the
newly elected frosh captain, and
making nine hits. Maxine Dailey was I
the other half of the frosh battery
and is also manager of the team.
Dolly Burke, junior-senior cap
tain, Helen Watteis and Ruth
Schmidt led the hitting for the win
ners.
SOPHS CONCENTRATE
STRENGTH IN ONE TEAM
Rather than have two mediocre
teams, the sophs, according to Man- j
ager Maxine Moore, have decided to j
concentrate their strength on one
team. In this way they will have
one team formidable enough to at
least threaten the upperclassmen;
though the second group will be de
cidedly weak.
Besides having strong material the
sophs No. 1 have good competitive
spirit, a quality which the frosh up
till now seem to have lacked. They
have two good pitchers in Patsy
Kennedy and Gertrude Polcar. Both
are still a little wild but have im

proved a great deal since the be- j
ginning of the practice season. Max |
Moore is a capable catcher and a |
! reliable batter. Ila Lee Ainsworth,
' Frances Bonfilio, Barbara Alexander,
' and Mary Jane Hawley should all
| be strong in the field.
THREE GAMES j
SCHEDULED NEXT WEEK
Next week will see the frosh
meeting sophs No. 2 on Monday,
sophs No. 1 and juniors-seniors j
playing Tuesday, and the frosh chal
lenging sophs No. 1 on Thursday. !
The final game of the first round
will be on the following Monday
between the upperclassmen and j
sophs No. 2.
The final round will begin a week
I or so later and will culminate on
i Field Day, June 2, when the all-stars
will meet the faculty.
