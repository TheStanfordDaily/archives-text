# Stanford Woman Strives For Career in Engineering
## 
### Sally Taber 
"These engineering women" is a
good old saying, but actually true
at Stanford if you put it in the
singular. Mary de Fremery Atkins,
only woman member of the Stan
ford chapter of the American So
ciety of Civil Engineers, can prove
that.
Statistics indicate that Mary is the
best apple polisher in the Engineer
ing Department. She comes from a
| family of engineers, her father being
a mining engineer, and her uncle in
| the mechanical branch. Her highest
interests in Galileo High School in
San Francisco pointed toward engi
neering, and she has devoted prac
tically all of her college career to
that field of study.
Being an engineer, Mary has had
i no time for a minor course. When
j not in "Double E" lab, she knits,
I plays tennis, and catches frogs in
j Lagunita. She is one of the very
j few women ever to have been out
on the catwalks of the San Francisco

I Bay bridge. One of her more digni
fied activities is working for the !
1 cause of peace on the Stanford
Peace Committee, of which she is a :
charter member.
Mary spends summers and occa- |
I sional week-ends at the family
! ranch next to that of Dean Hoover, j
about 14 miles north of Pescadero, ;
on the ocean. There she swims, j
I fishes, and entertains.
