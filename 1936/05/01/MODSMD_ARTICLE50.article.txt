# SAILING CLUB MEETS
## 
### 
Stanford yachting enthusiasts last
night laid plans for the formation
of a Farm Sailing Club from which
will be chosen a crew to represent
Stanford in the Intercollegiate Re
gatta in June. A committee was
selected to draw up by-laws and
constitution to be presented for Ex
Committee's approval next Tuesday
night.
