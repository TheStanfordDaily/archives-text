# Golf Entries Called For In Novice Match
## 
### 
Disappointed at the small number
of men to enter the Novice Golf
tournament, Coach Twiggs yester
day issued a call for all eligible to
qualify before the time expires on
next Tuesday.
The novice tournament was re
vived last year at the request of
students who wished a restricted
tournament in which they would
have a chance to show their stuff
without being eliminated early in the
match by excess experience of some
of the men who entered the All-
University tournament.
Coach Twiggs has supported the
idea from the very start but is still
unable to put on a tournament with
out entries. Two or three flights are
planned, so it is apparent that all
who try will have a chance. There
will be a prize for the winners of
each flight.
In the past years, golf classes sup
ply the backbone of the entries,
although the event is not limited to
them exclusively. Last year the
winner was Jim Dillon, who this
year is playing the seventh position
on the varsity.
