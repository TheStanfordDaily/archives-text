# Dopester Sees Indian Broom as Local Hope
## 
### R. B. Jones 
Little fivers and big fifties will
slide over bookie tables tomorrow
at ihe Kentucky Derby, and at
Stanford the majority of ducats will
be bought up on Indian Broom, that
Tanforan classic winner and pos
sessor of the world record in the
mile and sixteenth.
Saturday at Churchill Downs the
country's best nags will be running
against the "Broom" in a mile and
a quarter—but that little three
year-old had plenty of run left in
him when he finished the Tanforan
handicapper leading Top Row and
Azucar by a good six lengths.
Brevity East Favorite
Brevity is the favorite in the East
and is the horse Indian Broom has
to beat, if the money is to come back
to Stanford racing fans.
Now it's a question of l'ain, and
from all appearances the track is
going to be wet. The rain, however,
won't keep Indian Broom from going
places—in a test against the mud
Major Austin C. Taylor's colt was
clocked at a nice 1:40 in a mile and
sixteenth.
Consensus Choices
With Indian Broom as the set-up
for a combine, ticket, pick Brevity,
Teufel, Granville to follow in close,

but if it rains hard enough. Grand
Slam will be second only to Indian
j Broom. Your best long-shot bet is
He Did, winner of the Santa Anita
I Derby two years ago.
Weights go up at the Derby with
! every colt carrying 124 pounds and
one filly entree, Gold Seeker, tot
ing only 120.
