TURF CLASSIC
UP TOMOSKOW
The big thing in spoils over the
week-end, "besides the Olympic pre
view at the Coliseum tomorrow and
the Black Foxe polo match today,
is the Darby.
This week 70,000 witnesses trek
to Louisville, just like this week
every other year — dowagers from
country club sun-porches, hood
lums from neighboring towns, touts
from tracks of the country, wealthy
sportsmen with tie-pins in cravats,
business men on holidays, old
codgers from the hills, guy bladish
coxcombs from th? city—all there to
watch the running of the grand
American classic.
And they all have their choice,
their pick, their cinch hunch. In
the pre-race babble and confu
sion over the blue-blood cocktail,
or the sporting whiskey, or the
prolctariot beer each pick in its
turn sounds incontrovertible, each
naming of "the winnah" echoes
across the room resounding with
the clarion call of truth. There
seem to be a dozen sure winners.
But once away from the madding
crowd you reflect and* feel sure that
no one can ever positively predict
(he winner. It is all a guess, a
chance, a prejudiced rationalization.
But once the race is run and
won, the winner is photographed
with the glowing jockey up and
the pretty girl alongside and the
horseshoe of flowers you can
slrangcly* remember no predic
tions hut those which picked the
winner and you wonder why you
were sap enough to miss the cinch
bet. Then next year it will he
the same story all over again.
I personally don't think (he reign
ing favorite, Brevity, will win.
The favorites lately have just not
been coming in. Brevity, with the
old world's record with weight on,
is one of the top stake horses in the
land, but has everything to lose to
morrow.
Indian Broom, the Tanfo and
campus favorite, may win, but
he'll be carrying 20 more pounds
than when he set the world's rec
ord a month ago. But biby, there's
a pony with a stride, and is going
fast to the top.
The Teufel-Granville entry is a
fine bet; He Did is.no slouch; Grand
Slam is a possibility; Sangreal, The
Fighter, Forest Play, Noble Star all
are still in the reckoning. It will be
up to the Derby standard.
A CATHARSIS ON
SHAW MYSTERY
On the bulletin board this morn
ing was a note for the sports edi
tor. It was signed "Frank Shaw"
and gave the low-down about the
Shaw about whom I wrote in this
column yesterday — "the mystery
half-miler," you might recall if yau
read Slants yesterday, who outran
the Calcub captain for 700 of 880
yards in the Little Big Meet a week
ago, in his first race, and with street
shoes on.
Here is the gist of the Frank
Shaw message: Charles Shaw (that's
the frosh's name) was out for high
jumping, once cleared 5.11 with no
coaching. His father was a Stanford
man and while in high school at
Lewiston, Idaho, tied the world rec
ord for the 50-yard dash. Chas.
never* ran a half-mile before last
Friday.
Thank you, Frank Shaw; tell Chas.
to go out and train for three or four
weeks and then see what he can run
a half in. Four bits he could do
2:05 at least. •
DOC lIINSEY'S leaving the cam
pus for Cornell is a source of regret
for many athletes on the Farm who
knew and liked him.
As a Conference and B.A.C. man
he has done much to further the
cause of his constituents, the men
who are out for sports, and the root
ers thereof.
He was a steady spectator at foot
ball and track afternoon workouts,
with a good word for all and a smile
on his face. He never said too much,
but said the right thing at the right
time and many a witty jest at ap
propriate times. So we'll wish you
good luck, Doc. —Breed

A CATHARSIS ON
SHAW MYSTERY
On the bulletin board this morn
ing was a note for the sports edi
tor. It was signed "Frank Shaw"
and gave the low-down about the
Shaw about whom I wrote in this
column yesterday — "the mystery
half-miler," you might recall if yau
read Slants yesterday, who outran
the Calcub captain for 700 of 880
yards in the Little Big Meet a week
ago, in his first race, and with street
shoes on.
Here is the gist of the Frank
Shaw message: Charles Shaw (that's
the frosh's name) was out for high
jumping, once cleared 5.11 with no
coaching. His father was a Stanford
man and while in high school at
Lewiston, Idaho, tied the world rec
ord for the 50-yard dash. Chas.
never* ran a half-mile before last
Friday.
Thank you, Frank Shaw; tell Chas.
to go out and train for three or four
weeks and then see what he can run
a half in. Four bits he could do
2:05 at least. •
DOC lIINSEY'S leaving the cam
pus for Cornell is a source of regret
for many athletes on the Farm who
knew and liked him.
As a Conference and B.A.C. man
he has done much to further the
cause of his constituents, the men
who are out for sports, and the root
ers thereof.
He was a steady spectator at foot
ball and track afternoon workouts,
with a good word for all and a smile
on his face. He never said too much,
but said the right thing at the right
time and many a witty jest at ap
propriate times. So we'll wish you
good luck, Doc. —Breed

He was a steady spectator at foot
ball and track afternoon workouts,
with a good word for all and a smile
on his face. He never said too much,

good luck, Doc. —Breed
TURF CLASSIC
UP TOMOSKOW
The big thing in spoils over the
week-end, "besides the Olympic pre
view at the Coliseum tomorrow and
the Black Foxe polo match today,
is the Darby.
This week 70,000 witnesses trek
to Louisville, just like this week
every other year — dowagers from
country club sun-porches, hood
lums from neighboring towns, touts
from tracks of the country, wealthy
sportsmen with tie-pins in cravats,
business men on holidays, old
codgers from the hills, guy bladish
coxcombs from th? city—all there to
watch the running of the grand
American classic.
And they all have their choice,
their pick, their cinch hunch. In
the pre-race babble and confu
sion over the blue-blood cocktail,
or the sporting whiskey, or the
prolctariot beer each pick in its
turn sounds incontrovertible, each
naming of "the winnah" echoes
across the room resounding with
the clarion call of truth. There
seem to be a dozen sure winners.
But once away from the madding
crowd you reflect and* feel sure that
no one can ever positively predict
(he winner. It is all a guess, a
chance, a prejudiced rationalization.
But once the race is run and
won, the winner is photographed
with the glowing jockey up and
the pretty girl alongside and the
horseshoe of flowers you can
slrangcly* remember no predic
tions hut those which picked the
winner and you wonder why you
were sap enough to miss the cinch
bet. Then next year it will he
the same story all over again.
I personally don't think (he reign
ing favorite, Brevity, will win.
The favorites lately have just not
been coming in. Brevity, with the
old world's record with weight on,
is one of the top stake horses in the
land, but has everything to lose to
morrow.
Indian Broom, the Tanfo and
campus favorite, may win, but
he'll be carrying 20 more pounds
than when he set the world's rec
ord a month ago. But biby, there's
a pony with a stride, and is going
fast to the top.
The Teufel-Granville entry is a
fine bet; He Did is.no slouch; Grand
Slam is a possibility; Sangreal, The
Fighter, Forest Play, Noble Star all
are still in the reckoning. It will be
up to the Derby standard.
A CATHARSIS ON
SHAW MYSTERY
On the bulletin board this morn
ing was a note for the sports edi
tor. It was signed "Frank Shaw"
and gave the low-down about the
Shaw about whom I wrote in this
column yesterday — "the mystery
half-miler," you might recall if yau
read Slants yesterday, who outran
the Calcub captain for 700 of 880
yards in the Little Big Meet a week
ago, in his first race, and with street
shoes on.
Here is the gist of the Frank
Shaw message: Charles Shaw (that's
the frosh's name) was out for high
jumping, once cleared 5.11 with no
coaching. His father was a Stanford
man and while in high school at
Lewiston, Idaho, tied the world rec
ord for the 50-yard dash. Chas.
never* ran a half-mile before last
Friday.
Thank you, Frank Shaw; tell Chas.
to go out and train for three or four
weeks and then see what he can run
a half in. Four bits he could do
2:05 at least. •
DOC lIINSEY'S leaving the cam
pus for Cornell is a source of regret
for many athletes on the Farm who
knew and liked him.
As a Conference and B.A.C. man
he has done much to further the
cause of his constituents, the men
who are out for sports, and the root
ers thereof.
He was a steady spectator at foot
ball and track afternoon workouts,
with a good word for all and a smile
on his face. He never said too much,
but said the right thing at the right
time and many a witty jest at ap
propriate times. So we'll wish you
good luck, Doc. —Breed
