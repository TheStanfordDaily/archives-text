# Black Foxe Polo Team To Meet Indians Today
## Military Academy Riders Scored Wins Over Cal, U.C.L.A. Early in Year 
### 
Having defeated both University
of California and U.C.L.A., the
Black Foxe Military Institute will
meet the Stanford polo team this
afternoon at 3 o'clock. Captain
Grubbs, Indian coach, expects to
use mostly s'econd-string Squad A
men instead of the usual line-up.
Don McAusland, hard rider and
expert stickman of the Card squad,
will play No. 1. In the No. 2 posi
tion will be Beit Hyde, accurate
hitter who should chalk up a good
percentage of the Stanford score.
John Coffin, who in four years of
varsity competition has developed
into a good steady position player,
will be in the No. 3 saddle for the
Indians. Playing in the back posi
tion will be Ed McKeon, who has
earned his position through hard,
accurate hitting. McKeon is also a
lour-year man, and scores a large
number of long shots and will score
plenty of goals for the Cards this
afternoon.
Playing for Biack Foxe will be
three men who have made a fine
record playing together for the, last
several years. Tom Beal, who will
play No. 2 for the Hollywood team,
is the brother of Carl Beal, former
star of the Card polo team, who was
injured while playing at Midwiek
last vacation.
Chester Foxe, son of Major Foxe,
who is head of the school, is young
est of the three veterans. He will
play in the No. 3 position. Barnc
son, outstanding horseman of the
Black Foxe squad, will be in the
back position.
The Indian poloists won a close
game against Captain Pilkington's
aggregation last year, but' their
good record this year shows that
the Black Foxe riders have an ex
ceptionally fine team this year and
have good chances against the In
dians.
