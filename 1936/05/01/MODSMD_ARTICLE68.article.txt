## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Stanford Loses As Cornell Med Takes One of Farm's Busiest Professors 
### 
When Dr. Joseph C. Hinsey leaves Stanford
to take over a professorship at the Cornell Med
ical College late this summer, the Farm will
lose an exceedingly capable physiology pro
fessor. But the University, and Pacific Coast
universities collectively, will lose much more
than this.
Dr. Hinsey is a physiologist, absorbed in, and
highly valuable to his profession. But he also
is dependable, intelligent, and progressive as
one of the leaders of the Pacic Coast Athletic
Conference.
Although an active worker in more "extra
professorial" activities than almost any other
man on the Stanford faculty, Dr. Hinsey rates
intercollegiate athletics as his chief avocation.
The familiarity and accuracy on details that
his interest in research has given him, have
made him an ideal faculty athletic representa

tive, in the sense that he is responsible for tech
nicalities of eligibility, etc., for every Stanford
athlete.
Added to this are his progressive attitude and
high idealistic code of ethics concerning ama
teur athletics, both of which traits make him
one of the most respected Coast Conference
representatives.
Because of his many interests on the campus,
and his many positions on Stanford's "key"
committees, Dr. Hinsey has been one of the
busiest men on the Fajrm since he joined the
faculty six years ago.
Yet students who have known him in the
classroom, in Interfraternity Board or Council
session, on the athletic field, or in the 8.A.C.,
and faculty men who have been associated with
him in his numerous University duties, join in
asserting that Dr. Hinsey has never been too
busy to be a "good Joe."
