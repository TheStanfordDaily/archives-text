# Just So They Don't Die Of Their Own Righteousness
## 
### 
Since the sophomore star chamber has come
out in the open and Mr. Riddell has been elected
permanent chairman despite the fact that he
confessed absolute ignorance of any sopho
more "political machine" at Ex Committee Tues
day night, the campus now may learn a few
lessons in political juvenalia.
The obvious conclusions from the whole
amusing performance is that politics are very
exciting and very much fun, which is true
within limits. There is also the obvious con
clusion, now that the sophomore star chamber
has come out in the open and admitted such
novel humanitarian sentiments as a desire to
get the "best men for the best offices," that it
has already destroyed its function.
In case the sophomores had forgotten, the
supposedly munificent Row caucus also has ex
isted for the same purpose. Therefore, unless
the sophomore ring has some illegitimate pur
pose, such as political control, or centralized
bossism in some naive egocentric political odd
ity on the campus, it will soon die of sheer
humanitarianism.
However, if it does continue in its boyish en
thusiasm, we suggest that the Halls organize a

counter-society to get the "best men for the
best office" lest the political hounds of the Row
get to quarreling over the putrefying carcass.
