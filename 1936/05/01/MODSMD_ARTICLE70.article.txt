# Election By Propaganda

(Editor's Note: The psychology of being on the
winning side forms another technique of Ilearst
cria, as Mr. Saadi explains in his final article of
(he "Election by Propaganda"' series.)
Turn to the political pages of this morning's Chron
icle or Examiner and see another effective technique
of Hearsteria.
Everyone wants to be on the winning side! Hence
each party will strive to assure the public that it will
win—in fact, that it will sweep the country.
Note the manner in which Mr. Hearst ballyhoos
the meager winnings of Landon and censors the over
whelming victories of the New Deal. See how the
Chronicle headlines the chances of the Warren Un
instructed Delegation to win and ignores the avalanche
of votes claimed by Hearst. These efforts may be
based on pure fiction.

This is the same spirit in which football fans react
lo sport page Hearstism. If they think their team has
a chance to win—they will go to see the game.
To stimulate the impression that its ticket is win
ning there is one very good and effective strategy.
Always, the party must play up its own side and
neglect to mention (in fact, it must studiedly censor)
all news favorable to the enemy. That is one of the
"inalienable rights" of a free press.
Next, good strategy requires that only popu
lar and well liked names be used to endorse your
candidate and that all people who are disliked
lie shown as supporting your opponent.
That i.s the reason the Republican Chronicle re
iterates with front page editorials that a hair-brained
Democrat from New York is trying to steal the Cali
fornia delegation. That is why it capitalizes on Mr.
Hearst's general unpopularity in order to defeat the
Landon ticket. That i.s why it repeatedly reviews the
manner in which Hearst "sold out" the presidential del
egation in 1932.

It will be fun to see the Old Guard Republicans
squirm when they find they have to sleep in the same
bed with Hearst after Landon wins in June.
Just as the Chronicle trios to frighten people away
from the Landon ticket by appealing to the popular
hatred of Hearst —so does Hearst use the opposite
technique to win support.
In this morning's Examiner you will find a whole
series of stories describing how Mr. So and So, promi
nent lawyer, has swung to Landon; Dr. Such and
Such, famous physician, is leading* a Landon-for-
Prcsident Club; Mrs. This and That has just changed
her registration from Democrat to Republican so that
she may help "balance the budget"; well-liked Sena
tor Diohaid has denounced the Warren delegation and
so on, ad nauseam.
This technique of judiciously using well-liked
names to win support and disliked names to cast in
sinuations on the opponents i.s not just space filler.

Experiments conducted by me in 1931-32 showed
that even college students are unconsciously affected
by such suggestions. When names of well-liked per
sons are attached to controversial statements (whether
actually made by them or not) Stanford students were
found to agree more readily with those statements.
On th< other hand, when the same statements are
attributed to highlv disliked persons, the students un
consciously reacted by disagreement.
If college students are so susceptible to suggestion
by a mere name, what can he expected of the average
voter?
