# A 						Mere Gesture, Yet An Appropriate Tribute
## 
### 
Because the Farm went over the top in the
drive for Convalescent Home funds to the ex
tent of $7,637, a more permanent benefit will
be received by the Home and at the same time
a laudable tribute will be paid to one of the
pioneers of the University.
Ex Committee at its last meeting put $2,000
of the Drive money into the Timothy Hopkins
Memorial Fund, one of four funds being built
up to provide *a source of steady income
through interest for the Home.
The Home's budget this year counted on
I $4,000 from the Stanford student body; this was
[ a necessary part of the current operating ex
penses. Allocating a part of the excess to a
separate fund in honor of the trustee who was
so actively associated with the University since
its beginning, was merely a gesture, but it was
an appropriate and highly fitting one.
