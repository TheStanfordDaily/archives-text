# They'll Be Chosen By Real Connoisseurs
## 
### 
Infinite wisdom is shown by our primitive
contemporary, the Chappie mag, in whipping
out its spring love contest.
Last year Chappie chose the loveliest women
by having the women vote on them. This
elicited a storm of protest.
Student revolutionaries were revolted at the
i idea of women being connoisseurs of beauty or
loveliness. Because, argued the men, women
did not know.
This year Chappie is letting the men pick
them. Like most beauty contests, this may elicit
a storm of protest, because it becomes increas
ingly evident from day to day that men do not
know either.
