# Our Hasher Sez:
## 
### 
The Phi Dolls have an idea that Our Hasher is
picking on them. Quite a few of them deny yester
day's story about the baking powder-swallowing act,
so I'll tell another story on them today.
This, of course, is to keep the Phi Delts' name be
fore the public. And the Phi Delts' name being what
it is, you can see what political reverberations it has.
Naturally, the Phi Delts resent having their name in
the paper all the time, particularly those Phi Delts
who tell me the stories.
The story, though old, is still no good.. It seems
that the Phi Delts had a candidate for the Masque
Ball King. Now ther candidate is a rather close-fisted
individual and is said to consider a snack at the
What Lug Tavernacle, and walking home to avoid the
taxi fare, a dinner-dance. But it appears that he
finally persuaded himself to lay $30 on the line in
memoriam of ar? expected appearance as King Kong
ruous.
In addition to the awful pain of defeat the candidate
had to face the pangs of parental remorse, when the
chief, who runs a bank and owns half of Los Angeles,
heard about it. Legend says that the father was even
more parsimonious than the ofTsprung. The guv'nor,
it is said, would make his partner pay for the snack
at the What Lug Tavernacle.
So with weal and woe, the son waited cowering lo
think what would happen if Los Angeles' landlord
heard the av/ful news.
Right smack-smack after the startling defeat the
candidate received this telegram from pape: "Glad
to see you are having so much fun at your own ex
pense, sorry you wore defeated."
Next week: Complete new serial on the Phi Delts
and the Deegoes. Watch for it.
