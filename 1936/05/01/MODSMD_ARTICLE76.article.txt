## $24.50 WORTH OF SENIOR WEEK 
### 
Miss Mary Kosher,
Chairman, Publicity Committee for
Senior Week,
University of Washington
Dear Mary:
So you want to know about the
costs of Senior Week at Stanford!

Those were fair
questions you
asked, and quite
timely too, be
cause I, not being
a senior, didn't
know about the
finishing touch
they put on a
man's financial
problems down
here until I start
ed looking for
your answers.
Yes, senior

week is something of a tradition on
the Farm. It gives those who have
completed their 180 units with an
average of "C" an opportunity to
stick around for a while longer in
the place which, after four years,
seems like a pretty nice piece of
territory after all. Officially it means
the only big-time all-night dance
of the year, a picnic, and commence
ment. Unofficially it means a legiti
mate opportunity to beat a steadier
than usual tattoo on the jug or to sit
and reflect upon the mild appear
ance of long rows of classrooms
which no longer harbor horrors of
8 o'clocks and final exams. Officially
it costs roughly $24.

Who is allowed to attend the Sen
ior Ball, you ask? Well, there's been

some discussion about that. It takes;
a senior to buy a bid, of course, but j
you see the bids cost between $8 and ;
$10 and so all the seniors don't go.
But anybody can buy one by proxy
and get in.
One interesting thing is that all ;
seniors must lay down $1.50 for
"class dues" before they can do any- i
thing in Senior Week. If they want
a program, that's a dollar. An
nouncements are 10 cents apiece or 1
20 for $2.

j
Graduation itself is a $10 affair.
You pay $7.50 to rent a cap and
gown, and if, after you've worn it
for a couple of hours or so you turn
it back intact, you get a $2.50 refund.
Your diploma, paradoxical though
it may seem, is the first thing you
pay for down here. Before you even
start in as a frosh you pay a $10
matriculation fee. If you last four
years, five of that goes to pay for
your sheepskin. If you don't last, it
just goes.
Now all this is highly necessary
for every class has traditional obli
gations to meet. There's a two by
two brass plate to be laid on the
walk of the inner Quad. That costs
$207. Then there's $200 which must
be left behind in a "class fund" to
pay for future reunions. And there's
always the parting gift of another
drinkinq fountain or a new en
dowment which involves around
$450.
Yours,
John McClelland
