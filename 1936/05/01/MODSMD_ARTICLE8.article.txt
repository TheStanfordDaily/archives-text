BATTLE CREEK, Mich., April 30
(TP). â€”Two former officers of Michi
gan old age pension clubs testified
at a Congressional hearing today
they deserted the Townsend organ
ization because they were convinced
it was a "money racket."
The testimony was given by the
Rev. David B. Moore, 60, of Traverse
City, and Mrs. Juanita H. Jackson,
of Jackson, before a small audience
of elderly people who booed re
peatedly at criticism of the $200-a
-month proposal.
Rep. Clare E. Hoffman (R., Mich.),
conducting tht* investigation in his
home state, previously had declared
in a formal statement that the hear
ings had convinced him "the plan is
a racket, whatever the original pur
pose may have been."
Mrs. Gladys Brittain, secretary of
a club at Niles, Mich., told of dis
covering a shortage in club ac
counts when she took office. She
advised national and regional head
quarters of the Townsend organiza
tion of the misappropriation, she
testified, but received no reply.
