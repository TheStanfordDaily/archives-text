# Seniors Will Decide Scene Of Graduation
## Committee To Confer On Chapel Services; Stadium Abandoned 
### 
If approved by senior committee
heads at their meeting tonight, Com
mencement for the class of '36 will
take place in the Memorial Chapel,
Woody Adams, senior president, an
nounced last night.
The plan of returning the Com
mencement exercises to the Chapel,
instead of having them in the sta
dium as was done last year, was
brought up and approved by the
Public Exercises Committee, in con
junction with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Adams.
Osborne Outlines Reasons
Professor George Osborne will
outline the reasons for the plan at
the senior officials' meeting tonight
at 7:15 o'clock. Chief among them is
the fact that the cost of fixing up the
Stadium so that it provides a proper
background is so great that it is not
feasible.
Last year's experiment was started
because of various complaints that
the Chapel was too small and too
uncomfortable for the crowd which
usually attends the ceremony.
If the Chapel is chosen as scene
for Commencement, tickets will be
limited, with probably two or three
going to each senior. However, when
the ceremonies were held in the
Chapel two years ago, there was
much extra space, so that friends
may be able to attend.
Dues Payable at P.O.
Next year, and all following years,
the problem of where to hold Com
mencement will be eliminated, since
the amphitheater, now under con
struction, will provide proper facili
ties for the exercises.
Finance chairman Liz Ehrens an
nounced last night that senior dues,
which amount to $1.50, may be paid
at the Post Office from 10 to 12
o'clock today, tomorrow, and Wed
nesday. On May 15, dues will be
raised to $2.
