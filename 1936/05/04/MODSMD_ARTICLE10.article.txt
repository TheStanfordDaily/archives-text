# Government Moves To Save Woodpecker
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 3.â€”The gov
ernment came to the rescue of the
woodpecker last week, when it was
told that the crested woodpecker is
threatened with extinction. It is
sued a plea to the bird's principal
enemies, boys with shotguns, to
show mercy.
Ira Gabrielson, chief of the Bio
logical Survey, described the bird
as being almost as large as a crow.
It. is technically called the crested or
"pileated" woodpecker, and since it
is a slow flyer has become a target
for youngsters.
