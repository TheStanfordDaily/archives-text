Developments in the situation at
! a glance:
ADDIS ABABA. — Struck by a
I stray bullet fired in native rioting
| was Mrs. A. R. Stadin, of Loma
■ Linda, California, wife of the Sev-
I enth Day Adventist missionary phy
j sician there.
With the Emperor and his entire
I government gone, the capital has
j been given over to pillage, battle,
| and murder, with foreign civilians
' cowering in the fortified British le
gation, and war correspondents bar-
J ricaded in their own compound.
British troops opened fire upon
native rioters during the evacuation
I of the Turkish legation.
I DJIBOUTI, French Somaliland.—
A British destroyer bound for Ara
! bia en route to England bore Em
peror Hailie Selassie, his court, and
the entire imperial family • from
fallen Ethiopia. An Italian news
i paperman who attempted to photo
graph the fleeing Emperor was for
cibly rebuffed by his retainers.
WASHINGTON. — Italian troops
are but 10 or 12 miles from Addis
| Ababa, wirelessed American Minis
i ter Cornelius Van H. Engert to the
State Department today, and are
expected easily to enter the city to
| morrow.
GENEVA.—That Premier Musso
lini will seat a puppet emperor upon
the throne of the King of Kings to
whom he will dictate his own peace
I terms was generally anticipated to
night by League of Nations mem
bers. The existence of an independ
ent Amharic state will probably con
tinue to be recognized, they thought,
with large territorial grants and
other privileges to Italy.
ROME.— At least 400,000 of the
half-million Italian soldiers and
workers now in Ethiopia will remain
there as settlers, indicated Premier
Mussolini in a good-humored speech
j to celebrating rural peasants, gath
ered to receive gifts for land tenures.
