# B.A.C. To Act On Card Entry In N.C.A.A.
## Participation in Eastern Meet To Be Decided; New Trackfest Slated 
### 
Decision as to whether Stanford
will be represented by a team entry
at the N.C.AA. track meet and
regional Olympic tryouts in Chicago
June 19 and 20 will be made at
the Board of Athletic Control meet
ing Wednesday night, according to
A1 Masters, graduate manager.
With participation in the 1.C.4-A.
at Philadelphia on Memorial Day
definitely out of the picture in favor
of the renewed Pacific Coast Intcr
collegiates at Berkeley the same day,
track faction efforts turn toward the
proposition of the Chicago meet, in
which classic anywhere from six to
ten Cardinal trackmen ought to be
at home.
Meanwhile Bill Monahan, retiring
I manager at California, who is as
suming charge of the Intercollegi
j.ates, announces that preparations are
really going forward, and that each
of the nine conference schools who
are expected will be limited to 15
men each to give the smaller and
more distant schools a bigger break.
Plans are still tentative for the
P.A.A. Regional Olympic meet
i scheduled for Stanford Stadium on
| June 13, just after finals week.
