Ladies, yen can slop standing
| on your heads in order to be
beautiful, but you'd better start
sleeping raw, "standing tall," and
I "sitting tall," according to Dr. J.
Howard Crum, New York beauty
expert and exposer of "beauty
hokum."
"Just take your hair down and
go to bed as nature intended,"
Dr. Crum told the beauty experts'
trade convention in Los Angeles.
"Pajamas merely get in the way
and make sleeping uncomfort
able."
The "standing-on-head" beauty
system, he said, is just a trick
It makes blood rush to the head.
! "The blood will get there anyway
without women trying to be hu
man flies," Dr. Crum promised.
