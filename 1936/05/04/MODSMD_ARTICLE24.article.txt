# Farm Favors Slow Tunes Over Swing
## 
### Dave Botsford 
Swing music and "jam sessions"
may be taking American collegiana
by storm, but when Stanford stu
dents piek their favorite songs, they
take 'em sweet and slow.
Eighty Farmsters proved this last
week when, in a Daily survey, they
put such heart-jerkers as "Tempta
tion," "The Very Thought of You,"
"Alone," and "East of the Sun" on
their "best songs" list. Fifty men
and 30 women were given lists of the
40 hit tunes published in each of the
last three years.
"Temptation" Favored
"Three "soulful" melodies led the
1933 bests. "Temptation" led the
lot in both men's and women's
choices. "Time On My Hands,"
"Love Is the Sweetest Thing," and
"The Last Round -up" were not far
behind. Other favorites remembered
by the voters wore "Moon Song,"
"Penthouse Serenade," and "Fare
well to Arms."
"Carioca," probably one of the
most popular 1933 songs at the time,
received few votes.
1931 Choices
"Sophisticated Lady" nosed out
"The Very Thought of You" by one
vote for the 1934 favorite. The men,
however, chose "Smoke Get.s in
Your Eyes" before cither of them.
"Love in Bloom," "Be Still My
Heart." and "Getting Sentimental"
were also high favorites.
"Let's Fall in Love," which was
played on the air most in 1934, fell
far behind. "Continental" and "I

Saw Stars," bin hits at the height of
their popularity, did too.
Other 1934 choices: "Cocktails for
Two," "Two Cigarettes in the Dark,"
"June in January," "Moonglow,"
and "Thank You for a Lovely
Evening."
Men, Women Disagree
The men and women couldn't get
together on the 1935 best. "Alone"
was far ahead with the men but few
women chose it. They checked
"Please Believe Me" most. "East of
the Sun," though, sneaked in for a
second after "Alone." Fourth choice
was "Dinner for One, Please James,"
never too popular on the Saturday
night Hit Parade.
Other hits picked from last year's
pieces were "I'm In the Mood for
Love," "Clouds," and "Red Sails in
the Sunset."
Addicts Explain "Swing"
Interesting to note was that two
big 1935 songs fared badly in the
balloting. No one chose "Little
Gypsy Tearoom" and few remem
bered "Chasing Shadows."
Each person marked choices from
first to fifth in each year, and the
choices were weighted accordingly
in the recording.
"Temptation" was far ahead as the
best song of all three years. Swing
addicts, explaining the dearth of
"hot and fast" winners, say their
favorites are not so much particular
songs but rather the orchestrations
of particular orchestras. Anyway,
they say they'll continue to "swing
it."

"Alone," and "East of the Sun" on
their "best songs" list. Fifty men
and 30 women were given lists of the
40 hit tunes published in each of the
last three years.
"Temptation" Favored
"Three "soulful" melodies led the
1933 bests. "Temptation" led the
lot in both men's and women's
choices. "Time On My Hands,"
"Love Is the Sweetest Thing," and
"The Last Round -up" were not far
behind. Other favorites remembered
by the voters wore "Moon Song,"
"Penthouse Serenade," and "Fare
well to Arms."
"Carioca," probably one of the
most popular 1933 songs at the time,
received few votes.
1931 Choices
"Sophisticated Lady" nosed out
"The Very Thought of You" by one
vote for the 1934 favorite. The men,
however, chose "Smoke Get.s in
Your Eyes" before cither of them.
"Love in Bloom," "Be Still My
Heart." and "Getting Sentimental"
were also high favorites.
"Let's Fall in Love," which was
played on the air most in 1934, fell
far behind. "Continental" and "I

Saw Stars," bin hits at the height of
their popularity, did too.
Other 1934 choices: "Cocktails for
Two," "Two Cigarettes in the Dark,"
"June in January," "Moonglow,"
and "Thank You for a Lovely
Evening."
Men, Women Disagree
The men and women couldn't get
together on the 1935 best. "Alone"
was far ahead with the men but few
women chose it. They checked
"Please Believe Me" most. "East of
the Sun," though, sneaked in for a
second after "Alone." Fourth choice
was "Dinner for One, Please James,"
never too popular on the Saturday
night Hit Parade.
Other hits picked from last year's
pieces were "I'm In the Mood for
Love," "Clouds," and "Red Sails in
the Sunset."
Addicts Explain "Swing"
Interesting to note was that two
big 1935 songs fared badly in the
balloting. No one chose "Little
Gypsy Tearoom" and few remem
bered "Chasing Shadows."
Each person marked choices from
first to fifth in each year, and the
choices were weighted accordingly
in the recording.
"Temptation" was far ahead as the
best song of all three years. Swing
addicts, explaining the dearth of
"hot and fast" winners, say their
favorites are not so much particular
songs but rather the orchestrations
of particular orchestras. Anyway,
they say they'll continue to "swing
it."
Swing music and "jam sessions"
may be taking American collegiana
by storm, but when Stanford stu
dents piek their favorite songs, they
take 'em sweet and slow.
Eighty Farmsters proved this last
week when, in a Daily survey, they
