# Dramatic Council To Undergo Revision
## Heads Favor University Financial Control 
### Phil Bernheim 
Preparing for the long-expected |
reorganization of Dramatic Council, j
big-shots in campus dramatic cir
cles will meet this week to formu
late a new plan for the control of '
Stanford theatrical affairs.
Widespread was the feeling among '
dramatics men last night that the j
University should assume financial j
control of all, or almost all, dra
matic productions. Dramatics can
j never fulfill their proper function in
a university community if they must
cater to the box office, is the opin
i ion expressed b£ several.
Yet students should have some
J say in their own activity, they be
lieve. Some form of student-faculty
co-operation is the solution offered.
Joint Control Suggested
George Lindahl, dramatic man
ager, suggests a revised council of
six members, including a faculty
member, the director of dramatics,
the technical director, the dramatics
| manager, the student manager, and
a member-at-large selected by the
council.
This council would together
choose all productions. All, includ
ing the two annual musicals, would
be financed by the University and
produced by the University's direc
tor. Lindahl advocates paying the
writers of accepted scripts and tunes
for musicals, just as used to be done
in the case of the junior operas.
Lindahl suggested retention of the
student oflice of dramatics manager
! to handle business details. He would
be paid on the basis of each produc
tion, as at present.
Profits Minor Worry
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett, head of
I the public speaking department,
suggests the possibility of alumni, as
j well as student and faculty, repre
sentation on the new council. Dr.
Bassett also favors financial backing
I by the University, if feasible.
"Profits ai'e a minor consideration
; in a well-balanced dramatic pro
gram for a university," Dr. Bassett
; said last night. "We should be freed
from bowing to the box office in
I choosing a play."
In contrast to Lindahl's conception
of a central authority, Dr. Bassett
would not bar purely student groups
from presenting shows if they wish
ed. Regular quarterly productions
would be chosen by the director,
| with the advice of the council, but
student dramatic organizations
would be allowed their own produc
tions if they could finance them,
under Dr. Bassett's ideal conception,
(iros Criticizes System
Student Manager Bolj Gros said,
"Student-faculty co-operation is
essential. As for a detailed system,
I don't know enough about the mat
ter to suggest one without further
study of the situation. There is no
doubt, however, that the biggest
present handicap to Stanford dra
matics is the requirement that the
student Dramatics Council must pay
part of the director's salary. I know
1 of no other university where such
| an arrangement is in effect."
In the conference to be held this
week, some sort of synthesis of the
individual ideas which wore ex
pressed to the Daily last night will
| be sought. From this meeting may
come a workable plan to take full
, advantage of the New Theater facili
ties next fall.

six members, including a faculty
member, the director of dramatics,
the technical director, the dramatics
| manager, the student manager, and
a member-at-large selected by the
council.
This council would together
choose all productions. All, includ
ing the two annual musicals, would
be financed by the University and
produced by the University's direc
tor. Lindahl advocates paying the
writers of accepted scripts and tunes
for musicals, just as used to be done
in the case of the junior operas.
Lindahl suggested retention of the
student oflice of dramatics manager
! to handle business details. He would
be paid on the basis of each produc
tion, as at present.
Profits Minor Worry
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett, head of
I the public speaking department,
suggests the possibility of alumni, as
j well as student and faculty, repre
sentation on the new council. Dr.
Bassett also favors financial backing
I by the University, if feasible.
"Profits ai'e a minor consideration
; in a well-balanced dramatic pro
gram for a university," Dr. Bassett
; said last night. "We should be freed
from bowing to the box office in
I choosing a play."
In contrast to Lindahl's conception
of a central authority, Dr. Bassett
would not bar purely student groups
from presenting shows if they wish
ed. Regular quarterly productions
would be chosen by the director,
| with the advice of the council, but
student dramatic organizations
would be allowed their own produc
tions if they could finance them,
under Dr. Bassett's ideal conception,
(iros Criticizes System
Student Manager Bolj Gros said,
"Student-faculty co-operation is
essential. As for a detailed system,
I don't know enough about the mat
ter to suggest one without further
study of the situation. There is no
doubt, however, that the biggest
present handicap to Stanford dra
matics is the requirement that the
student Dramatics Council must pay
part of the director's salary. I know
1 of no other university where such
| an arrangement is in effect."
In the conference to be held this
week, some sort of synthesis of the
individual ideas which wore ex
pressed to the Daily last night will
| be sought. From this meeting may
come a workable plan to take full
, advantage of the New Theater facili
ties next fall.

University should assume financial j
control of all, or almost all, dra
matic productions. Dramatics can
j never fulfill their proper function in
a university community if they must

i ion expressed b£ several.
