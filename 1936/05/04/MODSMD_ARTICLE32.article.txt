## SLAVES AND FREEMEN 
### Gray Creveling 
â–  Republican voters tomorrow face
two alternatives, neither of which
are as clear to them as they should
be. GOPartisans may either vote
for the Landon delegation or for the
Warren "uninstructed" delegation.
Landon has refused to place his
name formally in the primary of any
state. He says that he prefers the
delegates from all states to come to
the convention unpledged to any one
man; and if these freemen see fit to
nominate him as the Republican
presidential candidate, all well and
good. Thus Landon indirectly en
dorses the Warren group from Cali
fornia.
Hearst, who has taken the gentle
man from Kansas under his condor
like wing, decided that Landon
.should have a delegation definitely
pledged to him. He was suspicious
of the Warren outfit because he had
nothing to do with its formation,
and, consequently, no influence over
it.
So, through his L.A. Examiner,
he polled the 44 members of the
Warren delegation and the 21 mem
bers of its steering committee, and
found them largely favoring Hoover
over Landon (47 to 17) in answer to
the question: "Who is your favorite
choice for presidential candidate?"
(Now, this story has been told be
fore, but today it has two versions.
Time gives the above version and
insists that its source of this poll
story is "highly reliable" and TIME
is also "still maintaining that the
Examiner's poll took place." How
ever, members of the Warren dele
gation itself deny the story's validity,
deny that the poll ever took place,
and insist that it was a Hearst
scheme to cloud the issues and gain
support of Hoover - haters. But
enough for this controversy, for
there is evidence backing both ver
sions, also evidence proving both are
liars.)
With the results of the alleged poll
in his hand, Hearst's suspicions were
thus confirmed, and he set out to
make a deal with Merriam and form
a group of slaves on which he could
rely to vote for Landon, or do any
thing else he commanded.
Then the ballyhoo began, and
Californians find the Hearst papers
clarioning the Landon delegation as
the only group pledged to the
Kansan (which is very true), and the
Chronicle and other independently
operated Republican papers bleating
for the Warren crowd as a "free"
group uninfluenced by "the great
publisher" (which also is very true).
You Republicans have your choice
of voting for a group controlled by
Hearst, and which is 100 per cent for
Landon only as long as W.R.H. in
sists on such loyalty; or voting for
an "uninstructed" delegation con
trolled by no one (so they aver, but
'IIME avers that it is controlled by
Hoover.)
I predict dire things for Warren's
gang but it is reasonable to suppose
that they will vote for Landon. They
at least are freemen and therefore
constitute the lesser of the two evils
yoked slaves and free amateurs.
Ju.st remember to trust Hearst as
far as you can spit and anyone else
as far as a man can get in Roble.
I wonder if Hearst realizes that
Stanford's own poli sci professor,
h. A. Cottrell, is on the Landon
list.
