# THREE CORNERED DEMOCRATS
## 
### 
President Roosevelt has bis own
hand-picked delegation headed by
his old trusty, McAdoo. "Madman"
McGroarty is heading a group of
I ownsendites, although he has been
disowned and repudiated by the
good doc tor. Thirdly, there is the
Upton Sinclair EPIC slate.
World's easiest job: name the
winner of the above three cornered
fight.
