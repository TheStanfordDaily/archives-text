### 
When Wally Brooke makes a pro
posal to the Board of Athletic Con
trol Wednesday night that the intra
mural sports appropriation be in
creased from $500 to $750, Intra
mural Manager GifF Myers will pre
sent a $750 budget, which he has
drawn up with Marvie Kahn, grad
uate member of the B.A.C.
The budget includes all intramural
1 expenses on the basis of the in
creased appropriation. The extra
$250 would be used to complete the
i award system and to provide ade
quate equipment for all sports.
Myers plans what he calls a "ro-
I tating system of equipment." By
this system the intramural commit
i tee would buy equipment each year
that would be kept for the succeed
: ing year; so that a great amount of
new equipment would not have to
j be purchased each year.
Volleyball, which according to
! Harry Wolter might be added to the
l intramural program, was not con
sidered in the budget because it is
believed that the decision about ad
ditional sports should lie with next
i year's intramural manager.
