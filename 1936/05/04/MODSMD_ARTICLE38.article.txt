# Row Sophs Explain Need For "Machine"
## Halls Plan To Retaliate In Caucus Wednesday 
### 
By Solon O. Swampum
More about the soph machineâ€”
"Machine," say the sophs, is a
nasty word, but worse on your own
campus. A better word would be
"organization."
"Machine" implies steam-roller
ing tactics. The situation is not this
at all, however. The soph organiza
tion formed, it says, solely because
the situation seemed to call for it.
Upperclassmen were holding cau
cuses, inviting picked delegates, and
sending about printed circulars with
"Vote for these Row candidates,"
scrawled across the top. By the time
student body president and vice
president had been chosen, the
group lost interest, and the soph
candidates were chosen haphazardly.
What the sophs wanted was a
caucus on the up-and-up, with
fairly chosen delegates. Rushing
split up the Row enough, figured
the organizers, without having di
vided - within - themselves factions I
during elections.
The hall was more naturally an
integrated faction, they decided, I
with Toro leading the way and no
rushing preventing united support.
So they announced a caucus, warned
each house to select a delegate, and
met.
First results were sensationally
successful. Jackie Brown and Hank
Luisetti walked away with the elec
tion. But, since ihe rest of the cam
pus had not been forewarned,
charges of "fixing" and "railroad
ing" began being hurled.
As to ringleaders, Dick Riddcll,
Guy Neely, and Jack Huddleston
seem to be the major ones. "And
we're only doing the job of organ
izing that should have been done
for the entire student body years
ago," they claim. "With this present
system, a Hall-Row split in inev- j

it able*. And with a split, the Row
should try to put up the best man
possible and get behind him."
So much for the Row sophomores'
viewpoint.
The halls, in retaliation, have an
nounced a caucus to be held in
Lagunita Court Wednesday night.
A temporary chairman has been
chosen, but "doesn't want his name
mixed up in it."
Why? What, ponder the Row

[ sophs, is this chairman afraid of
j having "his name mixed up in"?
The Hall sophomores have added,
j "Any sophomore is welcome." An
interesting quirk would occur if the
| Row sophs stampeded the meeting
t and made the Hall caucus nominate
Killefer too.
Rumor has it that if Burrows had
won the Row backing, the Halls
! would not have put up a candidate
against him. Burrows, it seems, has
I Hall as well as Row support.
