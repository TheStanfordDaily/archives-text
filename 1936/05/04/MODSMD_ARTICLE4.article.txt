## Former Premier, Finance Minister Re-elected 
### 
PARIS, May 3 (&).â€”Early returns j
in France's runoff election of the j
Chamber of Deputies today showed
a marked tendency toward the left.
The first 25 returns gave the
Leftist "people's front" 19 seats, of
which four were for Communists.
Former Premier Edouard Herriot, j
who was forced into the runoff last j
Sunday when he trailed an oppo
nent, was re-elected, as was Paul j
Reynaud, former minister of finance
and a leading advocate of devalua
tion.
Little Disorder
The only disorder reported late j
today was at Menton, where one
was wounded in a pistol fight over J
charges of ballot frauds.
Ballots were cast to fill 433 seats
in a runoff election where candi
dates failed to obtain majorities last
Sunday, when 185 seats were filled.
Only a plurality was necessary for
election today.
People's Front Strong
The "people's front," particularly i
Communists, showed such strength !
a week ago that it was expected to ;
win more than half the seat:?. The
first ballot gave it 54 seats and op
ponents, including eight antifront
radical Socialists, gained the re
mainder.
