# P.C.C. Protests 'Theft' of Player
## Big League Ball Favored By St. Mary's Star 
### 
A double-barreled protest against
the signing of Francis Kelleher, St.
Mary's baseball star and Olympic
Games prospect, by the New York
Yankees will be sent to Kenesaw
Mountain Landis, high corhmission
er of baseball, by members of the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Conference, according to word re
ceived from Harry Wolter, Indian
ball mentor and president of the
conference.
The first and official protest to be
signed by Wolter in behalf of the
Coast colleges will be followed by a
similar protest by Ed "Slip" Madi
gan, Gael coach.
The situation is complicated by
the fact that Kelleher, previous to
accepting the Yankee contract, had
agreed to accompany the Olympic
team, headed by Wolter, to Berlin
and expenses for his trip have al
ready been raised. The first indica
tion that Wolter had of Kelleher's
signing came about Wednesday,
when Wolter sent a request to St.
Mary's for the check to cover Kel
leher's expenses.
