CARDS-O.C. NOT
HOPELESS CASE

Here on the desk are figures hast- (
ily scribbled representing a dope j
sheet on (he Stanford-Olympic Club
meet on the docket for next Satur
day here on the Farm.
The score at the bottom says i
Club 71, Us 60. Which is a bit of
all right for the local cause, be
cause anyone knows when a dope
sheet is that close anything can
happen, and the final score is never |
just that.
It all depends on how many of the
transient Clubmen will show up in |
racing gear Saturday. If Wykofl,
Marty, Reel, Upton, Kirkpatrick, !
Waterbury, Mauger and others ap
pear on the scene it will be towels '
for the Cards. But if some of these i
fellows are detaied at their jobs on j
that afternoon, why Dink Templeton
may not be wrong in picking his
boys to win.
Also some of the favored Club
men may be surprised by their
respective Stanford foes. After 1
all, Stanford has the No. 2 college
track team in the U.S.A. and has
some pretty fair representatives
of the underwear sport to pit I
against the S.F. tong.

NIMMO OVER
BRIGHT IN MILE

For instance, who knows thai
Norm Bright is a cinch against our
Chuck Nirnmo in the mile. Chuck
could run 4.15 if Norm led him out. !
And Norm, like the rest of his team- |
mates, may not be in the best of
shape.
Or in the hurdles, which is the :
weak Club department, Captain :
Sammy Klopstoek deserves two
firsts, but who says Hunt Kings
bury can't beat Johnny Wood in
both? It's not too long a bet.
Or couldn't A1 BJaekman, '35
Card captain running for the "O,"
be nosed out by Jack Weiershauser, j
A1 Cranston, or the amazing GifT
Myers? From the radio report of
the S.C.-Club meet down south
Blackman seemed to display nothing
but a wobbly finish.
Or isn't Humbert Smith the
man to give Walter Maryt a battle
way above two fathoms in the high
jump? Smith is a great psycho
logical worrier for weeks before
big meets but if lie reads up on a
litSle Nietzsche super mam stuff
or a bit of "Outwitting our
Nerves" he might forget all about
his sore leg and trim the great
Walter. It's all in the mind here.
For the rest we'll give Ben East
man the 880, Bob Clark the broad
jump, Gordy Dunn the discus, I
Johnny Mottram and Ed Water
bury the javelin, Garret and Mauger
the pole vault for the Club, and Ray
Dean and Jim Kneubuhl the sprints,
Jim Reynolds the shot, Ed Burrows i

the two-mile for Stanford and call
the relay a very interesting race, but
favor the Club because they have
Eastman and Blackman to hold up
Walts and Upton and come from be
hind to win by a yard or two.
FROM THE WEEKEND: Foy
Draper running the 220 in 20.9,
probably the most startling result
of the S.C.-O.C. meet. . . .more so
than the pole vault results, with
Meadows over 14.4, Day and Sefton
at 14 feet, and Hooker at 13.9—p00r
old Fimple, the other Trojan vaulter,
in fifth place at 13.6 . . . Cece Cole
of San Mateo running the mile in
4.27 and the half in 1.59 at the J.C,
Conference meet . . . Hank Luisetti
ringing the bell at the barn dance
riot with seven out of eight free
shots, in more of a frenzied melee
than the second S.C. game . . .
Sparky Robertson with six and Bob
Zonne a wobbly third with four . . .
Indian Broom doing right well in
the Derby, paying $3.85 to show and
showing that he'll be a challenge to
the East for some years to come.

CARDS-O.C. NOT
HOPELESS CASE

Here on the desk are figures hast- (
ily scribbled representing a dope j
sheet on (he Stanford-Olympic Club
meet on the docket for next Satur
day here on the Farm.
The score at the bottom says i
Club 71, Us 60. Which is a bit of
all right for the local cause, be
cause anyone knows when a dope
sheet is that close anything can
happen, and the final score is never |
just that.
It all depends on how many of the
transient Clubmen will show up in |
racing gear Saturday. If Wykofl,
Marty, Reel, Upton, Kirkpatrick, !
Waterbury, Mauger and others ap
pear on the scene it will be towels '
for the Cards. But if some of these i
fellows are detaied at their jobs on j
that afternoon, why Dink Templeton
may not be wrong in picking his
boys to win.
Also some of the favored Club
men may be surprised by their
respective Stanford foes. After 1
all, Stanford has the No. 2 college
track team in the U.S.A. and has
some pretty fair representatives
of the underwear sport to pit I
against the S.F. tong.

NIMMO OVER
BRIGHT IN MILE

For instance, who knows thai
Norm Bright is a cinch against our
Chuck Nirnmo in the mile. Chuck
could run 4.15 if Norm led him out. !
And Norm, like the rest of his team- |
mates, may not be in the best of
shape.
Or in the hurdles, which is the :
weak Club department, Captain :
Sammy Klopstoek deserves two
firsts, but who says Hunt Kings
bury can't beat Johnny Wood in
both? It's not too long a bet.
Or couldn't A1 BJaekman, '35
Card captain running for the "O,"
be nosed out by Jack Weiershauser, j
A1 Cranston, or the amazing GifT
Myers? From the radio report of
the S.C.-Club meet down south
Blackman seemed to display nothing
but a wobbly finish.
Or isn't Humbert Smith the
man to give Walter Maryt a battle
way above two fathoms in the high
jump? Smith is a great psycho
logical worrier for weeks before
big meets but if lie reads up on a
litSle Nietzsche super mam stuff
or a bit of "Outwitting our
Nerves" he might forget all about
his sore leg and trim the great
Walter. It's all in the mind here.

NIMMO OVER
BRIGHT IN MILE

For instance, who knows thai
Norm Bright is a cinch against our
Chuck Nirnmo in the mile. Chuck
could run 4.15 if Norm led him out. !
And Norm, like the rest of his team- |
mates, may not be in the best of
shape.
Or in the hurdles, which is the :
weak Club department, Captain :
Sammy Klopstoek deserves two
firsts, but who says Hunt Kings
bury can't beat Johnny Wood in
both? It's not too long a bet.
Or couldn't A1 BJaekman, '35
Card captain running for the "O,"
be nosed out by Jack Weiershauser, j
A1 Cranston, or the amazing GifT
Myers? From the radio report of
the S.C.-Club meet down south
Blackman seemed to display nothing
but a wobbly finish.
Or isn't Humbert Smith the
man to give Walter Maryt a battle
way above two fathoms in the high
jump? Smith is a great psycho
logical worrier for weeks before
big meets but if lie reads up on a
litSle Nietzsche super mam stuff
or a bit of "Outwitting our
Nerves" he might forget all about
his sore leg and trim the great
Walter. It's all in the mind here.
For the rest we'll give Ben East
man the 880, Bob Clark the broad
jump, Gordy Dunn the discus, I
Johnny Mottram and Ed Water
bury the javelin, Garret and Mauger
the pole vault for the Club, and Ray
Dean and Jim Kneubuhl the sprints,
Jim Reynolds the shot, Ed Burrows i

the two-mile for Stanford and call
the relay a very interesting race, but
favor the Club because they have
Eastman and Blackman to hold up
Walts and Upton and come from be
hind to win by a yard or two.
FROM THE WEEKEND: Foy
Draper running the 220 in 20.9,
probably the most startling result
of the S.C.-O.C. meet. . . .more so
than the pole vault results, with
Meadows over 14.4, Day and Sefton
at 14 feet, and Hooker at 13.9—p00r
old Fimple, the other Trojan vaulter,
in fifth place at 13.6 . . . Cece Cole
of San Mateo running the mile in
4.27 and the half in 1.59 at the J.C,
Conference meet . . . Hank Luisetti
ringing the bell at the barn dance
riot with seven out of eight free
shots, in more of a frenzied melee
than the second S.C. game . . .
Sparky Robertson with six and Bob
Zonne a wobbly third with four . . .
Indian Broom doing right well in
the Derby, paying $3.85 to show and
showing that he'll be a challenge to
the East for some years to come.
