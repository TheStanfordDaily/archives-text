# O.C. Loss To Troy Trackmen Spurs Indians
## Dope Gives Cards Chance In Saturday Meet; Club To Add New Strength 
### 
After a look at what U.S.C. did to
Charley Hunter's Olympic Club
track team last Saturday in Los
Angeles, the optimist forces of Stan
ford's track followers are already
pulling for a Cardinal victory in the
dual mfeet with the Club on An
gell Field next Saturday.
Troy defeated Stanford but three
points worse than the 83-47 score
rung up on the Club, and with the
i|ew finds and mid-season Big Meet
form on deck, an exceptionally close
met't can be predicted.
Eastman's 1:54 880, Bright's 4:15)
mile, Dunn's 1(55 discus throw, Mot
tram's 207 in the javelin, Clark's
24-11 broadjump, and Marty's 0-0
in the high jump will be among the
marks for Stanford to contemplate.
In addition, the Winged-O ranks
will be refilled by Frank WykofT,
Ned Lyon, and a number of other
U.S.C. former greats whom Dean
Cromwell for some reason had
barred from the U.S.C. meet.
