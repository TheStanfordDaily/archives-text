# Dopester Hits Two of Three Turf Winners
## 
### R. B. Jones 
Indian Broom came in third in the
greatest Kentucky turf classic up
to-date and saved your dopestcr's
reputation as well as the pocket
books of many loyal California rac
ing fans.
The Churchill Downs derby has
made another page in track history,
and there are always those who say,
"I bet I'll pick the winner next
year," or the familiar "I told you
! so."
Last Friday in a consensus in the
I Daily the choices were Indian Broom,
| best across the board bet, and so it
I was until two minutes before 14 of
i the best racing horses in the country
j shot out of their stalls, when the
odds went from 15-1 to 9-5. Brevity
I for second came true, even though
j it is suggested by many that the
l favorite got a raw deal. Two of our
| three choices to come in galloped
I home among the first three.
Bold Venture was the dark horse
I just like last year's Omaha. Teufel
1 was disappointing, granted, but what
could Granville do without a ridel - ?
