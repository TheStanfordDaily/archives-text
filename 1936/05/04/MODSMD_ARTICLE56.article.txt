# Cathcart To Talk On Stanford Radio Hour
## 
### 
"Congress and the Supreme
Court" will be the topic to be dis
cussed by Professor A. M. Cathcart
of the Stanford School of Law, when
he addresses the Stanford Univer
sity Hour radio audience tonight at
7:15 o'clock on station KGO and the
NBC "blue network."
Professor Cr.thcart will consider
such questions as: From where does
the United States Supreme Court
derive its power to pass upon con
stitutionality of the acts of Con
gress? Should this power be abol
ished or curtailed? To what extent,
if at all, could Congress itself, with
out a constitutional amendment, pre
vent the court from passing on the
constitutionality of its acts?
