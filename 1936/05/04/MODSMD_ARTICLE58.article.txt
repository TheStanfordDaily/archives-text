## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" A 						Collegiate or Dignified Graduation? The Senior Class Will Decide Tonight 
### 
Whether the process of being solemnly and
honorably conducted out of the University mer
its an atmosphere remindful of Big Game hys
teria or of the quiet and dignity which ever
prevails in the Chapel is the question which
heads of the senior class will decide tonight.
The President and the Public Exercises Com
mittee, which has charge of Commencement
exercises, have already decided. The Chapel
is their choice. Now it remains for the seniors
to express their opinion.
Last Commencement Day some 600 seniors
walked across the scene of the previous fall's
gridiron triumphs, marching to the tune of two
phonograph records. It took so long to cover
the distance from the straight-away to the
speakers' stand that one of the records had to
be played four times, and the monotony had
a visible effect on the assembled throng.
And a throng there was. That was why the
exercises were held in the stadium—to give all
relatives a chance to applaud when "their"
lohnny or Mary stepped up to be graduated,
and, incidentally, to hear Mr. Hoover speak
of G.O.P. policies. Last year the advantage of
having enough seats for the spectators was
considered great enough to offset the bright

sunlight, the phonograph records, and the "get
your-official-line-ups-program-right-here" atmos
phere.
But once in the stadium apparently was
enough. Several well - founded and concrete
talking points have been drummed up by those
favoring the Chapel.
True, if Commencement is held on the Quad,
each graduating student will be allowed to have
only two or three tickets for his relatives or
friends. But two years ago when that system
I v/as followed, 132 seats were unoccupied. And
of course there is a financial argument. If the
stadium is used, it would cost approximately
$500 to have the grass cut, the seats washed, the
I score-boards covered, and a background of
foliage constructed.
The Farm has no ideal place to hold its
Commencement exercises. But it will have by
the time the class of '37 is ready to pass on. For
■ in a year the new amphitheater — spacious,
equipped with public address system, and not
possessing the sporting design of a football
stadium—probably will be finished.
In the meantime seniors can hardly hesitate
in agreeing with the Administration that the
Chapel presents the best environment for the
, graduation exercises.

favoring the Chapel.
True, if Commencement is held on the Quad,
each graduating student will be allowed to have
only two or three tickets for his relatives or
friends. But two years ago when that system
I v/as followed, 132 seats were unoccupied. And
of course there is a financial argument. If the
stadium is used, it would cost approximately
$500 to have the grass cut, the seats washed, the
I score-boards covered, and a background of
foliage constructed.
The Farm has no ideal place to hold its
Commencement exercises. But it will have by
the time the class of '37 is ready to pass on. For
■ in a year the new amphitheater — spacious,
equipped with public address system, and not
possessing the sporting design of a football
stadium—probably will be finished.
In the meantime seniors can hardly hesitate
in agreeing with the Administration that the
Chapel presents the best environment for the
, graduation exercises.
Whether the process of being solemnly and
honorably conducted out of the University mer
its an atmosphere remindful of Big Game hys
teria or of the quiet and dignity which ever
prevails in the Chapel is the question which
heads of the senior class will decide tonight.
The President and the Public Exercises Com
mittee, which has charge of Commencement
exercises, have already decided. The Chapel
is their choice. Now it remains for the seniors
to express their opinion.
Last Commencement Day some 600 seniors
walked across the scene of the previous fall's
gridiron triumphs, marching to the tune of two
phonograph records. It took so long to cover
the distance from the straight-away to the
speakers' stand that one of the records had to
be played four times, and the monotony had
a visible effect on the assembled throng.
And a throng there was. That was why the
exercises were held in the stadium—to give all
relatives a chance to applaud when "their"
lohnny or Mary stepped up to be graduated,
and, incidentally, to hear Mr. Hoover speak
of G.O.P. policies. Last year the advantage of
having enough seats for the spectators was
considered great enough to offset the bright

sunlight, the phonograph records, and the "get
your-official-line-ups-program-right-here" atmos
phere.
But once in the stadium apparently was
enough. Several well - founded and concrete
talking points have been drummed up by those
favoring the Chapel.
