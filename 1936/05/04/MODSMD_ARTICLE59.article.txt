## 
### 
After several weeks of dickering and ship
ping of unsigned contracts back and forth, jun
ior committeemen yesterday proudly revealed
that Jimmy Dorsey and his 13-piece band are
definitely booked for. showing at Stanford's
annual Junior Prom on May 22. The stampede
for bids and dates officially starts today, the
committee reports.
Despite Bob Gros's arguments to the effect
that the dance, with Dorsey, was a cinch to see
red financially, Ex Committee had previously
authorized negotiations to import the well
known swing band.
The dance still may not do well in a pecuniary
way; even the junior moguls in charge concede
they will be lucky to break even.
However, when Stanford schedules a "big
name" for appearance on the Farm—whether
it be to entertain at a dance or to lecture in the
Assembly Hall—it is enough of a novelty to
lure the average student.
