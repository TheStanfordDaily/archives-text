# Stanford Not Alone in Its Stand on Honor Principles
## 
### 
In last month's Honor Code poll, three-fourths
of those voting said they would not co-operate
to the fextent of reporting violations. But that
group was not making an expression peculiar
to this locality or to the Stanford Honor Code
situation. Exactly the same thing happened at
the University of North Carolina last week.
A referendum vote was taken at the Southern
university and although 85 per cent of those
voting wanted an honor system, only one-fourth
said they would report violators.

Forty-six per cent of the answerers, doubtful
as many Eastern students are of students' abil
ity to govern themselves, advocated passing
the buck with a joint faculty-student council to
administer the Honor System.
The results of both the North Carolina and
Stanford polls indicate one thing clearly: most
students will not sgueal on their fellows.
If any Honor Code is to be enforced com
pletely and effectively, some other method of
detecting violators apparently must be found.
