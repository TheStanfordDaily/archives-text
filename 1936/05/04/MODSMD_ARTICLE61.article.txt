# Peace Movements Not Such a Failure
## 
### 
Professor Merle E. Curti of Smith College,
who spoke on peace movements here last
week, made one particularly significant state
ment which students might analyze and remem
ber.
Because there have been drives for peace
before every war, he said, peace drives as a
whole are said to be failures. But who can say
that wars have not been prevented by con
certed efforts to avoid them? A move for peace
can be called a failure when a war occurs. But
one can seldom tell what forces maintain peace
in times of crises.
Advocates of anti-war movements can find
their most potent argument in this viewpoint.
