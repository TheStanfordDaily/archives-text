(From tlu' San Francisco Chronicle)
We all know that industrial relations afi'ecf inti
mately the lives of all of us. We know theoretically
that in an industrial age the relations of employer,
employe and the public are vital to our way of life and
our age. We move and have our being through indus
trial relations. When there is a break in those rela
tions, as San Francisco knows, the mechanism of our
living rattles badly.
But what are industrial relations and how best can
they be maintained for the general welfare and with
justice to all?
Stanford University is going to find out. Stanford
is to have a laboratory devoted to industrial relations.
1 lie subject is to be studied under a case system,
similar to modern law courses and analogous to that
used in the physical sciences.
In authorizing this new division, Stanford is pio
neering in the West. Hie University is to render an
important public service in making available the best
that has been thought, written, and done on a present
day problem that is still in the process of adjustment—
and probably always will be. The University is to be
congratulated on the fact that it is not afraid of a
controversial subject. It is just because this subject
• is controversial that the University can be of the great
est public service.
The Stanford Division of Industrial Relations, in the
Postgraduate School of Business, will co-ordinate all
this body of information and experience—and go on
fiom there. This body of organized fact and expe
rience will be available to both labor, industry, and
the public on the Pacific Coast. It should prove of
inestimable service. It will meet the first rule of in
telligent consideration of a subject— get the facts, not
only the immediate facts, but the background facts.
For director of this division the Stanford trustees
have selected Paul Eliel of San Francisco. A former
Stanford student, Mr. Eliel was graduated from the
University of Chicago in 1913 and continued his eco
nomic and political science studies in England and
Germany. His life work has been along the lines of
his special preparation. He is a recognized expert on
the subject, with the respect and confidence of labor
and industrial leaders.
Stanford's new Division of Industrial Relations will
supply a need too long neglected. It starts under happy
auspices. We wish it the success and service that we
are confident it will achieve.

We all know that industrial relations afi'ecf inti
mately the lives of all of us. We know theoretically
that in an industrial age the relations of employer,
employe and the public are vital to our way of life and
our age. We move and have our being through indus
trial relations. When there is a break in those rela
tions, as San Francisco knows, the mechanism of our
living rattles badly.
But what are industrial relations and how best can
they be maintained for the general welfare and with
justice to all?
Stanford University is going to find out. Stanford
is to have a laboratory devoted to industrial relations.
1 lie subject is to be studied under a case system,
similar to modern law courses and analogous to that
used in the physical sciences.
In authorizing this new division, Stanford is pio
neering in the West. Hie University is to render an
important public service in making available the best
that has been thought, written, and done on a present
day problem that is still in the process of adjustment—
and probably always will be. The University is to be
congratulated on the fact that it is not afraid of a
controversial subject. It is just because this subject
• is controversial that the University can be of the great
est public service.
The Stanford Division of Industrial Relations, in the
Postgraduate School of Business, will co-ordinate all
this body of information and experience—and go on
fiom there. This body of organized fact and expe
rience will be available to both labor, industry, and
the public on the Pacific Coast. It should prove of
inestimable service. It will meet the first rule of in
telligent consideration of a subject— get the facts, not
only the immediate facts, but the background facts.
For director of this division the Stanford trustees
have selected Paul Eliel of San Francisco. A former
Stanford student, Mr. Eliel was graduated from the
University of Chicago in 1913 and continued his eco
nomic and political science studies in England and
Germany. His life work has been along the lines of
his special preparation. He is a recognized expert on
the subject, with the respect and confidence of labor
and industrial leaders.
Stanford's new Division of Industrial Relations will
supply a need too long neglected. It starts under happy
auspices. We wish it the success and service that we
are confident it will achieve.
