Love is in the air.
That must be what I keep bumping my head on.
It is said that many of the local youths went to
the City Saturday for the benefit of the Convalescent
Home. It cost three bucks to get in and six bucks to
get out. If the cost in human lives were added up,
they would have to mortgage the Home along with
Ciib Holloway. It was a barn dance, and by 2:00 in
the morning, the barn really started dancing. ,
The Sigma Nus held their rather famous kid party
Friday night. Two Sigma Nu's were seen at the
party. Ihey were there just out of curiosity. The rest
of them, 1 guess, were just kidding.
Delta Chi Brother Jack Temple is plenty proud of
sister Shirley, it seems. "If I weren't her brother, I'd
marry her myself when I grow up," he is reported to
have said.
This is not entirely funny, but if Our Hasher really
thought up something funny, particularly for Monday
morning's paper, it would be funny all right.
