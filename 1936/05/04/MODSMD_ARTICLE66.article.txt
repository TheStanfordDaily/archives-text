Stanford has an honest woman.
She signs herself "eleven-hun
dredite" to a Vox Campi on husbands
printed today that hits the Farm's
hypocritical maidens as well as the
proverbial nail right on the head.

Of course, her
demands that a
husband have
dough aplenty,
drive a LaSalle,
be athletic, and
belong to the right
tong are puVe
satire. Oh My
Yes! She wrote
only to poke in— j
nocent fun at fe
males who dished
out emotional

| sweetness and
light on the subject of men and mar-
I riage in Friday's Daily. Oh, defi
j nitely!
And the fact that her letter tells
| just about the whole truth of "what
| every woman knows and is here to
j do something about" wasn't the in
tention at all. Goodness No!
* $ Hi
"Eleven - hundredite's" brazen
emphasis on such filthy things as
money and position is just funny fic
tion. Sure!
But to us guys with the "sense of
humor" (prime husbapdly charm
according to Friday's altruistic lad
ies) and without the La Salle and
the 9.8 score in the 100, her state
| mentis a grisly truth.
Do Stanford women go out with
us? Sure, they do! But do they go
out with us if that tremendous
yachtsman hints that he might give
them a twirl? We leave it to your

! honest judgment.
We don't mean to say that our
! charms are honored in the breach,
j But we do mean to say that the
I charms of the be-muscled and the
be-moneyed are certainly honored
in the observance—which, if it could
be, would be all the time.
* • *
Taking one step more: If a guy
with a "sense of humor" pops the
question between chortles — that's
! very flattering indeed. But it's con
. siderably better if moaned softly by
j a guy who may roar while reading
i Hooey, but who can and does order
1 champagne at the better places.
Using the term "sense of humor"
as including some of the nobler but*
j less expensive male attributes —
which do the gals really like best —
> the man who sells himself, or the
! man who can buy the gals?
There would be no argument if
women could be absolutely honest
i about it. But they can't be, getting
; places socially being the knock
: down-drag-out business it is. In
} stead, they must corrugate their
j faces with smiles and sound off in a
mutually approved manner on the
subject of male virtues.
Like DuPont pleading. "All I
want is peace," Stanford women
must say, "All I want is affection."
Now gals who can think one thing
and say another aren't new to this
old world, nor to the male for whose
benefit they speak.
But v/hen they are so perfect at
oral deception, they shouldn't waste
their ability on mere college men.
The Republicans would probably
pay them well this year.

Stanford has an honest woman.
She signs herself "eleven-hun
dredite" to a Vox Campi on husbands
printed today that hits the Farm's
hypocritical maidens as well as the
proverbial nail right on the head.

Of course, her
demands that a
husband have
dough aplenty,
drive a LaSalle,
be athletic, and
belong to the right
tong are puVe
satire. Oh My
Yes! She wrote
only to poke in— j
nocent fun at fe
males who dished
out emotional

| sweetness and
light on the subject of men and mar-
I riage in Friday's Daily. Oh, defi
j nitely!
And the fact that her letter tells
| just about the whole truth of "what
| every woman knows and is here to
j do something about" wasn't the in
tention at all. Goodness No!
* $ Hi
"Eleven - hundredite's" brazen
emphasis on such filthy things as
money and position is just funny fic
tion. Sure!
But to us guys with the "sense of
humor" (prime husbapdly charm
according to Friday's altruistic lad
ies) and without the La Salle and
the 9.8 score in the 100, her state
| mentis a grisly truth.
Do Stanford women go out with
us? Sure, they do! But do they go
out with us if that tremendous
yachtsman hints that he might give
them a twirl? We leave it to your

! honest judgment.
We don't mean to say that our
! charms are honored in the breach,
j But we do mean to say that the
I charms of the be-muscled and the
be-moneyed are certainly honored
in the observance—which, if it could
be, would be all the time.
* • *
Taking one step more: If a guy
with a "sense of humor" pops the
question between chortles — that's
! very flattering indeed. But it's con
. siderably better if moaned softly by
j a guy who may roar while reading
i Hooey, but who can and does order
1 champagne at the better places.
Using the term "sense of humor"
as including some of the nobler but*
j less expensive male attributes —
which do the gals really like best —
> the man who sells himself, or the
! man who can buy the gals?
There would be no argument if
women could be absolutely honest
i about it. But they can't be, getting
; places socially being the knock
: down-drag-out business it is. In
} stead, they must corrugate their
j faces with smiles and sound off in a
mutually approved manner on the
subject of male virtues.
Like DuPont pleading. "All I
want is peace," Stanford women
must say, "All I want is affection."
Now gals who can think one thing
and say another aren't new to this
old world, nor to the male for whose
benefit they speak.
But v/hen they are so perfect at
oral deception, they shouldn't waste
their ability on mere college men.
The Republicans would probably
pay them well this year.
