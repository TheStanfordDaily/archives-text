# Baxter Gives Fine Portrayal Of "Murietta"
## 
### 
Warner Baxter is the reason
"Robin Hood of El Dorado" is a fine
picture. In addition, the casting is
good and the picture capably di
rected.
The tale concerns the bandit ex
ploits of Joaquir Murietta, early

California outlaw.
Murietta, played by
Baxter, is a simple
Mexican peon who
vows vengeance
against all Americans
when four gold min-

ers kill his wife. He falls in with
"Three Fingered Jack," notorious
killer, and becomes the leader of
Jack's band.
From one shot-punctuated scene
to the next this picture flies along.
The show is good throughout, but
Baxter turns in one of the finest per
formances of his brightly studded
career.
"Brides Are Like That," with Ross
Alexander, Joseph Cawthorn, and
Anita Louise, concerns the troubles
of a boy with no ambition but plenty

of applesauce. How he combines ap
plesauce and Anita Louise to find
happiness is the text. It is a spleen
splitter. —Keating
Leopold Stokowski and the Phila
delphia Orchestra played an inter
esting concert before a jammed au
ditorium in San Francisco Saturday
night. The program, ranging from
Brahms to Stravinsky, illustrated
the control and versatility of the
great conductor over his fine or
chestra.
The ninth century Japanese Eten
raku, played in Japan on an instru
ment which is the forerunner of the
pipe organ, Stokowski explained,
was weird and extra-harmonic.
