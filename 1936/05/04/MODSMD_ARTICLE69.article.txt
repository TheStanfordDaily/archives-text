# NOT 'LUCRATIVE,' BUT...
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have thought of a few pre
requisites for my ideal husband. He
doesn't need to be athletic, but a
nice big red sweater and a 9.8 hun
dred will help; also he must have a
good tan, belong to a good tong and
stand three axe handles high. Al
though I'm not lucrative he must
have a summer home, play polo, and
drive a LaSalle to his yacht. He
doesn't need to be smart, but he
should have taken good notes for me
in school and give me A comps. He
should know when to get Black
Label instead of Three Star so that
I won't be ill the next day.
Lovingly,
Eleven-hundredite
P.S.: Send me a gentleman.
