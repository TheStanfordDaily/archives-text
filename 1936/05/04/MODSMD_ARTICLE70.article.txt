# NOT SO APATHETIC

The Editor, Sir:
I have always felt that student in
terest is to a considerable extent a
1 unction of student government—
that the state of student interest
reflects the state of student govern
ment. Students will express their
interest and concern in student gov
ernment ONLY when they feel that

that expression will have meaning.
I do not believe that student govern
ment has ever offered that encour
agement to student opinion. Thus
we do not have a tangible body of
student opinion at Stanford. How
ever, I fail to agree with the de
cree of the incumbent Ex Commit
tee that the fault lies wholly with
the students.
I believe that there is a very real
student concern for the problems and
opportunities of student govern
ment. Students are anxious to erad
icate the sore spots of local politics—
and willing to make an effort to
do it.
