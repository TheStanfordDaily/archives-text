# Construction Steel Arrives For Theater
## Floods, Dock Strike Delay Delivery of Shipment 
### 
First shipment of the construction
steel for (lie new half million dollar
theater arrived from mills in Pitts
burgh yesterday. Delivery was de
layed by floods in Pennsylvania last
month which forced suspension of
activity in the smelting plants, and
by the dock strike in San Diego.
The steel is being transported by
boat through the Panama Canal.
Since the girders are cast roughly
in the original process, they must be
measured, trimmed, and finished at
a local plant before they can be as
sembled, according to John Leavers,
superintendent of construction.
Work of swinging the steel into place
is expected to start this week.
