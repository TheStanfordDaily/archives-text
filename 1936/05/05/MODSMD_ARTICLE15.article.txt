Once a back-.slapper, always a
back-slapper. The popular belief
that college politicians start their
careers at a tender age is vindicated
by the record of the Ex Committed '
members. Eitjht of the eleven Farm
legislators held major political of
fices while in high school.
Wally Brooke, A.S.S.U. president, ;
and Dick Creamer, graduate repre
sentative and commander of the
"Veterans," were presidents of their
high school student bodies.
Two former heads of secondary
school scholarship societies are in
cluded on the Ex Committee role:
Jean Anderson, senior woman, and
Hank Luisetti, sophomore man.
Jean was also student body secre
tary; Hank was president of his
class in his sophomore and senior j

years.
Chick F ranich, junior man, recalls
being student body treasurer and
business manager of the annual
while in high school. Betty Grover,
junior woman, was likewise a treas
sury bull flog. She guarded the
funds for her woman's athletic asso
ciation for two years and was presi
dent. of her senior class.
Jackie Flanders, A.S.S.U. vice
president, was senior class repre
sentative while in secondary school.
Three Ex Committee members,
however, stood out against the call
to public service during pre-college
days. Dinty Moore, representative
at large, Jackie Brown, sophomore
woman, and Jack Hansen, graduate
representative, made their initial
dives into the political whirlpool
following their arrival at the Farm.
