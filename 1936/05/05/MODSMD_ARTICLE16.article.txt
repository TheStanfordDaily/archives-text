# Commencement Services Will Be Held In Chapel
## Osborne Says Advantage Of Atmosphere, Interest Outweigh Space Limits 
### 
At a meeting of senior committee
heads last night it was definitely de
cided that commencement services
will be held in the chapel.
Professor George E. Osborne pre
sented the arguments for services in
the chapel rather than in the sta
dium, saying that expense, musical,
and scenic facilities are the principal
objections to the stadium.
Possible Drawback
Only possible drawback to holding
the exercises in the chapel, accord
ing to Professor Osborne, would lie
in space limitations. Senior com
mittee heads agreed that the ad
vantages to be gained in atmosphere
and interest to the parents of grad
uating students from the chapel
would outweigh any objections.
Plans were laid for the first gen
eral senior meeting of the year to be
held tomorrow night at 7:15 o'clock
in room 214.
â€¢Dr. Harry B, Reynolds, head of
the Stanford Associates, will be the
principal speaker of the program
and will present to the seniors his
plan for establishing an endowment
fund in place of the annual senior
gift.
Suggest Permanent Fund
The plan, if accepted, would con
sist of a permanent fund, using as a
foundation and beginning the mon
ey ordinarily used for a senior gift.
With this as a base it is hoped that
an endowment plan such as is be
ing used by many privately endowed
universities in the East will be in
stalled.
Full explanation of the movement
will be given by Dr. Reynolds at the
general meeting. Senior committee
chairmen last night put their stamp
of full appi-oval upon the plan with
the belief that if a good turnout of
seniors can be had tomorrow night
the importance and significance of
such a move to the seniors and the
University will be brought more
forcefully to the class.
