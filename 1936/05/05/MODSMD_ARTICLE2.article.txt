# Roth Rejects Free Meal Plan
## Women Guest Proposal Declared Too Costly 
### 
Comptroller Almon E. Roth defi- I
nitely rejected any plan for the ex- j
tension of free dining privileges to ,
the women of the campus, in a |
statement made yesterday afternoon, j
Reasons for this are, according to j
Roth:
"The matter of finance—as the I
system now stands there is an an- ;
nual income to the University of
more than $2500 from the dining
halls of the women's dormitories, in
cluding Union, Roble, and Lagunita. j
"If free guest privileges were
extended, financial loss to the
University would probably amount
to upwards of $5000.
"Secondly, there is the matter of
actual accommodation. For ex
ample, there are 19 more students I
registered in Roble this quarter than j
their dining rooms accommodate.
"The amount prepared for hall
meals is figured with regard to the
average attendance, which is never
maximum. The fluctuation result
ing from a new system of privi- I
leges would cause great waste in the I
food prepared."
Therefore, Roth summarized, Hall '
women must be contented with the j
present system under which they are i
limited to exchanging Sunday night j
dinner with any of the other worn- ]
en's dormitories.
