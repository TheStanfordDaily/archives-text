Democratic voters have a choice
between three delegations to be sen'e.
to the national party convention in
Cleveland this summer. One ticket,
dominated by Senator William G.
McAdoo, is pledged to President
Roosevelt. While not averse to
Roosevelt, the other two groups are
headed by Upton Sinclair and
Townsend Plan advocates.
More of a split is foreseen in Re
publican ranks. The Hearst-Mer
riam group, definitely pledged to
Kansas' Governor Alf Landon, is
seeking election over the Warren
"uninstructed" delegation.
"The Warren group will depend
upon its members' individual repu
tations for 'good solid judgment' as
distinguished citizens of Califor
nia," Assistant Professor of Polit
ical Science Philip W. Buck said last
night, reviewing the situation for
the Daily.
"Though it is pledged to Landon,
the Hearst-Marriam ticket is not
understood 1o be officially endorsed
by the Kansas governor," he ex
plained.
