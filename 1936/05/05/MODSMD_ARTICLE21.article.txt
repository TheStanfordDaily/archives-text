# Cathcart Cites Value of Court
## Supreme Judicial Group Acts as Balancer 
### 
"For one hundred and thirty
three years the people have sus
tained the Supreme Court in main
taining the balance between nation
and state," Professor A. M. Cathcart
told the Stanford University radio
audicnce last night.
Since our form of government is
based upon a so-called dual sov
ereignty, it requires some body to
act as umpire to keep each in its
separate field. Tho Supreme Court
seems to be the most logical body to
perform that task, Professor Cath
cart declared.
To allow Congress to be judge of
this balance, as some advocate,
"would make Congress a judge in its
own case and in time totally sub
merge the states," it was pointed
out.
In regard to the Supreme Court
and its work. Professor Cathcart
added that "this court sometimes
makes mistakes . . . for the Su
preme Court justices are human be
ings. But to him who reads with an
open mind the leading cases of our
constitutional law there comes an
abiding conviction that they have
been decided by sincere and high
minded, as well as learned and ablr
men, of broad and patriotic vision.
