# Brooke To Ask Mural Increase
## Proposed Budget Based On New Estimate 
### 
When Wally Brooke proposes that
the intramural appropriation be
raised from $500 to $750 tomorrow
night at the Board of Athletic Con
trol meeting, Gift Myers, intramural
manager, and Marvie Kahn, who
held the position for three years,
will present a budget based on the
increased allotment.
Marvie advocates Myers' "rotating
system of equipment." He says that
the intramural program, which is 50
per cent larger than that of several
years ago when the allotment was
$200 greater, is worthy of fine equip
ment.
"Awards are a necessary incen
tive. We should re-establish an
award system comparable to the one
used four years ago," said Kahn in
explaining why the award systems
is such an important item on his
budget.
According to the proposed plan, a
cup will be given each league win
ner in a major sport. Minor sport
winners will receive plaques. The
championship organization In each
sport will receive a permanent cup.
Bronze medals will be provided for
track winners and ribbons for win
ners in swimming events.
When asked about Harry Wolter's
suggestion that volleyball be added
to the program, Kahn said, "The
intramural program should follow
campus fads and interests."
