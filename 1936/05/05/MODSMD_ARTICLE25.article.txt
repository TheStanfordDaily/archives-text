### Les Squires 
The case of Landon once more
proves the fact,
That where you live determines
how you act;
He comes from just the middle of the
nation,
And favors just a middle-of-the
road position;
In fact, a middle resident,
He'd make a middling president.
The soviet Russians this coming
June,
Will show an eclipse of the sun by
the moon,
It's a matter of moments until the
Hearst press
Reports the affair with bitter dis
tress—
"Authority Sees Rixl Solar Plot,
As Russia Plans the Sun To $lot."
One Ray Lyman Wilbur, in making
a speech,
Attempted with lessons his moral to
preach,
Said he with some heat, "Let us all
praise the gopher,
He stores up his seeds and has some
thing to show fer
His hours of labor—
I le begs for no favor."
Said he, "Just perhaps wc all should
consider,
The trouble a gopher takes to in
sure his next dinner,
He stores up his seeds in a hole in
a tree,
And never expects to wine and dine
free;
It might just be wise—
To heed his advise."
In Spain they learn fast how to vote
with bullets,
And feature a fracas instead of free
ballots,
Alfonso knows for certain, now if
not before,
That he just ain't gonna reign no
more,
In fact he'd better settle down.
And fol'get he ever saw a crown.
