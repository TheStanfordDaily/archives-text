# Debaters Meet Hawaii Squad Here Thursday
## Debate Will Mark Close Of Trans – continental Tour for Six Visitors 
### 
Six University of Hawaii debaters
close their first transcontinental tour
Thursday evening when they come
to the Farm for their 60th and final
forensic meet since February.
Coach N. B. Bock and his Ha
waiian teams of the past have trav
eled extensively for their debates—
Japan, England, Australia. But this
year's trip, says Beck, is the big
gest one of all, colleges and univer
sities of 44 states having been in
cluded on its schedule.
Talk with Roosevelt
In New York the Islanders were
received by Lowell Thomas, who
welcomed them to their first debate;
in Washington by the President, who
gave them an interview for a full
afternoon; in Baltimore by the
American Florists, who presented
them with leis 45 hours away from
their own homes—via the China
Clipper.
While they were trying to get
from Bates College, Maine, to Wil- (
liams, Mass., spring floods threat
ened to interrupt their schedule as
the rising waters swept away all
means of transportation.
Season Very Successful
As to the excellence of the team,
"Almost every decision debate the
islanders have entered," Stanford
Debate Manager Wayne Richardson
said yesterday, "they have won." No
decision, however, will be made here
Thursday.
Last December at Honolulu they
defeated Pacific Coast champions of
1935, Tom Lambert and Charles
Welman of U.C.L.A., on the ques
tion they will uphold against Stan
ford Thursday, "Resolved, that the
territory of Hawaii should be given
immediate statehood."
The team is composed of John
Casstevens, Clarence Chang, Homer
Hays, Frank Hustace, Robert North,
and Robert Taira. North is a former
U.S.C. debater, having faced Stan
ford in 1933. Which three of these
men will speak against Stanford
Speakers Bill Kuzell, Jim Reynolds,
and Wayne Richardson, has not yet
been decided.
