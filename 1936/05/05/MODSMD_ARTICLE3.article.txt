# B.A.C. To Vote Tomorrow On Chicago Trip
## 
### 
Possibility of the only chance for
Stanford's 1936 track team to make
an appearance in a classic national
outdoor meet will come to a head
tomorrow night when the Board of
Athletic Control votes on the sug
gested trip to the N.C.A.A. meet at
Chicago June 19 and 20.
Over 80 colleges participate in
the classic, which has been held on
this coast for the past two years,
at Los Angeles in 19.'Â»4 and at Ed
wards Held in Berkeley in 1935.
It is customary that entrants must
meet certain time and distance re
quirements in competition before
the N.C.A.A. books are open.
Dink Templcton is highly de
sirous of taking six to twelve men,
however many have proved them
selves capable of showing in the
stiff competition of the N.C.A.A.
boasts.
