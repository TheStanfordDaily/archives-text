The Editor, Sir:
Before winding up the Convales
cent Home Drive for 1936 complete
ly, I should like to recognize pub
licly the labors of those who, in par
ticular, helped to make this year's \
drive a success. Roy Anderson as
sumed the responsibilities of the '
treasurer's job excellently; Jim
Ludlam earned as much in this |
year's King and Queen Contest as
any previous drive had garnered in
toto; and Chick Franich gave us an i
excellent Masque Ball. Margie
Johnson was responsible for Bean
Day's contribution, and Ruth Good
an and Peggy Sim for the women's
activities on Labor Day at the
Home. Bob Hoover drove the slaves
and arranged the fun for Labor Day.
This year's off-campus committee j
really went to work, and before they j

had finished, Art Lundin and Sylvia
Case turned in six times the amount
of last year's committee.
The Daily was most generous in
its donation of publicity space to the
drive. Jim Hill, Johnny Rice, and
otheir of the publicity committee
skillfully brought the facts of the
drive to the students' attention.
On behalf of the Stanford Con
valescent Home, I wish to sincerely
thank all those students and towns
people who contributed in any way
whatever to the fund of the drive.

Convalescent Home Drive
