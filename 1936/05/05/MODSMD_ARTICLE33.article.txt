The Editor, Sir:
Unable to abide with Mr. Living
ston's stratospheric idealism, we
must agree with Ex Committee in
their assumption that a real inter
est in student government is notably
absent on the Farm.
Except in the case of a very few
interested individuals of Livingston's
ilk, students in general regard stu
dent government as a grand oppor
tunity to ride the gravy train.
Livingston's statement that stu-

I 1 I
j dents are, "anxious to eradicate the
i sore spots of local politics," we re-
I gard as purely diaphanous fantasy.
Students show little interest in even
' the possibility of obtaining a sig
! nificant voice in campus administra
■ tion.
| In fact, it strikes us that inas
much as the student administration
is composed of students, that the
! faults in it implied by Livingston
boomerang right back into the col
j lective lap of the students. The time
and effort wex-e better spent in
: practical considerations than in fu
j tile attempts to overcome Stanford
| inertia. B. W. T.
