# 'Big Guns' Prepare Caucus For Hall, Row
## 
### Solon O. Swampum 
Campus big guns have boomed for i
! the past week, preparing for the last
J stand at Thursday's Row caucus, i
| which is scheduled for 7:15 o'clock
; in the No-Man's-Land of the Chi
i Psi house.
"Reynolds has it cinched," is the
most frequently-heard comment,
i This indicates that the Zetes and
I Toros will do well by themselves, if !
pre-election dope means anything.
Other possibilities were: Bob
! Hoover, until he became Interfra- ■
i ternity president; Mort D'Evelyn,
j who now seems to be the outstand
| ing candidate for senior president;
and Chick Franich, of the esteemed j
\ Toros.
Franich may run against D'Evelyn,
who beat a Toro by 400 votes for the '
soph post on Ex Committee two
years ago, or* against Reynolds, who
would be an equally tough opponent. !
Or he may look for greener fields, j
A rumor is being circulated in the j
halls, and vigorously denied on the ,
! Row, that Claude "Cab" Calloway j
i will run for the presidency. The
D.U.'s join in even-more-vigorous j
denials.
i
Tomorrow night the Hall sophs 1

gather for their caucus in Lagunita
("to make .some women come," say
organizers) which originated in de
fense against the Row's sophomore
contingent led by "Brain" Riddell.
Regularly elected delegates from
each club and hall will try to buck
the Row.
Best bets for nominations for
class president: Jack Calderwood,
John Dern, and Ed Barnett. The
first has the drawback of being a
transfer, but the added advantage
of basketball fame.
Junior women being mentioned
for the Ex Committee post include
Muxine Moore (eminently eligible,
but she lost last year), Shirley Jones,
and Suzanne Hammond, who will
probably prefer to run for Council
to opposing Merwin.
Mark Hopkins has been announced
as the veiled-in-secrecy temporary
chairman.
The Dern - Calderwood - Franich
list brings to mind former Toro
triumphs. Their motto seems to be
"If there's a Hall nomination to be
made. Toro will make it."
This year, we recall, the club has

Anderson, Franich, and Hansen on
Ex Committee; Adams as senior
class president; Ransohoff as assist
ant yell leader; Franich as Masque
Ball chairman; Elfving as Senior
Ball chairman; Anderson as Senior
Week chairman; Duffy on Men's
Council; and the perennial B.A.C.
policemen.
Last year they had student body
president, yell leader, assistant ditto,
! senior president, two B.A C, repre
sentatives, Council member, Daily
managing editor, Convalescent Home
chairman, junior man on Ex Com
mittee, Cardinals, and a party
bolter who ran independently against
another Toro for student body
president — and lost.

The Dern - Calderwood - Franich
list brings to mind former Toro
triumphs. Their motto seems to be
"If there's a Hall nomination to be
made. Toro will make it."
This year, we recall, the club has

Anderson, Franich, and Hansen on
Ex Committee; Adams as senior
class president; Ransohoff as assist
ant yell leader; Franich as Masque
Ball chairman; Elfving as Senior
Ball chairman; Anderson as Senior
Week chairman; Duffy on Men's
Council; and the perennial B.A.C.
policemen.
Last year they had student body
president, yell leader, assistant ditto,
! senior president, two B.A C, repre
sentatives, Council member, Daily
managing editor, Convalescent Home
chairman, junior man on Ex Com
mittee, Cardinals, and a party
bolter who ran independently against
another Toro for student body
president — and lost.
Campus big guns have boomed for i
! the past week, preparing for the last
J stand at Thursday's Row caucus, i
| which is scheduled for 7:15 o'clock
; in the No-Man's-Land of the Chi
i Psi house.
"Reynolds has it cinched," is the
most frequently-heard comment,
i This indicates that the Zetes and
I Toros will do well by themselves, if !
pre-election dope means anything.
Other possibilities were: Bob
! Hoover, until he became Interfra- ■
i ternity president; Mort D'Evelyn,
j who now seems to be the outstand
| ing candidate for senior president;
and Chick Franich, of the esteemed j
\ Toros.
Franich may run against D'Evelyn,
who beat a Toro by 400 votes for the '
soph post on Ex Committee two
years ago, or* against Reynolds, who
would be an equally tough opponent. !

A rumor is being circulated in the j
halls, and vigorously denied on the ,

Tomorrow night the Hall sophs 1

gather for their caucus in Lagunita
("to make .some women come," say
organizers) which originated in de
fense against the Row's sophomore
contingent led by "Brain" Riddell.
Regularly elected delegates from
each club and hall will try to buck
the Row.
Best bets for nominations for
class president: Jack Calderwood,
John Dern, and Ed Barnett. The
first has the drawback of being a
transfer, but the added advantage
of basketball fame.
Junior women being mentioned
for the Ex Committee post include
Muxine Moore (eminently eligible,
but she lost last year), Shirley Jones,
and Suzanne Hammond, who will
probably prefer to run for Council
to opposing Merwin.
