# DON'T BE SO NASTY

The Editor, Sir:
I object!
Today's Bull Session and Vox
! Campi are not fair to the average j
Stanford co-ed. In the first place, 1
we have a hard enough time living
down the "reputation" of just being
Stanford women, and in the second
place, why does even our own col- ;
lege newspaper try to "rub it in"
I that we are snooty, stuck-up and
j here primarily for money, a hus-
J band, and position?
There may be some few women
here at Stanford who came for the
I latter purpose, but on the whole, I
be ieve we are just as serious in our
■ "requirements for a husband" as we
I are in getting an education. Bob

Eisenbach writes as a rule pretty
good bull sessions, and this is the
first time I can remember in which
he has gotten sarcastic. Therefore, I
do not blame him.
It is an accepted fact, off the cam
pus, that Stanford women are not
only "terrific," bul also terribly
conceited. We are not expected to
mingle with the common individuals
of everyday life, and above all, never
come off "our high horse." All right.
We like Stanford, we don't want to
ever leave the place, but we feel
some of our rights should be our
! own. Take a look around the cam
j pus, Mr. Eisenbach. You'll find that
! there are very few "terrific women,"
| and what's more, most of us are
i human!
Sincerely,
Disgusted
