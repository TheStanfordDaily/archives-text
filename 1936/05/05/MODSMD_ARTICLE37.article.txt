It A C. SHOULD
VOTE FOR N.C.2-A.

Wednesday night meets the Board
of Athletic Control.
On the B.A.C. docket are many
and varied issues of business.
Among them is the question of
sending u Stanford track repre
sentation to the N.C.2-A.
The probability is that the
B.A.C. will see fit to lake up this
issue as one of its more im
portant matters and act according
to the wishes of the student body
and sand the men to Chicago.
But there is a chance that the
issue may be tabled and the men
not sent to the Nationals.
All that anybody, except a few
die-hards who still want to throw
up the Conference meet and go to
the 1.C.4-A., wants is that the B.A.C.
send this representation back to the
Chi meet.
This would be nothing but the
usual thing, for Card track teams of
the past dozen years have gone back
to at least one of the national meets
and won or placed high in them all.
But the thing now is to see that the
team goes.
Stanford has the team (second
best in (he land, remember), the
raison d'etre (National publicity,
Olympics tryouts, reward), and
the money (Rose Bowl, football).
The B.A.C. should vote the appro
priation tomorrow night.
WORLD WRASSLING TITLE will
be wrassled about tonight at Dream
land Auditorium in San Francisco.
Vicious Vicente Lopez, claimant to
the crown, will attempt to out-elbow
punch handsome Hardy Kruskamp,
who is generally regarded as No. 1
claimant to the Lopez championship.
Most everyone hopes Hardy will
win. He is primarily a clean grap
pler; he also is the inventor of the
flying drop-kick, in which he
feigns exhaustion, then lunges into
the air across the ring and knocks
bis foe cleanly through or over
the ropes. He is the former all-
American guard from Ohio State,
and shows the benefits of his col
lege career by being a more ethical
and above-board grappler. And as
a superb physical specimen he
probably has one of the most per
fect physiques in the world.
Lopez (not the piano-playing
hello - lopez - speaking maestro) is
more on the ignorant animal pug
type, like Joe Louis. His tactics are
to smash the opponent with boom
like elbows until dazed, then pounce
upon him with both feet and claim
the fall. But iitill he's trying to have
Hardy's dropkick outlawed for the
bout.
JOHN BUNN'S PARTY for bas
ketball men Sunday brings up the
fact that Sam Barry, the much
reviled Trojan coach, suggested last
March that after each series be
tween his boys and the Cards the
two teams should get together and
have a little get-together party or
beer-bust of some sort and promote
better relations between the ath
letes of the warring schools, as the
saying goes.
During the trip to Seattle for the
ill-fated playoffs in March the
Stanford hoopsters got well ac
quainted with the SC. outfit, still
talk about what a swell fellow Bar
ry really is and what fine yarns
Captain Jack Hupp could spin when
he had a mind to. —Breed

Lopez (not the piano-playing

more on the ignorant animal pug

to smash the opponent with boom

the fall. But iitill he's trying to have
Hardy's dropkick outlawed for the
bout.

It A C. SHOULD

Wednesday night meets the Board
of Athletic Control.
On the B.A.C. docket are many
and varied issues of business.
Among them is the question of
sending u Stanford track repre
sentation to the N.C.2-A.
The probability is that the
B.A.C. will see fit to lake up this
issue as one of its more im
portant matters and act according
to the wishes of the student body
and sand the men to Chicago.
But there is a chance that the
issue may be tabled and the men
not sent to the Nationals.
All that anybody, except a few
die-hards who still want to throw
up the Conference meet and go to
the 1.C.4-A., wants is that the B.A.C.
send this representation back to the
Chi meet.
This would be nothing but the
usual thing, for Card track teams of
the past dozen years have gone back
to at least one of the national meets
and won or placed high in them all.
But the thing now is to see that the
team goes.
Stanford has the team (second
best in (he land, remember), the
raison d'etre (National publicity,
Olympics tryouts, reward), and
the money (Rose Bowl, football).
The B.A.C. should vote the appro
priation tomorrow night.
WORLD WRASSLING TITLE will
be wrassled about tonight at Dream
land Auditorium in San Francisco.
Vicious Vicente Lopez, claimant to
the crown, will attempt to out-elbow
punch handsome Hardy Kruskamp,
who is generally regarded as No. 1
claimant to the Lopez championship.
Most everyone hopes Hardy will
win. He is primarily a clean grap
pler; he also is the inventor of the
flying drop-kick, in which he
feigns exhaustion, then lunges into
the air across the ring and knocks
bis foe cleanly through or over
the ropes. He is the former all-
American guard from Ohio State,
and shows the benefits of his col
lege career by being a more ethical
and above-board grappler. And as
a superb physical specimen he
probably has one of the most per
fect physiques in the world.
