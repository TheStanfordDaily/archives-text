# Track Team Out For Victory In Club Meet
## Warren Dixon Runs 4:24.4 Mile; Dellinger Back In Form with 49.4 Quarter 
### 
Angel I Field interest takes an up
swing after last week's lull with all
hands contemplating next Satur
day's dual meet on the new field
with Charley Hunter's Olympic
Club team.
Although an Olympiad year tends
to make a world-beater out of
Winged-O teams, the clubmen's loss
to U.S.C. last week took some wind
out of their sails, and Templeton
specifications this week call for a
win instead of the customary 40,
50, or (>() points as the oase may be.
Dixon Speeds
Warren Dixon led yesterday's pa
rade with a 4:24.4 workout in the
mile, his fastest this year. Chuck
Nimmo, who hit 4:19 against U.C.
L.A., eternally looks sick in a mid
week workout and looked as sick us
usual yesterday. The Dixon-Norm
Bright-Nimmo mile Saturday should
make everyone sit up and take
notice.
Truck Dellinger is at last in run
ning form after his bad muscle pull
last February. At lighting weight of
180, Dellinger ran quarters in 49 4
Friday and 50.1 yesterday.
Burns Ineligible
Joe Burris, senior letterman 880
runner, has effected a change of
program which makes him ineligible
to further running for Stanford.
Burris, a co-holder of the Big
Meet mile relay record, and who
was third against Cal this year in
the half, may tie in with the Club
this Saturday.
The spectators ended all contro
versy by taking measurements on
Giff Myers' stride up the back
stretch, and gave results as 9 feet
G inches.
