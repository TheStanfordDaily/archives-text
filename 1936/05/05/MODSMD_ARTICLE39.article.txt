# Golf Playoffs Hit Peak This Week
## Edwards Slightly Favored For All-campus Title 
### 
Stanford's interfraternity golf
program comes to its peak this week
as both novice and all-university
tournaments get under way. Quali
fying for the all-university tourna
ment began yesterday and will con
tinue until Saturday while the ini
tial rounds of the novice end today
with championship play starting to
morrow.
It is hard to anticipate who will
fill the shoes of such past champions
as Lawson Little, Charles Seaver,
Malcolm McNaughton and Phillips
Finlay. At the present time it looks
like Don Edwards, but Don is far
from a lead pipe cinch.
Bob Thompson is always in there
when it comes to playoffs around
the Stanford campus, that man
Spec Stewart is still pretty well
untried this quarter though Don de
feated him in Sacramento two
weeks ago. Stewart, troubled with a
sore wrist, forced Edwards to shoot
sub-par golf to win the event.
