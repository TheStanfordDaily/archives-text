# Thornhill Drills On Line Play
## Mangan, Carnahan, and Schott on First String 
### 
Dummy scrimmage and line fun
damentals were the main features of
yesterday's football practice. Coach
Tiny Thornhill used four strings of
men against the dummy team.
Outstanding in the first string
tackle posts were Bob Mangan, tall
brainy veteran, and Dave Carnahan,
star of last year's frosh line. Flank
positions were ably handled by Carl
Schott and Chet Olcott. Holdridge
and Mathews played guards. Sutton
was at center.
Besides coaching these men in line
technique, Tiny taught them several
new plays, including "tackle-smash
laterals" and other plays concerned
mostly with linemen.
Glenn Hamilton and Fred Wil
liams each made several long accu
rate passes. Jake Brigham, left
handed passer who transferred this
year from Menlo Jaysee, looked good
in line plunges.
Coach Thornhill expects to hold a
scrimmage at 4:30 o'clock this after
noon. Only two teams will be used,
but Tiny expects to put in all the
men he possibly can, so that third
and fourth-string men will have a
chance to show what they can do.
