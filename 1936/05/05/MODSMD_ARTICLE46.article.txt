### Tim Sullivan 
The mania to go East seems to be
spreading among the athletically
inclined members of the Stanford
campus. First it wa:s the tracksters
who clamored for a trip to Chicago
and participation in ihe N.C.A.A.
Now the tennis men are getting the
urge to cross the continent.
It is the desire of Coach Sherman
Lockwood to send four of his varsity
netmen to Evanston, Illinois, to com
pete in the National Intercollegiate
tournament which will be staged at
Northwestern University late this
month.
Ruling on whether or not the ten
nis quartet will be granted their
eastern tour is in the hands of the
8.A.C., who will meet tomorrow
evening to decide this important
question.
In addition to the intercollegiate
competition at Northwestern, the
boys will also compete in the' N
ational Clay Court Tournament to lx>
held at the River Forrest Tennis
Club in Chicago in the event that
their present plans mature satisfac
torily.
