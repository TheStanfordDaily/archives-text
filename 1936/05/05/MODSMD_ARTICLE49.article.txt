## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Stanford Entry In N.C.A.A. Has Every Argument the I.C.4-A Plea Lacked 
### 
The Stanford trackmen's motion for a trip to
the 1.C.4-A. has virtually died for lack of a
second. The Board of Athletic Control probably
will officially kill the move tomorrow night.
But the Farm's cinder aces will enter a coun
ter-plea that may meet with better success. This
request will not involve turning traitor to the
recently revived Pacific Coast Conference meet,
it will not necessitate a week's leave-of-absence
from classes; all it will be is a plea for the
wherewithall to transport from 6 to 12 men to
and from Chicago.
Hence, there apparently is no logical reason
why the BA.C. should not appropriate money
for Stanford participation in the N.C.A.A. track
meet on June 19 and 20 in its meeting tomor
row night.
Local authorities claim that Stanford's best
chance—slight as it is—to defeat U.S.C. this
year would be in a big national meet. The Na
tional Collegiates have become not only the
biggest national meet, but the only one truly
national in scope.
Stanford's trackmen are correct in assuming
that they deserve a trip this year. Entry in the
N.C.AA., however, is much more practical and
appropriate than the longer trip to Philadel
phia's 1.C.4-A.
