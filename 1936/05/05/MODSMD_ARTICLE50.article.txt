Newswires hummed with the death of an
American woman in Addis Ababa Monday, and
almost as quickly jingo groups in the United
States started yammering for retaliation.
It is an old story, the prologue to more than
one ridiculous and costly war.
Even if Mrs. A. R. Stadin had been deliber
ately killed by some goggle-eyed, slavering
Ethiopian, we would have no justification for
interference, nor for demanding an apology.
Mrs. Stadin was reportedly killed by a "stray
bullet." It is no insult to America that there
were stray bullets in Ethiopia, or that Mrs. Sta
din didn't have the foresight, inclination or op
portunity to leave Addis Ababa before they
were fired.
Certainly, the United States should protect
its nationals while abroad. But the feeling is
becoming increasingly strong on America's
campuses as well as in other places that we
should not obligate ourselves to fight for the
lost lives or property of those who, in foreign
residence, have dispensed with America's pro
tection.
