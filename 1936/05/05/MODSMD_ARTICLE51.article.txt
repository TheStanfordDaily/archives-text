# Drowning G.O.P. Grasping At a Wisp of Straw Men

### 
Of all times today is probably the worst to

ask anyone, let alone students, to remember his
duty as a citizen and get out to the polls.
The presidential primaries are being held
and, despite impassioned press pleadings to
the contrary, the outcome is probably the most
irrelevant in the history of state politics.
The Republicans have two choices: Landon
or whomever the delegates choose to support.
The Democrats have one choice: Roosevelt is it.
The main controversy is between Hearst and
anti-Hearst newspapers. The one booming for
Landon because he seems fit for a good fight;
the other booming for anyone else simply be
cause Hearst is for Landon.
"The Warren uninstructed delegation" is
what the opposition to Landon is called. And
just because it would make it possible for Cali
fornia Republicans to vote for a man who might
be better than Landon in the convention next
August- the phenomenon of not voting for a
man but for a delegation seems to be the best
choice.
It's a long chance, but the odds against G.O.P.
deefating President Roosevelt are long odds.
