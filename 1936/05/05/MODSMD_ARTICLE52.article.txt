# The 						Women May Have Something There
## 
### 
If there is anything funnier than a woman i
street-car conductor, it is a woman in politics. !
This is somewhat borne out by the current po- j
litical fantasy being hatched in the feminine
political abattoir, which includes the meaty idea i
of a joint Hall-Row committee and caucus to 1
nominate women political candidates.
Far be it from the ideas of mere men to con- 1
demn such a laudable assemblage, for the
heights to which the devious reasoning of the
feminine mind may reach are not fully realized, i
and it seems rather pretty on the whole.
It comes from the assumption that there is no I
political division between Hall and Row among
women, even though there is among men, that
women are interested in an empirical and prag
matic selection of candidates, in line with such
euphuisms as the sophomores' "best men for
the best offices," and are not interested in sen
timentalities, personalities, or group affiliations. 1
The Hall-Row choice this year probabily will
not keep any sorority from getting solidly be
hind any of the "three or four" candidates who
happens to be fro mthe Row, but it may actu
ally help in minimizing the "you-must-vote-a
straight-ticket" feeling.
