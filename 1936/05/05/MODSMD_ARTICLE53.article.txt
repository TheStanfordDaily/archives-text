## The 						Ideal College

(From the Daily Kansan)
A description of what seems to be quite an ideal
college from the intellectual viewpoint i.s given in the
April Harper's by Louis Adamic. At. Black Moun
tain College in North Carolina, the students and pro
fessors all live and conduct their classes in one big
building. There are no trustees, presidents, or deans,
but together, students and professors run the college
by a board composed of teachers elected by the faculty
and students.
John Rice, who was the leader in founding this
college, believes that the job of college is not "mere
head-stuffing of facts" but is "to bring young people
to intellectual and emotional maturity."
The idea of teaching lots of facts and expecting
students to learn them seems to be a bad one. Very
few facts are remembered even until the diploma is
put into the student's hand, and surely more pertinent
instruction along the line of how the student should
handle certain facts and himself among facts is of more
use in later life. Since college-should prepare one for
his life among others in this world it seems that all
universities and colleges would be better fitted for this
if they followed the educational policy of Black
Mountain College.
