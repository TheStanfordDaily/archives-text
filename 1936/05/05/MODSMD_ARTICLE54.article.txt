(From The Daily Pcnnsylvanian)
"We're not. coming East again next year."
That is the? announcement made annually by the
California track teams after they cleaned up in the
1.C.4-A. championships, which are almost always held
on eastern terrain.
But every spring finds the sun-tanned Californians
changing their minds again; every 1.C.4-A. meet finds
them once more among the entrants, ready to monopo
lize the honors in one more eastern track meet.
Last summer, as usual, the California teams let it
be known that their faces would be missing at the next
1.C.4-A. carnival. They said they were organizing a
conference of their own, in which the competition
would be more select.
But the travel bug has once again infested the sunny
state, and we read in the Stanford Daily about a
drive to send the Stanford squad East for the 1936
1.C.4-A.'s on Franklin Field.
The Californians' bright idea of a "Pacific Intercol
legiates , it seems is "not going to assume the pro
portions that it had promised earlier in the year," and
even Coach Dink Templeton of Stanford says it
would be great if his charges could participate in the
Franklin Field meet on May 29 and .'lO.
Naturally, Pennsylvania would be Rlad "to play host
once more to the Coast athletes if the iHttcr should
choose to rut) in the 1.C.4-A.S, Meanwhile, we
can do little but express admiration for their singular
regularity, both in winninc track mwk :m<l in ~1.
