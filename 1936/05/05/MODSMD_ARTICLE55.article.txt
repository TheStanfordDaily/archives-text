There occurs, at hand, a story about one blue
blooded Encina aristocrat who is an Etonian (or i.s it
i an Oxonian, or maybe just a clear boullon, anyway he
I can't talk without sounding as if he had a London fog
; in his mouth) who has put on quite a few airs for
the barbarians. He rolls his pants up, to make the
populace think he is a Harvard man, and then puts
I flowers in his buttonhole to prove that, instead, he is
I closer to the mineral or vegetable kingdom.
The boys in the black hole didn't mind the over
j bearing manner of their landed gentry until they found
i out (hat the aristocrat was born in no other spot than
San Mateo, California. And talked English until he
went East to prep school for a year.
Now, it develops that this erudite gentleman leads
a double life. By day he sits in German class and pens
love letters to the fair miss who sits next to him.
Now last quarter it was one aviator queen, however,
; this quarter, a switching in the seating arrangement has
! caused him to pen his love missives to a Pi Phi
; sophomore.
The poetry is all very pretty. It ought, to be. You
; can't beat Byron, Shelly, or Keats, anywhere.
By night our hero sits in his room with a 8.8.
I gun and takes aim at unsuspecting travelers on the
path below his window.
Now the fact that the gentleman, because of undue
j punishing of bound volumes, is most distressingly
! near-sighted, and friends fear for the safety of passers
| by, and of the gentleman in question. Because with
his ocular deficiencies, he cannot toll whether the
passing shapes are automobiles, human beings, passing
j elephants, cows, or sponsors.
