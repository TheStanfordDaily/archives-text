## POLITICS TOO DIRTY? 
### 
The college student who will ad- I
; mit he doesn't know what he is pre- I
I paring for is much less of an oddity !
j than one who will say: "I'm prepar- !
ing to go into politics."

And the 99 out
of 100 or so who
would scoffingly
disclaim any in- j
tention of want-
ing to take part in f
j government aren't !
I all of that frame
j of mind simply
j because they
I think they're too
I good for public
f service. They'll
j think of all kinds

j of elaborate rea
| sons before they'll admit that the I
I pathway to politics is too rocky for l
i them to negotiate.
* * *
The general idea is that politics is j
too dirty. The impression comes j
1 from lectures about Boss Tweed and i
Mark Hanna, and from reading
j such campaign "rumor" headlines j
I as "Gamblers spend $40,000 Fight- I
I ing Warren"'—the chief blemish in |
bay region journalism yesterday, j
The pathway to politics is muddy, !
I not rocky, they say, and they don't I
1 want a career through slop.
# * *
Of course all other careers arc ir
reproachable and to admit that one :
j is in training for for any career but i
| politics is a collegiate commonplace, j
Going into business to sell the least
| for the most and to hire the best for j
| the minimum never involves any- t
; thing "dirty." Senatorial investiga- i
| tions, anti-trust and pure foods '
prosecutions, and extraditions of In- :
j sulls are pure governmental blun- ;
ders.
* * *
Dean Kirkwood's charges just j
! couldn't think of the profession of
law as anything but eminently re- i
| spectable even though they all hope
| to play ring-around-the-rosy with
; justice in damage suits or to collect i

fat fees for keeping a murderer out
of the chair.
And of course an engineer never j
beat a city out of a dime in a sub
way project and no doctor ever col- i
lected fat consultation fees from !
equally fat but healthy dowagers.
* * *
Dirt in politics comes out in the I
papers like an incident of momen- j
tary moral laxness in a school teach- ;
er's like. But in the other professions I
the dirt is shoveled away in the j
corners and camouflaged with sheets j
of essential honesty.
But of course college students, be- !
ing average Americans, don't care |
what is actually there. What can be !
seen is the important thing.
Claiming that politics is too dirty I
is pure rationalization on the part of j
most students. Actually they know !
that politics is too tough for them, !
that they're not good enough men j
to make the grade.
Politics is for men who found ]
things tough at the beginning; not j
for those who started out playing j
fraternity poker, singing "Come !
Join the Band," or working on Con
valescent Home committees.

Fred Williams, present prime con
tender for the varsity fullback post,
once took a third place behind Jesse
Owens in a prep sprint race.
