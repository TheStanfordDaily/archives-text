# OUTWORN DEMOCRACY

| The Editor, Sir:
There has been too much criticism
j of the Sophomore Machine. Too
j many Stanfordites fail to recognize
I the fact that a new era has begun in
j our student government. The old
I method of the student body choosing
j their candidates for election and
picking what they consider able men
and women to hold offices is time
worn and should be discarded.
Today we have an ambitious
group in Stanford who are really
getting an early start. Already they
are able to lead the rest of the Row
around by the nose. Why do you
think that this group of sophomores
has organized their political machine
j so early? This early interest in run
ning I he school is solely for the best

interests of Stanford.
This altruistic group is gaining ex.- '
perience. When they become seniors |
and run the campus they will have 1
had a good deal of practice. For two
years previous they will have used I
the dictatorial policy on their own .
class. Everybody knows that expe
rience in politics is a good thing.
Aren't they picking the "best men
for the best offices?" It is true that
they didn't look very far outside
their own organization, and that i
many of the candidates are running
only because they withdrew from
the previous election, but then on
the other hand we should be grate
ful to the machine for assuming the
responsibility of choosing our offi
cers for us.
The Sophomore Machine is run by
men of vision. Such foresight in stu
dents so ybung is remarkable. It is

rare indeed to find a group whose
pre-election caucus is devoted, for
the most part, to discussing the dis
tribution of the "gravy jobs" that
â€¢ire to be derived from the altruistic
efforts toward choosing "the best
men for the best offices." Every
body get behind the steam roller
and give a big push. Everybody
get out and vote for their candidates.
An orchid to the Class of 'US for
allowing themselves to be the "hu
man guinea pigs" in this great move,
