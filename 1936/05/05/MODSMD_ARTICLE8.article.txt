# Juniors To Wear Formal Attire At Prom
## 
### 
The Farm will wear formal at
tire when it dances to the music of
Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra at the
Junior Prom in the Pavilion May
22, Chairman Frank Taylor de
clared last night.
Bids for the dance are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office for.'}. 75,
tax included. To prevent the in
convenience of an overcrowded
floor, only 400 tickets will be sold,
Taylor said.
Dorsey's band, nationally known
for its swing style on radio, stage,
and recordings, last month con
cluded a 16-weeks engagement at
the Palemar in Los Angeles, a ball
room which ordinarily retains an
orchestra for only six weeks.
