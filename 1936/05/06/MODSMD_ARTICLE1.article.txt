# Split Between Hall, Row 'Inevitable,' Ex Committee Decides
## Minor Caucuses Abandoned in Session; Star Athletes Given Awards 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Muck-raking died an ignominious
death in last night's Ex Committee
session.
The sub-committee's report on
"dirty politics, so-called," as Brooke
phrased it, reached the conclusion
that the status quo was not only in
evitable but the least of five or six
evils.
"A general caucus would be the
best thing," said Chairman Chick
Franich, "but I see no way to hold
it without having preliminary sub
caucuses which would defeat our
purpose. The Hall-Row split seems
to be absolutely inevitable."
Caucuses Abandoned
Class caucuses, publicized cau
cuses, and general caucuses were at
last abandoned en masse. "What we
need is Lincoln Steffens," said Bob
Gros.
Member emeritus Frank Fullen
wider, after threatening that "if I
say anything, I'll make a speech,"
went on to score the student body
with charges of "appalling igno
rance and lethargy, which are the
basic reason for caucuses. They are
not to pick the best candidate—that
can be told by looking at the can
didates."
Status quo was retained by an
8 to 1 vote, Creamer dissenting.
YACHTING REGATTA will be
entered by a Stanford team. This
seemed assured with recognition of
the Sailing Club, with 16 members,
which contemplates possible elimi
nation races to choose the crew.
TENNIS AWARDS were granted
to Robert Braly, John Law, Ben Dey,
Bob Pommer, Bill Seward, Bob Un
derwood, and Milton Mack, mana
ger. The by - law providing for
awards was altered, as recommend
ed by Coach Sherman Lockwood, to
state that nine letters may be
granted on basis of competition
rather than wins.
DATE GRANTED was D.U., May
15.
FROSII FENCING awards were
made to John Briggs and Herbert
Woolley. Varsity letters were given
to Dick Ferguson, Louis Lataillade
and Dwight Strong, exceptional
award.
VARSITY BASEBALL letters
were given to Dick Armstrong, Ed
Clark, George Farrell, Glenn Ham
ilton, Bob Hamilton, Leo Heagerty,
Darrell Holman, Jack Huddleston,
Vern Johnson, Tom Killefer, Bob
Matthews, Bill Newsom, Frank Trc
maine, Ray Weiershauser, and Ar
thur Allen, manager.

Henry Glasser, Charles Hayward,
Walter Hege, Herbert Hucbel, Pete
McArthur, John McGilvray, Frank
McMillan, Vernon Maino, Anthony

ELECTION BOARD substitutes
were named—Margaret Marshall for
Pre Merwin, and Sid Rosenberg to I
replace Paul Wahlen. "Preserves I
the Hall - Row split," commended
Ji rooke.
A DELEGATION from the Fort
Bragg Union High School honor so
ciety will visit Saturday. The Car
dinals are to handle the situation.
DEBATE COUNCIL minutes were
okayed — a whole year of them.
"Meetings," reported Gros, "arc
held in a sweet, smooth, and lovable
manner." Ex Committee was skep
tical.
Mary Morris Boggs was accepted
as women's manager, several issues i
were tabled, and countless minutes
passed.
Debate Keys
DEBATE KEYS were sanctioned.;
"Qualifications are irrelevant, be
cause they have to pay for their.
own, anyway," said Gros.
PUBLICATIONS COUNCIL min- !
utes, providing that a cabinet be
given the Daily for filing of morgue
cuts, were tabled. "Morgues for
dead pans," observed Franich.
DIVIDEX publishers will be guar- j
anteed no salary next year. Salaries
will be on a percentage basis, and
profits re-distributed with the Daily
getting a smaller shaie.
"Minutes are getting clearer,
Dick," complimented Gros.
"I'm getting older, Bob," pointed
out Creamer.
