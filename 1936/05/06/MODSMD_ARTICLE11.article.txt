### 
PULLMAN, Wash., May 5 (A 3 ).—
Washington State College students
had their say about campus "blue
laws" and other grievances today
and found a sympathetic adminis
tration.
Some 3200 students, practically all
of the residence enrollment, gave
mass vent to their feelings in a pa
rade and demonstration, after which
Dr. E. O. Holland, president, said in
effect: "We shall see what we can
do about it."
The students protested against
compulsory class attendance and
penalties for non-attendance, rigid
social laws laid down by the dean of
women, lack of a "progressive, clean
minded" administration, lack of
student and faculty control of cam
pus activities.
They demanded publication of
social rules, that sorority houses and
woman's dormitories be opened at
certain hours during the week to
men visitors, that residents in dor
mitories be allowed to have radios,
that Wednesday "mixers" (social
gatherings) with dessert, be permit
ted by the administration.
If their demands were not satis
fied, the leaders of the movement
declared, a general strike would be
ordered tomorrow.
At the end of a three-hour con
ference, Dr. Holland said: "Some
progress has been made." He agreed
to appoint a committee of "sympa
thetic" faculty members, to allow
residents in the dormitories to de
cide for themselves whether radios
would be allowed in the rooms, and
to study social regulations, revise
them if necessary, and to have them
published.
