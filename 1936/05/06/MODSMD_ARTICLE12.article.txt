# Butterworth Gives Inside On Nazi Youth
## 
### Alberta Carden 
Inside "dope," coming from Ed- |
ward Butterworth, young Stanford
graduate, has revealed many inter
esting details of Hitler's youth move
ment from the viewpoint of an inside :
observer.
In letters to his parents, Butter- \
worth has described his travels in
Germany, where he was allowed ad- !
mittance to many places closed to
the average tourist.
Likes New Institutions
He stays principally in youth ho
tels, which "arc really marvelous;
institutions," he writes. "They are ,
bringing all of the German youth out
into the open, at practically no ex- j
pen.se, and are providing them with |
good, warm, clean housing. America i
would certainly do well to adopt
these institutions," Butterworth
added.
All the boys in these hotels are af- '
filiated with the Nazi party, he ex
plained. And they all worship Hitler.
"They ate, I believe, totally unaware
of the real character of Hitler, and
how most of the world regards him
as a throw-back of civilization. But
in all justice it must be said that
these fellows are clean-cut, well
mannered and not war-like or fa
natical."
Na/i Take Donations
In Dresden, Berlin, and other
German cities, Butterworth observed
Nazis shaking cups and asking for

small donations. "Some say the
money is used for relief, others say
it is to promote aviation, or enrich
the political fund.' No one refuses
to donate.
He noted many former members
of nobility in soup lines, and many
of them were found running board
ing houses for a living. He saw no
. c igns of Jewish oppression, but Jews
"were noticeably absent from the
.-.I reets."
