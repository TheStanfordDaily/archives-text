# Senior Meeting Called Tonight By President
## Endowment Fund Plan To Be Outlined, Explained By Dr. Harry Reynolds 
### 
With the announcement yesterday
that this year's senior gift will be in
the form of an endowment fund for
the University, plans for the first
all-class meeting tonight were com
pleted by President Woody Adams
and his Senior Executive Commit
tee.
Main purpose of the meeting, to be
held in Room 214 at 7:15 o'clock to
night, will be a discussion and ex
planation of the recently created
endowment funds by Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, president of Stanford
Associates, originators of the funds
at Stanford.
Dr. Reynolds' plan suggests that
the fund become a permanent one to
be known officially as the "Stanford
Fund" and to be used as desired for
the general improvement of the
University.
Succeeding graduating classes are
expected to add their contributions
from year to year with acknowledg
ments for each individual gift.
The fund wiil work on the prin
ciple that (he Administration is bet
ter able to decide improvements
needed than can any one individual
class. The money will, therefore, be
put in one coffer to be used at the
Administration's discretion.
In an effort to secure ultimate re
sponse from all the seniors Horton
and Bill Woodard, chairman of the
endowment committee, are combin
ing better to cover the campus.
