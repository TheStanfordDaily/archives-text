# Play Features Unusual Comedy
## 'June Moon' Regarded As Writers' Masterpiece 
### 
When one reads an article or story !
that bears the name of Ring Lard
ner, he is naturally assured of some
thing that is bound to be funny; j
when George S. Kaufman writes a
play for the theater it must be good I
| —but when Ring Lardner and :
i George Kaufman join forces in mak- j
i ing a comedy, the result is excep- j
; tional.
It is one of these exceptional offer- i
ings that will be Dramatic Council's I
: next attraction in the Assembly Hall j
: Friday night. The play will be
j "June Moon," intact as it was when j
presented on Broadway, with but
one important change. Student- !
written tunes will be substituted for |
the originals.
The tunes written by Stan Brent,!
iAI Learned and Bob Bernhard, j
| Howard Roberts, and Syd Kraul
j add life to one of the funniest plays
|to be seen in Stanford's Assembly
I Hall in a number of years.
Tickets for the play will be on
sale from fl to 5 at the A.S.S.U. of
fices in the Old Union until Friday !
afternoon. Reserved scats not called
for by 5 tomorrow will be placed j
on public sale.
