# Van Gogh's Life And Work Told
## Record Audience Enjoys Tuesday Lecture 
### Gray Creveling 
Recounting in careful detail the
life and work of Vincent Van Gogh,
Thomas Carr Howe, Jr., last night
addressed the largest Tuesday night
lecture audience in recent Stanford
history.
As the lecturer told of a period in
the artist's unconventional life he
showed slides revealing the master's
work for that particular period.
Artist's Career
From the gloomy, stark "Potato
Eaters," through the execution of
portraits that appeared to breathe,
through the dancingly brilliant
"Sun Flower" series, the dutch
artist finally came to the painting of
writhing landscapes whose subjects
twisted in the agony which the lec
turer revealed existed in Van Gogh's
mind a few weeks before he mor
tally wounded himself with a pistol.
The controversy concerning the
correct pronunciation of the artist's
name was settled once and for all
when the lecturer pronounced it as
if written "Van Goak."
Slides Disappoint
Only disappointment in the re
doubtable lecture given by an ex
tremely competent student and critic
of Van Gogh was the fact that the
slides were reproductions in black
and white of "inspired expressions
in dazzling color."
But the absorption of the audience
in the pictures shown on the screen
and the intense interest with which
it listened to Mr. Howe's every word
attested the quarter's most worth
while lecture.
