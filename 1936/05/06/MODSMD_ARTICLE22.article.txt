# Landon Trailing In State Primary; Roosevelt Strong
## Sinclair's Epic Takes Second Place on Democrat Ticket from Townsends 
### Associated Press 
Delegates pledged to Governor
Alf M. Landon were trailing an
uninstructed Republican slate and
President Roosevelt "regulars" were
running away from two "liberal"
Democratic tickets late last night in
returns from state presidential pri
mary elections.
The uninstructed slate nomi
nally pledged to Earl Warren, Re
publican State Chairman, and
friend of former President Her
bert Hoover,, registered 13t>,401
votes in 4,5!)7 out of the state's
11,708 precincts, compared with
77,653 for the Kansas Governor.

Roosevelt's per
sonally picked
delegation ran up
3 1 7,545 in the
same precincts
while the Demo
cratic ticket
pledged to Upton
Sinclair's Produc
tion-for-Use plan
registered 44,936,
and Representa
tive John S. Mc-
Groarty's Town
send i t e group
gathered 25,813.

The uninstructed delegation fa
fored by Hoover and several other
Republican leaders led in all the
more populous areas.

"California has simply stayed
with the regular Republican
leadership instead of stamped
ing to Mr. Hearst's
ticket."
This is what Philip W. Buck,
assistant professor of politiccal
science, told The Daily late last
night when incomplete election
returns showed the Warren
"uninstructed" delegation lead
ing the Republican presidential
primary.
"The returns probably show
that Governor Alf ' La n don's
personal popularity was not
strong enough in this state to
overcome the regular Repub
lican leadership," Professor
Buck said.

Landon, whose failure to either
endorse or repudiate the ticket en
tered in his behalf led to a Republi
can split, was making his best show
ing in San Francisco where his ra
tio to the Warren ticket was about
10 to 11.
In Alameda County, home of War
ren, the uninstructed slate had a
lead of better than 2 to 1. In Los
Angeles County, which contains
about one-third of the state's voting
power, the Warren-Landon ratio
j was approximately 4 to 3.
t Mr. Hoover, who took no direct
part in the bitter intra-party cam
paign, remained up in his Palo Alto
home to watch the returns but made
no comment immediately.

Delegates pledged to Governor
Alf M. Landon were trailing an
uninstructed Republican slate and
President Roosevelt "regulars" were
running away from two "liberal"
Democratic tickets late last night in
returns from state presidential pri
mary elections.
The uninstructed slate nomi
nally pledged to Earl Warren, Re
publican State Chairman, and
friend of former President Her
bert Hoover,, registered 13t>,401
votes in 4,5!)7 out of the state's
11,708 precincts, compared with
77,653 for the Kansas Governor.

Roosevelt's per
sonally picked
delegation ran up
3 1 7,545 in the
same precincts
while the Demo
cratic ticket
pledged to Upton
Sinclair's Produc
tion-for-Use plan
registered 44,936,
and Representa
tive John S. Mc-
Groarty's Town
send i t e group
gathered 25,813.

The uninstructed delegation fa
fored by Hoover and several other
Republican leaders led in all the
more populous areas.

"California has simply stayed
with the regular Republican
leadership instead of stamped
ing to Mr. Hearst's
ticket."
This is what Philip W. Buck,
assistant professor of politiccal
science, told The Daily late last
night when incomplete election
returns showed the Warren
"uninstructed" delegation lead
ing the Republican presidential
primary.
"The returns probably show
that Governor Alf ' La n don's
personal popularity was not
strong enough in this state to
overcome the regular Repub
lican leadership," Professor
Buck said.

Landon, whose failure to either
endorse or repudiate the ticket en
tered in his behalf led to a Republi
can split, was making his best show
ing in San Francisco where his ra
tio to the Warren ticket was about
10 to 11.
In Alameda County, home of War
ren, the uninstructed slate had a
lead of better than 2 to 1. In Los
Angeles County, which contains
about one-third of the state's voting
power, the Warren-Landon ratio
j was approximately 4 to 3.
