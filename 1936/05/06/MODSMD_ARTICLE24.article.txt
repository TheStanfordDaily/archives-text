Monday's Gray Matter erred in
: aying that Professor Edwin Angell
Cottrell is a member of the Hearst
supported Landon delegation. The
difference between "C. C." Cottrell
who is a member of the group and
Stanford's own "E. A.," incidentally,
is the difference between an in
fatuated reactionary and a recog

ministrative procedure, state, mu
nicipal, and federal government.

DEAD ENEMIES
President Roosevelt has the con
summate good fortune to have most
of his political enemies die off. Huey
Long got his. Senator Schall, Gov
ernor Ritchie died as did some less
prominent members of anti - New
Dealism cults. General Hugh S.
Johnson tells of receiving anony
mous pamphlets ascribing the
deaths of these men to a New Deal
murder plot, and they insinuated
hat the reason A1 Smith refused
hi famous invitation to "raid" the
White House ice box was for fear of
being poisoned.
General Johnson tells of an
other anonymous pamphlet he re
reived which had a caption of a
six-pointed star. In each angle
was the name of a prominent Jew
and below that name there were
listed the names of less promi
nent Jews. The pamphlet asserted
that each group controlled a prin
cipal function of government. The
names of Gentiles concerned in the
governmental departments illus
trated were omitted.
The Roosevelt administration is a
/onderful and very large target. It's
i ard to understand the Republicans
hooting with the lowly bullets of
/hispefs and scurrilous but anony
ious literature.

This virile little sheet of four
pages is careful to libel no one

"menace of bolshevism" until any- j

one taking it seriously would look 1
under his bed four times a day j
expecting to find there a bewhis
kered, gopher - toothed Russian
communist leering at him.
Its every article shouts "Red" and
news of communist groups all over I
the land is chronicled. It would well '
serve a communist to subscribe to j
this little sheet in older to keep
informed on the latest moves of his I
contemporaries.
If the publisher is sincere I feel '
sorry for him. He, like Hearst, must
live in a world filled with bugaboos j
of his own creation. If he's not sin- j
cere he is exploiting men's attitudes j
and what I think of that kind of guy
doesn't get printed by law-abiding ,
periodicals like The Daily.
Why people worry about com
munism or sit around and hate
Stalin for an hour every day is be
yond my mental radius. Fascism is J

President Roosevelt has the con
summate good fortune to have most
of his political enemies die off. Huey
Long got his. Senator Schall, Gov
ernor Ritchie died as did some less
prominent members of anti - New
Dealism cults. General Hugh S.
Johnson tells of receiving anony
mous pamphlets ascribing the
deaths of these men to a New Deal
murder plot, and they insinuated
hat the reason A1 Smith refused
hi famous invitation to "raid" the
White House ice box was for fear of
being poisoned.
General Johnson tells of an
other anonymous pamphlet he re
reived which had a caption of a
six-pointed star. In each angle
was the name of a prominent Jew
and below that name there were
listed the names of less promi
nent Jews. The pamphlet asserted
that each group controlled a prin
cipal function of government. The
names of Gentiles concerned in the
governmental departments illus
trated were omitted.
The Roosevelt administration is a
/onderful and very large target. It's
i ard to understand the Republicans
hooting with the lowly bullets of
/hispefs and scurrilous but anony
