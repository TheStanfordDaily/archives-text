On the Stanford faculty since 1922,
Eliot Blackwelder is distinguished
j for his research work in many fields
of geology. His more recent papers
have been published in national sci

jas the glacial history of Western
j United States, ancient rocks of the
Rocky Mountains, and geology of
; Southwestern deserts.
After graduating from the Uni
versity of Chicago in 1901, Dr.
Blackwelder two years later joined
the Carnegie Institution expedition
into the interior of China. The ex

Two California professors and one

of the Academy, on whose member
ship rolls there are already about
ten active and retired Stanford pro
