# Dots, Dashes Wed Pair 7,500 Miles Apart
## 
### 
A couple of dots, a few more
dashes—from Paris to Santiago,
Chili — and a man and woman
separated by 7500 miles became
man and wife.
Robert M. McClintock, Stanford
':{O, was in Chile last week, where
he is employed as a secretary at
the United States embassy. His
fiancee, Miss Elena Barrios, was in
Paris visiting with her mother.
But distance didn't mean a thing
and they were married anyway—
via trans-ocean cable.
