# Further Honor Code Discussions Planned
## 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils de
cided in a joint session early this
week that further discussion of t he-
Honor Code would be necessary this
quarter.
As a result of this round table dis
cussions of the code will probably
be held in Roblo and Encina on
Wednesday and Thursday of next
week, to clarify the finer points in
regard to such things as differences
in interpretation of the code by dif
ferent departments.
