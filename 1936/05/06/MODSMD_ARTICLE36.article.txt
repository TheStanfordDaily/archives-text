### Solon O. Swampum 
Scoop!
After second balloting late last
night, Theta's Nancy Gray was cho
sen as Pan-Hellenic president.
Louise Howell was runner-up,
with Helen Shelton losing out in the
initial voting Monday.
Pre-election ballyhoo had Frances
Strong listed as probable winner.
But Pan Hell decided, D.G. dissent
ing, that house presidents should
not be Pan Hell presidents. First
vote was closeâ€”4, 3, 2, for Gray,
Howell, and Shelton respectively.

The Hall meets tomorrow.
And the Row meets tomorrow. I
1 And the Chi Psi's get the caucus, '
concluding a battle royal between
the D.U.'s and the Lodge.
The latent Chi Psi enthusiasm for
caucuses and such things is probably
explicable only on the basis of Bob
Mallett's suddenly announced as
pirations to office, which have had
profound reverberations.
Mallett and Bill Mac Donald are
the latest contenders for senior
presidency, with Mort D'Evelyn still
j conceded to be outstanding.
Frank Taylor, lone mention for
: senior man on Ex Committee, is the
S.A.E.'s one hope to date.
The Hall possibilities remain
shrouded in mystery. Franich may
i run for the piesidency against Rey
! nolds. If secret pre-caucuses are
being held, they are achieving the
rare distinction of remaining se- ,
cret.
The women's all-campus nomi- !
j nations, because of the caucuses,
will probably be rushed to comple
tion by tonight. Whether they will '
be acccpted en masse by the cau- I
cuses, or whether they will choose j
one candidate down the line from
their own living group, thus defeat
ing the purpose, remains question- j
able.

Daily scribes submit the following |
data as the probable women's list: j
Helen Grover for vice-president. A
year ago, Adrienne Johnston would
have been the logical competitor, j
Will the Row try to find one now? j
No one knows. Whatever the Row
does, voting will be either for or
against the self-alleged No. 1 Moth
er.
Ruth Neupert will probably run
for Women's Conference, with per
haps Phyllis Boothe providing com- '
petition. Goodan, Mary Lewis, Judy
Goodheart, Barbara Sweet, or Su
zanne Hammond will be up for
Council.
Lee Stearns as W.A.A. candidate
seems assured, as the board puts up
its own choices. Annalee Whitmore, j
Ruth Goodan or Naomi Carpenter,
or mebbe a Hall woman will be the |
Senior Woman fodder, with John
ston probably declining to run for
anything but class vice-presidency.
A thousand farm boys will attend
Louisiana State this year without
paying tuition, books, or board. I
