# GRAY MATTER LAPSES?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Creveling's usual timely and
interesting column must be found
guilty today of another inaccurate
statement which casts discredit upon
a man of sterling reputation.
Creveling declares that "You Re
publicans have the choice of voting
for a group controlled by Hearst,"
which group he characterizes as
"slaves on whom he could rely to
vote for Landon, or do anything else
he commanded." Then in a misuse
of "Gray Matter" (with which ap
pellation he titles the column) Creve
ling wonders "if Hearst realizes that
Stanford's own poli sci professor,
E. A. Cottrell, is on the Landon
list."
Probably neither Hearst, Landon,
nor Davies "realizes" this, for it is
obviously untrue. An examination
of the sample ballot for yesterday's
Republican primary fails to show
any E. A. Cottrell on the list at all.
Those who know "Stanford's own
poli sci professor" realize that Pro
fessor Cottrell, a recognized author
ity in the field of government, is far
too smart a man to be on a delega
tion controlled by anybody, much
less the "shady sage of San Simeon."
Professor Cottrell is too big a man
to demand apologies, etc., but many
of us fefcl that such are in order
now. To characterize E. A. Cottrell
as a "slave" or "controlled" is simply
more than we can stand for. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst and Edwin
Angell Cottrell are very similar in
deed to Dr. Wilbur's famed "gas and
alcohol!"
Very truly,
Poli Sci Grad
