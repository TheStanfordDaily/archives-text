ine junior, sir:
Because criticism of the last
sophomore nominating caucus has
been extreme, and because many of
the facts have been misrepresented,
it seems that something must be
said in favor of the so-called "polit
ical machine." It's origin was ac
tually quite a noble one. ,
Rather than be contaminated
by certain Hall politicians last year,
who were real threats as campus [
bosses, a group of independent
freshmen banded to defy the well
established control.
Those who were intelligent enough
to care whether or not they them
selves picked their leaders, held a j
caucus last spring. It was effective,
because there were plenty of fresh- |
men who preferred their own rule
to that of a few powerful seniors
from the halls. So the "machine"
got under way. At present the cam- !
pus (and the halls in particular) [
is startled and a little worried be- j
cause the sophomore's "political
juvenalia" has worked so surpris- j
ingly well.
In answer to the multifarious j
criticisms, it can be said that the!
record of the organization speaks;
for itself. The sophomores have held ,
to their platform from the begin
ning. That is, they arc solely a nom- •
inative body, and their purpose is to j
find the best people for the most im- I
portant offices. The support that |
caucus candidates have received j
proves that the nominators have i
succeeded to the satisfaction of !
everyone.
If what Mr. Eisenbach has said is j
true—that the majority of students j
are too lazy and uninterested to run J
their politics—is it not better that an
intelligent, efficient group should do '
it for them? The public rarely does '
know what is good for it, and cer- j
tainly doesn't seem to care, now that I
spring has come. So let the sopho- j
more organization work for the j
