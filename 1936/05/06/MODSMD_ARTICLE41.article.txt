# THE 						'MACHINE'S' O.K.
## 
### 
ine junior, sir:
Because criticism of the last
sophomore nominating caucus has
been extreme, and because many of
the facts have been misrepresented,
it seems that something must be
said in favor of the so-called "polit
ical machine." It's origin was ac
tually quite a noble one. ,
Rather than be contaminated
by certain Hall politicians last year,
who were real threats as campus [
bosses, a group of independent
freshmen banded to defy the well
established control.
Those who were intelligent enough
to care whether or not they them
selves picked their leaders, held a j
caucus last spring. It was effective,
because there were plenty of fresh- |
men who preferred their own rule
to that of a few powerful seniors
from the halls. So the "machine"
got under way. At present the cam- !
pus (and the halls in particular) [
is startled and a little worried be- j
cause the sophomore's "political
juvenalia" has worked so surpris- j
ingly well.
In answer to the multifarious j
criticisms, it can be said that the!
record of the organization speaks;
for itself. The sophomores have held ,
to their platform from the begin
ning. That is, they arc solely a nom- •
inative body, and their purpose is to j
find the best people for the most im- I
portant offices. The support that |
caucus candidates have received j
proves that the nominators have i
succeeded to the satisfaction of !
everyone.
If what Mr. Eisenbach has said is j
true—that the majority of students j
are too lazy and uninterested to run J
their politics—is it not better that an
intelligent, efficient group should do '
it for them? The public rarely does '
know what is good for it, and cer- j
tainly doesn't seem to care, now that I
spring has come. So let the sopho- j
more organization work for the j
benefit of the student body. As long j,
as it continues to handle things as
well as it has, the campus will gain
the cream of the political crop,
while the sour milk in the halls
curdles quietly.

The Editor, Sir:
May I call your attention to the
fact that The Daily's survey of cam
pus likes and dislikes regarding !
swing music is based on utter ignor- I
ance of the meaning of the term !
"swing?" Mr. Botsford bases his ;
argument on the premise that "fast
and hot" music is the same thing j
as swing music, and that "sweet and
slow" music is not swing music.
The article is a typical example of j
the prostitution of this rather tech
nical musical term by well meaning, |
but uninformed scribes. To the mu
sician, swing has absolutely nothing j
whatever to do with tempo, and vice
versa. Furthermore, swing does not
have any connection with the name ;
of any particular tune. It is a man

ner of playing—whether the tune be
"You've Got Hot Lips" or "Jesus
Wants Me for a Sunbeam." They
can both swing. It just depends on
who plays them.
As a matter of fact, about half the
tunes that were cited by Mr. Bots
ford have long been the vehicles for
America's very best exponents of
swing. Notable were "I'm Getting
Sentimental," "Moonglow," etc.
What Mr. Botsford was probably
trying to say was that the campus
prefers slow tempos to fast tempos.
This, of course, is about like coming
out in the headlines with the express
statement that the world is round.

but uninformed scribes. To the mu
sician, swing has absolutely nothing j
whatever to do with tempo, and vice
versa. Furthermore, swing does not
have any connection with the name ;
of any particular tune. It is a man

ner of playing—whether the tune be
"You've Got Hot Lips" or "Jesus
Wants Me for a Sunbeam." They
can both swing. It just depends on
who plays them.
As a matter of fact, about half the
tunes that were cited by Mr. Bots
ford have long been the vehicles for
America's very best exponents of
swing. Notable were "I'm Getting
Sentimental," "Moonglow," etc.
What Mr. Botsford was probably
trying to say was that the campus
prefers slow tempos to fast tempos.
This, of course, is about like coming
out in the headlines with the express
statement that the world is round.

Because criticism of the last
sophomore nominating caucus has
been extreme, and because many of
the facts have been misrepresented,
it seems that something must be
said in favor of the so-called "polit
ical machine." It's origin was ac
tually quite a noble one. ,
Rather than be contaminated
by certain Hall politicians last year,
who were real threats as campus [
bosses, a group of independent
freshmen banded to defy the well
established control.
Those who were intelligent enough
to care whether or not they them
selves picked their leaders, held a j
caucus last spring. It was effective,
because there were plenty of fresh- |
men who preferred their own rule
to that of a few powerful seniors
from the halls. So the "machine"
got under way. At present the cam- !
pus (and the halls in particular) [
is startled and a little worried be- j
cause the sophomore's "political
juvenalia" has worked so surpris- j
ingly well.
In answer to the multifarious j
criticisms, it can be said that the!
record of the organization speaks;
for itself. The sophomores have held ,
to their platform from the begin
ning. That is, they arc solely a nom- •
inative body, and their purpose is to j
find the best people for the most im- I
portant offices. The support that |
caucus candidates have received j
proves that the nominators have i
succeeded to the satisfaction of !
everyone.
If what Mr. Eisenbach has said is j
true—that the majority of students j
are too lazy and uninterested to run J
their politics—is it not better that an
intelligent, efficient group should do '
it for them? The public rarely does '
know what is good for it, and cer- j
tainly doesn't seem to care, now that I
spring has come. So let the sopho- j
more organization work for the j
benefit of the student body. As long j,
as it continues to handle things as
well as it has, the campus will gain
the cream of the political crop,
while the sour milk in the halls
curdles quietly.

May I call your attention to the
fact that The Daily's survey of cam
pus likes and dislikes regarding !
swing music is based on utter ignor- I
ance of the meaning of the term !
"swing?" Mr. Botsford bases his ;
argument on the premise that "fast
and hot" music is the same thing j
as swing music, and that "sweet and
slow" music is not swing music.
The article is a typical example of j
the prostitution of this rather tech
nical musical term by well meaning, |
but uninformed scribes. To the mu
sician, swing has absolutely nothing j
whatever to do with tempo, and vice
