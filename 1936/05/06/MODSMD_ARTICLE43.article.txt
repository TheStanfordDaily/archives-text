With postage stamps sold during
1035 at the Stanford Post Office you
could send a letter to Addis Ababa
and back 396,942 times and still have
a postcard on your hands.
Figures to this effect recently re
vealed by Postmaster Ralph W.
Evans stated that stamp sales for
last year reached $37,785.77.
If the $4,363.48 worth vended for
October, 1934—a top figure for one
month—were pasted end to end, as
suming they were three centers, it
would lake a billet doux something
over two miles long to hold them.
On the other hand, using the low
est recorded stamp sales in recent
years—the $1,575.48 of August, 1933
—one could mail syllabus fee bills
from now until 1941, summer quar
ters included, and still have a bit
left over for several cinch notices.
The four thousand odd people who
call for their mail at the little build
ing on Lasuen write about a dozen
letters monthly which end up in the
dead letter office for no address, and
fail to receive twice that number
because of wrongly addressed let
ters to the Farm. Sixteen hundred
rent boxes, leaving but 100 available
ones vacant.
The postal authorities are fairly
competent in catching up on the
chiselers who put written matter in
packages. Any message at all, be
sides a greeting such as "Happy
Eirthday," goes first class.
The clerks frequently open sus
picious packages sent parcel post to
discover full-sized Otters illegally
enclosed. The addressee pays full
first class rates on such as these,
often four or five dollars per pack
age.
