Bud Fisher's orchestra will be
featured at the sophs' annual all-
University jolly-up tomorrow eve
ning at 7 o'clock in the Women's
Gym. The whole student body is
invited.
According to Edmund Barnett,
chairman of the jolly-up committee,
special entertainment is being pre
pared by the members of the or
chestra. A new policy of controlling
"cutting" will be instituted so that
dancers may have a reasonable part
of a dance together, Barnett said.

Art Stoefen, the lanky basketball j
; center, is not the brother of Les ;
Stoefen, the tennis star, but is his j
I cousin.
