# Tiny Writes Yarns For Esquire, Collier's
## Pens Three Stories For Fall Publication 
### Gordy Frost 
For two yeai's now Tiny Thorn- !
hill has had to sit back and watch
the coaches of his Rose Bowl oppo- 1
nents speil forth with talcs of "the |
play that beat Stanford" and, in
cidentally, collect in the vicinity of!
$100,000 apiece for their efforts. Now
Tiny is primed fur his revenge.

When next!
fall's grid spirit j
begins to mount'
and the "mags" j
blaze their tales j
of football pro
wess it will be
"Tiny Thornhill
says" over and j
again — but not i
about the play !
that beat S.M.U.,
£or any other
* play.
Rather than J
write about ac- ;
tual grid strat- !

egy, Tiny is keeping his master-!
pieces toward the lighter side of the ,
game, humorous incidents, and phi- I
losophies of open practice.
In the last month he's written finis
on two stories, one a running yarn
to be spread over three weeks' worth
of Collier's next fall, the other for i
the pages of a September or October !
Cosmopolitan.
Those two out of the way, Tiny's j
now working over the rough draft j
of a story for Esquire. It's not due!
till July, though, so he's taking his j
time.
There were other offers aside from j
tHose three for Tiny this year, but |
the venerable boss of Red Tobog- !
gans decided that he'd rather spe- J
cialize in coaching than writing.
But he's always thought that some
of these Eastern coaches that wrote
everything from comic strips to
novels were carrying the coaching
racket just a step far.
Last fall when the Red Tobog
gan had just begun to roll, Tiny
was approached by the Saturday
Evening Post for a story. That was I
about the time that Sutherland and !
Kipke were running yarns in the \
Post.
But it seems that Sutherland and ;
Kipke had bad luck with their ball '
teams just a week or two after their I
stories were in print, so whether it 1
was superstition or something else, f
Tiny said "no."
But with the off-season Tiny has
had much time to swing his pen and
next fall newsstands will bristle
with tales of Stanford football and
the men who play it. i

Several families in Moscow, as r
I rule, share a communal kitchen.

In the last month he's written finis
on two stories, one a running yarn
to be spread over three weeks' worth
of Collier's next fall, the other for i
the pages of a September or October !
Cosmopolitan.
Those two out of the way, Tiny's j
now working over the rough draft j
of a story for Esquire. It's not due!
till July, though, so he's taking his j
time.
There were other offers aside from j
tHose three for Tiny this year, but |
the venerable boss of Red Tobog- !
gans decided that he'd rather spe- J
cialize in coaching than writing.
But he's always thought that some
of these Eastern coaches that wrote
everything from comic strips to
novels were carrying the coaching
racket just a step far.
Last fall when the Red Tobog
gan had just begun to roll, Tiny
was approached by the Saturday
Evening Post for a story. That was I
about the time that Sutherland and !
Kipke were running yarns in the \
Post.
But it seems that Sutherland and ;
Kipke had bad luck with their ball '
teams just a week or two after their I
stories were in print, so whether it 1
was superstition or something else, f
Tiny said "no."
But with the off-season Tiny has
had much time to swing his pen and
next fall newsstands will bristle
with tales of Stanford football and
the men who play it. i
