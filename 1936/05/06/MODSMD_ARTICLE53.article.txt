# Alustiza, Rouble, Muller Join Coaching Staff
## Ex Varsity Men Return To Help Frosh Gridmen Former Stars To Teach Kicking and Guarding; Anderson Reappointed 
### 
Three new faces will scowl at
sweating Stanford gridsters when
they "muff" a tackle or miss their
block next fall. This fact became
evident yesterday with the official
announcement that the B.A.C. had
elevated Frank Alustiza, Larry
Rouble and Wes Muller, all members
of the 1935 varsity, to the position of
assistant coach. They are under con
tract for one year.
Along with newcomers Roy Win
kleman and Bobby Grayson, the
above named trio will pool their ef
forts in an attempt to keep Indian
football teams somewhere near the
paths of glory they have trod dur
ing the three seasons just past. Of
course the old sage, Tiny Thornhill,
and his very apt pupils, Jim Lawson,
Husky Hunt, and Murray Cudde
back, will still be around to offer
iheir share of advice.
Coaches in Demand
The injection of this new blood into
the coaching staff comes at a most
appropriate time, as next year's var
sity is to be composed largely of
comparatively green recruits who
will be in need of all the expert in
struction they may receive. Bill
Paulman and Jimmy Coffis are the
only first stringers returning from
the ranks of the 11 who broke the
Mustang in the Rose Bowl.
The specific duties which Messrs.
Alustiza, Rouble, and Muller will be
called on to perform have not as
yet been definitely assigned, but it is
understood that they will spend
most of their time helping Jimmy
Bradshaw coach the freshmen.
Special Instruction
However special tutelage to the
varsity in the almost lost art of quick
kicking will be given by Alustiza,
while Rouble will be called on to
demonstrate the intricacies of guard
play, and the massive Muller is
counted on for tips on how to back
up the line. These mer< were tops
in their respective departments dur
ing their college days, and will now
engage themselves in passing on
their gridiron technique to the next
generation of Stanford pigskin per
formers.
In addition to the three previously
mentioned appointments Stan An
derson, who assisted with the frosh
last season, was again named to a
position on the coaching staff.
