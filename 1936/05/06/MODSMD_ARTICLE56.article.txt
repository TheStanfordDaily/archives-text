## THIS YEAR N.C.2-A.; NEXT YEAR WHAT? 
### 
From the latest reports from au
thoritative sources it looks as if the
B.A.C. will agree tonight to send a
number of track men to the N.C.2-A.
meeting in Chicago July 19.

That, in light of past B.A.C. policy
and present all-round welfare, is the
only just, holy, and appropriate
thing to do.
The number of gentlemen, to fore
tell further, sent to the Nationals
will be held open until it is known
how many—from 6 to about 12—will
stand a chance of placing.
Then those who place will be eli
gible for the final Olympics tryouts
in New York the first of July. Those
who do not will have to come back
and compete the next week-end at
Los Angeles. This last is a hardship,
to be sure, but the wholesale
slaughter of the schedules this
spring is only to be blamed.
The 1.C.4-A. would have been a
very desirable meet to attend this
year, chiefly for its superior pub
licity and "blue ribbon" features.
But the conference meet has balked
the repeat Coast entry to this East
classic and left the N.C.2-A., which
is a much greater "track meet for
track meet's sake," but less of a
proud blueblood or fabled honor
affair.
This year we shall see just how
big the conference embroglio turns
out to be. The conference moguls
claim it will bp a knock-out, the
blue ribbon boys say it will be a
puny four-way consolation thing
with little or no prestige.
Next year the Coast schedules,

though not primed with the need of
Olympic tryouts, will take the I.C.
4-A. and its obvious advantages into
consideration; if they slate their
conference meet for the same day as
the intercollegiates they will get a
tremendous crying-down by all
hands and the cook.
