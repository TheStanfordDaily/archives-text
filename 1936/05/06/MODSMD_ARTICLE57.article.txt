# BEN EASTMAN STILL THE BLAZER
## 
### 
Any squawk that appears in the
city papers or anywhere else to the
effect that Blazing Ben Bangs East
man has run his last record-break
ing race is unfounded.
True, Ben still favors his leg and
it bothers him at odd times during
a race.
But he has only been working out
for about four months now after
nearly two years of layoff, and has
already run faster than any other
half-miler on the Coast, which is
plenty good enough.
And about his loss of "floating
power." Ben has worked out sev
eral Sundays in the Stadium. The
day after the Big Meet lie said he
would try to run a coasting 55 sec
onds quarter. He strode around two
turns just as prettily and gracefully
as he ever did, with plenty of float
ing power, only limping once or
twice, and finished with plenty of
run left and not sprinting in 54.3.
It was convincing, convincing that
Ben is to be again the world's
greatest half-mile runner.
