# Muscle Injury Keeps Nimmo Out of Meet
## Champion's Career Depends on Treatments 
### 
i Chuck Nimmo, an easy tie for the
best distance runner that ever went |
j to Stanford, will be out of the Olym- )
j pic Club meet here Saturday, and |
I may have finished his college ca- j
! reer, depending on how a pulled I
muscle responds to treatment.
Nimmo, who is a senior and has!
bottom times of 1:55.4, 4:10.7, and!
I 9:37.5. caught his muscle injury the
I week before the Big Meet, lived it
down enough to score eight points
i against Cal, but has found his leg j
• unable to stand work. There is no |
' such thing as a good distance run- |
; ner who can't work out.
Best performance of yesterday's I
i session was a 9:47 two-mile which |
1 Warren Dixon took from Ed Bur- i
j rows by a yard. People always won
! der why Dixon decides to hit his!
! peak late in the season.
I A stiff gale was streaking across
j the oval yesterday, but didn't bin- ,
i der the shorter runners—Dean ran I
i two 10 flat hundreds, defeating \
| Kneubuhl in each, while Weiers- |
hauser edged out Cranston in a !
49.8 quarter, with Deilinger al 50.8.
| Malott eked in front of McCurdy in |
a 1:59 half.
| With that long string of big names!
j —Eastman, Marty, Bright, Black- j
man, Mottram, Dunn, Clark, and the j
i rest —paying us a call Saturday, the
I secret ambitions are soaring high on
I the practice field. Schween beat
McNaughton and Van Osdel once,
and several Cards are gunning for |
their big upset chance this week.
