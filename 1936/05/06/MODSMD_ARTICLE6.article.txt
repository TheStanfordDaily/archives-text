# B.A.C. To Pass On Team Trips
## Track, Tennis, Golf Jaunts To Be Considered 
### 
A lot of travel bills will come into !
attention tonight at the regular j
meeting of the Board of Athletic j
Control. For headlining the docket
will be a number of proposed trips 1
that the various sport teams arc j
contemplating.
On top of the list is this trip of j
the track team to the National Col- l
legiate Athletic Association's annual
outdoor meet June 19 and 20 in Chi
cago. Still without participation in !
a national meet, and with thought
of dangling something in the eyes of
aspiring young high school track- !
men, Coach Templcton's team is
anxious to send a small capable del
egation.
N.C.A.A. is also beckoning to l
Coach Sherman Lockwood's tennis J
varsity, who with funds for an East- .
ern trip in the latter end of June I
could not only attend the collegiate !
in a number of important invita- \
tional tournaments running at that j
time.
In addition, Coach Eddie Twiggs'
golf team will formulate plans for !
their projected Eastern tour. Four j
men were sent to the N.C.A.A. golf
tournament in Washington last year, i
and with the strong showing al- 1
ready made by this year's team, it !
is hoped that Stanford may enter'
the tournament which will be held
at North Shore Country Club, Chi- !
cago, late in June.
