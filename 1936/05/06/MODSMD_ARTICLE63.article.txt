## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Trackmen Will Run Against Nation's Best; How About Tennis, Golf Teams? 
### 
The urge to migrate has hit Stanford's various
athletic teams, and requests to that effect by
some of them will be heard in B.A.C. session
tonight.
The Board of Athletic Control probably will
ding the 1.C.4-A. track trip without comment,
but after some discussion will pass an appro
priation to send the leading aces of Dink Tem
pleton's troupe to Chicago for the N.C.A.A. in
June.
In so doing, the Board would be indorsing
and adding security to the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet, scheduled for the same time as
the 1.C.4-A., and still giving the track men a
try for a national championship before the
Olympic trials tear teams apart and make up
a super team to represent America in the

! Games.
Meanwhile, Indian golf and tennis teams are
clamoring for their fling at the "big time" in
tercollegiates. The Board will face the ques
j tion of consistency tonight—can it justly send
the trackmen East and refuse a tour to equally
capable athletes in another sport.
It seems reasonable to assume that when a
i team or an individual is champion of his own
j territory, he should be permitted to compete in
1 a new stiffer field—particularly in a year when
football drew enough unexpected revenue to
adequately finance the quest for new glory in
other events.
The most favorable national publicity Stan
ford athletics could hope to get is the reputation
for a creditable showing in a wide variety of
I sports.
