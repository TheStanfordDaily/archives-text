# In Protecting Themselves They Protect the Public

### 
The Board of Trustees, responsible for the
financial as well as the general welfare of the
University, is now buying stocks in accordance
with legal permission given them some weeks
ago, but it is keeping the actual nature of its
purchases a dark secret.
"We not only do not want to reveal publicly
the securities we have purchased," C. O. G.
Miller, chairman of the financial committee,
said, "but we will not."
In assuming this attitude the Board is un
questionably acting in the best interests of the
investing public, even though it may be de
priving players of the market a few reliable
"tips."
When Herbert Hoover, representing the
board, appeared in court and announced that
the University wished to invest in stocks in
stead of bonds because of the fear of inflation,
the bond mart was done no good and stock
brokers received unmerited benefit. Because
the Trustees handle so many millions of dol
lars their actions are respected by smaller and
individual investors.
There is actually no reason for this, for the
Trustees are just as capable of making invest
ment mistakes as any other group. By keeping
their transactions secret they can keep them
selves from becoming a local "guiding star"
among stock investors and prevent any possi
bility of being known as a shepherd that led the
flock astray.
