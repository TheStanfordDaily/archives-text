gift plan yet devised explain the details of his
proposal.

Dr. Harry B. Reynolds will outline the new
"senior class endowment fund" plan which
provides for a much more useful way for sen
iors to appropriate their gift money than by
buying a traditional drinking fountain. The en
dowment fund plan does not begin and end
with senior week; seniors who have any inten
tion of being active as alumni have reason to
be present to hear it explained.
