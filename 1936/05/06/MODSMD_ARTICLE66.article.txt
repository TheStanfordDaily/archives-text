# Dramatis Personae Non Grata

### Curtis Prendergast 
(Editor's Note: In order that a little of the
common knowledge of the drama world may he
broadcast at a time when there is interest in the
proposal to reorganize Dramatic Council, The
Daily's investigator, Curtis Prendergast, stirs up
some dust on the local hoards. Today comes
Masquers and Sword and Sandals.)
Stanford dramatics are in a pretty pickle. The
students complain that the shows are too arty; the
actors grouse about commercial shows that don't give
their emotions exercise; the technical director wants
more dough for sets; the dramatic manager waves
suggestively at the $1000 A.S.S.U. debt.
What's wrong? Well, plenty.
Sword and Sandals has had a notorious reputation
for being sissy. Sandoe, Balzer, Broughton, and Brauns
are no longer with us, and it is impossible to attach
the nasty term to such men as Fred Clark, George
Wood, Bob Garred, Pres Ellington, Dick Dawson, or
Paul Crary.
Of all the drama groups, S & S has shown the most
visceral vitality in producing every dramatist of any
importance from Moliere to Kaufman and Ryskind.
Paly people drove out to the readings, but even the
football movies fall quarter didn't pack the Little
Theater the way "Let 'Em Eat Cake" draped specta
tors from the rafters.
The socicty has produced shows when nobody else
would touch them. With organized productions Under
University control at present, the group justifies its
almost-unnoticed existence by scraping together the
15 buck royalty fees.
Greatest reason for the organization's exist
ence is (hat it uncovers more dramatic talent in
one large reading than a whole year of acting
classes or Dramatic Council vehicles.
Future Divine Sarahs and Cornells belong to
Masquers, honorary women's dramatic society that
sports such big names as Jean Albertson, Rosemary
Benct, Kay Arthur, Phyllis Corson, Fritzi Kolster.
Requirements for membership are supposed to be tak
ing part in three readings or in one legit production,
but the requirements have been sniffed at in the case
of one or more fair-haired daughter.
As a result there are more than enough conscien
tious do-nothings in the gang who constantly refused
consent to the production of Kathleen Norris' "Queen
Victoria," written several years ago for Mary Pick
ford and generally considered better than the one cur
rently on Broadway with Helen Hayes.
The battle-cry on the occasion of such a proposal
was, "Yah, Rosemary Benet wants to do the play be
cause her aunt wrote it," which missed the essential
point that Masquers was passing up an opportunity to
flap their wings better than they are doing at present,
sponsoring three readings per year of student-written
one-acts.
Masquers finally saw the light and scheduled
"Queen Victoria" for this quarter, unless they get a
couple of good student one-acts, which they won't.

Of all the drama groups, S & S has shown the most
visceral vitality in producing every dramatist of any

The socicty has produced shows when nobody else

Requirements for membership are supposed to be tak

As a result there are more than enough conscien

consent to the production of Kathleen Norris' "Queen
Victoria," written several years ago for Mary Pick

point that Masquers was passing up an opportunity to
flap their wings better than they are doing at present,
sponsoring three readings per year of student-written
one-acts.
Masquers finally saw the light and scheduled
"Queen Victoria" for this quarter, unless they get a
couple of good student one-acts, which they won't.
