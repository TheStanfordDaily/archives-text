The seniors have arrived at the striking and orig
inal conclusion of having their graduation in the Stan
ford Memorial Church.
The seniors reasoned the thing out carefully. Ex
pense, they figured, and musical, and scenic facilities
are the principal objections to the stadium.
There is also the thing to be considered that no
body wanted to graduate in the stadium to begin
with, not even to hear liberty challenged.
I hope that the seniors reconsider. Of course
expense, musical, and scenic facilities must be plan
ned for, but there is something to be said for having
something so important as a graduation out in the
open. The church should be used for such under
cover things as organ recitals and marriages. Then,
too, if you get tired in the stadium of listening to
the speakers or watch the vested interests grab their
special side of spring lamb, you can roll over and go
to sleep.
There is the point to be taken up, though, that if
we have our graduation in the Stadium, it is liable
to spoil the sentimental value of the Big Game. We
can't go using the stadium for every Tom, Dick, or
Harry, or for every little four-bit show that comes
along or pretty soon the audiences that annually pay
four or five bucks to see a mammoth spectacle where
22 very heavy persons spend an afternoon making
themselves, and 90,000 other people, very tired of
each other, will say to themselves, "Well, what is the
point of all this.' We can stay home and fight among
ourselves, and we will get the exercise and the ex
citement without having to climb up all those steps.
Why, anybody can come in this stadium any Satur
day afternoon and hold a graduation ceremony." No,
it is plain to see that we can't afford to do anything
to spoil the sentimental value of the Big Game, be
cause that is all college is for, after all.

1 So I have come 1o the very independent conclu
j sion, absolutely unaided by any faculty advice or
! suggestion, without., in fact, even a vestige of admin
i istrative approvalâ€”that, in view of the nature of the
functional significance and validity of graduation, tak
ing into consideration and under advisement the cere
monies, rites, and esoteric mysteries of the graduation
process, and the inspirational nature of the process and
| the speakers scheduled to speak, that the graduation for
the Class of 1936 should be held on our own Stanford
campus, and in a setting appropriate, fitting, and
: proper for the same, in short, our own Daniel Gug
genheim Wind Tunnel.
