## TOO MUCH ADO ABOUT SOMETHING 
### 
When sophisticated Stanfordites!

sniff at the more
of sex, pet topic
I written and oral,
than they know.
We are inclined
to agree with
them that men
tion of a Stanford
■woman in rela
tion to that amaz
ing three - letter
I word is a pleas
ant verbosity, not
to say a delight
fu 1 redundancy.
In more ways
I than one, woman

1 and sex are an
identity which makes separation an
; unnecessary if amusing pastime.
* * *
Full-fledged pragmatists drop the
i whole discussion, except for physio
[ logically motivated comments, be
j cause most women at Stanford, as
I women anywhere, are doing one
i thing—getting a husband.
Officially, of course, they attend
| Stanford to be educated. But in
j stinctively felt, if only unofficially
! admitted, is the fact that the women
are here primarily to get married,
incidentally to "get learned."
It is one of the penalties of civili
zation that a woman must not ad
mit her best function is in the home
—loving and being loved, bearing
and raising children, being compan
ion and critic to man whom nature
and society have conspired to make
the stronger.
* * *
And though civilization has cer
tainly not restricted the husband
hunting function nor inhibited wom
an's all - powerful home-making
drive, it has tremendously compli
cated the procedure.
Time was when women made no
bones about what they were after.
If they didn't have a husband, ihey
put starch on their noses and looked
for one, found him, and that was
that.
Today they still look, but they do
make bones about it no end. They
140 places "for the summer." They
come to college "for an education."
They want to "get a job." They in
vite this one and that one to parties
to "make a circle."
♦ * *
All of which is pretty, but at ihe
same time palpable bologna. They
do each and all of the above noted
items to get married—that is, most
of them do. They know it and every
one else knows it.
Women in Timbuctoo, Oshkosh,
Alaska, South Africa, Daly City, on
farms, in cities, and even at dear
old Stanford are out husband-hunt
ing. They do it nicely here. They
study econ as if their lives depended
on learning about international
trade, for instance. But actually the
only econ they intend doing after

! college is keeping a bank book
straight and checking up on the
| grocer.
They are, for all their pretense,
gunning for a groom. It's their busi
i ness, so we won't speak of it fur
! ther. —Bob Eisenbach
