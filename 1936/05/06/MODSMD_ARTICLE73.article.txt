•INSIDE EUROPE," by John Gun- ,
ther, Harper and Bros., New York
and London, 193(».
"This book is written from a defi- j
I nite point of view. It is that the
I accidents of personality play a great
! role in history," the author states in ;
e preliminary note. With this in i
mind, he takes his readers on a
back-stage tour of Europe, reveal
ing intimately the great men who
dominate the contemporary scene.
The trip begins with Hitler,
whom Gunther describes as a "man
without habits." whose only in
dulgence is a drug-like love of
music. Of Hitler's two "G-Men,"
Goering and Goebbels, he believes
i the former, "Publil Clothes-llorse
No. 1," is the leader's most likely j
1 successor.
Other of the seven chapters on
Germany deal with the inside story
of the Reichstag fire, which was ISet
■ by Nazis themselves, who entered
j the building through a tunnel lead
ing from Goering's office; and the
famous Blood Purge of June 30th.
After a brief consideration of
France, Stavisky, and "Lavaluation,"
Gunther proceeds to Itnly. How
many people know that Mussolini
started his career as a Socialist and '
pacifist? In fact, his early leftist
; activities and consequent incarcera- ,
tion in small jails have given him
i claustrophobia—fear of confining
! walls—which expresses itself in his
| enormous office in Rome.
J From Italy, Gunther takes us to j
England, through the stormy Bal
kans, with its Lupcscu comedy, and
finally ends up in "Duranty's In
ferno," Soviet Russia, where he gives
a vital portrait of Stalin.
