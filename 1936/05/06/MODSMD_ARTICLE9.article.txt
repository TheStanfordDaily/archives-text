## Theft of Banner Rouses Ire of Drama Council 
### 
Stanford and Paly police, Dra- j
matic Council, the fire depart
ment, the primary election board,
and Jim, the barber, were all
steamed up yesterday about a
strip of canvas.
Election board members who
passed the post office before (i
o'clock yesterday morning swore
they saw the huge canvas sign, i
"Scat Sale Today," swinging in |
its usual place across Lasuen
Street. Jim, the barber saw it, !
too.
But 10 o'clock passers saw only
the cut ends of ropes which or
dinarily held the sign to the trees.
Dramatic Council was frankly
worried.
Police Chief Fred Frehc thought
the theft could be traced to En- i
cina, but the fire department
planned to use its new ladder
truck to top all fraternity house
roofs. Last night the banner was
still missing.
