# B.A.C. Okays Trips To National Track, Tennis, Golf Meets
## I.C.4-A. Dropped in Favor Of N.C.A.A.; 6-11 Man Team To Go To Chicago 
### 
Stanford definitely will be repre
sented in National Intercollegiate
track, tennis, and golf meets in Chi
cago next month.
Participation in all three sports
was unanimously approved last night
by the Board of Athletic Control.
The move is subject to Faculty Ath
letic Committee approval, but this
approval also was unofficially as
sured last night.
Team To Be Chosen
Appropriations provided for a
tnack team of from six to 11 mem
bers, besides a manager and coach,
to enter the N.C.A.A. on June 19 and
20.
The team will be chosen later in
the season by Coach Dink Temple
ton, subject to Graduate Manager
A1 Masters' okay.
Chances Good
Four tennis players will compete
in the Intercollegiates in Chicago
June 22-27.
"Experience on clay courts gained
in last year's national tournament
should give Stanford an excellent
chance to take the doubles cham
pionship," Sherm Lockwood, varsity
coach, remarked upon hearing of
the B.A.C. decision.
He will select the team to accom
pany him on the trip early next
month, although it was generally
understood the four Indian repre
sentatives would be chosen from
Captain John Law, Ben Dey, Bill
Seward, Bob Pommer, and Bob
Braly.
Although Masters had received no
formal application for an appropria
tion to send the golfers East, ex
penses for a four-man team and
coach were provided, final approval
of the personnel being left with
Masters.
1.C.1-A. Dismissed
Golfers, it was understood, were
particularly anxious to enter the na
tional intercollegiates this yeÂ».r, be
cause they have made tentative
plans to apply to make applications
to hold the tournament at Stanford
in 1939, year of the San Francisco
Bay Bridge Exposition.
Without taking a vote, the B.A.C.
formally closed the 1.C.4-A. issue at
last night's session. The
recurring question of Stanford en
trance into the '"blue ribbon" event
rather than the Coast Conference
meet at Berkeley on the same week
end was' dismissed without dissent
after the N.C.A.A. trip had been ap
proved.
