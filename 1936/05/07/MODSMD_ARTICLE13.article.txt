# "June Moon" Curtain Up Tomorrow Night
## Dress Rehearsals Indicate Finished Performance 
### 
Dress rehearsals last night and
Monday indicate that a polished
performance awaits those who jour
ney down to the Assembly Hall to
morrow night to witness the Stan
ford production of Ring Lardner
and George Kaufman's hilarious
"June Moon."

bertson, Fred Clai'k, Janet Dole,
Dick Dawson, Bob Garred, Bill
Goldner, and Jean Reeder. The sup
porting cast includes Rosemary
Benet, Frances Farmer, Ed Barnett,

Despite the fact that Dr. John
Uhler has assembled one of the

belter casts seen here in the past few
years, he deserves recognition as
Stanford's number one hard luck
director. Not only was he forced in
the middle of the rehearsal period to
go for almost a week without one
character, but added to his trouble
came the news, Monday, that be
cause of an accident, Frances Farm
er had been taken to the hospital.
Relief came, however, when it was
. learned she would be able to per
form by Friday.
