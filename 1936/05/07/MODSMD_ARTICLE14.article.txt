# Reynolds Tells Of Fund Plan
## Alumni, Administration, Seniors Asked To Aid 
### 
Stressing the obligation of grad
uating students and alumni toward
the University, and the best manner
in which this obligation can be paid,
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds last night
outlined the plan of the proposed
Stanford Fund to a meeting of mem
bers of the Class of '36.
As head of the Stanford Asso
ciates, an organization composed of
alumni interested in furthering the
activities of (he University, Dr.
Reynolds has been instrumental in
organizing the Endowment Fund,
which, it is hoped, will become a
permanent part of the University.
Alumni Approve
Every part of the University will
be expected to support the fund.
The trustees, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Almon E. Roth, and many
alumni have already expressed
hearty approval of the plan, and
have promised it support. The stu
dents are the only ones who have
yet to signify unanimous support of
the plan. And this is the support
that is expected to come from the
precedent set by the Class of '36 in
making its class gift a contribution
to the fund.
Dr. Reynolds brought out the fact
that success of the fund will depend
largely on contributions from alum
ni, and that graduating classes from
now on who contribute to the fund
will be asked for yearly contribu
tions. The fund will be managed by
a board of directors which will be
composed of officials of the Univer
sity and student representatives.
Canvas Begun
Representatives from all living
and eating groups have been named
to canvas the seniors in the various
organizations for contributions
which will start the Stanford Fund
from the students' basis.
Roy Anderson, chairman of the
program committee, announced at
the meeting that orders for programs
and announcements are now being
taken at the A.S.S.U. office, and re
quests that orders be given as soon
as possible. Adams announced that
another meeting of the class will
probably be called the last week in
May for announcement of final
plans.
