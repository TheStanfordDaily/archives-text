# Campus Confides In Cellar Hashers

### R. B. Jones 
Hustle and hubbub in the morn
ing and a night club at night!
"That's the Stanford Union," says
Tex Ryan, Union hasher friend to
all those who like to "chew the fat"
over Union counters.
Confabs with Tex
From the time when the famed
"feed your face" establishment
opens its doors in the early a.m. to
the time when "stacks of hots" and
"two in the water" are forgotten
in the evening for the famous "choc
frost" and social gab, Union hash
ers arc confronted with attacks and
counter-attacks by students who
want to stuff the usual snail and
cup of coffee down their gullets be
fore a five-minute-away class or
meeting.
"In the evening, however," as
serts the well known Union tall
man (6 feet 8 inches), "little boys
and big girls, big hoys and little
girls, and the above-average Stan
ford women who are out looking for
'a man with a sense of humor' stop
in on me to have little confabs
and tell me all their troubles.

Something Always Happens
"Almost every evening something
| unusual happens to break the mo
j notony of the commercial atmos-
I phere in the Union," Tex goes on,
"and it is these little incidents that
; are lacking to the morning and
j afternoon business.
"For example, last night a bunch
of burly Phi Delt athletes were
huddled around the counter, and
while one of them was leaning on
his elbow, his hand cupped under
his ear, another drew a large mouth
| ful of water through h straw and
let him have itâ€”all the customers
saw it and thought it was a fine
joke when they saw the burly Phi
Delt's ear running over like Niagara
Falls."
The only social activity, according
to Tex, that takes place before dusk
is the publication banquet once a
week, and he urges the student
body not to confine their social par
leys to the Li be, but to come over
i to the Union where tin- hashers can
I enjoy them too!
