Row and Hall were at least par- j
tially reconciled last night when the
sophomore hall caucus at Lagunita
Court named Peg Woodard, Pi Phi, [
as its nomination for secretary- J
treasurer of the Class of '38. Jack I
Calderwood and Shirley Jones were
official nominations for president and
junior woman on Ex Committee.
After the nominating caucus, j
ehairmaned by Mark Hopkins, had
adjourned, another meeting was j
called to discuss possibilities of im- '
proving the method of nominating ;
class officers to alleviate the Row- !
Hall split.
Seek Ilall-Row Compromise
Cubby Schurman, Chi Psi, who i
with Hopkins headed the second j
meeting, received suggestions from j
both Hall and Row to the efTect that j
next year one all-class impartial j
caucus should name candidates from j
both factions.
Seventy-five sophomores, 25 from
the Row, attended the caucus. After
considerable debate as to whether
Row representatives should vote,
final vote was given to 20 Hall dele
gates chosen beforehand by halls
and eating clubs.
Killefcr Runs
Tom Killefer, Row candidate, put j
up by Schurman, was withdrawn
when it was decided that the meet- i
ing should voice only Hall senti- |
ment. His name, however, was re- j
entered by John Steinhart, Hall j
man. Other Hall candidate was Ed i
Barnett. John Dern withdrew in I
favor of Calderwood. '

thwaite and Pree Merwin, Row cau
cus nominee. Maxine Moore declined
to run because of "other aspira
tions."
