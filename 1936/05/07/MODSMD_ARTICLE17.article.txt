# Cards Debate Hawaii Tonight
## Contest Starts in Little Theater at 8 o'clock 
### 
Debaters Bill Kuzell, Jim Rey
nolds, and Wayne Richardson face
speakers from the University of Ha
waii tonight at the Little Theater in
Stanford's last big debate of the year
and the islanders' last debate of their
four-month tour of 60 American
universities in 44 states.
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett of
the public speaking department is
chairman for the evening. He will
begin the contest at 8 o'clock.
Professor N. B. Beck, coach of the
visitors, says his probable speakers
tonight will be John Casstevcns,
Clarence Chang, and Robert North.
They will uphold a question which
they have been extremely successful
in defending so far this year: "Re
solved, that the territory of Hawaii
should be given immediate state
hood."
Kuzell, second place contestant
last month in the JofTre debate, rep
resents Stanford on the debating
platform for the last time tonight.
He has a wide acquaintance with
the Hawaiian and Oriental problems,
having spent a year at Canton,
China.
Following the debate there will be
moving pictures brought directly
from the Hawaiian Islands which
will point out and show scenic
points of interest of the islands.
Members of the Hawaiian debate
team will personally describe the
movies.
