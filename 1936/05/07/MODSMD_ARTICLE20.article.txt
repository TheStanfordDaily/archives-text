# Row Ready To Begin Dinners

### George Veness 
Next week the first official inter
house exchange dinners will be held
in accordance to the schedule re
leased by Alex Berger, chairman of
the Interfraternity Council exchange
dinner committee, at the Council's
meeting last night in the Theta Chi
house.
As soon as the respective house
presidents have concluded final ar
rangements for the dinner the sched
ule will be released by the Daily.
Nominating Committee
In addition, a committee, composed
of Bill Newsom, Alf Brandin, and
George Prince, chairman, was ap
pointed by Bob Hoover, president
of the Council, to nominate and to
accept nominations from interested
parties for the Interfraternity Board.
There are five positions to be
filled on the board for next year—
three student members which will
be elected directly by the Council
from the committee's recommenda
tions and two faculty members who
are appointed by President Wilbur
from a preferential list presented by
the council.
New Administration
A new administrative system for
the board was announced to the
council by Hoover. According to
Hoover under the new system—thai
of having the entire system of board
affairs work under the authority of
five major committees—it is very
necessary that the incoming mem
bers be the best possible.
Concerning the new system Hoo
ver said:
"In the past the council and board
have not co-operated or understood
each other's actions as well as they
might. Under this new procedure,
having both the student and fac
ulty members of the board working
on the same committee and inter
changing the developments and
work of each committee, a closer
understanding will develop among
all members of the board. Also it is
important that good members be
elected to the group in order to
successfully promote this idea."
The idea of an Interfraternity
"sing" was dropped after Hoover
announced that although the house
presidents were favorable to the
scheme a poll among the houses
showed that (he plan was not popu
larly approved.
Next Tuesday the council will
meet and receive the recommenda
tions of the nominating committee.
