According to Mercedes Bergmann,
Conference president, the plan of
having a nominating committee is
merely a temporary experiment in
dealing with election friction be

necessarily be continued next year.
Nominations made by the group
are not intended to eliminate nom
inations made by other groups or
persons in the usual manner.
