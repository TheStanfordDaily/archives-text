### Les Squires 
Says Mr. Landon now I'll burst
The lines that tie me up with Hearst,
For heaven knows I've learned to
fear
A dirty bed in election year.
Said Merriam, at last I see
My party friends won't play with me,
If only I could find a nag,
To carry again a Sinclair flag.
Said Hoover in his hill-top castle,
I'd like to make that group my
vassal,
I wonder if they'd show vexation,
II I should seek the nomination.
Said Senor Hearst to Merriam,
ll seems we've drawn a blasted
blank,
The problem now is shall we scram,
Or call it just a friendly prank.
Said Senor Hearst, the point is this,
We've got to shift our published
stand,
Those Warren boys will never miss,
This chance to rule the party band.
Said Senor Hearst, we'll save our
pale,
By casting o(T our hated skin;
We'll simply claim the Warren slate
Will back our candidate to win.
Raid Senor Hearst, within the week
Will make the public stop and note
That what we really sought to seek
Was won when Warren won the
vote.
