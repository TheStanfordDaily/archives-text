# Nelson Eddy Likes American Audiences
## Concert Star Started As Journalist, Ad Writer; Vocal Lessons on Side 
### 
"I want to be called the most
American of singers some day," as
serted Nelson Eddy, tall blond heart
beat of "Naughty Marietta" and
"Rose Marie."
The operatic star says that he
wants his voice to be heard by every
human being in America—not es
pecially through vanity, but be
cause he gets a kick out of the emo
tional reaction he receives from
audiences.
"It was a big thrill to me," Eddy
said, "the first time 1 looked down
into an audience and saw a tear
trickling down an auditor's face. I
realized then that I had power which
could make people forget their
troubles, for a few minutes at least."
The 34-year-old singer started his
career as a layout man on the Phila
delphia Press during the day, and a
writer of obituaries at night. This,
he said, spurted him on to higher
literary efforts, and he got a job as a
reporter on the "Ledger," then on
the "Bulletin."
Leaving journalism for its rich
relation, advertising, Eddy wrote
ads and also took up singing, study
ing under David Pipham. Finally in
1924, he made his debut with the
Philadelphia Civic Opera Company,
while still working over slogans and
other subtleties of ad writing.
Tickets for his coming concert at
Stanford can be bought, at Keeble's
in Palo Alto and the Concert Series
Office in the Old Union.
