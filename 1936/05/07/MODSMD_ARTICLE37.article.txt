The Editor, Sir:
There is nothing more pathetic
than to see broken-hearted Ex
Committee shedding sad-eyed aliga
tor tears over the "lack of student
interest" at Stanford.
Should the Ex Committee offer
the Student Body a tangible leader
ship, the Student Body would re
spond, but as long as Ex Committee
insists on sulking with tear-dimmed
eyes, knee deep in black political
mud—the student body will prob
ably remain apathetic. Alter all,
thc4e is rather little in Student Body
government today for the average
student to feel very gleeful over.
And yet while Ex Committee hud
dles meekly in the corner, Wom
en's Conference has taken the bit
in its teeth, and offered for the first
time—an emancipation from this
traditional goose-stepping machine
politics. The women were willing to
make the effort—if that is "strato
spheric idealism," Ex Committee
could stand a good dose of it.
