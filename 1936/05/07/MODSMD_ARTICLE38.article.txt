# NOT A COMMUNIST, THANKS

The Editor, Sir:
I don't like to get nasty, but in
spite of all the sounding off about
honor codes and such, some fiend
has been systematically stealing my
gasoline. What I could do to the
culprit would make Clara Phillips'
hammer act look like Big Game
night at the women's rest home'.
There may be some explanation.
I don't have pretty cars like other
girls, and maybe you don't think my !
all-purpose grinder-style Ford will ;
run anyway, so you might as well i
confiseate the juice. Wrong. The i
lethal chamber does run, and I ain't j
Coolidge. Maybe some of the col- '
lege communists I've been hearing j
about have mistakenly assumed me j
to be a member. The answer, com- |
rades, is no. Definitely. And if you
arc trying for a redistribution of the !
wealth, pick on some son of a big i
banker. I am only a very poor gal I
coasting through school by the skin ,
of my second-hand false teeth, sup- 1
porting a husband and six father- !
less children, and it's all I can do to !
keep myself in drinking money and (
motion.
If you just don't like my face, I
come out in the open. I probably !
won't like yours either, and we
could rassle with sabres at fifty paces j
or something. Lay down, Mac Duff, |
or watch it.
