# Cards, O.C. In Close Meet Saturday
## Hunter Can Win or Lose, Depending on Number Of Clubmen That Enter 
### Phil Klauber 
Stanford meets Coach Charley
Hunter's Olympic Club team in track
and field this Saturday afternoon on
Angel 1 Field. Which of course gives
impetus to that oldest of fads, the
dope sheet.
This week that overworked word
"come-through", on which most dope
sheets tend to rest, won't get a show.
The outcome of Saturday's tourna
ment will depend first on how many
club runners Charley Hunter is able
to scrape together for the occassion,
and second on how cleverly he en
tors them, in thrust and parry
against Stanford's diversified
strength.
Will Hunter's Full Team Come?
If all the trackmen Hunter had
signed in this Olympiad year, and
he is still signing them, would enter
Saturday, it wouldn't be close. But
a lot of them will have to work that
day, or haven't had opportunity to
get into working form.
Chuck Nimrno, who has been limp
ing with a pulled muscle two weeks
now, may enter Saturday, may not.
Nimmo's leg doesn't hurt until after
a race, allowing him few workouts
.per week, and this start will show
what chances he has from here on in.
Norman Bright Is Entered
This is a bad meet to test a miler,
as Norman Bright of the club will be
on hand to win the event, bad leg
or no leg, and Warren Dixon, Cardi
nal number 1 man last year, is hav
ing his best days ever right now.
The two-mile also will be a race,
as Ed Burrows, Dixon, Bright, and
Phil Morentin of the Club all may
enter, and present a classy field.
The half will feature Ben Eastman's
return to local competition, and Ben
has cut a second off his time each
race this season.
Good 410 Field Promised
The quarter will be no bush
league race, either, as A1 Blackmail
ran a beautiful relay lap last week
in the Winged O-U.S.C. meet, and
Weiershauser, Cranston, Dellinger,
and Myers of Stanford and Wisler of
the club are all of the :4f) caliber.
In the field events, the cream of
the coast will come, with Bob Clark,
Johnny Mottram, Gordy Dunn, and
Walter Marty of the club all champs
at their broad jump, javelin, discus,
and high jump respectively. Yessir,
the Stanford field brigade is in for
a big day.
Admission is free with A.S.S.U.
cards.

sheets tend to rest, won't get a show.
The outcome of Saturday's tourna
ment will depend first on how many
club runners Charley Hunter is able
to scrape together for the occassion,
and second on how cleverly he en
tors them, in thrust and parry
against Stanford's diversified
strength.
Will Hunter's Full Team Come?
If all the trackmen Hunter had
signed in this Olympiad year, and
he is still signing them, would enter
Saturday, it wouldn't be close. But
a lot of them will have to work that
day, or haven't had opportunity to
get into working form.
Chuck Nimrno, who has been limp
ing with a pulled muscle two weeks
now, may enter Saturday, may not.
Nimmo's leg doesn't hurt until after
a race, allowing him few workouts
.per week, and this start will show
what chances he has from here on in.
Norman Bright Is Entered
This is a bad meet to test a miler,
as Norman Bright of the club will be
on hand to win the event, bad leg
or no leg, and Warren Dixon, Cardi
nal number 1 man last year, is hav
ing his best days ever right now.
The two-mile also will be a race,
as Ed Burrows, Dixon, Bright, and
Phil Morentin of the Club all may
enter, and present a classy field.
The half will feature Ben Eastman's
return to local competition, and Ben
has cut a second off his time each
race this season.
Good 410 Field Promised
The quarter will be no bush
league race, either, as A1 Blackmail
ran a beautiful relay lap last week
in the Winged O-U.S.C. meet, and
Weiershauser, Cranston, Dellinger,
and Myers of Stanford and Wisler of
the club are all of the :4f) caliber.
In the field events, the cream of
the coast will come, with Bob Clark,
Johnny Mottram, Gordy Dunn, and
Walter Marty of the club all champs
at their broad jump, javelin, discus,
and high jump respectively. Yessir,
the Stanford field brigade is in for
a big day.
Admission is free with A.S.S.U.
cards.

The crab-eating seal is one of the
rare specimens collected by the sec
ond Byrd expedition to the Antarc-
Stanford meets Coach Charley
Hunter's Olympic Club team in track
and field this Saturday afternoon on
Angel 1 Field. Which of course gives
impetus to that oldest of fads, the
dope sheet.
This week that overworked word
"come-through", on which most dope
sheets tend to rest, won't get a show.
