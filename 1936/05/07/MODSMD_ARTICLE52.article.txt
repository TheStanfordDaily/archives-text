WANTED: ONE
DECATHLON MANAGER

For the last two years now the
University all-sports decathlon has
been a decided success in the line
of non-intercollegiate sports. This
success deserves another decathlon
this spring.
But so far not one move has
been made to get the competition
going. It has swum into no one's
ken, to borrow a Keats figure, to
take the management of this novel
event in hand and run it off.
Giff Myers and Phil Klauber of the
intramural staff are full of baseball,
swimming, horseshoes, etc. Marvie
Kahn is not in a position to man
age it, and neither is Wally Brooke
or the Daily. Someone else must
grab the errant baby and adopt it
for this spring's forgotten athletes.
The all-sports decathlon is one
fine institution, too. You don't have
to be a big boy, or a very fast boy,
to do well in it.
Instead there are events like the
soccer kick, swim sprint, football
kick, basketball throw for accuracy,
baseball throw, sled push, fence
climb, handball serve, standing broad
jump, and 100-yard dash.
Skillful co-ordination is para
mount. with speed and strength a
minor, but of course contributing,
factor. A man who places high in
a contest like this is more equip
ped to handle himself in the run
of life's emergencies than a big
football guard or a man who can
run a 9.6 100 and do nothing else.
So as this decathlon is a wholly
worthwhile and fine thing for the
male students let there be a little
bustle and move to get the thing
going.

RUSTY LEDBETTER
FOUND IN LULU

This next item was brought in by
Chappie's Curt Prendergast, who
just at present is going through a
terrific inner struggle to decide
which cornet player he likes best,
the divine phrasing of Bix Bieder
becke or the lemon-sour seventh
ninth brilliance of "Little Jazz"' El
dridge.
Anyway, to end the digression,
Curt brings in a clipping from the
Honolulu Advertiser of April 2(5. It
is a sport page picture of the 35th
Infantry track team.
In the front row is Rusty Led
bctter, big and smiling, and in the

—■ |
accompanying story it says that
Rusty got second place in the shot, j
with a toss of 44 feet 1 inch.
Now for those who don't know,
Rusty once went to Stanford and
was the star oi' the 19H7 frosh foot
ball team and threw the shot as well, i
lie could probably lie right up in
there right now at the first string
fullback job. He was a terrifically
hard slashing driving runner and
would shake off tacklers three
and four at a time when he got
going.
He was on the frosh team that
Carl Schott, Fred Williams, Joe
Vigna, and Dale Beedle were on
and was one of its biggest stars !
and probably largest ground
gainer.
In short, he was a whale of a
fullback prospect for Tiny's varsity
and possibly a first-class shot
putter. But he went the way of all
Hash after football season and
dropped out of school completely
during his soph fall quarter.
This is the first he has been heard
of for a long time. And probably
having a very fine time in Honolulu
about now too. —Breed
