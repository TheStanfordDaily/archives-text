## 
### 
Junior and senior nines, by vir- j
tu;i of taking victories over fresh
man and sophomore baseballers, re
spectively, will clash tomorrow for '
the University interclass champion
ship.
As no bona fide frosh turned up
for the game yesterday, the juniors
clashed with a would-be frosh
team composed of six sophomores,
two graduates, and one senior, and i
emerged victorious, 9-6.
Bill Newsom and Darrel Holman
pitched for the juniors, while Gor- I
don Mallatratt and Fred Heringer
hurled for the pick-up team. Mon
day the two losing teams will meet
for the consolation title.

A great increase in the popularity
of motion pictures in Japan is indi
cated in reports to the Department
of Commerce. The Japanese favor
i locally made pictures, but American
I films are definitely preferred among
j foreign productions.
