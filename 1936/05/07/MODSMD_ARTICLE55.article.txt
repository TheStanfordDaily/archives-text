As a result of at least three pre-caucus cau
cuses, the nominations for student offices in
the Five Star Final of Hall and Row caucuses
tonight will not be surprising in all cases.
Unless some unforeseen insurgents show up
to turn the smooth flowing tide to the polls, the
candidates who will be announced tomorrow
will be the same as those whose unofficial hats
are already in the ring. And that is something
unusual on the Farm.
The opening note on the political gong was
struck when the Row sophomores held an
open caucus last Week and named the Row's
choices for class of '38 offices. That brought
the political minded to their feet, dug the post
holes for the fence between Hall and Row fac
tions, and proved conclusively that pre-caucus
organization is practical and probably effective.
By last night the political gong was vibrating
from steady striking afe Hall sophomore men
and women met to choose their candidates and
Women's Conference followers named its
choices. Over in Encina the traditionally under
cover freshmen were getting their men lined
up. In an "it was the night before Christmas"
atmosphere the campus showed more interest
in spring elections than has been seen on the

Farm in many years.
All the activity tends chiefly to prove that
"the Hall-Row split" is not only inevitable but
is virtually an accepted axiom. For no other
reason than that two factions are essentially
necessary in any major election and that be
cause the line of least resistance is to choose
the physical divisions, Row and Hall have be
come names of two political parties.
But no one, feeling strongly that the tradi
tional spirit of "democracy" and "equality"
among students should be maintained, need
feel that an insuperable barrier has been set up.
Election results show that few vote a straight
Row or Hall ticket—there are almost invariably
deviations in cases where a friend from the
opposite "party" is running, or where the'voter
actually believes the opposition candidate is
more capable.
Pre-election activity, consequently, is not a
vicious practice—in fact, it has one great virtue:
it usually succeeds, as it is doing admirably
this year, in stirring up a campus-wide interest
in the election and it serves to familiarize the
electorate with the names of the candidates, if
not with their faces, characteristics, and capa
bilities.

open caucus last Week and named the Row's
choices for class of '38 offices. That brought
the political minded to their feet, dug the post
holes for the fence between Hall and Row fac
tions, and proved conclusively that pre-caucus
organization is practical and probably effective.
By last night the political gong was vibrating
from steady striking afe Hall sophomore men
and women met to choose their candidates and
Women's Conference followers named its
choices. Over in Encina the traditionally under
cover freshmen were getting their men lined
up. In an "it was the night before Christmas"
atmosphere the campus showed more interest
in spring elections than has been seen on the

Farm in many years.
All the activity tends chiefly to prove that
"the Hall-Row split" is not only inevitable but
is virtually an accepted axiom. For no other
reason than that two factions are essentially
necessary in any major election and that be
cause the line of least resistance is to choose
the physical divisions, Row and Hall have be
come names of two political parties.
But no one, feeling strongly that the tradi
tional spirit of "democracy" and "equality"
among students should be maintained, need
feel that an insuperable barrier has been set up.
Election results show that few vote a straight
Row or Hall ticket—there are almost invariably
deviations in cases where a friend from the
opposite "party" is running, or where the'voter
actually believes the opposition candidate is
more capable.
Pre-election activity, consequently, is not a
vicious practice—in fact, it has one great virtue:
it usually succeeds, as it is doing admirably
this year, in stirring up a campus-wide interest
in the election and it serves to familiarize the
electorate with the names of the candidates, if
not with their faces, characteristics, and capa
bilities.
As a result of at least three pre-caucus cau
cuses, the nominations for student offices in
the Five Star Final of Hall and Row caucuses
tonight will not be surprising in all cases.
Unless some unforeseen insurgents show up
to turn the smooth flowing tide to the polls, the
candidates who will be announced tomorrow
will be the same as those whose unofficial hats
are already in the ring. And that is something
unusual on the Farm.
