# New Pressures May Dissolve A Well-Organized System

When The Daily brought up its question on
the women sponsors, several of the feminine
big-wigs asked, "Why don't you do something
about the men sponsors-"

The men sponsors were said to have no larger
vocabularies than the all-inclusive phrase, "Pipe
down, you lugs," were purported to visit En
cina only long enough to sleep and eat, and to
set a fine example for the neophytes in building
the body if not in punishig the books.
In contrast, it was said, the women sponsors
undergo an extensive training in freshman
guidance and are reguired to solve many prob
lems in connection with the conflicts experi
enced by their flighty charges.
This, however, is not due to any tie-in v/ith
the present room-rent controversy, but to the
fact that women at Stanford have always been
better organized, and have always cherished
certain ideas and ideals about their sponsors.
The striking thing is not that there is a differ
ence in the sponsor ideology, but that the
women have had to pay heavily for that attitude
in time spent, without corresponding reduction
in room rent.
As long as it was such an honor to become a
woman sponsor, and sponsorship often cinched
the woman for Cap and Gown, the expedients
balanced and the capable women were willing
to take the sacrifice.
Nowadays, it is evident that if women are to
retain a vestige of the former prestige attached
to the woman sponsor's job, they must do some
thing to make it worth while for the outstanding
women.
