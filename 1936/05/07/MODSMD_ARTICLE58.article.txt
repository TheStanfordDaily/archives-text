### Curtis Prendergast 
(Editor's Note: Curtis Prendergast continues his
leer into the limelights of the local drama, with a
dissertation today upon Barnstormers and "Ram's
Head, Its Cause and Cure.")

Late one Thursday night not so long ago a whole
lot of Ram's Head brethren and their girl friends
were having the time of their lives throwing furni
ture around a private suite in the Mark. After the
soiree was over, a rented Greyhound bus of tremen
dous proportions lugged them back to the campus.
The party cost about 130 or 140 dollars.
Don't worry—they weren't paying for it. About
70 dollars of the bill was financed by pure loot ob
tained by sponsoring the winter quarter Reg Dance.
The rest was paid by the suckers who were socked
ten bucks apiece for the privilege of joining the so
ciety. It's simple—you pay and you're in. And think
of thq honor!
It was a coincidence last fall when Ram's Head
actually produced the Big Game Gaieties it annually
"sponsors." Besides the annual party, Ram's Head
does practically nothing. For one thing, the organiza
tion is top-heavy with members who have done noth
ing more worthy of distinction than carrying a tray
across the stage or standing under the arc lights,
shaking hands, and saying nothing. At the same time,
every campus comedian of note belongs to Ram's
Head, although all of them put on their acts individ
ually and not through their connection wth the or
ganization.
Winstead Weaver, late of Stanford and El Camino
Ileal; Jim Copp, Chappie ed; Dick Dawson, chalk
maker; and musicians Ernie Heckscher, Pete
Knecht, Gordy Heche, and Fred Nagel have all
become prominent largely through work in recent
Gaieties. Ram's Head has a representative on the
Dramatic Council, but he rarely gets to meetings.
The infant society of them all, Barnstormers, is
notable if for nothing except that there i.s no initiation
fee, nor any dues. The name under which they were
first organized, the Old Guard, implies better than
the present one the fact that the membership is
substantially a combination of the most active mem
bers. male and female, of Masquers, S & S, and Ram's
Head.
Original purpose of the group was to continue the
spring musical show tradition, discontinued in 1932
when the Junior Opera coughed up the ghost and
revived in 1935 with the Follies Bourgeois.
Internal dissension has already hamstrung Barn
stormers. When the organizers petitioned for A.S.S.U.
recognition and a seat on the Council. Ex Committee
granted recognition, then refused the seat. When it
came to choosing the coming spring musical, Frank
O Neil! made better progress, with 'i talk to Barn
stormers on how he didn't want to dominate the
organization.
Barnstormers listened to Mac Gordon's excellent
songs sung by Shirley Jones, with the incidental plot
by O Neill. then voted overwhelmingly for the Gor
don-O'Neill script, "Three Sheets to the Wind."
Well, () Neill may not have dominated Barnstorm
ers, but he certainly dominated the script, which may
or may not be a good thing, depending on whether
you like yours .sliced thin or thick.
