LOVE IS IN THE AIR
(Or Town Haul Tonight)
Lots of talkee.
Lots of cauci.
A striking paucity
Of reciprocity.
But not of verbosity
Or viscosity,
(A boss embalms
The itchy palms.)
And before the talk's died.
The Farm can see the whole thing's cauc-ied

This is not to be interpreted as meaning that I am
a candidate for political office, or that I am affiliated
with any political party, or that I have made any
promises to any group or interest, in fact, it is not
to be interpreted as meaning anything.

At Lagunita the other night, quite at variance with
the usual run of things, a Casa Del Eucalyptan got
a lock-out.
Now the reason she gave to the Committee of Five
(cheap at 10 dollars) was that on her return from a
Delta Chi dance (hut she was with a Kappa Sig, this
is all so complicated I don't think I should go on.)
To continue: they decided to walk around Lake La
gunita, which is a body of water and pollywogs,
purely for geographical purposes. Now the Del
Eucalyptan s shoes became pinchy, so she took them
off. But when she came before the barricade at the
stroke of 2:.J0, she thanked her escort, and from the
top of her head to the tip of her toes she felt sin
cerely what she said to him, "Thanks for the swell
time." So sincerely was it, in fact, that she couldn't
get her shoes back on. Which caused the lockout.
So she put upon her lockout slip (now I hope I am
not boring you)- Excuse: Having awful time getting
tight shoes on. The Committee of Five (cheap at
$7.50) thought this was awful funny, and so did
Miss Anastasia Doyle, who said, "The last two words
are clearly redundant, void, and without significance
whatsoever. (Now I hope lam not boring you.)
