# Bull Session

It's funny, but Ex Committee is |
J not really funny.
Heaven knows#they try hard. |
i "More fun than a circus" is the time
: worn phrase applied by many a vis- j

itor to those
j Tuesday evening
I meetings, but
j somehow it's the
wrong connota
| tion. Seeing a
j circus is fun be
j cause the admit
| ted purpose of
j the performance
I is funster ing.
| Seeing an Ex
I Committee meet-
I ing is not quite so
! much fun because

buffoonery in government can't help !
j but be ironical.
* * *
And Ex Committee is the govern- |
i ment. Not a student, except fresh
-1 men who must have a year to get !
| over their high schoolish attitude
! that the business of student coun- '
cils is serious, is not represented by j
j some member of their own class. Ex
I Committee is the legislature, the j
\ judiciary, and the administration as I
well as the kingdom of Puck and
Oberon.
* * *
The gold that glitters in Wednes- ,
; day morning paper's headlines is not '
j always the gilt that characterizes
Tuesday evening meetings. "Split
j between Hall, Row 'Inevitable,' Ex ,
| Committee Decides." That was yes
i terday. Actually the committee de
-1 cided nothing. A report on "ma- j
j chine caucuses and dirty-politics" |
I was supposed to have been presented
J by an "investigating" committee. j
Instead the conclusions that three
out of five members of the special
| committee arrived at after an hour's 1
bull session were presented. There
j hadn't been any investigation, but
| because the cracks and the puns i
were getting stale and the chairs!
were getting hard, somebody moved
the report be accepted. "MSC-ed"
i as the secretary calls the frequent
rubber stampings of the committee.
On the books nevertheless the com
{ mittee came to the startling conclu- i

| sion that a Hall-Row split is inevi
! table. The fact that that was taken
i for granted, and that the students
might have expected the Ex Com
j mittee to do or recommend some
thing to make politics more orderly
j was ignored.
The chief characteristic of the
1 Tuesday meetings is diddling. They
! diddle over appointments, diddle
over awards, diddle over dates for
j house dances, and diddle over the
I minutes of entirely separate or
i ganizations. It might be called dis
{ cussion, but that would be conced
! ing a lot. This diddling consists
I chiefly of little person - to - person
, debates by members who won't ad-
I mit that they know not whereof they
{ .speak or of good - natured round
! table wrangles inspired by the be
-1 lief that one of the Committee
brethren or sisters foresees personal
j benefits.
It's funny to watch the "on their
! last legs" politicians and the "more
elections are coming up" politicians
in action, but the humor in what
| they accomplish and the way they
| accomplish it somehow falls flat.
