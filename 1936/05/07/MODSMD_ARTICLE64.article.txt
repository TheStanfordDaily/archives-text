The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me Bob Eisenbach has '
hit our Stanford women too hard in
his last article picturing them as
predatory creatures here only to
"get a husband." I doubt if this is
her only mutive in coming to Stan- j
ford, though it is a motive in the j
average girl's mind.
. . . Aren't we being a little con- j
ceited, Mr. Eisenbach, to think we
are the sole object of all this fem
inine energy?
Then, too, we musn't forget that
we men are on ihe lookout for a i
mate, though perhaps we may not
admit it.
Last of all, we must admit that j
predatory or not, the Stanford i
woman is up against tough obstacles ;
in getting a husband. The social i
code, with its laissez-faire jolly-ups j
and hotel-like women's dorms. And |
certain intangible attitudes and cus- ,
toms on this campus are also ob
stacles, such as the idea of spending
lots of money to have a good time.
Don't judge our women too harsh
ly, Mr. Eisenbach, they're not such
a bad bunch.
