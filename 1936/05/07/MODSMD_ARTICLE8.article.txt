# Union to Cash $5 Checks For Students
## Directors Vote To Carry Out Policy Through Last Week of Spring Quarter 
### 
The two-dollar check cashing re
gime in the Stanford Union and its
Encina cellar branch will end Mon
day when cashiers will be allowed to
' honor student checks for as much
j as $5.
Settling a controversy of several
j months' duration, the Union Board
i of Governors yesterday not only
j raised the check limit but eliminat
; ed the end-quarter period when no
j checks were honored. The latter
| provision is for a trial period only.
Proposed by Studeni Manager Bob
| Gros and seconded by Comptroller
I Roth, the motion was passed with-
I out a dissenting vote.
In spite of the fact that it will
[ involve additional bookkeeping and
; added expense, Roth explained, the
j cashing of larger checks is a service
i which the University owes the stu
! dents.
The board's decision concerning
j the end-quarter period reversed its
vote of last quarter when this
j change in policy was voted down.
