# Gros To Begin Budget Hearing
## Organizations To Submit Expense Statements 
### 
Convinced that student body funds
have never been equitably distrib
uted, Bob Gros, student manager,
I will next Monday begin a series of
! financial hearings with heads of
I campus organizations. Next year's
i A.S.S.U. budget will be based upon
' the findings of these hearings.
"I have a firm conviction that
i many student organizations have
| more money than they can use,"
Gros stated yesterday in explain-
I ing his reasons for calling the hear
| ings.
Accounts Sought
Gros plans to assign a separate
afternoon to each organization, when
they must submit a detailed state
ment of expenses for this year and
| last year and an estimate of next
j year's figure. The student manager
I will go over these estimates with the
j leaders of the organization.
Any proposed budget increase will
I have to be accompanied by a written
j statement justifying it. Gros hopes
| to make budget reductions where
| thye will not force curtailment of
| worthwhile student activities.
To Furnish Report
Gros plans to furnish each mem
ber of Ex Committee with a de
| tailed report of his findings one
' week before they must take action
i on the 1936-37 budget.
All interested students arc invited
|to attend the budget hearings.
Starting Monday, they will be held
every afternoon for ten days or two
; weeks. They will begin at 2 o'clock
in the Ex Committee room. Gros
j will announce dates for specific
! hearings tomorrow.

nl order to give more time to his
budget hearings, Gros during the
next two weeks will restrict his
afternoon office hours to from 1 to
2 o'clock.
