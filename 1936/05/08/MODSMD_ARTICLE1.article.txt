# Assembly Hall To Be Rebuilt, Turned Over To Business School
## 
### 
The interior of Stanford's Assem- J
bly Hall, wherein students have con
vened and world-famed artists have
performed since the founding of the j
University, will fall under the j
wrecker's hand when the new thea- j
ter is completed.
In its place will rise another unit j
of classrooms, offices, and miscella- â€¢
neous space which will be occupied
by an enlarged Graduate School of
Business.
These projects were virtually as
sured last night by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur at the close of a
series of conferences with Comp
troller Almon E. Roth on the feasi- !
bility of budgeting the work at the I
present time.
Date Unstated
The officials declined to set the j
date for starting operations, but in- j
dicated that nothing will be done j
until the half-million-dollar thea- j
ter unit is finished and ready for i
use. Roth estimated that time re
quired for the latter construction
will extend into the fall of 1937.
Remodeling will be necessary for '
the entire interior, contractors re- ;
port, because the present skeletal
form, including the under-floor base ;
support, is wood. The building will
be reinforced with steel and con
ciete.
Great Floor Space
Floor space of the renovated
structure, according to Dr. Wilbur, i
will be greater than ihe combined
areas in the English and Economics-
History building.
Dr. Wilbur indicated the decision
to turn over the Assembly Hail to
the Business School was not I
prompted by the recent establish
ment of a Division of Industrial Re
lations in the School, but it was j
understood that the new division
will utilize the facilities provided
by the re-built hall.
Details of the remodeling work
will be arranged soon at conferences
between Roth and Business School
executives.
