# Allow Disabled Zep To Fly Over France
## 
### 
Frosh political machinery jammed
over the proverbial monkey-wrench
late yesterday afternoon when rep
resentatives from 28 pledge classes
gathered together in the Quad to
i choose sophomore candidates.
Only results of the meeting were:
(1) Nominations were made for
Row nominations, and (2) a second
caucus to vote on nominated nomi
nees was proposed for same place—
room 112 A German corner — and
same time—4 o'clock—today.
Dekes, Gamma Phi's, Phi Psi's,
I Thetas, and Zetes were unrepresent-
I ed. Because half the represented
• houses sent more than their alloted
one delegate, caucus leaders found it
necessary to throw extras out in
I order to lessen filibustering.
The Row sophomore ballot stands:
President: Petty Fay, Phil Zonne.
| Ex .Committee member: Jim New
j ell, Roy Thompson, Dean Johnson,
Jack Laney, Bill Wilbur. Secretary
-1 treasurer: Jear* Reynolds, Jaytie
I Copp. Dollie Hyat.
