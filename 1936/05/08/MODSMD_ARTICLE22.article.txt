# Mixed Motions Frustrate Frosh

### 
As Washington State College stu
dents struck yesterday against their
administration's stringent "blue
laws," Farm leaders gave their opin
ion of why Stanford suffers no such
social crises.
Emphasized by the contrast of the
W.S.C. situation with that pre
vailing at Stanford, Comptroller A1
Roth declared:
"Student self-government here is
as liberal as at any other college.
Stanford amply warrants the confi
dence placed in it by the admin
istration."
Cites Self-regulation
The comptroller cited women's
lockout regulations, campus traffic
laws, and frosh rushing and hazing
rules as examples of self-imposed,
student restrictions.
"Such a strike as Washington's
would bo unnecessary and absurd at
Stanford," Bob Gros, student man
ager, said. "The need for such a
method of securing student equality
is largely obviated by the liberal at
titude of Dr. Wilbur, Dean Mary

[Yost, and Dean Culver, who prac-
I tice wh;tt they preach about allow
-1 ing Stanford students the maximum
i of freedom."
Charles Nathan Reynolds, pro
; fessor of sociology, asserted that
I "the students know the risks, and a
j mutual attitude of sense and rea
! son exists between them and the ad
ministration, which credits them
with mature minds and allows thorn
to act accordingly."
"No Danger Here"
"Stanford students are in no dan
! ger of a social impasse such us now
exists at Washington State because
here thr winds of freedom actually
blow," stated Jaqueline Flanders,
vice-chairman of Ex Committee.
"The University administration is
very lenient. The only friction re
sults from the strict disciplinary
measures imposed by the student
I elected officers of social control or
i ganizations. They tend to see the
worst side of every case, allowing
! little leniency for accident or spe
' cial circumstances."
