PRIMARIES
California proved herself defi- |
nitcly Democratic as 55 per cent of j
llie registered voters participated in
the primaries. The Pxesident's pri- j
mary total was greater by 20,013 j
than the combined votes of the two ;
Republican and two Democrat slates j
opposing him. To Roosevelt's single
handed total add the votes of Mc- j
Groarty and Sinclair because their
supporters will vote for the Presi
dent anyhow when the election takes
place, and the results are: Roose
velt, 928,466; Republicans (Warren
plus Landon), 587,951. Advantage: .
Roosevelt by 341,515 votes.
The victory of the Warren
group was significant of nothing
more nor less than California's
support of the regular state Re
publican machine, as Professor j
Grunt indicated.
Within Republican ranks (but
';nly within Republican ranks) Gov
ernor Landon is becoming a giant.
The Warren "free" delegation (which
TIME still definitely avers is Hoo
ver-controlled) with its 44 votes is
All's, so is South Dakota's eight.
He has 94 out of the 111 instructed
yotes from other states and an un
deniable influence over more than !
1 tall of the 552 uninstructed Repub- j
ican delegates already named. And j
t looks like he'll grow stronger day I
I jy day as this week Georgia (with j
4 votes), Idaho (8), Washington j
16), and the District of Columbia j
'.) hold their state conventions to j
i ame delegations.
