### 
Labor leaders and labor organiza
i ons are doing unprecedented things !
f olitically in the U.S.
William Green said Wednesday, I
American labor has been thrilled J
i y four years of President Roose- |
•It's inspired leadership." He urged i
I hor's support of Roosevelt. Thus |
ir the first time since 1924, when he |
i Limped for LaFollette, the No. 1 |
merican Federation Laborer is j
|. iblicly backing a presidential can- j
d date.

Grateful for the collective bar
' lining clause in the NRA, the Wag-
T Labor Relations Act, the Guffey
oal Act among other definite re
-111 s of Roosevelt's administration,
•c* United Mine Workers, American
de ration of Hosiery Workers, the
ennsylvania Federation of Labor,
•id the Amalgamated Clothing
/orkers have indorsed Roosevelt's
-election.
The labor votes pledged to the
President in New York, Pennsyl
vania, Ohio, and Michigan may
weight (lie balance enough in his
avor to carry those closely-fought
nit all-important key states. The
■ steel organizations carry more
than 1,150,000 votes.
Labor, though usually independ
il, has twice lined itself up with
/evidential aspirants. The A. F. of
. backed James M. Cox, Democrat
indidate in 1920. and Senator La
ollette won the indorsement of or
tnized labor in 1924, but both can
dates were overwhelmingly de
nted. Thus previous efforts to line
p labor have not been successful,
ut the Roosevelt labor policies have
-•en responsible for an enthusiasm
lat goes as far as breaking into
ther political units. For example,
)uvid Dubinsky, president of the
i iternational Ladies' Garment Work
is. recently resigned from the So
ialist party to join in the campaign
or Roosevelt's re-election.
President Roosevelt is single
landedly forming a new Democratic
jarty and it may get its greatest
strength from labor. Interesting to
jbserve is the fact that all of the
endorsements are for President
Roosevelt, and not for the Demo
cratic party.

President Roosevelt is single
