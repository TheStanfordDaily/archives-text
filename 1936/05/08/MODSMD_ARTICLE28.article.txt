# Swampum Picks 'Em Today For Manager Race
## 
### 
With caucuses complete except
for campaigning, here is scoop the
second:
Following are probable would-be
successors to the ever-efficient Bob
Gros as student manager:
Gib Holloway — Convalescent
Home Drive taker-inner and Men's
Council chairman.
Chuck . Fontius — perenially re
curring Quad business manager. He,
with Gib, seems lo have the isnide
track.
Rumor: That Fontius has sol
emnly pledged not to re-appoint
himself to his annual (can be taken
either way) job even if he loses out
to Holloway. (Unconfirmed.)
Jack Ellis—Glee Club manager—a
long shot to win.
Naomi Carpenter—Concert Series
manager—first woman with the te
merity to apply for the financial mo
gulship.
Since these pioneers, two more
applicants came in yesterday to de
lay the final decision, scheduled for
release then.
Chick Franich — Toro — Masque
Ball chairman—on Ex Committee—
he thought of "Swing your sweetie
to Tahiti."
Roy Anderson — Toro — Senior
Week chairman—on Ex Committee.
Only Masters could prophesy the
winner, but we pick Holloway or
Fontius as best bets.
And if Holloway gets it, what of
the graduate man post? If Masters
delays his announcement, will Hol
loway run for it? And if he wins
will he have to resign later, ne
cessitating a special election? Ditto
for Franich.
