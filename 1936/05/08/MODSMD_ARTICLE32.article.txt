### Hunter Hendee 
John Leavers isn't so very well |
j known to Stanford students, but he I
J should be. He's done more to build
up their school in the physical sense ;
i of the word than any other man.
!
It was 12 or 13 years back, as John
i recollects, that he began superin
| tending construction of our build
i ings. There were Encina Commons,
Toyon. Branner, the Press Building,
j and many others. Right now it's the
I new theater, and according to the
, boss—that's John again—it's going to
j be just about the last word in mod
ern construction.
Real Work Starts Monday
Today there are two carpenters,
three or four laborers, and a sur
veyor or two that work around the
"hole" caddy-corner from Encina.
But all that is going to be different
Monday, John grins—he wants the
real work to get under way!
The first shipment of steel girders
has already arrived, and more are
| expected daily. Then there will be
a swarm of steel constructors, and
after thai Stanford's new theater
will go up In a hurry.
Steel Jinxed
"Funny thing about that steel,"
John chuckles. "First it was the
j flood. Tied up everything around
! Pittsburgh—especially our girders,
j Then came the shipping strike just
i in time to delay the girders some
| more.
"When they finally were unloaded
I they got sent to the wrong places.
I A carload went to Berkeley. We
j found some of it in San Jose, and
; then there was a shipment of it clear
. ! down in San Pedro!"
