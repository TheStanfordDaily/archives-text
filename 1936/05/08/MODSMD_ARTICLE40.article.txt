Marriage or a career?
This is modern woman's choice
! when she determines her life's work
! and it is a choice which cannot be
compromised, Stanford women de
cided Wednesday night in a panel
j discussion conducted by Pi Lambda
! Theta, honorary education organiza
; tion.
Marriage without children is un-
I desirable in the eyes of young col
lege women, yet a career and chil
dren is not possible except in a few
adaptable artistic fields. Therefore,
women must give up one or the
other, and they must prepare for
that one.
For those who feel that marriage
J is to be preferred to the professions,
i it was decided that Stanford ought
I to offer courses in Home Economics
and Family Relations, as well as the
i law, medicine, and political science
offered the men.
Why come to Stanford, then, it
was asked. Other colleges include
| courses in dress-making and diet
etics in their curricula. Go there,
i But marriage should be more than
I mere housework, the Stanford
i women countered. They wish to be
I the mental equals of their husbands,
but they would like the opportunity
| of preparing for the relations of
J marriage at the same time they are
j getting their cultural background.
| Kor the few born careerists, Stan
ford's curriculum is satisfactory.
For those who wish to pursue the
career of marriage, it is not.

Much the same situation is met
by those women who wish to pre
j pare for jobs, either as stop gaps be
j tween sheepskin and wedding-bells
| or as permanent positions should a
• golden circle not materialize.
[ In a survey being made at present
to determine whether Stanford
graduates now in business feel that 1
their undergraduate courses were j
adequate, many women l-eplied that !
they would like to have had in- !
eluded secretarial training in their j
| college work.
I Knowledge of typing and short- j
| hand is a prerequisite to almost any ,
i business opening today. The panel j
! decided that much valuable time 1
| could be saved Stanford women if
I such training could be attained ;
; during their four college years.

Marriage or a career?
This is modern woman's choice
! when she determines her life's work
! and it is a choice which cannot be
compromised, Stanford women de
cided Wednesday night in a panel
j discussion conducted by Pi Lambda
! Theta, honorary education organiza
; tion.
Marriage without children is un-
I desirable in the eyes of young col
lege women, yet a career and chil
dren is not possible except in a few
adaptable artistic fields. Therefore,
women must give up one or the
other, and they must prepare for
that one.
For those who feel that marriage
J is to be preferred to the professions,
i it was decided that Stanford ought
I to offer courses in Home Economics
and Family Relations, as well as the
i law, medicine, and political science
offered the men.
Why come to Stanford, then, it
was asked. Other colleges include
| courses in dress-making and diet
etics in their curricula. Go there,
i But marriage should be more than
I mere housework, the Stanford
i women countered. They wish to be
I the mental equals of their husbands,
but they would like the opportunity
| of preparing for the relations of
J marriage at the same time they are
j getting their cultural background.
| Kor the few born careerists, Stan
ford's curriculum is satisfactory.
For those who wish to pursue the
career of marriage, it is not.
