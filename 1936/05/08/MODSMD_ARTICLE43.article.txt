A bouquet to Mercedes Bergman
for attempting to conciliate Hall and
; Row politics by sponsoring a nom
inating committee Wednesday after
noon. The practical results of such
a move may not be great, but the
j spirit was there. It can be done, no
j matter what Ex Committee may say.
Hall and Row are nasty words
around election time. No matter
where one lives, the other party
seems to be a big, black ogre, ready
to snap up all the available jobs and
i keep all next year's gravy.
The Hall and the Row do not ex
ist as such. The nine houses on
i Lasuen and Mayfield each include
j about 30 individuals. These women
j have many close friends in the hulls
I and vice versa. Likewise there is no
I such an entity as Lagunita, or Union,
I or Roble. The terms Row and Hall
! are merely convenient words, hav
j ing force only around Masque Ball
or election time.
Including representatives of Hall
j and Row, and activities heads, the
I committee on Wednesday endeav
j ored to nominate the best women for
| each office, irrespective of living
j groups. Lists of eligible women from
I the dean's office were used to elim
inate the possibility of overlooking

capable people.
Unfortunately Row and Hall cauci
are being held as usual. The recom
mendations of the nominating com
mittee will be valuable only as sug
gestions as to the most able women.
But it's a step in the right direc- j
tion.
