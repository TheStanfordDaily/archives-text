# Houses Accept Rush Change
## 
### 
The new rushing and bidding pro
gram formulated after several j
months' work by a Pan-Hellenic !
committee was definitely accepted
early this week as three houses
completed the list of eight approving
the program.
Delta Gamma, Alpha O, and Tri
Delt signified their unqualified ac
ceptance of the rules after a vote
taken in house meetings. Alpha Phi
accepted the program with certain
minor reservations which, however, J
will not impede the acceptance and j
use of the plan.
Every point which had been a '
source of any discussion in both
rushing and bidding rules was
thoroughly discussed by the com
mittee, and some sort of arrange
ment reached.
