Threa more interclass baseball
games were played this week with
the junior-senior team continuing to
dominate the scene. The whole "in
terclass set-up has more or less de
volved into a farce as practically
everybody has played on one of the
other teams at some time or an
other.
Three innings are the most that
are ever played and if the 5 o'clock
whistle blows before even these are
completed, the pitcher throws down
the ball, the batter drops her bat,
and all the fielders trot home com
placently. Real competitive spirit is
practically a minus quantity when
no group has a full team and has to
call upon the members of another
to complete its roster.
When the upperclassmen shut out
the Soph No. 1 team, 4-0, Ruth
Schmidt again pitched no-hit ball

! and allowed but one pass. Ger
i trude Polcar was too wild to be
| effective and Patsy Kennedy was no
! steadier; so most of the junior
i senior runs were unearned ones.
