# 'Learn To Act in Hollywood,' says Eddy
## 
### 
Young, blond, and straight from
Hollywood, Nelson Eddy, baritone,
will sing in the Stanford Pavilion
Wednesday, May 13.
Hero of "Rose Marie" and of
"Naughty Marietta," Eddy has writ
ten a success story in every musical
field from concert and opera to ra
dio and films, sequels to his original
work of writing obituaries for the
Philadelphia Press.
Movies "Curing Ground"
A film star now in his own right,
Nelson Eddy believes that "movies
are the curing grounds for operatic
hams." He says that he never real
ized how little he knew about acting
until he came to Hollywood.
Defending this position, the singer
explains that operatic artists live in
an atmosphere which is hide-bound
by tradition, and don't realize how
stale and stereotyped their per
formances are.
Teaches Finesse
"Of course there are personalities
in opera who could teach Broadway
and Hollywood a great deal," he
amended, "but no one after being in
the movies will ever think it's dra
matic to step downstage, extend his
arms in a grand sweeping gesture,
and bellow a high tone."
Tickets for the concert may be
bought at Koebie's in Palo Alto and
Ihe Concert Series office in the Old
Union.
