Trying out men from all strings,
| Coach Tiny Thornhill held scrim
j mage yesterday afternoon on the
! practice field. Gridders who have
j not been out for very long or have
; not been in scrimmages yet had a
; chance to show what they could do.
Bill Kirsch, freshman halfback,
' was the outstanding tackier in yes
j terday's scrimmage. Glenn Hamilton
J in the fullback position showed in
j creasing promise as a competent
I passer and ball-carrier.
J Wally DeWitt, star of the 1935
| frosh squad, was notable yesterday
j for his accurate passes from the full
j back post. At left half was Tom
Collins, who continued to stand out
: as a fast-moving back. Hank Glass
er did some excellent blocking and
j tackling in the right half post.
McMillan and Gustafson, playing
j next to each other at tackle and
i guard, respectively, showed fine in
terference in retaining a hole in the
â–  line. Dakin on the right flank looked
j good as a tackier.
Bob Mangan, brainy first-string
| tackle, sprained his ankle, and Dave
| Carnahan, another number one
i tackle, was out of practice with an
| injured chest.
The "Hawaiian diamond" ob
j tained by breaking open itioon-
I stones is not a true diamond.
