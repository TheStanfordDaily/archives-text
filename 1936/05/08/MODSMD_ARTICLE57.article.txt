BIG GAP BETWEEN
N.C.2-A. AND BERLIN FINALS
Now that the track, golf, and ten
nis teams have been prepared for
the wrapping, mailing, and sending
to national finals at Chicago, the
various pressure groups and their
subsidiaries can rest a bit and begin
figuring out a new issue to bark for.
Of course there is volley ball for
an intramural sport, grandstands '
for the wanting Angell Field—oh, !
oh. here's one—what are the hoys !
from out of the West going to do i
after the N.C.2-A. before the na- I
tional Olympics finals in New j
York three weeks later?
The N.C.2-A. track meet comes
June 19-20. The Olympics finals in
New York are set for July 10 and 11. '•
There are three weeks where the j
men from the West will be torn be- !
tween two horns of the dilemma, as j
it were. It would be foolhardy to i
ride back on the train after Chicago, i
then ride right back again in 10
days or so. Or it would leave the
temperamental track men in strange
parts for that period of time, with- j
out home coaching, for Dink would
probably come on home after Chi- j
cago.
And this is no drummed up
point, either, for champion ath- |
letes in the peak of condition and |
pointing for such an event as \
Olympics finals are as'nervous and j
as watchful of their training and I
workouts as race horses prepara- '
tory to a $100,000 stake.
GOOD MEET
lIFRE TOMORROW
With three Stanford track cap
tains and one future captain com
peting, a generous sprinkling of
Olympics contenders, and a closely
fought battle on the docket, it should
be a fine afternoon at Angell Field
tomorrow.
It is not very important which
team wins the meet. What will be
the main thing to watch is in
dividual improvements that will,
send some of the athletes winging
on their way to Berlin, or even
improvements that will send the
red Stanford banner a bit higher
in Conference, Fresno Relays, and
N.C.2-A. festivals.
Sammy Klopstock, Jim Reynolds, I
Phil Levy, Ray Dean, Chuck Nimmo, .
and Humbert Smith are six who are
pretty well set for places in the
conference meet and fine chances in j
the N.C.2-A. These are the old faith
ful veterans around whom you can !
mold a nucleus.
Interesting will be to see if the i
newer and more up-and-coming!
boys can place high in the big meets. J
Ed Burrows, Leo Madlem, Hank
Luisetti, Hunt Kingsbury, A1 Her
shey, Giff Myers, Jack Weiershauser, j
Bill McCurdy, Warren Dixon, Ray

Malott—these boys are the ones who
must come through to place later on.
IT IS INTERESTING to note the
showing Warren Dixon makes
every year. He looks awful all win
ter quarter, and the first part of the
spring, then is always good for
rounding into tip shape for the Big
Meet.
