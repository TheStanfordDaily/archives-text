# Trackmen Picked Over Winged Q's

By Phil Kluuhcr
With number and quality of
Olympic Club entries still an un
known quantity, Dink Templeton
doesn't see "how we can get less
than 7G points" in the Stanford-O.C.
dual meet on Angell Field tomorrow
at 2:15.
A1 Blackman, leading club quar
ter miier, turned up yesterday claim- ;
ing intestinal flu and won't run Sat- j
urday. Norm Bright, ace O.C. dis- j
tanee man, is highly desirous of i
running but one race.
Hurris with Club
But good tidings also come to j
Charley Hunter, Club mentor. Joe
Burris, who was third in the Big j
Meet hall-mile this year, has signed !
on with Hunter, while Bill Brown, j
former U.S.C. high hurdler, also
joined up.
Stanford heads too were held high â– 
after yesterday's practice. Jack j
Weiershauser ran a 220 in 21.3, while i
Ray Malott broke his personal rec- j
ord by taking 49.2 in the quarter.
Bill McCurdy is going to take ,
lessons from Ben Eastman in the
half mile, while Phil Levy vs. Dunn
and Hones, Humbert Smith vs. Wal
ter Marty, Wally Hardin, Johnny
Mottram, and Leo Madlem vs. Bob
Clark will all be something of the j
pupil-teacher relationship.
Sprints Look Easy
The sprints, with Ray Dean and '
Jim Kneubuhl, the hurdles, with
Captain Sam Klopstock and Hunt
Kingsbury, and the quarter, with
Weiershauser and A1 Cranston, look
easy meat for Stanford.
Jim Reynolds has real competi
tion in the shot from Dunn and Ray
Allee of the Club; Hershey might
come in for a place. General ad
mission tickets are 55 cents; students
will be admitted free with A.S.S.U.
cards. i

At the University of Akron stu
dents are fined 5 cents for being
late to classes.
