When the first curtain rises in the new thea
ter, the last curtain will have been rung down
in the old assembly hall. And it will be "the
assembly hall is dead, long live the assembly
hall," for workmen will move in to unseat the
drafty, antiguated auditorium and erect mod
ern class-rooms and offices to be used by the
Graduate School of Business.

Reasons why the Business School was
awarded the new space need not be explained
to anyone who ever went through the odorifer
ous atmosphere of the Biology building into the
dark, crowded space where the school is now
located. And more space will be imperative
next year when the new department of Indus
trial Relations is established.
Some may think that other schools or depart
ments have prior claim to new guarters. The
Lav/ School building, for example, is crowded,
dingy and wholly out of proportion with the
plane of work that goes on behind its doors. The
Law School, however, is not forgotten, and
when funds are available for a new off-Quad

building, a Law building undoubtedly will be
constructed.
The decision to give the assembly hall space
to the Business School is evidence of a policy
of the administration which is, to say the least,
commendable. The Graduate School was cre
ated by an endowment fund, but the endow
ment subseguently ran dry. At that point the
University assumed the financial burden of
the department, and now it shows its willing
ness not only to maintain it, but to develop it.
Stanford University, physically, is still young.
Although the Quad will probably always be the
center of academic activity, it will not always
be the near-entirety of it as at present. Other
buildings will rise to the west behind Seguoia
Hall and to the east around the library. The first
objective is to get graduate departments off-
Quad and leave the central buildings for un
dergraduate studies.
Rebuilding of the assembly hall and con
struction of the new theater is but a harbinger
of a more modern and better eguipped uni
versity.
The first assumption with every university
apparently is that its students are no more than
glorified high school pupils, and their conduct
must be rigidly controlled.
Stanford learned to trust her students early in
the University's life; Washington State seems to
have evolved to the point where the Pullman
officials probably will take this step.

officials probably will take this step.
When the first curtain rises in the new thea
ter, the last curtain will have been rung down
in the old assembly hall. And it will be "the
assembly hall is dead, long live the assembly
hall," for workmen will move in to unseat the
drafty, antiguated auditorium and erect mod
ern class-rooms and offices to be used by the
Graduate School of Business.

Reasons why the Business School was
awarded the new space need not be explained
to anyone who ever went through the odorifer
ous atmosphere of the Biology building into the
dark, crowded space where the school is now
located. And more space will be imperative
next year when the new department of Indus
trial Relations is established.
Some may think that other schools or depart
ments have prior claim to new guarters. The
Lav/ School building, for example, is crowded,
dingy and wholly out of proportion with the
plane of work that goes on behind its doors. The
Law School, however, is not forgotten, and
when funds are available for a new off-Quad

building, a Law building undoubtedly will be
constructed.
The decision to give the assembly hall space
to the Business School is evidence of a policy
of the administration which is, to say the least,
commendable. The Graduate School was cre
ated by an endowment fund, but the endow
ment subseguently ran dry. At that point the
University assumed the financial burden of
the department, and now it shows its willing
ness not only to maintain it, but to develop it.
Stanford University, physically, is still young.
Although the Quad will probably always be the
center of academic activity, it will not always
be the near-entirety of it as at present. Other
buildings will rise to the west behind Seguoia
Hall and to the east around the library. The first
objective is to get graduate departments off-
Quad and leave the central buildings for un
dergraduate studies.
Rebuilding of the assembly hall and con
struction of the new theater is but a harbinger
of a more modern and better eguipped uni
versity.
The first assumption with every university
apparently is that its students are no more than
glorified high school pupils, and their conduct
must be rigidly controlled.
Stanford learned to trust her students early in
the University's life; Washington State seems to
have evolved to the point where the Pullman
officials probably will take this step.
