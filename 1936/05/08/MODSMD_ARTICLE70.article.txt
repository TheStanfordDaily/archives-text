At Pullman, Washington State College stu
dents are holding a strike to repeal blue laws
and to secure more student faculty control of
campus affairs.
The 18th century natural rights doctrines and
the frontier ideals of democracy have appar
ently seeped into the northern campus to such
an extent that believe in the palliative of de
mocracy is strong enough to cause a strike.
These humanistic doctrines seeped into Stan
ford much earlier. Back in 1908, we had a Whis
ky Rebellion. Students struck in protest against
stringent faculty control of social regulations. A
liberalizing of control with an increase of stu
dent participation in government was instituted
under the leadership of present Comptroller
Almon E. Roth. The A.S.S.U. as we know it,
with its omnipotence over the petty affairs of
student government, was its final flowering.
Success of Stanford student control has rested
not so much on its actual accomplishments, but
in proving that students are capable of accepting
responsibility and in granting invaluable expe
rience in self-management to the Associated
Students.
