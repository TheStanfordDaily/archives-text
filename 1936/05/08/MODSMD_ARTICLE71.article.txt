(Editor's Note: Closing his series of comments
on local dramatic conditions, Mr. Prcndergast today
analyzes the changes the New Theater will make
in the local drama set-up.)

Waxing metaphorical before wc get personally
waxed for making dirty remarks, we point out that
you can't blame the actors for not making better
headway any more than you can blame the chap
taking his girl out in a Ford Model A roadster for not
being a success. There are so many things in the way
that he's licked before he starts. So arc the Farm
actors.
For one thing, there's the Assembly Hall. Try to
fly a set there and a shower of plaster pours down
on the stage. There's going to be a new theater costing
some $570,000. In 1!)37 the actors aren't going to have
the Assembly Hall to pass the buck onto. Everything's
going to be new, and then comes the revolution or
else the little man that's had a busy day is going to
die very dead and not many people are going to care
very much.

First of all, the University has to take over financ
ing the shows. As it is now student dramatic pro
ductions are forced to run competition to Marlene
Dietrich, Jean Harlow, and Carole Lombard—and these
ladies usually furnish irresistible as well as unfair com
petition. The Gaieties make money because half the
campus is in the show and the other half wants to see
them act or watch the chorus miss its turns. Conse
quently, the Dramatic Council has to pick shows that
exercise the actors' talents as well as being money
makers, and when a show with real guts as well as
box-office appeal (theoretically), such as "Paths of
Glory," draws only a faithful few followers, then
Dramatic Council has a right to sing the blues.
Speaking of picking plays, the Ex Committee once
tried their hand at it and got their ears well pasted
back. It was a put-up job, though, that they got
roped in on. A preliminary selection was made and
three smelly plays given to the committee for choice.
They picked the least odoriferous of the lot, "Hawk
Island," but it was still a terrific flop.

Furthermore, in the technicians' heaven that the
new theater is going to be, there had better be an
experienced technical director who hasn't an unholy
fondness for sets painted a bean-soup brown. Also
an electrician of ability.
And finally, there had better be a real school of the
theater. As it is now, actors rehearse five days a week
from 4 until (> in the afternoon and from 7 until 10
at night, with longer hours on week-ends. They get
no credit for it.
Why.' With a real school of the theater, the plays
should be chosen with less of an eye on the box-office
and more of an eye to how much it is going to teach
the actors. They needn't go hog-wild "arty" with
Greek Tragedy but they ought to have some sort of
a planned program that includes good satire, comedy,
tragedy—and Shakespeare.
Otherwise, for all the new theater, Stanford dra
matics are just going to furnish fodder for struggling
"Little Theater" groups in all the little towns with
never an actor for the legitimate stage. And if spare
time thespians are all that Stanford is going to turn
out, then the actors might as well slay in the Assembly
Hall and f'ot um'<l to s(i liming iiloiiii <ni m shoestring
