# How Important Will The Discrepancy Be?
## 
### 
Among the feelings which it apparently has
been the desire of the University to maintain
is that great contribution to statics known as
. the Hall-Row balance.
Particularly has this been most tenuously and
at great hazard and cost attempted in regard to
women, whose place, it seems, is no longer in
the house. At tremendous cost Lagunita Hall,
with its appeal to comfort and convenience, was
constructed.
The administrative agencies have attempted
to soft-pedal Hall-Row "feeling." The proper
i authorities were greatly shocked when last
year's Masgue BalL descended to sky-writing
and personalities. In the latest sally into wishful
thinking we have seen the rise of the Hall-Row
women's caucus.
Now arises a most singular discrimination
against Hall women, the denial by the Univer
sity itself of free or inexpensively regulated
, guest privileges in the dining halls. Will the
University, in light of its past policies, consider
this discrepancy important enough to remove
at an added expense, or will it try to gloss over
and ignore it by guoting statistics?
