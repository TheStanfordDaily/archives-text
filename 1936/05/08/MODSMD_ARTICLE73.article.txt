Some pronounce the word "Van Gogh"
To make it rhyme with kok.
While others say "Van Gogh"
Is made to sound like Prof.
The Dutchmen cannot go
To hear it said "Van Gogh."
Plainly, someone's out of focus.
And it's all a lot of Van Goghus-pocus.
The head sponsor in Encina was having a guest up
for the week-end, and wanted the guest to crash the
Chi P.si dance with him. But there was the difficulty of
getting the guest a tux. So they wandered down the
hall and located a frosh of about the right size and
proportions.
The frosh looked at the guest a bit dubiously and
seemed a bit reluctant to lend out his property. Finally,
however, he yielded, on the contingency that the guy
promise "not to get too drunk."
The guest was Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr.

Another story of a similar nature is about a guy
by the name of Eastman who used to do a lot of
running around Stanford, particularly after a gal in
the Kappa house.
It seems that Eastman was staying with the same
host in Encina, and got locked out of the room while
taking a shower. In the rough dry department he met
a frosh who, not recognizing the blonde blazer, lent
him a bathrobe and slippers, hospitably, but with no
particular enthusiasm.
When a room-mate pointed out that it was that
man whom one Pi Phi had once addressed as "God,"
the frosh tacked the slippers on the wall, declared
they were immortal.
In future times, when they have an excavation of
Encina in the year of the third sack of Roble. and so
forth, the archaeologists will find the slippers with
which a legendary giant ran the 880 in the amazing
time of 54-40 or fight, or maybe it was the broad
jump.
