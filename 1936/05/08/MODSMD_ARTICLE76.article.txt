The Editor, Sir:
And Mr. Eisenbach:
Of course we will have to admit
that "gunning for a groom," as you
so brutally call it, is our business; j
but indeed we will speak of it fur- j
ther. Stanford women are not such j
all-powerful and unmintigated hyp
ocrites as you seem to make us out !
to be. You have so offended out'
finer sensibilities that some few of
us feel driven to make a protest.
Most assuredly we want to get
married, eventually if not now. It is
our natural function; and as the :
Samoans say, "the inevitable con- ,
elusion." In spite of our biological
predestination, however, there is a
lot we expect to do in this world
besides washing dishes and being
loved.
In the first place there is that
bitter truth that whether we are ,
married or not we have to live with i
ourselves all our lives. When you
live with one person for a long time, I
it is likely to become dreadfully bor
ing unless that person happens to be
rather interesting. Coming to Stan
ford is just our simple way of mak
ing ourselves more easy to live with.
In the second place we want to
"gun" for men that at least equal
us in intellectual capacities. Now if .
men married us merely for our sex- i
ual functions, as you implied, col- 1
lege would indeed be a waste of
time; but even yr>u admitted that i
we should be companions and critics
too. In order for us to be that we
certainly need a broader back
ground than a knowledge of cook
ing and sewing affords.
