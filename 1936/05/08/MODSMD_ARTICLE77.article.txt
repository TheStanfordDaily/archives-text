A rationalistic male, taking up the |
women's torch in a Vox Campi,
points to the narrow fairways and
deep sandtraps in the Farm lassies'

flight to romance.
"Th e Stanford
woman," he says,
"is up against
tough obstacles
in getting a hus
band."
To which we
reply, "Brother,
you is all wet."
For Sympathet
ic Rough, as our
contributor signs
himself, has been
so busy looking at

the administrative trees that he has
lost sight of the administrative for- |
est. We mean he Ls so busy con
sidering the few obstacles Stanford
places in the way of the aspiring ;
female, such as lockouts, jolly-ups,
and hotel-like dormitories (a mis
nomer), that he hasn't even noticed
the many tremendous advantages a
Stanford woman has in the rat-race j
of romance.

Looking at the University's official i
social opportunities, we find they |
are designed not to handicap the i
popular girl 4 , but to give all the ;
women a chance to get acquainted, j
and from there on in to help the i
unpopular girl. No one of Stan--.
ford's more notable honeys has i
dinged herself at jolly-ups, despite
the fact that they are the most regi
mented kind of romantic modus op
erandi.

The lockouts. Well now, there is
something. A lockout isn't made to
protect anyone. It seems to cater
exclusively to the parental notion
that nothing can happen before 2:30
but that hell breaks loose and repu
tations go boom at 2:31 and after.
Silly? Of course it is. But just
try to smash the stereotype that
women should be herded in and out
of compounds at specific hours un
til they have a compound of their
own.

Now, lockouts and jolly-ups are
just two of the things a woman
raddled place like New Stanford has
to worry about. But they can hardly
be considered serious obstacles in
the presence of the many more

I subtle advantages the University of
fers.
Foremost among these is the fact
that Stanford is designed for the

playfully romantic, not the fired-up
student in love with ideas first and
women second.

Number two is the class of people
—all with so much in the bank or
more: all socially top-cream, the
milk being what it is.
Third are the remarkable facili
ties—the scenery, the obliging spring
moon and the obliging trees for it i
to shine through, the golf course, !
the nooks and crannies at a minute's
reach with a gallon of gas.
Antony and Cleopatra would have
found Ihem quite adequate, definite
ly overbalancing the deplorable if j
necessary conventions of lockouts, :
jolly-ugs, etc.

We sincerely hope the tears of
Sympathetic Rough were crocodile,
for we have seen off-campus gals,
working for a living and just as
self-respecting as you please, moan
ing enviously at the opportunities of
Stanford women.
Why, the gals on the other side of
the tracks even think Stanford men
are all right!
