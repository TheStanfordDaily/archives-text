# Indians Beat Olympic Club By 11 Points
## Dunn, Levy Take Discus; Marty in Top Condition; Mottram, Reynolds Win 
### Jane Heenan 
It looked pretty bad for a while.
It seemed quite possible that the
track meet might end with the
Olympic Club a one-point victor.
But Phil Levy and Hugh Gribben
and the relay team changed all that,
and Stanford came out on the long
end of a 71-GO score.
When the score stood 60-57, only
the discus throw remained among
the field events. The Olympians had
just completed a shutout in the pole
vault, amassing nine points right
there. Rumors filtering over to the
bleachers had it that both Slinger
Dumi and Levy had gone over 165
feet, and sure enough, when the
official distances were announced
Levy had won the event with a toss
of 165 feet 9 inches. Two inches
behind was Dunn with a mark of
165 feet 6 3 4 inches, while Gribben
came in a surprise third. Here were
the six points which cinched the
meet for the Cards.
Marty Goes To Town
But this was only one of the
events. Walter Marty, the flashy
Fresno high jumper, came within
three-eighths of an inch of tieing
his world record, set at Angell Field
two years ago. Humbert Smith of
Stanford kept right with Marty up
to 6 feet 5% inches, when the going
became too tough for him, and left
the lanky Walter to clear 6 feet 8%
Inches successfully. Marty then
tried for a new world's mark of 6
feet 9% inches, which he barely
missed in his three attempts.
There were other sparkling per
formances in Saturday's heat ses
sion. Ben Eastman didn't look bad
in the 880 —not bad at all, when he
ran his competitors into the ground
in 1:52.9, fastest time on the Coast
this year. Big Ben seemed the old
flash of former years in the half
mile, and MeCurdy of the Indians
made it interesting for him over the
whole route.
Warren Dixon pulled a surprise—
and a thrill—when he nosed out
Norm Blight in a beautiful finish to
the one mile. Chuck Nimmo's ab
sence wasn't too badly felt when
Dixon put on a last minute sprint to
take the event from Bright in the
fast time of 4:21.8.
Mottram, Reynolds Win
Johnny Mottram of the Club
showed that he will make a serious
bid for a round trip to Berlin when
he tossed the javelin well past the
211-foot mark. Miller and Friedman
gave Coach Charley Hunter four
more points and made a complete
sweep of this event for the Olym
pics.
Sammy Klopstock was the only
double winner, taking both hurdles
rather easily. Other good perform
ances included Leo Madlem's run
ning broad jump of 23 feet 5 inches,
and the tie for first place in the pole
vault by Jack Maugher and George
Varoff at the very respectable height
of 13 feet 10 inches. Kneubuhl beat
cut team-mate Dean in a slow 100,
and George Weiershauser proved he
could negotiate the sprints when he
copped the 220.
