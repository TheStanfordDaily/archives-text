# Fund Amendment To Go To Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 f/P). â€”
Congressmen seeking funds for
public works projects turned to the
Senate tonight as the battle ground
of a new effort to amend the $2,364,-
000.000 deficiency bill after having
met a crushing defeat in the House.
The House will vote finally on
the bill tomorrow, but that wll ebi
a mere formality. All attempts to
earmark any'of the $1,425,000,000
carried in it for Secretary Ickes'
PWA were beaten down last Friday
and leaders said the measure would
be sent to the Senate tomorrow
without change.
