# Roble Women To Have New Sponsor Plan
## System Cuts Out Corridor Chairmen; Committee To Pick Junior Advisers 
### 
A new Roble sponsor set-up,
worked out by the committee on
women's sponsor direction, will take
effect next year, stated Mercedes
Bergmann, chairman of Women's
Conference, yesterday.
Under the new plan there will be
only 20 upperclassmen to swing the
whole business of managing the
freshman women's hall. Twelve
seniors, 11 of whom will serve as
sponsors and one as president, will
live in the hall for two quarters, as
in the present plan.
No Corridor Chairmen
Instead of the present sophomore
corridor chairmen, eight junior
sponsors, living in Roble for one
quarter only, will aid the seniors.
After autumn quarter, they will turn
over a number of. their routine du
ties, such as committee work and
maintenance of quiet hours, to
freshman women, thereby giving
them a greater degree of self-gov
ernment than they have enjoyed
heretofore.
The positions of vice-president
and secretary-treasurer will be giv
en to freshmen at the end of autumn
quarter, if these offices are filled by
junior sponsors in the first place.
Prc-Rcgistration Will Help
"If the administration establishes
pre-registration guidance for en
tering freshmen, the new system will
be greatly facilitated, as the tasks of
the sponsor will be lightened,"' Miss
Bergmann declared.
The plan was decided on after
careful consideration by the direc
tors of the women's halls and the
committee on sponsor direction,
composed of the five members of
Women's Council, the head sponsors
of Roble and the Union, the presi
dent of Lagunita, and the president
of Women's Conference, who acts as
chairman.
