# Pelton Beats Grover In Hall Nomination For Vice-President
## Original Caucus Declared Unrepresentative; New Women's Meeting Held 
### 
Further complications developed
in the already complex political sit
uation this week-end when Esther
Pelton supplanted Betty Grover as
Hall nominee for vice-president of
the A.S.S.U., following a second,
representative caucus held by the
unaffiliated women in the Wom
en's Clubhouse Friday night.
The Union and Roble women, who
felt that the slate chosen at the first
Hall caucus, held at Lagunita
I Thursday, was not representative of
them, requested the second caucus.
Upset Expected
! The Pelt on-Grover upset was not
, so unexpected as might be imagined,
I as Betty Grover won out Thursday
| night only by a slight margin.
! Meredith McCubbin, who opposed
i her in the Lagunita caucus, polled
I only two less votes than the Ex
Committee woman. Pelton's name
j was not brought up at the time, bo
j cause it was understood that she did
j not care to run for the office.
In a preliminary meeting held at
! Lagunita before the clubhouse
! caucus, Pelton announced her candi-
I dacy for the vice-presidency. Be
-1 fore instructing their delegates how
! to vote, the Lagunita women re
| opened the nominations for vice-
I president and Esther Pelton's and
Betty Grover's names were sug
j gested. A vote was taken, and Pel
| ton won by an overwhelming ma
jority.
Support Pelton
The six Lagunita delegates were
i then instructed to support Pelton
I and the remaining nominees elected
; the night bofore. They were also
! instructed to compromise with the
I other halls in the event that Roble
; or Union wished to substitute one of
their residents for a Lagunita candi
date. The five representatives of
Union, Roble's four, and the one
delegate from the Oaks were un
instructed.
! Besides the exchange of Pelton
; for Grover, the clubhouse delegation
| made several other changes on the
| Hall ticket. Martha Jane Peairs was
| chosen to run for senior woman on
iEx Committee, Doris Clayburgh
j will run for vice-president of the
; senior class, and the names of Luigi
| Schmid and Maxine Moore were
i added to the nominees for Women's
' Council. Barbara Sweet declined to
run for secretary-treasurer of the
j senior class against Dick Bibbero,
I Hall men's choice.

unaffiliated women in the Wom
en's Clubhouse Friday night.
The Union and Roble women, who
felt that the slate chosen at the first
Hall caucus, held at Lagunita
I Thursday, was not representative of
them, requested the second caucus.
Upset Expected
! The Pelt on-Grover upset was not
, so unexpected as might be imagined,
I as Betty Grover won out Thursday
| night only by a slight margin.
! Meredith McCubbin, who opposed
i her in the Lagunita caucus, polled
I only two less votes than the Ex
Committee woman. Pelton's name
j was not brought up at the time, bo
j cause it was understood that she did
j not care to run for the office.
In a preliminary meeting held at
! Lagunita before the clubhouse
! caucus, Pelton announced her candi-
I dacy for the vice-presidency. Be
-1 fore instructing their delegates how
! to vote, the Lagunita women re
| opened the nominations for vice-
I president and Esther Pelton's and
Betty Grover's names were sug
j gested. A vote was taken, and Pel
| ton won by an overwhelming ma
jority.
Support Pelton
The six Lagunita delegates were
i then instructed to support Pelton
I and the remaining nominees elected
; the night bofore. They were also
! instructed to compromise with the
I other halls in the event that Roble
; or Union wished to substitute one of
their residents for a Lagunita candi
date. The five representatives of
Union, Roble's four, and the one
delegate from the Oaks were un
instructed.
! Besides the exchange of Pelton
; for Grover, the clubhouse delegation
| made several other changes on the
| Hall ticket. Martha Jane Peairs was
| chosen to run for senior woman on
iEx Committee, Doris Clayburgh
j will run for vice-president of the
; senior class, and the names of Luigi
| Schmid and Maxine Moore were
i added to the nominees for Women's
' Council. Barbara Sweet declined to
run for secretary-treasurer of the
j senior class against Dick Bibbero,
I Hall men's choice.
Further complications developed
in the already complex political sit
uation this week-end when Esther
Pelton supplanted Betty Grover as
Hall nominee for vice-president of
the A.S.S.U., following a second,
representative caucus held by the
unaffiliated women in the Wom
