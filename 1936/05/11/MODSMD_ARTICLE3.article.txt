# Women Rule Daily as Men Pay To Enter
## 
### 
The clicks of high-heels, fem
inine voices and laughter, were
uninterrupted except by loud mas
culine guffav/s from onlookers
last night. The women ruled the
Daily shack as they put out the
semi-annual women's edition.
How to write Bull Session?
First get the proper atmosphereâ€”
"try a pipe," suggested one in
genious lass. No pipe was found,
so the feminine Bull Sessioner
struggled on without its dubious
inspiration.
Major moan was, "Oh, if only
they would do something about
these terrible chairs! Look at the
run in my stocking!"
As a man entered, all the
femmes pounced upon him to col
lect his dime. No masculine foot
could step into the sanctuary
without paying 10 cents admis
sion. Proceeds went toward a party
for women only at 11 o'clock.
