ROOSEVELT:
Roosevelt is steadily gaining pop
ular approval. The American Insti
tute of Public Opinion's monthly
straw vote shows that the presi
dent's popularity has jumped from
54.5 per cent to 54.0 per cent for May,
a small increase but a significant
one. The figure lacks only four
points of reaching the landslide ma
jority the Democrats received in
I!KJ2.
The Rooseveltian majority has
been slowly creeping upward since
December, In five consecutive polls
conducted by the Institute of Pub
lic Opinion, each individual gain
lias been small, but steady. "Elec
tion majorities rise with prosperity,"
PAsident McKinley once remarked.
REPUBLICANS:
The G.O.P. can still beat Roose
velt if the delegations select a strong
enough candidate at Cleveland next
month or if the party secures about
'{09,000 votes in 11 key states before
November.
Ohio. New Jersey, Maryland, In
diana, lowa, South Dakota, Nebras
ka, New Yoik, Michigan, Idaho, and
Wyoming are the "borderline" states
which show a slight Democrat tend
ency, but which the Republicans
may win ovei\
Together with Colorado, Kansas,
Illinois, and Connecticut, these 15
states can account for almost 15
million voters, enough to swing the
ntire election. Republican attack
will probably center around them.
I ROM F. D. R.
And with all the election turmoil,
President Roosevelt found time to
.send five porcelain donkeys, squat
ting on their haunches and tooting
.saxophones, to the National Hobby
Show in Washington.
NEW EMPEROR:
Mussolini has finally revived the
"Roman empire." With formal an
nexation of Ethiopia and the proc
lamation of Victor Emmanuel as
King-Emperor,' II Duce has put
Ilaly on the map with * the same
status as that of Great Britain.
The British are now both despond
ent and confused. British prestige,
Ethiopia, and the League of Na
tions have received telling blows.
Question: If Mussolini becomes in
spired to add a few more Mediter
ranean lands to the empire, what
course can the Foreign Office in
London take?
British opinion is at present
against starting another war to save
the Ethiopians or anyone else; and
ihe League of Nations has shown
that the important Article XVI in
the Covenant, which authorizes the
use of force in carrying out sanc
tions, is ineffective. â€”Loud
