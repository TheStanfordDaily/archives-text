CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May
10 l/P|—Amy Johnson Mollison, who
set a record last week for a solo
flight from England to Cape Town,
took off today for London on the
return trip. She hopes to break an
other record on the flight back.

Justice of the Peace F. Patch, of
Lowville, N.Y., used a coffin 15 years
as a couch—"to get used to it," he
said. He was buried in it to fulfill a
deathbed wish.
