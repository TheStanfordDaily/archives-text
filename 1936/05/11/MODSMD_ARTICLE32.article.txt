# League Session May Continue War Sanctions
## Smaller States Wait For Britain, France To Take Lead in Present Crisis 
### 
GENEVA, May 10 (/P).—A belief
that sanctions would be continued
despite Italy's annexation of Ethiopia
was generally thought on the eve of
a crucial session of the League of
Nations Council.
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
and his British colleagues re
mained coldly non-committal.
Smaller states of Europe, how
ever, were plainly alarmed over the
possible repercussions of Premier
Mussolini's seizure of a League state.
They expressed loyalty to the League
but are waiting for France and Brit
ain to take the leadership in the
present crisis and to .save the League,
to which they cling because they
themselves have no mighty fleets or
armies.
Geneva was stirred by a report—
denied by the Italian spokesman —
that Italy would seek a way out by
giving Ethiopia a status similar to
that of India and that Ethiopia would
continue her League membership,
under the protection of the king of
Italy.
A feature of this report was that
Italy would put forward a substitute
Ethiopian delegate to Geneva, hand
picked by Rome.
