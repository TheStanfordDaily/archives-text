# HASHER'S CAUCUS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: . I
The sophs have met and had their'
caucus. The Row has met and done
likewise, the Halls have come to
gether and done ditto. Obviously
these meetings can have no real ef
fect because the division of the stu
dents into classes and living groups
has no bearing on their veal inter- <
ests as students. The world is po- i
Htically divided into those who have
and those who have not. On our
campus we have those for whom
father writes the checks and as a
result they feel free to vote for new j
theaters, to underwrite Concert Se- j
ries, and to pay up Dramatic Coun- !
cil deficits. Wo also have those who |
in part foot their own bills; who .
would like to see the Associated
Students' share of the $115 reduced, j
who would like the cost of every- !
thing frorh Union coffee to admission j
at basketball games knocked off.
The only way to accomplish econ
omy on the campus is for those so '
interested to unite. Therefore this '
writer believes that instead of out
present Hall-Row-Sophomore meet- |
ings there should be a HASHERS' !
CAUCUS at which all those who toil
should unite their efforts to secure >
economy in student government.
Realizing that he has become old and !
enfeebled through many years of
gravy serving the undersigned will j
not attempt to campaign himself but j
calls on the HASHERS to lalk the •
campaign up to the end that a time
and place may be set for the HASH
ERS' CAUCUS at which candidates
for the ECONOMY ticket may be
chosen.
Temporary headquarters will be
the end table in the Reference Room
of the Libe.

The Editor, Sir:
Dramatics have come to a pretty
pass indeed, if the form of publicity
attempted by the column in yester
day's paper is any criterion. Since |
when has it been necessary to ad- |
vertise a play by strongly alleging 1
that the male parts are taken by j
males? '

Or is Mr. Prendergast a friend of j
the gentlemen he mentions as MEN, j
with every wish to make what he
fears is an uncertain quality in
them, a fact in public belief? Or is
this a thin attempt to woo the ladies j
to the theater?

The Editor, Sir:
Dramatics have come to a pretty
pass indeed, if the form of publicity
attempted by the column in yester
day's paper is any criterion. Since |
when has it been necessary to ad- |
vertise a play by strongly alleging 1
that the male parts are taken by j
males? '

Or is Mr. Prendergast a friend of j
the gentlemen he mentions as MEN, j
with every wish to make what he
fears is an uncertain quality in
them, a fact in public belief? Or is
this a thin attempt to woo the ladies j
to the theater?

The sophs have met and had their'
caucus. The Row has met and done
likewise, the Halls have come to
gether and done ditto. Obviously
these meetings can have no real ef
fect because the division of the stu
dents into classes and living groups
has no bearing on their veal inter- <
ests as students. The world is po- i
Htically divided into those who have
and those who have not. On our
campus we have those for whom
father writes the checks and as a
result they feel free to vote for new j
theaters, to underwrite Concert Se- j
ries, and to pay up Dramatic Coun- !
cil deficits. Wo also have those who |
in part foot their own bills; who .
would like to see the Associated
Students' share of the $115 reduced, j
who would like the cost of every- !
thing frorh Union coffee to admission j
at basketball games knocked off.
The only way to accomplish econ
omy on the campus is for those so '
interested to unite. Therefore this '
writer believes that instead of out
present Hall-Row-Sophomore meet- |
ings there should be a HASHERS' !
CAUCUS at which all those who toil
should unite their efforts to secure >
economy in student government.
