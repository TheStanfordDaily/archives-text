# WOMEN ARE FINE
## 
### 
1 The Editor, Sir:
I The person who said, "Four out '
of five women are pretty and the j
other went to Stanford" was surely |
mistaken. There might be two or
three who wear horn-rimmed
glasses, are six feet-four tall, and â€¢
come to school for work only, but I !
have been unable to find them. The
| motion picture industry is looking
| forward to the graduation of many,
of our famous women because of
! beauty alone. The women here don't
| go to football and basketball games
I to show of! their new clothes; they
Igo because the team needs their
I support.
Stanford women are good sports.
| One girl actually condescended to
| ride in a model A Ford. The car was
an awful thing; it needed washing,
| had no air horn, or not even a radio.
| The success of her escort, a Stanford
i nobody, spurred him on to greater
heights. He finally got this girl to go j
j up to the city in this ghost of a car.
I Unconfirmed report floated back ]
that .she had a good time and was not I
] embarrassed by the car.
Yes, Stanford women are fine.
