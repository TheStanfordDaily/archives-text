Your so-called investigator has !
j made several errors, most of which |

since ho is talking about ihe state of
the drama and the readings given
on the campus, he might come some
where near the truth.
The readings which he praises as
the best work of Sword and San
dals were the creation of the sissies
he lists; tht>y came to their greatest
success as fields for bringing out new
talent and giving satisfactory shows
under the sissies he lists. "Let 'Em
Eat Cake," which packed the rafters,
was given by the sissies he lists.
Under Clark, Garred, Benet,
O'Neill, and Dawson, ihe readings
have brought in no outstanding new
material. Palo Alto people, always
' the greater parts of the audience for
' these readings, have ceased to come
: to the ill-rehearsed, droning per
