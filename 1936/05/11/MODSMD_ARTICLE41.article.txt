# Solon Outlines Inside Story Of Frosh Caucas
## Pledge Organizing Done By Newell, Neely, Taggart; Fontius Manager 
### Solon O. Swampum 
Freshmen may be new to the
i Farm, but they evidently come witli
an ample supply of political canni
ness.
Steve Taggart, Phi Delt to be,
shows all indications of being a po
l litical organizer from way-back. He
j called the frosh caucus; he lined up
| his own private machine; and he al
j most succeeded in putting it
j through in most machine-like order.
Jim Newell, Alpha Delt, was main
opposition, with Kappa Sig's Guy
I Neely ranking second. Newell, after
| being coached by an enterprising
| older Alpha Delt as to the devious
I details of politics, almost succeeded
| in putting through a machine of his
| own.
He was stymied in the first caucus
j by a four-way tie which neither
would break. He managed, glee
fully, to get Pete Fay in as presi
dent in the final caucus; but lost to
Roy Thompson himself for the Ex
j Committee position.
Three unpredictable events cast a
i pall of gloom over the would-be
J caucus whippers. Little could New
j ell foresee that the tardily-entering
| D.G. representative would break the
15-15 deadlock to decide all three
I positions. Or that the Pi Phi's would
| cast the wrong vote for their Tri
Delt proxy ballot. Or that the Thetas
would play both ends against the
middle, promise support to all con
i cerned, and win in spite of it.
Swampum is reluctant to act as
! prophet. But Swampum is still will
| ing to cover all bets against Chuck
I Fontius for the student manager
i ship. Holloway still ranks as
j strongest contender. Master knows,
; but Masters won't tell which is
chosen.
I
I
Not absolutely in control of the
I Row caucus, but still a broad jump
ahead of everyone else, is the com
bine of Zete, Sigma Chi, Phi Delt,
Kappa Sig, and Delt. Maybe their
monopoly is due to their strong can
didates this year. Maybe it's because
they are all strong houses polit
ically. But the fact remains that
they walked away with most of the
Row nominations this year — Rey
nolds, D'Evelyn, Killefer, and Wil
liams. Please note, Toros!

Not absolutely in control of the
I Row caucus, but still a broad jump
ahead of everyone else, is the com
bine of Zete, Sigma Chi, Phi Delt,
Kappa Sig, and Delt. Maybe their
monopoly is due to their strong can
didates this year. Maybe it's because
they are all strong houses polit
ically. But the fact remains that
they walked away with most of the
Row nominations this year — Rey
nolds, D'Evelyn, Killefer, and Wil
liams. Please note, Toros!
Freshmen may be new to the
i Farm, but they evidently come witli
an ample supply of political canni
ness.
Steve Taggart, Phi Delt to be,
shows all indications of being a po
l litical organizer from way-back. He
j called the frosh caucus; he lined up
| his own private machine; and he al
j most succeeded in putting it
j through in most machine-like order.
Jim Newell, Alpha Delt, was main
opposition, with Kappa Sig's Guy
I Neely ranking second. Newell, after
| being coached by an enterprising
| older Alpha Delt as to the devious
I details of politics, almost succeeded
| in putting through a machine of his
| own.
He was stymied in the first caucus
j by a four-way tie which neither
would break. He managed, glee
fully, to get Pete Fay in as presi
dent in the final caucus; but lost to
Roy Thompson himself for the Ex
j Committee position.
Three unpredictable events cast a
i pall of gloom over the would-be
J caucus whippers. Little could New
j ell foresee that the tardily-entering
| D.G. representative would break the
15-15 deadlock to decide all three
I positions. Or that the Pi Phi's would
| cast the wrong vote for their Tri
Delt proxy ballot. Or that the Thetas
would play both ends against the
middle, promise support to all con
i cerned, and win in spite of it.
Swampum is reluctant to act as
! prophet. But Swampum is still will
| ing to cover all bets against Chuck
I Fontius for the student manager
i ship. Holloway still ranks as
j strongest contender. Master knows,
; but Masters won't tell which is
chosen.
