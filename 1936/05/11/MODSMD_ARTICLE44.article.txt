# Dawson Heads Capable Cast In 'June Moon'

Once more the local boy makes
good, this time as a writer of lyrics
for popular songs, and again he Is
served from the wiles of a gold
digger by an innocent young thing.
Trite as this plot seems in bare
outline, clever writing by Ring
Lardner and George S. Kaufman and
clever acting by an experienced,
competent cast made "June Moon,"
Friday night's Dramatic Council
presentation, amusing and enjoy
able.
Dick Dawson as the gawky Fred
Stevens made the most of an en
viable part. Perfectly ill-at-ease,
ungrammatical, naive, he gave a
punch to all his lines. Fred Clarke
also gave a line performance as
Paul Sears, the earnest, hopeful song
wirter who once wrote a successful
song called "Paprika, Paprika, the
Spice of My Life."
Jean Albertson's portrayal of Lu
cille, Paul's disillusioned wife, v/i\s
sincere and sympathetic. France.s
Reeder as her hard, grasping sister
has a difficult part, and she fell into
the easy error of over-playing it.
Although there may be women as
mercenary as her Eileen, I doubt it,
Janet Dole was pleasing as the
vapid Edna, and Bob Garred, Fran
ces Farmer, Jack Beaty, Edmunds S.
Burnett, Bill Goldner, Donald Carr,
and Rosemary Benet rounded out a
good cast.
The chief criticism that might be
made of the play was that it drag
ged considerably in spots, although
this was not necessarily the fault of
the cast. The student arranged
music, which was played up con
siderable in the advance publicity,
was a little disappointing.
