EASTMAN OUTFOXES
LOS ANGELES CYNICS

The die-hards were at it again j
last week and once again they were j
wrong. After Troy smeared the |
Olympic Club in the Coliseum, the I
wise boys discussed Ben Bangs !
Eastman, and they settled his case J
out of court. The old Eastman speed
was missing. He never showed that
form which led him to so many stir- |
ring undergraduate victories and to j
a world's championship in the 440.
Saturday, for the first time since ;
he started his comeback, Eastman I
tried some real running in the half I
mile. And he refuted all the bleach- |
er coaches by turning a 1:52.9 880 —
two seconds better than he did
against U.S.C., and the mast cred
itable showing on the Coast this
year at that distance.
Big Ben seemed to lope along with
that same long, easy stride that has
constantly amazed the track world. ,
Without extending himself, he cov
ered the distance yards ahead of the I
field.
There is no doubt but that East
man should win a berth on the i
Olympic team this year. He once
more looms as one of the most re- !
liable point winners for the U.S. |
team. With a game leg and two |
years of inactivity behind him, East
man has again proved that he has
all the earmarks of a thoroughbred, j

S.F. PREP STARS
SHOW UP WELL

Two prep stars also did right well
for the Olympic Club in Saturday's
meet. Young George Varoff, former
Balboa High pole vaulter and holder
of the San Francisco high school
record, went up to 13 feet 10 inches
in tieing for first place with Jack
Maugher. He looks capable of doing
14 feet and is definitely Olympic
Games material.
In the two-mile, Ed Preston, dis
qualified at Commerce, ran a fast
race against good competition and
placed third in this event. Both
Preston and Varoff will undoubtedly
improve and much should be heard
of them in the future.

MARTY NEARLY BREAKS
OWN RECORD

And that veteran of high jump-*
ers, Walter Marty, gave conclusive
evidence that he will lie right there
in first place when the high jump
event is concluded this summer in
Germany. Coming within three
eighths of an inch of his own world's
record of G feet 9V 8 inches, Marty
showed that he is capable of break
ing the mark he set two years ago.

more looms as one of the most re- !
liable point winners for the U.S. |
team. With a game leg and two |
years of inactivity behind him, East
man has again proved that he has
all the earmarks of a thoroughbred, j

S.F. PREP STARS
SHOW UP WELL

Two prep stars also did right well
for the Olympic Club in Saturday's
meet. Young George Varoff, former
Balboa High pole vaulter and holder
of the San Francisco high school
record, went up to 13 feet 10 inches
in tieing for first place with Jack
Maugher. He looks capable of doing
14 feet and is definitely Olympic
Games material.
In the two-mile, Ed Preston, dis
qualified at Commerce, ran a fast
race against good competition and
placed third in this event. Both
Preston and Varoff will undoubtedly
improve and much should be heard
of them in the future.

MARTY NEARLY BREAKS
OWN RECORD

And that veteran of high jump-*
ers, Walter Marty, gave conclusive
evidence that he will lie right there
in first place when the high jump
event is concluded this summer in
Germany. Coming within three
eighths of an inch of his own world's
record of G feet 9V 8 inches, Marty
showed that he is capable of break
ing the mark he set two years ago.

EASTMAN OUTFOXES
LOS ANGELES CYNICS

The die-hards were at it again j
last week and once again they were j
wrong. After Troy smeared the |
Olympic Club in the Coliseum, the I
wise boys discussed Ben Bangs !
Eastman, and they settled his case J
out of court. The old Eastman speed
was missing. He never showed that
form which led him to so many stir- |
ring undergraduate victories and to j
a world's championship in the 440.
Saturday, for the first time since ;
he started his comeback, Eastman I
tried some real running in the half I
mile. And he refuted all the bleach- |
er coaches by turning a 1:52.9 880 —
two seconds better than he did
against U.S.C., and the mast cred
itable showing on the Coast this
year at that distance.
Big Ben seemed to lope along with
that same long, easy stride that has
constantly amazed the track world. ,
Without extending himself, he cov
ered the distance yards ahead of the I
field.
There is no doubt but that East
man should win a berth on the i
Olympic team this year. He once
more looms as one of the most re- !
liable point winners for the U.S. |
team. With a game leg and two |
years of inactivity behind him, East
