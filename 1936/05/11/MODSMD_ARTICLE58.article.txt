## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Cardinals Grant Monopoly Of Top Jobs to Campus Big Shots 
### 
The cry that responsible campus positions
are being usurped by a certain few "campus
big shots," is being heard more and more fre
quently on the Farm. Over and over again the
same names appear as committee chairmen,
drive heads, group leaders. Each campus lead
er holds not one, but two or three top jobs.
Cardinals is in a good measure responsible
for such a situation. This activities group, cre
ated in 1934 with the reorganization of the
A.S.S.U. constitution, has as its purpose a syn
chronization of campus activities. Such an aim
is all well and good.
In trying to establish itself as a valuable
group, however, Cardinals has endeavored to
seize more and more power into its own hands.
The best jobs have been passed out among its
own personnel, or to further the political am
bitions of a few "coming" big shots.
It has failed to exercise its constitutional obli
gations (Article IV, Section I, b2): "Committee

men will also be taken from the Rally Commit
tee and the Women's Committee, giving all who
desire a chance in this line, tc show their abil
ity."
There certainly are more people of ability on
a campus as large as Stanford than the small
group which claims membership in Cardinals,
the Rally Committee, or the Women's Commit
tee. Many competent people, unable to get an
appointment to any of these groups, find no
market for their services.
This situation exists particularly among trans
fer students, who cannot ge*t appointments be
cause they did not enter Stanford as freshmen.
Cardinals is a self-perpetuating body, granted
considerable power by the constitution. But
like many relatively new groups, Cardinals is
too much impressed with its own importance,
and it will have to learn to use this power more
wisely if it is to survive what is already a fairly
sizeable wave of resentment. Politics can be
too obvious, and too tactless.
