# Officially, Nominations Begin Tomorrow
## 
### 
Officially, nominations for the various A.S.
S.U. offices will be made tomorrow, a week
before election. In reality, there will hardly be
one name on the official list which has not
been the result of several weeks' effort on the
part of an astounding number of students.
There is something that smacks too much of
the professional game of politics in this situation
which exists on the Stanford campus today.
Students who protest that education is one of
the most important means of increasing the
number of the "well-informed" throughout the
country, seem to over-reach themselves in the
heat of beckoning glory and stage an imitation
of those very practices which they whole-heart
edly agree to abolish, in the class-room, or in
one of those inspirational bull-sessions on the
world situation.
It is no longer possible for a candidate to be
nominated independently for any office down
to the bottom of the list, and to be sure of an
even chance at winning over the candidate who
has been nominated by a caucus which is not
organized to the best interests of all its repre
sentation. In order to be nominated it is neces
sary for a student to know the right people to
pull his name through a clearing-house of either
Hall or Row. If he does not have this initial aid
of a machine to support him against a rival

, faction, he cannot begin to hope to carry his
caucus nomination. Once the machines are at
' war, the supporters who can think on their feet
come away victorious, and a candidate has been
nominated to represent the majority.
When class offices, including freshman and
sophomore, are the subject of as much machina
tion as that of A.S.S.U. president, the game loses
its spontaneity and reveals itself as an inefficient
system. The fifteen names necessary to run a
candidate have lost their official sanction in the
nominations which begin tomorrow.
