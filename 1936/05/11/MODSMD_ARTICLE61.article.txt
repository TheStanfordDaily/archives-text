Seein' as this is the Women's Edish and a singing
waitress is serving up the dirt instead of your regular
correspondent, it is appropriate to tell a good one on
Our Hasher's own Tong.
It seems there was an Alpha Delt who had never
in all his years on the Farm, had a date with any of
the fair Indian maids who grace this campus. Finally,
in a moment of weakness and after imbibing a quan
tity of fire-water, the brave * ventured across the
alley and invited an Alpha Phi to tear up the town
with him.
The brothers thought this a fine idea. In fact, so
impressed were they that they decided to celebrate
the occasion appropriately later that night. A piano
was dragged out on their lawn, sleeping members were
dragged from their beds, and the young lady was
serenaded. Someone across the street chimed in with
a violin, a la "One Night of Love."
Neighbors were beginning to fear that nothing
could quench the ardor of the Alpha Delts, when the
big red machine from the firehouse arrived on the
scene and effectively doused the burning in the im
bibing brother's throat.
Another story that ends up with a bang concerns
a member of the well known eating club whose re
cent. banquet of "stink-bombs on toast" made the San
Francisco headlines. Apparently the women for
whom such unusual entertainment was provided re
tained no hard feelings, for when time came for the
eating club's spring formal, this particular member
persuaded one of these young ladies to accompany
him.
All was going well until the evening drew 1o a
close. It was the last dance. The orchestra was play
ing "Lights Out" -with appropriate trimmings. Sud
denly the comfortable dimness gave way to a flood of
light, and the aforementioned member was caught in
the act of transferring a considerable amount of lip
stick from one resting place to another.
Was his face red!
"Love Will Find a Way" is the name of our final
offering.
A certain student, who lives at Lagunita, has a
name that starts with "A. ' She also has a friend who
indulges in flying visits both to and over her domicile.
He is an aviator, which also starts with "A."
Recently her friends were startled one morning by
the appearance on •Lagunita's lawn of an enormous
A made out of sheets, pillow-cases, and other bits of
laundry. They were not to remain puzzled for long,
however, for the zoom of an airplane announced the
arrival of the ' flying A viator, and they witnessed
the certain student greeting him with the wave of a
red laundry bau.

eating club's spring formal, this particular member
persuaded one of these young ladies to accompany
him.
All was going well until the evening drew 1o a
close. It was the last dance. The orchestra was play
ing "Lights Out" -with appropriate trimmings. Sud
denly the comfortable dimness gave way to a flood of

A certain student, who lives at Lagunita, has a
name that starts with "A. ' She also has a friend who
indulges in flying visits both to and over her domicile.
He is an aviator, which also starts with "A."
Recently her friends were startled one morning by
the appearance on •Lagunita's lawn of an enormous
A made out of sheets, pillow-cases, and other bits of
laundry. They were not to remain puzzled for long,
however, for the zoom of an airplane announced the
arrival of the ' flying A viator, and they witnessed
the certain student greeting him with the wave of a
red laundry bau.

waitress is serving up the dirt instead of your regular
correspondent, it is appropriate to tell a good one on
Our Hasher's own Tong.
It seems there was an Alpha Delt who had never
in all his years on the Farm, had a date with any of
the fair Indian maids who grace this campus. Finally,
in a moment of weakness and after imbibing a quan
tity of fire-water, the brave * ventured across the
alley and invited an Alpha Phi to tear up the town
with him.
The brothers thought this a fine idea. In fact, so
impressed were they that they decided to celebrate
the occasion appropriately later that night. A piano
was dragged out on their lawn, sleeping members were
dragged from their beds, and the young lady was
serenaded. Someone across the street chimed in with
a violin, a la "One Night of Love."
Neighbors were beginning to fear that nothing
could quench the ardor of the Alpha Delts, when the
big red machine from the firehouse arrived on the
scene and effectively doused the burning in the im
bibing brother's throat.
Another story that ends up with a bang concerns
a member of the well known eating club whose re
cent. banquet of "stink-bombs on toast" made the San
Francisco headlines. Apparently the women for
whom such unusual entertainment was provided re
