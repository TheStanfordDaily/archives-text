# Less Red Tape, More Efficiency in Roble Setup
## 
### 
Re-organization of the Roble sponsor setup
should facilitate the orientation of freshman
women next year.
By eliminating corridor chairmen and by ap
pointing a group of eight junior sponsors, the
wheels of the Roble machinery ought to run
more smoothly and with less red tape.
The so-called junior sponsors will remain in
Roble only one quarter. During winter quar
ter, the freshmen themselves will take over
the more routine jobs. Thus they can more
efficiently take over complete self-government
when the senior sponsors move out in the
spring.
