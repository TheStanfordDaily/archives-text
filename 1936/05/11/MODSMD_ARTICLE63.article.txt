## Can College Women "Live"? 
### 
(From the Minnesota Daily)
Latest blow to college education comes from Holly
wood, where the press agent of one Frances Farmer, a
pretty movie actress," has the film player say that
from a woman s standpoint, a college education doesn't
pay. Miss Farmer is doubly qualified to speak on this
point foi she is both a woman and a college graduate
—the University of Washington, to be exact. Fetch -
ingly attitred in what a second hasty glance ut her
photograph reveals is a white bathing suit, Miss
Farmer told the press that colleges and universities
rob women of their capacity to live.
As she sees it, the trouble is inherent in college
education and the only way women can keep their
capacity to live intact is to shun higher education.
"A girl is fairly normal when she enters college,"
Miss Farmer explains, "but this thing of being intel
lectual and of meeting each problem rationally and all
that is a terrible thing."
"Women live on emotion," she continues, "and
when that is taken from them by too mulch intro
spective thinking, they re not feminine any more."
Somehow we suspect that Miss Farmer's argument
is a little weak. We don't know just how things arc at
the University of Washington, but we presume that
they aie much (he same as they are at the University
of Minnesota and other educational points in the East.
A little eavesdropping on a cluster of coeds on the
campus or a Saturday night tour of the Twin City
entertainment spots would soon quiet Miss Farmer's
fear that college women are meeting each problem "ra
tionally and all that."
Deep down in her heart Miss Farmer is probably
an idealist about college education. At sometime dur
ing her college career the actress probably took a.
note in freshman orientation reading: "College educa
tion—Object: To enable one to meet problems rationally
and intellectually. But. purpose and accomplishment
are, alas, two very different things.
