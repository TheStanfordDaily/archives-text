# Current Show Has Good Cast, Strained Plot

### 
A MESSAGE TO GARCIA,"
! starring Wallace Beery, John Boles,
| and Barbara Stanwyck, is another
| one of 20th Century's good pictures. |
| The acting is up to the trio's stand
| ard even if the plot is at times a
j little strained.
John Boles, a lieutenant in the
j army, is delegated by the President
: to carry an important message to ;

General Garcia in
the wilds of the
Cuban swamps. On
his way he meets
Wallace Beery, a
ruffiian who would
Bell his life for a

j little gold or a good meal and a
j bottle of wine. A friendship is
I founded between the two adven
turers.
Barbara Stanwyck enters the pic- I
ture as the daughter of a slain i
Cuban patriot, who devotes her life
to furthering the purpose of the
American lieutenant.
There are plenty of good shots,
[ and it's a picture well worth seeing.

j "MURDER IN THE BRIDLE
PATH." Murder in the Moonlight,
Murder on the Texas Rangeâ€”they're
all the same. Detective thrillers,
| supposedly, they have gloomy
| buildings, screaming women, plenty
: of murders for the kiddies, and lots
of ugly faces. This one is no ex
i ception.
James Gleason tries to make a
I come-back, but is only half funny,
I and is almost wholly supported by
Helen Broderick's fairly clever lines.
The story, if you are interested, is
about a crazy butler who is robbed
by a doddering old turf fan and his
daughters and resorts'to killing them
for 'revenge. Of course, all their
friends, relatives, and in-laws are
dragged into the case. I
