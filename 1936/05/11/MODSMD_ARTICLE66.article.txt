## POLITICS—POOR AND SIMPLE 
### 
Caucuses are over. And in the I
spring elections come on May 19.
And part of the campus wonders
I just why all the to-do atjout it.
! Activities do undoubtedly add ;
spice to life, and make for wider
contacts and broadened experience.
But is any sort of experience worth
! the tears and wire-pulling that poli- ;
tics necessitate?
Instead of rewarding supposed
; ability, most offices seem to be con
solation prizes to the most enter
prising go-getters and self-promot
! ers.
♦ * *
Some candidates, of course, are ;
considered all year for a position.
They rank high above other possi
bilities, and others feel their fitness
keenly enough to do the requisite
| campaigning and vote-fixing for I
| them. But the one who sets out for {
• a job at the beginning of his college !
career, picking activities which will j
lead up to it, choosing friends for
| what they can contribute toward the
band-wagon, is a politician in the
1 more widely accepted and criticized
sense of the word.
And politics in that sense are not
j character builders. They teach per- j
; sonal ambition rather than co-opera
tion. They aim to get anyone else !
i out of the way in the most efficient
manner, and the one goal is the most
lucrative gravy-train job possible.
Idealism, in this sort of politics, is
as out of place as an organdy formal
; in a swimming pool. The Women's
Conference nominators discovered I
this when they tried to wish away j
the Row-Hall split and found them
selves blithely overlooked.
Perhaps, in the end, the best per
son wins. But probably not. If the
I number of traded votes could be |
laid end to end, half the nominees '
I would turn Coolidge in righteous!
horror.

One promising sign is the fact
that very few ballots are marked
for a straight ticket. Perhaps voters
do choose the "prettiest" name.
Perhaps they do say "eeny meeny
miny mo" when marking their pref
erences. They undoubtedly vote for
Susie because they knew a man who
roomed with someone who took
Susie out. But the fact remains that
they do have a reason, trivial as it
may be, instead of memorizing the
dictated Hall or Row nominations
and slavishly checking meaningless
names.
If would-be nominees realized the
meaninglessness of most victories,
and the emptiness of many ofTices
once attained, much of the heart
break and self-glorification might be
eliminated. But will they? Probably
1 not. —Whitmore

One promising sign is the fact
that very few ballots are marked
for a straight ticket. Perhaps voters
do choose the "prettiest" name.
Perhaps they do say "eeny meeny
miny mo" when marking their pref
erences. They undoubtedly vote for
Susie because they knew a man who
roomed with someone who took
Susie out. But the fact remains that
they do have a reason, trivial as it
may be, instead of memorizing the
dictated Hall or Row nominations
and slavishly checking meaningless
names.
If would-be nominees realized the
meaninglessness of most victories,
and the emptiness of many ofTices
once attained, much of the heart
break and self-glorification might be
eliminated. But will they? Probably
