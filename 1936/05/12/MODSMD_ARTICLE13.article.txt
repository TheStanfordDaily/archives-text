# Sorry Lady, But Firehouse Isn't Mr. Hoover's Home
## 
### 
Chief Dugan has noticed that the :
j social calls which come in over the (
campus firehouse's two telephones;
] seem to outnumber the alarms
i phoned in. For instance, one came |
! in the other night.
"Stanford firehouse," barked Fire- j
[ man No. 10 when the phone jangled, j
"Here is your party," said the
j operator, indicating a long distance
j call.
"Hello," chimed a feminine voice, !
j "may I speak to Mr. Herbert
/Hoover?"
"I'm sorry, lady," replied the fire
j man, "Mr. Hoover doesn't live at the i
firehouse."
