When (he curtain rises in the

wants his voice to be heard by
f everyone in the country.
IX Curtain Calls
Therefore, Mr. Eddy started his
career with money a secondary mat
ter. The appreciation of those people
who could afford to hear him took
the form of 18 curtain calls at Los
Angeles and he found himself on the
way to Hollywood.
Until he arrived there he never
I realized how Utile he knew about
acting, and he attributes the success
of Lawrence Tibbett in opera to his
motion picture experience.
Hollywood Helps

j "is a sort ol house-cleaning process
; which does away with all the cob
j webs and left-overs of the past
: which prevent opera from being a
: vital, living art."

j ties such as Chaliapin in opera who
| are natural born actors. He needed
j no training when he made his first
â€¢ film.
