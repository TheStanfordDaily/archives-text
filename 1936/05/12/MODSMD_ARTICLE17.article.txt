### 
The Pi Phi davenport, the lady in
I red, and the "picnic blanket" caused
' quite a stir up in Pullman, Wash
ington, last week. In fact, 15000
Washington State College students
i cut classes and marched two miles
| through raw winds and drizzling
I rain to get the whole thing straight
l ened out.
And Friday morning, when the af
fair was finally fixed up, the students
were on the "plus" end. President
E. O. Holland admitted that their
, requests were legitimate, and a fac
ulty committee granted them.
Dean's Farts
Throughout the trouble there
were, however, certain rumors
which had to Ik; cleared up. Dean of
Women Annie Fertig did the clear
ing up. Friday morning she pre
sented the "facts" in the college
newspaper:
"1. Red dresses were never pro
i hibited.
"2. The use of blankets is not for
bidden on picnics, now nor ever,
during my administration.
"3. No girl has ever, to my knowl
i edge, been cautioned by me or by

' any member of my staff not to bend
over a drinking fountain.
Lawn Ilulin;r
"4. The case quoted of two girls
lying on a lawn and told that one
must sit up has not the slightest
foundation.
"5. The 'pillow 1 story has no
foundation. In fact, it is a per
sistent rumor which, like the state
ment that saltpeter is put in the
food, is utterly false.
"6. The Pi Beta Phi davenport has
figured largely in the discussion. I
asked that it be taken inside because
it was reported that it was occupied
during study hours and was causing
unfavorable comment among our
good friends."
Ranncrs Displayed
During the parade which brought
the "blue laws rebellion" to a head,
huge banners were displayed.
Among them: "College <y convent?",
I "This may be a row-college but
we're not contented," "Hitler is to
Germany what Holland is to Wash
ington State," "Prudes left with the
horse and buguy," and "We're not
reds but we want a white admin
istration."
