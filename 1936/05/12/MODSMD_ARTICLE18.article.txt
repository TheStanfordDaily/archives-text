# Chappie Profit Distribution To Be Altered
## Creamer Finds Plan Is Unsatisfactory; Change Editor's, Manager's Pay 
### R. B. Jones 
Hammer and Coffin, finding the
present system of distribution of ;
Chaparral profits unsatisfactory, 1
have come to an agreement under ]
the authority of a committee ap- j
pointed by James Copp. president of |
the society, altering the income of j
editor, business manager, and |
Hammer and Coffin itself.
Under the present system the edi- !
tor receives $50 in salary and 15 per
cent of the net profits of the maga- i
zine. The business manager gets I
$60 and 45 per cent of the profits, j
and the remaining 40 per cent goes j
to a Hammer and Coffin Fund, 1
which at present amounts to about j
$6000.
Fund for Improvements
The primary purpose of the latter
fund is for permanent improve- j
ments for Chaparral and the so- j
ciety. Secondly, it is to maintain 1
reserve to cover possible deficit, J
which the income from the publi
cation shall not be large enough to ,
pay.
"The present plan is unsatisfac
tory," says Dick Creamer, business
manager, "because, in the event of |
a publication building, $6000 would j
more than cover Chaparral's share j
of the expense."
Surplus for Magazine
"In considering the secondary
purpose of the fund," Creamer fur- |
ther asserts, "I feel that if Chappie !
runs up a deficit of more than $6000 j
in the next several years, we might l
as well quit publication. Therefore, I
since there is no reason for an j
increase of the Hammer and Coffin i
fund, any surplus should rightfully
be spent on the magazine."
After consideration of every pos- i
sible plan, the reasonable agree
ment reached was one in which j
both the editor and business man- i
ager receive a percentage of what |
they spend. "One can conceive of a '
regime under this plan, the objec- I
tive of which would be to spend as j
much as they could," Creamer ad- i
mits.
Restriction Counteracts Loss
This fault, howevei-, is counter
acted by the restriction that any
business manager who loses money
while in office will receive no per
centage of the profits whatsoever.
The salaries will remain constant.
For everty $80 spent on the maga
zine $15 is set up to the business
manager's credit, and although the
editor's percentage is still in ques
tion, to give him a slightly larger
percentage is now under considera
tion.
Profit Is Shown
The amount credited to the edi
tor and business manager, respec
tively, is turned over to them at the
end of the school year with the pro
vision that a current operating profit
is shown. This profit is found by
subtracting the amount credited to
the two officers from the difference
between the gross receipts and the
total expenditures.

Hammer and Coffin, finding the
present system of distribution of ;
Chaparral profits unsatisfactory, 1
have come to an agreement under ]
the authority of a committee ap- j
pointed by James Copp. president of |
the society, altering the income of j
editor, business manager, and |
Hammer and Coffin itself.
Under the present system the edi- !
tor receives $50 in salary and 15 per
cent of the net profits of the maga- i
zine. The business manager gets I
$60 and 45 per cent of the profits, j
and the remaining 40 per cent goes j
to a Hammer and Coffin Fund, 1
which at present amounts to about j
$6000.
Fund for Improvements
The primary purpose of the latter
fund is for permanent improve- j
ments for Chaparral and the so- j
ciety. Secondly, it is to maintain 1
reserve to cover possible deficit, J
which the income from the publi
cation shall not be large enough to ,
pay.
"The present plan is unsatisfac
tory," says Dick Creamer, business
manager, "because, in the event of |
a publication building, $6000 would j
more than cover Chaparral's share j
of the expense."
Surplus for Magazine
"In considering the secondary
purpose of the fund," Creamer fur- |
ther asserts, "I feel that if Chappie !
runs up a deficit of more than $6000 j
in the next several years, we might l
as well quit publication. Therefore, I
since there is no reason for an j
increase of the Hammer and Coffin i
fund, any surplus should rightfully
be spent on the magazine."
After consideration of every pos- i
sible plan, the reasonable agree
ment reached was one in which j
both the editor and business man- i
ager receive a percentage of what |
they spend. "One can conceive of a '
regime under this plan, the objec- I
tive of which would be to spend as j
much as they could," Creamer ad- i
mits.
Restriction Counteracts Loss
This fault, howevei-, is counter
acted by the restriction that any
business manager who loses money
while in office will receive no per
centage of the profits whatsoever.
The salaries will remain constant.
For everty $80 spent on the maga
zine $15 is set up to the business
manager's credit, and although the
editor's percentage is still in ques
tion, to give him a slightly larger
percentage is now under considera
tion.
Profit Is Shown
The amount credited to the edi
tor and business manager, respec
tively, is turned over to them at the
end of the school year with the pro
vision that a current operating profit
is shown. This profit is found by
subtracting the amount credited to
the two officers from the difference
between the gross receipts and the
total expenditures.
