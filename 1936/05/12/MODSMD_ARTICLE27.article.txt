### Les Squires 
Today in rhyme,
And mood disheartening,
We toast our time,
And the art of boondoggling.
Now here's a report bought with
taxpayers' money,
On how to make miik cows happy
and sunny,
Thousands were paid by a nation
demented,
To find out the reasons why cows
aren't contented.
To quote â€”
The fellow wrote:
"The love life of the average cow,
Was once much happier than now;
She has no time for thoughts sub
lime,
She's just a unit in the milk-can
line."
But the top of success in this boon
doggling art,
Comes when vote-oggling plays the
principal part,
The Washington airport is knee
deep in mud,
In seasons of dryness and seasons of
flood.
Yet of boondoggling funds it got not
a penny,
Of votes, the Wash, voters just
haven't any.
But in hundreds of hick towlis all
over the land.
Huge airports are rising from cin
ders and sand,
For the dictum that rules the PWA,
Is simply, "It's always the voters
WE pay."
Twenty thousand for street signs in
old Alabama,
Plus dollars to hire a Sally Rand
fanna',
Just one hundred thousand for one
mile of road,
And hundreds to study the life of
the toad,
A third of a million for modern out
houses,
And new camps for hundreds of
CCC souses,
A total of thousands to patch up a
brook,
And four hundred thousand for a
nation's guide book,
Add seventeen hundred for fancy
bird cages,
And millions to fill up new amateur
stages.
Add dollars in thousands to build
two new grandstands,
Designed to accommodate 300 ball
fans.
The point of the story in this case
you see,
Is the fact that the school had pupils
283;
The WPA failed to notice, it seems,
That the school hadn't football or
even track teams.
Put, the top spot of all in this idiot's
dream,
Was the six hundred thousand al
lotted the scheme,
To halt the dire spread of fever
malarial,
In a county where hundreds of facts
secretarial,
Failed to show the least sign of a
case;
In fact, in all history there wasn't a
trace,
Or a sign in that state of malarial
fever.
And so our great nation, and how
we all love 'er,
Continues to foolishly pour down the
gutter.
The millions we'll pay on a very
near day,
In taxes.
