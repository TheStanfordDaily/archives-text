# Aloisi Walks Out As League Meet Hits Deadlock
## Italy's Sovereignty Claim In Ethiopia Opposed; League May Adjourn 
### 
GENEVA, May 11 (^P). —Premier
Mussolini and the League of Nations
were deadlocked tonight on the con
quest of Ethiopia.
British delegates said the League
would resist Italy's claim of sover
: eignty. Baron Pompeo Aloisi, II
Duce's representative, finding the
council opposed to him, simply
walked out of an opening private
council session with his colleagues.
"Futile," exclaimed the Italian
baron as he stalked out, refusing
to sit at the table with Wolda Mar
i iam, whose country—Ethiopia—he
said, no longer exists.
"The only sovereignty existing in
Ethiopia is that of Italy," he told
the council delegates, gathered
j around the famous horseshoe
' table.
Not Quitting League
i Italian sources, however, said his
I departure did not mean Italy was
quitting the League, although it
1 had been hinted the fascist state
might do so rather than discuss
Ethiopia in the presence of an agent
of the exiled Negus.
The League powers found them
selves face to face with an increas
; ingly delicate situation. Several said
it seemed the only practical course
would be to condemn Italy's atti
tude; then to adjourn until June.
Begins Demobilization
It appeared sanctions, for the time
j being, would remain in effect—at
least nominally.
While his African armies, under
1 the new viceroy, Marshal Pietro
Badoglio, moved to complete their
j occupation of Ethiopia, II Duce be
gan turning soldiers back into civil
ians.
He ordered demobilization of the
principal classes he called to the
1 colors for the war.
