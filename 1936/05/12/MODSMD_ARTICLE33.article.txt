# NICE WORK, BOYS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Congrats, Daily, for a nice little
piece of work.
For years news organs of other
universities have given their read
ers column upon column about the
latest political ructions (e.g., the
President Lambert-Editor Harrison
beef at UCLA.)
But. shame of shames, if the Dip
py didn't always get clam-like, the
softies, and never even breathed a
breath of political shillyshallying -shallying
on our august campus.
So for years, we were almost con
vinced that maybe this campus was
n't as putrid at the core as some
others.
This was obviously foolish, 'cuz
certainly there must be a few
Ethiops in the woodpile.
Surely, Daily must have erred in
omitting these luscious, juicy, never
dull tales of who is slicing whose
throat and who is the latest to have
aspirations of being a political shot.
Then, joyous day, a reversal. Daily
powers-that-be saw the lack in
Daily policy and proceeded to give
us the present superlative campus
political coverage that now enlivens
our official publication.
With caucuses to the right of thorn,
caucuses to the left of them, and
Solon O. Swampum—with his de
licious tid-bits — protruding his
beagle in between, Daily readers can
now get right in and wallow in the
political muck so thick on other
campi.
Naively, many students formerly
thought Row-Hall friction on the
Farm was at a minimum compared
to the slashing antics found else
where. How much finer it is to
know that Row hates Hall and all
men are enemies.
No longer are we an unenlight
ened electorate. Mercilessly, accu
rately, completely, the Daily has
dragged machines, straight tickets,
committee-hounds, and other un
assorted bugaboos from the sordid
depths of quiescence, and turned the
purifying ray of publicity upon
them.
Politicos .and politics, however, are
better off in the depths; when drag
ged out to be purified, it all too
often happens that they thrive on
publicity as a food, and multiply iike
rabbits.
Thanks, Daily, for telling vis all
the cold dope.

: The Editor, Sir:
Doubtful of the emancipatory
realities to be gained by Women's
Conference's last move, we wonder
1 if the How with its minority has not
gained advantage from the Hall's
majority. Equal representation on
| the nominating body for Hall and
Row means a relative increase for
the Row.
We concede Livingston the point
of increased political activity on the
part of Women's Conference, how
: ever. In addition we note increased
i political activity along other polit-
I ical fronts, despite Livingston's
j highly dramatic and tremendously
j moving indictment of student and
administrative apathy. Witness the
sophomore machine and the fast
I growing caucuses. In a larger sense
j these are activities within apathy
and do not constitute a stirring of
an intelligent student opinion.
One' cannot expcct worthwhile
administration to rise from such a
background. Therefore, while ad
mitting the right of any man to

' sweeten his bitter fruit with noble
optimism, we applaud Ex Commit- j
tee's action to simplify administra- t
tive details.

No longer are we an unenlight

dragged machines, straight tickets,

purifying ray of publicity upon
them.
Politicos .and politics, however, are
better off in the depths; when drag

Doubtful of the emancipatory
realities to be gained by Women's
Conference's last move, we wonder
1 if the How with its minority has not
gained advantage from the Hall's
majority. Equal representation on
| the nominating body for Hall and
Row means a relative increase for
the Row.
We concede Livingston the point
of increased political activity on the
part of Women's Conference, how
: ever. In addition we note increased
i political activity along other polit-
I ical fronts, despite Livingston's
j highly dramatic and tremendously
j moving indictment of student and
administrative apathy. Witness the
sophomore machine and the fast
I growing caucuses. In a larger sense
j these are activities within apathy
and do not constitute a stirring of
an intelligent student opinion.
One' cannot expcct worthwhile
administration to rise from such a
background. Therefore, while ad
mitting the right of any man to

' sweeten his bitter fruit with noble
optimism, we applaud Ex Commit- j
tee's action to simplify administra- t
tive details.

The Editor, Sir:
Congrats, Daily, for a nice little
piece of work.
For years news organs of other
universities have given their read
ers column upon column about the
latest political ructions (e.g., the
President Lambert-Editor Harrison
beef at UCLA.)
But. shame of shames, if the Dip
py didn't always get clam-like, the
softies, and never even breathed a
breath of political shillyshallying -shallying
on our august campus.
So for years, we were almost con
vinced that maybe this campus was
n't as putrid at the core as some
others.
This was obviously foolish, 'cuz
certainly there must be a few
Ethiops in the woodpile.
Surely, Daily must have erred in
omitting these luscious, juicy, never
dull tales of who is slicing whose
throat and who is the latest to have
aspirations of being a political shot.
Then, joyous day, a reversal. Daily
powers-that-be saw the lack in
Daily policy and proceeded to give
us the present superlative campus
political coverage that now enlivens
our official publication.
With caucuses to the right of thorn,
caucuses to the left of them, and
Solon O. Swampum—with his de
licious tid-bits — protruding his
beagle in between, Daily readers can
now get right in and wallow in the
political muck so thick on other
campi.
Naively, many students formerly
thought Row-Hall friction on the
Farm was at a minimum compared
to the slashing antics found else
where. How much finer it is to
know that Row hates Hall and all
men are enemies.
