# Farm 'Beauty' Will Be Shown In May Chappie
## 
### 
Thursday at 8 a.m. on Quad cor
ners, Chaparral announces the re
sult of its yearly Farm beauty con
test with a large photograph of the
lucky winning lady.
The cover sets a new high for
color, humor, and timeliness, as do
Anne Ritchie's poem, "The Worm's
Turn," illustrated by Gilman Gist,
and Jim Copp's "How To Drive a
Car," a story cartooned by the au
thor himself.
This issue celebrates the thirteenth
anniversary of the founding of Ham
mer and Coffin, national college
comic society, with a pertinent
NOW THAT editorial.
Pete Knecht. for the benefit of
those people puzzled, as far as
"swing" is concerned, tells exactly
what it is not.
What happens when Pop Off goes
riding with a corpulent woman is
left to the imagination, states Jim
Copp, until Thursday morning on
the quad.
