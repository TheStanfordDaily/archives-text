self a fast swimmer in recent meets, •
is fairly consistent in getting the
ball after the starting whistle. Bill

mermen and goal-scorers, will play
in the forward posts for the Cards.
Don Peterson, Ben Voss, and Jack
Loupe will play guards on the var- j
sity aggregation. In the goal will be

to substitute for the first-string

Alumni and seniors have not been
chosen definitely for Thursday's
game, although several who have
been playing daily with the varsity
will undoubtedly make up part of
the team. Bob Haslacher, well
known goal guard of the 1935 squad,
will hold his usual post.
