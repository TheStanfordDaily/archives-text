# Swampum Pictures Caucus-Mad Farm
## 
### Solon O. Swampum 
Attacks and counter-attacks come
! thick and fast in the caucus situa
! tion. Now it's the Hall frosh, or
ganizing in self defense against the
Row frosh who organized in self de
fense against them and against their
ambitious pledge captains (vicious
I circle department).
Hall Class of "39ers have called an
oh-so-innocuous meeting tomorrow
night, to be held in Toyon at 10
i o'clock.
Present will be Jimmy Triolo and
i Marvie Kahn, neither of whom
! could possibly be accused of being
j in politics.
The idea was Harry Horton's. He,
I being the Hall candidate against
' Pete Fay for presidency, there
| by displayed the political acumen
j previously credited to Taggart and
| Newell.

"Plans for organization and pol
icy" is the purpose of the gather
ing. Present will undoubtedly be
Andy Stojkovitch, nominee for Ex
Committee.
Jack Hansen, logical Hall candi
date for graduate man on Ex Com
mittee, definitely does not choose to
run. He says so himself.
Problem: Who will succeed Phil
Coghlan and Jim Ludlam as number
one organizers next year? Cogh
lan, who is retiring from active duty,
last year put in Franich, Alustiza,
and Grover. Ludlam is the guiding
spirit of the Zete-Sigma Chi-Phi
Delt alliance.
The soph party-bolters will cease
bolting and support Killefer, they
say, in spite of much complaint
about unfair distribution of spoils.
Included among the recalcitrants
were S.A.E., Phi P.si, D.U., Fiji, and
Deke.
We recall that last year Marvie
Kahn had promised to support Wally
Brooke. Most obvious reason was
that he thought Triolo could beat
Brooke for the presidency, but could
not beat Grayson.
This year Brooke carries on by
backing Franich as A.S.S.U. head.
Why? Perhaps because he thought
Phi Psi Mac Donald would then have
a clear field as senior class presi
dent. But since D'Evelyn, as ex
pected, won the Row nomination,
what will Brooke do?
