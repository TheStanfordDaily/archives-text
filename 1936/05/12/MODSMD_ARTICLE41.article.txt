The title of this yarn should be
"The Fast 880," or "The Return of
Ihe Native," or much more appro
priately "Ben Eastman Runs the 880
in 1:52.9 Despite Bum Leg and
Howls of Critics."
Anyone who saw Ben run the
half-mile at his old favorite rac
ing park Saturday knew that he
was a cinch for the Olympic
Games this summer, barring acci
dent.
It was the regular Eastman race
—never a slow stretch, never any
gush of sprint—just the knife-like
stride for the full yardage and no
one on the Coast could have
matched it.
As for limping or breaking of
strides—he did not break that flash
ing gait of his once the whole race.
It was all in perfect form, and then
he stepped over and put his sweat
clothes on with the same old blond
smile and walked away with his
closest competitor and newest big
time half-miler, Bill McCurdy.
McCUIiDY. DIXON
McCurdy and Warren Dixon were
the two ray-of-sunshine boys for the
Cardinal Saturday. McCurdy step
ped out of the mediocre class with
Eastman to follow and established
himself in a class definitely up with
Bush, Cassin, and Johnson of S.C.,
probably better than those in their
present condition.
Dixon, coming up fast as always
after a slow early season, showed
even more of a kick than he had
.showed all week to trim Norm
Bright. Norm should have entered
only the two-mile, if he should have
run at all, but was obedient to the
mandates of Coach Charlie Hunter,
who wanted to have the second best
track team in the country by beat
ing Stanford. Norm has only work
ed out about five times in as many
weeks, but intends pretty soon to
start training in earnest for the July
Olympic trials.
PHIL LEVY
After two whole years of trying to
beat one of the better discus throw
ers, Phil Levy finally did it and it is
a good thing, for Phil's sake.
Trimming Gordy Dunn by a couple
of inches at 105.9 is a milestone for
him. He had been beaten by Car
penter and Dunn and the other head
line throwers so regularly that it
was getting to be bad for his spirit.
But now with the conquest of
Dunn, who is still one of the three
best in the land, he has the mark,
the confidence, and the incentive to
quit fouling and toss it in the 170's.
REYNOLDS, SMITH, GRIBBEN
Jim Reynolds got of! his best put
in competition Saturday. His 51.6 is
probably the best mark made by a
college man this year.
Humbert Smith did not tie up
when faced with the world record
holder but did right well to string
along with Walter Marty up to 6.5%.
Hugh Gribben did what few ex
pected him to, by spinning the plat
ter 152 feet for his all-time high.
Taking A1 Hershey's place while Al
is getting rid of a sore neck, Gripes
beat the veteran Bobby Jones and
moved up into the contender list
for a trip to the N.C.2-A.

Jim Reynolds got of! his best put
in competition Saturday. His 51.6 is
probably the best mark made by a
college man this year.
Humbert Smith did not tie up
when faced with the world record
holder but did right well to string
along with Walter Marty up to 6.5%.
Hugh Gribben did what few ex
pected him to, by spinning the plat
ter 152 feet for his all-time high.
Taking A1 Hershey's place while Al
is getting rid of a sore neck, Gripes
beat the veteran Bobby Jones and
moved up into the contender list
for a trip to the N.C.2-A.
—Breed
The title of this yarn should be
"The Fast 880," or "The Return of
Ihe Native," or much more appro
priately "Ben Eastman Runs the 880
in 1:52.9 Despite Bum Leg and
Howls of Critics."
Anyone who saw Ben run the
half-mile at his old favorite rac
ing park Saturday knew that he
was a cinch for the Olympic
Games this summer, barring acci
dent.
It was the regular Eastman race
—never a slow stretch, never any
gush of sprint—just the knife-like
stride for the full yardage and no
one on the Coast could have
matched it.
As for limping or breaking of
strides—he did not break that flash
ing gait of his once the whole race.
It was all in perfect form, and then
he stepped over and put his sweat
clothes on with the same old blond
smile and walked away with his
closest competitor and newest big
time half-miler, Bill McCurdy.
McCUIiDY. DIXON
McCurdy and Warren Dixon were
the two ray-of-sunshine boys for the
Cardinal Saturday. McCurdy step
ped out of the mediocre class with
Eastman to follow and established
himself in a class definitely up with
Bush, Cassin, and Johnson of S.C.,
probably better than those in their
present condition.
Dixon, coming up fast as always
after a slow early season, showed
even more of a kick than he had
.showed all week to trim Norm
Bright. Norm should have entered
only the two-mile, if he should have
run at all, but was obedient to the
mandates of Coach Charlie Hunter,
who wanted to have the second best
track team in the country by beat
ing Stanford. Norm has only work
ed out about five times in as many
weeks, but intends pretty soon to
start training in earnest for the July
Olympic trials.
PHIL LEVY
After two whole years of trying to
beat one of the better discus throw
ers, Phil Levy finally did it and it is
a good thing, for Phil's sake.
Trimming Gordy Dunn by a couple
of inches at 105.9 is a milestone for
him. He had been beaten by Car
penter and Dunn and the other head
line throwers so regularly that it
was getting to be bad for his spirit.
But now with the conquest of
Dunn, who is still one of the three
best in the land, he has the mark,
the confidence, and the incentive to
quit fouling and toss it in the 170's.
