# Track Team To Enter West Coast Relays
## Stanford Stands Chance Of Winning Unlimited Division on Saturday 
### 
With last week's win over the j
Olympic Club safely stowed away, ;
attention on Angell Field these days
turns toward the future, and in par
ticular the near future West Coast
Relays at Fresno next Saturday.
Strange to say, with U.S.C. also on
the entry book, Stanford stands I
ready to take a considerable score |
at Fresno, and without undo sur
prise could win the unlimited divi
sion.
Nimmo Is Key Man
Much of the Cardinal success will j
depend on Chuck Nimmo's medical J
treatment, as he is needed in two !
long distance relays to make certain j
Stanford wins. Nimmo has a strain- i
ed calf muscle that is hindering his j
workouts; Doc Roth started him J
under the baking treatment yester- j
day.
Outstanding practice yesterday j
was Warren Dixon's 1:57 half, j
while Jim Kneubuhl took 9.9 after |
running three or four run-through I
hundreds.
