# History Instructors Play Good Baseball
## 
### Bill Moses 
Stanford's history instructors are I
great on battles. Waterloo, Gettys- |
burg, Trafalgar—they teach them all.
But better still, the Farm's history
instructors fight their own battles— i
on the baseball diamond.
Their present baseball team was
formed when the sophomore history
teachers challenged and trounced
the frosh instructors. Both sides had
so much fun that they decided to
enter intramural competition. Men
from both departments made up the
first-string, which has played sev
eral campus organizations.
Students Amused
Many of Stanford's history stu
dents were amused when their
teachers were beaten by the Japa
nese Club, 20-6. They were con- !

vulsed. however, when they heard
that the Japanese boys apologized
profusely every time they struck
out their instructors.
According to Western Civilization
Instructor Beverly McAnear, there
are some expert ball players on this
history team. "Mac" said that Har
old Fisher, associate professor of
Russian History, used to play quite
a bit of semi-pro baseball several
years ago. Wallace Sterling was an
important cog in the University of
Toronto's baseball machine.
Spalding a Star
Another star on the history team
is Frosh Instructor Merril Spalding,
who was the captain of the Phi Beta
Kappa baseball team at Harvard.
Instructor Harold Bradley has had
much baseball experience as a base
ball coach and as a player on a
Pomona College team.
