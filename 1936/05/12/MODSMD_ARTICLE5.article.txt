# Bids For Prom Sell Rapidly
## Decorations Will Feature Red, Silver, White 
### 
Nearly one-third of the 400 bids
for the Junior Prom May 22 had
been handed over the A.S.S.U. office
counter for $3.75 apiece when sales
closed at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon.
Chairman Frank Taylor urged
early purchase of the tickets, since
record sales to date indicate the
supply might be exhausted this
week. The number of bids is strict
ly limited to 400, to avoid crowding
the Pavilion.
Connie Gertmenian, head of the
programs committee, announced that
the Prom novelties will feature red
leather covers, with silver foil and
white bond trimming. The programs
will be distributed at the door.
The appearance of Jimmy Dorsey
and his swing band of radio, stage
and record fame has attracted noted
musicians and orchestra leaders
from all parts of northern Califor
nia, Taylor said. The Junior Prom
will be one of Dorsey's two exclu
sive engagements on the Coast be
fore he leaves for the East.
