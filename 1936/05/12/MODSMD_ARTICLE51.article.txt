## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Purification of Politicos by Exposure Better Than Fermentation in the Dark 
### 
A novel idea, expressed in today's Vox Cam
pi, suggests that if The Daily buried its beagle
in the mud a la ostrich, there would not be so
much dirty politics on the campus.
"Politicos and politics, however, are better
off in the depths; when dragged out to be puri
fied, it all too often happens that they thrive on
publicity as a food, and multiply like rabbits,"
the writer claims.
The utilitarian motive of stimulating reader
interest in a subject that heretofore has habitu
ally been shushed at Stanford except for sub
caucus discussion admittedly prompted The
Daily last week to begin publishing information
on whatever political odors wafted into the
office.
But The Daily mingled this with a slightly
idealistic philosophy, based on the theory that
the student body has a right to know what goes
on behind the scenes.
Clear-cut "issues" in campus politics are too
unimportant to be useful in the annual rat-race
for the various student elective offices. Hence,
it, is "inevitable" that there be some other basis

' for adjudging the candidates' qualifications.
The Daily does not mean to imply that the
judgment must be on a Hall-Row basis, or on
any certain basis; but The Daily does believe
| that it should be on some intelligent basis.
Furthermore, perhaps because of a puritanical
background, The Daily believes that any fla
grant machine maneuvers, vote trading, or se
cret nominations by their nature tend toward
corruption in government, and is naive enough
. to suppose that the student electorate is entitled
to known as much as possible about each can
didate's place in the made melee of caucuses
and counter-caucuses.
Although it feels the sarcasm, The Daily
thanks you, Joe Comic Spirit, for your so-gra
cious flattery: "Mercilessly, accurately, com
pletely, The Daily has dragged machines,
straight tickets, committee - hounds, and other
unassorted bugaboos from the sordid depths of
quiescence, and turned the purifying ray of pub
-1 licity upon them."
But we hesitate to concede that befuddling or
i ignoring the issues or facts ever helped to
j arrive at the ultimate solution of anything.

off in the depths; when dragged out to be puri
fied, it all too often happens that they thrive on
publicity as a food, and multiply like rabbits,"
the writer claims.
The utilitarian motive of stimulating reader
interest in a subject that heretofore has habitu
ally been shushed at Stanford except for sub
caucus discussion admittedly prompted The
Daily last week to begin publishing information
on whatever political odors wafted into the
office.
But The Daily mingled this with a slightly
idealistic philosophy, based on the theory that
the student body has a right to know what goes
on behind the scenes.
Clear-cut "issues" in campus politics are too
unimportant to be useful in the annual rat-race
for the various student elective offices. Hence,
it, is "inevitable" that there be some other basis

' for adjudging the candidates' qualifications.
The Daily does not mean to imply that the
judgment must be on a Hall-Row basis, or on
any certain basis; but The Daily does believe
| that it should be on some intelligent basis.
Furthermore, perhaps because of a puritanical
background, The Daily believes that any fla
grant machine maneuvers, vote trading, or se
cret nominations by their nature tend toward
corruption in government, and is naive enough
. to suppose that the student electorate is entitled
to known as much as possible about each can
didate's place in the made melee of caucuses
and counter-caucuses.
Although it feels the sarcasm, The Daily
thanks you, Joe Comic Spirit, for your so-gra
cious flattery: "Mercilessly, accurately, com
pletely, The Daily has dragged machines,
straight tickets, committee - hounds, and other
unassorted bugaboos from the sordid depths of
quiescence, and turned the purifying ray of pub
-1 licity upon them."
But we hesitate to concede that befuddling or
i ignoring the issues or facts ever helped to
j arrive at the ultimate solution of anything.
