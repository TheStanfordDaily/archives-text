# A
						New Testament For Frosh Bible Is Needed

Ex Committee probably will decide tonight
who is to get the 50 bucks for editing this year's
Handbook or Frosh Bible. While it is deciding
that, it might be a good idea for the student leg
islators to determine what he is going to edit.
The familiar little red schoolbook that is
handed out is plainly a failure as a means of
explaining to Stanford freshmen what is what
about Stanford. Its treatment of the Honor Code
is scattered, incomplete. Its value as a guide
book to student life is hindered by limited treat
ment, and the fact that the essential information
is evaded or buried under a mass of A.S.S.U.
Constitutions and by-laws.
Granting that the A.S.S.U. Constitution must
be printed in a handy form, why should the
major portion of the Frosh handbook be de
voted to this? Freshmen, who have no interest
in it, get copies; upperclassmen, who have, can
not get a copy unless they put up a good story
at the A.S.S.U. office.
Either the A.S.S.U. should print its Consti
tution and detailed matter in a subordinate posi
tion, possibly as an appendix, or else print two
different handbooks,
