# A 						New Testament For Frosh Bible Is Needed

### 
Ex Committee probably will decide tonight
who is to get the 50 bucks for editing this year's
Handbook or Frosh Bible. While it is deciding
that, it might be a good idea for the student leg
islators to determine what he is going to edit.
The familiar little red schoolbook that is
handed out is plainly a failure as a means of
explaining to Stanford freshmen what is what
about Stanford. Its treatment of the Honor Code
is scattered, incomplete. Its value as a guide
book to student life is hindered by limited treat
ment, and the fact that the essential information
is evaded or buried under a mass of A.S.S.U.
Constitutions and by-laws.
Granting that the A.S.S.U. Constitution must
be printed in a handy form, why should the
major portion of the Frosh handbook be de
voted to this? Freshmen, who have no interest
in it, get copies; upperclassmen, who have, can
not get a copy unless they put up a good story
at the A.S.S.U. office.
Either the A.S.S.U. should print its Consti
