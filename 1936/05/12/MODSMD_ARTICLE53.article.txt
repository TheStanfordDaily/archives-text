# Some Questions About The Smaller A.S.S.U. Groups
## 
### 
Eob Gros, near the end of a year in the office
of student manager, has had an opportunity to
observe- the income and expenditures of every
student organization that has a dollar or more
in its treasury.
Now, through a new budget-checking pro
gram, he is calling everyone of the organizations
out in the open where all may hear and asking
them to tell just why they need the money they
get and what they intend to do with it.
If doubt as to the "economic soundness" of
any student organization budget exists, light
may be shed on it in the manager's hearings.
But there is many a student organization be
sides those which rely on A.S.S.U. funds. These
include the many "honorary" and "profes
sional" societies whose financial business is
admittedly their own except when the time
comes for passing out the "gravy" money-mak
ing concessions, and when fat initiation fees
are collected without specific information as to

| what they will be used for.
What about the budgets of these organiza
i tions? Nothing could more clearly indicate the
| justification or non-justification for the many
minor groups than an innocent but open
; "check" such as the one being applied to the
major organizations now.
Every prospective member of a student hon
! orary should know the answers to these ques
| tions:
1. What is the purpose of the group?
2. How expensive is membership?
3. What is being done to promote the pur
! pose?
j 4. How are the funds being spent?
The god-father of all student organizations—
the A.S.S.U.—could begin to furnish these an
swers by widening the scope of its newly in
stalled open "checking" program.
