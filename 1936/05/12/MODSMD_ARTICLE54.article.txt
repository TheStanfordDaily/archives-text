Tolerance

(From tlie Daily Illini)
There are a lot of things every student should have
learned after having been at the University for four
long years. But of all the traits and characteristics
that he should have been able to pick up there is none
that .should be so universal as TOLERANCE.
It surely mu.st be a stupid individual who has lived
on the campus for that longlh of time and during
these years of unrest and indecision who has not
progressed any farther than seeing in one direction
and has not learned to walk to one side of every
problem and viewed it from the side.
Tolerance consists mainly of the ability to dis
tinguish gray from black and white and the willing
ness to admit that if one's judgment was infallible he
would no longer be a human being.
Intolerance consists of one-half ignorance and one
half conceit. It is the woof and warp of foolish strife
and wasted energy. It. shows itself in the blind ac
ceptance of the words of the majority or the strong
and in the persecution of ihe minority and the weak.
Tolerance, on the other hand, realizes that nothing
has sprung full-flowered and complete on this world
of ours. It recognizes that those things that we so
highly value—democracy, Christianity, fraternity, and
all their kin—were once the dreams and hopes of a
few persons who were generally believed "pixillated."
Tolerance will not say that a social theory is
wrong simply because it is foreign, although it may
reason that it does not fit. our needs. It will not say
that an individual is a fool because he does things that
the mob will not do, although it may say that it is
not for the good of the mob to do as the individual did.
TOLERANCE it is the one lesson that every
university student should learn.
