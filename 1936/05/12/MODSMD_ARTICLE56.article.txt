I don't wish to appear unduly touchy on the sub
j ject, but I wish that people would kindly quit con
-1 gratulating me on yesterday's colyum. Yesterday was
I the women's edition of The Daily. A sweet woman
wrote the column according to her desserts. And if it
was so damn good, you can congratulate her, you
, dopes.
In support of their candidate for Senior president,
a Phi Psi called the Alpha O house to ask for a vote
in the Row caucus. The Alpha O's hemmed and
hawed, said they'd think it over, and would call
later. When the call came, the Alpha O's said yes,
! they'd support the Phi Psi's candidate, if they'd give
the Alpha O's a signed statement guaranteeing them a
committee head appointment. Well, the Phi Psi's
| hammed and hawed and said they'd promise the ap
pointment, but they wouldn't give them a signed
statement, and asked them why they wanted one.
Said the Alpha O's, "We promised to support Wally
! Brooke for Student Body President last year in re
j turn for a committee appointment, and we didn't
get one."
Hashman Frank Fullenwider's suggestion for an
| all-hasher's caucus to nominate the candidate for an
, Economy party, is an excellent one indeed. All loyal
hashmen will agree that there is a need for drastic
reduction of expenditures, cauci, politics, candidates,
and offices. The hashers know they have a strategic
position in a revolution, because the first place to
strike is the food supply and that seconds count. The
question arises, though, do we want an aristocracy?
It is true that the hashers control the food supply,
but the cook controls the hashers. I do not think that
America is yet ready for Oriental despotism.
Syllabus fees are out today, and so am I.
Firehorse Leviticus, hasher to the Chi O's, got
birded by his hashees the other day because he was
always around, but didn't, come over for breakfast.
I The smokehouse kid explained that he was dazzled
! by the appearance of so much negligee so early in the
morning and begged to be excused. The gals accused
him of being a mid-Victorian, so what should happen
the next day, but Levit turned up the next morning
for breakfast, dressed in a long, flannel nightie.
