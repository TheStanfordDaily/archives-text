## ONE OF THE OLDER PROFESSIONS 
### 
Perhaps the celestial catalogue of
sins is so pitifully incomplete be
cause God hud to be arbitrary to ,
finish his world-making in six
days.
How unfortunate that his lexicon
of verboten should include only one

representative of
th e letter "P,"
when there is an
other so similar
and to us so much
more important.
The word, of
course, is Politics
— and not the
Lord, himself,
could save a poli
tician from being
stoned in the
market place.

We imagine
even the mercy of heaven would be
withheld from the heinous sinners j
who sell themselves not for money j
but for votes, get where they're go
ing and stay there by virtue of an ;
inhuman play upon their own luck
and the failures of the luckless.
Stanford has them now, and if
they are not sinners against God
they are certainly sinners against I
society.
# * *
Now in the day when Moses, en- I
raged by worship of the golden calf, i
smashed the God-given command- 1
ments, there was police work j
pronto from on high.
But since Mr. Jeans and Mr. Ed- 1
dington have moved the celestial
blue-coats too far from this little I

earth, perhaps we'd better not wait
for the justice mother told us comes
to all wrong-doers.
We'd better set up our own courts, .
without benefit of clouds and sera
phims, to pass judgment on these |
"pore damned souls" who juggle the
eternal verities with such abandon.
# * *
No use in doing it right now. Let's
wait a week, with some judicious
spying and hold our own
judgment day at the ballot box.
It could be a wow, even though j
we didn't have big stage effects like |
heavenly, thunder and Gabriel l
sounding off with a choir.
Without making specific requests !
that campus politicians go to Hell,
j we could consign them ihere by the
I inexpensive and simplified process
| of, casting votes. True, it wouldn't ;
be a rip-snorting classical hell, but |
it would be a good imitation, Stan- !
ford's elephantine memory being
what it is.
* * *
Unfortunately, we have no "ter
rible, swift sword" to dispense with
! the whole messy business, but in our
meek human way we have at least
a legal pocket knife to cut Stanford
loose from the human barnacles at
present fouling its bottom.
If we follow the dictates of con
| science, not those of immediate ex
| pediency, we could for all time lift
| the eyes of embryo politicos to
| where the Farm stores its grapes of
j wrath, and give one and all a
damn good look.

Now in the day when Moses, en- I
raged by worship of the golden calf, i
smashed the God-given command- 1
ments, there was police work j
pronto from on high.
But since Mr. Jeans and Mr. Ed- 1
dington have moved the celestial
blue-coats too far from this little I

earth, perhaps we'd better not wait
for the justice mother told us comes
to all wrong-doers.
We'd better set up our own courts, .
without benefit of clouds and sera
phims, to pass judgment on these |
"pore damned souls" who juggle the
eternal verities with such abandon.
# * *
No use in doing it right now. Let's
wait a week, with some judicious
spying and hold our own
judgment day at the ballot box.
It could be a wow, even though j
we didn't have big stage effects like |
heavenly, thunder and Gabriel l
sounding off with a choir.
Without making specific requests !
that campus politicians go to Hell,
j we could consign them ihere by the
I inexpensive and simplified process
| of, casting votes. True, it wouldn't ;
be a rip-snorting classical hell, but |
it would be a good imitation, Stan- !
ford's elephantine memory being
what it is.

Unfortunately, we have no "ter
rible, swift sword" to dispense with

meek human way we have at least
a legal pocket knife to cut Stanford
loose from the human barnacles at
present fouling its bottom.
If we follow the dictates of con
| science, not those of immediate ex
| pediency, we could for all time lift
| the eyes of embryo politicos to
| where the Farm stores its grapes of
j wrath, and give one and all a
damn good look.

Perhaps the celestial catalogue of
sins is so pitifully incomplete be
cause God hud to be arbitrary to ,
finish his world-making in six
days.
How unfortunate that his lexicon
of verboten should include only one

representative of
th e letter "P,"
when there is an
other so similar
and to us so much
more important.
The word, of
course, is Politics
— and not the
Lord, himself,
could save a poli
tician from being
stoned in the
market place.

We imagine
even the mercy of heaven would be
withheld from the heinous sinners j
who sell themselves not for money j
but for votes, get where they're go
ing and stay there by virtue of an ;
inhuman play upon their own luck
and the failures of the luckless.
Stanford has them now, and if
they are not sinners against God
they are certainly sinners against I
society.
