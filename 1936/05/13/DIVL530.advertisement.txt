w c've been studying anatomy again and
ARCHER is the result — a revolutionary
design in shirts exclusive with Arrow.
Tailored to flatter broad shoulders, ta
pered to the waist; and most important —
bilateral seams deftly curved in to con
form to the declivity in the arch of the
back, then distended over the seat and
curved in again. No blousing in front —
no creeping up in back. In white and
fancy patterns. Sanforized-SHrunk. $2.50
