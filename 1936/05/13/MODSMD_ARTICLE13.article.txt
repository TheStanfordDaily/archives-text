### 
Today is the deadline for students j
interested in joining either Cardi- I
nals, Activities Council, or Rally
Committee to have conferences from i
1 to 3 o'clock in the A.S.S.U. office.
Dick Stark, ex-head yell leader;
Phil Coghlan, chairman of Rally
Committee; and Dotty Sweet, worn- |
en's committee, will confer with po- |
tential members.
Because of the recent revision of 1
A.S.S.U. by-laws affecting Cardinals
and Rally Committee by providing !
for more sophomore members, there |
will be more lower division open- i
ings next year. There are 30 vacan- >
cies to be filled on Rally Committee, j
six on Cardinals, according to j
Coghlan.
Interviews are not tryouts, merely |
efforts to discover the student's
abilities and experience.
Applicants should be prepared to
list their high school and college J
offices. Appointments will be an- j
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
