## 
### 
By crowding extra bleacher seats j
into the Pavilion, 30 tickets to Nel- i
son Eddy's campus concert are still i
on sale, according to Concert Series j
Manager Naomi Carpenter.
Starting at 8:20 o'clock tonight,
Eddy's concert will include Jo
hannes Brahms' "Vergebliches
Staendchen," "Pilgrim's Song" from
Tschaikowsky, '"Du bist so jung" by
Erich Wolff, and two selections from
Richard Strauss. The baritone will
be assisted by Theodore Paxson at ;
the piano. »
Since his recent successes in
"Naughty Marietta" and "Rose j
Marie," the singer is remembered j
more often as a famous film star, j
forgetting* that he has also made a |

| distinguished reputation for himself
i in both oratorio and opera, and has
| sung with many of the symphony
orchestras of the country.
Eddy began his career in Phila
delphia just about the time of the
great crash in Wall Street when
prices tumbled in art as well as in
i commodities. There he was popular
in recital and opera, but so far as
the country in general was con-
I cerned he was unknown.
Coming West, he matched his
eastern successes with new triumphs
— and after one appearance at the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditor
ium, when the audience demanded
18 encores, he attracted the atten
! tion of Hollywood with the result
I that is now motion picture history.
