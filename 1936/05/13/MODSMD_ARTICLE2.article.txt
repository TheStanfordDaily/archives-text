# Debators Query War Possibility
## Grayson, Marcus Claim War Is Unavoidable 
### 
Claiming that a war was not a
World War without the United
States, San Jose debaters James
Cooper and George Downing last
night tried to convince Bobby Gray
son, Gerald Marcus, and radio lis
teners that the U.S.A. is not to be
bull-dozed into another armed con
flict.
Marcus, first speaker for the af
firmative, arguing that another
World War is inevitable, based his
stand on the fact that the world to
day has lost its confidence in the ex
isting state of international relations.
He divided principal powers into
two groups: (1) the static, those
which gained by the last World War
and consequently are satisfied with
Ihe status quo, and (2) the dynamic,
those which are not satisfied.
Grayson reasoned that we are so
economically bound together with
the rest of the world that in order
to maintain any trade at all we
would be compelled to enter a con
flict should it arise. To stay out
would mean to become utterly eco
nomically dependent, with Fascism,
the "greatest threat to peace," the
most inevitable result.
The negative stated that the Unit
ed States would not enter a Euro
pean conflict because (1) there is
not a lack of security that we could
remain neutral and at the same time
safe, (2) war propaganda would not
be effective again.
The United States is the largest
exporter of lumber and products of
lumber in the world.
