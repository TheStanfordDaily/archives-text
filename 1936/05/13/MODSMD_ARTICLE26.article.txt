# Ex Committee Passes Plan For Assembly
## All â€“ A.S.S.U. Meeting To Alleviate Hall-Row Split Favored by Row Group 
### 
An all-A.S.S.U. assembly, to en
able the campus to sec candidates
for every elective position, will be
held Thursday, decided Ex Com
mittee last night. The hour will be
11 o'clock if possible, and if vetoed by
the Public Exercises Committee
will be 4:150 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
The suggestion was submitted by
the Row representatives, meeting
en masse, in a resolution which
stated:
"Although a similar measure has
been previously voted down by Ex
Committee, representatives of the
Row would like to go on record as
favoring an all-University as
sembly for the purpose of introduc
ing the candidates not only for Ex
Committee and A.S.S.U. ofiices but
also every other elective position.
"It is our opinion that such a
procedure would do a great deal
to alleviate the Ilall-Row split
and allow the student voters to
cast a more intelligent ballot.
"Hall support was voiced by
Chick Franich, whose opinion was
that "A day assembly at 11:00
would be a very fine think as
compared to an assembly at night
in which students have shown
little or no interest."
