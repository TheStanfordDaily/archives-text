### Gray Croveling 
$«00 FROM 600 SENIORS
A grayed man, convinced that he
was no "erudite speaker," spoke to '
a handful of blank-faced seniors i
last week in 214. The man was a I
retired' New York physician who is j
now devoting his time to the promo- !
tion of the Stanford Fund—an en- |
dowment for the general improve- j
ment of the university. He is Dr. |
Harry Reynolds, '96.
He gave the Class of '36 the op- i
portunity to be the first class to !
contribute to the fund. He dwelled j
sentimentally for 20 minutes on the \
devotion of Mrs. Stanford to her 1
school. A woman bereft of son and ]
husband fought against what must
have seemed to her to be all the j
difficulties in the world. She sold j
her jewels to stock the library with !
liooks. She fought "like a Stanford ;
football team in the shadow of its
own goal posts," Dr. Reynolds told j
the seniors, "to keep her school j
from failing.
"Such devotion of a founder i
toward liis school is unparalleled," \
!)r. Reynolds continued. "John
Harvard gave a few thousand dol
lars and some hooks to start the j
greatest university in the United i
Stales. Hut the gift was casual. !
' meant no great sacrifice, and
little devotion. So it was with
l.'liliu Yale. He gave a plot of
ground and a little money, neither
of which he ever missed. And yet
each year the alumni of Yale and
Harvard give $100,000 to their
alma maters."
"If devotion is any yardstick, then
Stanford men ought to give millions
each year. They have-a greater!
heritage of sacrifice and love than ;
;.ny university men in this country."
The good doctor had the members
of his audience eating out of his
hand and ready to go forth and
preach the gospel of "A dollar from
every senior." But he broke the
snell he had created by bringing
the fund into the realm of cold
hearted, cold blooded business.
He said, "If the Class of 1936 |
doesn't contribute 100 per cent to ]
this fund, you might as well turn the ;
money over to the assistant comp- |
troller to be used any old way the
University wants to. It's bad busi- i
ness not to have the best possible I
precedent, and, if only 60 per cent !
contribute, next year the Class of I
'37 won't feel that it has to go the j
limit. They would give only a pid
dling sum, as would the classes to
follow and the fund would lose
terribly. No sir, if you want to have !
the honor of being the first grad
uating class to contribute to thej
Stanford Fund, you've got to come
through all the way, or else we'll
just wait until next year, or the ]
year after, or the year after that— i
until we can get a 100 per cent class. |

It s bad business to get just part |
of what we could get!"
But even the good doctor's breach
of public speaking etiquette—going i
from warm sentiment into cold
finance; first pleading, then chal
lenging—will not keep those seniors i
who heard him from donating (heir |
dollars. They heard a worthy mes
sage and probably would give $5
apiece if (hat amount were necessary
to make up the total of $600 from the
Class of 1936.

of what we could get!"
But even the good doctor's breach
of public speaking etiquette—going i
from warm sentiment into cold
finance; first pleading, then chal
lenging—will not keep those seniors i

$«00 FROM 600 SENIORS
A grayed man, convinced that he
was no "erudite speaker," spoke to '
a handful of blank-faced seniors i
last week in 214. The man was a I
retired' New York physician who is j
now devoting his time to the promo- !
tion of the Stanford Fund—an en- |
dowment for the general improve- j
ment of the university. He is Dr. |
Harry Reynolds, '96.
He gave the Class of '36 the op- i
portunity to be the first class to !
contribute to the fund. He dwelled j
sentimentally for 20 minutes on the \
devotion of Mrs. Stanford to her 1
school. A woman bereft of son and ]
husband fought against what must
have seemed to her to be all the j
difficulties in the world. She sold j
her jewels to stock the library with !
liooks. She fought "like a Stanford ;
football team in the shadow of its
own goal posts," Dr. Reynolds told j
the seniors, "to keep her school j
from failing.
"Such devotion of a founder i
toward liis school is unparalleled," \
!)r. Reynolds continued. "John
Harvard gave a few thousand dol
lars and some hooks to start the j
greatest university in the United i
Stales. Hut the gift was casual. !
' meant no great sacrifice, and
little devotion. So it was with
l.'liliu Yale. He gave a plot of
ground and a little money, neither
of which he ever missed. And yet
each year the alumni of Yale and
Harvard give $100,000 to their
alma maters."
"If devotion is any yardstick, then
Stanford men ought to give millions
each year. They have-a greater!
heritage of sacrifice and love than ;
;.ny university men in this country."
The good doctor had the members
of his audience eating out of his
hand and ready to go forth and
preach the gospel of "A dollar from
every senior." But he broke the
snell he had created by bringing
the fund into the realm of cold
hearted, cold blooded business.
He said, "If the Class of 1936 |
doesn't contribute 100 per cent to ]
this fund, you might as well turn the ;
money over to the assistant comp- |
troller to be used any old way the
University wants to. It's bad busi- i
ness not to have the best possible I
precedent, and, if only 60 per cent !
contribute, next year the Class of I
'37 won't feel that it has to go the j
limit. They would give only a pid
dling sum, as would the classes to
follow and the fund would lose
terribly. No sir, if you want to have !
the honor of being the first grad
uating class to contribute to thej
Stanford Fund, you've got to come
