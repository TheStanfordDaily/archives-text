# Big Brother Acts As Shirley's Nursemaid
## 
### Margaret Loud 
"It doesn't feel different being a
celebrity's brother." That's how
Shirley Temple's brother Jack, now j
a Delta Chi here at Stanford, sums
up the way his sister's fame has af
fected him.
"Our family lives pretty much the
same as it did before Shirley
reached stardom except for being a
good deal busier," Jack insists, j
"Only Mother's and Shirley's lives
have been changed much.
Presents Given Away
"Shirley's popularity did affect
me when my special job was taking |
care of her fan mail, though," said
Jack. "Once the letters, which av
erage from one to four thousand a
week, were stacked a yard high on
my desk—and all the time I was
trying to get through Santa Monica
J.C. so that I could come to Stanford.
At Christmas time it took three days i
to open all her presents; most of j
them were given to a children's i
home.
"Besides answering Shirley's mail
I used to play nursemaid to her I
too," Jack laughed — "wheel her j
around the block and curl her hair." j
Shirley Tutored
Shirley does the things that any i
normal seven-year-old likes to do, j
her brother declares. When she's i
making a picture, she has to re- \
hearse her lines before bedtime. But i
she has lots of time to play when
she's on the set and she takes regu- '
lar school work from a private tutor. |
She learns dramatics, arithmetic, j
reading, spelling, and French.
Little Miss Temple is very crit- !
ical of her own performances. "You j
know, I co .ild have done that scene
better," Jack has heard her remark I
when she's previewing her films.
Likes Mickey Mouse
Her favorite star is Mickey Mouse, I
and she goes to see all his pictures.
Of other cinema actors, she prefers I
Jimmy Dunn, who has played her J
"daddy" in several pictures. Bill
Robinson, the negro tap dancer who ,
taught her steps for (he ' Little |
Colonel," is another of her best
friends.
She has playthings from all over i
the world, 15 or 20 of them Shirley i
Temple dolls. Right now her favo- j
rite toy is a red and white Stanford
dog, which Jack gave her for her

birthday a week ago.
One of Shirley's pet hates, accord
ing to Jack, is the crowds that fol
low her around. "That kid's not
spoiled, but she sure knows what the
score is," he declares proudly.
