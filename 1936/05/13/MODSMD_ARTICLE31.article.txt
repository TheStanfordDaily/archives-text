# Row Politicians Back Assembly For Candidates
## Houses Band Together In Effort To Inject Idealism Into Campus Politics 
### Solon O. Swampum 
Idealism suddenly entered politics |
yesterday, and of all places centered '
in that center of liberty, equality, i
and fraternityâ€”the Row.
Row representatives, meeting yes- i
terday to hash over campaign tac-

tics, seized upon
an idealistic idea |
advanced by l
Women's Confer- 1
ence and the'
sophomore class,
when they re- J
solved to back an i
all-University as- j

sembly in which each candidate for I
office would be presented.
"This would do a great deal to '
alleviate the present Hall-Row i
split," they decided, after (hey had '
finished their discussion of ways j
and means to get Row students to j
vote a straight ticket in next week's j
A.S.S.U. elections. "It would put !
voting on a basis other than straight j
Hall or Row support, and would
make balloting more intelligent ;
than if has been in the past."
Ken Livingston, last year's inde- j
pendent spell-binder, recently raised |
this idea of an all-University as- i
sembly as a nominating caucus. Re
flective members, with a knowledge j
of how people get elected to Ex
Committee, voted it down.
Women's Conference, with a pret- i
ty idea about politics, formed a pre- j
liminary nominating committee and ,
saw its recommendations severely I
maimed in the Hall and Row cau
cuses, though everybody agreed it i
was a good idea.
The Hall sophs formulated another '
pretty idea about forming a Hall-
Row nominating machine "next j
year or sometime. But Brain
Riddel! has not yet offered to sacri
fice this year's newly-nominated i
candidates "for good ideas."
The New Idealism of the Row, is
not for a joint Hall-Row caucus,
however. The Row is quite satis
fied with their nominees. They
merely wish to introduce their can
didates to an all-University As
sembly. And the Row cannot be ac- I
cused of picking candidates without
a good stage appearance. Reynolds
and Holloway, and Mallet are de
baters, and D'Evelyn is not exactly
an unsmooth man.
Says Alf Brandin, acting chairman j
of the meeting: "Political fepling this
year seems to be more intense than
ever before. This is the best plan we j
can propose to alleviate it fairly."
