# May Chappie Is Out Tomorrow
## All-round Editions, Cover To Be Featured 
### 
The Chappie which goes on sale
at 8 a.m. on the Quad tomorrow
will not only bear a cover drawn
by Rodell Johnson, aminent artist
cartoonist, exclusively for the Stan
ford Chaparral; but will be the first
issue within recent years to be a
regular all-round number, not de
voted to anything in particular.
The galqxy of contributors which
have made all Chappies thus far
brilliant successes return to the
pages of this May number with the
cTeam of their wit and humor.
Jim Copp's "How To Drive a Car"
settles that problem once and for all.
The article is helpfully diagrammed
by the author.
