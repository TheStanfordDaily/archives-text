# LEAVE GOD OUT OF IT

The Editor, Sir:
Dear Mr. Eisenbach:
What a strange mixture of a cam
; pus commentator and a religious en
thusiast you are. In your article
yesterday on campus politics you
j mentioned the word "politics" once
\ and the word "politician" three times
! and filled the rest of the Bull Ses
i sion with mysterious references to
"Moses and the God-given com
mandments," "mercy of heaven,"
"Gabriel," and something about a
I choir.
With all your celestial wisdom,
Mr. Eisenbach, you don't seem to
realize that politics is a very real
subject and doesn't belong in the
realm of heaven. How can we "bull"
about such an article when most of
us have to take out the Holy Bible
| to understand what you are talking
j about. We admire your vocabulary
' and your knowledge of the Lord's
I opinion of politicians but how much
more we would admire your clearly
I expressed convictions.
After all, are Stanford politicians
j "heinous sinners"? Are they not
S politicians simply because they are
I more interested in student affairs
than the others? Anyway, we are
j the ones to answer these questions,
1 so let's leave God out of it.
