Don't you think we're paying too
j much attention to the propound
( hjgs of the Great Authority, whose
j already fabulous ego is soaring with*
I every letter mentioning his name?
I Pardon me, but haven't you found
it true that a fellow who hud any
thing usually got his date sooner or
later, and was found glad to get it
after lie had it? And that the ones
who were really worth going out

because one of us girls already had
a date?

didn't measure up usually ran
around hollering the Stanford wom
en were stuck-up, afterwards.'
