PRANK NORDELL
VISITS FARM

Distinguished visitor to the cam
jjlas yesterday was Frank Nordell,
distance runner and New York
U. graduate.
Nordell only a few months ago
made the headlines when he
starred in the eastern indoor meets
witli good mile and two-mile times.
He also recently set the Canadian
mile record at 4:14.4.
The big fellow said one big rea
son for coming oul West was to find
some good thick milkshakes. '"Norm
Bright and Elroy Robinson and the
other California runners who came
East for the indoor meets told me so
much about those shakes that 1 just
had to come out and try them. All
you get back in New York is a bottle
of milk and a small scoop of ice
cream."
He added that the reason he only
took 16 laps for his workout yester
day was that he had just guzzled a
couple of downtown shakes and
didn't feel so good.
His usual workout is to run six
laps, rest, run six more, rest, and
run still six more. Which makes 18
laps, a total of 4 1 :> miles every after
noon to look forward to.

His feet are another interesting
feature—they tiike size 13 track
shoes—the same size that Boh
H.avey, the Cal miler, wears. This
phenomena is a big problem to him
all winter, as he can't get the regu
lation indoor .spikes and has to got
along with smooth soles. And com
ing out to California the luckless
guy lost his wallet and all his mon
ey, and had to walk the streets of
San Francisco for a week before
funds came from home. But in that
week on the pavements his size 13's
got plenty blistered.
He is on the Coast chiefly to find
out about an aviation job. He is
interested in the air travel business
and seeks a transport pilot commis
sion.
As to future plans, Nordell is go
ing to keep training and try to
make the Olympic team in the 3000
meters steeplechase.
TIIE FRESNO RELAYS are up
again and on for this Saturday
night. Stanford's team is entered in
full and may have a chance at the
championship. The obstacle, of
course, is the four-deep Trojan
team.
The Cards have good chances of
winning the two-mile and medley
relays, the shot, discus, high jump,
• lid high hurdles. They have a
luch better all-round balanced
team than last year, with several
good men in every event, whereas
last year there were the old faithful
individual stars.
Chuck. Nimmo holds the key to the
championship. If the little fellow
runs in both of the afore-mentioned
relays the Cards can win.

starred in the eastern indoor meets
witli good mile and two-mile times.
He also recently set the Canadian
mile record at 4:14.4.
The big fellow said one big rea
son for coming oul West was to find
some good thick milkshakes. '"Norm
Bright and Elroy Robinson and the
other California runners who came
East for the indoor meets told me so
much about those shakes that 1 just
had to come out and try them. All
you get back in New York is a bottle
of milk and a small scoop of ice
cream."
He added that the reason he only
took 16 laps for his workout yester
day was that he had just guzzled a
couple of downtown shakes and
didn't feel so good.
His usual workout is to run six
laps, rest, run six more, rest, and
run still six more. Which makes 18
laps, a total of 4 1 :> miles every after
noon to look forward to.

His feet are another interesting
feature—they tiike size 13 track
shoes—the same size that Boh
H.avey, the Cal miler, wears. This
phenomena is a big problem to him
all winter, as he can't get the regu
lation indoor .spikes and has to got
along with smooth soles. And com
ing out to California the luckless
guy lost his wallet and all his mon
ey, and had to walk the streets of
San Francisco for a week before
funds came from home. But in that
week on the pavements his size 13's
got plenty blistered.
He is on the Coast chiefly to find
out about an aviation job. He is
interested in the air travel business
and seeks a transport pilot commis
sion.
As to future plans, Nordell is go
ing to keep training and try to
make the Olympic team in the 3000
meters steeplechase.
TIIE FRESNO RELAYS are up
again and on for this Saturday
night. Stanford's team is entered in
full and may have a chance at the
championship. The obstacle, of
course, is the four-deep Trojan
team.
The Cards have good chances of
winning the two-mile and medley
relays, the shot, discus, high jump,
• lid high hurdles. They have a
luch better all-round balanced
team than last year, with several
good men in every event, whereas
last year there were the old faithful
individual stars.
Chuck. Nimmo holds the key to the
championship. If the little fellow
runs in both of the afore-mentioned
relays the Cards can win.
