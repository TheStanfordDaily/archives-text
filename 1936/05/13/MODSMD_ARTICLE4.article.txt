# Interfraternity Picks Members
## Three New Men To Serve For Full Year Term 
### 
Three student members to the In
terfraternity Board were elected last
night by the Interfraternity Council
in a meeting at the Delta Chi house.
Jack Day, Delt, Bob Hall, Beta,
and Bill Newsom, Fiji, were the
three men chosen from the nominat
ing list. These men will serve the
entire year on the board as con
trasted with the previous method of
having a split term.
From the nominations for the fac
ulty members on the board a group
of six men was selected whose
names will be presented to Dr. Wil
bur. He will make the ultimate se
lection of two men after having in
vestigated their respective qualifica
tions. One of the men will serve for
two years and the other for only one
as faculty members of the board
have staggered tenures of office.
The Interfraternity Board will
meet at the Phi Delta Theta house
tomorrow for lunch.
