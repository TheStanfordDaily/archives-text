# Needham Trains For Olympic Swim Tryouts
## Stanford Star Makes 20:43 In 1500 Meters; Keating Is Chief Competition 
### 
Winfield Needham, Stanford's sole
hope for the 1936 Olympic swim
ming team, churned through his
first time trial for his chosen event,
the 1500 meters, yesterday after
noon in the creditable time of 20:43.
As a basis for comparison, Mediea
of Washington won the event in the
N.C A.A. meet at Yale last March
with 20:23.7. Hoyt of Yale was sec
ond with 20:51, and Woodford of
Ohio and Barnard of Michigan fin
ished close up in a little over 21
minutes.
O.C. Threat
All these men will probably be
facing Needham at Providence, R.1.,
in July if he passes the first barrier
Sunday when he swims at the sec
tional Olympic tryouts at the
Fleishhacker pool in San Francisco.
Dick Keating, "the idol of San
Francisco" as he's been lauded these
past few weeks, will provide the
main competition at the sectional
tryouts for the Stanford yearling. In
the three times Keating and Need
ham have met, only once has the
Olympic ace won â€”and then it was
by a finger-tip in a 220, a distance
really too short for Needham.
Rider To Swim
Coach Nort Thornton is not ex
pecting Keating to provide quite as
much of a race as city authorities
predict, for, though in the two times
Needham has beaten him the mar
gin of victory has been only a few
inches, they have never faced each
other in a distance over 500 yards.
Needham has an amazing faculty of
getting better the further he
swims!
Keating's best time for the dis
tance is 21:20 made in a long course.
Dave Rider, sophomore distance
man who has been giving varsity
fans a surprise this year, will also
be entered in the tryouts at 2
o'clock Sunday.
Needham is expected to do the
distance in something around 21
minutes flat, the extra time being
allowed for the difference the longer
course will make. Instead of swim
ming in a 25-yard tank making 04
turns as at Encina Pools, 1500 meter
contestants will have to swim a 50-
meter straight-away.
