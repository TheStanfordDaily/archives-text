demands of workers for job as
surances when the ferries stop, or
for retirement wages.

Two witnesses who refused to testi
fy were cited for contempt today
in San Francisco as the Grand
Jury turned its attention from in
vestigation of police graft to
burglary charges against three
officers. Those cited were Mrs.
Emma Hoertkorn, wife of Police
Captain Thomas Hoertkorn and
her son, Harold, an accountant
who refused to answer questions
regarding Hoertkorn's finances.
