## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" It's Tough Enough to Keep Athletics Respectable Without Alumni Butting In 
### 
If a college athletic coach loses the major
portion of his games in any one year, can this
be taken as prima facie evidence that he is an
incompetent coach and must be discharged?
Should a coach be placed on the same tenure
basis as any other faculty member, or should
the body that hires him be given year-by-year
power to fire him at will?
These questions have caused a crisis in policy
that has threatened in the last few months to
demolish Stanford's Board of Athletic Control;
the clash has been only temporarily settled by
a tentatively accepted compromise between Ad
ministration leaders and alumni representatives
on the Board.
The alumni B.A.C. men hold out for one-year
re-appointments for all Stanford coaches; fac
ulty members and the Administration believe
the contracts should be on a tenure basis of
three or five years, as is the case with directors,
assistant, and associate directors of other Uni
versity departments; student members have
been divided.
To side with the alumni would be to indorse
the howls that are raised by the betting sup
porters of nearly every sports-minded college.
The yapping of alumni wolves—which is per
ennially recurring in the middle of every Uni
versity of Washington football season, which

was responsible for a change in gridiron com
mand at California 18 months ago, and which
sprang up at U.S.C. when Howard Jones lost
a few consecutive games—can become fatal to
intercollegiate sports.
But particularly is it a menace if the alumni
are given a chance each year to assert their
power over the personnel of a university's
athletic staff. If a coach is given a reasonable
amount of time to produce a winning team and
still doesn't come through, there may be some
slight excuse for alumni who have lost small
fortunes in bets on their alma mater to begin
their bellows.
But a check can mean but one
thing: the alumni are intruding where they
have no business.
Coaching efficiency, just as any teaching effi
ciency, is perceptibly dulled if the coach is
under constant pressure to win, and if he is
continually worrying about the re-appointment
that may never come. Instead of training men
to be capable athletes next year, he must make
the most of what he has this year.
College athletics is facing a tough enough
fight to keep itself on something of an amateur
basis. But the fight is practically impossible
when alumni butt in and tell the coach how to
run his team, which is apparently the chief rea
son for insisting on a year-to-year appointment.

have no business.
Coaching efficiency, just as any teaching effi
ciency, is perceptibly dulled if the coach is
under constant pressure to win, and if he is
continually worrying about the re-appointment
that may never come. Instead of training men
to be capable athletes next year, he must make
the most of what he has this year.
College athletics is facing a tough enough
fight to keep itself on something of an amateur
basis. But the fight is practically impossible
when alumni butt in and tell the coach how to
run his team, which is apparently the chief rea
son for insisting on a year-to-year appointment.
If a college athletic coach loses the major
portion of his games in any one year, can this
be taken as prima facie evidence that he is an
incompetent coach and must be discharged?
Should a coach be placed on the same tenure
basis as any other faculty member, or should
the body that hires him be given year-by-year
power to fire him at will?
These questions have caused a crisis in policy
that has threatened in the last few months to
demolish Stanford's Board of Athletic Control;
the clash has been only temporarily settled by
a tentatively accepted compromise between Ad
ministration leaders and alumni representatives
on the Board.
The alumni B.A.C. men hold out for one-year
re-appointments for all Stanford coaches; fac
ulty members and the Administration believe
the contracts should be on a tenure basis of
three or five years, as is the case with directors,
assistant, and associate directors of other Uni
versity departments; student members have
been divided.
To side with the alumni would be to indorse
the howls that are raised by the betting sup
porters of nearly every sports-minded college.
The yapping of alumni wolves—which is per
ennially recurring in the middle of every Uni
versity of Washington football season, which

was responsible for a change in gridiron com
mand at California 18 months ago, and which
sprang up at U.S.C. when Howard Jones lost
a few consecutive games—can become fatal to
intercollegiate sports.
But particularly is it a menace if the alumni
are given a chance each year to assert their
power over the personnel of a university's
athletic staff. If a coach is given a reasonable
amount of time to produce a winning team and
still doesn't come through, there may be some
slight excuse for alumni who have lost small
fortunes in bets on their alma mater to begin
their bellows.
But a check can mean but one
thing: the alumni are intruding where they
have no business.
