# Chappie's Gone Garver And Hansen One Better
## 
### 
Chaparral yesterday brought to the campus a
brand new idea in the field of business—an
idea which is novel, revolutionary, although,
of course, not understandable.
For a long time, the profs have droned about
what a nasty thing the economy of scarcity was,
but nobody did anything about it until a plan
was evolved in the Chappie office which may
make economic history.
The plan, as far as anybody can figure, is
this: as an attempt to stimulate interest of the
business manager in the production of a better
magazine rather than only a better profit, it en
deavors to show him how he can make a better
profit by spending more money on the maga
zine.
The method is simple, in every sense of the
word: for every 80 bucks the business mana
ger soaks in the magazine he salts away 15
bucks for himself. This of course will continue
until the magazine gets more and more wealth
and grows larger and better while the business
manager sets aside a bigger and bigger profit
for himself.
Student Manager Bob Gros cannot figure it
out, nor can the A.S.S.U. accountants, but the
Chappie men maintain that they can under
stand it even if they can't explain it.
The reason that Gros and the accountants
can't understand it is that they are rooted in
the old tradition of division of profits— not divi

sion of expenditures. The Daily, rooted in no
particular economy at all, merely doesn't un
derstand it.
Chaparral undoubtedly has a plan which is
unique. No one can deny that. But the effi
ciency of the thing depends wholly upon those
Chappie boys who work the system. After all,
they're the only ones who understand the prac
ticability of the plan.
In response to recent "gripes" that Phi Phi,
National Senior Men's Honor Fraternity, had
been discriminating against Hall men, Phi Phi
officials last night pointed out that the organi
zation had never intentionally discriminated
against non-Row seniors, but that the national
constitution provides that all Phi Phi members
must be members of a college social fraternity.
