I was waiting around to see if Solon 0. Swampum
would carry this story in his political column, but
seeing his utter failure to get this important tidbit,
I shall have to carry on, or carrion, as some of the
boys laughingly call it.
It seems that an earnest young Deegee political
whipmaster was proposing the nomination at the Row
caucus of another earnest young Deegee for the post
nf senior woman on Ex Commitich. She got up and in
a very fiery manner stated that her candidate had been
on The Daily and on Women's Council and "had a
lot of opportunities for experiences that most of these
other girls haven't had."
The caucus got up and rolled on the floor.
A few minutes later, Ludlug, the ringmaster, got
up and rolled over to the earnest young Deegee and
said that her earnest young candidate did not have
enough units, according to the Bawlout, for the office.
While ihc earnest young Deegee was explaining,
some wiseacre in the back row got up, rolled on the
floor, and stage-whispered: "She was so busy having
those experiences that she didn't have time to get
her grades."
Along about this time of year the wits down in the
Law School have their annual fun with the A.S.S.U.
nomination box by the Law Steps. This time it is
Buck Van Dellen for Roblc sponsor.
To got away from politics and off into an intellec
tual discussion, I shall tell a story about the S.A.E.
formal, which is a dance. It seems that an S.A.E.
from. California, who is a brother of a Gamma Phi
Beta from Stanford, came down to the dance, and
double dated with an S.A.E. from Stanford, who
spends his spare time managing the S.A.E.-Dorsey
Prom. Now this is all pretty clear, particularly when
you come to realize that the Gamma Phi Beta who is
a sister of the S.A.E. from Cal dated with the S.A.E.
from Stanford. This made it very cosy.
But it seems that Brother McGlassawhitch from
Cal got one or two extra glassawhitches, and it was
determined that it was best for Brother McGlassa
whitch to recuperate the rest of the evening in the
5.A.81 infirmary.
So the S.A.E. from Stanford took the brother of
his date home and put him in one of the S.A.E.
beds, leaving a note 011 the door for the dispossessed
brother:
Please do not kick McGlassawhitch out of bed.

It seems that an earnest young Deegee political
whipmaster was proposing the nomination at the Row
caucus of another earnest young Deegee for the post
nf senior woman on Ex Commitich. She got up and in
a very fiery manner stated that her candidate had been
on The Daily and on Women's Council and "had a
lot of opportunities for experiences that most of these
other girls haven't had."
The caucus got up and rolled on the floor.
A few minutes later, Ludlug, the ringmaster, got
up and rolled over to the earnest young Deegee and
said that her earnest young candidate did not have
enough units, according to the Bawlout, for the office.
While ihc earnest young Deegee was explaining,
some wiseacre in the back row got up, rolled on the
floor, and stage-whispered: "She was so busy having
those experiences that she didn't have time to get
her grades."
Along about this time of year the wits down in the
