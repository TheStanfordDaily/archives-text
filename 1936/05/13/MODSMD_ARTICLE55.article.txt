## Senior Finals 
### 
(From the Purdue Exponent)
As the senior class dribbles out of campus activi
ties and only four weeks remain for a last fling at
college, a number of groups on the campus are doubt
ing the value of submitting graduating seniors to their
last round of final examinations. There are arguments
in favor of setting an all-campus exemption grade
which would make examinations optional for those
who are above a predetermined scholastic average,
and would make them compulsory for those who have
not maintained good scholarship during their final
semester.
After a student has passed through seven examina
tion grinds and is about ready to embark on his last
hurdle before graduation, the odds are very small
that he will not successfully meet the requirements
for a diploma. The student is no longer chiefly con
cerned with books, but rather the thought of moment
is the possibility of gaining employment when the
sheepskin has been gained.

Several members of the faculty who are in execu
tive positions have been contacted for an opinion
on the plan, and the response varied from an absolute
No to the other extreme. Many are of the opinion
that final examinations for graduating seniors are,
in the great majority of cases, unnecessary nuisances
because any student that has passed three and a half
year of work, that has gained study habits, and has
a will to learn will be rewarded with a diploma. On
the other hand, it is pointed out, the senior would be
come lax when an exemption average was in view and
actual work would cease long before class meetings
would come to an end. Also, it is argued that the
establishment of an exemption average would produce
quibbling between students and faculty over minor
points, and that this is totally absent when a small
change in the grade will not determine whether or not
a final examination is necessary.
The suggestion has received little attention so far
this yeai, but the plan i.s at least worth debate regard
ing its relative value as compared with the system
now in effect.
