# Doctor Operates On Stanford Live Oak

### Hunter Hendee 
Libe-goers may have noticed
G. H. Hughes who chisels away at
the 500-year-old querques agrifolia
(live oak to you) a freshman's
throw from the Law Steps.
Two weeks ago when Hughes un
packed his tools and went to work
he created genuine interest among
campus project-watchers. Today to
all appearances he must have given
it up as a bad job, for no activity is
visible ai'ound the big hole in the
tree's tummy and the pile of
cracked cement at the side.
Such, however, is not the case. If
you're particularly curious you can
peer down through the hole and see
him still hacking away at the fungus
down at the bottom of the tree, and
maybe whistling.
Fifteen years ago when the tree
was in need of its first major opera
tion, the University spent some
$1250 for repairs. But the cement
used was porous, and the fir.-zus
got in anyway.
A complete new job was neces
sary, and Tree Dentist Hug:â€”-
ures this one to be completed on or
about June 1 at the cost of less than

| $500.
Overhauling will consist of pipe
l lines to get antiseptic "rnouth-wash-

es" down to infected parts, seven
yards of sand and concrete ar
ranged with flexible joints to allow
for movement of the tree and for the
bark to grow over the patches, felt
lining between the wood and ce
ment so disinfectants may be prop
erly distributed on. the inside, and j
steel braces to hold the trunk to
gether.
"The tree can't stand another, op- j
eration like this," says Hughes, slap- |
ping the trunk less than 6 inches |
thick at the base, "so I've got to do
a first class job this time." Then he .
stops, looks at the thin foundation, ;
and chuckles. "After all, a tree like
this has got to have more than just i
its reputation to stand on."
