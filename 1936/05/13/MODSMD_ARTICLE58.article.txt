# Bull Session..
## THE 						LOTTERY DOLLAR 
### 
Yesterday the second installment
fell due. But a lot of us forgot and
as a result some few $2 fines are
passing across the counter today.

j Now the sylla-
J bus fees them
j selves are a good
j thing. Every
i course passes out
{ varying amounts
I of supplementary
i material at vary
| ing costs. And if
' a lump sum were
! tacked on to the
[ original $115,
! some of us would
! get chiseled to the
benefit of others.

j UUIiCIH U1 UUIVIO,
The fees can't be collected on regis
, tration day because so many stu
j dents change their study lists.
* * #
But this $2 fine is a minor menace.
It's on the books to provide us with
j incentive to pay up on time and not
| hold up the financial machinery.
1 However, it could be done away
j with and the University wouldn't
i lose if it would heed an impish idea
, that was seen silting atop the
I cashier's cage in the Ad building
I whispering, "I am the lottery dol
| lar."
* * «!
I We have the Union dollar, the Pa
j vilion dollar, and the Theater dol
i lar. Now if the University wished to
, inject a sporting element into its
1 registration day activities, it could
tack on another dollar (to be known
as the Lottery dollar) which would
j entitle every student to a ticket in a
j tuition lottery. A drawing could be
held and the student with the
lucky ticket would get all his tui
; tion back. Of course that would
! only be $110 return on a $3,800 in
; vestment so it would be best if two
: or even three drawings were held
I and two or three "checks made pay
, able" were rewarded as prizes.
* » *
The benefits of the lottery would
!be mutuel though probably not
1 equally mutuel. The" University
| would be better off by about $.'),400.
but it could partially even the score
! by putting an end to these fines fol
iate syllabus fees and give us a
! week, say, to get them paid. And
I every student would have an equal
I chance of having a free ride on the
| administration for a quarter. That
' prospect would be enough to es
] tablish a first-of-the-quarter morale
the like of which has never been
| seen, and give everybody at least
one thing to look forward to three
i times a year.
