# NYA Workers Must See Mrs. Coverley
## 
### 
Undergraduates working on the
NYA must report to Mrs. Coverley
immediately on whether or not they
can finish their quota of 30 hours
by May 19.
There are still a few vacancies
open on NYA. Those planning to
work from May 20 to June 10 are
asked to report, also those who are
intending to cut their number of
hours.
