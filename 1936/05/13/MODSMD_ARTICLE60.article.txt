# Freuchen Tells Of Experiences In Greenland
## 
### 
"ARCTIC ADVENTURE," by Peter
Freuchen, N.Y., Farrar & Rine
hart, I!KiU.
Although this book is primarily a
description of personal experiences
in Greenland, its real value lies in
the personality of the author and the
vivid realistic characterization of the
natives.
There is something commanding
about the author, whose style is not
boastful, but through simplicity, di
rectness, and straightforwardness
he looms as a man of action—a man
who is positive in character and
resolute in purpose, a man who by
the very directness of his nature
wins the quick respect of those
afcout him.
The story is ihe biography of a
Dane, who tiling of the common
place of his native Denmark, seeks
adventure in Greenland.
He takes up life there not as the
superficial traveler or as the com
pletely objective scientist. Instead
he marries and native eskimo and
enters directly into the daily living
of the inhabitants. He comes to know
the people as individuals and de
scribes them with all the sympa
thetic understanding that only one
with such knowledge could. Every
page of his book is alive with their
unaffected naturalness of living and
morality.
Perhaps only one other could be
classed with Freuchen as qualified to
present such a reliable account of
the humor and pathos of these peo
ple, this person being Knud Ras

mussen. It was Freuchen's good
fortune to work with Rasmussen.
In his descriptions of their work to
gether, there is pictured one of the
finest literary portraits of true
friendship between these two men.
