# Duce Envoys Leave Council
## Italian Acts Condemned; Sanctions Continue 
### 
GENEVA, May 12 (TP). â€”A fresh
effort to build up security for un
easy Europe crumbled tonight when
the Italian delegation to the League
of Nations brusquely bolted from
Geneva at the imperative command
of Premier Mussolini.
The Fascists walked out after the
council adopted a resolution which
was virtually a new condemnation
of Italy's conquest of Ethiopia.
Asserting it needed further time
"to consider the situation," the coun
cil adjourned until June 15. Sanc
tions meantime will continue against
Italy.
Widespread pessimism also was
based on the fact that the Italians
boycotted a scheduled meeting of
the remaining Locarno powers to
act on Germany's renunciation of the
treaty.
Mussolini was reported flirting
with Adolf Hitler. Some saw Ihe
possibility of an alliance between the
two dictators.
