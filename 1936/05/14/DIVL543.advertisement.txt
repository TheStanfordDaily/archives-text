Keep your
social poise in a i
Palm Beach Tux
!
You can look as cool as a trained seal on ice, in
a Palm Beach Tux, this summer. And, what's more,
you'll be that way • One thing about Palm Beach
...it ends that mopping and sweltering that go
with heavier clothes in summer. Even a dance
with a warm number won't run your temperature
up unduly • And Goodall tailoring (exclusive in
Palm Beach) insures utmost smartness and modern
ity of lines. A white P.B.Tux with black P. B.trousers
makes a super swank combine • Same remarks
apply to Palm Beach day wear. Your clothier will
show you the new Palm Beach whites, blues, greys,
tans,etc. A two-piece suit dents your budget only
$16.75. Smart slacks, $5. Tux Ensemble, $18.50.
Always be ture to look for this
trade-marked label in the luit.
