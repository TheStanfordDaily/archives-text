# Nominees Will Give Acceptance Talks Tonight
## Failure To Attend Will Be Regarded as Automatic Declination by Board 
### 
Winds of political freedom will
blow tonight when candidates for
student government positions in the
approaching elections convene in
Room 214 to deliver brief campaign
speeches and answer open questions
from the floor.
The* assembly, which was
"founded" by the election board in
last winter's voting, is definitely
scheduled to start at 7:15 o'clock, ac
cording to Chairman Wally Brooke.
Attendance Compulsory
Attendance is compulsory for all
candidates, and any nominee fqr
A.S.S.U., Ex Committee, or B.A.C.
positions who do not appear will be
considered as having automatically
declined his nomination.
Approval for the assembly, which
is open to all students, was granted
in Tuesday night's Ex Committee
meeting at the request of Row rep
resentatives. The latter, in explain
ing their purpose, stated:
"It is our opinion that such a pro
cedure would do a great deal to al
leviate the Hall-Row split and allow
the student voters to cast a more
intelligent ballot."
Day Hour Proposal Fails
Efforts were made to arrange the
meeting for a day hour, but Public
Exercises Committee vetoed pro
posals to dismiss 11 o'clock classes
so that students could convene at
that time. An afternoon hour was
also discarded as impractical.
Each candidate will be introduced
to the assembly, after which he will
give a three-minute outline of his
platform. Room 214, the largest lec
ture room on the campus, has seat
ing accommodations for 341 persons.
