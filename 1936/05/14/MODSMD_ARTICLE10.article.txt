# Senior Orders Due May 15
## Saturday Is Last Day To Get Announcements 
### 
Saturday is the last day for or
dering senior announcements and
programs in time to have the former
delivered May 25, the latter by
June 1.
Engraved personal cards may also
be ordered at the A.S.S.U. office for
$2.50 per 100, including the copper
plate. There is a choice of style in
these cards.
The programs are to be of white
leather with a silver and black steel
etching of a Quad scene and plainly
embossed class numerals. Inside will
be a list of senior week activities,
class committees, and a list of the
graduates. Between the pages are
inserted photographs of campus
scenes.
The formal graduation announce
ments are printed on the inside of a
French fold, and the outside is deco
rated along the same lines as the
program.
Senior dues are payable at $1.50
until May 15, after which date they
will be $2. They may be paid from
10 to 12 o'clock at the post office
today and tomorrow.
