lof programs. Not telling where he
I is staying on his trip north, he gave
as a reason that his audiences have
"funny ways of showing their love,"
to add further to his troubles. There
fore he usually "hid out."
Mr. Eddy carried no good-luck
charms, and holds no superstitions,
because, he explained, if you start,
you have to carry them through
every phase of your life, and that is
a little too much.
"No, I am not sorry I gave up
j journalism," he said. "However, if
i anything ever happens to my voice,
i I shall probably go back to it. I
| like it."
Offering the information that he
did not prefer blondes, brunettes, or
redheads, he stated that information
saying as much was merely the
complexion of the individual wom
i en reporters who wrote his "pref
erences." His own hair, whether
powdered or not I couldn't tell —
I looked slightly on the greyish side,
i His mother, looking very proud, was
; the only person admitted to his
dressing room after the concert be
gan.
Mr. Eddy did not appear con
ceited. His nervousness didn't show
other than a jerky raising and low
ering of his leg to a chair, but he did
what he was going to sing, he al
| look cool and collected. When asked
j ways used the term "we" in his an
swers. And his answers were
i usually "no."

"I like Ihe pavilion; you shouldn't |
hold basketball games iti here!" That '
is what Nelson Eddy said of the ;
Stanford Basketball Pavilion last
night after his first selection. Lik- j
ing student audiences to begin !
with, he said they are the most re- !
sponsive and warmest of listeners
to sing to.
Proof of this was shown in ihe
ovation he received before he was
given a chance to sing. "However,
(his is not a case of an actor mak- j
ing a personal appearance," Mr. !
Eddy explained. "This is a concert |
and therefore I shall probably not
sing 'Rose Marie' or 'Indian Love
ChlI 1 tonight.
Thus he answered inquiries con- 1
cerning his performance and selec
tions scheduled to sing. Giving an
interview before the concert, Mr. ,
Eddy said he had not looked at the
Pavilion at all. He was most gra
cious. His speaking voice was full, ,
warm, and resonant. He said he was ,
not afraid of stage fright—which he >
experienced early in his Career quite
often—but he did admit he was
more than . a little nervous, even
then. Each program brought new
responsibility, he explained.
Having no preferences as to the
stage or screen, he remarked that
whatever he was doing at the lime, |
he liked best. Friday night's con- |
cert to be given at San Jose will
end a four months' tour and series I
lof programs. Not telling where he

responsibility, he explained.
Having no preferences as to the
stage or screen, he remarked that
whatever he was doing at the lime, |
he liked best. Friday night's con- |
cert to be given at San Jose will
end a four months' tour and series I
lof programs. Not telling where he
I is staying on his trip north, he gave
as a reason that his audiences have
"funny ways of showing their love,"
to add further to his troubles. There
fore he usually "hid out."
Mr. Eddy carried no good-luck
charms, and holds no superstitions,
because, he explained, if you start,
you have to carry them through
every phase of your life, and that is
a little too much.
"No, I am not sorry I gave up
j journalism," he said. "However, if
i anything ever happens to my voice,
i I shall probably go back to it. I
| like it."
Offering the information that he
did not prefer blondes, brunettes, or
redheads, he stated that information
saying as much was merely the
complexion of the individual wom
i en reporters who wrote his "pref
erences." His own hair, whether
powdered or not I couldn't tell —

Mr. Eddy did not appear con
ceited. His nervousness didn't show
other than a jerky raising and low
ering of his leg to a chair, but he did
what he was going to sing, he al
| look cool and collected. When asked
j ways used the term "we" in his an
swers. And his answers were
i usually "no."

"I like Ihe pavilion; you shouldn't |
hold basketball games iti here!" That '
is what Nelson Eddy said of the ;
Stanford Basketball Pavilion last
night after his first selection. Lik- j
ing student audiences to begin !
with, he said they are the most re- !
sponsive and warmest of listeners
to sing to.
Proof of this was shown in ihe
ovation he received before he was
given a chance to sing. "However,
(his is not a case of an actor mak- j
ing a personal appearance," Mr. !
Eddy explained. "This is a concert |
and therefore I shall probably not
sing 'Rose Marie' or 'Indian Love
ChlI 1 tonight.
Thus he answered inquiries con- 1
cerning his performance and selec
tions scheduled to sing. Giving an
interview before the concert, Mr. ,
Eddy said he had not looked at the
Pavilion at all. He was most gra
cious. His speaking voice was full, ,
warm, and resonant. He said he was ,
not afraid of stage fright—which he >
experienced early in his Career quite
often—but he did admit he was
more than . a little nervous, even
then. Each program brought new
