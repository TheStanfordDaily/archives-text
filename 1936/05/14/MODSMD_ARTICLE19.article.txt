# A.S.U. Defended; No "Red' Affiliations
## Gerber Explains Student Union Organization

"We are prepared to prove that
William Randolph Hearst and his
bunch are nearer to Berlin than the
American Student Union is to Mos
cow," Serril Gerber, national field
representative of the A.S.U., told
the Daily yesterday.
Gerber, a small, black-haired,
genial young man, was on the cam
pus yesterday arranging details of
the Northern California conference
| of the Union to be held in the
! Women's Clubhouse at 2MO tomor
! row afternoon.

"Stanford, from what I can tell, is
; somewhat behind other colleges and
I universities where liberal student
i groups are concerned," he said. "But
j the whole West Coast is lagging be
; hind eastern campuses as to student
j thinking in united groups."
Berkeley is a notable exception,
he explained. The A.S.U. at Cali
| fornia is one of the strongest and
| most active in the country.
The American Student Union, ex
| plained Gerber, was organized last
i January out of a merger of two
national organizations and hundreds
of smaller campus groups. Its na
| tional headquarters are in the East,
■ where student action is most in-
I fluential.
Majority Movement
"Our program is no longer of the
! minority," he asserted. "Last month
j when 700.000 college students joined
! the A.S.U.-sponsored peace strike,
our movement became one of the
majority. We feel that two-thirds of
j the country's college students are
with us."
Where college liberal groups are
! most active, the motivating factor is
| strong leadership, Gerber said. At,
j California, liberal organizations
I formed three or four years ago are
united under the A.S.U. banner and
} are therefore much stronger than
! the comparatively new and weak
| group at Stanford.
Stanford May Be Alone
"With the majority of American
| students actually thinking about
j these problems of peace, security,
; racial equality, and student-faculty
freedom, Stanford's liable to find it-
I self 'out in the cold,' alone," Gerber
asserted. "But I think after the
j movement is really started here,
j thinking and action will he aroused
as it has on the majority of the
campuses of the land."

; racial equality, and student-faculty
freedom, Stanford's liable to find it-
I self 'out in the cold,' alone," Gerber
asserted. "But I think after the
j movement is really started here,
j thinking and action will he aroused
as it has on the majority of the
campuses of the land."
"We are prepared to prove that
William Randolph Hearst and his
bunch are nearer to Berlin than the
American Student Union is to Mos
cow," Serril Gerber, national field
representative of the A.S.U., told
the Daily yesterday.
Gerber, a small, black-haired,
genial young man, was on the cam
pus yesterday arranging details of
the Northern California conference
| of the Union to be held in the
! Women's Clubhouse at 2MO tomor
! row afternoon.
Stanford Behind
"Stanford, from what I can tell, is
; somewhat behind other colleges and
I universities where liberal student
i groups are concerned," he said. "But
j the whole West Coast is lagging be
; hind eastern campuses as to student
j thinking in united groups."
Berkeley is a notable exception,
he explained. The A.S.U. at Cali
| fornia is one of the strongest and
| most active in the country.
The American Student Union, ex
| plained Gerber, was organized last
i January out of a merger of two
national organizations and hundreds
of smaller campus groups. Its na
| tional headquarters are in the East,
■ where student action is most in-
I fluential.
Majority Movement
"Our program is no longer of the
! minority," he asserted. "Last month
j when 700.000 college students joined
! the A.S.U.-sponsored peace strike,
our movement became one of the
majority. We feel that two-thirds of
j the country's college students are
with us."
Where college liberal groups are
! most active, the motivating factor is
| strong leadership, Gerber said. At,
j California, liberal organizations
I formed three or four years ago are
united under the A.S.U. banner and
} are therefore much stronger than
! the comparatively new and weak
| group at Stanford.
Stanford May Be Alone
"With the majority of American
| students actually thinking about
j these problems of peace, security,
; racial equality, and student-faculty
freedom, Stanford's liable to find it-
I self 'out in the cold,' alone," Gerber
asserted. "But I think after the
j movement is really started here,
j thinking and action will he aroused
as it has on the majority of the
