# Ten Encores Sung By Eddy
## Technique of Accompanist Pleases 
### Barbara Sweet 
Thrilling his audience with his
full, mellow voice and winning per
sonality, Nelson Eddy, famous bari
tone, last night left a packed Pa
vilion with the crowd still calling
and stamping for him.
Throughout the varied program,
Eddy exhibited depth and fullness
of tone, as well as perfect control
of his voice. His clear diction was
especially pleasing, although his
outstanding ability as a pantomimist
made even his German selections
perfectly comprehensible.
So enjoyable and well-received
were all the numbers that it is dif
ficult to cite any particular one as
the best. "Du bist so jung!" by
Erich Wolff, and "Route Marchin',"
by George Chadwick Stock, a bal
lad of the Kipling type, met with
enthusiastic approval. The ever
popular "Ah Sweet Mystery of
Life" was the last of his ten encores.
Mr. Paxson's selections were also
outstanding. He played with a sensi
tive, sure touch that was more than
excellent technique.
