WASHINGTON. May 13 (/P). â€”
Tariff cuts by the United States and
a liberalization of French quotas on
American goods are features of the
new Franco-American trade treaty,
details of which were published to

The pact was signed May 6 as a
further step in the Roosevelt re
ciprocal trade program. The agree
ment does not require the consent of
the Senate.
"Luxury" Tariffs Cut .
In the swap, the United States
agreed to cut tariffs up to 50 per
cent on 77 items, including certain
wines and brandy, lace, and other l
"luxury" goods. *
Among 44 products on which
France agreed to allow increased or
new quotas were fresh apples and
pears, leaf tobacco, canned salmon, j
some makes of automobiles andl
parts, logs and lumber, silk hosiery,
and agricultural machinery.
Summary of Agreement
Summing up the agreement, the
State Department said that French '
concessions have a direct bearing j
upon one-fourth of America's ex- 1
ports to that nation, while one-third
of the French imports here are af- j
fceted.
"Our two republics," Secretary i
Hull said in a statement, "have 1
given the world a vivid demonstra- '
tion of their firm determination to
go forward in a vital effort toward
a liberalization of commercial rela
tions everywhere."
