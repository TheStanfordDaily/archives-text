Nominations for A.S.S.U. and

o'clock, when Election Chairman

ballot box and legally entered sfl
students in competition for the 23
vacancies in the political finals
j Tuesday.
I Activity yesterday netted 45
nominations, three times the num
ber submitted in Tuesday's ballot
ing.
Declinations I)ue Today
Nominees who wish to discon
tinue their campaigns may register
formal declination with the election
| board today from 9 to 6 o'clock, Lud
i lam said. Names of those who do not
take this action will be permanently
placed on the election lists.
Outstanding among the unexpect
ed turns in the nominating proced
ure, according to campus observers,
was the failure of the Phi Delta
Theta faction to officially enter its
protege, Wes Muller, for the posi-
S tion of B.A.C. representative.
i
, Muller, Absence Unexplained
No explanation was given for the
situation, in spite of the fact that
Muller received strong support in a
i number of Row caucuses.
The comparatively large number
of "independent" nominees listed in
j yesterday's balloting indicated the
j alleged united voting power of the
j two major interests, Hall and Row,
might be split among several candi-
I dates.
