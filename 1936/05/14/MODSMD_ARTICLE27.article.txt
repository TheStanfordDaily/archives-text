### Les Squires 
Ofte Stanfoid day!
Our Tiny starts to pound the keys,
And figures out an Esquire slant,
Instead of boys in b.v.d.'s
He'll train his words to win and
and score.
There's one place Tiny simply can't
Depend on Moscrip's toe once more.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The ladies roar in Vox Campi,
And pray for any man at all,
But please, oh please, a perfect guy,
With looks and dough and eyes
for me.
And then, oh please, do let him fall,
And let me be the apple tree.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The Chappie figures out a plan
To graft upon their printing shop
The money tricks of Uncle Sam;
The college boys have learned with
vim
That here's the rule to reach the
top—
The more you spend the more you
win.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
With nothing much to say or do,
The Seniors meet to plot and plan
The same old gift or something new.
The campus leaders now decide
That just as long as man is man,
Our politics will smell inside.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The Row decides on men to back,
As hall men ponder on the way
To cut the aces from their pack;
In fact, the picking of the slate,
Is just a game we like to play.
All hail our democratic state!
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The steel work starts at last to rise
Where Stanford hams will rave and
rant;
The derricks stab the ageing skies
To prove that drama marks the
sight
Where dramatists will stage their
cant
And lovers bold will toast the night.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The ladies fill up all the seats
To hear the songs of Nelson Eddy;
The track is rutted by the cleats
As tracksters stretch their muscles
tight;
The graduates insist they study
And pound the books on Friday
night.
One Stanford day!
LONDON, May 13 (/P).—Frederick
H. Field, a deserter from the British
army, was convicted today of kill
ing a 48-year-old woman "just be
cause I wanted to murder someone"
and sentenced to death.

Where dramatists will stage their
cant
And lovers bold will toast the night.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The ladies fill up all the seats
To hear the songs of Nelson Eddy;
The track is rutted by the cleats
As tracksters stretch their muscles
tight;
The graduates insist they study
And pound the books on Friday
night.
One Stanford day!
LONDON, May 13 (/P).—Frederick
H. Field, a deserter from the British
army, was convicted today of kill
ing a 48-year-old woman "just be
cause I wanted to murder someone"
and sentenced to death.
Ofte Stanfoid day!
Our Tiny starts to pound the keys,
And figures out an Esquire slant,
Instead of boys in b.v.d.'s
He'll train his words to win and
and score.
There's one place Tiny simply can't
Depend on Moscrip's toe once more.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The ladies roar in Vox Campi,
And pray for any man at all,
But please, oh please, a perfect guy,
With looks and dough and eyes
for me.
And then, oh please, do let him fall,
And let me be the apple tree.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The Chappie figures out a plan
To graft upon their printing shop
The money tricks of Uncle Sam;
The college boys have learned with
vim
That here's the rule to reach the
top—
The more you spend the more you
win.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
With nothing much to say or do,
The Seniors meet to plot and plan
The same old gift or something new.
The campus leaders now decide
That just as long as man is man,
Our politics will smell inside.
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The Row decides on men to back,
As hall men ponder on the way
To cut the aces from their pack;
In fact, the picking of the slate,
Is just a game we like to play.
All hail our democratic state!
One Stanford day!
One Stanford day!
The steel work starts at last to rise
Where Stanford hams will rave and
rant;
The derricks stab the ageing skies
To prove that drama marks the
sight
Where dramatists will stage their
cant
And lovers bold will toast the night.
One Stanford day!
