Wind," "All Hail to Mr. Agrinar,"
"The Muldow," "I'm Counting Up
To Ten," "Ooh-hoo," "Enter the

Gordon has also numer
ous tunes for the last three Big
Game Gaieties, including "The Time
Seems Opportune" for the '33 show,
"Writing This Song to You," which
Fred Nagel has adopted as his theme

You Think I Don't Know," for the
'34 edition.
Last spring's "Follies Bourgeois"
contained Gordon's contributions of
"Governor's Lane," "Who Gives a
Darn," and "Just for You," which
Bob Kinney and his Del Monte or
chestra have popularized.
The '35 Gaieties last fall featured
"Wind and the Rain," "What Makes
You Think I Do," "Cardinal Red,"
and "Feelin' Good," by the' local
composer, while Fred Nagel fea
tures the song "Throw It Away" as
one of his novelty numbers.
Griff Williams, Tom Coakley, and
Frankie Masters have also from
time to time presented arrange
ments of Gordon's songs.
His musical career began at the
age of 10 when he wrote a piece
for Victor Herbert, and played a

self. As well as being one of the
original members of Barnstormers,
Gordon also belongs to Sword and
