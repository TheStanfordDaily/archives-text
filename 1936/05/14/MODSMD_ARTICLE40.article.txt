# Favorites Out Of University Golf Tourney
## Wallace Beaten; Edwards Drops from Play Due To Conflict with U.S. Open 
### 
Ihe all-University golf tourna
ment moved into the second round
today with the elimination of two of
the outstanding contenders to the
title. With their elimination one
white hope appeared.
With Don Edwards' sensationally
qualifying for the open champion
ship of the United States, he was
forced to drop from the tourna
ment as his leaving for the East pre
vents him from playing out the full
course of the tournament. Jack
Welch got a free ride to second
round as the result of Edwards' de
fault.
Manning Takes Wallace
The white hope on the horizon
was Cal Manning, number one man
of the freshman team. He shot a
score of one over par through
treacherous winds to defeat Jack
Wallace, one of the tournament fa
vorites.
Coming through in characteristic i
style, Bob Thompson stepped into ;
'he second round with a 3 and 2 j
win over Bob Edwards. Henry Ed
wards came through for that tribe
by winning from Will Todd. Jim
Dillon came through to take a 4 and
â– 1 verdict. Bill O'Neal had trouble j
getting over the experienced Jeeb I
Halaby.

Erskine Winifer

In the bottom bracket, Morse Er
skine defeated Warren Munro and
Spec Stewart took Brown Cannon
by a 2 and 1 verdict. Stewart had a
72. Stewart and Erskine will meet
in what will be perhaps one of the
most interesting matches of the sec
ond round.
Roger Pearson defeated Bill Mc-
Candles by a 4 and 3 margin to
complete the play to date.
