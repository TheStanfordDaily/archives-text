DINK. TINY PARRY
FOR PETE ZAGAR
Pete Zagar, the burly frosh ath
i lete, is causing no end of discon-
I tent these days within the coaching
staff of the University.
Pete came here from Roslyn,
Wash., last September, and played
whirlwind tackle with the frosh
football team. Then in November
| he joined the track team and was
equally whirlwindish at that.
The rub comes where the star
trackmen are practicing for the
Olympics, and spring football is be
ing played daily.
Dink Templeton wants Peter for
his personal discus tutelage, and
Tiny Thornhill wants him to play
spring football and learn the plays j
along with the rest of the grid new
comers.
And the rivalry between Dink
and Tiny is no paltry one, either,
for both are convinced that Pete
could become an all-time great in
both sports.
Pete was undoubtedly the out
standing star of last year's frosh i
football team. He blocked kicks and
intercepted passes and was a lead- 1
ing power on both offense and de
fense for the frosh.
In the brief period of 30 days or
so that he was able to sneak under
Dink's ken and play ball with Tiny's
forces, he showed more than any ;
other lineman that he would be on i
the first string next fall. He is the
smashing, crashing type of tackle ;
that stops enemy plays all by him- j
self and leaves a much lighter part ;
of the burden upon the rest of his
line mates.
But his discus tossing is no less
brilliant. In the Little Big Meet he
released the platter for a flight of
151 feet, 7 inches to outdo all of the
Jones', La hordes', Greys', and
Krenz' frosh marks.

So Dink figures Pete has a good
chance to qualify for the Olympics,
and Tiny thinks he'll be an all-
American, and the battle goes on.
DAVE RIDER wasn't much shakes
as a swimmer when he began to
train this winter but now, after only
a few months of training, he has
risen steadily and without a let-up
has built himself into possible Olym
j pics contendership.
All the publicity has been for
. Winfield Needharn, a frosh who was
a national star before he came here.
Needham is still probably a better
distance man than Rider, but Dave
is still improving rapidly and swims
j daily side by side with his more
1 famous mate and is never more than
a few strokes behind.

Pete was undoubtedly the out
standing star of last year's frosh i
football team. He blocked kicks and
intercepted passes and was a lead- 1
ing power on both offense and de
fense for the frosh.
In the brief period of 30 days or
so that he was able to sneak under
Dink's ken and play ball with Tiny's
forces, he showed more than any ;
other lineman that he would be on i
the first string next fall. He is the
smashing, crashing type of tackle ;
that stops enemy plays all by him- j
self and leaves a much lighter part ;
of the burden upon the rest of his
line mates.
But his discus tossing is no less
brilliant. In the Little Big Meet he
released the platter for a flight of
151 feet, 7 inches to outdo all of the
Jones', La hordes', Greys', and
Krenz' frosh marks.

So Dink figures Pete has a good
chance to qualify for the Olympics,
and Tiny thinks he'll be an all-
American, and the battle goes on.
DAVE RIDER wasn't much shakes
as a swimmer when he began to
train this winter but now, after only
a few months of training, he has
risen steadily and without a let-up
has built himself into possible Olym
j pics contendership.
All the publicity has been for
. Winfield Needharn, a frosh who was
a national star before he came here.
Needham is still probably a better
distance man than Rider, but Dave
is still improving rapidly and swims
j daily side by side with his more
1 famous mate and is never more than
a few strokes behind.

DINK. TINY PARRY
FOR PETE ZAGAR
Pete Zagar, the burly frosh ath
i lete, is causing no end of discon-
I tent these days within the coaching
staff of the University.
Pete came here from Roslyn,
Wash., last September, and played
whirlwind tackle with the frosh
football team. Then in November
| he joined the track team and was
equally whirlwindish at that.
The rub comes where the star
trackmen are practicing for the
Olympics, and spring football is be
ing played daily.
Dink Templeton wants Peter for
his personal discus tutelage, and
Tiny Thornhill wants him to play
spring football and learn the plays j
along with the rest of the grid new
comers.
And the rivalry between Dink
and Tiny is no paltry one, either,
for both are convinced that Pete
could become an all-time great in
both sports.
