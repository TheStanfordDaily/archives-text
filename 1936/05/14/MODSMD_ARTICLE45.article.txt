# Card Seconds Meet U.C.L.A. Poloists Friday
## First Team To Step In If Alternates Lag Behind; Scrimmage Looks Good 
### 
Captain 11. Y. Grubbs' second
team is scheduled to meet U.C.L.A.'s
j polo team on the highway field
Friday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Spurred on by three victories in
the last three weeks, the Stanford
I riders hope for an easy win Friday.
A scrimmage yesterday on the grass
! held showed that despite last week's
games on the Utah dirt field, the
i Indian poloists can still handle the
! bamboo ball on grass.
Friday the second team is offered
| the same chance that Captain
Grubbs gave them with the Black
Foxe team. The proposition is that
the seconds are allowed to stay in
the game as long as they are lead
ing. If they drop behind the first
team will be allowed to finish the
game.
The line-up will be the same as
usual with Don McAusland at one,
Bert Hyde at two, John Coffin at
three, and Ed McKeon at back.
