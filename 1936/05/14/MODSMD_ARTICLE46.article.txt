# Cindermen Drill For West Coast Relays
## 
### Phil Klauber 
For a little of the Fi •esno at- |
mosphere, the weather came blowy
yesterday out at Angell Field, and '
with half the cinderpath blowing up
the stretch, Coach Dink Templeton's
forces grabbed a lot of upwind and
downwina running practice, in case
there is air moving at the West
Coast Relays Saturday night.
Chuck Nimmo, key distance man, |
who has lost a lot of condition due
to an injured calf muscle, will
probably be capable of only place
on the four-man two-mile relay
team. His place on the medley four,
which was considered a cinch win
ner, will probably* be taken by Ed
Burrows.
Scoring in the straight track and
field events will be 5-3-2-1, while I
the relay events—44o, 880, mile, two
mile, and medley, will give double
score. As U.S.C. is clearly superior
at the sprint relay events, it is from
the longer runs and field events that
Stanford must take its score.
In these individual events—loo,
120-yard high hurdles, shot, dis-§
cus, high jump, broad jump, pole
vault, and javelin, the dopesters

will ho in top form, as Stanford has
met most of the principal competi
tion befora, in the Fresno State,
Olympic Club, U.S.C., and Califor
nia dual meets.
