## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Idealism' Might Get Students An All-University Assembly for Next Year 
### 
Because the Public Exercises Committee felt
that it did not have time to effect an all-Univer
sity nominating assembly for 11 o'clock today,
the nominating assembly will continue in the
same old stand, room 214 at 7:15 tonight.
It is too bad that the "idealism" suddenly pro
fessed by the Row campaign committee Tues
day afternoon and seconded by the "idealism"
of the Hall and of Ex Committee, did not develop
soon enough to carry out the really valuable
plan of having an all-University assembly.
It would have been a real lure to student in
terest in politics to have an all-University as
sembly, but it takes more than fire, flood, catas
trophe, or idealism to move the Public Exercises

I Committee to grant the students an all-Uni
» versity meeting, particularly when nobody got
excited enough about it to ask the committee
I more than two days in advance for the fete.
While the idealism is still warm, however, it
would be a good idea to petition the Public
i Exercises Committee for an all-University as
| sembly next year, even before it is known
j \yhich side the debaters are on.
An all-University assembly is unquestion
i ably a good idea. It may not have "alleviated
! the Hall-Row split in politics" but it would have
stimulated student interest in politics, and it
! would have shown the body politic just what—
j and how much—is running their affairs.
