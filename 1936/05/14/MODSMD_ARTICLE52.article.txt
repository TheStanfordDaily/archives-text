# Student Union Snarls But Fails to Show Any Teeth
## 
### 
"What is the American Student Union?" a
circular being spread over the campus asks.

The question is one the Farm has been won
dering about ever since short-lived "Student
Opinion" appeared. And in spite of the 500
words of explanation that appear on the cur
rent circular, the Farm is still somewhat in the
dark.
"We have held our own in the field of sport,"
the Unionists proclaim, "but intellectually we
j have been badly beaten." To elaborate on the
i point they go on to say: "We believe that the
1 average student should have more ways of in
tellectually expressing himself than are at pres-
I ent offered by Ex Committee, Men's and Wom
[ en's Councils, and dance organizations."
Now somebody must be wrong. Ex Commit
tee and the Councils don't know they are sup-
I posed to be mediums of intellectual expression.
But even if they did, whom are they supposed
I to compete with to keep from being "intellec
, tually badly beaten"? Each other?
The admitted malcontents say that campus
I elections are uninspiring and petty, that our
! officials represent factions rather than ideas.
| Considering the fact that the present elections
j have inspired at least one prominent member of
f A.S.U. to honor The Daily with several Vox
Campi contributions, and that the Student Un
ion's program spells "faction" with every word,
this statement is a bit bewildering.
When its program at Stanford is finally or
ganized, the Union may have something worth
while to offer. But the attitude—typified in its
current circular—that has characterized the local
A.S.U. chapter in its infant stages is one of a
snarling wolf backed up against a wall.
Until the Union overcomes its persecution
complex, as well as broadening its aims, it can
not hope to become the campus' intelligence
center.
