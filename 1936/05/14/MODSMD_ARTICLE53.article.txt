The American Student Union has invited a certain
Mr. Resner, former editor of the Daily Cal, which is
the monadnock of the College Dillies, over here to
morrow to expound the United Front to the Stanford
groundlings.
Unfortunate or fortunate as it may seem, it is ex
pected that to Mr. Resner Stanford will present the
United Back.
Now that we have got on the subject of radicalism,
which many say should be eradicalismed, I might as
well expound the workings of what the San Jose
Police consider a Communist cell here at Stanford.
Personally, I think it is a wet cell and should be
arrested for battery, but not the Josey Police, no sir.
It seems that two Sequoia youths have been receiv
ing informal visits from the prune city police, as the
result of a little week-end party in the junction city
of the Santa Clara valley. The boys were turned in
by certain San Jose ladies, who complained to the
police that the Stanfordites had entered their apart
ment, and then locked them out of it. The police then
started after them on the grounds that they were
radicals or Communists, or maybe both.
Well, maybe a little radical, officer, but certainly
novel, too?
According to the city papers, the last public enemy
has been captured and the G-men won't have any
thing to do but endorse cigarette ads from now on.
A Sigma Chi was out canoeing on Lagunita the
other evening, when the canoe tipped over. As the
sodden mass emerged from the mud dip, he discovered
to his sorrow that the capillary action had either ex
panded his facilities, or else his suit of clothes had
become suddenly reticent. So the sorry sight walked
home to his haven under the hill, and when he got
there he found the hosemen of local chapter No. 1
Firehouse Laddies of America shrinking down the
interior of his automobile, which had got hot pans in
his absence. When the fire was quenched, and the
Sigma Chi got to thinking over his experiences with
fire and flood, he decided that if a good first-class
hurricane came along he'd have to marry it.
One of the Deegee pledges has come down with
scarlet fever (for the benefit of the Health Service:
there is no epidbmic) and she came over to the Dee
gee house with her plague to get initiated Sunday night.
The Deegees initiated the pledge, but they didn't
know what to do with the plague, so they made it an
ex officio merhber. So all the Deegees, though not
under quarantine, must all line up in front of the
housemo'her every morning before they go to class
to get their fevers taken. The fact that the Deegees
have only one thermometer, and only one housemother,
make the situation quite desperate, plague take it.

One of the Deegee pledges has come down with
scarlet fever (for the benefit of the Health Service:
there is no epidbmic) and she came over to the Dee
gee house with her plague to get initiated Sunday night.
The Deegees initiated the pledge, but they didn't
know what to do with the plague, so they made it an
ex officio merhber. So all the Deegees, though not
under quarantine, must all line up in front of the
housemo'her every morning before they go to class
to get their fevers taken. The fact that the Deegees
have only one thermometer, and only one housemother,
make the situation quite desperate, plague take it.
The American Student Union has invited a certain
Mr. Resner, former editor of the Daily Cal, which is
the monadnock of the College Dillies, over here to
morrow to expound the United Front to the Stanford
groundlings.
Unfortunate or fortunate as it may seem, it is ex
pected that to Mr. Resner Stanford will present the
United Back.
Now that we have got on the subject of radicalism,
which many say should be eradicalismed, I might as
well expound the workings of what the San Jose
Police consider a Communist cell here at Stanford.
Personally, I think it is a wet cell and should be
arrested for battery, but not the Josey Police, no sir.
It seems that two Sequoia youths have been receiv
ing informal visits from the prune city police, as the
result of a little week-end party in the junction city
of the Santa Clara valley. The boys were turned in
by certain San Jose ladies, who complained to the
police that the Stanfordites had entered their apart
ment, and then locked them out of it. The police then
started after them on the grounds that they were
radicals or Communists, or maybe both.
Well, maybe a little radical, officer, but certainly
novel, too?
According to the city papers, the last public enemy
has been captured and the G-men won't have any
thing to do but endorse cigarette ads from now on.
A Sigma Chi was out canoeing on Lagunita the
other evening, when the canoe tipped over. As the
sodden mass emerged from the mud dip, he discovered
to his sorrow that the capillary action had either ex
panded his facilities, or else his suit of clothes had
become suddenly reticent. So the sorry sight walked
home to his haven under the hill, and when he got
there he found the hosemen of local chapter No. 1
Firehouse Laddies of America shrinking down the
interior of his automobile, which had got hot pans in
his absence. When the fire was quenched, and the
Sigma Chi got to thinking over his experiences with
fire and flood, he decided that if a good first-class
hurricane came along he'd have to marry it.
