## Men, Meet Our Pledges 
### 
(From Syracuse Daily Orange)
"Meet our pledges" parties at which freshmen of
all sororities are introduced to the campus, have be
come part of the year's activities of many western
| colleges, the University of Southern California in
particular. At these functions, men on campus are
given blanket invitations to attend a series of teas
! conducted by all sorority houses on a specified after
noon. >
Men are expected to stay 15 or 20 minutes at each
house, be introduced to the receiving line, consisting
of the house's pledges, be served and then move on
to the next house so that a large number of*meetings
may be made in one afternoon.
# * * *
; In this way pledges, new to the campus, who
j have had an opportunity to meet only a few pros
j pective escorts are able to alleviate this condition to
i some extent. Similarly, men may gain at least a
hello acquaintance with a large number of the in
coming freshmen.
From the sororities' viewpoint, such receptions
are an inexpensive yet effective means of entertaining
I fellow classmates. Many incoming freshmen lack the
•opportunity or initiative to make friends readily and
need some occasion to get a foot-hold on college life
and customs.

Freshmen women often feel a "let-down" after the
intensive rushing period when they have been the
! center of attraction. Introductions to men on campus
a few weeks after pledging would do away with this
| sensation to a large extent and keep each woman
; in contact with fraternity and college life.
With rushing pretty well finished for the year, and
plans for next year's season under way, this practice
j of western colleges is worthy of consideration by the
local Pan-Hellenic and individual sororities.
