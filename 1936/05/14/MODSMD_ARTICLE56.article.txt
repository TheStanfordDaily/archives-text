# Bull Session
## B.A.C. BEAGLING 
### 
Alumni gray and grizzled who re- !
j member the "plug uglies" like yes
i terday's American Can quotation;
; alumni gay and gangling, collegians
still, save for 180 units — all have
! "Stanford" as their hobby.

We say "Stan
ford" unadvised
ly, because hardly
are they interest
i ed in the whole i
j University.
For the Quad*
i they have tears,
as is proper for
alumni. For the
drafty classrooms!
they have a lump!
i in the throat. For'
the Ad Building

they have hard
I feelings — but for the B.A.C. they
have screams, gripes, groans, com- j
tmands and damnation.
* * #
Not for the Chapel, not for the
professors, not for Dr. Wilbur do the
| alumni breathe fire. Rather, it's for
I such mere hirelings as Tiny Thorn
hill, who couldn't possibly get the |
right man in at halfback without |
. their advice; for Dink Templeton, j
who, being only one of the world's j
best track coaches, couldn't judge j
i his material for the shot-put with- j
! out polling the Class of '0(>.
Money is at the bottom of it. ;
j Alumni begin their shoulder-bowing j
: duties when they help Joe Doakcs, !
i star tiddly-winker of Milpitas, 1
I through Stanford because Joe could
i run with a pigskin on the local high
| school team.
* * *
Now it's one thing to invest in

Joe's education, and that's all right
'cause Joe is a smart kid. But after
all, Joe is supposed to play football.
And it isn't enough for Joe to wear
a uniform and play just up to his
capacity. Joe simply must be the
Indian's star-man. Tiny Thornhill
doesn't think Joe is a star? Well,
that's too bad. Mr. Alumnus spent
his money on Joe, and he's damned
if Joe isn't going to be a star so he
can wave a cigar Big Game Day
and bellow expansively. See that
kid, I spotted him five years ago and
helped him through school.
* ¥ *
The result is that Tiny either
makes Joe a star, or else.
So far, Stanford's coaches, know
ing their rights as well as their
stuff, have held out against those
alumni who not only think they
know sports, but think they know
more than coaches do.
4 * *
Just how long they can hold out
is questionable. For alumni have
more than a finger in the athletic
pie. They are in up to their elbows,
and tucked between their clenched
fingers is much of the bankroll that
makes Stanford athletics what they
are. Just how to tactfully tell them
to go play somewhere else, leaving
their pocketbooks behind, is a tick
lish problem. But like all ticklish
problems, it simply must be solved.
* * *
Now just for the fun of it, why
don't alumni call their football
scholarship endowments, and be
content to give the money, letting
trained experts spend it.
That, in case the alumni didn't
know, is a fine solution.

Now it's one thing to invest in

Joe's education, and that's all right
'cause Joe is a smart kid. But after
all, Joe is supposed to play football.
And it isn't enough for Joe to wear
a uniform and play just up to his
capacity. Joe simply must be the
Indian's star-man. Tiny Thornhill
doesn't think Joe is a star? Well,
that's too bad. Mr. Alumnus spent
his money on Joe, and he's damned
if Joe isn't going to be a star so he
can wave a cigar Big Game Day
and bellow expansively. See that
kid, I spotted him five years ago and
helped him through school.
* ¥ *
The result is that Tiny either
makes Joe a star, or else.
So far, Stanford's coaches, know
ing their rights as well as their
stuff, have held out against those
alumni who not only think they
know sports, but think they know
more than coaches do.
4 * *
Just how long they can hold out
is questionable. For alumni have
more than a finger in the athletic
pie. They are in up to their elbows,
and tucked between their clenched
fingers is much of the bankroll that
makes Stanford athletics what they
are. Just how to tactfully tell them
to go play somewhere else, leaving
their pocketbooks behind, is a tick
lish problem. But like all ticklish
problems, it simply must be solved.
* * *
Now just for the fun of it, why
don't alumni call their football
scholarship endowments, and be
content to give the money, letting
trained experts spend it.
That, in case the alumni didn't
know, is a fine solution.
