| The Editor, Sir:
Not that I want to intrude into
I the realm of big business with my ,
j selfish suggestions, but if the Chap
pie is suffering from a surplus too
j large to cope with, why not reduce j
| the price?
I No doubt the estimable business I
i manager slaves a good part of 'his
j youth away for his mere pittance, |
1 and certainly it takes great toll of
; the energy and imagination (or hal
! lucination) of the editor, unselfish 1
I as he is in contributing so much in ;
j order to keep the magazine selling in
I —order to collect any pay.
But, I am quite positive we read- j
j ers could put up with a reduction in
price, say five cents apiece. Or, bet
j ter yet, let's operate on the success
j ful Rexall plan, one for five cents,
j two for a penny more. The extra |
j one would not be any worse than
j the first, and the price would be j
I more satisfactory in the face of all ■
the risks we deluded subscribers |
] take —never knowing when we will
be confronted with a genuine imi- '
I tation of Soglow, never certain if
I there'll be one good Chappie in the
' bunch. |
And speaking of risks, I suggest a I
Chappie maintained insurance plan
for the subscribers against these
i risks.
