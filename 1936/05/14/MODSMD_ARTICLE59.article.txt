i The Editor, Sir:
Why can't our so-called intelli
! gentsia leave the rest of the student
1 body alone? I see that the Amer
ican Student Union is to meet here
, Friday and yesterday I was Riven a
\ circular published by it.
This circular contains, on one side,
| an account of what the U»i»n is and
what it hopes to do at Stanford. The
j tone of the whole thing is imper
-1 tinent and to the effect that Stanford
jis behind the times. The article
pokes fun at our student govern
| ment, and even dares to call it. a
! machine: this is what comes of let

ting persons like Ken Livingston
write to the Daily.
What does it matter if our student
government isn't perfect? I came to
college to take courses I was inter
ested in and not to be bothered by
such unimportant matters.
