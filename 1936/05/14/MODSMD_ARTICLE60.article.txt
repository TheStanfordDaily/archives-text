# "Silly Billies Rilly Silly," Says Reviewer
## 
### 
If you want to see a really silly
show, see "SILLY BILLIES" at the i
Varsity starring Wheeler and Wool
sey, two Hollywood nuts that are

already cracked.'
And speaking of puns
it is the punniest
show yet put on the
screen.
Two nutty dentists,
guess who, come to

Little Town in a stage in whieh j
Bert Wheeler meets Dorothy Lee, j
the town's new school teacher-to- i
be, and so they fall in love. Robert 1
Woolsey smokes his usual cigar and 1
a pun comes with every smoke ring. J
After a drunk, a rendezvous with j
bad men and then Indians, and lots j
of incidents where thundering !
horses stop to give one of the j
Wheeler boys a chance to make a ,
crack, they save the townspeople '
from being massacred, find gold, and
live happily ever after. It's some !
fun, if you are in a silly mood.
Conrad Nagel is just another of |
those long forgotten actors trying to
make a comeback. It's not wholly
his fault, but rather the fault of an
other of those weak second attrac
tions, "MANDALAV (;AL." The j
plot drags, and the lines are stilted 1
—it's an awful letdown after the !
first show. —R. B. Jones
Sixty-five per cent of job failures
are due to personal peculiarities
rather than incompetence, says Dr.
Blako Crider of Fenn College.
