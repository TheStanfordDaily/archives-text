# 'Elect Preacher' Says Townsend
## Pension Leader Suggests Clergyman President 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 13 (/P).â€”Dr.
Francis E. Townsend, old age pen
sion chieftain, suggested to Ameri
can voters today that they elect a
clergyman to the presidency this
fall.
"It is high time to abandon the
idea that legislation can emanate
only from those trained in the law,"
the gray-haired physician told a
meeting of 8000 followers.
"Those who make laws are in
many instances unfit to formulate
them. There are many men of the
cloth who are good business men.
Why not this fall elect some emi
nent divine as President of the
United States?"
Predicts Arrests
Militant in the face of a congres
sional investigation, the pension
leader warned his followers that
"the most violent attacks are yet to
come."
"Arrests will be made among our
| ranks,"' he declared. "Semi-legal
| means will be found to inflict pun
i ishment by way of fines and im
prisonment until after the election."
Little Corruption
Dr. Townsend asserted "there has
been mighty little corrupt practice
in this great movement" and "the
stories told about me and my ava
rice arc manufactured packs of lies."
He said he would return to Wash
ington May 19 to tell the investigat
ing committee "what I want them to
j know."
