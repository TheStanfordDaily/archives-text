SPOIIT SHOES
An event that started last October when we had.
the chance to buy white buckskin for much less
than today's price. Now, in the height of the sea
son, we're ready with real white midi buck in a shoe
for only $5. Richer-looking and easier to clean sU^m
than any other white leathers to be had at that JhV-^
price! Popular wing-tip style with leather soles. ~jM
Splendid size range ... 6 to 12, widths A A to D
