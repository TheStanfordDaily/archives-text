world's greatest track teams and
then some competing, but there are
some relay championships, some rec
ords, and other first place positions
that will be contemplated on this
picnic.
Over 500 Entries
Entries in the relay carnival,
where high school, jaysee, and open
divisions all hold sway, have sur
passed 500, and festivities will con
tinue all afternoon and evening.
Only a few trials will be held in
the unlimited division before 7:30
at night, when the headliners go to
work.
Best Stanford bet in the relays
will be the four-man two-mile
event, where Ray Malott, Bob Alex
ander, Bill MeCurdy, and Chuck
Nimmo or Warren Dixon will go
against a favored group of Trojan
stars—Johnson, Cassin, Bush, Lantz
—in a finish match. Nimmo is still
being troubled with his leg muscle,
will probably end up by entering
only this event, where formerly he
was expected to double up in two
or three.
Next comes the medley team with
Weiershauser, MeCurdy, Dixon, and
maybe Ed Burrows running 440, 880,
three-quarters, and "a mile, with best
competition from the Olympic Club,
if Charley Hunter gets his strongest
team on the field.
Cal Favored in Mile
The mile relay is given by the
dopesters to Cal, forgetting, of
course, that Cal has lost some condi
tion with finals.
U.S.C. is favored in the sprint
relays; Templeton will enter some
combination of Dean, Tharp, Kneu
buhl, Madlem, Myers, or maybe
Weiershauser in both 440 and 880-
yard events. Weiershauser, who ran
21.8 in practice yesterday, is the best
man at any distance under 500 yards.
Captain Sammy Klopstoek and
Hunt Kingsbury in the highs and
Dean and Kneubuhl in the 100 will
probably be the Stanford entries in
the only two straight track events
on the program.

competition from the Olympic Club,

team on the field.
Cal Favored in Mile
The mile relay is given by the
dopesters to Cal, forgetting, of
course, that Cal has lost some condi
tion with finals.
U.S.C. is favored in the sprint
relays; Templeton will enter some
combination of Dean, Tharp, Kneu
buhl, Madlem, Myers, or maybe
Weiershauser in both 440 and 880-
yard events. Weiershauser, who ran
21.8 in practice yesterday, is the best
man at any distance under 500 yards.
Captain Sammy Klopstoek and
Hunt Kingsbury in the highs and
Dean and Kneubuhl in the 100 will
probably be the Stanford entries in
the only two straight track events
on the program.

Over 500 Entries
Entries in the relay carnival,
where high school, jaysee, and open
divisions all hold sway, have sur
passed 500, and festivities will con
tinue all afternoon and evening.
Only a few trials will be held in
the unlimited division before 7:30
at night, when the headliners go to
work.
Best Stanford bet in the relays
will be the four-man two-mile
event, where Ray Malott, Bob Alex
ander, Bill MeCurdy, and Chuck
Nimmo or Warren Dixon will go
against a favored group of Trojan
stars—Johnson, Cassin, Bush, Lantz
—in a finish match. Nimmo is still
being troubled with his leg muscle,
will probably end up by entering
only this event, where formerly he
was expected to double up in two
or three.
