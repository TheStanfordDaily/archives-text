Dr. Henry W. Stuart, retiring head i
of the Department of Philosophy.
Dr. Stuart received his Ph.B. f ,- om
the University of California h> i 893, j
but came to Stanford to teach in
1907. after getting his Ph.D. at Chi- j
cago, and has been here ever since.
Ethics and social philosophy have ;
been Dr. Stuart's particular fields of j
study in his 29 years at Stanford. |
Particularly for his criticism and
keen analysis of philosophical sys- !
terns and points of view has he been j
noted.
A number of students who have j
worked for their Ph.D.'s under Dr. :
Stuart have enjoyed marked success, j
due largely to his characteristic I
thoroughgoing and painstaking co- |
operation with his associates.
In 1927 he was elected president j
of the Pacific Division of the Ameri- j
can Philosophy Association.
A singular honor Dr. Stuart re- j
ceived a few weeks ago was selec- '
tion as the speaker at the annual !
Howison Lecture on Philosophy at ;
the University of California. To be |
chosen for this lecture is one of the j
highest honors accorded philoso- !
phers.
For the future Dr. Stuart has no i
definite plans. i
"I could stand a good vacation.

he says. "Then perhaps I'll write
some articles, and maybe a book on
my theories of ethics."
