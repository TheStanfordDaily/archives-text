# Campaign Talks Heard By Record Crowd At Rally
## Twenty-three Candidates Compete for 9 Offices; Ward, Dellinger Default 
### Johnson Hill 
Before a crowd which set an at
tendance record for campus polit
ical rallies, 23 students competing for
nine A.S.S.U. and Ex Committee
offices last night fired their final
campaign volleys and fell back to
await results of the election Tues
day.
Together with approximately 35
other candidates for class, council
and miscellaneous offices, the speak
ers convened in Room 214 at the
request of the election board.
Dellinger Absent
Only one student, Brower Del
linger, nominee for position of
B.A.C. representative, tell victim
to Chairman Jim Ludlam's ruling
that failure to attend the session
would constitute automatic declina
tion. Bill Ward delivered oral dec
lination of his nomination for the
office of member-at-large of Ex
Committee.
Object of strong emphasis in a
number of the campaign speeches
was a proposed investigation and
reform of the alleged split between
Hall and Row interests. The sub
ject, first raised by Bob Mallett in
his address for senior man's posi
tion on Ex Committee and later dis
cussed by others, was understood to
regard not only political activities,
but also campus life in general.
Merit Basis Proposed
Another topic introduced in the
meeting involved operation of the
nominating process on a basis of
merit in future elections. The plan
was proposed by Barbara Paine, can
didate for the office of junior woman
on Ex Committee.
Departing momentarily from rou
tine procedure, Shirley Jones termi
nated her campaign comments by
compling with a request from the
floor for an adequate definition of
swing music.
Would-Be Presidents Talk
Chairman Ludlam, introduced by
A.S.S.U. President Wally Brooke,
reserved until the final half hour
speeches by the six candidates for
the presidency and vice-presidency
of the Associated Students.

Robert E. Bernhard, Jr., aspirant
to the student body presidency,
tossed a virtual bombshell into the
assembly in a campaign tirade which
resulted in the unanswered ques
tion: "What do you think of crack
pots running for office?"

Bernhard, running on an "inde
pendent" platform, was succeeded
on Ihe speaker's stand by Chick
Franich and Jim Reynolds, sup
ported in the race for the executive's
chair by Hall and Row factions, re
spectively.

Joe Vigna signified his intention to
compete as a "write-in candidate"
for the position of B.A.C. represent
ative. Vigna's nomination ballot,
submitted after the polls had offi
cially closed, was declared illegrÂ»
under the constitution of the studei ,
government.
