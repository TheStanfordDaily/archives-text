The nov; famous Italian walk-out
from the League of Nations caused
what appeared to be, until late this
week, an impasse. But wily Paul
Boncour of France caught Baron
Aloisi as the Italian League repre
sentative was packing his shirts
and under drawers.
"You're not really leaving, Bar- \
on?" asked M. Boncour.
"Yes. Eeetalee wahnts natheeng ;
frohtn de Leege!" shouted the dap- '
per baron.
Whereupon, the eonsumate diplo- )
mat Boncour outlined a face-saving
plan that caught the Italian's ear.
It was this: to get the leading
Ethiopian chieftains to send a repre
sentative to the League and that
representative of the chieftains
would go over Haile Selassie's head
and say that Italian rule was ac- i
cepted by them and that they
thought Victor Emanuel would
make a better king than the skin
ned Judean Lion. Thus Italy would
have the word of the country that
they conquered proclaiming that
European civilization would be more
desirable to the powers of Ethiopia
than the primitive rule.
Thereby the League's work is
made easier, for the conquered loves
his conqueror, and Italy will be re
'anl' d as beneficent. It was the best
ill-around face-saver. Only a man
•ii Boncour's genius could have
bought of it.
Aloisi complimented the French- !
i.ian on the idea and wired Rome ;
- ollcct. And that, dear readers, may
i e the manner in which the league j
crisis" will be worked out.
