# ITALIAN RULE
## 
### 
No matter how well a strange peo- j
le may govern you, you, as a race, !
/ill always prefer misrule by your j
ivn people. How imperialism gets a J
i ation anywhere is hard to see. As
. A. Bailey, Stanford's No. 1 Amer
an historian, says, "A fool can put
i his pants better than a wise man
tan for him!"
The theory behind colonization is j
i have a source from which a na- j
on gets raw "material, all its wants,
ee. Then the raw goods are
; lipped to the mother country for j
lanufacture. Then the finished
roduct is sold back to the natives
i the colony for a 100 per cent
rofit. It's a very pretty scheme and
as worked for England in many
ases. But it is safe to say that the
ays of such simple economics is
one.
Italy, to follow this theory out, '
•ould have to take sand and camel's (
•ft. from Ethiopia, manufacture !
i lat into gelatin in Italy, and then
11 it to the poor blacks with the :
ogan "Ethiopia's favorite dessert!"
They could take even more sand,
ind it down to a fine quality, then
11 it back to the Ethiopians as
I 'pper, or as sand for Abyssinian
1 indorgartens.
Ah, me!
