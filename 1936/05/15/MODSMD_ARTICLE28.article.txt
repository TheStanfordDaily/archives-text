Dr. Goebels has ordered all Ger- j
•an drama critics to refrain from
riling their reviews on the same '
ght that they saw the play.
"Critics must sleep one whole
.'ght before expressing their opin- |
n on a new cinema or play," he
iys.
Practical Germans realize that
: iany critics write their stuff in the
i lue funk accompanying a good ,
how, or in the brown haze that
allows a lousy show, and the critics |
doing this are writing about the '
jood in which they are instead of
he play.
Whereas after a good night's sleep |
the critic wakes to think of the play I
itself. Well digested during the
fiours of sleep, the previous night's
performance presents itself for both
constructive and destructive criti
eism, no matter how bad or how 1
good it may have been.
