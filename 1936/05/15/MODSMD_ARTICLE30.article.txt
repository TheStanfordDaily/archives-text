THREE BOYS AND A GIRL, quadruplets, were born to Mr. and Mrs. Emil Kaspcr at Passaic,
N.J. The mother (left) was "in splendid condit ion," but physicians fought to preserve the lives of
the tiny babies who are shown, upper right, in the arms of their nurses. Lower right, the father, a
$20-a-week railroad worker, is shown with their other two children. (A.P. Photo)
