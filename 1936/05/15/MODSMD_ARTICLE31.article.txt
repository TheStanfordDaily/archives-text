# Gros Mum On Political Views
## Burrows, Vigna Split Row For B.A.C. Position 
### Solon O. Swampum 
The campus is still only half- ]
caucused, think two perplexed vot- I
[ ers.
They suggest a new addition— [
an individual Bob Gros caucus:

"While The Daily j
'is exposing how ev- j
erybody stands po
-liti c a 11 y, please
make Bob Gros ex
press himself. There
are Jots of us who
have a great deal
of respect for Gros'

clear and sound comnWn sense, and
we would appreciate his advice on
how to vote in this student election
coming up."—Two Perplexed Voters.
Gros Impartial
To which Mr. Gros replies: "I have
my own opinion, but I'm damned if
the Student Manager's office should
get mixed up in campus politics.
I've kept it impartial, and I intend
to finish with just that attitude."
The Vox Campi-ers continue that
"Gros owes it to a great many of us
who helped him y/in a couple of
close elections last year."
Won by Wide Margin
Swampum would like to point out
that winning once by 886 votes, and
the second time by 518 with five
other men up. could hardly be called
close.
Still, it's a good idea.
First the Phi Dolts failed tp nomi
nate Muller for the B.A.C. p0.4.
Then there were rumors that
Burrows was not choosing to run.
So Joe Vigna planned a write-in
campaign as Row candidate for the j
position.
Now Burrows is running. So is
Vigna. The Row will have a hard
time deciding whom to support.
Nothing to do? Why not go to the
A.S.S.U. office, and watch candi
dates for office suddenly trek
through in large numbers? With the j
11 o'clock assembly cancelled, that's
the best way to know whom you're
voting for. They're all there.
Swampum, with rocord still
clean, makes another selection to
day. His guess for the Dividex man
agership, which will be released to
day, is the Gil Gist (Chappie)-Gib
Holloway (Convalescent Home
Drive) team.
