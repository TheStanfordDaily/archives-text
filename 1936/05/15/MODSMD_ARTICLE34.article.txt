The Editor, Sir:
It is with particular interest that
I note a Vox Campi letter printed
in yesterday's Daily. The letter was
written by a disgruntled individual
who signs his name, "One Who
Reads and Groans," a clever pseudo
nym indeed.
Mr. O.W.R.A.G. admittedly is dis
satisfied with Chaparral. May I take
this opportunity of saying that
Chaparral admittedly is dissatisfied
with Mr. O.W.R.A.G.
Now, while his letter contains sev
eral rather bad grammatical errors
and is not quite up to the general
run of Chappie contributions, I do
feel that Mr. O.W.R.A.G. might be
able to develop himself into capable
Chaparral timber.. However, owing
to the fact that he was careless
enough not to sign his own name to
the letter, I have no other way
of contacting him. Of course,
if he would rather write a letter, I
advise him to send it directly to the
Chaparral, as we are not in the
habit of I'eceiving correspondence
through the Daily.
In regard to Mr. O.W.R.A.G.'s crit
icism of the financial side, I should
like to recommend that he save his
16 cents each month and buy a
copy of The Youth's Companion or
Child Life, if those publications are
still in existence; no doubt he would
know.
Nevertheless, it is very hearten
ing to hear that at least one /person
reads our little magazine.
Jim Copp, Editor
P.S. For your information, Mr.

0.W.R.A.G., the drawing to which
you apparently refer is an imita
tion of Thurbur, not Soglow.
