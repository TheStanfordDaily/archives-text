# IN UNION THERE IS...

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday's editorial on the A.S.U.
amused me, as a member. It told
me many things about the Union
that I had not previously known.
You call us malc'ontents and say
our program spells faction with
every word. Although bewildered,
you seem very sure we are just an
other political party. If we are I
never knew it. Ken Livingston, if
he is a member, possesses no espe

Sour Grapes
You would have your "snarling
wolf backed up against the door"
howling "Sour grapes!" This at
tempt of yours to dismiss the A.S.U.
as a group of unsuccessful politicians
is too naive even for the Daily.
If we are malcontents it is because
we are dissatisfied with conditions
as we find them: discontent in such
a case is a synonym for sorrow
rather than envy.
If our elections are so inspiring
why don't the parties stand for
something other than themselves?
Our elected officials are given the
opportunity to make many' reforms:
for personal or party reasons they
consistently refuse to do anything.
Room for Improvement
And there is plenty of room for
improvement on the Stanford cam

A.S.S.U. Constitution, and the Daily
itself are examples.
And lastly, we haven't a perse

group cannot very well persecute a
larger one although it can criticize
and suggest reforms.
