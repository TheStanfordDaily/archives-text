# Chief Outlaws Fires; Prizes New Truck

### Allen Drury 
"It's against all University rules j
to have fires. Wo simply can't have i
them."
That's Chief Dugan of the Fire
house speaking, and he should know,
for he and his men are the ones who
fight the fires thai legally don't
exist.
Whenever a pile of leaves or a
haystack goes up in smoke, the fire
crew is culled to put it out. Fifteen
men, 12 of them students, are em
ployed by the University to protect
its property from damage.
Fires Not All
Fire-fighting, however, is not the
only activity carried on by the crew. |
During the rainy season it is their
responsibility to clean out the
drains when they become plugged
up with leaves and debris. All large !
campus functions, dances, games, j
and the like, are guarded from fire ,
by members of the crew. At the !
time of the late lamented straw
berry brunch, the cause was given a
great boost by Chief Dugan, who
loaned the Convalescent Drive one
of his trucks for advertising pur
poses.
Chief pride and joy of the crew is 1
the new ladder truck, just being i
finished. It has 275 feet of ladder, j
and a 500-gallon per minute pump :
with 900 feet of hose. It was as
sembled at the Firehouse on a Ford
chasis, and when completed a pic
ture of it will be sent to the Ford
plant at Detroit.
80 Calls Last Year
Eighty calls were answered last
year, chief activity coming during
spring and summer quarters. False
alarms are comparatively few, Chief
Dugan says. He does, however,
think altogether too many petty fires
are started.
"Students should remember that
such affairs are no longer under
jurisdiction of the University," he
says, "but can now be prosecuted
by the insurance companies under
state law. They can convict on cir
cumstantial evidence, and conviction
means a prison sentence."
