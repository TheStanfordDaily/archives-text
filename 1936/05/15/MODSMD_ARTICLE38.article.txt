# Future Vets To Play When Pay Arrives
## 
### 
First the American Legion tried
to get around the Veterans of
Future Wars by condemning them. J
That didn't work so well so Le- j
gionnaires tried taking the future
"vets" as a big joke. That, it
seems, wasn't so successful either.
"Legion invites Veterans of Fu- I
ture Wars to open house to be
held here on second Tuesday
May," the Legion's Victory Post
in Washington wired the V.F.W.'s |
Princeton headquarters. "Let's
see if you are real sports in the !
spirit of good clean fun. We can !
take it. Can you?"
The Princeton V.F.W. tele
graphed this reply:
"Appreciate kind invitation stop ,
Appreciate spirit of good clean
fun stop Unfortunately pressure ,
of real business prevents accept
ance of any purely social engage- j
ments stop When we get our bonus
we can play too."
