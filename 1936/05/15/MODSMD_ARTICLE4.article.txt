# Premier Ousts Starhemberg
## Austria's Italian Loyalty Pledge Renewed 
### 
VIENNA, May 14 (/P).â€”After re
moving Prince Ernst von Starhem
berg as "ice-chancellor of Austria,
Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg's first
act today was to promise Austria's
loyalty to Italy.
Having thrown the powerful
Prince out of the government, the
scholarly Schuschnigg rushed an as
surance to Premier Mussolini that
Austria remained Italy's loyal ally.
Indications were that Schusch
nigg's move may have improved the
friendly relations already existing
between the two nations.
Reports spread through high quar
ters that II Duce was actually in no
hurry to see Von Starhemberg al
though the prince, wealthy head of
the Heimwehr (home guard) long
had been regarded as a close friend
of the Italian leader.
