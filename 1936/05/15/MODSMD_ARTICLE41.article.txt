Into a turmoil of painters, Car
penters, and plumbers, called ro
mantically "The Oaks," 53 transfers
stumbled the opening day of fall
quarter. Charming Miss Yost, wel
coming them in her blue lace after
noon dress, calm amid the clatter,
could not offset the drabness of the
old building. Even the Lagunita
women, chattering glibly of "two
tennis courts and a lovely swimming
pool," could not offset the depress
ing effect of the oddly shaped, bare
ly furnished rooms.
Such was the state of "The Oaks"
when 53 new women were asked to
live there this year. That does not
cover all its liabilities. Thei'e was a
stove which wouldn't work, neces
sitating the serving of slightly warm
food from the Encina kitchens.
Worst of all was the inconvenience
of living miles from the campus,
among women who were all unfa
miliar with Stanford. Only after
several weeks was a bus provided at
university expense to take the wom
en to and fro at 8 o'clock in the
morning and again at noon. For
such accommodations these women
are paying $132.50, the same toll as
is charged for Lagunita.
If it had not been for the good
sportsmanship of these transfers, the
saga of "The Oaks" would have
ended unfortunately with a group of
unadjusted new women with an in
grained dislike of Stanford. Fortu
nately these 53 women had per
sonality enough to put "The Oaks"
on the map.
If the University cannot provide
better living quarters, the number of
women admitted to Stanford should
be cut down. It is not right that a
group of women, all transfers, shou'd
be quartered off-campus, where
they have no chance to participate
in real campus life. And no other
Stanford women will consent to live
under such conditions. Faimor has
it that the University intends to
build another wing onto Lagunita to
house these extra women. Such a
step should be taken soon!
