# Costume Balls Held Tonight
## Fraternities Feature Nut, Pirate Motifs 
### 
A number of fraternity costume
dances are marked on the Farm's
social calendar tonight. Phi Kaps
are going crazy over their annual
Nut Dance, held at their house.
The front room will be decorated
like an insane asylum, with Gordy
Heche's orchestra in jail. All
guests must come in nutty costumes.
Supper will be served at 12.
Jail Dance
On the same idea as the Phi Kap
dance will be the Phi Sig dance,
featuring a jail motif. Bars (the
iron kind)' will line the walls, and
rock piles and electric chairs are
placed at various points in the floor.
John Hays' orchestra from San
Jose, dressed like prisoners, will
play.
The Kappa Sigs are presenting
their annual pirate dance, their main
social event of spring quarter. The
various rooms of the new Kappa
Sig house will be decorated as a
sub-ocean scene, with fish and mer
maids; the interior of a cannibal hut;
the'interior fo a jungle; and a pirate
stronghold, with treasure chests in
the corners. A gang-plank leads up
to the door. Guests must wear pirate
clothes. Ernie Heckscher's band is
supplying the music.
Alpha Sig Formal
South Sea Islands is the theme of
the Alpha Sig formal, given tonight
at the Alpha Sig house. Palms, na
tive huts, bamboo shoots, and
bunches of bananas are decorative
features, while a large tropical moon
will shine from one corner.
D.U.'s are also giving their an
nual spring quarter formal. And a
Toyon-Sequoia Spring Informal
completes the social program.
