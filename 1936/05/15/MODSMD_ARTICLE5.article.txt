jof confidence "in the destiny of

Hoover said several New Deal
structures should be revamped,

and that unless the Administration's
economic policies were reversed
i there would be "only increased pov
j erty."
The former President said he had
! been "exposing the New Deal for
what it really is" during the past
year "only because the Republic is
in great peril."
Addressing the Republican women

men who founded a nation that
| liberty might live, they should apol
| ogize to the American people. In
j stead they will produce splendifer
