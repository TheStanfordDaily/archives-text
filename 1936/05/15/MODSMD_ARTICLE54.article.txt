# Grayson Awarded Gimbel Medal For Attitude in Sports
## Similar Prizes Given S.C., Cal; Rintala, Eastman Past Honor Winners 
### 
Because he has shown the most
commendable mental attitude toward
college athletics during his senior
year, Bobby Grayson will officially
be awarded the Jacob Gimbel medal
and $25 in cash by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur sometime next week.
Grayson was selected for the hon
or by a committee composed of Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, Dr. Joseph C.
Hinsey, and Dean George Culver.
A similar award is given to a man
at each of several other coast uni
versities including U.S.C. and Cali
fornia.
Gimbel Former College Man
Jacob Gimbel, donor of the award,
formerly was connected with several
eastern universities, and through
his work there became interested in
college men and their activities.
Since his retirement from active
university work, he has lived in Los
Angeles and instituted his award.
Grayson will be the seventh Stan
ford man to receive the Gimbel
award. Harlow Rolhert, now alumni
secretary, was given the first medal
for the year 1929-30 on the basis of
his activities in football, track, and
basketball. Robert Minge Brown,
Rhodes scholar and trackman, re
ceived the award for 1930-31.
Lyman Previously Honored
In 1932, Rudy Rintala was hon
ored for his all-around activities in
football, track, and basketball. For
his work as a champion trackster,
Ben Eastman received the medal for
1932-33. Johnny Lyman was award
ed the honor in his senior year for
his track activities. Last year, the
medal went to Gordy Mallatratt,
stellar first baseman on the Indian
nine.
The basis of awarding this medal
is not necessarily, however, the per
formance that the man turns in dur
ing his participation in sports, but
upon his attitude toward athletics in
general.
