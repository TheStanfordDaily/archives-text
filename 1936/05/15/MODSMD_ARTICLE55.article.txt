## NO LUCK, CARDS SECOND IN RELAYS 
### 
On the table beside the typewriter
here is our weekly dope sheet. It
I seems to say, in mediocre foolscap
tones, that our Cards have about as
much chance of beating S.C. in the
Fresno relays as has the Epworth
League "B" squad.
On purely unbiased pragma
listic judgment we have to give
S.C. 7<> points, Stanford 55: for the
big 13-event program.
Second place, mind you, is not
so had for tke Cards, for last year
at the Raisin Relays we not
fourth â€” behind Cal and Fresno
State, of all things.
Individual battles will be thrash
ed out in every event; of special in
terest will be the high hurdles, dis
cus, broad jump, high jump, pole
1 vault, and mile relay.
1 In the highs we will watch and
see if Sammy Klopstock can beat
those big boys Phil Cope, Rpy
Staley, and Tom Moore. Kloppy
heat Moore in the Big Meet buf
feting a high wind in 14.7 and
j hasn't been pressed since. He goes
j on running flights in practice at
around 15.15 but that means noth
ing. He will also be in there to
work off a few innings against
Cope and Staley, who trounced
him in the S.C. meet.
Moore will be the fair-haired lad
I at the gun tomorrow night. At the
, relays last year he nosed the field
out in the world record time of 14.2.
, You might remember that that was
one close race, and there were about
; five athletes better ihan 14.5.
