# COUNTRY'S BEST SPIN THE PLATTER
## 
### 
The country's discus champion -
j ship might as well be settled down
there, too. With Gordy Dunn, Phil
j Levy, Ken Carpenter, Hugh Grib
hen, and Bobby Jones trying to out
psychologize each other, there is no
telling what might happen.
Then they will settle the unan-
I swered problem of who is the best
broad jumper on the Coast. The
i Troy trio and Bob Clarke will be
favored, but there is a chance that
Leo Madlem will find the cool night
air to his liking and wiggle out to
pay sawdust.
With Walter Marty and Corney
Johnson leaping high there appears
little chance for Humbert Smith to
convince himself that he can place,
but the supple senior still might sur
prise everyone and battle with the
soaring twain at heights above 6.6.
In the pole vault don't be sur
prised if they set a new world's
record. The skyscraper trio from
Troy, Day, Meadows, and Sefton,
may all break the record if hot,
and Lee Barnes, VarofT, Garrett,
and Mauger of the Club are all up
near 14 feet.
I The mile relay will be the most
closely contested of all the relay
; events. S.C.,
A final remark is to watch Clar
ence Rowland of Fresno State in the
javelin. He is liable to release the
j shaft for an American record one: of
I these days. â€”Breed
