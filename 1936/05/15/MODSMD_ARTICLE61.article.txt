# Ferko Moves Up In Spring Grid Line-up
## 
### 
Slight changes on both first and
second string line-ups in yester
day's football scrimmage brought to
I light new possibilities for next fall's
' grid squad. Leo Ferko, who trans
, ferred from S.F.U. but was ineligible
! last fall, was tried in the first string
j guard post, and showed remarkable
I promise in leading interference,
I tackling, and blocking.
Bergman, who was at second
| string center post, has improved
considerably since last fall. In the
I second string tackle position for the
| first time, Shannon looked good on
j both offense and defense. Frank
; McMillan continues to show prom
j ise as an offensive guard. Bob Man
j gan, who broke his leg just above
| the ankle, and Jay Holdridge, with
I a broken rib, are missed in first and
J second string scrimmages.
