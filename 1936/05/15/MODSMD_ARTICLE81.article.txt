## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Student Manager's General Check-Up May Aid Efficiency of A.S.S.U. Groups 
### 
A.S.S.U. organizations, classes, honorary and
professional societies—all groups officially rec
ognized by the Associated Students —now have
their books under the investigating microscope
of the student manager's office.
They are not on the spot. They are not sus
pected of graft or misappropriation of funds.
The books merely are being studied to detect
flaws in management and to find evidence of
extravagance if such exists. In a few weeks
the student manager will reveal his findings and
make such recommendations to the Executive
Committee as he sees fit.
At present class funds are the chief object
of attention. These treasuries build up rapidly
as classes get nearer to the day of graduation.
And they are controlled entirely by a few class
officers who have the power to spend large
surris of money on their own initiative.
Extravagance, one of the chief objects of the
study, is a common thing tinder the inexperi
enced management that is bound to exist in

student organizations. If it is found and pointed
out, the same mistakes will not occur year after
year,
At first the investigation included only those
organizations which received money through
Ex Committee sanction. But now it has been
I extended further and should reveal some highly
interesting facts concerning the many profes
i sional and honorary societies.
A society's activity can be gauged very well
by the income and outgo of its treasury. If there
are stagnant, useless groups on the campus,
they probably will be exposed as such when
! the student manager's report comes out.
j The fewer recommendations and criticisms
that come out of the manager's report, the bet
ter is will speak for student control of their activ
ities. However, if there are isolated cases of
poor management, or if there are some organi
zations whose right to exist is questionable, the
| student manager's report will be an adequate
indictment out of which may grow some worth
j while investigations.
