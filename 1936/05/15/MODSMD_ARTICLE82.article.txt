# Which Proves That Chappie Is a Humor Mag

### 
The famous Chaparral plan for the distribution
of profits by a triple suspension of a complex
colloidal profit into the unearned increment, to
be split by dual ratio into an equally divisible
unit, so that, finally, the business manager gets
a profit if he spends money and doesn't if he
doesn't, and loses money if he spends it and
doesn't earn it if he does, has apparently struck
a snag —the Chaparral men have found a flaw
in it.
Previously, it had been reported that the
plan was bound to go through because nobody
understood it except the Chappie men, and they
were satisfied with it but couldn't explain it V(i .
It is to be hoped, however, that the Chappie
men continue to work out new plans that can
be grouped with such established successes a§
proportional representation for Ex Committee,
the VFW, and the profit system.
Though the plans certainly can't work outside
of the Chappie office, they are definitely con
genial to the fundamental purposes of Hammer
and Coffin, self-confessed humor society. They
even seem to be a stimulation to the Chappie
scalp, as evidenced by the lack of dandruff in
yesterday's issue, which was, curiously enough,
almost a humor magazine.
