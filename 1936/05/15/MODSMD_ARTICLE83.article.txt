This afternoon students have a chance to

Leaders of the movement say that Stanford
is behind other colleges and universities where
liberal thinking in united groups is concerned.

It is apparently the purpose of the A.S.U. to

Farm. Today's meeting should speak for itself
concerning the need and purpose of the organi
zation, which denies any "red" affiliations.
