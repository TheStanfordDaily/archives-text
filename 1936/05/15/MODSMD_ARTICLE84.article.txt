## Et Tu, Brute? (From the Daily Princetonian) 
### 
Horror of horrors! According to the fashion editor
of Esquire, Yale has now assumed the title of the best
dressed college in the country. Of course this tasty bit
of heresy might seem a little prejudiced on the grounds
that the statement was made for Eli consumption, but
you can bet it cuts to the quick—especially those fel
lows with crew haircuts and rolled-up trousers who
specialize in wine-colored, double-breasted dirtner
suits. ~
"At Princeton," it seems, "they have become just
a little bit extreme; but that's because they live out
in the country." Of course, there is the consolation that
Harvard just isn't even in the running—too conserva
tive and all that. But to have Esquire damn our own
smoothies with the sin of ultra-bizarreness is going a
little too far, wo think. Shows no forward-looking
spirit whatsoever. ... .. .
The crushing blow of the who!e business is that
"Princeton in the Nation's Styles" is about all we
have by which to remember those halcyon country
club d;iys before the great depression put in its work
as the gre.it levcler. And if we lose out in this im
portant field, Princeton may have to settle down to
being just another educational institution. But remem
ber, you Esquire boys who have been betrayed, there's
always a comeback. Clothes don't make the man!.
