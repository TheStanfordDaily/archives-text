(Frcm the Indiana Daily Student)
A successful business executive, in addressing* a
group of Indiana students recently, said:
A Phi Beta Kappa key doesn't yet you anywhere
unless you have practical experience back of it. The
hardest thing a college graduate has to do on leaving
school is to forget his college education. He must for
get that he knows anything and try to learn every
thing from the bottom up."
The speaker, it would seem, was trying to put
across a point -a very excellent point. But in doing
so, we feel thai he went far afield of whwt he actually
meant. What he undoubtedly had in mind was:
"A Phi Beta Kappa key is not sufficient to HKKur«»
the college grr.duate of success. The hardest, thing a
college graduate has to do is to forget that a college
diploma is a passport to the top of his business or
profession. He must be receptive to the teachings of
the experienced men who will be his employers and
must apply practical knowledge to the theories which
lie acquired in college."
