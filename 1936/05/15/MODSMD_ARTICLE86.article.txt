# While They Dish It Out We Might as Well Get Ours

College students can expect continued finan
cial aid from the government next fall, a report
from Washington to A.S.S.U. President Wally
Brooke announced this week.
At first hand, it seems like a very laudable
idea for the government to suport needy college
students, particularly Stanford students.
Ye,t there apparently is no adequate assurance
that a government in Washington can protect
its investment of $10 or $15 checks per student
per month.
As everyone else has done, Stanford has gath
ered at the gravy spigot from which government
blessings come. Of course, it would be foolish
to expect us to refuse aid because of altruistic
motives, when other colleges are getting it.
However, other colleges are reasoning the
same way. Until we can shake the moths out
of our Federal system, with its division of pow
ers, rubber checks and trial balances, our na
tion will be a pressure group government.
