# Our Hasher Sez:

### 
In line with the current tendency to single out
the most beautiful, the ultimate, the highest, and the
| best Our Hasher today presents his annual selection
of Stanford's 21 most beautiful men:
Bernhard
• Bernheim
and Birnbaum.
Or if you like it better this way:
Birnbaum
Barnhard
and Bernheim
There is also the possibility of:
Bernheim
v\ 1 ' Birnbaum
and Bernhard
Those who wish a further "swing," to it—an emo
tional response that springs from the very soul itself,
might really evolve something creative, like Birn
baum, Birnbaum, Birnhaum, bon-bon, bong, bong,
bong, bong, bong (You can see the first you whisper
then you shout influence getting in here) bong, bong
(now comes the flitter-flutter of the leaves) bong,
bong, bong (here we see the gradual influence of the
proletarian theme and the class conflict) bong, bong,
bong, bong (It is said that the Gamma Phi Betas will
not speak to other Gamma Phi Betas these days) bong,
bong, bong, bong, bong (because they can't decide
j whether to have their annual treasure hunt or a
| scavenger hunt) bong, bong, bong (personally, I can't
see any difference) bong, bong, bong (I wouldst spendst
my hunt in pleasure, instead of chasing trashure)
bong, bong, bong, bong (I wouldst Our Hasher sasher,
instead of writing trashure) bong, bong, bong, Bern
heim, and Bernhard.
Despite all this, however, only one of all these
men is running for student body president.
But seeing that these boys just thrive on pub
licity, I guess I better forget all about it, and not
even mention their names.
