# 'Ghost Goes West' Novel, Acting Good
## 
### 
Robert Donat, Jean Parker, and
Eugene Pallete turn in a highly
creditable performance in "The
Ghost Goes West."
This unique Alexander Korda
Production has a novel plot. It deals

with the ghost of
Murdock Glowi'ie,
whose father sen
tenced him in the
eighteenth century to
a nightly vigil of
Glowrie Castle. Mur-

dock can find eternal rest only when
he forces a McClagen to acknowl
edge that one Glowrie can whip 50
McClaglens.
We then travel through time to
the twentieth century and find Don
ald Glowrie, the last of his line.
Donald is compelled to sell historic
old Glowrie Castle to pay his debts.
He sells it to an American by the
name of Martin, whose daughter
Peggy wants to have the old castle.
Martin takes the castle apart,
moves it, ghost and all to Florida.
The ghost stalks through the whole
story, providing it with weird scenes
and much comedy.
Good line: Donald Glowrie hears
a knocking on his bedroom door as
he is preparing for bed. Thinking it
is the ghost, he says, "That's all
right, Murdock. You may come in
anytime now."
"Everybody's Old Man," with Ir
vin S. Cobb, Rochelle Hudson, and
Norman Foster, is an entertaining
picture, if you like Cobb us an actor.
For the first half hour I preferred
him as a syndicate writer. After
these first scenes, which were bad
ly overacted, the cast got on its feet
and gave a fairly good performance.
