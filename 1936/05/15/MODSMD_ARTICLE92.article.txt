# Bull Session
## IN DEFENSE OF THE STRAIGHT TICKET 
### 
Occasionally some other motive
than the logical one accomplishes
the most desirable end.
The Public Exercises Committee
turned down the request for an all-

University assem
bly yesterday, not
because they love
political soap box
ers the less but
because they love
eleven o'clock
classes the more.
And not more
than 341 of us (the
seat ing capacity
of 214) had our
•vfites influenced
by hypocritical
bits of verbaliza-

j tion, silken clad ankles, or beaming
! grins. The first major political ma
neuver of the Row failed.
* * *
The assembly idea, of course, was
thought up by the Greek campaign
committee which figured the Row 1
with its debater-candidates and '
! pretty-pussed office aspirants could
i out-soap-box the somewhat less pol
ished Hall slate. The Hall leaders,
; lacking nothing in self confidence ;
lor conceit, favored the idea. Nat- I
' urally any candidate thinks he could
! swing votes if only he had the
| chance to stand up and make a per- j
j sonal plea to the electorate.

Politics is funny that way. Al
ways there are some who cry: "Let ,
the voters pick for themselves. You '

can't tell who's the best man until
you've seen him and heard him."
Those kind will never make good
Republicans or good Democrats.
They want to pick their own candi
dates. To hell with caucuses and
Row or Hall loyalty! Let a man
smile their way and he has a vote.
It pats their ego on the back to
think they asserted themselves and
chose their own candidates.

If the political assembly had been
held yesterday, the issues in the
election wouldn't have been based
on affiliation. They would have been
based on the fact that Joe could be

heard in the balcony and Oscar
couldn't, that Mary has straighter
teeth than Lulu, and that George
was funnier than Henry. Everybody
would have had just three minutes 1
to speak, and it takes about that
long to get the first laugh—and of
course a laugh is essential. Politics
I has to be funny.
» * *
Haphazard as campus caucuses
; are, they still somehow manage to
nominate a pretty fair list of can
didates. It takes vote trading and
dickering to get the right ones in,
; but the bad candidate is an exeep- j
tion. A house or a club is not going
to run someone who will not be a
j credit if he gets in office.
The Row contingent vows to stand
behind their candidates. The Halls
j are supposed to do the same. They
are two normal, logical, expedient
! political parties in spite of all the I
bally-hoo'about "Alleviate the Hall-
Row split!"
Everybody should vote a straight
ticket. For if more Hall voters cast
votes for a candidate than are cast i
by Row voters, then the Hall man
has a right to the office since he j
represents the group which is most
interested in student government.
But as long as people want to i
judge their candidates via the soap- j
! box, whether such things as political '
' assemblies ever go through or not, j
i sensible politics will still exist only I
; in the realm of theory.

Republicans or good Democrats.

It pats their ego on the back to

If the political assembly had been
held yesterday, the issues in the
election wouldn't have been based
on affiliation. They would have been
based on the fact that Joe could be

heard in the balcony and Oscar
couldn't, that Mary has straighter
teeth than Lulu, and that George
was funnier than Henry. Everybody
would have had just three minutes 1
to speak, and it takes about that
long to get the first laugh—and of
course a laugh is essential. Politics

votes for a candidate than are cast i
by Row voters, then the Hall man
