# Rider Becomes Olympic Hope
## Needham Upset, But Still To Go To Providence 
### 
Dave Rider, long considered just
another swimmer, became one of the
| country's four top 1500-meter men
1 yesterday afternoon when he deci
sively whipped frosh star Winfield
Needham, second-place winner, and
set a new Pacific Association record
at the Olympic sectional tryouts,
Fleishhacker pool.
Rider's win was the biggest swim
ming upset of the year in this
district. He was not figured to finish
even close to cither Needham—fa
"vurAe in*~Coach Thornton's pie
meet opinion—or the San Francisco
idol, Dick Keating of the Olympic
Club, holder of the fonner record.
Thornton said last night that prob-
J ably both Rider and Needham would
| travel in July to Providence, R.1., to
! bid for Olympic berths. Needham
| finished about 12 seconds behind
I Rider's mark of 21:12.4, 14 seconds
j better than the old record. Keating
I was 50 yards behind.
Rider stepped out in front of the
Stanford yearling, in the last 100
meters churning through the dis
tance with speed enough for a good
sprinter. Thornton says Rider's
final sprint shows he did not pace
the distance well and indicates that
he is capable of doing it under 21
minutes.
