# Indians Tie S.C. 64-64 In Fresno Meet
## Farm's Track Stars Equal 'World's Greatest Team' After Dual Meet Defeat 
### 
A tie with the "world's greatest
track team"—thai was the haul that
Coach Dink Templeton's Cardinal
track force reaped Saturday night in
Fresno at the tenth annual West
Coast Relays carnival when Stanford
and U.S.C. scored 64 points each to
lead the university division.
Stanford picked up some easy
points because the Olympic Club
"unattached" point winners were not
put into the scoring column, and
because U.S.C.'s 880-yard relay
event winner was disqualified for
stepping outside the baton-pass
zone.
New World's Record
Best effort of the evening was the
final event, when four fresh Trojans,
Estel Johnson, Jimmy Cassin, Hal
Smallwood, and A1 Fitch, tore off
the standard mile relay race in 3:11.6,
one second better than the accepted
world record set by the Stanford
team of Shove, Hables, Hables, and
Eastman at FreSno in 1931.
Stanford's two-mile team of Ma
lott, Nimmo, Alexahdcr, and Mc-
Curdy won in 7:48.8 by 25 yards
over U.C.L.A., second best; Kneu
buhl, Myers, Hyde, and Dean were
awarded the 880-yard event after
U.S.C.'s disqualification, while other
points came from the medley squad
of Weiershauser, McCurdy, Bur
rows, and Dixon, which finished 20
yards behind the Olympic Club.
Eastman Stars
The Club's victory was due large
ly to Ben Eastman, who turned in
his half-mile lap in 1:52 to give a
large lead. Weiershauser opened for
Stanford, turned in 47.5 with a
standing start, while Warren Dixon,
running the mile anchor spell, ran
4:17 to gain a few yards on Norm
Bright, the Club anchor man.
Other Card firsts came from Rey
nolds, still undefeated this year in
the shot, and Ray Dean, who beat
Pollock, Holt, and other greats in a
9.8 hundred. Humbert Smith
jumped 6-5V2 for a tie behind rec
ordmen Cornelius Johnson and
Walter Marty; Phil Levy's 163-8 in
the discus was nine inches short of
beating Carpenter of U.S.C. out of
first.

A tie with the "world's greatest
track team"—thai was the haul that
Coach Dink Templeton's Cardinal
track force reaped Saturday night in
Fresno at the tenth annual West
Coast Relays carnival when Stanford
and U.S.C. scored 64 points each to
lead the university division.
Stanford picked up some easy
points because the Olympic Club
"unattached" point winners were not
put into the scoring column, and
because U.S.C.'s 880-yard relay
event winner was disqualified for
stepping outside the baton-pass
zone.
New World's Record
Best effort of the evening was the
final event, when four fresh Trojans,
Estel Johnson, Jimmy Cassin, Hal
Smallwood, and A1 Fitch, tore off
the standard mile relay race in 3:11.6,
one second better than the accepted
world record set by the Stanford
team of Shove, Hables, Hables, and
Eastman at FreSno in 1931.
Stanford's two-mile team of Ma
lott, Nimmo, Alexahdcr, and Mc-
Curdy won in 7:48.8 by 25 yards
over U.C.L.A., second best; Kneu
buhl, Myers, Hyde, and Dean were
awarded the 880-yard event after
U.S.C.'s disqualification, while other
points came from the medley squad
of Weiershauser, McCurdy, Bur
rows, and Dixon, which finished 20
yards behind the Olympic Club.
Eastman Stars
The Club's victory was due large
ly to Ben Eastman, who turned in
his half-mile lap in 1:52 to give a
large lead. Weiershauser opened for
Stanford, turned in 47.5 with a
standing start, while Warren Dixon,
running the mile anchor spell, ran
4:17 to gain a few yards on Norm
Bright, the Club anchor man.
Other Card firsts came from Rey
nolds, still undefeated this year in
the shot, and Ray Dean, who beat
Pollock, Holt, and other greats in a
9.8 hundred. Humbert Smith
jumped 6-5V2 for a tie behind rec
ordmen Cornelius Johnson and
Walter Marty; Phil Levy's 163-8 in
the discus was nine inches short of
beating Carpenter of U.S.C. out of
first.

A tie with the "world's greatest
track team"—thai was the haul that
Coach Dink Templeton's Cardinal
track force reaped Saturday night in
Fresno at the tenth annual West
Coast Relays carnival when Stanford
and U.S.C. scored 64 points each to
lead the university division.
Stanford picked up some easy
points because the Olympic Club
"unattached" point winners were not
put into the scoring column, and
because U.S.C.'s 880-yard relay
event winner was disqualified for
stepping outside the baton-pass
zone.
New World's Record
Best effort of the evening was the
final event, when four fresh Trojans,
Estel Johnson, Jimmy Cassin, Hal
Smallwood, and A1 Fitch, tore off
the standard mile relay race in 3:11.6,
one second better than the accepted
world record set by the Stanford
team of Shove, Hables, Hables, and
Eastman at FreSno in 1931.
Stanford's two-mile team of Ma
lott, Nimmo, Alexahdcr, and Mc-
Curdy won in 7:48.8 by 25 yards
over U.C.L.A., second best; Kneu
buhl, Myers, Hyde, and Dean were
awarded the 880-yard event after
U.S.C.'s disqualification, while other
points came from the medley squad
of Weiershauser, McCurdy, Bur
rows, and Dixon, which finished 20
yards behind the Olympic Club.
Eastman Stars
The Club's victory was due large
ly to Ben Eastman, who turned in
his half-mile lap in 1:52 to give a
large lead. Weiershauser opened for
Stanford, turned in 47.5 with a
standing start, while Warren Dixon,
running the mile anchor spell, ran
4:17 to gain a few yards on Norm
Bright, the Club anchor man.
Other Card firsts came from Rey
nolds, still undefeated this year in
the shot, and Ray Dean, who beat
Pollock, Holt, and other greats in a
9.8 hundred. Humbert Smith
jumped 6-5V2 for a tie behind rec
ordmen Cornelius Johnson and
Walter Marty; Phil Levy's 163-8 in
the discus was nine inches short of
beating Carpenter of U.S.C. out of
first.
