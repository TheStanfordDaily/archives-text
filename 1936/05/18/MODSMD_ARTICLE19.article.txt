Likes Theater
Besides his journalism and orator
ical tendencies, Robert Bernhard is
somewhat a man of the theater. First j
of all he's a recognized master of |
the art of conjuring (i.e., being a

magician.) He's performed through
out the country in theaters and cab
arets, before clubs, churches, and
groups of fellow magicians. He has
also produced and directed several
musical productions, written words
and music to 27 songs. Two were
used in the recent Stanford play,
"June Moon".
His platform as presidential can
didate contains three planks: "Un
ion prices must come down, an ag
ressive dramatic as well as technical
program for the New Theater must
be pushed, and traffic fines must be
revised and reduced."
'Chick' Fianich. hall candidate, is
one of the Farm's top students, His
number one gripe is 17 units of "B"
work. HLs bawlout average is 126
plus 235. Chick, a political science
major, is headed for diplomatic
service.
No book-worm, Phi Bete Franich
finds time to serve on Ex Committee
and Cardinals, to manage Toyon,
to represent the "Frantic" and a lo
cal laundry, to put on the Masque
Ball, and to spend four hours a day
as a football manager in Ihe fall.
Chick sees no need for radical
change in the Farm's students' gov
ernment. Running on a platform
for increased student activities, his
principle planks are promotion of
dramatics, more panels and forums,
an increased intramural budget,
more A.S.S.U. dances, a concentrated
debate tour, and a campaign to ad
vertise Stanford.
Jim Reynolds is now the country's
leading collegiate shot-putter, and
possessor of a bawl-out average of
128 plus 157.
A Pasadena boy, strongman Rey
nolds is the son of two Stanford
graduates. When he came to the
Farm in '33 lie brought with him the
hope of some day winning a Rhodes
Scholarship, and he hasn't given up
this hope.
Ilcads Juniors
Reynolds is at present president
of the Junior class. He was one of
eleven Stanford students to make
the collegiate Who's Who. He has
been elected to Scalpers, Skull and
Snakes, nnd Phi Phi. Jim traveled
over 16,000 miles last year to com
pete in track meets.
Reynolds has no respect for stud
ents who vote the straight ticket in
campus elections. He feels that
studonts should vote? for the man and
not for his affiliation.
Reynold's program calls for "em
phasis upon cooperation between
student groups rather than upon
specific issues."

Tomorrow Farm students go to
the polls to select next year's A. S.
S. U. president with Bob Bernhard,
Chick Franich, and Jim Reynolds
as possible choices. A summary of j
the student activities of these three |
candidates follows:
Robert Bernhard was born in New
York City 20 years ago, sent to ele
mentary school at the Newark Acad
emy in New Jersey. From there
he graduated honor man in his class,
received the school's Declamation ■
Medal for outstanding oratory.
Before leaving L. S. U. for Stan
ford after finishing his sophomore
year, Bernhard was given the choice
of quitting school or suspending pub
lication of his "liberal" campus news- I
paper, the Baton Rouge Record. He j
suspended publication of the Record. I
Likes Theater
Besides his journalism and orator
ical tendencies, Robert Bernhard is
somewhat a man of the theater. First j
of all he's a recognized master of |
the art of conjuring (i.e., being a

magician.) He's performed through
out the country in theaters and cab
arets, before clubs, churches, and
groups of fellow magicians. He has
also produced and directed several
musical productions, written words
and music to 27 songs. Two were
used in the recent Stanford play,
"June Moon".
His platform as presidential can
didate contains three planks: "Un
ion prices must come down, an ag
ressive dramatic as well as technical
program for the New Theater must
be pushed, and traffic fines must be
revised and reduced."
'Chick' Fianich. hall candidate, is
one of the Farm's top students, His
number one gripe is 17 units of "B"
work. HLs bawlout average is 126
plus 235. Chick, a political science
major, is headed for diplomatic
service.
No book-worm, Phi Bete Franich
finds time to serve on Ex Committee
and Cardinals, to manage Toyon,
to represent the "Frantic" and a lo
cal laundry, to put on the Masque
Ball, and to spend four hours a day
as a football manager in Ihe fall.
Chick sees no need for radical
change in the Farm's students' gov
ernment. Running on a platform
for increased student activities, his
principle planks are promotion of
dramatics, more panels and forums,
an increased intramural budget,
more A.S.S.U. dances, a concentrated
debate tour, and a campaign to ad
vertise Stanford.
Jim Reynolds is now the country's
leading collegiate shot-putter, and
possessor of a bawl-out average of
128 plus 157.
A Pasadena boy, strongman Rey
nolds is the son of two Stanford
graduates. When he came to the
Farm in '33 lie brought with him the
hope of some day winning a Rhodes
Scholarship, and he hasn't given up
this hope.
Ilcads Juniors
Reynolds is at present president
of the Junior class. He was one of
eleven Stanford students to make
the collegiate Who's Who. He has
been elected to Scalpers, Skull and
Snakes, nnd Phi Phi. Jim traveled
over 16,000 miles last year to com
pete in track meets.
Reynolds has no respect for stud
ents who vote the straight ticket in
campus elections. He feels that
studonts should vote? for the man and
not for his affiliation.
Reynold's program calls for "em
phasis upon cooperation between
student groups rather than upon
specific issues."
