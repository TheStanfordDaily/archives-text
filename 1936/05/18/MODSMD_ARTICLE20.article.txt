# Goal Set For Senior Fund
## One Dollar from Every Senior Is New Aim 
### 
At least $1 from every senior is
the immediate goal of the commit
tee collecting the first money for the
Stanford Fund under a plan sug
gested by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds,
head of Stanford Associates.
Receipt books will be given to
students in charge of collections in
each living group when the commit
tee meets tonight at 8:30 o'clock in
Room 214.
When the plan for an endowment
fund was accepted by the Class of
'36, Dr. Reynolds explained that its
perpetuation i.s dependent upon 100
per cent participation. If this co
operation could not be secured, he
requested that the class- reject the
proposal.
Alpha Phi started the ball rolling
with $20 already being contributed
by eight seniors.
The Stanford Fund, created by the
gifts of succeeding classes and the
annual contributions of all graduates
p' at least $1, will be placed at the
disposal of the University Admin
istration in order that, the most
needed improvements may be added
periodically to the University.
Program Chairman Roy Ander
son announces that graduation pro
j grams and announcements may still
j be ordered at the A.S.S.U. office, but
that there will be a slight delay in
delivery of late orders.
