STRANGERS
Waseda University's crack base- { I
ball team, intercollegiate champions
of Japan, played Stanford Saturday
in the most interesting baseball
game this season. The Nipponese
were all decked out in white uni
forms, half of the players wore
glasses (strange thing is the un
usual number of Japanese that wear
glasses: almost every one had "four
eyes"), and they used some good
tricks. The third baseman feigned a
sore arm, then Stanford began to
bunt out toward him. He raced after
the first before the batter was well
under way.
The catcher for Waseda had a
tough time with Leo Haggarty's
high fouls. Leo would pop one up
into the sun, the catcher would
miss, then they'd both grin at
each other and wait for the next
pitched hall. Then the process
would he repeated. Waseda's regu
lar catcher was taken sick on the
way over; consequently the man
ager of the outlit was catching
Saturday. They've sent for a new.
mail hut he hasn't arrived yet.
Palo Alto's Japanese citizenry
turned out en masse and applauded
their countrymen. Good example of
the sportsmanship of the rooters oc
curred when the umpire called a
Wasedaman out at second when the
runner looked to be as safe as a
government bond. A Caucasian root- |
or stood up and gave that umpire j
hell for about 10 minutes. Every
time a "raw" decision was pulled !
against the visitors a white rooter )
would moan at the umpire, even j
though the decision was in Stan- j
ford's favor. The rooters would tol- |
crate no injustice toward the sports
manlike visitors.
The Japanese never moaned at
an umpire for a decision against j
them. They were sports of the I
lirst class. The two teams traded j
pennants in a ceremony just be
fore the game started. The Japa- j
nese are bringing a little ceremony I
info the game, and it could use
some, too. There's nothing as un
ceremonious as baseball.
Saw Mr. Treat at the game, but no |
trace of Mr. Ichihashi. Mr. Treat !
told me that the Japanese are play- |
ing baseball as we played it 25
years ago—every kid in the nation
plays on every available vacant lot.
Crowds of 40,000 go to see high j
school games. The college games
draw more than a football game in j
the U.S. But they'll soon be playing j
football, too, and they'll develop a j
game all their own. Their shifti- !
ness will have to make up for their j
lack of power in a power game such >
as football.

ROOSEVELT'S FLAW
The President ought to dynamite j
all this money he is spending right
now out of the taxpayer's pocket by
taxation instead of borrowing, bor
rowing all the time. If he really
needs all this money, and he un
doubtedly does if he is to repair the
wrecked ship of capitalism, he
should tax it out of us today instead I
of milking men who have yet to be j
born.
If politicians had to pay as they ;
went with money taken out of the
pockets of living men, they'd go :
easier than they do now in rob- j
bing the pockets of unborn men
who can't put lip a howl.
An American pays $60 tax on an I
income of $5,000, the Britisher pays |
some $400. We get off pretty soft, 1
and Roosevelt could go a long way I
wilh the money he'd get from addi
tional income, inheritance, and gift ,
taxes. Not as far as he is getting to- !
day, but at least a goodly way and it j
would be on a cash basis.
