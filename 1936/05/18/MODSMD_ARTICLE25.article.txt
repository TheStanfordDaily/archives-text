# No Split Votes In Preferential System—--S.O.S.
## Swampum Explains Perils Of Ballots Tally; Gives Happy Chappie Hints 
### Solon O. Swampum 
"Two Hull nominees—it'll split the
vote."
That, we would like to point out, is
impossible. No "vote splitting" is
possible with the preferential sys
tem —one of its biggest advantages.
Here's why: assuming two Hall
people and one Row man are up,
if the Row man gets a majority on

the first ballot, he
would have had
those votes any
way. If he does
n't, the second
voles of the low
est man are di
vided between the
top two, just as

they would have been had only two
been running.
So the Row caucus and the Hall
caucus have nothing to worry about
—the independents on the ticket
will make practically no difference,
unless they win.
Bernhard, Grover, Strong, and
Paine, the independents, may or may
not stand a good chance. But they
won't split the vote, no matter who
wins.
Frances Sti'ong, Women's Confer
ence nomination for Conference
president, was going to decline.
Then she heard that Barbara Kim
ball might possibly be eliminated
because of incompletes. Then
were rumors that Phyllis Boothe was
contemplating a trip to Europe next
fall quarter, or might prefer to be
a sponsor.
So Strong is running, with Wom
en's Conference backing, the only
reversal of Swampum's predictions.
Chappie elections should be an
nounced soon. Here's our prophesy
—Charters, Alpha Sig, for business
manager, with a close fight between
Prendergast, Gist, and Scott for edi
tor. The Alpha Sig faction in Ham
mer and Coffin is sizeable, and
should be backing Alpha Sig Scott.
But we think mebbe Gist will russle
through on his third try for the Old
Boy job.
