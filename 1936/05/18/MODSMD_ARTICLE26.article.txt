## 
### 
The Stanford A Cappella Choir,
under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, University organist, will be
featured on the Stanford University
program to be broadcast tonight at
7:15 o'clock over KGO.
Selections to be heard on tonight's
broadcast are: Bach's Chorale, "All
People Sing Thy Praises," a song of
thanksgiving and prayer arranged
from an old German folk song; Or
lando Gibbons' anthem, "Almighty
and Everlasting God," a selection
representative of the Elizabethan
school.
Hoover's administration left a deb
it of two and a half billions for the
fiscal year of 1932. Roosevelt makes
the debit total six billion. Roose
velt still isn't doing as well as
Hoover, because he hasn't the aver
age. Hoover would have had a 10
billion dollar budget deficit at the
pace he set in '32. It all depends on
your point of view.
