Absent-minded?
If so, better cast a careful eye at
the Post Office bulletin board.
Every week post cards minus ad
dresses are carefully tacked up for
the campus to see, in hopes that the
sender will recognize his epistles and
reclaim them.
Last week's lost missives were
typical.
One said, "Dear Marmie: I miss
you and Dad so. If I weren't so
terribly busy I'd write a real letter.
"Why don't you hurry and send
me that money? All the other girls
are buying their new formals, and I
don't want to have to be at the Jr.
Prom (I'm going with the divinest
boy) in that horrible old green or-

I gandy you made me last spring."
The second, evidently from a
! freshman boy, began with the
: sprightly salutation of "Hi, Lamby
Pie!" and ended with the perhaps
! faithful observation that "You don't
j have to be jealous of any of these
Stanford babes. I spend my week
-1 ends studying."
| Few other post offices take the
: trouble of posting missent letters.
"We know how important these
1 messages are to the sender," says
Postmaster Ralph W. Evans, "so we
j do all we can to locate the rightful
| owner."
Only a tenth of the absent-minded
I post card mailers ever call for their
messages.
