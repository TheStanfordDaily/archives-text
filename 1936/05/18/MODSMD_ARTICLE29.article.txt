# Pre-Registration Period May Be Held for Frosh
## Students Submit Report For Official Sanction 
### 
Stanford freshmen will have three i
days to acquaint themselves with
campus customs, traditions, the
Honor Code, and scholastic require
ments when they come to register
next fall, if the recommendation of
the A.S.S.U. Pre-registration Com
mittee is accepted by the Adminis
tration. The committee's report
probably will be submitted early this
week.
Included in the plans are a tour of I
the campus, Honor Code round
tables, conferences with advisors, in
formal contact with the faculty and
student leaders, the giving of phys
ical tests by the Men's and Wom
en's Health Services, freshman his
tory, and reading tests.
The agitation came out of the first |
Honor Code Panel held last month i
by the Men's and Women's Councils. -
The panel decided that freshmen
needed more education on what the
purpose of the Honor Code was, and j
more time in acquainting themselves
with the purpose of a college educa
tion and the requirements they had
to take.
Since they were appointed by
A.S.S.U. President Wallace Brooke
at the request of Ex Committee, !
committee members have collected
data from faculty and administra- j
tors, and drew up their report at a
meeting Friday afternoon.
Members of the committee are: I
Dean Pierose, president of Encina
Club, chairman; Mary Craig, head !
Roble sponsor for '36—'37; Jean Rey
nolds, president of Roble Club; ;
Gordy Mallatratt, head Encina spon- j
sor; Carter Kurvin; and Irvin Jor- j
gensen.
