SCARE CARDS

FRESNO, May 16—It was a sad •
eyed bunch of trackmen that climbed
on the Stanford bus after the Relays j
here tonight—there were those try- !
ing to pull gags about the Waltham ■
wrist watches a lot of them were j
sporting as prizes, but mostly it j
was "Kick me hard, will ya?"
For the announcer had just given j
out the official score as U.S.C. G4, j
Stanford 63, and coming so near, but j
yet so far, was very, very hard to I
take.
But a half hour later someone j
dashed into the hotel, where every- j
body was sulking around, with news j
of a recount, that Stanford had tied j
the unbeatable Trojans 64-64, and |
that all those overhead performan- |
ces of the evening had not gone for
naught.
Sudden joy and celebration? Ilea- ;
ven knows if anyone'll be on hand i
to catch the bus tomorrow.
What happened was this—Dubby
Holt was 4th in the hundred ahead j
of Kneubuhl. But Holt got regus
ted with Fresno State a few meets
back and ran unattached tonight,
so Kneubuhl gets the point.

STATUS OF
UNATTACHED?

To put the carnival on a par with i
Drake and Perm, and also to get the j
cream of coast athletes there, Fres- j
no invites the Olympic Club and 1
other unattaeheds, mails them wrist !
watches if they win, but does not
give them points in the university
division.
But the system isn't perfect, as
the unattached marks are used in
some literature, and not in some,
depending on who the reader is to
be. Tonight the chamber of com- I
merce's P.A. announcer was holler- I
ing about the Olympic Club's 10:10 j
in the medley as a new worlds rec- j
ord, all because the 10:04.7 that !
Wisler, Walts, Wall, and Bright of 1
the Club did in his back yard last
year wasn't listed in his program. |
The 40.7 by U.S.C.'s sprint team 1
in the 440 relay also loses a lot of j
wind when you remember lowa had j
a team at 40.6 last year, which mark
hasn't been accepted.
Which leaves as the best world
record of the evening the 3:11.6 of J
the U.S.C. mile team. Let no Stan- I
ford backer start shedding tears!
now over losing out 3:12.6 world j
mark set by Maynor Shove, Abe
Hables, Ike Hables, and Ben East- j
man in 1931, as Johnson, Cassin,
Fitch, and McCarthy had a 8:12,4
run last June up pending recognition.
The U.S.C. 880 disqualification
came when Crane went by Talley
oo fast on the second pass, and when
the pass was completed the boys
were way outside the legal zone,
and had lost about 10 yards. Never
theless they made it up and won by
10 yards.
