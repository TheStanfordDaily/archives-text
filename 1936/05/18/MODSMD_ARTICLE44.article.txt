will be named for the team. Men
competing were 17 strokes ahead of
the nearest competitor in the weekly
medal ladder qualifying play.
Team of Six Probable
Coach Twiggs yesterday saicf that
"These tests will undoubtedly de
termine the most consistent of these
th ree men. As the University can
enter six men in the tournament it
is probable that Bob Welch and
Pete Hass will join the Stanford
forces as they live close at hand."
In the University championship
all matches were played, leaving the
quarter-finals to be played as fol
lows: Oneal vs. Hass, Mellon vs.
Manning, Hyman vs. Dillon, and
Stewart vs. Bob Welch.
Chosen Circle Enlarged
In the matches played over the
week-end Hass defeated Fitch by a
5-3 score. Manning took Davis by
a similar score. Hyman defeated
Hank Edwards 2 up. Dillon went
into the quarter-finals by putting
out Jack Welch by a lopsided 7-5
margin. Bob Welch stepped into the
chosen circle by winning 3-2 from
Pearson.
In the most spectacular match of
the afternoon the old rivals, Er
skine and Stewart got together. Er
skine was on the short end of a 6-5
score but when the match ended
Stewart was 5 under par.
