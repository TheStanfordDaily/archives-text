# Swimming Mentor Explains 'Fast' Pools
## 
### 
What makes a swimming pool
"fast" has been cleared up by Coach
Nort Thornton. Long, narrow pools
cut down speed because there are
too few turns and the wave action
is against the swimmer. Swimmers
gain a half a second on a turn, and
wide pools tend to spread the wave ,
action out.
High rates of speed are possible
in Stanford's 75 by 40-foot pool, con
tinued Thornton, and it is therefore
ideal for fast time. Having the level ;
of the water at the drain gutters is
important because it lessens wave ;
action by drawing off surplus water. ,
