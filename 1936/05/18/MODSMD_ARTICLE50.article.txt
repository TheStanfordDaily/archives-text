## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Actual Meaning of "Intelligent Thinking" Muddled by a Befuddled Student Union 
### 
Horrors of Capitalism, beauties of Commu- |
nism, and storm warnings concerning the in- j
evitable Class Struggle came in for only mod- I
erate elaboration v/hen 60 representatives of
American Student Union chapters of Northern
California gathered in conference at the Worn- j
en's Clubhouse Friday.
The meeting definitely was not for the pur- !
pose of pledging a new crop of "comrades."
Instead, it was to discuss ways of stirring up
interest among students in current social prob- I
lems, and to get a greater following for the
Student Union.
Serril Gerber, national field organizer for
A.S.U., made this very clear, by disclaiming
any connection between the Union and Commu
nism, asserting that "any Communistic feeling
within the ranks is purely a personal matter."
But the fact remains that the popular concep
tion of the American Student Union, at least on
the Stanford campus, is that its members and
beliefs are beyond Liberalism and tinted with
the more pronounced hues of red.
The majority of Stanford students will not
have their names associated with outright radi
calism. That is why the Union is making slow
headway 011 the Farm.
The Union, with its peculiar combination of
superiority and persecution complexes, fails to
see the true reason why more intelligent, ear
nest and deep-thinking students do not join up.
They blame it onto apathy, onto the fact that
Stanford students are spoiled, .pampered tools
of Capitalism, onto an unjustified lack of sym
pathy with their movement.
All of these alibis may have some basis, but

they all miss the essential point—that the A.S.U.
is popularly identified as a bunch of Red-hots,
and not a group of college intellectuals, actually
trying to study the current social problems that
they shout so much about.
When a college student says, as did Larry
Resner, editor of the Daily Californian, in Fri
day's organization meeting, that "Communism
is the perfect state," he admits, in effect, that
he is not a real student, but is just jumping at
the conclusion that "Capitalism is all wrong;
Communism is the other extreme, and hence is
all right."
As long as its leaders continue to preach
doctrines in a dogmatic "this-is-the-only-answer"
manner, the Uniop will never serve what could
be an admirable purpose.
While the A.S.U. shouts for "intelligent think
ing," why, in the name of all that is intelligent,
doesn't it face what it deems the important social
problems of the day, actually investigate them
in an attempt to determine their causes, and
then search for a workable answer?
Why look at these problems, assume that be
cause there are maladjustments, the whole sys
tem is wrong, and that, conversely, the opposite
extreme would be right? Maybe there is a
middle ground that is more satisfactory.
The Union members — those of them who
proudly boast they are radicals—do not have
the scientific attitude. Their attitude more nearly
approaches a mob psychology.
The A.S.U. would get a greater following—
and a more intelligent one—if they would ac
tually become an American Student Union, in
stead of a group popularly considered a Stalin
for-President Club.

tually become an American Student Union, in
stead of a group popularly considered a Stalin
for-President Club.
Horrors of Capitalism, beauties of Commu- |
nism, and storm warnings concerning the in- j
evitable Class Struggle came in for only mod- I
erate elaboration v/hen 60 representatives of
American Student Union chapters of Northern
California gathered in conference at the Worn- j
en's Clubhouse Friday.
The meeting definitely was not for the pur- !
pose of pledging a new crop of "comrades."
Instead, it was to discuss ways of stirring up
interest among students in current social prob- I
lems, and to get a greater following for the
Student Union.
Serril Gerber, national field organizer for
A.S.U., made this very clear, by disclaiming
any connection between the Union and Commu
nism, asserting that "any Communistic feeling
within the ranks is purely a personal matter."
But the fact remains that the popular concep
tion of the American Student Union, at least on
the Stanford campus, is that its members and
beliefs are beyond Liberalism and tinted with
the more pronounced hues of red.
The majority of Stanford students will not
have their names associated with outright radi
calism. That is why the Union is making slow
headway 011 the Farm.
The Union, with its peculiar combination of
superiority and persecution complexes, fails to
see the true reason why more intelligent, ear
nest and deep-thinking students do not join up.
They blame it onto apathy, onto the fact that
Stanford students are spoiled, .pampered tools
of Capitalism, onto an unjustified lack of sym
pathy with their movement.
All of these alibis may have some basis, but

they all miss the essential point—that the A.S.U.
is popularly identified as a bunch of Red-hots,
and not a group of college intellectuals, actually
trying to study the current social problems that
they shout so much about.
When a college student says, as did Larry
Resner, editor of the Daily Californian, in Fri
day's organization meeting, that "Communism
is the perfect state," he admits, in effect, that
he is not a real student, but is just jumping at
the conclusion that "Capitalism is all wrong;
Communism is the other extreme, and hence is
all right."
As long as its leaders continue to preach
doctrines in a dogmatic "this-is-the-only-answer"
manner, the Uniop will never serve what could
be an admirable purpose.
While the A.S.U. shouts for "intelligent think
ing," why, in the name of all that is intelligent,
doesn't it face what it deems the important social
problems of the day, actually investigate them
in an attempt to determine their causes, and
then search for a workable answer?
Why look at these problems, assume that be
cause there are maladjustments, the whole sys
tem is wrong, and that, conversely, the opposite
extreme would be right? Maybe there is a
middle ground that is more satisfactory.
The Union members — those of them who
proudly boast they are radicals—do not have
the scientific attitude. Their attitude more nearly
approaches a mob psychology.
The A.S.U. would get a greater following—
and a more intelligent one—if they would ac
tually become an American Student Union, in
stead of a group popularly considered a Stalin
for-President Club.
