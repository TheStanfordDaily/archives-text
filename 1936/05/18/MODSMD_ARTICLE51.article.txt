# Pre-Reg Period Has More Than One Possibility
## 
### 
Coining out in favor of a pre-registration pe- f
riod, on which an A.S.S.U. committee has been
working for the past month, is just about as [
sensational as a candidate for A.S.S.U. president
coming out flat-footed in favor of co-operation, !
for student opinion seems universally behind ,
such a move.
But faculty members and administrators, who j
will have to take over the working of such a
program, have not always been so favorable to j
such a proposal. Lower Division advisers have
particularly stated that the period at present
allotted for Reg. day consultation is adequate, i
that the students already know what "pipe
courses" there are to take. |
This rather cynical attitude on the part of the '
faculty is not an invention of theirs, but the ,
result of contact with the students.
The question is, could longer contact with
faculty members do anything to change that
student attitude, or can anything be done to
change that attitude?
There are enough good points about the pro
posed pre-registration day in such things as
Honor Code education, adequate physical tests,
and campus tours, to recommend that it be
given without the controversial faculty-advising
scheme, yet it seems too bad to drop that idea, j
Therefore, instead of coming out in favor of
something everyone approves, we really ad- 1

vance a radical proposal: we are in favor of a
college education.
