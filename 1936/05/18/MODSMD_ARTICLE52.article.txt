A Challenge
(From (lie Cornell Sun)
Despite a partiality toward nicety of phrase rather
than directness of point, President Angell of Yale
.struck effectively at the shortcomings of modern uni
versity education in his annual report, and clearly in
dicated the remedy. As Dr. Angell advised, it is high
time that the American university took "stock of its
tangible contributions to the common weal" and dis
covered what its real duty is and if it is being ful
filled.
Although the value of university education has been
sharply assailed of late, no thoughtful person has asked
for complete retreat from the lofty ideals of scholar
ship or the devotion to pure learning. It is not demand
ed that universities become technical institutions and
produce men fitted for specialized positions, but rather
that a so-called higher education fits men for finding
a solution to the compelling social problems which
confront the world today.
This purpose, which Dr. Angell considers the
primary duty of the university today, has little, if any
place, in modern education which tends, instead,
toward the gratification of a desire for learning, pure
or not.
Endowed universities, such as Cornell and Yale,
have, in spite of loyalty oaths and legislative investiga
tions, the greatest, freedom in pursuit of knowledge.
Unfortunately, this liberty has not brought the right
results. Dr. Angell commends the "pronounced swing
in the interest of students toward the social sciences,"
but laments the absence of courses to fulfill and en
large this interest.
♦ * * *
His lament need not be confined to Yale. Few
American universities fully justify ihe "intellectual
and moral freedom which they so jealously and prop
erly cherish." The university's relation to current
problems of society is rarely considered; the aid which
university graduates mimht and should give to solving
these problems is not forthcoming. Social science may
not be, as President Angell feels, the duty of the uni
versity, but it is, surely, the service which the univer
sity i.s particularly competent to offer.
