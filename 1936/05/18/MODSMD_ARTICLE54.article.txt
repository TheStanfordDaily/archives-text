According to reports, politics is rampant on the
campus. I think this is going too far. Politics is clean
at Stanford, even if Stanford is clean disgusted at
politics.
But it is certainly dirty to say that politics is
rampant. I've heard of angora sweaters but rampants
have evil connotations. It smacks too much of the
League of Decency. (As if the League of Decency
could smack of anything, what with all they've said
about fishing smacks.)
But it is certainly filthy to say the politics is ram
pant. If a rampants that's his own business.
Maybe it s due to all the sheepish looks on the faces
of Stanford's political citizenry.
There are smiles that make me happy, there are
smiles that make me blue, there are smiles that fill my
day with sunshine, and then again, there are smiles to
get my votes.
The boys who have been pumping my hand for all
these days, have forgotten that they have to prime
me before they can expect to get any results.
It sounds like* an old gag, but when the next guy
asks me what I m running for, I'm going to reply
Cause that's her father right behind me."
Which reminds me, that a pretty girl is like a
melody. Yeh—"Don't Mention Love to Me."
People have been complaining that this column
has nothing to do with hashing. They'll admit, though,
that it is greatly concerned with butchery.
