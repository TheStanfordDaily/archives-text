Larry Resner, outgoing editor of j
: the Daily Californian and end-man I
for the American Student Union, is
a Das Kapital-pounder as an evan
-1 gelist is a Bible-pounder.
Both are fanatics. One believes in !
the inevitabilitv of th<» worlH-rpvn- i

1 me liievuaoiiity or
lution, that Com-
J munism is the
j best form of gov
] ernment, that
| destiny will sure
j ly make workers
I out of selfish cap
-1 italists. The other
J believes in the
I second coming,
the end of thel
1 world, the fact |
{ that God made
Eve out of Ad
-1 '_ 1,

I am s rib.
Larry may be right. Even intel- i
! lectually sluggish and morally I
chauvinistic Stanfordites—poor souls
who think the class struggle is the
Junior Prom—are willing to admit
the possibility of a workers' revolt
and the confiscation of unearned j
Packards.

j Though brought up to worship
J Capitalism and its economic dog- |
j eat-dog philosophy, we can believe
that it may not be the last stage in
the world's development, that per
-1 haps we shall have to choose be
| tween Communism and Fascism
j some time soon.
1 But where Larry Resner and Stan- 1
j ford go their separate ways is not
i on opinion but on convictions. Larry j
! doesn't admit things as possibilities, i
j He admits them as inevitables. To 1
j him, as to many others like him, 1
j Communism is not possibly the best j
government. It is absolutely the best I
government. The vfjrld revolu- !
tion isn't a "maybe," it's a certainty, j
Now Stanfordites really should f
concern themselves about what is j
going to happen to the world in
i which Miller's is located.
But that Stanfordites do not worry
about it to the extent of joining the
| American Student Union is due in
| large measure to just such people
| as Larry Resner.
Larry is positive about the supe- '
! riorities of Communism. He is |
"converted." And because he is ar- I
i ticulate, he has not only identified
himself with the American Student
Union, the American Student Union I
has identified itself with him.
Though the organization is not it- ,
i self officially pledged to Communism
or the overthrow of Capitalism, Lar- |
ry, and other fanatics like him, have
; painted it a bright, subversive, un- '
intelligent red —the redness of the
j soapbox, of the malcontent, of the '
short-sighted positivist.
* * *
No wonder then that Stanfordites
shy clear of it —not because it is red !
but because it seems fanatically red.
We may not be conscious of our
place in the van of progressive
youth. We may know little about
Capitalism, less about Communism,
nothing about the world revolution.
But one thing we do know—that
nothing is absolutely right or wrong,
and that anyone who absolutely
| dings one idea, absolutely approves
of another, is possibly dead wrong
