The Editor, Sir:
Nowhere is the splendid intellec
tuality and gentlemanliness that
Stanford inculcates into her young |
men better displayed than in the |
Reserve Book Room of the Phi
Bete's haven.
Skipping over such trivialities as ;
dog-earing pages, breaking bind
ings, emptying fountain pens on the ;
printed pages, absconding with
books the night before exes, and
like innocuous pleasantries, let us
look at the really worthwhile serv
ices students contribute.
Firstly, there is the perpetual i
marker. This breed demonstrates its 1
discriminatory powers by carefully
underlining supposedly vital pas
sages and salient points. This saves
later readers the unnecessary bother i
of thinking for themselves, and may
readily be seen as a boon to the edu
cational process.
Moreover, after several underlin- 1
ings by energetic readers, the pages
soon assume a much livelier aspect
than that afforded by plain white 1
paper and black type. •
Of course, just occasionally, the '
process is carried a wee bit too far i
and the undorlinings distort the |
author's original meaning or oblit
erate the context. But, no matter, |
the advantages overwhelm such |
minor disturbances.
Secondly, there is the possessor of
the scientific attitude so long urged !
by instructors of the late Citizenship
course. This type of student yearns I
to make critical evaluations of the |
passages. That future readers may
about both of them. We cite Com- |
munist-loving, Fascist-hating Larry
Resner, and Communist-hating, Fas
cist-loving Willie Hearst.

nut lose the value of his priceless
comments, he writes them in ink.
Such comments never arise from
mere prejudice, but flow from deep
wells of knowledge coming from
years of research upon the part of
the commentator. Indubitably, he is
in a better position to judge than ;
some flibberty-gibberty professor, j
who, under the guise of scholarly in- I
vestigation, has presumed to pro- 1
mulgate his own half-cocked i
theses.
The Reserve Room should indeed j
be a revelation to those calamity- i
howlers who think the more liberal !
colleges of the country are not pro- ■
ducing youth capable of level-head- |
edly solving the problems of the ,
world.
