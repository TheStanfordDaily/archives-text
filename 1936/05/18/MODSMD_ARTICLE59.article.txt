# COMMON DECENCY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For the past few months there has

I been a great deal of discussion 011J
' the subject of the Stanford Honor
Code. I have a great deal of faith
in the honor of Stanford students
but I feel that there is a far more
important subject to be considered
at present. This subject Ls tearing
j pages from books out of the Stanford
I Library.
To tear pages out of books is not
mainly a matter of honor, but it is !
j a matter of common deceny and i
respect to fellow students to leave |
I articles in magazines and books, so
j that others may derive what in
! formation they may desire from;
them.
