"Communists have the solution to
our present problems," said Larry
Resner, former editor of the Daily
Californian, to a handful of Stanford
students and delegates from Fresno
State and San Jose State at the
meeting of the American Student
Union in the Women's Clubhouse
Friday afternoon.
Decrying campus indifference, but
predicting an awakening of the
Stanford student body, Resner said
that in a few years the two institu
tions might be vieing with one an
other as to which could get out the
| most strikers on Peace Day.
"We might put up the axe as a
trophy to the school with the most
students on strike," he said.
Serril Gerber, field organizer for
the student union, outlined the four
major problems which the organiza
tion is attempting to do something
about. He listed them as economic
security, the imminent danger of
way, academic freedom, and the
race problem.
"The greatest agitator in the
country is William Randolph
Hearst," Gerber said. "Do away
I with him and we will have no more
student movement in this country."
Another speaker termed Hearst "our
most permanent issue."
