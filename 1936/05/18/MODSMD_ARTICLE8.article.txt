# Campus Fields Fired
## Stanford To Fight Arson 
### 
The collegiate "prank" of hay
stack firing brought campus authori
ties to their feet Friday in a drastic
attempt to curb wilful destruction
of Farm fields and constant menace
to University buildings.
Action became imperative after
nine fires were started simulta
neously at different parts of the
campus at 12 o'clock Thursday
night. Two earlier blazes had oc
curred at It) o'clock. ..
"In order to meet the situation,"
says Comptroller A1 Roth, "the
University will take the following
steps:
"A sufficient number of watchmen
will be employed to apprehend any
one who wilfully sets fire anywhere
on the Stanford campus. Anyone so
apprehended will be turned over to
the civil authorities for punishment
in accordance with the laws relat
ing to arson, and the cost of such
additional watchmen's service to
gether with the cost of the property
destroyed will be assessed against
such individual.
Arsonists Expelled
"Any student who wilfully sets
fire, destroys fire protection equip
ment, or turns in false alarms will
be recommended for expulsion from
the University."
Obviously, the campus fire equip
ment is not sufficient to cope with
nine fires in different localities oc
curing at the same time. While there
are four pieces of equipment ready
to protect Stanford, only two of
these can be used against grass fires.
Trucks Described
One is a Cadillac truck with a
water-tank maximum capacity .of
175 gallons; the other is a Ford
chemical truck of 60 gallons. "Even
with ten times this amount of equip
ment," Chief R. E. Dugan said last
night, "we would be no better off
against so many fires in so many
places.
"If, a wind should arise when a

hay stack was ablaze, we would be
confronted by the same sort of fire
that destroyed so much of Berkeley
a few years ago. Then the combined
forces of all the Bay cities fire de
partments proved ineffective against
a grass fire that started three miles
from the city!
"You can see it is absolutely nec
essary that we attend every single
blaze around the campusâ€”a thing
that is impossible for us to do if
the present mania for hay stack fir
ing continues."
University Menaced
Roth further states: "Another se
rious hazard arises from the fact that
when the fire department is respond
ing to these calls (i.e., burning hay
stacks) the University plant and
residences on the campus are in
adequately protected . . .
"It is extremely in
handling fires that equipment be
available at the fi rehouse. Further
more, the wilful destruction of
property at a time when the Univer
sity and the country generally are
facing serious financial difficulties,
is a sad commentary on the intel
ligence and dependability of the
Stanford men."
