## Forensic Year Ends With Banquet for Chapin 
### 
Bob Mallett was presented with
the Ronald Kay Memorial trophy,
awarded.to the outstanding debater
of the year, last Friday evening
when forensic activities closed with
the annual banquet at the Union.
Mallett's first appearance as a
Stanford debater this year was
against the University of Melbourne
in January.
.A month later he won the Com
monwealth Club debate against
California speakers. That contest
was the second most important of
the year, awarding individual, not
team, supremacy.
Mallett was also a member of the
team that traveled to U.C.L.A. in
March to compete in the Pacific For
ensic League Tournament.
This year the banquet honored
Professor Lee Chapin, coach, who
left the Farm Saturday for a six
month stay in Europe.
