# 'Not a Candidate' For Nomination, Hoover Declares
## Interested Only in Critical Issues, Not Men, Says Republican Head 
### 
CHICAGO, May 18 (/P).—Former
President Herbert Hoover announced
today, "I am not a candidate" for
the Republican presidential nomi
nation.
Mr. Hoover's declaration of his po
sition was contained in a formal

resume of an in
terview handed to
reporters in the
former President's
hotel suite here.
The resume
said:
"As to his per
sonal position, Mr.
Hoover said:
" 'It should be
evident by this
time that I am
not a candidate,
I have stated
many times that I

have no interest but to get these
critical issues before the country,
[las No Delegates
"'I have rigidly prevented my
friends from setting up any organ
ization, and from presenting my
name in any primary or to any
Stale convention, and not a single
delegate of Califoria or any other
State is pledged to me.' "
Mr. Hoover added:
"That should end such discussion.
"And get one thing straight—l am
not opposing any of the candidates.
"My concern is with principles."
Mr. Hoover's statement began:
"My discussions with Senators,
Congressmen, and others who visited
me from Washington over the
week-end related wholly to the Re
publican platform."
Calls on Governor Lowdcn
In another paragraph, he said
former Governor Lowden of Illi
nois "should be asked to write the
agricultural plank for the conven
tion."
After discussing his own position,
Mr. Hoover went on to say:
"The convention will be com
posed of a most unusual and able
personnel.
"The seriousness of the conven
tion is evidenced by the fact that
the large majority of the cV legates
are being sent by the people of
the States without other instruction
than to find the right thing to do
for the country in the greatest crisis
we have met in two generations."


I HERBERT HOOVER.
