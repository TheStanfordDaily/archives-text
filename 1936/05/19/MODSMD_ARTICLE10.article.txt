# Record Farm Turnout, Close Races Seen In A.S.S.U. Vote Today
## Law Step Polls Open at 8:30; Thirty Student Body, Class Offices Are Set for Balloting 
### 
Stanford's 3900 will survey a field of can
didates practically void of hands-down fa
vorites when they go to the Law Steps polls
today to elect a new president of the Asso
tabulation process in English Corner rooms,
serve during the 1936-37 term.
Balloting will start at 8:30 o'clock this
morning, according to Chairman Jim Lud
lam, and will continue until 2 o'clock, when
members of the Election Board begin the

j tabulation process in English Cor-*
I ner rooms.
Names of 66 candidates will ap-
I pear on nine vari-colored ballots.
Today's activity will climax ap
proximately two weeks of intensive
1 campaigning by Hall, Row, and other
political interests. As a result of
| numerous caucuses and he distri
bution of sample ballots, observers
predicted a record vote with a par
ticularly heavy return from off
! campus students.
No Duplication
Campaign workers will be warned
j against illegal procedure by lines
j five yards from the polls which will
i indicate the restricted area. To pre
! vent duplication, each student's name
! will be crossed off a directory list as
; he applies for ballots.
"Today's election is unusual in
i that more than ordinary interest is
j being shown in the class and minor
I offices," Ludlam declared last night.
I "Although competition is extremely
close for the A.S.S.U. positions, the
j other races probably will receive
strong emphasis in the voting.
Open Tabulation
"All candidates, and others with
| written authorization from candi
dates, will be permitted to witness
the tabulation of ballots," he said.
Members of the Election Board
i who will assist Ludlam in conducting
the elections are Dave Allison, Betta
Brock, Bob Clark, Audrey Brum
field, Bud Lesser, Elsie Lillard, Jane
Offield, Paul VVallin, Sis Young, and
Helen Zwick.
