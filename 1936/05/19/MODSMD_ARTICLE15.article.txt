### Barbara Sweet 
Will I be able to get a job when
I graduate next month?
This is the question that hundreds
of seniors arc asking themselves now
that June and diplomas are omi
nously near. What are the chances
for the Class of '36 in the employ
ment field?
"Chances art good!" according to
Miss Ruth Trackscll, executive as
-1 sistant of the University appoint
ment service. "Anyone with train
ing, interest, and enthusiasm wili
probably be able to find employ
ment, provided he has normal,
pleasing personality and good
i health."
System a Success
Very few of last year's class who
registered with the appointment
service are unemployed, she pointed
out. Those who do not have jobs
placed very stringent restrictions on
the type of job they would accept or
the location of their employment.
Miss Tracksell advises women to
I obtain secretarial training before
going job-hunting. "Typing and
shorthand are often opening wedges
to better positions," she pointed out.
Further valuable advice as to how
to get employment was given re
cently by R. S. Uhrbrock, research
director of the Industrial Relations
Division of Proctor and Gamble
! Company.

| Take the first job thai comes
I along, even if it isn't dough-heavy,
he recommends. It is better to carry
1 your own weight financially than be
| in the unemployed ranks. You will
! then be in a better position to get
the job that is your ultimate goal, for
many employers believe that the
: man who is employed is better than
the one who is out of work.
The interview is of great import
; anee, he believes. The more people
you interview, the more you will
1 know about interviewing. The poise
and confidence you acquire aids in
i meeting others. A neat personal ap
pearance also gives an applicant
self-confidence.
Use Consideration
i Each partner in the interview
should give and get facts. Try put
i ting yourself in the employer's po
sition, then figure out straight
( forward answers for the questions
he might ask. Itemize essential facts
and introduce these facts conversa
tionally.
Don't give the impression of being
a time waster is another important
I point. Keep appointments faithfully.
If you apply by mail remember your
letter of application represents you.
Cheek it for spelling, margins, para
graphing, sentence structure, and
neatness. Any one letter of conse
quence is more valuable than 1000
i letters from ordinary people.
