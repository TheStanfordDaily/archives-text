### Les Squires 
I see by the papers that steelman
Schwab,
Off for a rest from his tiresome job,
Gave his advice in manner pater
nal—•
Don't strive for riches, they're really
infernal.
Now there's a platitude
That's really rather rude.
He's nfr to Europe for the jolly ride
In the royal suite of the nation's
pride,
With caviar and turkey handy,
And a fine big bottle of Napoleon
brandy.
Arid .still he preaches,
Don't .strive for riches.
Thi* features the act of a man named
Ford,
Who paused on a drive, the papers
record,
To watch several men endeavor to
start
A certain famed brand of model T
car.
110 yelled, of course,
"Go get a horse!"
This same chap Ford, we haste to
mention,
Has just discovered what's wrong
with the nation,
In a few short words he clears up
(he haziness,
It .seems it's just a case of laziness.
Perhaps at cars we ought to balk,
To save the state we all must walk.
The bashful San Francisco cops ex
plain
That money falls on them like heav
en's rain.
It's just a simple little task, they say,
To save a fortune from their daily
pay-
The woodpile banks
Play interest pranks.
A doctor reports the case of a lad
Whose antics made everyone think
he was mad.
The trouble, you see. ni his case was
this:
He shouldn't have put eggs on his
diet list.
It's a fact, the doctors *say,
That foods may drive you azy-cray.
The quints and quads find lots to do,
As quads are born and quints near
two,
The Keys quads boost the state of
Texas;
The quints begin to pay their in
come taxes.
A negro lady claims a seven.
We'll next expect a pat eleven.
