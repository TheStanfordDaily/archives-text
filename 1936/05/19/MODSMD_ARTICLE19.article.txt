\ ciled message:
An Open Letter
To Mr. Franich and Mr. Reynolds:
In order that the student body
j may become better acquainted with

the issues of the
present campaign,
I challenge you to
a delegate before
any student group
that may be or
ganized for such
an event before
the election.

For the sake of fair play I hope
that this appeal will not be distorted
as every other utterance I have
made. I realize that it is not you
gentlemen but irresponsible follow
ers who have conducted the mali
cious whispering campaign against
me.
Sincerely,
Bob Bernhard
Mr. Bernhard undoubtedly refers,
in his "whispering campaign" al
legation, to the famous, "Do you
think crack-pots should run for
office?" which is no longer a
whisper.
He claims to be representing the
independent protest vote. Protest
against what? Traffic fines, Union
food, and the dramatic set-up? Even
Bernhard is not quite sure.
Question: Why didn't he issue his
challenge in time to have the de
bate?
Malicious allegation number two—
that Vigna intends to withdraw
from the contest. His write-in cam
paign will go on vigorously, says
Vigna—Burrows and Adams not
withstanding.
