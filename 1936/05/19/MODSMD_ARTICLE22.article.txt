# Psych Prof Invents Note-Taking System
## Combines Writing And Drawing Methods 
### Dave Botsford 
Have you ever found, when time
J came to study lecture and reading
notes, that you couldn't read your
i own writing? Or have you ever
; tried to decipher another person's
! shorthand? More than likely you
j couldn't do it.
Note Script, a new system of con- i
| densed writing devised by Stanford's
, own psychology professor. Dr. John
Edgar Coover, puts an end to such
| difficulties. While it retains the ad- j
vantages of ordinary handwriting '
and shorthand, it eliminates the |
drawbacks of both.

Last week-end, coatless and his
blue shirtsleeves rolled up past his
elbows, Dr. Coover was sitting at his
desk in the psych building pulling I
the final touches to his three-volume !
manual and reading text on Note- :
Script.
He was still using the small steel
pen-point he started the work with
over two years ago. Yesterday Note-
Script went to the University Press
for publication, will be ready next
fall for public use.
Overcomes Difficulties
Handwriting and most shorthands
, are "written," not "drawn." But Dr.
j Coover explains that you can draw
I faster than you can write. This is
l because writing engages the large
1 arm and shoulder muscles while
1 drawing engages only the small fin
ger and wrist muscles. Thus when
speed is attempted in "writing," the
largest muscles cannot be adequately
controlled and illegal scrawls result.
Note Script overcomes these dif
ficulties. It takes the essential ele
ments of each letter, joins them to- i
gether with "drawing, small
muscled ' strokes to form a word.
Railroads of the U.S. operate on '
i more than 260,000 miles of rails.
