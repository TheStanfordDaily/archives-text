# Wilbur Reveals Possibility Of Science Journal
## Publishing Facilities Make Appearance Inevitable, Though Not Immediate 
### 
Probability that Stanford some i
day will have not only a social sei- j
ences journal, but a whole group of >
social sciences, medical, engineering, |
and chemical journals was expressed !
by President Ray Lyman Wilbur
yesterday in a Daily interview.
The position of Stanford with its j
competent faculty and its estab- j
lished publishing facilities in the j
University Press, make it certain
that those publications will inevi- j
tably appear at the University, he j
pointed out.
However, immediate realization of j
the hope of publishing a social sci
ences journal waits on the contribu
tion of an endowment from some
outside source, or the organizing
ability of "some young man," since j
money lies again at the root of the j
situation, according to the president.
He did not think that the trustees j
would see their way clear to divert
money from present restricted bud
get requirements and thus "cut off a
strong limb to graft on a weak and j
doubtful branch."
But he considered that con- ;
tinned agitation for (he project i
might not he unavailing for it j
might possibly bring about the ae- j
coniplishment of its purpose.
The idea of the local publication j
of a social sciences journal was re- |
vived recently by the Daily. It had j
been discussed several years ago in j
academic circles and later dropped. |
The journal would attempt to j
emulate the Yale Review, classic in |
the college journal field, and be a
medium for and a leader of cul- !
tural activity in the West.
