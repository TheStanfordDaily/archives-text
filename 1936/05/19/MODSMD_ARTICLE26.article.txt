# A.S.U. STAND CLARIFIED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This letter is written to clarify
misconception regarding the Ameri
can Student Union, that may have
arisen from yesterday's Daily edi
torial.
The A.S.U. includes representa
tives of all progressive groups in
the American student body—paci
fists, internationalists, religious
groups, socialists, and communists.
All of these groups are represented
equally on the National Executive
Committee.
The A.S.U. was formed to co-or
dinate the efforts of the broadest
possible group in meeting the im
mediate problems facing American
students — WAR, ACADEMIC
FREEDOM, ECONOMIC SECUR
ITY, and RACIAL DISCRIMINA
TION.
The A.S.U. holds no brief for the
ultimate solution of human prob
lems; but upon these specific issues
we take a positive stand. On these
issues impartiality is futility —we
cannot be both for and against war.
We actively oppose war and all
preparations which today are lead
ing toward war.
The A.S.U. in its five months of
existence can already point to sig
nificant accomplishment. The A.S.U.
was the key organization behind the
nationwide peace demonstration on
April 22, in which 700,000 American
students participated.
Closer to our immediate concern
lies the fate of the N.Y.A. Three
months ago the administration an
nounced the cancellation of further
student aid. The A.S.U. was largely
responsible for bringing the testi
mony of Charles A. Beard, Francis
Gorman, and 1200 students before
the Senate investigation committee.
The result was continuance and ex
tension of federal student aid, which
will affect nearly 500.000 of the na

] tion's youth, and more than 500 men
and women at Stanford alone.
The complexion of the A.S.U. at
Stanford will depend wholly upon
its membership here. The A.S.U.
plans to establish a monthly student
forum, sponsor student-faculty di.s
cuksion, and publish a monthly re
view here on the campus.
We believe that there is at Stan
' ford an intelligent interest and con
corn in these problems. It is with
• that justification that the A.S.U. was
i formed.
