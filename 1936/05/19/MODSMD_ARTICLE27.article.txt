GOVERNOR MERRIAM
AND WARREN DIXON

While the records were being
broken and the Cards were tying ihe
previously "untouchable" Trojans
and Warren Dixon was running a
mile in 4:17 at Fresno, there were a
lew fairly interesting tidbits which
might be labeled in the "human in
terest" basket.
I he one that is basically the fun
niest and should be a classic, but
which will look awfully weak in
black and white, is the one this self
same intrepid Dixon pulled just be
fore the medley relay start. Charac
ters in the little drama are: Dixon,
medley relay teams from Stanford,
S.C., Olympic Club, Cal, officials,
managers, three flag-bearers, and
Fr;,nk F. Merriam, governor of this
sovereign state.
Just before the medley relay start
ed a great fanfare of trumpets was
heard on the dimly lighted held and
a little group ol citizens, including
the flag bearers and Guv'nor Mer
riam, appeared on the lawn. The
little band stepped gingerly across
the field to the rhythm of "Stars and
Stripes Forever," turned an abrupt
left, and headed straight up toward
where the medley rylay was im
patiently awaiting its start.
It was a very incongruous little
band of marchers, to say the least,
with the marching music and the
three pompous flag bearers leading
the puffing/ heavy jowled, elderly
Governor sweetly smiling across the
track.
As all eyes were upon him and the
music had reached its military cli
max and the flag bearers strutted
and everyone was silent to wait and
see what the Governor was going to
do next, out from the little group
of runners came Dixon's voice, car
rying easily into the near stands,
saying, "Hi there, Frank."
Mr. Merriam turned, gulped, and
smilingly answered, "Hello, fellows,"
and proceeded on up into the
stands.
Dixon and the guy who told me
about this thought it was riotously
funny, even though no one else
might.

BRIGHT LATE AGAIN;
FINALLY GETS CLOCK

Even though (his last incident may
not be very hot, it must have been
something when a big yellow-jacket
got into GifT Myers' upper and stung
him four times on the way down.
Then Norm Blight was late again
for the fifth time, counting his
tardiness in the two-mile at the re
cent Card-O.C. meet. Fresno officials
were doing their best to make the
Relays a good show like the Olym
pics or a horse-race by leading the
athletes around a bit before the race.
Ben Eastman and ihe other run
nels didn t resent being led around
much, but Bright balked and just
barely got around in time for his
race, ft might have been all right
two, or three, or four times, but
(he filth seems to be carrying it a
bit too far, Norm.
Bright, however, finally has a
watch to wear around. He got one
last February in the Madison Square
Garden Indoor Meet and brought il
home very proudly. It didn't run
quite right, however, so he took it
to (he jeweler's for minor repairs.
He never saw that watch again,
for the jeweler later told him that
"his brother" came in and took it
away. Norm has no brothers in this
stale.
So when the Relays people send
watches to winning Olympic Club
athletes, Norm will get his Waltham,
and tho sore spot that "his brother "
caused will be somewhat alleviated.
Speaking of the Fresno Relays,
though, you just can't leave old
Dixon out as probably the most
meritorious achievement. After be
ing a track man for fully 8 years, io
cut one's best persona! record in the
mile 6 seconds in one race is just
about wonderful—the nuts. Now
Dix is a prime choice to go back to
the N.C.2-A. —Breed

medley relay teams from Stanford,
S.C., Olympic Club, Cal, officials,
managers, three flag-bearers, and
Fr;,nk F. Merriam, governor of this
sovereign state.
Just before the medley relay start
ed a great fanfare of trumpets was
heard on the dimly lighted held and
a little group ol citizens, including
the flag bearers and Guv'nor Mer
riam, appeared on the lawn. The
little band stepped gingerly across
the field to the rhythm of "Stars and
Stripes Forever," turned an abrupt
left, and headed straight up toward
where the medley rylay was im
patiently awaiting its start.
It was a very incongruous little
band of marchers, to say the least,
with the marching music and the
three pompous flag bearers leading
the puffing/ heavy jowled, elderly
Governor sweetly smiling across the
track.
As all eyes were upon him and the
music had reached its military cli
max and the flag bearers strutted
and everyone was silent to wait and
see what the Governor was going to
do next, out from the little group
of runners came Dixon's voice, car
rying easily into the near stands,
saying, "Hi there, Frank."
Mr. Merriam turned, gulped, and
smilingly answered, "Hello, fellows,"
and proceeded on up into the
stands.
Dixon and the guy who told me
about this thought it was riotously
funny, even though no one else
might.

Even though (his last incident may
not be very hot, it must have been

got into GifT Myers' upper and stung
him four times on the way down.
Then Norm Blight was late again
for the fifth time, counting his
tardiness in the two-mile at the re
cent Card-O.C. meet. Fresno officials
were doing their best to make the
Relays a good show like the Olym
pics or a horse-race by leading the
athletes around a bit before the race.
Ben Eastman and ihe other run
nels didn t resent being led around
much, but Bright balked and just
barely got around in time for his
race, ft might have been all right
two, or three, or four times, but
(he filth seems to be carrying it a
bit too far, Norm.
Bright, however, finally has a
watch to wear around. He got one
last February in the Madison Square
Garden Indoor Meet and brought il
home very proudly. It didn't run
quite right, however, so he took it
to (he jeweler's for minor repairs.
He never saw that watch again,
for the jeweler later told him that
"his brother" came in and took it
away. Norm has no brothers in this
stale.
So when the Relays people send
watches to winning Olympic Club
athletes, Norm will get his Waltham,
and tho sore spot that "his brother "
caused will be somewhat alleviated.
Speaking of the Fresno Relays,

Dixon out as probably the most
meritorious achievement. After be
ing a track man for fully 8 years, io
