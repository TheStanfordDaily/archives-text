# Alumni Justify 'Finger In Farm Sports Pie'
## Cite Long-term Coaching Contracts, Faculty Rule As Chief Grievances 
### Bob Eisenbach 
Why alumni put their finger in
the B.A.C. pie and how they justify
keeping it there was explained
yesterday by a ranking Stanford |
alumnus widely regarded as an au- j
thority on campus athletes and ath- '
He gave the Daily inside reasons I
letics.
why sports-minded grads do not 1
approve of three-year coaching con- j
tracts and why they hold a Damo
clean sword over the heads of sports j
mentors; why they help certain stu- |
dents through school and why, in !
short, they want influence in Stan- ,
ford athletics.
Alumni feel their interest is hard
ly selfish, their suggestions hardly
pre-emptory or unreasonable, he
said.
Cited as attesting to graduate in
terest in sports are Branner Hall, j
Toyon Hall, Encina Commons, and !
Stanford's gymnasium plants, all 1
partly or completely financed by i
Board of Athletic Control earnings. |
These earnings, he believes, and
the enormous benefits to the en- '■
tire campus accruing from them,
are due in large measure not only j
to alumni money which helps po
tential athletes through school, j
but alumni interest and advice
after those athletes are on the
training field.
"We don't interfere just to have |
something to do but because we be- |
lieve we can serve the University l
in athletic matters," he declared.
"We are definitely holding out for |
short-term coaching contracts, for j
instance, because we are convinced |
that in so doing we are working in
the University's best interests.
"The problem hinges on the
fundamental difference between a
coach and a professor, a differ- j
encc in service automatically re- |
quiring a difference in status. A i
who can know little of the ins-and
outs of modern collegiate sport,
professor gains in mental power
and knowledge as he grows older.
A coach tends to reach a peak,
then begin a steady though slight i
decline. Coaches have to be phys
ically and mentally able to deliver, j
to actually demonstrate plays, to
be thinking and planning for their
work all the time.
"Should We place them under
three or five-year contracts, trying
to use their serivces in big hunks, J
we might conceivably get stuck.
"Furthermore, no thoroughly suc
cessful coach worries about a con
tract. He always knows he can get
another job.
Nor should faculty members com- I
pletely control the University's ath- ■
letic administration, he believes. If .
this were the case, we should have |
athletic advice coming from men
though absolutely tops in their aca
demic field."
