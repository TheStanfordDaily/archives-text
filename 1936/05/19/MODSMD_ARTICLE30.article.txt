# Seward, Underwood Lose Tennis Tourney
## 
### 
After building up a two-set ad
vantage against Henry Cully and
Joe Hunt in the Pacific Coast
Doubles Tourney at Santa Barbara
last week-end, Bill Seward and Bob
Underwood catapulted and lost a
5-set match 8-6, 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, 4-6.
Cully i.s considered one of the best
international doubles players, so it
seem* that the Stanford boys were
pitted against stiff opposition.

Captain John Law of the Indians
teamed with Sam Gorman, but was
eliminated in an early round. The
next encounter for Stanford tennis
men will be the National Clay
Court Tournament at Chicago fol
lowing final exams.
Sophomores won the interclass
soccer championship yesterday when
they whitewashed the juniors 3-0.
Karl Schaupp paced the victors with
two goals to his credit, and "Cookie"
Hawkins kicked (he other one.
