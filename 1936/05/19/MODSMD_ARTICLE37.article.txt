## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Voters Will Decide on "Best Man" Despite Sample Ballots and Platforms 
### 
If some of the powers behind the scenes of !
Row and Hall political factions had their way,
there wouldn't be anything but straight tickets
handed in at the polls today.
This conclusion has confusing premises since
both factions have gone about-face on the Hall-
Row split question.
First each group held strictly partisan cau- :
cuses and nominated its own candidates. Then 1
they both declared themselves in favor of a !
non-partisan political assembly to gvie the elec- i
torate a chance to choose for itself.
Eventually they reverted to the starting point j
and circulated "Vote a Straight Ticket" literature !
over the campus as late as last night.
But despite the high pitch of election fever ,
which apparently leads to the breaking of tra- !
dition, relatively few students will put faction J
loyalty before personal choices in today's vot- i
ing.
The Farm essentially has representative,
democratic student government, similar in j
skeleton form to state or national government, j
But the functions of the A.S.S.U. and its officers
are not to be compared to those of a civil gov- j
ernment.
In the first place, most of the posts which will j

be re-filled today are routine positions. Rules
higher than those of the students prevent any
elective officer from instituting radical changes
in his department. Every office has definite, cut
and dried functions.
Naturally, under these conditions, party plat
forms, which the major candidates feel obli
gated to draw up, are absurd. Seldom if ever
can there be burning issues in a campus elec
tion.
About all a political aspirant can do is express
his favor of things which will be promoted or
will come about in spite of any influence he may
exert one way or the other.
No issues, therefore, are at stake today.
That does not imply that the election of Stan
ford's student governors is insignificant or petty.
The trite expression, "Vote for the best man,"
holds good.
The winning candidates for many of the po
sitions will have important functions to perform
for the next year; winners in other races will be
mere figureheads.
Qualifications for these offices are fairly ap
parent; the question of which candidate is best
suited for each position is officially left in the
hands of the student electorate.

But despite the high pitch of election fever ,
which apparently leads to the breaking of tra- !
dition, relatively few students will put faction J
loyalty before personal choices in today's vot- i
ing.
The Farm essentially has representative,
democratic student government, similar in j
skeleton form to state or national government, j
But the functions of the A.S.S.U. and its officers
are not to be compared to those of a civil gov- j
ernment.
In the first place, most of the posts which will j

be re-filled today are routine positions. Rules
higher than those of the students prevent any
elective officer from instituting radical changes
in his department. Every office has definite, cut
and dried functions.
Naturally, under these conditions, party plat
forms, which the major candidates feel obli
gated to draw up, are absurd. Seldom if ever
can there be burning issues in a campus elec
tion.
About all a political aspirant can do is express
his favor of things which will be promoted or
will come about in spite of any influence he may
exert one way or the other.
No issues, therefore, are at stake today.
That does not imply that the election of Stan
ford's student governors is insignificant or petty.
The trite expression, "Vote for the best man,"
holds good.
The winning candidates for many of the po
sitions will have important functions to perform
for the next year; winners in other races will be
mere figureheads.
Qualifications for these offices are fairly ap
parent; the question of which candidate is best
suited for each position is officially left in the
hands of the student electorate.
If some of the powers behind the scenes of !
Row and Hall political factions had their way,
there wouldn't be anything but straight tickets
handed in at the polls today.
This conclusion has confusing premises since
both factions have gone about-face on the Hall-
Row split question.
First each group held strictly partisan cau- :
cuses and nominated its own candidates. Then 1
they both declared themselves in favor of a !
non-partisan political assembly to gvie the elec- i
torate a chance to choose for itself.
Eventually they reverted to the starting point j
and circulated "Vote a Straight Ticket" literature !
over the campus as late as last night.
