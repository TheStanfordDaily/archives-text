# No Sentimentality â€” Just An Expression of Loyalty
## 
### 
An endowment fund for Stanford is being
raised by the Class of '36 by soliciting at least
one dollar apiece from its members.
The fund is to be used for the support of a
university that started in a hayfield, a university
founded out of exuberant optism of a wealthy
railroad speculator, that got the spark of vision
from a great educator, and has now become an
institution known in the East as v/ell as the West
as a center of culture and education.
That it has attained this position can be at
trbiuted partly to chance and circumstance,
partly to the loyalty and respect it has com
manded from its faculty, students, and alumni.
The Class of '36 has been hardened in the
post-war era of cynicism, but it has also been
living for the past four years in a Stanford en
vironment.
The eventual critical evaluation of the alma
mater has not been the old optimism and the
silly sentimentality that told a Sacramento mer
chant a great University could rise near a Menlo
Park horse breeding farm.
But the Class of '36 in a critical, enlightened
way sees its chance to become a part of the
characteristic Stanford heritage.
No silly sentimentality, thanks, but the clear
understanding that without the support of the
rather characteristic, rather optimistic Stanford
spirit, a great University would not have been
born, and if it had been born would have lan
guished and died long ago.
