Mr. Hoover's stock as the nominal leader of
the Republican party will be on the rise today
with his declaration that he is not a candidate
for the presidential nomination being circulated
over the country.

terest in the coming campaign with speeches in
various parts of the country, Mr. Hoover's state
ments have been discounted by those who be
lieved that he was merely putting his name
before the public in an attempt to seek re-elec
tion.
"I have no interest but to get critical issues

before the country," the former President said
