Studying hard for your finals? Well then, here
are some figures to cheer and encourage you. The
average college graduate receives $72,000 more dur
ing his life-time than the average high school grad
uate, according to statistics compiled recently by the
Massachusetts department of labor and College of
Business Administration at Boston University.
'I he untrained man, statistics show, begins work at
14 years of age and obtains his maximum salary at 30.
He averages less than $1200 a year. His income, which
is determined by physical strength, decreases after his
fiftieth year. Between the ages of 14 and 60 he earns
a total of $45,000. Had he finished high school he
would have received but $2000 less of these wages.
The high school graduate, however, earns $33,000
more than the untrained worker. Beginning work at
18, he acquires his best position within seven years.
At 40, when he is receiving the maximum salary of
his career, he is getting $2200 a year. From 18 to
t»0 he earns $78,000.
Ihi" college graduate, on the other hand, earns
more than the total of one untrained man and one
high school graduate. During his life he earns $150,000.
fhough starting at 22, he obtains the maximum salary
of the high school graduate within six years. Since
his career does not depend primarily on physical
strength, he is often earning as much as $0000 an
nually at f)0 when the physical ability of the untrained
man has failed.
These are the financial reasons why finals, and
all college work, should and must be taken seriously
today when a college education is so much a taken
for-granted part of our educational system.
