Farm journalists have stuck tongue in cheek
for years and pointed verbal darts at the Uni
versity administration for devising ingenious
methods of parting students from their never
too ample bank-rolls.
But anything that Stanford administrators have
been accused of doing is put to shame by a
piece of truly "money-grasping" legislation put
through at the University of Oklahoma last
week.
The board of regents at that institution has
decided that for every unit of school work that
a student flunks a fine of $3 must be paid. The
president emphasized that "the penalty is not a
means of raising revenue for the university but
is designed to improve scholarship."
But whatever may have been the motive back
of the measure, it takes the prize for unadulter
ated academic "bulldoozing."
