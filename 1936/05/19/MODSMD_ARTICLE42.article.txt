In order to clarify all the issues in the present
A.S.S.U. election, Our Hasher presents a composite
platform:
1. I am in favor of the New Theater.
2. I am in favor of Stanford University.
3. I am in favor of co-operation.
4. I am in favor of prosperity.
5. I am in favor of myself.
6. People have been conducting a whispering cam
paign against me.
7. The students are discriminated against. The
Administration is discriminated against. God is dis
criminated against.
8. Union prices are too high. Traffic fines are too
high. Tuition is too high. I am too high.
9. The voters should vote for the best man.
10. I am the best man.
Or maybe it's: Always a best man, and never a
bride.
The conclusion, of course, is that in order to fill
an office, you first have to fill the voters.
Or stuff the ballot box.
As far as I can see, though, the only issues in the
present campaign arc bound to be disposable issues.
In other words, an issue of the A.S.S.U. government
is bound to be misbegotten.
Today it is the electorate. Tomorrow it is the ex
pect to rate, but it s worse on the end of your cigar.
Docs anybody know any good jokes?
