## KING OF THE GLOOMY 
### 
The one man who could rise to
such icy heights of dispassion that
he was able to view these civiliza
tions with a cold perspective that
few achieve is dead.
Oswald Spengler, whose genius
was in the field of pessimism, spent

j a life-time in lay
| ing before an in-
I terested but un
| sympathetic white
j race a prophecy
of defeatism and
futility—a proph
ecy that western
! civilization will
J decline to ruin
' and be succeeded
j by that of humans
with .skins of a
I tinted hue. And he

died, not recog
nized as a prophet, but as the world's
J gloomiest man.

As he passed, the eternal search
ers after silver linings heaved fig
urative sighs of relief. Declarations
were made that an era of black
! outlookings had ended. Poor Os
wald and his philosophy and con
| cepts were Frankenstein monsters to
I many who cared to observe and at
: tempt to understand. The whole
j they would like to see buried with
I the man.

Those things of which Spengler
wrote arc beyond the comprehension
! of the ordinary being. But from the
i attitude he personified—that of dis
satisfaction, criticism, and unrest —
made him king among those who
see the shallowness of the Rotary
| Club spirit of blind optimism. But
j even so, an imperfect kind at that.
For his attitude was one of utter
defeatism. He looked at western
civilization as a whole and saw in
evitable disaster. If he believed that
i the faulty parts of that civilization

had enough chance of repair to
forestall the end he saw, he did not
.say so. In that lay the impossibility
of his being usefully critical.

Those who admired Spengler, or
would have admired him had they
been exposed to his work, are the
critics in the true sense of the word
who suffer from being despised.
Gripers and beefers we usually call
them. They are not so much dis
satisfied with things as a whole as
with the parts that make up the
whole. They refuse to be led on in
the path of the majority, but stand
aside and object to those things
which seem obviously wrong. They
are usually detested, nearly always
heard, and seldom heeded. This
plight makes the critic unhappy and
therefore gloomy. And gloominess
is distasteful.
In these colleges we are sent to,
many absolutely new things are pre
sented to us. They are presented for
us to learn, not to judge, since most
of us refuse to be troubled with
judgments.
It is this majority, resigned to the
futility of objection, or happy with
