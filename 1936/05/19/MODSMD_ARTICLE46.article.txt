# Shirley Proves Versatile In 'Capt. January'
## 
### 
"CAPTAIN JANUARY" is a
harmless comedy in which Shirley
Temple is shown in ull of her ju
venile versatility.
The action takes place on the
docks of the Maine coast where
"Star" (Shirley Temple) is being

brought up by an old
light house keeper,
Captain January
(Guy Kibbee) who
has found her some
years earlier. Both
become very attach-

Ed to each other. Also aiding them
in and out of situations is an old
friend of Captain January's and now
a light house inspector (Slim Sum
merville).
Trouble making events are pro
vided when a new and very officious
truant officer moves into the district
and when news arrives that Captain
January's services will no longer be
needed.
The force of these events lead to
the necessity of finding someone re
lated to "Star." Just at the crucial
moment when the villain truant offi
cer is about to win a victory of tak
ing "Star," the sought relatives ap
pear on the scene. They take "Star"
to their palacial home. Soon "Star,"
the inspector, and Captain January
are happily joined after the latter
two have been given job.s on "Star's"
rich uncle's yacht.
"ABSOLUTE QUIET," in which
the major action takes place on a
Southwest dude ranch, leaves one
feeling that it was a picture made
a sense of momentary security,
which goes on unthinkingly and
which led Spengler to prophesy the
downfall of the West. It is the few
who do not give up hope for better
things who criticize.
And it is this majority which can
see no meaning in the phrase at the
right top corner of this page and
which reasons simply: "It is not for
us to reason why; it is for us to but
do or die."
—John McClelland

around a few out-worn plots in an
effort to meet a demand for second
features.
After a heart disorder Ceroid Ax
ton (Lionel Atwill) and his secre
tary go to his ranch for a rest.
Shortly after nightfall, an escaping
gunman and his moll drop in and
take possession of the house.
During the night one of the con
tinental planes, carrying a governor
with whom Axton has a quarrel,
one of Axton's castofT mistresses and
her new actor lover, a reporter, and
a spokesman for the governor, crack
up on Axton's private air field.
After much stalling around the
actor, becoming crazed as the result
of facial scars that ruin his career,
kills the escaping criminals. To cli
max the picture Axton's secretary's
husband, whom Axton had sent to
Los Angeles, drops in on the scene.
The police arrive and the show
ends. —Christiansen

phers show that the sands of the

"CAPTAIN JANUARY" is a
harmless comedy in which Shirley
Temple is shown in ull of her ju
venile versatility.
The action takes place on the
docks of the Maine coast where
"Star" (Shirley Temple) is being

brought up by an old
light house keeper,
Captain January
(Guy Kibbee) who
has found her some
years earlier. Both
become very attach-

Ed to each other. Also aiding them
in and out of situations is an old
friend of Captain January's and now
a light house inspector (Slim Sum
merville).
Trouble making events are pro
vided when a new and very officious
truant officer moves into the district
and when news arrives that Captain
January's services will no longer be
needed.
The force of these events lead to
the necessity of finding someone re
lated to "Star." Just at the crucial
moment when the villain truant offi
cer is about to win a victory of tak
ing "Star," the sought relatives ap
pear on the scene. They take "Star"
to their palacial home. Soon "Star,"
the inspector, and Captain January
are happily joined after the latter
two have been given job.s on "Star's"
rich uncle's yacht.
"ABSOLUTE QUIET," in which
the major action takes place on a
Southwest dude ranch, leaves one
feeling that it was a picture made
a sense of momentary security,
which goes on unthinkingly and
which led Spengler to prophesy the
downfall of the West. It is the few
who do not give up hope for better
things who criticize.
And it is this majority which can
see no meaning in the phrase at the
right top corner of this page and
which reasons simply: "It is not for
us to reason why; it is for us to but
do or die."
