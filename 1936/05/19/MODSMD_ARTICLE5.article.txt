Reynolds today explains reasons
for the recent formation of the
Stanford Fund plan.)

President, Stanford Associates
It has always seemed to me lhat
Stanford has a tradition of sentiment
and drama inherent in the manner
of its birth that transcends the story
of any university, and which con
stitutes a heritage challenging to
every Stanford man and woman,
from callow entering freshman to
decrepit, stumbling alumnus of the
earliest times.
It has further seemed that, in the
nearly half century of our existence,
that story has never been adequate
ly presented to the boys and girls
who are the beneficiaries of the de
votion and sacrifice which lies at
the foundation of our Stanford life.
Stresses Tradition
Speaking to the senior class, I
stressed the significance of college
tradition and showed how common
place is the history behind the tra
dition of many colleges as contrasted
with that record of sacrifice, of
tragedy, of devotion, of endurance,

! of determination to carry through,
despite most discouraging difii
culties, that lies at the root of our
founding and constitutes our treas
ured heritage.
I am hoping for an assembly in
i October in the nature of a Stanford
family conference, where adminis
tration, faculty, alumni and upper
classmen can make sure that enter
ing freshmen shall, at the very en
trance to this "happy valley," be
made aware of that Stanford her
itage and learn the privilege and
responsibility that are theirs as men
and women selected to carry on the
tradition.
Realize Suffering
They should know the human .suf
fering in that room in Florence at
the bedside of the dead son, where
the Stanford idea was born.
They should learn of the suit by
the government for 15 million dol
lars. Learn of the heroic struggle of
a grief-stricken woman left alone
to carr yon a dream, who refused
I to admit defeat and held on when
there was nothing in her except the
will that said to her, "Hold on."
She held on, not for the Ift dra
matic minutes that a football team
