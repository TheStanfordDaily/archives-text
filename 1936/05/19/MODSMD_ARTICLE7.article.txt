# Guffey Bill Outlawed
## U.S. Relief Called Illegal 
### 
WASHINGTON. D.C., May 18 (/P).
â€”In two almost simultaneous deci
sions the courts yesterday labeled
unconstitutional as many pieces of
vital New Deal legislation.
Holding the Guffey Coal Act an
invasion of rights reserved to the
stales, the Supreme Court, with
three members dissenting, invali
dated that law which was intended
to regulate hours, wages, working
conditions, and prices in the bitumi
nous coal industry.
Invalidates Belief Act
The tribunal acted just after the
District of Columbia Court of Ap
peals had held the 1935 Relief Act.
involved such an unconstitutional
delegation of power by Congress to
the President as to make the entire

| act invalid.
j At the same time in the District t
of Columbia Supreme Court, Public
Works Administration attorneys dc
j fended PWA loans to municipalities
for the construction of publicly
i owned power plants and planned to
| put Secretary Ickes on the witness :
j stand.
Market Spurts
The Gufley Act ruling sent the
| stock market into a frenzied advance
which carried some issues from one
to four points higher. The rally,
> however, was short-lived. The mar
; ket closed irregularly lower.
New Dealers had little to say
i about either court decision, pending
a study of the opinions to see what
I could be salvaged.
