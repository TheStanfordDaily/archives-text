HALF t HALF MAKES
SMOKE!
You'll like the way Half & Half burns. Cool a>
mother-in-law's wire: "Arrive Frhlay." Sweet as
t ,fJ the news that she's changed her plans. Fragrant,
full-hodicd tobacco that won t bite the tongue — in
a tin that won't bite the fingers. Made by our exclu
sive modern proccsj including patent No. 1,770,920.
Smells good. Makes your pipe welcome any
tllfc* where. Tastes good. Your password to pleasure!
, GSjr Not a bit of- bite in the tebneco or the Telescope Tin, which
gets smaller and smaller as you use-up the tobacco. Nc
bitten fingers as you reach lot a load, even the last one.
