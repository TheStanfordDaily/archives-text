# Reynolds Leads Row Forces Into A.S.S.U. Offices
## 1,685 Voters Elect Track Star President; Esther Pelton, Vice-Presidential Choice, Proves One of Few Victorious Hall Candidates 
### Johnson Hill 
Jim Reynolds was swept into the A.S.S.U. presidency yes
terday on a wave of support which left 14 other Row repre
sentatives in possession of a majority of offices in the annual
spring elections.
A total of 1685 ballots was polled, according to Election
Board tabulations. This figure failed to set the record pre-

dieted by campus observers during♦
the pre-election campaign activity.
Of the 24 positions—not including
Women's Athletic Association offices
—which received new occupants, 15
were secured by Row and nine by I
Ilall and Independent candidates.
Victory Margin Wide
Reynolds won the student body S
presidency by a margin of 389 votes
over Chick Franich, Hall candidate, j
The latter polled 643 ballots to de
feat Independent man Robert E. i
Bernhard, Jr., who drew 36 votes.
Heading the list of Hall victors
was Esther Pelton, elected to the
vice-presidency of the Associated 1
Students by a vote of 887 to 813,
obtained from tabulation of second

choices on the preferential ballots.
Miss Pelton in the first choices re- :
ceived 590 votes, Naomi Carpenter
597, and Helen Grover 520.
Shutout for Class Offices
All seven of the class offices were i
filled by Row nominees. Mort D'Ev- j
elyn was given a margin of 59 ballots ,
over Don Strauss in the race for the
senior class presidency. Tom Kille- j
fer and Peter Fay were elected to
head the junior and sophomore j
classes, respectively.
Official approval of the election I
results was given by Ex Committee j
in its meeting last night. "The entire
process," Chairman Jim Ludlam of j
the Election Board declared, "was
completed with more ease and speed I
than I have observed in recent elec- j
tions."
"Much credit is due members of !
the board and others who aided in j
computing the tabulations. Without ;
their assistance we would have been ;
unable to handle the situation ade- j
quately," he said.
