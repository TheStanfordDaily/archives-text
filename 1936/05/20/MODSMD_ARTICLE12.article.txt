# Pint-Size Car Gets Lost In Encina Drain
## 
### 
Those little kiddy-car-size Aus- J
tins are probably more trouble than
they're worth, an enraged owner of |
one discovered outside Encina last ;
night.
Wheij he found the bantam ma- j
chine, lost all afternoon, it was well '
settled in the five-foot-deep drain
which runs around the Encina bull
pen. But light as the car was, it was
no cinch to remove.
First the man who owned it raced
the motor till the little thing shiv
ered all over, attempted to drive up
a stairway. He was successful only
in tearing off most of the tires.
Finally 10 strongies from the hall, a
five-ton truck and a heavy iron j
chain succeeded in bringing the
Austin out of its hole.
Its master inside, the pea-sized |
car limped away.
