# Long Live Democracy!

(Editorial)
A practice that has more completely undermined democracy
at Stanford than any other feature of the Farm's extra-curricular
activity exists no more.
In a surprise move, Ex Committee last night abolished, whole
heartedly and with only one dissenting vote, the annual Masque
Ball King and Queen Contest.
Student Manager Bob Gros proposed the contest's abolition,
with a heartfelt plea that was echoed by nearly every member
of the Committee.
So the most productive, yet most vicious, feature of Stanford's
annual Convalescent Home Drive is a thing of the pastâ€”at least
on its present monetary basis.
If unchecked, the contest undoubtedly would have reached a
new high next year, and the year after. The sisterhood's several
sororities were already estimating a cost of $1500 and upward to
plant a crown on the head of one of the dearly beloved in the
1937 drive.
This is placing altogether too much emphasis on the almighty
dollar, and this over-emphasis has developed internal animosities,
petty spites, and dollar-and-cents dictatorship by Stanford's mon
led minority.
The University still boasts a tradition of equality among its
students; this tradition is snowed under by a rain of $100 bills
plunked on one heir-apparent to Rockefeller-like fortunes.
The Convalescent Home needs Stanford contributions; but
Stanford needs her reputation, traditions, and ideals even more.
The King-Queen Contest is dead; long live democracy.
