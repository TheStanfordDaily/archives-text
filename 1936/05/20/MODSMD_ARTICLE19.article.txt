# Union Janitor Breaks Record-- Not Head
## 
### 
For seven years E. M. House,
janitor at the Union since its open
ing in 1929, has never been late
for work. Last night, despite his
efforts to prevent it, the striking
record was broken.
On the way to his clean-up job,
House was hit by a car, thrown
to the pavement just outsida the
Union. Scalp cut and bleeding,
and one leg badly bruised, he
hobbled onto the job.
When doctors arrived, found
that the scalp wound needed
stitches, the Union's trusty re
fused to be taken to the hospital.
Finally House gave in, on condi
tion—"that I'll get back to the job
tonight."
On the side, doctors let it be
known that the injuries, though
not serious, would keep him off
work for "at least a few days."
