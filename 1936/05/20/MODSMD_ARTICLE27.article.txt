Bob Gros, originator of the
motion to do away with the
■ Masque Ball contest, made the
following comment on Ex
Committee's vote:
"What we needed, what we
hoped for, what we got! I
wanted that motion to go
through more than I have ever
wanted anything at Stanford.
The contest was fostering a
spirit of pettiness wholly in -
consistent with the democratic
ideals which have character
ized Stanford's founding and
history.
"To attach the almighty dol
lar to attainment »f any kind
here was simply killing some
thing which means a to
those of us who love this Uni
versity. I feel confident that
some new plan can be devised
for raising money for this
worthy charity; but the good
done for the Home was not
commensurate with the harm
done to Stanford democracy
under the system which Ex
Committee had the courage to
condemn tonight."
