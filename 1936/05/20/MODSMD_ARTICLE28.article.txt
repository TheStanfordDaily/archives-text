What a wallop that Supreme Court
packs! And the New Deal is al
ways wide open, too. The stock
market is the fight fan. It's always
< li< < ring for a kayo. And jumps way
up in its seat if the administration
is cooled.
The Guffey coal act provided
f< r the regulation of hours and
wages in the mining industry as
v\ ell as in manufacturing. The
court says the act is an unconsti
tutional invasion of states' rights.
States' rights are a joke. A very
.sour one by this time. The NRA
wa called illegal on that same
count. These two measures (Guffey
and the NKA) always seemed to
11 ■ to be the most beneficial of New
Deal enactments. But they are re
pudiated. The Supreme Court
hould label all the present rampant
) xpenditures unconstitutional and
let these other efforts to further
social justice stand.

LIGHTING MINERS
The head of the United Mine
Woskers in a statement following
the high court's decision on Monday
aid, "We are going to keep all of the
contracts made under the Guffey
law and if there is any wage cutting
ve are going to put on our armor
ind fight!"
Justice Cardozo, the glorious lib
ral, called the mine operators cow
ids and said they were "crying be
fore they were hurt."

C ARPET WEAVING
'I he Guffey Act was the first of a
•l ies of legislative measures which
ere to weave in and out and around
ie illegalities of the NRA as point
• 1 out by the Supreme Court in its
RA decision.
This weaving and dodging and
/oiding was to be accomplished by
rrnulating codes for one industry
a time instead of a sweeping pro
sion including all industries—but
is setting up of little NRA's is as
.cgal in the court's eyes as the
•esc nee of a big NRA because the
nail ones contain the same pro
sions as the large ones—and the
aving of the carpet of social jus
cc is again stymied.

lIEERFUL TICKERS
Only a fool would deny the im
• ovement of business, but the way
i i really find out for yourself the
ounting profits and all-around
1 faithfulness of business today is to
alk into the Wall Street Journal
<• i Bush Street and read the reports
they come in off the tickers from
ew York. Every item speaks of
creased car loadings, of larger
ink debits, of increased orders, of
sing prosperity, etc., etc.
Every little half-baked concern in
e United Slates appears to be set
ig new records for orders filled,
r unfilled orders (which is better
t meaning that the companies
ive so many demands that they
en't able to fill them and for gains
■ r previous years.)
