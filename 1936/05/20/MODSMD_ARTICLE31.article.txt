# Aeronautics Main Work Of Graduation Speaker
## Durand Seen as Leader Among Air Experts 
### 
An imposing array of titles and j
degrees is attached to the name of j
Dr. William F. Durand, professor
emeritus of mechanical engineering, !
who was recently picked to deliver |
the commencement address on June '
14.
Recognized as one of the most en
gaging speakers at Stanford besides
his academic accomplishments, Dr.
Durand has chosen in this, his
twelfth emeritus year, to apply the
final veneer to departing seniors.
Has liroad Interests
A brief conversation with him j
quickly dispells initial misgivings I
toward a man who can at one time J
possess a Ph.D., an LL.D., and be an
authority on aeronautics.
In 1929, the Guggenheim Founda- I
tion asked Dr. Durand to be gen- !
eral editor of a series of 20 mono- !
graphs on "Aero-Dynamic Theory" J
to be written by "recognized ex- j
perts the world over." He wrote j
three of the treatises himself, fin
ished the six-volume work last j
March. "This constitutes," he says, j
"my most considerable contribution ;
to the field of aeronautical science."
Heads Important Committee
Last year, Dr. Durand was ap- i
pointed by the Secretary of the |
Navy lis chairman of a committee to j
study the problems of lighter-than- j
air craft. In 1925, he was named to '
the Morrow Aircraft Board by |
President Coolidge.
In addition, membership in more
than a half-dozen world-known
scientific societies has been ex- i
tended this Stanford scholar.
