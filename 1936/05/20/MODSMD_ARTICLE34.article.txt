# Reynolds' First Act--—He Saves Voters 10 Bucks
## Swampum Wins Election Bets; No. 1 Politician, Ludlam, Can't Pick 'Em 
### Solon O. Swampum 
Reynolds almost saved the stu
; dent body ten dollars by winning
I yesterday.
It Franieh had been A.S.S.U. pres
| ident, a special vote could have been
| called to fill his vacated Junior Man
j position on Ex Committee. Dick
j Creamer, if he does not choose to
j return in 193G as rumored, will leave
the graduate man post vacant. Ques
! tion: Will the appointment by-law ■
j be revived?
Funny bets: Jim Ludlam's that
j Calderwood would beat Killefer—
j the number 1 politician lost 50 cents,
i And he bet Betty Grover two drinks
that she'd win. Can't pick 'em,
J Ludlug!
Dick Creamer is willing to give
| anyone 100 to 1 that Ray Lyman
| Wilbur will be the Republican pres
| idential candidate this year. So far,
I he has two takers.
The Farm takes Leap Year se
! riously. Swampum picks Betty 1
: Stearns as Naomi Carpenter's suc-
I cessor for the Concert Series man- J
j agership. Betty would be the sec- ;
j ond woman in Stanford history to
j win the position.
Frank Price, who lost in '34 for
; soph man on Ex Committee, and
Don Strauss, senior president can
! didate, have formed a "Lost to
! D'Evelyn" club. Election of officers
! will be held early next week. Lead
' ing in the race are Price and Strauss, |
j according to information issued late
I last night.
Daily business staff elections come
Thursday. Candidates for manager j
are Bill Moore, Jerry Brown, Bill
Ward, and Dorothy Vernier. An-
J other case of Jones knows but j
i Jones won't tell.
