# A 						CONSTRUCTIVE STATEMENT OF A.S.U. POLICIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Were it not for the fact that I
attended the A.S.U. Conference last
Friday I would never have recog
nized the meeting from reports of it
circulated in the Daily.
Despite the popular belief that the
A.S.U. is an out-and-out communist
organization, such a conception was
plainly proved erroneous to all who
took the trouble to attend the con
ference meeting.
At the time of the meeting I
thought all the speeches were too
long and repetitious because the pro
gram and policy of the Student Un
ion was repeated unnecessarily.
But even such repetition, verging on
to boredom, has evidently done little
to dispel the present muddled belief
as to the character of the A.S.U.
Therefore, at the risk of becoming
repetitious myself, I would like to
list what in my mind appear to be
the three fundamental principles of
the A.S.U.
.1. Student opposition to war. Now
really, is there anything commun
istic in that?
2. Student opposition to fascism.
I will admit that in this respect we
share the communists's antipathy
toward fascists, but does that make
us communists?
3. Promotion of opportunities for
ail students who desire to get a col
lege education.
If what I say is true, you will ad
mit that the A.S.U. is not so bad
after all. How about coming to the
next meeting of the A.S.U. to be
held Thursday evening at 7:30 in
the Women's Clubhouse and find out
for yourself the truth of the above
statements?
