### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 19 (#»).— 1
An ultimatum that non-union can
nery workers must be removed from '
Alaska fishing boats tied up here by '
labor disputes was delivered to I
packing companies today by officials
of the Maritime' Federation of the
Pacific.
As officers of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union and employers' rep
resentatives negotiated to settle the
controversy, the American-Hawai
ian freighter lowan was tied up.
Longshoremen refused to go
through the picket lines to handle
the ships' cargoes, but the crews did (
the work.
There are 210 non-union men on
the Glacier and 195 on the American
Star, but the Cannery Workers offi- :
cials said the union's membership I
already is 2,500, or 700 more than I
can be employed during the Alaska
salmon fishing season.
The crew members contended
they should work cargo only in
emergency and the employers asked
the International Seamen's Union to
send another crew to the boat.
