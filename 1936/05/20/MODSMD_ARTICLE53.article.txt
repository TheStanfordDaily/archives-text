# Alumni, Varsity Water Poloists Meet Tomorrow
## Old Stars To Appear In Olympic Games Show; Comedy Skit Featured 
### 
Although somewhat robbed of its !
i thunder by the Rider-Needham re- (
i match in the 1500-meter swim, the
i alumni-varsity water polo debacle |
j still promises real excitement to |
j Olympic Games benefitors who j
j gather at Encina pools tomorrow
I evening at 8 o'clock.
! Never before have the alumni
stood a better chance of defeating
the varsity. For the first time the j
old grads are strengthened by the |
| seniors; their opposition tomorrow
j will be an untried combination
: which will bid for Olympic Games
I berths next week and support the
! Farm in varsity competition next â– 
j fall.
Big Names Compete
I Austin Clapp, member of the '32
j Olympic water-polo team, and Jun- j
I ior National Championship team of j
'31, Whitie Burns and Paul do Silva, '
captain and member of Stanford's I
Junior National Championship
j team of '31, and Bill Woodward, co- j
I captain of last year's varsity and ,
j all-Coast guard, are some of the big j
j names that will be splashing for the j
I old-timers.
Captain Bob Haslacher, all-Coast
j goalie last year, will lead the var
i sity outfit. The old defense com- j
; bination of Peterson, Voss, and Gif- !
; fin is tried and true. But the un- j
knowns Coach Thornton is counting i
j on are the forwards, Hanna and j
! Hoover, and Vibert at sprint.
[ Game a Toss-up
i Thornton gives the unbiased opin- J
J ion that "it is a toss-up." But if
j you listen to the vows of the alumni
"it's going to be a wash-away."
Added attraction, according to j
j Thornton, is Professor Willie Sink- i
j erswim, who will flaunt an exhibi
j tion of diving and swimming. Gen- :
, eral admission is 25 cents, students !
1 10 cents.
