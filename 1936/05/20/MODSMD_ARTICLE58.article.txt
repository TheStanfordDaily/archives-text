REPRINT OF SWELL
CIIAPPIE YARN
This morning we reprint a yarn
that appeared originally in the 1935
"Track" issue of Chappie. It is in I
honor of Tom Slattery, ex-Chappie
man and pal of many Stanford ath
letes and shot-heavers of the last
several years. Slats, incidentally, is
the fellow who induced Bob Fowler
to take up running for exercise in
high school.
Tom is back on the campus mak
ing up a lew units so he can grad
uate. This is his favorite story, and
when he first read it last spring the
poor guy almost died of side-shak
ing. It's a honey of a yarn, in both
of our opinions. Gordy Stecdman,
last year s Chappie ed, wrote it.
TIIE PLEA FOR
TEMPERANCE
It was the day of the big meet
and victory for dear old State Col
lege depended on the outcome of the '
shot-put. A young lad, Joseph, the
sophomore star of State, had one re
maining try. All afternoon he had
been surpassing his previous rec- I
ords, but lie could not best the
throws of his opponent. One more
chance remained — Joseph had to
win the shot-put if State was to win
the meet.
A group of his teammates took Jo
seph aside: "It is up to you," they
said. "You must break the world's
record."
"But I am so tired," said Joseph.
One of the teammates produced a
bottle.
"Here," he said, "take a little of
this and it will fix you up."
"But," sighed young Joseph, "I
never drink. It makes me sick."
"This is good stuff—just one shot
of it and you can break the world's
record!"
"All light," said Joseph, "any
thing for dear old State." And
amidst the cheering of his mates,
Joseph took a long drink.
"Jhush one lil' shot—fix me right
up," murmured Joseph as he stum
bled into the pit. "Jhush one lil'
shot!" he repeated as he picked up ;
one of the heavy balls, feeling a •
queer sensation inside himself. 1
"Jush one lil' shot," he thought as
he suddenly heaved the shot for. a
new world's record.
But in spite of Joseph's great
heave, State lost the meet.

—
RASEBALL is now over, with the i
Waseda series completed and one
won and one lost. It might be meet
here to print the final standings in
the 1936 Conference race, the re
sults showing one sport where the
Cards didn't win the conference
title. The answer is simply that j
baseball at Stanford gets no consid
eration from alumni or scholarship
committees to proselytize promising
horsehiders.
