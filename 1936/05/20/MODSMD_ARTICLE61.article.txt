# 'Coming Back?' Athletes Answer
## Callaway May Play Again; Myers, Brandin Out 
### 
The holdover status of three star
athletes was a little clearer last
night as the trio gave these answers
to the question, 4 'Will you return to
school next year and compete in
football or track?"
Cab Callaway — Will come back
"next year, may or may not play
football.
Alf Brandin—Will not be back for
football next year.
GifT Myers—Probably will not be
back for track next year.
Brandin said that he would grad
uate next month and go to work
soon thereafter. He has a job in
Detroit.
Callaway Valuable
Callaway's case is perhaps of the
most interest of the three. With the
holes left at tackle by the absence
of Bob Reynolds and Dale Beedle,
1935 first-springers, the search for a
pair of strong tackles is somewhat
of a pressing problem in the
Thornhill strategy shop.
In spring practice Pete Zagar
looked healthy enough for one post,
but the left tackle job is still wide
open, and with Callaway's return all
would be rosy, for the Zagar-Calla
way combination would leave little
to be desired.
Cab Asthmatic
It all depends on Cab's physical
condition when he returns to the
Farm in the fall. He plans to work
into condition during the summer,
and consult his doctors in Missouri
in September about his fitness to
join the gridiron wars. His main
trouble is asthma.
