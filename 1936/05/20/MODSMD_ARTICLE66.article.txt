# Yanks Victors Over Indians
## Game Enlivened by Clash Between Players 
### 
CLEVELAND, May 19 (/P).—The
New York Yankees finished with a
; bang today to win their fifth straight
j victory over the Cleveland Indians,
i 10 to 4.
Scoring seven runs in the last
. three innings, they made a one
, sided contest out of what had been
a tight pitching duel between Monte
Pearson and George Blaeholder for
the first six heats.
The game was enlivened by a near
clash between Tony Lazzeri and
j Bill Knickerbocker in the ninth;
j when Lazzeri rushed from the
Yankee dugout to accuse Knicker
bocker of being unnecessarily rough
with Joe DiMaggio when he slid
'nto second base. Both teams poured
from the benches, but trouble was
* averted by the umpires.
DiMaggio collected two singles in
five trips to the plate and batted in
one of the Yankee runs. •
