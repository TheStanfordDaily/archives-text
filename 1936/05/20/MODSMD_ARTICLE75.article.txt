## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Twenty-One Successful Row Candidates Can't Give Credit To Partisan Support 
### 
The fact that 21 of the 31 student officers who
were elected yesterday belong to fraternity or
sorority houses does not necessarily indicate, as
headlines proclaim, that the Row scored a
sweeping victory.
Figures prove otherwise.
True, candidates hailing from the Row filled
two-thirds of the offices, but they cannot attrib
ute their success to an overwhelming Row vote.
A first check shows that approximately 500 Hall
students and 525 Row students cast ballots.
These figures so nearly balance each other
that the deciding element does not fall within
the pale of either of the two so-called factions.
Freshmen and non-organization voters decided
the direction of the tide.
Almost 400 votes came out of Encina and
Roble, while those students living in private
residences polled over 250 ballots. The total
of these two, greater than that of either the Hall
or the Row proper, proved the deciding factor
in yesterday's election.

The success of the 21 elected Row candi
dates might be attributed to coincidence, to
the whims of the uninstructed independents, or
to the fact that they might have been best qual
ified, but certainly little if any credit can be
given to the solid blocks which party workers
have been working so industriously to form in
the last few weeks.
Another almost paradoxical fact is revealed
in the classification of votes. Whereas far less
than half the men registered in the University
had enough interest in the election to vote, al
most three-quarters of the registered women
took active part in the voting. This unequal pro
portion gives the women's contingent someth'ng
to be proud of.
Each year the distribution of elective offices
according to Hall and Row is different. But if
Row leaders are following the procedure of past
victorious groups and patting themselves on the
back for a highly successful campaign, they're
misappropriating the credit. Campaigns didn't
decide this election.
