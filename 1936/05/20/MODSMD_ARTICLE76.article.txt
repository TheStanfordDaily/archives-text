# College Pranks Can Be Carried Too Far
## 
### 
College pranks are funny, and they make
people laugh. Reading in the American Boy,
Child's Life, Boy's Life, and the Open Road for
Boys has convinced many a juvenile lead before
he comes to Stanford that he, too, can be funny.
It takes several months for the average student
to get over this idea.
Some students, however, never get the cure.
These pretties are bound to go through life be
ing "college men." From sloughing water in
Encina, these boys step up to such feats as set
ting fire to haystacks; always remember, of
course, how funny they are.
Setting fire to the hay as a manifestation of j
the student's sense of humor, though, is liable
to have its limitations, particularly if it lays the
whole farm open to a fire hazard.
Perhaps Comptroller Roth has the idea, when
he declares he will recommend that all the hay
burners his cops catch be given a chance to
exercise their sense of humor on the high-school
kids at home, because Stanford, frankly, is a
little bored.
