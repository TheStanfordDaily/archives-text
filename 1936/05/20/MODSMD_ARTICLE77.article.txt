# It's Up to Students to Make B.A.C. System Workable
## 
### 
In the hallowed halls of the B.A.C. building
there has been going on a struggle for the past
few weeks that may transcend the momentary
importance of yesterday's A.S.S.U. election.
The struggle concerns one-year contracts for
football coaches, and it eventually involves a
struggle between alumni and faculty for the con
trol of the B.A.C.
The students part in the battle comes in,
when they elect the student members of the
B.A.C. The B.A.C. is set up to include a repre
sentation of three equal parts: students, faculty,
and alumni, with the court of ultimate resort
being the President and the Board of Trustees.
This theoretical division works fine, except
when the students find that they elect represent-

atives here on alumni scholarships, and under
the thumb of the alumni.
At present the struggle for one-year contracts
of several major sport coaches is purely an
alumni battle. And it is significant that in the
nominating assembly last week, Jim Reynolds,
who yesterday was elected president of the
A.S.S.U., showed by his platform that as a mem
ber of the B.A.C. he will resist alumni domi
nance.
Reynolds clearly came out against one-year
contracts for major sports coaches. Woody
Adams, elected B.A.C. representative yesterday,
has not taken a definite stand.
It is hoped that with the election of their rep
resentatives yesterday, the students continue
the balance of power. However, if a disruption
of the balance becomes chronic, then it is plain
that something will have to be done to revise
the set-up in the B.A.C.
