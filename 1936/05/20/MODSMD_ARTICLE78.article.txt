BOO!
Bcrnarr "The People's Cherce" Macfadden is on
tlie loose again!
This time with a demand, on the editorial pages
<jf his popular nickel weekly, that we maintain an
aimy of Half a million in California to combat the
hordes of Japanese soldiers already in that state, in
Mexico, and in Peru.
Yes, they're there, hiding under the cactus plants
of the Navajo desert, heavily armed with pea shooters
and gliders, ready to march on 50 seconds' notice
when given the wig-wag from headquarters in Tokyo.
tor purposes of illustration, the editorial carries a
picture of a Japanese chappie with a nasty gleam
in his eye, a Los Angeles chamber of commerce cir
cular in his vest pocket, and a bayonet in his hands,
pointed at the breast of sad Uncle Sam.
Among the supplementary demands of the alarmed
publisher, who, incidentally, is going to be very sur
prised when he wakes up some morning in November
and finds that he is not president, are these:
"I demand that we maintain a sufficient number of
warships in the Pacific Ocean to destroy any Japanese
fleet that may attack us." (Six barges and two or
three garbage scows should do the trick.)
"I demand that we increase our air fleet to such
an extent that an invading army can be attacked by
airplanes in such large numbers that they will seem
like a swarm of buzzing bees to our enemies." (Happy
thought: well, why not use bees?)
Wc should increase the size of our army on a
par with the various European nations." (Note to
kindergarten pupils: Europe has been so success
ful in preventing war, we really should follow its
example.)
I ho blam-jam fools who have been curtailing the
activities of our munition plants ought to hang their
heads in shame! and furthermore, they should be
placed in the front line of the army which may be
needed to repel invaders!" (Ah there, Charley Pad
dock!)
And the painful fact is, that thousands of the great
unwashed in this country will actually believe Ber
n a it's burps!

"I demand that we maintain a sufficient number of
warships in the Pacific Ocean to destroy any Japanese
fleet that may attack us." (Six barges and two or
three garbage scows should do the trick.)
"I demand that we increase our air fleet to such
an extent that an invading army can be attacked by
airplanes in such large numbers that they will seem
like a swarm of buzzing bees to our enemies." (Happy
thought: well, why not use bees?)
Wc should increase the size of our army on a
par with the various European nations." (Note to
kindergarten pupils: Europe has been so success
ful in preventing war, we really should follow its
example.)
I ho blam-jam fools who have been curtailing the
activities of our munition plants ought to hang their
heads in shame! and furthermore, they should be
placed in the front line of the army which may be
needed to repel invaders!" (Ah there, Charley Pad
dock!)
And the painful fact is, that thousands of the great
unwashed in this country will actually believe Ber
n a it's burps!
