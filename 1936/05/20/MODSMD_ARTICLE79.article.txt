Maybe the Kappa showers are inadequate. I don't
know, but apparently they seem inadequate to the
Kappas, who ought to know. Reports have been drift
ing in that the Kappas are being seen bathing at all
hours of the day and night and in many different
places.
A lonely cowboy meandering over the hills back
of Felt Lake flushed a covey of Kappas swimming in
the frigid waters. The frigid Kappas, who were quite
uncoveyed, waited in the waters and cast frigid glances
at the horseman. The cowboy waited for something to
happen. The Kappas waited for something to happen.
Nothing happened.
Then there is another story about the wimmen's
swimmen pool. Saturday night some of the boys saw
another covey of Kappas, with just a dash of Pi Beta
Phi, purling in the brook. Some of the boys thought
this was rather funny, so they took the assembled
clothes, towels, and blankets and ditched them. The
Kappas or the Pi Phis did not think this was very
funny. But nothing happened.
It takes quite a bit to upset the perfect tran
quility of the registrar's oflice. Down in that little
haven of vital statistics, where hours, units, creden
tials, organs, dimensions, are carefully tabulated so
that anybody can see that you were at the Mark be
fore the mid-term, and that the professor had got
your mark at the final, nothing is important save the
golden mean, the divine average, humanity in the
mass (or mess, maybe). But something did disturb
the registrar's oflice, and it was just a few days ago, too.
The registrar's office got a request from a college
in the Middle West for several catalogs. It was ad
dressed to "Stanford University, (near Berkeley),
Calif."
