# Hall Support Sweeps Row Into Power
## Greek Vote Small Compared to Landslide Win In Campus Elections 
### Dave Botsford 
When the game was over at 2
o'clock yesterday and the results an
nounced a few hours later, the score
as to major offices stood: Row, 15;
Hall, 9. But a check of voting sta
tistics shows Row forces proselyt
ed more than a few Hall and Inde
pendent players.
Despite huge landslides for many
of its candidates, the Row cast but
32 per cent of the 1,658 total votes.
The Hall cast 30 per cent, Encina
and Roble 23 per cent, Independents
15 per cent.
Discrepancy in Totals
In some cases the votes tabulated
by the election board totalled
more than the 1,685 found by check
ing bawlout sheets marked at the
polls. Election Chairman Jim Lud
lam admits that perhaps the officials
forgot to check off a few persons as
they voted.
Five Row candidates—Reynolds,
Mallett, Goodan, Holloway, and
Thompson — were swept into office
with well over 1000 ballots apiece,
twice as many as the entire Row
vote. Only one Hall candidate, Ad
ams, received such a huge majority.
Facts Noted
Now look at the Daiiy-compiled
statistics:
Of 848 Row members, 527 voted.
Of 732 Hall residents, 499 voted. The
Row got out 62 per cent, the Hall
68 per cent.
Two hundred sixty-three Inde
pendent voters probably helped
sway the majority of offices toward
the Row.
Of the 717 residents of freshman
halls (377 are Row pledges) 55 per
cent voted—7o per cent of Roble, 48
per cent of Encina.
Women's Vote Heavy
In every case the women's vote
was as heavy or heavier than the
men's. Especially along the Row—
82 per cent of the women stuck
ballots into Law Corner boxes while
only 54 per cent of their brothers
did. Rough and co-ed Hall and In
dependent voting was about equal.
Approximately 65 per cent of the
feminine student body cast ballots
compared to 45 per cent of the mas
culine students.
So about the only thing you can
deduce from the facts, boys, is that
the better-organized Row voted
Row, while the Hall voted about
as it pleased. Figure the Independ
ents out for yourself. They didn't
vote for Bernhard.
