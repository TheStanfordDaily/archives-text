# A 						NOON-TIME WASH JOB
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is there no other time but mid- ]
day when our gardeners can water
the grass, etc.?
Several times of late it has been j
the unpleasant experience of myself j
and others to return to our cars j
1 from classes and find that there is a !
large stream of water spraying them i
quite thoroughly. This is indeed a
j disappointment after being lucky
; enough to find one of the few avail
i able parking spots near the Quad,
i The sprinklers have a radius of 1
j about 15 feet, but it seems to be I
most convenient to place them about
I five feet from someone's car. It
makes no difference whether the!
windows are up or down. If they
i are down, it'is just too bad and the
! water sprays over the interior,
i I personally believe that it is a
I matter of carelessness and if
\ brought to the attention of the !
I proper person it would not be nec- j
cssary to approach one's car at
| tired in a raincoat.
Here's hoping for djrier automo- i
! biles.
