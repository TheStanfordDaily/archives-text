# BICYCLISTS BEWARE

I The Editor, Sir:
May I warn those who now ride i
I bicycles around the campus leaving j
them parked here and there that
' there are those who have evidently j
j not heard of our honored and hoary '
tradition, i.e., the Stanford Honor !
i Code.
This brutal fact is only too clear
to those who have suffered losses
! commensurate to mine in the last
two weeks. May God bless and di- i
rect the good person who now en
| joys the use of my black and red !
tired Dayton bicycle, or who curses '
the hard seat and the lack of fen- i
ders and handle grips, to return it
i to its former resting place by the \
southeast steps of Toyon.
