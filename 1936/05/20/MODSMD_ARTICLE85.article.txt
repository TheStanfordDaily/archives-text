# Movie Team 'Goes To Town' In 'Mr. Deeds'
## 
### 
If little Swampum had a hundred J
critical coins to toss, they'd all turn j
up heads for "Mr. Deeds Goes to
Town," laugh picture at Blarico's
Theater in Mountain View.
Director Frank Capra and Screen
writer Robert Riskin a couple of

years ago turned a
little magazine story
about two people
finding love on a bus
into that astounding
success called "It
Happened One

Night." This time they've repeated
their triumph with a Clarence Bud
dington Kelland yarn about Long
fellow Deeds and his front-page
antics in the big city.
Like many Kelland stories—"Cat's
Paw," "Strike Me Pink," and
*'Speakeasily" — "Mr. Deeds" con
cerns a young bachelor (Gary Coop
er; content in a fairly "primitive"
community who, plunked into the
wiles of a big city, violates one after
another of the metropolitan conven
tions.
