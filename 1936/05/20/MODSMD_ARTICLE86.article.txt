# Bull Session
## "SEND IS A BILL" 
### 
Campus old-timers who remem- i
ber "going to the city" as a horse
and-buggy pack trip sigh sadly at
the Croesus-like spenders and Lu
cullian livers who call themselves
Stanfordites in 1936.
They remember when a Farm
dance was a dance, and not a ven- j
ture into high

finance—when an
evening's enter
tainment under
the University's
maternal wing
was free, if not
easy.
They remember
when Stanford
men and women i
arranged the i r
own good times,
decorated for
their own dances,

played in their own orchestras—and ,
learned about the arrangement of a
good time while they enjoyed it.
* * *
To contrast them days with these
days would be a greater waste of j
space than usual. Because working
for our own good times is today
seldom even considered. It's so j
much easier for dance committees
to authorize A.S.S.U. authorizations
than to climb step-ladders and mix '
their own punch. -
And of course it's not only easier,
but more profitable to rest com
fortably and collect complimentary
bids than to work for them. Dollars,
you see, not only make the pro
verbial mare go, but have wonder
ful influence on dance bands, cater- I
ers, interior decorators, and cos- j
turners.
* * *
That students are losing money !
under the present student philoso- |
phy of "charge it," goes without
saying. But the money isn't half ;
of it.
The University, and the Dean's i
office that says $300 a quarter is j
plenty enough, is made to look just
a little bit foolish. For it's no secret
that the $300 a quarter man can't j

"Mr. Deeds' " humor comes from ■
a skilled combination of plot, action,
and dialogue. Perhaps most credit j
should go to Dii'ector Capra for
bringing out the comedy which has
lain dormant so long in Gary I
Cooper. Anyway, if you don't en- j
joy "Mr. Deeds" tremendously, ,
you're "pixilated." —Botsford '

pay all his class, club and house
dues, buy bids for the best dances,
and still eat.

And if the University is looking
foolish, papa's poeketbook is either
going to continue looking empty, or
little Willie will just have to re
member he hasn't as much money
as roommate Johnny—although the
University is Democratic.
* * *
But the worst of all is thnt Stan
ford men and women, charging their
way through college, are missing the
good time making their own good
times.
Oldsters shake their heads hope
lessly, remembering their own great
days of good-time making, and won
der, not without reason, what kind
of helpless, spoiled, insufferable
brats we are, who think dollars will
buy everything, and spend them to
keep our hands clean, when hands
were made to be dirtied.

Somebody stole a box of J. J. Nick
el's back yard, but Nickel just
laughed and laughed. The box was
a hive. It contained a swarm of
bees not friendly toward strangers.

Somebody stole a box of J. J. Nick
el's back yard, but Nickel just
laughed and laughed. The box was
a hive. It contained a swarm of
bees not friendly toward strangers.

Campus old-timers who remem- i
ber "going to the city" as a horse
and-buggy pack trip sigh sadly at
the Croesus-like spenders and Lu
cullian livers who call themselves
Stanfordites in 1936.
They remember when a Farm
dance was a dance, and not a ven- j
ture into high

finance—when an
evening's enter
tainment under
the University's
maternal wing
was free, if not
easy.
They remember
when Stanford
men and women i
arranged the i r
own good times,
decorated for
their own dances,

played in their own orchestras—and ,
learned about the arrangement of a
good time while they enjoyed it.

To contrast them days with these
days would be a greater waste of j
space than usual. Because working
