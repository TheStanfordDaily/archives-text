# Wilbur Lauds Abolition Of Royal Contest
## Action Against King-Queen Competition Is Praised by Notables 
### 
Campus quotables bore out Ex
Committee's censure of the annual
King-Queen contest pretty well
yesterday; with few' exceptions
everyone agreed that the election
was little more than a wolf wrapped
in the garbs of charity.
President Wilbur, crusader of
long-standing against the money
making scheme, said with epitaph
brevity: "I'm glad the king is dead,
and Fin glad the queen went with
him!"
Bob Hoover, head of interfrater
nity council, stands by the com
mittee's action whole-heartedly. "I
think getting rid of the contest is a
good idea," he says. "It was a great
money-maker, but it certainly cre
ated a lot of petty jealousies."
Pan-Hell Head Disagrees
Newly elected Pan-Hell head
Nancy Gray, on the other hand, dis
agrees with abolition of the drive's
biggest lucre-getter: "While in some
ways the spirit of the contest is un
democratic, the contest itself does
get money—and, after all, that's
what it is supposed to do. No-o-o,
I don't think it should have been
abolished."
Dean Culver is another who ex
presses his opinion in the few
words, "I think the students d'd a
pretty good job!"
Ex Committee's one dissenting
vote Tuesday came from Roy An
derson, senior man. Anderson had a
pretty good reason for standing by
the King-Queen contest —he was
treasurer of this year's record
netting drive. Here's what he says:
"I hoped some change might be
made to eliminate the undesirable
features of the contest and yet still
retain it as a source of income to
the drive. It doesn't seem this can
be done, and I believe the right
thing was done."
Jim Ludlam, election chairman
and head of King-Queen vote,
says: "I personally feel the King-
Queen contest is a good ihiug. I
admit some of the methods used
arc not the best in the world, but
at the same time I feel the cause
is worthy enough to offset the ob
jections."
If anyone had a right to stay be
hind the contest it was Gib Hollo
way, chairman of this year's Con
valescent Home Drive. Here's how
he feels: "As a money-making idea
it was the cleverest I've ever seen.
"In a way I hate to see it go, but
on the other hand I am fully aware
|of its reprehensible features. It
certainly left a bad taste in the
i mouths of those who love Stanford
democi'acy."
Several plans for taking the place
of the contest and netting at least
some of the receipts for the drive
came to the front yesterday. Most
notable was a similar popularity con
! test in which each student would be
| allowed one vote at a certain pi'ice.
I Candidates would be charged en
i trance fees. However, action on that
J and similar plans will be up to next
I year's drive committee.
