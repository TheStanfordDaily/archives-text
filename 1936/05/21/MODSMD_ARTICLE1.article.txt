# Wilbur Lauds Abolition Of Royal Contest
## Action Against King-Queen Competition Is Praised by Notables 
### 
Campus quotables bore out Ex
Committee's censure of the annual
King-Queen contest pretty well
yesterday; with few' exceptions
everyone agreed that the election
was little more than a wolf wrapped
in the garbs of charity.
President Wilbur, crusader of
long-standing against the money
making scheme, said with epitaph
brevity: "I'm glad the king is dead,
and Fin glad the queen went with
him!"
Bob Hoover, head of interfrater
nity council, stands by the com
mittee's action whole-heartedly. "I
think getting rid of the contest is a
good idea," he says. "It was a great
money-maker, but it certainly cre
ated a lot of petty jealousies."
Pan-Hell Head Disagrees
Newly elected Pan-Hell head
Nancy Gray, on the other hand, dis
agrees with abolition of the drive's
biggest lucre-getter: "While in some
ways the spirit of the contest is un
democratic, the contest itself does
get money—and, after all, that's
what it is supposed to do. No-o-o,
I don't think it should have been
abolished."
Dean Culver is another who ex
presses his opinion in the few
words, "I think the students d'd a
pretty good job!"
Ex Committee's one dissenting
vote Tuesday came from Roy An
derson, senior man. Anderson had a
pretty good reason for standing by
the King-Queen contest —he was
treasurer of this year's record
netting drive. Here's what he says:
"I hoped some change might be
made to eliminate the undesirable
features of the contest and yet still
retain it as a source of income to
the drive. It doesn't seem this can
be done, and I believe the right
thing was done."
Jim Ludlam, election chairman
and head of King-Queen vote,
says: "I personally feel the King-
Queen contest is a good ihiug. I
admit some of the methods used
arc not the best in the world, but
at the same time I feel the cause
is worthy enough to offset the ob
jections."
If anyone had a right to stay be
hind the contest it was Gib Hollo
way, chairman of this year's Con
valescent Home Drive. Here's how
he feels: "As a money-making idea
it was the cleverest I've ever seen.
