Biology Professor R. W. Doane, 1
who will graduate to the privileged I
emeritus list next June, might well j
claim to be a great benefactor of j
Stanford's moonlight strollers.
This, because he has practically ,
removed their worst competition — '
the mosquitoes—in his capacity as |

j plants on vegetation in their vicinity. J

During his 31 years at Stanforc
Professor Doane has written a num
ber of books on entomology, ha:
