# Gist, Simonson Win Places As Chappie Heads
## Sale Profits To Be Divided Between Editorial Budget, Improvement Fund 
### 
Gilman Gist and Rae Simonson
yesterday were elected editor and
business manager of Chaparral for
Volume 38 at a luncheon session of
Hammer and Coffin Society in the
Alpha Sigma Phi house.
At the same time, Chaparral's
system of profit-distribution and
salaries was materially altered,
pending approval by Hammer and
Coffin trustees.
Profit Divided
Gist, who nosed out Curtis Pren
dergast and Jack Scott, has embel
lished the comic with art and liter
ary work ever since 1931, was rec
ommended by Editor Jim Copp.
Simonson, who won over Herbert
Charters and Foster Markolf, in
seven weeks has sold over $400
worth of advertising, an unprece
dented figure, pointed out Dick
Creamer, retiring manager, who
recommended Simonson for the po
sition.
The 40 per cent of the porfits
which has previously gone into the
Chaparral Improvement Fund will,
according to the proposal passed by
Hammer and Coflin, be divided into
two parts. Thirty-five per cent goes
into a special editorial budget to de
fray expenses of the following vol
ume at the discretion of the editor.
Five per cent will revert to the
fund.
Salary Increased
This solution to the profits prob
lem depends for adoption upon the
approval of the Hammer and Coffin
Board of Trustees, including Dr.
Wilbur, Comptroller Roth, and
alumni Northcus Ely and Jim Bul
lock.
