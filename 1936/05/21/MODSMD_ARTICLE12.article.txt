# Railroad Unions Set Strike Date
## Higher Wages Demanded By 500 Employees 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 20 (/I I ).—
Officials of two unions announced
today the strike of employees of the
Western Pacific, Sacramento North
ern, and Tidewater Southern Rail
roads would begin next Saturday at
6 p.m. unless an agreement was
reached in the meantime on their
wage demands.
Despite the announcement J. W.
Walsh, Federal mediator, said con
ciliation machinery still was func
tioning and indicated further efforts
would be made to avert the walkout.
Union officials did not say how
many men were involved, but the
number was unofficially estimated
at 500.
The walkout would tic up several
hundred miles of rail line in the
valley area of Central and Northern
California.
The Western Pacific, parent of the
other two roads involved, issued a
statement pointing out the mediator
had the right to recommend the ap
pointment of a fact-finding commit
tee by President Roosevelt—a move
■which would delay the strike at
least.
N. P. Reynolds, vice-president of
the Older of Railway Conductors,
and A. O. Smith, assistant grand
chief of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Engineers, served the strike notice
after conferring with union repre
sentatives from Salt Lake City, Win
nemucca, Nevada, and Stockton and
Portola, California.
