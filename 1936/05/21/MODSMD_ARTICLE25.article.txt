# Hoffman Last Of Party Delegates
## Landon Sweeps To Win Presidential Contest 
### 
NEWARK, N.J., May 20 (/!>). â€”
Governor Harold G. Hoffman, whoso
right to represent the Republican
party at the national convention was
challenged because of his interven
tion in the Hauptmann-Lindbergh
case, tonight finished last among the
party's four elected delegates-at
large as Governor Alf M. Landon of
Kansas won a sweeping victory in
the presidential preference contest.
More than 170,000 persons voted
for Hoffman's foe. Franklin W. Fort,
who sought election solely on the
issue that it would be "a rebuke" to
the Governor for "dragging Jersey
justice in the mire" in the Haupl
mann case.
Although he led Fort by approxi
mately 45,000 votes, the Governor
trailed the state's high man, former
Ambassador Walter E. Edge, by
more than 37,000 votes, and National
Committeewoman Edna B. Conklin
by 7,000 votes.
Governor Landon's four-to-one
victory over Senator William E. Bo
rah In the presidential preference,
which is not binding, and election
of Landon-pledged at-large and dis
trict delegates, assures the Kansan
of at least 28 of the state's 32 votes
at the Cleveland convention next
month. The other four delegates
were unpledged and ran without
designation. Edge said he believed
these four would accept the "deci
sive" Landon verdict and "vote ac
cordingly."
