## Treasury Submits Eleven Different Estimates 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 20 (/P). —
After receiving from the Treasury
revenue estimates ranging from
$536,000,000 to $835,000,000 for 11
different plans for taxing corpora
tions, the Senate Finance Committee
agreed today to begin its crucial test,
voting on the revenue bill tomorrow.
The committee already had agreed
to a proposal in the House bill, in
altered form, for an 80 per cent
windfall tax on processors who
evaded payment of AAA processing
taxes. Then it approved several
modifications in provisions for re
funds of taxes on floor stocks in
hand at the time of invalidation of
the AAA.
Some changes, designed to give
preferential treatment to Canadians
and Mexicans, also were written into
provisions for taxes on non-resident
aliens.
But on the vital matter of how to
go about reshaping the House bill's
provisions for a new system of cor
poration taxes, the committee got no
farther today than the discussion
stage.
Senator Connally (D., Texas) said
he believed the committee would
begin a scries of votes the first thing
tomorrow.
