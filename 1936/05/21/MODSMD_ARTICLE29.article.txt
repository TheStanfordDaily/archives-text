# Pre-Reg Plan Is Promised To Freshmen
## President Suggests That Simplifed Program Of Orientation Be Devised 
### 
With several major details still to
J be worked out, some sort of pre
registration period for incoming
Stanford freshmen was virtually as
sured yesterday.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
i when interviewed by a student coni
; mittee, assured them of his co-op
! eration and sympathy, but suggested
that the plan that had been drawn
j up was too intensive and too elab
| orate.
"Danger in Too Much"
He said: "The great danger is in
getting in too much. The prin
cipal thing is to make the student
feel welcome at the University and
I to make him feel at home, rather
than to have him spend the first
few days in being lectured to and
being examined physically, mcn
! tally, vocationally, and otherwise."
The plan originally worked out
| had included three-day period start
j ing on Thursday before Registration
I Day. It is expected that several of
| the factors will be worked over in
i the student committee to make the
j plan simpler, and shorter.
To Visit Campus Spots
New possibility is that the period
I will start on Saturday morning, with
: a period for students to have a more
! leisurely interview with advisors on
â–  details of courses to be taken and
academic advice.
Also to be included in the plan
will be informal small group bull
j sessions on Honor Code, student
government, and activities. Oppor
j tunities will be given for groups to
visit campus spots such as the Mu
j seum, the Library, the Quad, and to
i familiarize the student with the
1 physical plan of the University.
To Revise l'lan
The group that interviewed Dr.
Wilbur yesterday was made up of
Pat Flavel, chairman of Women's
j Council; Gib Holloway, chairman
of Men's Council; Dean Pierose,
; chairman of the Pre-Registration
| Committee; and Mary Craig, next
j year's head Roble sponsor.
j This group will co-operate with
j Pierose's committee in drafting the
I revised plan.
