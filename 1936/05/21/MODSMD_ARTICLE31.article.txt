### Les Squires 
It seems that conflict may ensue, J
B I ween the Stanford student and
the A.S.U.,
With .shouts of "are we men or are
we mice,"
Their organizers claim delay a vice,
At once they want a delegation,
To rant and rave on how to run the
nation,
With youth's sure surge of activism,
They spurn the tag of communism. .
The claim we fear with holy dread, J
The pulsed beat of change's tread,
And cultivate a state inferior
By sitting on our gay posterior.
This may be true —
The swinging beat of progress finds ;
no home in well filled bellies;
In apathy the blood of youth grows
hard and jellies.
And yet—
With California's sky of blue above, |
And time for singing, time for love, j
With phft.es of food upon the table
And papa's Packard in the stable,
With summer sales at Phelps- ;
Terkel,
And summer moons to cast a spell,
With mugs of beer at fifteen-forty, |
And .swinging tunes from Jimmy j
Dorsey,
With all of this the Stanford rough,
Decides it's really rather tough,
To cram his head with senseless '
things,
Like Peace and Hitler's Nazis.
Bo much is true —
And could the A.S.U.
Arouse the Stanford giant from his !
dreams
Of ten-buck halls and beauty queens, j
The end would justify the means.
This theme will be continued in our
next,
The A.S.U. again will be our text, |
Arid then we'll show in diagram j
The reason that it never can
Win the average Stanford man.
The reason: faults within,
As well as women, gin,
And apathy.
