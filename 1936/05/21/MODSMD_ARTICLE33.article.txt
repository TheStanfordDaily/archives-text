# Substitute For Guffey Coal Bill Given Congress
## Legality of New Measure Based on Regulation Of Interstate Commerce 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (£»>. —
A substitute for the unconstitutional
Guffey coal control act was intro
duced by Senator Guffey (D., Pa.)
today with the statement that the
new measure was based on Con
gress' "undisputed power to regulate
interstate commerce."
An identical bill was introduced
in the House by Representative Vin
son (D., Ky.) on behalf of Repre
sentative Snyder (D., Pa.), coauthor
of the invalidated act.
Action Uncertain
Whether White House support
would be given the new legislation
and whether it would be pressed for
action this session was not known
immediately. Speaker Byrns told
newsmen he did not want to see
anything delay adjournment after
action on the tax and relief bills.
Guffey told the Senate the new
measure made such changes in the
old act "as are necessary to meet
the views of a majority of the Su
preme Court."
Although the new bill is essen
tially the same as the original act
with the unconstitutional labor pro
visions eliminated, it contains one
significant change.
Important Change
Under its terms, the National Bi
tuminous Coal Commission would
consist of seven members, instead
of five. Officials said this change
was made to provide direct repre
sentation of both producers and
miners. Three of the seven com
missioners would have no interest or
connection with the industry.
