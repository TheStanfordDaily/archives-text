# Football Prospects On View Saturday
## 
### 
Varsity football candidates have
decided to hold their annual spring
game Saturday on the practice
field instead of in the stadium as
previously planned. "It's a little
more homey during the spring
quarter," explained Coach Tiny
Thornhill.
The Red team will consist mainly
of first and third stringers, while
the seconds and fourths will oppose
them as the White aggregation. The
coaches plan to use as many men as
possible in order that spectators

will have a chance to look over all
the prospects. The team will miss
Mangan and Clark, whose injuries
will keep them on the sidelines.
