# Farm's Frosh Rate Above Fordham's
## 
### 
Freshman classes at Fordham j
University are on the down grade; !
Stanford's first-year Students are j
hitting a new highâ€”or, at least, they j
are in the opinions of the deans of ;
the two universities.
Rev. Charles J. Deane, dean of
Fordham University, recently de
clared at the annual meeting of the
faculty of his institution that Ford
ham's matriculates of the last few
years have been definitely inferior
as scholars to those of other years, j
Inferior Scholars
Questioned on the subject, Stan
ford's Dean George B. Culver ex
pressed the opinion that the Farm's
recent freshman classes have been
not only the scholastic and mental j
equals of any past classes, but have I
had a more definite idea of why
they are coming to college.
Registrar J. P. Mitchell's aptitude
test figures verify Dean Culver's
contention that there has been no [
slump in scholastic ability. "Over a
period of years there is no appre
ciable variation in the aptitude test
marks," Mr. Mitchell stated.
Trend from Latin
Fordham's dean laid the deficiency
of his freshman classes largely to
the trend away from Latin as a
mainstay of high school preparation.
Dean Culver pointed out that

Stanford's policy of allowing stu
l dents a great deal of leeway in their
choice of preparatory school sub
| jects has always been very satisfac
|tory.
