## THE 						ART OF SAILING: A McGUFFY'S PRIMER 
### 
The newest Farm sport is sailing
(perhaps it might be called "yacht
ing" with the bigger boats). These
spring days are palmy ones for sail
ing, and there is at least a little of
it going on with the students down
at the Palo Alto harbor.
Of course it is racing season in
the up-bay region, every Sunday
seeing many of the towering sails
skimming along between the
Marina and Belvedere.
Down here it is more of a novice
sport. What you do is get hold of a
boat and do your sailing in the
waters bounded by the Dumbarton
Bridge, Sunnyvale, Alviso, and the
Newark salt-pile shore. This is
plenty of room to practice in, so
don't worry about going north and
under the bridge—it makes the
bridge tenders awfully sore in the
first place.
After you have your boat, you try
to drum up a spot of wind, for sans
wind there is little sailing to be
done, unless your boat is equipped
with a Diesel auxiliary or two.
When you have pulled strings and
whistled for the wind, then you
really get down to seamanship and
pull some more strings (they call
them lines and halyards at sea) and
hoist the sails, which generally con
sist of a mainsheet and a jib on the
smaller craft.
BEWARE OOZY
MUD BANKS
The Palo Alto harbor is at the
one! of a fairly narrow slough, so the
job is to pilot your boat through
this and out into open water. Here
care must be taken not to collide
with the banks, or run onto mud
bats, which are especially adroit at
slipping up when no one is paying
much attention and ground your
little cockle-shell upon the beach
into about four fingers of cold, salty,
brackish water.
All of which you may imagine is
not too pleasant, especially when
the tide is going out and the wind is
dying down and you don't feel like
breaking your back hoisting the
center-board (plate of steel forward;
up in front, you landlubber) that
acts as a keel and is very heavy.
Getting out and shoving is very
disagreeable, for you get a thick
coating of Quaternary ooze all over
the feet and legs. So take care not
to get grounded.
TACKING, OR
SECOND-GEAR SAILING
Once out, however, in the open
bay with naught but a stray sand
bar and a forgotten pile or two, all is
gravy and you can lie out on the
deck or cut up all antics imagin
able—beating into the wind, close
hauling, jibing, running with the
wind—and tacking.
This last feat is tops in sailing.
It follows with the realization that
it is impossible to take a sailboat and
expect it to sail right into the wind.
It just doesn't go.
You ve got to tack. When you
want to head into that direction
from which the breeze cometh, you
have to take a zigzag course, head
ing first to the right (starboard tack)
of the wind, then to the left (port
tack) so as the wind can get into
Iho sails and do a bit of propelling.
Of course it takes a long time, for
instance beating up to San Fran
cisco from here against mild trade
winds, but it's either tacking or
swimming, or hitch-hiking.

brackish water.
All of which you may imagine is
not too pleasant, especially when
the tide is going out and the wind is
dying down and you don't feel like
breaking your back hoisting the
center-board (plate of steel forward;
up in front, you landlubber) that
acts as a keel and is very heavy.
Getting out and shoving is very
disagreeable, for you get a thick
coating of Quaternary ooze all over
the feet and legs. So take care not
to get grounded.
TACKING, OR
SECOND-GEAR SAILING
Once out, however, in the open
bay with naught but a stray sand
bar and a forgotten pile or two, all is
gravy and you can lie out on the
deck or cut up all antics imagin
able—beating into the wind, close
hauling, jibing, running with the
wind—and tacking.
This last feat is tops in sailing.
It follows with the realization that
it is impossible to take a sailboat and
expect it to sail right into the wind.
It just doesn't go.
You ve got to tack. When you
want to head into that direction
from which the breeze cometh, you
have to take a zigzag course, head
ing first to the right (starboard tack)
of the wind, then to the left (port
tack) so as the wind can get into
Iho sails and do a bit of propelling.
Of course it takes a long time, for
instance beating up to San Fran
cisco from here against mild trade
winds, but it's either tacking or
swimming, or hitch-hiking.

The newest Farm sport is sailing
(perhaps it might be called "yacht
ing" with the bigger boats). These
spring days are palmy ones for sail
ing, and there is at least a little of
it going on with the students down
at the Palo Alto harbor.
Of course it is racing season in
the up-bay region, every Sunday
seeing many of the towering sails
skimming along between the
Marina and Belvedere.
Down here it is more of a novice
sport. What you do is get hold of a
boat and do your sailing in the
waters bounded by the Dumbarton
Bridge, Sunnyvale, Alviso, and the
Newark salt-pile shore. This is
plenty of room to practice in, so
don't worry about going north and
under the bridge—it makes the
bridge tenders awfully sore in the
first place.
After you have your boat, you try
to drum up a spot of wind, for sans
wind there is little sailing to be
done, unless your boat is equipped
with a Diesel auxiliary or two.
When you have pulled strings and
whistled for the wind, then you
really get down to seamanship and
pull some more strings (they call
them lines and halyards at sea) and
hoist the sails, which generally con
sist of a mainsheet and a jib on the
smaller craft.
BEWARE OOZY
MUD BANKS
The Palo Alto harbor is at the
one! of a fairly narrow slough, so the
job is to pilot your boat through
this and out into open water. Here
care must be taken not to collide
with the banks, or run onto mud
bats, which are especially adroit at
slipping up when no one is paying
much attention and ground your
little cockle-shell upon the beach
into about four fingers of cold, salty,
brackish water.
