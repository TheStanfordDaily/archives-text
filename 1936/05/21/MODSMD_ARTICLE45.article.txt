# Farm Olympic Hopes Will Swim Tonight
## Proceeds Of Carnival to Go To U.S. Team Rider, Needham Race In 1500-meter; Association Records May Be Broken 
### Hunter Hendee 
Dave Rider and Winfield Need
ham, splashing it out for 1500 meters
tonight, will attract Olympic Games
backing coins that may help send
them both to Berlin this summer,
occasion being Coach North Thorn
ton's 'Giant Nite Water Carnival"
in Encina pools.
Records Threatened
Pacific Association marks will be
threatened all the way in the 400,
the 800, and the 1500 meters. It's
Rider's second time trial in the dis
tance, his first being a record-set
ting churn at the Olympic tryouts
last Sunday.
Water polo stars compete in the
annual alumni-varsity free-for-all.
Future Stanford aces take their
places in the front ranks of the
varsity upholding a perfectly clean
slate against past alumni teams.
Despite present poloers Haslacher,
Voss, Giffin, Peterson, Vibert, the
old grads and the grads of '36 should
come out on the long end of the
score. Burns, Clapp, Clemo, de Sil
va, and Woodward look pretty good
to give the alumni their first victory
over the young "upstarts."
Olympic Club Relay Trio
Olympic Club's record-holding
trio in the medley relay will be on
hand to add excitement to the
frosh-varsity match, which looks
close enough in itself. Winged O's
set the world's record for 150 yards
a few weeks ago at Berkeley and
then duplicated the time at Fair
mont. They attempt to break it to
night.
The freshman team swims the
event in 1:25.5, only a half second
slower than the Clubmen's mark.
For want of a really fast breast
stroke swimmer, the varsity does
not get down under 1:26. With
Freshman Towne included among
them, they would be breaking 1:23.
Sinkerswim Performs
Novelty acts, most notable being
performed by Professor Willie

Sinkerswim, promise to be laugh
getters. Professor Sinkerswim is
slated to show just how swimming
and diving are really done.
Frosh star Winkelmann and San
Mateo's brilliant Kalmar will do the
diving from springboards and plat
forms. Winkelmann has planned an
all-twist program, mixing his con
tortions up to make his dives as
kinked as possible.
