# The
						Farm Looks On
## From Associated Press 
### 
A substitute for the unconstitutional !
Guffey coal bill was introduced in j
Congress yesterday by Senator |
Guffey (D., Pa.). It is essentially j
the same, but with the uncon- |
stitutional labor clause eliminated.
The one significant change con
sists of the extension of member
ship in the National Bituminous
Coal Commission from five to
seven in order to provide repre
sentation of both producers and
miners.
Arrest was made yesterday in San
Francisco of John C, Radford, al- ,
leged broker-contact man, for a
mail theft gang which operated !
throughout the Middle West for a j
year, obtaining approximately j
$40,000 in loot. He had been living '
in a Nob Hill apartment for about '
four months.
i
Employees of the Western Pacific, j
Sacramento Northern, and Tide
water Southern will go on strike [
next Saturday at 6 o'clock unless j
an agreement on their wage de- j
mands is reached in the meantime, i
the officials of two unions an- \
nounced yesterday.
