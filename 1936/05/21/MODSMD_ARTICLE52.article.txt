## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Revived Spirit of Equality May Result From Sudden Death of King-Queen Contest 
### 
When the campus had recovered yesterday
from Ex Committee's explosive action to abolish
the Masque Ball King and Queen contest, the
majority of comment centered around the ques
tion of finding a substitute for the contest.
Admittedly, a King-Queen race, as a popular
ity contest, does much to put over the Masque
Ball. As it has been pointed out, the Ball would
be just another dance if it were not for this fea
ture.
There are, however, any number of suitable
substitutes for the outright purchase of crowns.
Among the more plausible suggestions:
1. A straight vote on popularity, with the
results being kept secret until the night of the
dance. The winning king and queen would be
announced at the Masque Ball and crowned
then.
2. A popularity contest with a set entrance
fee for each candidate. A preliminary vote
could eliminate all but five or ten candidates,

and these could be required to pay another set
fee to remain in the contest.
Any of these plans would keep the King-
Queen contest as a valuable publicity feature
of the Convalescent Home Drive; yet none of
them would permit the contest to be run on a
basis of high finance.
Ex Committee did a noble piece of work in
ousting the King-Queen dollar-race. Actual de
tails of a substitute plan, if any is later deemed
necessary, can be worked out by next year's
Drive committee.
A popularity contest is all right for a publicity
gag, but a predominance of dough-heavies, or
a tendency to stop at nothing to gain even mo
mentary personal glory, cannot be disclaimed
as long as contests such as the last King-Queen
auction sale exist.
The Masque Ball is not doomed, but the wild
scramble to buy oneself a crown is deadâ€”and
unmourned.
