# If It's a More Even Split They're After
## 
### 
Congratulations are in order as the result of
the Hammer and Coffin elections yesterday.
Congratulations to Mr. Gist and to Hammer
and Coffin on the new editor.
Congratulations to Hammer and Coffin on
its new profit distribution plan, which eventu
ally turned out to be not quite as half-baked as
several of the previously proposed plans.
Congratulations to the outgoing Alpha Sig
editor and business manager who conscien
tiously ended the Alpha Sig grip on Chaparral
offices, by recommending other men than Al
pha Sigs for the positions.
There is a question, however, that has arisen
out of the hectic meeting and the hectic profit
distributing program. Why should the Chappie
editor get the proposed $60 a month salary?
Objection to this raise is not that the editor does
not earn the salary, for student salaries at Stan
ford are not based on what is the actual work
accomplished.
They are based on a combination of the
honor of the position, the experience gained,
and the award necessary to attract desirable
office-holders.
If it is equity between business manager and
editor that you want, Hammer and Coffin, why
don't you lower the salary of the business man
ager to S5O a month?
