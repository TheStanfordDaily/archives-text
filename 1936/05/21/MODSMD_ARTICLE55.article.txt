## Tell Us, Mr. Hoover 
### 
(From the Michigan Daily)

Mr. Hoover again has spoken. This time he advo
cated, or so he said, a "program of government re
form." If this were entirely true, it would indeed be
surprising, because Mr. Hoover is not the man from
whom one expects "reform," in its commonest mean
ing.
But Mr. Hoover did not really advocate a program
of reform. What he did was merely to call his de
nunciations of the New Deal by a new name. Let us
look at his "reforms."
"Obey the Constitution," he said. "Stop this cat
aract of wasteful expenditure. The budget must be
balanced. The increase in debt must be ended. The
gold standard should be re-established. These futile
purchases of foreign silver should cease. The laws
authorizing the President to inflate the currency and
gamble in foreign exchange should be repealed. Tin
kering with credit inflation must be ended.
« * * *
"Genuine banking reform must be achieved. This
horde of political locusts should be driven away.
. . . The Civil Service should be restored. Return
the administration of relief to the state and local
non partisan committees ... by wise use of tariffs
protect our farmers . . . Give us a government of laws
and not of men . . —and so on.
Where, we asked ourselves when we had finished
reading Mr. Hoover's address, were the reforms.
Hoover's request to obey the Constitution is certainly
not a reform. Nor is it a reform to stop, "wasteful
expenditures, ' reduce the debt, re-establish the gold
standard, or do any of the other things the former
president advocated. His words were but platitudes,
and like his other speeches, mere destructive criticism.
♦ * * *
It is no reform to say certain things should be
done. Give us a plan, a method, by which they can
be eliminated.
What does Mr. Hoover think of unemployment?
What does he propose specifically to do for agricul
ture.' What are his banking reforms? If he takes
government out of business, will he stimulate trade?
II ho returns the relief problem to the states, what
will he do with states that have admitted they can
not handle it?
There are answers to these problems. But Mr.
Hoover, if he knows them, does not tell us.
