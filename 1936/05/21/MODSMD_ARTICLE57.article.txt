I really don't know what this has to do about
anything at all, but it is said that Brother Jack
Temple has recently been inquiring at the librai'y
for educational buuks. The name of these volumes
being: "Education of Exceptional Children" and
"Gifted Children."
It is singular, when we have one Delta Chi an
expert on the rearing of kiddies, while another is a
renowned authority on baby-killing. There is need
for education of the brothers of the brothers of
gifted children if our civilization is to survive, maybe.
One of our recent candidates in the A.S.S.U. elec
tion had a very dear friendship for two S.A.E.'s.
These very dear friends, in fact, affectionately called
him "The Prince." This was not to infer, however,
that he was a prince of a fellow. So "The Prince"
came up to the S.A.E. house one day, and one of the
dear friends spied him on the walk. Said he to his
companion, "Tell our friend that I have gone out,"
and immediately popped himself into a closet. The
honored guest arrived and asked for the departed
brother.
Said the visible brother of the invisible brother,
"Oh, he's gone out."
Asked the guest, "And when will he be back?"
Answered the brother, "In about 10 minutes, I
guess."
"I'll wait," said the Prince.
The Prince waited for one hour and one-half.
There is a rule in some by-law somewhere, in
fact probably in subsection b, clause 2, about women
in fraternity houses. It seems that no woman is al
lowed alone in a fraternity house or men's living
quarters, and then, not above the first floor. Though
this is plainly class legislation in favor of those men
living in the basement, still it seems a quite laudable
rule on the whole. For instance, it is always more
fun double-dating anyway. Be that as it may, and it
may be that, two of Stanford's finest got around sub
section b, clause 2, by appearing together. And they
were not in the basement, they were not on the first
floor, they were not on the second floor, they were
not on the third floor of a certain fraternity house. As
a matter of fact,-they were on the roof.

for education of the brothers of the brothers of
gifted children if our civilization is to survive, maybe.
One of our recent candidates in the A.S.S.U. elec
tion had a very dear friendship for two S.A.E.'s.
These very dear friends, in fact, affectionately called
him "The Prince." This was not to infer, however,
that he was a prince of a fellow. So "The Prince"
came up to the S.A.E. house one day, and one of the
dear friends spied him on the walk. Said he to his
companion, "Tell our friend that I have gone out,"
and immediately popped himself into a closet. The
honored guest arrived and asked for the departed
brother.
Said the visible brother of the invisible brother,
"Oh, he's gone out."
Asked the guest, "And when will he be back?"
Answered the brother, "In about 10 minutes, I
guess."
"I'll wait," said the Prince.
The Prince waited for one hour and one-half.
There is a rule in some by-law somewhere, in
fact probably in subsection b, clause 2, about women
in fraternity houses. It seems that no woman is al
lowed alone in a fraternity house or men's living
quarters, and then, not above the first floor. Though
this is plainly class legislation in favor of those men
living in the basement, still it seems a quite laudable
rule on the whole. For instance, it is always more
fun double-dating anyway. Be that as it may, and it
may be that, two of Stanford's finest got around sub
section b, clause 2, by appearing together. And they
were not in the basement, they were not on the first
floor, they were not on the second floor, they were
not on the third floor of a certain fraternity house. As
a matter of fact,-they were on the roof.
I really don't know what this has to do about
anything at all, but it is said that Brother Jack
Temple has recently been inquiring at the librai'y
for educational buuks. The name of these volumes
being: "Education of Exceptional Children" and
"Gifted Children."
It is singular, when we have one Delta Chi an
expert on the rearing of kiddies, while another is a
renowned authority on baby-killing. There is need
for education of the brothers of the brothers of
gifted children if our civilization is to survive, maybe.
