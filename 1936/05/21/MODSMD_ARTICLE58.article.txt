## NOW ANNIE'S COUSIN FANNY 
### 
There's something about blue
laws that's unendingly gleeful.
New England preachers gloat over
them, bald-pated justices of the

peace glory in
prosecuting them,
and up at Wash
ington State
where there were
just enough of
them to tint the
atmosphere with
a faint Monday
wash blue, the
students had their
first excitement
in 20 years with
a strike against

them.
* * *
And now it comes to light that
Stanford has a blue-law. And a lot
of people are having a gleeful good
time worrying about it.
It is alleged, as the old journal
istic saying goes, that the Admin
istration gets a kick-you-out-of
school complex whenever someone
brings a professional feminine en
tertainer within the mile and a half
limit. An unwritten law, as it is
gleefully called, sprang up long ago
when a young lady hired for a
campus dance made an oldster
blush with her sayings or antics.
* * *
The blue qualities of the law, if
ever there actually was one, have
just about faded away, but still the
organizers of next Friday's Junior
Prom couldn't resist the fun of pull
ing it out in the open. Dorsey has
a woman singer in his band, and he
wants her in the outfit at the Prom.
The Prommen could have forgotten
about the rumor of the so-called
unwritten law and let her come.
But that wouldn't have been enough
fun. They had to see Mrs. Bodle,
Dr. Wilbur, and Ex Committee. The
Dean's office said it was all right to
let the lady come if the Ex Com
mittee thought it was all right. But
the Ex Committee, as has happened
before, didn't think all right. It
passed an unnecessary buck to
President Wilbur.
<s * *
The only possible reason why any
objection should be raised to the
appearance of Kay Weber (that's
the young lady's name) is that she
might "sing the wrong kind of
songs." Of course the fact that male
crooners might wax a bit shady
doesn't matter.
But who would judge what is a

wrong kind of song? If the lady 1
stood up and sang "Annie's Cousin
Fanny" or "Bessie Couldn't Help It"
the customers who paid their $3.75 i
would stand around and think they j
were getting their money's worth. 1
The only one who could find some- ,
thing wrong would be some patron
over in the corner who might con
sider that two of the most familiar i
songs in the collegians' musical |
vocabulary were unfit for "student (
consumption."
* * *
Because some people want to have 1
fun with a semi-existing blue-law,
the young Miss Weber, whose lady- |
like qualities are probably equal to |
those of 99 per cent of the 1100, is j
being insulted.

The only possible reason why any
objection should be raised to the
appearance of Kay Weber (that's
the young lady's name) is that she
might "sing the wrong kind of
songs." Of course the fact that male
crooners might wax a bit shady
doesn't matter.
But who would judge what is a

wrong kind of song? If the lady 1
stood up and sang "Annie's Cousin
Fanny" or "Bessie Couldn't Help It"
the customers who paid their $3.75 i
would stand around and think they j
were getting their money's worth. 1
The only one who could find some- ,
thing wrong would be some patron
over in the corner who might con
sider that two of the most familiar i
songs in the collegians' musical |
vocabulary were unfit for "student (
consumption."
* * *
Because some people want to have 1
fun with a semi-existing blue-law,
the young Miss Weber, whose lady- |
like qualities are probably equal to |
those of 99 per cent of the 1100, is j
being insulted.

There's something about blue
laws that's unendingly gleeful.
New England preachers gloat over
them, bald-pated justices of the

peace glory in
prosecuting them,
and up at Wash
ington State
where there were
just enough of
them to tint the
atmosphere with
a faint Monday
wash blue, the
students had their
first excitement
in 20 years with
a strike against

them.
* * *
And now it comes to light that
Stanford has a blue-law. And a lot
of people are having a gleeful good
time worrying about it.
It is alleged, as the old journal
istic saying goes, that the Admin
istration gets a kick-you-out-of
school complex whenever someone
brings a professional feminine en
tertainer within the mile and a half
limit. An unwritten law, as it is
gleefully called, sprang up long ago
when a young lady hired for a
campus dance made an oldster
blush with her sayings or antics.
* * *
The blue qualities of the law, if
ever there actually was one, have
just about faded away, but still the
organizers of next Friday's Junior
Prom couldn't resist the fun of pull
ing it out in the open. Dorsey has
a woman singer in his band, and he
wants her in the outfit at the Prom.
The Prommen could have forgotten
about the rumor of the so-called
unwritten law and let her come.
But that wouldn't have been enough
fun. They had to see Mrs. Bodle,
Dr. Wilbur, and Ex Committee. The
Dean's office said it was all right to
let the lady come if the Ex Com
mittee thought it was all right. But
the Ex Committee, as has happened
