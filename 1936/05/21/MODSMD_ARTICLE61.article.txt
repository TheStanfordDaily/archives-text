# 'The Unguarded Hour Scenes Stolen by Young
## 
### 
"THE UNGUARDED HOUR,"
j hailing Franc-hot Tone and Loretta 1
j Young as its leads, stars Roland
i Young. As the best friend and coun- ;
I sel of the "Lord and Lady," Young j
j steals scene after scene from both |
j stars.
Loretta Young, in scenes with !
• Tone, shows her usual smile and i

power of making
love. Tone, on the
other hand, is good
in most of his scenes.
Lewis Stone and
Dudley Diggs, in the 1
supporting cast, give

I characteristically excellent per- j
| formanees.
Centering around the courtroom,
! the story deals with an outstanding ;
! English lawyer who ultimately be- j
comes deeply involved in a murder
| case of his own. Satirizing "cir
. cumstantial evidence" in convicting ,
| an "innocent" man, the production
J by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is inter
| esting enough.
"THE SKY PARADE," billed as
i the second feature, was better than j
the average filler. Jimmy Allen
had little enough to do with it, and
i none of the other stars were par- !
ticularly outstanding. Starting dully, j
| the story develops enough to make
it a fairly decent picture.
This picture, too, had a moral, in
that "more safety in flying" was the
I motive behind it all. Jimmy Allen
j will draw the kids, and the story is
I harmless enough to be amusing.
