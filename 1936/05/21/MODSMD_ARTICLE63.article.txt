# Alumni Council Will Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
Six new members of the Alumni
Council will attend their first coun
cil meeting tomorrow night in San
Francisco. The new members were
chosen at the annual meeting of the
Alumni Association on April 25.
They were added to the council as
a result of the passage of an amend
ment providing for increased mem
bership. Tomorrow night's meeting
will also take up a discussion of
plans for the proposed membership
drive which is a part of a five-year
plan scheduled by the association.
