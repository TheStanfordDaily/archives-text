said yesterday.
Although Prom committee mem

with the number of bids sold thus
far, a few remaining tickets may
be secured today at the A.S.S.U. of
fice or tonight at the door for $3.75.
The dance is open to all students.

Assigned workers will begin the
decoration process this morning, in
order to complete preparations for
the arrival of the orchestra this af
ternoon. Dorsey will confer with
Taylor and other Prorn officials to

Ginger ale sherbet-punch will be
served to the dancers as refresh
ment. Programs, featuring a red and
gold color scheme, may be obtained
today at the A.S.S.U. office upon
presentation of tickets.
Probably the most distinguished

gregated for a Prom has been ob
tained to chaperone the affair. In
cluded on the list are President and
Mrs. Piay Lyman Wilbur, Mr. and
Mrs. Almon E. Roth, Mr. and Mrs.
