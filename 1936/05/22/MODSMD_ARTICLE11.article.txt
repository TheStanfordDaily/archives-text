# Oppose Part In Nazi Festival
## A.S.U. Objects To Heidelburg Representation 
### 
If Dr. Robert Eckles Swain, head
of the Chemistry Department, and'
now on leave on a European
is going to represent Stanford at
Heidelberg's "550 th anniversary,"
the American Student Union is
against it.
This body meeting in the base
ment of the Women's Clubhouse last
night, decidcd it as soon as a mem
ber mentioned that the Board o r
Trustees had cabled Stanford's head
chemist to drop in on Hitler's "jun
ior college festival" on the way to
Berlin.
Basis for the Union's protest was
that of the 16 American universities
that Hitler had said were coming to
his party, six openly denied it, in
cluding Vassal - . The Columbia Un
ion picketed the Columbia library
after President Nicholas Murray
Butler early this month had refused
to withdraw the Columbia candidate.
Other business done by the Un
ion, as its 16 members unitedly
fronted each other in an irregular
semicircle and raised their voices in
competition with the blatant strains
of the senior jolly-up jazz on the
floor above, included the election of
officers for next year. President will
be Gordon Becbe; sccretary-treas
urcr, Bill Millis; and publicity
chairman, Stephen Enke.
Stanford delegates to the six-day
summer camp for the training of
"progressive leadership" will be
Drayton Bryant and Don Crawford.
Other students interested in attend
ing camp and taking in the camp's
three-fold training in social trends,
campus trends, and campus organ
ization may get in touch with Bryant.
