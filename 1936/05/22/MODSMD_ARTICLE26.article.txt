LANDON'S STANDING
following Wednesday's primary
( lections in New Jersey which gave
Landon another set of about 30 dele
gates, the totals are:
Knox, victories in two states, and
a total of 40 delegates.
Corah, victories in five states and
ntotal of 55 delegates.
l.andon, victories in six states,
total 128 delegates.
Booming Governor Landon is go
ing ahead swiftly, and next week
the "Stop Landon" movement will
hep,in.
To open the "Stop Landon" move
ment, Senator Borah will make a
lom;-awaited speech in which he is
iii;' to tell the truth about Gov
ernor Landon. If the Republicans
in his own party don't, the Demo
crats will!"
Hut I don't think the more am
bitious Republicans will stop Lan
don that way. It may even add to
his prestige to be "told the truth
about." Heaping abuse on people's
heads is often a boomerang to the
heaper. We'll wait and see. Don't
forget—Borah's speech next week.
Landon is not assured of the
iiomination by any means. With over
00 delegates to the Republican con
dition unpledged, Landon's 128
ioks mighty small. None of the
andidates are a cinch. Borah's
it tfh may alter the standing of the
npk dged delegates, because it may
.el; enough of a wallop to swing
the men away from the Kansan, or
may have the opposite effect and
! sten the "uninstructed" ones close
\-j London's coat tails.

VAIT TILL 11(40"
( i! looters at the Big Game, after
ey have torn the planks from the
' ; chers, and sung their Alma
ater, cry out, "Wait till next year!"
So, during this campaign for the
( i.lency of the U.S., the Farmer
tbor party cries, "Wait till 1940."
Planning to hold an extrava
ant round-up and rodeo in
. !M0 to rope in all the straying
iiaverick liberals throughout the
S.. Farmer-Laborites look ahead
a the day when they hope to
athcr into one corral every
American liberal and elect a presi
dent.
With hopes of uniting the Social
is. the Communists, the Wisconsin
ob of progressives, and all the rest,
e leaders can see themselves being
ined by powerful men like Mayor
tGuardia of New York City, Nor
;.m Thomas, and the Wisconsin
tFollettes. The union of the vary
g American liberals might pos
bly be strong enough to achieve
Cir aim.
President Roosevelt will have to
I > reckoned with in forming such a
my, for he is moulding a separate
liitical brotherhood which consists
labor, farmers, down-and-outers,
(I progressive thinkers. The
• -esident is being abandoned by
i iriess men who pled on their
k s for his succor in 1933, the
n.servative Democrats are avoid
t.: him. too. .He stands close to the
timer Labor party's members and
'inpalhizers, and he catches the
•e of many another left-leaning
iter.
But marriage of the Farmer-
V.lior group with the President
wd his sympathizers today doesn't
.<em likely. Many liberal men
a; ree with the President's aims,
litit lew of them can he cnthusias
l'c about the methods he employs.
The President could really show
V'icrica that he has as much guts
he has ability to be a political
>pportunist. Right now is the psy
h'.logical moment (after the repu
tation of his GufTey Act) to openly
Hid brazenly sponsor an amendment
o (he Constitution v/hich would give
C ingress the power to regulate
wages and hours in any and all in
dustries.
