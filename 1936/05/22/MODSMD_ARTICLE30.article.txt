# Pocket-Size Mechanism Operates Clock Tower
## Weight System Replaced By New Machinery

tiny, synchronous motor, hardly
larger than an old-fashioned pocket
watch, operates a mechanism which
tells 3800 what time it is, when to go
to cltass and when to leave every day.
Hbdden away m the familiar
woolen clock tower between the
engineering buildings, this little
systeixi controls all other time-keep
ers on the campus and rings all the
class bells by relay apparatus.
The \ four huge bells and Seth
Thomas clock were housed, until
the earthquake, in the steeple atop
the Memorial Church, explains long,
lean Frank Stowe, grizzled electrical
foreman. In 1906 the tremors shook
this superstructure down into the
building and ruined the Chapel com
pletely.
One year later the clock tower
was erected. Until last year, all op
erated by a weight system and had
to be wound daily. Today only the
machinery which strikes the bells
works by weights; the clock is run
by the electric motor, regulated
hourly by Western Union.
Rust is caked an eighth of an inch
thick on the clappers which have
never rung. Great sledge hammers,
tiny, synchronous motor, hardly
larger than an old-fashioned pocket
