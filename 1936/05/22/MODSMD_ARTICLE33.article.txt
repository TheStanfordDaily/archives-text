NOW THAT the quarter is draw
ing to a close and Daily publication
ceases next Friday, the Women's
Page makes its farewell appearance.
It has afforded the "Eleven Hun
dred" a section of the paper devoted
to its own issues. It's been an inter
esting experiment and should be
worth continuing in Volume 90.
NOW THAT Cardinals are again
in the throes of choosing new mem
bers and okehing Rally Committee
choices, a definite attempt is being
made in the right direction, spread
ing top jobs among as many capable
people as possible. A bouquet to
Dick Stark for endeavoring to keep
politics out of such appointments.
NOW HI AT politics are all over
but the shouting — and the work
next year—the "Eleven Hundred"
may very well pat itself on the back
for its splendid turnout at the polls.
Seventy per cent of campus women
voted, in contrast to a 45 per cent
vote of the men.
Hall women should continue the
struggle for limited dining room
privileges for themselves. Such a
move on the part of the University
would help to equalize Hall and Row
advantages, besides promoting more
friendly social relations between
these two factions on the campus.
NOW THAT graduation looms up
in the near future for the Class of
'36, the value of business training
seems increasingly important. If the
classes still in Stanford will realize
that such training could be incorpo
rated in the "Farm" curriculum with
a saving of time and money for
themselves, the University would
probably consider such an innova
tion.
ANI) NOW in true journalistic
fashion the Women's Page signs it
self "Thirty."
