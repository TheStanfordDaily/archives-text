# Conference Party Placed on Probation
## Barbara Kimball To Carry Out Former Policies Of Mercedes Bergmann 
### 
With the exception of placing the
annual Women's Conference party
on one year probation, Barbara
Kimball, newly elected president of
Women's Conference, intends to car
ry out the policy of Mercedes Berg
mann, retiring president, for the
coming year.
The change in the system was
made when the party was consid
ered purely a rushing function and
not planned for all the incoming
women. A benefit fashion tea will
replace it in the winter quarter after
rushing is over. Proceeds will help
put a woman through Stanford.
Because of the success of the fac
ulty-student dessert parties ar
ranged for transfer women, they
will be continued. More faculty co
operation will be sought and the
possibility of opening them to men
transfers will be considered.
The purpose of Women's Confer
ence, working in conjunction with
the Dean of Women's office, is to
combine all the interests of the
women into one group through
which Hall-Row relations are
strengthened.
The group is composed of the
presidents of the Union, the Union
Unit, Roble, a freshman representa
tive, the president of Lagunita, and
the four casa presidents, and one
representative from each of the nine
sorority houses. The president of
Conference is ex-officio a member
of Ex Committee.
