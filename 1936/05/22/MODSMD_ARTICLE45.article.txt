# Clubhouse Matron Reviews Impressions of Stanford
## 
### Margaret Loud 
"Stanford students have grown
up. They aren't as high schoolish
and grammar schooliih as they used
to be." This is the comforting opin
ion held by Mrs. Ethel Ewell, matron
at the Women's Clubhouse.
In her 20 years at Stanford, Mrs.
Ewell has contacted a great number
of students, having many friends
among Stanford graduates. "The
only person I envy," she frequently
says, "is Jack McDowell, academic
secretary, because he can keep track
of more Stanfordites than I can."
Employs Students
Mrs. Ewell's day starts at G in
the morning and often lasts until 1
or 2 at night. Her work consists of
making all arrangements for club
house functions such as setting up
chaij-s and cleaning the rooms. Of
course she has to employ a lot of
help, and she prefers hiring students
to any others. "All those who have
worked for me are now getting fine
salaries," she proudly asserts. "I
can't recall a one who isn't doing
good work in some field."
Mrs. Ewell likes to relate tragic,
comic, or dramatic anecdotes about
clubhouse happenings. One night,
after a dance, she was awakened by
a curious wailing noise. Fearing
that someone was either hurt or try
ing to get in the windows, she
grabbed her six-shooter and went
upstairs to investigate. There she
found a hulking, six-foot rough,
who had evidently "passed out" dur
ing the dance, crying, "I want to go
home."
Another time, a famous psychi
atrist, visiting the University, was
spending the night in the club guest
room. Some students were having a
dance in the clubhouse at the same
time and Mrs. Ewell hoped the noise
wouldn't disturb the visitor. "Oh.
that's all right," he answered, "I live
in an insane asylum."
Wedding Held There
The clubhouse has seen every
type of social function except a
funeral, according to Mrs. Ewell.
Blake Wilbur and Lyman Wilbur,
son and nephew of the president,
were married there. One wedding
was cancelled because the guests
found out they couldn't drink the
bride's health in the proper bever
ages on the Stanford campus.
Not as many dances are given in
the clubhouse now as when it was
