## DINK SMILES; BIG IMPROVEMENTS 
### 
Aside from the rankling of hun
dreds of intramural sprinters clut
tering up his Angel 1 Field these days
Robert Lyman "Dink" Templeton is
for all outward purposes a satisfied
citizen.
Satisfied because his track team
this year, consisting of fewer cham
pions and more good plain point
winners than for many, many years,
beat Cal, beat the Olympic Club,
beat Washington, and did the undo
able to tie U.S.C. at the Fresno
Relays.
Satisfied these days especially be
cause his boys are improving rapid
ly over the form they showed to
beat Cal. Dixon — that wonderful
winning little miler—Burrows, Mc-
Curdy, Weiershauser, Dean, Klop
stock, these six runners especially
are outdoing their own "best" marks
right and left.
Dixon runs below 4:17 at Fresno
and 3:07.(J in the 3 laps to break the
Eastman-Nimmo record; Burrows a
stride behind Dixon at 3.08; McCur
dy under 50 for the quarter; Weier
shauser at 48.(5 for his best practice
mark; Dean doing 9.8, approaching
old J.C. form but more consistent;
Klopstock trimming Roy Kirkpat
rick in a 14.4 flight of highs.
So Dink can have no qualms about
the present quality of his team and
its potential potency in the Confer
ence meet and the N.C.2-A.
DIXON. BURROWS,
KLOPPIE SHOWING
With the advent of Dixon to star
dom it's going to be interesting to
watch the little rambler in these fu
ture meets. He is a cinch to clean
any collegian on the Coast, with the
possible exception of his partner,
Chuck Nimmo.
Then you can never be sure that
in his present form he isn't going
back East and sneak in there with
Venzke and Cunningham and the
boys and maybe make the Olympic
team in (he 1500 meters. Anybody
that can break a Ben Eastman record
by a couple of seconds is a fair
competitor in any circle.
Then there's the sophomore, Ed
Burrows. He wasn't much shakes
as the great two-miler he was sup
posed to be all through the dual
meet season, just coming from be
hind to win all of the big races. In
winning he failed to break any rec
ords for fast time, and that's what
he has to do to place, or even enter,
in the N.C.2-A.
It now looks, though, like Ed
is going to get the speed practice.
He broke Eastman's three-lap rec
ord Wednesday, and will get plenty
of race in the conference meet next
week when he meets Lantz of S.C.,
who is supposed to have trailed
Norm Bright when Norm ran 9.29
at Whitticr Tuesday night. As Lantz
is not a strong finisher Ed should
beat him and get the confidence
and speed at the same time.
Then there's Klopstock, who
looked more aggressive and spright
ly than ever to beat Kirkpatrick. He
was bending into the barriers like
life itself depended on it and by
that race alone sticks himself up
into good chance bracket for the
Olympics. —Breed

by a couple of seconds is a fair
competitor in any circle.
Then there's the sophomore, Ed
Burrows. He wasn't much shakes
as the great two-miler he was sup
posed to be all through the dual
meet season, just coming from be
hind to win all of the big races. In
winning he failed to break any rec
ords for fast time, and that's what
he has to do to place, or even enter,
in the N.C.2-A.
It now looks, though, like Ed
is going to get the speed practice.
He broke Eastman's three-lap rec
ord Wednesday, and will get plenty
of race in the conference meet next
week when he meets Lantz of S.C.,
who is supposed to have trailed
Norm Bright when Norm ran 9.29
at Whitticr Tuesday night. As Lantz
is not a strong finisher Ed should
beat him and get the confidence
and speed at the same time.
Then there's Klopstock, who
looked more aggressive and spright
ly than ever to beat Kirkpatrick. He
was bending into the barriers like
life itself depended on it and by
that race alone sticks himself up
into good chance bracket for the
Olympics. —Breed
Aside from the rankling of hun
dreds of intramural sprinters clut
tering up his Angel 1 Field these days
Robert Lyman "Dink" Templeton is
for all outward purposes a satisfied
citizen.
Satisfied because his track team
this year, consisting of fewer cham
pions and more good plain point
winners than for many, many years,
beat Cal, beat the Olympic Club,
beat Washington, and did the undo
able to tie U.S.C. at the Fresno
Relays.
Satisfied these days especially be
cause his boys are improving rapid
ly over the form they showed to
beat Cal. Dixon — that wonderful
winning little miler—Burrows, Mc-
Curdy, Weiershauser, Dean, Klop
stock, these six runners especially
are outdoing their own "best" marks
right and left.
Dixon runs below 4:17 at Fresno
and 3:07.(J in the 3 laps to break the
Eastman-Nimmo record; Burrows a
stride behind Dixon at 3.08; McCur
dy under 50 for the quarter; Weier
shauser at 48.(5 for his best practice
mark; Dean doing 9.8, approaching
old J.C. form but more consistent;
Klopstock trimming Roy Kirkpat
rick in a 14.4 flight of highs.
So Dink can have no qualms about
the present quality of his team and
its potential potency in the Confer
ence meet and the N.C.2-A.
DIXON. BURROWS,
KLOPPIE SHOWING
With the advent of Dixon to star
dom it's going to be interesting to
watch the little rambler in these fu
ture meets. He is a cinch to clean
any collegian on the Coast, with the
possible exception of his partner,
Chuck Nimmo.
Then you can never be sure that
in his present form he isn't going
back East and sneak in there with
Venzke and Cunningham and the
boys and maybe make the Olympic
team in (he 1500 meters. Anybody
that can break a Ben Eastman record
by a couple of seconds is a fair
competitor in any circle.
