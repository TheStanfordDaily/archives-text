# Gridders Clash Tomorrow On Practice Field
## First, Third Strings Will Meet Seconds, Fourths In Annual Spring Game 
### 
Gridders have decided to hold
their annual spring game tomorrow
on the practice field instead of in
the Stadium as previously planned.
"It's a little more homey during the
spring quarter," explains Coach Tiny
Thornhill. The game will start at
2:15.
Four strings of men will have a
chance to show the student body
what they can do under actual com
petition. The Red team will be a
combination of first and third string
men, while seconds and fourths will
play for the Whites.
New Men Rale
Promising candidates have found
places in the sun in practice this
quarter. Ed Gamier, from the 1935
frosh team, will be showing his stuff
at halfback for the Reds. Paulman,
Williams, and Colfis will hold their
usual posts in the backfield. Coffis
will be invaluable next year as safe
ty man.
Leo Ferko, who transferred this
year from S.F.U., has been looking
good in the guard post, and will be
on the opening line-up for the
Reds. Pete Zagar, giant tackle from
the frosh, will be out to show his
ability in blocking and leading
plays. Sutton, also a frosh, will con
tinue his regular position at center.
Rasmussen at End
Neil Rasmussen has been out
standing this quarter on the right
flank, where he will play for the
Whites tomorrow. Drace and Brig
ham, both expert guards, will start
for the Whites. In the tackle posts
will be two frosh, Byron West, who
looks especially promising, and Bob
McWayne.
In the White backfield will be
several hopefuls. The starters have
not yet been chosen. Eyes from the
sidelines will be especially peeled
for Bill Kirsch, freshman halfback,
who is one of the finest tacklers on
the squad.
