Rumors of an assemblage of foot
| ball players under the Stanford ban
ner which would put the mythical
ail-American aggregations of the
sports writers to mere prep school
possibilities are going the rounds
these days—and they are not with
out foundation. To verify these wild
speculations simply take a look at
the Farm coaching staff.
Here, with one possible exception,
is the nucleus of as potent a grid
outfit as ever hit the turf of any
I gridiron. All star backfield aces, and
mammoth linemen are equally nu
| merous on the squad which is picked
, from the Stanford coaches.
Ends Are Efficient
To proceed with this invincible
eleven. At ends we find Jim Lawson
and Murray Cuddeback, each of
whom pulled many a ball game out
of the fire for Pop Warner during
their undergraduate days.
Tackle candidates -are Tiny Thorn
hill and Roy Winkleman. The head
man ol the Indian coaching staff is
considered hefty enough to handle
the job, as he weighs in the neigh
borhood of 250 pounds. Winkleman,
though somewhat smaller, is tough
enough to team with Tiny.
Larry Rouble lands one guard po
sition, but the other one presents a
problem which is solved only by in
serting the fighting "Husky" Hunt
| into the vacant spot. Husky is
j small, but so was Notre Dame's all -
\ American Bert Metzger.
Muller at Center
Foi' the center duties big Wes
| Muller gets the nomination, and any
. one who witnessed Wes manhandling
the Southern Methodist Mustangs in
j the Rose Bowl will agree that we
I have chosen the best, possible man
to fire the ball at the backs.
Behind the line of luminaries
which has been gathered we place a
i quartet of backs who can do every
-1 thing with a pigskin but turn it into
j a sheepskin. Here come the famous
1 four.
Backfield Has Stuff
Fullback: Bobby Grayson, the
name that is synonymous with skill
j and daring wherever football is
played. He can pass, run with any
of 'em, and call signals. Quarter
back: Jimmy Bradshaw. All who
are old enough to grow long whis
i kers can recall how the little rabbit
j used to scamper for Nevada. They
' just couldn't hang on to him.

Backfield Has Stuff
Fullback: Bobby Grayson, the
name that is synonymous with skill
j and daring wherever football is
played. He can pass, run with any
of 'em, and call signals. Quarter
back: Jimmy Bradshaw. All who
are old enough to grow long whis
i kers can recall how the little rabbit
j used to scamper for Nevada. They
' just couldn't hang on to him.
Rumors of an assemblage of foot
| ball players under the Stanford ban
ner which would put the mythical
ail-American aggregations of the
sports writers to mere prep school
possibilities are going the rounds
these days—and they are not with
out foundation. To verify these wild
speculations simply take a look at
the Farm coaching staff.
Here, with one possible exception,
is the nucleus of as potent a grid
outfit as ever hit the turf of any
I gridiron. All star backfield aces, and
mammoth linemen are equally nu
| merous on the squad which is picked
, from the Stanford coaches.
Ends Are Efficient
To proceed with this invincible
eleven. At ends we find Jim Lawson
and Murray Cuddeback, each of
whom pulled many a ball game out
of the fire for Pop Warner during
their undergraduate days.
Tackle candidates -are Tiny Thorn
hill and Roy Winkleman. The head
man ol the Indian coaching staff is
considered hefty enough to handle
the job, as he weighs in the neigh
borhood of 250 pounds. Winkleman,
though somewhat smaller, is tough
enough to team with Tiny.
Larry Rouble lands one guard po
sition, but the other one presents a
problem which is solved only by in
serting the fighting "Husky" Hunt
| into the vacant spot. Husky is
j small, but so was Notre Dame's all -
\ American Bert Metzger.
Muller at Center
Foi' the center duties big Wes
| Muller gets the nomination, and any
. one who witnessed Wes manhandling
the Southern Methodist Mustangs in
j the Rose Bowl will agree that we
I have chosen the best, possible man
to fire the ball at the backs.
Behind the line of luminaries
which has been gathered we place a
i quartet of backs who can do every
-1 thing with a pigskin but turn it into
j a sheepskin. Here come the famous
1 four.
