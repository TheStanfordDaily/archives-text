# Oneal Wins In Golf Semi-finals
## Erskine Leads Wallace, Crable for Team Post 
### 
Bill Oneal was the first to enter
the finals of the all - University
championship golf tourney yester
day when he emerged a close win
ner over Cal Manning, frosh star,
on the eighteenth hole, 1 up.
Spec Stewart, who is playing some
of the best golf of his career and is
a prime favorite to capture the
crown, will meet A1 Hyman in the
other semi-final match this after
noon to determine Oneal's opponent.
Meanwhile Moe Erskine took a
lead over Jack Wallace and John
Crable in their battle to determine
Stanford's fourth representative at
the National Intercollegiates in Chi
cago this summer. Erskine shot a
72, one over par, while Wallace took
a 74 and Crable a 77. Both Erskine
and Wallace shot even par figures
on the incoming nine.
Eighteen more holes of medal will
be played by these three today, to
be followed by 36 holes of Nassau
next week. Other Stanford men to
appear at the Chicago tourney are
Stewart, Don Edwards, Bob Thomp
son, while Pete Haas and Bob Welch,
who live in the Chicago region, may
also compete under Card colors at
their own expense.
The Card four-man team will
leave the campus immediately after
school is out in order to get in a
little practice before the tourney
begins on June 21.
Coleman County, Tex., apiarists
predict a large honey crop as the
mesquite, principle source of honey,
reached full bloom 30 days earlier
than usual.
