## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Waiting Until Commencement To Ask "What Next?" May be a Fatal Mistake

While Stanford seniors ostensibly are con
cerned with Senior Week activity, pending fi
nals, and their last three weeks of college life,
there is another problem that is just beginning
to cause many members of the Class of '36 much
anxiety â€”"What next?"
Though it's hard to believe, many of these
seniors have waited until the last month of their
collegc careers before they begin looking for
a job, or even begin making a choice of pro
fession.
The Vocational Guidance Committee, whose
function it is to give willing help to any student
in choosing a life's v/ork, annually tells a sad
tale of "too late" to dozens of procrastinators
who come around seeking "guidance" on the
eve of graduation.
And directors of the Appointment Service tell
stories of seniors who actually call up during
Senior Week to find out, for the first time, about
"chances for a job."
Of course any kind of vocational guidance
is all but useless after a student has completed
his four years of study. And a senior who thinks
that the University will present him with a job
along with his diploma without his having
made application ahead of time is either a pro
found optimist or a fool.
Approximately half of the freshmen enter
ing Stanford have made no choice of vocation.
Realizing that this situation is normal, the Uni
versity requires all students to take courses in
many different departments during their lower

division years in the hope that they will become
interested in some field of their own accord.
To supplement this, it offers vocational guid
ance in the form of aptitude tests which tell a
student what he is best fitted to do; vocational
interviews with men and women already estab
lished in the professions; and field trips and
talks in various fields.
But many students who actually need this
help refuse to take advantage of it. And when
graduation time comes around, a fairly large
minority of the seniors still don't know what
they are going to do to earn a living.
Many freshmen come to college unable to
comprehend that their last four years of school
ing is at hand and that it is necessary to study
toward a goal. The student who chooses his
subjects by their difficulty or convenience is
preparing himself for nothing.
It is now too late for Stanford to equip the
outgoing seniors who have not decided what
life work they will pursue.
But the University has the facilities and will
ingness to assist the juniors and sophomores
with this important decision, and to point them
along the academic track that will lead them to
graduation equipped to be something more than
the parlor lizards many of them have been v/hile
in college.
By the time a student has entered his last year
in a university, he should know into which field
he intends to go. If he dilly-dallies through that
senior year, he may iater find it was a fatal mis
take.
