# No Fault of Individuals But of the System
## 
### 
The Masque Ball King and Queen Contest is
dead, but its unfortunate consequences have
not entirely disappeared. Still living on the
campus are martyrs to the contest, v/hose names
have been subject to spite and discrimination,
editorial as well as personal recrimination, be
cause they were the personification of the sa
lient features of the contest.
The Daily certainly has not referred to the
winners of this year's contest in its whole
hearted dinging of the plan. The winners are
certainly not to be blamed for the contest. It
may be that their supporters were injudicious or
indiscreet, but their supporters were no more
so than the supporters of many of the losing
candidates. The quality of the contest was no
worse this year than that cf previous years,
though it was grosser in its tremendous propor
tions.
Last year's affair was much worse than this
year's in that one individual was singled out
for an unwarranted personal attack, and much
petty back-biting filled not only clique circles
but got into the columns of The Daily.
Such unpleasantries were the results of the
midsummer madness induced by the system—
the frantic struggle that made sororities par
ticularly, and fraternities secondarily, feel that
they were obligated to carry on the dubious
battle.
Nov/ that it is over and new systems may be
devised, the individual student may again par-

ticipate and feel that the contest is his contest,
and the sororities and fraternities can spend
their money in mending the plumbing and fix-
I ing up the chesterfield.
