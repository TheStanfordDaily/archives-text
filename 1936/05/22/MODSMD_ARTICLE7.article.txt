# Rider Smashes Swim Record By 13 Seconds
## Varsity Poloists Win 8-3 Over Alumni in Olympic Benefit at Pools 
### 
i With true Olympic form and time, |
Dave Rider flashed through 63 1
: lengths of Encina pools last night to
! lap the freshman sensation Winficld ;
Needham and break his week-old
j record for the 1300 metes by 13 sec- i
1 onds, as Farm swimmers co-operated
in an effort to raise money for
American Olympic Games teams.
A little later next year's varsity
; water polo players upset predictions I
| and alumni hopes as they battled out :
j an 8-3 victory over the old grads.

Stanford swimmers, alias the
Cardinal Indians, will play un
officially in the Olympic Club
water polo tournament to be
held tomorrow afternoon in the
Fleishbacker Pool in San
Francisco. The first half will
be played against the Olympic
Club aggregation who defeat
ed the Berkeley Bears, Cal
swimmers, last week, and the
second against San Jose State.
Eight men will be chosen from
the contesting teams to appear
in Chicago for Olympic tryouts
in June.

The old polocrs still have an annual
varsity-alumni contest to win.
Chili Wins Relay
Third big event was the 150-yard
medley relay with the world's rec
ord holding trio of Mowatt, Brot
man, and Diamond from the Olympic
Club failing to better their old mark
of 1:25 flat but still coming through
ahead of the fast-splashing varsity
a second slower than the record.
Don Towne, breast-stroke member
of the third-place freshman combi
nation, will attempt to better his
world record in the 50-meter event
at the Fleishhacker pool tomorrow.
His chief competitor is expected to
be Olympic Club's Brotman, mem
ber of the victorious relay.
Rider's decisive win over the
freshman star here last night re
moves all doubt as to which is the
Farm's real Olympic prospect. His
victory Sunday at the scctional try
outs in San Francisco might have
been tainted because the yearling
wds watching Dick Keating, who he
believed was the man to beat, and
was swimming a long course for the
first time this year.
Rider Easy Winner
But it was Rider all the way after
the half-way mark last night, and
when he slipped under the rope in
the amazing time of 20:25.7 he was
just about 35 yards ahead of Need
ham. Four hundred and 800 P.A.
marks were unofficially bettered on
the way.
Rider's time removes all doubt as
to just how good his chances are for
Berlin competition this summer. It
was good enough to place a second
and a half behind the "world's
greatest swimmer," Jack Medica, at
the National Intercollegiate meet
last March at Yale.
