What rhymes with Dorsey
But horsey?
What goes with swing
Except ding?
What sounds like Prom
But the burp of a bomb?
What rhymes with Dorsey
But horsey?
Horsey Dorsey swing ding do, bomb the Prom,
swing you too.
Swim the Prom, Prom the horsey, Dorsey the horsey,
and all for $3.75, at no increase in price.
This is just a sample. Now the reason for this, if
you are interested, and even if you aren't, but of
course you are, the Junior Prom committee came
around to me in a body and said: "Now we're going
to put on a dance that costs $1300."
"Yes," I said in a body.
"And we're going to sell bids for quite a lot. Now
many people read your colyum because they think
they're going to see their names in it."
"Yes," I said, "I do too."
"But if they see Dorsey's name in, they will want
to buy a lot of bids, which will make the Prom
enough money to put in some potted palms behind the
orchestra."
"Yes," I said. This reminded me of the time I
promised to mention the Soph Cotillion twice in the
colyum, in return for a free bid.
The first day I got Cotillion to rhyme with Parillian,
and on the second it had got around to hostillion.
As a result of all this, the Cotillion began 1o lose
sales, and I didn't get the bid, because the A.S.S.U. was
cutting down on expenditures and Our Hasher.
"Will you mention the Prom in your colyum?"
they asked.
"Yes," I said, "but what rhymes with Dorsey but
horsey?"
Which ail gets back to the vital issue:
You can cross your Proms with silver
You can cross your palms while potted
And cross your pots while sotted
But you can't cross Dorsey with horsey.
Corsey
Dorsen't
(or Horsen't)
Get Horsey with mc.
