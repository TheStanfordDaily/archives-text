# An Appointment Worthy of Recognition
## 
### 
: Much ballyhoo and, in years past, several po
; litical scandals have accompanied the semi-an
nual election and appointments of new directors
of The Daily's editorial policy.
It is with less publicity but fully as much
work to be done, experience to be gained, and
routine tasks to be attended to, that the new
i business manager each year is given financial
control of the largest student business enter
prise on the campus.
Jerry Brown, efficient, conscientious Palo Alto
advertising manager for the past 12 months,
I yesterday was appointed business manager of
i Volumes 90 and 91.
! Brown's reliable work was particularly appar
j ent during a chaotic midyear change of man
agers.
His ability to keep things running smoothly
and his co-operative spirit make the financial
outlook bright for next year's Daily.
