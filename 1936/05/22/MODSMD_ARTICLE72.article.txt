## Admirals at Play 
### 
(From The Columbia Spectator)
Tho pride of (he United States Navy, the Pacific
Fleet, steamed into Balboa. Canal Zone, on Saturday
marking the completion of "Problem 17," another out
ing for the Admirals.
For a month the entire division has been chasing
all over the Pacific, shooting oil guns and sneaking
along in the expanse to surprise an innocent cloud
on the horizon. Probably natives on some tiny island
were scared stiff by the appearance of several bil
lion dollars worth of battleships bearing down on their
barren sand dune to save the world for . . .
But the Admirals had fun. And the men, too.
In fact, somewhere in the Pacific are the bodies of
twelve young men, sacrificed to the insistence of
Americans for adequate protection against visionary
enemies. Twelve officers and men have met sudden
death since (he fleet left San Diego.
That is the "off-the-record" cost of the maneuvers.
Airplane crashes, mistaken calculations and experi
ments, and this is only "Problem 17." Every month war
games take their harvestâ€”men killed in order that the
real thing may be more effective and deadly.
But the Admirals had fun.
