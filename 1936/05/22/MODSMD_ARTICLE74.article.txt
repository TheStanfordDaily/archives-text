## FIFTH-CLASS FRESHMEN 
### 
When the Class of '3(5 exchanges '
dummy diplomas for real ones after
Commencement Exercises, it won't
be all over. As a matter of fact it j
will be just starting.
If you disagree, read what Wal
lace B. Donham, Dean of Harvard's
Clraduatp School

uraauuie ouuuui
of Business Ad
ministration, has
to say about "The
Class of 19 3 6
Seeks a Job" in
the current Sat
urday Evening
Post.
He regards the
graduate's mor-j
tar-board as aj
freshman's dink,
the academic

gown as the fresh
man's blue jeans, and the person 1
wearing them as a rather pitiable
orphan of the world's economic j
storm.

His viewpoint is shocking, for he
sees the college-curried man as a
tyro in everything, a mere "seller in j
a buyer's market" with little to
sell.
University knowledge is little di
rect help in getting a job, the dean
has found. Graduates are hired i
largely because of innate qualities |
only incidentally developed by col- !
lege life—such things as personality,
controlled aggressiveness, appear
ance, habits of thought, willingness
to learn.
Even though one is the product
of a world-famous engineering
school of business, one won't know
much of value to the first em
ployer, he declares.
Business men, Dean Dunham says,
have found this premise a practical
one. The graduate is stuck with it.
* * *
But though Dean Dunham tells us
how business feels—regarding us as
freshmen naturally subject to a long
period of orientation, he does not
tell us why it feels that way.
He doesn't consider what many of
us realize is a basic defect in col
lege education—that we are being
trained not for the bottom-of-the
ladder but for the
job; that social science majors are
educated to enjoy life's champagne
accruing only from a champagne
salary; that business school majors ,
are being trained to head United
States Steel; that engineers are be
ing trained to design Boulder Dams

and Golden Gate Bridges.
True, such training will be val
uable when we do get to the top,
may even help slightly at the bot
tom. But has it efficiency when we
are mere freshmen in business and
the professions?
And how much more valuable
would be a little deliberate training
for some of the lower jobs, these
we must start on and those most of
us will always hold?
* * *
If, as Dean Donham says, we are
inevitably freshmen in life after be
ing seniors in college, why not edu
cate us for that subordination?
Perhaps then the job-getting value
of a college education, cardinal rea
son for spending four years and
dad's money, would actually figure
in a prospective employer's ap
praisement along with such things
as personality, hardly direct incre
ments of university training.
