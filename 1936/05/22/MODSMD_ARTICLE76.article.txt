# Morgan Reveals Philosophy In 'Sparkenbroke'
## 
### 
"SPARKENBROKE," l»y Charles
Morgan.
"Sparkenbroke," latest -novel of
Charles Morgan's, is hi.s final con-
I tribution to a group of three phiio
| sophical novels. "The Fountain"
and "Portrait in a Mirror" are the
others. The essence of these books I
is the same, though the thought is
extended and enlarged in the life of
j Lord Sparkenhroke.
The story is of Piers Tenniel, i
I.ord Sparkenhroke, English poet
and story-teller, anil his discovery
I of the three ccstacies of life—con
templation, supreme love, and
death. Just as Ivcats wrote, "I
am certain of nothing but of the
| holiness of the Heart's ailection,
and of the truth of Imagination."
Sparkenhroke finds that he can
find fulfillment of life only in his
flights of imagination, and in Mary,
who loves and is loved by two men
ol utterly different natures—him-
J self and George Hardy, steadfast
in his affections ancj, character.
But Sparkenhroke, who half dwells
in a world apart, finds, as he al- i
| ways knew lie should, that only in
j death is there physical release and
! an escape from his spiritual impris
! onment.

The story is not a morbid one, nor
especially wierd, but its appeal
comes from the nearness of the read
ers and characters in the story.
Morgan, in attaining this end, uses
the trick of revealing thoughts as
they run through the minds of the
characters—stream consciousness.
Although the story lags in places,
the action s so constructed as to
keep the reader forever wonder
ing how the poet-story-teller will
reach his goal, the peace of spirit,
, of which he had only a glimpse
when a child.
