# I. Q. Before Beauty, Say Senior Gents

### Florence Brown 
; Stanford seniors apparently have
very definite ideas on what a really
| popular girl is like, and they dun't
j rate beauty first, either! "Get down
to the fundamental things," said one
senior when he was asked upon
what ho would base his vote in the
approaching senior woman popu
larity contest.
"Poisonality" had it all over
I beauty and even brains in the opin
( ion of nearly all the seniors ques
tioned. Monk Moscrip said, "The
really popular girl has an outstand
ing personality and is active in cam
pus afTairs, but not in too many
activities. She must be a nice girl,
that is, 'have a lot on the ball ' Al
! though she doesn't have to be beau
tiful, she shouldn't be dumb either."
Jim Ludlam, election board chair
man, said, "She will have to enter
into activities, but not too many.
She should be good-looking and a
I good dresser. She ought to be seen

in (he right places (?) will) the right
people (?)." (The punctuation wa.s
insisted upon by the speaker.)
Bob Jones, Daily business man
ager, differed somewhat from the
others in saying that she ought to be
"plenty good looking." He also said,
"The popular girl should be smart,
that is she l should know how much
two and two are. She ought to be in
activities. She should dress well and
have a lot of poise."
Marvie Kahn, last year's student
body president, gave the same ad
vice to this year's seniors when he
said. "The popular girl should have
a boy friend in the home town and
forget to mention it to campus men.
Office-holding doesn't particularly
denote popularity, as some of the
most popular women are not in of
fice. You shouldn't make the basis
of judgment the number of times a
woman goes out during the week,
either. The most important things
are intelligence and depth."
