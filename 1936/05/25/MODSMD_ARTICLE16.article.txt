# Wilbur Receives A.S.U. Protest
## No Action Will Be Taken, Says Campus Head 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur has j
no objections to the objecting of the j
A.S.U., he indicated to the Daily last j
night.
The American Student Union in |
its meeting last Thursday night had '
protested the attendance of Dr. Rob
ert Eckles Swain, chemistry depart- j
mcnt head on sabbatical leave in
Europe this year, at the "550 th an- !
niversary festival" of Heidelberg
University.
When questioned, Dr. Wilbur
said: "That is all right. Let them
object." But when he was asked if j
lie thought their objections would J
do any good, he answered, "No." I
Protest to Stanford's participation 1
in the Heidelberg festival was based
on the withdrawal of all important i
English universities from the cole- |
bration, and about half of the uni- 1
versities in eastern United States.
Members pointed to the fact that \
a recent investigation revealed that !
this was really Heidelberg's 449 th i
anniversary, and that Hitler had de- I
cided to hold the festival this year to
cash in on Olympic Games publicity
for the support of his domestic
policies.
