# Dorsey Band Wins Ovation
## Taylor Says Junior Prom Made All Expenses 
### 
Thirteen musicians invaded the
I campus Friday night, established
j themselves in the Pavilion, and after
four hours of work left approxi
i mately 800 dancers with a lasting
! impression of the word "swing."
The musicians constituted the
membership of Jimmy Dorsey's or-
I chestra; the occasion was the annual
Junior Prom.
With the playing of such selections
as "Christopher Columbus," "Hon
eysuckle Rose," and "Old Man Har-
I lem," the band drew down applause
, which might well set a precedent for
! enthusiasm at Stanford dances.
1 Featured in the latter number was
I Ray McKinley, whose combined
showmanship and drums technique
brought a majority of the crowd
flocking to the platform.
Another selection which met with
immediate approval was a swing
arrangement of "Come Join the
I Band," one of Stanford's standard
tunes.
As an added attraction, Shirley
Jones, singing star of the Big Game
I Gaieties and of the forthcoming pro
| duct ion, "Three Sheets to the Wind,"
j gave vocal expression to the or
j chestra's arrangement of "Goody
j Goody." The appearance of Kay
I Weber, featured singer with Dor
j sey's aggregation, was prohibited by
i a University regulation.
Despite increased expenditures
' resulting from the engagement of
; the band, Chairman Frank Taylor
! yesterday declared that the Prom
j successfully met its financial obliga
tions.
