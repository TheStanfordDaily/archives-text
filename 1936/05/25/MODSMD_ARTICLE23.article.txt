# Buttermilk, Beer On Par In College Food Hate List
## 
### 
Beer, gin, and whiskey—the boys i
down the highway probably don't
know—are on Pacific Coast college
■ students' "hate" list. They dislike
J these beverages almost as much as
1 buttermilk.
This fact was brought out in a sur
j vey made by Dr. Calvin Hall, Uni-
I versity of Oregon psychologist, who
canvassed 440 Oregon and California
college students to discover their
tastes in food and drink.
Women, Dr. Hall* also learned,
! don't know very much about brandy,
| gin. and whiskey. He asked them
i the food and drinks most unfamiliar
| —these three "refreshments" headed
j their lists. Most of the men, how
ever, were quite familiar with the
j alcoholic drinks.
Like Ice Cream
Ice cream, beef steak, and choco
l late were favorites of the whole
! group—only two-tenths of one per I
. cent "nixed" them.
The students weren't a bit snooty

about their "gripes." They disliked
the expensive and more exclusive
foods as much as the ordinary ones.
Anchovies, corn beef, tongue, caviar,
duck, figs, leek, and sweet breads
were prominent on the "hate" lists.
Spinach and oatmeal, surprisingly
enough, were well liked. Ninety-two
per cent ate and enjoyed both.
Women Particular
For every eight, foods that men
don't like, women have ten. Beer,
for instance, was disliked by women
much more than by men. There
were no foods to which men have
more of an aversion than do women.
Most "hate" lists included, in or
der, these "foods": buttermilk, kid
neys, beer, gin, whiskey, liver, pars
nips, hominy, and tongue.
Dr. Hall as a final observation said
that California students were not
more particular than Oregon stu
dents. Both have about the same
knowledge of the culinary arts, he
said.
