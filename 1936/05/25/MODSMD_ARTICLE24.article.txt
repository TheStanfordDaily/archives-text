(Editor's Note: This is the first
of a series of articles presenting
a picture and interpretation of the
advancement made by Stanford
during the past year. Today's ar- ]
tide concerns the Farm's new J
building program.)

Dreams for a Stanford, recognized j
for leadership in the arts and a Farm j
green and flowering the year 'round, j
began to crystalize this year as Uni
versity officials, spokesmanned by 1
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, out
line a building expenditure program
of nearly a million and a half dol
lars.
* * *
A five-point art program, long ,
just a secret hope of Comptroller
Roth, was revealed last winter
when the two central units of this
program, the Memorial Theater
and the Amphitheater, reached
the ground-breaking stage.
Of the five structures to consti
tute Stanford's art center, one, the
Art. Gallery, is a reality today. Next j
year should see the completion of j
both the Memorial Theater and the j
Amphitheater. The final propects I
of the program, a Graphic Arts and
Music Building, have yet to reach j
the drawing boards. These are to be :
built on either side of the Memorial
Theater.
This year's construction makes al
most inevitable a future Stanford
school of the theater, taking dra
matics largely out of the hands of
the student Ex Committee and plac
ing it under supervised University
instruction.
Of the $583,000 estimated cost of
the theater, $167,000 is on hand in
a fund commemorating Stanford's |
war dead. To this has been added
$10,000 from the A.S.S.U. and dona
tions from private individuals, bring
ing the cash-on-hand figure to near
ly $200,000.
Borrow for Theater
The University will borrow the
remainder of the theater costs from j
its endowment fund, the money to
be repaid with 5% interest within an |
estimated 20 years. Seventy-five!
per cent of the Union's profits and i
one dollar per quarter from each ;
student tuition will go toward this
repayment.
The new theater will continue the j
migration of between-class gossip;
groups towards off-Quad location.!
Pioneer roughs gathered in the inner j
Quad for their bull-sessioning. With
the building of the present auditor
ium, other outer-Quad buildings,
and, later, the Library, studentsi
tended more and more to congregate '
on the outer-Quad. In the future, !
with lecture classes meeting in the
Theater's auditorium and other)
groups in the Theater's seven class- |
rooms, bull-sessioning spots will '
spring up between the English cor- j
tier and the new structure.

Gets Free Dirt
The idea of the Amphitheater or- :
iginated when the University re
ceived an offer of free dirt which ,
seemed too good to resist. Following >
on the heels of this, came another
gift for the project, $$35,000 from !
Mr. Howard Frost of Los Angeles.
Approximately $40,000 more will be
needed to finance the project.
When completed, the amphitheater I
will resemble as closely as possible |
a natural mountain glen. The entire I
Amphitheater, including the stage, '
will be surfaced with sod and sur- '
rounded by a grove of trees.
K« * *
Architects are currently plan- I
ning the reconstruction of the pre
sent auditorium as a classroom
building, Most of the additional
floor-space will he awarded to the
Business School. Comptroller
Roth estimates rebuilding costs
at $100,000. Construction awaits 1
the completion of the Memorial \
Theater and the raising of nec
essary funds.

Possibility of the Farm's someday
turning its pastures into gardens and
green lawn received impetus one
day last month. Bear Gulch Water
Company waived rights of San
Francisquito Creek in order that the
University might dam an artificial
lake with three times the combined
capacities of Felt, Lagunita, and
Searsville, and completely control
campus drinking and garden water
for the first time.
Output Calculated
Annual output of the proposed
project is estimated at over three
billion gallons. Of this Bear Gulch
Water Company would buy not less
than 7 per cent, which would net
(he University a 3.85 per cent aver
ago yearly return on its half million
dollar investment. Available for pur
chase by other interests would be
12 per cent of the supply, the Uni
versity utilizing the remainder.
Thus while giving Stanfordites a
year-round swimming hole of sonic
200 acres, the new lajte would make
large-scale landscape gardening not
only possible but probable. Au
thorities have until January, 1938, to
determine University action.
