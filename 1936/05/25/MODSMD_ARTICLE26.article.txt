# Only 170 Quads Remain On Sale
## Books Will Be Distributed To Students June 1 
### 
As a result of the sales campaign
for the 1935-36 Quad, there are
just 170 books available for student
purchase out of the 1700 put up for
sale at the beginning of the year.
Quads are to be distributed Monday,
June 1, from the committee rooms
in the old Union.
After this number has been either
reserved by the part payment of
$3.17 with the rest to be paid when
the book is called for, or by com
plete payment, there will be no more
books available. The remaining
number may be purchased at the
Quad office or at the Associated
Student offices.
Chuck Fontius, business manager,
urges all those who wish to have
their names placed on their books to
give notice by Tuesday of this week.
Any orders taken for this purpose
after this date will be subject to
delay.
At this same time last year there
were over 200 books left, yet thex-e
were many students who did not get
to buy a Quad. With the number
left this year, Don Hanson, editor,
predicts a complete sellout before
the books are distributed.
