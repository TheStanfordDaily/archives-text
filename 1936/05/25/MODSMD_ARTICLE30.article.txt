# Stanford Has Best Student Control-Gros
## Survey Reveals Salaries High for Paid Student Office Holders Here 
### John Rice 
That Stanford has a greater de
gree of student control than any
university in the United States is
the major conclusion to be drawn
from the answers to a questionnaire
sent by Student Manager Bob Gros
to 80 representative universities and
colleges in all parts of the United
States.
In an effort to get a true cross
section of the country, Gros asked
nine questions, each appropriately
subdivided, on the following lead
topics:
1. Is there a centralized banking
and accounting system for student
activities?
2. If so, who administers same—
student, manager, faculty, etc.?
3. Does the student body or the
university pay salaries of dramatics
and debate advisors?
4. How much is paid in salaries to
student officers?
System Organized
Although most of the universities
seemed to have some sort of a cen
tralized system, none was as highly
organized or centralized as Stan
ford's, under which it is mandatory
that student organizations deposit in
the central fund.
The administration of these sys
tems was, in the majority of cases,
in charge either of faculty members
or auditors. Chicago, Columbia,
Minnesota, and others have either a
dean of student affairs or a full
time director of student activities.
In all but three of the universities,
the salary of the dramatic and de
bate directors are paid by the uni
versity, while at Stanford, stated
Gros, the $175 per play which is the
salary of the dramatic director is
paid directly to the University by
the Dramatic Council, and is one of
the chief causes of student plays not
breaking even. The Stanford Debate
Coach is University salaried.
An answer to the annual agita
tion for a salary for the A.S.S.U.
president is shown by the question
naire—only one college paid such a
salary. Meanwhile, the salaries of
yearbook editor, humor magazine
editor, and manager, debate man
ager, dramatic manager, and music
manager at Stanford are excelled
by none.
Publications High
The salary of the newspaper man
ager and the yearbook manager are
eclipsed only by S.M.U., while the
newspaper editor gets a salary ex
celled by three colleges.
Considering these figures, Gros
said that Stanford pays too much to
publications and editors as compared
with a majority of American col
leges. Notable schools which pay
none are: Harvard, Columbia, Col
gate, Chicago, and Yale.
Gros concluded:
"The finds of this study tend to
emphasized the extent of student
control and lack of faculty inter
ference characteristic of Stanford
student organizations, our student
autonomy being a marked contrast
to the set-up of other schools, par
ticularly in the eastern states. I
regard this as a distinct tribute to
the attitudes of the University ad
ministration, which has given to the
students this authority.
Whether the students have met
the test by a thorough sense of re
sponsibility commensurate with this
authority will be covered in detail
in the student manager's annual re
port, which I am preparing now."

versity, while at Stanford, stated
Gros, the $175 per play which is the
salary of the dramatic director is
paid directly to the University by
the Dramatic Council, and is one of
the chief causes of student plays not
breaking even. The Stanford Debate
Coach is University salaried.
An answer to the annual agita
tion for a salary for the A.S.S.U.
president is shown by the question
naire—only one college paid such a
salary. Meanwhile, the salaries of
yearbook editor, humor magazine
editor, and manager, debate man
ager, dramatic manager, and music
manager at Stanford are excelled
by none.
Publications High
The salary of the newspaper man
ager and the yearbook manager are
eclipsed only by S.M.U., while the
newspaper editor gets a salary ex
celled by three colleges.
Considering these figures, Gros
said that Stanford pays too much to
publications and editors as compared
with a majority of American col
leges. Notable schools which pay
none are: Harvard, Columbia, Col
gate, Chicago, and Yale.
Gros concluded:
"The finds of this study tend to
emphasized the extent of student
control and lack of faculty inter
ference characteristic of Stanford
student organizations, our student
autonomy being a marked contrast
to the set-up of other schools, par
ticularly in the eastern states. I
regard this as a distinct tribute to
the attitudes of the University ad
ministration, which has given to the
students this authority.
Whether the students have met
the test by a thorough sense of re
sponsibility commensurate with this
authority will be covered in detail
in the student manager's annual re
port, which I am preparing now."
That Stanford has a greater de
gree of student control than any
university in the United States is
the major conclusion to be drawn
from the answers to a questionnaire
sent by Student Manager Bob Gros
to 80 representative universities and
colleges in all parts of the United
States.
In an effort to get a true cross
section of the country, Gros asked
nine questions, each appropriately
subdivided, on the following lead
topics:
1. Is there a centralized banking
and accounting system for student
activities?
2. If so, who administers same—
student, manager, faculty, etc.?
3. Does the student body or the
university pay salaries of dramatics
and debate advisors?
4. How much is paid in salaries to
student officers?
System Organized
Although most of the universities
seemed to have some sort of a cen
tralized system, none was as highly
organized or centralized as Stan
ford's, under which it is mandatory
that student organizations deposit in
the central fund.
The administration of these sys
tems was, in the majority of cases,
in charge either of faculty members
or auditors. Chicago, Columbia,
Minnesota, and others have either a
dean of student affairs or a full
time director of student activities.
In all but three of the universities,
the salary of the dramatic and de
bate directors are paid by the uni
versity, while at Stanford, stated
