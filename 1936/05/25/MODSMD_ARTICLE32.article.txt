# Gray Matter
## QUIET MORNING 
### Gray Creveling 
A quiet morning at the San Fran- !
cisco Central Emergency Hospital at
the Civic Center. A lady calls up
and tells of finding a bunch of with
ered flowers on her doorstep with a j
note attached, saying, "Leave 25 I
( eiits on your doorstep or you will !
lie murdered." The woman calls up !
the emergency hospital to give them |
fair warning. She expected to be i
murdered, even though the letter \
was written in a puerile scrawl.
Phone rings and it's information
of a man having fallen down an ele
vator shaft. The ambulance goes
chugging out, finally getting up
.speed enough to have an excuse for
using the siren. The drivers had to
use the old wagon, for the new one
had been side-swiped by a car and
was laid up for repairs. Inside the
ambulance, a reporter, who has been
given permission to ride by the
steward, jostles and bounces as the
ambulance tears out Sixth Street, i
The drivers pick up the worker.
And the ambulance returns, bully
ing traffic along the way with its
siren. At the hospital, the patient is
examined, has a broken leg, and
the doctor asks him to what hospital
he'd like to be sent, and then he's
hipped off.

A frightened mother calls up
reporting the experience of her
10-year-old daughter. The child
had gone to the corner drug store
tor something, and, as she emerged
from the pharmacy, a tall, long
nosed man had called to her,
"Come he-e-re little gurl." The
little girl did nothing of the kind
but ran screaming to her mother.
The morning was so quiet that
Ihe ambulance drivers and stewards .
were standing around enjoying the
.sun in the alley. Some cops hang i
around and get kidded about wood
piles. One big driver was washing ,
olf an ambulance parked near the |
hospital's entrance.
Another driver, a big, red haired |
chap, was unloading clean sheets j
and towels, and pillow cases from i
another ambulance. He had been in i
the French Foreign Legion, and the
men hanging around sunning them
selves told of the saber slash scar
that this fellow had across his back, j
He claims to have a gold vertebra
put in his back by the French gov- |
eminent after that particular wound |
had cracked his own vertebra. As f
all vertebra are close to the skin, a
gold vertebra, if it were really there
and if it was really made of gold, j
would show up under the skin and j
look brownish. "And sure enough, j

it's there," Frank deLosa, crack
News reporter, will tell you.
A couple of drivers and a reporter
hang around Dr. Bacigalupi, the
surgeon on duty, and the talk
switches from comments on the
. weather to a discussion of just
where those San Francisco cops got
I all their money. Yes. Just the way
you thought they got it. One pa
, trolman was reputed to have refused
| three promotions. He was smart,
i they said, because his beat was in a
j district where he could make about
j $2,000 a month for "protecting"
famous houses with the wrong kind
lof fame. If he took the promotion
he would have given up the beat to
either receive a new beat or a job at
headquarters with maybe a $50 raise.
He WAS smart. The reporter figured
! this particular cop for about $200,000.
| "He'll be the next one they'll inves
tigate," he said.

j district where he could make about
j $2,000 a month for "protecting"
famous houses with the wrong kind

he would have given up the beat to

A quiet morning at the San Fran- !
cisco Central Emergency Hospital at
the Civic Center. A lady calls up
and tells of finding a bunch of with
ered flowers on her doorstep with a j
note attached, saying, "Leave 25 I
( eiits on your doorstep or you will !
lie murdered." The woman calls up !
the emergency hospital to give them |
fair warning. She expected to be i
murdered, even though the letter \
was written in a puerile scrawl.
Phone rings and it's information
of a man having fallen down an ele
vator shaft. The ambulance goes
chugging out, finally getting up
.speed enough to have an excuse for
using the siren. The drivers had to
use the old wagon, for the new one
had been side-swiped by a car and
was laid up for repairs. Inside the
ambulance, a reporter, who has been
given permission to ride by the
steward, jostles and bounces as the
ambulance tears out Sixth Street, i
The drivers pick up the worker.
And the ambulance returns, bully
ing traffic along the way with its
siren. At the hospital, the patient is
examined, has a broken leg, and
the doctor asks him to what hospital
he'd like to be sent, and then he's
hipped off.

A frightened mother calls up
reporting the experience of her
10-year-old daughter. The child
had gone to the corner drug store
tor something, and, as she emerged
from the pharmacy, a tall, long
nosed man had called to her,
"Come he-e-re little gurl." The
little girl did nothing of the kind
but ran screaming to her mother.
The morning was so quiet that
Ihe ambulance drivers and stewards .
were standing around enjoying the
.sun in the alley. Some cops hang i
around and get kidded about wood
piles. One big driver was washing ,
olf an ambulance parked near the |
hospital's entrance.
Another driver, a big, red haired |
chap, was unloading clean sheets j
and towels, and pillow cases from i
another ambulance. He had been in i
the French Foreign Legion, and the
men hanging around sunning them
selves told of the saber slash scar
that this fellow had across his back, j
He claims to have a gold vertebra
put in his back by the French gov- |
eminent after that particular wound |
had cracked his own vertebra. As f
all vertebra are close to the skin, a
gold vertebra, if it were really there
and if it was really made of gold, j
would show up under the skin and j
look brownish. "And sure enough, j

it's there," Frank deLosa, crack
News reporter, will tell you.
A couple of drivers and a reporter
