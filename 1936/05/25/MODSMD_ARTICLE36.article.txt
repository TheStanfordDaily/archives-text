Theta Sigma Phi, national hon- j
orary women's journalistic sorority, I
initiated eleven women into the j
Stanford chapter at a ceremony held j
yesterday.
The initiates are: Dorothy Adams, j
Maxine Bartlett, Florence Brown,
Elaine Frisk, Suzanne Hammond,
Zoe Ann Hill, Margaret Loud, Ada
Leek, Joyce Smart, Sallie Taber, and
Annalee Whitmore.
Following the ceremony, which
was held at the home of Mrs. Carol
Green Wilson, the members elected
the following officers: president, j
Annalee Whitmore; vice-president,
Suzanne Hammond; secretary, Flor
ence Brown; treasurer, Margaret |
Loud; keeper of the archives, Sallie
Taber; and entertainment commit
tee head, Dorothy Adams.
relative (usually) has sworn out a
warrant. Their cells are lined with
white tile and there is only room for
a bed and a chair. The door to the
cell has an opening about four
inches square. Through this aperture
visitors can speak to the miserable !
incarcerates.
The insane one attracting the most
attention was a girl who was as
suring the attendants, '"The politi
cians and the foreigners are going to
sweep over this country like a plague
of locusts. And then we will have
seven years of famine. I know ■
whereof I speak. Believe me brother,:
I believe in exercising all my body, j
If I talk and talk loud I can ex- j
ercise my mouth and my lungs and j
my throat. The nurse has been
beating me. She's awful mean.
Halelujah, brother, I'm glad I'm this
way, I wouldn't want to be like all
the rest of you!"
As Frank deLosa talked to her,
he discovered that she had been [
a few months ago one of the girls j
who made sandwiches at a little
lunch counter in the entrance hall
of the busy News building.
"No wonder she went nuts," he
said to me as we walked out into the I
sun once again.
