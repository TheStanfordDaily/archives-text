# Swampum Sees Women In His Quad Crystal
## S.A.E. Monarchy Doomed By Technicalities 
### Solon O. Swampum 
As latest addition to the journal
istic "Royal Families" we submit
S.A.E.
Ray Hanson, A1 Sadler, Chuck
Fontius and again Fontius, and Don
Hanson held sway as editor or busi
ness manager almost continuously
for the last five years. But this year
shows a vague sign of abdication.
The Quad has two junior editors.
One, unfortunately, is 97 minus the
staggering sum of 50, a handicap
even for a junior editor and an
S.A.E. The other boasts the bawlout
total of 96 minus 19, more laudable
but still disqualifying for the edi
torship.
One S.A.E. McKenna, a soph, was
considered temporarily. But Swamp
um picks Ruth Barnes as the first
woman editor after today's elections.
The S.A.E.'s may lose out entirely,
even though the S.A.E.'s have a ma
jority on Publications Council with
Fontius, Browne, and Hanson, all
loyal brothers. Clinton Scott seems
to have the inside track for business
managership, against even those
odds.
Marjorie Dempsey (another wom
an!) will probably be managing edi
tor.
Minor scoop: Mary Belford will be
Women's Council chairman next
year. Elections haven't been held
yet. but we're sure, because Esther
Pelton,' only other eligible, is re
signing to take over the vice-presi
dency of A.S.S.U.
