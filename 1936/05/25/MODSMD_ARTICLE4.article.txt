POCATELLO, Idaho, May 24 (/P).
â€¢Veterans of Future Wars, formed
by university students, were sharply
attacked by E. L. Rayborn of Twin
Falls, newly elected Idaho depart
ment commander of the Disabled
American Veterans, at the State
convention today.
Commander Rayborn's voice broke
with emotion as he said he and his
comrades could "take the jibes of
the college students" but when "they
formed an auxiliary of Gold Star
Mothers of Future Wars, to go to
France and visit graves of sons not
yet born, they went too damned far."
