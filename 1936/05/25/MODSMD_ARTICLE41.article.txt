In the second quarter a 20-yard
pass play from Glenn Hamilton to
Luckett brought the ball within 30

brought Luckett to the 23-yard
mark, from which he kicked a well
aimed field goal with Peter Fay,
frosh halfback, holding the ball.
The fourth quarter opened with

20-yard pass over his left shoulder
and ran 46 yards through a well
covered field to the goal-line. Pete

sidelines of the practice field, smiled
collectively from beneath sun-beaten
brows as the seconds and fourths
gained yards, touchdowns, and field .

single first down and a zero on the

ters.
Store in Fourth Quarter
It was not until the fourth quar
ter, which lasted 25 minutes through
a well planned mistake of the self
appointed time-keeper, Tiny Thorn
hill, that the Reds pulled a few j
passes from their bag, and scored
three touchdowns.
Red Coach Ben Winkleman,
dr< ;ssed in a new spring suit and hat,
sat with head unbowed as Tom
Collins, one of Bobby Grayson's

three-yard line, from which four
line drives brought the Whites 6
