## INTERCOLLEGIATES ARE COMING 
### 
Well, these Pacific Coast Inter
collegiates, the ten-horse track meet j
that the Conference is initiating this j
year on Edwards Field at Berkeley,
are coming up this week-end, with
maybe a few trials Friday and the I
big doings Saturday afternoon.
The entry lists grace all kinds of
champions, with the four southern j
division schools, and Oregon, Oregon
State, Washington, and Washington :
State all sure competitors, and Mon- J
tana and Idaho very likely to send ]
small squads.
U.S.C. will have a tougher time
winning this meet than any they J
have entered this year, in that en- ,
tries a v e limited to 15 from each ;
university, and that their first-place
monopoly will be badly dented by j
some Northwest athletes who aren't
very well known down here, in addi- ;
tion to those who have already ,
scored on the Trojans in dual meets i
and such.
Stanford will undoubtedly go to
the post at odds nearly as short as j
Troy's, because of the great Cardinal
showing at Fresno Relays. Temple
ton's men are again working on j
Saturdays and Sundays, that old
symptom that Dink has definite, con
crete purposes in mind.
There will be plenty of chance for <
revenge, good marks, and other sue- 1
cess that caters to the trackman's !
heart.
