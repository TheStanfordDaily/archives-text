# TRUCK DELLINGER TAKES IT ON THE CHIN
## 
### 
With the word that Truck Del
linger, Card 440 star, has again
pulled that thigh muscle, a lump
comes to the throat of everyone
close to the Stanford track.
Dellinger, built more like a half
back than a trackman in the first
place, has worked his tail off for
three years, and has given every
ounce he had in every race he ran,
which is a record few trackmen can
affirm.
But in '34 and '35 he was behind
A1 Blackman, a bad place to be if
you want first place recognition.

And this year, sure to be his best
season, he caught a bad muscle pull
last February.
Recovered from that, Truck was
just catching up with the others and
hitting his bottom times when the
muscle went out again, probably
finishing his season.
