fect series of golf scores ever to be
played over the treacherous Uni
versity golf course, Spec Stewart
defeated Alan Hyman 7-5, to go into
the finals of the all-University Golf
Tournament. Hyman was even par
and Stewart was 6 under. Playing

of match play in the event Stewart
has been 15 strokes under par.
