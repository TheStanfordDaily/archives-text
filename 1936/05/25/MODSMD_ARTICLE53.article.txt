### 
Answers to a questionnaire on the extent of
student government sent out to 80 representa
tive colleges and universities by the student
manager are destined to bring more than the
satisfactory conclusion that Stanford has a stu
dent autonomy second to none.
If sufficient reason cannot be found why the
Farm should go farther than most other schools
in giving the students control of their activities
free from faculty supervision, or why student
salaries are on the highest levels, reform de
velopments are liable to ensue.
The student manager's report on the internal
financial workings of the various student or
ganization funds, which will be finished this
week, is bound to be a big determining factor
if any attempt is made to adjust student activi
ties according to their relative abilities to govern
themselves.
At present the likelihood of any sudden or
sweeping changes in student affairs seems
remote. Rumor has it that the student manager
is going to recommend several changes when
he presents his report to Ex Committee. In fact,
the report on the questionnaire issued yester

day seems to assure at least one recommenda- j
tion.
It seems that only three colleges which re- (
ported pay the editors of their school papers ;
more than is paid the editor of The Daily. Only
one student newspaper manager and one year- I
book manager get more than The Daily's and ;
the Quad's managers, while the salaries of the ■
Chappie editor and manager, the Quad editor, !
and the debate, drama, and music managers are !
unsurpassed so far as the student manager |
knows.
No comparisons of student managers' salaries ;
were made.
Undoubtedly cuts in publication executives' !
salaries will be advised in the forthcoming re- !
port.
The major conclusion that is made as a result j
of the questionnaire—the fact that Stanford stu- i
dents are given a freer hand than at most other
colleges—is an expression of the Administra- j
tion's confidence in student abilities. 1
If things are being done which tend to shake ■
that confidence, students owe it to themselves !
to amend their ways without being prompted
by the Administration.

the Quad's managers, while the salaries of the ■
Chappie editor and manager, the Quad editor, !
and the debate, drama, and music managers are !
unsurpassed so far as the student manager |
knows.
No comparisons of student managers' salaries ;
were made.
Undoubtedly cuts in publication executives' !
salaries will be advised in the forthcoming re- !
port.
The major conclusion that is made as a result j
of the questionnaire—the fact that Stanford stu- i
dents are given a freer hand than at most other
colleges—is an expression of the Administra- j
tion's confidence in student abilities. 1
If things are being done which tend to shake ■
that confidence, students owe it to themselves !
to amend their ways without being prompted
by the Administration.
