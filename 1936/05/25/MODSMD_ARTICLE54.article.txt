# Envoy at Heidelberg Would Not Be Educational Gesture

### 
The A.S.U. has objected to Stanford repre
sentation at the Heidelberg "550 th anniversary."
It has objected on the grounds that it was not
Heidelberg's festival but Hitler's. It objected
because Heidelberg had come under the thumb
of a political machine, and had lost caste as
cradle of truth and objectivity.
There is much to say in favor of the A.S.U.
stand.
Whether Heidelberg has or has not surren
dered to the Hitler machine in firing 44 faculty
members for racial reasons, is beside the point.
But what is to the point is that this so-called
"550 th anniversary" is purely a domestic politi
cal move of Hitler's to secure favorable publicity
for his Nazification of German higher educa
tion, and thus deal a blow at those resisting his
program within Heidelberg and other German
universities. The appearance of representatives
of leading American universities, whether or
not they make speeches against Hitler's death
blows to academic freedom, will be taken by
the German press to indicate approval of the
Hitler program.
The appearance of the head of Stanford's
chemistry department, Dr. Robert Eckles Swain,
for scientific research during the summer at
German universities is sufficient tribute to the
educational excellence of German Science and
Culture. His appearance in an official capacity
at the Heidelberg festival would be a tribute
to the denial of that Science and Culture.
