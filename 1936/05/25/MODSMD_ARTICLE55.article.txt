While the tile-manglers are cracking up the
familiar red tile of Stanford Quad roofs and sub
stituting an unholy and ungodly mottled yellow,
orange, and red combination, and while ad
ministrators are laying plans for summer im
provements in other physical equipment on
the Farm, the subject of campus roads is perti
nent and apropos.

The bend of Palm Drive near the Chem build
ing is a rolling, pitching, tossing series of geo
synclinal flexures. Portola Street—the road that j
passes by Branner on its way to Mayfield—is a
pock - marked, stuttering, jittery, amorphous j
mess. And Lasuen is an inverted soup bowl, !
which drains water and automobiles into the i
gutter with equal efficiency.
For the safety of life and limb, if not for calm
and comfort, for self-respect, if not for aesthetic j
motives, for the sake of the valuable human
spine, if not for the invaluable mind, it should
be done. However, not mottled yellow, orange,
and red, please.
