# It Probably Was Just a Mistake

Perhaps it was a mistake, perhaps it was in
tentional, but Stanford was afforded a singular
honor yesterday in one of San Francisco's met
ropolitan newspapers.
For several months the word "Staiiford" has
not appeared in the columns of any of the
world's largest chain of papers. But yesterday
the chief California link in the chain blazed forth
with a conspicuous headline in which were the
words: "Stanford Reds."
The fact that other stories in the same paper
about "this northern California University" stuck
to the routine synonyms seems to indicate that
the one break-away was a slip. But if it was
a slip, it ran Uue to form. For the few sensi
bilities that are perpetrated by the czar of the
above-mentioned chain corne so occasionally
they may all be slip-ups.
