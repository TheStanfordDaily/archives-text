## Thus Spake Zarathustra 
### 
(From the Michigan Daily)
When Zarathustra went one day upon the campus
he saw a man who carried his worldly belongings on
his shoulder and said: "Who are you and where are
you going?"
"I was a professor here," answered he who was
not a working mart, "but I am leaving because I can
make more money elsewhere."
Next Zarathustra spied a man who was carrying
many books on his back and said to him: "What books
are these that you carry on your back?"
"They are books I have written," answered the
bookish one.
"Ah," said Zarathustra, "Then you are a professor."
"No," replied he with the books, "I am an in
structor, although I have been here for 15 years, have
written 10 books, and have always thought for myself."
"You 1 advise to stop thinking for yourself and to
begin saying 'yes',"said Zarathustra.
When Zarathustra turned around he saw one who
was a student and the student was saying, "I hate
Nazis because they hate Jews."
It was now ten o'clock in the morning and Zara
thustra met a student who was in a great hurry and
said 1o him, "Why do you hurry so?"
"I am going over to that restaurant," replied the
hurried one.
"Do you go to the restaurant because you are
hungry?" asked Zarathustra.
"No," said the student, "I go to the restaurant be
cause all the people go there at ten o'clock, not be
cause I am hungry."
"Is that a good reason for going to a restaurant?"
asked Zarathustra. But the student had hurried out
of earshot.
Then did Zarathustra shake his head and once more
he climbed the mountain and went back to his cave
and his animals. "That is the last place on earth that
we shall find the Superman."
