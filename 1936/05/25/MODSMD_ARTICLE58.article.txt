If C. A. Beard, historical economist or economic
historian, or something, were to show in the flesh at
Stanford, faculty circles might go wild and throw a
tea even, but they would not take him down and
introduce him to the chairman of the Junior Prom.
This lack of graciousness on the part of the faculty
was not shared by the chairman of the Junior Prom,
who last week was quite thrilled at the prospect of
the appearance of one hysterical but not economical
musician.
This strolling minstrel was, according to American
folk tradition, the nation's number one organ grinder,
next to Benny Goodman, that is.
The chairman of the Prom was so excited about the
idea of having such a famous man on the campus,
that he took him down to introduce him to President
Wilbur. The President had heard of $3.75 Prom bids
and of a certain Miss Weber, but was not up on his
Variety, and perhaps did not realize that the famed
exponent of musical calisthenics was without. So he
explained to the dance chairman that he was busy.
Along about this lime of year the Hall boys have a
hard time catching up on their breakage fees. In
celebration of Stanford's victory over Southern Meth
odist, several Sequoia youths gathered together as
sorted pool halls, billiard cues, bottles, and incidental
pieces last Saturday night, and hurled them with great
vitality at assorted glass around the Hall. They were
quite disappointed to discover that the pool tables
would not go through the windows. When all was done
$60 worth of breakage fees were accounted for.
