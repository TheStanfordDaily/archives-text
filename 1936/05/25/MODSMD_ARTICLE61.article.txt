# Foreign Legion Film Resembles "Beau Geste"
## 
### 
If you think that you've seen
"UNDER TWO FLAGS" before, it
will just be vague memories of

"Beau Geste" lin
gering to haunt you.
The same sand
dunes, Arabs, and
star, Ronald Colman,
are in this picture as
in the old Foi'eign

Legion classics, but it's still good
stuff.
Colman is the Englishman who
joined the French Foreign Legion
to escape false charges and prison
walls. Claudette Colbert is the girl,
"Cigarette," who falls in love with
him, and for those love the Com
mandant, Victor McLaglen, attempts
to have Colman killed. Rosalind
Russell is the cool English lady who
wins Colman in the end. It is all
very romantic, thrilling, and con
ventional—or should I say, trite.
The desert photography, however,
deserves thumbs up as does the fine
directing of the battle scenes.
