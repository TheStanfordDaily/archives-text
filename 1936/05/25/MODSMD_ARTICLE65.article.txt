## WAS HE WORTH $900? 
### 
A gentleman came rolling up Palm |
j Drive last Friday evening in a bus.
i He brought with him 13 companions, :
: three trombones, four saxophones, |
j two trumpets, one

; guitar, one bass
j viol, and one set
|of drums. The
j whole party set
l tied down in the
! southeast end of
I the pavilion for
i 4 hours and 40
; 'minutes. For
> what they di d
| after they had set
; tied, they were
' paid $3.22 a min-
I ute — a total of

j $900.

1 To some people it is a most fla- 1
' grant example of extravagance to
[ pay such a sum to a mere dance or
j chestra. A certain few will shake i
I their heads and say that the stu
' dents who had to pay $3.75 for their
i junior prom bids were gyped, or |
! that the committee unjustly drained '
| the purses of the students to pay j
! for a "big name."
Jimmy Dorsey to this group is the
I Captain Kidd of the music world—if !
they will concede that the master of
swing is indeed a musician.
* * *
One of the most often heard ob
jections to extra-curricular costli- j
ness on the Farm is that "it is alien ,
to the Stanford spirit of democracy." j
(Evidently some indefinable con
notation has been attached to this
j phrase, for the hiring of an orches
| tra certainly hasn't much in com- I
j mon with a representative form of ;
j government.) The same reasons that
j led to the abolishment of the King
j Queen contest are applied to the ,
prom and the prices charged.

But to put a vote-race which j
! milks the local natives of $4,000 in I
I a pseudo popularity contest in a I
class with a legitimate dance for |
i which the warmest melody this side j

1 i stretching two or three points too

i j weren't merely looking at THE
- Jimmy Dorsey. And they weren't.

It may be just a fad, it may be !
some new development in the edu- '
cation of American youth, but the ,
effect that that music had on that !
crowd was like unto nothing ever j
seen here before. When "Come Join ]
the Band" is swung like the Prom j
crowd heard it swung, it can't be |
measured in terms of dollars, and j
cents.

Any final argument that Stanford ,
students can't afford such expensive !
entertainment is made to look rather j
weak simply by the numbers who j
were not only willing to pay the j

money, but to put on boiled shirt
on a torrid night in order to b
among those present.

The students didn't argue much o
the question, "Was he worth $!K><).
And as for the man himself, he cor
tainly didn't have any doubts abot
the spontaneous appreciation tlu
thundered up from the floor.
