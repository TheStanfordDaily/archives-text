# Alpha's 'Siggie' In Dog House; Takes Nap
## 
### 
Siggie's in the dog house.
Which is as it should be.
For Siggie is not only a thief, he
may be a tool of vicious gangsters,
according to campus Deputy Sher
iff George Burns.
It all started when Mrs. A. C.
Whitaker, wife of the econ depart
ment's famous "A.C." and not so
bad on statistics herself, missed
the morning cream from the Whit
taker doorstep at 544 Alvarado.
Today she caught the thief . . .
red-pawed. He's "Siggie," two
year-old collie Alpha Sig mascot.
Mrs. Whitaker found him grab
bing the bottles in his teeth and
tearing for the Alpha Sig house.
He's also charged with a Chi O
job.
Bail is set at 21 V\ pints of table
cream.
But what Burns wants to know
is: "Does Siggie drink cream him
self, or . . . ?"
