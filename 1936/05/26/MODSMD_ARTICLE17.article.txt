# Real Ole Scotch—And He's Royalty At That

### Alberta Carden 
"It's just plain ole blarney!" So, J
non-committantly Gardener Mac-
Kenzie, of the University nursery, j
| evaded the current rumor that he is j
a Scottish "count." On the other!
hand, he said, "Shurr, I'm a no- '
account!"
Admitting that one of his ancestors
I "knocked a golf ball 'round St. An
i drews with Mary, Queen o' Scots," j
the very lively Scotchman rolled his j
eyes and showed a letter to him from I
the British Royal Court, outlined in
the black bands to symbolize mourn- '
ing for the late king.
Calls Ilim 'Eddie'
"Shurr, I've met Eddie (King Ed- t
ward VIII). When I was ac-r-ross
the seas in La Guerre. My family I
live ovo-r-r there now—in the Cale- J
donia country. Do you know where j
that is? It's in the Land o' the
j Heather, the Land o' the Cakes,
I whe-r-re I was born. Read Jane
| Porter's 'Scottish Chiefs' some time," j
! lie advised, "and you'll see what a !
wonder-r-ful country it is.
"No, I'm not married. It didn't
take—just like vaccinations! (Ex
cuse the slang, but it conveys the
meanin'-all-the-quicker! Don't you
. think?) Shurr, I've traveled—wher
ever there's a barber's pole and three

brass balls, I've been. And when
I'm wanned up. I can talk in 28
languages and dialects. But. travel
early, gir-r-lie. Then you can en
joy it, and when you get old, there's
time enough to chase a golf ball!"
Wants To Help Others
Thus, interspersing his humor and
philosophy spasmodically, Gardener
MacKenzie kept up a steady stream
of talk for an hour. Proudly, he
stated that he was an "herbalist,"
and "when you've handled plants
and growing things all your life,
you can't help but get the finer
things out o' life. My motto," he
said, "is 'that-1 may benefit others.'
"I've got some gadgets and doo
hickies up in my room. My 'plaidies
and kilt' are still very well pre
served, just like I am. (You know,
I'm a lot older than I act!)"
Getting most of his early school
ing in Scotland, MacKenzie speaks
perfect English, spotted here and
there with German. French, Italian,
Turkish, and several other "lingoes"
I couldn't catch. But when he started
talking real Scotch dialect—it was
just, too much.
And whether everything else he
said is true or not, doesn't matter.
That is "the real McCoy," as he said
himself!

Getting most of his early school
ing in Scotland, MacKenzie speaks
perfect English, spotted here and
there with German. French, Italian,
Turkish, and several other "lingoes"
I couldn't catch. But when he started
talking real Scotch dialect—it was
just, too much.
And whether everything else he
said is true or not, doesn't matter.
That is "the real McCoy," as he said
himself!

Admitting that one of his ancestors
I "knocked a golf ball 'round St. An

the very lively Scotchman rolled his j
eyes and showed a letter to him from I
the British Royal Court, outlined in
the black bands to symbolize mourn- '
ing for the late king.
