B.A.C. has topped off perhaps the
most successful athletic season in
Farm history with dollars for in
tersectional jaunts, additional coach
es, and improved sports facilities.

When the 1936 model Red Tobog
gan starts its scheduled run, it will
find itself no longer in the weak,
loosely-knit conference of past
years, but instead in what is des
tined to become the nation's strong
est. Pacific Coast Conference repre
sentatives last winter created what is
actually an eight-school football
league, leaving Montana and Idaho
with schedule left-overs.
Each of the eight schools (U.S.C.,
Ucla, Cal, Oregon, 0.5.C., Washing
ton, W.S.C., and Stanford) will play
all of the other seven in round
robin fashion. Stanford, for the first
time in years, will journey north for
two contests.
When the Indians clash with the
Bears next November, the teams
will have met six identical confer
ence opponents. Under the new
eight-team set-up there will no
longer be question as to the myth
ical conference champion.
No future Coast crowns will be
captured through set-up schedules.
At the coming conference conclave
in Spokane on June 3 4 officials will
take action on recognizing for the
first time a Pacific Coast champion.

The Farm's 12 top-ranking bas
ketbaUers will spend their Christ
mas vacations next year toting
Stanford colors around the coun
try before making their drive for
a second conference championship.
Big unknown of the trip is just
who the Indians will play in
Gotham. Most probable guess be
fore schedule-release is N.Y.U.
At any rate, the game is consid
ered a big enough affair that east
ern officials stipulate that Stanford
play no other team within 300
miles of New York City.
Tour-planners themselves do not
yet know just how many schools
and games will be included on the
final itinerary.

Net figure on the much-talked-of
Rose Bowl profit was $55,000. Forty
thousand of this has been appropri
ated for new stadium seats. Re
placements are to be made this sum
mer on the 1935 stadium-addition
which closed the horseshoe. Re
maining $15,000 went toward the an
nual Branner debt payment.

Next major athletic expenditure
will probably go for half a track
stadium. After sinking $24,000 into
the soil of Angell Field this year,
some B.A.C. officials arc considering
putting some coin above ground on
at least one side of the field.
Old grads, who have the habit of
watching Farm sports rather care
fully, may provide incentive. Though
plans are still way in the offing,
Graduate Manager A1 Masters says
the completed stadium will have to
hold between 20 and 25 thousand
track-watchers.
Pleas for two other projects may
be stealing some of grandstand
backers' thunder. Coach John Bunn
wants a new basketball pavilion, and
if he keeps building mob-drawing
teams he'll probably get one. Wally
Brooke has been harping for an in
tramural field house so that all-
Farm contests may not be post
poned when it rains.
Indian gridmen will, after a
year's lay-off, return to scheduled
intcrscctional competition on next
November 28 against Columbia in
New York Cfty. The return Co
lumbia game will be played here
in '37. Graduate Manager Mas
ters has arranged a homc-and
home game schedule with Dart
mouth for '3S and '39. The foot
hall team will spend Christmas
vacation '37 in the Hawaiian Is
lands.

The Farm's green grid-varsity
will have eight tutors next fall,
whereas last year's veterans needed
only five. Coach Murray Cuddc
back, now in the Palo Alto Hospital,
will definitely not be in shape to
coach. New Indian mentos are Ben
Winkleman, Bob Grayson, Larry
Rouble, Frank Alustiza, and Wes
Muller. The past year saw Stanford
Ernie Nevers accept a position as
head coach at Lafayette.

When a seven-year drive for a
Pacific Coast Conference track meet
seemed about to reach its goal this
spring, major universities began
eyeing the 1.C.4-A. at Philadelphia
and so wrecking chances for the
probable best meet in the country.
But Troy and Stanford stood by
their original decisions and turned
their backs on inevitable eastern
publicity and glory so that track fans
may journey to Berkeley Saturday
to see the first Coast championships.

When San Jose State withdrew
from Far Western Conference this
year and refused to abide by Pacific
Coast Conference rules, Stanford
refused to okay a minor sports'
schedule with her. Reasons were
plain: San Jose was feeding her
athletes three meals a day all year
and throwing in free room besides.
After onlookers had criticized the
Farm rind the Farm was showing it
was standing by its guns, San Jose
made known its intention of mend
ing its ways.
(Tomorrow: Hays and Ilcndce
discuss the University's acadcmic
advancements during the current
year.)
