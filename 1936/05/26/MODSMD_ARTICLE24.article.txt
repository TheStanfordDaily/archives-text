# Fall Quarter Frosh 'Classes in Tradition' Approved By Wilbur
## New Students Will Have Four-day Schedule Of Lectures on Customs 
### Johnson Hill 
An expanded program of educa
tion in Stanford's traditions, ideals
and practices will be available to in
coming freshmen and transfer stu
dents next fall, according to Dean
Pierose, chairman of the student
committee in charge.
Present plans, which were given
official approval Saturday by Presi
dent Wilbur, provide for a four-day
schedule of assemblies and discus
sions, beginning Friday, September
25, three days before the freshman
registration. Faculty and student
leaders will co-operate in carrying
out the process, Pierose said.
To Arrange Details
Members of the committee will
confer with Dr. Wilbur again this
afternoon to arrange final details
and appoint representatives who
will return to the campus to assist
in the program of education.
Both Encina and Roble Halls will
be opened September 25, so that new
students may arrange their quarters
in advance of the usual time. In
addition, tentative plans include
opening of the B.A.C. on the same
day to afford more time for health
examinations.
Assembly Planned
At 8:30 o'clock Saturday morning,
September 26, an assembly will be
held, in which student leaders will
welcome freshmen and transfers to
the University. At 9 o'clock, those
who do not take the College Apti
tude Test will meet and confer with
their advisers.
Stanford's Indians will open their
1936 football season against Santa
Clara in the afternoon. The game
will be followed at 7:15 o'clock by a
smoker for men and a tea for wom
en students. Comptroller Almon E.
Roth and Dean Mary Yost will ad
dress the groups on the topic of
Honor Code principles.
Tour of Campus
The program for Sunday includes
services in the Chapel at 11 o'clock
and a tour of the campus at 2:30
in the afternoon. Later in the day a
barbecue picnic will be held for the
men, and another tea for the women.
All freshmen will be required to
register on Monday, after which
further meetings with advisers v/ill
be held.
Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock the
English reading test will be given,
and at 11 o'clock student speakers,
in the final assembly, will outline
Farm traditions for the benefit of
the new students.
Source of Movement
The movement to sponsor the pe
riod of education grew out of a
number of relative proposals offered
in a series of panels and discussions
on Honor Code enforcement. As a
result of widespread approval given
to the idea, the committee was ap
pointed to submit plans for ap
proval by the Administration.
Members of the committee include,
in addition to Pierose, Wally Brooke,
Mary Craig, Irvin Jorgcnsen, Carter
Kirven, Gordon Mallatratt, and Jean
Reynolds. Faculty representation is
maintained by D. C. Gilbert Wrenn,
director of vocational guidance.
