### Les Squires 
For all their ardent claims
The A.S.U. contains
The charred remains
Of many student leagues and groups.
Now whether those that now remain
are merely dupes
Of those with Marxist leanings
(Whose pretty prattle is now dis
guised as anti-f-ascist pleadings),
Or whether they, will intent guiles,
Have set the trap to catch those
"honey chiles"
That mama sends to college,
I wouldn't know.
The A.S.U. denies a red fixation,
Hut if that's true then it must be a
queer mutation,
For clear it is that those who bore it,
A:; well as those who organize and
labor for it,
Are Marxists tried and true.
It- mother was that hoary hag,
A; ed beyond time liki students ori
a jag,
The League of Industrial Democ
racy.
The side paternal seems a point in
question,
A dozen pinkish leagues were open
to suggestion;
And from this marriage pact unholy
Emerged that lovely little rolly
polly,
The A.S.U.
Now here's the point, it seems to me!
I ve no objection if a student longs
to be
A Russian red or yet a pink of other
color,
Or if he choose another tinge that's
duller.
Nor do I find it hard to state the
right
Of reds or pinks or blues to organ
ize and show their might;
Bui this I do insist—
No group in these, the years of
strife, should now exist
That doesn't show its proper clothes
And tries to li.'de its dirty toes
Beneath a cry of Peace and other
harmless platitudes.
So much is history—
In point of fact the average member
of the A.S.U.
Is no more red than me or you
(Or are you red!)
Their aims are surface aims,
A peaceful world and Jewish Olym
pic games;
Their purposes are fine and worthy,
Though now and then their man
ner's rather surly,
Nor do their average members
realize
The basic fabric scheme that under
lies
Those surface aims.
They voice their claims
To war less worlds, and seem to feel
They'll reach their ends with noth
ing else but zeal.
T he men who lead the A.S.U. know
more;
They realize that worlds must change
if they're to score,
And so they urge the average man
to need
The things they feel cannot be won
with speed
Unless the entire system's changed.
They know their heritage—
Write down on history's page—
The A.S.U. is Marxist born
And Marxist raised and Marxist
bred.
