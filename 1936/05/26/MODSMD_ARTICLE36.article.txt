of all around athletic merit.
Myers Utters Plea
Manager Dee Myers is very em
phatic in requesting that all par- i
ticipants wear tennis shoes. Track
spikes and bare feet are banned. >
Furthermore, Mr. Myers states that
each entrant must take part in
every event, or his score will not
count.
Frank Tremaine, Don Moulton, |
Dinty Moore, Bill Quade, Dan
Clark, and Grey Graveling will be j
officials.
With Kappa Sigma, Theta Chi, i
Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi the only j
fraternities to enter men so far, a i
heavy registration is expected from '
other brotherhoods today. A smat
tering of independents have also i
announced their intention of per- |
forming.
Versatility will be at a premium |
when the third annual intramural
decathlon starts at the stadium at 4 I
o'clock this afternoon. Thirty men
hiive signed up for the competition ;
so far, and new entries may register
at the field today.

ball throw for distance, and football ;
punt are billed to begin the pro
gram. A1 Hershey, Phil Levy, and
Alex Trompas are the respective rec
ord holders in these events.
Skill Is Stressed
Instituted (wo years ago by Wally
Brooke and Marvie Kahn, the dec- j
athlon competition is designed to I
test the natural ability and primary (
athletic skills of the individual
rather than skills resulting from ex- j
tensive training. Last year the team
championship went to the Theta Chi i
house, and Jay Todd took individual
honors.
Favorites this season are Alex |
Trompas, Lee Irelan, Howard Clark, i
and Dee Myers, all of whom placed
in lust year's decathlon.
More Action Tomorrow
Tomorrow the soccer kick for ac- |
curacy, fence climb for speed, 50-
yard dash, the football sled push i
will be held at the soccer field.
Finals are slated for Wednesday at
the gym, when the basketball free
throw, handball serve for distance,
and 50-yard swim will end the pro- .
gram.
These 10 events, picked by mem
bers of the Physical Education De- I
partment aided by the psychology
department, were selected from a
field of 100 as being most expressive |
of all around athletic merit.
