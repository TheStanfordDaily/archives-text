## WHAT'S WHAT IN FARM YACHTING 
### 
"Farm yachtsmen," "Intercol
legiate racing," "Stanford Sailing j
! Club" — perhaps you've picked up
those bits of current Farm talk about
some sort of a yacht racing organ
ization being organized, etc. And
perhaps you've been wondering just
what it's all about. Here's the dope,
from (he beginning.
About a month ago into Wally.
Brooke's office floated a letter, a let- !
| ter from Caltech's Frank Jewett, i
! Associated Student vice-prexy, out- I
lining plans for an Intercollegiate j
; Regatta to be held at San Diego j
during the week of June 14. Jewelt j
had contacted the southern yachts- I
men, had secured the use of eight
P.C. one-design sloops for the series. !
That started things.
Stanford had to have l'epresenta- j
I tion in that series. But to have an !
| officially recognized team, Stanford
| must first form a sailing club of some j
I kind, have it recognized by Ex Com
i mittee, and then choose the repre
; sentative four-man squad. Leroy
Wright, track manager and yachting !
j enthusiast, jumped in, and carried !
I the thing through that much red i
I tape.
1 With the club organized, next !

came the job of whipping out a
! crew from 20 some odd candidates,
all from different localities, all of
j different experience. Last Saturday
that job was done.
Five four-man crews were laid out
(usually fellows from the same
sailing region stuck together) and
j these five teams met in a series of
three races which were run off in
San Francisco bird boats, loaned by
beneficent City yachtsmen.
ONE-QUARTER POINT
DECIDED IT
And here should be inserted a vote
j of thanks to the bird boat owners
| who gave up a Saturday afternoon of
i sailing to help out the cause.
The regular system of scoring—
j one point for entering and one point
j for every boat defeated, plus Vi
; point to the winner—was used. And
I when it. was all over, thp wholr
' thing was decided by those quarter
| points given to the individual race
! winners. That was proof enough that
it was a successful elimination.
Maurie Ginn and his crew had
llVa (they had won 2 races to get
j points each time, and taken one
: last), Jack McLain was next with
j HV4 (one first, one second, and one
i fourth) and Gordy Frost trailed with
! 11 (two seconds, one third).

Thus went Stanford's first elim
ination yacht racing series and thus
was a crew chosen to carry the Red
at San Diego. —Frost
