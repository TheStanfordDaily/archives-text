# Hearst Breaks Down San Simeon Raises Ban
## 
### 
The strict ban which has kept the
word "Stanford" out of all Hearst
publications for the last two months
was lifted last Sunday by an official
order from Publisher William Ran
dolph Hearst.
For the first time since the latter
part of winter quarter the name of
the University appeared in San
Francisco Hearst papers Sunday.
Whether Stanford has been re
moved from the black list in other
sections of the country has not yet
been learned.
Graduation Blamed
The reason generally believed to
be the cause of the publisher's sud
den action is the imminence of com
mencement exercises which could
hardly be reported without men
tioning the name of the University.
Sunday the Hearstian San Francisco
Examiner devoted two full pages to
the story of the University of Cali
fornia's graduation exercises.
Hearst quietly placed Stanford on
his black-list last March, according
to well founded reports, when he
learned that Professor George S.
Counts of the Columbia University
School of Education was going to
lecture at Stanford this summer.
Used Black List
Professor Counts has openly de
nounced the publisher and Hearst
resorted to one of his favorite
weapons—black list—in an attempt
to strike back. Counts, Hearst pa
pers have charged, is liberal to the
point of radicalism in his teachings.

The two lectures which the Co
lumbia professor will deliver in the
School of Education's conference on
Curriculum and Guidance in July
are titled: "The Social Foundations
of Curriculum and Guidance," and
"The Significance of the Social
Studies Report of the American His
torical Association and the 1936
Yearbook of the Department of
Superintendence."
Eight-Week Ban
The eight-week ban on Stanford
has extended to name only. Sports
and general news from the campus
have been reported in the two bay
region Hearst papers, but invariably
synonyms for the actual name were
used.
Sport stories were sprinkled pro
fusely with "Indians," "Cards," and
"Palo Allans." Other news stories
referred to Stanford as a "Northern
California University," or as "The
University at Palo Alto."
East Embarrassed
This situation has proved embar
rassing to Hearst writers, especially
in the East where the words "Cards"
and "Indians" are usually connected
with baseball teams.
In establishing the ban, Hearst is
sued a blanket order to all of his 22
daily newspapers prohibiting the use
of the word "Stanford."
At no time has he communicated
with members of the Administration
in regard to the appearance of Pro
fessor Counts, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur said yesterday.

learned that Professor George S.
Counts of the Columbia University
School of Education was going to
lecture at Stanford this summer.
Used Black List
Professor Counts has openly de
nounced the publisher and Hearst
resorted to one of his favorite
weapons—black list—in an attempt
to strike back. Counts, Hearst pa
pers have charged, is liberal to the
point of radicalism in his teachings.

The two lectures which the Co
lumbia professor will deliver in the
School of Education's conference on
Curriculum and Guidance in July
are titled: "The Social Foundations
of Curriculum and Guidance," and
"The Significance of the Social
Studies Report of the American His
torical Association and the 1936
Yearbook of the Department of
Superintendence."
Eight-Week Ban
The eight-week ban on Stanford
has extended to name only. Sports
and general news from the campus
have been reported in the two bay
region Hearst papers, but invariably
synonyms for the actual name were
used.
Sport stories were sprinkled pro
fusely with "Indians," "Cards," and
"Palo Allans." Other news stories
referred to Stanford as a "Northern
California University," or as "The
University at Palo Alto."
East Embarrassed
This situation has proved embar
rassing to Hearst writers, especially
in the East where the words "Cards"
and "Indians" are usually connected
with baseball teams.
In establishing the ban, Hearst is
sued a blanket order to all of his 22
daily newspapers prohibiting the use
of the word "Stanford."
At no time has he communicated
with members of the Administration
in regard to the appearance of Pro
fessor Counts, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur said yesterday.
The strict ban which has kept the
word "Stanford" out of all Hearst
publications for the last two months
was lifted last Sunday by an official
order from Publisher William Ran
dolph Hearst.
For the first time since the latter
part of winter quarter the name of
the University appeared in San
Francisco Hearst papers Sunday.
Whether Stanford has been re
moved from the black list in other
sections of the country has not yet
been learned.
Graduation Blamed
The reason generally believed to
be the cause of the publisher's sud
den action is the imminence of com
mencement exercises which could
hardly be reported without men
tioning the name of the University.
Sunday the Hearstian San Francisco
Examiner devoted two full pages to
the story of the University of Cali
fornia's graduation exercises.
Hearst quietly placed Stanford on
his black-list last March, according
to well founded reports, when he
learned that Professor George S.
Counts of the Columbia University
School of Education was going to
lecture at Stanford this summer.
