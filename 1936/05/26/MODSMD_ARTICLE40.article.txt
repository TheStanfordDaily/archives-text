Seconds from Farm's
Mark in Practice Run

Bv Phil Kl;uilht

Edson Burrows, lanky sophomore
distance man of Dink Templeton's, 1
carved himself a deep nitch in the !
local Hall of Fame yesterday with a |
sensational practice 2-mile in 9:25.3, i
15 seconds under his previous best, !
and well under the Stanford record
of 9:35.2 set bv Hank Coe in 1928.

Burrows, who has always had
plenty of natural ability, had two
good weeks of practice behind him, i
and with Norm Bright in front of
him to set the pace, ran closer to
his ultimate capabilities than ever I
before. Bright finished in 9:23.8, 10
yards in front of Burrows. Bright, j

already a national track figure, has j
a bottom of 9:13.2 set last summer, j

Coach Templeton, meanwhile, j
listed his tentative 15 for Saturday's J
Pacific Coast Intercollegiates at Ber- j
keley. "We could win with Nimmo
in shape," said Dink, "but the boys
have eased a bit since Fresno. If
they perk up some this week, we j
may make a race of it. They might I
perk; Burrows did."

The 15 to be entered are: Ray j
Dean, Jim Kneubuhl, Captain Sam |
Klopstock, Jack Weiershauser, Bill \
McCurdy, Chuck Nimnto, Ray Ma- !
lott, Warren Dixon, Ed Burrows, j
Jim Reynolds, Phil Levy, Humbert j
Smith, Leo Madlem, Wally Hardin,
and Hugh Gribbin.
