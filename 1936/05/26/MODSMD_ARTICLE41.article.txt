# Few Gridmen Assured Posts
## Bill Paulman, Jim Coffis Only Certain Starters 
### 
As spring practice closes at Stan
ford, grid enthusiasts look forward
to the fall season when men who
have developed on the practice field
this quarter will have their first real
chance to prove predictions.
Next fall's teams and opening
line-ups will probably be chosen
from a non-string squad. Linemen
are especially even as to ability,
while at least two backfield posts
will be subject to changes.
Bill Paulman and Jimmy Coffis
can be sure of their usual positions.
Williams will be replaced often by
Glenn Hamilton, skillful kicker and
runner, or Jake Brie-ham, who makes
some beautiful left-handed passes
and seldom fails to gain. Earl If.oos
will be close behind Paulman at
quarterback.
Michigan golfers last week won
their fifth consecutive Big Ten title.
