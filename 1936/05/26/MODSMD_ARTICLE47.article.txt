## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Nothing Drastic Intended By Student Manager's Report---Just a Storm Warning 
### 
In applying finishing touches to his annual'
Student Manager's report, Bob Gros has indi
cated that he may make some blanket recom
mendations regarding student expenditures
which will startle some of the campus' leaders.
The nature of these recommendations was
not revealed, although they probably will be
for a general reduction in budgets, and possibly
for reduced salaries for some student officials.
Gros says he does not expect any drastic
actions to ensue from his report. However, he
warns that some reductions—where extrava
gances are apparent —would be a wise precau
tion.
The Student Organizations Fund has come in
the past few years to be a big business; many
thousands of dollars are annually credited and
debited in the A.S.S.U. books.
And Gros' warning is to the effect that, with
constantly increasing sums of money being
handled by the various student organizations,
a recent trend toward extravagance in many
groups must be curbed shortly, or this big busi
ness may be taken from the students and placed
back under closer faculty surveillance.
No major changes in the set-up are necessary
at present, but Gros apparently has more fore
sight than some of the organization managers,
when he suggests that they justify their own
expenditures "before one of the higher-ups
steps in and cleans them up for you."
