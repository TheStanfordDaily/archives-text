# Stanford Reinstated In the Sport Pages
## 
### 
For the first time in eight weeks the word
"Stanford" appeared Sunday in the columns of
San Francisco Hearst papers.
In March Stanford was black-listed because,
according to common belief, Professor George
S. Counts of Columbia University was to give
a lecture at Stanford during the summer.
Few students have noticed the lack of Stan
ford's name in the Hearst papers, but those who
have have merely chortled to think of the San
Simeon Lord, self-satisfied that he had at last
put Stanford on the black-list under the suppo
sition that the Farm would feel terribly, terribly
hurt.
Most certainly Stanford has not been dam
aged.
Egually certainly Hearst's 22 journalistic
prizes have suffered by the silly boycottâ€”their
writers have whiled away many hours thinking
up suitable synonyms to identify the Farm;
their editors have gritted their teeth over jibes
in opposition papers.
The roar of the San Simeon Lion has faded to
a purr.
