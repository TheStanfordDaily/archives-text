If the Pre-registration Period, which is defi
nitely given the breath of life according to an
announcement today, serves the function of

smoothing out the transition between prep
school and college it will have served its pur
pose.
Maladjustments made under the grab-bag of
registration day have dogged many a student
throughout the rest of his college course. If the
student is started off right under the new
plan, he may not have such a hard time coming
around to the point of being a useful citizen
on the campus.
Hope, however, that a Pre-reg Period would
be a cure-all for the ills of the present lack of
enthusiasm connected with a college education,
seems a bit advanced at this time, since we will
have to educate the new student to "starting
off right" in the realities of the actual campus
society.
To those people who are dissatisfied with the
present set-up of collegiate apathy and country
clubbing, the chance seems to be for a chipping
away at the existing society, rather than "edu
cating" the newcomers to a campus that does
not exist.
