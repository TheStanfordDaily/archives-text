## Promotion by Yardstick 
### 
(From The Daily Mini)
Quite a few years ago a president of the university
issued a statement to the effect that if teachers of
Illinois wanted promotion it would be wise for them
to do a considerable amount of research and he advised
them to write and write and write.
The statement brought a storm of argument. One
professor carried out quite a campaign in the pages
of The Daily Illini in which he argued for more empha
sis on teaching and aiding students in extra-curricular
activities.
It was duck soup for the Gridiron banquet of that
year and they made the most of it. Someone dressed
up like the president and had all the "big shot" pro
lessors appear before him with their writing for the
year and he measured them with a yard stick. Then
he promoted them according to the inches submitted.
Needless to say it was the professor who wrote so
many "letters to the editor" who came out on top.
« * • *
There is still a little too much emphasis placed
«>n the research side of the university. Too many
teachers who always have "closed sections" early in
registration remain instructors and assistant professors
year in and year out while some dried-up old fossil who
spends most of his time reading dusty tomes gets raised
in rank and pay.
There are many men in the University who give a
great deal more time to student affairs than they do
to minute investigations into some of the problems
of their field. Research is important and adds much to
the prestige of the university. But the argument
remains that those who achieve the respect and ad
miration of the students through their hard work in
problems dealing with the University as a whole are
just as valuable and just as deserving of promotion.
* * * *
There are just so many hours to a day, So much
of that time must be spent in class. Those who take
on added burdens such as student control boards,
senate committees and similar work have not as much
time free for scholarly treatises. Yet they find their
work just as hard and find that they are always faced
with more calls for help. Many of them will spend
nearly as much time in their "extra-curricular" activ
ities as they do in the class-room. Certainly they
deserve credit for that.
There needs to be more emphasis put on such
things and less on the amount of yardage gained by
professors in their writings.

It was duck soup for the Gridiron banquet of that
year and they made the most of it. Someone dressed
up like the president and had all the "big shot" pro
lessors appear before him with their writing for the
year and he measured them with a yard stick. Then
he promoted them according to the inches submitted.
Needless to say it was the professor who wrote so
many "letters to the editor" who came out on top.

There is still a little too much emphasis placed

teachers who always have "closed sections" early in
registration remain instructors and assistant professors
year in and year out while some dried-up old fossil who
spends most of his time reading dusty tomes gets raised
in rank and pay.
There are many men in the University who give a
great deal more time to student affairs than they do
to minute investigations into some of the problems
of their field. Research is important and adds much to
the prestige of the university. But the argument
remains that those who achieve the respect and ad
miration of the students through their hard work in
problems dealing with the University as a whole are
just as valuable and just as deserving of promotion.

There are just so many hours to a day, So much
of that time must be spent in class. Those who take
on added burdens such as student control boards,
senate committees and similar work have not as much
time free for scholarly treatises. Yet they find their
work just as hard and find that they are always faced
with more calls for help. Many of them will spend
nearly as much time in their "extra-curricular" activ
ities as they do in the class-room. Certainly they
deserve credit for that.
There needs to be more emphasis put on such
things and less on the amount of yardage gained by
professors in their writings.
(From The Daily Mini)
Quite a few years ago a president of the university
issued a statement to the effect that if teachers of
Illinois wanted promotion it would be wise for them
to do a considerable amount of research and he advised
them to write and write and write.
The statement brought a storm of argument. One
professor carried out quite a campaign in the pages
of The Daily Illini in which he argued for more empha
sis on teaching and aiding students in extra-curricular
activities.
