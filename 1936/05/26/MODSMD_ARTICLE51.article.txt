# A 						Little Schooling For the Feminine Bigwigs

### 
The supposition that success in an election
is assurance enough that a student officer is
fully prepared and capable of performing the
functions of his office is a theory that is rapidly
dying out.
Apparently in realization of this, the Leader
ship Institute for newly elected and appointed
women students was started last night. Spon
sors, sorority presidents, organization officials
as well as A.S.S.U. officers were called in to
hear talks on fundamental principles of lead
ership.
The outline of the Institute's program appears
too broad to be of much use in providing spe
cific training. The functions of a Roble sponsor,
for example, have little in common with those
of a woman member of Ex Committee. But the
present training in theory, if it proves to be of
suffioient value, can well lead to individual
training in each of the various categories of
women's activities.
While the women are pioneering in the extra
curricular education movement, men still rely
on actual experience to learn the reguisites of
leadership. The men, however, should not be
long in seeing the value of adopting the inno
vation of the women.
