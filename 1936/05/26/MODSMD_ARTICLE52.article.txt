A certain athlete, recently married, was left alone
in the bungalow one night not long ago, when his
wife was in the hospital with a cold.
About 3 o'clock in the morning he wtos rudely
awakened by the noise of somebody stumbling around
in the bathroom. Seeing a light through the door, the
hero reached for a 8.8. gun, strode over to the door,
pulled it open, cried: "Come out of there, you son
of-a bituminous biddlebumbum," was rather dis
turbed to see a Stanford woman brushing her teeth.
The Stanford woman was a friend of the wife, who
had encountered a lockout, and did not wish to enter
the sorority house and disturb the sisters at a late
hour. You know. You wouldn't either.
Now the reason that the athlete was disturbed was
primarily the loud and excessive language; secondarily,
that, not anticipating guests, he had slept without
any pajamas that evening. It's more healthful, you
know. You wouldn't either.
Another one of Our Hasher's pajama tales con
cerns a freshrrfan in Encina who is no athlete, and is
not married, but he's an Alpha Delt pledge. It seems
that this gentleman got tired of the slave morality of
sleeping on the Encina straw tick, and lit out for
Stanford's wild oats which Roth sows, and the men
burn up. He spread his sleeping bag out on a pile
of breakfast food by (he library. The sleep was very
peaceful, and the frosh liked the ticking of the straw
here much better than at Encina. However, it was such
a peaceful sleep that the freshman did not wake up in
time, and little girls walking over for their eight
o'clock in the BA.C. building saw a flashing glimpse
of Hygiene 150, dressed in pajamas and transporting
a roll of blankets hotfooting it for Encina.
