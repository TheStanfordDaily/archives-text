The Editor, Sir:
It was with a great deal of pleas
ure that I noted the editorial from
the Oregon Daily Emerald about
"Liberty's" Japanese invasion in to
day's "Daily." Why not suggest to
the Veterans of Future Wars that
they send a vote of thanks to the
editor and publisher of the Liberty
Magazine?
He has certainly given them an
excellent argument for the imme
diate passing of their bonus bill. Of
course they will be happy to know
that the money will not be an un
earned burden on future genera
tions.
All available indications show that
our physical - culturist friend will
furnish them with instant martial
action, upon his election to the
presidency of the United States.
