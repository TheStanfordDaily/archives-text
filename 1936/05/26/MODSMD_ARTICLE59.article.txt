## STANFORD'S BUSINESS LAB 
### 
Do Stanford student businessmen '
know their business? The question
answers itself: Stanford's business
men are students.
And as students they can't rea
sonably be expected to know any
one's business, including their own.

They make mis
takes now, they
have made them,
and they will
continue to make
them.
Nor can any
critic of their
manifest ineffi
ciency believe
their complete
control of A.S.S.U.
finances was
granted contin-

gent to perfect
management. Such a viewpoint must ;
automatically consider the faculty, \
who agreed to student control, as a
bunch of dimwits. It isn't likely !
that Stanford professors relinquished ;
control of the enormous yearly stu- !
dent budget with any delusions that i
by that act they also conferred ma- ;
ture business judgment on Stanford ;
students.
* * *
They knew when they turned over
the financial reins that students
couldn't administer the corporative I
bankroll with unfailing intelligence, j
that they would make costly mis
takes, that they would exaggerate
the economic value of certain lux
uries, comforts and features.
* * *
But because Stanford's student j
tycoons haven't been perfect is no !
valid reason for ousting them or j
modifying their control. If that rea- j
son is good today, then that reason
should have prohibited giving the j
control in the first place.
The inefficiency itself is no

ground. What compels a modifica- |
lion of the present complete student j
autonomy is the combination of that J
inefficiency with a lot of money.
♦ * *
For a given inefficiency, applied
to just a few thousand bucks as was ;
the case when students assumed |
control, is one thing. That same in- i
efficiency, applied to the present i
$125,000 A.S.S.U. budget, is another.
In the dear dead days when stu- ;
dent funds weren't an appreciable !
hunk of a million dollars, the waste !
of student money was considered an i
investment in education. Stanford's j
student businessmen had A.S.S.U. ;
offices as a laboratory, A.S.S.U. funds I
as experimental equipment. Be- ;
cause the cost was low, the invest- i
ment in training was profitable.
» * *
Today A.S.S.U. offices are still re- j
garded as a laboratory, but a labora- j
tory filled with equipment—enough
dollars to give a trained financier |
plenty of worry. To turn a student j
financier loose with $125,000 is like \
turning a general biology freshman j
loose in a million-dollar Rockefeller

Like so many things where money
is concerned, Stanford's student au
tonomy is today worse in degree
not in kind, from what it was six
or seven years ago.
It's that difference in degree thai
makes a change in student admin
istration imperative, whether wc
like it or not.
