# Study Of Latin Recommended
## Can Help Modern Student Harriman Contends 
### 
Although the study of Latin is not
a panacea for all our educational and
social ills, it has a role to play in
classrooms for which there is no
understudy, Dr. Raymond Davis
Harriman, professor of classics, told
the Stanford University radio pro
gram audience last night.
Latin Offers Much
In support of his contention, Dr.
Harriman pointed out that with the
present trend in language courses
of studying the civilization together
with its language, Latin can offer
much to an analysis of present so
cial values in view of the many con
tributions of Rome to our own so
ciety in art, philosophy, law, and
literature.
A second value of the study of
Latin lies in the fact that "to many
students the first real insight into
the linguistic structure, even of
their own language, has come
through the study of Latin."
Should Select Students
Only those students who give evi
dence of being able to benefit from
the .study of Latin should be per
mitted to study it. If it is required
or recommended for a given pro
fession, it should be studied and
taught in terms of proficiency and
not as so many units of credit.
To students interested in the study
of Latin, their first task should be to
determine, in view of their chosen
profession, just what objectives and
values they can derive from their
study of the language.
