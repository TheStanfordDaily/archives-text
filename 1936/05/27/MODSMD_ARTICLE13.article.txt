# Fred Clark Caps Career Friday Night
## 
### R. B. Jones 
When Fred Clark steps out onto ]
the stage in the Spring Musical Fri- i
day night, he sets an unequaled rec
ord in the realm of campus dra
matics. In every performance this i
year, 11 readings and 9 plays, he has |
had an important role. Not content
with starring in campus productions j
alone, he took a part in "Private ,
Lives" at Palo Alto's Community j
Playhouse.
Last summer Fred worked for
M.G.M. at their studios in Culver
City, and it was there that he picked
up the origifial baby-killing gagâ€” |
presented by him for the first time
on any stage in the Big Game Gaie
ties.
His taking to acting has been com
paratively recent owing to the fact |
that when, as a sophomore, he first !
tried out, he said to himself, "I see
Helvenston giving somebody hell,
and I'm not going to let anybody talk
to me like that!" His first part was
a small one in "Yellow Jack" during
his junior year.
Fred is a member of three dra- j
matic organizations on the campus, !
Rams Head, Sword and Sandals, and
Barnstormers and the only other
one. Masquers, is a girl's club.
In "Dark Tower" they were ex
perimenting with make-up. A nose
I which they could put on and take I

oil hurriedly for Clark's dual role
Rave them the most trouble. They
couldn't use putty as was usually
done because of the necessity for a
speedy removal; so they tried plastic
wood.
After the plastic had set on his
nose for an hour and a half for
moulding purposes, Fred tried to
tak" it off and so did half the cast.
The stuff finally came off,'' Fred
says, "but so did half of my nose."
