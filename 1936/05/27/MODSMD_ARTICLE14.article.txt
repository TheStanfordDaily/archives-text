Decisively proving that not all
educators are soaring off into other
worldly realms. Farm leaders for
mulated plans this year for organ
ized departments to cope with the !
two most-talked-of problems of to- j
day, labor and world diplomacy.
Stanford will pioneer in an un- I
charted, much - disputed field of
learning, University trustees de
cided last February in approving
plans for a Division of Industrial
Relations. Subsidiary to the Grad
uate School of Business, the new
division will be formally inaugu
rated next fall.
Eliel Heads Division
Maintaining its "Harvard-of-the-
West" position, the Farm will be
come the fust university west of the
Mississippi, third in the nation, to
offer instruction in this turbulent
field. Stanfordman Paul Eliel, since
1923 industrial relations chief for
San Francisco's Industrial Associa
tion, has been called to head the di
vision.
Little-known fact is that the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations will offer
no courses until next spring quarter,
probably not until the following fall.
Meanwhile, Professor Eliel will tour
the East, button-hole industrial ty
coons and labor big-wigs, gather in
formation and material for his in
fant school. Procter & Gamble and
Standard Oil, trail-blazers in labor
relations, call for important stops
on the Eliel itinerary.
Diplomacy to Be Studied
Diplomatically inclined Farmers
get their first opportunity for fol
lowing their chosen study on its
own merits alone, and in one instead
of four schools, next fall when the
University presents its curriculum
of International Relations under the
School of Social Sciences.
Full utilization of the Hoover War
Library will be the result. Its
abundance of rare information on
countries and policies from the Far
East to Western Europe and to Latin
America is a spur to the study that
no other college in the country can
match.
Whereas future foreign ministers
now at the Farm are compelled to
major in some division included in
(1) School of Social Sciences, (2)
Graduate School of Business, (3)
School of Law, (4) Food Research
Institute, devoting what spare time
they can to their real interests, i.e.,
International Relations, the centrali
zation of the subject in the one
school will make specialized study
possible.
Scope of the curriculum takes in
International Law and Organization,
International Economic Relations,
Diplomacy and Diplomatic History,
Psychology of International Rela
tions, Political Geography, and Co
lonial Policy.
New Journals Discussed
Prompted by Daily editorial agi
tation, President Wilbur last May
declared inevitable future Farm
journals in social science, medicine
engineering, and chemistry.
Made feasible by Stanford's pub
lishing facilities and versatile fac
ulty, proposed journals would be
patterned after the Yale Review.
Only hitch is the Farm's proverbial
money shortage.
Professors Retire
Classes clap the last time next
week for nine professors the Farm
will never forget. For eight of them
Father Time has chalked up his
B. r )lh mark and so they retire to the
emeritus list. Eastern duties claim
the services of the ninth.
Retiring are: Professor R. W.
Doane, biology; Rev. Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, chaplain and professor of
Biblical history; Dean Theodore
Jesse Hoover, engineering; Dr. Gui
do H. Marx, machine design; Dr.
H. W. Stuart, philosophy; and Dr.
Alonzo E. Taylor, director of Food
Research.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, coming
from Haverford College, will take
over the chaplain duties from the
Rev. Dr. Gardner and also empha
size philosophy of religion in the
study of Biblical history.
"Good Joe" Hinsey, professor of
anatomy and faculty athletic repre
sentative to Pacific Conference, ad
journs a most ambitious professorial
and extra-professorial career here
to asume the chairmanship of the
physiology department at Cornell
University Medical College in New
York City.

New Journals Discussed
Prompted by Daily editorial agi

declared inevitable future Farm
journals in social science, medicine
engineering, and chemistry.
Made feasible by Stanford's pub
lishing facilities and versatile fac
ulty, proposed journals would be
patterned after the Yale Review.
Only hitch is the Farm's proverbial
money shortage.
Professors Retire
Classes clap the last time next
week for nine professors the Farm
will never forget. For eight of them
Father Time has chalked up his
B. r )lh mark and so they retire to the
emeritus list. Eastern duties claim
the services of the ninth.
Retiring are: Professor R. W.
Doane, biology; Rev. Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, chaplain and professor of
Biblical history; Dean Theodore
Jesse Hoover, engineering; Dr. Gui
do H. Marx, machine design; Dr.
H. W. Stuart, philosophy; and Dr.
Alonzo E. Taylor, director of Food
Research.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, coming
from Haverford College, will take
over the chaplain duties from the
Rev. Dr. Gardner and also empha
size philosophy of religion in the
study of Biblical history.
"Good Joe" Hinsey, professor of
anatomy and faculty athletic repre
sentative to Pacific Conference, ad
journs a most ambitious professorial
and extra-professorial career here
to asume the chairmanship of the
physiology department at Cornell
University Medical College in New
York City.

Eliel Heads Division
Maintaining its "Harvard-of-the-
West" position, the Farm will be
come the fust university west of the
Mississippi, third in the nation, to
offer instruction in this turbulent
field. Stanfordman Paul Eliel, since
1923 industrial relations chief for
San Francisco's Industrial Associa
tion, has been called to head the di
vision.
Little-known fact is that the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations will offer
no courses until next spring quarter,
probably not until the following fall.
Meanwhile, Professor Eliel will tour
the East, button-hole industrial ty
coons and labor big-wigs, gather in
formation and material for his in
fant school. Procter & Gamble and
Standard Oil, trail-blazers in labor
relations, call for important stops
on the Eliel itinerary.
Diplomacy to Be Studied
Diplomatically inclined Farmers
get their first opportunity for fol
lowing their chosen study on its
own merits alone, and in one instead
of four schools, next fall when the
University presents its curriculum
of International Relations under the
School of Social Sciences.
Full utilization of the Hoover War
Library will be the result. Its
abundance of rare information on
countries and policies from the Far
East to Western Europe and to Latin
America is a spur to the study that
no other college in the country can
match.

Decisively proving that not all
educators are soaring off into other
worldly realms. Farm leaders for
mulated plans this year for organ
ized departments to cope with the !
two most-talked-of problems of to- j
day, labor and world diplomacy.
Stanford will pioneer in an un- I
charted, much - disputed field of
learning, University trustees de
cided last February in approving
plans for a Division of Industrial
Relations. Subsidiary to the Grad
uate School of Business, the new
division will be formally inaugu
rated next fall.
Eliel Heads Division
Maintaining its "Harvard-of-the-
West" position, the Farm will be
come the fust university west of the
Mississippi, third in the nation, to
offer instruction in this turbulent
field. Stanfordman Paul Eliel, since
1923 industrial relations chief for
San Francisco's Industrial Associa
tion, has been called to head the di
vision.
Little-known fact is that the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations will offer
no courses until next spring quarter,
probably not until the following fall.
Meanwhile, Professor Eliel will tour
the East, button-hole industrial ty
coons and labor big-wigs, gather in
formation and material for his in
fant school. Procter & Gamble and
Standard Oil, trail-blazers in labor
relations, call for important stops
on the Eliel itinerary.
Diplomacy to Be Studied
Diplomatically inclined Farmers
get their first opportunity for fol
lowing their chosen study on its
own merits alone, and in one instead
of four schools, next fall when the
University presents its curriculum
of International Relations under the
School of Social Sciences.
Full utilization of the Hoover War
Library will be the result. Its
abundance of rare information on
countries and policies from the Far
East to Western Europe and to Latin
America is a spur to the study that
no other college in the country can
match.
Whereas future foreign ministers
now at the Farm are compelled to
major in some division included in
(1) School of Social Sciences, (2)
Graduate School of Business, (3)
School of Law, (4) Food Research
Institute, devoting what spare time
they can to their real interests, i.e.,
International Relations, the centrali
zation of the subject in the one
school will make specialized study
possible.
Scope of the curriculum takes in
International Law and Organization,
International Economic Relations,
Diplomacy and Diplomatic History,
Psychology of International Rela
tions, Political Geography, and Co
lonial Policy.
New Journals Discussed
Prompted by Daily editorial agi
tation, President Wilbur last May
declared inevitable future Farm
journals in social science, medicine
engineering, and chemistry.
Made feasible by Stanford's pub
lishing facilities and versatile fac
ulty, proposed journals would be
patterned after the Yale Review.
Only hitch is the Farm's proverbial
money shortage.
Professors Retire
Classes clap the last time next
week for nine professors the Farm
will never forget. For eight of them
Father Time has chalked up his
B. r )lh mark and so they retire to the
emeritus list. Eastern duties claim
the services of the ninth.
Retiring are: Professor R. W.
Doane, biology; Rev. Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, chaplain and professor of
Biblical history; Dean Theodore
Jesse Hoover, engineering; Dr. Gui
do H. Marx, machine design; Dr.
H. W. Stuart, philosophy; and Dr.
Alonzo E. Taylor, director of Food
Research.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, coming
from Haverford College, will take
over the chaplain duties from the
Rev. Dr. Gardner and also empha
size philosophy of religion in the
study of Biblical history.
"Good Joe" Hinsey, professor of
anatomy and faculty athletic repre
sentative to Pacific Conference, ad
journs a most ambitious professorial
and extra-professorial career here
to asume the chairmanship of the
physiology department at Cornell
University Medical College in New
York City.
