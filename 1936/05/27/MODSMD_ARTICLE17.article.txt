Soph Meeting Canceled
The sophomore meeting scheduled
for tonight was called off yesterday
when the committee appointed to
discuss arrangements and program
decided that class representation
would be so weak as to make the
discussion a farce. Plans were made
for a meeting early next fall, when
studies will not be a vital considera
tion.
