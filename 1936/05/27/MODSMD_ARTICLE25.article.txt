# Students' Spring Fees Reduced $1 By Ex Committee
## Gros Suggests Change To Eliminate Surplus Of From $3000 to $4500 
### 
Students will pay $1 less each
spring quarter in the future, decided
Ex Committee last night.
"We're taking in from $3000 to
$4500 each year more than we can
possibly spend," declared Manager
Bob Gros, in making his annual
budget report.
Even with the reduction, which
amounts to 26 per cent of the A.S.
S.U. funds paid by students, Gros
anticipates a surplus next year of
over $1000. This will add to the sur
plus of $8000 already on hand, "suf
ficient to provide for any contin
gency," according to Gros.
Other budget recommendations
passed were a grant of $1000 to the
Student Aid Fund and establishment
of a $1000 appropriations fund for
Ex Committee.
"I should like to see more obscu
rities and loopholes in this budget,"
said Gib Ilolloway, disappointed at
not finding any.
Brooke, in closing the session,
turned over the gavel to President
elect Jim Reynolds. "Interested in
what he wants to put over and what
student government means — best
wishes," he concluded. "Brooke's
done a fine job," commented Rey
nolds. Ex Committee concurred in a
unanimous vote of thanks.
PRE - REGISTRATION Commit

blies and supervise mailing next
year, will consist of Chick Franich
as chairman, Don Pierose, Gib Hol
loway, Jim Reynolds, Mary Craig,

Barbara Kimball. Fifty dollars was
granted for expenses of the group.
JUDITH GOODHEART was ap
pointed as ex-officio member of
Women's Council, to serve until the
next quarter election caused by
Esther Pelton's resignation.
AN ELECTION BOARD party
was dinged. "Sounds like gravy
when you first consider it," said
Brooke. "Sounds like gravy when
you finally consider it," decided Ex
Committee.
CONCERT SERIES charter, nam
ing officers, salaries, and duties,
was approved. Betty Stearns as
manager, Carol Rundall as adver
tising manager, Virginia Smith as
office manager, and Gain John as
house manager were okayed.

and managing editorship, and pos
sible reorganization of the Chappie
set-up, bringing it more under A.S.
S.U. control.
CARDINAL appointments were
approved.
WOMEN'S CHORAL Society, now
the Glee Club, was recognized, "in
