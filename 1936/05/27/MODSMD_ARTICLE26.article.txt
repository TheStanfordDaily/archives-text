### Gray Creveling 
NO CELEBRATING
Just a year ago Monday four
brothers made newspaper headlines
in the U.S. Their name was Schech
ter and their suit contesting the le
gality of the NRA caused the repu
diation of the measure and put
Roosevelt's New Deal in a well.
A handful of reporters went to in
terview them this week and asked
them how they were going to cele
brate the first anniversary of their
triumph. But the newsmen got a
surprise.
"We're broke," said one of the
brothers. "We're not going to do
am celebrating. We spent $20,000
io lawyer's fees to press our case
and all we got out of it was a let
ter from the Liberty League and
some newspaper clippings. But
you can't turn them into cash.
Our poultry business has dropped
off to nothing."
"Do you think the NRA was a
pretty good thing, after all," popped
another reporter.
"I guess it wasn't as bad as we
thought. With better management it
might have done a lot of good."
"Well, are you going to vote for
Roosevelt, then," a reporter asked
them.
"We ain't sayin'," was the reply.
"Who is your father going to vote
for?" insisted the reporter.
"i guess Pa'll vote for Roosevelt,"
FOOLS IN LOVE
Americans are not generally sur
prised by the findings of the Con
gressional committee investigating
Political Doctor Townsend's pension
movement. All the revelations of
graft, incompetency, fraud, and stu
pidity have caused very little appre
hension.
The findings of the committee have
been more or less along the order
of what some men knew and many
men expected. But the most dis
arming thing of the who*le investiga
tion is the loyalty of Townsendites to
their leader as revealed by caravans,
petitions, telegrams of assurance
("We're back of you no matter
what!"), etc.
Like men in love, the thousands
of members of Townsend Clubs
all over the U.S. are blind. They
can see no fault with the plan or
with the Long Beach political
quack. He can do whatever he
pleases with their money. He can
light his cigars with it, as far as
they are concerned.
Dr. Townsend is daring the com
mittee to make him a martyr by jail
ing him. Well do Congressmen know
that if to his cries of "persecution"
and "inquisition" is added further
evidence of martyrdom by placing
the man in jail for contempt of Con
gress, his followers will grow more
numerous and more strong.
