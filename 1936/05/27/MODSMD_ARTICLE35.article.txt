# POPULARITY, INDEED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The smoke has barely cleared
away from the Masque Ball election,
and here the seniors are, starting
another contest. Popularity contest,
indeed! I don't mind a good, clean,
"democratic" contest, but I must
conless I have become disillusioned
as to the integrity of such elections.
I wi.sh to enter a plea to the Senior
Ball Committee to plea.se have a
fair contest. If they are going to
elect the most popular senior wom
an, I hope they see to it that they
really do, and no funny business
about politics or ballot-stuffing by
the Election Committee. Please, for
once:
Suspicious Junior
