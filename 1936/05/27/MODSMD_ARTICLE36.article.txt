The Editor, Sir:
Claiming a membership of three
million, the "Black Legion," a vig
ilante society national in scope, in
the name of religion and patriotism,
has left an appalling trail of slay
ings, floggings, and arson in its wake.
This mob terrorism, closely akin to
the secret Cheka police of Italy,
Germany, and Russia, is ominous in
portent. With the alleged purpose of
establishing a dictator, the members
of this outlaw organization take this
oath:
"In the name of God and the
devil, one to reward, the other to
punish, I pledge and swear by all
the powers of heaven and hell to
devote my life to the obedience of
my superiors, and that no danger or
peril shall deter me from executing
their orders."
In the face of such occurrences, so
alarming in their social import, how
can we continue our indifference to
any consideration of social problems,
especially when clear thinking on
these matters is so obviously to our
own interest.
