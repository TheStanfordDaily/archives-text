CARD-TROJANS
DUEL SATURDAY
With the Conference meet, set for
Saturday, looming as after all a very
selective event, the faction is calm
ing down about its rabid desire to
see Coast teams go to the 1.C.4-A.
and wondering how Stanford can
lick U.S.C. Saturday.
On the table here as usual before
meets, is the dope sheet. It prob
ably is not a very cogent one, be-
Riuse it includes only about five
Northwest men and practically no
Uclan and a surprising paucity of
Cal men.
Surprisingly enough it says
Stanford 51, S.C. 51. Ihat can't l»e
right, because Washington, Cal,
Ucla, Oregon, and everybody else
will not let the Cards and Troys
run away with so many points.
Much will depend on the way the
unknowns split the places.
But it should be a magnificent
battle between the two teams. Troy
is of course handicapped by its
limit to 15 entrants, while the Cards
can get along very nicely on the
limit.
In the distances it's all Stanford.
The Burrows-Dixon combination in
the two-mile and mile plus the
possible brilliance of Chuck Nimmo
if he wants to really run Saturday
could easily pile up 16 points in the
two races. Then Bill McCurdy, who
is just beginning to run after a big
high school career, will be dueling
with Bush of S.C. and Palmason of
Washington in a fast half mile.
IT'S ALL YOURS,
KLAUB MY BOY
Five minutes ago the edit board
came in with the appointments for
next year and Phil Klauber is the
lucky man to be the next spawts
ed.
Phil, as you might have gleaned
from his track articles all spring,
is another devotee of the stream
of consciousness school, likes apt
and pungent expressions, and
knows how to get the news, which
after all is what the paper is for.
An odd thing about Phil's ap
pointment is that it completes sqi! of
a vicious circle in sports editors,
running to home towns. A year ago
Mort D'Evelyn, from Piedmont, was
ed. Then Gordy Frost, from San
Diego; then me, from Piedmont
again; and now Klaub, who is also
San Diego. Anyway, good luck,
Phil. ' —Breed
