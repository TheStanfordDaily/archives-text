# Huge Set Built For '3 Sheets'
## Havana Hotel To Be Scene Of Spring Musical 
### 
Under the technical direction of
"Doc" Drew and Gene Callmon, the
stage set constructed for the spring
musical "Three Sheets to the
Wind," fo be presented Friday and
Saturday nights, is the largest and
most elaborate ever built on the
Stanford stage, according to Dra
matic Manager George Lindahl.
The setting of the play fc laid in a
hotel plaza on the outskirts of Ha
vana, and is designed to give a scenic
tropical effect. The stage itself is
constructed on two levels, which is a
distinct advantage to the actors on a
set of such large dimensions.
In order to bring out the setting
to the fullest extent, Phil Brown,
light technician, has increased the
lighting equipment and plans to use
various bright gelatins.
Tickets will be on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office for the remainder of
the week from 0 to 5 o'clock. Prices
are $1, 75 cents, and 50 cents, with
all seats reserved. Lindahl requests
that all reservations be called for,
since reserved tickets will go on
public sale if not called for before
5 o'clock Thursday.
