# Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily
## "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht" "Co-operation Through Criticism" Poppa Time Swings Around Another Cycle As the Daily Toddles On 
### 
Since the days when a Men's Council in
vestigation followed each election for an editor,
Daily staff members have prided themselves on
being one of the few campus electorates to
vote on ability rather than popularity.
Yesterday the whole staff sincerely attempted
to maintai nthis principle when it cast ballots
to select an editorial chief of Volume 90; but
it was a tough decision for the 24 voters to
make —choosing between Irvin Jorgensen and
John McClelland.
Jorgensen, better known as "Our Hasher,"
won, and will be a capable editor next year.
Either v/ay, however, the election would have
been based on merit; comparing "Jorgi" and
"Mac" on ability is like matching Will Rogers
and Walter Lippman —they just aren't compar
able; they're both tops, but they're different.
Jorgi's intimate knowledge of campus activi
ties. his strong convictions coupled with an
objective insight into the background and
fundamentals of Stanford organizations, and a
sincere interest in The Daily will make both his
news and editorial policies interesting, readable,
and constructive.
Helping him carry out these policies will be
a well-rounded, capable staff. Annalee Whit
more, first feminine managing editor in 18 years,
has been an indispensable part of The Daily's
writing and editing staff for three years. Extra
cufricular work on many committees and in
many activities, together with a rapid, accurate
judgment trained to sound journalism, make her
the ideal person to handle the administration
of The Daily's nev/s coverage.
The scientific attitude will be injected into

next volume's editorials by contributions from
Dick Hodgson, an engineering student who yes
terday was named as an associate editor.
This will be matched by a distinct metropoli
tan flavor in editorial compositions by the other
associate, Bob Eisenbach (San Francisco News
campus correspondent), who has alternated with
McClelland in turning out the Bull Session col
umn during the past year.
A competent staff of night editors is found in
Leonard Blaikie, the man who has arranged for
local pictures during the present volume; Dave
Botsford, who has admirably handled the job
of feature editor; Warren Breed, present sports
editor; Gordy Frost, incumbent night editor and
sports editor of the volume that saw Stanford
win a Rose Bowl title; Johnson Hill, A.P. desk
editor and an efficient newcomer to the staff;
Barbara Sweet, former feature editor, and pres
ent reviewer. Phil Bernheim, reviewer last fall
and Associated Press editor this volume, will be
an alternate night editor.
Two of the most capable and mature fresh
men that have worked for The Daily in some
time—Tim Hays and Hunter Hendee—will join
Barbara Rosenblatt as A.P. desk editors next
fall.

To Jorgi: Congratulations on your election
and the staff that should help you make Volume
90 the best yet.
To Mac: I know I speak for every member
of the staff in saying that you're one of the best
newspapermen, most conscientious, sincere
workers that have hit The Daily. Thanks for a
lot of co-operation and those three years of
what must appear to be unrewarded service.

ties. his strong convictions coupled with an
objective insight into the background and
fundamentals of Stanford organizations, and a
sincere interest in The Daily will make both his
news and editorial policies interesting, readable,
and constructive.
Helping him carry out these policies will be
a well-rounded, capable staff. Annalee Whit
more, first feminine managing editor in 18 years,
has been an indispensable part of The Daily's
writing and editing staff for three years. Extra
cufricular work on many committees and in
many activities, together with a rapid, accurate
judgment trained to sound journalism, make her
the ideal person to handle the administration
of The Daily's nev/s coverage.
The scientific attitude will be injected into

next volume's editorials by contributions from
Dick Hodgson, an engineering student who yes
terday was named as an associate editor.
This will be matched by a distinct metropoli
tan flavor in editorial compositions by the other
associate, Bob Eisenbach (San Francisco News
campus correspondent), who has alternated with
McClelland in turning out the Bull Session col
umn during the past year.
A competent staff of night editors is found in
Leonard Blaikie, the man who has arranged for
local pictures during the present volume; Dave
Botsford, who has admirably handled the job
of feature editor; Warren Breed, present sports
editor; Gordy Frost, incumbent night editor and
sports editor of the volume that saw Stanford
win a Rose Bowl title; Johnson Hill, A.P. desk
editor and an efficient newcomer to the staff;
Barbara Sweet, former feature editor, and pres
ent reviewer. Phil Bernheim, reviewer last fall
and Associated Press editor this volume, will be
an alternate night editor.
Two of the most capable and mature fresh
men that have worked for The Daily in some
time—Tim Hays and Hunter Hendee—will join
Barbara Rosenblatt as A.P. desk editors next
fall.

To Jorgi: Congratulations on your election
and the staff that should help you make Volume
90 the best yet.
To Mac: I know I speak for every member
of the staff in saying that you're one of the best
newspapermen, most conscientious, sincere
workers that have hit The Daily. Thanks for a
lot of co-operation and those three years of
what must appear to be unrewarded service.
Since the days when a Men's Council in
vestigation followed each election for an editor,
Daily staff members have prided themselves on
being one of the few campus electorates to
vote on ability rather than popularity.
Yesterday the whole staff sincerely attempted
to maintai nthis principle when it cast ballots
to select an editorial chief of Volume 90; but
it was a tough decision for the 24 voters to
make —choosing between Irvin Jorgensen and
John McClelland.
Jorgensen, better known as "Our Hasher,"
won, and will be a capable editor next year.
Either v/ay, however, the election would have
been based on merit; comparing "Jorgi" and
"Mac" on ability is like matching Will Rogers
and Walter Lippman —they just aren't compar
able; they're both tops, but they're different.
Jorgi's intimate knowledge of campus activi
ties. his strong convictions coupled with an
objective insight into the background and
fundamentals of Stanford organizations, and a
sincere interest in The Daily will make both his
news and editorial policies interesting, readable,
and constructive.
