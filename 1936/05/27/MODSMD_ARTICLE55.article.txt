# Revision of Fees Downward A Novel Idea, Good Gesture
## 
### 
Students, who have been accustomed to see
fees on the up and up in the past, will be
treated to a novel experience next spring quar
ter, when community fees drop a dollar.
This is the result of Ex Committee action last
night, when it was decided that the annual
surplus of 54,000 might just as well go back to
the long-suffering students, since they didn't
know quite what to do with it.
Under Bob Gros's plan, tuition and community
fees will be reduced from SI 15 to $114 every
spring quarter as a means of cutting down the
A.S.S.U. surplus.
For the three or four years since the pit of
A.S.S.U. depression, a surplus fund has been
built up, which probably will stand in excess of
$8,500 by the end of the fiscal encounter.
Figuring that students are already soaking
two or three dollars per quarter directly or in
directly into the New Theater, and that the thea
ter debt is amortized over a 20-year period,
which is a short enough time, it seemed inex
pedient to apply any more of the surplus onto
the theater project.
Benefits which will accrue from this action
will include a more caretul doling out of funds
by Ex Committee (perhaps), a saving to the
students of 1-115 th of their tuition, and most im
portant, perhaps, the feeling that somebody is
really getting interested in reducing expenses
in student government (perhaps).
