When Stanford Mothers pour tea and smile
at their annual garden party today, they won't
just be spending a pleasant afternoon.
Back of the affair is a typical mother's com
mon sense in providing care for sons and daugh
ters. Proceeds from the tea will go to support
the very necessary men's and women's rest
homes.

More often than not. students climb in be
tween rest homes' clean sheets, get meals and
attention, without thinking that someone has
to pay, that the dollar out of the student's pocket
only begins to cover costs on a day's care.
The balance is donated by a group of women
who have assumed an interest in student physi
cal well-being as the faculty has assumed an
interest in our mental fitness.
We can thank them by buying a ticket to
their tea, and meeting them in person.
