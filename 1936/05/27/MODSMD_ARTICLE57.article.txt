(From the Oklahoma Daily)
Judging from the current figures relative to higher
education in Germany, the Hitler regime is not doing
much to encourage learning in that country. The
figures show that in 1032 there were more than 250,000
students enrolled in the universities and colleges, hut
by 1935 the number h.id dropped to 182,000.
There are four clearly discernible reasons for this
decrease:
1. The complete elimination of Jews from univer
sity life as students or instructors.
2. The restrictions on the freedom of a university
existence caused by the political demands of Nazi
allegiance.
3. A change in the German conception of the value
of higher education.
4. Discouragement by the Nazis of higher learning
for women.
Through their intensely bitter campaigns based on
;i synthetic hatred, the Nazis have set allegiance to
the swastika as th« highest achievement of a good
Teuton. Thus intellectual learning has been shoved
back into a second fiddle position. Although some
of the Jewish professors were recognized as being
among the most brilliant men in the world, the cul
tural life of the country was sacrificed so that Heir
Hitler might have a platform on which he could brow
beat his way into power.
