## GIVE 'EM A SHOT IN THE ARM 
### 
Like a shot in the arm to a dying
man are tradition classes for Stan
ford frosh.
True, stimulants can keep any
thing alive, but it's a question j

whether the verb
al adrenalin Stan
ford will give its
expiring customs
will prolong the
life of something
worthy of this
world.
And it's a fur
ther question
whether our tra
ditions are better
artificially reju
jvenated into

I something they
are not, or tottering around on their
| last legs.
Many a good publicist has butched
on these fundamentals. They have
forgotten that something picturesque
i and unique is an invaluable asset
' while those close to it regard it as I
I commonplace, but fhat it's an ex- j
S pensive debit when those close to it i
become self-conscious.
What Californians Inc. has done to i
I San Francisco, Stanford may easily
| do to itself by frosh "tradition edu- :
| cation." Through their million-dol
| lar program of civic publicity, this I
booster organization has made Tele- I

graph Hill artists conscious of their
berets and moral aberrations, city
residents conscious of their fine res
taurants, Chinatown conscious of its
mystery and size.
Stanford's classes, while not pub
! licizing that part of Stanford's at
i mosphere which is traditions, could
i easily do much the same thing "as the
! well-intentioned Californians Inc.
It would send freshmen out on the
campus ready to break their necks
! observing all the social ways and
! means. They would "hello" with a
i vengeance, pajamarino like a Holly
wood Joe College, date and dance
I and not smoke on the Quad with of
. Tensive circumspection.
And they would be worried about
I whether they were fitting into the
picture, instead of making the pic
| ture themselves.
This result is as probable as it is
undesirable. It would be keeping
alive the dying, as San Francisco
for 30 years kept alive the wreck of
' its pre-fire charm and wickedness
with judicious magazine spreads.
If Stanford traditions are going the
; way of all old things, take fate's de
! cree and abide by it. Rest assured
that the new freshmen, unmindful
i of old traditions, will surely make
i new ones — ones perhaps more in
I keeping with the Stanford of 1936.
