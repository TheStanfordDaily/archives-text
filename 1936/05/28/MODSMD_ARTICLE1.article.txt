# Runners See Big Meet In Slow Motion
## Klopstock, Weiershauser, Burrows, Mallot Win Between – Acts Events 
### 
Just like? a Thornhill football
team, Dink Templeton's varsity
tracksters are now using movies in
their training schedule — all hands
attended slow motion pictures of the
Big Meet yesterday afternoon, in
Iheir penultimate preparatory work
out for the Intercollegiates at Ber
keley Saturday.
The pictures were a special help
to the field event men, showing their
form flaws, until someone thought of
running the weight events back
ward.
Weiershauser Docs 48.5
Between acts Jack Weiershauser
ran a 48.5 quarter in a handicap race
against Cranston. An hour before,
in another handicap race, Weier
shauser ran 50.2.
Everybody seemed to run double
trials yesterday—Captain Sam Klop
stock took a 14.6 high hurdle win
over San Mateo's Roy Kirkpatrick,
while Kirk took a 14.5 race from
Sam to even things.
Malott Beats McCurdy
Ray Mallott's 1:56.8 win over Mc-
Curdy, and Burrows' 4:23 mile a
couple of yards in front of Warren
Dixon were in the form of mild up
sets.
Work will ease off today, with the
news that Ken Priestly, in charge of
the Berkeley affair, will hold trials
in the sprints, hurdles, 440, shot,
discus, broad jump, and javelin Fri
day afternoon starting at 3 o'clock.
Several of these may become un
necessary, with entries from each of
the ten schools limited to 15 men.
Scoring 5-3-2-1
Scoring in all events, except the
400-meter hurdles exhibition, will
be 5-3-2-1, and records will be com
pared with those that stood at the
time of the last all-Conference meet
in 1927.
Wally Hardin and Chuck Nimmo
are questionable members of the
Stanford Fifteen—Hardin has his
javelin throwing arm all tied up,
while Nimmo's calf ligament is do
ing him no good. Chuck, however,
has been doing hard work this week
in hopes of getting back sufficient
condition to merit his entry.

Scoring 5-3-2-1
Scoring in all events, except the
400-meter hurdles exhibition, will
be 5-3-2-1, and records will be com

Wally Hardin and Chuck Nimmo
are questionable members of the
Stanford Fifteen—Hardin has his
javelin throwing arm all tied up,
while Nimmo's calf ligament is do
ing him no good. Chuck, however,

in hopes of getting back sufficient
condition to merit his entry.
Just like? a Thornhill football
team, Dink Templeton's varsity
tracksters are now using movies in
their training schedule — all hands
attended slow motion pictures of the
Big Meet yesterday afternoon, in
Iheir penultimate preparatory work
out for the Intercollegiates at Ber

to the field event men, showing their
form flaws, until someone thought of
running the weight events back

trials yesterday—Captain Sam Klop
stock took a 14.6 high hurdle win

Malott Beats McCurdy
Ray Mallott's 1:56.8 win over Mc-

discus, broad jump, and javelin Fri
day afternoon starting at 3 o'clock.
