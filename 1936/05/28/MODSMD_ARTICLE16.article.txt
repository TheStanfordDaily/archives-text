(Editor's Note: Today's article,
the fourth in a series on signifi
cant events at Stanford during the
past year, pictures developments
in student governments and activ
ities.)

Last week Bob Gros finished tab
ulating results of a poll question
ing 80 of the nation's big-name col
leges. Purpose of the poll, briefly,
was to determine strength of other
student governments, salaries of
other student officers.
Even A.S.S.U. Way-ups were a
little shocked to learn just how
lustily the winds of freedom are
blowing here at the Farm. Poll
showed conclusively that Stanford is
the most student-controlled campus
in the country today.
Still more astounding was the fact
that Farm pays the majority of its
publications heads more than any
other school. Salary differences
were so great that the only possible
explanation seemed to be this mat
ter of Farm's greater student control.
Rumor had it that President Wil
bur would clamp down on A.S.S.U.
in an effort to curtail this apparent
extravagance. That would mean a
stunning set-back for the winds of
freedom.
But here's the fact that went
unnoted: Farm student manage
ment was conducting its activities
on less money than other schools,
in spite of high salaries of student
officials.
This year every Stanfordite paid

$3.75 to support A.S.S.U. As a ran
dom example of comparable assess
j ments, every undergraduate at Ala
j bama paid $13 for student govern
ment activities. Only one of the 80
1 answered with a lower figure than
! the Farm's.
Questioned yesterday, President
Wilbur made clear he was harbor
ing no reform intentions. "Stu
dent control is steadily increasing,
not decreasing, and will continue
to do so as long as its does not
abuse its responsibilities. Change,
if and when it comes, will be evo
lutionary—not revolutionary."

With an eye to democracy and "a
| good time for the guy without the
j dough," Ex Committee, on Gros' rec
j ommendation, reduced A.S.S.U.'s in
i come 26 per cent, while curtailing
no student activities. Effect on A.S.
S.U.: a fund of $1000 to fall back
upon instead of an ever-increasing
I surplus; effect on Stanford rough:
: one less buck to pay next spring
J quarter at the cashier's counter.

Continuing his efforts to democra
tize the Farm, efficient Student

through Ex Committee abolishing

hat-check tipping at campus dances.

With the usual excitement and the
usual bad odor, the lid blew off
fraternity rushing last January, as it
seems to do about every fourth year.
: Sigma Chi, this year's bad boy, re
ceived a long-winded sentence,
about us toothless as a jelly-fish.
Underlying fact: strict fraternity
I rules had been but a camouflage for
; catch-as-cateh-can rushing, gener
ally accepted and recognized. En
j cina-boys regularly compared notes
|on off-campus parties of rival
i Greeks. As is the custom following
! such blow-offs, Rowmcn will enter
' next year's competition will be an
i entirely "revised" code of rules.

Last year's number one political
contribution was Brain Ridell's class
caucus. This year the idea was
snatched up by the hulls in self
defense, handed down to freshman
Boss Tweeds. Secret pre-caucuses,
last year's suspicion, became this
year's certainty.
j Ex Committee, idealistic for once,
appointed two committees to inves
i tigate "political machines." The
committees, sensibly, recommended
; no action. Ex Committee concurred.
| The year developed one significant
j axiom—a secret pre-caucus is no
I secret at all!

Tomorrow: Hays and - Ilendee
discuss probable significant devel
■ opments in the University next
year.
