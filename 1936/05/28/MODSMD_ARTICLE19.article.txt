# Professor McMurphy, Cactus Fan, Retires
## 
### 
"We've Hot more cacti over there I
in thiil little place than they've got j
out front in those famous gardens
I hey sing about!"
Cacti, it seems, are one of the i
chief hobbies of Professor James
McMurphy, who leaves the botany
department this year after 28 years
at Stanford. The "little place" is his
experimental garden, situated at the
northwest corner of the Quad in
the angle formed by Lomita Drive j
and %arsville Road.
Importance Crew
Begun by Professor McMurphy
before he went to Wisconsin to
teach in 1912-13, the experimental
garden has since assumed an im
portance far out of proportion to its
' size.
Here Professor McMurphy ha.->
I brought rare plants from all over

I America, and from such far-oIT
i places as New Zealand and China.
Here he has done much work with
plant diseases, allowing them to de
-1 velop on the specimens, many of
which he has collected for the pur
pose.
'Toadery' Maintained
The biology department has re
cently put in a number of new
concrete-lined pools in the garden,
| in some of which Dr. Twitty of the
j department keeps the salamanders
he uses for experimental purposes,
1 and in others frogs and smaller
forms of aquatic life. Physiology
students maintain a Well-stockcd
"toadery," according to Professor
McMurphy.
After his retirement, Professor
McMurphy plans to spend most of
his time studying new diseases and
adding to his nourishing gardens.
