# Enroll Specials In Holy Land
## British Families Leave Jaffa After Bombing 
### 
JERUSALEM, May 27 (/P).â€”Au
thorities enrolled special police and
watchmen to protect outlying Jew
ish district tonight from Arab bands,
keeping up an intermittent sniping
throughout the troubled holy land.
Jaffa, Mount Ebal, Mount Ca
naan, Hatikvah, Samaria, Esdraelon,
and Acre were all scenes of consid
erable firing. Bombs were thrown
at JafTa.
Disorders at Jaffa caused British
officials to remove their families
from that city, predominantly Arab.
They were taken to Haifa aboard a
warship and later moved to the all-
Jewish city of Tel Aviv.
More than five weeks of Disorders
and terrorism, inaugurated when
Arabs instituted a general strike
and civil disobedience campaign, as
sumed the aspect of open rebellion
in many parts of Palestine.
Nationalistic Arabs have demand
ed that British authorities stop both
Jewish immigration and the sale of
land I<> Jews. More than 50 lives
have been lost.
