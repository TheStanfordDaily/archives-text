In the final Interfraternity Coun
cil meeting of the year last night at
the Sigma Nu house, the official
pledge, enforcing the new rushing
rules which all next term's house
presidents are to sign, was pre
sented.
The pact, which is based on the
revised rushing rules, is short, per
taining to the enforcement of these
rules. "Realizing that this plan was
drawn up and approved by the re
spective fraternities of this campus
with their own welfare in view, we
as their respective presidents do
pledge ourselves to insure its strict
est obedience."
Presidents Responsible
In signing this pledge, the presi
dents put themselves on record as
being personally responsible for their
houses' actions during rushing.
Two faculty members for the In

confirmed by the Council. The men,
Professor Elmer D. Fagan and
Charles C. Scott, were appointed to
this position by Dr. Wilbur, follow
ing a recommendation of the Coun
cil.
