# Trustees Will Consider New Cut In Tuition
## Dollar Decrease in Tuition Would Be Covered By $4000 Annual Surplus 
### 
Whether or not the doliar per stu
dent will be reduced next spring
quarter, as recommended by Bob
Gros in his annual budget report,
will be uncertain until the Board of
Trustees meets next month, said Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday.
Gros, stating that the student body
had an annual surplus of from $3000
to $4500 more than they could use.
was backed by Ex Committee in
recommending that student fees be
reduced one dollar per year.
Unnecessary for Funds
"This amount is unnecessary for
student funds," said Gros. "It might
possibly be earmarked for special
use, but I think that the best plan
would be to discontinue collection."
A yearly surplus of approximately
$1000 would still accrue, he pointed
out.
Dr. Wilbur's approval was indi
cated by his statement that "As soon
as I get a report from the Associated
Students 1 shall submit it to the
Board of Trustees in their Juno
meeting. I think there will be no
difficulty about it."
$1000 Will Be Left
Gros pointed out that if next, year's
registration reaches this year's total,
at least $1000 will be left. "This
amount might possibly be greater,"
he said, "since the budget has been
made large enough to cover almost
any emergency."
The dollar will be eliminated per
manently if the Board of 'Irustees
approves the plan, making spring
tuition fees $114.
"Total budget for next year is
$9(565," explained Gros. "A surplus
of $8000 is already on hand, even
with the $10,000 contribution to the
new theater deducted. I see no rea
son why the student, body should
j continue adding over $3000 each year
j when enough is already available to
I meet any contingency."
