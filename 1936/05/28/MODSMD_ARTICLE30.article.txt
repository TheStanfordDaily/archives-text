# Swingin' The News

### Les Squires 
The Stanford year grows mighty !
thin,
As spring goes out and finals tumble
in- |
Jn these the final couplets of the year |
Wr'll list the tops and shed a parting j
tear.
A spring night dance along the Row,
A winter trip up higher to the snow, j
The warm snug voice of Shirley '
Jones
Enunciating Gordon's rhythmic j
tones,
The swinging lilt of Dorsey's band
And "Daily" picnics on the sand,
The loping gait of Tiny Thornhill's I
men
As Cal went down and took the j
count of ten,
The tall cool ones at l'Omelette,
Whose crepe suzettes are likely |
burning yet.
A few nice things we'll add from San |
Francisco,
Like songs by Pons and painting by !
Van Gogh,
The air of splendour at the Mark,
The bridges looming through the
dark,
The thumping jars of cable cars,
The crazy madness of the bars.
The way that big red team came
back
Instead of cracking at the smack
When Uclans won and Alustiza lost.
Those nights that Washington went I
down
As Luisetti went to town
And tossed and tossed and tossed. |
And just to toss a bouquet somewhat i
nearer
A Walter Winchell orchid to "Our I
Hasher."
This in regret— .
With lour years pounding at our '
backs
We snap the Stanford tag beneath !
our chin
And stumble out, looking wise,
To face a bunch of wiser guys
With pay checks rolling in.
We hear a lot of platitudes,
There spots of course for honest men,
We've learned for four years how to I
play
And how to fill up every day
With pleasure, gaiety, and " —say j
when."
And now we wonder what's in ]
store

And wonder why it never mattered
much before,
Eliminate all wastes!
Work hard and stick to jobs!
You'll rise young man—sad plati
tudes!
