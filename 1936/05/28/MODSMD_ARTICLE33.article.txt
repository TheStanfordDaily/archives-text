# Greater School Of Education Looms In Building Proposal
## Will Be Erected West Of Library; Gift of Dr. Elwood Cubberley 
### Johnson Hill 
Stanford's School of Education
will enjoy a place among the out
standing institutions of its type in
the country, if architects' plans, now
nearing completion, are approved for
a new building to be erected west of
the library.
If the project is undertaken, it will
stand as a gift of Dr. Elwood P.
Cubberley, professor emeritus and
former dean of the School of Edu
cation.
Cost Difficulty
Chief difficulty at present, accord
ing to Comptroller Almon E. Roth,
is the probability that the completed
plans will require an expenditure
greater than the $500,000 sum grant
ed by Dr. Cubberley. In such a case,
the plans would be altered to reduce
costs to the minimum.
The proposed structure would
range from two to three stories in
height, and would house class
rooms, offices, and a small auditor
ium for students and faculty mem
bers in the School of Education. It
would be erected in that half of the
block south of the Quad which is
now used as a parking lot.
Construction Date Indefinite
Dr. Cubberley's gift represents re
turns from numerous investments
and royalties from the sale of text
books and other works written since
his retirement from active duty sev
eral years ago.
No definite information was
available yesterday on the date
when construction would begin, al
though Roth indicated that the
present controversy over prelim
inary arrangements probably would
be settled during the summer.
