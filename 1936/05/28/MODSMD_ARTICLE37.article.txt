In a large, heavily-shaded, heat- !
controlled room on the fifth floor of !
the Stanford Library, the rare book i
room houses some 3800 items of j
priceless rarity, among them a leaf
from the famous Gutenberg Bible
and a first edition of that naughty
book, "Ulysses."
Some 442 years before Harry El
mer Barnes put forth his "History
of Western Civilization" a Nurem- i
berg physician, Hartmann Schedel, i
entered the market* with a more!
colossal work, the "Book of Chron- j
icles."
Six-inch Thick Tome
Curator and bibliographer of the I
collection is diminutive smiling j
Miss Jeanette McCrory Hitchcock,
who knows most about the Stanford
assortment of rare books and manu
scripts.
Bound in mystery as well as in !
sheepskin, the largest tome in the i
room is "Oflficium de Functorum," a
Catholic music book two and one
half feet long by 2 feet wide, by 6 '
inches thick. Its 276 vellum pages
were turned two centuries ago by
choir boys looking over fcach other's
shoulders.

I for Mr. Nathan Van Patten, library
director, in 1931. A reprint of
I "'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"
its postage-stamp-size pages made it
an original Xmas greeting card.
The finest example possessed by
the library of silver embellishment
on a binding is the hand-tooled
clasps and hinges of a Catholic mis
sal dated 1682. The strangest book
is the Kamavaca, written on palm
i leaf strips in Sanskrit, one of the
I oldest tongues in the world.
