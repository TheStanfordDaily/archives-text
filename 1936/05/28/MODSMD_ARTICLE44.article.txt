THANKS. BREED

I only wish I could put the fire
and life into this rag's sports guff
column that you have introduced
these past months. The Daily could
do well with a lot of guys like you.
And then it is customary to start
a round of crystal gazing into the
next volume, into grid season and
such things; but it seems to me that
grid season will get plenty of time
and interest when it comes, and that
this is still spring, not fall, Volume
89, not 90.
So hence the last two days will go
on with no change.

TOUGH BREAK,
KAPPA SICiS

Tuesday the Kappa Sigs were
playing Sigma Nu in Intramural
baseball championship eliminations.
Kappa Sig, you remember, are uni
versity basketball champs, and here
was a chance for winning another
major sport—a big double.
But there was the game drawing
on to 6 o'clock, then 6:05, and then
6:10. Sigma Nu was leading 4-3, and
Kappa Sigs were hollering their
lungs out to hurry the game up,
yelling to opposing pitcher Ed
Proctor to get moving, and quit the
fancy warm-ups.
Summarizing, the Kappa Sig un
easiness, quandry, chaos, what have
you, loosened their game, spoiled
maybe a victory.
Their exchange dinner with Alpha
O was to begin at 6 o'clock.

I THIS DISCUS SITUATION

Everyone was glad to see Slinger !
Dunn get off a 171-(3 official discus !
throw down at Compton last Friday !
night, because the world's discus '
supremacy is very hazy and indefi- j
nite, and thus we come one step |
nearer to a solution.
The world's accepted record is
held by a Mr. Harold Anderson of !
Sweden at 171-11%.
Dunn, however, has all sorts of 1
i marks up in the 175 and 176 area
I that are unofficial because no A.A.U.
! measurerers were there or because !
! nobody was there. Phil Levy, with
j a stiff tail wind on him Tuesday, got !
1 one out 175 and two others over 170.
All sorts of reports come up from
' Los Angeles about Ken Carpenter's
I practice throws, but in competition !
! Carpenter has a top of 165-3. Some
policeman over in MUhich last year
was said to have thrown 172.
So Dunn, one of the few in the
trade that don't reverse (change
feet during the throw), is leading
the pack that is sneaking up on An
derson. That record doesn't have a
i prayer.

REYNOLDS & REYNOLDS

Someone slipped up when they
neglected to sign Horse Reynolds on
as a shot-putting mate to Prexy Jim.
• Horse was out yesterday playing
around, throwing them out Dunn
i style, without the reverse. It seems
for the big guys there isn't enough
room in the circle to hop around ;
during the throw.
Anyway, there was cause back of !
this effect—Brother Alf Brandin had j
bet a stone with Dink Templeton :
that Horse could throw 48.
After 6 throws, with Alf and Dink |
doing all sorts of heckling through
out each, they brought out the tape, '
1 and gave the best one 47-IIV2.
So Dink is in Alf a stone, but more
than that, think what might have I
become of Reynolds if Thornhill !
' hadn't seen him first!
