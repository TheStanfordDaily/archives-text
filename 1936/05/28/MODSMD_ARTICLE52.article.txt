## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Though a Youngster Among Universities, Stanford's Expansion Seems Assured 
### 
As the time approaches when President Ray
Lyman Wilbur will shake the hands of some
550 members of the 45th graduating class, he
looks back at one of the big years in Univer
sity development, satisfied that the Farm is
"plugging along."
The year 1935-36 has had more than its just
share in the advancement of Stanford—aca
demically, structurally, and on whatever other
bases a university's development is figured.
But although this year has been one of the
highlights in Farm history, it appears to be
merely a pre-view of bigger things to come.
Stanford is still a toddling child among the
established educational institutions of the coun
try. Just in the past few years has Stanford
become old enough to see her gradually matur
ing alumni attain positions of esteem and impor
tance in nearly every line of work.
The oldest Stanford graduates are not too far
past middle age. Considering the University's
comparative youth, her record for successes has
been remarkably high.
With a new theater scheduled for completion
next year, the possibility that a new education
building will follow close on the heels of the
theater, an amphitheater already under con

struction, two new divisions of instruction (in
dustrial relations and international relations) to
be a part of the curriculum next year, and sev
eral research projects annually being com
pleted. immediate prospects are that Stanford
will be far from stagnant.
The University, furthermore, is looking be
yond just next year or the year after in its
building program. An off-Quad law building,
a music and graphic arts building to join the
theater, amphitheater and art gallery as a uni
fied cultural center, three new guarterly jour
nals to inform alumni and interested outsiders
on current academic developments—these are
all part of the University that President Wilbur
and Comptroller Almon E. Roth can see in the
not-so-distant future.
Each succeeding graduation will not merely
pour 600 more Stanford men and women into
the business world; it also will call to mind
those graduates of 40 years ago who have had
time to establish themselves.
And from a mercenary standpoint, this con
stantly increasing Stanford family — most of
which is at least moderately sufccessful—
through endowments and gifts will furnish
much of the wherewithal to insure the fulfill
ment of these expansion dreams.
