# Self-Imposed Check Is an Encouraging Sign
## 
### 
News that Ex Committee will reduce Com
munity Fees by one dollar fall quarter doesn't
vitally affect the typical Stanfordite's pocket
book. It does affect his impression of student
government and the University.
For although the dollar reduction in fees from
$115 to $114 is only the price of a date at the
movies (no loges) and a pack of cigarettes, it is
a downward movement in intention if not in
effective actuality.
Moreover, it is a movement inspired by in
telligence on the part of Stanford's student gov
ernors, not by an inevitable check imposed by
economic law.
It's only fair to say that no other money con
trol board, even one serving a typical state or
city government, would think of reducing taxes
unless they were compelled to by the inability
of citizens to pay.
Yet Ex Committee, faced by the prospect of
increasing ability to pay, and never faced in re
cent years by the necessity of curtailing its
budget, has voted the reduction.
More than a mere decision, it is indicative
that A.S.S.U. realizes its unjustified extrava
gance in collections. We who pay now have
at least the assurance that student governors
know the value of a dollar.
