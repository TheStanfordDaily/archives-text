# Social Science Journal Would Be Good Advertising
## 
### 
Tucked away in the files of unfinished busi
ness for a year or so will be the subject of a
Social Sciences Journal.
Though nothing has been done toward the
realization of the project this year, the idea is
one that will not die, since administrators are
conscious of the importance of the suggestion.

As football teams are good advertising for
the University in the realms of sport, just so
would a social sciences journal be good adver
tising in the realms of idea.
When Stanford's hard times are over, and
money again roots for dear old evil, maybe the
University will be able to chip a little money
out of the dermatophytosis budget, and do as
much for the cultural existence of the Pacific
slope as it has done for the belief of the Nordic
and Western myth among writers on San Fran
cisco's sport pages.
