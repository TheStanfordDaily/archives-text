Despite all the extensive cigarette advertising of
late, it is a well known and oft repeated fact that the
American Building Maintenance Corp. is sweeping
the campus.
There is a matter of fact about one of this com
pany's employees of Greek extraction, whose dis
traction every evening was manicuring the nails of
the history department. The males of the history de
partment, who wished very much to have Nick, or
maybe it was Dick, wipe the dust off their desks met
a stone wall every time, when Dick replied in perfect
English that he could not understand anything but
Greek.
One day in the midst of a reshuffling of their con
tact men, the Corp. shifted Nick, or Dick, down to the
Classics Department, where he was in charge of
brushing the split participles off the floor. When it
came to the business of brushing off the desks, there
seemed to be a difficulty. Finally a woman professor
spoke to him, but it became manifest that Dick, or
Nick, didn't understand Greek, either; at least no
Greek above the chair level.
I wish to announce today that the pajama story of
Iwo days ago was not about a certain track athlete
either. A.s a matter of fact, it wasn't about anybody.
Current excitement at the Phi Psi house is bet
ting on whether brothers are drunk. It seems that the
Phi Psi's have seen a good deal of drunkenness on
the screen, despite the efforts of the Paly Board of
Censors, and they are very good at imitation. One
night last wtn-k. two brothers came in, pretending they
were very drunk, and kicked brother number three,
who was very sober, and very tired, and very small
out of bed, and then put on a great exhibition of
struggle in the room before they fell exhausted into
brother three's bed. Brother number three, who had
never come in contact with that sort of thing in the
Phi Psi house before, was very frightened. Next day
he told the story carefully 1o the brothers, who were
very skeptical about any story concerning drunken
ness in the Phi Psi house, and were willing to lay
bets on the matter. Brother number three, who had
never heard of gambling either, sucked in fin the mat
ter, and lost heavily, when it was proven that the two
brothers were in a normal state. How they proved
it I don't know. I wonder, particularly, how could
they prove what is a Phi Psi's normal state?

were very drunk, and kicked brother number three,
who was very sober, and very tired, and very small
out of bed, and then put on a great exhibition of
struggle in the room before they fell exhausted into
brother three's bed. Brother number three, who had
never come in contact with that sort of thing in the
Phi Psi house before, was very frightened. Next day
he told the story carefully 1o the brothers, who were
very skeptical about any story concerning drunken
ness in the Phi Psi house, and were willing to lay
bets on the matter. Brother number three, who had
never heard of gambling either, sucked in fin the mat
ter, and lost heavily, when it was proven that the two
brothers were in a normal state. How they proved
it I don't know. I wonder, particularly, how could
they prove what is a Phi Psi's normal state?
Despite all the extensive cigarette advertising of
late, it is a well known and oft repeated fact that the
American Building Maintenance Corp. is sweeping
the campus.
There is a matter of fact about one of this com
pany's employees of Greek extraction, whose dis
traction every evening was manicuring the nails of
the history department. The males of the history de
partment, who wished very much to have Nick, or
maybe it was Dick, wipe the dust off their desks met
a stone wall every time, when Dick replied in perfect
English that he could not understand anything but
Greek.
One day in the midst of a reshuffling of their con
tact men, the Corp. shifted Nick, or Dick, down to the
Classics Department, where he was in charge of
brushing the split participles off the floor. When it
came to the business of brushing off the desks, there
seemed to be a difficulty. Finally a woman professor
spoke to him, but it became manifest that Dick, or
Nick, didn't understand Greek, either; at least no
Greek above the chair level.
I wish to announce today that the pajama story of
Iwo days ago was not about a certain track athlete
either. A.s a matter of fact, it wasn't about anybody.
Current excitement at the Phi Psi house is bet
ting on whether brothers are drunk. It seems that the
Phi Psi's have seen a good deal of drunkenness on
the screen, despite the efforts of the Paly Board of
Censors, and they are very good at imitation. One
night last wtn-k. two brothers came in, pretending they
were very drunk, and kicked brother number three,
who was very sober, and very tired, and very small
out of bed, and then put on a great exhibition of
struggle in the room before they fell exhausted into
