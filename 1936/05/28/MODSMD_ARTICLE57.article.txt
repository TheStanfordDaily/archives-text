## Discontented Millions 
### 
(From The Daily Kansau)
Charles M. Schwab, sailing for Europe, advises
young Americans not to go after riches, because it
"doesn't pay."
"There is nothing to it," says the steel magnate.
"I have worked hard all my life. I have made good
money and attained good things. But what does it
all amount to?"
He concluded by remarking that honest work,
peace and contentment are the best parts of life.
Coming from a man who made his millions out of
implements of war, this advice is rather comical.
Some people's idea of "peace" and the "good things"
seem rather perverted. As for peace—Senator Nye
in his investigations exposed what great peace lovers
are the munition makers.
Contentment! Anyone could be content with sev
eral million dollars in his bank account, but for the
poor worker who doesn't know how he is going to pay
his rent, it is rather difficult.
Perhaps it might be well for young Americans
to follow the Iron Duke's advice for it would cer
tainly be pandemonium if they followed his practices.
