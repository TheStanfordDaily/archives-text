## GOOD-BYE ANNIE LAURIE 
### 
Annie Laurie was a newspaper |
woman. She was a sob-sister who i
knew how to sob. She was a re
porter who knew how to report.
She was a writer who knew how to
write.
And because she was all of this, !
she died in a state of degradation j

according to cer
tain self - styled
intellectuals.
But if Annie
Laurie isn't re
garded as a bril
liant and cul
tured woman, it
isn't her fault.
It's the fault of
those who don't j
know the news-l
paper business'
and didn't know
Annie Laurie.

For if she did nothing else in her ,
life, she did see things straight.
Only by that ability of accurate ap
praisement could she have said so i
many things that no thinking person
could believe.
♦ * *
Now isn't the conventional time 1
for defense. Today Annie Laurie
lies in state in San Francisco's city
hall, recipient of the conventional j
testimonials and fuss.
But something should be said of
the Annie Laurie who lived and
breathed, not the Annie Laurie who i
pounded out sentiments on a broken- j
down editorial typewriter.
For Annie Laurie only worked on j

order. She didn't live that way. And
what went on in her head was far,
far different from what came out on
paper.
• * *
First off, Annie Laurie knew
people. And just because she could
rattle off paeans of praise for some
detestable charlatan is no reason to
believe that she didn't have his
"number."
Annie Laurie could do logarithms
with "numbers."
And when it came to politics, An
nie Laurie knew just what issues
were really issues, though she could
bang-out reams in support of a bill
or a concept that she, more than
anyone else, knew was an execrable
fake.
* * *
Annie Laurie was at home any
where. She was never a celebrity
or just part of a mob. She had a
tolerance of people and ideas that
would amaze some of the frozen
pragmatists who are loudest in their
criticism of her.
If her life was wasted on so many
of us who have used books as a
step-ladder so we could look down
on such people as her, it may be we
who are wrong. For if Annie Laurie
did nothing else, she always pre
served her own integrity.
That last is the important thing,
and the thing her critics haven't
heard of.
She was honest with herself. And
she was honest through all the eth
ical acrobatics her job demanded.

on such people as her, it may be we
who are wrong. For if Annie Laurie
did nothing else, she always pre
served her own integrity.
That last is the important thing,
and the thing her critics haven't
heard of.
She was honest with herself. And
she was honest through all the eth
ical acrobatics her job demanded.

Annie Laurie was a newspaper |
woman. She was a sob-sister who i
knew how to sob. She was a re
porter who knew how to report.
She was a writer who knew how to
write.
And because she was all of this, !
she died in a state of degradation j

according to cer
tain self - styled
intellectuals.
But if Annie
Laurie isn't re
garded as a bril
liant and cul
tured woman, it
isn't her fault.
It's the fault of
those who don't j
know the news-l
paper business'
and didn't know
Annie Laurie.

For if she did nothing else in her ,
life, she did see things straight.
Only by that ability of accurate ap
praisement could she have said so i
many things that no thinking person
could believe.
♦ * *
Now isn't the conventional time 1
for defense. Today Annie Laurie
lies in state in San Francisco's city
hall, recipient of the conventional j
testimonials and fuss.
But something should be said of
the Annie Laurie who lived and
breathed, not the Annie Laurie who i
pounded out sentiments on a broken- j
down editorial typewriter.
For Annie Laurie only worked on j

order. She didn't live that way. And
what went on in her head was far,
far different from what came out on
paper.

First off, Annie Laurie knew
people. And just because she could
rattle off paeans of praise for some
detestable charlatan is no reason to
believe that she didn't have his
"number."
Annie Laurie could do logarithms
with "numbers."
And when it came to politics, An
nie Laurie knew just what issues
were really issues, though she could
bang-out reams in support of a bill
or a concept that she, more than
anyone else, knew was an execrable
fake.
* * *
Annie Laurie was at home any
where. She was never a celebrity
or just part of a mob. She had a
tolerance of people and ideas that
would amaze some of the frozen
pragmatists who are loudest in their
criticism of her.
If her life was wasted on so many
of us who have used books as a
step-ladder so we could look down
on such people as her, it may be we
who are wrong. For if Annie Laurie
did nothing else, she always pre
served her own integrity.
That last is the important thing,
and the thing her critics haven't
heard of.
