Detroit officials last night asked G
men to invoke the Lindbergh Law
against the Black Legion as an aid
in attempting to suppress the
bloody reign of terror which has
been extending into 15 states.
At the same time a resolution
was introduced into the House
asking appointment of a commit
tee of seven to investigate the
terrorists and other similar organ
izations.

Government attorneys yesterday
prepared to take steps to recover
sectioris of the rich Elk Hills oil
fields. Suit will be filed in Los
Angeles to regain title to section
36, and claim royalties for gas and
oil extracted under private own
ership.

Special police and watchmen were
enrolled yesterday in Jerusalem to
protect outlying Jewish districts
from attacks by Arab bands. Sev
eral cities throughout the Holy
Lapd were the scene of firing, and
bombing at Jaffa caused evacua
tion of British families.
