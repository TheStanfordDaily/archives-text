The Editor, Sir:
In answer to suspicions of a cer
tain junior in yesterday's Daily we
would like to state that if you are
looking for a lily-white contest, the
present contest for the most popular
girl in the senior class is an excel
lent example.
We have neither axes to grind nor
profits to ream from this contest.
Our purpose is purely to add fur
ther glamor to the Senior Ball by
honoring some outstanding senior
woman in our class.
We feel that sufficient honors have
been heaped upon the male mem
bers of the class for their athletic
prowess, but that insufficient recog
nition has been given to the enor
mous amount of service rendered by
the women in our class in handling
the readjustments which have been
necessitated by the influx of new
women into the University.
We are allowing only seniors to
vote, because we feel that they are
the only ones qualified to judge their
classmates.
Upon the condition that you keep
the results secret until the night of
the ball, we would be very glad to
have the suspicious junior oversee
the balloting and the counting of the
votes next Friday.
