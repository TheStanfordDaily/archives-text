# STILL ALL WET

The Editor, Sir:
Some week or so ago, a protest
against sprinkling lawns in front of
the Quad during morning hours
appeared in these columns.
Demonstrating the power of the
press, it was immediately effective.
Yes, indeed, they've evidently
added two or three extra sprinklers,
moved them 10 feet closer to the
parked cars to be sure not to miss
any, and now only sprinkle in the
morning instead of a little bit in the
afternoon, too.
But we really like our cars well
wetted down anyway; no doubt it'll
rain, so what's the diff.
Probably the sprinkling can't be
done in the afternoon because of
some unwritten law like the one
that barred Jimmy Dorsey's song
stress from the campus.
