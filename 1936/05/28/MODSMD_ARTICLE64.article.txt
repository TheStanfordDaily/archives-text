"THE LAST PURITAN," by George
Santayana, Charles Scribner's
Sons, New Y'ork,
Forsaking his customary mediums
of expression this poet-philosopher
writes a novel, a memoir of the life
of "the last Puritan" which becomes
a record of pre-war civilization in
western Europe and America.
Oliver Alden, a young American
millionaire, a pupil of Santayana's
at Harvard, is "the last Puritan."
Not mere chastity, timidity, or fa
naticism, Oliver's puritanism is "a
hatred of all shams, scorn of all
mummeries, a merciless pleasure in
the hard facts."
Grimly serious, Oliver can neither
laugh at himself or others. Sent to
public school to leam to be a "good
American," Oliver excels in his
studies and sports. He becomes the
star fullback on the football team.
He hates the game, but he must keep
on playing; it it is his duty.
Wealthy and physically attractive,
Oliver is not successful in love.
Again his ascetic puritanism — "He
never discovered," his reckless,
warm-hearted friend Mario ob
served, "that all ladies are women."
In 1914 Oliver sees his duty again;
he enters the war to fight the Ger
mans whom he likes, on the side of
the French whom he doesn't like;
yet denouncing these "blind battles,"
he rejoices that "his inner mind is
not conscripted." Throughout his
life Oliver is the moral aristocrat.
The book is satisfying, because
Santayana makes us know his char
acters better than they know them
selves and, by his own honest in
vention, more than he could really
know them. —Warson
