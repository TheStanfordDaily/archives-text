Tux Shoes
There's nothing quite so important as the right
shoes for the Senior Ball. In the first place you
want style. Walkover's black royalite calf is the
smartest on the market. In the second place you
require comfort. The softness of an old slipper
is gained through the plain toe and flexible soles
of these Tuxedo Shoes. $7.50
