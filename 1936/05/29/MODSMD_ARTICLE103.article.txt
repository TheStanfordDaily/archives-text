# SO LONG TO L.S.J.U.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading your little news
organ for the past few days, I have
become convinced that this is prob
ably the finest University in Amer
ica—nay, even in the Wor-ruld. For
this information, may I thank you.
It is comforting to know that an
"expander" is at the head of our in
stitution. Of course, at. one time,
Stanford expanded into a med
school, and now subsidizes it with
much of the income from the origi
nal endowment, so that the Farm
itself is no longer tuition-free and
democratic. But, after all, 114-115
stones per quarter is a piffling sum.
It is also gratifying to know that
soon we'll have a fine school of ed
ucation, thanks to Mr. Cubberly's
generosity. And the new theater is
a dandy thing, too. And yet only
yesterday I was talking to a low
minded cynic who thought maybe

| we ought to spend a little of the
University's sparse funds on the not
i over-lovely men's lavatories un
der the Quad, or in rebuilding some
! of the faintly bumpy campus roads.
But seriously, Mr. Editor-mans,
i it is a swell school—and it's foibles
j are likely fewer and smaller than
I the average.
Possibly the worst charge that
! could be made against this institu
tion is that it takes itself too damn
j seriously. Take the heading at'the
j top of this column—that's nearly
a full belly laugh in itself. Yet we
did have a laughing football team
I once.
And now, heavens be praised, we I

are about to have a laughing edi- i
tor, for Hash-Sash, long the cam- j
pus' No. 1 funnyman, will run the ;
Dippy (no, not the Daily) next year, j
May his humor long wave!
So, dear sir, my classmates and I
will soon gather our broad cultural
background around us, climb into
monkey-suits, and leave Stanford i
with heart-throbs and heart-felt
thanks. Of course, not so many of |
us have jobs, but that is immate- I
rial, and surely not the University's i
fault.
Thanks for the education, Stan- i
ford; and thank you for the space, j
editor.

soon we'll have a fine school of ed
ucation, thanks to Mr. Cubberly's
generosity. And the new theater is
a dandy thing, too. And yet only
yesterday I was talking to a low
minded cynic who thought maybe

| we ought to spend a little of the
University's sparse funds on the not
i over-lovely men's lavatories un
der the Quad, or in rebuilding some
! of the faintly bumpy campus roads.
But seriously, Mr. Editor-mans,
i it is a swell school—and it's foibles
j are likely fewer and smaller than
I the average.
Possibly the worst charge that
! could be made against this institu
tion is that it takes itself too damn
j seriously. Take the heading at'the
j top of this column—that's nearly
a full belly laugh in itself. Yet we
did have a laughing football team
I once.
And now, heavens be praised, we I

are about to have a laughing edi- i
tor, for Hash-Sash, long the cam- j
pus' No. 1 funnyman, will run the ;
Dippy (no, not the Daily) next year, j
May his humor long wave!
So, dear sir, my classmates and I
will soon gather our broad cultural
background around us, climb into
monkey-suits, and leave Stanford i
with heart-throbs and heart-felt
thanks. Of course, not so many of |
us have jobs, but that is immate- I
rial, and surely not the University's i
fault.
Thanks for the education, Stan- i
ford; and thank you for the space, j
editor.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading your little news
organ for the past few days, I have
become convinced that this is prob
ably the finest University in Amer
ica—nay, even in the Wor-ruld. For
this information, may I thank you.
It is comforting to know that an
"expander" is at the head of our in
stitution. Of course, at. one time,
Stanford expanded into a med
school, and now subsidizes it with
much of the income from the origi
nal endowment, so that the Farm
itself is no longer tuition-free and
democratic. But, after all, 114-115
stones per quarter is a piffling sum.
It is also gratifying to know that
soon we'll have a fine school of ed
ucation, thanks to Mr. Cubberly's
generosity. And the new theater is
a dandy thing, too. And yet only

minded cynic who thought maybe
