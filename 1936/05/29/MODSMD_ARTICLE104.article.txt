THE END OF THE BEGINNING
OB VICE VERSA
As we go scuffling off into the sea
of life,
With or without a husband or a wife,
We will find—as on our way we
wend—
That undoubtedly man is dog's best
friend.
East is East, and West is West,
And at Stanford, the twain shall
meet.
And here wo learn that in winter
it's cold
And in summer there's plenty of
heat.
As we flash along, undoubtedly
much
Will come along to thwart us—
Not to the strong and fleet each
race.
Still—who wants to be a tortoise?
Max Anderson turned out Broadway
hits.
Hoover turned out of the White
House.
Many another has mastered his bit,
Perhaps you will learn in a light
house.
At least you come to life equipped,
Equipped for your leisure time.
If you don't like to eat, you'll enjoy
life
A lot, without getting off the dime.
Comrades about to embark from the
shore,
Some for a drunkard's grave.
Some as class poets will probably
score
i On the wonders of Burma shave.
Oh, the ten-cent intellectual,
• Oh, the dime sophisticate,
Oh, the Boy Scout ineffectual,
Will be: Rotary Club, and Mate.
Will be contract-signing business
men
! And contract-playing wives
Will be husbands and fine fathers
blest
With children with the hives.
And we'll send them back to Stan
ford,
Say, in twenty years or more—
For the culture and refinement
! Of a healthy stevedore.
We'll be earnest folk and citizens
And excellent providers,
Lovely mothers, charming wives,
! And maybe Ruthie Snyders.
We'll be loyal sons and Stanford men
With dollars and cigars,
With paunches and with tailored
suits
j And most expensive cars.
Oh. we'll make the name of Stanford
1 known
And loved throughout the land,
And we'll give each husky high
school slug
A healthy, wealthy hand.
And if we make a million bucks
In Uncle's button factory
i We'll start a five'-cent scholarship.

Won't that be satisfactory?
And if we make a noble fortune
Pumping kinds of gases
We'll endow the school with a bust j
of ourselves
I And inspire all future classes.

friend.
East is East, and West is West,
And at Stanford, the twain shall
meet.
And here wo learn that in winter
it's cold
And in summer there's plenty of
heat.
As we flash along, undoubtedly
much
Will come along to thwart us—
Not to the strong and fleet each
race.
Still—who wants to be a tortoise?
Max Anderson turned out Broadway
hits.
Hoover turned out of the White
House.
Many another has mastered his bit,
Perhaps you will learn in a light
house.
At least you come to life equipped,
Equipped for your leisure time.
If you don't like to eat, you'll enjoy
life
A lot, without getting off the dime.
Comrades about to embark from the
shore,
Some for a drunkard's grave.
Some as class poets will probably
score
i On the wonders of Burma shave.
Oh, the ten-cent intellectual,
• Oh, the dime sophisticate,
Oh, the Boy Scout ineffectual,
Will be: Rotary Club, and Mate.
Will be contract-signing business
men
! And contract-playing wives
Will be husbands and fine fathers
blest
With children with the hives.
And we'll send them back to Stan
ford,
Say, in twenty years or more—
For the culture and refinement
! Of a healthy stevedore.
We'll be earnest folk and citizens
And excellent providers,
Lovely mothers, charming wives,
! And maybe Ruthie Snyders.
We'll be loyal sons and Stanford men
With dollars and cigars,
With paunches and with tailored
suits
j And most expensive cars.
Oh. we'll make the name of Stanford
1 known
And loved throughout the land,
And we'll give each husky high
school slug
A healthy, wealthy hand.
And if we make a million bucks
In Uncle's button factory
i We'll start a five'-cent scholarship.

Won't that be satisfactory?
And if we make a noble fortune
Pumping kinds of gases
We'll endow the school with a bust j
of ourselves
I And inspire all future classes.
THE END OF THE BEGINNING
OB VICE VERSA
As we go scuffling off into the sea
of life,
With or without a husband or a wife,
We will find—as on our way we
wend—
That undoubtedly man is dog's best
friend.
East is East, and West is West,
And at Stanford, the twain shall
meet.
