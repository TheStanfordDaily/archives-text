# Alumni Association Scholarships Are Provided for Sixty-five Stanford Students
## 
### 
In four years the Allimni Associa
! tion enabled about 65 outstanding
, students to enter Stanford, says Har
low Rothert, Alumni Secretary.
This awarding of entering schol
( arships to bring "the cream of the
i crop" to Stanford is but one of many
activities carried on by the Alumni
Association, of which many of the
present class will soon become an
active part.
Review Published
j One of the most important of its
activities is the publication of the
I Illustrated Review, a monthly mag
-1 azine which covers all forms of stu
dent and alumni activities, faculty
news, and general University func-
I tions. This year the Review was
! awarded a special prize for the best
1 photographic covers and pictorial
J pages in a nation - wide contest
among alumni publications.
The Association's other chief jour
i nalistic activities are concerned with
i the publication of the Football
1 Weekly, "a timely inside story of
each important game," every year
during the football season.
(12 Clubs Fathered
The Alumni Association organizes,
1 sponsors, and stimulates all of the
1 62 Stanford clubs in the United
States, which are located from coast
| to coast.
In addition to the regular activi
i ties of the clubs, the Alumni Con
ferences held in various alumni cen
; ters on the Coast have been enthu
| siastically received. Rothert says,
j "Also, we arrange and organize the
j various class reunions each year,
University Day, lecture series, and

: help to maintain the class organi
zation among our alumni."
Movies Distributed
A new field which the Association
has recently entered is that of mo
tion pictures. The Association ar
ranges for the distribution of movies
of the big football games to clubs
throughout the country, and has
also this year Included a color film
giving an intimate glimpse of the
] life and activities of the entire cam
f pus.
Perhaps the activity best known
i by the majority of the students is
that in connection with athletics,
! for the Association handles football
j ticket applications each year, and
! membership in the Association
brings a special preference for good
tickets.
Contacts Arranged
Alumni are enabled to keep in
touch with each other, Rothert adds,
through the files kept by the staff of
four secretaries in the Administra
tion Building's Alumni office.
The next few years will be im
portant ones for Stanford alumni,
for the Association is embarking on
a five-year program which will cli â€”
1 max with the celebration of Stan
| ford's 50th anniversary in 1941.
To the end of having a strong or-
ganization "with over 10,000 mem-

Ibers in 1941," Mr. Rothert urges the
| members of the class of '36 to tajte
I advantage of the opportunities the
j Association offers to assist in schol
| arship activities, keep in contact
! with members of their class and
i other alumni, and to have an unex- I
! celled opportunity to hear promi
-1 nent Stanford men and women who
j are actively interested in current
; University and world-wide affairs.
