# Original '500' Approves Added Number of Women
## 
### Margaret Loud 
Though 54 graduating women in
the cla-s of '36 are proud to belong
to Stanford's long-famed 500, they
think that the addition of new
women has, on the whole, improved
the Farm. At least this belief has
been expressed by a number of
senior women students, who have
proved to be leaders in campus ac
tivities.
Mary Ann Wheeler, D.G. presi
dent and newly-named member of
Masquers, hit the keynote of the
50Q's feelings when she said, "I
thought it was more fun when there
were 500, but it's better for the
school to have the 1000."
King Approves
Virginia King, managing editor
of the 1936 Quad, agreed with: "We
were proud to be among the old
number, but the increased numbers
of women have created a more nor
mal situation on the campus."
"When there were 500, we thought
it was an accomplishment to get
here," laughed Eddie Hind, senior
vice-president. '"We really got a
kick out of being at Stanford, and
being the last class, felt badly when
the 500 went out. But 1 don't think
the change has affected the Uni
versity much."
Mercedes Bergmann, president of
Women's Conference, summed the
whole attitude up with: "Of course
I was as shocked as the rest when
we heard that hordes of women
were going to disturb the serene
excluyivenpss of the noble 500. But
we must admit that the 800, the
1000, and now the 1100 have brought
new life and interest to the cam
pus—besides their $115. The in
creased number of women has cer
tainly given impetus to the develop
ment of a broader, cultural pro
gram, as is shown by the new thea
ter project and the addition of mu
sic and art courses of the curricu
lum."
"The greatest change that I have
noticed is that we no longer know
every woman on the campus,"
added Jean Albertson, prominent
campus actress. "Some of the old
feeling of friendliness has been lost.
But it's fine that more women can
come to Stanford because it's such
a swell school."

Holley Arthur, Pi Phi Pan-Hell
representative, was one of the few

j tradition and some of the interest
in it is gone. Stanford has become
; a marriage market and not a place
! for an education. The girls are good
i daters but not such good girls'
; girls."
And a similar opinion was held
by Vivian Kay, Kappa. "I agree
with Holley," she sympathized, "ex
cept that Stanford has become a
marriage bureau for everybody— j
but the 500. So back to the 500

were going to disturb the serene
excluyivenpss of the noble 500. But
we must admit that the 800, the
1000, and now the 1100 have brought
new life and interest to the cam
pus—besides their $115. The in
creased number of women has cer
tainly given impetus to the develop
ment of a broader, cultural pro
gram, as is shown by the new thea
ter project and the addition of mu
sic and art courses of the curricu
lum."
"The greatest change that I have
noticed is that we no longer know
every woman on the campus,"
added Jean Albertson, prominent
campus actress. "Some of the old
feeling of friendliness has been lost.
But it's fine that more women can
come to Stanford because it's such
a swell school."
Lost Tradition—Arthur
Holley Arthur, Pi Phi Pan-Hell
representative, was one of the few

| think that Stanford has lost a line
j tradition and some of the interest
in it is gone. Stanford has become
; a marriage market and not a place
! for an education. The girls are good
i daters but not such good girls'
; girls."
And a similar opinion was held
by Vivian Kay, Kappa. "I agree
with Holley," she sympathized, "ex
cept that Stanford has become a
marriage bureau for everybody— j
but the 500. So back to the 500
days." J
Though 54 graduating women in
the cla-s of '36 are proud to belong
to Stanford's long-famed 500, they
think that the addition of new
women has, on the whole, improved
the Farm. At least this belief has
been expressed by a number of
senior women students, who have
proved to be leaders in campus ac
tivities.
Mary Ann Wheeler, D.G. presi
dent and newly-named member of
Masquers, hit the keynote of the
50Q's feelings when she said, "I
thought it was more fun when there
were 500, but it's better for the
school to have the 1000."
King Approves
Virginia King, managing editor
of the 1936 Quad, agreed with: "We
were proud to be among the old
number, but the increased numbers
of women have created a more nor
mal situation on the campus."
"When there were 500, we thought
it was an accomplishment to get
here," laughed Eddie Hind, senior
vice-president. '"We really got a
kick out of being at Stanford, and
being the last class, felt badly when
the 500 went out. But 1 don't think
the change has affected the Uni
versity much."
Mercedes Bergmann, president of
Women's Conference, summed the
whole attitude up with: "Of course
I was as shocked as the rest when
we heard that hordes of women
were going to disturb the serene
excluyivenpss of the noble 500. But
