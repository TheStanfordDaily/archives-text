# Eastman, Dunn, Klopstock, Reynolds, Levy, Bright Shoot For Olympic Games
## Summer Track Campaign Will Starts June 19; Mottram Has Chance 
### 
There comes to interest that ques
tion of what Stanford trackmen are
going to show in the big festivities
this summer. Lead-off meet will be
the N.C.A.A. at Chicago June 19-20,
followed by the American Olympic
trial at New York July 11-12, and
climaxed by the Eleventh Olympiad
at Berlin starting July 31.
Ray Dean and Jim Kneubuhl both
stand chances of making the East- j
cm trip pending their perform
ances at Berkeley tomorrow. Their
chances to board ship, along with j
those of Jack Weiershauser, quar- !
termiler, are bettered by the num- ;
ber of 400-meter and 1600-meter
relay berths that will be open.
Dixon. Burrows to Chicago
Edson Burrows and Warren Dixon j
seem certain starters at Chicago in !
the long distances—Burrows' 9:25
and Dixon's 4:16 should stack up
even in the Midwestern League. The
Olympic trip, however, is another
thing; Burrows has voiced plans of
competing at 10,000 meters (about 6
miles). Chuck Nimmo has not yet
thrown in the towel after that leg
injury.
Bill McCurdy and Ray Malott may
run middle distance at Chicago, if
performances before that time merit
their- joining the ten-man squad
that makes the trip. Captain Sam
Klopstock is certain to go, and Au
gust might find him in Berlin, if he
has a good day over Cope, Moore,
Staley, and Kirkpatrick.
Phil Levy and Jim Reynolds seem
really set up for Berlin rides at this
viewing—Levy with any kind of
luck can come in the best three
American discus men, while Rey
nolds is the leading college shot
putter of the country today.
Smith, Madlcm Possibilities
Humbert Smith's 6-7 '/4 against
U.C.L.A. assures him of a trip to
Chicago, where the competition will
begin to appear, while if Leo Mad
lcm gets a 24-foot leap one of these
times, he could go too.
The graduate contingent is of
course led by Ben Eastman, whose
1:52.9 half-mile on Angell Field
hasn't been bettered in the country
this year. Dink Templeton said last
February, '"There's no one can beat
Eastman at 800 meters this summer."
Second man would then be Sling
er Dunn, whose 171-6 discus heave
last week makes him an easy bet
for the American Olympic team.
Silence from Lyman
Not much word comes from John
ny Lyman, '34, the second best shot
puter that ever lived. Lyman is
studying in Heidelberg, and as yet
the American Committee has not
given him permission to qualify for
Olympic competition without com
ing to New York for the trials.
Norm Bright is rapidly coming
down to competitive times in his
favorite, the 5000 meters. It'll be
interesting to watch his Eastern
campaign against the boys who
make a business of running.
Johnny Mottram, a cinch member
of the javelin team, and A1 Black
mail, possible relayman, complete
the graduated division.
