CHUCK NIMMO
We can't quit without just a
word about Chuck Nimmo; by the
Gods he deserves credit here if he
gets it nowhere else.
Nimmo, as you have perceived,
is a natural born runner—he has
some physiological difference —
long legs and a big heart or what
ever it is, that permits him to run
twice as fast as the rest of us.
Down at Hollywood High he was j
good, being in the 4:30 class, and
in his freshman year at Stanford
he was better, running 4:21.4 for a
new freshman record, being elect
ed with Klopstock co-captain of the
'36 frosh team.
In his soph year Nimmo still j
burned them up; being the first
winning distance man around here
in four or five years, he gave the
alumni and followers new life by
winning two or three distance runs
each meet. Ho was sixth, behind
Bonthron, Cunningham, and Zenz
ke, to a 4:08.4 mile at the N.C.A.A. i
in Los Angeles.
Last year (they say it was chem- |
istry labs) he didn't train much, I
and ran behind Dixon most of the ;
season, hitting a bottom of maybe '
4:26.
Came 1936, and early Chuck j
showed that he was going to make !
a season of it. Ahead of Dixon from
the start, he won right and left. !
hitting a bottom of 4:19.7 against !
U.C.L.A,, always tantalizing his au- ;
dience and opponents by rubbing \
his chest and legs with both hands '
throughout the race—it got so the !
fans weren't content until Nimmo j
scratched himself on the second
lap.
As proof of his versatility, he ran
a 1:56 half and 9:37 two-mile in
practice, then sacrificed taking a
new Big Meet mile record in sav
ing himself for necessary points
from the two-mile.
With Dixon finally getting down
below 4:20 to press him, with a
crack at that Olympic Club med
ley team at Fresno, and with'
Breed's projected fouf-mile relay
j world record attempt as more in
j centive, Nimmo might have done
| things to make himself an all-time
; king of Stanford long distance run
| ning.
Then came that muscle pull, as it
seems frequently to do with those
| who threaten the heights.
Our tribute to the guy with the
| unlucky throw.
KEEP UP WITH
THINGS, MATES
You that think you can start fol
lowing major league ball because
Stanford athletics are over for a
while are wrong. In an Olympic
summer they go on and on. Today
and tomorrow will start the sum
mer calendar, with fifteen of Dink
Templeton's trackmen vieing for
honors in the Pacific Coast lnter
collegiates at Edwards Field across
the bay.
After that, one division of about
10 trackmen will go to the N.C.
A.A. at Chicago June 19 and 20,
while another will enter first the
district Olympic tryouts in Stan
ford Stadium June 13 and then the
regional tryouts June 26 at the Coli
seum in Los Angeles.
Those that place in either qual
ifying process will journey to the
| biggest meet in the country this

year, the United States final try- T
outs at Randell's Island, New York, |
July 11 and 12.
Uncle Sam will pay passage for
three men from each event over to i
Berlin, where the Eleventh Olym
