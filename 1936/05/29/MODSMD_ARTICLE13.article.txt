## 
### Alberta Carden 
Madam Ida Stauf, retiring pro
fessor in the Romanic languages de
partment, has never slopped learn
ing since she was old enough to
go lo school. Having studied in
t schools abroad as much as in
schools in the United States she
has traveled all her life.
Dr. Stauf was born in the uni
' versity town, Bonne-on-thc-Rhinc,
! in Germany, in July 1871, after the
; Franco-Prussia* War. She was
j brought up in England, France, and
Germany, studying in Vienna in
! 1890-92 and in Venice 1892-95.
Arriving in America in 1895, Ida
Stauf came to Stanford, where she
got her A.B. in 1910 and her A.M.
i two years later, both in Germanic
j languages.
Paly !o Paris and Bark
There followed a teaching career
that took her from Palo Alto to
France and back again. She began
with private coaching in French,
! Italian, and German in Palo Alto;
next she was an assistant instructor
in Romanic languages here at
I Stanford. In 1922 Madam Stauf
took student work in the University

| of Paris, where she did much rc-
I search work, and ended in 1927 as a
| "Doctcur dc l'Universite de Paris"
I in Sorbonne.
Returning to Stanford in 1928,
! she was made an instructor, and
| in January, 19,'5fi, she became an as
: sistant professor of romanic lan
i guages.
If You're Smart . . .
Speaking of her school experi
ences abroad, Madam Stauf told
how lectures arc not compulsory
!in the universities. The theory is
that if you are smart, you wdl read
enough not to need to go to class.
If you do go, though, you sign
your name in a little book provided
for the purpose. As a result classes
are well attended. Another striking
. difference, she said, was that the
professors don't mind being
"downed," or "talked back to!"
And as for doctor's examinations,
the public is invited by announce
ment.
Madam Stauf's plans for the fu
ture are rather indefinite, but she
I will probably live on the campus
j and continue giving private lessons,
I lectures, and tours.
