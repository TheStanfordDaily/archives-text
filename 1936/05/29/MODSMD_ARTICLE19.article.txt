# Gros' Report Advises Clean-Up of A.S.S.U., Full-Time Manager
## Student Manager Recommends Startling Measures; Blames Exuberant Youths; Claims Extravagance Is Undemocratic 
### JOHN RICE 
"Stanford students must take steps to cican house in student govern
ment if they do not wish the administration to do it for them."'
So asserted Student Manager Bob Gros in the annual report which
I he released to The Daily last night, and which today will he distrib
uted to Ex Committee members and Graduate Manager A1 Masters.

"The question is not whether the
students have sufficient control, for
an affirmative answer is inescap
able," continued the report. "The
true question which must logically
follow is whether the students have
measured to that autonomy granted
them by demonstrating a sense of
responsibility commensurate with
the faith thus reposed in them.
The answer to this is a rather em
phatic 'No.'
"Dr. Wilbur has been tolerant in
deed but if this extravagance and
this irresponsible disregard of the
basic spirit of this University is
not checked by the students them
selves, he will simply be forced to
take action which would not only
be distasteful to him, but which
would irreparably injure student
government."
Claiming this to be no gloomy
prophecy made to be sensational,
Gros' report said that it is simply a
sincere effort to call student atten
tion to the facts, that the present
situation may be rectified.
Youthfulness Blamed
Blaming the natural exuberance
and impetuosity of youth, Gros
claimed that left unchecked it will
ultimately be undesirable not only
to Ihe University but also to the
students.
"It will be argued that student
control teaches responsibility and
gives excellent training," he con
tinued. "which fact cannot be de
nied. But has this training been at
such a sacrifice in efficiency of op
eration that much of the good is off
set by bad? The answer is inevi
tably 'Yes.'
Second major point in Gros' re
port was the accusation that the po
sition of student manager is the
weakest phase in the entire A.S.
S.(J. system. There are four primary
deficiencies which, according to
Gros, prevent the present system,
from working efficiently:
Position Weak
1. Lack of continuity between the
administrations of successive stu
dent managers makes impossible a
definite long-range program, a high
degree of executive responsibility,
and each student manager's proper
knowledge of "the ropes."
2. Relationship of the student
manager to Student Organizations
Fund accounts is merely that of a
banker.
3. The position is too big for a
student trying to carry an adequate
academic course in the University,
[ and yet devote the proper amount
! of time to Ihis work.
4. The administration of a fund
of $140,000 warrants full-time at
tention.
Looking toward the future, Gros'
recommendation for nccessary
changes is the creation of n full
time executive "who would be able
to take care of the financial side of
the student body in a more efficient
manner than the student manager
can under the existent set-up and
at the same time advise and co
ordinate student activities."
Gros proposed that this officer
should be titled similarly to corre

not checked by the students them
selves, he will simply be forced to
take action which would not only
be distasteful to him, but which
would irreparably injure student
government."
Claiming this to be no gloomy
prophecy made to be sensational,
Gros' report said that it is simply a
sincere effort to call student atten
tion to the facts, that the present
situation may be rectified.
Youthfulness Blamed
Blaming the natural exuberance
and impetuosity of youth, Gros
claimed that left unchecked it will
ultimately be undesirable not only
to Ihe University but also to the
students.
"It will be argued that student
control teaches responsibility and
gives excellent training," he con
tinued. "which fact cannot be de
nied. But has this training been at
such a sacrifice in efficiency of op
eration that much of the good is off
set by bad? The answer is inevi
tably 'Yes.'
Second major point in Gros' re
port was the accusation that the po
sition of student manager is the
weakest phase in the entire A.S.
S.(J. system. There are four primary
deficiencies which, according to
Gros, prevent the present system,
from working efficiently:
Position Weak
1. Lack of continuity between the
administrations of successive stu
dent managers makes impossible a
definite long-range program, a high
degree of executive responsibility,
and each student manager's proper
knowledge of "the ropes."
2. Relationship of the student
manager to Student Organizations
Fund accounts is merely that of a
banker.
3. The position is too big for a
student trying to carry an adequate
academic course in the University,
[ and yet devote the proper amount
! of time to Ihis work.
4. The administration of a fund
of $140,000 warrants full-time at
tention.
Looking toward the future, Gros'
recommendation for nccessary
changes is the creation of n full
time executive "who would be able
to take care of the financial side of
the student body in a more efficient
manner than the student manager
can under the existent set-up and
at the same time advise and co
ordinate student activities."
Gros proposed that this officer
should be titled similarly to corre
(Continued on page 4)
"Stanford students must take steps to cican house in student govern
ment if they do not wish the administration to do it for them."'
So asserted Student Manager Bob Gros in the annual report which
I he released to The Daily last night, and which today will he distrib
uted to Ex Committee members and Graduate Manager A1 Masters.

"The question is not whether the
students have sufficient control, for
an affirmative answer is inescap
able," continued the report. "The
true question which must logically
follow is whether the students have
measured to that autonomy granted
them by demonstrating a sense of
responsibility commensurate with
the faith thus reposed in them.
The answer to this is a rather em
phatic 'No.'
"Dr. Wilbur has been tolerant in
deed but if this extravagance and
this irresponsible disregard of the
basic spirit of this University is
not checked by the students them
selves, he will simply be forced to
take action which would not only
be distasteful to him, but which
would irreparably injure student
