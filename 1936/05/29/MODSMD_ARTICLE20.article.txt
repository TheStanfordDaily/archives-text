FRANCE'S BLUM
On the 4th of next month Leon
Blum will take office as the French
Premier. He calls himself a So
cialist and it was through the mar
riage of the Socialists and the Com
munists and other radicals that hit
faction became strong enough tt
elect him.
When the honorable Leon Blum
was elected, many a stock market
shivered in its boots, especially thi
French exchange.
The alarm was so great in the
U.S. and there was so much concern
in New York over the election of
llii . "radical" that General Motors
and many of the others slipped
down about 10 points. The franc
wavered a bit, and ever since the
market has been shaky and uncer
tain.

Few Wall Street executives re

Remember in 1932 or thereabouts
how we used to hear that there was

Blum plans high taxes on large
