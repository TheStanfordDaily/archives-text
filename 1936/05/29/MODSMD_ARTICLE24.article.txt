# Last Chappie Gives Original Rough Gallery
## 
### 
One of the big laughs in the
June number of Chaparral, sell
ing on Quad Wednesday, is the
authentic "roughs gallery" of
freshman registration photos of
prominent contemporary Farm
big shots.
Machinations of the Cardinals
are exposed by Walton Wickett
describing the tribulations of A
Certain Student who always
wanted to become a member and
finally didâ€”in his last days as a
Stanford student.
Much correspondence with the
noted cartoonist, Rodel Johnson,
has succeeded in inducing that
luminary to draw another cover
especially for Chappie. It depicts
an unusual situation at Com
mencement.
A valedictory poem by Copp
reviewing the life of a Stanford
student from Matriculation to
Commencement is illustrated with
rare perception by Editor-elect
Oilman Gist.
