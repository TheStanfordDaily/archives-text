# Farm Success With Speakers' Bureau Traced
## Schafer Responsible For Founding, Continuance Of Speech Organization 
### Dave Botsford 
A year ago a mere idea .smoulder
ing in a freshman's mind, today a
valuable part of the A.S.S.U. which
sends two or more students every
day to speak before Bay District
audiences — that's the Stanford
Speakers' Bureau.
Brain of the Bureau is Charles
Louis Schafer, now a Toyon soph
omore, who last fall talked Speech
Professor William Timmons, Stu
dent Manager Bob Gros, and A.S.
S.U. Prexy Wally Brooke into giv
ing his speech bureau plan a try.
Schafer Starts Bureau
They made him manager, gave
him a small amount of student
body cash to get started on. Scha
fer promptly rounded up 20 of the
University's most brilliant student
speakers, sent them out to penin
sula luncheon clubs and schools to
present their talks.
After Chuck got the speakers
and their subjects lined up, he had
descriptive lists published which
he mailed to over 200 clubs, schools,
and organizations from San Fran
cisco to San Jose.
Jump at Chance
Chuck was surprised, but nat
urally pleased, at the number of
letters and telephone calls which
resulted. This was a chance for
high schools and community groups
to hear what Stanford had to say—
and they certainly jumped at it.
Of 20 talks which range from
"What's in the Political Grab-bag
for '36" to "Truth about the Black
Widow Spider," Schafer finds Bob
Gros' personal recollections on
"Will Rogers, the Man" and Bob
Niccolls' experiences when "I Was
a Cable Spinner" on the Bay
Bridge the most most popular.
Speaks, Then Sings
He tells of humorous incidents—
how Alice McKnight began her ap
pearance at a San Jose business
men's club with her "What is
'American'?" speech and ended by
singing "I've Been Working on the
Railroad."
When Gros was introduced in San
Mateo, the chairman said: "Today
we have Bob Gros from Stanford.
Next week we'll visit the sewage
disposal plant." The bureau had to
disappoint a Palo Alto club which
wanted a ' 'girl or young lady
dancer", for a vaudeville show.
