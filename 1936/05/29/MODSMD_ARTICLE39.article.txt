# Stewart, Oneal Will Meet In Golf Final
## 
### M Jack Newman 
When "Spec" Stewart meets Bill
Oneal in the finals of the all-Uni
versity golf tournament at the |
Stanford course tomorrow, 1936 !
golf will come to its climax and ]
official end simultaneously.
The Stewart-Oneal match as seen I
by the sideliners will merely be a |
question of how long Oneal can j
stem the superhuman par-slashing
golf that Stewart has been playing
for the last few weeks. In the
tournament thus far "Spec" has
played only 57 holes and has been
16 under par.
Oneaj s Goif Good
Not that it won't be a good
match. Oneal has played golf that j
is scarcely less sensational and has \
defeated men as good or better than ;
those who have succumbed tQ

Spec's barrage of sub-par golf.
It will be a bitter battle of two j
opposite types of golfers. Stewart
is experienced. The last three
j years have made their mark on the
j once careless, carefree boomer. •
i The long, wild wood shots which
I used to just manage to wobble off j
I line into this or that trap go straight
! down the fairway with an increase, !
| not a loss in distance.
Spec's Last Game
Stewart himself' says that he just
got on how to swing. His iron
shots are steady and accurate, j
"Spec" is ending his college career
as a finished golfer.
Oneal represents the type which 1
j is just on the upswing of his ca
| reer; no one realizes this more than
| Bill, who, with an eye to the fu
j ture decided to save his last year
j of collegiate competition for next j
1 year when he will be more expe- i
ricnced and more valuable to the j
I team.
His game is second to very few,
! though, even at this time. He blasted
I Bob Thompson from the All-Tour- j
| nament with a 69 and golf like
] that may make "Spec" step out and j
i shoot really record golf.

Spec's barrage of sub-par golf.
It will be a bitter battle of two j
opposite types of golfers. Stewart
is experienced. The last three
j years have made their mark on the
j once careless, carefree boomer. •
i The long, wild wood shots which
I used to just manage to wobble off j
I line into this or that trap go straight
! down the fairway with an increase, !
| not a loss in distance.
Spec's Last Game
Stewart himself' says that he just
got on how to swing. His iron
shots are steady and accurate, j
"Spec" is ending his college career
as a finished golfer.
Oneal represents the type which 1
j is just on the upswing of his ca
| reer; no one realizes this more than
| Bill, who, with an eye to the fu
j ture decided to save his last year
j of collegiate competition for next j
1 year when he will be more expe- i
ricnced and more valuable to the j
I team.
His game is second to very few,
! though, even at this time. He blasted
I Bob Thompson from the All-Tour- j
| nament with a 69 and golf like
] that may make "Spec" step out and j
i shoot really record golf.
