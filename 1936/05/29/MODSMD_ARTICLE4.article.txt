# Libe Opens As Quarter Ends
## Next Two Sunday Nights Open for 'Students' 
### Sylvestre J. Drofnats 
Pretty soon summer will be here,
and then Stanford students can set
tle down into the function for
which they are primarily fitted —
basal metabolism, but until then,
there must needs be a' great deal
of punishing of bound volumes, of
slapping the periodicals, and hitting
the books.
In response to this quarterly pe
riodicity of Stanford myopics, Di
rector Nathan Van Patten of the
University Libraries announces that
that building over there by the Art
Gallery and just off the path to the
B.A.C. building will be open on the
next two Sunday nights .until 10
o'clock (or more specifically, until
the bell rings at 9:50 and the win
dows start banging).
Then, if things settle down a bit
next week and affairs don't get too
pressing, end-quarter examinations
(known more vulgarly as "finals")
will start a week from tomorrow.
That is, if you can believe a room
mate's time schedule. And a time
schedule never forgets.
This opening of the Libe, of
course, is to raise the class aver
age so that more or less students
will flunk out of school. It all start
ed out as the result of a Daily cam
paign to open the Libe ori Sunday
nights instead of Friday nights, on
the assumption that Sunday, being
a day of rest from worldly pur
suits, the Stanford student might
study on that night.
Mr. van Patten opened up the
Libe for two Sunday nights at the
end of last quarter, expressed him
self pleased as a result of the ex
periment, promised to continue it at
the ends of future quarters, of
which this seems to be one. The
first experiment, however, did not
show that enough students wished
to study in the Libe on Sunday
nights to warrant a complete change
for a whole quarter.
