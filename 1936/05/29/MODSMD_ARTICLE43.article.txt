# Tenative Plan For Theater School Made
## Dramatic Workshop Class To Stage Regular Plays With Student Direction 
### Sue Hammond 
Plans for the schedule of pro
duction for the new theater are still
somewhat uncertain owing to the
indefinite status of the present Dra
matic Council. However, a tentative
policy of the School of the Theater
has been formulated.
This proposes the staging of a ma
jor production each quarter, with
probably more than one perform
ance. In addition to this there will
be regular weekly or bi-weekly pro
ductions staged by the class in dra
matic workshop, which will be di
rected by students under the super
vision of a faculty adviser, or a
graduate student adviser who will
in turn work under Dr. John Uhler,
head of the department.
Workshop Productions
The distinction between the aca
demic workshop productions and the
regular quarterly presentations is
that Ihe latter will be open to the
students at large.
II has not as yet been determined
whether the major productions will
be sponsored by Dramatic Council
and the student body, ox* by the
University administration.
Various plans have been proposed
to take care of musical shows pro
duced each quarter entirely by stu
dent organizations, a continuation of
the present custom of Barnstormers
and Ram's Head. 1
Dr. Uhler's Program
Dr. Uhler plans to outline a year's
balanced program in advance,
blending both the policies of major
and workshop productions, so that
plays oi all types may be worked to
gether for variety and practical ex
perience. These will include modern
comedy and drama, classical trage
dies, costume, and experimental
plays.
The policy with regard to play
readings will have to be worked out
to fit in with the program of work
shop productions. Readings in the
last five years have been fulfilling
the function which will now be
taken over by workshop produc
tions. These, however, will not be
discontinued, but will be given in
addition to workshop presentations.
