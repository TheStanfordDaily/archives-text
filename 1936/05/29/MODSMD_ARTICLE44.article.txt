spending officials at Columbia,
Michigan, and others—Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, or Director of Activi
ties. According to Gros' plan he
must be n college graduate, with
business acumen, common sense,
tact, and organizing ability. A sal
ary commensurate with his work
should be paid half by the Asso
ciated Students and half by the
University.
Declared the report; "To silence
the inevitable cries of the usual
campus cynics the present manager
wishes to unequivocally state that
he is not a candidate for such a
position."
Third consideration of importance
was the loss in campus democracy
induced by student extravagance.
Students have too much money to
spend, declared Gros.
Obvious abuses resulting from
over abundant capital:
Extravagance in spending "a
detriment to the factor of good
it aining, for good training consists
in living within a budget. It en
hances the spirit of keeping up with
the next fellow and intensifies the
prevalent outside attitude that
Stanford is a rich man's school.
"Of deeper significance is the ac
cusation that the current extrava
gance is harmful to Stanford spirit
of equality and democracy.
Gros contrasted the words of the
A.S.S.U. Constitution: "A spirit of
equality must be maintained with
in the University. To this end we
commend and uphold the Univer
sity authorities in prohibition of ex
cessive expenditures and other ex
cesses on the part of students"—
with the $900 paid the Junior Prom
orchestra and the $8.50 charged for
Senior Ball bids.
In closing, Gros lauded in his re
port the high degree of centraliza
tion of student fiscal affairs. He
acknowledged that the system has
done much to curb the petty "graft"
and misuse so typical of the aver
age college student body, and that
it has been of great value in teach
ing students the necessity of ade
quate records, publicity of expendi
tures, and other features of sound
business.
San Francisco's infant mortality
rate of 3.1 deaths per 1,000 live births
is one of the lowest in the country.
