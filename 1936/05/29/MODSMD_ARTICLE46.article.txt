# Building Funds Given Largely By Students
## Five Student Generations Allowed 20 Years For Repayment of Loan

Novel among the features in the
history of Stanford's new theater
unit is the fact that construction has
been financed almost entirely by
student funds, according to Comp
troller Almon E. Roth.
Both directly and indirectly, stu
dents have contributed, and will
continue to contribute until 1957, to
the $587,000 sum. On that date, it
is estimated, a loan from the Uni
versity Board of Trustees will have
been repaid with full interest.
Approximately $186,000 was se
cured immediately after the close
of the war by the original Memorial
Fund Commitee, which sought to
raise a symbol of tribute on the
campus to Stanford men who died
in service overseas.
Waited for Money
With the proposal in mind to erect
a theater, however, officials decided
to hold and build the fund until it
was sufficiently large to permit con
struction of a building according to
the present plans.
Five years ago the fund was
swelled by $2,000, the result of con
tributions obtained through an edi
torial campaign in Chaparral. At
present, 75 per cent of all Union
profits are turned over to theater
finances together with $1 per quar
ter from each student.'
2(1 Years to Pay
Four per cent interest is being
paid to the Board of Trustees on a
loan granted to permit start of con
struction last fall. The dollar from
each student will clear the principal
and interest in approximately 20
years, Roth said.
A gift of $35,000 from Howard
Frost of Los Angeles as a memorial
to his son, John Lawrence Frost,
member of the Class of '35, is being
used to finance the amphitheater
project.
