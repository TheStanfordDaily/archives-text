# Sound Movies Feature Plans
## Theater To Have Latest Type Projection Rooms 
### 
Talking motion picture equip
| ment of the latest type will be an
added feature of both the Yittle The
j ater on the west side of the main
structure, and the main auditorium,
according to completed plans.
Projection moms comparable to
those of professional movie theaters
will provide any kind of service,
J from stage flood-lighting to con
tinuous picture-showing.
The auditorium, itself, will be
sound-treated to give perfect results
for talkies, and will be one of the
i few college theaters in the West so
equipped.
Backstage, loudspeakers similar in
operation and volume capacity 1o
those in large San Francisco thea
ters will throw the sound through a
perforated screen.
Possibility that Stanford students
might see professionally exhibited
movies on the campus and in a house
comparable to any in the Bay re
gion was seen with the inclusion of
this equipment in theater plans.
