# Five-Point Art Program Is Roth's Plan
## 
### 
Indicating the direction of fu
ture Farm building, Comptroller
Almond E. Roth last January re
vealed that the Memorial Theater
and the Amphitheater are to be
part of a proposed five-building
art centcr.
The present Art Gallery is
one member of this group. Plans
call for the construction of a
Graphic Arts and a Music Build
ing on either side of the new
theatre.
The Memorial Theater will
make possible a Stanford school
of drama. As a result control of
dramatics would probably be
transferred from the Ex Com
mittee to the University adminis
tration.
Recent Farm building seems 1
have fallen into definite phases.
One period was characterized by
the expansion of both men's and
women's physical education facili
ties. Later, the University turned
to dormitory expansion, building
Brnnner and Lagunita Halls.
Comptroller Roth's five - point
art plan indicates that the trend
during the next phase of Stanford
construction will be toward im
proved art facilities.
