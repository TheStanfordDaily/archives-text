# Amphitheater Work Advances
## To Be Part of Art Center; Will Seat 7500 
### 
When (he gift of $35,000 and car- (
loads of free earth were given to the
University last March, Comptroller j
Almond E. Roth saw a long-sup- i
pressed desire materializing, namely, |
a "natural" amphitheater fur the j
University.
Today that amphitheater is fast i
taking form between Lasuen and j
Galvez streets. Back to back with i
the new Memorial Theater, it will
be in the center of the proposed art j
center.
The amphitheater will seat ap- j
proximately 7500 persons, but it can j
be made to accommodate more if i
necessary. There will be nothing to j
suggest that it is a man-made proj- i
ect, the stage and bowl being sodded I
and naturally irregular.
It will be used for graduation
exercises, outdoor plays and con
certs. Memorial Theater dressing
rooms will be easily accessible from
the stage of the amphitheater, while
the trees clustering around the bowl '
will cut ofT the view of campus '
buildings.

required to crane their necks from j
bad-angle front scats.
In the auditorium of the adjoining (
Little Theater even more foot-room i
will be provided, with 39 inches be
tween Ihe backs of the seats. There j
will be a rise of 10 inches for each '
row, thus providing ideal vision fur
each of the 200 possible occupants j
of this "perfect little theater." j
