# Amphitheater Work Advances
## To Be Part of Art Center; Will Seat 7500 
### 
When the gift of $35,000 and car-
loads of free earth were given to the
University last March, Comptroller
Almond E. Roth saw a long-sup-
pressed desire materializing, namely,
a "natural" amphitheater for the
University.
Today that amphitheater is fast
taking form between Lasuen and
Galvez streets. Back to back with
the new Memorial Theater, it will
be in the center of the proposed art
center.
The amphitheater will seat ap-
proximately 7500 persons, but it can
be made to accommodate more if
necessary. There will be nothing to
suggest that it is a man-made proj-
ect, the stage and bowl being sodded
and naturally irregular.
It will be used for graduation
exercises, outdoor plays and con
certs. Memorial Theater dressing
rooms will be easily accessible from
the stage of the amphitheater, while
the trees clustering around the bowl
will cut off the view of campus
buildings.

required to crane their necks from
bad-angle front seats.
In the auditorium of the adjoining
Little Theater even more foot-room
will be provided, with 39 inches be
tween the backs of the seats. There
will be a rise of 10 inches for each
row, thus providing ideal vision for
each of the 200 possible occupants
of this "perfect little theater."
