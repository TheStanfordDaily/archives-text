# Steel Work To Be Up In Three Weeks
## Class 'A' Building Will Be Ready for Productions by First of Year 
### Jim Hurst 
Erecting and riveting together the
steel skeleton on which the rest of
the building will be "hung" is the
job immediately in progress on the
site of the new theater.
With work moving rapidly now
that the long-delayed steel has ar
rived from Pittsburgh, three weeks
should see the steel framework fin
ished, according to Bob Matheu,
Stanford class of '34, assistant to Job
Superintendent John Leavers.
And by next Christmas, if ev
erything proceeds smoothly, Stan
ford's Memorial Theater should be
ready for its first productions,
Matheu says.
The theater will be an all "Class
A" buildingâ€”all other University
buildings being "Class C." This
means that it will be entirely of steel
and concrete construction, and
classed as earthquake - proof and
fire-proof.
After the steel-work, which really
holds up the weight of the building
in this "sky-scraper" manner of
construction, is completed, the big
job of pouring solid concrete walls
begins.
It will take about four months
to complete this part of the job,
Matheu states, since it is necessary
to build extensive wooden forms
for the concrete first.
Then comes yellowish - brown
plaster on the outside to make the
walls match the rest of the campus
buildings, the customary tile roof,
and all the interior finishing, deco
rating, wiring, and plumbing.
