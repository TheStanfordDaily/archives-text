# Review Genesis Of New Theater
## Student Show, Masque Ball Swell Fund 
### 
With the actual building of the
theater begun, alumni and stu
dents review with interest events
that led to the beginning of the
work.
The original ideal of the Univer
sity authorities for a Memorial The
ater was to build a unit in the Inner
Quad functionally bridging the gap
between the Assembly Hall and the
Little Theater.
Increasing cognizance of the need
for a larger theater to house all cam
pus dramatics finally led to a plan
lor a memorial building.
As a result of generosity on the
part of unsolicited students, the fund
lor the theater grew rapidly. Re
ceipts of a special vaudeville show
produced by all campus dramatic
societies, and the profits of the
Masque Ball contributed materially.
And so, from an original idea for a
comparatively small memorial to
Stanford's war heroes, the Memo
rial Theater has grown out of the
support of the student body.
