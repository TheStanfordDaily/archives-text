## Affair Renovated After Decade Abandonment; Finals Held Tomorrow 
### 
Fifteen men as named by Coach |
Dink Templeton earlier in the week '
will enter the Pacific Coast Confer
j ence track meet at Edwards Field,
Berkeley, with the exception that A1
' Cranston, 440 and relay man, will go \
\ instead of Wally Hardin, whose jav- |
j elin arm is out of order.
Bob Alexander was named as al

first fifteen weakens. Trials in
sprints, hurdles, 440, shot, discus, j
javelin, and broad jump will be i

finals beginning tomorrow after
noon at 2 o'clock.
This year's affair is a renovation
of an intercollegiate meet held a j
decade ago, and is the first ten
i school circus since 1927. Stanford
won that year, so they are in a way ,
defending champs.

Admission to the meet at Ed
wards Field. Berkeley, tomor
row, will be $1.10, with no re
served seats. The meet will he
broadcast over KSFO starting
at 2 o'clock.

Although the U.S.C. "world's
greatest track team" is favored to i
win, Stanford should be in the run- |
ning all afternoon. Principal Card
strength will come in the distance
runs and field events.
Dixon and Nimmo will lead off in
j the mile, both, both with better 1
I times this year than any of their
competitors, although Nimmo's calf
may trouble him some. Jim Angle
J of Washington and George Scharpf
of Oregon will furnish the compcti- I
, tion. Ed Burrows may be pushed to :
record time in the two-mile by
| Freddie Lantz of U.S.C.
Captain Sam Klopstock will race
' old friendsâ€”Cope and Staley of j
! U.S.C. and Moore of Cal. Any can I
j win. Jack Weiershauser and Cran- I
ston will be in a 440 field led by Cal's
; Archie Williams, Nettleton of Wash- !
ington State, a 48.4 man, and Fitch
of U.S.C.
Both Ray Malott and Bill McCur
dy have good chances of winning the
| half, with Ross Bush of the Trojans
and Vic Palmason of Washington all
in the 1:55 class.
Jim Reynolds in the shot seems a
cinch to win, with Phil Levy and
Humbert Smith at even money, i
Levy will continue his match play '
| with Ken Carpenter in the discus,
; while Smith's incentive will come
! from Thurber of the Trojans.
Ray Dean can make or break him
self in his rubber meeting with Foy
Draper of U.S.C. Pollock will be
there too, with Washington's Hay
i and Cougars Humber and Killien
to make things interesting.
Jim Kneubuhl, sprinter, and Leo
Madlem, broad jump, complete the
Stanford delegation. Scoring will be
I 5-3-2-1 in all events except pos
sibly the 400-meter hurdles exhi
bition, status of which will be dis
cussed at a meeting this morning.
