# Dual Control for Lighting
## 
### 
From the vantage point of a slot
in front of the orchestra pit the
chief elecricians will control all
lighting for productions in the main
auditorium of the new theater in a
; dual control system.
Console Control
No encumbering switches and
! rheostats will be needed. "Playing"
j on a control board smaller than the
I console of an organ, the operator
will be master (if all lights in the
house, and also of lights in the ad
joining Little Theater.
He will merely "plug in" the lights
he wants to regulate, much as the
operator "plugs in" a telephone call,
and then produce the effects he
wants by turning little knobs like
radio control dials.
A similar control board be
installed in the projection booth of
the Little Theater, with the capacity
to regulate the lights in either of the
j two theaters.
Stage Width Variable
; An unusual width of 40 feet will
| be provided for the stage opening in
I the main auditorium, and a height

of 30 feet. Adjustable width will
be provided by sliding tower-like
"tormentors" which will move the
apparent sides of the stage opening
toward the center. Lighting equip
ment will slide in with the torment
ers, thus producing a narrowed stage
in every respect.
The stage tower will be 65 feet
high, allowing full-height 30-foot
drops to be drawn completely out of
sight.
Moving Scenery
Wings with 22 feet width on each
side and a stage depth of 50 feet will
allow use of set "wagons" in ad
dition to drops for moving and con
trolling scenery.
With the large available floor
area of the stage these wagons can
be set. up with all the scenery on
them before the performance, and
then sets can be changed by merely
rolling the wagons around.
Production of soybeans in Ala
bama in 1935 increased to 148.000
bushels as compared with 104,000
bushels in 1934.
