# Special Illumination To Assist Classes
## 
### 
Two lighting circuits will be em
ployed in the Memorial Theater to
accommodate both class note-tak
ing and play audiences, according to
completed plans.
High-powered incandescent lamps
will be housed behind ground glass
shields placed in geometric design
in the auditorium ceiling. By the
use of one circuit, the auditorium
can be lit to reading brightness,
and by the use of the other, con
ventional theater dimmers will hold
lighting to any desired brilliancy.
