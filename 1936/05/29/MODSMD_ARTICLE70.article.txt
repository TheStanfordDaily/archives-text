# "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"
## Editorial Page of The Stanford Daily "Co-operation Through Criticism" Just Another Editor's Swan Song 
### 
Dear Jorgi:
Shoveling this farewell guff is one place
where even the old "crusading editors" turned
conventional.
Most all of them, at least as far back as I can
remember, have started their "Dear
edit with the remark that "this will sound like
old stuff," and they were right—it did.
They were all just as exhausted from four
months of wrangling, explaining away butches,
defending editorial stands, reading crack-pot
Campus Opinion letters, and trying to put the
sheet together so the campus would read it,
as I am.
But I can see now how they all had that same
lump in their throat, and and how they rather
hated the prospect of leaving a job that was
never mere than half done, a job that'had given
them more fun, valuable experience, and poten
tial usefulness than anything they had done
before or could reasonably expect to have the
opportunity of doing in many years io come.
I could list many butches and issue ominous
warnings. But the butches probably v/ere even
more apparent to you than they are to me, and
the warnings undoubtedly would fall flat.
So I'll issue a couple of warnings.
Don't take The Daily too seriously, but, more
important, don't take it too lightly. It may not
seem that anyone is reading the paper. But
you'll gradually realize that what you say edi
torially and in your news columns will have
an effect on the campus.
Whether or not it has a desirable effect, or the
effect intended, is up to you and your staff. It
is easy to accept the printed word as law; but
it also is easy to write that law so that it can
be misinterpreted.
Here's another suggestion: Be constructive.
I am just beginning to see what Dr. Wilbur—
who has been aptly described by predecessors
of yours and mine as that understanding per
son in the Ad building who rarely forces advice
on students, but who is always standing by to
give it when solicited—meant recently when
he said:
"You'll get a lot more satisfaction out ot the
few small improvements you, as editor, may
have been in some way responsible for, than
you will from any amount of destructive
criticism."
During Volume 89 we have tried to get out a
paper each morning with a complete picture of
the day before, each paper a panorama of one
day's life at Stanford—with its occasional im
portant or significant news, its constant remind
ers of the sidelights that typify the Farm, its
imported news of the outside world, and its
co-operation with ail campus organizations ra
diated by constructive editorial criticism.
And for helping to carry out this policy, I am
more grateful than it may have seemed be
tween bawling-outs to the staff—and particu
larly to Loren, Dotty, you, and Mac of the edit
board. You've all co-operated with the editor
as whole-heartedly as any bunch of "Daily
minions" I've known.
The policies of Volume 90, and how well they
are administered, are up to you. Take it away—
Sincerely,
—Browney

important, don't take it too lightly. It may not
seem that anyone is reading the paper. But
you'll gradually realize that what you say edi
torially and in your news columns will have
an effect on the campus.
Whether or not it has a desirable effect, or the
effect intended, is up to you and your staff. It
is easy to accept the printed word as law; but
it also is easy to write that law so that it can
be misinterpreted.
Here's another suggestion: Be constructive.
I am just beginning to see what Dr. Wilbur—
who has been aptly described by predecessors
of yours and mine as that understanding per
son in the Ad building who rarely forces advice
on students, but who is always standing by to
give it when solicited—meant recently when
he said:
"You'll get a lot more satisfaction out ot the
few small improvements you, as editor, may
have been in some way responsible for, than
you will from any amount of destructive
criticism."
During Volume 89 we have tried to get out a
paper each morning with a complete picture of
the day before, each paper a panorama of one
day's life at Stanford—with its occasional im
portant or significant news, its constant remind
ers of the sidelights that typify the Farm, its
imported news of the outside world, and its
co-operation with ail campus organizations ra
diated by constructive editorial criticism.
And for helping to carry out this policy, I am
more grateful than it may have seemed be
tween bawling-outs to the staff—and particu
larly to Loren, Dotty, you, and Mac of the edit
board. You've all co-operated with the editor
as whole-heartedly as any bunch of "Daily
minions" I've known.
The policies of Volume 90, and how well they
are administered, are up to you. Take it away—
Sincerely,

Dear Jorgi:
Shoveling this farewell guff is one place
where even the old "crusading editors" turned
conventional.
Most all of them, at least as far back as I can
remember, have started their "Dear
edit with the remark that "this will sound like
old stuff," and they were right—it did.
They were all just as exhausted from four
months of wrangling, explaining away butches,
defending editorial stands, reading crack-pot
Campus Opinion letters, and trying to put the
sheet together so the campus would read it,
as I am.
But I can see now how they all had that same
lump in their throat, and and how they rather
hated the prospect of leaving a job that was
never mere than half done, a job that'had given
them more fun, valuable experience, and poten
tial usefulness than anything they had done
before or could reasonably expect to have the
opportunity of doing in many years io come.
I could list many butches and issue ominous
warnings. But the butches probably v/ere even
more apparent to you than they are to me, and
the warnings undoubtedly would fall flat.
So I'll issue a couple of warnings.
Don't take The Daily too seriously, but, more
important, don't take it too lightly. It may not
seem that anyone is reading the paper. But
you'll gradually realize that what you say edi
torially and in your news columns will have
an effect on the campus.
