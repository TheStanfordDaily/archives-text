By the process of piling 180 units carefully
on top of one another, and forgetting as quickly
as possible the units that lay underneath, 558
men and women are ready to graduate from
Stanford.
Most of them have boon here four years, have
learned that siik dresses and fur coats are not
desirable for Quad wear, that Stanford has the
most autonomous and least interesting student
government of any important university, that
it is not fashionable to laugh at a pun, that San
Francisco becomes immediately fascinating at
the beginning of nightfall, that by some remark
able process Stanford has good football teams,
that a 5-un;t course means that you have a class
five times a week, that it is important to do no
more work than you have to do.
They have learned that the majority is always
right, that the person who can do the fashion
able thing and do it oftenest and best is the
best person.
Nurtured and isolated in a pampering and
well-ordered existence, with meals decided for
them, courses, majors, thinking, eating, and
sleeping ordered for them, thoy have drifted
along for their 180 units' worth.
When they graduate, they will settle down
into jobs which they will get because of "pull"
from friends or relatives, or through the fawn
ing that middle-class America does upon the
wonders that a college education can do. They
will settle down into a pampering and well
ordered existence.
This will be fine. They will be happy. Theirs
will not be the questioning of the disturbed
souls. They have learned the slave morality in
the 20th Century model. They will be indus
trious. They will know definitely the difference

between right and wrong, good and bad, abso
lutely and without qualification. They will be
contented.
It is too bad that the Carnation Milk Company
could not do something with them.
