# That There May Be Honor Among Thieves

### 
Lockers may be broken into, stuff may be
stolen from cars, unlocked rooms may be fatal
to the bankroll in the bureau drawer, but never
theless and however, Stanford has an Honor
Code.
And it is our serious business to uphold that
Code when finals begin.
No joke is the faculty's insistence that we
do it. But less of a joke is the ultimatum of our
own consciences that we observe not only the
Code, but the fundamentals of human honor
which it embodies.
For the Code is no artificial thing, no trumped
up piece of ethical machinery to save the Uni
versity the annoyance and expense of proctor
ing. It was fashioned with care, using as in
struments of enforcement our own credos, not
something injected into us or imposed upon us.
So when we write "No Aid Given or Re
ceived" on the cover of blue-books we know
we can't fill, let us keep that statement true even
if the answers it protects are false.
