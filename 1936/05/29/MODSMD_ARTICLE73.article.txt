# That There May Be A Better Conference
## 
### 
For the first time since 1927, the ten schools
comprising the Pacific Coast Athletic Confer
; ence will hold a combined conference track
meet to settle the Coast track supremacy for
the season.
Tomorrow afternoon at California's Edwards
Field, the ten teams, limited to fifteen members
each, will attempt to put a new life into united
conference track activities.
Officials here, at California, and at U.S.C. all
j favored entrance into the Coast meet, rather
than traveling to participate in the widely pub
licized 1.C.4-A. meet which also will be held
tomorrow in Philadelphia.
Tomorrow's meet, however, will mean more
than a revival of an all-conference meet to the
fifteen Stanford tracksters who are to partici
pate. Again, as in the last meet in 1927, Stanford
and U.S.C. are conceded to be the teams who
will fight for top place. For the Cards, if they
j win, it will mean the climax to a series of three
' conference championships for the past year.
