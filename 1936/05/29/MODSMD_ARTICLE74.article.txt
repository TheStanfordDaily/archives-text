# Our Hasher Sez:

Seeing that taps arc sounding as a result oi the
last issue of The Daily, and the chlorine in the
water, it might be appropriate to tell you guys who
and what I am.
This runs into difficulties, though, when you con
sider that I'll be back again next year, and will have
all that time to tell you the same thing.
Despite the fact that Our Hasher recently got a
promotion from second assistant stooge to first assist
ant stooge, as announced rather blatantly on the
front page, the column will definitely continue under
Ihc same management, with the same lousentious
puns, the same wanderings of a repressed and sub
limated mind.
The Daily hasn't yet worked out a plan as to
who will censor it, so I guess I'll just have to quit
thinking dirty thoughts, or else print them on the
front page as editorials.
Despite the fact that lots of people have too good
an idea of who writes the column, I'll cloak my
identity in the usual secrecy. There's no particular
point, I suppose, in keeping it anonymous, but it's
fun, or is it?
In the forward-looking manner of the whiffle
bird, Our Hashman looks to next year, expecting that
Dcsdcmona will return, that the Gloomy Moor will
do something worthwhile, that Chef Wong, who has
been somewhat forgotten of late, will figure up some
new gags over the summer. There was a rumor that
A Certain Student would come back for a few days to
star in the Gaieties again, but even if he doesn't
there probably will be another Certain Student, and
there will always, brethren, always be, till the end
of time, a Certain Fraternity or Sorority House.
So, gentlemen, in the manner of the American Stu
dent Union, 1 present:
—The United End—
