THE LAST BELLOW
Just what good is a Bull Session?
The answer is "Yes."
Looking over the files of our own
mutual admiration society, we
frequently begrudge the labor of
setting type on work sometimes
patently superficial, often com
pletely at variance with the facts
of our subject.
And we wonder whether it's fair
to the campus, which must read, to

be victims of our
learning to write.
Conventionally,
a last word
should be full of
just such apolo
gies as this, hon
estly meant, but
seasoned by Dear
Reader with just
the slightest]
doubt of our|
sincerity.
So we'll lay

off excuses. This
Bull Sessioner substitutes promises
for next season. His platform has
one plank, no more garbage about
the women (unless they deserve it).

THE LAST BELLOW
Just what good is a Bull Session?
The answer is "Yes."
Looking over the files of our own
mutual admiration society, we
frequently begrudge the labor of
setting type on work sometimes
patently superficial, often com
pletely at variance with the facts
of our subject.
And we wonder whether it's fair
to the campus, which must read, to

be victims of our
learning to write.
Conventionally,
a last word
should be full of
just such apolo
gies as this, hon
estly meant, but
seasoned by Dear
Reader with just
the slightest]
doubt of our|
sincerity.
So we'll lay

off excuses. This
Bull Sessioner substitutes promises
for next season. His platform has
one plank, no more garbage about
the women (unless they deserve it).
