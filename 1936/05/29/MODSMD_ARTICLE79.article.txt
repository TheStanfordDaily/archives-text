# 'Sons O'Guns' Comic Warning Of Future Wars
## 
### 
"SONS O' GUNS," Joe E. Brown's
; latest picture, is funny but it Is
| also significant entertainment. War 1
I is no longer improbable, as it was
. when we laughed at "Shoulder
! Arms" and "Half-Shot at Sunrise," j

and it is hard to >
enjoy whole - heart- \
edly even the most
hilarious scenes of |
"Sons o' Gurus" {
without thinking j
that it may not be i

I long before you're in front of those j
! big guns yourself.
The picture is not insensible to
this new feeling, either. There is
> considerable irony in the sequence â– 
' where Brown captures single-
I handed an entire battalion bccause
I the Germans like him and he likes
1 them, so they decide to stay to
j gether instead of fighting one an
other.

Wo sneaked into the closed re- i
hearsal of "Tlirce Sheets to the
Wind" last night, and have come to
the conclusion that it's going to be
a pretty fancy show.
The plot is mainly concerned
with a Cuban revolution and the
kidnaping of a beautiful heiress.
Mac Gordon and Frank O'Neill
have turned out some really good
tunes, among the best of which are
"Magic of the Moon" and "Count
ing Up to Ten."-'
We'll wager that you'll be pa
triotically singing "All Hail to Mr.
Agrimar" for weeks to come. A
parody of one of the songs, "Ooh
hoo," done by Frances Burks and
Harold Kahn, should give you
plenty of laughs, as should the
finale, which turns out to be well
managed three-ring circus.
