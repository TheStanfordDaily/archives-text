# Brooke Bids Good-By To University
## President Says Stanford Has Greastest Amount Of Self Government 
### 
Wally Brooke, president of the
A.S.S.U. yesterday issued the fol
lowing statement:
"Sometimes, although only rarely,
something happens to a group by
virtue of which it becomes united
and ceases to act only as individuals.
Under these conditions the spirit
transcends the personal limitations,
and the organization has that qual
ity which makes it worthwhile, and
enduring. The Stanford Student
Body is such a group and its stu
dents are a part of what to most
of us Seniors is the finest univer
sity on earth.
"Attendance at the International
Convention of students at Czecho
slovakia, the National Student Fed
eration at Kansas City and four or
five regional meetings of students
and student body presidents, has
driven home very forcefully to me
the idea that we have perhaps the
greatest amount of student self-gov
ernment of the type and set-up
from which other universities can
draw many ideas.
"OiJr faculty administiVition is
very lenient and broadminded at
Stanford, allowing us a chance as
students to supplement our cur
riculum work with outside activity,
which not only is beneficial but a
a real training in experience.
Student Rule's Basis
"Going back to the basis of stu
dent government, I believe our ideal
to be that entirely in keeping with
our American theory of democracy.
If students are to enter the world
after college, well trained for vot
ing and intelligent action as citi
zens, the many programs such as
Debate, Forum activity, Stanford
Speakers' Bureau, Board oi Ath
letic Control, etc, are exceptional
training. It is only when a Univer
sity has a lifeless student body with
no spirit that these activities and
student government ceases to be
worthwhile and a desirable supple
ment to class work.
"It has been my aim this year not
to adopt a 'persecution complex' and
try to up-root many organizations
and traditions, but rather to sen
sibly strengthen those which are
good and allow those which are
rather worthless to die out of their
own accord, except where these or
ganizations definitely conflict with
Stanford's own ideas and what is
fair play.
King, Queen Contest
"The abolishment of the King
and Queen contest with its exces
sive expenditures and the proposed
lowering of the student community
fee for spring quarter, are things
which should, in the long run, more
closely unite us as a student body.
Next year's addition of the New
War Memorial Theater should be
another solidifying factor in our
campus life and will also provide
many more opportunities for extra
curricular activities.
"And so it is with best wishes for
the? coming year that I turn over
to your new student body president,
Jim Reynolds, the office, with the
sincere hope that he tackle the job
with nil the energy nnd intelligence
which I know he possesses."
