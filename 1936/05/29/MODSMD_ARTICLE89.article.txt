Woody Adams, senior class presi

statement to the Class of '36 urging
each member to carry on for Stan
ford in later life and to lake part in
this final period of association before
graduation:

The matriculation of the class of
1936 to Stanford University marked
a new era in Stanford history. The
class of '36, in its four years of par
ticipation in student life, has suc
cessfully contributed its time, pa
tience, and ability toward building
a greater Stanford in a manner of
which the founders of this great in
stitution would be proud, if they
were alive today.
The Class of '36 as a body has ac
complished its end in upholding
Stanford ideals and traditions and
certainly it is leaving record marks
in all student fields of endeavor,
which future classes will do well to
surpass.
The Class of '36 may also point
proudly to the innumerable achieve
ments of its individual members in
athletics, scholarship, and student
government, and to the ability of its
members to conduct themselves as
Stanford men and women.
Senior Week will give this great
class its final opportunity to combine
as a body and to enjoy the last few
hours of association with Stanford
and its people.
I urge every member of '36 to
take advantage of this invaluable
opportunity to meet and talk with
the members of your class, and to
gather a few lasting thoughts and
impressions of your alma mater be
fore you leave. Certainly these
memories will be priceless.
One last request — I hope that
each graduate intends to carry on
for Stanford in your new role as an
alumnus as you have as a student.
No better opportunity is offered you
to enable you to carry on than your
own alumni association. So for your
own welfare and Stanford's, see to
it that you become a member of the
Stanford Alumni Association.
