# Term's Last Daily Sports Two Sections
## 
### 
Last night as Charlie closed
up his forms for the last time this
quarter, Daily minions gathered
for a midnight ice-cream party
and final bull session. The paper
was put to bed, the presses rolled,
and Volume Si), Number 64, was
finished.
Incorporated in this issue arc
two departments, a two-page
theater section and a four-page
senior supplement. In the former,
the history, statistics, prospects
and highlights of Stanford's latest
and most ambitious building item
are reviewed in tabloid.
The senior section chronicles
the doings of the Class of '36,
making honorable mention of
those whose activities have dis
tinguished them on the Farm,
scholastically, athletically, and
otherwise.
