# Job Chances Rated Best In Five Years
## Requests from Large Companies Increases Over 400 per cent This Year 
### 
Do you want a job?

If you do, by any chance, you
have a much better chance than
your predecessor graduates of the
last five years. According to Miss
Ruth Tracksell, of the placement
bureau, job opportunities are much
more in evidence than ever be
fore.
Recruiting by large companies
proves generally a good index of
placement openings. Four hundred
}>er cent more personnel directors
have contacted the University this
year than last. Visits by these em
ployers are accompanied by per
sonal interviews with candidates
and complete surveys of records.
Asking mainly for men and women
with technical training, the em
ployers also ask for "people to
train."
General Training Needed
Representatives of national or
ganizations continue to look for men
of general training, offering posi
tions of minor administrative" work.
Many requests come for men who
have potential sales ability. And
offers of jobs include salaries, not
just commission work.
Out of the 550 June seniors, ap
proximately 200 have made up their
minds to go to graduate school,
either here or elsewhere. Another
100 have finished registration with
the employment service, while an
other 100 are in the process of
registration. The final 150 are var
ied, some having jobs through their
own connections, others planning to
travel, and others having no plans.
One-third Have Jobs
Approximately a third of the reg
istered seniors will have perma
nent jobs lined up by graduation,
Miss Tracksell predicted. The rest,
if they are really trying, will have
jobs by the end of the summer.
From last year's records, all of the
graduating seniors who registered
in the placement bureau have been
placed.
Employers, in asking for applica
tions, consider the following things
in looking for employees: courses
taken, with records made; extra
curricular activities, important be
cause they show leadership; past
job list, showing self-reliance; gen
eral background, furnished from
University records; and skills, in
cluding typing ability, shorthand,
and secretarial knowledge. This
information is given either on the
student's request, or upon the of
fice's initiative.
Specific positions that have been
offered through the service by vis
its from employers are: engineers—
all types including chemical and
geological — accountants, banking
clerks, real estate salesmen; office
work—including shorthand and typ
ing—for both men and women,

One-third Have Jobs
Approximately a third of the reg
istered seniors will have perma
nent jobs lined up by graduation,
Miss Tracksell predicted. The rest,
if they are really trying, will have
jobs by the end of the summer.
From last year's records, all of the
graduating seniors who registered
in the placement bureau have been
placed.
Employers, in asking for applica
tions, consider the following things
in looking for employees: courses
taken, with records made; extra
curricular activities, important be
cause they show leadership; past
job list, showing self-reliance; gen
eral background, furnished from
University records; and skills, in
cluding typing ability, shorthand,
and secretarial knowledge. This
information is given either on the
student's request, or upon the of
fice's initiative.
Specific positions that have been
offered through the service by vis
its from employers are: engineers—
all types including chemical and
geological — accountants, banking
clerks, real estate salesmen; office
work—including shorthand and typ
ing—for both men and women,
sales jobs, merchandising, insur
ance salesmen, credit work, and
advertising.
Do you want a job?

If you do, by any chance, you
have a much better chance than
your predecessor graduates of the
last five years. According to Miss
Ruth Tracksell, of the placement
bureau, job opportunities are much
more in evidence than ever be
fore.
Recruiting by large companies
proves generally a good index of
placement openings. Four hundred
}>er cent more personnel directors
have contacted the University this
year than last. Visits by these em
ployers are accompanied by per
sonal interviews with candidates
and complete surveys of records.
Asking mainly for men and women
with technical training, the em
ployers also ask for "people to
train."
General Training Needed
Representatives of national or
ganizations continue to look for men
of general training, offering posi
tions of minor administrative" work.
Many requests come for men who
have potential sales ability. And
offers of jobs include salaries, not
just commission work.
Out of the 550 June seniors, ap
proximately 200 have made up their
minds to go to graduate school,
either here or elsewhere. Another
100 have finished registration with
the employment service, while an
other 100 are in the process of
registration. The final 150 are var
ied, some having jobs through their
own connections, others planning to
travel, and others having no plans.
