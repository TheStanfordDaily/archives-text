# New Theater Concrete Pouring Starts
## 
### 
With concrete pouring scheduled to
I begin today, Stanford's new $587,000
Memorial Hall, housing the long
i hoped-for new theater, little theater,
i and facilities for a School of the
Theater, comes one step nearer to
completion.
The new theater, located northeast !
â–  of the Quad between the; Board of J
i Athletic Control building and the i
! English corner, is expected to be ready
I for occupancy at (he beginning of win- ,
I tor quarter next January.
The main auditorium will seat 1500,
but by a special arrangement, metal j
curtains can be lowered to cut off the j
balcony, thus reducing the size to 800,
j and further curtains can be lowered I
! cutting down the seating capacity still i
! more to 500 capacity. Luxurious, fully i
upholstered opera chairs will be in
stalled as seats.
Little Theater
In addition to the main auditorim, [
there will be a little theater seating j
200. This will be located at light an- ;
gles to the main auditorium and so
arranged as to make use of the end of
the main stage block. Scenery for i
| both auditoriums can be flown into j
j the fly gallery. Both auditoriums will I

also be equipped with projection rooms i
and the latest type sound motion pic
ture projectors.
Lighting in the new (heater will be
controlled from a small portable con
sole, through thyratron indirect con
trol tubes. This will enable the elec
j trician to sit in the "'prompter's box" '
| in front of (he footlights. The con
i sole can also be moved into the little
theater.
Outdoor Amphitheater
Also under construction is an out-
I door amphitheater to be located in
i the rear of the new Memorial Hall,
j This will seat 7500 persons, and will be
used for graduation and other outdoor
i pageants. The natural, sodded stage
will have easy access to the dressing
! rooms of the Memorial Hall, and por- !
, table lighting equipment can be moved i
! out from the new theater and con- j<
| trolled from the portable control con
j sole.
Tentative plans are being made for
' a new School of the Theater to take
| advantage of the superb dramatic fa
| cilities which the new theater will give
| to Stanford. This new school, if es-
I tablished, would make Stanford one j

of the outstanding dramatic study cen
ters of the country.
15 Years of Effort
Construction of the new Memorial
Hall climaxes more than 15 years of
effort to provide adequate theater fa
cilities for the University. It is made
possible through the $180,000 War Me
morial Fund, with the majority of the
financing being done by the Associated
Students, approximately $2 per stu
dent per quarter of the community
fees going toward construction of the
theater. The debt is expected to be
amortized in 20 years. Because of the
great amount of student funds going
into its construction, Memorial Hall is
truly a student project.
Efforts of numerous Daily and Cha
parral campaigns for the building were
brought to fruition when construction
was started last fall. Members of the
finally successful theater committee
include former student body Presi
dents Marvin Kahn and Wallie Brooke,
former Student Manager Ben Cave,
former Ex Committee Member Helen
Hay, Professor Paul Holden, Phil
Brown, stage technician, and Daily
Managing Editor Annalee Whitmore.
