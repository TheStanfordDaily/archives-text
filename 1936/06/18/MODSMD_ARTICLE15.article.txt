# Summer Stanford
## 
### 
' It is no fable thai Stanford is, in a good many ways, at its best
during the summer. The University conducts its summer session
as a part of the regular academic year, admitting none hut those
who qualify for regular university admission and exercising the
same standards of scholarship as always,
Stanford welcomes students who, because of participation in
active life during the winter months, find it possible to attend only
in the summer. Stanford also welcomes those who come to take
advantage'of the research facilities and those undergraduates who
have found out that there can exist a happy medium between pro
ductive slimmer work toward a degree and adequate recreation for
a not too'strenuous summer.
To enhance the intellectual facilities of the University arc the
many/great scholars who have come from the important institutions
of thlp world to spend the summer here.
Always, there is the Hoover War Library, the most complete
collection of World War historical material anywhere.
For those interested in dramatics, both from a professional
point of view and from an educational standpoint, there is the
course in Stage ('lassies Production.
Summer university work does not necessarily mean the depri
vation of the many recreational activities that ordinarily feature
this season. Nearby are the Pacific beaches and to the east are
Yosemitp and the mountain lake resorts. Palo Alto and surround
ing country is a most attractive and comfortable place in which to
spend the summer. And there are the many points of interest in
the San Francisco Bay area, which three years fom now will attract
thousands of visitors for an international exposition.
Besides all these advantages. Stanford is at its best during the
summer because it is a university with a more mature student body.
Sum infer Stanford is a quieter, less bustling place. There is a peace
upon the campus that bespeaks of an older, but not less keen, gen
eration breathing more deeply and leisurely of the life around it.
And this, perhaps, is as it should be.â€” I). B.
