Express and Stagecoach Days in Cali
fornia. By Oscar O. Winther. The
Stanford University Press.
The story of how the discovery of
gold in the mill race of Sutter's new
mill at Coloma transformed life in
California has often been told.
Much has been written of the stage
coach robberies and gun play, of the
highly dramatic incidents of life in
this new region; for, when a slowly
developing, pastoral section of the
country, separated from the rest by
plains, deserts, and mountains, sud
denly comes to life, so to speak, and
its population, infected with the gold
fever, jumps from 14,000 in 1848 to
300,000 in 1860, there is bound to be
much that is spectacular to report.
A Fundamental Story
But there is a more fundamental i
story to be told, and it does not lack ;
the dramatic. It has remained for f
Dr. Winther to write the historically
accurate account of the express and j
stagecoach business as such, with |
emphasis on its place in the economic |
and social life of the people of Cali
fornia.
He tells how and why the express
business began and developed until
at one time there were almost 300
companies in operation; how Wells, !
Fargo and Company forged to the :
front as the leader; how at length ]
Adams and Company failed. He re- !
cords the development of the stage
coach business from the time the first
line was established between San
Francisco and San Jose until service
was offered to all parts of the state
and finally to Portland, Oregon; he
describes the organization of the Cali- !
fornia Stage Company, the second !
largest in the United States.
Personalities stand out all through
the book; and the express and stage- ;
coach business appears as the vital
factor that it was—a channel for the [
pulsating life of this new country.
Dr. Winther's story loses nothing
in the telling. Here is California his- i
tory, factual, lively, colorful; docu
mented so that those who so desire
can read more extensively on any
phase of special interest. The period
covered, up to 1860, at the end of which
the stagecoach business became a part
of the national system rather than a I
local or sectional enterprise, has not !
been adequately reported before.

its population, infected with the gold
fever, jumps from 14,000 in 1848 to
300,000 in 1860, there is bound to be
much that is spectacular to report.
A Fundamental Story
But there is a more fundamental i
story to be told, and it does not lack ;
the dramatic. It has remained for f
Dr. Winther to write the historically
accurate account of the express and j
stagecoach business as such, with |
emphasis on its place in the economic |
and social life of the people of Cali
fornia.
He tells how and why the express
business began and developed until
at one time there were almost 300
companies in operation; how Wells, !
Fargo and Company forged to the :
front as the leader; how at length ]
Adams and Company failed. He re- !
cords the development of the stage
coach business from the time the first
line was established between San
Francisco and San Jose until service
was offered to all parts of the state
and finally to Portland, Oregon; he
describes the organization of the Cali- !
fornia Stage Company, the second !
largest in the United States.
Personalities stand out all through
the book; and the express and stage- ;
coach business appears as the vital
factor that it was—a channel for the [
pulsating life of this new country.
Dr. Winther's story loses nothing
in the telling. Here is California his- i
tory, factual, lively, colorful; docu
mented so that those who so desire
can read more extensively on any
phase of special interest. The period
covered, up to 1860, at the end of which
the stagecoach business became a part
of the national system rather than a I
local or sectional enterprise, has not !
been adequately reported before.

Express and Stagecoach Days in Cali
fornia. By Oscar O. Winther. The
Stanford University Press.
The story of how the discovery of
gold in the mill race of Sutter's new
mill at Coloma transformed life in
California has often been told.
Much has been written of the stage
coach robberies and gun play, of the
highly dramatic incidents of life in
this new region; for, when a slowly
developing, pastoral section of the
country, separated from the rest by
plains, deserts, and mountains, sud
denly comes to life, so to speak, and
its population, infected with the gold
fever, jumps from 14,000 in 1848 to
300,000 in 1860, there is bound to be
much that is spectacular to report.
