Twenty years ago Ray Lyman Wil
bur was inaugurated as President of
Stanford University. To commemorate '
the occasion Stanford University Press
has just published his new book, I
"Stanford Horizons: Selected Ad
dresses, 1916-1935."

Members of the faculty and the stu
dents who have heard President Wil
bur speak need not be reminded of the
interest and liveliness, of the keen
insight and analysis that make his
addresses of lasting appeal. Most of
them are as timely today as when they
were first written, as is illustratd by
the following quotations:
"Education is an artificial process
which we apply td the human machine
in the hope of broadening the scope
of its usefulness. It is an attempt to I
make every man something far be
yond a mere vegetable turning water
and gas into food, food into tissue and
energy, until age slows and finally
stills the process."
"Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere sell-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about !

you. Make your participation count
in the upbuilding of your surround
ings. It is better to build bricks into
a firm foundation than to keep them
loose to throw about on occasion."
"Some wars have been brought
about! but most of
them are due to what we might call
glandular thinking. They result from
emotional storms based usually upon
fear. War is the supreme tragedy
coming from failure to understand.
This failure to understand comes
largely from lack of information and
appreciation of ths other man's or
other nation's point of view."

"Our traditions survive automati
cally if they are worthy. University
and college taboos and habits should
be regularly inspected to see whether
they can stand the intelligence tests."
