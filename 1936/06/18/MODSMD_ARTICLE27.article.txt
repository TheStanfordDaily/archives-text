# Course in Atomic Structure
## 
### 
Dr. George Gamow of George Wash
ington University, an outstanding au
thority in the theory of structures of
atomic nuclei, will offer a course in the
theory of nuclear structure in the
physics department this summer. Dr.
Gamow, who gave the first explanation
of the disintegration of radioactive ele
ments by which he connected the phe
nomenon wi}h the laws of wave me
chanics, has the Ph.D. degree from the
University of Leningrad and has studied
in the Universities of Goettingen, Co
penhagen, and Cambridge. He was a
professor in the Academy of Sciences
at Leningrad and a special lecturer at
the Universities of Paris, London, and
Michigan.
Courses in mathematics are to be
given by Dr. Rudolph Ernest Langer,
professor of mathematics at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin since 1927 and
this year acting professor at Harvard.
