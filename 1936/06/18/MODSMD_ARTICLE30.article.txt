and practice in acting, directing, cos
tumes and stage design, will offer a
course in Business of the Theater,
taught by George Z. Wilson, former
instructor in public speaking at Stan

ness of the Theater course will be
unique in that it will cover manage
ment, publicity, sales and accounting,
aspects of the theater not usually
treated in university dramatics courses.
Rounding out the summer's activity
in Stage Classics will be the Tudor
Lecture series, various concerts ap
propriate to the Tudor period, as well
as exhibits in the Art Gallery and
Library.
Altogether, the course is calculated
to provide instruction and experience
in dramatics for those interested in
the field both educationally and pro
fessionally.
Summer is rapidly becoming estab
lished as the season for extensive
work in university dramatics, both lo
cally and nationally.
The production of two plays, Shake
speare's '"Antony and Cleopatra" and
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," in
mid-August will be the culmination
of Stanford's summer quarter work in
the course in Stage Classics Produc
tion. The course and the play produc
tion follow a successful precedent set
last summer quarter, when a campus
production of "Othello" won the ac
claim of Peninsula audiences and San
Francisco critics.
