# 1025 Students Given Degrees At Ceremony
## Commencement Talk Is Made by Dr. Durand In Memorial Chapel 
### 
Addressing 1,025 candidates for de
grees in the Stanford Memorial Church
Sunday, Dr. William F. Durand, emeri
tus professor of mechanical engineer
ing, discussed some of the outstanding
problems of the present day civili
zation.
"Have we grown in wisdom in the
use of the products of modern science
and technology commensurate with the
change in conditions which these new
discoveries and inventions have brought
about?" he asked.
Answer Is Given
His answer was that so far civiliza
tion has lagged in this wisdom, but
"unless we are recreant to every sense
of obligation, to every impulse toward
the fulfillment of what we call duty,
we are going on with the work which
our forbears started some 50,000 or
more years ago."
Of the 1,025 candidates, there were
700 who received bachelor's degrees
and 325 who received advanced de
grees.
Because of his illness, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur was unable to deliver
his address to the graduating class.
But Professor Edgar E. Robinson,
chairman of the committee on public
exercises, read his message.
Everything Planned
In part he said: "You have taken
much that you found here for granted.
As you leave us you are beginning to
sense that someone had to plan every
thing you see about you. A university
comes from a myriad of builders of
the past and of today. Each one was
on a trail that led somewhere, and each
was a builder.
"Some years ago I was driving alone
in the early evening along an unfre
quented road of the upper Sacramento
Valley. As I passed a man carrying a
heavy pack on his shoulders, I stopped
to give him a lift; but to my invitation
he responded, 'No, thankee, I ain't in
no hurry. I ain't goin' anywhere.'
We want you to be going some
where, and to carry your share of the
common load. You have learned here
something of honor among men and
women, of fairness, of tolerance of the
rights of others. You cannot fail if you
iollow these guiding principles and
keep your aims high and your trail
clean."

heavy pack on his shoulders, I stopped
to give him a lift; but to my invitation

We want you to be going some
where, and to carry your share of the
common load. You have learned here
something of honor among men and
women, of fairness, of tolerance of the
rights of others. You cannot fail if you

Addressing 1,025 candidates for de
grees in the Stanford Memorial Church
Sunday, Dr. William F. Durand, emeri
tus professor of mechanical engineer
ing, discussed some of the outstanding
problems of the present day civili
zation.
"Have we grown in wisdom in the
use of the products of modern science
and technology commensurate with the
change in conditions which these new
discoveries and inventions have brought
about?" he asked.
Answer Is Given
His answer was that so far civiliza
tion has lagged in this wisdom, but
"unless we are recreant to every sense
of obligation, to every impulse toward
the fulfillment of what we call duty,
we are going on with the work which
our forbears started some 50,000 or
more years ago."
Of the 1,025 candidates, there were
700 who received bachelor's degrees
and 325 who received advanced de
grees.
Because of his illness, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur was unable to deliver
his address to the graduating class.
But Professor Edgar E. Robinson,
chairman of the committee on public
exercises, read his message.
Everything Planned
In part he said: "You have taken
much that you found here for granted.
As you leave us you are beginning to
sense that someone had to plan every
thing you see about you. A university
comes from a myriad of builders of
the past and of today. Each one was
on a trail that led somewhere, and each
was a builder.
"Some years ago I was driving alone
in the early evening along an unfre
quented road of the upper Sacramento
Valley. As I passed a man carrying a
heavy pack on his shoulders, I stopped
to give him a lift; but to my invitation
he responded, 'No, thankee, I ain't in
no hurry. I ain't goin' anywhere.'

where, and to carry your share of the
common load. You have learned here
something of honor among men and
women, of fairness, of tolerance of the
