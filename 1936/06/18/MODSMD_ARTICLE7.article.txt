# Mears Tells Of Attractions For Quarter
## Welcome Is Extended To Faculty Members, Incoming Students 
### 
The many attractions of summer j
quarter at Stanford are pointed out |
by Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director, in the !
following statement of welcome to stu
dents and staff:
"Upon behalf of the University com- j
murity, it is again my distinct privilege i
to extend a welcome to the students !
and staff of our summer quarter. Our
sincere wish is that you may feel at j
home from the time you register until |
your course of study Is completed.
Unusual Opportunity
"The summer quarter here offers an |
unusual and worthwhile opportunity |
for combined study, recreation, and en- ,
tertainment. The session of nearly J
eleven weeks, with a shorter period j
available for teachers enrolled in the !
School of Education, provides a unique i
chance for students to make progress |
and gain time, scholastically, under!
conditions which offer superior aca- j
demic facilities.
"Without the distractions of under- j
graduate organized outside activities,
the summer quarter lists courses in
most fields of knowledge with special j
emphasis, moreover, upon advanced in- j
struction.
"The addition of a large and distin- j
guished staff of visiting professors (
brings us into contact with men of dif- :
ferent experiences, fresh viewpoints,
and experts in special subjects. This
distinctive feature of our summer quar- |
ter, which should attract students, is 1
not appreciated adequately by Stanford
men and women registered during the
autumn, winter, and spring quarters.
Smaller Classes
"Not only is it possible for qualified '
persons to enroll for these courses, but |
also smaller classes and more intimate |
contact with visiting and regular fac- j
ulty personnel are distinct advantages, j
"Strong mention also should be made
of the opportunity to hear lecturers by 1

these notable visitors upon topics in
which they are notable authorities. The
Thursday Evening series is designed
for this purpose. In the past, too few
persons at. the University or in the vi
cinity have taken advantage of this.
"Other weekly public exercises this
summer arc the Tuesday Evening se
ries, with a varied program of enter
tainment, the Tudor Series in connec
tion with the work on Stage Classics
Production on Wednesday evenings,
the Sunday morning services, the organ
recitals on Sunday evening and Thurs
day afternoon, and public exercises to
be noted in the semi-weekly edition of
the Stanford Daily.
"These functions are usually offered
without regular admission charge. It
is only through regular and careful
perusal of the Stanford Daily that one
can find out what interests him.
