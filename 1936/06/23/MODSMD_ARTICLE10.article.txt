# Play Tryouts To Be Held Thursday Night
## 
### 
Tryouts for the two plays to bo pre
sented during the summer quarter by
the course in Stage Classics Produc
tion will begin on Thursday evening
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Shakespeare's tragedy, "Antony and
Cleopatra" and George Bernard
Shaw's satiric comedy, "Caesar and
Cleopatra," have been selected as
contrasted treatments of a common
theme.
Chance for Beginners
The tryouts will be open to all per
sons interested. It is suggested that
tryoutees re-read the plays in advance
to familiarize themselves with the
characters and the plots of each play.
Since both plays demand casts of sub
stantial size, there will be opportuni
ties for beginners as well as amateurs
of experience.
The staff of the course met last Sun
day to read the versions of each play
which have been prepared for these
productions. Both plays have been cut
to fit into average running time.
Scenes Arranged
Under the direction of Carroll Alex
ander, scenic designer and technical
director," the Assembly Hall is already
being altered in preparation for the
two productions. A large set of stairs
has been built from the apron of the
stage to the floor of the hall as a por
tion of the permanent setting which
Mr. Alexander has designed for the
plays.
Copies of the cut versions of both
the plays have been placed in the
English 200 offices of the directors,
Robert Brauns and James Sandoe.
Additional copies of the full scripts for
cutting may be obtained at the Book
store. The Tudor text is to be used for
making the acting script of "Antony
and Cleopatra" and a separately bound
copy of Shaw's comedy for that of
"Caesar and Cleopatra."

Tryouts will be held under the su
pervision of the directors who expect
to have both casts completed by the
middle of next week. For this purpose
additional tryout sessions will be held
next week.
