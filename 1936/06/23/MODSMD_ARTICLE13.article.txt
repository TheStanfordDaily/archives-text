## 
### 
In issuing a warning to visiting sum- |
mer quarter students regarding the
traffic problems on the campus, Gordy
Davis, officer for the campus, pointed
out the several danger spots apt to be
found in driving about Stanford.
"During the past six years all fatal
! campus automobile accidents and a
i majority of less serious accidents have j
occurred on Palm Drive," said Davis in |
j pointing out the real danger spots of |
| the University grounds.
The inadequacy of roads on the cam
pus was given by Officer Davis as the
| real reason for present-day problems.
This, he showed, is a result of the rapid
■ changes in motor transportation.
4 "One of the University's greatest I

! problems is parking. In the summer,
autoists head for available shade,
whether or not it is a parking space,"
remarked the officer.
In listing the "bad spots" for the
Stanford driver, Davis expressed the
hope that the summer students would
co-operate with him in keeping arrests
| to the minimum.
Here they are, watch out for them:
1. Palm Drive; the side-streets are
J very dangerous.
2. The' parked cars in front of the
, B.A.C. present a real hazard to drivers
on that street.
3. The parking limit around the Post
Office in combination with the many
I narrow streets makes a real problem.

"Traffic violators," said Mr. Davis,
"are given reasonable fines for the first
offense, but are given double levies
for additional arrests."
In connection with petty violations,
Davis mentioned overtime parking,
exceeding the 20-mile limit on the Row
and about the Quad, parking in front
of walks near the Memorial Court and
the Library, and failing to observe ar
terial stops, as the most frequent
causes for apprehension.
Officer Gordon Davis disseminated
the above from his black and white
Ford V 8 coupe, a car so familiar to
campus residents. Davis is in his sev
