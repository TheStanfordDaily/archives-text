# Black Emotions and the Legion
## 
### 
The Black Legion, secret hooded society exposed in Michigan,
has drawn national attention to its violent methods of "preserving
American institutions."
The preservation of American institutions, founded upon the
eighteenth century rationalism, can never he accomplished by such
methods nor through the dark emotionalism and impatience that
inspires th,em. The greatest of American institutions have been
founded upon the one plank that Ihc citizen can think for himself
:ind act legally to protect his institutions.
To inspire fear, to whip citizens, and to murder them are the
outcome of cowardice or a dishonest heart. Or both.
The violence which these hooded cowards used and the methods
they perpetuate are found from time to lime in other parts of the
country. Chicago saw its clans of yeggs with their "typewriters."
Even California has known of the vigilantes and the lynchers.
This appeal to the emotions of hatred and fear is the tool of j
revolutionaries and of rabid reactionaries. It is a tool particularly
adapted to Ihe radio—our national soap box. Nevertheless the emo
tional appeal is a challenge to thinkers and thoughtful citizens.
Let us watch it in the present election, and judge accordingly. |
