SEATTLE, Wash., June 22.—Four
teen chemical elements, and perhaps j
more, are absolutely essential to the
growth of the higher plants, accord
ing to recent experiments made with

the soil in water cultures. It was
previously believed that but ten of
these chemicals were necessary, al
though the presence of others was also I
known.
These points were brought forth in j
a paper read to the recent meeting ;
here of the Pacific Division, American
Association for the Advancement of |
Science, by Dr. D. R. Hoagland, pro
fessor of plant nutrition in the Uni- !
