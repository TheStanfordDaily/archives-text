# Series Begins Interpretation Of Schubert
## 
### 
Classic formality, reminiscent of
Franz Schubert's piano sonatas and
replete with exquisite tunes, domi
nated the South Mountain Ensemble's
playing of the first in a series of Schu
bert chamber music, last Friday af
ternoon in the Memorial Church.
Opening with the Trio in B Flat,
well did the performers realize some
of the hope that is expressed in Schu
bert's epitaph:
"Music has here entombed a rich
treasure, but much fairer hopes."
Beautiful in its gravity yet there
was that in the Trio which definitely
expressed hope.
Fantasie in C Major
The violin and piano "Fantasie in
C Major" was much more interesting.
Here the formality was partly aban
doned and the composition shaped
into a more romantic and free form.
Starting with the slow melodious pas
sage, the mood changed to a more
quickly moving section in a rather
brilliant canonical style. The andan
tino movement was a theme with va
riations, the variations being accom
plished by adding embellishments to
the theme rather than by any serious
harmonic alterations.
Brilliant Finale
In the short Adagio which followed,
Schubert recapitulated to the theme
of the first movement and then went
immediately into the finale in which
some new thematic material was de
veloped. After a short repetition of
the theme of the valuations movement
the finale came to a fast and brilliant
close.
The C Major Quintet which ended
the program is described as "the
greatest chamber music ever written
by Schubert." It called for a second
violoncello in addition to the usual in
struments of the quartet. Reverence,
grandeur, and eloquence marked its
presentation.—Review by G. W.
