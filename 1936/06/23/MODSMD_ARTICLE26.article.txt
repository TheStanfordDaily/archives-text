# Radio Speaker Urges War On Tuberculosis
## Dr. Philip Pierson Describes Conditions and Tells How New Tests Aid in Combat 
### 
Professor Philip Hale Pierson of the
School of Medicine explained the
growing importance of the tuberculin
test in combatting thiij disease during
his speech on the Stanford Radio Pro
gram last night over KGO.
"By tuberculin testing we find the
case before symptoms have arisen and
when either treatment or observation
will keep that person well." An im
portant part of that program is to find
the infecting source, human or bovine,
and break the contact." Dr. Pierson
also pointed out the value of the test
in halting the unnecessary spread of
tuberculosis throughout the country.
Modern Methods
He continued by stating that medi
cine no longer sits back to wait for
the disease to appear, but rather, it
goes out after tuberculosis and dis
covers and treats it by modern meth
ods. Since cattle play such a large part
in spreading the infection, the vital
step in furthering human health and
happiness is to eliminate tuberculous
cattle.
Tuberculosis death rates are still
highest between the ages of 14 and 25.
According to the speaker, the ques
tion which inevitably arises is "Where
did this boy or girl, going to one of
our schools or colleges, receive this in
fection?" As an answer to this query,
Dr. Pierson remarked that "The family
is examined and perhaps someone en
tirely unconscious of the fact that he
has tuberculosis and is a distributing
source is found, isolated, and treated,
and when it is safe, returned to so
ciety."
Universities Active
Stanford University, the University
of California, and the University of
Washington are numbered among the
western universities which can boast
of good health services with active
tuberculosis programs, and at
schools the students are studied with
the idea in mind of throwing some
light on such "contributing factors as
study, self-support, athletics, health
services as given by our universities
and the development of tuberculosis."
"Each locality must discover and
solve its individual tuberculosis infec
tions; different schools within a city
have different amounts of tuberculo
sis, depending on certain social and
racial factors, and colleges in rural
districts have a lower incidence than
where the undergraduates come from
the crowded urban communities."
He concluded by saying, "By the
diligent search outlined above, human
tuberculosis will be still further re
duced and health and happiness will
take the place of sickness and sorrow."
