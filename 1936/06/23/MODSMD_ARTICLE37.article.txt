### 
After several months of research and
experiment, the Stanford University
Press through its manager, Mr. Will A.
Friend, announces the perfection of a
device for aligning typewriter print on
both the right and left hand sides of
the column.
The device, a very simple attach
ment for any standard or large type
writer, operates for any margin from
two and a half inches to the maximum
width of the margin and makes adjust
ment for ragged edges within seven
units on the right hand.
Aside from its use in the publishing
and newspaper fields, the device will
probably have a wide use in business
offices and duplication services where
mimeographs are being used.
The cost of the device will be nomi
nal. Where offset printing is being
used, the typewriter will be able to do
away with metal composition in certain
kinds of work. Illustrations can be
"shot" with the type and local pic
tures and advertisements can be run at
almost no additional cost.
The inventor of the new machine for
the University Press is Mr. Sergei M.
Toman.
