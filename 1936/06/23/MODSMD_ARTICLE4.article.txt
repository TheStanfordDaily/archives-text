# New Stanford Scales Weigh Mother Earth
## 
### 
Archimedes said that if he had a
lever long enough and a fulcrum he
could move the earth—but he never
said that he could weigh it accurately.
But now comes Professor William
Hansen of the Stanford Physics de
partment with a gadget that weighs
the whole world. In round numbers,
the world would weigh, ring - side—
10,000,000,000.000,000,000,000,000 pounds.
Professor Hansen's device is an im
provement upon a similar device in
vented originally by Henry Cavendish,
noted English physicist and chemist,
in 1789. Since then but little has been
done to improve the machine.
Professor Hansen's contrivance looks
like a dumbbell suspended in a vac
uum by a fine fiber. But it is so
highly sensitive that a force of only
.000000000044 pounds—which is about
equal to feeble kick of a mosquito
after a hard night's work—will cause
a spot of light in the gadget to move
six inches.
A wind blowing one inch in two
weeks would deflect the device con
siderably, Professor Hansen says.
The gravitational attraction between
an adjacent shot-put-sized lead ball
and one end of the suspended ball
causes the rod to turn, which accom
plishes the big-time weighing-in.
