# Mears Tells Of European Trip
## Heavy Budgets Show Fear Of Future Uncertainty 
### 
Professor E. G. Mears, director of the
summer quarter, has just returned
from a short trip to Europe. During
his visit he toured the British Isles
and traveled in Scandinavia.

According to Professor Mears, "the
unexpected victory of Mussolini in
Abyssinia and the weakened position
of the League of Nations have thrown
into discard the carefully laid plans of
the great powers."
He considers the European outlook
to be one of uncertainty and fear of
war with Hitler holding the key to
the events of the future. Professor
Mears believes that the clue to the
situation abroad is to be found in
the budgets of the leading European
countries, heavily burdened as they
are with the costs of rearmament.
"The changing international situa
tion is affecting profoundly domestic
affairs abroad. Every country is con
fronted with the problem of maintain
ing a decent economic existence in a
world which is exceedingly national
istic," Professor Mears finds.
Everywhere he went he found per
sons interested in the New Deal ex
periment although the majority felt
that the cost, involved would make any
similar attempt impossible in the more
settled European nations.
' Professor Mears watched the run
ning of this year's Derby and at
tended sessions of the House of Com
mons and the Irish Free State Dail.
While abroad he met many professors
who have previously taught here dur
ing the summer. Professor Mears
sailed home on the S.S. "Manhattan."
