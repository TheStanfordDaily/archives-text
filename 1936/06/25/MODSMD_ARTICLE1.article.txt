# Gray Contrasts Julius Caesar Of Dramatists
## Shakespeare's Julius Caesar Pompous, Vain; Shaw's Is Great Despite Blundering 
### 
Contrast in the character of Julius
Caesar as treated by two of the out
standing dramatists of their times—
Shakespeare and -Shaw—was the sub
ject matter of the first of the Tudor
series of summer lectures as presented
by Professor Henry David Gray last
night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Quoting Dr. Gray, "It is curious that
each should take the same historical
character and present him in two such
different ways. Shaw's Caesar is in
every particular the exact opposite
of Shakespeare's, yet I don't think that
Mr. Shaw did this on purpose.
"Shakespeare's Julius Caesar has
all the outward appearance of majesty
but on closer inspection he appears as
a pompous and vain man with no real
greatness. Shaw's Julius Caesar is on
the surface a rather commonplace per
son, unimpressive in appearance, fa
miliar in his manner, easy-going, even
blundering and a trifle absurd. Yet un
derneath it all you realize that the man
is really great."
Reads Selections
Dr. Gray read selections from both
Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" and
Shaw's "Julius Caesar" to illustrate
this difference. He asked why it was
that the greatest man in history should
have been held up to ridicule by the
greatest man in literature. The answer
he said might be found in theatrical
conditions of the time.
"Shakespeare wrote to suit the needs
of his company and in the play "Julius
Caesar" he had in Brutus, Cassius, and
Antony three great parts for Bur
bage and the next two actors in the
company who could do serious parts.
For the role of Julius Caesar he may
have realized that he would have to
make use of the greatest comedian,
William Kemp, and so wrote the part
in a way that Kemp would like."
Reach Same Conclusion
However, contrastingly though they
may have depicted this great charac
ter, both Shakespeare and Shaw
reached very much the same conclu
sion, the lecturer declared. Both
showed that it is not the outward ap
pearance but the inner reality that
counts.
"Shaw makes this idea one of his
chief principles in other plays as well
—in 'You Never Can Tell,' 'Arms and
the Man,' and in fact in nearly all his
dramas."
The speaker went on to discuss the
character of Octavius Caesar in Shake
speare's "Antony and Cleopatra," and
Antony as he appears in "Julius Cae
sar" and the later play. He said of
"Antony and Cleopatra" that it was
one of the greatest of Shakespeare's
plays although one of the most infre
quently performed.
The second in the series of the Tu
dor Lectures will be .given next Wed
nesday evening at 8 o'clock.
