# Dr. Prokosch Proud Of Huge Great Dane
## 
### 
Dr. Eduard Prokosch, acting pro
fessor of Gorman and noted philolo
gist, who will lecture tonight in the
Women's Clubhouse, is proud of his
massive Great Dane which accom
panies him on the Quad.
"Rolf would soon die if we were
separated," Dr. Prokosch declared.
To prevent Rolf from grieving for
his master too long, the dog w;is sent
to Stanford by fast express, while Dr.
Prokosch traveled by plane.
"Rolf is a native of France, and is
real aristocracy as dogs go. His type
of Great Dane is called Harlequin,
which means black and white spotted.
We have been in constant company for
the past six of golf's seven years," de
clared Dr. Prokosch.
"He understands a great deal of
what I say to him and shows nearly
human intelligence in his reactions to
my soliloquies."
