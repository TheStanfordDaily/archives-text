# A Problem for Science
## 
### David Brown 
Man, in "this brave new world," has
been acquiring the habit of thinking
that anything and everything that hap
pens has a reason.
To admit that there is nothing capri
cious, nothing whimsical, in this world
is to say that the dice of life have been
loaded with a positivism as pernicious
as anything displayed by the medieval
world and to make the "scientific atti
tude" the forgotten principle of those
who formulated it.
Science Stumped
"The best reason for believing that
man is a spiritual being is that he is
such a bad mechanism," Dr. J. E. Coo
ver, of the Psychology department, has
said.
Fascinating and astounding events
take place below the boundary of our
"stream of consciousness" and every
once in a while the veil is removed
just long enough to allow a glimpse.
Countless cases have come to the
attention of psychologists which dis
play powers we like to tag as "super
natural" simply because they are not
natural to us. This is not to disregard
the multitude of frauds which natu
rally occur in any realm in which
human gullibility is high.
But the thing to be observed is that a
"scientific attitude," if it is sincere,
will not limit itself to the boundaries
of a contemporary science. _ Our own
lives demonstrate most painfully the
lack of predictability in anything. If
we realize, with the sparse number of
progressive thinkers, that Fate is a
man of few words, mostly "maybe," we
are at least correct as far as that goes.
Interesting Examples
An excursion into the land of the
unaccountable takes us to some very
j interesting cases.
For example, there is the case of a
student who walked over a bridge on
his way to classes every day. At one
time, while he was particularly ab
sorbed in a difficult mathematical
problem while crossing the bridge, his
thoughts were abruptly interrupted
by a perfect mental vision of a par
ticular day during his childhood in the
Austrian Tyrol. Not a thing was miss
ing. Why, thought the student, should
he suddenly receive this thought? He
was thinking of a problem in calculus.
He had not contemplated childhood
days for as long a time as he could
recall. It was all too strange and un
accountable.
This vision occurred to him three
times on different occasions, each time
at the precise point on the bridge that
he had passed the first time. Each
time he had looked around for cues,
for mental fuses that would set off
this particular round of association.
Finally, on the third time, he turned
j around and looked up the stream.
' There was anchored a small vessel.

From her stacks issued billows of
black smoke. The student uncon
sciously took a deep breath, and the
vision recurred, as sharply as before.
Clear as daylight, it was Bohemian
coal.
Obscure but Amazing
Obscure but amazing is the case of
a Vermont printer in his New England
hamlet. Charles Dickens, it is known,
left an unfinished novel when he died.
There were several attempts by well
known literary men to finish it, but
because the novel was broken at the
time of the trial of one of its chief
characters, the ending was exceedingly
critical. Of the attempts made, none
had the courage to publish theirs.
In this New England village, how
ever, there lived an ordinary printer,
with no particular literary ability, who
was known as a spiritual "medium."
Once, during a seance, Charles Dick
-1 ens was allegedly heard. He expressed
I a desire to gnish his novel. Once each
night for the succeeding week, a ste
f nographer took down the words of the
I printer "medium" who was assertedly
| repeating what Charles Dickens was
saying. The printer actually published
j the volume, but, of course, only a few
! volumes were made.
1 Dr. Coover was fortunate enough to
| obtain one of these books. He con
| ducted an interesting experiment with
; superior English literature students.
' The book was so bound that there was
j no indication of where the break be
tween Dickens' last written words and
I the words reported and printed by the
! printer was. The students were asked
| to try and find the break by observing
literary style, dramatic structure, and
| the like. None of them were able to
do this. The book rolled on to a smooth
i and consistent literary finish.
Other similar cases are numerous.
I The tale of Swengali and Trilby is no
! stranger than many actual cases on
record. Here is a vast and fascinating
realm of the inexplicable. Science,
thank heavens, is not above everything.
Most astounding of all is the power of
i man to look at himself and his ability
i to mentally "lift himself by his own
j bootstraps."
The trail of a dinosaur wading in
j the tidal flats an estimated 50 million
; years ago is being reconstructed by
i the University of Texas.
