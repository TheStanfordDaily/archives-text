# Tracksters To Train For Berlin
## West Coast Finals Be Held in L.A. Saturday 
### Tro Harper 
Sneaking into Palo Alto while most
of the campus was still asleep, five
Stanford cinder burners, Captain
Sammy Klopstock, Ray Dean, Bill Mc-
Curdy, Warren Dixon, and Humbert
Smith yesterday came home from the
N.C.A.A. championships in Chicago,
footsore but not weary.
With the dream of the Olympic
Games in Berlin this summer rapidly
taking shape as a reality, the Indians
have one more chance to grab off
a ticket. In Los Angeles tomorrow
and Saturday the West Coast finals
will be held to decide which of the
many western stars will shine brightly
enough to make a flash on the camera
plates at the finish line in the New j
York finals late this month.
Of the five men who came home, j
only Sammy Klopstock is likely to |
compete in this meet. Along with Ed
Burrows, who lost out on the trip to
Chicago when he tossed a coin wilh
Dean and Smith and plans to avenge
his bad luck with a win in the 3000-
meter steeplechase this Saturday,
Klopstock will go south to fly high
with the cream of the Coast stick
steppers.
Reynolds, Levy Qualify
Of the Indians only Jim Reynolds
qnd Phil Levy managed to survive !
the sweeping scythe of the N.C.A.A.
championships. By virtue of his win
in the shot put Reynolds advanced to
the New York finals without much
trouble, but Levy found his pathway
to discus fame cluttered up by Ken
Carpenter of U.S.C. and a world rec
ord-breaking toss of 173 feet.
Despite the fact that these two
weight wingers are more than eligible
for the final trials, they nevertheless |
will see action in Los Angeles. They I
say they need practice under stress f
of competition.
Until they take the field in the Los
Angeles Coliseum both Reynolds and !
Levy will rest at their homes.
Klopstock Had Start
In Chicago Klopstock led the pack J
at the start but tripped on the third j
hurdle and raced more with bad luck ]
than he did with the fast field of world |
record-holder Forest Towns of Geor- !
gia and Dan Caldemeyer of Indiana,
but he still managed to slide into a
show position, thereby demonstrating
his ability as one of the finest com
petitors in the country.
Combined with his showing in Chi
cago and his ability, he should advance
without much trouble to the New York
trials. What he can do there is purely
a matter of conjecture.
Jack Weiershauser, Stanford's ace
two-furlong man, decided to stay in
the East when the rest of the team
boarded the Streamliner for Califor
nia. He will go on to Boston to visit
friends and then move into the East
ern finals to be held in Cambridge.
At Cambridge Weiershauser will not
find the overheated competition that
caused him to wind up fourth behind
the California dust storm, Archie Wil
liams, and A1 Fitch and Bob Small
wood of U.S.C. i

than he did with the fast field of world |
record-holder Forest Towns of Geor- !
gia and Dan Caldemeyer of Indiana,
but he still managed to slide into a
show position, thereby demonstrating
his ability as one of the finest com
petitors in the country.
Combined with his showing in Chi
cago and his ability, he should advance
without much trouble to the New York
trials. What he can do there is purely
a matter of conjecture.
Jack Weiershauser, Stanford's ace
two-furlong man, decided to stay in
the East when the rest of the team
boarded the Streamliner for Califor
nia. He will go on to Boston to visit
friends and then move into the East
ern finals to be held in Cambridge.
At Cambridge Weiershauser will not
find the overheated competition that
caused him to wind up fourth behind
the California dust storm, Archie Wil
liams, and A1 Fitch and Bob Small
wood of U.S.C. i
Sneaking into Palo Alto while most
of the campus was still asleep, five
Stanford cinder burners, Captain
Sammy Klopstock, Ray Dean, Bill Mc-
Curdy, Warren Dixon, and Humbert
Smith yesterday came home from the
N.C.A.A. championships in Chicago,
footsore but not weary.
With the dream of the Olympic
Games in Berlin this summer rapidly
taking shape as a reality, the Indians
have one more chance to grab off
a ticket. In Los Angeles tomorrow
and Saturday the West Coast finals
will be held to decide which of the
many western stars will shine brightly
enough to make a flash on the camera
plates at the finish line in the New j
York finals late this month.
Of the five men who came home, j
only Sammy Klopstock is likely to |
compete in this meet. Along with Ed
Burrows, who lost out on the trip to
Chicago when he tossed a coin wilh
Dean and Smith and plans to avenge
his bad luck with a win in the 3000-
meter steeplechase this Saturday,
Klopstock will go south to fly high
with the cream of the Coast stick
steppers.
Reynolds, Levy Qualify
Of the Indians only Jim Reynolds
qnd Phil Levy managed to survive !
the sweeping scythe of the N.C.A.A.
championships. By virtue of his win
in the shot put Reynolds advanced to
the New York finals without much
trouble, but Levy found his pathway
to discus fame cluttered up by Ken
Carpenter of U.S.C. and a world rec
ord-breaking toss of 173 feet.
Despite the fact that these two
weight wingers are more than eligible
for the final trials, they nevertheless |
will see action in Los Angeles. They I
say they need practice under stress f
of competition.
Until they take the field in the Los
Angeles Coliseum both Reynolds and !
Levy will rest at their homes.
