# Over 200 Acres Hill Grass Burns
## 
### 
A cigarette dropped carelessly from
a passing car caused the second fire in
two weeks to devastate over two hun
dred acres more of the Stanford Farm
in the vicinity of Searsville Lake late
yesterday afternoon. Driven by a high
wind, the flames roared through the
dry grass with such speed that several
fire-fighters were almost trapped.
Officers Gordon Davis and George
Burns, intent on putting out one part
of the fire, failed to notice the flames
rushing toward Davis' cai\ Warning
shouts caused Officer Davis to move it.
More than 50 men from the Wood
side and Stanford fire departments, as
well as soldiers from the Stanford post,
fought the fire for more than an hour
before it was finally brought under
control.
J. R. Wheeler of Menlo Park while
driving along the sand hill road said
he happened to notice two small blazes
flaring at the side of the road. Climb
ing from his truck he attempted to
extinguish them, but fanned by the
wind the flames leaped a ditch and
caught the grass on the far side. Whee
ler then notified the Woodside fire de
partment.
