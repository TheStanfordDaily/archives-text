When a school teacher gets a raise
that's news.
It was decidedly news on the up
curve yesterday, for many summer
Stanford students' fall budgets will
be affected.
To the teachers of Santa Barbara it
means, in many cases, that they are
getting as much as they were before
the depression. This is not the only
beam of sunlight reflected by the
report of the State Department of
Public Instruction. They also say
many school districts are increasing
their staffs.
"A step in the right direction" was
the statement of Mr. Bowman, who is
from Santa Barbara, where salaries
are upped five per cent. "Of course we
like it," said Helen Smith and Bob
Ritchie. The voices of the lucky ones
along the Quad yesterday echoed
words that could be cut to one happy
"swell."
