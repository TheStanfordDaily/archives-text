I Professor George Gamow, a visiting
physicist from the George Washing
ton University, was overcome by the
warmth of the day and enveigled Dr.
Gamow into writing his own inter
view. The result was as follows:
j "Adam, the first man, didn't know
J anything about the nucleus but Dr.
| George Gamow, visiting professor from
i George Washington University, pre
i tends that he does. He says for exam
j pie that the nucleus is .00000000000003
| feet in diameter. Nobody believes it,
j but that doesn't make any difference
I to him.
j "He also says that the nuclear en
| ergy contained in a pound of lithium
is enough to run the United States
Navy for a period of three years. But
to get this energy you would have to
heat a mixture-of lithium and hydro
gen up to 50,000,000 degrees Fahren
heit. If one had a little stove of this
temperature installed at Stanford, it
would burn everything alive within a
radius of 10,000 miles and broil all the
j fish in the Pacific Ocean.
"If you could go as fast as nuclear
j particles generally go, it wouldn't take
you more than one ten-thousandth of
a second to go to Miller's where you
could meet Gamow and get more
| details."
