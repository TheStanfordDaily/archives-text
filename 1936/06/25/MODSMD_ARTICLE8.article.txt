and "Caesar and Cleopatra," to be pre
sented later in the quarter under the
sponsorship of the Course in Stage
Classics Production.
Shaw's comedy, "Caesar and Cleopa
tra," which was produced in America
by the Theater Guild several years
ago, begins with the arrival of Julius
Caesar in Egypt. There he finds Cleo
patra and during the course of the play
makes her into a queen who rules
Egypt and looks forward to the arri
val of Mark Antony from Rome.
Shakespeare's play begins some years
after Antony's arrival and traces the
growing difficulties between Antony
and Octavius Caesar, the war between
them and the final downfall of the
lovers. This play has been called one
of Shakespeare's greatest dramas, but
is seldom produced because its staging
is so difficult.
Tryouts will not be conducted by
means of set speeches but by the
group readings of scenes from the two
plays. The cast of each play is large
and the opportunities for actors of all
sorts, beginners or experienced ama
teurs, is great. All persons interested
in taking part in one or both of the
plays are urged to attend tryouts this
evening at the Assembly Hall at 7:30,
whether they have acted before or not.
