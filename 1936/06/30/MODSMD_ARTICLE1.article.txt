# Dr. Trueblood, New Chaplain, Gives Sermon
## "Christian Realism" Is Text Of Address Delivered In Stanford Church Sunday 
### 
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, in his first
sermon at Stanford in the office of
chaplain, preached Sunday on "Chris
tian Realism."
He took for his text a passage from
the Epistle to the Hebrews which
quotes and comments upon the state
ment in the eighth Psalm to the effect
that man is of importance in the world
bcause all things have been put under
his feet.
This Christian realist, Dr. Trueblood
pointed out, could not accept as com
pletely true the statement that all
things were subject to man. The em
phasis in the text quoted is on the
phrase "not yet," the text reading
"We see not yet all things put under
man's feet." •
Technique Needed
The preacher went on to say there
is much in the present world to indi
cate that, in spite of the aspirations
of mankind, there are many features
of life which men have not put into
subjection.
They have, for example, been able to
develop a wonderful technique in the
mining and use of coal, but they have
not been able to develop an equal
technique in producing a good life for
the men and families who make the
production of coal possible.
We have been able to make the des
ert blossom as the rose, but we have
not been able to make the moral life
of those who live in the oases really
fine and good.
Character of Christ
Dr. Trueblood said that the hope of
a modern thinker, as the hope of the
anonymous author of the Book of He
brews, lies in the fact of the character
of Christ. It was because the ancient
author had the fact of Christ before
him that he could add the words
"not yet."
In the character of Jesus we have a
continual evidence of what life under
(he complete guidance of God might
be and therefore have not only a reve
lation of God, but also a revelation in
(he depths of man. This, said Dr. True
blood, is the Christian gospel which
matches hard realism with infinite
hope.
