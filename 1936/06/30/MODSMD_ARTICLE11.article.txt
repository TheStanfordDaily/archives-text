# Harris To Talk On War Effects
## 
### 
The world has made no hopeful
progress toward peace since 1918, and
I war and rumors of war are inevitable
I until something is done concerning
i nationalism and the morality of the
i sovereign state, in the opinion of Dr.
I David Harris, associate professor of
history at Stanford, who will give a
radio talk over station KGO on Mon
day, July 6, at 7:15 p.m.
"The hope that some people had in
1918 that the sovereign state might be
subject to a rule of law and that na
tionalism would abate has been dis
sipated in a world of exaggerated fears
and preparations and nationalistic hys
terias, ' Dr. Harris declared today.
Discussing "Reflections on the Last
Great War and the Next," Dr. Harris
will speak during the Stanford Radio
Hour.
Dr. Harris studied at the universi
j ties of Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and
j received his Ph.D. degree at Stanford i
i in 1928, where he has been teaching
since 1930.
