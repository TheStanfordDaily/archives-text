"Enjoyable hours," stated Frank de |
Lemos, assistant director of the Stan- i
ford Museum, "may be spent in the
cool and quiet of the museum, whose j
rare collections of Chinese, Japanese,
and Egyptian crafts as well as other
collections of interest are to be seen."
The museum is open to all visitors
daily from 10 to 5 o'clock.
One of the finest collections of Chi
nese and Japanese crafts, including |
porcelains, pottery, bronzes, and some 1
of the rarest pieces in existence of
paintings on silk are exhibited in the |
Chinese-Japanese room.
The Egyptian room, which has been
examined by two of the world's great
est Egyptologists and pronounced the
best collection of its kind, contains ma
terial dating from 100 B.C.
In the Early California room is the
first locomotive purchased for the Cen- '

I tral Pacific Railroad, the first railroad J
1 in California, which afterward merged
( into the Southern Pacific. Also in
this room are relics from old missions
and many articles portraying the his
| tory of California.
Of interest to many Stanford stu
i dents are the Stanford Family Memo-
I rial and the Leland Stanford rooms. In
I the Memorial room are articles per- j
j tainitig to the Stanford family life with
six cases containing Leland Stanford
I Jr.'s toys from the times of his child
' hood to his death in 1884 at the age
1 of 15 years.
The exhibit also contains life size
portraits of the family painted by fa
mous European artists. In the Le
land Stanford room are articles which
represent the beginning of the mu
' scum and were collected by Leland

Stanford Jr. during his two trips to
Europe.
Indian sand paintings, rare exhibits,
were made in the Stanford Museum
by medicine men, as it is part of the
religious ceremony to destroy the
paintings at sunset .
The balcony holds a collection of
European and Mexican handicrafts,
classic Greek pottery, North American
Indian crafts, examples of 15th and
16th century glass, East Indian imple
ments and guns, a large copy of hand
letters, an illustrated Koran, and a
collection of Stone Age implements.
Other collections of note are to be
found in the Colonial and American
rooms and the Textile room, where
there are fine laces, rare and old Eng
lish shawls from the private collection
of Mrs. Stanford.
