# Program of English Madrigals Will be Given in Assembly Hall
## Rare Instruments To Be Featured as Part Of 16th Century Music 
### 
A program of English madri
gals will be given in the Assem
bly Hall tonight at 8 o'clock by
the San Francisco State College
Madrigal Singers under the di
rection of Miss Eileen McCall.
Miss McCall will also give the
regular Tudrtr lecture tomor
row at 8 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse on the subject of
"Madrigal Music."
English madrigals, the clavi
cord, the lute, and the recorder,

â™¦ a predecessor of the flute, are
all products of the 16th century, and
the program will be consistent in its
setting and costuming.
Miss McCall, an authority on Eng
lish Madrigals and ancient instru
ments, purchased many old instru
ments during a European trip last
year, when she studied at the State
Academy of Musical Art in Munich;
and many of the instruments can be
found nowhere else in the United
States.
A few months ago when the re
corders arrived from Germany, Miss
McCall taught four young men to play
these old, but extremely intresting,
instruments. One of the quartet's se
lections will be a Courante, a 16th
century dance, which will be danced
by a costumed group selected by Miss
McCall.
The madrigal is a composition of the
16th century which was sung infor
mally around the table following sup
per. The music is spontaneous, re
freshing, and stimulating.
The clavicord, which is to be played
by Miss McCall, is a forerunner of
the piano and is small enough to be
carried by the performer. Its tone Ls
j very soft and delicate.
Miss McCall's group of student
j Madrigal Singers appeared at Stan
ford several years ago and were en
thusiastically received.

Old Chamber Music
Chamber music (literally "room
music") is any small ensemble of in
struments or voices. In the Eliza
bethan period a predecessor of our
modern flute, the recorder, was a fa
vorite for such ensembles. When they
were played in quartet they were
known as a "Consort"; when with
other instruments or voices, as a
"Broken Consort."

Courante Hooper
During the Elizabethan period one
of the most popular court dances was

company a graceful, quick dance of
a definite pattern. Later it achieved a
form independent from the dance as
a movement in the suite, which in
