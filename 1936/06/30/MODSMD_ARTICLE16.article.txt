# Program of English Madrigals Will be Given in Assembly Hall
## Rare Instruments To Be Featured as Part Of 16th Century Music

A program of English madri

all products of the 16th century, and
the program will be consistent in its
setting and costuming.
Miss McCall, an authority on Eng

Academy of Musical Art in Munich;
and many of the instruments can be
found nowhere else in the United
States.
A few months ago when the re
corders arrived from Germany, Miss
McCall taught four young men to play
these old, but extremely intresting,
instruments. One of the quartet's se

century dance, which will be danced
by a costumed group selected by Miss
McCall.
