# Dr. Prokosch Lectures On Human Speech
## Noted Philologist Gives The First in Series of Lectures By Visiting Faculty Men 
### 
"Language is the means of ex- |
pression and of progress of all human 1
activity." Dr. Eduard Prokosch, act- j
ing professor of German, emphasized \
this point in his lecture on '"Evolu- j
tion in Language" given Thursday
evening at the Women's Clubhouse.
"Language is, in a sense, the most
democratic form of human endeavor:
art, religion, and law are essentially
the work of single individuals; lan
guagel is the product of collective
thought of the whole group."
Form of Social Behavior
In his talk, Dr. Prokosch pointed
out that language is a form of social
behavior, and that it is this which
distinguishes the speech of human
beings from the "speech" of animals.
Animal speech is inherited whereas
human speech is the result of social
contact and is newly acquired by
each generation.
"Therefore," Dr. Prokosch explained,
"language changes with changes in
social character; it depends on histori
cal developments that shape national
character." Illustrations of this in
terrelation between history in its
widest sense and change in language
were given from a number of lan
guages.
Tells of Linguists
Dr. Prokosch, an outstanding phi
lologist, stated that Connecticut and
California have several of the greatest
linguists in America. He named in
particular Whitney and Outel in Con
necticut and Wheeler and Hempl in
California.
Discussing these linguists he con
tinued, "All of these treated linguis
tics as a focal science—as the center
of a group in which anthropology,
psycholQgy, philosophy, anatomy,
physics, and geology are integral ele
ments."
His talk also included remarks on
the various theories of the origin of
language, tracing its development and
involving a discussion of the gradual
development of grammatical forms.
Dr. Prokosch is Sterling Professor at
Yale University.

Animal speech is inherited whereas
human speech is the result of social
contact and is newly acquired by
each generation.
"Therefore," Dr. Prokosch explained,
"language changes with changes in
social character; it depends on histori
cal developments that shape national
character." Illustrations of this in
terrelation between history in its
widest sense and change in language
were given from a number of lan
guages.
Tells of Linguists
Dr. Prokosch, an outstanding phi
lologist, stated that Connecticut and
California have several of the greatest
linguists in America. He named in
particular Whitney and Outel in Con
necticut and Wheeler and Hempl in
California.
Discussing these linguists he con
tinued, "All of these treated linguis
tics as a focal science—as the center
of a group in which anthropology,
psycholQgy, philosophy, anatomy,
physics, and geology are integral ele
ments."
His talk also included remarks on
the various theories of the origin of
language, tracing its development and
involving a discussion of the gradual
development of grammatical forms.
Dr. Prokosch is Sterling Professor at
Yale University.
