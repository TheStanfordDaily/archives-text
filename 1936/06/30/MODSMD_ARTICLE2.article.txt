# U.S.â€”Canada Will Be Topic
## 
### 
Professor Peter Sandiford, acting
professor of psychology at Stanford,
will be heard in the second lecture of
the visiting professor series on Thurs
day evening at 8 o'clock in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The Canadian psychologist has
chosen for the subject of his address
relationships between Canada and the
United States. He will endeavor to
show that geographically, linguisti
cally, and by tradition the two coun
tries are hardly separable.
"In many ways there is a greater
community of feeling between Cana
dians and Americans than between
Canadians and Englishmen," Dr. San
diford said yesterday.
The often debated question of Can
ada's destiny as to ultimate absorp
tion by the United States will also be
considered by Dr. Sandiford.
