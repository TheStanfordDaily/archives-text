# Aims of Business School Described
## 
### 
"Training Tomorrow's Executives" I
is the title of a Stanford brochure is
sued today, which tells about the kind
of men, the kind of training, and the
objectives of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.
Although professional education for
business is of recent origin and the
department has been established but
a few years, "the alumni of the school
to date have done well. Two are treas
urers of large corporations, one is
comptroller-secretary of another large
concern, another a director of an im
portant shipbuilding company, others
are departmental heads in research and
financial institutions."
Written by Wilson
The brochure was written by Neill
C. Wilson, '12, a San Francisco adver
tising man and author.
"Only seventeen graduates of the
school have been out as long as seven
years," Mr. Wilson says, "but practi
cally every student has obtained de
sirable employment upon graduation,
and nearly all of the group held their
jobs throughout the depression."
This was the ninth brochure to be
published by the Stanford Associates
during the school year. The work is
being financed by a group of Stanford
men and women interested in bringing
to the attention of students and friends
of the University the progress and
needs of the various fields of activity.
Aims Set Forth
In the brochure Dean J. Hugh Jack
son of the school sets forth to the
reader some of the aims and require
ments of the School of Business:
"The primary aim of our business
I education, as of all education, is to
I develop in our students the ability to
think straight. From the viewpoint
i both of society and of individual busi
! ness units, it is of primary importance
I that our students be trained to do 'dis
! cretionary and diiective work; work
that is potentially creative.' This is
j certainly as true for the student des
j tined to engage in business as the stu
! dent slated for any of the so-called
j learned professions.
"In fact, a professional view is rap
! idly springing up in business. The
j outlook of the practical man of affairs
I has become more social than ever be
i fore.
"A grasp of the outstanding relation
i ships resulting from the unceasing
| movement of commodities, peoples, and
J capita] across political frontiers and
| an understanding of the pronounce
| ments of courts of law, trade associa-
I tions, and other organs of public opin
, ion on such matters as fair rates of
I return, fair prices, fair wages, fair
competition, fair taxes, etc., are essen
| tial parts of the everyday equipment of

the educated business man of the fu
ture.
Must Co-ordinate
"Business must learn to co-ordinate
its policies and its operations not only
with the shifting balance tof eco- j
nomic factors, national and interna- j
tional, but also with the cultural, legal,
and institutional framework of so
ciety.
"Technical training, however fun
damental it may be, is of itself inade
quate for the business administrator '
of the future. He must understand the ,
background and motives of his own ,
and other peoples. For this he needs
not only some knowledge of, but also j
a genuine appreciation for, the accu- j.
mulated learning of the ages.
