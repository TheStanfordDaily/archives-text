# De Lemos Group To Leave for Orient
## 
### 
Pedro de Lemos, director of the j
Stanford University Museum, will I
leave for China in July, where he will |
conduct a Far Eastern Art and Travel j
School. The itinerary covers points of j
importance in China and Japan. Dur- 1
ing his absence, Frank de Lemos, |
brother of the director, will take over j
his duties.
In addition to lecturing, Mr. de Le- j
mos has written many articles con- i
cerning arts and crafts in Europe and j
the Orient. He is a fellow of the |
Royal Society of Art and has been
editor -in - chief of the School Arts
Magazine for the past 16 years.
Instruction in the study and selec
tion of the Oriental arts, as well as in 1
sketching, will be given by Mr. de
Lemos to members of the party. Mr.
de Lemos conducted a group of artists
and art instructors through Europe
in 1926.

"That appreciation, at least for the
great majority of our business and pro
fessional leaders, must come through
a sound college training. This grow
ing need for business executives to j
J have not only a highly technical
training but also a broad background
is a chief reason for the basic academic
- training desired of students seeking
| admission to the School.
Co-ordinating Force
"But along with these broader im- 1
plications of training it is important
! that the professional school of busi- j
j ness shall not neglect business itself.
"Not only must ample considera- j
I tion be given to the functional divisions
of business —accounting, finance, pro
j duction, marketing, advertising, per
, sonnel administration, industrial re
j lations, and the like—and the prob
j lems that arise therein, but it is also
1 important that special study be made
of the manner in which management
becomes a unifying and co-ordinating
force in business."
