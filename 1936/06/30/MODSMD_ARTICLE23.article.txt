# Conference To Study Changes In Curriculum
## Meeting from July 6 to 10 To Discuss Requirements and Education Guidance 
### 
Educators from all parts of the
country will meet at Stanford Uni
versity July 6 to July 10 to participate
in a Conference on Curriculum and
Guidance sponsored by the School of
Education.
The changes of far-reaching im
portance that now characterize edu
cational practice will be subjected to
critical review by the conference, de
clares Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, Dean
of the Stanford School of Education.
"The typical curriculum is being
thoroughly overhauled," Dr. Kefauver
believes. "New subjects are added.
Old subjects are 'modernized' in light
of social requirements. In some schools
the program is no longer built around
subjects, but is designed to offer stu
dents a more adequate and better
rounded grasp of society by some com
prehensive approach."
To Study Changes
"The conference will examine these
departures, and attempt to formulate
policies to make the school more ef
fective in serving social needs," Dr.
Kefauver said.
The five-day conference will fea
ture more than one hundred forum
sessions and will attract an estimated
eight hundred teachers and adminis
trators.
The conferenc will examine the so
cial and psychological presuppositions
of educational theory, and will con
sider such widely diversified problems
tis adult education, character growth,
health and hygiene education, as well
as the more general aspects of curricu
lum and guidance.
Conference Highlight
A highlight of the confcrence is ex
pected to be furnished by United States
Commissioner of Education John W.
Studebaker. Studebaker will take the
position that no reorganization of the
curriculum will be adequate until the
members of the community become
better informed concerning the edu
cational effects of non-school agencies.

forums have consistently attracted
