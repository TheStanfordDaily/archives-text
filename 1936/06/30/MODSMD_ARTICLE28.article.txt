# Card Mermen To Train For Olympic Meet
## Dey, Seward Take First In I. C. 4- A. Tennis Match; Golfers Second in Play 
### Tro Harper 
When Dave Rider hit the waters of
Fleishhacker pool early this month as
a filler in the 400 meters at the Pacific-
Athletic Association trials, he made a
splash that rocked him right into the
national sportlight, broke a Pacific
Coast record for the distance, caused
newswriters to dub him a "sopho
more sensation," and placed himself
head man at the top of a long list of
coast stars. But this proved just a
starter for the human dolphin.
Wishing to test his new-found abil
ity and prove himself among sterner
competition and greater distances, he
journeyed to Des Moines for the Na
tional A.A.U. championships along
with his coach Nort Thornton and
teammate Winfield Needham.
There in the finals of the one-mile,
Rider paddled his way into a fourth
position behind the best of King Nep
tune's knights of boiling bowl. Since
Bob Pirie of Canada placed second
in the mile race and does not count as
one of the American champs, Rider is
now rated as third man in the United
States. Flashing faultless form Rider
outfiailed both the great Jack Medica
of Washington and U.S.C.'s turbine
driven Gilhooley.
Speedy Splashing
As a result of his speedy splashing
at Des Moines, Rider was invited to
go to New Haven and train for a
period of three weeks with the bright
est stars on the Olympic horizon under
the tutelage of Bob Kiputh, Yale
mentor, before he enters the Olympic
trials to be held in Providence, R.1.,
on July 10-12. At Providence, Rider
will enter the 1500-meter bout and
seek to be among the first three men
in America to touch the tiles at the
other end of the pool, and thereby
win a trip to represent Uncle Sam at
the games in Berlin.
Winfield Needham, Stanford's ace
freshman, went to Des Moines, but on
the way there caught a cold and was
unable to compete with Rider. He was,
however, asked to join the American
forces at Yale and will enter both the
400 and 1500 meters at Providence.
Water Poloists to Chicago
Under the colors of the Olympic
Club five Stanford water poloists, Bill
Hanna, Bill Clemo, Jack Loupe, Chuck
Giffon. and Don Peterson left last
night for Chicago to take a shot at the
Olympic Games in Berlin. Selected
from a scrappy gang of players that
tried out at P'leishhacker pool, the
five Cardinals outdid themselves to
place all five men on the team.
In Chicago the boys will meet seven
other teams. Even though they are
beaten, some of the boys still have a
chance to make the trip to Berlin since
the committee not only selects the team
that will represent America, but also
four alternates.
Playing for the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club, Wally O'Connor, a Stan
ford captain in 1932, will compete
against his alma mater as will Bob
Haslacher, Card captain for next year
and all conference goalie. With Has
lacher playing for the California Col
legians, a team composed of U.C.L.A.
men that were all-coast champions
Inst season, this brings the total num
ber of Indians in the trials to seven.

When Dave Rider hit the waters of
Fleishhacker pool early this month as
a filler in the 400 meters at the Pacific-
Athletic Association trials, he made a
splash that rocked him right into the
national sportlight, broke a Pacific
Coast record for the distance, caused
newswriters to dub him a "sopho
more sensation," and placed himself
head man at the top of a long list of
coast stars. But this proved just a
starter for the human dolphin.
Wishing to test his new-found abil
ity and prove himself among sterner
competition and greater distances, he
journeyed to Des Moines for the Na
tional A.A.U. championships along
with his coach Nort Thornton and
teammate Winfield Needham.
There in the finals of the one-mile,
Rider paddled his way into a fourth
position behind the best of King Nep
tune's knights of boiling bowl. Since
Bob Pirie of Canada placed second
in the mile race and does not count as
one of the American champs, Rider is
now rated as third man in the United
States. Flashing faultless form Rider
outfiailed both the great Jack Medica
of Washington and U.S.C.'s turbine
driven Gilhooley.
Speedy Splashing
As a result of his speedy splashing
at Des Moines, Rider was invited to
go to New Haven and train for a
period of three weeks with the bright
est stars on the Olympic horizon under
the tutelage of Bob Kiputh, Yale
mentor, before he enters the Olympic
trials to be held in Providence, R.1.,
on July 10-12. At Providence, Rider
will enter the 1500-meter bout and
seek to be among the first three men
in America to touch the tiles at the
other end of the pool, and thereby
win a trip to represent Uncle Sam at
the games in Berlin.
Winfield Needham, Stanford's ace
freshman, went to Des Moines, but on
the way there caught a cold and was
unable to compete with Rider. He was,
however, asked to join the American
forces at Yale and will enter both the
400 and 1500 meters at Providence.
Water Poloists to Chicago
Under the colors of the Olympic
Club five Stanford water poloists, Bill
Hanna, Bill Clemo, Jack Loupe, Chuck
Giffon. and Don Peterson left last
night for Chicago to take a shot at the
Olympic Games in Berlin. Selected
from a scrappy gang of players that
tried out at P'leishhacker pool, the
five Cardinals outdid themselves to
place all five men on the team.
In Chicago the boys will meet seven
other teams. Even though they are
beaten, some of the boys still have a
chance to make the trip to Berlin since
the committee not only selects the team
that will represent America, but also
four alternates.
Playing for the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club, Wally O'Connor, a Stan
ford captain in 1932, will compete
against his alma mater as will Bob
Haslacher, Card captain for next year
and all conference goalie. With Has
lacher playing for the California Col
legians, a team composed of U.C.L.A.
men that were all-coast champions
Inst season, this brings the total num
