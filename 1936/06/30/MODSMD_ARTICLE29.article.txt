# Keller Stresses Need For Crime Data
## 
### 
"Just plain ignorance" is the crimi
nologists' "Public Enemy Number
One," according to Dr. Philip E. Keller,
assistant professor of sociology at Stan
ford, who spoke on "Fighting Crime
with Facts" last night over station
KGO. He stressed the importance of
a nation-wide system of standardized
crime statistics if crime control is to
be successful.
"Fortunately the interest which has
been evinced in crime statistics mainly
by college teachers, the research foun
dations, and a few progressive admin
istrators has in recent years begun to
bear fruit. The number of agencies do
ing commendable work in the field is
too numerous to mention—though not
too numerous for the task at hand."
Dr. Keller here mentioned the Bureau
of Public Administration at the Uni
versity of California and the State
Crime Problem Advisory Committee
as sponsoring valuable work on crime
statistics.
Although sporadic crime surveys
may be valuable to criminologists as
check-up devices and as indicators
of what data should be gathered, Dr.
Keller explained that they aren't ade
quate substitutes for "continuous col
lection and compilation of accurate
crime statistics."
Action Demanded
In answer to the question "Why are
not more adequate crime statistics
available?" Dr. Keller is quoted as
saying: "When confronted with alarm
ing social problems, we are inclined to
demand action—almost any kind of
action, so long as it is quick and—
usually — spectacular. Fact gathering
and planning seem academic and inef
fectual by comparison. We forget that
intelligent action requires knowledge.
"Secondly, statistics pertaining to
anything except the stock market and
sports are, at any time, traditionally
through to the semi-finals where he
was defeated by Vernon John of
U.S.C. in a fast singles match.
Stanford Second in Golf
In a bang-up Intercollegiate tour
ney at Chicago, Yale replaced Michi
gan as national champions when a
four-man team turned in a total of
625 strokes for 36 holes. Stanford
was second with 628. Spec Stewart,
lone Cardinal hope, placed fourth with
a score of 77-72—149.

regarded as 'dry' and uninteresting. If 1
they happen to contradict popular
opinion—as they do more often than
not—they are likely to be dismissed as
academic 'hocus pocus'."
Points Out Cost
He continued by pointing out the
relative cost of adequate record keep
ing. "Legislators and taxpayers arc
notoriously reluctant to provide funds j
for public purposes which do not
seem to pay immediate dividends. They
can sometimes see the value of added
police officers, of new court buildings,
or cell blocks, but rarely of record
keeping."
Through a national standardized
system of crime statistics, criminolo
gists can answer the many questions
which arise in an active campaign
against the spread of crime. "How
much crime is being committed? What
kinds? How many criminals are in
volved? What kinds of people are
they? With what backgrounds? What
kinds of people are most likely to be
come criminal? Under what circum
stances?" These and other similar
queries were suggested by Dr. Keller
as pertinent in fighting crime, and re- j
liable information is essential in an
swering them.
Raids Satisfy Public
In considering the general nature of
the problems of crime control, he stated
that many people seem satisfied with
the sporadic mopping-up raids that
net the Dillingers and Nelsons, "but
for every Dillinger or Nelson there
are thousands of less spectacular law
breakers who must be curbed." He 1
continued by telling that there are;
others who still think the problem is 1
merely one of capturing criminals— j
dead or alive. "They forget, however, j
that captured criminals are being con
stantly replaced by new recruits.
"So," declared Dr. Keller, "we have :
the task not only of catching and jail
ing active criminals, but also of head
ing off potential ones; and of either
permanently incapacitating or curing
those who have been caught. The
other side of the crime control prob
lem consists mainly of keeping the
agencies of justice in as good fighting
trim as possible."
Scientific Plans Needed
In regard to the lack of sufficient
crime statistics, Dr. Keller continued

by saying that literary descriptions of I
individual cases and institutions j
abound in the newspapers and maga- '■
zines. "They are useful for publicity j
purposes, but what we really need for !
scientific planning of crime control are j
large masses of data for long periods of
time and numerous areas. These are i
especially necessary for determining!
what is typical rather than exceptional I
as regards both criminals and their
backgrounds, and the agencies of jus- j
tice.
"Unless we know what is typical we
may waste much energy on the merely
sensational, with nothing to show for ,
our efforts but a few newspaper head
lines."
Dr. Keller stated that the police, or j
the parole systems, may be more or !
less efficient but that it is necessary to l
have some standard of measuring their j
efficiency. But he emphasized the fact I
that such standards can only be ar- 1
rived at if "we have dependable data \
on our enforcement agencies in all i
parts of the country and for various j
periods."

KGO. He stressed the importance of
a nation-wide system of standardized
crime statistics if crime control is to
be successful.
"Fortunately the interest which has
been evinced in crime statistics mainly
by college teachers, the research foun
dations, and a few progressive admin
istrators has in recent years begun to
bear fruit. The number of agencies do
ing commendable work in the field is
too numerous to mention—though not
too numerous for the task at hand."
Dr. Keller here mentioned the Bureau
of Public Administration at the Uni
versity of California and the State
Crime Problem Advisory Committee
as sponsoring valuable work on crime
statistics.
Although sporadic crime surveys
may be valuable to criminologists as
check-up devices and as indicators
of what data should be gathered, Dr.
Keller explained that they aren't ade
quate substitutes for "continuous col
lection and compilation of accurate
crime statistics."
Action Demanded
In answer to the question "Why are
not more adequate crime statistics
available?" Dr. Keller is quoted as
saying: "When confronted with alarm
ing social problems, we are inclined to
demand action—almost any kind of
action, so long as it is quick and—
usually — spectacular. Fact gathering
and planning seem academic and inef
fectual by comparison. We forget that
intelligent action requires knowledge.
"Secondly, statistics pertaining to
anything except the stock market and
sports are, at any time, traditionally
through to the semi-finals where he
was defeated by Vernon John of
U.S.C. in a fast singles match.
Stanford Second in Golf
In a bang-up Intercollegiate tour
ney at Chicago, Yale replaced Michi
gan as national champions when a
four-man team turned in a total of
625 strokes for 36 holes. Stanford
was second with 628. Spec Stewart,
lone Cardinal hope, placed fourth with
a score of 77-72—149.

regarded as 'dry' and uninteresting. If 1
they happen to contradict popular
opinion—as they do more often than
not—they are likely to be dismissed as
academic 'hocus pocus'."
Points Out Cost
He continued by pointing out the
relative cost of adequate record keep
ing. "Legislators and taxpayers arc
notoriously reluctant to provide funds j
for public purposes which do not
seem to pay immediate dividends. They
can sometimes see the value of added
police officers, of new court buildings,
or cell blocks, but rarely of record
keeping."
Through a national standardized
system of crime statistics, criminolo
gists can answer the many questions
which arise in an active campaign
against the spread of crime. "How
much crime is being committed? What
kinds? How many criminals are in
volved? What kinds of people are
they? With what backgrounds? What
kinds of people are most likely to be
come criminal? Under what circum
stances?" These and other similar
queries were suggested by Dr. Keller
as pertinent in fighting crime, and re- j
liable information is essential in an
swering them.
Raids Satisfy Public
In considering the general nature of
the problems of crime control, he stated
that many people seem satisfied with
the sporadic mopping-up raids that
net the Dillingers and Nelsons, "but
for every Dillinger or Nelson there
are thousands of less spectacular law
breakers who must be curbed." He 1
continued by telling that there are;
others who still think the problem is 1
merely one of capturing criminals— j
dead or alive. "They forget, however, j
that captured criminals are being con
stantly replaced by new recruits.
"So," declared Dr. Keller, "we have :
the task not only of catching and jail
ing active criminals, but also of head
ing off potential ones; and of either
permanently incapacitating or curing
those who have been caught. The
other side of the crime control prob
lem consists mainly of keeping the
agencies of justice in as good fighting
trim as possible."
Scientific Plans Needed
In regard to the lack of sufficient
crime statistics, Dr. Keller continued

by saying that literary descriptions of I
individual cases and institutions j
abound in the newspapers and maga- '■
zines. "They are useful for publicity j
purposes, but what we really need for !
scientific planning of crime control are j
large masses of data for long periods of
time and numerous areas. These are i
especially necessary for determining!
what is typical rather than exceptional I
as regards both criminals and their
backgrounds, and the agencies of jus- j
tice.
"Unless we know what is typical we
may waste much energy on the merely
sensational, with nothing to show for ,
our efforts but a few newspaper head
lines."
Dr. Keller stated that the police, or j
the parole systems, may be more or !
less efficient but that it is necessary to l
have some standard of measuring their j
efficiency. But he emphasized the fact I
that such standards can only be ar- 1
rived at if "we have dependable data \
on our enforcement agencies in all i
parts of the country and for various j
periods."
"Just plain ignorance" is the crimi
nologists' "Public Enemy Number
One," according to Dr. Philip E. Keller,
assistant professor of sociology at Stan
ford, who spoke on "Fighting Crime

dations, and a few progressive admin
istrators has in recent years begun to
bear fruit. The number of agencies do
ing commendable work in the field is
too numerous to mention—though not
too numerous for the task at hand."
Dr. Keller here mentioned the Bureau
of Public Administration at the Uni
versity of California and the State
Crime Problem Advisory Committee
as sponsoring valuable work on crime
statistics.
Although sporadic crime surveys
may be valuable to criminologists as
check-up devices and as indicators
of what data should be gathered, Dr.
Keller explained that they aren't ade
quate substitutes for "continuous col
lection and compilation of accurate
crime statistics."
Action Demanded
In answer to the question "Why are
not more adequate crime statistics
available?" Dr. Keller is quoted as
saying: "When confronted with alarm
ing social problems, we are inclined to
demand action—almost any kind of
action, so long as it is quick and—
usually — spectacular. Fact gathering
and planning seem academic and inef
fectual by comparison. We forget that
intelligent action requires knowledge.
"Secondly, statistics pertaining to
anything except the stock market and
sports are, at any time, traditionally
through to the semi-finals where he
was defeated by Vernon John of
U.S.C. in a fast singles match.
Stanford Second in Golf
In a bang-up Intercollegiate tour
ney at Chicago, Yale replaced Michi
gan as national champions when a
four-man team turned in a total of
625 strokes for 36 holes. Stanford
was second with 628. Spec Stewart,
lone Cardinal hope, placed fourth with
a score of 77-72—149.

regarded as 'dry' and uninteresting. If 1
they happen to contradict popular
opinion—as they do more often than
not—they are likely to be dismissed as
academic 'hocus pocus'."
Points Out Cost
He continued by pointing out the
relative cost of adequate record keep
ing. "Legislators and taxpayers arc
notoriously reluctant to provide funds j
for public purposes which do not
seem to pay immediate dividends. They
can sometimes see the value of added
police officers, of new court buildings,
or cell blocks, but rarely of record
keeping."
Through a national standardized
system of crime statistics, criminolo
gists can answer the many questions
which arise in an active campaign
against the spread of crime. "How
much crime is being committed? What
kinds? How many criminals are in
volved? What kinds of people are
they? With what backgrounds? What
kinds of people are most likely to be
come criminal? Under what circum
stances?" These and other similar
queries were suggested by Dr. Keller
as pertinent in fighting crime, and re- j
liable information is essential in an
swering them.
Raids Satisfy Public
In considering the general nature of
the problems of crime control, he stated
that many people seem satisfied with
the sporadic mopping-up raids that
net the Dillingers and Nelsons, "but
for every Dillinger or Nelson there
are thousands of less spectacular law
breakers who must be curbed." He 1
continued by telling that there are;
others who still think the problem is 1
merely one of capturing criminals— j
dead or alive. "They forget, however, j
that captured criminals are being con
stantly replaced by new recruits.
"So," declared Dr. Keller, "we have :
the task not only of catching and jail
ing active criminals, but also of head
ing off potential ones; and of either
permanently incapacitating or curing
those who have been caught. The
other side of the crime control prob
lem consists mainly of keeping the
agencies of justice in as good fighting
trim as possible."
Scientific Plans Needed
In regard to the lack of sufficient
crime statistics, Dr. Keller continued

by saying that literary descriptions of I
individual cases and institutions j
abound in the newspapers and maga- '■
zines. "They are useful for publicity j
purposes, but what we really need for !
scientific planning of crime control are j
large masses of data for long periods of
time and numerous areas. These are i
especially necessary for determining!
what is typical rather than exceptional I
as regards both criminals and their
backgrounds, and the agencies of jus- j
tice.
"Unless we know what is typical we
may waste much energy on the merely
sensational, with nothing to show for ,
our efforts but a few newspaper head
lines."
Dr. Keller stated that the police, or j
the parole systems, may be more or !
less efficient but that it is necessary to l
have some standard of measuring their j
efficiency. But he emphasized the fact I
that such standards can only be ar- 1
rived at if "we have dependable data \
on our enforcement agencies in all i
parts of the country and for various j
periods."
"Just plain ignorance" is the crimi
nologists' "Public Enemy Number
One," according to Dr. Philip E. Keller,
assistant professor of sociology at Stan
ford, who spoke on "Fighting Crime
with Facts" last night over station
KGO. He stressed the importance of
a nation-wide system of standardized
crime statistics if crime control is to
be successful.
"Fortunately the interest which has
been evinced in crime statistics mainly
by college teachers, the research foun
dations, and a few progressive admin
istrators has in recent years begun to
bear fruit. The number of agencies do
ing commendable work in the field is
