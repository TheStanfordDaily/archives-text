# Chaplain Talks Of Paganism In Colleges
## 
### 
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, the new
chaplain of the University, on being
interviewed yesterday in the vestry of
the Memorial Church, spoke of his ,
hopes for the religious life of the Uni
versity.
He has come to his new position out
of a background of work with students
in several institutions, including Har
vard University and Havei*ford Col
lege.
"I am convinced," he said, "that the I
amount of paganism in our universi
ties is greatly exaggerated. There is
a great deal of what may be called
the religion of the inarticulate, and
many think they are irreligious merely
because they have thrown overboard
the poor religion which they have ,
known most intimately."
To Reach Students
What he wants most to do in his |
new position is to reach the students I
who are in revolt against what they !
think is ordinary religious thinking
and try to find some common ground ;
on which they and intelligent Chris- 1
tians can meet.
Dr. Trueblood expects to preach each
Sunday throughout the remainder of I
the summer quarter. The sermons
will present a continuous theme and
the ten addresses together willl at
tempt to give a coherent view of the
religious life. The messages given will
be similar to those in Dr. Trueblood's
recently published book "The Essence 1
of Spiritual Religion." This book was \
published by Harper & Bros, in April. j
Bible Class Planned
If there is a demand for it, a Sunday i
morning Bible class for students only
will be inaugurated. Students who
have an interest in this or other as- 1
pects of religious life are invited to
drop in to the vestry of the Memorial
Church any morning.
