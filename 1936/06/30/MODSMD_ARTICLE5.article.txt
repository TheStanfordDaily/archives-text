# 1114 Marriages Performed In Stanford Chapel
## 
### 
Upon Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, new
chaplain of the Memorial Church, fell
the task, last Sunday, of performing
the 1114 th marriage ceremony solem
nized in the Stanford Chapel.
The wedding of Elizabeth Schiebcl, I
graduate nurse of the Stanford Hospi- j
tal, and Dan Robertson of the School '
of Engineering with the class of '35, |
incidentally, was the first presided !
over on the Stanford campus by Dr.
Trueblood.
During the month of June, 15
couples have been married in the Uni- I
versity Chapel. The day following'
Commencement, June 15, was the rec- j
ord-breaking day of the month with j
eight persons exchanging vows. How- i
ever, this quota for June 1936 is ten !
less than last June.
