Two Stanford students, John Park
and Robert W. Bower, entered in the
; intercollegiate flying meet held at De
i troit July 19 and 20 and succeeded in

I tured first and second places in the
straight approach spot landing from
500 feet, first place in spot landing
after making one complete circle of
the field at 1500 feet, and second and
third places in bomb dropping.
Landing Contest
In the spot landing contest at 1500
feet Park came within 16 feet, his
closest competitor landing at more
than 100. Park took the major points
throughout. Though neither had en
tered in the fourth event, the scores

I to Stanford by two points.

| ing contest in which the contestants
drop a roll of paper from 1500 feet and
| try to break it two times before it has
I gone 500. As a more powerful plane
j than the Taylor Cubs rented by Park
j and Bower after arrival was necessary
| for the event, neither boy entered.
