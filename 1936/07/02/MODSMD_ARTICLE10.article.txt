# Dr. C. G. Wrenn Resigns Office
## Assistant Registrar Accepts Position at Minnesota 
### 
Dr. Charles Gilbert Wrenn turned in
his resignation as assistant registrar
for student personnel and assistant
professor of Education this week in
favor of an appointment at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. Wrenn's resig
nation terminated seven years on the
Stanford faculty.
The position at Minnesota consists
of assistant director of the Genei-al
College and associate professor of Edu
cation. In the latter position he will
be working with the University Com
mittee on Educational Research.
The General College is a new ex
perimental college covering the first
two years of university work. It is a
very progressive unit in its third year
under the directorship of Dr. Mal
colm Mac Lean.
The associate professorship in Edu
cation provides for some teaching, but
is primarily work of research nature
which includes the university prob
lems of student personnel, curriculum,
and administration.
Professor Wrenn begins work at
Minnesota in September.
