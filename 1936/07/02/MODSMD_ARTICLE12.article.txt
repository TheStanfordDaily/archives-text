j "Supreme for its abundant vitality— I
its full-throated robustness." This is
how Miss Eileen McCall, director of
the San Francisco State College Mad
rigal Singers, described the English
madrigal, characteristic vocal music of |
the Elizabethan period, in last night's J
, Tudor lccture on "Madrigal Music."
Miss McCall traced the survival of
the madrigal to the fact that it is a
reflection of the period in which it was
written. Both as a heritage of English
speaking people and for its beauty it
self, the madrigal has lived, according
i to Miss McCall.

The madrigal is a sort of personal I
music in which all can participate
emotionally, Miss McCall pointed out.
It expresses all the subtleties of the
various moods without losing its qual-
I Ity of abstractness, and for most, effect
I it must be produced in intimate sur
' roundings.
However, it. must not be thought
! that the English were the innovators
of this vital form of music. Miss Mc-
Call explained. The English devel
oped the madrigal, instilled something ,
in it, and gave it spontaneity and ro- j
business, But the madrigal itself was '

| originally a form of pastoral music
from Spain.
The madrigal really performed a
social function, according to Miss Mc-
Call. Singing madrigals was a popu
lar form of after-dinner entertainment.
In fact, servants were frequently en
gaged more for their ability to carry
a tunc than for carrying a tray.
According to Miss McCall, the mad
rigal music can best be described as a
form of musical conversation, destined
I to appeal to those who would like the
| beauty of music integrated with the
' beauty of poetry.
