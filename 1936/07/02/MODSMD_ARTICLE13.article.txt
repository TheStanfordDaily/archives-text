# Sandiford To Lecture On U.S., Canada
## Toronto Man To Speak On How America Influences Her Northern Neighbor 
### 
"The American Impact on Canada"
is the topic to be discussed by Profes
sor Peter Sandiford, acting professor
of psychology at Stanford, when he
will give the second lecture in the vis
iting professor series this evening at
8 o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse.
Relationships between the United
States and Canada, and the similari
ties and subtle differences in the two
countries and their respective prob
lems, will be included in the talk by
the Canadian psychologist.
"Each country influences and is in
fluenced by the other. In Canada's
case the American impact is very
great." Professor Sandiford intends to
show how the "bigger, richer, and
more highly developed country to the
south tends at all times to turn Cana
dians into Americans."
The equality of reciprocity between
the neighbor countries has been over
balanced by the Canadians, who con
tinually look to the United States for
leadership, especially in educational
research problems, according to an
advance statement on the topic.
Canada's debatable future destiny
of ultimate absorption by the United
States will also be discussed in the
lecture.
Professor Sandiford received his
Ph.D. in 1910 from Columbia Univer
sity, and he has been professor of Edu
cational Psychology at the University
of Toronto since 1920. He has also
taught at Manchester University, and
at summer sessions at the University
of California and Columbia.
