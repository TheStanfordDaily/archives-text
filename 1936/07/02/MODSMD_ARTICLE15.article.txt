# Notes on a Theater- To-Be
## 
### David Brown 
Now that the staccato rhythm of
the riveter gives certainty to the con- '
st ruction of a new Stanford theater,
some people are beginning to ponder I
the meaning of it all. They want to j
know where the artists are coming j
from. They want to know where the j
audiences are coming from. And fi- i
nally, they want to know what con- J
tribution university dramatics make'
to the university community.
The university theater always has!
been a curiously hybrid creature of j
happy frolic and serious, usually very :
sad, theater. Unfortunately, univer- 1
.sity dramatics have been stunted by |
their unhappy position as an extra- j
curricular activity somewhere between
college journalism and intercollegiate j
football. In such an arid region no |
art could long endure.
Many Succeed Professionally
It is true that many actors and ac- !
tresses have obtained professional !
success in spite of college dramatics. [
Tins is not to say that college dra
matics and those connected with them
are at fault. The factors at fault rjre
ihe conditions under which university
dramatic activity must take place.
The most irreconcilable of those
conditions is the assumption by many
that one can play at dramatics, that ]
they are something to be taken in
leisure time as a sort of chaser to the
stronger stuff of college life. This as
sumption defeats the acquisition by
the student of any professional habits
or attitudes. The theater is very much
an all-or-none proposition. Admin
istered in weak doses it produces a
very bad taste. And bad or, what is
worse, mediocre theater is one mani
festation of hell on earth.
In view of the coming Stanford the
ater, I think it very pertinent for those
interested to consider the possibility
of a more secure and recognized posi
tion for university dramatics. The
great new structure must have the
opporunity of developing a tradition
consistent with its magnificence.
Stanford has had its artists, is hav
ing them, but must have them in in
creasing numbers in the future.
Alumni who have gone on to the
world of the professional theater such
as Homer Curran, Maxwell Anderson,
Philip Nolan and others, I am sure
would approve of any move to make
the Stanford theater artistically secure
in its new home.
Dramatics Must Be Open
But the mistake must not be made

of creating a dramatic closed shop. .
There must be opportunity for all to
engage in the multitude of details that '
surround college dramatics. It is in
teresting to point out that the men who j
were the artists in the Stanford theater j
of the early days are now, in many j
cases, men high in the business world. J
In 1913, the book of the musical
comedy, "The Girl and the Voice," !
produced at Stanford, was written by '
Paul Eliel, new head of the Industrial
Relations Division.
A three-act campus musical comedy, '
"The Man from Mizzoury," produced
at the beginning of the century, has j
words and music credited to Merle j
H. Thorpe, '05, editor of "Nation's j
Business."
On the other hand, Will Irwin, now !
famous as a journalist, served as stage j
manager for such a production as "A
Bone of Contention." Who knows but |
that the author of the great play of j
1902, "Driven Back to Egypt, or The !
Riddle of the Sphynx," was written i
by some collegian who since then has I
not dared to lift a pen.
« Audience Related to Theater
But about our new theater. Where !
are the audiences coming from? I j
think that it is admitted that attend
ance at campus theatricals is rather j
poor. Is the interest lacking, or is ;
the "theater" lacking? I think the I
fault must fall on both, and indeed,
the two things are interrelated. I
am as equally sure that good theater I
will attract good audiences as that
good audiences will encourage good
theater. The two elements must be set j
into play if we are to make our new
theater worth the trouble.
The emergence of a full-grown art
on a university campus is not only
a contribution in itself, it is an event, i
Good theater, in the full meaning of
that phrase, housed in gracious and
appropriate surroundings, is such an
art. And as an art it is a contribu
tion to the civilization of any com
munity. Mature and well cared for,
i college dramatics can achieve what the
commercial theater must forever foi'e
go—an artistic independence born of
an audience that, by its very nature,
is highly selective.
One person out of every 44 in Ken
tucky is an applicant for a place on
the state payroll, says J. W. Man
ning, state director of personnel ef
ficiency.

« Audience Related to Theater
But about our new theater. Where !
are the audiences coming from? I j
think that it is admitted that attend
ance at campus theatricals is rather j
poor. Is the interest lacking, or is ;
the "theater" lacking? I think the I
fault must fall on both, and indeed,
the two things are interrelated. I
am as equally sure that good theater I
will attract good audiences as that
good audiences will encourage good
theater. The two elements must be set j
into play if we are to make our new
theater worth the trouble.
The emergence of a full-grown art
on a university campus is not only
a contribution in itself, it is an event, i
Good theater, in the full meaning of
that phrase, housed in gracious and
appropriate surroundings, is such an
art. And as an art it is a contribu
tion to the civilization of any com
munity. Mature and well cared for,
i college dramatics can achieve what the
commercial theater must forever foi'e
go—an artistic independence born of
an audience that, by its very nature,
is highly selective.
One person out of every 44 in Ken
tucky is an applicant for a place on
the state payroll, says J. W. Man
ning, state director of personnel ef
ficiency.
Now that the staccato rhythm of
the riveter gives certainty to the con- '
st ruction of a new Stanford theater,
some people are beginning to ponder I
the meaning of it all. They want to j
know where the artists are coming j
from. They want to know where the j
audiences are coming from. And fi- i
nally, they want to know what con- J
tribution university dramatics make'
to the university community.
The university theater always has!
been a curiously hybrid creature of j
happy frolic and serious, usually very :
sad, theater. Unfortunately, univer- 1
.sity dramatics have been stunted by |
their unhappy position as an extra- j
curricular activity somewhere between
college journalism and intercollegiate j
football. In such an arid region no |
art could long endure.
Many Succeed Professionally
It is true that many actors and ac- !
tresses have obtained professional !
success in spite of college dramatics. [
Tins is not to say that college dra
matics and those connected with them
are at fault. The factors at fault rjre
ihe conditions under which university
dramatic activity must take place.
The most irreconcilable of those
conditions is the assumption by many
that one can play at dramatics, that ]
they are something to be taken in
leisure time as a sort of chaser to the
stronger stuff of college life. This as
sumption defeats the acquisition by
the student of any professional habits
or attitudes. The theater is very much
an all-or-none proposition. Admin
istered in weak doses it produces a
very bad taste. And bad or, what is
worse, mediocre theater is one mani
festation of hell on earth.
In view of the coming Stanford the
ater, I think it very pertinent for those
interested to consider the possibility
of a more secure and recognized posi
tion for university dramatics. The
great new structure must have the
opporunity of developing a tradition
consistent with its magnificence.
Stanford has had its artists, is hav
ing them, but must have them in in
creasing numbers in the future.
Alumni who have gone on to the
world of the professional theater such
as Homer Curran, Maxwell Anderson,
Philip Nolan and others, I am sure
would approve of any move to make
the Stanford theater artistically secure
in its new home.
Dramatics Must Be Open
But the mistake must not be made

of creating a dramatic closed shop. .
There must be opportunity for all to
engage in the multitude of details that '
surround college dramatics. It is in
teresting to point out that the men who j
were the artists in the Stanford theater j
of the early days are now, in many j
cases, men high in the business world. J

are at fault. The factors at fault rjre
ihe conditions under which university
dramatic activity must take place.
The most irreconcilable of those
conditions is the assumption by many
that one can play at dramatics, that ]
they are something to be taken in
leisure time as a sort of chaser to the
stronger stuff of college life. This as
sumption defeats the acquisition by
the student of any professional habits
or attitudes. The theater is very much
an all-or-none proposition. Admin
istered in weak doses it produces a
very bad taste. And bad or, what is
worse, mediocre theater is one mani
festation of hell on earth.
In view of the coming Stanford the
ater, I think it very pertinent for those
interested to consider the possibility
of a more secure and recognized posi
tion for university dramatics. The
great new structure must have the
opporunity of developing a tradition
consistent with its magnificence.
Stanford has had its artists, is hav
ing them, but must have them in in
creasing numbers in the future.
Alumni who have gone on to the
world of the professional theater such
as Homer Curran, Maxwell Anderson,
Philip Nolan and others, I am sure
would approve of any move to make
the Stanford theater artistically secure
in its new home.
Dramatics Must Be Open
But the mistake must not be made

of creating a dramatic closed shop. .
There must be opportunity for all to
engage in the multitude of details that '
surround college dramatics. It is in
teresting to point out that the men who j
were the artists in the Stanford theater j
of the early days are now, in many j
cases, men high in the business world. J
In 1913, the book of the musical
comedy, "The Girl and the Voice," !
produced at Stanford, was written by '
Paul Eliel, new head of the Industrial
Relations Division.
A three-act campus musical comedy, '
"The Man from Mizzoury," produced
at the beginning of the century, has j
words and music credited to Merle j
H. Thorpe, '05, editor of "Nation's j
Business."
On the other hand, Will Irwin, now !
famous as a journalist, served as stage j
manager for such a production as "A
Bone of Contention." Who knows but |
that the author of the great play of j
1902, "Driven Back to Egypt, or The !
Riddle of the Sphynx," was written i
by some collegian who since then has I
not dared to lift a pen.
« Audience Related to Theater
But about our new theater. Where !
are the audiences coming from? I j
think that it is admitted that attend
ance at campus theatricals is rather j
poor. Is the interest lacking, or is ;
the "theater" lacking? I think the I
fault must fall on both, and indeed,
the two things are interrelated. I
am as equally sure that good theater I
will attract good audiences as that
good audiences will encourage good
theater. The two elements must be set j
into play if we are to make our new
theater worth the trouble.
The emergence of a full-grown art
on a university campus is not only
a contribution in itself, it is an event, i
Good theater, in the full meaning of
that phrase, housed in gracious and
appropriate surroundings, is such an
art. And as an art it is a contribu
tion to the civilization of any com
munity. Mature and well cared for,
i college dramatics can achieve what the
commercial theater must forever foi'e
go—an artistic independence born of
an audience that, by its very nature,
is highly selective.
One person out of every 44 in Ken
tucky is an applicant for a place on
the state payroll, says J. W. Man
ning, state director of personnel ef
ficiency.
Now that the staccato rhythm of
the riveter gives certainty to the con- '
st ruction of a new Stanford theater,
some people are beginning to ponder I
the meaning of it all. They want to j
know where the artists are coming j
from. They want to know where the j
audiences are coming from. And fi- i
nally, they want to know what con- J
tribution university dramatics make'
to the university community.
The university theater always has!
been a curiously hybrid creature of j
happy frolic and serious, usually very :
sad, theater. Unfortunately, univer- 1
.sity dramatics have been stunted by |
their unhappy position as an extra- j
curricular activity somewhere between
college journalism and intercollegiate j
football. In such an arid region no |
art could long endure.
Many Succeed Professionally
It is true that many actors and ac- !
tresses have obtained professional !
success in spite of college dramatics. [
