The Editor, Sir:
An "old student returning" "views
with alarm" "the dear old 'Farm'."
There are plenty of attractions
which, as before, make one glad to
return. "Die Luft der Freiheit blaht"
even more than ever before. (I stand
a little aghast yt the freedom of
speech and wonder if I am still in the
United States as an employee of
boards of trustees.)
All checks are still made "payable
to Stanford University." Improve
ments on the campus in the manner
of buildings and planting are most
marked and gratifying.
Startling Contrast
The contrast between the number of
machines now on the campus and the
few glorious old wrecks which used to
be parked behind Encina is rather
startling. The fact that bread is still
being passed in the eating clubs by
the old discus method assures me that
the same old gang of Stanford Men is
still on the job.
Why in tarnation, ihough, doesn't
someone donate ten dollars to the Uni
versity to fix a few of the seats? In
the very department which is sup
posed to be training teachers how to
conduct and maintain schools the class
room arrangements are the worst, not
that they are much better anywhere
else. A certain window and a certain
seat in one class room have been
broken since nineteen twenty. I know
because I helped break them.
Over Wrong Shoulder
In rooms where it would have been
just as easy to set the seats so that
the light comes over the left shoulder,
they have been placed so that it comes
over the right. Throughout, the class
rooms look as though all the old furni
ture the public schools of the state
have discarded had been collected to
furnish the rooms in this, the seat of
all learning. If the types of chairs
were even only sorted out it would
be better than it is.
What virtue is there in having class
rooms look like second-hand furni
ture stores? Does it contribute to
true scholarship in a way I cannot
understand? Is there an explanation?
It cannot be a matter of money be
cause other equipment is quite com
plete and in the dormitories almost
elegant. I'd like to know.
Yours truly,
—E. M. S.

room arrangements are the worst, not
that they are much better anywhere
else. A certain window and a certain
seat in one class room have been
broken since nineteen twenty. I know
because I helped break them.
Over Wrong Shoulder
In rooms where it would have been
just as easy to set the seats so that
the light comes over the left shoulder,
they have been placed so that it comes
over the right. Throughout, the class
rooms look as though all the old furni
ture the public schools of the state
have discarded had been collected to
furnish the rooms in this, the seat of
all learning. If the types of chairs
were even only sorted out it would
be better than it is.
What virtue is there in having class
rooms look like second-hand furni
ture stores? Does it contribute to
true scholarship in a way I cannot
understand? Is there an explanation?
It cannot be a matter of money be
cause other equipment is quite com
plete and in the dormitories almost
elegant. I'd like to know.

The Editor, Sir:
An "old student returning" "views
with alarm" "the dear old 'Farm'."
There are plenty of attractions
which, as before, make one glad to
return. "Die Luft der Freiheit blaht"
even more than ever before. (I stand
a little aghast yt the freedom of
speech and wonder if I am still in the
United States as an employee of
boards of trustees.)
All checks are still made "payable
to Stanford University." Improve
ments on the campus in the manner
of buildings and planting are most
marked and gratifying.
Startling Contrast
The contrast between the number of
machines now on the campus and the
few glorious old wrecks which used to
be parked behind Encina is rather
startling. The fact that bread is still
being passed in the eating clubs by
the old discus method assures me that
the same old gang of Stanford Men is
still on the job.
Why in tarnation, ihough, doesn't
someone donate ten dollars to the Uni
versity to fix a few of the seats? In
the very department which is sup
posed to be training teachers how to
conduct and maintain schools the class
room arrangements are the worst, not
that they are much better anywhere
else. A certain window and a certain
seat in one class room have been
broken since nineteen twenty. I know
because I helped break them.
