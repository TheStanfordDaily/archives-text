# Mear's Book Wins Acclaim
## 
### 
World - wide recognition of the i
value of "Maritime Trade of Western
United States," written by Dr. Eliot G.
Mears, director of summer quarter, and
recently "published by the Stanford
University Press, is indicated in the
following quotations from a review
published in "Lloyd's List," London
publication read by shipping and in
surance executives:
"The historian of the future will have
his task considerably lightened by his
ability to refer to such authoritative
works as the 'Maritime Trade of West
ern United States' . . .
Detailed Knowledge
"Dr. Mears writes as a historian, a
geographer and an economist, and in
all his capacities writes with the de
tailed knowledge which inspires con
fidence. Geographically the scope of
the book is limited, and may be said
thus to gain in value.
"Tlie author's view is that the time
is at hand for the preparation of ship
ping studies centering about the geo
graphical background and development
of important areas, and it is with that
end in view that Dr. Mears tackles his
intensive study of transpacific ship
ping, covering that region which in
cludes California, Washington, the
Mountain States, Alaska and Hawaii.
"Two chapters are of particular in
terest to the general reader as distin
guished from the seeker after de
tailed knowledge of American ship
ping facilities. The first is that devoted
to the effects of the Panama Canal.
Here indeed is a fascinating story of
a great achievement complete even
with a table showing the shipping
record of the canal for a single week
as an example of the role played by
Panama in maritime geography. The
opening of the Panama Canal now
seems to be an event of far-off days,
but the first ship passed through only
22 years ago . . .
Useful Suggestions
"The chapter devoted to pitfalls in
shipping statistics is both of interest

and of value to anyone who has to
deal with statistical information of
any kind, containing many useful sug
gestions as to how tables of figures
should be approached. Dr. Mears of
fers much comfort to those who often
confess themselves puzzled by sta
tistical inconsistencies.
"There are equally interesting chap
ters devoted to types of vessels and
services, ocean traffic between the
Western States and all parts of the
world, shipping conferences, subsidies,
and a forecast of the future develop
ment of the region with which the
volume deals specially."
