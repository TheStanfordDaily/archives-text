state of flux."
A "191J6 Platform for Schools" will

the planks will be statements con
cerning academic freedom and the
proper role of the school in improv
ing life in a democracy.
More than 200 Pacific Coast lead

as guidance in the CCC and the class

radio, the theater, and the press.
Among the features of the conference
will be an address by United States
Commissioner of Education, John W.
Studebaker. Studebaker in his work

lowa, has pointed the road to more
effective adult education programs,
observers here declare.
