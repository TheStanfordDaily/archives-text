# Stanford Athletes May Go To Olympics

"That's where Ben Eastman comes
from."
Four years ago that was the way
Stanford was identified to the majority
of a classroom of Berlin school chil- j
dren.
After this summer, indications are |
that these sports-minded Nazi young- |
sters will be able to list six or eight
associations with the name Stanford.
For the University will be repre
sented in the Tenth Olympic Games a
month from now by just about that ,
many ace athletes, including gradu- I
ates of three or four years back as !
well as present sophomores and jun- ,
iors, and in sporting events ranging
from water polo to 'baseball.
Final American tryouts in these
sports will be held within the next two
weeks, the widely publicized track
events scheduled for New York City
on June 11 and 12.
Among the Stanford men, past and
present, who are eligible to compete
in the New York final tryouts are Ben
Eastman, 800 meters; A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Jim Reynolds, shot put; Gordy j
"Slinger" Dunn, shot and discus; Phil
Levy, discus; Sam Klopstock, high
hurdles; John Mottram, javelin; Jack ;
Weiershauser, 400 meters; Ed Bur
rows, 1500 meters; Bud Deacon, pole
vault; and an adopted son, Norm
Bright, 5000 meters.
Three Places Cinched
Eastman, Dunn, and Bright are be- i
lieved to have already cinched places
on the American squad, and Reynolds
and Levy are conceded better than an
even chance of making the traveling
team.
The "Blazing Ben" Eastman of 1931-
32 who chased little Bill Carr around
400 meters in 1.C.4-A. and Olympics
of four years ago, has given up the j
one-lap event, but has, by some odds,
the year's best record over 800 meters. J
Last Saturday, Ben ran the half mile in ,
faster time than it had been run by '
any other human, falling but three- |
tenths of a second short of his own j
world record of 1:49.8.

Dunn, the "Slinger" of record dis
cus-throwing fame, last week became
Dunn, the shot - putter. Always a
better-than-average shot man, he had
never been considered an Olympic
possibility in that event until he won
a qualifying event with 52 feet 3
inches, poor two years ago when Stan
ford man John Lyman and Jack Tor
rance were throwing the ball from 54
feet to 57 feet in every meet, but as
good as has been done this year.
Reynolds' best is a half-foot behind
the Slinger's qualifying eflort, but the
two still, together with Torrance, are
at the top of a relatively inferior field.
Dunn and Levy for the past two
years have been in the same class as
discus throwers, with Dunn claiming
a slight edge in consistency. These
two and Ken Carpenter of U.S.C., all
170-footers at their best, are the best
bets for the coveted top positions.
Klopstock, captain of the '36 Stan
ford team, and an inconsistently ca
pable man in a hazardous event, "may
or may not." He barely qualified for
Ihe finals by placing a close third in
the N.C.A.A., and will be facing a
horde of a half-dozen equally good and
more generally consistent hurdlers at
New York.
Burrows Turns Miler
Burrows, a two-miler by trade, sur
prised last week in Los Angeles by
running 1500 meters in under 3:59,
which makes him an outside threat
for a place among the big-time mil
ing trio of Cunningham, Bonthron,
and Venzke.
Neither Mottram nor Weiershauser
qualified officially in Saturday's trials,
but they were given another chance
by the committee's arbitrary-selection
clause. Mottram is in a strong field
of javelin men, and like Klopstock,
he may or may not.
Weiershauser has little or no chance
at the first three positions in the 400
meters, but may sneak in for a place
on the 1600-meter relay team. People
like Archie Williams, Jimmy LuValle,
Eddie O'Brien, and Chuck Smallwood
are considered a bit out of Weiers
hauser's class.
Deacon did some pole vaulting
around the Farm two years ago, but
nothing had been heard from him this
year until he jumped 14 feet at Har
vard last week. Fourteen-foot vault
ing, though but 5 inches shy of the
world's record, however, puts Deacon
in the middle of a normal curve of
vaulters, and he'll have to move up
another two or three inches if he
wants free transport to Berlin.
The question of Stanford participa
tion outside the field of track is still
high in the air. Hopes of the Indian
swimming contingent have been nar
rowed to Dave Rider, whose best time
places him No. 3 among the nation's
milers. Teammate Wingfield Needham
may get another crack at the final
Olympic scramble over 400 and 1500
meters at Providence, R.1., next week.
Seven Stanford water-poloists are
divided and playing for two teams, ei
ther of which may win in the finals at
Chicago. These include Bill Hanna,
Bill Clemo, Jack Loupe, Chuck Giffon,
and Don Peterson, playing with the
S.F. Olympic Club, and Wally O'Con
nor, 1932 captain, and Bob Haslacher,
captain-elect, who will compete for
the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
Non-combative Stanford representa
tives at Berlin will be headed by
Graduate Manager A1 Masters, in the
capacity of assistant manager of the
American track team, and Harry Wol
ter, American baseball coach.

the year's best record over 800 meters. J
Last Saturday, Ben ran the half mile in ,
faster time than it had been run by '
any other human, falling but three- |
tenths of a second short of his own j
world record of 1:49.8.

Dunn, the "Slinger" of record dis
cus-throwing fame, last week became
Dunn, the shot - putter. Always a
better-than-average shot man, he had
never been considered an Olympic
possibility in that event until he won
a qualifying event with 52 feet 3
inches, poor two years ago when Stan
ford man John Lyman and Jack Tor
rance were throwing the ball from 54
feet to 57 feet in every meet, but as
good as has been done this year.
Reynolds' best is a half-foot behind
the Slinger's qualifying eflort, but the
two still, together with Torrance, are
at the top of a relatively inferior field.
Dunn and Levy for the past two
years have been in the same class as
discus throwers, with Dunn claiming
a slight edge in consistency. These
two and Ken Carpenter of U.S.C., all
170-footers at their best, are the best
bets for the coveted top positions.
Klopstock, captain of the '36 Stan
ford team, and an inconsistently ca
pable man in a hazardous event, "may
or may not." He barely qualified for
Ihe finals by placing a close third in
the N.C.A.A., and will be facing a
horde of a half-dozen equally good and
more generally consistent hurdlers at
New York.
Burrows Turns Miler
Burrows, a two-miler by trade, sur
prised last week in Los Angeles by
running 1500 meters in under 3:59,
which makes him an outside threat
for a place among the big-time mil
ing trio of Cunningham, Bonthron,
and Venzke.
Neither Mottram nor Weiershauser
qualified officially in Saturday's trials,
but they were given another chance
by the committee's arbitrary-selection
clause. Mottram is in a strong field
of javelin men, and like Klopstock,
he may or may not.
Weiershauser has little or no chance
at the first three positions in the 400
meters, but may sneak in for a place
on the 1600-meter relay team. People
like Archie Williams, Jimmy LuValle,
Eddie O'Brien, and Chuck Smallwood
are considered a bit out of Weiers
hauser's class.
Deacon did some pole vaulting
around the Farm two years ago, but
nothing had been heard from him this
year until he jumped 14 feet at Har
vard last week. Fourteen-foot vault
ing, though but 5 inches shy of the
world's record, however, puts Deacon
in the middle of a normal curve of
vaulters, and he'll have to move up
another two or three inches if he
wants free transport to Berlin.
The question of Stanford participa
tion outside the field of track is still
high in the air. Hopes of the Indian
swimming contingent have been nar
rowed to Dave Rider, whose best time
places him No. 3 among the nation's
milers. Teammate Wingfield Needham
may get another crack at the final
Olympic scramble over 400 and 1500
meters at Providence, R.1., next week.
Seven Stanford water-poloists are
divided and playing for two teams, ei
ther of which may win in the finals at
Chicago. These include Bill Hanna,
Bill Clemo, Jack Loupe, Chuck Giffon,
and Don Peterson, playing with the
S.F. Olympic Club, and Wally O'Con
nor, 1932 captain, and Bob Haslacher,
captain-elect, who will compete for
the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
Non-combative Stanford representa
tives at Berlin will be headed by
Graduate Manager A1 Masters, in the
capacity of assistant manager of the
American track team, and Harry Wol
ter, American baseball coach.
"That's where Ben Eastman comes
from."
Four years ago that was the way
Stanford was identified to the majority
of a classroom of Berlin school chil- j
dren.
After this summer, indications are |
that these sports-minded Nazi young- |
sters will be able to list six or eight
associations with the name Stanford.
For the University will be repre
sented in the Tenth Olympic Games a
month from now by just about that ,
many ace athletes, including gradu- I
ates of three or four years back as !
well as present sophomores and jun- ,
iors, and in sporting events ranging
from water polo to 'baseball.

sports will be held within the next two

Bright, 5000 meters.

ing trio of Cunningham, Bonthron,
and Venzke.
Neither Mottram nor Weiershauser
qualified officially in Saturday's trials,
but they were given another chance
by the committee's arbitrary-selection
clause. Mottram is in a strong field
of javelin men, and like Klopstock,
he may or may not.
Weiershauser has little or no chance
at the first three positions in the 400
meters, but may sneak in for a place
on the 1600-meter relay team. People
like Archie Williams, Jimmy LuValle,
Eddie O'Brien, and Chuck Smallwood
are considered a bit out of Weiers
hauser's class.
Deacon did some pole vaulting
around the Farm two years ago, but
nothing had been heard from him this
year until he jumped 14 feet at Har
vard last week. Fourteen-foot vault
ing, though but 5 inches shy of the
world's record, however, puts Deacon
in the middle of a normal curve of
vaulters, and he'll have to move up
another two or three inches if he
wants free transport to Berlin.
The question of Stanford participa
tion outside the field of track is still
high in the air. Hopes of the Indian
swimming contingent have been nar
rowed to Dave Rider, whose best time
places him No. 3 among the nation's
milers. Teammate Wingfield Needham
may get another crack at the final
Olympic scramble over 400 and 1500
meters at Providence, R.1., next week.
Seven Stanford water-poloists are
divided and playing for two teams, ei
ther of which may win in the finals at
Chicago. These include Bill Hanna,
Bill Clemo, Jack Loupe, Chuck Giffon,
and Don Peterson, playing with the
S.F. Olympic Club, and Wally O'Con
nor, 1932 captain, and Bob Haslacher,
captain-elect, who will compete for
the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
Non-combative Stanford representa
tives at Berlin will be headed by
Graduate Manager A1 Masters, in the
capacity of assistant manager of the
American track team, and Harry Wol
ter, American baseball coach.
"That's where Ben Eastman comes
from."
Four years ago that was the way
Stanford was identified to the majority
of a classroom of Berlin school chil- j
dren.
After this summer, indications are |
that these sports-minded Nazi young- |
sters will be able to list six or eight
associations with the name Stanford.
For the University will be repre
sented in the Tenth Olympic Games a
month from now by just about that ,
many ace athletes, including gradu- I
ates of three or four years back as !
well as present sophomores and jun- ,
iors, and in sporting events ranging
from water polo to 'baseball.
Final American tryouts in these
sports will be held within the next two
weeks, the widely publicized track
events scheduled for New York City
on June 11 and 12.
Among the Stanford men, past and
present, who are eligible to compete
in the New York final tryouts are Ben
Eastman, 800 meters; A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Jim Reynolds, shot put; Gordy j
"Slinger" Dunn, shot and discus; Phil
Levy, discus; Sam Klopstock, high
hurdles; John Mottram, javelin; Jack ;
Weiershauser, 400 meters; Ed Bur
rows, 1500 meters; Bud Deacon, pole
vault; and an adopted son, Norm
Bright, 5000 meters.
Three Places Cinched
Eastman, Dunn, and Bright are be- i
lieved to have already cinched places
on the American squad, and Reynolds
and Levy are conceded better than an
even chance of making the traveling
team.
The "Blazing Ben" Eastman of 1931-
32 who chased little Bill Carr around
400 meters in 1.C.4-A. and Olympics
of four years ago, has given up the j
one-lap event, but has, by some odds,
the year's best record over 800 meters. J
Last Saturday, Ben ran the half mile in ,
faster time than it had been run by '
any other human, falling but three- |
tenths of a second short of his own j
world record of 1:49.8.

Dunn, the "Slinger" of record dis
cus-throwing fame, last week became
Dunn, the shot - putter. Always a
better-than-average shot man, he had
never been considered an Olympic
possibility in that event until he won
a qualifying event with 52 feet 3
inches, poor two years ago when Stan
ford man John Lyman and Jack Tor
rance were throwing the ball from 54
feet to 57 feet in every meet, but as
good as has been done this year.
Reynolds' best is a half-foot behind
the Slinger's qualifying eflort, but the
two still, together with Torrance, are
at the top of a relatively inferior field.
Dunn and Levy for the past two
years have been in the same class as
discus throwers, with Dunn claiming
a slight edge in consistency. These
two and Ken Carpenter of U.S.C., all
170-footers at their best, are the best
bets for the coveted top positions.
Klopstock, captain of the '36 Stan
ford team, and an inconsistently ca
pable man in a hazardous event, "may
or may not." He barely qualified for
Ihe finals by placing a close third in
the N.C.A.A., and will be facing a
horde of a half-dozen equally good and
more generally consistent hurdlers at
New York.
Burrows Turns Miler
Burrows, a two-miler by trade, sur
prised last week in Los Angeles by
running 1500 meters in under 3:59,
which makes him an outside threat
for a place among the big-time mil
ing trio of Cunningham, Bonthron,
and Venzke.
Neither Mottram nor Weiershauser
