# LYMAN MUST RETURN
## 
### 
The case of Lyman vs. the peo
ple of the American Olympic
Committee finally has been de
cided. Sentence: the 54-8 putter
won't qualify unless he comes
back to New York from his stud
ies in a German university, and
he deems such policy economi
cally impossible. Lyman will be
a spectator at the Games.
