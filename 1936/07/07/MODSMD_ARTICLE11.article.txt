# Paly Playhouse Talent Center
## 
### 
Stanford students know of one Palo
j Alto organization which is thor
oughly democratic. The Community
' Playhouse has so far proved itself
| invaluable as a recreational center
| for all types of local talent.
Students from Stanford have been
j finding the Center an entrance into
; campus dramatics as well as excellent
i experience. The Palo Alto group has
| many University members and with
i their abundance of production they
j have managed to utilize much talent
i lhat never received a chance on the
I campus.
During summer months the play
| house not only continues its dramatic
curriculum but also organizes classes
for the younger generation. The city
considers it part of the recreational
program to provide entertainment for
children of grammar school age.
Classes are being given in numerous
forms of handicraft, in dancing, and
[ in vocal expression under able super
j visors.
Marvin Kahn, ex-president of the
i Stanford student body and member
I of the Board of Athletic Control, is the
recently appointed supervisor of the
| theater and recreational programs.
! While at Stanford Kahn was largely
j responsible for arousing interest in
j the Stanford Theater project.
