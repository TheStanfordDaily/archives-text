# Hoover Library Exhibits War Time Hum or
## 
### 
' Humor, oftentimes tinged with sar
' casm, ran rampant even during the
darkest days of the World War. Some
of the most characteristic examples of
war-time humor are now being ex
hibited at the Stanford Hoover War
Library.
London's famous magazine, "Blighty,"
depicted many warfront situations
from the comical side. A tall tower is
shown in one—huge holes up and down
its sides gape at the two doughboys
who remark, "Looks as if they've
been trying to make a tin whistle of
that."

Another page, this one from "Frag
j ments from France," pictures two
i slightly jumpy and startled dough
j boys in ji small hole at the front. Shells
and bullets are zooming all about

I them. In answer to the worried ex
pression on his pal's face, one yells,
' "Well, if you knows of a better ole,
! go to it."
The French interpretation of the
t "Grand Life at Berlin" i.s shown in a
j cartoon in which hungry looking peo
; pie seated at individual tables—bare
except for a chipped dish and a flower
j drooping out of a rakish vase. A shag-
I gy-haired violinist wanders from ta
' ble to table playing for the customers,
and as he stops at the table where a
dejected man is sitting he tucks his
violin under his chin and asks, "What
piece does Monsieur prefer?" "A piece
of bread" was the desolate reply.

Another bit of humor presents a
! scene at a ticket office. Tripper Wil
helm, splendid in his uniform and
! staggering under the weight of his

baggage, goes up to the window and
says, "First class to Paris."
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Then make it. Warsaw."
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Well, what about Ca
lais?"
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Hang it! I must go some
where! I promised my people I would."
In spite of the humorous interpre
tations of the war situations, there
were many stabs at common sense and
sympathy. One particularly striking
example depicts an arena with organ
ized rooting sections for the various
countries. In the center are two
husky men fighting desperately for the
"championship." The caption reads,
"There might be a great saving of
human 'ife if each of the contending
armies were to select a champion."

London's famous magazine, "Blighty,"
depicted many warfront situations
from the comical side. A tall tower is
shown in one—huge holes up and down
its sides gape at the two doughboys
who remark, "Looks as if they've
been trying to make a tin whistle of
that."

Another page, this one from "Frag

i slightly jumpy and startled dough

and bullets are zooming all about

I them. In answer to the worried ex
pression on his pal's face, one yells,

and as he stops at the table where a
dejected man is sitting he tucks his
violin under his chin and asks, "What
piece does Monsieur prefer?" "A piece
of bread" was the desolate reply.

Another bit of humor presents a
! scene at a ticket office. Tripper Wil
helm, splendid in his uniform and
! staggering under the weight of his

baggage, goes up to the window and
says, "First class to Paris."
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Then make it. Warsaw."
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Well, what about Ca
lais?"
Clerk: "Line blocked."
Wilhelm: "Hang it! I must go some
where! I promised my people I would."
In spite of the humorous interpre
tations of the war situations, there
were many stabs at common sense and
sympathy. One particularly striking
example depicts an arena with organ
ized rooting sections for the various
countries. In the center are two
husky men fighting desperately for the
"championship." The caption reads,
"There might be a great saving of
human 'ife if each of the contending
armies were to select a champion."
' Humor, oftentimes tinged with sar
' casm, ran rampant even during the
darkest days of the World War. Some
of the most characteristic examples of
war-time humor are now being ex
hibited at the Stanford Hoover War
Library.
