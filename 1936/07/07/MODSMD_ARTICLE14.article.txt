# U.S. Liberties In Danger Counts Tells Educators
## Many Attend Conference On Curriculum Education Professor From Columbia Is Speaker At First of Night Meetings 
### 
"The fundamental liberties of the
American people which are guaran
teed in the Bill of Rights are in greater
danger today than at any time since
the end of the eighteenth century,"
said Professor George S. Counts last
night in the assembly hall to promi
nent educators attending the Confer
ence on Curriculum and Guidance.
Speaking to a capacity audience he
developed the thesis that, although po
litical democracy still remains, we are
fast losing the social and economic
democracy that once was the heritage
of American citizenship.
"The conservation of American de
mocracy is the supreme educational
question of the present age," declared
the New York champion of academic
freedom.
Political Democracy
"Whether political democracy can be
employed effectively to rebuild the
economic foundations of democracy is
the prime issue," he declared.
Explaining that "the present situa
tion is very similar to the time of the
rise of Jeffersonian democracy," Pro
fessor Counts asserted that in those
days the conservatives feared the peo
ple who were on the march demanding
political rights. "Today the people are
on the march, demanding economic lib
erties," he continued.
Professor Counts sought, to empha
size the responsibility vested in the
educators of this country to help main
tain American ideals of democracy.
"Can the public schools, co-operating
with other democratic forces, save
American democracy?" he challenged
the assembled educators.
Challenge Presented
Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, chairman
of yesterday's opening sessions, in his
introductory statement s to the confer
ence members explained: "Periods of
rapid and of fundamental change, such
as the one through which we are now
passing, present an important chal
lenge to educational workers. If the
people in a democracy are to make
wise changes, they must have an un
derstanding of the modern conditions
and the problems which need to be met,
and the adequacy of the various pro
posals for change."
Earlier in the day Professor Hoi lis
L. Caswell spoke on "The Practical
Problems of Improving the Curricu
lum" to the first general session of this
summer's conference.
Stating that the three outstanding
problems concerned the giving to
the curriculum of a basic social orien
tation, the facilitating of the develop
ment of integrated personalities, and
the establishment of a curriculum that
would more perfectly meet the needs
of American youth, he suggested that
there should be a greater emphasis on
basic principles together with a bold
but well - conceived .exploration and
experimentation.
Although the Registrar could give
no final figure as to the number of per
sons enrolled for the education con
ference, it was reported late last night
that approximately eight hundred had
already registered and it was expected
that the final figure would exceed one
thousand.

summer's conference.
Stating that the three outstanding
problems concerned the giving to
the curriculum of a basic social orien
tation, the facilitating of the develop
ment of integrated personalities, and
the establishment of a curriculum that
would more perfectly meet the needs
of American youth, he suggested that
there should be a greater emphasis on
basic principles together with a bold
but well - conceived .exploration and
experimentation.
Although the Registrar could give
no final figure as to the number of per
sons enrolled for the education con
ference, it was reported late last night
that approximately eight hundred had
already registered and it was expected
that the final figure would exceed one
thousand.
"The fundamental liberties of the
American people which are guaran
teed in the Bill of Rights are in greater
danger today than at any time since
the end of the eighteenth century,"
said Professor George S. Counts last
night in the assembly hall to promi
nent educators attending the Confer
ence on Curriculum and Guidance.
Speaking to a capacity audience he
developed the thesis that, although po
litical democracy still remains, we are
fast losing the social and economic
democracy that once was the heritage
of American citizenship.
"The conservation of American de
mocracy is the supreme educational
question of the present age," declared
the New York champion of academic
freedom.
Political Democracy
"Whether political democracy can be
employed effectively to rebuild the
economic foundations of democracy is
the prime issue," he declared.
Explaining that "the present situa
tion is very similar to the time of the
rise of Jeffersonian democracy," Pro
fessor Counts asserted that in those
days the conservatives feared the peo
ple who were on the march demanding
political rights. "Today the people are
on the march, demanding economic lib
erties," he continued.
Professor Counts sought, to empha
size the responsibility vested in the
educators of this country to help main
tain American ideals of democracy.
"Can the public schools, co-operating
with other democratic forces, save
American democracy?" he challenged
the assembled educators.
Challenge Presented
Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, chairman
of yesterday's opening sessions, in his
introductory statement s to the confer
ence members explained: "Periods of
rapid and of fundamental change, such
as the one through which we are now
passing, present an important chal
lenge to educational workers. If the
people in a democracy are to make
wise changes, they must have an un
derstanding of the modern conditions
and the problems which need to be met,
and the adequacy of the various pro
posals for change."
Earlier in the day Professor Hoi lis
L. Caswell spoke on "The Practical
Problems of Improving the Curricu
lum" to the first general session of this
summer's conference.
