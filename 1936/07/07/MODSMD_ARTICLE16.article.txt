# Loyalty Oaths Attacked By N.Y. Educator
## Roosevelt Is Lauded While Influence of Hearst Is Deplored by Professor 
### Stephen Enke 
"Hearst is one of the greatest dan
gers to American democracy today,"
declared Professor George S. Counts
at a press conference here last night.
He described the publisher's recent
ban on the use of the name Stanford
as "petty and childish." The Columbia
educator expressed the opinion that
one of the greatest dangers with which
America is faced today is that of a
powerful press, irresponsibly con
trolled, and used as a tool of those with
great wealth.
Although he claims he is not af
filiated to any one political party, Pro
fessor Counts stated that he hoped
President Roosevelt will be re-elected
this fall, because, as he put it, "Roose
velt, although some of his policies seem
contradictory, is at least conscious of
the underlying forces that exist today."
Loss Is Deplored
Developing the thesis that economic
power leads normally to social and po
litical power in consequence, Professor
Counts deplored the loss of economic
democracy in America as he fears that,
unless this loss is regained, the people
of this country may in turn lose those
social and political rights they now
possess.
Unless we in this country exercise
constant vigilance, he feels that the
old rights Americans once enjoyed will
be lost forever to us. He condemned
the California criminal syndicalism
law as well as loyalty oaths for teach
ers as the first steps toward losing
our ancient rights.
Task before America
The task before America today, he
insisted, is to make use of our politi
cal democracy to bring back the social
and economic democracy that we once
knew. If we are to do this we must be
allowed a free educational system so
that the American citizen, as a voter,
can make use of this last remaining
right to full advantage.
