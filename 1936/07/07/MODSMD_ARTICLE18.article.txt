LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY is
a beautiful follow-up to David Cop
perfield. In it British Freddie Bar
tholomew again amazes you wiui his |
magnificent poise and charm. There
are times when you cannot believe that
you are looking at and listening to
child actor, so polished and adult is j
the performance that he gives.
Even as the ordinary Brooklynite
who stoutly claims to be an American, |
although it is* through his English j
father that he inherits the title of Lord I
Fauntleroy, the young player radiates i
a quality of nobility. It is in the :
scenes as the young peer that Freddie ,
reaches a pinnacle in his acting, al- j
though the poignancy of the parting
with Dearest, his mother, is gripping. '
There is no contradicting that Fred- ;
die is the star of the picture; he com- I
pletely tucks it under his arm and j
walks away with it. If second choices j
must be made, C. Aubrey Smith, the i
goutish and eccentric grandfather, and j
Dolores Costello Barrymore, Dearest, |
are worthy fellow players.
Mary Hodgson Burnett may have j
written this story but Hollywood scores
with an adaptation that will undoubt
edly remain longer in the memory
than the novel which a few decades t
ago popularized the famous Fauntleroy
curls and velveteen suits. Ceddie, as |
played by Freddie Bartholomew, is a
likable fellow; the Lord Fauntleroy of
the story deserved the appellation of
"sissy." Splendid photography of Eng
lish countryside scenes and the fact
that each and every one of the sup
porting cast is accurately fitted to his
role further distinguish this play as
one of the best of the 1936 pictures.
