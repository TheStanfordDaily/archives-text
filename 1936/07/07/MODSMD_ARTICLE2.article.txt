# Canadians Are Like Americans

"Canadians chew gum, listen to the
. c ;ame radio programs, play the same
games, use the same kind of currency
and drive the same types of cars as
Americans," declared Dr. Peter Sandi
ford, acting professor of psychology, in
the second lecture of the visiting pro
fessor series last Thursday evening.

"In many ways," Dr. Sandiford said,
"there is a greater community of feel
ing between Canadians and Americans
than'between Canadians and the Eng
lish. The trade for each of them repre
sents the greatest volume of interna
tional trade respectively achieved by
each country. Moreover, the invest
ments of Americans in Canada amount
to two-fifths of the total capital in
vestment of the country."
Dr. Sandiford said the educational
system more nearly approaches that of
the United States than that of Great
Britain. Canada uses the 8-4-4 sys
tem for her schools and looks to the
United States for leadership in educa
tional research.

Dr. Sandiford stated further that
some influential Canadians maintain
that Canada's destiny is ultimate ab
sorption into the Republic. "Others,
and they are the majority, say that
Canada has an important role to play,
namely, to interpret the United States
to Great Britain, and to interpret Great
Britain to the United States. This
middle position in language, education,
industry, and politics is the one that
Canada seems destined to occupy fo*.
many years to come."
