# Little Hope of Averting War, Says Harris
## Same Basic Ideas Control World Now That Were Responsible for Last War 
### 
"The same basic institutions and
ideas control us which were responsible
for the last great war," declared Dr.
David Harris, associate professor of
history at Stanford, in his talk on the
Stanford Radio Hour last night.
"It needs no prophet to foretell that
we have slender hope of escaping the
next—unless something is done about
modifying those institutions and ideas.
It should be understood in all clarity
that if we wish to keep the sovereign
state and the thrills of nationalism,
they have to be purchased at a price
that makes them the most expensive
blessing—and the most expensive emo
tional orgy—that have ever been de
vised," Dr. Harris asserted.
# Dr. Harris declared that by 1918
many were hoping the sovereign states
would be subject to a reign of law and
that the dangers inherent in a chaotic
world of sovereign states might be
remedied.
"Today that hope is all but vanished.
The dream of 1918 has given way to a
nightmare of fear like that which en
! thralled Europe in 1914."
