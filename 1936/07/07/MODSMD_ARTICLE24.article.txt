# French Lift American Words Movie Influence Strong
## 
### 
No other medium is so effective in
introducing American words and ex
pressions into current French speech
as are the American - made motion
pictures, according to Howard C. Rice
in an article in the first issue of the
Franco - American Review, published
by the Yale University Press.
This journal, which will be issued
quarterly, is devoted to the cultural
and historical relations of France and
America. The publication, edited by
American and French editorial boards,
is bi-lingual; articles by French au
thors are in French, those by Ameri
cans, in English.
Mr. Rice, of Phillips Andover Acad
emy, whose study of American words
imported in France appears in the first
issue, says that words borrowed by
one language from another form an
invaluable commentary upon the
points of contact and cultural ex
changes between these two countries.
Hollywood English
Not only have the movies intro
duced American words into French,
Mr. Rice states, but some critics de
tect a corrosive influence of Hollywood
English in the French translations of
the movie sub-titles.
'"Decidedly, Hollywood has much to
answer for," Mr. Rice writes. "French
children, for example, now have
among their playthings a small animal
called 'un mickey.' French audiences
have become acquainted with long
lines of uniformed chorus girls, danc
ing with clocklike precision. They call
them 'girls,' and it is no mere accident
that the word is rarely heard in the
singular.
"It is not at all unusual to find
lurid posters summoning the inhabi
tants of some quiet French village to
see 'La Loi du Far-West' or 'Les Che
valiers du Far-West'."
"Sex Appeal" New Word
Other words that the movies have
brought into France are "une camera"
which is never applied to an ordinary
camera which is called "un kodak"; "le
sex-appeal" which, according to Mr.
Rice, a wag has suggested be trans
lated "l'appel du sexe"; and such terms
as "sunlights," "dubbings," "gags," and
"stars."
The stories of the early days of the
West which have been quite popular
in France have left their terminology
in the French language.
"Slanguage" Used
"Imagine yourself for a moment in
the badly lighted third-class carriage
of a suburban train. In the corner is
a tired workman returning home after
his day's work in Paris. He is thumb
ing a soiled book, bought for a few
pennies in the station. Oblivious to
the realities about him, he reads about
'le saloon de Black Joe a Rustlerville,
petite ville sur le bord d'une vaste
prairie du Wyoming.' The pages are
strewn with such words as 'cowboy,'

'ranch' (and 'un rancher'), 'lasso,'
Apache,' 'squatteur,' 'trappeur,' 'pros
pecteur,' 'settler,' 'scout,' 'outlaw,'
'paid,' 'poney,' 'grizzly,' and 'sherif,'
hut this reader is not conscious of their
being barbarisms. He needs no dic
tionary to understand them. It is a
curious list: for instance, the Spanish
words from across the Pyrenees which
have traveled half-way around the
world and back, or the word 'Apache,'
which has come back to America with
a wholly new meaning.
Murder Novels
"The literature of the Indian and
the West has in general sunk lower in
the social scale, so that it is usually to
be found beyond the pale of literary
respectability. The same cannot be
said of the detective novel, which en
joys great vogue in France today."
Translations of these novels have
opened up a new channel for Angli
cisms, Mr. Rice says. "Un detective"
is an importation from England, but
America has armed him with "un re
volver." Brass knuckles go by the
name of "un coup de poing americain."
"Un colt," "un browning," "un re
mington" have become common nouns.
Lynchers Well Known
Other words that are frequently en
countered in French are "la loi de
Lynch," the verb "lyncher," and the
noun "le lynchage." In recent years
"gangster" has become all too com
mon in the French press, while "un
vol a l'americaine" has a half century
or more behind it, Mr. Rice states.
"The latter term is applied to a
robbery in which the unsuspecting
victim is persuaded to make a generous
loan to some chance acquaintance, who
often impersonates an American. At
present some journalists seem to use
the term to describe a holdup. The
more subtle method may be going out
of fashion, but it still works: not long
ago a young Parisian, reporter had the

thrill of writing: 'Un jeune Americain
est escroque de 40,000 francs a l'ame
ricaine."
Many commercial terms and other
associated with business have crept
into French. Everyone is familiar with
the word "un business-man." Earlier
generations spoke of "un barnum,"
while "un babbitt" is not infrequently
met with today.
Uncle of America
"The 'oncle d'Amerique' has long
been a synonym for the 'millionnaire.'
'Trust,' often 'un trusteur,' 'boom,' and
'bluff' are well established in French
and other European languages.
" 'Avoir l'oeil americain' is used in
speaking of a person not easily out
witted in a bargain (also applied to
the brazen, self-assured look suppos
edly characteristic of American young
women). 'Un building' is not a generic
term for any construction, but either a
skyscraper or an oflice building vague
ly suggesting the architecture of mod
ern New York."
Since Seventeenth Century
Since the late seventeenth century,
French has been absorbing English
words in ever-increasing numbers, ac
cording to Mr. Rice. From time to
time attempts have been made to
warn the public against this subtle
form of foreign encroachment, but
there is nothing to show, however,
that their warnings have had any
marked effect, or that their dire pre
dictions have been fulfilled, he adds.
"The stronghold of the French
tongue seems in no immediate danger
of destruction, although the assault of
the British invaders has been notably
strengthened by the assistance of their
American cousins and allies."
