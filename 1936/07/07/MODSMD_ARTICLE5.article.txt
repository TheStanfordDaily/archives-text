# Silver Policy Lecturer's Topic

### 
"The so-called silver policy in Amer
ica would better be called the silver
racket, says Professor Kenneth Dun
can, visiting faculty member from Po
mona. Dr. Duncan will give a lecture
on "The American Silver Policy"
Thursday night at 8 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse.
In commenting on the subject Dr.
Duncan said, "Instead of promoting
economic stabilization, our silver pol
icy has been an unsettling factor, pro
longing depression and retarding re
covery. The whole sorry history is one
of shameless exploitation of the people
of the United States by a small selfish
group.
"The arts and monetary demand for
silver has been declining, and the
larger part of the new production of
silver emerges as a byproduct of other
mining processes. The annual output
of silver in this country, even in most
favorable years, forms but a micro
scopic part of the total national in
come, and is less significant than the
peanut crop or the chewing gum in
dustry," continued Professor Dun
can.
"Yet a skillful, persistent lobby on
the part of the silver interests, power
ful by virtue of a bloc of silver sena
tors maneuvering for political strategy,
has gained for silver amazing advan
tages and subsidies. It has compelled
the American government to buy hun
dreds of needless ounces of the white
metal at artificially high prices, at a
time when all the rest of the world was
only too glad to get rid of holdings of
silver, and has created serious disturb
ances in the currency systems and
price levels of friendly nations."
