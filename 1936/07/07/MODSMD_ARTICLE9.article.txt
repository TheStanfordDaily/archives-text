# Noller To Talk On Chemistry
## Rapid Advances Made In New Uses of Science 
### 
Rapid advances are being made to
j day in the applications of chemistry
to the production of old and new sub
| stances from pimple and abundant raw
1 materials, according to Dr. Carl R.
; Noller, associate professor of chemistry
. at Stanford, who will discuss "Chem
< istry Today" in a radio talk over KGO
Monday at 7:15 p.m..
Commenting on agitation to have
, the chemist assist the farmer by de
l veloping new outlets for farm prod
j ucts, Dr. Noller said, "Certain results
j in this direction have already been
I accomplished, but if chemistry is to
be of significant and lasting value to
the farmer, he must through farm co
operatives or agricultural corporations
| develop his own research organiza-
I tions."
Dr. Noller received his Ph.D. de
! gree at the University of Illinois in
, 1926, and taught at Northwestern Uni
■ versity before coming to Stanford in
1929. He also has done research work
, in Europe and for the Eastman Kodak
J Company in Rochester.
