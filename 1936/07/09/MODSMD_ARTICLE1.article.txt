# Strong Forces Sponsor Peace, Says Temperley
## Will Discuss "International Situation Today" in Talk To Be Next Tuesday Night 
### Sally Speers 
"Forces working for peace and for
restraint of aggression in Europe are
stronger than they might appear at
first sight," asserted Dr. Harold W. V.
Temperley of Cambridge, acting pro
fessor of history at Stanford. His
speech on "The International Situation
Today" will be given Tuesday in the
Little Theatre at 8 p.m.
Enlarging on this statement, Dr.
Temperley said that perhaps these
forces are strengthened by the fact
that it is now being revealed that eco
nomic sanctions alone are insufficient.
"Other and more formidable sanctions
are to be found in regional pacts and
in the determination of powers to de
fend their own interests."
Peace Inducements
Dr. Temperley believes that there is
still a sentiment of enlightened self
interest which will induce the more
forward-looking powers in Europe not
only to keep the peace among them
selves but to find means by which
other powers will be made to do so.
When questioned about the role of
(he British Empire in matters concern
ing this peace movement and its rela
tion to the League of Nations, he re
marked, "The British Empire? That
will take care of itself! The result of
the present crisis is likely to draw
closer the bonds for mutual protec
tion."
"In my opinion," he continued, "the
British government cannot abandon
the League on which its foreign policy
is based. Great Britain can, must, and
will shape its policy in accordance with
realities".
Conservatives Weak
He further explained that the pres
ent conservative group which now
heads the English government is not
strong enough to run against public
opinion in this particular. Therefore,
since public opinion is so in favor of
maintaining England's place in the
League, the governmet wouldn't find
it easy to abandon the League.
England's l-eaction to the current
question of Turkey and the reopening
of the Dardanelles Straits rather indi
cates her attitude toward the League.
No less than three articles of the
new agreement, as proposed in Eng
land, involve the upholding of the au
thority of the League. It is evident, as
far as England is concerned, that the
League authority must be upheld.
Hence the important step in furthering
this aim is to redefine the League con
stitution.
Dr. Temperley pointed out that eco
nomic sanctions have failed, and that
I hey are not likely to be repeated. But
at the same time, the smaller powers
are dissatisfied with present conditions
and they are asking what is the ad
vantage in protecting its members.
Appeals to England
England is bfeing appealed to by
means of equally urgent demands from
-two equally insistent groups. On one
side are the "Statesmen of the Little
Entente," Benes of Czechoslovakia,
Titulescu of Roumania, and Prince
Paul of Jugoslavia. This group is in
terested in the League primarily as a
means of defending territories acquired
for their countries by peace treaties.
On the other side is Koht, the Nor
way foreign minister who was Dr.
Temperley's predecessor as president
of the International Historical Con
gress. Koht is the leader of the Scan
dinavian countries in demanding ex
planations of the future of the League,
and he is not concerned with terri
torial defense but rather with estimat
ing the obligations of the League and
its power to fulfill them.
With one group coming to England
for protection under the League and
the other asking that the League de
fine and fulfill its obligations, it is evi
dent that England must find some
means to satisfy both groups.
Regarding this matter, Dr. Temper
ley avers that both the Little Entente
and the Scandinavian countries are
friendly to England and that it is quite
clear that the existing British govern
ment will make the utmost efforts to
retain them within the League.
Ilapsburgs Not Accepted
The Scandinavian group ought to be
satised with a redefinition of obliga
tions of the League on more practical
lines. It is however important that
the League has recorded the determi
nation of its members not to accept a
Hapsburg ruler of Austria and Hun
gary. This obligation will be of im
portance whenever Prince Otto makes
a bid for the throne of his ancestors.
The failure of the attempt to protect
Abyssinia makes it difficult to see how
the conservative government can sat
isfy the Little Entente.
He continued by saying that it Is
also possible fhat other League mem
bers such as Greece, Turkey, Persia,
Iraq, and perhaps Egypt, will find their
safetj and advantage in a support of
the League combined with closer re
lations with England. These countries
have an advantage that is hardly en

joyed by the Little Entente—they are | (
all accessible to the sea power of Eng- j
land and they can therefore be pro- |'
tected by it when necessary.
France, Italy Uncertain
"The situation as regards France and '
Italy is naturally uncertain," Dr. Tem- |
perley believes, although he did say ;
that there is no doubt that England's j
recent military conversation with Bel- |
gium and France shows that England I
wouldn't allow either of them to be
subjected to an unprovoked attack
without coming to their assistance.
"The unknown factor in European
politics now is the Baltic and north
east Europe. Germany's relations with '■
Danzig strongly affect the League pol
icy and British interests.
Polish Attitude
"Poland's attitude, formerly friend
ly to Germany, must undergo a change
if an armed attempt is made to over
throw existing conditions at Danzig.
In such a case it must be remembered
that the Soviet Republic is allied to
France and it is believed to possess a
formidable air force.
"Also, the possibility of a Baltic
League in connection with Great Brit
ain for preservation of the status quo
in which Poland, Russia, and Scandi
navia are vitally concerned must not
be lost sight of."
Dr. Temperley, who has been pro
fessor of modern history at Cambridge
since 1932, has also taught at Leeds
University, Harvard, and the Univer
sity of London. He has been president
of the International Historical Con
gress since 1933. Some of his other ac
tivities include his terms as captain
of the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry in
the 1915 Dardanelles expedition; as
sistant and acting attache to Serbia;
adviser at the Paris Peace Conference; j
and British representative on the Al
banian Frontiers Commission.
