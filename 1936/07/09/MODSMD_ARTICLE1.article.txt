# Strong Forces Sponsor Peace, Says Temperley
## Will Discuss "International Situation Today" in Talk To Be Next Tuesday Night 
### Sally Speers 
"Forces working for peace and for
restraint of aggression in Europe are
stronger than they might appear at
first sight," asserted Dr. Harold W. V.
Temperley of Cambridge, acting pro
fessor of history at Stanford. His
speech on "The International Situation
Today" will be given Tuesday in the
Little Theatre at 8 p.m.
Enlarging on this statement, Dr.
Temperley said that perhaps these
forces are strengthened by the fact
that it is now being revealed that eco
nomic sanctions alone are insufficient.
"Other and more formidable sanctions
are to be found in regional pacts and
in the determination of powers to de
fend their own interests."
Peace Inducements
Dr. Temperley believes that there is
still a sentiment of enlightened self
interest which will induce the more
forward-looking powers in Europe not
only to keep the peace among them
selves but to find means by which
other powers will be made to do so.
When questioned about the role of
(he British Empire in matters concern
ing this peace movement and its rela
tion to the League of Nations, he re
marked, "The British Empire? That
will take care of itself! The result of
the present crisis is likely to draw
closer the bonds for mutual protec
tion."
"In my opinion," he continued, "the
British government cannot abandon
the League on which its foreign policy
is based. Great Britain can, must, and
will shape its policy in accordance with
realities".
Conservatives Weak
He further explained that the pres
ent conservative group which now
heads the English government is not
strong enough to run against public
opinion in this particular. Therefore,
since public opinion is so in favor of
maintaining England's place in the
League, the governmet wouldn't find
it easy to abandon the League.
England's l-eaction to the current
question of Turkey and the reopening
of the Dardanelles Straits rather indi
cates her attitude toward the League.
No less than three articles of the
new agreement, as proposed in Eng
land, involve the upholding of the au
thority of the League. It is evident, as
far as England is concerned, that the
League authority must be upheld.
Hence the important step in furthering
this aim is to redefine the League con
stitution.
Dr. Temperley pointed out that eco
nomic sanctions have failed, and that
I hey are not likely to be repeated. But
at the same time, the smaller powers
are dissatisfied with present conditions
and they are asking what is the ad
vantage in protecting its members.
Appeals to England
England is bfeing appealed to by
means of equally urgent demands from
-two equally insistent groups. On one
side are the "Statesmen of the Little
Entente," Benes of Czechoslovakia,
Titulescu of Roumania, and Prince
Paul of Jugoslavia. This group is in
terested in the League primarily as a
