# Economist Will Talk On Silver
## Professor Kenneth Duncan Of Pomona Is Speaker 
### 
"The American Silver Policy" will
be the subject of Professor Kenneth
Duncan's address this evening in the
Women's Clubhouse at 8 o'clock. This
marks the third of a series of Thursday
evening lectures given by visiting pro
fessors.
In discussing the history of our sil
ver policy, Professor Duncan will show
how the whole "sorry history" is one
of "shameless exploitation of the people
of the United States by a small selfish
group."
Professor Duncan has been professor
of economics at Pomona College since
1926. From 1911 to 1926 Mr. Duncan
was on the staff of Lingnan University
in China; and in the summer of 1933,
was a visiting professor at the National
University of Mexico. He is conducting
two courses in economics here: "Con
temporary Economic Problems" and
"Economic Problems of the Orient."
