# "Needs of Religion" Is Sermon Topic
## 
### 
"The Requirements of Religion'' will
be the subject of the sermon to be
given by Dr. D. Elton Truebldod in
the Memorial Church at 11 o'clock
Sunday.
Dr. Trueblood's thesis is that strong
religion is concerned with what God
demands of men, rather than what
their faith will do for them. Much cur
rent religion, he holds, is weak because
men seek personal gain from it.
The musical program will be: Pre
lude, "Lovely" by Williams; anthems,
"Grant Us Thy Peace " by Gounod and
Handel's "Holy Art Thou."
At 7:30 p.m. Sunday, Warren D.
Allen will present an organ recital.
