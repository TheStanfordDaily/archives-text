I amounting to 587.000. An editorial
j campaign carried on by Chaparral 1
i raised $2,000.
Following the most advanced de- |
! sign, the main auditorium of the new
I theater will be equipped so that the
' seat capacity may be. changed. This
J is accomplished by means of a rein
forced curtain extending the width of !
1 the auditorium. By dropping the cur- I
lain to the balcony rail, the house ca- !
pacity i.s changed from 15000 to 800. '
Further contraction of the house size j
may be made by dropping the curtain j
| so that the rear .100 seats may be cut '
| off. At this size—soo—the auditorium
will have the capacity of a standard j
Broadway legitimate theater.
New Type Seats
Other features of the auditorium I
construction include removable side J
seats, which can be used for lectures, j
and upholstered opera chairs spaced at 1
decent intervals to provide actual com- i
fort.
Stage lighting facilities will follow :
the design initiated by the Radio City j
Music Hall in New York. Lighting |

i effects will be controlled from a mas
! ter console, similar to that on an organ.
This control console will permit the
; operator to regulate every light in the
house. Dials, knobs, and plugs will
| allow the electrician literally to play
his effects.
Wings with a 22-foot depth provide
sufficient space for smooth shifting of
I scenes and sets by the use of "wagons"
! for moving of the sets.
Movie Equipment
Completed plans provide fnr the in
l stallation of motion picture equipment
i wired for sound in both the main audi-
I torium and the little theater in the
| west wing.
The stage will have a width adjust-
I able to 40 feet. The stage tower will
i be 65 feet high, providing for full
j height .10-foot drops.
The new Stanford theater will in-
I corporate in its earthquake-proof con-
I struction all the tried innovations and
i design of modern theaterdom. It will
I be equally adaptable to a revue or
drama, lecture or cinema. And being
primarily a legitimate theater, it will
j be one of the lew modern ones in ex
j istence.
