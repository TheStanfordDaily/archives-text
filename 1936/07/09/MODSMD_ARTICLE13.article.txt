I amounting to 587.000. An editorial
j campaign carried on by Chaparral 1
i raised $2,000.
Following the most advanced de- |
! sign, the main auditorium of the new
I theater will be equipped so that the
' seat capacity may be. changed. This
J is accomplished by means of a rein
forced curtain extending the width of !
1 the auditorium. By dropping the cur- I
lain to the balcony rail, the house ca- !
pacity i.s changed from 15000 to 800. '
Further contraction of the house size j
may be made by dropping the curtain j
| so that the rear .100 seats may be cut '
| off. At this size—soo—the auditorium
will have the capacity of a standard j
Broadway legitimate theater.
New Type Seats
Other features of the auditorium I
construction include removable side J
seats, which can be used for lectures, j
and upholstered opera chairs spaced at 1
decent intervals to provide actual com- i
fort.
Stage lighting facilities will follow :
the design initiated by the Radio City j
Music Hall in New York. Lighting |

i effects will be controlled from a mas
ter console, similar to that on an organ.
This control console will permit the
operator to regulate every light in the
house. Dials, knobs, and plugs will
allow the electrician literally to play
his effects.
Wings with a 22-foot depth provide
sufficient space for smooth shifting of
scenes and sets by the use of "wagons"
for moving of the sets.
Movie Equipment
Completed plans provide fnr the in
stallation of motion picture equipment
wired for sound in both the main audi-
torium and the little theater in the
west wing.
The stage will have a width adjust-
able to 40 feet. The stage tower will
be 65 feet high, providing for full
height 30-foot drops.
The new Stanford theater will in-
corporate in its earthquake-proof con-
struction all the tried innovations and
design of modern theaterdom. It will
be equally adaptable to a revue or
drama, lecture or cinema. And being
primarily a legitimate theater, it will
j be one of the lew modern ones in ex
istence.
