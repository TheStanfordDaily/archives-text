# Teachers Urged To Organize For Bargaining
## Need for Adult Education In Democracy Is Shown By Federal Commissioner 
### 
"I believe in the right of teachers to
bargain collectively," declared John
W. Studebaker, United States Com
missioner of Education, in his first gen
eral session speech before the Stanford
Conference on Curriculum and Guid
ance Tuesday night.
Urging teachers to organize in the
National Education Association, the
federal official proceeded to outline
sume of the work which the organ
ized teachers were doing in forwarding
the objectives of American public edu
cation.
The curriculum, he believes, should
be extended and made attractive not
only for children but also for adults.
"Tens of millions will have opinions
about public affairs, in any event. Un
der our system of government they
have a right to register those opinions
in. determining public policies," said
Mr. Studebaker.
Adults Participate
"Since they, as adults, are actually
participating in government, they have
a stronger motive in learning about
government than youngsters have. We
provide systematic education for youth
—that is, for those not permitted to
participate in government—while mak
ing no provision for those actually
participating." Commissioner Stude
baker continued, "In effect, we say to
children, 'We are very much concerned
that you know how to vote,' when they
cannot vote. When people come to the
age of voting, we leave education in
form of catch-as-catch-can exercises,
where people pick up a little under
standing on the run."
Mr. Studebaker declared, "Running a
democracy is an adult enterprise. We
need the strongest possible foundation
in systematic education in childhood
and adolescence. But we build a good
foundation only in order to have a good
superstructure. Just as we have mod
ernized automobiles, streamlined trains,
we should streamline education."
"Our most pressing present need,"
he added, is to develop throughout
the nation a practicable, competently
managed system of public discussion
under the auspices of public education.
Public forums constitute an important
defense of American democracy."
He pointed out that of the 76 million
adults in the nation, 04 million have
not finished high school and 32 million
have not finished the eighth grade.
"In many modern meetings the au -
dience is not permitted to question the
speaker," said Mr. Studebaker. "Radio
speakers with an audience of forty
millions cannot be 'talked back to'."
The Commissioner concluded, "The
system of education up to date in the
bnited States has reasonably well
served its purpose. But all of it, to
gether with American genius, has now
developed a social capacity which has
outrun the improvements of public
education. Therefore, just as we have
struggled all these years to create a
system of education equal to current,
needs, we must now apply some of our
American genius to American educa
tion itself, and extend its facilities to
the masses beyond the age of 16, 18,
and over. These facilities should be
continued throughout adult life espe
cially for the purpose of enabling vot
ing citizens to understand their com
mon problems."
