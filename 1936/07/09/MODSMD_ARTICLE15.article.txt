# Stanford May Plan Athletic Insurance Fund
## 
### Tro Harper 
When Frankie Alustiza got kicked
in the head during the U.C.L.A. foot
ball game last fall and nearly went
blind, a lot of people got worried and
began to wonder just what or who
would take care of an athlete in event
of a permanent injury suffered while
upholding the name of his alma ma
ter. What would become of a boy
who lost both eyes or perhaps his life?
Accidents occur every day, while tak
ing a bath, while sleeping, while cross
ing the street, accidents that are fatal,
or what is probably worse, incur the
loss of limbs and senses. As long as
football is played, accidents will hap
pen, no matter how careful or delicate
the game might become.
Stanford Hires Physicians
At the present Stanford has one of
the finest health departments in the
country and whenever an athlete is
badly hurt the university hires the
best physician in the field, but as yet
there is no provision for care, or help,
once medical science has reached the
unfortunate end of its usefulness. Such
care no doubt prevents a great many
injuries, but it was only a great amount
of luck, excellent attention, and mod
ern methods of science that kept Alus
tiza from living the rest of his life in
darkness. Permanent injury did not
materialize but it might have, and that
is what the University of California
will attempt to guard against when
the footballers step onto the playing
field at Berkeley next fall.
Plan Suggested
A plan of insurance for all men en
gaged in intercollegiate competition,
the first plan of its sort anywhere in
America, has been laid before Ken
Priestley by Bill Monohan, retiring
graduate manager, a plan on which
Monohan has been working for nearly
six months. As a protection for ath
letes, the plan is one of the most re
markable forward steps in the history
of intercollegiate competition. Cali
fornia's plan follows:
(1) That not less than $2000 be set
aside each year for the athletes' in
surance trust fund.
(2) That the process be continued
until a fixed sum, say $20,000. is in
reserve.

(3) That a "control board" consisting
of the head of the medical school, the
team physician, the university faculty
representative to the Coast conference,
and the graduate manager be named
to administer the fund.
(4) That the board shall be empower
to take whatever measures seem ap
propriate, within broad standard limi
tations, to care for men who may be
injured and not completely rehabili
tated through the already comprehen
sive schedule of competent medical
care.
For quite some time now the au
thorities at Stanford have been trying
to see just what could be done in re
gard to such a plan.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters has
been considering this problem but as
yet he has made no intensive study of
the details.
Said Masters just before he departed
yesterday for New York and the Olym
pic Games where he will act as assist
ant manager of the American track
team:
"Bill Monohan started it first. He
agreed, when he had gathered all data,
to allow us the benefit of it. Since he
made the original 'move, I determined
to wait until he had reached his con
clusions before starting to study at
Stanford."
According to Masters, Stanford is
actively interested in this movement to
promote an insurance fund and he has
listened to many different proposals,
but as yet none has been found that is
satisfactory.

When Frankie Alustiza got kicked

ball game last fall and nearly went

began to wonder just what or who
would take care of an athlete in event
of a permanent injury suffered while

Accidents occur every day, while tak

Stanford Hires Physicians
At the present Stanford has one of
the finest health departments in the
country and whenever an athlete is
badly hurt the university hires the
best physician in the field, but as yet
there is no provision for care, or help,
once medical science has reached the
unfortunate end of its usefulness. Such
care no doubt prevents a great many
injuries, but it was only a great amount
of luck, excellent attention, and mod
ern methods of science that kept Alus
tiza from living the rest of his life in
darkness. Permanent injury did not
materialize but it might have, and that
is what the University of California
will attempt to guard against when
the footballers step onto the playing
field at Berkeley next fall.
Plan Suggested
A plan of insurance for all men en
gaged in intercollegiate competition,
the first plan of its sort anywhere in
America, has been laid before Ken
Priestley by Bill Monohan, retiring
graduate manager, a plan on which
Monohan has been working for nearly
six months. As a protection for ath
letes, the plan is one of the most re
markable forward steps in the history
of intercollegiate competition. Cali
fornia's plan follows:
(1) That not less than $2000 be set
aside each year for the athletes' in
surance trust fund.
(2) That the process be continued
until a fixed sum, say $20,000. is in
reserve.

(3) That a "control board" consisting
of the head of the medical school, the
team physician, the university faculty
representative to the Coast conference,
and the graduate manager be named
to administer the fund.
(4) That the board shall be empower
to take whatever measures seem ap
propriate, within broad standard limi
tations, to care for men who may be
injured and not completely rehabili
tated through the already comprehen
sive schedule of competent medical
care.
For quite some time now the au
thorities at Stanford have been trying
to see just what could be done in re
gard to such a plan.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters has
been considering this problem but as
yet he has made no intensive study of
the details.
Said Masters just before he departed
yesterday for New York and the Olym
pic Games where he will act as assist
ant manager of the American track
team:
"Bill Monohan started it first. He
agreed, when he had gathered all data,
to allow us the benefit of it. Since he
made the original 'move, I determined
to wait until he had reached his con
clusions before starting to study at
Stanford."
According to Masters, Stanford is
actively interested in this movement to
promote an insurance fund and he has
listened to many different proposals,
but as yet none has been found that is
satisfactory.
