# Varied Subjects Discussed By Forum Teachers
## Six Groups Hear Experts Talk on Social Problems Facing Public at Present 
### 
An important phase of the Educa
tional Conference now in session has
been the Tuesday and Wednesday fo
rums conducted by leaders in several
subjects.
On Tuesday F. G. Macomber led a
forum on "Developing Scope and Se
quence of the Core Curriculum." Ma
comber stated that it is the function
of the school to provide an environ
ment which will develop a continuous
improvement of the social structure
and rich, many-sided personalities.
"The objectives," said Macomber,
"should be stated in terms of child
development, such as understandings,
attitudes, appreciations, and special
abilities."
He stated further that in the core
of the curriculum the whole school
life of the child must be considered.
Federal Aid to Local Control
The attitude taken by English uni
versities toward two questions much
discussed in America was explained in
another Tuesday forum by Harold
W. V. Temperley. Federal, or rather
government, aid has been successfully
combined with local control, and it is
significant to note that the "strings"
attached to the aid are conditions
which tend to further equality of op
portunity in education.
"In all cases," said Mr. Temperly,
"state aid is given on condition that
there be no distinction of sex, race, or
creed, and that poor students be of
fered opportunities to obtain their edu
cation practically free of charge."
Wednesday Forums
"Implications of Psychology for the
Curriculum: The Objective and Mech
anistic Psychologist" was the topic of
discussion by Peter Sandiford in the
Wednesday forum.
The forum emphasized that the se
lection of the curriculum is the work of
the educational philosopher and not,
strictly speaking, that of the educa
tional psychologist.
"Tell me where you want to go and
I will show you the best and shortest
way there," is the attitude of the psy
chologist.
Philosophy of Experimentalisni
In a forum on "The Curricular Sig
nificance of a Philosophy of Experi
mentalism" Percy E. Davidson dis
cussed five significant points in the
philosophy of experimentalism.
Davidson attempted to clarify the
confusion as to what is "progressive"
in education and pointed out the diffi
culty in making philosophical ideas
practical. * if
He stated that the central idea is
growth and readjustment of experi
ence. Diagnosis comes first and then
tentative planned programs.
Foundations of the Arts
In the forum on "Social Foundations
of the Arts" Edward M. Farmer was
the speaker.
"The great artist has always ex-
pressed concepts which he has gained
in his living experience and which
serve to instruct, inspire, or at least
broaden the outlook of his audience," I
was brought out in the discussion. The j
great artist solves structural or func- 1
tional problems in terms of his en- .
vironment. The education of the indi
vidual is not complete without art ex- i
perience and this necessitates creative j
ability.
Foundations of Music
"Social Foundations of Music" was
the topic of Warren D. Allen, head of
the music department of Stanford, |
when he spoke to the education group
of the music division.
In Mr. Allen's opinion, music should
be co-ordinated with all educational \
projects rather than being set as a
thing apart.
The influences that music has had on
the various periods of history were
pointed to as examples to show the j
direct influence that music may have j
in the present day; therefore it should
be stressed in education.
"Music should be an art for the sake i
of man," stated Mr. Allen." Why, then,
restrict music to certain individuals, j
to certain groups, or even to certain
types? Who can differentiate be
tween good and bad in music?"

the top of his class this week. His
father is going to take him to the zoo.

Willie to college.—Texas Longhorn
