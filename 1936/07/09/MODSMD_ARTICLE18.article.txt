# Varied Subjects Discussed By Forum Teachers
## Six Groups Hear Experts Talk on Social Problems Facing Public at Present 
### 
An important phase of the Educa
tional Conference now in session has
been the Tuesday and Wednesday fo
rums conducted by leaders in several
subjects.
On Tuesday F. G. Macomber led a
forum on "Developing Scope and Se
quence of the Core Curriculum." Ma
comber stated that it is the function
of the school to provide an environ
ment which will develop a continuous
improvement of the social structure
and rich, many-sided personalities.
"The objectives," said Macomber,
"should be stated in terms of child
development, such as understandings,
attitudes, appreciations, and special
abilities."
He stated further that in the core
of the curriculum the whole school
life of the child must be considered.

"state aid is given on condition that
there be no distinction of sex, race, or
creed, and that poor students be of
fered opportunities to obtain their edu

Wednesday Forums
"Implications of Psychology for the
Curriculum: The Objective and Mech

discussion by Peter Sandiford in the
Wednesday forum.
The forum emphasized that the se
lection of the curriculum is the work of
the educational philosopher and not,
strictly speaking, that of the educa
tional psychologist.
"Tell me where you want to go and
I will show you the best and shortest
way there," is the attitude of the psy
chologist.
Philosophy of Experimentalisni
In a forum on "The Curricular Sig
nificance of a Philosophy of Experi
mentalism" Percy E. Davidson dis
cussed five significant points in the
philosophy of experimentalism.
Davidson attempted to clarify the
confusion as to what is "progressive"
in education and pointed out the diffi
culty in making philosophical ideas
practical. * if
He stated that the central idea is
growth and readjustment of experi
ence. Diagnosis comes first and then
tentative planned programs.
Foundations of the Arts
In the forum on "Social Foundations
of the Arts" Edward M. Farmer was
the speaker.
