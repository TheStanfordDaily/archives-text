# Sokol Lectures On Balinese Life, Costums
## 
### 
Recordings of Balinese music pro
vided the atmosphere for the illus
trated lecturp on "The Island of Bali"
which was Riven by Professor Anthony
E. Sokol of the Germanic Languages
department Tuesday evening in the
Little Theater. Natural color slides,
many of them from his own photo
graphs made in the Dutch East Indies, !
were used to supplement Dr. Sokol's |
talk.
The island, its people, their customs, I
and its civilization were explained, and
many curious examples of their be
liefs were given. One of these, a reli- !
gious custom, was the practice of "sut- I
tee." This barbaric method of burial, ,
which existed until 1900, provided that
the widow of the deceased must throw j
herself on the funeral pyre of her
husband.
Many of the slides illustrated the
crafts and arts of the Balinese people, j
their architecture as displayed in their
temples, and their numerous customs. 1
