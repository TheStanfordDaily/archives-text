# Six Dollars To View Campus
## 
### 
Early Tuesday," two elderly
gentlemen came upon a crowd of
people formed in line outside the
Administration building. Per
haps it was the psychological ef
fect, but at any rate they joined
the line.
After about a half hour of shift
ing from one foot to the other,
they arrived at the window.
"Six dollars, please," said the
girl behind the desk.
The gentlemen looked at one
another, and dug into their pock
ets. The girl handed them two
stubs, they signed their names,
and walked away rather bewil
dered.
After touring the campus, they
returned to the Administration
building.
"The chapel was beautiful, and
it is a nice campus, but I hardly
think the tour was worth six
dollars," said one.
"We must have missed some
thing, as they have not collected
our stubs yet," said the other.
Seeing the "Information" sign
over one of the windows in the
lobby, they decided to inquire.
"Those tickets are for the Con
ference on Curriculum and Guid
ance," the girl answered.
