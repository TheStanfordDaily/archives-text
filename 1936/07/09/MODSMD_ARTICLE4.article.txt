# Dr. Noller Will Speak On Radio
## "Chemistry Today" Is Topic Of Talk Slated Monday 
### 
"Chemistry is rapidly becoming an
asset to the farmers through its re
search which develops new outlets for
farm products," Dr. Carl R. Noller,
associate professor of Chemistry at
Stanford, stated in an advance of his
radio speech on "Chemistry Today"
which will be heard over Station KGO
Monday evening at 7:15.
In connection with this same scheme
of applied chemistry, Dr. Noller be
lieves that the farmer cannot depend
entirely on the industrial chemist to
help him, but that the farmer should
have his own research organization to
develop new products from the raw
materials that he produces.
Research Not Magician
Dr. Noller doesn't claim that the in
dustrial research chemist is a magi
cian of any kind. He says rather, "Ap
plied chemistry is based largely on the
results of fundamental research which
has been conducted in the laboratories
of the universities."
Since the industrial chemist inter
ests himself in practical efforts ex
clusively, Dr. Noller will point out the
need for the university investigator "to
explore the by-ways and extend our
knowledge of all phases of the science."
Taught at Northwestern
Dr. Noller has done research work
both in Europe and for the Eastman
Kodak Company in Rochester. He re
ceived his Ph.D. at the University of
Illinois, and before coming to Stanford
in 1929 he taught at Northwestern
University.
