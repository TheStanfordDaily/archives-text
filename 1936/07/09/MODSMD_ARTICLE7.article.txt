# Dr. Bell Attacks Older Methods Of Teaching
## Trained Counselor Having Insight into Psychology Is Most Pressing Need 
### 
"Drill, departmentalized teaching,
extrinsic devices of motivation, cur
riculum regimentation, all are under
fire," declared Professor Reginald Bell
last night before the Curriculum and
Guidance Conference.
In the same way the current prac
tices of guidance workers are under
fire. "Bad use of mental hygiene con
cepts, dependence upon rule of thumb
techniques, narrow interpretation of
the guidance task," Professor Bell listed
in illustrating the naivete with which
objective psychological measures are
being rejected.
"A better trained counselor is need
ed, with insight into psychology and
psychiatric techniques on the one hand
and the ability to help students define
and to develop worth-while integrat
ing purposes and goals on the other,"
Professor Bell stated.
Psychologists Use Data
"This means that psychologists are
bringing their data to bear on educa
tional objectives as well as educational
methods and processes. They are con
cerned with the kinds of experiences
which make up the curriculum. The
clinical psychologists, out of their study
of maladjusted behavior-problem chil
dren, are particularly insistent on this.
For they see clearly that adjustment
is a two-way matter, not solely the
adjustment of the individual to his
environment and group but often the
adjustment of intolerable social situ
ations to the individual," said Professor
Bell.
"There ai'e certain developments in
psychology which are of immediate |
importance to school people. The first
is that psychology—general psychology
—has shifted its emphasis from the
study solely of mental life, or of spe
cific behavior, to the study of human
personality—the total quality or pat
tern of an individual's behavior," as
serted Dr. Bell.
"This means that psychologists are
bringing their data to bear on educa
tional objectives as well as educational
methods and processes. They are con
cerned with the kinds of experiences
which make up the curriculum. The
clinical psychologists, out of their
study of maladjusted behavior-prob
lem children, are particularly insistent
on this. For they see clearly that ad
justment is a two-way matter—not
solely the adjustment of the individual
to his environment and group, but
often the adjustment of intolerable so
cial situations to the individual," de- |

clared Dr. Bell.
Society Should Be Studied
"The first curriculum emphasis grow
ing out of this kind of thinking is upon
the necessity of leading children to
understand their relation to society.
This means at all levels of the school
inclusion of soeial experiences that
will result in understanding sell' and
society, and the relationship of the
two. The 'social frontier' thinker deals
with the same problem in immediate
socio-economic terms. He asks: How
can the individual be other than mal
adjusted to a society which is run
by static social, political, and economic
conceptions? Society is not a static sys
tem; it is not in unchanging equilib
rium. It is rather a fluid energy sys
tem subject to the laws of dynamics,
constantly in process of adjustment
and change. Cannot this change be
controlled in the interests of the indi
viduals who make up the system?"
