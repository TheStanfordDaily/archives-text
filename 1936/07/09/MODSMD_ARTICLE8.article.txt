# Schubert Cycle Continued By Belgian Quartet
## 
### 
The Pro Arte Quartet has probably
more closely correlated the music of
the old with the music of the new
than any other group of its type, ac
cording to various musical critics.
This quartet is to play the third in
the Schubert cycle series, Friday at
3 p.m. in the dance studio of the
Women's Gym.
The beginnings of this group of
players as a quartet were not without
difficulty. At first it was dependent on
scattered patrons and small groups,
but undaunted it refused to sacrifice
principles in favor of an easy popular
success. Performing in the early days
of Stravinsky, Ravel, Honneger, and
Milhaud, ihe quartet has continued to
give distinguished renditions of th'ese
men's music.
This international scope is the quar
tet's contribution to music. The Pro
Arte Quartet is a worthy inheritor of
the artistic tradition of the Flemish
school which sent out men to all cen
ters of Europe, there to fertilize and
transform music—to carry it through
to the modern age.
The public is invited to attend the
Friday concert through the courtesy
of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.
