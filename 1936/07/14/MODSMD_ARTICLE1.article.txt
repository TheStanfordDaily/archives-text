# History and Drama To Be Fenton Theme
## Technique of Historical Play Writing Will Be Topic of Tudor Talk Wednesday 
### 
How does the dramatist write a his
torical play? How may the facts and
fables of history be pointed toward
the end of comedy or tragedy?
These are two of the questions
which will be discussed tomorrow eve
ning in a lecture by Mr. Frank Fen
ton, of San Francisco State College, on
"History as Dramatic Plot Material."
The lecture will be in the Women's
Clubhouse at 8 o'clock.
Summer's Motif
Those to whom this summer's Stage
Classics Production activity at Stan
ford is a second season will be espe
cially pleased by the announcement of
Mr. Fenton's return this summer.
The lecture of Mr. Fenton is particu
larly appropriate to the summer's mo
tifâ€”"the treatment of historical fig
ures and classic themes in drama." This
ties in with the Sword and Sandals
readings. The second of these, Stephen
Phillips' "Herod," takes place at the
Assembly Hall at 8 o'clock Monday
evening, July 20. Both this play and
the one which preceded it, "The Tro
jan Women" of Euripides, illustrate
the use of legendary history as sources
of vivid emotion and commanding
characters.
Play Readings
The last Sword and Sandals reading
will round out the sequence on August
3 with a lively comedy on the life of
Samuel Pepys, "And So to Bed" by
J. B. Fagan.
Mr. Fenton's "History as Dramatic
Plot Material" lecture is particularly
pointed at Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra" and Shaw's "Caesar and
Cleopatra," to be produced at Stan
ford in mid-August. The lecture will
provide a helpful continuity to the
whole of the summer's dramatic ac
tivity on the campus.
