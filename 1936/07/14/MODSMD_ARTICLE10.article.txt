# Puppets Will Enact Drama
## Shakespeare Play Will Be Presented Here Friday 
### 
A new medium for Shakespeare will
be introduced on the campus next Fri
day evening at 8 o'clock when John
Carter Ford's puppets enact the "Com
edy of Errors." The Dance Studio of
the Women's Gym will serve as the
theater to which the public is cor
dially invited.
The puppets are guignol, or hand
puppets; those articulated on the hands
of the operator and his assistants—
not worked by strings. Hand puppets
have a vitality and rapidity of action
that makes their comedy particularly
hilarious. They are a foot and a half
high and will play on a stage with a
proscenium opening six feet wide. The
ladies wear the striking costumes of
the late Elizabethan period, and the
gentlemen of the puppet company are
gay in trunks and doublets. All the
leading characters have been created
by Mr. Ford especially for this produc
tion.
Mr. Ford began his hobby of puppet
playing over 10 years ago as a field
for experimentation in stagecraft.
Later, he and Mrs. Ford incorporated
this hobby into their educational ac
tivities with children. However, Fri
day's Shakespearean comedy, of course,
is planned for adults as well as chil
dren.
Although some critics have said that
the characters in the "Comedy of Er
rors" are without definite personalities,
Mr. Ford, in following the words that
Shakespeare gave his people, has de
veloped a cast of 16 puppets with all
the foibles necessary for complete
farce.
