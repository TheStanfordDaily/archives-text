| "A new definition of democracy has
I evolved in the field of ihe American
I political scene," Professor Finla GofT
] Crawford of New York, now acting
! professor of political science here and
author of "State Government," de
clares. The change has resulted from
the vast centralization of administra
tion which has been accomplished in
the United States during the last 25
' years.
This definition consists of the fol
j lowing points due to the progress of
! science in industry, communication,
and transportation with its effect on
i government:
"Introduction of the technician, the
specialist in government. In health,
education, and emergency phases of
! administration we've adopted him.
"When we get in the field of admin
istration we are only beginning to
! recognize that administration is a
science and not an art and that we can
develop in this country a group of men
■ and women who are technicians in
government."
' Breakdown of provincialism is cited

by Professor Crawford as the second |
feature which is aiding centralization. !
"The automobile is helping to show '
(hat people in one part of the country
are pretty much the same as in an
| other." This in face of the fact that to |
be a native son of a state makes you
| better political material.
Out of which the third point in the
definition emerges—namely separation
1 of administration from politics. An
examination of what has happened in |
England. Canada, and even Germany
shows this to be possible.
Fourthly, development of the demo
cratic spirit iti administration, "seeing
the other fellow's point of view, and I
the conference method in solution of
problems," has come about,
v A question confronts the governed
who have readily enough accepted the
I above points:
"How far should the administrative
' officer go in the determination of pol
icy?" His is a function of fact-finding
i and he must take it with good grace if j
' the policy-forming officer does not ac
, cept his suggestions in whole,
I Finally there has been the gradual j

acceptance that the coercive powers
of administration have a purpose.
Those things which seem to limit in
dividual liberty, it is being realized, are
in the end for the welfare of the indi
vidual.
Consequently it follows that a re
vamping of the personnel of the admin
istration must be made to meet the
new situations. Says Professor Craw
ford, "The Federal Civil Service is
just at the beginning of a very im
portant development with the estab
lishment of the '"Institute of Public
Administration" at Washington, D.C.,
which is providing training schools for
the special purpose of recruiting col
lege men and women to the service
of the government." Mainly the idea
is to find governmental fields in which
college men and women may serve as
internes and so make themselves in
dispensable leading eventually to per
manent positions.
Dr. Crawford is a notable authority
in the field of public administration.
He is a professor in the School of Citi
zenship jind Public Affairs at Syracuse
University.
