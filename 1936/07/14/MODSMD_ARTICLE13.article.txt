looking powers in Europe is induced
by the prevailing sentiment of en
lightened self-interest, Dr. Temperley
believes. These same peoples would
also find means by which other pow
ers will be made to keep peace, ac
cording to the Cambridge professor.
"Great Britain can, must, and will
shape its policy in accordance with
realities," is his opinion. "The British
government cannot abandon the
League, on which its foreign policy is
based."
Dr. Temperley explained that since
the conservative group which now
heads the English government is not
strong enough to run against public
opinion, it wouldn't be easy for the
government to abandon the League.
The Baltic and northeast Europe is
the unknown factor in European poli
tics at the present. "Germany's rela
tions with Danzig strongly affect the
League policy and British interests."
Dr. Temperley also named France and
Italy as uncertain factors in the inter
national situation."

modern history at Cambridge since
1932, and he has also taught at Leeds
University, Harvard, and the Uni
