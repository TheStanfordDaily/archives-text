# Pro Arte Group Performs In Schubert Cycle
## Songs from "Winterreise" Are Sung by Lawrence Strauss as Tenor Soloist 
### Gen Wing 
Justly deserved was the hearty re
sponse given the Pro Arte Quartet last
Friday afternoon when they made their
initial performance of the Schubert
cycle being presented during the sum
mer session.
The last of Schubert's quartets, the
Quartet in G Major, Opus 161, opened
the program. Revealing a new Schu
bert, this quartet differs greatly from
his former works in the noticeable lack
of any leading idea—of any song which
might bring unity to the movements.
Typical of the former works, however,
is the domination of the major and
minor mode alternating in the first
movement and the finale. The Scherzo
blends itself into the playful rondo of
the finale. Written in ten days, this
romantic quartet has placed Schubert,
as Cobbett says, "on a solitary pedes
tal." The superb playing of this work
as it was given Friday was to the au
dience, as much as to Schubert, a
powerful flight of the imagination.
Music from Verse
Effective, well-interpreted, and in
teresting was the presentation by Law
rence Strauss of the songs from the
"Winterreise" Cycle, Opus 89. It is
obvious, however, that the music is far
superior to the verses.
The "Winter Journey," like Schu
bert's first song cycle, was inspired by
a poem cycle written by Wilhelm Mul
ler. This "journey" describes, in 24
songs, a pilgrimage taken by the hero
in an effort to forget unrequited love.
Nature, in its wintry aspects, is inter
preted in terms of human emotion.
Early Composition Finale
The E Flat Quartet which closed the
program was written by Schubert at
the age of 16 years. Although nine ex
perimental quartets had preceded this,
the E Flat was the first to gain clarity
in sonata form. This quartet lacks
none of the warmth or color so be
loved and so typical of the tempera
ment of Schubert.
Friday afternoon the quartet will
play the last of the Schubert cycle.

Early Composition Finale
The E Flat Quartet which closed the
program was written by Schubert at
the age of 16 years. Although nine ex
perimental quartets had preceded this,
the E Flat was the first to gain clarity
in sonata form. This quartet lacks
none of the warmth or color so be
loved and so typical of the tempera
ment of Schubert.
Friday afternoon the quartet will
play the last of the Schubert cycle.

mer of 1934.
Justly deserved was the hearty re
sponse given the Pro Arte Quartet last
Friday afternoon when they made their
initial performance of the Schubert
cycle being presented during the sum
mer session.
The last of Schubert's quartets, the
Quartet in G Major, Opus 161, opened
the program. Revealing a new Schu
bert, this quartet differs greatly from
his former works in the noticeable lack
of any leading idea—of any song which
might bring unity to the movements.
Typical of the former works, however,
is the domination of the major and
minor mode alternating in the first
movement and the finale. The Scherzo
blends itself into the playful rondo of
the finale. Written in ten days, this
romantic quartet has placed Schubert,
as Cobbett says, "on a solitary pedes
tal." The superb playing of this work
as it was given Friday was to the au
dience, as much as to Schubert, a
powerful flight of the imagination.
Music from Verse
Effective, well-interpreted, and in
teresting was the presentation by Law
rence Strauss of the songs from the
"Winterreise" Cycle, Opus 89. It is
obvious, however, that the music is far
superior to the verses.
The "Winter Journey," like Schu
bert's first song cycle, was inspired by
a poem cycle written by Wilhelm Mul
ler. This "journey" describes, in 24
songs, a pilgrimage taken by the hero
in an effort to forget unrequited love.
