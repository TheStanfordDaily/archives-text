# An Excursion To London
## 
### 
For an excursion into two Londons 1
—the one that claimed Shakespeare '
and the other that growled at Shaw— ]
one need go no farther than the Stan- j
ford Library.
There, on the library mezzanine, lies
the evidence—folios, pictures, maps,
and books, telling the story of two
Englands.
In the cases there are pictures and
books describing the life of the Eliza
bethan day—the games, the music, the
theater, the architecture. A copy of
the first folio edition of the collected
works of Shakespeare is on display.
Ben Jonson pens his tribute in verse
on the title page, opposite a drawing
of W.S.
Ben Jonson has another verse, part
of which reads,
"You are a friend then, as I make it out
Of our man Shakespeare, who alone
of us
Will put an ass's head in fairyland."
From the richness and the beauty of
the Elizabethan age, we go round a
library corner afid come in view of
the London that first saw Shaw. In
this late Victorian age, the theater
was mostly concerned with Shake
speare, which, as one of the display
cards notes, probably influenced
Shaw's disdain for the gentleman from
Stratford-on-Avon.

| But the men who surrounded Shaw!
' There was J. M. Barrie extracting all
j the whimsy of which nineteenth cen
j tury audiences were cupable. Gilbert
J and Sullivan were writing their saucy
] songs.
The actors of the time included
Henry Irving, Richard Mansfield, E. H.
| Sothern, Lillian Russell, and Edna
May.
But go over and see the exhibit
yourself—see the collection which the
j Course in Stage Classics has assem
j bled in connection with the summer's
J activities culminating in the produc
! tion of Shakespeare's "Antony and
| Cleopatra" and Shaw's "Caesar and
j Cleopatra."
i And, by the way, you will see the
j book containing the correspondence of
G.B.S. with Ellen Terry. The page at
I which the book is opened and three
! accompanying clippings from "The
l Nation" seem to suggest that Shaw was
the lover—far from blind—and Ellen
Terry was the actress who found it
convenient to entertain the affections
I of a critic. She was in love with Henry
j Irving, the great actor of the ghastly
nineteenth century melodrama. Shaw
I knew this and he tossed the Fabian
| arrow of wit at Irving in his reviews.
Poor Irving was leveled more than
j once.

j book containing the correspondence of
G.B.S. with Ellen Terry. The page at
I which the book is opened and three
! accompanying clippings from "The
l Nation" seem to suggest that Shaw was
the lover—far from blind—and Ellen
Terry was the actress who found it
convenient to entertain the affections
I of a critic. She was in love with Henry
j Irving, the great actor of the ghastly
nineteenth century melodrama. Shaw
I knew this and he tossed the Fabian

For an excursion into two Londons 1
—the one that claimed Shakespeare '
and the other that growled at Shaw— ]
one need go no farther than the Stan- j
ford Library.
There, on the library mezzanine, lies
the evidence—folios, pictures, maps,
and books, telling the story of two
Englands.
In the cases there are pictures and
books describing the life of the Eliza
bethan day—the games, the music, the
theater, the architecture. A copy of
the first folio edition of the collected
works of Shakespeare is on display.
Ben Jonson pens his tribute in verse
on the title page, opposite a drawing
of W.S.
Ben Jonson has another verse, part
of which reads,
"You are a friend then, as I make it out
Of our man Shakespeare, who alone
of us
Will put an ass's head in fairyland."
From the richness and the beauty of
the Elizabethan age, we go round a
library corner afid come in view of
the London that first saw Shaw. In
this late Victorian age, the theater
was mostly concerned with Shake
speare, which, as one of the display
cards notes, probably influenced
Shaw's disdain for the gentleman from
Stratford-on-Avon.

| But the men who surrounded Shaw!
' There was J. M. Barrie extracting all
j the whimsy of which nineteenth cen
j tury audiences were cupable. Gilbert
J and Sullivan were writing their saucy
] songs.
The actors of the time included
Henry Irving, Richard Mansfield, E. H.
| Sothern, Lillian Russell, and Edna
May.

yourself—see the collection which the
