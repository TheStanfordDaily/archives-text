"Students who had never before
realized they had such skill are de
signing many of the costumes to be
used in 'Antony and Cleopatra' and
'Caesar and Cleopatra'," said Miss
Helen Green, director of costume de
sign for the mid-August productions.
"The general motif is in associating
color with character as well as mood,"
continued Miss Green. "For instance,
the character of the chief nurse to
Cleopatra is rather grim, almost mur
derous. Her raiment is to be brown
and gray with no other coloring, thus
completely distinguishing her from
the brilliant attire of Cleopatra and the
courtiers.
Armor Construction
"All the armor is made of cardboard.
It is fitted to the actor, and then cov
ered with muslin which is painted,
gilded, or silvered according to the
character.
"Made of linoleum, the sandals
match the cape or mantle of the actor.
A scarlet cape, designed by Robert
Quinsey, is to be used in one scene.
The colors in the cape merge well with
the dress for Cleopatra in the same
scene."

Visitors Invited
Vivian Hair, who was art director
of the San Bernardino Federal The
ater, has designed several interesting
costumes for both courtiers and slaves.
Old Roble Gym is being used as a
workshop and Miss Green invites
anyone interested to visit. Most of the
designs are on display and costumes'
being constructed from these drawings
are in all stages.
"Students who had never before
realized they had such skill are de
signing many of the costumes to be
used in 'Antony and Cleopatra' and
'Caesar and Cleopatra'," said Miss
Helen Green, director of costume de
sign for the mid-August productions.
"The general motif is in associating
color with character as well as mood,"
continued Miss Green. "For instance,
the character of the chief nurse to
Cleopatra is rather grim, almost mur
derous. Her raiment is to be brown
and gray with no other coloring, thus
completely distinguishing her from
the brilliant attire of Cleopatra and the
courtiers.
Armor Construction
"All the armor is made of cardboard.
It is fitted to the actor, and then cov
ered with muslin which is painted,
gilded, or silvered according to the
character.
"Made of linoleum, the sandals
match the cape or mantle of the actor.
A scarlet cape, designed by Robert
Quinsey, is to be used in one scene.
The colors in the cape merge well with
the dress for Cleopatra in the same
scene."
