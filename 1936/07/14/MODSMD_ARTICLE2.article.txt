## Solalinde To Lecture on Art Of the Middle Ages 
### 
Professor Antonio Garcia Solalinde
will give an illustrated lecture on il
luminated Spanish manuscripts of the
Middle Ages on Thursday evening,
July 16, in the Women's Clubhouse at
8 o'clock.
Spanish manuscripts of the Middle
Ages preserve an extraordinary col
lection of illuminations, which have
been little studied until now from the
historical point of view. They have
been studied as an artistic expression
of the different epochs, but not as liv
ing documents which reveal—at times
more precisely than the chronicles and
literary texts —the manner of living,
thinking, and feeling of the medieval
nations.
The general tendency, at present, is
to reconstruct history not as a series |
of political facts, but in the most inti- |
mate and minute aspects of daily life.
Consequently, the miniatures on the
illuminated manuscripts assume a
value which formerly was not recog- i
nizcd because they were assumed to j
be of interest only to the historian of j
pictorial art.
Professor Solalinde will show slides J
of miniatures covering a period of time i
from (he seventh century to the six- i
teenth—emphasizing not only the va- ,
ried interpretations of the artists who I
painted them, but also the richness of |
their expression of the costumes, hab
its, and ideas of those centuries.
Professor Solalinde is acting pro
fessor of Romanic languages at Stan- j
ford this summer. The title of his j
lecture, to be given in Spanish, will be 1
"Miniaturas en Manuscritos Espanoles i
do la Edad Media."
