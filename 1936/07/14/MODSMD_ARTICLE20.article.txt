Professor G. B. Kistiakowsky,
Harvard savant, sat stroking his
greying imaginary beard and
commented on life in general.
The thought which held his
particular attention was the con
nection between horses and chem
istry.
"After the first lesson in chem
istry," said Professor Kistiakow
sky, "one gets a bad headache.
The first ride also gives one a
bad ache."
Changing the subject he said,
"A very interesting reaction can
be obtained by mixing tetrachlo
ride of Rhaja with J(iodine) and
keeping it at boiling point for
three hours.
"This mixture is very explo
sive and therefore must be kept
in the dark."

Caller—Docs Mr. Crawford, a stu

Landlady—Well, Mr. Crawford lives
here, but I thought he was a night
watchman. —Ex.
