# "Educational Platform For 1936" Formulated At Conference
## 
### 
An "Educational Platform for 1936"
urging the public school to make a
vigorous defense of American democ
racy featured the closing session of the
curriculum conference at Stanford Fri
day night. Approximately 1200 per
sons attended the conference.
"Other groups and forces in Ameri
can life may depart from the demo
cratic philosophy, but the school has
an unequivocal mandate to vitalize the
democratic social ideal," declared Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver of the Stanford
School of Education in presenting the
platform.
"The public should not be misled by
the extravagant falsification of minor
ity groups who charge radicalism in
schools either to serve as a smoke
screen for their own selfish activity or
as a technique for arousing public sen
timent against socially desirable but to
them objectionable teaching activity,"
the platform read.
Democracy Threatened
Existing social institutions were por
trayed as having been jarred to their
foundations by the social and cultural
lag behind material advance.
"This conflict and confusion consti
tute a real threat to the preservation
of the democratic way of life. The
maintenance and further development
of our democratic society places -a
heavy burden on the school. No group j
of professional educators ever faced a
greater task," the platform declared. j
Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford, na
tionally known curriculum expert, en
visioned a school program in which ;
students study community problems
lirst - hand and take active part in
neighborhood improvement projects.
"To harness the energy of youth to
the task of progressively improving
community life is the supi'eme chal
lenge to educational and social states
manship," Hanna declared.
1200 Attend
The popularization of better health
practices and diet habits, the construc
tion of more adequate recreational fa- ,
cilities, and improvement of the neigh
borhood esthetically are among the
projects available.
More than hundred teachers j
and administrators attended the clos- j
ing session.
The text of the platform follows:
1. The educational program in a
democracy should be in harmony with
the dominant democratic social values
and aspirations. The school system
should be thought of as society's chief
formal agency to develop in its people
the vision, the creativeness, the initia
tive, and the discipline which will en
able them to live noble personal lives.
Other groups and forces in American
life may depart from the democratic
philosophy; the school has an un- ;
equivocal mandate to vitalize the dem
ocratic social ideal.
2. The present period in the develop
ment of civilization is one of unusual
progress. Thrilling achievements have
been made in the application of sci
ence, in the improvement of health, in
the pi'oduction of goods, in the de
velopment of transportation and com- j
munication, and in many other aspects '
of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.
Progress Not Uniform
3. The rate of progress has not been
uniform in all divisions of our life. Ex
tremely rapid advances in the appli
cation of science and in the develop
ment of a truly remarkable system for
the production of goods have not been
accompanied by advances equally
great in the cultural and social fields.
Hie insecurity in the modern world, I
the poverty, undernourishment, and
slum life in the midst of potential
plenty, the absence of democracy in
the relation between employer and em
ployee, the intolerance toward mi
nority groups, the open and secret

connivance of law enforcement agen
i cies with criminal groups and with
groups which seek to overthrow or
• derly government to crush groups with
ideas and activities in conflict with
their interests, disease, crime, divorce,
and the failure to realize cultural pos
sibilities of the motion picture and the
| radio—these illustrate the need for
j basic advances in the social and cul
' tural areas.
Future Will Differ
4. In periods of rapid change, the fu
! ture society can be expected to differ
I from that of the present and the past
! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.
A weighing of the validity of the
claims on both sides of major contro
' versial issues will make the school a
j positive agent in developing loyalty to
I democracy. To develop an educational
program which informs students of the
j past and the present with the assump
j tion that all that exists today is good is
to admit ignorance of contemporary
life and historic fact or a deliberate
falsification.
Organization Needed
G. The freedom of teachers should
be guaranteed. Minority groups should
| not be allowed to force avoidance of
issues so as to serve their personal
interests. It becomes obligatory for
teachers to effect a strong professional
organization to give group resistance
to these interferences. At the present
J time many teachers consciously avoid
| the study of many important issues
! because of the examples of able teach
ers who have been crushed by minor
j ity groups seeking to control the pub
j lie school.
7. Social welfare and the interests of
I the individual are served best when
human talent is distributed according
j to social need and the individual is
engaged in activity which makes full
use of his talent, in which he can suc
ceed, and in which he is happy. A
sound educational program calls for a
guidance service which aids -the stu
dent in defining major life goals—vo
cational, social-civic, recreational, and
health.
Should Study Individuals
8. The educational program should
| be concerned with the growth, of indi
viduals along all desirable lines—atti
tudes, goals, loyalties, mental and
physical health, and the capacity to
combine these elements into a well

1 integrated, stable, effective, and happy
personality.
9. Text-book and library study is
well adapted for certain types of learn
ing but not for others. Such experi
ences should be supplemented by stu
dent participation in shaping the school
program and, along with adults, in
attempting to improve important as
pects of the life of the community;
creative activity in art, music, writing;
testing of ideas in the laboratory, in
the shop, and on the farm; students
planning their own life and their own
education.
10. Modern schools are taking their
students out into the community, to
study community conditions at first
hand, to identify community prob
lems and, where feasible, to partici
pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
12. Learning experiences should not
be regimented and restricted by sub
ject lines. This regimentation is par
ticularly objectionable when the ad
ministrative policy requires the teach
er to adhere closely to a text or a
course of study outline and to cover a
prescribed body of subject matter. This
subject matter requirement forces the
teacher to place stress on subject mas
tery instead of on well-rounded stu
dent development.
A major "scope and sequence" of
learning activities should be tentatively
planned in advance after careful study
of social needs and the needs of stu
dents at the different maturity levels.
By this method order can be preserved
yet flexibility is provided. The "scope
and sequence" itself should be sub
jected to continuous review with modi
fications made as new evidence indi
cates changes to be desirable.
Better Salaries Required
13. The educational program re
quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an
intellectual climate which calls for in
dependent creative thinking, with the
same freedom accorded the "best" cit
izens of the community; and a salary
sufficient to enable him to maintain
high professional efficiency. Some
people may be deluded into thinking
that salaries can be cut or maintained
at low levels without lowering teach
ing efficiency, but those who are in
formed know that the reduction in
enriching cultui'al experiences be

cause of reduced income seriously
lowers teaching efficiency.
14. The task of reconstructing the
educational program is a complex and
difficult one and one which must be
made gradually by the educative proc
ess. We have an important social
responsibility. The maintenance and
further development of our democratic
society places a heavy burden upon
the school.

No group of professional educators
ever faced a greater task.

five-mile road along the high water
line from the Coyote Conservation
Dam to the Gilroy Hot Springs road
awaits only the approval of the PWA.

! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.
A weighing of the validity of the
claims on both sides of major contro
' versial issues will make the school a
j positive agent in developing loyalty to
I democracy. To develop an educational
program which informs students of the
j past and the present with the assump
j tion that all that exists today is good is
to admit ignorance of contemporary
life and historic fact or a deliberate
falsification.
Organization Needed
G. The freedom of teachers should
be guaranteed. Minority groups should
| not be allowed to force avoidance of
issues so as to serve their personal
interests. It becomes obligatory for
teachers to effect a strong professional
organization to give group resistance
to these interferences. At the present
J time many teachers consciously avoid
| the study of many important issues
! because of the examples of able teach
ers who have been crushed by minor
j ity groups seeking to control the pub
j lie school.
7. Social welfare and the interests of
I the individual are served best when
human talent is distributed according
j to social need and the individual is
engaged in activity which makes full
use of his talent, in which he can suc
ceed, and in which he is happy. A
sound educational program calls for a
guidance service which aids -the stu
dent in defining major life goals—vo
cational, social-civic, recreational, and
health.
Should Study Individuals
8. The educational program should
| be concerned with the growth, of indi
viduals along all desirable lines—atti
tudes, goals, loyalties, mental and
physical health, and the capacity to
combine these elements into a well

1 integrated, stable, effective, and happy
personality.
9. Text-book and library study is
well adapted for certain types of learn
ing but not for others. Such experi
ences should be supplemented by stu
dent participation in shaping the school
program and, along with adults, in
attempting to improve important as
pects of the life of the community;
creative activity in art, music, writing;
testing of ideas in the laboratory, in
the shop, and on the farm; students
planning their own life and their own
education.
10. Modern schools are taking their
students out into the community, to
study community conditions at first
hand, to identify community prob
lems and, where feasible, to partici
pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
12. Learning experiences should not
be regimented and restricted by sub
ject lines. This regimentation is par
ticularly objectionable when the ad
ministrative policy requires the teach
er to adhere closely to a text or a
course of study outline and to cover a
prescribed body of subject matter. This
subject matter requirement forces the
teacher to place stress on subject mas
tery instead of on well-rounded stu
dent development.
A major "scope and sequence" of
learning activities should be tentatively
planned in advance after careful study
of social needs and the needs of stu
dents at the different maturity levels.
By this method order can be preserved
yet flexibility is provided. The "scope
and sequence" itself should be sub
jected to continuous review with modi
fications made as new evidence indi
cates changes to be desirable.
Better Salaries Required
13. The educational program re
quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an
intellectual climate which calls for in
dependent creative thinking, with the
same freedom accorded the "best" cit
izens of the community; and a salary
sufficient to enable him to maintain
high professional efficiency. Some
people may be deluded into thinking
that salaries can be cut or maintained
at low levels without lowering teach
ing efficiency, but those who are in
formed know that the reduction in
enriching cultui'al experiences be

cause of reduced income seriously
lowers teaching efficiency.
14. The task of reconstructing the
educational program is a complex and
difficult one and one which must be
made gradually by the educative proc
ess. We have an important social
responsibility. The maintenance and
further development of our democratic
society places a heavy burden upon
the school.

No group of professional educators
ever faced a greater task.

five-mile road along the high water
line from the Coyote Conservation
Dam to the Gilroy Hot Springs road
awaits only the approval of the PWA.
An "Educational Platform for 1936"
urging the public school to make a
vigorous defense of American democ
racy featured the closing session of the
curriculum conference at Stanford Fri
day night. Approximately 1200 per
sons attended the conference.
"Other groups and forces in Ameri
can life may depart from the demo
cratic philosophy, but the school has
an unequivocal mandate to vitalize the
democratic social ideal," declared Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver of the Stanford
School of Education in presenting the
platform.
"The public should not be misled by
the extravagant falsification of minor
ity groups who charge radicalism in
schools either to serve as a smoke
screen for their own selfish activity or
as a technique for arousing public sen
timent against socially desirable but to
them objectionable teaching activity,"
the platform read.
Democracy Threatened
Existing social institutions were por
trayed as having been jarred to their
foundations by the social and cultural
lag behind material advance.
"This conflict and confusion consti
tute a real threat to the preservation
of the democratic way of life. The
maintenance and further development
of our democratic society places -a
heavy burden on the school. No group j
of professional educators ever faced a
greater task," the platform declared. j
Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford, na
tionally known curriculum expert, en
visioned a school program in which ;
students study community problems
lirst - hand and take active part in
neighborhood improvement projects.
"To harness the energy of youth to
the task of progressively improving
community life is the supi'eme chal
lenge to educational and social states
manship," Hanna declared.
1200 Attend
The popularization of better health
practices and diet habits, the construc
tion of more adequate recreational fa- ,
cilities, and improvement of the neigh
borhood esthetically are among the
projects available.
More than hundred teachers j
and administrators attended the clos- j
ing session.
The text of the platform follows:
1. The educational program in a
democracy should be in harmony with
the dominant democratic social values
and aspirations. The school system
should be thought of as society's chief
formal agency to develop in its people
the vision, the creativeness, the initia
tive, and the discipline which will en
able them to live noble personal lives.
Other groups and forces in American
life may depart from the democratic
philosophy; the school has an un- ;
equivocal mandate to vitalize the dem
ocratic social ideal.
2. The present period in the develop
ment of civilization is one of unusual
progress. Thrilling achievements have
been made in the application of sci
ence, in the improvement of health, in
the pi'oduction of goods, in the de
velopment of transportation and com- j
munication, and in many other aspects '
of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.
Progress Not Uniform
3. The rate of progress has not been
uniform in all divisions of our life. Ex
tremely rapid advances in the appli
cation of science and in the develop
ment of a truly remarkable system for
the production of goods have not been
accompanied by advances equally
great in the cultural and social fields.
Hie insecurity in the modern world, I
the poverty, undernourishment, and
slum life in the midst of potential
plenty, the absence of democracy in
the relation between employer and em
ployee, the intolerance toward mi
nority groups, the open and secret

connivance of law enforcement agen
i cies with criminal groups and with
groups which seek to overthrow or
• derly government to crush groups with
ideas and activities in conflict with
their interests, disease, crime, divorce,
and the failure to realize cultural pos
sibilities of the motion picture and the
| radio—these illustrate the need for
j basic advances in the social and cul
' tural areas.
Future Will Differ
4. In periods of rapid change, the fu
! ture society can be expected to differ
I from that of the present and the past
! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.

quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an
intellectual climate which calls for in
dependent creative thinking, with the
same freedom accorded the "best" cit
izens of the community; and a salary
sufficient to enable him to maintain
high professional efficiency. Some
people may be deluded into thinking
that salaries can be cut or maintained
at low levels without lowering teach
ing efficiency, but those who are in
formed know that the reduction in
enriching cultui'al experiences be

cause of reduced income seriously
lowers teaching efficiency.
14. The task of reconstructing the
educational program is a complex and
difficult one and one which must be
made gradually by the educative proc
ess. We have an important social
responsibility. The maintenance and
further development of our democratic
society places a heavy burden upon
the school.

No group of professional educators
ever faced a greater task.

An "Educational Platform for 1936"
urging the public school to make a
vigorous defense of American democ
racy featured the closing session of the
curriculum conference at Stanford Fri
day night. Approximately 1200 per
sons attended the conference.
"Other groups and forces in Ameri
can life may depart from the demo
cratic philosophy, but the school has
an unequivocal mandate to vitalize the
democratic social ideal," declared Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver of the Stanford
School of Education in presenting the
platform.
"The public should not be misled by
the extravagant falsification of minor
ity groups who charge radicalism in
schools either to serve as a smoke
screen for their own selfish activity or
as a technique for arousing public sen
timent against socially desirable but to
them objectionable teaching activity,"
the platform read.
Democracy Threatened
Existing social institutions were por
trayed as having been jarred to their
foundations by the social and cultural
lag behind material advance.
"This conflict and confusion consti
tute a real threat to the preservation
of the democratic way of life. The
maintenance and further development
of our democratic society places -a
heavy burden on the school. No group j
of professional educators ever faced a
greater task," the platform declared. j
Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford, na
tionally known curriculum expert, en
visioned a school program in which ;
students study community problems
lirst - hand and take active part in
neighborhood improvement projects.
"To harness the energy of youth to
the task of progressively improving
community life is the supi'eme chal
lenge to educational and social states
manship," Hanna declared.
1200 Attend
The popularization of better health
practices and diet habits, the construc
tion of more adequate recreational fa- ,
cilities, and improvement of the neigh
borhood esthetically are among the
projects available.
More than hundred teachers j
and administrators attended the clos- j
ing session.
The text of the platform follows:
1. The educational program in a
democracy should be in harmony with
the dominant democratic social values
and aspirations. The school system
should be thought of as society's chief
formal agency to develop in its people
the vision, the creativeness, the initia
tive, and the discipline which will en
able them to live noble personal lives.
Other groups and forces in American
life may depart from the democratic
philosophy; the school has an un- ;
equivocal mandate to vitalize the dem
ocratic social ideal.
2. The present period in the develop
ment of civilization is one of unusual
progress. Thrilling achievements have
been made in the application of sci
ence, in the improvement of health, in
the pi'oduction of goods, in the de
velopment of transportation and com- j
munication, and in many other aspects '
of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.
Progress Not Uniform
3. The rate of progress has not been
uniform in all divisions of our life. Ex
tremely rapid advances in the appli
cation of science and in the develop
ment of a truly remarkable system for
the production of goods have not been
accompanied by advances equally
great in the cultural and social fields.
Hie insecurity in the modern world, I
the poverty, undernourishment, and
slum life in the midst of potential
plenty, the absence of democracy in
the relation between employer and em
ployee, the intolerance toward mi
nority groups, the open and secret

connivance of law enforcement agen
i cies with criminal groups and with
groups which seek to overthrow or
• derly government to crush groups with
ideas and activities in conflict with
their interests, disease, crime, divorce,
and the failure to realize cultural pos
sibilities of the motion picture and the
| radio—these illustrate the need for
j basic advances in the social and cul
' tural areas.
Future Will Differ
4. In periods of rapid change, the fu
! ture society can be expected to differ
I from that of the present and the past
! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.
A weighing of the validity of the
claims on both sides of major contro
' versial issues will make the school a
j positive agent in developing loyalty to
I democracy. To develop an educational
program which informs students of the
j past and the present with the assump
j tion that all that exists today is good is
to admit ignorance of contemporary
life and historic fact or a deliberate
falsification.
Organization Needed
G. The freedom of teachers should
be guaranteed. Minority groups should
| not be allowed to force avoidance of
issues so as to serve their personal
interests. It becomes obligatory for
teachers to effect a strong professional
organization to give group resistance
to these interferences. At the present
J time many teachers consciously avoid
| the study of many important issues
! because of the examples of able teach
ers who have been crushed by minor
j ity groups seeking to control the pub
j lie school.
7. Social welfare and the interests of
I the individual are served best when
human talent is distributed according
j to social need and the individual is
engaged in activity which makes full
use of his talent, in which he can suc
ceed, and in which he is happy. A
sound educational program calls for a
guidance service which aids -the stu
dent in defining major life goals—vo
cational, social-civic, recreational, and
health.
Should Study Individuals
8. The educational program should
| be concerned with the growth, of indi
viduals along all desirable lines—atti
tudes, goals, loyalties, mental and
physical health, and the capacity to
combine these elements into a well

1 integrated, stable, effective, and happy
personality.
9. Text-book and library study is
well adapted for certain types of learn
ing but not for others. Such experi
ences should be supplemented by stu
dent participation in shaping the school
program and, along with adults, in
attempting to improve important as
pects of the life of the community;
creative activity in art, music, writing;
testing of ideas in the laboratory, in
the shop, and on the farm; students
planning their own life and their own
education.
10. Modern schools are taking their
students out into the community, to
study community conditions at first
hand, to identify community prob
lems and, where feasible, to partici
pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
12. Learning experiences should not
be regimented and restricted by sub
ject lines. This regimentation is par
ticularly objectionable when the ad
ministrative policy requires the teach
er to adhere closely to a text or a
course of study outline and to cover a
prescribed body of subject matter. This
subject matter requirement forces the
teacher to place stress on subject mas
tery instead of on well-rounded stu
dent development.
A major "scope and sequence" of
learning activities should be tentatively
planned in advance after careful study
of social needs and the needs of stu
dents at the different maturity levels.
By this method order can be preserved
yet flexibility is provided. The "scope
and sequence" itself should be sub
jected to continuous review with modi
fications made as new evidence indi
cates changes to be desirable.
Better Salaries Required
13. The educational program re
quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an

of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.
Progress Not Uniform
3. The rate of progress has not been
uniform in all divisions of our life. Ex
tremely rapid advances in the appli
cation of science and in the develop
ment of a truly remarkable system for
the production of goods have not been
accompanied by advances equally
great in the cultural and social fields.
Hie insecurity in the modern world, I
the poverty, undernourishment, and
slum life in the midst of potential
plenty, the absence of democracy in
the relation between employer and em
ployee, the intolerance toward mi
nority groups, the open and secret

connivance of law enforcement agen
i cies with criminal groups and with
groups which seek to overthrow or
• derly government to crush groups with
ideas and activities in conflict with
their interests, disease, crime, divorce,
and the failure to realize cultural pos
sibilities of the motion picture and the
| radio—these illustrate the need for
j basic advances in the social and cul
' tural areas.
Future Will Differ
4. In periods of rapid change, the fu
! ture society can be expected to differ
I from that of the present and the past
! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.
A weighing of the validity of the
claims on both sides of major contro
' versial issues will make the school a
j positive agent in developing loyalty to
I democracy. To develop an educational
program which informs students of the
j past and the present with the assump
j tion that all that exists today is good is
to admit ignorance of contemporary
life and historic fact or a deliberate
falsification.
Organization Needed
G. The freedom of teachers should
be guaranteed. Minority groups should
| not be allowed to force avoidance of
issues so as to serve their personal
interests. It becomes obligatory for
teachers to effect a strong professional
organization to give group resistance
to these interferences. At the present
J time many teachers consciously avoid
| the study of many important issues
! because of the examples of able teach
ers who have been crushed by minor
j ity groups seeking to control the pub
j lie school.
7. Social welfare and the interests of
I the individual are served best when
human talent is distributed according
j to social need and the individual is
engaged in activity which makes full
use of his talent, in which he can suc
ceed, and in which he is happy. A
sound educational program calls for a
guidance service which aids -the stu
dent in defining major life goals—vo
cational, social-civic, recreational, and
health.
Should Study Individuals
8. The educational program should
| be concerned with the growth, of indi
viduals along all desirable lines—atti
tudes, goals, loyalties, mental and
physical health, and the capacity to
combine these elements into a well

1 integrated, stable, effective, and happy
personality.
9. Text-book and library study is
well adapted for certain types of learn
ing but not for others. Such experi
ences should be supplemented by stu
dent participation in shaping the school
program and, along with adults, in
attempting to improve important as
pects of the life of the community;
creative activity in art, music, writing;
testing of ideas in the laboratory, in
the shop, and on the farm; students
planning their own life and their own
education.
10. Modern schools are taking their
students out into the community, to
study community conditions at first
hand, to identify community prob
lems and, where feasible, to partici
pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
12. Learning experiences should not
be regimented and restricted by sub
ject lines. This regimentation is par
ticularly objectionable when the ad
ministrative policy requires the teach
er to adhere closely to a text or a
course of study outline and to cover a
prescribed body of subject matter. This
subject matter requirement forces the
teacher to place stress on subject mas
tery instead of on well-rounded stu
dent development.
A major "scope and sequence" of
learning activities should be tentatively
planned in advance after careful study
of social needs and the needs of stu
dents at the different maturity levels.
By this method order can be preserved
yet flexibility is provided. The "scope
and sequence" itself should be sub
jected to continuous review with modi
fications made as new evidence indi
cates changes to be desirable.
Better Salaries Required
13. The educational program re
quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an
intellectual climate which calls for in
dependent creative thinking, with the
same freedom accorded the "best" cit
izens of the community; and a salary
sufficient to enable him to maintain
high professional efficiency. Some
people may be deluded into thinking
that salaries can be cut or maintained
at low levels without lowering teach
ing efficiency, but those who are in
formed know that the reduction in
enriching cultui'al experiences be

cause of reduced income seriously
lowers teaching efficiency.
14. The task of reconstructing the
educational program is a complex and
difficult one and one which must be
made gradually by the educative proc
ess. We have an important social
responsibility. The maintenance and
further development of our democratic
society places a heavy burden upon
the school.

No group of professional educators
ever faced a greater task.

five-mile road along the high water
line from the Coyote Conservation
Dam to the Gilroy Hot Springs road
awaits only the approval of the PWA.
An "Educational Platform for 1936"
urging the public school to make a
vigorous defense of American democ
racy featured the closing session of the
curriculum conference at Stanford Fri
day night. Approximately 1200 per
sons attended the conference.
"Other groups and forces in Ameri
can life may depart from the demo
cratic philosophy, but the school has
an unequivocal mandate to vitalize the
democratic social ideal," declared Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver of the Stanford
School of Education in presenting the
platform.
"The public should not be misled by
the extravagant falsification of minor
ity groups who charge radicalism in
schools either to serve as a smoke
screen for their own selfish activity or
as a technique for arousing public sen
timent against socially desirable but to
them objectionable teaching activity,"
the platform read.
Democracy Threatened
Existing social institutions were por
trayed as having been jarred to their
foundations by the social and cultural
lag behind material advance.
"This conflict and confusion consti
tute a real threat to the preservation
of the democratic way of life. The
maintenance and further development
of our democratic society places -a
heavy burden on the school. No group j
of professional educators ever faced a
greater task," the platform declared. j
Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford, na
tionally known curriculum expert, en
visioned a school program in which ;
students study community problems
lirst - hand and take active part in
neighborhood improvement projects.
"To harness the energy of youth to
the task of progressively improving
community life is the supi'eme chal
lenge to educational and social states
manship," Hanna declared.
1200 Attend
The popularization of better health
practices and diet habits, the construc
tion of more adequate recreational fa- ,
cilities, and improvement of the neigh
borhood esthetically are among the
projects available.
More than hundred teachers j
and administrators attended the clos- j
ing session.
The text of the platform follows:
1. The educational program in a
democracy should be in harmony with
the dominant democratic social values
and aspirations. The school system
should be thought of as society's chief
formal agency to develop in its people
the vision, the creativeness, the initia
tive, and the discipline which will en
able them to live noble personal lives.
Other groups and forces in American
life may depart from the democratic
philosophy; the school has an un- ;
equivocal mandate to vitalize the dem
ocratic social ideal.
2. The present period in the develop
ment of civilization is one of unusual
progress. Thrilling achievements have
been made in the application of sci
ence, in the improvement of health, in
the pi'oduction of goods, in the de
velopment of transportation and com- j
munication, and in many other aspects '
of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.

pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
12. Learning experiences should not
be regimented and restricted by sub
ject lines. This regimentation is par
ticularly objectionable when the ad
ministrative policy requires the teach
er to adhere closely to a text or a
course of study outline and to cover a
prescribed body of subject matter. This
subject matter requirement forces the
teacher to place stress on subject mas
tery instead of on well-rounded stu
dent development.
A major "scope and sequence" of
learning activities should be tentatively
planned in advance after careful study
of social needs and the needs of stu
dents at the different maturity levels.
By this method order can be preserved
yet flexibility is provided. The "scope
and sequence" itself should be sub
jected to continuous review with modi
fications made as new evidence indi
cates changes to be desirable.
Better Salaries Required
13. The educational program re
quires teachers with deep human sym
pathies, broad social understanding,
rich cultural interests, stable and well
integrated personalities, and special
scholarship in several broad areas of
experience.
Among the conditions requisite are
reasonable security in tenure and an
intellectual climate which calls for in
dependent creative thinking, with the
same freedom accorded the "best" cit
izens of the community; and a salary
sufficient to enable him to maintain
high professional efficiency. Some
people may be deluded into thinking
that salaries can be cut or maintained
at low levels without lowering teach
ing efficiency, but those who are in
formed know that the reduction in
enriching cultui'al experiences be

cause of reduced income seriously
lowers teaching efficiency.
14. The task of reconstructing the
educational program is a complex and
difficult one and one which must be
made gradually by the educative proc
ess. We have an important social
responsibility. The maintenance and
further development of our democratic
society places a heavy burden upon
the school.

No group of professional educators
ever faced a greater task.

five-mile road along the high water

Dam to the Gilroy Hot Springs road

An "Educational Platform for 1936"
urging the public school to make a
vigorous defense of American democ
racy featured the closing session of the
curriculum conference at Stanford Fri
day night. Approximately 1200 per
sons attended the conference.
"Other groups and forces in Ameri
can life may depart from the demo
cratic philosophy, but the school has
an unequivocal mandate to vitalize the
democratic social ideal," declared Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver of the Stanford
School of Education in presenting the
platform.
"The public should not be misled by
the extravagant falsification of minor
ity groups who charge radicalism in
schools either to serve as a smoke
screen for their own selfish activity or
as a technique for arousing public sen
timent against socially desirable but to
them objectionable teaching activity,"
the platform read.
Democracy Threatened
Existing social institutions were por
trayed as having been jarred to their
foundations by the social and cultural
lag behind material advance.
"This conflict and confusion consti
tute a real threat to the preservation
of the democratic way of life. The
maintenance and further development
of our democratic society places -a
heavy burden on the school. No group j
of professional educators ever faced a
greater task," the platform declared. j
Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford, na
tionally known curriculum expert, en
visioned a school program in which ;
students study community problems
lirst - hand and take active part in
neighborhood improvement projects.
"To harness the energy of youth to
the task of progressively improving
community life is the supi'eme chal
lenge to educational and social states
manship," Hanna declared.
1200 Attend
The popularization of better health
practices and diet habits, the construc
tion of more adequate recreational fa- ,
cilities, and improvement of the neigh
borhood esthetically are among the
projects available.
More than hundred teachers j
and administrators attended the clos- j
ing session.
The text of the platform follows:
1. The educational program in a
democracy should be in harmony with
the dominant democratic social values
and aspirations. The school system
should be thought of as society's chief
formal agency to develop in its people
the vision, the creativeness, the initia
tive, and the discipline which will en
able them to live noble personal lives.
Other groups and forces in American
life may depart from the democratic
philosophy; the school has an un- ;
equivocal mandate to vitalize the dem
ocratic social ideal.
2. The present period in the develop
ment of civilization is one of unusual
progress. Thrilling achievements have
been made in the application of sci
ence, in the improvement of health, in
the pi'oduction of goods, in the de
velopment of transportation and com- j
munication, and in many other aspects '
of life . . . but it can still be said that
the process is only well begun.
Progress Not Uniform
3. The rate of progress has not been
uniform in all divisions of our life. Ex
tremely rapid advances in the appli
cation of science and in the develop
ment of a truly remarkable system for
the production of goods have not been
accompanied by advances equally
great in the cultural and social fields.
Hie insecurity in the modern world, I
the poverty, undernourishment, and
slum life in the midst of potential
plenty, the absence of democracy in
the relation between employer and em
ployee, the intolerance toward mi
nority groups, the open and secret

connivance of law enforcement agen
i cies with criminal groups and with
groups which seek to overthrow or
• derly government to crush groups with
ideas and activities in conflict with
their interests, disease, crime, divorce,
and the failure to realize cultural pos
sibilities of the motion picture and the
| radio—these illustrate the need for
j basic advances in the social and cul
' tural areas.
Future Will Differ
4. In periods of rapid change, the fu
! ture society can be expected to differ
I from that of the present and the past
! in many important respects. Conse-
I quently, the social institutions and
! practices which functioned well in the
! past may be ill-adapted to the present
or to the future. The educational pro
gram can appropriately allow greater
stress on the study of conditions of the
j present and of the potentialities of the
future in a period of rapid change.
5. When education shifts its focus
from a study of the past to a study of
contemporary life and its potentialities,
education shifts from a position of mere
I transmission of information to one of
j dynamic influence in social evolution.
A weighing of the validity of the
claims on both sides of major contro
' versial issues will make the school a
j positive agent in developing loyalty to
I democracy. To develop an educational
program which informs students of the
j past and the present with the assump
j tion that all that exists today is good is
to admit ignorance of contemporary
life and historic fact or a deliberate
falsification.
Organization Needed
G. The freedom of teachers should
be guaranteed. Minority groups should
| not be allowed to force avoidance of
issues so as to serve their personal
interests. It becomes obligatory for
teachers to effect a strong professional
organization to give group resistance
to these interferences. At the present
J time many teachers consciously avoid
| the study of many important issues
! because of the examples of able teach
ers who have been crushed by minor
j ity groups seeking to control the pub
j lie school.
7. Social welfare and the interests of
I the individual are served best when
human talent is distributed according
j to social need and the individual is
engaged in activity which makes full
use of his talent, in which he can suc
ceed, and in which he is happy. A
sound educational program calls for a
guidance service which aids -the stu
dent in defining major life goals—vo
cational, social-civic, recreational, and
health.
Should Study Individuals
8. The educational program should
| be concerned with the growth, of indi
viduals along all desirable lines—atti
tudes, goals, loyalties, mental and
physical health, and the capacity to
combine these elements into a well

1 integrated, stable, effective, and happy
personality.
9. Text-book and library study is
well adapted for certain types of learn
ing but not for others. Such experi
ences should be supplemented by stu
dent participation in shaping the school
program and, along with adults, in
attempting to improve important as
pects of the life of the community;
creative activity in art, music, writing;
testing of ideas in the laboratory, in
the shop, and on the farm; students
planning their own life and their own
education.
10. Modern schools are taking their
students out into the community, to
study community conditions at first
hand, to identify community prob
lems and, where feasible, to partici
pate in a program looking toward com
munity betterment.
Youth Faces Crisis
11. The social crisis through which
we are passing makes training of the
social-civic type imperative on the
adult level. The issues before the
American people will not wait for
the youth of the land to attain adult
hood and full citizenship status.
