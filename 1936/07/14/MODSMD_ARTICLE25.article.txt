# Chemistry Aids Man's Comfort Declares Noller
## More Research Necessary If Forward March of Science Is To Continue 
### 
"Applied chemistry is adding greatly
to man's comfort and well-being. It
will continue to do so only in propor
tion to the quality and amount of re
search in the pure science which is
carried on in our universities and re
search institutions." Dr. Carl Noller
stressed this point in his radio talk,
"Chemistry Today," given Monday
night.
"Today the United States is the
largest producer of chemicals, ac
counting for about half of the world
production, but this supremacy is based
on an exploitation of our accumu
lated fund of chemical knowledge."
Dr. Noller explained that the in
dustrial chemist harvests his new
products and processes from new fields
which are opened up through pioneer
ing work without practical aim. The
industrial research chemist insists "Re
search is research and might as well
be directed toward some useful end,
instead of contributing to the already
overwhelming mass of useless data."
But one of the absolute necessities of
an industrial chemist is a chemical
library, which records almost exclu
sively the results of academic investi
gations.
Research Chemist
"The industrial research chemist is
not a magician who can produce any
thing out of his hat that industrial or
political dictators may demand." Dr.
Noller said that "Applied chemistry is
based for the most part on the results
of fundamental research which has
been and still is conducted largely in
the laboratories of the universities."
He made it apparent that it is necessary
for the university investigator to ex
plore the by-ways and extend the
knowledge of all phases of chemistry.
"There are ways in which the chem
ist can and has helped the farmer. But
the farmer cannot depend on the in
dustrial chemist to help him. The
farmer through farm co-operatives or
agricultural corporations must have
his own research organization to de
velop new products from his fats and
carbohydrates and proteins, the chief
raw materials that he produces, and
to keep these products in active com
petition with those of the industrial
chemist."
Dr. Noller continued by saying that
chemical manufacturers as well as all
progressive manufacturers must Em
ploy chemists or the services of con
sulting laboratories, if not for active
development work, at least to keep
abreast of what their competitors are
doing.
"The chemist already knows enough
-so that the number of substances that
he can synthesize is infinite and he
is not limited to any one source of
raw material. His only limitation is
that production of the new substances
must be economical when compared
with that of other substances with
which they must compete."
New Materials
Dr. Noller pointed out that this enor
mous activity in the development of
new materials and processes has in
creased the rate at which products and
equipment become obsolete.
Dr. Noller has done research work
in Europe and for the Eastman Kodak
Company in Rochester. He received
his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois
in 1926.
Thirteen women, but no men, will
appear in "Glee Plays the Game,"
three-act play which will be given at
Washington State College on July 18.
