SAN FRANCISCO takes 1 hour and
55 minutes in which to tell you how
wicked San Francisco was before the
1906 earthquake purged it of its sins.
As in all other tales of this city, the
Barbary Coast is the center of its
vices, but you'll be wondering just
when the show will get good and
wicked.
Of Clark Gable, czar of the wicked,
wicked Barbary Coast, his pal priest
Spencer Tracy says, "He never lies,
cheats, or steals. He is as unscrupu
lous about women as he is ruthless
with men." Gable in spite of such in
consistencies of character is seen in an
excellent role of the type which first
brought him screen recognition.
You may have questioned the deli
cacy of teaming Mr. Gable with prima
donna Jeanette Macdonald, but as her
voice serves her well in versatilities
ranging from honky-tonk ditties,
Faust's heroine, to hymn-singing, the
combination is a good one. Probably
of all her recent pictures Miss Mac
donald is at her best in this because
she does not occupy the center of the
stage but shares acting honors with
Mr. Gable.
Several fine scenes, at times, elevate
the picture to top-rank. The earth
quake shots are realistic enough if
you can imagine a man coming out
alive after a whole wall has fallen
over him, as Mr. Gable does. The final
scene, in which destitute San Fran
ciscans take on new spirit and climb
singing to the top of a hill from which
to view their ruined city, crying out
with resolution to build it up again
more gloriously than ever, eradicates
whatever weaknesses or irregularities
the picture may have.

An exchange whereby a research
fellow from each institution will be
sent to the other for a year's study has
been effected by the State College of
Washington and the University of Halle
at Halle-Saale, Germany.
