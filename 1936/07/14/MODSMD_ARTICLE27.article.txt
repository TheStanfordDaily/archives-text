The terrific heat in the East ac
counted for nearly 2000 lives over the
week-end as well as the hopes of live
Stanford track men. Just what hap
pened to the Stanford boys? Is it true
they were doped? Is it true thev-were
in a wreck? Is it true they all had
fights with their best girls? Is it true
what they say about Dixie?
These and a hundred and one other
questions have been asked by the Cali
fornia-proud boosters of the Stanford
team. But about the only plausible
reason anyone can offer is that the
heat got them down.
Phil Levy, Jim Reynolds, Sam Klop
stock, Jack Weiershauser, and Ed
Burrows all failed to qualify and will
be left behind when the ship sets sail

' the five Cardinals.
But what happened to the ex-Stan
: ford men? Why was it that Ben East
: man, Gordy Dunn, and Norm Bright
made such miserable showings? Ben
: said that "he did the best he could,"
which was typical of the man who has
run the 300 meters in world record
j time.
Of the array of talent Stanford sent
East only Gordy Dunn was able to toss !
; the platter out 157 feet 7'/2 inches and !
i thereby didn't get lost in the rush for j
j seats on the transatlantic ferry.
But the Californians as a whole did
j rather well and managed to land 24
| places out of 71 possibles, a showing
that is generally termed in the ver
| nacular as "not bad."
