# "TIMOTHY"

### 
When an editor's dog geti lost, he'll
be darned if he'll pay 65 cents an
agate line to announce the fact.
The fact is that a black-tan police
P u PP.Vt about two feet high, has been
lost. The dog is about six months old
and answers to the name of "Timothy"
(we're not kidding). Anyone seeing a
dog that fits the description is asked i
to call Palo Alto 5343, and hold him. |
