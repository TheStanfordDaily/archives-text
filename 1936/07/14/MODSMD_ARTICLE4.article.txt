# "Governor Stanford" in Her Last Station
## 
### 
Though the "Governor Stanford"
may appear to be only an undernour
ished and amusing little locomotive in
our generation of streamliners, she
ended her career with a private room
in the Stanford Museum with her his
tory framed on the surrounding walls.
"The Governor's" figure was quite
the latest in 1863 when she left Phila
delphia aboard the ship "Herald of
Morning." Her huge funnel of a smoke
stack was one of the latest inven
tions, and more practical than beauti
ful. The engines were all wood burn
ers and emitted masses of sparks which
started fires. A piece of fine mesh
screen inserted in the stack stopped
the sparks, but also the air. To allow
ample air through the screen the smoke

stacks were made nearly the width of
the engine.
She weathered a trip around the
Horn admirably, but nearly fell over
board in the Sacramento River while
being unloaded. Such an incident
would have been very undignified as
she was greeted by a 35-gun salute and
committee to christen her "Governor
Stanford."
Leland Stanford was governor of
California at the time and, along with
Charles Crocker and Mark Hopkins,
responsible for the daring venture of
building a railroad over the Sierra
Nevada mountains to connect with the
Union Pacific, thus forming the first
transcontinental railroad. This one
little engine aided all through the ac

j tual construction and then made the
first trip over the line.
"Governor Stanford" was being taken
to the junk heap in appreciation of her
service when the Farm offered her a
home. She puffed in under her own
power, only to discover that her figure
couldn't even make the largest door.
For nearly ten years the "Governor"
inhabited a shed in back of Sequoia
and was quite generally unappreci
ated. Eventually the campus digni
taries accommodated her by removing
a sizable portion of wall from the mu
! seum.
Since then the "Governor Stanford"
j has offered her comic countenance and
! life history to the Farm's budding
1 journalists.
