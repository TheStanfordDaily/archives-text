# Prize Offered For Pest Control
## 
### 
One hundred thousand dollars in
American money will be given to any
one able to control the cotton leaf
worm in Egypt, according to a com
munication received here yesterday.
' s No doubt, you are aware that the
cotton leaf worm in Egypt has been a
great curse to us and has been respon
sible for heavy losses in our cotton
crop," the consul general wrote. "It
is with a view to combatting this pest
that the Royal Agricultural Society of
Egypt has launched a campaign offer
ing a prize of 20,000 Egyptian pounds—
about $100,000 —for anyone who can
devise an effective remedy."
Ali Foad Toulba, consul general in
San Francisco for Egypt, is urging the
scientists of the United States to con
centrate on the problem. The worm,
scientifically known as the Prodenia
litura, causes disfiguring blotches on
the cotton leaves.
The remedy must protect the cotton
plant against attack by the worm,
without being injurious to the per
sons, animals, or agriculture. In addi
tion, the remedy should not be costly.
In case more than one effective remedy
is submitted, the Society reserves the
right to divide the prize.

The Department of the Interior will
hold a conference in Portland, Oregon,
on July 27 and 28, to consider conser
vation legislation for the Oregon-Cali
fornia revested public lands.
