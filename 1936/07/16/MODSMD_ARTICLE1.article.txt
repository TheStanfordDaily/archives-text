# Margaret Storey Manages Stage For Classics
## Versatile Cornell Graduate Interested in Study Of Tropical Fish as Hobby

While the stage hands were crank
ing out sound effects, on stage the
first act of "The Bird of Paradise" was
played to the accompaniment of a
terrific mechanical thunder and light
ning storm.
The stage director couldn't hear the
lines of the play above the din and
kept the storm rumbling and swishing
long after the stop cue. The charac
ters, huddled on the stage in the mis
ery of a convincing mechanical storm,
kept solemnly assuring one another of
the simply exhilarating sunny weath
er which followed the storm, or should
have.
This is the story Miss Margaret
Storey, stage manager of the forth
coming campus productions of Shake
speare's "Antony and Cleopatra" and
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," likes
to tell on herself. It illustrates what
might go wrong in a play, but yet does
anyone praise the stage manager when
all goes well? And yet, according to
Miss Storey, the staging responsibility
is all the stage manager's.
Miss Storey, who is the daughter of
Dr. Thomas Storey, head of the Stan
ford physical education department,
has had quite a career in and out of
the theater. After graduating from
Cornell in 3932, she worked as an usher
in the Strand Theater, on Broadway,
to pay her way back to Ithaca, where
she directed plays for two dramatic
clubs.
Miss Storey later became stage man
ager for Jessie Bonstelle, whose stock
companies account for such artists as
Katherine Cornell, Ann Harding,
Katherine Alexander, Melvyn Doug
las, Douglas Dumbrille, and Minor
Watson. Through her three years' as
sociation with Miss Bonstelle, Miss
Storey learned many of the essentials
of professional theater .work, from most
levery angle.
But horrors, Miss Storey is a woman
stage manager! Go speak to Miss
Storey about this and she'll tell you
that that is as it should be or, in
other words, a woman's job is also
distinctly in the wings. There is slight
precedent for this. George Arliss
played in a production which main
tained a woman stage manager—Maud
Howell—of Stanford! The eye for de
tail. That's what men lack, says Miss
Storey. Hence, women for stage man
agement.
As for Miss Storey off stage! Well,
she was in the advertising business.
She was an ichthyologist for New
York's Museum of Natural History—
caught tarpon and sharks off Florida.
Her hobby is the study of tropical
fish. And last spring she received an
M.A. from Stanford in zoology.
