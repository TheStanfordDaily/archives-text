By David Brown
From a house just down the oak
trimmed lane where Maxwell Ander
son lives, at Croton-on-the-Hudson, to
a residence set in the quiet domesticity
of South Pasadena have come manu
scripts to the Verse Drama Contest
which, under the auspices of the Course
in Stage Classics Production, is offer
ing the $100 Maxwell Anderson Prize
for the best dramatic composition in
verse.
Not only from these widely sepa
rated points, but from all America
people have sent in their work. From
rural crossroads villages in lowa and
Nebraska, from Now England ham
lets, as well as from motion picture
scenario writers in Radio City offices,

It was of interest to Dr. Bailey to
office workers in Washington, D.C.,
and San Francisco business men, the
carefully wrapped folders come.

Irving Stone, author of "Lust for
Life," a best selling biographical novel
of two seasons ago which stimulated
the interest in Van Gogh, almost was a
contributor. He sent in a manuscript
but, alas, it was not in verse.
Dr. Margery Bailey, executive direc
tor of the Course in Stage Classics
Production, finds particular signifi
cance in the fact that America is writ
ing, and writing verse. In this con
nection she says, "Apparently it does
n't have to be sought out, it's being
written all over the country."

ing for "social consciousness" as might
be indicated by recent literary move
ments. Only two proletarian verse
dramas have been received. But there
has been an apparent upswing in the
folk drama, and many of the works re
ceived revealed a definite romantic at
titude. The "Winterset" influence is
indicated by a kind of exalted realism
in several manuscripts.
The small town is especially well
represented in the stack of manu
scripts. Perhaps this indicates a res
surection of the great literary democ
racy of America, in which people,
everywhere, wrote, without particu
larly caring to be designated voca
tionally as writers.
