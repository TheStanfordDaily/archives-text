# League Method Analysed By Dr. Temperley
## European War Conferences Are Compared To Wild West Poker Games 
### 
"League methods for settling diplo
matic differences by conferences are
perfect from the point of view of pro
cedure. The reason they don't solve
difficulties is that methods alone won't
do it. Dr. Harold W. V. Temperley,
one of the foremost authorities on
present foreign affairs, emphasized this
point in his talk on "The International
Situation Today" Tuesday evening.
"Methods are lubricants which will
ease the strain on machinery but will
not get pieces of machinery to work
which are not suited to each other."
Dr. Temperley explained that confer
ences will succeed only if there is a
common basis of agreement and if
neither side wants to fight.
Boundary Signifies Peace
The noblest monument to peace, ac
cording to the speaker, is the 3000-mik:
stretch of unfortified territory between
the United States and Canada. "That
is the best indication that conferences
between the British Empire and the
United States are likely to succeed."
Conferences in Europe today were
compared to poker games as played in
the old Wild West as Dr. Temperley
continued. "When one man plays the
ace, the other man pulls out a revolver
and tries to win that way. That is
what has happened recently." He
showed that if Italy's case for creating
an Empire in Abyssinia, or Hitler's
case about the Rhineland, had gone
to the League, these countries would
n't have obtained the satisfaction they
have by use of force.
Protocols Weak
Successful use of force has demon
strated the weakness of protocols,
parchments, paper agreements, and
pacific blockades.
"What, then, is going to keep the
peace?" asked Dr. Temperley. In an
swer to this question, he replied, "The
policemen."
"A policeman doesn't argue with one
who has committed a lawless act, nor
does he apply economic sanctions. He
arrests that person." In the same way,
he pointed out, if Italian troops had
crossed into Sudan they would have
found a British policeman waiting for
them, and German troops would have
found a French policeman waiting in
Alsace.
Dr. Temperley added that whether
or not the new law of the League and
of Geneva is understood, the old law
of the balance of power is still ac
knowledged.
Refers To Pitt
In stressing the advisability of rec
ognizing realities, he referred to young
Pilt's speech to Parliament of 178!) in
which he deplored the separation of
England from America. But he con
soled himself thus, "Misfortunes of in
dividuals and kingdoms that are laid
open and examined with true wisdom
are more than half redressed."
Dr. Temperley named European al
liances as armed and formidable reali
ties because in every case they are al
liances, except where England is con
cerned. He referred to the alliances
btween Belgium and France and Eng
land's aid on the West, and the Franco-
Russian alliance and the Little Al
liance on the East. But the central

block of Italy, Germany, and Poland,
with appendages of Hungary and Bul
garia consists of a loose entente oi* a
series of ententes rather than of a defi
nite alliance.
Connections Maintained
"The connection of Poland with
1 France and of Mussolini with England
I is still maintained in spite of super
i ficial appearances to the contrary.
I There is still room for England to play
j a mediating part with the Alliance on
one side and the Little Entente on the
â–  other."
