Chinatown in San Francisco is the
most picturesque Chinese quarter in
the United States. It is interesting and
attractive, with its Oriental buildings
and shops, including the Chop Suey
restaurants. A stranger would readily
imagine himself in China rather than
in America when he is passing through
the Chinese business center at Grant
Avenue. Every evening there always
are many groups of visitors who come
to see Chinatown and the "mysterious"
Orientals.
The Chinatown quarter lies in the
heart of the northeastern portion of
the city. The boundaries of this dis
trict are Broadway on tho north; Cali
fornia Street on the south; Kearny
Street on the east; and Powell Street
on the west.
Between Kearny and Stockton, there
is Grant Avenue, known as the main
street of Chinatown, which affords
much of interest for the visitors with
its long line of Chinese shops, such as
the bazaars, restaurants, tea houses,
jewelry stores, and book stores, also
the Chinese theater. In other sections
of the district are established many
public associations and all kinds of
shops for the people. This is where the
largest colony of Chinese outside of
China lives its own peaceful life.
Evening Tour Interests
The evening tour of Chinatown with

a professional guide is most interest- |
ing, as the scene of the Chinese quar
ter is at its best during the time. The
visitors should come to visit the China
town's business section, the associa
tions, and the public schools. They
would like to see the Oriental art col
lections, Chinese decorations in the fine
buildings, and to dine at one of the
Chop Suey restaurants.
As the Cantonese cookery is fa
mous over the world, all the Chinese
restaurants serve delicious foods for
the visitors.
Most of the places of interest in Chi
natown are open to the visitors. The
Chinese Consolidated Benevolent As
sociation at 843 Stockton Street, pre
senting an impressive entrance of Ori
ental design, is very attractive to visi
tors. The beautiful house of tho Chi
nese Hospital at 835 Jackson Street is
an Americanized building. The Paci
fic Telephone and Telegraph Company
at 743 Washington Street, known as
Chinatown Telephone Exchange, also
presents an Oriental design on the
front of its building. Every operator
of the Telephone Exchange has a good
memory for the Chinese subscribers,
who always make their calls by ask
ing for the names instead of the con
ventional numbers. This is, however,
quite a puzzle to many visitors' minds.
Theaters Novel
The Mandarin Theater at 1021 Grant
Avenue is a Chinese opera house. The
representations on its stage are many
historical events, but the average
American visitors can hardly under
stand the music and the stories of the
plays.
Other places of interest in China
town are the Chinese Y.M.C.A. at 855
Sacramento Street, the Chinese Y.W.

C.A. at 965 Clay Street, the Central
High School at 829 Stockton Street, the
Chinese American Citizens Alliance at
1044 Stockton Street, etc. As to the
"Joss Houses," there are nothing but
the remains of old Chinese temples. A
visitor who desires detailed informa
tion on Chinatown may apply to one
of the travel associations in the city,
where he can find out the places which
are worthy to see.
Chinese Misunderstood
But, as a matter of fact, the sight
seeing of Chinatown does not lead to
the understanding of the real life of
Chinese people, unless the visitor has
some personal acquaintance with them.
Those who best know China and the
[Chinese people would also know that
the Chinese is a real human being with
| many virtues. Unfortunately there still
are many distorted notions about Chi
natown in this country. Some well
, meaning but mis - informed people
I whose knowledge of the* Chinese is
merely gained through the movies and
fiction, always fail to understand the
real Chinese life. San Francisco's Chi
natown is a colorful community of the
Chinese in America. The Chinese
leaders conduct night schools for their
American-born children; have estab
\ lished associations for their people;
and publish daily newspapers for their
readers.
Many Chinese merchants have had
j great success in their business, and
| even the workers have done well in
! their social lives. The American Chris
tian missions have made significant
contributions in Chinatown; this is
likely to mark the Americanization of
the Chinese in the United States, and
perhaps an aid to the mutual under-
I standing of Chinese and Americans.
