This summer there are about 200
undergraduates on the campus and
nearly 500 graduates. To date the Daily
has been written for and to these
graduates with no notice having been
taken of the real reasons for this Uni
versity.
These undergrads have been plead
ing with the reporters, editors, in
short, nearly everyone connected with
the Daily staff for some news to make
them laugh, cry, eat their hair, and
otherwise interest them. But the
main trouble is that there just ain't
no news. So for those who are inter
ested in what their fellow men are
doing as undergraduates here at
Stanford this column is designed.

From very unreliable sources it has
been learned that Pop Grant, man
mountain tackle of the heretofore in
vincible Red Go-cart, has made a small
wager that he will reach a mere 210 by
the time the boys line up for Tiny's
inspection next fall. Right now he tips
the scales at a light 250. A mei'e noth
ing, journalistically speaking. Easy
money has made Pop's mouth water,
however, to such an extent that it is
very doubtful as to just how such a
task is to be accomplished. For break
fast Pop easily digests one cannon,
two hogsheads of iron filings, and
washes it down with a reservoir of
chlorine. After breakfast, feeling the
need of exercise, he dashes madly
from the kitchen to the front porch,
where he sits until noon, whittling
battleships.
Since he has decided to give up
lunch, at noontime he just stands up
and walks around the porch for a pe
riod of two minutes, followed by a
light workout in a pail of water. After
lunch he decides he needs a little
something to keep him going until
dinner time, so he trots out to the ar
boretum and digs imaginary post holes
with a toothpick. Then dinner time
rolls around. For dinner Pop swal
lows a light repast of two barrels of
nails, one horse, and eight barrels of
flour. At night he goes to sleep in the
top of a tree.

One of the summer school teachers
stopped the other day at the Shell
station on the highway near the sta

versationalist and interested in what
was going on in the world, she began
questioning the attendant on duty.

money has made Pop's mouth water,
however, to such an extent that it is
very doubtful as to just how such a
task is to be accomplished. For break
fast Pop easily digests one cannon,
two hogsheads of iron filings, and
washes it down with a reservoir of
chlorine. After breakfast, feeling the
need of exercise, he dashes madly
from the kitchen to the front porch,
where he sits until noon, whittling
battleships.
Since he has decided to give up
lunch, at noontime he just stands up
and walks around the porch for a pe
riod of two minutes, followed by a
light workout in a pail of water. After
lunch he decides he needs a little
something to keep him going until
dinner time, so he trots out to the ar
boretum and digs imaginary post holes
with a toothpick. Then dinner time
rolls around. For dinner Pop swal
lows a light repast of two barrels of
nails, one horse, and eight barrels of
flour. At night he goes to sleep in the
top of a tree.

One of the summer school teachers
stopped the other day at the Shell
station on the highway near the sta
dium and asked for gas. Being a con
versationalist and interested in what
was going on in the world, she began
questioning the attendant on duty.
This summer there are about 200
undergraduates on the campus and
nearly 500 graduates. To date the Daily
has been written for and to these
graduates with no notice having been
taken of the real reasons for this Uni
versity.
These undergrads have been plead
ing with the reporters, editors, in
short, nearly everyone connected with
the Daily staff for some news to make
them laugh, cry, eat their hair, and
otherwise interest them. But the
main trouble is that there just ain't
no news. So for those who are inter
ested in what their fellow men are
doing as undergraduates here at
Stanford this column is designed.

From very unreliable sources it has
been learned that Pop Grant, man
mountain tackle of the heretofore in
vincible Red Go-cart, has made a small
wager that he will reach a mere 210 by
the time the boys line up for Tiny's
inspection next fall. Right now he tips
the scales at a light 250. A mei'e noth
