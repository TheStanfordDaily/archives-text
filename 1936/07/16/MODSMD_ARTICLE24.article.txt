Representative dramas based on
history from the Greek to the present
neriods were treated by Mr. Frank
Fenton of San Francisco State College
in the second of the series of Tudor
Lectures last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
The speaker mentioned in particu
lar Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleo
patra" and the Restoration Periods,
using Dryden's "All for Love" as an
example because it, too, deals with the
Cleopatra story. He took one drama
from the eighteenth century, Addison's
"Cato," one from the Victorian pe
riod, and finally Shaw's "Caesar and
Cleopatra."
"How the changing attitudes toward
great historical figures have been re
flected in their treatment on the
stage" was illustrated by exemplify
ing the Greeks who used the great hero
as a symbol for the working out
of an external destiny; the Elizabeth
ans considering the hero first of all as
a man motivated by understandable
human impulses. The Restoration
dramatist romanticized the heroic
character to illustrate chivalric virtues.
The Victorians were inveterate hero
worshippers, finding in the great fig
ures of history all the strength and
certainty they themseTves lacked.
