# British Films Seen On Way Up
## 
### 
By Stephen Enke
An English film is coming to the
Stanford Theater, starring Jessie Mat
thews, and entitled "It's Love Again."
When it is realized that only five other
British films have over been shown
generally on this coast such an event
becomes news.
When sound came in American su
premacy in film production went out.
The barriers of language were found
to be as effective as any tariff wall.
The American film became limited to
English speaking countries.
Yet even here a snag arose. Al
though Americans are supposed to
speak English the inhabitants of that
island don't think so. British audiences
squirmed before the nasal intonations

i of American stars.
Inspired perhaps by this fact, such
| studios as Gaumont British and Lon
don Films sought to expand and im
prove, Money was the secret. Sound
j films are costly to make. Local talent,
when it was recognized, was too apt
! to leave immediately for Hollywood,
where it could cash in. Today British
studios can afford to pay high salaries
and such producers as Michael Bal
con or Alexander Korda can be as
lavish as any de Mille or Lubitsch.
To celebrate their majority such
j films as "Henry VIII" and "Catherine
the Great" were made. So successful
l were they that every leading player in
j their casts is today a successful star:
I such players as Charles Laughton,

I Merle Oberon, Wendy Barrie, and Bin
nie Barnes all had their start with
London Films.
British films have come of age. They
1 have money and they have talent.
They could do with more of both but
they have at least enough of each. At
lirst they tried to emulate American
films and only succeeded in making a
poor imitation of a poor model. Today
the British are less afraid of original
ity and are seeking to develop some of
j the many aspects of cinema that have
been overlooked by us. If they have
had some terrible flops they have also
| had some great successes.
Over 4500 students have registered
I at Stanford in the last school year.
