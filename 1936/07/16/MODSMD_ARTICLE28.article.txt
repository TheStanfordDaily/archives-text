# Critic Views Art In Life

### Dorothy Hodgins 
"As long as we have disintegrated
society which does not adhere to some
specific scale of values, we shall also
have disintegrated art. When we re
cover some semblance of social order,
we shall have significant art, because
art always reflects the philosophies and
beliefs of the people," said Dr. Kurt
Frank Reinhardt, associate pi'ofessor
of German, in an interview.
"We cannot possibly think of educat
ing artists; we can only try to educate
true human characters. If we suc
ceed, we will have great artists."
Art for Art's Sake Functionlcss
"The general attitude today in re
gard to art is still determined by im
pressionistic art—'Art for art's sake'—
which means that art fulfills no vital
function in society. The artist is noth
ing but an after dinner entertainer who
provides irresponsible pleasure, sweet
ness, and sentimentality. This accounts
on a current subjective attitude which
is only interested in getting out of
artistic appreciation certain chills and
thrills. All opinion that anything that
is useful cannot possibly have any
thing to do with art," declared Rein
hardt.
The prevailing opinion that the artist
is irresponsible makes him irrespon
sible, eccentric, Bohemian—a hot house
plant in that he has no real contact

with our daily lives. Modern society
and the artist cannot understand one
another. The artist develops a lingo
of his own, becomes individualistic,
and produces the abstract in art. He is
a high class entertainer apart from
society."
Dr. Reinhardt said that contrary
to this attitude is the conviction that
art has a tremendous social signifi
cance. That it is the most adequate
expression of the social forces and
philosophies of any period or age. Art
should take an important place in edu
cation as a force in the integration of
human endeavor."
"Art is skill," continued Dr. Rein
hardt, "and there is no essential dif
ference between fine arts and the
crafts. It is only an artificial distinc
tion in degree, but not in the essence
of kind."
"Before the Renaissance art was a
necessity of every day life as much in
reach of the poor as the wealthy. Fol
lowing the Renaissance, art became a
luxury aiming to satisfy the wealthy,"
Dr. Reinhardt explained.
Dr. Reinhardt pointed out that some
of the contemporary artists are coming
back to time honored principles and
conceptions. This is true not only of
our engineers and architects but our
American artists.
