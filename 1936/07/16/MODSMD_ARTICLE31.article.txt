The Editor, Sir:
What strange phenomenon has oc
curred during the past month to bring
about a blind spot in the eyes of the
average campus driver as he passes the
English corner find the Paly Station?
It has long been a proud Stanford
custom to pick up one's footweary fel
low students while riding to and from
the campus without even causing them
the humiliation of raising a thumb.
Yours for fewer hot walks down Palm
Drive, G. E. B.
The Giant's Causeway, near Portrush
in Ireland, is a group of over 40,000
columnar rocks.
