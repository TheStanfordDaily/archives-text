# Chemists Like To Spin Tops

### Betsy Ross 
The chemists around here have tak
en to spinning tops. Not that they
would own up to such a pastime:
they call the machine they have de
vised a "supercentrifuge" and claim
that it constitutes an important ad
vancement for science.
This centrifuge is capable of 350,000
revolutions a minute. This is roughly
equivalent to 100 times the rotational
speed of a Ford V-8 engine at 70
miles an hour. Should a piece of the
top break away it would travel with
the speed of a bullet for a distance of
five miles before it came to a stop. Be
cause of such dangers the centrifuge is
enclosed in heavy steel.
The top is used to separate mole
cules like hemoglobin from their solu
tion. It consists of a conical piece of
steel about two inches in diameter in
serted in a stator. The cone is revolved
by compressed air pushed through
holes in the stator and the greater the
pressure the more revolutions a sec

ond. The centrifugal force of this ap
paratus is 1,200,000 times greater than
the gravitational attraction of the
earth.
The action of a gravitational field on
solution of different densities is to
cause sedimentation (settling out) of
the denser compound. The effect is
seen in the familiar example .of an
ordinary cream separator. Here the
milk is rotated at a relatively high
velocity, the centrifugal force of the
rotation being greater than the gravi
tational field of the earth.
As the suspended particles become
smaller an increasingly intense gravi
tational field is necessary to cause this
separation t>° occur with appreciable
speed.
If one is interested in causing sedi«
mentation of particles of molecular di
mensions extremely great centrifugal
force becomes necessary, and it is for
the purpose of producing these that the
spinning top ultra centrifuge was de
veloped. «

I At very high speeds metal com
| pounds can be made to separate as eas
ily as water and gasoline can ordi
! narily be.
It might seem that the problem of
measuring such high rates of rotation
| would be difficult. Actually, it is sim
ple. No top is ever perfectly sym
' metrical and consequently it emits a
musical note, the pitch of which varies
| with the frequency of rotation. A
! speed of several thousand revolutions
| a second causes the centrifuge to
i whistle. By matching this note with a
! calibrated tuning fork the speed can
j easily be computed.
Such "tops" as this one were orig
inally devised abroad. The one now
being used by the chemistry depart
! ment cost $450 to build. Had a more
! conventional method been used to
| generate such rotational speeds a plant
! costing well over $80,000 would have
I had to have been built. A transparent
centrifuge, so that the sedimentation
process can be observed and photo-
I graphed, has also been developed.
