# 'Chappie' Adopts New Policies
## Gist Starts File of American College Humor 
### 
The Chaparral, Stanford's only in
tentionally humorous publication, has
ambitious plans for the future, an
nounced Gilman Gist, editor-elect,
late yesterday. Although his plans for
next year are purely tentative he
hopes that Chaparral, under his
guidance, will effect the following:
Aided by its wide exchange activi
ties, Editor Gist intends to start a file
of American college humor which can
be used for current needs as well as
for research purposes 50 years from
now. In this manner it is hoped that
a representative cross section of college
humor will be collected and current
slang usage recorded and thus pre
served.
In much the same manner an at
tempt will be made to preserve Stan
ford customs and traditions so that a
continuity between old and new stu
dents will be maintained. As it is, much
of the drama of past days is fading
rapidly.
Of a more definite nature, Editor
Gist announces plans for three special
numbers next year. Besides the usual
Big Game number in November there
will probably be an election number
in the preceding month which will
satirize the political candidates and
their platforms and the elections. There
will also be a Hasher's number featur
ing the forgotten man of Stanford,
whose function in the food process ma
chinery is so often forgotten. When
the New Theater is completed a dra
matics number is anticipated.
