# 'Comedy of Errors' To Use Puppets
## Tomorrow's Performance To Illustrate Use of New And Diverting Medium 
### 
About puppets, John Carter Ford,
who will use them in putting on
Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors" at
the Dance Studio, Women's Gymna
sium, at 8 o'clock tomorrow night, has
this to say:
"Each puppet must be all good, or
all bad; all jolly or all entirely mo
rose; silly or stately; for a puppet's
face is modeled with his disposition
and his temperament revealed for all j
the world to recognize. If it were not
thus, he would not be a puppet, but a
meaningless doll—his play insipid."
Casting a Shakespearean play of
which, in the case of "Comedy of Er
x-ors," critics have said that the char
acters do not possess the requisite
sharpness of personality for the me
dium of puppets, is a task which calls
upon the full genius of the puppeteer.
But Mr. Ford has defined his char
acters, and his cast of 16 puppets have |
all the foibles to develop the farce— |
the tearful wife who always fears the
worst —her prim sister with unbear
ably optimistic advice — the bill col- •
lector and his fleeter victim.
In "Comedy of Errors," which is be
ing produced Friday evening <under
the auspices of the Course in Stage
Classics Production as part of the ac
tivities culminating in the presentation
of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleo
patra" and Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo
patra on August 13, 14, and 15,
Mr. Ford is using guignol, or hand
puppets, which are ideal for the
vitality and rapidity of action neces
colorful costumes of the period adding
sary for hilarious comedy. With the
to the gayety of the work, the produc
tion should be a most happy one, and
certainly diverting.
But moi-e about Mr. Ford. Puppet- 1
playing has been a hobby with him for
these past 10 years. Both he and his !
wife incorporated this work into their !
educational activities in their Summer j
Theater for Children and Ford Country 1
Day School, at Los Altos.
"There is no pretense in puppet
showing," wrote Emma Sheriden in
The Coronado Journal, "an impalpable j
fabric of symbol spills 'thc-thing-it- j
self."
"I hope the John Carter Fords will j
come up this way and rescue us —Jack |
and his Margaret and their puppets
know things and do things that set
dreams loose, still turmoil, and float
us out into wonders, and new laugh
ter."
