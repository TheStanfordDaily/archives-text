# Stanfordites Drink Gallons—So Do Lawns
## 
### 
It may be pretty hard for you to I
i swallow—but the Stanford lawns and
J gardens find between four and five
I thousand million gallons of water a
, year just a satisfying gulp. All that for
irrigation only — yet there is still
plenty of water in the nearby lakes.
During the summer, 19.000,000 gal
lons a week are needed to keep Stan
! ford's gardens green.

You may have had it all figured out
i as to the exact mileage from the library
I steps to the nearest bar—or the time
! it takes to saunter over to the Union
| from Toyon Hall—but have you ever
! the exact amount of lawn
; Stanford has to offer? Fifteen acres is
I the total, as quoted from Mr. McDon
nell, superintendent of buildings and
j grounds. "And that," he ventured, "is

| some lawn!"
Yet when questioned as to the num
ber of acres the gardens occupy, he had
to admit that that was a sticker. "Your
guess is as good as mine on that one,"
he said.
The day being warm, conversation
I naturally turned to drinking water.
Do you know that it takes between
two and three million gallons a week
to make your between-class sips a
reality. The rest goes into the swim
ming pools—and is usually swallowed
in due time anyway.
10 Gardeners Employed
Forty gardeners are busily engaged
in weeding and watering and perform
ing all the other semi-magical duties
which result in the green and bloom
ing Farm.
1 As for lawn mowing—to look at the

| one decrepit old stand-by which has
i served for many long years as a power
j mower, one would conclude that Stan
i ford lawns were never destined to have
i their hair cut at all. But according to
| Mr. McDonnell, the Board of Athletic
i Control has loaned one rather new
: power mower which is capable of trav
eling over the golf course and the
women's hockey field at a compara
' tively high speed.
But for all his experience in garden
ing, Mr. McDonnell admitted that try
as he may, there is one little acre which
won't grow anything. Curiously
enough, it has so far failed to respond
to his personal care. He decided to
withhold its location until ho manages
to coax it into bloom so that the on
rush of sightseers might have some
thing to gaze at.
