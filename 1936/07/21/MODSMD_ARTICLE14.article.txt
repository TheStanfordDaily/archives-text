Building Is Gift
The building is the gift of Dr. El 1 -

of education, and his wife, Helen Cub

actually prepared by Dr. Cubberley in
consultation with university architects
Arthur Brown, Jr., and John Bakewell.
At the time the gift was first made to
the University in 1933 it was in the
form of $400,000 worth of stocks and
bonds. At the present market value
it is worth $500,000, and University au
thorities expect that by the time the
money is paid out earnings and appre
ciation in value will meet the cost of
the building.
Future Location
The location of the building will bo
on the southwest corner of the project
ed Library Quadrangle on Lasuen
Street directly east of the Civil Engi
neering Building.
In the new building there will be
91 rooms with a seating capacity of
1187, thus increasing the University's
classroom capacity by 15 per cent. The
auditorium in the building will hold
462. There will be 33 offices, four li
brary rooms to accommodate 210 stu
dents.
The School of Education Library
will contain stacks with a capacity of
125,000 volumes.
In addition, the building will have
12 working rooms of which three will
be laboratories. For the use of students
there will be a social room with a
kitchenette, seven cubicles, 23 special
rooms, and two research rooms.
Changing the building policy of the
University, only the front of the build
ing will have sandstone. The remain
der will be built of reinforced con
crete because of the economy and
strength of the material.
