# Ocean Is Fine Germ Killer

### 
Science has now given daughter an
other good reason for going in the wa
ter, and likewise has developed some
more pleasing news for those who like
to go down to the sea in bathing suits.
The ocean has now been labeled as the
biggest and perhaps the best of all germ
killers.

Bacteria of public health interest
simply cannot survive raw sea water
for any great length of time, according i
to Professor Claude E. Zoßell of the
staff of the Scripps Institution of !
Oceanography, University of Califor- j
nia. While marine bacteria have a
chance, naturally, the failure of fresh
water bacteria to survive in the sea has !
been attributed by various investiga
tors to predacious protozoa, lack of
nutrients, or "the lethal effect of sun
light." At any rate, there appears to
be something in raw ocean and sea
water besides the salts which exercises !
a potent bactericidal effect, and science
is trying to find out definitely what that
something is.
In determining the germicidal quali
ties of sea water, the Scripps Institution
engaged in a number of detailed tests,
greater health potency than either the
heated or the filtered variety. The tests
went even so far as the preparation of a
synthetic or "manufactured" sea water
to see how the bacteria would behave
when placed therein. It was found that
this synthetic water did not kill nearly
as quickly as the real article taken from
Ihe ocean.
Professor Zoßell's findings, which
have been submitted to the Society for
Experimental Biology and Medicine,
contain a number of examples of the
germ-killing power of sea water and
stated that the bactericidal potency of
such water may be even greater than
the experiments disclosed.
