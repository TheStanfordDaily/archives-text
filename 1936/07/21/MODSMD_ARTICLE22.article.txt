Just why the printer cut out the <
point of the last story in this column
the other day is £till somewhat of a
mystery around the office, but since it
is still a good story and bears repeat

One of the summer school teachers
stopped the other day at the Shell sta
tion on the highway near the stadium
and asked for gas. Being a conversa
tionalist and interested in what was
going on in the world, she began ques
tioning the attendant on duty.
"You know, I didn't walk all around
that big place over there," she said,
pointing to the stadium, "but I wonder
if you would mind telling me if that
was the swimming pool?"

When gardeners are bi'ought into
play to help young girls escape the
clutches of boisterous dinner compan- j
ions it generally makes news in some
part of the paper.
Anyone who had been standing out- t
side one of the hash-houses down the
road last Friday night would have |
been just a trifle amazed to see a
couple of girls climbing through the j
window of what they said was the
ladies' dressing room. Standing there
watching a poor old gardener pile
boxes on top of one another, is one j
thing, but seeing a tangle of female ■
limbs dangling over the window sill is I
, another. After much clattering of j
boxes and scraping of legs, however,
the girls were safely deposited on the
ground and fled for their car.

I understand Dick Barbour finally
woke up the other day and resigned his
job as night watchman on the new
theater.

Last night I jumped upon my bed,
I heard a cry, "My God I'm dead,"
I jumped upon the bed today,
I guess he's dead, he didn't say.
