# Shells Are Hobby Of Mrs. Oldroyd
## 
### 
On the third floor of the geology '
building, amidst the finest private shell
collection in the world, sits Mrs. Ida
Shepard Oldroyd, eminent shell col
lector. Mrs. Oldroyd will be eighty
years old in November, yet she works
away on her manuscripts and new spe
cies with untiring interest.
"There's so much to be one; I've fin
ished five books, but there are three
more to be completed. I must finish my
book on the shells of British Columbia
in a month or two. There are several
more species yet fo be described for the
British Columbia book," she explained. ]
Mrs. Oldroyd has just returned from
the East where she started a three
volume work on Atlantic Coast spe
cies. Mrs. Oldroyd is an international !
authority on Pacific Coast shells.
"I do hope I'll get up to Puget Sound
and then go East again soon. Of course,
the recent removal of one eye from
over-work at the microscope has slowed
me down a little," said Mrs. Oldroyd.
"Working with shells is dirty, inter
esting work. You won't do it unless
you like it. I would be lost without
such a wonderful interest. I don't see
how other people get along without
absorbing work. I guess I was born a
collector, for when I first walked I be
gan collecting stones and shells," as
serted Mrs. Oldroyd.
Dr. and Mrs. Oldroyd came to Stan
ford in 1916 and worked together as
curator and assistant curator up to the
time of Dr. Oldroyd's death. Since that
time, Mrs. Oldroyd has carried on the
work alone.
