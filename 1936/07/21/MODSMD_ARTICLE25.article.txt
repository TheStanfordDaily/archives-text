# Radio Speaker Comments On Federal Finance
## Dr. Fagan Enlarges Theme Of "Fiscal Fallacy" and Explains Effects of Loans 
### 
"That present loan expenditures will
be shifted to future generations is
without economic validity," stated Dr.
Elmer D. Fagan, professor of econom
ics, in a radio speech given last night,
from station KGO.
He enlarged on his theme "Fiscal
Fallacy" by pointing out that this al
leged effect of federal loan is used by
some as an argument for, and by others
as an argument against the extensive
use of public credit under the Roose
velt Administration.
"Those who sanction or condemn
present federal spending and borrow
ing must find other grounds for their
position," he alleged.
Two Questions of Debts
Two questions of debt burden are
the expenditure, the economic and so
cial effect of the borrowed funds, and
the redemption, or the burden in
volved.
"Will the redemption of outstanding
federal bonds constitute a crushing
economic burden on posterity?" was
the question raised by the speaker.
Answering the query, he continued
by stating that the only method by
which a nation may shift the burden
of debt redemption is by selling its
long term bonds to a foreign country
or to citizens of a foreign country.
"The redemption of a debt owed to
foreignei-s is an exhaustive expenditure
while the payment of domestic or in
ternal debt is a transfer expenditure.
It is the failure to understand this
fundamental distinction which is re
sponsible for the persistent fiscal fal
lacy which we are discussing."
Meanwhile he explained that an ex
haustive expenditure does involve the
actual using up or giving up of a part
of the country's resources, whereas a
transfer expenditure does not involve
this principle.
Three Conclusions Drawn
Three significant conclusions reach
ed by Dr. Fagan were, "First, we must
rest our case either for or against gov
ernmental borrowing and spending on
grounds other than the fallacious opin
ion that the redemption of our domes
tic debt will constitute a crushing bur
den on generations yet unborn.
"Second, taxation required for the
redemption of federal bonds should be
equitably distributed among all indi
viduals of the bond redeeming genera
tion.
"Third, that one of the conditions
necessary for an equitable distribution
of tax burdens is that interest from
government bonds be treated as a form
of taxable income.
