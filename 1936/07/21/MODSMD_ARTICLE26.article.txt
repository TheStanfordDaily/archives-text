# Stanford Man Makes Altimeter

### 
Now pilots can know exactly how
many feet they descended in the last
air pocket. Professor David Webster
combined his aviation with his in
ventive genius and the result is an im
proved altimeter.
By watching the result of changes
in air pressure in the device the pilot
can tell of any change in altitude im
mediately. The altimeter consists of a
sealed thermos filled with air of ground
level. Attached to the bottle is a U
shaped tube containing apiezon oil, one
end of which is inserted in the bottle
and the other left open.
The device is so sensitive that the
change in air pressure made by walk
ing up a flight of stairs will cause the
liquid to rise perceptibly in the open
end of the tube.
