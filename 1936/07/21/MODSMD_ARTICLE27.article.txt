John Carter Ford's puppets saucily |
{ going through the speech and actions
! of Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors"
j were surprisingly good theater, last
j Friday night.
Armed with prejudices against child- J
j ish entertainment we were given rea- i
i son to guffaw consistently and admit
that maybe this is what l-evivers of j
Shakespeare for popular appeal should i
anchor to.
In just one hour, streamlined man- !
ner if you wish, these charming and
I graceful creations of their manipulator |
took one into a fourth dimension of
receptivity, really evoking a new kind j
of laughter. Least of all did they lend
themselves to caricature but such sat- j
' ire and irony was achieved as prob- j
j ably humans aren't capable of.
These tiny beings in so short time
| made clear a story that it has been
j our lot to see a cast of live persons j
; prod through pompously without at I
| all bringing out the wee nuances that |
! give Shakespeare his delicious zest
[ and spirit.
, As to achieving definite personali
! ties, Mr. Ford's creatures did this and
; more. The bewildered twin brothers,
j their effervescent twin servants, the
! overbearing advice giving sister, the
suspicious wife, and even the loud
bill-collector—all came to life deftly
catching the characteristics of then
written originals.

"POPPY'' is too big a dose of W. C.
Fields' shambling branch of comedy.
The usual hokum of combination bad
man and lovable rogue is carried to
extremes that are tedious throughout.
Set in among scenes of a carnival j
town as medidne man Eustace Mc-
Gargle, Fields nas ample opportunity
for displaying the profile of his bottle- j
shaped nose while his daughter Pop
py (Rochelle Hudson) is smitten with j

I love for the mayor's son, John Crom- 1
well. A forged marriage certificate of 1
j her estimable father brings her a for- [
tune and an engagement to Cromwell.
Melodrama then stalks in in the !
j shape of a villainous lawyer who ex
i poses Poppy's papa, but the trick is
turned when Poppy is proven a real
| heiress and not Eustace's daughter.
! All ends happily when Cromwell turns
j he-man and sweeps Poppy off her feet.
The picture is all Fields but John j
Cromwell does well in an insipid role. ;
j Rochelle Hudson, besides using her
j eyes, attempts singing songs which
would have been better left unsung.
"IT'S LOVE AGAIN" comes from '
i British Gaumont, offering no competi- ,
j tion to American films although a fin- I
ish and dialogue are achieved that !
have heretofore been absent from the I
I ordinary products of this studio. But it 1
j is Robert Young, late of Hollywood, j
I who adds the sparkle and not star Jes-
I sie Matthews of the wide-eyed stare
and not too good acting.
Lavish scenes patterned after New
York musical comedies and much
dancing and singing by Jessie Mat
thews combine into an average picture
which, however, deserved top-billing
over "Poppy."

Soon after midnight of Wednesday a
; spook show is to be given at the Var-
I sity Theater. Jaclar and his Spook
Show will be down for the night, and
in order to give just the correct at- i
mosphere before the stage show starts,
Manager Honore of the Varsity has
decided to first run the motion picture
; thriller, "The Ghost Walks."
The entertainment will include all
the usual tricks of the trade replete
with bats, ghosts, skulls, balls of fire,
ringing bells and singing violins. All
the 'feature attractions of a spiritualist
; seance will be offered the audience.
