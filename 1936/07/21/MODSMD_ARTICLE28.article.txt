# Your Teeth Thrive On Poi

### 
Sunny Hawaii can lay claim to a [
number of things that leave a pleasant I
taste. Science now caps this situation i
with a finding that the celebrated Ha
waiian dish known as poi, when com- I
bined with plenty of sunshine, is an
excellent food for the building up and
maintenance of sound, healthy tooth
and bone structure. An article by Dr.
Hermann Becks and Dr. Nina Simmons,
of the University of California College
of Dentistry, appearing in a recent edi
tion of the American Dental Association
Journal, states.
"Poi, a food long used in Hawaii, is a
good source of calcium and phosphorus
when it is used in generous amounts, as
it apparently was hy the early Hawai
ians. With plenty of sunshine, which in
turn means abundant vitamin D, it is
not strange that the early Hawaiians
had excellent bones and teeth. Fish and

other foods available furnished protein
and the other necessary vitamins.
"Owing to the intensive sunshine,
which in turn means an abundance of
vitamin D, the diet of the population as
a whole should contain an abundance of
calcium as well as other factors. This
was true when poi furnished such a
large part of the food supply of the
early Hawaiians."
One investigator found that poi con
tains about twice as much vitamin B
as milk, according to the article.
Touching on certain dietary items
otherwise and their relation to tooth
health, the article states that an indi
cated change in diet in order to bring
"about tooth health is not always easy
to attain.
"Some adults do not like milk; oth
ers believe they cannot take it; still
others want, a hot drink with their
meals and they do not want cocoa.
