### 
"Our methods of thinking about so
cial affairs are badly out of line with
contemporary scientific methods. Yet
these methods are just as applicable to
the social as to the physical world,"
said Doctor George A. Lundberg, act
ing professor of sociology at Stanford,
in commenting on his speech, "The
Thoughtways of Contemporary So
ciety" which will be given Thursday
evening at 7:30 in the Women's Club
house.
"We have stopped thinking of phys
ical events as the manifestations of
malevolent minds, spirits, or personali
ties," said Dr. Lundberg, "yet we still
waste our energies in ranting and de
nunciation of men and social events
which are themselevs as much the
products of natural forces as are the
storms, the wind and the drought."
According to Dr. Lundberg the pres
ent day people talk a lot about old
fashioned and antiquated ways of be
havior in the modern world, but their
talk is rarely based on anything that
might savor of scientific investigation,
not real scientific facts. Most people
refuse to look at themselves or their
contemporaries except from a personal
viewpoint, never in a detached, imper
sonal way. If they would do this then
they would be approaching some sort
of a scientific viewpoint.
Dr. Lundberg received his Ph.D. de
gree from the University of Minnesota
in 1925. Since 1933 he has been teach
ing at Bennington College in Vermont.
