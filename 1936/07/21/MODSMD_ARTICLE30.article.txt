# Pan-American Road Opened
## 
### 
Motorists from all parts of the Unit
ed States are heading southward now
that the Pan American highway from
Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City is offi
cially open. For the benefit of those
tourists, the common warning signs are
interpreted:
"Alto"—Stop
"Despacio"—Slow
"F.C."—Railroad Crossing
"Curva"—Curve
"Cruce de Camino"—Highway Cross
ing
"Escuela"—School
"Peligro"—Danger
"Prohibe Estacionarse"—No Parking
At regular intervals along the high
way, numbered posts will be noted.
These are kilometer posts, not mile
posts. A kilometer is about five
eights of a mile. Remember this when
you see a sign reading "Velocidad
Maxima 60 km. per H." It does not
mean a maximum speed of GO miles
per hour, but 60 kilometers per hour,
or about 45 miles.
Miss Mae Madden of Atherton and
Robert Clancy, Stanford '34, were mar
ried last Saturday in Palo Alto.
