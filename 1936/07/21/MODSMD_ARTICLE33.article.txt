# Rural "Slum" Cure Suggested
## 
### 
(Reprinted from the New York
Times):
It is a drastic cure for our farm prob
lem that Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor recom
mends. He advocates nothing less than
permanent abandonment of 1,000,000
American farms embracing 250,000,000
acres of land out of the present total of
1,055,000,000 acres. He calls it "squeez
ing the slums out of agriculture."
Dr. Taylor is director of the Food
Research Institute of Stanford Univer
sity and has long been regarded as one
of cur foremost authorities on agricul
tural Whatever other au
thorities may say about his specific fig
ures, it is hard to question the sound
ness of his general reasoning.
Our immediate problem is to restore
as far as possible our former foreign
markets for agricultural products. The
solution of this is not entirely in our
own hands, but a great deal could still
be accomplished by a continuance of
Secretary Hull's policy of bilateral tar
iff tx-eaties, and much more by a reduc
tion of many of our tariff duties, re
gardless of what other countries do.
Only by making increased imports pos
sible can we provide other countries
with the dollar exchange necessary to
buy our agricultural products.
When we have done as much as is
reasonably possible in this direction,
however, we may still find ourselves
with a large number of unprofitable
farms. The AAA solution of the prob

lem of unprofitable farming, which is
also in part the solution offered by the
present Soil Conservation Act, is the
creation of an artificial scarcity. It is
true that what Dr. Taylor has in mind
also involves some reduction in our
agricultural output. But though the
two plans have certain elements in
common, the differences are vital. The
reductions brought about by the AAA,
both in crops and in agricultural em
ployment, were sudden and sharp. The
40 per cent cut in our cotton acreage
took as much good as bad soil out of
production. It compelled" the low-cost,
efficient, productive farm to cut down
as much as the high-cost, inefficient,
unproductive farm. And through scar
city prices or direct bonuses, or both,
the AAA program subsidized these
marginal farms to stay in business.
Where a gradual and orderly retire
ment of bad farm land would allow
other lines time to absorb the farm
labor thrown out of work, the AAA
program, according to some? estimates,
threw 2,000,000 farm laborers out of
work suddenly at a time when un
employment was already unparalleled.
Our agricultural problem now is to
effect a transition from the impro
vised AAA policy to a long-range pol
icy that will make no attempt to per
petuate pre-war "parities" either of
volume or of price, but will recognize
the basic changes that have occurred
in the last two decades.

sity and has long been regarded as one
of cur foremost authorities on agricul
tural Whatever other au
thorities may say about his specific fig
ures, it is hard to question the sound
ness of his general reasoning.
Our immediate problem is to restore
as far as possible our former foreign
markets for agricultural products. The
solution of this is not entirely in our
own hands, but a great deal could still
be accomplished by a continuance of
Secretary Hull's policy of bilateral tar
iff tx-eaties, and much more by a reduc
tion of many of our tariff duties, re
gardless of what other countries do.
Only by making increased imports pos
sible can we provide other countries
with the dollar exchange necessary to
buy our agricultural products.
When we have done as much as is
reasonably possible in this direction,
however, we may still find ourselves
with a large number of unprofitable
farms. The AAA solution of the prob

lem of unprofitable farming, which is
also in part the solution offered by the
present Soil Conservation Act, is the
creation of an artificial scarcity. It is
true that what Dr. Taylor has in mind
also involves some reduction in our
agricultural output. But though the
two plans have certain elements in
common, the differences are vital. The
reductions brought about by the AAA,
both in crops and in agricultural em
ployment, were sudden and sharp. The
40 per cent cut in our cotton acreage
took as much good as bad soil out of
production. It compelled" the low-cost,
efficient, productive farm to cut down
as much as the high-cost, inefficient,
unproductive farm. And through scar
city prices or direct bonuses, or both,
the AAA program subsidized these
marginal farms to stay in business.
Where a gradual and orderly retire
ment of bad farm land would allow
other lines time to absorb the farm
labor thrown out of work, the AAA
program, according to some? estimates,
threw 2,000,000 farm laborers out of
work suddenly at a time when un
employment was already unparalleled.
Our agricultural problem now is to
effect a transition from the impro
vised AAA policy to a long-range pol
icy that will make no attempt to per
petuate pre-war "parities" either of
volume or of price, but will recognize
the basic changes that have occurred
in the last two decades.
