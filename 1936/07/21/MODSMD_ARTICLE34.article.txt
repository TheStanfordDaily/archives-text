Vigorously defending correspond
ence schools and striking out at school
men "who intentionally or uninten
tionally have boycotted" them, Dr.
George A. Lundberg, visiting faculty
member at Stanford, asked for an ex
tension of adult education facilities at a
schoolmen's luncheon last Thursday.
"Unless we are willing to abandon
entirely the idea of general education
we must resort to methods by which
the adult population at large can be
reached," Dr. Lundberg declared.
Dr. Lundberg envisioned a broad
adult program made available at low
cost to the average American embrac
ing correspondence courses, sound
inovies, and radio. He offered comfort
to adults who "fear their learning days
are over" by citing studies which indi
cate that the abilities of extension stu
dents increase with age until they have
reached 50 years.
"The tremendous growth in exten
sion courses are symptomatic of a
growing recognition of the incongruity
of an educational system which makes
the main cultural resources of man the
special privilege of a small percentage
of the population who are able to crash
the gates of our colleges," Dr. Lund
berg said.
