# It's Open Season On Killer – Cats, But Not on Quail
## 
### 
A bird in the bush is worth two
on toast.
At least that's what the local
law says about the valley quail
that roam around the campus—
dragging their broods behind
them.
And backing it up are Deputy
Sheriff Fred Frehe and his cam
pus police patrol.
Excellent feeding conditions, a
mild climate, and friendly police
protection are among the advan
tages Stanford affords to this fa
vorite California game bird. Quail
population, consequently, shows a
steady upward trend.
Hazards to quail's health, how
ever, were listed as stray house
cats, human poachers, and blue
jays in that order. The felines
are subject to shooting on sight,
Frehe warns, and promises fine
or imprisonment for game law
violators.
The entire Stanford campus of
5000 acres is a state game refuge,
Frehe pointed out, and full pro
tection will be given newly
hatched quail broods. All game
refuge areas are designated by
posted signs, he said.
