# New Reservoir Will be Built Near Campus
## 
### 
Searsville Lake is to have a neigh
bor which will be called the San Fran
cisquito Reservoir. But because it is
to be a reservoir, swimmers and boat
ers will have to limit themselves to
just looking at it —its purpose in life
will be to provide water for household
use, in Palo Alto and on the campus.
Mr. Alfred L. Trowbridge, Stanford
assistant comptroller, stated that it may
be two or three years before it is ac
tually a reality. However, sooner or
later the $400,000 project will be com
pleted.
Since this part of the country is so
dependent on storage water, the open
ing of the new reservoir will bring
about a new subdivision area.
"Our present residential areas are
limited because the present water sup
ply can't take care of any more," Mr.
Trowbridge explained.
"For perhaps the first ten years after
construction the surplus water could
be sold to Palo Alto. But Stanford will
ultimately use it all," Mr. Trow
bridge added.
The San Francisquito Dam will be
built one mile downstream from the
junction of the Corte Madeira and Bear
Gulch Creeks, which is about half a
mile below Searsville Lake.
