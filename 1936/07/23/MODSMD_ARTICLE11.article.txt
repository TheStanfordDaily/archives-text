# Another Stage Manager Tells All
## 
### David Brown 
The man of whom one professor has |
remarked, "He is like a handful of i
string beans tied together with a rub
ber band," is the business manager of |
the forthcoming campus productions j
of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleo- )
patra" and Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo- j
patra," being presented under the aus- !
pices of the Course in Stage Classics i
Production on August 13, 14, and 15.
Mr. George Z. Wilson describes his
arrival on the campus very simply:
"I arrived at Stanford without sheets J
or blankets, thinking the University j
would supply them."
Following his arrival, Mr. Wilson
"tried out for innumerable plays." j
Says Mr. Wilson, "I failed to prove to j
Mr. Helvenston that I was the Hamlet
type."
Mr. Wilson made his first big deci
sion in his sophomore year. It was j
then he foresook the law for dramatics. '
I asked him how far he had gone with
the law? He replied, "I just antici
pated it."
Mr. Wilson's first appearance on the

Stanford stage was in the 1931 "Gaie
ties." He was a mimic—mimicking Val
lejo Gantner as Death in "Death Takes
a Holiday." When Mr. Wilson* joined
the Palo Alto Community Players,
"Turning his eyes community-ward,"
as he says, he had the exquisite pleas
ure of receiving a hand on a walk-on
as Lord Burghley in "The Critic." He
attributes this to the excellent quality
of the scenery behind which he hid. In
this connection Mr. Wilson well re
members it took him three days to get
the clown make-up out of his hair.
Danced Adagio
Mr. Wilson played seventeen offstage
voices in a Palo Alto production of
"Louder Please." He also played three
speaking parts and two walk-ons in
the Baldwin Macgaw production of
"Hamlet" in San Francisco. The comic
adagio dance Mr. Wilson performed
with Jean Hay in the 1935 "Follies
Bourgeois" may be recalled.
Mr. Wilson is a member of Sword
and Sandals, Ram's Head, and was for
two years president of the English
Club. He was a public speaking in

1 structor at Stanford last year and for
! the past two summers has been em
ployed with the production of summer
| plays as stage manager and business
| manager. This summer he is manag
i ing the business phase of the produc
! tion, as well as teaching a course in
Business of the Theater. ,
Brought Gertrude Stein Here
One of Mr. Wilson's claims to fame
| is that he brought Gertrude Stein to
! the campus. He found her "extreme
ly human" and chatted freely with her
backstage. The nature of the chat was
not revealed.
Nevertheless, Mr. Wilson did reveal
! that he has a standing invitation to
1 visit Miss Stein at her Paris apartment.
J Last winter Mr. Wilson sent Miss
1 Stein a Christmas card. It was re
turned a few weeks later, undelivered
I and unopened. Mr. Wilson was quite
upset about it for a time but now,
seven months later, he feels somewhat
resigned and consoled. Ever hopeful,
: Mr. Wilson thinks that the card must
have been delivered on the wrong bank
I of the Seine.

with Jean Hay in the 1935 "Follies
Bourgeois" may be recalled.
Mr. Wilson is a member of Sword
and Sandals, Ram's Head, and was for
two years president of the English
Club. He was a public speaking in

1 structor at Stanford last year and for
! the past two summers has been em
ployed with the production of summer
| plays as stage manager and business
| manager. This summer he is manag
i ing the business phase of the produc
! tion, as well as teaching a course in
Business of the Theater. ,
Brought Gertrude Stein Here
One of Mr. Wilson's claims to fame
| is that he brought Gertrude Stein to
! the campus. He found her "extreme
ly human" and chatted freely with her
backstage. The nature of the chat was
not revealed.
Nevertheless, Mr. Wilson did reveal
! that he has a standing invitation to
1 visit Miss Stein at her Paris apartment.
J Last winter Mr. Wilson sent Miss
1 Stein a Christmas card. It was re
turned a few weeks later, undelivered
I and unopened. Mr. Wilson was quite
upset about it for a time but now,
seven months later, he feels somewhat
resigned and consoled. Ever hopeful,
: Mr. Wilson thinks that the card must
have been delivered on the wrong bank
I of the Seine.
The man of whom one professor has |
remarked, "He is like a handful of i
string beans tied together with a rub
ber band," is the business manager of |
the forthcoming campus productions j
of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleo- )
patra" and Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo- j
patra," being presented under the aus- !
pices of the Course in Stage Classics i
Production on August 13, 14, and 15.
Mr. George Z. Wilson describes his
arrival on the campus very simply:
"I arrived at Stanford without sheets J
or blankets, thinking the University j
would supply them."
Following his arrival, Mr. Wilson
"tried out for innumerable plays." j
Says Mr. Wilson, "I failed to prove to j
Mr. Helvenston that I was the Hamlet
type."
Mr. Wilson made his first big deci
sion in his sophomore year. It was j
then he foresook the law for dramatics. '
I asked him how far he had gone with
the law? He replied, "I just antici
pated it."
Mr. Wilson's first appearance on the

Stanford stage was in the 1931 "Gaie
ties." He was a mimic—mimicking Val
lejo Gantner as Death in "Death Takes
a Holiday." When Mr. Wilson* joined
the Palo Alto Community Players,
"Turning his eyes community-ward,"
as he says, he had the exquisite pleas
ure of receiving a hand on a walk-on
as Lord Burghley in "The Critic." He
attributes this to the excellent quality
of the scenery behind which he hid. In
this connection Mr. Wilson well re
members it took him three days to get
the clown make-up out of his hair.
Danced Adagio
Mr. Wilson played seventeen offstage
voices in a Palo Alto production of
"Louder Please." He also played three
speaking parts and two walk-ons in
the Baldwin Macgaw production of
"Hamlet" in San Francisco. The comic
adagio dance Mr. Wilson performed
with Jean Hay in the 1935 "Follies
Bourgeois" may be recalled.
