# Rowell Urges Maintenance of Economic Issues
## Hoover Attentive Listener As S. F. Editor Scores All Party Platform Planks 
### 
While Herbert C. Hoover, former
president of the United States, sat in
conspicuously but attentively in a back
seat of the Assembly Hall Tuesday
night, Dr. Chester Rowell, editor <>l
the San Francisco Chronicle, defined
the "single" issue" of the current po
litical campaign in terms of the tradi
tional American economic system.
Denouncing both conventions, Dr.
Rowell urged his audience to "ignore
both platforms." As head of the Cali
fornia Republican delegation to Cleve
land, Rowell claimed that the perform
ance of the Republican platform com
mittee was "especially ignominious."
Borah Blamed
Mr. Rowell blamed Senator Borah
particularly for bringing pressure on
the committee which resulted in the
"poor G.O.P. platform." Declaring that
Mr. Borah "wished to save hi.s egotism
when he discovered that he had no
chance of becoming a candidate," Dr.
Rowell charged that the senator had to
"pretend that he wanted certain things
in the platform."
Th ree of these things were criticised
by Dr. Rowell. He didn't like the fact
that "gold was not mentioned once in
the platform although the committee
was greatly in favor of the gold stand
ard."
This omission, "fortunately, was rem
edied by Mr. Landon in a telegram
to the convention."
Planks Denounced
The other two planks that Rowell de
nounced were the foreign relations
plank which "repudiated all previous
Republican party platforms and .ill
previous Republican presidents," and
the anti-monopoly plank which is
"meaningless."
Before Rowell undertook to analyze
the "real issue" he took occasion to pre
dict the end of political conventions as
they are now constituted. The only
thing a delegate goes to a convention
for, he said, is to "shout and march"
and to "take the program and like it."
But the radio had made this "circus"
an impossibility, Rowell said, and. as
a result, conventions may well become
deliberative bodies wherein "candi
dates are chosen openly."
"What I have to say may seem fan
tastic," Rowell said, "but not in view
of what is happening elsewhere
throughout the world."
"The things we have taken for
granted are being repudiated nearly
everywhere," he declared. "Hitherto
societies were divided into two classes,
those which had arrived at industrial
capitalism and those that had not yet
arrived."
Systems Bring Change
But all this is now changed by Iwo
great systems of "contagious ideas af
fecting all the world." Rowell de
scribed Ihese as Fascism, "which pre
served private ownership but not con
trol," and Communism, which has
abolished "private ownership of the
means of production."
Having described these alternative
courses of American politics, Rowell
said that the only way to escape them
was to vote the Republican ticket. Out
side of America (he rest of (he world
is either fascist or communist where
"every human liberty" is forbidden.
j "Although many Democrats will de- j
clare their loyalty to the traditional '
economic and political system in Amer
ica," Dr. Rowell said that certain tend- j
encies of government interference in
business would inevitably bring the
i country into the Communist or fascist
camp.
"What are the arguments that the ■
G.O.P. will make to show this drift >o |
the left if the present New Deal is con
tinued?" Mr. Rowell asked. "It is that
the policies, if continued for another
four years, will make it impossible to
reverse the tendency down to Com
munist or Fascist systems."
As an example of one such New \
Deal policy, Dr. Rowell said that it is j
"possible that even the Democrats |
I cannot reverse the present financial
policy in government."
Government Is Financier
"Already the government is the
principal financier of the country. It is
i lending great quantities of money at
j the top and at the bottom. Banks are
' dependent on government because they
! own government bonds. To continue
| this for another four years may mean
j that the road down to government con
; trol of business has gone so far that it
| cannot be reversed." *
I As a result, Rowell predicted that i
I another four years of New Deal con- i
trol would lead inevitably to Commun
-1 ism or Fascism. He therefore urged
the voting of the Republican ticket in
\ November.
I During the course of his talk, Rowell j
summarized the two other parties in
the field—the Communist party, which
believed that the "revolution will not
I come through them as agent," and the
| "believers in miracles" — the Lemke
third party, the Townsendites, and the
Share-the-Wealthers.
Of this third party, Dr. Rowell point
j ed out that all Lemke wanted was to
"print more money to pay farm mort
gages." He described Coughlin as lead
ing a party of "demagoguery and in
tolerance." Of the Share the Wealth
party, Rowell could see "no permanent
unity between the League for Social 1
Justice, headed by the Catholic priest,
l and the Share the Wealth group, head
ed by a man who believes the "Pope
is the worst enemy of the United
States."
j "Politics makes strange bedfellows,"
Rowell said as he told his audience that
"you can expect to see great cordiality
between the conservative wing of the j
Republican party and the radical wings
of the third party."
The reason: The third party may split
; the Democratic vote and throw the
I election to Landon.

I cannot reverse the present financial
policy in government."
Government Is Financier
"Already the government is the
principal financier of the country. It is
i lending great quantities of money at
j the top and at the bottom. Banks are
' dependent on government because they
! own government bonds. To continue
| this for another four years may mean
j that the road down to government con
; trol of business has gone so far that it
| cannot be reversed." *
I As a result, Rowell predicted that i
I another four years of New Deal con- i
trol would lead inevitably to Commun
-1 ism or Fascism. He therefore urged
the voting of the Republican ticket in
\ November.
I During the course of his talk, Rowell j
summarized the two other parties in
the field—the Communist party, which
believed that the "revolution will not
I come through them as agent," and the
| "believers in miracles" — the Lemke
third party, the Townsendites, and the
Share-the-Wealthers.
Of this third party, Dr. Rowell point
j ed out that all Lemke wanted was to
"print more money to pay farm mort
gages." He described Coughlin as lead
ing a party of "demagoguery and in
tolerance." Of the Share the Wealth
party, Rowell could see "no permanent
unity between the League for Social 1
Justice, headed by the Catholic priest,
l and the Share the Wealth group, head
ed by a man who believes the "Pope
is the worst enemy of the United
States."
j "Politics makes strange bedfellows,"
Rowell said as he told his audience that
"you can expect to see great cordiality
between the conservative wing of the j
Republican party and the radical wings
of the third party."
The reason: The third party may split
; the Democratic vote and throw the
I election to Landon.
While Herbert C. Hoover, former
president of the United States, sat in
conspicuously but attentively in a back
seat of the Assembly Hall Tuesday
night, Dr. Chester Rowell, editor <>l
the San Francisco Chronicle, defined
the "single" issue" of the current po
litical campaign in terms of the tradi
tional American economic system.
Denouncing both conventions, Dr.
Rowell urged his audience to "ignore
both platforms." As head of the Cali
fornia Republican delegation to Cleve
land, Rowell claimed that the perform
ance of the Republican platform com
mittee was "especially ignominious."
Borah Blamed
Mr. Rowell blamed Senator Borah
particularly for bringing pressure on
the committee which resulted in the
"poor G.O.P. platform." Declaring that
Mr. Borah "wished to save hi.s egotism
when he discovered that he had no
chance of becoming a candidate," Dr.
Rowell charged that the senator had to
"pretend that he wanted certain things
in the platform."
Th ree of these things were criticised
by Dr. Rowell. He didn't like the fact
that "gold was not mentioned once in
the platform although the committee
was greatly in favor of the gold stand
ard."
This omission, "fortunately, was rem
edied by Mr. Landon in a telegram
to the convention."
Planks Denounced
The other two planks that Rowell de
nounced were the foreign relations
plank which "repudiated all previous
Republican party platforms and .ill
previous Republican presidents," and
the anti-monopoly plank which is
"meaningless."
Before Rowell undertook to analyze
the "real issue" he took occasion to pre
dict the end of political conventions as
they are now constituted. The only
thing a delegate goes to a convention
for, he said, is to "shout and march"
and to "take the program and like it."
But the radio had made this "circus"
an impossibility, Rowell said, and. as
a result, conventions may well become
deliberative bodies wherein "candi
dates are chosen openly."
"What I have to say may seem fan
tastic," Rowell said, "but not in view
of what is happening elsewhere
throughout the world."
"The things we have taken for
granted are being repudiated nearly
everywhere," he declared. "Hitherto
societies were divided into two classes,
those which had arrived at industrial
capitalism and those that had not yet
arrived."
Systems Bring Change
But all this is now changed by Iwo
great systems of "contagious ideas af
fecting all the world." Rowell de
scribed Ihese as Fascism, "which pre
served private ownership but not con
trol," and Communism, which has
abolished "private ownership of the
means of production."
Having described these alternative
courses of American politics, Rowell
said that the only way to escape them
was to vote the Republican ticket. Out
side of America (he rest of (he world
is either fascist or communist where
"every human liberty" is forbidden.
j "Although many Democrats will de- j
clare their loyalty to the traditional '
economic and political system in Amer
ica," Dr. Rowell said that certain tend- j
encies of government interference in
business would inevitably bring the
i country into the Communist or fascist
camp.
"What are the arguments that the ■
G.O.P. will make to show this drift >o |
the left if the present New Deal is con
tinued?" Mr. Rowell asked. "It is that
the policies, if continued for another
four years, will make it impossible to
reverse the tendency down to Com
munist or Fascist systems."
As an example of one such New \
Deal policy, Dr. Rowell said that it is j
"possible that even the Democrats |

a result, conventions may well become
deliberative bodies wherein "candi
dates are chosen openly."
"What I have to say may seem fan
tastic," Rowell said, "but not in view
of what is happening elsewhere
throughout the world."
"The things we have taken for
granted are being repudiated nearly
everywhere," he declared. "Hitherto
societies were divided into two classes,
those which had arrived at industrial
capitalism and those that had not yet
arrived."
Systems Bring Change
But all this is now changed by Iwo
great systems of "contagious ideas af
fecting all the world." Rowell de
scribed Ihese as Fascism, "which pre
served private ownership but not con
trol," and Communism, which has
abolished "private ownership of the
means of production."
Having described these alternative
courses of American politics, Rowell
said that the only way to escape them
was to vote the Republican ticket. Out
side of America (he rest of (he world
is either fascist or communist where
"every human liberty" is forbidden.
j "Although many Democrats will de- j
clare their loyalty to the traditional '
economic and political system in Amer
ica," Dr. Rowell said that certain tend- j
encies of government interference in
business would inevitably bring the
i country into the Communist or fascist
camp.
"What are the arguments that the ■
G.O.P. will make to show this drift >o |
the left if the present New Deal is con
tinued?" Mr. Rowell asked. "It is that
the policies, if continued for another
four years, will make it impossible to
reverse the tendency down to Com
munist or Fascist systems."
As an example of one such New \
Deal policy, Dr. Rowell said that it is j
"possible that even the Democrats |
I cannot reverse the present financial
policy in government."
Government Is Financier
"Already the government is the
principal financier of the country. It is
i lending great quantities of money at
j the top and at the bottom. Banks are
' dependent on government because they
! own government bonds. To continue
| this for another four years may mean
j that the road down to government con
; trol of business has gone so far that it
| cannot be reversed." *
I As a result, Rowell predicted that i
I another four years of New Deal con- i
trol would lead inevitably to Commun
-1 ism or Fascism. He therefore urged
the voting of the Republican ticket in
\ November.
I During the course of his talk, Rowell j
summarized the two other parties in
the field—the Communist party, which
believed that the "revolution will not
I come through them as agent," and the
| "believers in miracles" — the Lemke
third party, the Townsendites, and the
Share-the-Wealthers.
Of this third party, Dr. Rowell point
j ed out that all Lemke wanted was to
"print more money to pay farm mort
gages." He described Coughlin as lead
ing a party of "demagoguery and in
tolerance." Of the Share the Wealth
party, Rowell could see "no permanent
unity between the League for Social 1
Justice, headed by the Catholic priest,
l and the Share the Wealth group, head
ed by a man who believes the "Pope
is the worst enemy of the United
States."
j "Politics makes strange bedfellows,"
Rowell said as he told his audience that
"you can expect to see great cordiality
between the conservative wing of the j
Republican party and the radical wings
of the third party."
The reason: The third party may split
; the Democratic vote and throw the
I election to Landon.
While Herbert C. Hoover, former
president of the United States, sat in
conspicuously but attentively in a back
seat of the Assembly Hall Tuesday
night, Dr. Chester Rowell, editor <>l
the San Francisco Chronicle, defined
the "single" issue" of the current po
litical campaign in terms of the tradi
tional American economic system.
Denouncing both conventions, Dr.
Rowell urged his audience to "ignore
both platforms." As head of the Cali
fornia Republican delegation to Cleve
land, Rowell claimed that the perform
ance of the Republican platform com
mittee was "especially ignominious."
Borah Blamed
Mr. Rowell blamed Senator Borah
particularly for bringing pressure on
the committee which resulted in the
"poor G.O.P. platform." Declaring that
Mr. Borah "wished to save hi.s egotism
when he discovered that he had no
chance of becoming a candidate," Dr.
Rowell charged that the senator had to
"pretend that he wanted certain things
in the platform."
Th ree of these things were criticised
by Dr. Rowell. He didn't like the fact
that "gold was not mentioned once in
the platform although the committee
was greatly in favor of the gold stand
ard."
This omission, "fortunately, was rem
edied by Mr. Landon in a telegram
to the convention."
Planks Denounced
The other two planks that Rowell de
nounced were the foreign relations
plank which "repudiated all previous
Republican party platforms and .ill
previous Republican presidents," and
the anti-monopoly plank which is
"meaningless."
Before Rowell undertook to analyze
the "real issue" he took occasion to pre
dict the end of political conventions as
they are now constituted. The only
thing a delegate goes to a convention
for, he said, is to "shout and march"
and to "take the program and like it."
But the radio had made this "circus"
an impossibility, Rowell said, and. as
a result, conventions may well become
deliberative bodies wherein "candi
dates are chosen openly."
"What I have to say may seem fan
tastic," Rowell said, "but not in view
