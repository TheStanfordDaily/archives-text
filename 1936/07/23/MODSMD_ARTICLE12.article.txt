# Rowell Urges Maintenance of Economic Issues
## Hoover Attentive Listener As S. F. Editor Scores All Party Platform Planks 
### 
While Herbert C. Hoover, former
president of the United States, sat in
conspicuously but attentively in a back
seat of the Assembly Hall Tuesday
night, Dr. Chester Rowell, editor <>l
the San Francisco Chronicle, defined
the "single" issue" of the current po
litical campaign in terms of the tradi
tional American economic system.
Denouncing both conventions, Dr.
Rowell urged his audience to "ignore
both platforms." As head of the Cali
fornia Republican delegation to Cleve
land, Rowell claimed that the perform
ance of the Republican platform com
mittee was "especially ignominious."
Borah Blamed
Mr. Rowell blamed Senator Borah
particularly for bringing pressure on
the committee which resulted in the
"poor G.O.P. platform." Declaring that
Mr. Borah "wished to save hi.s egotism
when he discovered that he had no
chance of becoming a candidate," Dr.
Rowell charged that the senator had to
"pretend that he wanted certain things
in the platform."
Th ree of these things were criticised
by Dr. Rowell. He didn't like the fact
that "gold was not mentioned once in
the platform although the committee
was greatly in favor of the gold stand
ard."
This omission, "fortunately, was rem
edied by Mr. Landon in a telegram
to the convention."
Planks Denounced
The other two planks that Rowell de
nounced were the foreign relations
plank which "repudiated all previous
Republican party platforms and .ill
previous Republican presidents," and
the anti-monopoly plank which is
"meaningless."
Before Rowell undertook to analyze
the "real issue" he took occasion to pre
dict the end of political conventions as
they are now constituted. The only
thing a delegate goes to a convention
for, he said, is to "shout and march"
and to "take the program and like it."
But the radio had made this "circus"
an impossibility, Rowell said, and. as
a result, conventions may well become
deliberative bodies wherein "candi
dates are chosen openly."
"What I have to say may seem fan
tastic," Rowell said, "but not in view
of what is happening elsewhere
throughout the world."
"The things we have taken for
granted are being repudiated nearly
everywhere," he declared. "Hitherto
societies were divided into two classes,
those which had arrived at industrial
capitalism and those that had not yet
arrived."
Systems Bring Change
But all this is now changed by Iwo
great systems of "contagious ideas af
fecting all the world." Rowell de
scribed Ihese as Fascism, "which pre
served private ownership but not con
trol," and Communism, which has
abolished "private ownership of the
means of production."
Having described these alternative
courses of American politics, Rowell
said that the only way to escape them
was to vote the Republican ticket. Out
side of America (he rest of (he world
is either fascist or communist where
"every human liberty" is forbidden.
