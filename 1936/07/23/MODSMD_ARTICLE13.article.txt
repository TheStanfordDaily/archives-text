## Sword and Sandals Looks For New Talent 
### 
Tryouts for the third Sword and
Sandals group play reading will be
held in the Little Theater Monday af
ternoon, July 27, from 1 to 3. As the
third in a series of historical plays,
J. 13. Fagan's "And So To Bed" has
been chosen. The first of the group
was an ancient Greek tragedy, the sec
ond a verse tragedy of Jerusalem in
31 B.C.
This third play skips many centuries
to the time of the beloved diarist, Sam

gay comedy. Pepys, Mrs. Pepys, Mrs.
Knight, a famous singer of her day,
Mrs. Knapp, the actress that Pepys

Charles II himself are some of the
characters calling â€¢ for interpreters.
Reading experience is not required for
