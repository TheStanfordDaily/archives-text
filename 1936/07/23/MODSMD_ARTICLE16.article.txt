### Stephen Enke Presnell's Ghost 
"Things to Come" has top billing, J
and deservedly so, at the Stanford j
Theater this week. Alexander Korda |
of London Films is responsible for the j
production, H. G. Wells for the dia- j
logue and scenario, while to United j
Artists must go congratulations for
sponsoring this film in the United
States.
Some critics have described this
British film as a Buck Rogers spec
tacle. Nothing could be further from
the truth. While those of us who are
still mentally very young may have
noticed only the strange machinery
and the queer costumes, the more
mature must have come away with a
clearer meaning of the film's real im
port. As a cinematic satire of current
political leaders and philosophies
"Things To Come" is enjoyable. As
propaganda against war it should be
seen by everybody. As an antidote
against Hollywood's sedatives it comes
as a welcome relief.
There is no love affair in this film.
What emotional values there are con
cern social rather than individual in
terests. There is no young man vow
ing all the eternals to the girl of his
choice, but there is expressed, and
very clearly too for those who have
any insight, a necessary philosophy for
humanity. H. G. Wells has not turned
from the printing press to the silver
screen to merely portray an unim
portant love affair. For those who
must know what the story and hu
man interest are about I advise at
tendance.
If they can, Hollywood producers
should see this film and take its les
sons to heart. The use of suggestion,
the careful use of film editing to
change the tempo, the intelligent use
of sound, and the sparing use of dia
logue all strengthen the film. Subtle
I suggestion can afford a stronger stim
ulus, if it is well worked up, than all
the ranting and roaring of all our
stellar attractions put together.
I doubt if "Things To Come" will be
very successful in this country. Much
will be meaningless to those who are
unfamiliar with European conditions.
The audience quite obviously pre
ferred "Miss Nobody," which featured
Jane Withers. The man on my right,
who moved around uncomfortably all
through the showing of "Things To
Come," became happy again only after
Jane Withers had poured a pail of
water over somebody else. Whatever

your tastes, though, you'll like one of 1
the two films on this double bill, so J
the Stanford offers a good bet.

While I'm at it I'd like to protest ,
against the methods exhibitors are us- |
ing to increase attendance. If it isn't j
Bank Night it's Screeno or A Big New
"Beauty Winner" Dodge. Not only is |
one troubled by signing books and put- i
ting stubs into boxes, but also one has J
to sit through hundreds of feet of ad- i
vertising, on the culminating night !
and one must fight his way through
milling crowds of incurable optimists. I

The Sword and Sandals reading of
Phillips' "Herod" was presented Mon
day night under direction of Myna
Hughes. Extremely popular several
years ago, a large crowd came to wit
ness another production of the blank |
verse tragedy.
The outstanding readers were Mil- |
dred Maus as Mariamne and tied
Clark as Herod. Miss Maus knows
how to use her beautiful voice. She j
was consistent in her reading and pre
sented with understanding and feeling
the tragic figure of Herod's wife.
Clark has never read more smoothly,
although he inclined to use force for
emphasis to too great an extent.
Sohemus played, by George Z. Wil
son, although a small part, was pre- [
sented with sincere feeling. Wilson's
reading was exceptional in the scene
with Mariamne. William Gwinn,
played Gadias, and presented the char
acter with vigor and sincerity. Others
in the cast were Kay Seller, Jo Poor,
Barbara Harmon, Dick Lewis, Ed
Bode, and John Schidler.
The most notable criticism of the
reading was the spirited and har
monious quality. The next reading
will be "And So To Bed," a comedy
about the life of Samuel Pepys.

The Sword and Sandals reading of
Phillips' "Herod" was presented Mon
day night under direction of Myna
Hughes. Extremely popular several
years ago, a large crowd came to wit
ness another production of the blank |
verse tragedy.
The outstanding readers were Mil- |
dred Maus as Mariamne and tied
Clark as Herod. Miss Maus knows
how to use her beautiful voice. She j
was consistent in her reading and pre
sented with understanding and feeling
the tragic figure of Herod's wife.
Clark has never read more smoothly,
although he inclined to use force for
emphasis to too great an extent.
Sohemus played, by George Z. Wil
son, although a small part, was pre- [
sented with sincere feeling. Wilson's
reading was exceptional in the scene
with Mariamne. William Gwinn,
played Gadias, and presented the char
acter with vigor and sincerity. Others
in the cast were Kay Seller, Jo Poor,
Barbara Harmon, Dick Lewis, Ed
Bode, and John Schidler.
The most notable criticism of the
reading was the spirited and har
monious quality. The next reading
will be "And So To Bed," a comedy
about the life of Samuel Pepys.
"Things to Come" has top billing, J
and deservedly so, at the Stanford j
Theater this week. Alexander Korda |
of London Films is responsible for the j
production, H. G. Wells for the dia- j
logue and scenario, while to United j
Artists must go congratulations for
sponsoring this film in the United
States.
Some critics have described this
British film as a Buck Rogers spec
tacle. Nothing could be further from
the truth. While those of us who are
still mentally very young may have
noticed only the strange machinery
and the queer costumes, the more
mature must have come away with a
clearer meaning of the film's real im
port. As a cinematic satire of current
political leaders and philosophies
"Things To Come" is enjoyable. As
propaganda against war it should be
seen by everybody. As an antidote
against Hollywood's sedatives it comes
as a welcome relief.
There is no love affair in this film.
What emotional values there are con
cern social rather than individual in
terests. There is no young man vow
ing all the eternals to the girl of his
choice, but there is expressed, and
very clearly too for those who have
any insight, a necessary philosophy for
humanity. H. G. Wells has not turned
from the printing press to the silver
screen to merely portray an unim
portant love affair. For those who
must know what the story and hu
man interest are about I advise at
tendance.
If they can, Hollywood producers
should see this film and take its les
sons to heart. The use of suggestion,
the careful use of film editing to
change the tempo, the intelligent use
of sound, and the sparing use of dia
logue all strengthen the film. Subtle
I suggestion can afford a stronger stim
ulus, if it is well worked up, than all
the ranting and roaring of all our
stellar attractions put together.
I doubt if "Things To Come" will be
very successful in this country. Much
will be meaningless to those who are
unfamiliar with European conditions.
The audience quite obviously pre
ferred "Miss Nobody," which featured
Jane Withers. The man on my right,

about the life of Samuel Pepys.
"Things to Come" has top billing, J
and deservedly so, at the Stanford j
Theater this week. Alexander Korda |
of London Films is responsible for the j
production, H. G. Wells for the dia- j
logue and scenario, while to United j
Artists must go congratulations for
sponsoring this film in the United
States.
Some critics have described this
British film as a Buck Rogers spec
tacle. Nothing could be further from
the truth. While those of us who are
still mentally very young may have
noticed only the strange machinery
and the queer costumes, the more
mature must have come away with a
clearer meaning of the film's real im
port. As a cinematic satire of current
political leaders and philosophies
"Things To Come" is enjoyable. As
propaganda against war it should be
seen by everybody. As an antidote
against Hollywood's sedatives it comes
as a welcome relief.
There is no love affair in this film.
What emotional values there are con
cern social rather than individual in
terests. There is no young man vow
ing all the eternals to the girl of his
choice, but there is expressed, and
very clearly too for those who have
any insight, a necessary philosophy for
humanity. H. G. Wells has not turned
from the printing press to the silver
screen to merely portray an unim
portant love affair. For those who
must know what the story and hu
man interest are about I advise at
tendance.
If they can, Hollywood producers
should see this film and take its les
sons to heart. The use of suggestion,
the careful use of film editing to
change the tempo, the intelligent use
of sound, and the sparing use of dia
logue all strengthen the film. Subtle
I suggestion can afford a stronger stim
ulus, if it is well worked up, than all
the ranting and roaring of all our
stellar attractions put together.
I doubt if "Things To Come" will be
very successful in this country. Much
will be meaningless to those who are
unfamiliar with European conditions.
The audience quite obviously pre
ferred "Miss Nobody," which featured
Jane Withers. The man on my right,
who moved around uncomfortably all
through the showing of "Things To
Come," became happy again only after
Jane Withers had poured a pail of
water over somebody else. Whatever

your tastes, though, you'll like one of 1
the two films on this double bill, so J
the Stanford offers a good bet.

While I'm at it I'd like to protest ,
against the methods exhibitors are us- |
ing to increase attendance. If it isn't j
Bank Night it's Screeno or A Big New
"Beauty Winner" Dodge. Not only is |
one troubled by signing books and put- i
ting stubs into boxes, but also one has J
to sit through hundreds of feet of ad- i
vertising, on the culminating night !
and one must fight his way through
milling crowds of incurable optimists. I
Perhaps some day one will be able to (
see a show without having to partici
pate in a lottery.

By Presnell's Ghost

The Sword and Sandals reading of
Phillips' "Herod" was presented Mon
day night under direction of Myna
Hughes. Extremely popular several
years ago, a large crowd came to wit
ness another production of the blank |
verse tragedy.
The outstanding readers were Mil- |
dred Maus as Mariamne and tied
Clark as Herod. Miss Maus knows
how to use her beautiful voice. She j
was consistent in her reading and pre
sented with understanding and feeling
the tragic figure of Herod's wife.
Clark has never read more smoothly,
although he inclined to use force for
emphasis to too great an extent.
Sohemus played, by George Z. Wil
son, although a small part, was pre- [
sented with sincere feeling. Wilson's
reading was exceptional in the scene
with Mariamne. William Gwinn,
played Gadias, and presented the char
acter with vigor and sincerity. Others
in the cast were Kay Seller, Jo Poor,
Barbara Harmon, Dick Lewis, Ed
Bode, and John Schidler.
The most notable criticism of the
reading was the spirited and har
monious quality. The next reading
will be "And So To Bed," a comedy
about the life of Samuel Pepys.
