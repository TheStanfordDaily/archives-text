"To understand the dance of the j
Tudor period it is necessary to consider
some of the folk customs and primi- j
tive practices out of which it evolved,"
said Mrs. Ruth Radir in last night's
Tudor Lecture on "Dances of the Six- 1
teenth and Seventeenth Centuries."
"Dance, in so far as we know, has
existed as a medium of expression
the world over, in all ages," continued
Mrs. Radir. "In primitive societies!
whether in forest-clad England, Greece
before the age of the gods, or in j
Africa today, primitive man indulged i
in all sorts of rituals to mediate prac
tical control of his environment. The
essence of ritual is dance."
She said that the dances of the Tudor
period may be classified as country,
court, and spectacular dancing. The
first were jolly, lusty dances of uni- |
versal interest and great vitality.
After the lecture she had the au- I
dience participate in some of these
dances.
