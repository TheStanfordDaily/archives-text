The Editor, Sir:
The halls of the Union Dormitory
are being torn in a great upheaval by
hearty and vicious arguments about
the men of the campus.
Men may answer that this is not an j
argument, it is an institution, but in !
that respect they are again, as most
always, wrong.
For eons, women have found faults j
with men, yet accepted them, but this
criticism is forthcoming with just and
due need.
Gallantry, conventions, precedent â€” |

all are being brushed aside by sum
mer session men.
We refer to that age old custom of
sending either flowers or candy when
your fairer company receives a "lock
out."
To think that we are returning to a
cycle of cruel treatment and neglect,
while we suffer for what is due to your
misconception of time, is too much.
We, the women of Union dorm, do
ask that you, as true Stanford men,
recall and reconsider the tried and
true lockout observance.
Sincerely,
G. W.
