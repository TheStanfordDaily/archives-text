### Tro Harper 
Several years ago there came unto
the Stanford campus a terrible catas
trophe in the form of the demon fire.
While a triple-ply shift of stalwart
youth sat around shivering and peering
into the night for something that was
n't in front of them, suddenly the Big
Game bonfire which they had pledged
themselves to guard with their lives
burst into such a ruddy glow lhat many
of the watchers were led to believe
that the giant pyre might possibly be
on fire.
When dawn rolled around, as it has
a habit of doing, all that was left of
the Big Game bonfire was a rather
sizeable heap of ashes. No one knew
quite how that fire started, but no one
cared very much because a new one
was stuck up the next day and, any
way, the kids from over the bay got
licked shortly after.

Now in connection with all this, it
seems there is a certain famous scien
tist who was once upon a time a stu
dent at a certain school across the bay
which policy forbids mentioning out
loud.
The student, being an inventive sort
of a creech and a bain to his mother,
figured out a remarkable little scheme.
Since he was a great believer in time
bombs and other anarchistic methods
of having a little fun, this lad of ideas
figured out a pretty fair contraption
with wires, gadgets, chemicals, and ev
erything calculated to create a furore
among his not-too-good friends down
Palo Alto way. All by himself he did
this, mind you.
At last the great day arrived and
our friend of the fiend-mind got him
self a nice big barrel. Into the bottom
of said barrel he crammed his child of
a thousand dreams and over it all he
began pouring quantities of highly in
flammable tar until everything was just
dandy.
To load the barrel on his car and
swing down to the Stanford campus
was but the work of an hour or so.
Somewhere along Palm Drive he not
so-carelessly left the barrel with its
precious cargo in full view of the sab
otage-minded Roughs then cruising in
search of anything that migjit burn.

"My, my," said one little Rough.
"Look what I've found. Tar and ev
erything."
And so all the boys, clapping their
hands merrily, dashed back to deposit
said barrel on aforementioned pile,
which in turn deposited grief on the
Stanford campus, and joy in the heart
of our friend.
And that is how the bonfire came to
much misfortune" at the hands of the
Greek who bore gifts unto the hapless
Roughs. The moral of this story is,
"Never throw an ash can at your
grandma. She might throw it at you
someday."
