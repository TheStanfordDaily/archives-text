Examples of printing from earliest !
times to the present are shown in the !
exhibit of printing in the Stanford Li- i
brary.
Representing the very beginning of
printing as it is known are Japanese
Buddah texts and the first Chinese
books.
The art in Europe is illustrated by
an early edition printed by Koster. A
leaf from one of Caxton's books which
was printed in 1482 is also shown.
Many of the earliest specimens of the !
art are shown, including Mexican
books which were the first to be print
ed in America.
Because of the English monopoly on
the publishing of Bibles in English,
the first Bible to be printed in this
country was "John Eliot's Indian
Bible," in Indian language, which was i
printed in IfiG3. After the colonies re
volted the "Atkins Bible" was printed
in English, and a leaf from it is found
in the collection.
