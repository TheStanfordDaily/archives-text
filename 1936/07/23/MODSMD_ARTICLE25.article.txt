# Student Concert Rates Available
## Richard Bonelli, Baritone, Is Woodland Singer 
### 
Special student rates will again be
offered Stanford students for the
Woodland Concert at Hillsborough
next Sunday afternoon.
For this performance Willem Van
den Burg will step from his regular
chair as principal 'cellist of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra to the
podium to direct his 85 colleagues in a
program of representative scores by
master c«mposers.
Although still in his early thirties,
Van den Burg has already established
himself not only as a conductor of
technical skill, individuality and imag
ination, but a virtuoso of the 'cello
as well—in fact, he is admittedly one
of the most brilliant performers on
this noble instrument.
During the summer of 1935 he di
rected the Philadelphia Symphony
Orchestra in a series of notable con
certs at Robin Hood Dell near Phila
delphia while his conducting of the
San Francisco Symphony in one of its
last winter's concerts commanded the
highest praise from both the scribes
and the public.
Baritone Soloist
As an added treat in this program,
Richard Bonelli, one of America's tri
umvirate of great opera and concert
baritones, will be heard as soloist,
singing two operatic arias with which
his flame is widely identified. In the
first half of the program, Bonelli will
present Pierrot's "Tanzlied" from "Die
Tote Stadt' (The Dead City) by the
Viennese composer, Erich Wolfgang
Korngold. Following many successful
performances in the major European
opera houses, this opera was first pro
duced in the United States on Novem
ber 19, 1921, at the New York Metro
politan Opera House, serving to intro
duce the glamorous Viennese soprano,
Maria Jeritza, to the American public.
After the intermission, Bonelli will
sing the famous "Largo al Factotum"
from comic-opera, "The Bar
ber of Seville.
