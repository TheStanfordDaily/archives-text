# Campus Is Tourist Mecca

The Indianapolis Memorial Day
Speedway races have nothing on
Stanford University, this summer, in
attracting scores of out-of-state cars.
With temperatures still zooming in
the midwest, cool San Francisco shows
huge gains in tourist travel that un
failingly includes the Stanford campus
as part of the itinerary. Bus lines are
daily kept busy transporting vacation
ists whose first remark upon entering
the Quad is:
"Where is Hoover's home?"
The next important attraction is the
Memorial Church although local guides
have often been amused by tourists
who, standing outside looking at it,
come back to ask, "Where is the
church."
One guide relates the classical re
mark of an elderly lady who, having
been told of the Welton Stanford fin
ancial contributions for the Chair of
Psychical Research project, asked to be
shown the chair.
Such is the life of a campus guide.

This year with the increase in the num
ber of tourists a like increase has oc
curred in "dumb questions" asked.
With practically every state in the
Union, Canada, and a dozen foreign I
countries represented, 421,470 touring
motorists entered California the first
six months of 1936, a gain of 15 per
cent or 54,988 more than the same pe
riod in 1935. Particularly has North
ern California been the mecca of heat
worn tourists and predictions are that
new all-time high records may be es
tablished before the end of the year for \
this section and the entire state.
Central California, San Francisco, '
and the Bay Area gained 21.6 per cent
in the six months, 180,843 visitors com
ing directly to the northern section.
Surveys of incoming motor cars show
an average of more than 700 out-of
state cars arriving in San Francisco.
It is estimated there are nearly 2000
new arrivals in the city daily.
Southern California's gain over 1935
was 9304 less than the increase regis- j
tered in Northern California.
