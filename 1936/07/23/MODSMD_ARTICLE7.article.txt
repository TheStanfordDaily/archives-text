ogy, said when questioned about his
speech on "The Thoughtways of Con- I
temporary Society" which will be giv- j
en this evening at 7:30 o'clock in the

Old fashioned and antiquated ways

temporary scientific methods.
"Most people refuse to look at them
selves or their contemporaries except j
from a personal viewpoint, never in a I
detached, impersonal way. If they'
