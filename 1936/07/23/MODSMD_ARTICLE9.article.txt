# Practical Joke Code Formed
## 
### 
Besides the good five-cent cigar
that the world has so long need
ed, a code for practical jokers has
been hitherto lacking. Certain
elements in the physics and
chemistry departments at Stanford
yesterday found it necessary to
compile an honor code governing
their future pranks before the
life insurance companies involved
were forced to fold up.
Stanford could always squelch
its freshman "smart alecs," but
when the jokesters include such
dignitaries as visiting professors
it is another matter. At the point
when no one trusted anyone and
the Lowells spoke to neither the
Cabots nor God the following code
was adopted.
1. Any victim losing his temper
is out of the competition.
2. Any expenses involved in a
practical joke must be met by
the prankster and not the recipi
ent.
3. The jokes arc limited to only
the original competitors, and fam
ilies arc not to be either used as
methods of defense or revenge.
Each participant is allowed but
one family or equivalent.
4. Alliances are permissible.
