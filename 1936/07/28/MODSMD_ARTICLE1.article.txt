# Vivian Wall To Dance Tonight In Auditorium
## Noted American Dancer To Interpret Understanding Of Music, Drama, Arts 
### 
Miss Vivian Wall, San Francisco
dancer, will give a dance recital to
night at 8 o'clock in the Stanford
Assembly Hall.
Interprets Themes
Gifted in sculpture, music, and the
drama, Miss Wall applies her under
standing of these arts to her dance in
terpretations. Her themes are drawn
from man and nature, and they visual
ize her ideals of sound, emotion, and
color. An American dancer whose in
tensive training in the traditions of the
Russian, Italian, and French ballets
has served as a background for her
natural ability for creative expression,
Miss Wall has conceived a new style
of dancing which she has tei'med "im
pressionistic."
Looks to America
Some of the dances which she will
present to the Stanford audience she
recently presented in New York re
citals. "Grass" was written especially
for her by John Haussermann, who also
supplies ballets for de Basil's Russian
Ballet. The music for "Sunday Dance"
and "La Soiree" are her own compo
sitions, while "First Dance" is a carica
ture of her first dance in a children's
dancing school. All of the costumes
are her own creations.
Miss Wall has studied German, Rus
sian, French, and Italian methods in
the different dance schools of Europe.
In Dresden she was at the Hellarau
school with Delcrose, and in Paris with
Madame Gontschwara, Chatelet Thea
tre ballerina. Although she was
trained in these European schools, Miss
Wall is an American dancer who looks
to her own country for the expression
of her art.
Miss Wall danced here last in 1934.
Douglas Thompson will accompany her
on Tuesday night.
The program is as follows: "Grass"
(Haussermann); "Mood of Absence"
(Brahms); "First Dance" (Folk); "Pa
vanne for a Dead Princess" (Ravel);
"Sunday Dance" (Wall); "Melisande"
(Faure); "Dance of the Blessed Spir
its" (Gluck); and "La Soiree" (Wall).
