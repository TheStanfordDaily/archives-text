# Teachers Must Guide Children
## 
### 
"The future of guidance will be
largely teacher guidance. The most
successful guidance will be done in the
school," stated Dr. Olga Louise Bridg
man, prominent psychologist, in an in
terview.
Dr. Bridgman is director of the Divi
sion of Mental Hygiene of the Depart
ment of Public Health, a position which
she has held since 1918. Dr. Bridgman
also practiced as a physician for 13
years.
"Lots of teachers can do valuable
guidance work if they are sympathetic,
on friendly terms with the child, and
can get his point of view," Dr. Bridg
man continued. "It takes common
sense and an understanding of chil
dren."
Dr. Bridgman pointed out that teach
ers should be aware of simple, every
day problems and have a knowledge
of personality problems. Many of the
difficulties can be handled by the
teacher. The teacher should be able
to distinguish when the child's symp
toms are really dangerous and see that
the child receives help from the clinic.
Dr. Bridgman declared that much of
the guidance should be done with par
ents before the child reaches the
school. Many problems of the pre
school child could be removed with the
help and confidence of the parents.
Most of the cases which come to Dr.
Bridgman at the University of Cali
fornia Children's clinic are referred to
the clinic thi-ough principals and
school nurses. Affiliated with both the
University clinic and the Health De
partment, Dr. Bridgman's work also
extends into the juvenile court.
Dr. Bridgman mentioned that Shaf
fer's "Psychology of Adjustment" and
Kanncr's "Child Psychology" might
prove helpful to teachers wishing a
general treatment of the field.
