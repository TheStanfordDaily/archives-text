In spite of the fact that Dr. Charles j
A. Baylis is managing editor of "The 1
Symbolic Logic Journal" and can re
duce logic to complicated formulas, ®
he enjoys swimming, likes movies and
dramatic art. In fact, he's having a
good time at Stanford this summer, as 1
well as giving several courses in phi
losophy.
"What is Symbolic Logic?" inquired
the reporter, pretending to peer intel- j
ligently into the March edition of the j
journal.
j Symbolic Logic goes back some
j hundred years, but has developed par
j ticularly in the past 25 years. It arose '
| from two tendencies: (1) the attempt
j to mathematicize logic and find con
l cise symbols; (2) the attempt to logi
j cize mathematics. In 1910 Russell
j Whitehead wrote "Principia Mathe
; matica,' in which he demonstrated that
j mathematics can be derived from log- l
j ic," declared Dr. Baylis.
Dr. Baylis stated that Symbolic
j Logic will help mathematicians to un
| derstand the foundations of their
i mathematics and help philosophers to
I understand better the nature of logic
j and the immense variety of logical '

forms. In the past logic was limited to a
few subjects.
"Of course, it isn't known yet
whether this new logic will have ap
plications in sociology, education, etc.
It is believed that it will. With the dis
covery of all these new forms they
should be of value in sociology—in

charting man's views about moral and
ethical values," explained Dr. Baylis.
"Symbolic Logis has found forms of
logic that Aristotle never dreamed of."
In commenting upon social philoso
phy Dr. Baylis said, "Scientists had
better get together with the social sci
entists and work out a social philoso
phy—find out what is the matter with
the social world and what to do about
it."
"The development of an adequate!
philosophy is one of the greatest prob
lems we have to face today. We face
three very important problems which
are closely inter-related: (1) a choice
between dictatorship and democracy;
(2) a choice between war and peace;
(3) a selection of what economic sys
tem is desirable. We must secure a
more equitable distribution of income
than we have at present so that there
will be economic sufficiency and se
curity for everyone. We can only
maintain political democracy by main
taining an economic democracy," as
serted Dr. Baylis.
Dr. Baylis was instructor in philoso
phy at Brown University from 1927 to
1030 and acting assistant professor
there since 1930,

"Symbolic Logis has found forms of
logic that Aristotle never dreamed of."
In commenting upon social philoso
phy Dr. Baylis said, "Scientists had
better get together with the social sci
entists and work out a social philoso
phy—find out what is the matter with
the social world and what to do about
it."
"The development of an adequate!
philosophy is one of the greatest prob
lems we have to face today. We face
three very important problems which
are closely inter-related: (1) a choice
between dictatorship and democracy;
(2) a choice between war and peace;
(3) a selection of what economic sys
tem is desirable. We must secure a
more equitable distribution of income
than we have at present so that there
will be economic sufficiency and se
curity for everyone. We can only
maintain political democracy by main
taining an economic democracy," as
serted Dr. Baylis.

In spite of the fact that Dr. Charles j
A. Baylis is managing editor of "The 1
Symbolic Logic Journal" and can re
duce logic to complicated formulas, ®
he enjoys swimming, likes movies and

good time at Stanford this summer, as 1

losophy.
"What is Symbolic Logic?" inquired
the reporter, pretending to peer intel- j
ligently into the March edition of the j
journal.
j Symbolic Logic goes back some
j hundred years, but has developed par
j ticularly in the past 25 years. It arose '
| from two tendencies: (1) the attempt
j to mathematicize logic and find con
l cise symbols; (2) the attempt to logi
j cize mathematics. In 1910 Russell
j Whitehead wrote "Principia Mathe
; matica,' in which he demonstrated that
j mathematics can be derived from log- l
j ic," declared Dr. Baylis.
Dr. Baylis stated that Symbolic
j Logic will help mathematicians to un
| derstand the foundations of their
i mathematics and help philosophers to
I understand better the nature of logic
j and the immense variety of logical '

forms. In the past logic was limited to a
few subjects.
"Of course, it isn't known yet
whether this new logic will have ap
plications in sociology, education, etc.
It is believed that it will. With the dis
covery of all these new forms they
should be of value in sociology—in

charting man's views about moral and
ethical values," explained Dr. Baylis.
