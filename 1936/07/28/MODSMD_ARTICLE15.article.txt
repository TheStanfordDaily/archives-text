# New Deal Cost Attacked by Businessmen
## Administration Policies Hit By Trade Leaders As Obstacles to Recovery 
### 
''Three issues face American busi
ness this year: government expendi
ture of money at a rate tremendously
exceeding ability to pay, taxation with
which we must in the long run pay for
these expenditures, and increased gov
ernment regulation of business which
makes it more and more difficult for
free enterprise to make its way and
pay the bills of government."
In these words Harper Sibley, presi
dent of the United States Chamber of
Commerce, summarized the "issues
before American business" at the an
nual Western Conference for Com
merce and Trade Executives at a ban
quet in the Stanford Union last night
at the close of a busy day in which
more than 150 commercial secretaries
and executives participated.
Several Speakers
In the morning sessions of the con
ference James Mussatti declared that
federal "taxation will destroy us."
Thomas Nixon Carter, Harvard econ
omist, made a plea for the continuation
of the capitalistic system and for the
benefits it would bring to this country.
Ralph Bradford spoke on "Government
and Business."
"We believe that the American
system has standards that cannot be
approached anywhere else in the
world. We do not need more taxation
of business; if anything we need more
business to tax," said President Sibley.
Th ree things are necessary for the
continuation of the American system of
production which Mr. Sibley declared
to be the best method. They are "the
desire to create," "a reasonable expec
tation of profit" and "encouragement
from government."
Business Fearful
Pointing out that business is moving
forward toward full employment, Mr.
Sibley nevertheless said that "busi
ness men do not have confidence in the
future. They fear the unbalanced bud
get and future taxes. World conditions
—the disturbances in France and Spain
—cause them to hesitate. They are
afraid of regulation."
Yesterday's session was opened with
a joint meeting addressed by Mr. James
Mussatti, executive secretary of the
California Taxpayers' Association,
speaking on the topic "Whither Are
We Bound in Federal Taxation?" Mr.
Mussatti predicted that the current
Mid-West drought will cause relief ex
penditures to exceed their budget fig
ure by one-half to one billion dollars.
"We can't balance the budget by in
creasing revenues," he said. Reduc
tion of bureaucracy is the only solu
tion according to the speaker.
Pointing out that the public debt
was approximately 35 billions, that
half of this was in short term paper
rather than government bonds, and
that the banking system has absorbed
80 per cent of the paper, he asked,
"How long can the banks absorb five
out of every six dollars of the public
debt?" Mr. Mussatti's predicted the
government would turn to the cur
rency issue to solve its problems.
New Deal Attacked
Vigorously attacking the New Deal
and especially the social security bill,
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carter predicted
that "The election of 19.%, like that of
1896, will be a turning point." Dr. Carv
! er is professor emeritus of political
j economy at Harvard.
' In comparing the growth of radical
| panaceas in both periods, the econ
] omist declared that "after the defeat
of Bryanism of 1896, industry began to
pick up, the demand for labor to ex
pand, wages to rise, and farm prices
j to improve."
"The same will happen in 1936," he
i concluded. "If the subversive move
| ments of the New Deal are stopped."
Bradford Moderate
A prediction that government will
enter still further into the field of
business was made by Ralph Bradford
j of Washington, D.C., manager of the
j Commercial Organization Department
| of the United States £hamber of Com
merce.
[ "In my opinion," he said, "the ex-
I periments of which business men are i
now so afraid have not been forced
upon them solely as the result of rosy
dreams hatched in the minds of pink- '
cheeked brain trusters but as a re- ]
suit of the long continued expectation '

of business itself that government shall
rally to its defense every time—well,
I almost said everytime its competitors
get advantage of it."
"The type of experiment in govern
ment we have witnessed in the past
four years Ls not at an end. 1 do not
believe any political party can com
pletely resist the current of the times."
Other predictions made by the speak
er were: "After a lapse of a few years,
NRA may lift its head again. New types
of social legislation are sure to in
clude programs for a wider distribu
tion of profits.
"I, too," he concluded, "enjoy sail
ing on uncharted seas, as President
Roosevelt has said. So did Christopher
Columbus nearly 500 years ago. But
we should remember that Columbus,
after all, did not throw away his com
pass."

world. We do not need more taxation
of business; if anything we need more
business to tax," said President Sibley.
Th ree things are necessary for the
continuation of the American system of
production which Mr. Sibley declared
to be the best method. They are "the
desire to create," "a reasonable expec
tation of profit" and "encouragement
from government."
Business Fearful
Pointing out that business is moving
forward toward full employment, Mr.
Sibley nevertheless said that "busi
ness men do not have confidence in the
future. They fear the unbalanced bud
get and future taxes. World conditions
—the disturbances in France and Spain
—cause them to hesitate. They are
afraid of regulation."
Yesterday's session was opened with
a joint meeting addressed by Mr. James
Mussatti, executive secretary of the
California Taxpayers' Association,
speaking on the topic "Whither Are
We Bound in Federal Taxation?" Mr.
Mussatti predicted that the current
Mid-West drought will cause relief ex
penditures to exceed their budget fig
ure by one-half to one billion dollars.
"We can't balance the budget by in
creasing revenues," he said. Reduc
tion of bureaucracy is the only solu
tion according to the speaker.
Pointing out that the public debt
was approximately 35 billions, that
half of this was in short term paper
rather than government bonds, and
that the banking system has absorbed
80 per cent of the paper, he asked,
"How long can the banks absorb five
out of every six dollars of the public
debt?" Mr. Mussatti's predicted the
government would turn to the cur
rency issue to solve its problems.
New Deal Attacked
Vigorously attacking the New Deal
and especially the social security bill,
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carter predicted
that "The election of 19.%, like that of
1896, will be a turning point." Dr. Carv
! er is professor emeritus of political
j economy at Harvard.
' In comparing the growth of radical
| panaceas in both periods, the econ
] omist declared that "after the defeat
of Bryanism of 1896, industry began to
pick up, the demand for labor to ex
pand, wages to rise, and farm prices
j to improve."
"The same will happen in 1936," he
i concluded. "If the subversive move
| ments of the New Deal are stopped."
Bradford Moderate
A prediction that government will
enter still further into the field of
business was made by Ralph Bradford
j of Washington, D.C., manager of the
j Commercial Organization Department
| of the United States £hamber of Com
merce.
[ "In my opinion," he said, "the ex-
I periments of which business men are i
now so afraid have not been forced
upon them solely as the result of rosy
dreams hatched in the minds of pink- '
cheeked brain trusters but as a re- ]
suit of the long continued expectation '

of business itself that government shall
rally to its defense every time—well,
I almost said everytime its competitors
get advantage of it."
"The type of experiment in govern
ment we have witnessed in the past
four years Ls not at an end. 1 do not
believe any political party can com
pletely resist the current of the times."
Other predictions made by the speak
er were: "After a lapse of a few years,
NRA may lift its head again. New types
of social legislation are sure to in
clude programs for a wider distribu
tion of profits.
"I, too," he concluded, "enjoy sail
ing on uncharted seas, as President
Roosevelt has said. So did Christopher
Columbus nearly 500 years ago. But
we should remember that Columbus,
after all, did not throw away his com
pass."

tion of bureaucracy is the only solu
tion according to the speaker.
Pointing out that the public debt
was approximately 35 billions, that
half of this was in short term paper
rather than government bonds, and
that the banking system has absorbed
80 per cent of the paper, he asked,
"How long can the banks absorb five
out of every six dollars of the public
debt?" Mr. Mussatti's predicted the
government would turn to the cur
rency issue to solve its problems.
New Deal Attacked
Vigorously attacking the New Deal
and especially the social security bill,
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carter predicted
that "The election of 19.%, like that of
1896, will be a turning point." Dr. Carv
! er is professor emeritus of political
j economy at Harvard.
' In comparing the growth of radical
| panaceas in both periods, the econ
] omist declared that "after the defeat
of Bryanism of 1896, industry began to
pick up, the demand for labor to ex
pand, wages to rise, and farm prices
j to improve."
"The same will happen in 1936," he
i concluded. "If the subversive move
| ments of the New Deal are stopped."
Bradford Moderate
A prediction that government will
enter still further into the field of
business was made by Ralph Bradford
j of Washington, D.C., manager of the
j Commercial Organization Department
| of the United States £hamber of Com
merce.
[ "In my opinion," he said, "the ex-
I periments of which business men are i
now so afraid have not been forced
upon them solely as the result of rosy
dreams hatched in the minds of pink- '
cheeked brain trusters but as a re- ]
suit of the long continued expectation '

of business itself that government shall
rally to its defense every time—well,
I almost said everytime its competitors
get advantage of it."
"The type of experiment in govern
ment we have witnessed in the past
four years Ls not at an end. 1 do not
believe any political party can com
pletely resist the current of the times."
Other predictions made by the speak
er were: "After a lapse of a few years,
NRA may lift its head again. New types
of social legislation are sure to in
clude programs for a wider distribu
tion of profits.
"I, too," he concluded, "enjoy sail
ing on uncharted seas, as President
Roosevelt has said. So did Christopher
Columbus nearly 500 years ago. But
we should remember that Columbus,
after all, did not throw away his com
pass."

''Three issues face American busi
ness this year: government expendi
ture of money at a rate tremendously
exceeding ability to pay, taxation with
which we must in the long run pay for
these expenditures, and increased gov
ernment regulation of business which
makes it more and more difficult for
free enterprise to make its way and
pay the bills of government."
In these words Harper Sibley, presi
dent of the United States Chamber of
Commerce, summarized the "issues
before American business" at the an
nual Western Conference for Com
merce and Trade Executives at a ban
quet in the Stanford Union last night
at the close of a busy day in which
more than 150 commercial secretaries
and executives participated.

In the morning sessions of the con

to be the best method. They are "the
desire to create," "a reasonable expec

from government."
Business Fearful
Pointing out that business is moving
forward toward full employment, Mr.
Sibley nevertheless said that "busi
ness men do not have confidence in the
future. They fear the unbalanced bud
get and future taxes. World conditions
—the disturbances in France and Spain
—cause them to hesitate. They are
afraid of regulation."
Yesterday's session was opened with
a joint meeting addressed by Mr. James
Mussatti, executive secretary of the
California Taxpayers' Association,
speaking on the topic "Whither Are
We Bound in Federal Taxation?" Mr.
Mussatti predicted that the current
Mid-West drought will cause relief ex

"The same will happen in 1936," he
i concluded. "If the subversive move
| ments of the New Deal are stopped."
Bradford Moderate
A prediction that government will
enter still further into the field of
business was made by Ralph Bradford
j of Washington, D.C., manager of the
j Commercial Organization Department
| of the United States £hamber of Com
merce.
[ "In my opinion," he said, "the ex-
I periments of which business men are i
now so afraid have not been forced
upon them solely as the result of rosy
dreams hatched in the minds of pink- '
cheeked brain trusters but as a re- ]
suit of the long continued expectation '

of business itself that government shall
rally to its defense every time—well,
I almost said everytime its competitors
get advantage of it."
"The type of experiment in govern
ment we have witnessed in the past
four years Ls not at an end. 1 do not
believe any political party can com
pletely resist the current of the times."
Other predictions made by the speak
er were: "After a lapse of a few years,
NRA may lift its head again. New types
of social legislation are sure to in
clude programs for a wider distribu
tion of profits.
"I, too," he concluded, "enjoy sail
ing on uncharted seas, as President
Roosevelt has said. So did Christopher
Columbus nearly 500 years ago. But
we should remember that Columbus,
after all, did not throw away his com
pass."
