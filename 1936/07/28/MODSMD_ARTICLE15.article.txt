# New Deal Cost Attacked by Businessmen
## Administration Policies Hit By Trade Leaders As Obstacles to Recovery 
### 
''Three issues face American busi
ness this year: government expendi
ture of money at a rate tremendously
exceeding ability to pay, taxation with
which we must in the long run pay for
these expenditures, and increased gov
ernment regulation of business which
makes it more and more difficult for
free enterprise to make its way and
pay the bills of government."
In these words Harper Sibley, presi
dent of the United States Chamber of
Commerce, summarized the "issues
before American business" at the an
nual Western Conference for Com
merce and Trade Executives at a ban
quet in the Stanford Union last night
at the close of a busy day in which
more than 150 commercial secretaries
and executives participated.
Several Speakers
In the morning sessions of the con
ference James Mussatti declared that
federal "taxation will destroy us."
Thomas Nixon Carter, Harvard econ
omist, made a plea for the continuation
of the capitalistic system and for the
benefits it would bring to this country.
Ralph Bradford spoke on "Government
and Business."
"We believe that the American
system has standards that cannot be
approached anywhere else in the
world. We do not need more taxation
of business; if anything we need more
business to tax," said President Sibley.
Th ree things are necessary for the
continuation of the American system of
production which Mr. Sibley declared
to be the best method. They are "the
desire to create," "a reasonable expec
tation of profit" and "encouragement
from government."
Business Fearful
Pointing out that business is moving
forward toward full employment, Mr.
Sibley nevertheless said that "busi
ness men do not have confidence in the
future. They fear the unbalanced bud
get and future taxes. World conditions
—the disturbances in France and Spain
—cause them to hesitate. They are
afraid of regulation."
Yesterday's session was opened with
a joint meeting addressed by Mr. James
Mussatti, executive secretary of the
California Taxpayers' Association,
speaking on the topic "Whither Are
We Bound in Federal Taxation?" Mr.
Mussatti predicted that the current
Mid-West drought will cause relief ex
penditures to exceed their budget fig
ure by one-half to one billion dollars.
"We can't balance the budget by in
creasing revenues," he said. Reduc
tion of bureaucracy is the only solu
tion according to the speaker.
Pointing out that the public debt
was approximately 35 billions, that
half of this was in short term paper
rather than government bonds, and
that the banking system has absorbed
80 per cent of the paper, he asked,
"How long can the banks absorb five
out of every six dollars of the public
debt?" Mr. Mussatti's predicted the
government would turn to the cur
rency issue to solve its problems.
New Deal Attacked
Vigorously attacking the New Deal
and especially the social security bill,
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carter predicted
that "The election of 19.%, like that of
1896, will be a turning point." Dr. Carv
