# Dr. Carver Urges Business Freedom
## 
### 
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver of Har- f
vard, here for the business confer- '
ence, spoke yesterday morning to the j
assembled business men on- "Expand- I
ing the Social Frontier." He made his |
address in the dining hall of Lagunita j
Court. Dr. Carver, who is an emeri- (
tus professor of political economy, has
always been interested in public !
questions. Last year the Republicans
attempted to enlist him as an adviser, j
Although Dr. Carver dteclined, his
views are still sympathetic to the Re
publican cause. Excerpts from his
speech follow:
Our economic growth has depended j
on the expansion of frontiers. Down
to about the end of the nineteenth cen
tury it was the geographical frontier
that was expanding. During the nine
ties, that expansion began to slow
down. The free land that was good
for anything was about gone. The
railroads had been built into every
part of the agricultural domain to 1
carry the crops. Factories had been
built to supply equipment and build
ing materials for the new farms.
Then things seemed to come to a
stand-still, and we had the great de
pression of 1893-9 G. Men seemed at a
loss what to do next.
Previous Panaceas
Then we began to hear the same
kind of talk that we have been hear
ing since 1929. It was said that we
were at the end of an era, which was
true. We were at the end of the era
of geographical expansion. It was also
said that we must have a new social
order, which was not true as events
proved. Without changing the social
order, the country picked up after 1896
and from that date until the World
War the country had greater prosperity
than it had ever known.
Less radical people were saying that
the depression of the nineties was the
result of a scarcity of money and that
we must have inflation to get us out
I of the depression. That also was un
' true, as events proved. Without in
j flation the country recovered and en
tered upon the period of its greatest
j prosperity up to that time.
Causes of Immigration
After the menace of free silver and
J other subversive movements were
warded off by the election of 1896. in
dustry began to expand so rapidly as
to create the problem of where to find
workers enough to supply the demand.
The answer was found in wholesale
immigration. Immigrants began to
| come in larger numbers than they
had ever come—even when we had
free land to give away. They began
coming, not to get land, but to get jobs
| in the new industries that were sup
| plying new commodities to supply new
j wants. Had it not been for these vast
1 supplies of labor from other countries

there would have been a real labor,
shortage. This labor shortage would
have cured unemployment, raised
wages, and abolished mass poverty.
Fallacy Flayed
Those who persist in saying that the
wholesale importation of manual labor
increases the demand for labor should
use arithmetic and common sense. Let
us suppose that unskilled manual
workers buy and consume one-fourth
of all the products of farms and fac
tories, the other three-fourths being
consumed by skilled and professional
workers, farmers, business men, pen
sioners, etc. Then suppose that we im
port enough unskilled manual work
ers to increase the total of such work
ers by 25 per cent. That would only
increase the consumption of products
by 6V4 per cent. In other words, an
increase of 25 per cent in the supply
of unskilled manual labor would in
crease the demand for it by only 6'/4
per cent.
Let's hear no more silly talk about
immigration increasing the demand for
labor.
How did it happen that industry
picked up so amazingly after 1896?
There were plenty of people who were
saying then, as they are saying now,
that it couldn't be done. The old or
der was at an end, so far as they could
see.
The New Frontiers
The business of this country turned
to a new frontier — the frontiers of
new and unsatisfied wants. Mr. Ralph
E. Flanders has pointed this out very
sanely and constructively. He has
[ shown that industry can expand on this
' new social frontier as it once expanded
on the geographical frontier.
Other men, however, lacking his
constructive imagination, can't see
how it can be done. They are pro
j claiming that, from now on, there is no
| more room for expansion. Our task
j is to dole out jobs and business op-
I portunities, hold what we have, and
j take care of millions whom industry
i and agriculture can never again em
| Ploy.
These prophets of doom are just 40
[ years behind. All that they are saying
now was being said in the nineties,
but events gave them the lie. If in
| fiation and other subversive move
! ments can again be warded off as they
were in 1896, we shall see another out
j burst of prosperity as we saw then.
The new frontier of unsatisfied wants
is still before us, awaiting the initia
tive of free enterprise. There are
plenty of wants still unsatisfied, there
is plenty of land, labor, and capital to
] produce them, but something is lack
ing. As a chain is only as strong as
j its weakest link, so an industrial sys
tem is only as strong as its scarcest
factor.
The scarcest factor, just now, is en
terprise—the spirit that ventures out
on new productive undertaking. With
out this factor, the other factors of pro
duction are as useless as they would be
if enterprise were abundant, but labor,
land, or capital were lacking.
Administration Blamed
But why is enterprise scarce, rela
tively to the need for it. Not because
the American people have lost the ad
venturing spirit, but because there is
no confidence in our government as at
present administered. Instead of en
couraging the spirit of enterprise, there
is a tendency to make it the target for
attack whenever it becomes large
enough to be conspicuous. It is threat
ened with punitive taxes, discrimina-

Tory legislation, a vast multitude of i
executive and administrative orders, 11
the meaning of which the officers of ;
government do not themselves under- j
stand.
If the powers that be were half as I
anxious to help the unemployed as they
are to injure employers, we should be
getting somewhere. We should be en- ;
couraging enterprisers, both large and
small, to start new enterprises and ex
pand old ones. This would increase !
the demand for labor and cure unem
ployment.
Everyone knows, when he stops to
think, that unemployment will never j
be cured until business expands, that !
business can not expand except under
encouragement, and that the chief fac- j
tor in encouragement is confidence—
confidence that there will be no fur- !
ther tinkei'ing with our money, no
more punitive taxes, no reckless ex- [
travagance in government, no further
piling up of debts, no inciting of class
antagonisms, no further suppression of 1
free enterprise. If people will only j
stop to think about these things—and

vote as they think—we shall soon- be
on our way to a new prosperity, such
as we have not seen before.

| come in larger numbers than they
had ever come—even when we had
free land to give away. They began
coming, not to get land, but to get jobs
| in the new industries that were sup
| plying new commodities to supply new
j wants. Had it not been for these vast
1 supplies of labor from other countries

there would have been a real labor,
shortage. This labor shortage would
have cured unemployment, raised
wages, and abolished mass poverty.
Fallacy Flayed
Those who persist in saying that the
wholesale importation of manual labor
increases the demand for labor should
use arithmetic and common sense. Let
us suppose that unskilled manual
workers buy and consume one-fourth
of all the products of farms and fac
tories, the other three-fourths being
consumed by skilled and professional
workers, farmers, business men, pen
sioners, etc. Then suppose that we im
port enough unskilled manual work
ers to increase the total of such work
ers by 25 per cent. That would only
increase the consumption of products
by 6V4 per cent. In other words, an
increase of 25 per cent in the supply
of unskilled manual labor would in
crease the demand for it by only 6'/4
per cent.
Let's hear no more silly talk about
immigration increasing the demand for
labor.
How did it happen that industry
picked up so amazingly after 1896?
There were plenty of people who were
saying then, as they are saying now,
that it couldn't be done. The old or
der was at an end, so far as they could
see.
The New Frontiers
The business of this country turned
to a new frontier — the frontiers of
new and unsatisfied wants. Mr. Ralph
E. Flanders has pointed this out very
sanely and constructively. He has
[ shown that industry can expand on this
' new social frontier as it once expanded
on the geographical frontier.
Other men, however, lacking his
constructive imagination, can't see
how it can be done. They are pro
j claiming that, from now on, there is no
| more room for expansion. Our task
j is to dole out jobs and business op-
I portunities, hold what we have, and
j take care of millions whom industry
i and agriculture can never again em
| Ploy.
These prophets of doom are just 40
[ years behind. All that they are saying
now was being said in the nineties,
but events gave them the lie. If in
| fiation and other subversive move
! ments can again be warded off as they
were in 1896, we shall see another out
j burst of prosperity as we saw then.
The new frontier of unsatisfied wants
is still before us, awaiting the initia
tive of free enterprise. There are
plenty of wants still unsatisfied, there
is plenty of land, labor, and capital to
] produce them, but something is lack
ing. As a chain is only as strong as
j its weakest link, so an industrial sys
tem is only as strong as its scarcest
factor.
The scarcest factor, just now, is en
terprise—the spirit that ventures out
on new productive undertaking. With
out this factor, the other factors of pro
duction are as useless as they would be
if enterprise were abundant, but labor,
land, or capital were lacking.
Administration Blamed
But why is enterprise scarce, rela
tively to the need for it. Not because
the American people have lost the ad
venturing spirit, but because there is
no confidence in our government as at
present administered. Instead of en
couraging the spirit of enterprise, there
is a tendency to make it the target for
attack whenever it becomes large
enough to be conspicuous. It is threat
ened with punitive taxes, discrimina-

Tory legislation, a vast multitude of i
executive and administrative orders, 11
the meaning of which the officers of ;
government do not themselves under- j
stand.
If the powers that be were half as I
anxious to help the unemployed as they
are to injure employers, we should be
getting somewhere. We should be en- ;
couraging enterprisers, both large and
small, to start new enterprises and ex
pand old ones. This would increase !
the demand for labor and cure unem
ployment.
Everyone knows, when he stops to
think, that unemployment will never j
be cured until business expands, that !
business can not expand except under
encouragement, and that the chief fac- j
tor in encouragement is confidence—
confidence that there will be no fur- !
ther tinkei'ing with our money, no
more punitive taxes, no reckless ex- [
travagance in government, no further
piling up of debts, no inciting of class
antagonisms, no further suppression of 1
free enterprise. If people will only j
stop to think about these things—and

vote as they think—we shall soon- be
on our way to a new prosperity, such
as we have not seen before.
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver of Har- f
vard, here for the business confer- '

Court. Dr. Carver, who is an emeri- (
tus professor of political economy, has

questions. Last year the Republicans
attempted to enlist him as an adviser, j
Although Dr. Carver dteclined, his
views are still sympathetic to the Re
publican cause. Excerpts from his
speech follow:
Our economic growth has depended j
on the expansion of frontiers. Down
to about the end of the nineteenth cen
tury it was the geographical frontier
that was expanding. During the nine
ties, that expansion began to slow
down. The free land that was good
for anything was about gone. The
railroads had been built into every
part of the agricultural domain to 1
carry the crops. Factories had been
built to supply equipment and build
ing materials for the new farms.
Then things seemed to come to a
stand-still, and we had the great de
pression of 1893-9 G. Men seemed at a
loss what to do next.
Previous Panaceas
Then we began to hear the same
kind of talk that we have been hear
ing since 1929. It was said that we
were at the end of an era, which was
true. We were at the end of the era
of geographical expansion. It was also
said that we must have a new social
order, which was not true as events
proved. Without changing the social
order, the country picked up after 1896
and from that date until the World
War the country had greater prosperity
than it had ever known.
Less radical people were saying that
the depression of the nineties was the
result of a scarcity of money and that
we must have inflation to get us out
I of the depression. That also was un
' true, as events proved. Without in
j flation the country recovered and en
tered upon the period of its greatest
j prosperity up to that time.

The new frontier of unsatisfied wants
is still before us, awaiting the initia
tive of free enterprise. There are
plenty of wants still unsatisfied, there
is plenty of land, labor, and capital to
] produce them, but something is lack
ing. As a chain is only as strong as
j its weakest link, so an industrial sys
tem is only as strong as its scarcest
factor.
The scarcest factor, just now, is en
terprise—the spirit that ventures out
on new productive undertaking. With
out this factor, the other factors of pro
duction are as useless as they would be
if enterprise were abundant, but labor,
land, or capital were lacking.
Administration Blamed
But why is enterprise scarce, rela
tively to the need for it. Not because
the American people have lost the ad
venturing spirit, but because there is
no confidence in our government as at
present administered. Instead of en
couraging the spirit of enterprise, there
is a tendency to make it the target for
attack whenever it becomes large
enough to be conspicuous. It is threat
ened with punitive taxes, discrimina-

Tory legislation, a vast multitude of i
executive and administrative orders, 11
the meaning of which the officers of ;
government do not themselves under- j
stand.
If the powers that be were half as I
anxious to help the unemployed as they
are to injure employers, we should be
getting somewhere. We should be en- ;
couraging enterprisers, both large and
small, to start new enterprises and ex
pand old ones. This would increase !
the demand for labor and cure unem
ployment.
Everyone knows, when he stops to
think, that unemployment will never j
be cured until business expands, that !
business can not expand except under
encouragement, and that the chief fac- j
tor in encouragement is confidence—
confidence that there will be no fur- !
ther tinkei'ing with our money, no
more punitive taxes, no reckless ex- [
travagance in government, no further
piling up of debts, no inciting of class
antagonisms, no further suppression of 1
free enterprise. If people will only j
stop to think about these things—and

vote as they think—we shall soon- be
on our way to a new prosperity, such
as we have not seen before.
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver of Har- f
vard, here for the business confer- '
ence, spoke yesterday morning to the j
assembled business men on- "Expand- I
ing the Social Frontier." He made his |
address in the dining hall of Lagunita j
Court. Dr. Carver, who is an emeri- (
tus professor of political economy, has
always been interested in public !
questions. Last year the Republicans
attempted to enlist him as an adviser, j
Although Dr. Carver dteclined, his
views are still sympathetic to the Re
publican cause. Excerpts from his
speech follow:
Our economic growth has depended j
on the expansion of frontiers. Down
to about the end of the nineteenth cen
tury it was the geographical frontier
that was expanding. During the nine
ties, that expansion began to slow
down. The free land that was good
for anything was about gone. The
railroads had been built into every
part of the agricultural domain to 1
carry the crops. Factories had been
built to supply equipment and build
ing materials for the new farms.
Then things seemed to come to a
stand-still, and we had the great de
pression of 1893-9 G. Men seemed at a
loss what to do next.
Previous Panaceas
Then we began to hear the same
kind of talk that we have been hear
ing since 1929. It was said that we
were at the end of an era, which was
true. We were at the end of the era
of geographical expansion. It was also
said that we must have a new social
order, which was not true as events
proved. Without changing the social
order, the country picked up after 1896
and from that date until the World
War the country had greater prosperity
than it had ever known.
Less radical people were saying that
the depression of the nineties was the
result of a scarcity of money and that
we must have inflation to get us out
I of the depression. That also was un
' true, as events proved. Without in
j flation the country recovered and en
tered upon the period of its greatest
j prosperity up to that time.
Causes of Immigration
After the menace of free silver and
J other subversive movements were
warded off by the election of 1896. in
dustry began to expand so rapidly as
to create the problem of where to find
workers enough to supply the demand.
The answer was found in wholesale
immigration. Immigrants began to
| come in larger numbers than they
had ever come—even when we had
free land to give away. They began
coming, not to get land, but to get jobs
| in the new industries that were sup
| plying new commodities to supply new
j wants. Had it not been for these vast
1 supplies of labor from other countries

there would have been a real labor,
shortage. This labor shortage would
have cured unemployment, raised
wages, and abolished mass poverty.
Fallacy Flayed
Those who persist in saying that the
wholesale importation of manual labor
increases the demand for labor should
use arithmetic and common sense. Let
us suppose that unskilled manual
workers buy and consume one-fourth
of all the products of farms and fac
tories, the other three-fourths being
consumed by skilled and professional
workers, farmers, business men, pen
sioners, etc. Then suppose that we im
port enough unskilled manual work
ers to increase the total of such work
ers by 25 per cent. That would only
increase the consumption of products
by 6V4 per cent. In other words, an
increase of 25 per cent in the supply
of unskilled manual labor would in
crease the demand for it by only 6'/4
per cent.
Let's hear no more silly talk about
immigration increasing the demand for
labor.
How did it happen that industry
picked up so amazingly after 1896?
There were plenty of people who were
saying then, as they are saying now,
that it couldn't be done. The old or
der was at an end, so far as they could
see.
The New Frontiers
The business of this country turned
to a new frontier — the frontiers of
new and unsatisfied wants. Mr. Ralph
E. Flanders has pointed this out very
sanely and constructively. He has
[ shown that industry can expand on this
' new social frontier as it once expanded
on the geographical frontier.
Other men, however, lacking his
constructive imagination, can't see
how it can be done. They are pro
j claiming that, from now on, there is no
| more room for expansion. Our task
j is to dole out jobs and business op-
I portunities, hold what we have, and
j take care of millions whom industry
i and agriculture can never again em
| Ploy.
These prophets of doom are just 40
[ years behind. All that they are saying
now was being said in the nineties,
but events gave them the lie. If in

Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver of Har- f
vard, here for the business confer- '
ence, spoke yesterday morning to the j
assembled business men on- "Expand- I
ing the Social Frontier." He made his |
address in the dining hall of Lagunita j
Court. Dr. Carver, who is an emeri- (
tus professor of political economy, has
always been interested in public !
questions. Last year the Republicans
attempted to enlist him as an adviser, j
Although Dr. Carver dteclined, his
views are still sympathetic to the Re
publican cause. Excerpts from his
speech follow:
Our economic growth has depended j
on the expansion of frontiers. Down
to about the end of the nineteenth cen
tury it was the geographical frontier
that was expanding. During the nine
ties, that expansion began to slow
down. The free land that was good
for anything was about gone. The
railroads had been built into every
part of the agricultural domain to 1
carry the crops. Factories had been
built to supply equipment and build
ing materials for the new farms.
Then things seemed to come to a
stand-still, and we had the great de
pression of 1893-9 G. Men seemed at a
loss what to do next.
Previous Panaceas
Then we began to hear the same
kind of talk that we have been hear
ing since 1929. It was said that we
were at the end of an era, which was
true. We were at the end of the era
of geographical expansion. It was also
said that we must have a new social
order, which was not true as events
proved. Without changing the social
order, the country picked up after 1896
and from that date until the World
War the country had greater prosperity
than it had ever known.
Less radical people were saying that
the depression of the nineties was the
result of a scarcity of money and that
we must have inflation to get us out
I of the depression. That also was un
' true, as events proved. Without in
j flation the country recovered and en
tered upon the period of its greatest
j prosperity up to that time.
Causes of Immigration
After the menace of free silver and
J other subversive movements were
warded off by the election of 1896. in
dustry began to expand so rapidly as
to create the problem of where to find
workers enough to supply the demand.
The answer was found in wholesale
immigration. Immigrants began to
| come in larger numbers than they
had ever come—even when we had
free land to give away. They began
coming, not to get land, but to get jobs
| in the new industries that were sup
| plying new commodities to supply new
j wants. Had it not been for these vast
1 supplies of labor from other countries

there would have been a real labor,
shortage. This labor shortage would
have cured unemployment, raised
wages, and abolished mass poverty.
Fallacy Flayed
Those who persist in saying that the
wholesale importation of manual labor
increases the demand for labor should
use arithmetic and common sense. Let
us suppose that unskilled manual
workers buy and consume one-fourth
of all the products of farms and fac
tories, the other three-fourths being
consumed by skilled and professional
workers, farmers, business men, pen
sioners, etc. Then suppose that we im
port enough unskilled manual work
ers to increase the total of such work
ers by 25 per cent. That would only
increase the consumption of products
by 6V4 per cent. In other words, an
increase of 25 per cent in the supply
of unskilled manual labor would in
crease the demand for it by only 6'/4
per cent.
Let's hear no more silly talk about
immigration increasing the demand for
labor.
How did it happen that industry
picked up so amazingly after 1896?
There were plenty of people who were
saying then, as they are saying now,
that it couldn't be done. The old or
der was at an end, so far as they could
see.
The New Frontiers
The business of this country turned
to a new frontier — the frontiers of
new and unsatisfied wants. Mr. Ralph
E. Flanders has pointed this out very
sanely and constructively. He has
[ shown that industry can expand on this
' new social frontier as it once expanded
on the geographical frontier.
Other men, however, lacking his
constructive imagination, can't see
how it can be done. They are pro
j claiming that, from now on, there is no
| more room for expansion. Our task
j is to dole out jobs and business op-
I portunities, hold what we have, and
j take care of millions whom industry
i and agriculture can never again em
| Ploy.
These prophets of doom are just 40
[ years behind. All that they are saying
now was being said in the nineties,
but events gave them the lie. If in
| fiation and other subversive move
! ments can again be warded off as they
were in 1896, we shall see another out
j burst of prosperity as we saw then.
The new frontier of unsatisfied wants
is still before us, awaiting the initia
tive of free enterprise. There are
plenty of wants still unsatisfied, there
is plenty of land, labor, and capital to
] produce them, but something is lack
ing. As a chain is only as strong as
j its weakest link, so an industrial sys
tem is only as strong as its scarcest
factor.
The scarcest factor, just now, is en
terprise—the spirit that ventures out
on new productive undertaking. With
out this factor, the other factors of pro
duction are as useless as they would be
if enterprise were abundant, but labor,
land, or capital were lacking.
Administration Blamed
But why is enterprise scarce, rela
tively to the need for it. Not because
the American people have lost the ad
venturing spirit, but because there is
no confidence in our government as at
present administered. Instead of en
couraging the spirit of enterprise, there
is a tendency to make it the target for
attack whenever it becomes large
enough to be conspicuous. It is threat
ened with punitive taxes, discrimina-

Tory legislation, a vast multitude of i
executive and administrative orders, 11
the meaning of which the officers of ;
government do not themselves under- j
stand.
If the powers that be were half as I
anxious to help the unemployed as they
are to injure employers, we should be
getting somewhere. We should be en- ;
couraging enterprisers, both large and
small, to start new enterprises and ex
pand old ones. This would increase !
the demand for labor and cure unem
ployment.
Everyone knows, when he stops to
think, that unemployment will never j
be cured until business expands, that !
business can not expand except under
encouragement, and that the chief fac- j
tor in encouragement is confidence—
confidence that there will be no fur- !
ther tinkei'ing with our money, no
more punitive taxes, no reckless ex- [
travagance in government, no further
piling up of debts, no inciting of class
antagonisms, no further suppression of 1
free enterprise. If people will only j
stop to think about these things—and

vote as they think—we shall soon- be
on our way to a new prosperity, such
as we have not seen before.
