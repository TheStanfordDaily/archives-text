# Pro Arte Audience Charmed
## 
### Warren D. Allen 
The final concert of the Schubert t
cycle was played by the Pro Arte |
Quartet last Friday afternoon to an ,
enthusiastic audience which flowed
over to the cool patio of the Dance j
Studio. Listeners within forgot the
heat in the cool refreshment provided
in Schubert's melodies, faultlessly ;
played by the incomparable four —
Messrs. Onnou, Halleux, Prevost, and
Mass.
The program consisted of the Quar- !
tets in A minor and D minor, with the !
C minor Quartet movement by way of !
prelude. With many composers, the se- i
lection of three quartets in the minor
would mean monotony of mood. Not so i
with Schubert, however, for his char
acteristic alternative of major and
minor provide a perfect balance in this
respect. These three quartets are from
what might be called the center of
Schubert's most mature creative life. I
Quartet Charms
The depth of the quartet movement, (
the charm of the A minor and D minor,
with the famous song reminiscences in
both, will always make this program a
memorable one.
This year's cycle of Schubert music
has not been marked by the dramatic
climaxes of the Beethoven cycle of .
1934, or the excitement provided by ,
modern composers last year. But for j
the sheer delight which comes from j
revelling in lyric melody, this latest ,
gift to the musical life of Stanford has I
been one to be highly treasured in our
memories.
South Mountain Quartet Best
The greatest experience of the series :
was unquestionably the C major Quin
tet, played by the South Mountain
Quartet, with Mr. Maas, in the Memo
rial Church on June 19. The novelty,
so far as our summer concerts are
concerned, was provided by the en
sembles with Gunnar Johansen, pian
ist, notably the sparkling Forellen-
Quintet, at the second concert, and the
Winterreise song cycle, sung at the
third, by Lawrence Strauss.
The South Mountain Quartet proved
to be an institution of which America j
may well be proud, one worthy in
every way to appear with the veterans
from Brussels. The latter will soon be
celebrating their silver anniversary,
having played together since their con
servatory days together when they
were lads in their teens. It is to be '

hoped that Stanford may have the
honor of helping to celebrate that an
niversary and others as well.
Chamber Music Played
These festivals of chamber music so
generously provided by Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge are having wide
spread results. A new love and appre
ciation of this form must result, not
only in more concerts, but in more
chamber organizations, for private as
well as public enjoyment, and for
more new works written for these
groups which will be expressive of the
age in which we live.
Stanford's needs along this line ar«
becoming more urgent all the time. We
need not only such concerts as these
every summer, but also during the rest
of the year, for our undergraduates.
Among the latter are many who are
capable, so we also need a music
library for active student groups. And
we also need an addition to our faculty
for directing the playing, writing, and
analysis of chamber music. We should
provide library and instruction first,
so that if as and when a music build
ing is built, we shall have something to
put into it.
All thanks to Mrs. Coolidge for her
generous impetus to our musical life.

South Mountain Quartet Best
The greatest experience of the series :
was unquestionably the C major Quin
tet, played by the South Mountain
Quartet, with Mr. Maas, in the Memo
rial Church on June 19. The novelty,
so far as our summer concerts are
concerned, was provided by the en
sembles with Gunnar Johansen, pian
ist, notably the sparkling Forellen-
Quintet, at the second concert, and the
Winterreise song cycle, sung at the
third, by Lawrence Strauss.
The South Mountain Quartet proved
to be an institution of which America j
may well be proud, one worthy in
every way to appear with the veterans
from Brussels. The latter will soon be
celebrating their silver anniversary,
having played together since their con
servatory days together when they
were lads in their teens. It is to be '

hoped that Stanford may have the
honor of helping to celebrate that an
niversary and others as well.
Chamber Music Played
These festivals of chamber music so
generously provided by Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge are having wide
spread results. A new love and appre
ciation of this form must result, not
only in more concerts, but in more
chamber organizations, for private as
well as public enjoyment, and for
more new works written for these
groups which will be expressive of the
age in which we live.
Stanford's needs along this line ar«
becoming more urgent all the time. We
need not only such concerts as these
every summer, but also during the rest
of the year, for our undergraduates.
Among the latter are many who are
capable, so we also need a music
library for active student groups. And
we also need an addition to our faculty
for directing the playing, writing, and
analysis of chamber music. We should
provide library and instruction first,
so that if as and when a music build
ing is built, we shall have something to
put into it.
All thanks to Mrs. Coolidge for her
generous impetus to our musical life.
The final concert of the Schubert t
cycle was played by the Pro Arte |
Quartet last Friday afternoon to an ,
enthusiastic audience which flowed
over to the cool patio of the Dance j
Studio. Listeners within forgot the
heat in the cool refreshment provided
in Schubert's melodies, faultlessly ;
played by the incomparable four —
Messrs. Onnou, Halleux, Prevost, and
Mass.
The program consisted of the Quar- !
tets in A minor and D minor, with the !
C minor Quartet movement by way of !
prelude. With many composers, the se- i
lection of three quartets in the minor
would mean monotony of mood. Not so i
with Schubert, however, for his char
acteristic alternative of major and
minor provide a perfect balance in this
respect. These three quartets are from
what might be called the center of
Schubert's most mature creative life. I
Quartet Charms
The depth of the quartet movement, (
the charm of the A minor and D minor,
with the famous song reminiscences in
both, will always make this program a
memorable one.
This year's cycle of Schubert music
has not been marked by the dramatic
climaxes of the Beethoven cycle of .
1934, or the excitement provided by ,
modern composers last year. But for j
the sheer delight which comes from j
revelling in lyric melody, this latest ,
gift to the musical life of Stanford has I
been one to be highly treasured in our
memories.
