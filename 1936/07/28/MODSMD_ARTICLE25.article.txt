# Clokie Analyses British Policial Situation
## 
### 
England's Labour Party cannot suc
ceed Prime Minister Baldwin's Cab
inet, even if he were to resign because
of ill health or of direct defeat in par
liament, because labour has no ma
jority to maintain themselves. More
important, Labour has no outstanding
leader who would be trusted by the
electorate. This was the point stressed
by Mr. Hugh McDowall Clokie, as
sistant professor of political science at
Stanford, in his radio talk, "The Eng
lish Political Situation Today," broad
cast last night over station KGO.
Conservatives Sccure
"Mr. Baldwin continues in office and
consistently declares his intention of
so doing, in spite of the persistence of
rumors of his resignation," the speaker
declared. As for the immediate fu
ture of the Labour Party, he said,
"Only by an election can they secure
a majority, and if one were held they
cannot expect to win for the reason
that they have not determined wheth
er the Labour Party is merely a social
reform party or is a true Socialist
Party.
"The Labour Party had no leader in
(he last election, just as today the Re
publicans have no unquestioned
leader," Mr. Clokie continued. "The
situation in England is now what one
might have expected from the nature
of the previous election. The national
government has an enormous majority
—430 against the Labour Party's 150.
And this must stand until another
election is held—and only then at the
will of the Conservative leader."
Even though the Conservative lead
ers are in sympathy with conservatism,
they are not theoretically conservative
and they have not been able to pursue
an aggressive policy. Thus there have
followed a series of crises or failures
which have undermined confidence in
the national government.
"It is generally thought that the

government has proved particularly
weak in its foreign policy," Mr. Clokie
stated. Neither Sir Samuel Hoare nor
Captain Anthony Eden, foreign min
isters, proved very vigorous in sup
port of the League. The very moderate
sanctions which were adopted did not
prevent the ultimate victory of the
Italians. This fact was largely respon
sible for the government's first loss of
public confidence.
Mr. Clokie compared the British and
American governments during his
speech, naming them as two of the
leading democracies of the world. "The
most noted similarity between the two
countries' political systems is the ex
istence in each of two parties. It is
true that they bear different names in
the two countries—in England Con
servative and Labour instead of Re
publican and Democratic as here. But
the fact of having a two-party system
as the major factor in political affairs
puts them both in contrast to the mul
titudinous parties found in the other
democracies.
Systems Contrasted
"Yet to understand the political
systems of the two countries one
should realize that despite this funda
mental resemblance there are three es
sential differences between the English
and American systems," the speaker
continued. "In the first place, it should
be noted that instead of having nom
inating pai'ty conventions every four
years, the English parties hold annual
conferences. Having no presidential
candidates to designate, these confer
ences serve chiefly as agencies for
keeping the party platforms adjusted
to current issues and as a means of
keeping the party leaders in touch
with the opinions of the rank and
file."
The fact that the English system is of
the cabinet type is an important fac
tor in the political differences of the

two countries. Jn England there is no
separation of powers: the premier and
the executive heads sit in the legisla
ture. The general result of the prac
tice of having all party leaders in par
liament is to give unity and coherence
both to the majority party and to the
opposition party as well. "Constitu
tionally," Mr. Clokie explained, "it (
means that there is no executive
veto; and no clash between the ex
ecutive and legislature, for the cabinet
always has a majority in the House of
Commons."
The third major difference is that
parliament does not sit for a fixed '
term. There is a maximum period of
five years, but the cabinet can and al
ways does dissolve the parliament
earlier, choosing that time which
seems to them most propitious. "Im
agine if you can the results produced
if Mr. Roosevelt was able to threaten
Congress with an election at his will
and thus had no need to buy its sup
port with patronage," the speaker
added.
Parties Described
"Though England is always held up
as being the country in which there
are really two distinct parties with
clearly cut distinctions in policy, such
is not the case in fact. Conservative
and Labour are no more sharply di
vided than are Republicans and Dem
ocratic in this country," Professor i
Clokie stated in further comparing the
two countries' political systems.
The Labour Party is a party of so
cial reform—a movement of the work- 1
ers to better their positions in the ex
isting industrial system. On the other
hand, the Conservative Party is like
wise a party of social reform—though
it is the party of the wealthier classes
seeking popular support.
In emphasizing the overlapping of >
the two parties, he remarked that the
reformist policy of the national gov
ernment is not due to the presence of
some Labour and some Liberals in the
government. It is the accepted policy
of the Conservative majority which
supports the national government. I
"They pursue this policy partly out of I
conviction and partly because it is nec- J

essary in order to win votes," accord
ing to Clohie.
"In America it may be doubted if
Republicans would do anything dif
ferent from Democrats with respect to
CCC camps, public relief, tariffs, and
other federal aids to industry and agri
culture. So, in Britain today it may
well be doubted if Labour could do
anything seriously different from the

i national government. And in both
j countries the reason is the same: the
| parties do not dare to take too definite
a stand on principles regarding which
, the publics of the two countries have
i not yet made up their minds."
