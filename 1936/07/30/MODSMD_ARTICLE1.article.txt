### Sally Speers 
A busy publication season is the
prospect of the Stanford University
Press for the fall. That is the assump
tion based on the following list of
some of the forthcoming books, al
though the Press already has about
350 book titles on its list. Before men
tioning the future publications, Mr.
Stanley M. Croonquist, sales manager
of the University Press, commented on
the latest books to be published by the
Press.
'"Perspective," by Arthur Bridgman
Clark, emeritus professor of graphic
art at Stanford, is a textbook and man
ual for artists, architects, and students.
Illustrations and text are carefully co
ordinated to present the subject in a
simple, understandable mannei - . It
includes such subjects as interiors,
shades and shadows, horizons, and
landscape scales.
Law Book Published
Jackson H. Ralston is the author of
the other recently published book, "A
Supplement to Law and Procedure of
International Tribunals." This is a
supplement to a former book of Ral
ston's, published ten years ago, which
was an authority in the field of inter
national tribunals.
During the summer, Dr. David Har
ris, associate professor of history at
Stanford, will have his book, "Diplo
matic History of the Balkan Crisis,
1875-1878," published by the Press.
It is an exact study of the varied cur
rents of interest and events, maneuv
ers, and negotiations, serving as a case
histox-y of European diplomacy typical
of those nineteenth century relations
which form the background of the
World War.
"Twenty-six Lead Soldiers," by Mr.
Hartley E. Jackson, to be one of the
many fall publications, is a type man
ual for use in schools of journalism.
This book tells the prospective jour
nalist all he needs to know about
printing and engraving processes and
about printing machinery.
Chinese Drama Translated
Perhaps the most popular book, from
the standpoint of sales, will be "The
West Chamber," by Henry H. Hart of
the University of California. Mr.
Croonquist believes it will appeal to
al linterested in China as well as to
the students of the drama, because it
is a translation of one of the most
famous of old Chinese dramasâ€”first
written in the thirteenth century.
"Judging from the plot with its love
story and picture of conditions in
China, it might as well have been
written 20 years ago as 700 years ago,"
Mr. Croonquist added.
Mr. Hart has written a first brief
popular history of Chinese drama as
the introduction to this volume. Its
publication date is set for September.
"Joaquin Miller, Literary Frontiers
man," by Martin S. Peterson of the
University of Nebraska, is another vol
ume to be published in the late sum
mer or early fall. Mr. Croonquist
commented that "because of the many
stories and legends about Joaquin
Miller, there was a need for a biogra
phy in which the facts given were the
truth. There still remains enough of
the glamorous to make the book inter
esting reading. It also contains a crit
ical study of Miller's contribution to
American literature."
New Journal Printed
A new journal, the "Vocational Di
gest Review," will be added to the
Press list in the fall. It Ls planned for
guidance and for the counselors in high
schools and colleges.
"Between Pacific Tides" is the title
of a popular account of invertebrates
of the Pacific Coast which will also be
published in the fall. It will add an
other volume to the list of outdoor
books which includes, among others,
Dickey's "Familiar Birds of the Pa
cific Southwest," and Keep and Bai
ley's "West Coast Shells."
"A Study of Transients in California"
is listed among the many other books
which are slated for fall publication.
Its authors are William T. and Doro
thy E. Cross.
