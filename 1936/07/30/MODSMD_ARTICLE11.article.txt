# Business Girds To Fight for Recovery
## New Deal Actions Denounced during Conference of Trade Executives Here 
### 
Fear that government meddling with business through the medium of
competition, regulation, and the indirect interference of heavy taxation would
destroy the traditional American economy, was expressed during the week
by 15 speakers of the Western Conference for Commercial and Trade Exccu
tivs in session at Lagunita Court. Ways and means of combatting these tend
encies were discusscd by these speakers.

The conference will consider those i
economic-politico relationships that
are developing in our country and for
which there is a need for fair minded
and intelligent men. Notwithstanding
their special interests the assembled
business men are doing their best to
give these subjects such a considera
tion. Security legislation, the Consti
tution, and the possibilities of tax re
duction are all being discussed. The
policies of the New Deal are invoking
controversy.
| Several summaries of some of the
more important speeches follow.
"There must be a mass public opin
ion for economy in order to reduce
public expenditures," Mr. James Mu
satti told the Commercial and Trade
executives yesterday morning when
he spoke on "How Business Organ
izations can Successfully Undertake
Programs to Reduce Taxes."
Communities which want to progress
will have to increase their total out
let, he explained, because when popu
lation increases the cost of the admin
istration of that area necessarily in
creases. "A community should know
how great a tax burden it can carry in
relation to its assessed value, its
bonded debt, and its total income. The
responsibility for tax reduction lies on
the shoulders of the public officials,
but the public officials carry out the
policy which is established for him by
the votes and demands of the citizens."
Federal Confusion
Conflicts in the tax systems of the
federal government and its numerous
sub-departments number over 800, Mr.
Musatti pointed out. "If a tax is to be
useful it should be administered by
that part of the government which can
; administer it most beneficially for the
public in general." The speaker went
on to say that these conflicting tax
problems may be solved within 25 or
50 years, but that they are not apt to
be solved overnight.
Inadequate budgeting methods
cause another problem in tax expendi
tures, according to Mr. Musatti. "There
is too short a time between the pre-
I sentation and the adoption of the
j budgets—there is no chance for the
| citizens to study and investigate these
j budgets."
Uniform counting and reporting
was the third important factor men
tioned in the campaign to reduce pub
lic expenditures. The State Chamber
of Commerce, according to the speaker,
does have such a uniform system, but
on the whole good accounting systems
must be more widely developed. Such
an accounting system should include
the following:
First, the total amount expended by
political groups in order to enable the
citizens to determine the cost of gov
ernment on the basis of the functions
it performs, and consequently to con
trol the expenditures. Second, it
f should record the volume or quantity
' of service rendered by the government,
i devoid of financial expression. Third,
i it must list the unit costs in order to
| indicate how expensive the service of
j government actually is. Fourth, it
j should analyze the financial statement
i so that taxpayers can appraise the
quality of the services rendered by the
j government.
I Such an accounting system would
provide a yardstick of justification of
the expenditure of the taxpayers'
money, and "with ihe development of
yardsticks we can determine the social
value of the government expendi
tures."
"Every state should be on a cash
basis." is Mr. Musatti's firm belief.
Every state should be required to
spend as much money as it receives, or
as it has means of revenue to balance
the expenditure," he added.
Reforms Needed
"What can Chambers of Commerce
| and trade organizations do?" he asked.
| "First, every Chamber of Commerce
j and every other such trade organiza
; tion ought to have a committee on
| taxation to study and work on taxa
j (ion problems. Second, there should be
! a greater dissemination of tax informa
tion, because people don't know the
facts on taxation. Third, there ought
to be a creation of a citizens' commit
tee to look into taxation and expendi
ture—especially before budgets are
adopted. Fourth, every trade group

jught to have a committee interested
in taxation as it affects trade."
Mr. Mussatti is executive secretary
of the California Taxpayers' Associa
tion.
Following Mr. Mussatti's speech on
tax reduction Dr. T. N. Carver spoke
on "The Field for Public and Private
Enterprise." Paraphrasing for the
most part the stand of the Republican
party, with which he was recently af
filiated, the emeritus professor of
Harvard declared that "if government
goes into competition with private en
terprise the public gets no new product
and workers get no new jobs." He did
however, admit that certain goods and
services, the carrying out of which ne
cessitated compulsion, were rightfully
the task of government.
Principle Enumerated
"Let us give every man in this
country an opportunity to earn what he
is worth and to the man who cannot
earn his worth let us give charity: to
day we give social insurance to those
who will not or cannot earn their
worth," he said, referring to the gov
ernment relief expenditures.
America can rid itself of the unem
ployment problem if government with
draws from the field of private enter
prise and efficiently supplies all needed
goods and services that cannot be sup
plied by individuals and voluntary or
ganizations, asserted Dr. Carver. "Only
government officials," he stated, "can
coerce; if a product or a service can
not be supplied without coercion, gov
ernment is the sole agency that can
provide it."
"If your attitude was confined to an
insistence that you get your money's
worth then you could produce an add
ed utility with tax money which would
make life more worthwhile in your
respective states and communities," he
told the assembled trade executives.
Government's Ilole
On Tuesday, July 28, Dr. T. N.
Carver, emeritus professor of Harvard
University, spoke on "A Constructive
Government Program." He claimed
that "hampering the free spirit of a
great people is a destructive and not a
constructive . course. Should not the
government confine its coercive power
to suppress violence and fraud and
permit the full development of free
dom for men of peace and industry?"
he asked himself. He gave as an an
swer the suggestion "this might best be
done by permitting voluntary agree
ments and contracts among free citi
zens." Dr. Carver believes that such
contracts entered into voluntarily are
as effective as government enforce
ment can be. The Harvard professor
went out of hi* way to paint the glow
ing colors of capitalism. Branching into
politics, he said that one could always
get the dumb bell vote if one went out
after it. Dr. Carver looked forward to
a Republican victory in the coming
elections.

secretary of the California Taxpayers'
Association, Mr James Mussatti,

Mr. Mussatti is executive secretary
of the California Taxpayers' Associa
tion.
Following Mr. Mussatti's speech on
tax reduction Dr. T. N. Carver spoke
on "The Field for Public and Private
Enterprise." Paraphrasing for the
most part the stand of the Republican
party, with which he was recently af
filiated, the emeritus professor of
Harvard declared that "if government
goes into competition with private en
terprise the public gets no new product
and workers get no new jobs." He did
however, admit that certain goods and
services, the carrying out of which ne
cessitated compulsion, were rightfully
the task of government.
Principle Enumerated
"Let us give every man in this
country an opportunity to earn what he
is worth and to the man who cannot
earn his worth let us give charity: to
day we give social insurance to those
who will not or cannot earn their
worth," he said, referring to the gov
ernment relief expenditures.
America can rid itself of the unem
ployment problem if government with
draws from the field of private enter
prise and efficiently supplies all needed
goods and services that cannot be sup
plied by individuals and voluntary or
ganizations, asserted Dr. Carver. "Only
government officials," he stated, "can
coerce; if a product or a service can
not be supplied without coercion, gov
ernment is the sole agency that can
provide it."
"If your attitude was confined to an
insistence that you get your money's
worth then you could produce an add
ed utility with tax money which would
make life more worthwhile in your
respective states and communities," he
told the assembled trade executives.
Government's Ilole
On Tuesday, July 28, Dr. T. N.
Carver, emeritus professor of Harvard
University, spoke on "A Constructive
Government Program." He claimed
that "hampering the free spirit of a
great people is a destructive and not a
constructive . course. Should not the
government confine its coercive power
to suppress violence and fraud and
permit the full development of free
dom for men of peace and industry?"
he asked himself. He gave as an an
swer the suggestion "this might best be
done by permitting voluntary agree
ments and contracts among free citi
zens." Dr. Carver believes that such
contracts entered into voluntarily are
as effective as government enforce
ment can be. The Harvard professor
went out of hi* way to paint the glow
ing colors of capitalism. Branching into
politics, he said that one could always
get the dumb bell vote if one went out
after it. Dr. Carver looked forward to
a Republican victory in the coming
elections.
Mounting Taxes Seen
Prior to Dr. Carver, the executive
secretary of the California Taxpayers'
Association, Mr James Mussatti,
spoke on "Tax Problems of the West
ern Slates."
Fear that government meddling with business through the medium of
competition, regulation, and the indirect interference of heavy taxation would
destroy the traditional American economy, was expressed during the week
by 15 speakers of the Western Conference for Commercial and Trade Exccu
tivs in session at Lagunita Court. Ways and means of combatting these tend
encies were discusscd by these speakers.

The conference will consider those i
economic-politico relationships that
are developing in our country and for
which there is a need for fair minded
and intelligent men. Notwithstanding
their special interests the assembled
business men are doing their best to
give these subjects such a considera
tion. Security legislation, the Consti
tution, and the possibilities of tax re
duction are all being discussed. The
policies of the New Deal are invoking
controversy.
| Several summaries of some of the
more important speeches follow.
"There must be a mass public opin
ion for economy in order to reduce
public expenditures," Mr. James Mu
satti told the Commercial and Trade
executives yesterday morning when
he spoke on "How Business Organ
izations can Successfully Undertake
Programs to Reduce Taxes."
Communities which want to progress
will have to increase their total out
let, he explained, because when popu
lation increases the cost of the admin
istration of that area necessarily in
creases. "A community should know
how great a tax burden it can carry in
relation to its assessed value, its
bonded debt, and its total income. The
responsibility for tax reduction lies on
the shoulders of the public officials,
but the public officials carry out the
policy which is established for him by
the votes and demands of the citizens."
Federal Confusion
Conflicts in the tax systems of the
federal government and its numerous
sub-departments number over 800, Mr.
Musatti pointed out. "If a tax is to be
useful it should be administered by
that part of the government which can
; administer it most beneficially for the
public in general." The speaker went
on to say that these conflicting tax
problems may be solved within 25 or
50 years, but that they are not apt to
be solved overnight.
Inadequate budgeting methods
cause another problem in tax expendi
tures, according to Mr. Musatti. "There
is too short a time between the pre-
I sentation and the adoption of the
j budgets—there is no chance for the
| citizens to study and investigate these
j budgets."
Uniform counting and reporting
was the third important factor men
tioned in the campaign to reduce pub
lic expenditures. The State Chamber
of Commerce, according to the speaker,
does have such a uniform system, but
on the whole good accounting systems
must be more widely developed. Such
an accounting system should include
the following:
First, the total amount expended by
political groups in order to enable the
citizens to determine the cost of gov
ernment on the basis of the functions
it performs, and consequently to con
trol the expenditures. Second, it
f should record the volume or quantity
' of service rendered by the government,
i devoid of financial expression. Third,
i it must list the unit costs in order to
| indicate how expensive the service of
j government actually is. Fourth, it
j should analyze the financial statement
i so that taxpayers can appraise the
quality of the services rendered by the
j government.

Mounting Taxes Seen
Prior to Dr. Carver, the executive
secretary of the California Taxpayers'
Association, Mr James Mussatti,
spoke on "Tax Problems of the West
ern Slates."
Fear that government meddling with business through the medium of
competition, regulation, and the indirect interference of heavy taxation would
destroy the traditional American economy, was expressed during the week
by 15 speakers of the Western Conference for Commercial and Trade Exccu
tivs in session at Lagunita Court. Ways and means of combatting these tend
encies were discusscd by these speakers.

The conference will consider those i
economic-politico relationships that
are developing in our country and for
which there is a need for fair minded
and intelligent men. Notwithstanding
their special interests the assembled
business men are doing their best to
give these subjects such a considera
tion. Security legislation, the Consti
tution, and the possibilities of tax re
duction are all being discussed. The
policies of the New Deal are invoking
controversy.

more important speeches follow.
"There must be a mass public opin
ion for economy in order to reduce
public expenditures," Mr. James Mu
satti told the Commercial and Trade
executives yesterday morning when
he spoke on "How Business Organ
izations can Successfully Undertake
Programs to Reduce Taxes."
Communities which want to progress
will have to increase their total out
let, he explained, because when popu
lation increases the cost of the admin
istration of that area necessarily in
creases. "A community should know
how great a tax burden it can carry in
relation to its assessed value, its
bonded debt, and its total income. The
responsibility for tax reduction lies on
the shoulders of the public officials,
but the public officials carry out the
policy which is established for him by
the votes and demands of the citizens."
Federal Confusion
Conflicts in the tax systems of the
federal government and its numerous
sub-departments number over 800, Mr.
Musatti pointed out. "If a tax is to be
useful it should be administered by
that part of the government which can
; administer it most beneficially for the
public in general." The speaker went
on to say that these conflicting tax
problems may be solved within 25 or
50 years, but that they are not apt to
be solved overnight.
Inadequate budgeting methods
cause another problem in tax expendi
tures, according to Mr. Musatti. "There
is too short a time between the pre-
I sentation and the adoption of the
j budgets—there is no chance for the
| citizens to study and investigate these
j budgets."
Uniform counting and reporting
was the third important factor men
tioned in the campaign to reduce pub
lic expenditures. The State Chamber
of Commerce, according to the speaker,
does have such a uniform system, but
on the whole good accounting systems
must be more widely developed. Such
an accounting system should include
the following:
First, the total amount expended by
political groups in order to enable the
citizens to determine the cost of gov
ernment on the basis of the functions
it performs, and consequently to con
trol the expenditures. Second, it
f should record the volume or quantity
' of service rendered by the government,
i devoid of financial expression. Third,
i it must list the unit costs in order to
| indicate how expensive the service of
j government actually is. Fourth, it
j should analyze the financial statement
i so that taxpayers can appraise the
quality of the services rendered by the
j government.
I Such an accounting system would
provide a yardstick of justification of
the expenditure of the taxpayers'
money, and "with ihe development of
yardsticks we can determine the social
value of the government expendi
tures."
"Every state should be on a cash
basis." is Mr. Musatti's firm belief.
Every state should be required to
spend as much money as it receives, or
as it has means of revenue to balance
the expenditure," he added.
Reforms Needed
"What can Chambers of Commerce
| and trade organizations do?" he asked.
| "First, every Chamber of Commerce
j and every other such trade organiza
; tion ought to have a committee on
| taxation to study and work on taxa
j (ion problems. Second, there should be
! a greater dissemination of tax informa
tion, because people don't know the
facts on taxation. Third, there ought
to be a creation of a citizens' commit
tee to look into taxation and expendi
ture—especially before budgets are
adopted. Fourth, every trade group

jught to have a committee interested
in taxation as it affects trade."
Mr. Mussatti is executive secretary
of the California Taxpayers' Associa
tion.
Following Mr. Mussatti's speech on
tax reduction Dr. T. N. Carver spoke
on "The Field for Public and Private
Enterprise." Paraphrasing for the
most part the stand of the Republican
party, with which he was recently af
filiated, the emeritus professor of
Harvard declared that "if government
goes into competition with private en
terprise the public gets no new product
and workers get no new jobs." He did
however, admit that certain goods and
services, the carrying out of which ne
cessitated compulsion, were rightfully
the task of government.
Principle Enumerated
"Let us give every man in this
country an opportunity to earn what he
is worth and to the man who cannot
earn his worth let us give charity: to
day we give social insurance to those
who will not or cannot earn their
worth," he said, referring to the gov
ernment relief expenditures.
America can rid itself of the unem
ployment problem if government with
draws from the field of private enter
prise and efficiently supplies all needed
goods and services that cannot be sup
plied by individuals and voluntary or
ganizations, asserted Dr. Carver. "Only
government officials," he stated, "can
coerce; if a product or a service can
not be supplied without coercion, gov
ernment is the sole agency that can
provide it."
"If your attitude was confined to an
insistence that you get your money's
worth then you could produce an add
ed utility with tax money which would
make life more worthwhile in your
respective states and communities," he
told the assembled trade executives.
Government's Ilole
On Tuesday, July 28, Dr. T. N.
Carver, emeritus professor of Harvard
University, spoke on "A Constructive
Government Program." He claimed
that "hampering the free spirit of a
great people is a destructive and not a
constructive . course. Should not the
government confine its coercive power
to suppress violence and fraud and
permit the full development of free
dom for men of peace and industry?"
he asked himself. He gave as an an
swer the suggestion "this might best be
done by permitting voluntary agree
ments and contracts among free citi
zens." Dr. Carver believes that such
contracts entered into voluntarily are
as effective as government enforce
ment can be. The Harvard professor
went out of hi* way to paint the glow
ing colors of capitalism. Branching into
politics, he said that one could always
get the dumb bell vote if one went out

"What can Chambers of Commerce

tion, because people don't know the
facts on taxation. Third, there ought
to be a creation of a citizens' commit
tee to look into taxation and expendi
ture—especially before budgets are
adopted. Fourth, every trade group

jught to have a committee interested
in taxation as it affects trade."
Mr. Mussatti is executive secretary
of the California Taxpayers' Associa
tion.
Following Mr. Mussatti's speech on
tax reduction Dr. T. N. Carver spoke
on "The Field for Public and Private
Enterprise." Paraphrasing for the
most part the stand of the Republican
party, with which he was recently af
filiated, the emeritus professor of
Harvard declared that "if government
goes into competition with private en
terprise the public gets no new product
and workers get no new jobs." He did
however, admit that certain goods and
services, the carrying out of which ne
cessitated compulsion, were rightfully
the task of government.
Principle Enumerated
"Let us give every man in this
country an opportunity to earn what he
is worth and to the man who cannot
earn his worth let us give charity: to
day we give social insurance to those
who will not or cannot earn their
worth," he said, referring to the gov
ernment relief expenditures.
America can rid itself of the unem
ployment problem if government with
draws from the field of private enter
prise and efficiently supplies all needed
goods and services that cannot be sup
plied by individuals and voluntary or
ganizations, asserted Dr. Carver. "Only
government officials," he stated, "can
coerce; if a product or a service can
not be supplied without coercion, gov
ernment is the sole agency that can
provide it."
"If your attitude was confined to an
insistence that you get your money's
worth then you could produce an add
ed utility with tax money which would
make life more worthwhile in your
respective states and communities," he
told the assembled trade executives.
Government's Ilole
On Tuesday, July 28, Dr. T. N.
Carver, emeritus professor of Harvard
University, spoke on "A Constructive
Government Program." He claimed
that "hampering the free spirit of a
great people is a destructive and not a
constructive . course. Should not the
government confine its coercive power
to suppress violence and fraud and
permit the full development of free
dom for men of peace and industry?"
he asked himself. He gave as an an
swer the suggestion "this might best be
done by permitting voluntary agree
ments and contracts among free citi
zens." Dr. Carver believes that such
contracts entered into voluntarily are
as effective as government enforce
ment can be. The Harvard professor
went out of hi* way to paint the glow
ing colors of capitalism. Branching into
politics, he said that one could always
get the dumb bell vote if one went out
after it. Dr. Carver looked forward to
a Republican victory in the coming
elections.
Mounting Taxes Seen
Prior to Dr. Carver, the executive
secretary of the California Taxpayers'
Association, Mr James Mussatti,
spoke on "Tax Problems of the West
ern Slates."
Fear that government meddling with business through the medium of
competition, regulation, and the indirect interference of heavy taxation would
destroy the traditional American economy, was expressed during the week
by 15 speakers of the Western Conference for Commercial and Trade Exccu
tivs in session at Lagunita Court. Ways and means of combatting these tend
encies were discusscd by these speakers.

The conference will consider those i
economic-politico relationships that
are developing in our country and for
which there is a need for fair minded
and intelligent men. Notwithstanding
their special interests the assembled
business men are doing their best to
give these subjects such a considera
tion. Security legislation, the Consti
tution, and the possibilities of tax re
duction are all being discussed. The
policies of the New Deal are invoking
controversy.
| Several summaries of some of the
more important speeches follow.
"There must be a mass public opin
ion for economy in order to reduce
public expenditures," Mr. James Mu
satti told the Commercial and Trade
executives yesterday morning when
he spoke on "How Business Organ
izations can Successfully Undertake
Programs to Reduce Taxes."
Communities which want to progress
will have to increase their total out
let, he explained, because when popu
lation increases the cost of the admin
istration of that area necessarily in
creases. "A community should know
how great a tax burden it can carry in
relation to its assessed value, its
bonded debt, and its total income. The
responsibility for tax reduction lies on
the shoulders of the public officials,
but the public officials carry out the
policy which is established for him by
the votes and demands of the citizens."
Federal Confusion
Conflicts in the tax systems of the
federal government and its numerous
sub-departments number over 800, Mr.
Musatti pointed out. "If a tax is to be
useful it should be administered by
that part of the government which can
; administer it most beneficially for the
public in general." The speaker went
on to say that these conflicting tax
problems may be solved within 25 or
50 years, but that they are not apt to
be solved overnight.
Inadequate budgeting methods
cause another problem in tax expendi
tures, according to Mr. Musatti. "There
is too short a time between the pre-
I sentation and the adoption of the
j budgets—there is no chance for the
| citizens to study and investigate these
j budgets."
Uniform counting and reporting
was the third important factor men
tioned in the campaign to reduce pub
lic expenditures. The State Chamber
of Commerce, according to the speaker,
does have such a uniform system, but
on the whole good accounting systems
must be more widely developed. Such
an accounting system should include
the following:
First, the total amount expended by
political groups in order to enable the
citizens to determine the cost of gov
ernment on the basis of the functions
it performs, and consequently to con
trol the expenditures. Second, it
f should record the volume or quantity
' of service rendered by the government,
i devoid of financial expression. Third,
i it must list the unit costs in order to
| indicate how expensive the service of
j government actually is. Fourth, it
j should analyze the financial statement
