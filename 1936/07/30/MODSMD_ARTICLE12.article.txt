# Our Country 'Tis of Thee!

### James Yuan 
It had long been a dream of mine to
come to visit America when I was in
my own country. What are the won
ders of the New World? How do the
American people live in their colony?
It was hard to imagine the real facts
of America, although I had heard much
about the United States through my
Yankee friends in China. In my high
school days I learned from the Amer
ican history and geography, the stories
of the birth of a nation, the struggle of
its people, the territory stretching from
ocean to ocean, the Rocky Mountains,
the Mississippi River, the Golden Gate
and Lake Michigan. It was memorable
how these stories caught my attention
and urged me to visit the United
States. Having come from the other
side of the Pacific, my dream was re
alized; and I soon found it was really
worth coming for.
Golden Gate Impresses
My first impression of America was
received from the splendid appearance
of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge when I was entering the Golden
Gate several months ago. It was a
foggy morning and at first I could see
nothing but the huge bridge posts
standing in the water; and later I
found out there were beautiful scen
eries around the bay and city after the
heavy fog had cleared off. The view of
San Francisco from the harbor has ex
ceptional charm, and the world's long
est bridge rising on two sides of the
bay looked like a dragon sleeping on
the sea.
"So this is America!" I thought. "It
is almost unbelievable that it was only
the hunting ground of the Indians
three hundred years ago." Certainly, I
was surprised at the great success of
the bridge's construction work and de
lighted in knowing the latest progress
of the country.
City Life Interests
After staying in San Francisco about
half a year, I gradually became fa
miliar with the American city life.
Men and things in the United States,
I think, are always most interesting.
A typical American city contains
typical things and affords much inter
est to the foreign visitors. It gave me
a great pleasure to become acquainted
wiih some American friends in the city,
and from them I found out the dis
tinguished characteristics of their
people.
In San Francisco I spent many en

joyable hours visiting its world-famed |
places and beauty spots, and I feel
America's scenery is really unsur
passed. I was deeply impressed by the
morning scenes of the Pacific Ocean
and the bay bridge in a view from the
Lincoln Park; and particularly inter- ;
ested in the collections of art treas
ures, curios and historical pictures in
the De Young Museum and the Cali
fornia Palace of the Legion of Honor.
Likes Aquarium
Moreover, the beautiful fish in the
Steinhart Aquarium, the finest collec- ;
tion of animals in the Fleishhacker
Zoo, and the exhibition of the animal j
and bird life set in their natural sur
roundings in the Academy of Science j
are also things I have never seen else- i
where. Since the wonders in America I
are famous the world over, I think that |
I would be fortunate to have an oppor- I
tunity to travel throughout this j
country.
Finds Machines Fascinating
But America has something more to
be seen other than its landscape and
art collections. I find that the modern
metropolitan culture in the United
States marks the rapid development of
American industry. The people control
different machines for different kinds
of work with wonderful success; espe
cially the automatic machine used in I
offices, public places, and communica- j
tions. The automobile, the electricity, \
the telephone, the radio, the refrigera
tor, and all modern equipments bring
the people into a more comfortable
life. But at the same time I feel a
heavy mechanical atmosphere sur
rounding us.
On the highways and streets there
always is much traffic running from
early morning till ryght; most of the
travellers drive their automobiles as
fast as possible in order to save time.
It is wonderful and, when accident
happens it becomes terrible.
The American scientists are working
for the promotion of the public wel
fare. I think the lifeless machines
should no longer bother the living
people.
Enjoys American Humor
I like the Americans as they are
creators, inventors, explorers, and hu
morists. Although the highest "sky
scraper" is not high enough to reach
the moon as the people desire, the
heroism of Richard Byrd in exploring
the lands of the Arctic and Antarctic,
of Charles Lindberg in flying over the

Atlantic to Europe, and the most useful
inventions of Thomas Edison, are !
some of the glorious successes that |
every American should be proud of. j
The creative and inventive spirits of ,
of the American people are above
praise and worth copying, so I believe, i
Moreover, they have a lot of humorous
sense in their daily lives. They chew
gum, play golf, and tell jokes to each
other.
Charlie Chaplin and Will Rogers
have already built up a "world of fun" j
not only for the Yankees but also for
other peoples. This means, I think, to .
make the human world more colorful, '
active, and enjoyable.
America, of course, is too large a
country to record in such a small ar
ticle; and also too excellent a place for
the description with my poor English
writing. But I am enjoying the Cali
fornia's sunshine and feel at home this
time anyway. I hope I will become
more familiar with America and the
Americans in the years to come.
