Phil Brown comes through with the
story of the week this time. It ap
pears, from what Brother Brown was
telling me the other evening, that he
was up in San Francisco the other day
sitting quietly and unobtrusively at the
counter in a lunch room having a cup
of coffee for himself.
Sitting there juggling his coffee
about in his saucer, he was suddenly
aroused from his natatorial pursuits bys
sharp female giggles and looked up to
see two ladies and a gentleman eye
ing him curiously. Naturally when
they saw him watching them, they
turned away, embarrassed, but they
didn't stop talking.
Naturally Brother Brown was in
terested in what was going on and he
kept his ear peeled for any verbal ac
tion on their part.
All at once he jumped, somewhat
startled.
"Do you suppose that boy really j
has a wig on?" The undertone of one
of the voices had suddenly become an
overtone, with gestures.
By this time everyone was smiling
and looking at Brother Brown. Always
the thespian at heart, however, he ]
merely sat, paying no attention, and
planned. After paying his check, he
stood up and walked to where the trio
was sitting. For several seconds he
stood behind them. Laughter died in
laughing eyes as one of the ladies
turned around. Grabbing his hair with
both hands, Brother Brown began to I
pull with all high might, all the while i
bellowing in an exaggerated stage
voice:
"Now, my dear young friends, you i
can see for yourself my hair is no
wig!" With that, which seemed to be 1
enough, he left.

Larry Rouble told me he wanted to
get his name in the paper, so here it is.
Carl Abbott, finding the beds at the
Beta Eat and Sleep Club not very
much to his liking, journeyed to Palo
Alto t'other day to see what could be
done about it. He entered the first
furniture store in view and asked to see
the beds in stock. Although he was in
a hurry, he became very interested in
the fact that all the beds were very,
very small. After looking at beds for
the better part of an hour, he became
a little exaspex*ated.
"This is one of the very best we
have," said the clerk.
"Do you call that a good bed?" asked
Abbott.
"It's the very best we have, sir,"
said the clerk.
"Well, listen, pal, when I buy beds,
I want to buy one that isn't going to
get away from me the first time I go
to sleep."

kept his ear peeled for any verbal ac
tion on their part.
All at once he jumped, somewhat
startled.
"Do you suppose that boy really j
has a wig on?" The undertone of one
of the voices had suddenly become an
overtone, with gestures.
By this time everyone was smiling
and looking at Brother Brown. Always
the thespian at heart, however, he ]
merely sat, paying no attention, and
planned. After paying his check, he
stood up and walked to where the trio
was sitting. For several seconds he
stood behind them. Laughter died in
laughing eyes as one of the ladies
turned around. Grabbing his hair with
both hands, Brother Brown began to I
pull with all high might, all the while i
bellowing in an exaggerated stage
voice:
"Now, my dear young friends, you i
can see for yourself my hair is no
wig!" With that, which seemed to be 1
enough, he left.

Larry Rouble told me he wanted to
get his name in the paper, so here it is.
Carl Abbott, finding the beds at the
Beta Eat and Sleep Club not very
much to his liking, journeyed to Palo
Alto t'other day to see what could be
done about it. He entered the first
furniture store in view and asked to see
the beds in stock. Although he was in
a hurry, he became very interested in
the fact that all the beds were very,
very small. After looking at beds for
the better part of an hour, he became
a little exaspex*ated.
"This is one of the very best we
have," said the clerk.
"Do you call that a good bed?" asked
Abbott.
"It's the very best we have, sir,"
said the clerk.
"Well, listen, pal, when I buy beds,
I want to buy one that isn't going to
get away from me the first time I go
to sleep."
Phil Brown comes through with the
story of the week this time. It ap
pears, from what Brother Brown was
telling me the other evening, that he
was up in San Francisco the other day
sitting quietly and unobtrusively at the
counter in a lunch room having a cup
of coffee for himself.
Sitting there juggling his coffee
about in his saucer, he was suddenly
aroused from his natatorial pursuits bys
sharp female giggles and looked up to
see two ladies and a gentleman eye
ing him curiously. Naturally when
they saw him watching them, they
turned away, embarrassed, but they
didn't stop talking.

terested in what was going on and he
kept his ear peeled for any verbal ac
