# When Teachers Need a Friend

### One of Them 
The last strains of "Isn't It a
Lovely Day" died out. Two school
marms walked courageously up to
become initiated to their first
jolly-up. Too stiff-jointed to
dance, they overheard the follow
ing conversation between an ex
perienced Rough and a neophyte.
'"Yep, there's a jolly-up tech
nique. You've got to watch the
turn-over or you're sure to get
stuck with some dame. If she
circulates fast, she's O.K. Don't
risk her otherwise.
"Of course, there are two ways
out. Waltz her by the stag line
with your trickiest steps; and if
that doesn't work, carry on a
steady conversation as if she's a
knockout. The last resort is to
introduce her to a friend and take
the consequences later.
"At 5 minutes to 8 the stag line
will close in. Any fellow can take
a chance then for you can only
get stuck for five minutes."
At exactly 7:55 the stag line did
close in, but the school marms
had departed with Stanford's
unique dating bureau.
