# Cleopatra Billed Tops at Library
## 
### David Brown 
One of the latest productions of "An
tony and Cleopatra," and certainly one
of the most celebrated, was the James
Thurber opus which darkened the
pages of "Stage" some months ago.
Realizing this, the directors of the
Course in Stage Classics Production
will include it in the exhibit of works
relating to "Cleopatra, in History, in
Fiction, and on Stage," to open in the
Stanford Library on August 1.
Not that Thurber isn't perfectly able
to stand alone, on paper at least, there
will be other documents and records
on view revealing the original queen as
she was, as it is hoped she was, as it is
hoped she wasn't, and as she most
likely wasn't. The exhibit will show
you as well as the Freudian product
of Thurber, "the wicked enchantress"
of the 19th century stage, the '-'as
you like her" woman of Shakespeare,
right through to the "cooing household
dove" of Dryden.
Sandoe Delves
For most of us the exhibit is still
something to look forward to during
the next couple of days, but it has be
gun and almost ended for Mr. James
Sandoe, who is collecting a good deal of
material for it. Mr. Sandoe, by the
way. is the same Mr. Sandoe who is
directing Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo
patra" for campus production on the
evening of August 14 and for a matinee
performance on August 15. You can be
sure that the Shavian "Cleopatra," is
in many ways the most delightful, and
certainly the most human, of all.
I met Mr. Sandoe yesterday, digging
the literary remnants of "Cleopatra"
from the Stanford library stacks. It.
seemed inappropriate for the Queen to
rest "in this unseemly place," finally.
And it is a final rest that comes to
things in the library stacks, except, of
course, when gentlemen like Mr. San
doe conduct an excavation and, in this
case, come to the rescue of a queen.
Mr. Sandoe confesses that there is no
trick to finding material about "Cleo
patra." There is a particularly rich
collection of works about her and the
task is one of discrimination and se
lection. There is much more material
than could possibly be used.
Theme Necessary
In gathering any material for an ex
hibition first there must be a central
theme. Whether it be a "Century of
Progress" or, as in this case, "Cleo

patra, in History, in Fiction, and on the
Stage," the material must be collected
that is relevant to that theme.
When a woman is talked about, as
"Cleopatra" undoubtedly v/as, a "his
tory" evolves. First it is a history with
quote marks around it (those nasty
bits of punctuation with which we
sublimate our prigishness) then as
scandal turns into legend and scholars
take the place of suitors it becomes
just history.
This exhibit of ours will begin with
the sources which Shakespeare drew
his characterization from, such as Plu
tarch. You must realize that Shake
speare was somewhat late with his
"Cleopatra." In his own land Samuel
Daniels and Mary Sydney, Countess of
Pembroke preceded him. Then he no
doubt took some hints from Appian,
the Roman historian, according to Mr.
Sandoe.
Cleopatra Popular
The enormous collection of material
about "Cleopatra" clearly indicates that
after people stopped talking about her !
they did plenty of writing about her. i
Verse plays, novels, biographies, and j
histories are available and will be on j
display, Mr. Sandoe told me.
Also to be on exhibit will be the pro- j
gram of the David Garrick revival of
"Antony and Cleopatra" in 1780 at the
Drury Lane in London. This historic i
program has been borrowed from the
Huntington Library in Pasadena.
There have been relatively few pro
ductions of "Antony and Cleopatra." !
The difficulty of staging it was one rea- 1
son. In the 19th century the play was |
shunned but respected. The salacious
part of London saw a few private per
formances of the play, however.
On Stage
The latest production on the stage ,
was last week when "Antony and j
Cleopatra" was produced at the Pasa
dena Community Playhouse. The last
professional production goes back to
1925 when Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters
did it on Broadway. Incidentally, pho
tographs of Miss Cowl in this produc
tion will be on display. Miss Cowl gra
ciously forwarded them to Dr. Bailey,
executive director of the Course in
Stage Classics Production, which is
sponsoring the exhibit. Two years ago
the play was produced in England by
both a London company and by the
Stratford-on-Avon players.
The exhibit will have on hand many

pictures of the productions of this play.
If you want to see costume plates, de
signs, stage models, and the settings in
miniature which will be used at the
Stanford productions of "Antony and
Cleopatra" and "Caesar and Cleo
patra," many of which were made by
Stanford students in the stage design
and costume classes, go over to the Art
Gallery, which'will have a theater dis
play exhibit at the same time as the
library exhibit.
Meanwhile, preparations are being
made for the next American produc
tion of "Antony and Cleopatra" and
"Caesar and Cleopatra" which, on Au
gust 13, 14, and 15, will bring the As
sembly Hall phase of Stanford dra
matics to what, we suspect, will be a
delightful and, as far as the Assembly
Hall is concerned, a joyous end.

Huntington Library in Pasadena.
There have been relatively few pro
ductions of "Antony and Cleopatra." !
The difficulty of staging it was one rea- 1
son. In the 19th century the play was |
shunned but respected. The salacious
part of London saw a few private per
formances of the play, however.
On Stage
The latest production on the stage ,
was last week when "Antony and j
Cleopatra" was produced at the Pasa
dena Community Playhouse. The last
professional production goes back to
1925 when Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters
did it on Broadway. Incidentally, pho
tographs of Miss Cowl in this produc
tion will be on display. Miss Cowl gra
ciously forwarded them to Dr. Bailey,
executive director of the Course in
Stage Classics Production, which is
sponsoring the exhibit. Two years ago
the play was produced in England by
both a London company and by the
Stratford-on-Avon players.
The exhibit will have on hand many

pictures of the productions of this play.
If you want to see costume plates, de
signs, stage models, and the settings in
miniature which will be used at the
Stanford productions of "Antony and
Cleopatra" and "Caesar and Cleo
patra," many of which were made by
Stanford students in the stage design
and costume classes, go over to the Art
Gallery, which'will have a theater dis
play exhibit at the same time as the
library exhibit.
Meanwhile, preparations are being
made for the next American produc
tion of "Antony and Cleopatra" and
"Caesar and Cleopatra" which, on Au
gust 13, 14, and 15, will bring the As
sembly Hall phase of Stanford dra
matics to what, we suspect, will be a
delightful and, as far as the Assembly
Hall is concerned, a joyous end.
One of the latest productions of "An
tony and Cleopatra," and certainly one
of the most celebrated, was the James
Thurber opus which darkened the
pages of "Stage" some months ago.
Realizing this, the directors of the
Course in Stage Classics Production
will include it in the exhibit of works
relating to "Cleopatra, in History, in
Fiction, and on Stage," to open in the
Stanford Library on August 1.
Not that Thurber isn't perfectly able
to stand alone, on paper at least, there
will be other documents and records
on view revealing the original queen as
she was, as it is hoped she was, as it is
hoped she wasn't, and as she most
likely wasn't. The exhibit will show
you as well as the Freudian product
of Thurber, "the wicked enchantress"
of the 19th century stage, the '-'as
you like her" woman of Shakespeare,
right through to the "cooing household
dove" of Dryden.
Sandoe Delves
For most of us the exhibit is still
something to look forward to during
the next couple of days, but it has be
gun and almost ended for Mr. James
Sandoe, who is collecting a good deal of
material for it. Mr. Sandoe, by the
way. is the same Mr. Sandoe who is
directing Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo
patra" for campus production on the
evening of August 14 and for a matinee
performance on August 15. You can be
sure that the Shavian "Cleopatra," is
in many ways the most delightful, and
certainly the most human, of all.
I met Mr. Sandoe yesterday, digging
the literary remnants of "Cleopatra"
from the Stanford library stacks. It.
seemed inappropriate for the Queen to
rest "in this unseemly place," finally.
And it is a final rest that comes to
things in the library stacks, except, of
course, when gentlemen like Mr. San
doe conduct an excavation and, in this
case, come to the rescue of a queen.
Mr. Sandoe confesses that there is no
trick to finding material about "Cleo
patra." There is a particularly rich
collection of works about her and the
task is one of discrimination and se
lection. There is much more material
than could possibly be used.
Theme Necessary
In gathering any material for an ex
hibition first there must be a central
theme. Whether it be a "Century of
Progress" or, as in this case, "Cleo

patra, in History, in Fiction, and on the
Stage," the material must be collected
that is relevant to that theme.
When a woman is talked about, as
"Cleopatra" undoubtedly v/as, a "his
tory" evolves. First it is a history with
quote marks around it (those nasty
bits of punctuation with which we
sublimate our prigishness) then as
scandal turns into legend and scholars
take the place of suitors it becomes
just history.
This exhibit of ours will begin with
the sources which Shakespeare drew
his characterization from, such as Plu
tarch. You must realize that Shake
speare was somewhat late with his
"Cleopatra." In his own land Samuel
Daniels and Mary Sydney, Countess of
Pembroke preceded him. Then he no
doubt took some hints from Appian,
the Roman historian, according to Mr.
Sandoe.
Cleopatra Popular
The enormous collection of material
about "Cleopatra" clearly indicates that
after people stopped talking about her !
they did plenty of writing about her. i
Verse plays, novels, biographies, and j
histories are available and will be on j
display, Mr. Sandoe told me.
Also to be on exhibit will be the pro- j
gram of the David Garrick revival of
"Antony and Cleopatra" in 1780 at the
Drury Lane in London. This historic i
program has been borrowed from the
Huntington Library in Pasadena.

Mr. Sandoe confesses that there is no
trick to finding material about "Cleo
patra." There is a particularly rich
collection of works about her and the
task is one of discrimination and se
lection. There is much more material
than could possibly be used.
Theme Necessary
In gathering any material for an ex
hibition first there must be a central
theme. Whether it be a "Century of
Progress" or, as in this case, "Cleo

patra, in History, in Fiction, and on the
Stage," the material must be collected
that is relevant to that theme.
When a woman is talked about, as
"Cleopatra" undoubtedly v/as, a "his
tory" evolves. First it is a history with
quote marks around it (those nasty
bits of punctuation with which we
sublimate our prigishness) then as
scandal turns into legend and scholars
take the place of suitors it becomes
just history.
This exhibit of ours will begin with
the sources which Shakespeare drew
his characterization from, such as Plu
tarch. You must realize that Shake
speare was somewhat late with his
"Cleopatra." In his own land Samuel
Daniels and Mary Sydney, Countess of
Pembroke preceded him. Then he no
doubt took some hints from Appian,
the Roman historian, according to Mr.
Sandoe.
Cleopatra Popular
The enormous collection of material
about "Cleopatra" clearly indicates that
after people stopped talking about her !
they did plenty of writing about her. i
Verse plays, novels, biographies, and j
histories are available and will be on j
display, Mr. Sandoe told me.
Also to be on exhibit will be the pro- j
gram of the David Garrick revival of
"Antony and Cleopatra" in 1780 at the
Drury Lane in London. This historic i
program has been borrowed from the
Huntington Library in Pasadena.
There have been relatively few pro
ductions of "Antony and Cleopatra." !
The difficulty of staging it was one rea- 1
son. In the 19th century the play was |
shunned but respected. The salacious
part of London saw a few private per
formances of the play, however.
On Stage
The latest production on the stage ,
was last week when "Antony and j
Cleopatra" was produced at the Pasa
dena Community Playhouse. The last
professional production goes back to
1925 when Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters
did it on Broadway. Incidentally, pho
tographs of Miss Cowl in this produc
tion will be on display. Miss Cowl gra
ciously forwarded them to Dr. Bailey,
executive director of the Course in
Stage Classics Production, which is
sponsoring the exhibit. Two years ago
the play was produced in England by
both a London company and by the
Stratford-on-Avon players.
The exhibit will have on hand many

pictures of the productions of this play.
If you want to see costume plates, de
signs, stage models, and the settings in
miniature which will be used at the
Stanford productions of "Antony and
Cleopatra" and "Caesar and Cleo
patra," many of which were made by
Stanford students in the stage design
and costume classes, go over to the Art
Gallery, which'will have a theater dis
play exhibit at the same time as the
library exhibit.
Meanwhile, preparations are being
made for the next American produc
tion of "Antony and Cleopatra" and
"Caesar and Cleopatra" which, on Au
gust 13, 14, and 15, will bring the As
sembly Hall phase of Stanford dra
matics to what, we suspect, will be a
delightful and, as far as the Assembly
Hall is concerned, a joyous end.
One of the latest productions of "An
tony and Cleopatra," and certainly one
of the most celebrated, was the James
Thurber opus which darkened the
pages of "Stage" some months ago.
Realizing this, the directors of the
Course in Stage Classics Production
will include it in the exhibit of works
relating to "Cleopatra, in History, in
Fiction, and on Stage," to open in the
Stanford Library on August 1.
Not that Thurber isn't perfectly able
to stand alone, on paper at least, there
will be other documents and records
on view revealing the original queen as
she was, as it is hoped she was, as it is
hoped she wasn't, and as she most
likely wasn't. The exhibit will show
you as well as the Freudian product
of Thurber, "the wicked enchantress"
of the 19th century stage, the '-'as
you like her" woman of Shakespeare,
right through to the "cooing household
dove" of Dryden.
Sandoe Delves
For most of us the exhibit is still
something to look forward to during
the next couple of days, but it has be
gun and almost ended for Mr. James
Sandoe, who is collecting a good deal of
material for it. Mr. Sandoe, by the
way. is the same Mr. Sandoe who is
directing Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo
patra" for campus production on the
evening of August 14 and for a matinee
performance on August 15. You can be
sure that the Shavian "Cleopatra," is
in many ways the most delightful, and
certainly the most human, of all.
I met Mr. Sandoe yesterday, digging
the literary remnants of "Cleopatra"
from the Stanford library stacks. It.
seemed inappropriate for the Queen to
rest "in this unseemly place," finally.
And it is a final rest that comes to
things in the library stacks, except, of
course, when gentlemen like Mr. San
doe conduct an excavation and, in this
case, come to the rescue of a queen.
