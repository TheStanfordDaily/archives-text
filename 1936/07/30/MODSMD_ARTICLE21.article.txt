# Goossens to Conduct At Woodland Concert
## 
### 
For this and next Sunday's Wood
land Theatct" concerts, Mr. Eugene
Goossens as guest conductor of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
will present two programs of his own
orchestral arrangements.

Before coming to the United States,
Mr. Goossens was engaged by the late
George Eastman to conduct the Roch
ester Philharmonic Orchestra which,
under his tutelage, took its place among
one of the foremost symphony orches
tras in the country. Today he is con
ductor of the Cincinnati Symphony.

Goossen's very wide taste in music,
his masterly conduction of the classics,
his intimate knowledge of the orchestra
and everything concerning it — the
knowledge of an orchestra man and a
composer—his strong sympathies with
the moderns and his judgment con
cerning the value of works both an
cient and modern, are the elements
which distinguish his directorship.

Four hundred and nine people at
tended services at the Memorial
[ Church last Sunday morning.
