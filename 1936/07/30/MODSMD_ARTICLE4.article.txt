# New Curriculum Regime Needed
## Kaulfers Speaks at Texas Guidance Conference 
### 
"The detention of the masses in a
state of regimented intellectual peon
age, through the imposition upon the
many of academic students appropriate
only for the few, represents a method
of public education more compatible
with monarchism or fascism than with
democracy." This statement was made
by Dr. Walter V. Kaulfers, acting as
sistant professor of education, in his
speech on the "Curriculum Makers'
Responsibility for Guidance" at the
State Guidance Conference at Texas
Tech last Tuesday.
Culture DenyL-d Some
Dr. Kaulfers further stated that all
forms of "supercilious intellectual
snobbery" which lead to a denial to
the common man's child of the bene
fits of exposure to fields of culture
merely because he does not have the
time or ability to pursue them in terms
of a fixed, traditional routine, designed
for an entirely different generation of
students, are inconsistent with the
democratic tradition of American pub
lic education, and wholly out of keep
ing with the spirit of the times."
Enrollment Increased
In view of the fact that in some
communities the secondary school has
increased its enrollment 3000 per cent
an "entirely different dietary regime"
is needed.
"Through differentiation it has been
possible to place all offerings upon a
purely elective basis, for experience
has shown that whenever a variety of
courses, each charged with meaning
for the adolescent in terms of his ma
turity, is made available, pupils volun
tarily take more work in language and
arts than they could ever be persuaded
to take under the traditional plan," de
clared Dr. Kaulfers.
