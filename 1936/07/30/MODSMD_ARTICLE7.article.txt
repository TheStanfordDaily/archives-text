Let Facts be submitted to a
candid world:
Dear Editor:
In co-operation with the Palo
Alto Police Department, the
Board of Safety, the Palo Alto
Times, and the Stanford Daily,
the Varsity Theater is presenting
the picture "And Sudden Death"
over the week-end to help aid in
the local safety drive.
During the week preceding the
showing, Police Judge John E.
Springer is sentencing all those
caught for reckless driving to see
the picture, as a moral lesson.
