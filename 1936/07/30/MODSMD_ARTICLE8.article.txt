## 
### 
According to reports received here
yesterday, Vierling Kersey, state su
perintendent of public instruction,
charged that Stanford University, the
University of California and the Uni
versity of Southern California have
"fallen far short" of producing ade
quate training for school teachers. His
report to Governor Merriam said:
"While the universities of the state—
Stanford University, the University of
California and the University of South
ern California — which have trained
many of the men and women engaged
in secondary school teaching of the
state have made some improvements
in progress for the education of teach
ers, they have fallen far short of pro
viding the instruction needed by the
teachers in the modern school. The
people of the state have the right to
expect that these institutions eliminate
the barriers of traditional administra
tion and departmental organization of
instruction and develop the best teach
er educational programs their resources
make possible."
