# Dr. Bucher Studies Geology In Rockies
## Students, Professors Work On Mountain Formation Near Yellowstone Park 
### 
Between 40 and 50 geologists both
students and professors, co-operated
in the vicinity of the Big Horn
Basin in the Rocky Mountains during
the past six years in a concerted at
tempt to further the knowledge of
mountain formation. Among these men
was Dr. Walter Bucher from Cincin
nati who is teaching on the Stanford
faculty this summer.
For the better part of five years Dr.
Bucher has been exploring the region
east and northeast of Yellowstone
which comprised the Beartooth Moun
tains and Big Horn Basin. This re
gion was chosen because it exhibits in
relatively simple form the structural
characteristics of the folding which is
typical of the Rocky Mountain chains
in general.
Included in the group, which varied
from year to year, were representatives

from the geology departments of
Princeton, Chicago, Cincinnati, and a
number of other universities. The
project which has had liberal support
from the Geological Society of America
was organized by two Princeton men,
Drs. W. T. Thom and Richard M. Field.
"The purpose of the research," said
Dr. Bucher, "is to study geological his
tory of the region from all possible
angles with the view of getting a sat
isfactory insight into the mechanics of
the process by which mountain fold
ing of this type is brought about."
Many Formations
"The region comprises many forma
tions, some of peculiar interest. At one
place, for instance, the fossil leaves
were found stained brown and yellow
by iron rust deposited from the water
in the ground," continued Professor
Bucher. "An enthusiastic news re
porter in the crowd telegaphed back
to his paper that he and the geologists
had found fossil leaves with the fall
colors preserved.
"In another instance, near the top of
the conspicuous Beartooth Butte in the
Beartooth Mountains of Montana, a
remnant of what was once a valley
was found, now filled with red shale
and forming part of the mountain
block," said Bucher. "In the rock
which fills this old river channel an
extraordinary number of fish remains
were found, belonging to the earliest
and most primitive type of fish."
Detailed Studies Made
The study of the Big Horn Basin,
surrounded on three sides by moun
tains, forms an important part of the
investigation. Drs. Guttenberg and
Buwalda, two professors from Cali
fornia Institute of Technology, applied
modern seismic methods to its study.
The sediment-filled basin was shown
to have sunk twenty to thirty thousand
feet below the present surface of the
basin, while right next to it the ranges
were arched up some ten thousand
feet above it.
"Detailed studies of the field," says
Dr. Bucher, "are bringing out more
and more tell-tale facts from which it
is hoped that a real understanding of
the processes involved in the making
of the mountains and basins can be
obtained."
The study of the numerous volcanic
phenomena offers other fascinating
problems essential to the understand
ing of the region.
Overthrusts Arc Common
Dr. Bucher, in co-operation with a
number of other men, hav devoted a
special study to a remarkable group of
mountains of which Heart Mountain is
(he best known. They are remarkable
because they consist of thick masses of
old limestones which somehow have
been thrust on top of the younger rocks
of the basin. Such "overthrusting," as
geologists call it, is common enough in
intense regions of mountain making.
Heart Mountain and its allies, how
ever, can not have come into existence
in such a normal way. Their origin is,
in fact, highly mysterious. Whether
the mystery will ever be solved re
mains to be seen.

been thrust on top of the younger rocks
of the basin. Such "overthrusting," as
geologists call it, is common enough in
intense regions of mountain making.
Heart Mountain and its allies, how
ever, can not have come into existence
in such a normal way. Their origin is,
in fact, highly mysterious. Whether
the mystery will ever be solved re
mains to be seen.
Between 40 and 50 geologists both
students and professors, co-operated
in the vicinity of the Big Horn
Basin in the Rocky Mountains during
the past six years in a concerted at
tempt to further the knowledge of
mountain formation. Among these men
was Dr. Walter Bucher from Cincin
nati who is teaching on the Stanford
faculty this summer.
For the better part of five years Dr.
Bucher has been exploring the region
east and northeast of Yellowstone
which comprised the Beartooth Moun
tains and Big Horn Basin. This re
gion was chosen because it exhibits in
relatively simple form the structural
characteristics of the folding which is
typical of the Rocky Mountain chains
in general.
Included in the group, which varied
from year to year, were representatives

from the geology departments of
Princeton, Chicago, Cincinnati, and a
number of other universities. The
project which has had liberal support
from the Geological Society of America
was organized by two Princeton men,
Drs. W. T. Thom and Richard M. Field.
"The purpose of the research," said
Dr. Bucher, "is to study geological his
tory of the region from all possible
angles with the view of getting a sat
isfactory insight into the mechanics of
the process by which mountain fold
ing of this type is brought about."
Many Formations
"The region comprises many forma
tions, some of peculiar interest. At one
place, for instance, the fossil leaves
were found stained brown and yellow
by iron rust deposited from the water
in the ground," continued Professor
Bucher. "An enthusiastic news re
porter in the crowd telegaphed back
to his paper that he and the geologists
had found fossil leaves with the fall
colors preserved.
"In another instance, near the top of
the conspicuous Beartooth Butte in the
Beartooth Mountains of Montana, a
remnant of what was once a valley
was found, now filled with red shale
and forming part of the mountain
block," said Bucher. "In the rock
which fills this old river channel an
extraordinary number of fish remains
were found, belonging to the earliest
and most primitive type of fish."
Detailed Studies Made
The study of the Big Horn Basin,
surrounded on three sides by moun
tains, forms an important part of the
investigation. Drs. Guttenberg and
Buwalda, two professors from Cali
fornia Institute of Technology, applied
modern seismic methods to its study.
The sediment-filled basin was shown
to have sunk twenty to thirty thousand
feet below the present surface of the
basin, while right next to it the ranges
were arched up some ten thousand
feet above it.
"Detailed studies of the field," says
Dr. Bucher, "are bringing out more
and more tell-tale facts from which it
is hoped that a real understanding of
the processes involved in the making
of the mountains and basins can be
obtained."
The study of the numerous volcanic
phenomena offers other fascinating
problems essential to the understand
ing of the region.
Overthrusts Arc Common
Dr. Bucher, in co-operation with a
number of other men, hav devoted a
special study to a remarkable group of
mountains of which Heart Mountain is
(he best known. They are remarkable
because they consist of thick masses of
old limestones which somehow have
been thrust on top of the younger rocks
of the basin. Such "overthrusting," as
