# Chief Designer Of Bay Bridge Speaks Today
## Wood Lecture Arranged In Conjunction with Art Appreciation Courses 
### 
Mr. Howard C. Wood, chief design
ing engineer of the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge, will speak on
"Guiding Principles in the Construc
tion of the San Francisco Bay Bridge"
in the Assembly Hall tonight at 8
o'clock. Mr. Wood's lecture will be
richly illustrated with slides.
The lecture has been arranged in
conjunction with the "Art Apprecia
tion Course" in charge of Dr. Kurt
F. Reinhardt and Professor Edward
Farmer. In addition to the lecture,
students of the art class will make an
inspection tour to San Francisco and
study the bay bridge. Dr. Reinhardt
staled that as contemporary art it is
the outstanding symbol of this particu
lar region.
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge will be BV4 miles' long from the
end of the western approach to the
end of the eastern approach. In com
parative dimensions with the world's
largest bridges the Golden Gate Bridge
will be the longest in span and the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge the
longest in length of main structure in
the world. It will span the largest
major navigable body of water yet
bridged.
The western half will be in reality
two complete suspension bridges an
chored midway between San Francisco
and Yerba Buena Island to a concrete
center anchorage topped by a steel
shroud, rising 502 feet from the rock
under the floor of the bay. Automobile
entrances to the bridge will be a Fifth
Street between Harrison and Bryant.
