# Centralization Is Injected Into Campaign Issue
## Dr. Finla Crawford Talks On 'Centralization' At Thursday Night Lecture 
### 
"Today we find the issue of central
ization injected into political cam
paigns but it is too complicated to be
settled by saying no centralization or
complete centralization. Neither would
be a solution and .political campaigns,
unfortunately, are usually limited to a
consideration of matters which require
simple answers." Dr. Finla G. Craw
ford, acting professor of political sci
ence at Stanford, enlarged upon this
opinion duing his talk on "Centraliza
tion" which he gave last Thursday eve
ning in the Women's Clubhouse.
Divided Labor Is Necessary
Some division of labor between cen
tral and local authorities is a necessity
which is recognized by the most rabid
centra'izer as well as by the most vio
lent opponent of central administra
tion, Dr. Crawford averred. "From
an administrative point of view it
would be impossible to have all the
business of government concentrated
in Washington or Sacramento or in any
other state capital," he added.
To avoid excessive centralization,
some propose a reduction in govern
mental functions, but this is in conflict
with the moves of an age in which
governmental activity is constantly
expanding, according to Dr. Crawford's
views. Those who theoretically favor
such a decrease in governmental activ
ities are unwilling to make the decision
as to the activities which should be
eliminated.
System Complicated
"Our problem is to determine the
range of authority which shall be given
to governmental units. We are further
complicated by our three-level system
and are faced with the issue of allo
cating the functions of government to
these levels and of determining the
range of discretion which should be
granted to each."
Dr. Crawford continued by saying
that this question of centralization will
not be settled in a day or a decade be
cause its history is an old one and its
present manifestations are too compli
cated. The present trends in centrali
zation are developed by examining the
current situation in the federal-state,
the federal-local, and the state-local
areas.
Forty per cent of all the gasoline
consumed by motor vehicles is used by
trucks and buses.

with the moves of an age in which
governmental activity is constantly
expanding, according to Dr. Crawford's
views. Those who theoretically favor
such a decrease in governmental activ
ities are unwilling to make the decision
as to the activities which should be
eliminated.
System Complicated
"Our problem is to determine the
range of authority which shall be given
to governmental units. We are further
complicated by our three-level system
and are faced with the issue of allo
cating the functions of government to
these levels and of determining the
range of discretion which should be
granted to each."
Dr. Crawford continued by saying
that this question of centralization will
not be settled in a day or a decade be
cause its history is an old one and its
present manifestations are too compli
cated. The present trends in centrali
zation are developed by examining the
current situation in the federal-state,
the federal-local, and the state-local
areas.
Forty per cent of all the gasoline
consumed by motor vehicles is used by
trucks and buses.
