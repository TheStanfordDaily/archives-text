When I heard there was a half-man,
half-woman appearing nightly in one
of the San Francisco Market Street
sideshows, I dashed right up to see
him, or her, as the case may be. For
many years now, these heterogenous
characters have been almost a passion
with me.
Arriving on the scene of activity, I
elbowed my way through the maudlin
throng of morbid curiosity seekers to
feast my eyes on nature's strangest
phenomena. Thinking (s)he might
have something to offer to make the
front pages of the various papers in the
country, I engaged the dual personality
in conversation. Before we had gone
very far, however, (s)he advanced the
idea that I should tear a few pages
from its diary and quote them ver
batim. So here it is.
Monday—This business of being a
half-man, half-woman is beginning to
tell on my nerves. I find myself in a
terrible fix most of the time and it is
slowly driving me crazy. I am con
tinually being torn between two de
sires. This afternoon my better half
said, "Why don't we go down and try
on some new dresses?" Well, you know
how it affects a man when women are
trying on clothes right in front of his
eyes.
Tuesday—l am now beginning to
find I have no friends to speak of, or
to, for that matter. No one will come to
see my better half any more when I
have to sit right in the same room with
the two of them. Last night a fellow
came in to see my better half. He stuck
his head through the door all smiles at
first, then he started to yell at me.
"Hey, what's the idea sitting so close
to my girl?"
Then he got mad and left and my
better half got mad and tried to leave,
but I was stubborn so she had to sit
where she was. But it's the same
thing all over again when I have girls
over to the house to see me. Every
thing gets along fine until the fem
inine part of me starts to make cracks
about my girl. She gets jealous too
easy; that's her trouble. Anyway, when
she starts to make cracks, I suddenly
find myself without any friends.
Wednesday — Slept restlessly last
night. My better half says we would
be more comfortable if we bought twin
beds, but then that doesn't make sense.
Thursday—This morning I heard that
Mr. and Mrs. Brown, the couple my
better half and I used to run around
with, got a divorce because they were
jealous of each other. Now we have
no friends at all. Things are bad.
Friday—l wrote to the president to
day to ask him if he couldn't send me
another half-man, half-woman for a
companion. I feel that this is the only
possible solution to my troubles.

front pages of the various papers in the
country, I engaged the dual personality
in conversation. Before we had gone
very far, however, (s)he advanced the
idea that I should tear a few pages
from its diary and quote them ver
batim. So here it is.
Monday—This business of being a
half-man, half-woman is beginning to
tell on my nerves. I find myself in a
terrible fix most of the time and it is
slowly driving me crazy. I am con
tinually being torn between two de
sires. This afternoon my better half
said, "Why don't we go down and try
on some new dresses?" Well, you know
how it affects a man when women are
trying on clothes right in front of his
eyes.
Tuesday—l am now beginning to
find I have no friends to speak of, or
to, for that matter. No one will come to
see my better half any more when I
have to sit right in the same room with
the two of them. Last night a fellow
came in to see my better half. He stuck
his head through the door all smiles at
first, then he started to yell at me.
"Hey, what's the idea sitting so close
to my girl?"
Then he got mad and left and my
better half got mad and tried to leave,
but I was stubborn so she had to sit
where she was. But it's the same
thing all over again when I have girls
over to the house to see me. Every
thing gets along fine until the fem
inine part of me starts to make cracks
about my girl. She gets jealous too
easy; that's her trouble. Anyway, when
she starts to make cracks, I suddenly
find myself without any friends.
Wednesday — Slept restlessly last
night. My better half says we would
be more comfortable if we bought twin
beds, but then that doesn't make sense.
Thursday—This morning I heard that
Mr. and Mrs. Brown, the couple my
better half and I used to run around
with, got a divorce because they were
jealous of each other. Now we have
no friends at all. Things are bad.
Friday—l wrote to the president to
day to ask him if he couldn't send me
another half-man, half-woman for a
companion. I feel that this is the only
possible solution to my troubles.
When I heard there was a half-man,
half-woman appearing nightly in one
of the San Francisco Market Street
sideshows, I dashed right up to see
him, or her, as the case may be. For
many years now, these heterogenous
characters have been almost a passion
with me.
Arriving on the scene of activity, I
elbowed my way through the maudlin
throng of morbid curiosity seekers to
feast my eyes on nature's strangest
phenomena. Thinking (s)he might
have something to offer to make the
front pages of the various papers in the
country, I engaged the dual personality
