# Peace Leads to War Youth Group Clash Over Methods
## 
### 
Laying aside their caps and bells
after playing the jester to America for
many months, the Veterans of Future
Wars which waged a satirical war for a
thousand dollar bonus last winter, last
week announced that, all fooling
aside, they have serious purposes—
in fact, three.
Commander Dick Creamer of the
Stanford Post announced that the
Princeton headquarters were backing
a threefold program.
"In the first place, we believe that
we can do much for the cause of
peace, not in the usual way, perhaps,
but by shocking people into thinking
of the whole problem of war and what
it means. We can give people a true
interpretation of certain situations
where others, in newspapers, etc., are
misleading them.
"In the second place, we believe that
we are leading in a fight against selfish
minority groups who have gotten spe
cial benefits from government and are
always trying for more. Our satire
against the Veterans groups is import
ant and should continue because they
represent the most vicious and suc
cessful minority group in the country
today. Pensions for all veterans will
be their endeavor in the next session
of Congress, and we believe that our
work in satirizing this move may help
defeat it. We believe that it is at least
worth a try.
"In the third place, the VF.W. rep
resents a group of young people who
are definitely organized. Too often in
this country the youth has been un
interested in things political. The world
is in a mess and the older generations
seem to have had little success in com
batting their problems. In the V.F.W.
we, with 100,000 members, have a
chance to do something perhaps con
structive, or at least show the old
fogies our interest and criticism. (In
all this we are talking of objects—not
methods — remember. Satire probably
is still our best weapon.)
