# Graduate Writes Teachers' Creed
## 
### 
Fred R. Leonard, Mendocino county
rural school supervisor who has been
doing graduate work in the School of
Education for the past two summers,
recently published the following creed
for teachers:
"I am an American teacher and am
proud to teach American ideals to
American youth under conditions of
American life. I will teach for the joy
of teaching, for it is a notorious fact j
that teachers never become rich. I will
be patient and cheerful with my young
charges, for patience and cheerfulness
are the cardinal virtues of a teacher.
I will see that my pupils develop need
ed skills in reading, writing and arith
metic, but will not neglect their devel
opment in ideals and attitudes, in
cleanliness of body and soul, in self
expression and in critical thinking.
"I will attempt to secure definite ad
vancement day by day for each pupil,
toward a goal that exists in his mind if
possible, but that exists at least in the
mind of his teacher, for I will not be
guilty of planless teaching. I will watch
for any spark of originality, and in
stead of smothering it, will attempt to ]
fan it into flame in the young life
where it glows."
It has been often said there are three
things the average man can do better j
than anyone else—poke up the fire, I
make love, and run a newspaper.

The Future Defenders of America,
Inc., a national youth organization,
has declared a new war against com- |
munism.
At their first national convention at
Loyola University at Los Angeles last
week, the delegates from more than 90
American colleges and universities
voted to extend their patriotic cam
paign into America's co-educational
institutions and high schools. Carl
Schuck of St. Mary's College was I
named director.
Active support to the recent Papal
encyclical for more rigid censorship
of motion pictures "in the interests of
morality" was pledged. The organiza
tion condemned the single tax as "con
fiscatory" and the California chain
store tax as "un-American and dis
criminatory."
Referring to the Veterans of Future
Wars and the Future Gold Star Moth
ers, National Commander Martin H.
Work of Loyola, told the assembly:
"We too want peace and social jus
tice, but we know that we cannot at
tain them by sacrificing our American
ideals. We must oppose such un-
American methods as practiced by
other youth organizations who wave \
the bi-colored flag of 'red' and 'yel
low'."
The convention re-elected Mr. Work
as their leader, and made plans to car
ry out their war against Communism.
Education is progressing. In 1910, il- 1
literacy in California was 3.7%. In 1920
it was 3.3%. In 1930 it had dropped to
2.6%. Illiterates ought to be practically
extinct by the time the next census
is taken. I

Fred R. Leonard, Mendocino county

doing graduate work in the School of
Education for the past two summers,
recently published the following creed
for teachers:
"I am an American teacher and am
proud to teach American ideals to
American youth under conditions of
American life. I will teach for the joy
of teaching, for it is a notorious fact j
that teachers never become rich. I will
be patient and cheerful with my young
charges, for patience and cheerfulness
are the cardinal virtues of a teacher.
I will see that my pupils develop need
ed skills in reading, writing and arith
metic, but will not neglect their devel
opment in ideals and attitudes, in
cleanliness of body and soul, in self
expression and in critical thinking.
"I will attempt to secure definite ad
vancement day by day for each pupil,
toward a goal that exists in his mind if
possible, but that exists at least in the
mind of his teacher, for I will not be
guilty of planless teaching. I will watch
for any spark of originality, and in
stead of smothering it, will attempt to ]
fan it into flame in the young life
where it glows."

The Future Defenders of America,
Inc., a national youth organization,
has declared a new war against com- |
munism.
At their first national convention at
Loyola University at Los Angeles last
week, the delegates from more than 90
American colleges and universities
voted to extend their patriotic cam
paign into America's co-educational
institutions and high schools. Carl
Schuck of St. Mary's College was I
named director.
Active support to the recent Papal
encyclical for more rigid censorship
of motion pictures "in the interests of
morality" was pledged. The organiza
tion condemned the single tax as "con
fiscatory" and the California chain
store tax as "un-American and dis
criminatory."
Referring to the Veterans of Future
Wars and the Future Gold Star Moth
ers, National Commander Martin H.
Work of Loyola, told the assembly:
"We too want peace and social jus
tice, but we know that we cannot at
tain them by sacrificing our American
ideals. We must oppose such un-
American methods as practiced by
other youth organizations who wave \
the bi-colored flag of 'red' and 'yel
low'."
The convention re-elected Mr. Work
as their leader, and made plans to car
ry out their war against Communism.
