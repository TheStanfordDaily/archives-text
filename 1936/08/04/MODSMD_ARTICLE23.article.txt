# "New Problems and Freedom" Is Radio Topic
## Dr. Frank Thomas Lauds America for Its Free Thought and Expression 
### 
"If one were trying to seek the most
characteristic and continuous trait
and tradition of American life and
thought, it would be found in the spir
it of freedom which has lighted every
pathway of our progress," Dr. Frank
W. Thomas, lecturer in education,
stated in his radio talk on "New Prob
lems and the Spirit of Freedom" which
was given last night over station KGO.
"The greatest disloyalty to the spirit
of America would be to shackle and
restrain its most cherished guide
toward new truth and new opportunity
—the spirit of freedom." Dr. Thomas
explained that just as freedom of
thought and expression was necessary
to scientific developments, it is now
particularly vital to the solution of
present day social and economic prob
lems.
Basic Virtues Remain
"Certain modern problems deal with
morals and the closely related chang
ing customs. There is unquestionably
a decay of authoritative sanction to
conduct. There have been changes in
customs, but there has been no repeal
of those fundamental virtues which
underlie sound social relationships.
Certainly there should be no fear of
discussion or investigation as to the
true reasons for such relationships."
Dr. Thomas suggested that people
should not take too seriously the start
ling proposals that are offered as a
means of solving the puzzles which are
created by changing modern condi
tions.
"There will always be some who
want everything changed and some
who want nothing changed.
Youth and Progress
"Youth is especially susceptible to
the expression of unexpected ideas and
proposals," the speaker continued.
"Colleges and universities would in
deed be dreary places if there were
not always the lively interest of youth
in novel forms of progress, and occa
sionally expressions of what seem rad
ical points of view. It is only when ex
pression and consideration are denied
that the idea becomes exaggerated into
dangerous importance and seeks
equally ill-advised action."
"The Wind of Freedom Blows" is
the motto which was chosen by David
Starr Jordan for Stanford University.
In such an air of freedom, scientific
research and the courageous quest for
truth became steadfast traditions of the
University, to be supplemented in re
cent years by the application of this
motto and spirit to new fields and
problems including social and eco
nomic relationships.
As Dr. Thomas continued in connec
tion with this idea, "Science has al
ways required freedom in its search
for truth, because its conclusions were
always subject to change. There had to
be freedom for adjustments so as to
solve new problems in the light of new
truth."

research and the courageous quest for
truth became steadfast traditions of the
University, to be supplemented in re
cent years by the application of this
motto and spirit to new fields and
problems including social and eco
nomic relationships.
As Dr. Thomas continued in connec
tion with this idea, "Science has al
ways required freedom in its search
for truth, because its conclusions were
always subject to change. There had to
be freedom for adjustments so as to
solve new problems in the light of new
truth."
"If one were trying to seek the most
characteristic and continuous trait
and tradition of American life and
thought, it would be found in the spir
it of freedom which has lighted every
pathway of our progress," Dr. Frank
W. Thomas, lecturer in education,
stated in his radio talk on "New Prob
lems and the Spirit of Freedom" which
was given last night over station KGO.
"The greatest disloyalty to the spirit
of America would be to shackle and
restrain its most cherished guide
toward new truth and new opportunity
—the spirit of freedom." Dr. Thomas
explained that just as freedom of
thought and expression was necessary
to scientific developments, it is now
particularly vital to the solution of
present day social and economic prob
lems.
Basic Virtues Remain
"Certain modern problems deal with
morals and the closely related chang
ing customs. There is unquestionably
a decay of authoritative sanction to
conduct. There have been changes in
customs, but there has been no repeal
of those fundamental virtues which
underlie sound social relationships.
Certainly there should be no fear of
discussion or investigation as to the
true reasons for such relationships."
Dr. Thomas suggested that people
should not take too seriously the start
ling proposals that are offered as a
means of solving the puzzles which are
created by changing modern condi
tions.
"There will always be some who
want everything changed and some
who want nothing changed.
Youth and Progress
"Youth is especially susceptible to
the expression of unexpected ideas and
proposals," the speaker continued.
"Colleges and universities would in
deed be dreary places if there were
not always the lively interest of youth
in novel forms of progress, and occa
sionally expressions of what seem rad
ical points of view. It is only when ex
pression and consideration are denied
that the idea becomes exaggerated into
dangerous importance and seeks
equally ill-advised action."
"The Wind of Freedom Blows" is
the motto which was chosen by David
Starr Jordan for Stanford University.
In such an air of freedom, scientific
research and the courageous quest for
truth became steadfast traditions of the
University, to be supplemented in re
cent years by the application of this
motto and spirit to new fields and
problems including social and eco
nomic relationships.
