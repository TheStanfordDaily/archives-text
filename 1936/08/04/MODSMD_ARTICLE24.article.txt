# SUNSPOTS AND WEATHER
## 
### 
If sunspots influence the course of
weather on the earth (and presumably
also on other planets), the planets in
their turn influence the formation of
sunspots, and thus, indirectly, their
own weather events.
This was revealed in a statistical
study of correlations between the po
sitions of the three planets nearest the
sun—Mercury, Venus, and the earth—
and the numbers and positions of sun
spots which has been made by Dr. ,
Fernando Sanford, emeritus professor
of physics at Stanford University.
An apparent hookup between the
planetary positions and sunspots was
first noticed by an English astronomer, 1
Mrs. A. S. D. Maunder, about 30 years
ago. Mrs. Maunder noted the curious
fact that sunspots apparently formed
in larger numbers on the side of the
sun opposite the earth than they did
on the side we can see.
Dr. Sanford has extended this cor
relation study to include the two :
planets that are still nearer the sun, |
and finds that they, too, seem to shove
the sunspots around the sun to the
opposite side.
