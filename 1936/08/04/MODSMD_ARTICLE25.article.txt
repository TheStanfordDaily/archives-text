# Present Traffic Solution Scored
## 
### Stephen Enke 
When the magazine article "And
Sudden Death" first appeared in the
nation's periodicals the public was
awakened to a realization of what un
emotional accident statistics could
mean in human blood and suffering.
Ever since the emphasis placed by
most public agencies engaged in re
ducing the number of traffic mishaps
has been on the horror of automobile
accidents. Recently Adolph Zukor
produced a film of similar title and in
heriting the same traditions.
While I have no quarrel with those
who wish to bring safety to our high
ways I find myself in opposition to the
methods used. Fear is too negative an
influence with which to solve any
problem. While fear may make some
drivers more cautious it will only make
those who are already nervous the
more rattled. To merely make the
public fearful of accidents or to de
sire their elimination, although it is
the first necessary step perhaps, is far
from being the last. And there seems
to be a tendency on the part of those
responsible to fyel that horror propa
ganda and a strict regulation of speed
will be sufficient to prevent further
accidents.
Multiple Causation
This is a very naive view. Traffic ac
cidents are a result of a complexity of
causes and no single influence can
usually be considex-ed as alone guilty.
While the consequences of speed, in
the event of an accident, may be
frightful, it is not of itself usually the
primary cause of the accident. Speed
of course contributes to the death rate
as it makes any accident more serious.
If, however, that accident had never
taken place the mere fact of speed
would be unimportant. To place exces
sive emphasis on speed is to tacitly
assume that accidents cannot be pre
vented and that their consequences
alone can be ameliorated. This is a de
featist attitude and places a consider
able check on the advantages that au- I
tomobile science has given us. The
principal use of the automobile is its
ability to transport persons and goods
from place to place at speed and if ac
cidents can be prevented without cur
tailing the convenience of the modern
motor car such a policy should be
favored.
Real Solution
It seems probable that such an ap
proach is possible. Unfortunately, it is
too easy to blame accidents on speed.

The real cause may be less tangible
' and is hence overlooked. Any real
j solution, however, must attack the
problem more scientifically and collect
j statistics that are the result of a more
I careful analysis. For so long as our
j legislators, justices and police officers
continue to believe that accidents can
be prevented by horror tales and speed
restrictions, ambulances will continue
to carry corpses from the highway to
I the morgue.
Certain universities are now engaged
in gathering and analyzing statistics.
Let us hope that this will result in a
changed attitude on the part of the
law and those that interpret it. The
California Vehicle Code, as it now
stands, is in need of drastic amend
{ ment. Recent investigations have
, shown that a majority of the accidents
| are caused by a small minority of
I drivers. Better provision should be
I made to have these drivers taken off
the road. Every state in the Union
! has insufficient control over the issu
j ing of licenses, while setae exercise
j what is tantamount to no supervision
| at all.
Dangerous Drivers
j While it is undoubtedly true that
j many accidents are the result of reck
| less speed most are caused by care
| lessness and lack of intelligence. A few
I are the result of physical defects as
i important as the psychical ones men
i tioned above. It is the man who turns
in and out of intersections without
looking, the old ladies of both sexes
that stay in the middle of the road,
! and those who do not bother to look
| in their mirrors and see what is com
ing up behind them who cause the ac
! cidents that speed aggravates.
The present attitude is that any per
! son over a certain arbitrary age is
qualified to operate a piece of lethal
i mechanism. This view will have to be
j changed. Many persons are simply in
[ capable of driving an automobile and
should be prevented. In my opinion a
careful investigation could discover
those mental and physical traits which
cause accidents and which can be re
vealed under examination on the part
of inspectors. At the moment we are
content to let anybody drive so long
as everybody drives slowly. Some day
we will limit those who drive rather
than the speed at which they travel.
In the meantime propaganda that
will make the public anxious to bring
about reforms is to be commended.

who wish to bring safety to our high
ways I find myself in opposition to the
methods used. Fear is too negative an
influence with which to solve any
problem. While fear may make some
drivers more cautious it will only make
those who are already nervous the
more rattled. To merely make the
public fearful of accidents or to de
sire their elimination, although it is
the first necessary step perhaps, is far
from being the last. And there seems
to be a tendency on the part of those
responsible to fyel that horror propa
ganda and a strict regulation of speed
will be sufficient to prevent further
accidents.
Multiple Causation
This is a very naive view. Traffic ac
cidents are a result of a complexity of
causes and no single influence can
usually be considex-ed as alone guilty.
While the consequences of speed, in
the event of an accident, may be
frightful, it is not of itself usually the
primary cause of the accident. Speed
of course contributes to the death rate
as it makes any accident more serious.
If, however, that accident had never
taken place the mere fact of speed
would be unimportant. To place exces
sive emphasis on speed is to tacitly
assume that accidents cannot be pre
vented and that their consequences
alone can be ameliorated. This is a de
featist attitude and places a consider
able check on the advantages that au- I
tomobile science has given us. The
principal use of the automobile is its
ability to transport persons and goods
from place to place at speed and if ac
cidents can be prevented without cur
tailing the convenience of the modern
motor car such a policy should be
favored.
Real Solution
It seems probable that such an ap
proach is possible. Unfortunately, it is
too easy to blame accidents on speed.

The real cause may be less tangible
' and is hence overlooked. Any real
j solution, however, must attack the
problem more scientifically and collect
j statistics that are the result of a more
I careful analysis. For so long as our
j legislators, justices and police officers
continue to believe that accidents can
be prevented by horror tales and speed
restrictions, ambulances will continue
to carry corpses from the highway to
I the morgue.
Certain universities are now engaged
in gathering and analyzing statistics.
Let us hope that this will result in a
changed attitude on the part of the
law and those that interpret it. The
California Vehicle Code, as it now
stands, is in need of drastic amend
{ ment. Recent investigations have
, shown that a majority of the accidents
| are caused by a small minority of
I drivers. Better provision should be
I made to have these drivers taken off
the road. Every state in the Union
! has insufficient control over the issu
j ing of licenses, while setae exercise
j what is tantamount to no supervision
| at all.
Dangerous Drivers
j While it is undoubtedly true that
j many accidents are the result of reck
| less speed most are caused by care
| lessness and lack of intelligence. A few
I are the result of physical defects as
i important as the psychical ones men
i tioned above. It is the man who turns
in and out of intersections without
looking, the old ladies of both sexes
that stay in the middle of the road,
! and those who do not bother to look
| in their mirrors and see what is com
ing up behind them who cause the ac
! cidents that speed aggravates.
The present attitude is that any per
! son over a certain arbitrary age is
qualified to operate a piece of lethal
i mechanism. This view will have to be
j changed. Many persons are simply in
[ capable of driving an automobile and
should be prevented. In my opinion a
careful investigation could discover
those mental and physical traits which
cause accidents and which can be re
vealed under examination on the part
of inspectors. At the moment we are
content to let anybody drive so long
as everybody drives slowly. Some day
we will limit those who drive rather
than the speed at which they travel.
In the meantime propaganda that
will make the public anxious to bring
about reforms is to be commended.
When the magazine article "And
Sudden Death" first appeared in the
nation's periodicals the public was
awakened to a realization of what un
emotional accident statistics could
mean in human blood and suffering.
Ever since the emphasis placed by
most public agencies engaged in re
ducing the number of traffic mishaps
has been on the horror of automobile
accidents. Recently Adolph Zukor

responsible to fyel that horror propa
ganda and a strict regulation of speed
will be sufficient to prevent further
accidents.
Multiple Causation
This is a very naive view. Traffic ac
cidents are a result of a complexity of
causes and no single influence can
usually be considex-ed as alone guilty.
While the consequences of speed, in
the event of an accident, may be
frightful, it is not of itself usually the
primary cause of the accident. Speed
of course contributes to the death rate
as it makes any accident more serious.
If, however, that accident had never
taken place the mere fact of speed
would be unimportant. To place exces
sive emphasis on speed is to tacitly
assume that accidents cannot be pre
vented and that their consequences
alone can be ameliorated. This is a de
featist attitude and places a consider
able check on the advantages that au- I
tomobile science has given us. The
principal use of the automobile is its
ability to transport persons and goods
from place to place at speed and if ac
cidents can be prevented without cur
tailing the convenience of the modern
motor car such a policy should be
favored.
Real Solution
It seems probable that such an ap
proach is possible. Unfortunately, it is
too easy to blame accidents on speed.

The real cause may be less tangible
' and is hence overlooked. Any real
j solution, however, must attack the
problem more scientifically and collect
j statistics that are the result of a more
I careful analysis. For so long as our
j legislators, justices and police officers
continue to believe that accidents can
be prevented by horror tales and speed
restrictions, ambulances will continue
to carry corpses from the highway to
I the morgue.
Certain universities are now engaged
in gathering and analyzing statistics.
Let us hope that this will result in a
changed attitude on the part of the
law and those that interpret it. The
California Vehicle Code, as it now
stands, is in need of drastic amend
{ ment. Recent investigations have
, shown that a majority of the accidents
| are caused by a small minority of
I drivers. Better provision should be
I made to have these drivers taken off
the road. Every state in the Union
! has insufficient control over the issu
j ing of licenses, while setae exercise
j what is tantamount to no supervision
| at all.
Dangerous Drivers
j While it is undoubtedly true that
j many accidents are the result of reck
| less speed most are caused by care
| lessness and lack of intelligence. A few
I are the result of physical defects as
i important as the psychical ones men
i tioned above. It is the man who turns
in and out of intersections without
looking, the old ladies of both sexes
that stay in the middle of the road,
! and those who do not bother to look
| in their mirrors and see what is com
ing up behind them who cause the ac
! cidents that speed aggravates.
The present attitude is that any per
! son over a certain arbitrary age is
qualified to operate a piece of lethal
i mechanism. This view will have to be
j changed. Many persons are simply in
[ capable of driving an automobile and
should be prevented. In my opinion a
careful investigation could discover
those mental and physical traits which
cause accidents and which can be re
vealed under examination on the part
of inspectors. At the moment we are
content to let anybody drive so long
as everybody drives slowly. Some day
we will limit those who drive rather
than the speed at which they travel.
In the meantime propaganda that
will make the public anxious to bring
about reforms is to be commended.
When the magazine article "And
Sudden Death" first appeared in the
nation's periodicals the public was
awakened to a realization of what un
emotional accident statistics could
mean in human blood and suffering.
Ever since the emphasis placed by
most public agencies engaged in re
ducing the number of traffic mishaps
has been on the horror of automobile
accidents. Recently Adolph Zukor
produced a film of similar title and in
heriting the same traditions.
While I have no quarrel with those
who wish to bring safety to our high
ways I find myself in opposition to the
methods used. Fear is too negative an
influence with which to solve any
problem. While fear may make some
drivers more cautious it will only make
those who are already nervous the
more rattled. To merely make the
public fearful of accidents or to de
sire their elimination, although it is
the first necessary step perhaps, is far
from being the last. And there seems
to be a tendency on the part of those
responsible to fyel that horror propa
ganda and a strict regulation of speed
will be sufficient to prevent further
accidents.
