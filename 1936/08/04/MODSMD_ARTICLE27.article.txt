"Poor Little Rich Girl" has Shirley
Temple for its star and torchsinger
Alice Faye, handsome Michael Whalen,
Gloria Stuart, Henry Armetta, and a
score of other players creating situa
tions for the tiny actress to sing, tap,
and prettily smile through. La Temple
is so impishly appealing that even the
utterly absurd plot of the picture can
be overlooked. On the whole, while a
somewhat fantastic story, the picture
need not necessarily be judged on its
lack of realism, it accomplishes its
purpose when it provides entertain
ment and that it does.
The story—well, see for yourself—
casts Shirley as daughter to fabulously
rich soap manufacturer Michael Whal
en, who sends her off to school and
then in the traditional rich man way
forgets all about her. She in the mean
while has some extraordinary experi
ence. Her nurse is struck by an auto
while they are yet at the depot so
Shirley wanders away until she meets
Tony (Henry Armetta) and his monk
ey, who are kind enough to take her
home for the night. A couple of vaude
ville hoofers hear her tapping from
their room above Tony's lodgings and
get the grand idea of teaming her in a
radio act. This accomplished, the plot
wages more ridiculous than ever by
having Shirley signed up for a radio
contract with her father's only busi
ness competitor. As if this were not
enough, the picture doesn't leave off
until it has involved the heroine in at
least one attempted kidnap.
Alice Faye and Jack Haley supply
grown-up interest for those too blase
to take in a child picture. Their ar
rangement of "You've Got To Eat
Your Spinache, Baby'' is put over in
good style.
