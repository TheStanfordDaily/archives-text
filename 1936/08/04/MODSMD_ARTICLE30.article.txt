# Disease Brought By Meteorites
## 
### 
Science at last has concrete proof of
the existence of life outside our own
earth.
This was the highlight of the fourth
annual meeting of the Society for Re
search on Meteorites, held recently on
the campus of the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles.
Dr. Charles Lipman, dean of the
graduate division at the University of
California at Berkeley, set the tongues
of visiting scientists a-buzzing on this
oft-discussed question when he pre
sented a paper entitled, Bacteria in
Meteorites, in which he outlined his
findings.
Dr. Lipman said: "I have personally
found a considerable variety of bacte
ria in meteoritesâ€”and have seen them
grow and flourish in a normal way
after they have left their arrested
state."
Into the discard also went such old
fashioned terms as shooting stars, fire
balls, uranoliths, and many others
which have come from all the lan
guages including the Scandinavian. In
their place, Dr. Frederick C. Leonard
of U.C.L.A. suggested a newer and
simpler terminology.
Dr. L. J. Spencer, keeper of minerals
for the British Museum of Natural His
tory, contributed a paper on the mys
terious tektites.
Other papers were presented by Dr.
Arthur S. King of the Mt. Wilson Ob
servatory, John S. Hopkins of Pomona
College, L. F. Brady of the Flagstaff
Observatory, Dr. Walter T. Whitney of

Pomona College, Prof. H. H. Nininger
of the Colorado Museum of Natural
History, Prof. Mohd A. R. Khan of Os
mania University College, India, and
John Davis Buddhue of Pasadena.
