# Highway Lighting Is Suggestion
## 
### 
Adequate electric lighting of country
roads to increase the safety factor of
night driving, and to aid all around ef
ficiency, appears to be the next step
in highway development.
It is declared to be a logical move in
furthering the campaign to prevent
accidents, and to give the nation's
highway system the maximum of trav
el facilities. This proposal also would
prove a great aid to night flying along
the airways.
Electrical engineers recommend
powerful roadway lamps placed at in
tervals of 100 yards, which, according
to estimates, would add about five
per cent to the average cost of paved
highways.
Special legislation would be required
in most states to have lighting included
in expenditures for roads, it is stated.
However, there are three states, New
York, New Jersey and Georgia, having
such laws applicable to the more popu
lous countries. Detroit has 345 miles
of lighted rural highways in its vi
cinity.
