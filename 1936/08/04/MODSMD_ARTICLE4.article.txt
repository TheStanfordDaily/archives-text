# Stanford Grads Make Trade In Picadilly
## 
### 
It is not at all common to hear the
Stanford "hello" resound along Pica
dilly, in London, and when it does
happen generally more than a "hello"
results.
Gray Creveling, a graduate of last
June and former Daily columnist, is
probably still wondering about the fate
that set him face to face with Ray Ly
man Wilbur, Jr., son of President Wil
bur and graduate of the Class of 1934,
while walking on a street more than
6,000 miles from the entrance to Palm
Drive.
As is customary for Americans
abroad, the two Stanfordites made a
deal. When they parted Gray, who is
on his way around the world, had one
season ticket to the Berlin Olympic-
Games and Ray Lyman, Jr., was richer
by one purchase price of same.
