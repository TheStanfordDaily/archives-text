# Dr. Hu Warns Of New World War Dangers
## Dean of Peking University Speaks on the Present State of Affairs in China 
### 
Labeling the present situation in the
Pacific region as intensely alarming,
Dr. Hu Shih, dean of the Peking Na
tional University, yesterday predicted
a second world war unless an effective
international machinery is soon
evolved for amiably settling the Sino-
Japanese disputes. Dr. Hu spoke be
fore an audience in the Little Theatre
on the topic, "Present Situation in
China."
"There is no limit to Japanese ag
gresion; they will never be satisfied.
We have no hope of checking or mod
erating the expansionist appetite of
Japan and unless steps are taken for
a settlement between us by peaceful
means, it will result in an interna
tional conflagration out of which no
nation may expect to keep out."
Dr. Hu backed the above statement
by declaring that any attempts on the
part of China for a peaceful adjust-

ment of the altercation have thus far
been completely rejected by Japan.
Defenses Built Up
That China is rapidly building up
her national defenses, the speaker defi
nitely pointed out. Not only this, but
trying though the situation has been
to her, it has resulted in four con
structive gains:
"Destruction of that false sense of
security, those dreams of international
idealism which were propounded by
the Peace of Paris, the Briand-Kellogg
Pact, the Washington Conference, and
the League of Nations.
"The realization that we have only
ourselves to rely upon, which is in
spiring, at present, all the phases of
social progress in our country.
"The rapidity with which the phys
ical basis for political unity has been
going on in the last four or five years.
Railroads, miles and miles of motor
roads, and commercial aviation in the
space of a few short years have so con
nected the several parts of China as to
make her complete political unit now
only a matter of time.
Unification Needed
"Most important is the promise in
the direction of political unity which
all this internal progress assures. The
present government is the most help
ful which has taken hold of the coun
try and unification is no longer a
dream."
Dr. Hu concluded with an appeal for
united effort in peaceably settling the
cause of war between China and
Japan.
Here for Conference
Dr. Hu is in this country as head of
the Chinese delegation to the sixth con
ference of the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions. The lecturer is recognized as one
of the foremost modern Chinese think
ers. His interests lie in literature and
philosophy, being a leader in literary
affairs, an essayist, and a poet. Dr. Hu
has a tremendous influence with the
educated young Chinese. He is liberal
in his political views, and is one of the
most highly respected leaders of the
intelligentsia in China today.

ourselves to rely upon, which is in
spiring, at present, all the phases of
social progress in our country.
"The rapidity with which the phys
ical basis for political unity has been
going on in the last four or five years.
Railroads, miles and miles of motor
roads, and commercial aviation in the
space of a few short years have so con
nected the several parts of China as to
make her complete political unit now
only a matter of time.
Unification Needed
"Most important is the promise in
the direction of political unity which
all this internal progress assures. The
present government is the most help
ful which has taken hold of the coun
try and unification is no longer a
dream."
Dr. Hu concluded with an appeal for
united effort in peaceably settling the
cause of war between China and
Japan.

Dr. Hu Shih
Labeling the present situation in the
Pacific region as intensely alarming,
Dr. Hu Shih, dean of the Peking Na
tional University, yesterday predicted
a second world war unless an effective
international machinery is soon
evolved for amiably settling the Sino-
Japanese disputes. Dr. Hu spoke be
fore an audience in the Little Theatre
on the topic, "Present Situation in
China."
"There is no limit to Japanese ag
gresion; they will never be satisfied.
We have no hope of checking or mod
erating the expansionist appetite of
Japan and unless steps are taken for
a settlement between us by peaceful
means, it will result in an interna
tional conflagration out of which no
nation may expect to keep out."
Dr. Hu backed the above statement
by declaring that any attempts on the
part of China for a peaceful adjust-

ment of the altercation have thus far
been completely rejected by Japan.
Defenses Built Up
That China is rapidly building up
her national defenses, the speaker defi
nitely pointed out. Not only this, but
trying though the situation has been
to her, it has resulted in four con
structive gains:
"Destruction of that false sense of
security, those dreams of international
idealism which were propounded by
the Peace of Paris, the Briand-Kellogg
Pact, the Washington Conference, and
the League of Nations.
"The realization that we have only
ourselves to rely upon, which is in
spiring, at present, all the phases of
social progress in our country.

ical basis for political unity has been
