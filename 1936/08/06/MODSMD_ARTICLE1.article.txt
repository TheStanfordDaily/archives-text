# Beauty Attained In Architecture Of Bay Bridge
## Simplicity Is Keynote Of S.F. – Oakland Expanse, Says Chief Designer 
### 
"Almost 70 years ago Leland Stan
ford made the first proposal for a bay
bridge. Nothing, however, was done
until 1929," stated Howard C. Wood,
chief designing engineer of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, in his
illustrated lecture on "Guiding Prin
ciples in the Construction of the San
Francisco Bay Bridge," Tuesday eve
ning in the Assembly Hall.
In discussing the architecture of the
bridge Mr. Wood said, "When a con
flict between beauty and economy
arose in the design of the San Fran
cisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, beauty won
unless the cost was too enormous."
Examples of Beauty
Pointing out specific examples, he
said that in one case the piers which
support the bridge approach were in
creased beyond structural requirement
at added expense in order to present a
more pleasing appearance in propor
tions. In another instance concentric
designs were added to the face of the
tunnel to give a widened and more
pleasing scale. In constructing the
towers an additional diagonal cross
member (three instead of two) was
used to improve appearance. These
cross members were made larger than
constructional need in order to give
better proportion and added beauty.
The columns on the Rincon Hill ap
proach were enlarged beyond struc
tural needs to give better proportion,
otherwise they would look like tooth
picks.
Design Requirements
The design was governed by certain
requirements. Clearance for ships
above water, the placement of piers so
as not to obstruct navigation, and the
depth of water in various locations all
had to be considered. The decision as
to the length of the span was governed
by the cost and its ability to give serv
ice. Whenever possible, Mr. Wood
pointed out, an attempt was made to
make the design pleasing to the eye.
Only where structural strength would
be sacrificed was beauty of line dis
regarded.
'Simplicity of treatment was the
aesthetic keynote." Mr. Wood declared.
The unusual problem of scale because
of the size and broad expanse of water
demanded simplicity. In general we
have tried to design a bridge pleasing
in simplicity and one which will be
safe. We have attempted to give con
tinuity of appearance rather than to
emphasize specific points. Continuous
beams helped to satisfy structural as
well as aesthetic requirements. Credit
for the beauty of the bridge goes to the
architects."
Slides Illustrate Lecture
Mr. Wood illustrated by means of
slides and description the methods by
which the piers, which are (50 feet
lower than any others attempted, were
sunk. The caissons on the West Bay
were sunk and grounded on mud at a
depth of 70 to 105 feet and then sunk
to rock bottom.
At the East Bay instead of using
domes on top of the caissons, bulk
heads were placed tm the bottom.
When the caissons were sunk to the
bottom,, the bulkheads were removed
