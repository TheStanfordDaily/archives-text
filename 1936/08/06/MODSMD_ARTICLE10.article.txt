# Stanford Campus Earthquake Conscious
## 
### 
"When the quake of 1906 struck
Stanford it started a number of sug
gestions in the minds of those who ex
perienced it," said Dr. Bailey Willis
when interviewed yesterday on the
subject in which he is a noted expert.
Dr. Willis, emeritus head of the geol
ogy department fit Stanford, has spent
years in research and experimentation
to study the origins of earthquakes.
"One of those which is still bearing
fruit was the conviction on the part of
J. C. Branner, professor of geology and
vice-president of Stanford, that scien
tific men bear a responsibility toward
the public in regard to the interpreta
tion of natural phenomena and the
possibility of safe-guarding humanity
against their dangers," continued Dr.
Willis.
Dr. Branner strove throughout the
rest of his life to advance the idea that
earthquakes are dangerous chiefly be
cause we do not build rightly to re
sist them, but for 10 or 15 years fol
lowing that great disaster it was im
possible to make any headway against
the conspiracy of silence in regard
to it.
Public Conscious
"Thus it was not until the gentler
educational earthquakes of 1918 (San
Jacinto), 1920 (Inglewood), 1925 (Santa
t√üarbara), 1933 (Long Beach) made
the public earthquake conscious that

any considerable progress could be'
made, said Dr. Willis. "However, the I
Seismological Society of America, i
which owed its existence to the 190(5
shock, began about 1920 to investigate
the problem of construction to resist
earthquakes."
Dr. Willis, who was then the presi
dent of the society, organized a com
mittee on "building for safety,'' as it
was called. It was comprised of archi
tects and engineers who met under his
chairmanship from time to time during
the next two years.
"The result was highly educational,"
said Dr. Willis, "for the committee
learned how little we knew about
earthquakes and their destructive ac
tivity. Wrecked buildings were plenti
fully illustrated, but a wrecked build
ing is a very poor laboratory experi
ment because its original strength is
unknown."
Santa Barbara
"The Santa Barbara earthquake and
eight years later that of Long Beach,"
Dr. Willis continued, "have caused en
gineers to investigate more scientifical- !
ly the action of a lateral push and vi- i
bration upon building structures.
Some of the most interesting results i
have been obtained upon the Stanford 1
shaking table which is operated by
Professor Ludik Jacobsen to determine
exactly what a known impulse will do
to a scientifically constructed model.

"Stanford itself has become earth
quake conscious to a gratifying degree,
as is demonstrated in the construction
of Lagunita Court, the new girls' dor
mitory which is one of the finest groups
of earthquake resistant buildings in
existence," said Dr. Willis.
Building Codes
"The broader effects arc found in
the revised building codes and the rep
utation of California in that respect is
shown by a request recently received
from Russia for the best code to direct
building in the Caucasus and other
earthquake districts of the Russian
Near East," Dr. Willis said.
In response to that request they
could find no better statement of the
principle to be applied than that con
tained in the Palo Alto building code
drawn up in 1922 by C. D. Marx,
Charles B. Wing, and Bailey Willis,
who were all members of the Stan
ford faculty.
"While some progress has been made
it is nevertheless true that contractors,
carpenters, and even architects follow
old practices which lead to weakness.
Unfortunately, those who build on the
Stanford campus are not subject to any
modern building code. The result has
been illustrated in some of the recon
structions of the sorority and fraternity
houses where braces that did not
brace and other slip-shod methods of
! construction crept in."
