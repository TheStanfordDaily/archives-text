# Shakespeare, Shaw Plays To Be Presented
## Opening Performance of Stage Classics Production Set for Next Thursday 
### 
This time next week the Assembly
Hall stage will be set for the opening
of the Stage Classics Productions of
Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra"
j and Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra."
The Shakespeare play will have two
performances, Thursday evening and
Saturday evening. The Shavian work
will have an evening performance on
Friday and a Satui'day matinee.

With curtain-rise on Thursday eve
ning comes the culmination of an en
tire summer of campus activities cen
tered about "the treatment of histor
ical themes and figures in drama"—
the pivot point of the work of the
Course in Stage Classics Production
under the executive direction of Dr.
Margery Bailey. The presentation of
this summer's plays is an encore in it
self—being the evidence of the ap
proval with which last summer's pro
duction of "Othello" was met.
The casts of "Antony and Cleopatra"
and "Caesar and Cleopatra" consist of
people who have acquired their dra
matic training mostly in campus dra
matics and with the Palo Alto Com
munity Players — nationally known
little theater group. But within the
casts there is a diversity of experience
and occupation.
