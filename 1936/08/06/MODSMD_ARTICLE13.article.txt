# Sears To Head National Council Of Investigation
## Effects of Depression On American Education To Be Inquiry Subject 
### 
Professor J. B. Sears of the Stanford
School of Education, authority in
school finance the administration, has
been appointed to head a national in
vestigation into the impact of the de
pression on American education, it was
announced here today. The inquiry
will be under the auspices of the Social
Science Research Council, well-known
fact-finding bureau.
Slump Felt
"Schools were especially vulnerable
to the slump," Sears declares. "Slashes
of 60 to 80 per cent were made in
building budgets in many districts, in
others building ceased entirely. Hun
dreds of schools were closed for lack
of funds. Totally two million students
were without school facilities."
Insufficient clothing and nourish
ment and economic insecurity at home
often contributed to keep children out
of schools that remained open, Sears
said.
Budgets Turn Upward
"School budgets are definitely turn
ing upward. Many districts have par
tially restored salary cuts to teachers
and building programs are now fairly
common," he stated.
The project is part of a broad inves
tigation carried on by the Research
Council to determine the total result
of the depression. Subjects to be ex
amined in their relationship to the
slump will also include: crime, relig
ion, the arts, recreation, social work,
relief, rural life, and reading habits.
Sears expects to leave for Washing
ton, D.C., early in September to begin
his investigation, where he plans to re
main about three months.
