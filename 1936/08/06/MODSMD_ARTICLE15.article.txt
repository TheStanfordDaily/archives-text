# Puppets Prove Popular in S.F.
## Federal Theater Presents 'Marionette Varieties' 
### 
If the desire to see marionette per
formances is indicated by advance de
mand for tickets and rapidly growing
audiences is any criterion, then inter
est in the art of puppetry is increasing
according to the report of the Federal
Theatre Project.
Play To Be Presented
With the announcement of the
forthcoming "Marionette Varieties,"
opening at the Federal Theater, 960
Bush Street, today, mail and telephone
orders for seats have been pouring in
for practically every night anci mati
nee of the two weeks' engagement.
"Marionette Varieties" is a ten-act
vaudeville show, that is, if the pres
ence of George Barnard Shaw as mas
ter of ceremonies is counted as an act.
Ralph Chesse, who directs the per
formance for the Federal Theater
Project, has covered the globe in an
effort to provide entertainment to meet
the tastes of his audience. The bill is
international in scope in that the pup
pet actors represent world famous
celebrities of many countries.
Countries Drawn On
Chesse has drawn on England for
Shaw; Russia for the Tchekoff one
act sketch, "The Marriage Proposal";
Poland for the great symphony leader,
Stokowski; Italy for Mine. Tilly, color
atura soprano; the United States for
the one-act sketch, "Behind Prison
Walls," a satire on the American pris
on parole system, and also for the king
of tap dancers, Bill Robinson, and Ed
gar Allen Poe, the poet, and the famous
Raven; Austria for Professor Solfeggio,
pianist; France for the famed La Tour
Brothers, acrobats; and lastly, Canada
for the five Dionne quints, who will
do a closer with a patois patter and
soft shoe number.
