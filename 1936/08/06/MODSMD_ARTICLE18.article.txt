# Doctors Save Stricken Boy

The manner in which a great uni
versity serves virtually every human
need, was given a poignant human in
terest touch by Professor Raymond E
Davis of the Department of Civil En
gineering, University of California, in
a recent address before a group of Ala
meda County educators:
"In 1930 a small boy on vacation at
Lake Tahoe was taken violently ill
with extremely high fever," Professor
Davis said. "A local physician was
called, but could not diagnose the ill
ness. So the mother bundled the boy
into the back seat of her automobile
and drove through the night to her
home in Berkeley, 250 miles away. The
family physician was baffled, but the
boy slowly recuperated. Then a second
attack came. Blood tests and X-rays
were taken but revealed nothing.
"Then came a third, a fourth, and a
fifth attack. Specialists were called in.
With each attack the boy was becoming
weaker and weaker. Finally, between
the fifth and sixth attack he was placed
under observation in the University of
California hospital in San Francisco.
His case was studied by bacteriologists
of the Hooper Foundation. They
checked their records and saw a simi
larity between this case and two other
cases they had studied back in 1921,
nine years before. They were suspi
cious. Then they took blood tests just
before the sixth attack. Finally on the
microscope slide they discovered the
spirochete which is the cause of re
lapsing fever, which was unknown in
this state before they worked on it in
1921. Working with the boy's physi
cians, they gave the treatment that
was required. They injected a solu
tion into the blood stream of the small
boy, and thus was ended the raid of the
spirochete.
"That small boy was my son."
