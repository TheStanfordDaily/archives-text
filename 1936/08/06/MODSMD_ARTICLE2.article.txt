by Professor Edgar E. Robinson, head
of the Department of History at Stan
ford, in response to a telegram of in
quiry to the State Department at
Washington.

tion started, and the revolt apparently
prevented Professor Savelle from
joining his family. The fact that Mrs.
Savelle is Spanish and her father, the
late General Maestre, a high-ranking
army officer, further complicates at
