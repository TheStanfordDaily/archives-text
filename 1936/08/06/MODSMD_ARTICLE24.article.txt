For quite some time now it has been
the job of a few philologists to try to
discover just what kind of language
the students in the present day colleges
speak. This system of language stu
dents use has long been as great an
American phenomenon as Hearst, but
no one as yet has published a book of
words and phrases coined in the last
ten years or so by a few nimble
witted lads desirous of distinguishing
themselves among the great masses of
the intellectuals. During the last few
months I have been gathering a rather
incomplete list of these words used by
Stanford students. Here are a few ex
amples of the language you speak.
Balloon juice. A noun meaning hot
air, such as in guff, gab, and jabber.
Breech. Any social error such as
belching, target spitting, swearing,
picking nose at table, passing out,
drunkenness, and striking your host
with a bottle. Breeches are born,
never fade.

ages to stagger over the terrain. John
Merritt owns a cadaver.
Custard lip. Anyone who talks too
much for everyone else's comfort.
One who speaks from impulse without
purpose. A satchel-mouth, a jelly
tongue.
