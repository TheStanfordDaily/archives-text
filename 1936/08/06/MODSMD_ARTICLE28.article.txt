# Ex-President Breaks Campus Liquor Laws
## 
### 
Do you know what famous man
was the first person to violate
Stanford's ban on liquor? No
other than an ex-President of the
United States.
William Henry Harrison in
1893 was an honorary professor of
law here, and visited on the cam
pus taking up his headquarters
at old Encina. With him he
brought several bottles of ye olde
Scotch and a supply of cigars
which also were forbidden at that
time.
Then came a night when Presi
dent Harrison was paid a stealthy
visit while he slept, and 10, both
the stimulants were spirited away.
He demanded their immediate re
turn, but because he was break
ing rules in possessing them at all
in Encina, no investigation was
made to discover the thieves. Nei
ther were apologies proffered to
the distinguished man, and only
for the reason that he was an ex-
President of the United States did
he escape formal reproof and dis
missal by the University author
ities.
