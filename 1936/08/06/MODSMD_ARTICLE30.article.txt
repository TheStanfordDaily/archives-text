"From the Stanford Daily?—You're (
not the reporter who has been writing j
! all those terrible interviews with pro
| i
fessors?"
"Interviews? I—I—"
"You probably did. I have never had
a decent bit of publicity from that pa
per yet. They invariably misrepresent
me and distort everything given them
even if it's written out in black and
| white first."
"Yes m'm."
I "Now, what do you want?"
! "I—l was hoping to get a feature 1
story on the younger generation of
Caesar's time versus the modern
! younger set."
| "That's something we know nothing
j about. They didn't write down such j
things. What else do you want to ;
know?"
(Hopefully): "Well—well—l thought ,
—wasn't Caesar rather a sinner in his i
—his day?"
"Sinner? Sinner because he had
I three wives? Not at all—for that mat

lini are absolutely parallel cases—now
don't you quote me—and the aim of J
Caesar in building his Rome is being
duplicated by the work of Mussolini

(Silence.)
"Now, what else do you want me to 1

talk about?"
"I—l believe that's all, and thank
you so much for the interview. Good
day."
"Now don't quote me."
(Now do you know why the inter
views are so bad?)
