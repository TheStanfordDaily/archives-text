# Local "Co-Op" Going Strong
## 
### 
For some time, since February, 1935,
in fact, there has been a consumers'
cooperative in Palo Alto. This concern
started with a membership of only five
persons but today, after a year and a
half of successful operation, there are
118 members.
Tho plan followed is similar to that
adopted by the Rochdale weavers dur
ing 1844 in England. Each member
owns an equal share in the enterprise.
Business is conducted on a cash basis
and the concern caters to the public.
Whatever profits there are at the end
of the year are apportioned among the
members according to the total value of
the purchases they made.
Membership in "The Consumers' Co
operative Society of Palo Alto" costs
only $10. This may be paid in install
ments. The society operates a grocery
store at 443 Bryant and has made bar
gaining agreements with a laundry, a
gas and oil station, a tire service, and
a book concern. Members can trade
at these places and obtain a rebate.
The Rochdale type of cooperative
has long been very popular in other
countries. In England, where they or
iginated, the "co-ops" have been very
strong for the last 50 years. The great
est development, however, has taken
place in the various Scandinavian
countries where their political
strength is considerable. Even in the
United States there has been quiet
progress. Today there exist many co
operatives in the Middle West. Re
cently, in that part of the country, a
chain of gas and oil co-operatives paid
rebates totalling over $5,000,000.
