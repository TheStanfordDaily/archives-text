# Indigestion Is Price of Strange Occupation
## 
### 
There are some strange jobs to be
had here on the Stanford campus. The
strangest, perhaps, is that of the official
taster over at the experimental sta
tion, where new varieties of fruit are
developed.
The job, which pays an average
wage, consists of taking a judicious ,
bite out of each peach (or whatever
the fruit may be) and wisely comment- |
ing on the taste and so forth. Although
peaches are very pleasant to eat in I
small quantities there is a fairly defi- '
nite limit as to how ,many bites one i
can successfully take. It is rumored l
that the senior pomologist, who joins I
in the fun, brings a bottle of salts to |
work with him. After the first day's i
work the taster wished she'd had as
much foresight.
This experimental station is main
tained by the Department of Agricul- !
ture. It is over in the direction of the |
Farm. Altogether it has
been here for 14 years, and a little bit
over, so it can't be held up against the
New Deal as another example of Ad
ministrative encroachment. During its
existence government officials and
private growers from many countries
have visited the station, the purpose >
of which is to develop new varieties of
peaches, plums, apricots, pears and j
other fruits. The senior pomologist is j
William F. Wight, who also lectures j
in the botany department here.
Peaches are probably Mr. Wight's
primary interest. According to him the
principal demand for them comes
from canners, dryers and the fresh fruit
trade. Each type of business needs a |
different type of peach. This is where
Mr. Wight's interest is aroused. Dryers
like a meaty freestone. Canners like a
cling. Shippers like peaches that are
picked relatively green but which will

ripen after being picked, and have a
ruddy color by the time they appear
on the market. All peaches must be
resistant to disease and varieties must
be developed that will ripen at differ
ent seasons of the year and Thus assure
a steady supply.
The Stanford station has cultivated
four new peaches that meet the above
requirements. The shipping qualities
of one are such that they can be sent
to Manila without spoiling. These four

.varieties are now all being grown on
a commercial scale. Two of these new
types are canning clings. A new plum
is also being developed.

existence government officials and
private growers from many countries
have visited the station, the purpose >
of which is to develop new varieties of
peaches, plums, apricots, pears and j
other fruits. The senior pomologist is j
William F. Wight, who also lectures j
in the botany department here.
Peaches are probably Mr. Wight's
primary interest. According to him the
principal demand for them comes
from canners, dryers and the fresh fruit
trade. Each type of business needs a |
different type of peach. This is where
Mr. Wight's interest is aroused. Dryers
like a meaty freestone. Canners like a
cling. Shippers like peaches that are
picked relatively green but which will

ripen after being picked, and have a
ruddy color by the time they appear
on the market. All peaches must be
resistant to disease and varieties must
be developed that will ripen at differ
ent seasons of the year and Thus assure
a steady supply.
The Stanford station has cultivated
four new peaches that meet the above
requirements. The shipping qualities
of one are such that they can be sent
to Manila without spoiling. These four

.varieties are now all being grown on
a commercial scale. Two of these new
types are canning clings. A new plum
is also being developed.
There are some strange jobs to be
had here on the Stanford campus. The
strangest, perhaps, is that of the official
taster over at the experimental sta
tion, where new varieties of fruit are
developed.
The job, which pays an average
wage, consists of taking a judicious ,
bite out of each peach (or whatever
the fruit may be) and wisely comment- |
ing on the taste and so forth. Although
peaches are very pleasant to eat in I
small quantities there is a fairly defi- '
nite limit as to how ,many bites one i
can successfully take. It is rumored l
that the senior pomologist, who joins I
in the fun, brings a bottle of salts to |
work with him. After the first day's i
work the taster wished she'd had as
much foresight.
This experimental station is main
tained by the Department of Agricul- !
ture. It is over in the direction of the |
Farm. Altogether it has
been here for 14 years, and a little bit
over, so it can't be held up against the
New Deal as another example of Ad
ministrative encroachment. During its
