# Allen Entertains Music Classes
## Visiting Teachers Display Talents at Program 
### 
The class in Music in Education was
entertained last Thursday evening by
Mr. and Mrs. Warren D. Allen at their
home. The class includes visiting
teachers, many of whom contributed
to the musical program.
Miss Hilda Grossman sang a number
of German songs. Mr. Ralph Uniacke,
who is head of the violin department at
Pomona College, Claremont,' played
the Handel Sonata in D Major for
violin.
Duets Played
Warren D. Allen and W. R. Kendall,
co-workers in the music department,
played a number of interesting selec
tions for the organ and the piano.
Highly applauded was the organ play
ing of Mr. Allen when he played some
of his own solo favorites.
Mr. Maurice Garabrant, the visiting
organist from New York, who played
at the Memorial Church last Thursday,
is leaving here today after having spent
three weeks of his vacation auditing
classes in the music department. His
tentative plans are to go north into
Canada and then to cross to the east
ern boundary.
Eighteenth century music is a theme
which is being expounded in Mr. Al
len's Monday and Thursday afternoon
classes. Members of the class have
played music typical of the period
while others have reported on the so
cial, economic, and moral conditions
of the day throughout Europe. Miss
Frances Haws, a regular Stanford stu
dent, played the Bach Sonata in B
Minor on her flute. Genevieve Wing,
a visitor from Portland, Ore., during
the summer session played the Pas
torale of Domencico Scarlatti.
