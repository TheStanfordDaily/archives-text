# Archeologist Lectures On "Caesar's Rome"
## Dr. Hansen Gives Tudor Talk in Connection With Stage Classics 
### 
In vivid and authentic strokes, Dr.
Hazel D. Hansen, associate professor of
classics, sketched the life of Caesar's
day last night in the Little Theater as
a preliminary to next week's final
Tudor lecture on "Egypt in Caesar's
Day."
This lecture on Egypt will complete
the Tudor background series for the
presentation of Shakespeare's "Antony
and Cleopatra" August 13, and Shaw's
"Caesar and Cleopatra" on August 14.
Both plays will be given on Saturday,
August 15.
Among other topics, Dr. Hansen de
picted the kinds of houses Romans
lived in, their difficult means of land
and sea travel, the hazards of travel
because of banditry, the games and
pleasures, the economic and domestic
life built around slavery, the clothing,
household utensils, and the public
buildings of various periods.
She held that slavery was respon
sible for the change in the life of the
Romans from the simple, frugal, and
temperate mode to the elaborate ex
travagance of the later days.
Much of the latter architecture of
Rome and the forum can be accounted
for, Dr. Hansen said, because of the
crowded conditions, not only among
the tenement houses, but even among
the governmental buildings, palaces of
the later time, and the town houses of
the wealthy.
In conclusion, Dr. Hansen illustrated
her talk with lantern slides of the
dwellings, maps of Rome, clothing, and
representations of the dominant char
acters of the era. The speaker was in
troduced to the audience by Dr. Mar
gery Bailey, who is in charge of the
stage classics course of which the Tu
dor lectures are a part.
