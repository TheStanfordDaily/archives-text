# All Women and Youths Must Stay at Home
## 
### 
There is more than one advantage
to being a male of legal age or over.
The "Art Appreciation" class has been
looking forward to a visit of inspec
tion over the bay bridge for some time.
The Department of Public Works,
however, cannot stand to have women
or youths on or about their structures.
1 So only those who are considered eliâ€”
I gible by the government will be able
j to go.
As there are not many such pcr
\ sons in the class, and whereas up to 20
persons can be taken, acceptable male
students of the proper age are invited
to go along. Tlie group will leave at
noon Tuesday, August 1, from the Art
Gallery. Students who are not in the
class and wish to go should file their
names at the Art Gallery or the Gcr-
I man office.
