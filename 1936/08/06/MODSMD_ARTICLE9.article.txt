# SAFETY RECORD
## 
### 
Have you been a motorist for the
past 34 years? Have you owned 21
different cars during your days as an
owner-driver? Have you driven 650,-
000 miles? And, besides doing all this,
have you managed to avoid any sort
of an accident or traffic tag? If so, you
have a record at least equal to that of
San Francisco's Mrs. Leavitt, who has
won the honor of representing Cali
fornia in a nation-wide motorcade. If
you haven't, this might be a good time
to start training for a new safety rec
ord. All you have to do is to drive the
equivalent of 26 times around the
world with no hits and no tags.
