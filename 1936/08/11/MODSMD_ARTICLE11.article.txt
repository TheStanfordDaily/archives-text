# Professor Asks for Home-Made Drama
## 
### 
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
