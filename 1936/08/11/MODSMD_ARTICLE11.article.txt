# Professor Asks for Home-Made Drama
## 
### 
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they
have gone to Grecian or Egyptian his
tory to find; one sees them designing
and building settings which will en
hance the mood of the play. Others
will be observed working out a charac
terization which will illuminate an idea
about people in relation to the con
temporary philosophy of conduct, or
silhouette a personality like Lincoln's
sharply against a background of chang
ing times and ideals.
A renaissance of the Fine Arts is
needed to stimulate our people and di
rect them toward a new culture. Poli
ticians make or break a state; true art
can only help and never hinder. Vari
ous agencies arc doing much—the Rec
reational and Community Centers, and
volunteer groups. Among the latter,
the theater groups are particularly out
standing.
Growth of Activity
Indeed, activity in various projects in j
dramatic art is far more prevalent than
is generally realized. Miss Myna B.
Hughes, who in 3934 made a survey of
the producing groups in California,
lists, in this slate alone, 165 busy organ
izations, distributed over 29 counties.
This fact is not surprising since theater
work is extremely absorbing. Because
of this it is a valuable means of turn
ing the mind away from cares, worries,
loneliness, boredom, sloth, misfortune,
and sorrow. It provides society with a
mental hygiene accessoi'y it cannot af
ford to neglect. Nor is it doing so.
Eager effort and talent are being ex
pended to develop regional drama,
often with meager results, unfortu
nately, because of inadequate resources,
or unsuitable and inconvenient meet
ing places.
Critics of the Little Theater often in
veigh against it for failure to live up to
its early promise and the accomplish
ments of the days when George Cram
Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill,
and others equally gifted made dra
matic history at Provincetown and on
MacDougall Street.
Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |
ing field.
Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.

Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they
have gone to Grecian or Egyptian his
tory to find; one sees them designing
and building settings which will en
hance the mood of the play. Others
will be observed working out a charac
terization which will illuminate an idea
about people in relation to the con
temporary philosophy of conduct, or
silhouette a personality like Lincoln's
sharply against a background of chang
ing times and ideals.
A renaissance of the Fine Arts is
needed to stimulate our people and di
rect them toward a new culture. Poli
ticians make or break a state; true art
can only help and never hinder. Vari
ous agencies arc doing much—the Rec
reational and Community Centers, and
volunteer groups. Among the latter,
the theater groups are particularly out
standing.
Growth of Activity
Indeed, activity in various projects in j
dramatic art is far more prevalent than
is generally realized. Miss Myna B.
Hughes, who in 3934 made a survey of
the producing groups in California,
lists, in this slate alone, 165 busy organ
izations, distributed over 29 counties.
This fact is not surprising since theater
work is extremely absorbing. Because
of this it is a valuable means of turn
ing the mind away from cares, worries,
loneliness, boredom, sloth, misfortune,
and sorrow. It provides society with a
mental hygiene accessoi'y it cannot af
ford to neglect. Nor is it doing so.
Eager effort and talent are being ex
pended to develop regional drama,
often with meager results, unfortu
nately, because of inadequate resources,
or unsuitable and inconvenient meet
ing places.
Critics of the Little Theater often in
veigh against it for failure to live up to
its early promise and the accomplish
ments of the days when George Cram
Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill,
and others equally gifted made dra
matic history at Provincetown and on
MacDougall Street.
Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |
ing field.

Eager effort and talent are being ex

Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j

Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they

tory to find; one sees them designing

Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they
have gone to Grecian or Egyptian his
tory to find; one sees them designing
and building settings which will en
hance the mood of the play. Others
will be observed working out a charac
terization which will illuminate an idea
about people in relation to the con
temporary philosophy of conduct, or
silhouette a personality like Lincoln's
sharply against a background of chang
ing times and ideals.
A renaissance of the Fine Arts is
needed to stimulate our people and di
rect them toward a new culture. Poli
ticians make or break a state; true art
can only help and never hinder. Vari
ous agencies arc doing much—the Rec
reational and Community Centers, and
volunteer groups. Among the latter,
the theater groups are particularly out
standing.
Growth of Activity
Indeed, activity in various projects in j
dramatic art is far more prevalent than
is generally realized. Miss Myna B.
Hughes, who in 3934 made a survey of
the producing groups in California,
lists, in this slate alone, 165 busy organ
izations, distributed over 29 counties.
This fact is not surprising since theater
work is extremely absorbing. Because
of this it is a valuable means of turn
ing the mind away from cares, worries,
loneliness, boredom, sloth, misfortune,
and sorrow. It provides society with a
mental hygiene accessoi'y it cannot af
ford to neglect. Nor is it doing so.
Eager effort and talent are being ex
pended to develop regional drama,
often with meager results, unfortu
nately, because of inadequate resources,
or unsuitable and inconvenient meet
ing places.
Critics of the Little Theater often in
veigh against it for failure to live up to
its early promise and the accomplish
ments of the days when George Cram
Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill,
and others equally gifted made dra
matic history at Provincetown and on
MacDougall Street.
Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |
ing field.
Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?

Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |

Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.
Last night, over station KGO during
| the Stanford Radio Hour, Miss Elisa-
I beth Loc Buckingham spoke on "Home
j Made Drama.' Miss Buckingham, who
is an associate professor of English
(Public Speaking), ':as long made the
little theater movement her hobby. The
text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes
to percolate a cup of coffee I am going
to try to share with you a hobby of a
life time and justify if possible my
| .faith in its value — namely, that of
| home-made drama of a high order for
; the West Coast. Any section of the
i country may of course develop a re
i gional drama, but I am naturally most
i vitally interested in the development of
I the particular belt in which I live, and
j I am assuming that my hearers are of
, like mind.
Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they
have gone to Grecian or Egyptian his
tory to find; one sees them designing
and building settings which will en
hance the mood of the play. Others
will be observed working out a charac
terization which will illuminate an idea
about people in relation to the con
temporary philosophy of conduct, or
silhouette a personality like Lincoln's
sharply against a background of chang
ing times and ideals.
A renaissance of the Fine Arts is
needed to stimulate our people and di
rect them toward a new culture. Poli
ticians make or break a state; true art
can only help and never hinder. Vari
ous agencies arc doing much—the Rec
reational and Community Centers, and
volunteer groups. Among the latter,
the theater groups are particularly out
standing.
Growth of Activity
Indeed, activity in various projects in j
dramatic art is far more prevalent than
is generally realized. Miss Myna B.
Hughes, who in 3934 made a survey of
the producing groups in California,
lists, in this slate alone, 165 busy organ
izations, distributed over 29 counties.
This fact is not surprising since theater
work is extremely absorbing. Because
of this it is a valuable means of turn
ing the mind away from cares, worries,
loneliness, boredom, sloth, misfortune,
and sorrow. It provides society with a
mental hygiene accessoi'y it cannot af
ford to neglect. Nor is it doing so.
Eager effort and talent are being ex
pended to develop regional drama,
often with meager results, unfortu
nately, because of inadequate resources,
or unsuitable and inconvenient meet
ing places.
Critics of the Little Theater often in
veigh against it for failure to live up to
its early promise and the accomplish
ments of the days when George Cram
Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill,
and others equally gifted made dra
matic history at Provincetown and on
MacDougall Street.

text of the speech follows in full:
In about the length of time it takes

Home Drama
This homely term "home - made
: drama refers to the native manifesta
tions of every phase of dramatic ac
i tivity—the writing of plays (particu
larly about the West—the sort of thing
Professor Koch has fostered in North
j Caroline), the building of local the-

J aters to stimulate achievement in all
I the arts, the acting and the production
of dramas in unstereotyped and unpre
tentious ways, the training of actors,
, directors, and scene designers, in
i schools and in adult groups, in fresh
and simplified techniques to enable
them to meet the demand for a culture
j of our own, and finally, the creation and
! perpetuation of large intelligently criti
cal and artistically appreciative audi-
I ences.
Many of us have long wished to see a
restoration to the West of its former
distinguished place in theater and dra
j ma. but we have done little more than
wish. The progressive spirit of the
day has dealt with drama in an isolated
; and fairly casual way. We have taken
what has come. But in our passivity
are we satisfied? There is greater dis
content than appears on the surface.
Ciood Old Days
Friends of the theater are weary of
I sighing for the fifty odd golden years
between 1853 and 190t> when the task
and discrimination of the West sharp
ened itself on the plays of Shakespeare,
Sheridan, and dramatic versions of By
; roil, Scott, and Dickens, on the acting

of Booth, Barrett, Forrest, Adelaide
Nielson, Modjeska, and a host of oth
ers playing in theaters as fine as any
| in the world to audiences notably re
j sponsive. Devotees of the theater arc
■■ weary of the refrain "where is the cul
ture of yesteryear?" They want some
thing to be proud of and busy with here
| and now.
In spite of an almost universal sup
| port and appreciation, too, of the better
| motion pictures, we have become rest
| less and bored by years of unrelieved
, impassive receptivity as audiences.
, Something more realistic than vocal
i cartoons is desired. We want to feel a
more human and close relation to the
I actors, to think of them as real human
beings with problems like our own. We
like to have the sense that we could call
to them across the footlights, or reach
a hand to them. We ourselves feel an
! impulse to get into the play ourselves.
The need actually to participate is
strong at the present time. The feeling
that we need to experience life more
richly— to savor it. to understand and
I conserve it in the midst of materialism
—is increasing.
There is evidence of this in the rap
idly developing interest of adults—
quiet home people who made no pre
tensions to artistry—in the community
theaters. There is an impulse on the
part of many to take a first-hand, vig
orous part in the various processes of
play-making. One sees them in the
costume room deeply engrossed in col
or combinations and designs which they
have gone to Grecian or Egyptian his
tory to find; one sees them designing
and building settings which will en
hance the mood of the play. Others
will be observed working out a charac
terization which will illuminate an idea
about people in relation to the con
temporary philosophy of conduct, or
silhouette a personality like Lincoln's
sharply against a background of chang
ing times and ideals.
A renaissance of the Fine Arts is
needed to stimulate our people and di
rect them toward a new culture. Poli
ticians make or break a state; true art
can only help and never hinder. Vari
ous agencies arc doing much—the Rec
reational and Community Centers, and
volunteer groups. Among the latter,
the theater groups are particularly out
standing.
Growth of Activity
Indeed, activity in various projects in j
dramatic art is far more prevalent than
is generally realized. Miss Myna B.
Hughes, who in 3934 made a survey of
the producing groups in California,
lists, in this slate alone, 165 busy organ
izations, distributed over 29 counties.
This fact is not surprising since theater
work is extremely absorbing. Because
of this it is a valuable means of turn
ing the mind away from cares, worries,
loneliness, boredom, sloth, misfortune,
and sorrow. It provides society with a
mental hygiene accessoi'y it cannot af
ford to neglect. Nor is it doing so.
Eager effort and talent are being ex
pended to develop regional drama,
often with meager results, unfortu
nately, because of inadequate resources,
or unsuitable and inconvenient meet
ing places.
Critics of the Little Theater often in
veigh against it for failure to live up to
its early promise and the accomplish
ments of the days when George Cram
Cook, Susan Glaspell, Eugene O'Neill,
and others equally gifted made dra
matic history at Provincetown and on
MacDougall Street.
Replies to Critics
But they forget to account for the
decline. They should point out the fact
that such leaders as these are only by
the merest chance associated together
in such an undertaking, and that for
the average situation it is necessary to
seek out and amply to reward leaders
of the like caliber. If the small theater
is relegated to the untrained volunteer
(who has neither professional pride nor
ambition, and is therefore casual and
lacking in force and vision) may we not
expect feeble, amateurish results?
Few persons of capability and talent
can be contented, for any but short pe
riods, with a hybrid task which is nei
ther a real job nor a mere hobby. The
work of the theater is hard work; it
demands a first-class education and
highly specialized, intensive training
in addition. The course at Yale is open
only to those who have an A.B. from
a college, and a certificate is given only
upon completion of the three years'
course.
Moreover, to achieve a real success,
such a graduate must possess a flash of
artistic genius, a talent at least, and be
willing to work unremittingly six days
a week, not only in the theater, but in
group meetings of many kinds. If he
can't get on with people, and if he
lacks a sense of humor, he may fail
even though he has passed all the other
tests. Isn't such an individual worth
his salary?
What Is Needed
The Little Theaters established by
a director with these qualifications,

! housed in an adequate building, and ]
' financed soundly have not failed. They J
have enlisted the support of the com- j
munity, and in notable examples em- ;
bodied in the Pasadena Community
Playhouse, the Lobero Theater, Santa j
Barbara, and the Community Play- !
house of Palo Alto, have attracted large j
( financial subsidies.
The less fortunately established units'
should be given backing and insurance ;
against bankruptcy in order that the
fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |
ing field.
Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.

fine energy, idealism, and zeal which j
initiated the enterprise may be objec- !
j tified and fulfilled in a worthy and sat- j
.isfying result. No such vital force
should be allowed to languish, but
should be built into the center of a
local recreational scheme in which any j
family can participate individually and j
together in a wholesome and stimulat- |
ing field.
Outlet for Youth
I have seen father, mother, and son !
all in a given pk»y, one as actor, one \
as scenic artist, and one as costumer. !
Those parents weren't worrying as to
where their son spent his evenings. The
stage has a fascination for youth. An
atmosphere of pleasurable excitement
pervades it. Hammers are busy in con
! structing palaces out of ply-board. It
is a place of magic and mystery. It cre
ates out of paint, canvas, words, move
ment, and mood something arresting—
perhaps beautiful—like a mirage real
in its unreality. Is there a better place
than a wisely planned and conducted
community theater for an adolescent
boy or girl to work through his uncer
tainties, his dreams, and his illusions to
reality? Jane Addams at Hull House
knew the answer.
In a recent motion picture appeared
an interesting account, with photogra
phy, of a convention in which were
amalgamated all organizations, such as
the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A., Scouts, etc.,
concerned with youth, for the purpose
of formulating a plan to combat the
! forces contributing to criminality in
minors. It was a determined group of
men and women, and for that reason, it
I is likely lo make itself felt.
I trust that in the assembly were per
sons who will see to it that boys and
girls who have in them a strain of
artistry will be given a chance to be in
plays in some capacity. The modern
stage is safer than the modern street.
Community and school theaters in
! which they may be placed will be ex
i pensive, of course. But, then, so are
j jails. Isn't it good economy to build
good theaters to help keep boys out of
; jail instead of building jails to put boys
in because their activities at a restless
period of life have not been properly
j directed?
Up to Public
Those of us who have studied what
a well-regulated local community has
to offer the people as a whole have long
wished for opportunities to bring the
entire question to them and their rep
resentatives in schools, welfare organi
zations, and in local and state govern
ments. We think a study of the possi
bilities will bring about a desire to give
some of these fine struggling organiza
tions a real opportunity to do something
constructive for every interested person
in its vicinity.
In short, I for one believe the time
j has come for us to try "home-made
j drama" for a while in every commu
! nity, large and small. Many persons
j consciously, and others unconsciously,

feel the need of settling down at home*
a bit and getting acquainted in a lei
surely way with neighbors and towns
men. We want to know something
about the local history and background;
we are dismayed at the thought of the
American home putting itself on wheels
and taking to the road decked out in
aluminum paint. "Why," we ask, "can't
someone write a play about all this and
let the rest of us act in it, or produce
it."
Every town and city has a lore of its
own—a pride. Texas., has her Alamo;
California's Santa Barbara has her mis
sion. The cities, San Diego, Los Ange
les, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Ta
coma are all rich in history and legend.
There is scarcely a village without its
own story or song. The drama of the
West can be of many kinds—strong and
epical, rough, rugged, colorful, or sim
ple and pastoral, if it will but be true
to the native themes.
Hidden Gold
Material for playwriting lies all about
us—the hidden gold of today—to be
mined and kept as a richer heritage
than that which was discovered at Sut
ter's Mill. Already, as Principal Thomas
P. Ryan informs me, the elementary
school children of Alum Rock, near San
Jose, have discovered this new golden
crop for themselves and have written a
play with John Marshall as hero, en
titled "The Discovery of Gold, or One
Cold January Morning." Truly, the
schools seem to be dramatic minded in
the best sense. Children combine the
practical and the romantic most skill
fully, and this is advantageous to their
dramatizations.
