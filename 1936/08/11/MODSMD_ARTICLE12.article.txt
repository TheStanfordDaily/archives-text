The bats relinquished their lease
on the midnight watch of the Assembly
Hall to the cast of "Antony and Cleo
patra," who took over the old hall
I Sunday night for dress rehearsal.
While coffee percolated in the wings

lookers, most of them connected with

wee hour draughts but clung tena-

The main dining room of the
Stanford Union will serve a spe
cial luncheon and dinner on Sat
urday, August 15. for the con
venience of those attending the
performances of "Caesar and
Cleopatra" in the afternoon and
"Antony and Cleopatra" in the
evening, according to a statement

Kicker, director of University
dining halls.

direction, and stage arrangements in
preparation for Thursday night's op
j ening of the Shakespeare play.
Early Sunday evening, costumes
were donned and members of the cast
i made ready to make their way through
; the play. Under the surveillance of
Dr. Margery Bailey, executive director
of the Course in Stage Classics Pro
, duction and Mr. Robert Brauns, di
l rector of "Antony and Cleopatra," the
J cast went through their lines and ac

! night came to an end.
Stage Director Busy
Miss Margaret Storey scampered
about the stage in an effort to keep
up with the changes in the position of
| the various properties. Up high on the
■ balcony a battery of amplifiers and re
cording equipment underwent adjust

iginal music written for the production
by Adolph Hanson. In the electrician's
booth, cues were being rehearsed for
! the various lighting effects. And on the
stage the brilliant sets of Carroll Al
exander shone radiantly.
And so far into the night, the cast in
I their striking costumes, designed by
Miss Helen Green of the Shakespeare
Guild of America, who won such high
commendation for the costumes in last,
summer's production of "Othello,"
played their play to an eery silent
j house—but not too silent to retort with
I eloquent damnation when things
slowed up.
Advance Seat Sale Good
But it won't be a particularly eery
1 house that will greet the pcrform
-1 ance on Thursday's opening, accord
| ing to comment emanating from the
I A.S.S.U. office. Tickets, they say, are
I enjoying a good advance sale, distrib
uted equally between the two attrac
i tions—"Antony and Cleopatra," by
Shakespeare, and Shaw's "Caesar and
Cleopatra," which is to be presented
Friday evening and Saturday after
i noon under the direction of James
Sandoe.
Last night the dress rehearsal of
"Caesar and Cleopatra" was held, and
the same procedure was followed to
make sure of the multitude of details
in stage work, set arrangement, and
1 direction that go into the preparation
of any play production.
