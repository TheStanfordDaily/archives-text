"The faculty have been highly
pleased with the increase in enroll- j
rnent, the competence of the student I
group, and the quality of work done
by students in the School of Educa
tion this summer," stated Dean Gray
son N. Kefauver. This week will cul
minate the eight weeks' work of 325
students enrolled in the School of Edu
cation.
Dean Kefauver further said that he
appreciated the increase in the number
of advanced graduate students and
their high academic standing. Of the
325 enrolled in contrast to the 254 of
last summer the majority arc working
toward advanced degrees.
Dean Kefauver stated earlier in the
quarter that the department would
continue to tighten the standards of
scholarship on the basis of more selec
tivity and attempt to admit only those
whose qualifications were outstanding.
