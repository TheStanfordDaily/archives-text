# "Bury the Dead" Wins Applause
## 
### 
The Sword and Sandals reading of
"Bury the Dead," tense, dramatic
staccato opus of youthful football
hero-playwright-scenario writer Ir
win Shaw, was received favorably by
two successive capacity audiences at
the Little Theater last Friday evening.
The play, picturing the contratemps
caused by the refusal to be buried of
six soldiers slain in "The War Which
Is To Begin Tomorrow night," is
marked by brilliant flashes of telling
irony. This effective and relatively
novel handling of pacifist propaganda
is only occasionally marred by relapse
into rather sentimental melodrama.
The introduction of the somewhat ir
relevant strain of social bitterness de
tracts from the main theme and weak
ens the play's conclusion.
The interpretation of the individual
parts by the reading group was good
throughout, and in a few cases excel
lent. It is a tribute to the skill of the
renditions that no confusion resulted
from the manifold roles of several of
the group, necessitated by the large
cast of characters. Excellent timing
enhanced the natural speed and dra
matic qualities of the work, and swept
the audience thoroughly into the spirit
intended by the author.â€”R.A.O.
