### TRO HARPER 
When I heard Gilman Gist was going
to be an actor in the Stage Classics
production of "Antony and Cleopatra,"
I dropped everything I was doing and
rushed around to see him, not because
he is a great actor (there seem to be
some doubts in his mind as to this),
but because he is perhaps one of the
most versatile gents on this or any
other campus.
Mr. Gist knows more about art and
its various whys and wherefores than
nearly anyone around these parts,
probably more than any student his
age in the country. During the course
of his somewhat stormy career, he
figures he has done almost five to ten
thousand drawings.
"A remarkable number," he says,
"for one who has improved so little in
18 years."
Not only has he been a painter of
water colors, molder of clay models,
wood-blocker, illustrator, cartoonist,
Christmas card and program designer,
but also he has acted, played football,
clowned, and will be, in* the near fu
ture, an editor of a funny magazine
called the Chaparral. "I also draw
some very fine checks," he says.
Mr. Gist now lives in San Diego, but
he explained that he is really quite a
globe trotter, having lived in Los An
geles, San Francisco, New London,
Conn., New York City, and Panama.
Whenever he travels he says he
usually takes along a whole trunk or
so full of paints, pencils, linoleum
blocks, easels, papers, brushes, chis
els, and a camera, all of which he usu
ally leaves well packed until he
reaches home again, principally be
cause, as he says, "I'd rather enjoy
life."
When I asked Mr. Gist just how he
got started on his career and who he
blames for his talents, he told me how
his father used to draw funny little
animals to amuse him, while his moth
er sat at one side molding small men
which were also meant to amuse him.
His own creations began to jump
around on paper at the age of four,
when he calmly sketched a picture of
his aunt rocking in a chair. He says
this was his best cartoon.
As soon as he graduates from Stan
ford, which should be some time
toward the end of next quarter, he ex
pects to go into art work with a bang.
Just now he is busy getting ideas for
Christmas cards.
Last year or the year before some of
his friends asked him to make them a
few cards so, having nothing better to
do and being a little short on money
for the rent, he dashed off a couple, but
now it has grown and grown until last

year he sold over 5000 copies. He even
went so far as to call them Gist mas
cards. His idea, he says, is to bring
Christmas cards up to date, make them
funny, and in short really spread a
little Christmas cheer in a sensible
way.
This year his best card to date is the
picture of a little monk, complacently ;
reading a book by the light of his j
neon halo. "1 like to make them dif- |
ferent," he says.
Acting has long been one of Mr. j
Gist's loves, ever since he used to be |
in grammar school. In his grammar
school days, he tells of how he used to
be the little boy who always drank his !
milk. Everything used to go along
fine until the last act, when he really
had to drink the milk.
"Five years ago," he says, "I was j
also a star in an operetta. After the ,
performance was over the mayor came j
up and shook my hand, but afterwards
I learned he was a bum, so now I |
rarely mention the incident."
His prime ambition in life is to grow
a beard, but to date he hasn't had .
much luck, but remembering George
Bernard Shaw didn't have a beard un- |
til he was 23, he still has hopes.
All in all, I'd say Mr. Gist was one I
of our more interesting people. |

"Five years ago," he says, "I was j
also a star in an operetta. After the ,
performance was over the mayor came j
up and shook my hand, but afterwards
I learned he was a bum, so now I |
rarely mention the incident."
His prime ambition in life is to grow
a beard, but to date he hasn't had .
much luck, but remembering George
Bernard Shaw didn't have a beard un- |
til he was 23, he still has hopes.
All in all, I'd say Mr. Gist was one I
of our more interesting people. |
When I heard Gilman Gist was going
to be an actor in the Stage Classics
production of "Antony and Cleopatra,"
I dropped everything I was doing and
rushed around to see him, not because
he is a great actor (there seem to be
some doubts in his mind as to this),
but because he is perhaps one of the
most versatile gents on this or any
other campus.
Mr. Gist knows more about art and
its various whys and wherefores than
nearly anyone around these parts,
probably more than any student his
age in the country. During the course
of his somewhat stormy career, he
figures he has done almost five to ten
thousand drawings.
"A remarkable number," he says,
"for one who has improved so little in
18 years."
Not only has he been a painter of
water colors, molder of clay models,
wood-blocker, illustrator, cartoonist,
Christmas card and program designer,
but also he has acted, played football,
clowned, and will be, in* the near fu
ture, an editor of a funny magazine
called the Chaparral. "I also draw
some very fine checks," he says.
Mr. Gist now lives in San Diego, but
he explained that he is really quite a
globe trotter, having lived in Los An
geles, San Francisco, New London,
Conn., New York City, and Panama.
Whenever he travels he says he
usually takes along a whole trunk or
so full of paints, pencils, linoleum
blocks, easels, papers, brushes, chis
els, and a camera, all of which he usu
ally leaves well packed until he
reaches home again, principally be
cause, as he says, "I'd rather enjoy
life."
When I asked Mr. Gist just how he
got started on his career and who he
blames for his talents, he told me how
his father used to draw funny little
animals to amuse him, while his moth
er sat at one side molding small men
which were also meant to amuse him.
His own creations began to jump
around on paper at the age of four,
when he calmly sketched a picture of
his aunt rocking in a chair. He says
this was his best cartoon.
As soon as he graduates from Stan
ford, which should be some time
toward the end of next quarter, he ex
pects to go into art work with a bang.
Just now he is busy getting ideas for
Christmas cards.
Last year or the year before some of
his friends asked him to make them a
few cards so, having nothing better to
do and being a little short on money
for the rent, he dashed off a couple, but
now it has grown and grown until last

year he sold over 5000 copies. He even
went so far as to call them Gist mas
cards. His idea, he says, is to bring
Christmas cards up to date, make them
funny, and in short really spread a
little Christmas cheer in a sensible
way.
This year his best card to date is the
picture of a little monk, complacently ;
reading a book by the light of his j
neon halo. "1 like to make them dif- |
ferent," he says.
Acting has long been one of Mr. j
Gist's loves, ever since he used to be |
in grammar school. In his grammar
school days, he tells of how he used to
be the little boy who always drank his !
milk. Everything used to go along
fine until the last act, when he really
had to drink the milk.
"Five years ago," he says, "I was j
also a star in an operetta. After the ,
performance was over the mayor came j

picture of a little monk, complacently ;
reading a book by the light of his j

ferent," he says.
Acting has long been one of Mr. j
Gist's loves, ever since he used to be |
in grammar school. In his grammar
school days, he tells of how he used to
be the little boy who always drank his !
milk. Everything used to go along
fine until the last act, when he really
had to drink the milk.
"Five years ago," he says, "I was j
also a star in an operetta. After the ,
performance was over the mayor came j
up and shook my hand, but afterwards
I learned he was a bum, so now I |
rarely mention the incident."
His prime ambition in life is to grow
a beard, but to date he hasn't had .
much luck, but remembering George
Bernard Shaw didn't have a beard un- |
til he was 23, he still has hopes.
All in all, I'd say Mr. Gist was one I
of our more interesting people. |
