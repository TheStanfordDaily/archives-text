"Suzy" is a surprise angle that MGM
has hit upon in presenting Jean Har
low to the public in face of the extreme
censoring which her pictures usually
cause. As never before she is the sub
dued and suffering element in the pic
ture, highly noble, and the left-at
home member of the eternal triangle.
Some preposterous heights are
reached when Cary Grant is made to
desert Harlow for a rather ordinary
looking brunette, Benita Hume. But
Grant is cast as a Frenchman who al
ways has one at home and one on the
run. From her end of the situation
Harlow is loved by Franchot Tone but
it is for Grant that she does all her
sacrificing and charms her way into
the affections of his aristocratic father,
Lewis Stone. Stone is admirable in a
sustained and highly repressed part.
His is one of the truly grand perform
ances, although Harlow and Tone ap
pear at their best. There are some in
dications in this picture that Miss Har
low is deserving of the title of actress.
The new personality that she develops
is atonement for her past character
izations of high emotion and sensuous
ness.
Chief of her new acting appurte
nances is a trick smile which Miss
1 Harlow employs in face of every dis
heartening situation. She is also quite
effective with her tears. But she still

talks very fast and very nasal, some
what detracting from an otherwise
good bit of acting.

As to the future, one does not predict
in economic sciences as in physical
sciences. â€” Frances Perkins, Secretary
of Labor.
