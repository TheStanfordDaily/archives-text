# Pacific Institute Opens Friday
## President Wilbur Heads California Delegation 
### 
Dr. Carl S. Alsberg of Stanford, in
the capacity of chairman of the Amer
ican Council of the Pacific Relations
Institute, has left for Yosemite to swing
into readiness the Tenth Session of the
Sixth Pacific Institute to which this
year the United States is host.
Other Stanford men who will attend
the two-week meeting beginning next
Saturday are President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, chairman of the California
delegation; Dr. J. S. Davis, of the
Food Research Institute; and Mr. Ho
bart Young, who is in charge of local
arrangements in connection with the
meeting.
Newton D. Baker Heads Delegation
The American delegation is headed
by Mr. Newton D. Baker, who will
receive representatives from the Pa
cific, Australia, New Zealand, the Phil
ippines, China, Japan, and Soviet
Russia.
It is the intent of this organization
to discuss the problems of the Pacific.
Representatives from powers possess
ing colonial interests in the Pacific,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, and
France, as well as the League of Na
tions and from the International Labor
Office will also be in attendance.
Especially significant is this meeting
now at a time when conditions both in
Europe and the Pacific are extremely
tense. The institute since its organ
ization in 1925 has been an advocate
of efforts to thresh out the problems of
the nations of the Pacific across the
conference table to arrive at peaceful
solutions.
At the first meeting in Hawaii so
cial and religious workers and aca
demic men and women attended in an
effort "to study the conditions of the
Pacific peoples with a view to the im
provement of their mutual relations."
A number of conferences have been
held by the local group under the
chairmanship of Dr. Wilbur to co
ordinate the various problems to be
discussed in Yosemite. The topics that
will receive attention are of utmost
importance to all the people bordering
on the Pacific. Another item of inter
est is the fact that this is the first time
a delegation from Soviet Russia has at
tended the meetings of the institute.
