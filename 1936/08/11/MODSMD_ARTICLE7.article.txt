United Press Staff Correspondent
BURGOS, Spain, Aug. B.—A few
weeks ago, when I left Stanford, the
biggest and most exciting story I had
ever handled was a football game for
the school paper.
Now here I am in one jump of
j 6000 miles covering the story of a
real war and dodging bullets as I
! run United Press stories back through
i the rebel lines to the French frontier,
j I have become used to the sound of
whizzing bullets and cannonading and
to the sight of wounded men and scat
tered corpses.
I don't know much about the tactical
j side of this war business or who is
winning, but I have been impressed
j by the way in which General Emilio
I Mola, the northern rebel leader, is
! throwing thousands of raw recruits—
j many of them youngsters not as old as
I am—against trained government
I soldiers.
Volunteers Want Madrid
For two weeks, these untrained vol
unteers, mostly swarthy youths from
| farms and villages, have been march
ing along, shouting "Madrid or die."
The enthusiasm of these youths to
j kill or be killed is sometimes more
| dangerous to others than the enemy,
because they handle rifles as though
they were popguns.
When the revolution broke out, the
war spirit spread like a flood over the
: farming areas of the Pyrenees valleys
; which slope toward Madrid. It swept
almost every man and boy from the
fields of Navarre province.
Reapers were left standing in the
half-cut fields as the workers streamed
to Pamplona, capital of Navarre, to
sign up in the rebel cause. They were
gay with the buoyancy of Latin youth
| then. Now after two weeks their faces
| are drawn by fatigue and their expres
[ sions are grim. They know what war
is like now.
Wear Red Berets
There are no uniforms for these
! youths, so they wear red berets and
; Fascist or royalist arm bands. As they
! march along with rifles slung from
I their shoulders, they are cheered
j wildly from balconies and sidewalk
| cafes.
As I rush United Press dispatches
i back and forth between Burgos and
j Hendaye, I encounter many of these
' youngsters, some of whom arc sentries
who stop me and ask to see my mil
| itary pass. Many of them cannot read
j the pass, Spain having one of the high
est percentages of illiteracy in Europe.
They will not admit that they can
not read, so after some grumbling, to
show their authority, they let me pass.
Water, cooled from 39.5 degrees to
32 degrees Fahrenheit, expands one
eleventh of its volume.

the school paper.

real war and dodging bullets as I

j I have become used to the sound of
whizzing bullets and cannonading and
