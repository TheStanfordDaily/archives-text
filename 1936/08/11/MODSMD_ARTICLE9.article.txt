# Crawford Will Speak on Radio
## Centralization of State Government Is Topic 
### 
The increasingly complex problems
of centralization in government will
be discussed by Dr. Finla GofT Craw
ford, acting professor of political sci
ence at Stanford University, in a radio
talk on "Centralizationâ€”the Future of
Our State Government" to be given
over KGO next Monday at 7:15 p.m.
"This question of centralization will
not be settled in a day or a decade be
cause its history is an old one and its
present manifestations are too compli
cated," Dr. Crawford said today.
"Since 1828 the problem of increas
ing power in the hands of central gov
ernments has been of importance in
American politics," he declared.
A visiting professor at Stanford this
summer, Dr. Crawford has been pro
fessor in the School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs at Syracuse University
since 1921.
