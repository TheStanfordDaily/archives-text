# Stanford Dean Returns From European Tour
## Miss Yost, Miss Almond Travel on Continent and In England, Balearic Isles 
### 
After many exciting experiences in
warlike Europe, Dean Mary Yost re
turned to the campus this week. Miss
Yost was accompanied by Miss Nina
Almond, librarian of the Hoover War
Library. The two have been touring
the Continent since January.
Disaster was close on their heels
during most of their travels, but they
miraculously managed to stay ahead of
outbreaks in Spain and other coun
tries. The nearest they came to any
real misfortune was when their bag
gage was lost somewhere between
Barcelona and Paris.
Stayed in Balacrics
Miss Yost and Miss Almond spent the
first two months of their vacation in
the Balearic Islands, and declare that
was the most peaceful place visited.
Now, those islands are being torn to
pieces by bombs in the Spanish civil
war. Parma and Puerto Pollensa, a
fishing village in the islands, the trav
elers found especially interesting. The
inhabitants are conservative, dignified,
friendly, and self-respecting peasants,
who are now suffering because of their
conservatism.
Visited Madrid
Just after Easter, Miss Yost and Miss
Almond wore in Madrid witnessing a
military procession. The quiet was
suddenly broken by a bomb bursting
in the midst of the display. However,
the Californians were not near the
point where the attack occurred.
In Toledo they met Aurelio M. Es
pinosa Jr., son of Dr. and Mrs. A. M.
Espinosa of Stanford, who took them
on a tour of Old Spain.
Tension in France
According to Dean Yost the most
tension was expressed in France. Other
places presented a smooth surface, but
the tourists were upset by a number
of irritating conditions in France. Now
the tension has broken and the coun
try is ravaged with strikes and polit
ical strife.
At Nice the Stanford wanderers met
Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Swain, also
from the University, who accompanied
them on a motor trip through northern
Italy. There they found most of the
residents were enthusiastic about Fas
cism. Signs stencilled on village houses
over Mussolini's signature reading,
"Believe, Obey, Fight," appalled the
tourists.
Bologna Socialistic
When Addis Ababa fell to the Ital
ian invaders, Miss Yost and her com
panion were in Bologna. Dean Yost
reports that although the residents
were required to gather in the town
square for a demonstration, they
seemed uninterested in the radio re
port from Rome. Later she learned
that the lack of jubilance was due to
the fact that Bologna is a Socialist
ccnter and is still resentful to Fascism.
One of the highlights of the trip was
their visit to the last meeting of the
League of Nations Council in May.
Miss Yost declares that the most dra
matic thing at the meeting was the va
cant seat of Italy.
Motored Through England
After a visit in Paris they went to
England. Before leaving Stanford,
Dean Yost had expressed her desire to
take a motor trip over England. This
desire was culminated in a tour of
Southern England in an Austin that
was supposed to make 30 miles per
hour. Dean Yost laughingly recalls
that this wonderful auto was able to
make only 25 miles an hour at top
speed, in spite of its reputation.
The traveling companions parted at
New York, as Miss Almond returned
directly to California. Miss Yost spent
some time visiting relatives 'in the
East. She will not be in her office un
til after September 1.
Enthused by Miss Yost's reports of
her trip. Miss Elizabeth Mar Clarke,
her secretary, is already on her way to
retrace some of the route covered by
Dean Yost. She sailed from New York
last week, and plans to join Miss Laura
Lorraine, Stanford graduate, in South
ampton. They will tour England and
Scotland, then Miss Clarke will go to
the Continent. In October and Novem
her she will study at the London
School of Economics, and will not re
turn to the campus until the fall of
1937.

during most of their travels, but they
miraculously managed to stay ahead of
outbreaks in Spain and other coun
tries. The nearest they came to any
real misfortune was when their bag
gage was lost somewhere between
Barcelona and Paris.
Stayed in Balacrics
Miss Yost and Miss Almond spent the
first two months of their vacation in
the Balearic Islands, and declare that
was the most peaceful place visited.
Now, those islands are being torn to
pieces by bombs in the Spanish civil
war. Parma and Puerto Pollensa, a
fishing village in the islands, the trav
elers found especially interesting. The
inhabitants are conservative, dignified,
friendly, and self-respecting peasants,
who are now suffering because of their
conservatism.
Visited Madrid
Just after Easter, Miss Yost and Miss
Almond wore in Madrid witnessing a
military procession. The quiet was
suddenly broken by a bomb bursting
in the midst of the display. However,
the Californians were not near the
point where the attack occurred.
In Toledo they met Aurelio M. Es
pinosa Jr., son of Dr. and Mrs. A. M.
Espinosa of Stanford, who took them
on a tour of Old Spain.
Tension in France
According to Dean Yost the most
tension was expressed in France. Other
places presented a smooth surface, but
the tourists were upset by a number
of irritating conditions in France. Now
the tension has broken and the coun
try is ravaged with strikes and polit
ical strife.
At Nice the Stanford wanderers met
Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Swain, also
from the University, who accompanied
them on a motor trip through northern
Italy. There they found most of the
residents were enthusiastic about Fas
cism. Signs stencilled on village houses
over Mussolini's signature reading,
"Believe, Obey, Fight," appalled the
tourists.
Bologna Socialistic
When Addis Ababa fell to the Ital
ian invaders, Miss Yost and her com
panion were in Bologna. Dean Yost
reports that although the residents
were required to gather in the town
square for a demonstration, they
seemed uninterested in the radio re
port from Rome. Later she learned
that the lack of jubilance was due to
the fact that Bologna is a Socialist
ccnter and is still resentful to Fascism.
One of the highlights of the trip was
their visit to the last meeting of the
League of Nations Council in May.
Miss Yost declares that the most dra
matic thing at the meeting was the va
cant seat of Italy.
Motored Through England
After a visit in Paris they went to
England. Before leaving Stanford,
Dean Yost had expressed her desire to
take a motor trip over England. This
desire was culminated in a tour of
Southern England in an Austin that
was supposed to make 30 miles per
hour. Dean Yost laughingly recalls
that this wonderful auto was able to
make only 25 miles an hour at top
speed, in spite of its reputation.
The traveling companions parted at
New York, as Miss Almond returned
directly to California. Miss Yost spent
some time visiting relatives 'in the
East. She will not be in her office un
til after September 1.
Enthused by Miss Yost's reports of
her trip. Miss Elizabeth Mar Clarke,
her secretary, is already on her way to
retrace some of the route covered by
Dean Yost. She sailed from New York
last week, and plans to join Miss Laura
Lorraine, Stanford graduate, in South
ampton. They will tour England and
Scotland, then Miss Clarke will go to
the Continent. In October and Novem
her she will study at the London
School of Economics, and will not re
turn to the campus until the fall of
1937.
After many exciting experiences in
warlike Europe, Dean Mary Yost re
turned to the campus this week. Miss
Yost was accompanied by Miss Nina
Almond, librarian of the Hoover War
Library. The two have been touring
the Continent since January.
Disaster was close on their heels
during most of their travels, but they
miraculously managed to stay ahead of
outbreaks in Spain and other coun
