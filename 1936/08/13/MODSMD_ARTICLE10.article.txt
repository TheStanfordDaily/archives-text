# Summer Plays Open Tonight
## "Antony and Cleopatra" Is Billed Tops This Evening 'Serpent of the Nile' Was Frivolous Girl, Says G. B. Shaw of Cleopatra 
### 
Campus theater-goers, Shaw and
Shakespeare bound the next few days,
! will see interesting contrast between
I "Antony and Cleopatra" and "Caesar
I and Cleopatra."
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra" is a
j play in the best Shavian manner. It
| provides for no personality inflation,

debunking history of its dusty dignity.
So Shaw's work, which will be pre
sented in the assembly hall tomorrow
evening and Saturday afternoon, will
humanize history and attempt to show,
like Barton, that Caesar was a Ro
tarian.
This will all be an interesting con
trast to the comparative ritual and
pageantry of the Shakespearean play
being presented tonight. After all,
Shaw reasons, Caesar was a pretty un
derstanding and very human person.
Why be so patronizing about it all?
Shaw has little patience with women,
in or out of history. Ellen Terry taught
him that. Shaw reveals the "Serpent
of the Nile," Cleopatra, as just a silly,
except possibly that of Shaw himself.
You might say, Shaw, in his play, is
frivolous little girl who attains to the
queenship of Egypt not through any
aristocratic heritage but through the
good advice of Julius Caesar.
But through it all Shaw must in
trude—or protrude. He is not the one
to let an opening for a good nasty gag
pass on. He snickers and sneers at the
smugness of late nineteenth century
English society through the medium
of Brittanius—the personification of
that society.
The chief difference between the two
plays—Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra" and Shaw's "Caesar and
Cleopatra"—is in the treatment. "An
tony and Cleopatra" is tragedy, "Cacv
sar and Cleopatra" is comedy—indeed,
a comic treatment of history. All
through the Shaw play there is the
touch of a day nearer ours. Shaw is
writing in the modern idiom.
