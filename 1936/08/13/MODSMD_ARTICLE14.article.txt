Mr. Brauns, when last seen,
was making his way out of the
Palo Alto wilds with his latest
prey. This time its a Macaw—a
North American genus of parrot,
you dopes—which he extracted
from an Emerson Street shop
window—with permission of its
keeper.
The bird, one of the few birds
to be recorded present at the act
ing end of any footlights, will
make an exclusive appearance in
"Antony and Cleopatra" tonight
and Saturday evening.
