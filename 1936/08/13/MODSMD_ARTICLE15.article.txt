# The 						Religion of the Inarticulate
## 
### D. E. TRUEBLOOD 
Chaplain of the Stanford Memorial
Church
It is now nearly 20 years since a rela
tively obscure young British officer,
named Donald Hankey, was killed in
action on the Western front, but, in
spite of the lapse of years, it is to
certain words of his that I turn as I
consider my task in Stanford Univer
sity. This young British officer found
time during the agony of the war to
write some surprisingly original essays
which were published with an intro
duction by the editor of "The Specta
tor."
One of Donald Hankey's essays has
as its title "The Religion of the In
articulate." Kis thesis was that the
ordinary soldier, though he considered
himself irreligious and certainly had
no time for theologians or priests, had
in reality a deeply religious attitude
toward life. Through the intimacy of
the barracks room, it was possible to
discover some of the characteristics of
this unformed and inarticulate faith
"and, after all," concluded the essay
ist, "it did.not necessarily follow that
because a man was inarticulate he
therefore had no religion." Two things,
it was suggested, give us an insight
into the real faith of men. These are,
first, their actions, and, second, their
objects of admiration.
The average university man or wom
an today is in very much the position
of the soldiers when Hankey knew at
the front. The acids of modernity and
of sophistication have eaten away from
most minds the last remnants of a
merely superstitious faith and it often
seems that nothing is left. My experi
ence with university students indicates
to me that something of great im
portance remains. In regard to ac
tions, the most revealing facts relate

[ not to what men do, but to what they ]
J refuse to do. It would seem that there!
are no persons who do not have at the
i center of their lives what may be called j
; "splendid incapacities." There are
, depths to which men will not sink no
matter what the gain may appear to be.
Here is our starting point and from
J it we should be able to go on to a
| cogent statement of those things by
| which men really live. The objects of
admiration are equally important. It is
interesting to note that whether or not j
I men are themselves veracious they are
| very quick to condemn any failure in
veracity and give their highest ad-
I miration to those marked by dependa
bility and integrity.
Veracity Admired
i Even the supposedly irreligious are j
extremely quick to see through any
one who pretends to be better than he
i is, and to admire the one who demon
| strates some equality between his
| do so admire the life of veracity, that
; claims and his actions. Now if people
is simply another way of saying that
they count it pre-eminently worth
while. This also then is one of the
points that is fixed and stable, and
] from it we can move out in the build-
I ing of a reasonable faith.
It is my conviction that there is a
i great deal which goes on in the world
| which has about it a religious quality,
| though it has absolutely no connection
I with churches, scriptures, or stated pe
| riods of worship. The worst enemy of
| real religion is the supposition that re
j ligion is something separated from life.
' Task To Demonstrate
Our task is to demonstrate that kind
of religion which can sanctify com
mon life anywhere and is as likely to
| be found in the fraternity house, the
c dormitory, or the classroom, as well as
1 th? altar. This !s not to say, however,

that the practice of regular worship is
unimportant. Indeed, our religious ef
forts alone are for the most part feeble
ones, and we need greatly the strength
that comes from corporate worship.
The problem, then, is not whether we
shall have the religion which glori
fies the commonplace, on the one hand,
or the religion which joins in wor
ship, on the other hand. The truth is
that each helps the other. If our com
mon life has been shot through with
spiritual meaning, our worship will be
more valuable to us, and, if we have
engaged with regularity in the expe
rience of worship, it is more easy to
see meaning in common life.
In seeking to discover and fortify the
religion of the inarticulate in a great
university our purpose should be
marked by unity of action in every de
tail. We should avoid over-lapping
wherever possible and produce a
united front on the problems of spir
itual life.
Chapel Is Neutral
It is hoped that the various organ
izations on the campus, including the
denominational clubs, will all join in a
single program. Since the Memorial
Church is neutral ground, denomina
tionally, there is no reason why all
groups should hesitate to unite in it.
The Vestry will be used as a lobby and
reading room, as well as conference
room for all who care to use it. Small
groups who have no other place to meet
should feel free to make use of the fa
cilities thus afforded.
The problems of the spiritual life in
the University are so great and the
task so important that no effort should
be wasted by any failure in co-ordina
tion. What we need at Stanford is a
united religious work and the task of
this work is to make the religion of the
inarticulate articulate.

task so important that no effort should
be wasted by any failure in co-ordina
tion. What we need at Stanford is a
united religious work and the task of
this work is to make the religion of the
inarticulate articulate.
Chaplain of the Stanford Memorial

It is now nearly 20 years since a rela
tively obscure young British officer,
named Donald Hankey, was killed in
action on the Western front, but, in
spite of the lapse of years, it is to
certain words of his that I turn as I
consider my task in Stanford Univer
sity. This young British officer found
time during the agony of the war to
write some surprisingly original essays
which were published with an intro
duction by the editor of "The Specta
tor."
One of Donald Hankey's essays has
as its title "The Religion of the In
articulate." Kis thesis was that the
ordinary soldier, though he considered
himself irreligious and certainly had
no time for theologians or priests, had
in reality a deeply religious attitude
toward life. Through the intimacy of
the barracks room, it was possible to
discover some of the characteristics of
this unformed and inarticulate faith
"and, after all," concluded the essay
ist, "it did.not necessarily follow that
because a man was inarticulate he
therefore had no religion." Two things,
it was suggested, give us an insight
into the real faith of men. These are,
first, their actions, and, second, their
objects of admiration.
The average university man or wom
an today is in very much the position
of the soldiers when Hankey knew at
the front. The acids of modernity and
of sophistication have eaten away from
most minds the last remnants of a
merely superstitious faith and it often
seems that nothing is left. My experi
ence with university students indicates
to me that something of great im
portance remains. In regard to ac
tions, the most revealing facts relate

[ not to what men do, but to what they ]
J refuse to do. It would seem that there!
are no persons who do not have at the
i center of their lives what may be called j
; "splendid incapacities." There are
, depths to which men will not sink no
matter what the gain may appear to be.
Here is our starting point and from
J it we should be able to go on to a
| cogent statement of those things by
| which men really live. The objects of
admiration are equally important. It is
interesting to note that whether or not j
I men are themselves veracious they are
| very quick to condemn any failure in
veracity and give their highest ad-
I miration to those marked by dependa
bility and integrity.
Veracity Admired
i Even the supposedly irreligious are j
extremely quick to see through any
one who pretends to be better than he
i is, and to admire the one who demon
| strates some equality between his
| do so admire the life of veracity, that
; claims and his actions. Now if people
is simply another way of saying that
they count it pre-eminently worth
while. This also then is one of the
points that is fixed and stable, and
] from it we can move out in the build-
I ing of a reasonable faith.
It is my conviction that there is a
i great deal which goes on in the world
| which has about it a religious quality,
| though it has absolutely no connection
I with churches, scriptures, or stated pe
| riods of worship. The worst enemy of
| real religion is the supposition that re
j ligion is something separated from life.
' Task To Demonstrate
Our task is to demonstrate that kind
of religion which can sanctify com
mon life anywhere and is as likely to
| be found in the fraternity house, the
c dormitory, or the classroom, as well as
1 th? altar. This !s not to say, however,

that the practice of regular worship is
unimportant. Indeed, our religious ef
forts alone are for the most part feeble
ones, and we need greatly the strength
that comes from corporate worship.
The problem, then, is not whether we
shall have the religion which glori
fies the commonplace, on the one hand,
or the religion which joins in wor
ship, on the other hand. The truth is
that each helps the other. If our com
mon life has been shot through with
spiritual meaning, our worship will be
more valuable to us, and, if we have
engaged with regularity in the expe
rience of worship, it is more easy to
see meaning in common life.
In seeking to discover and fortify the
religion of the inarticulate in a great
university our purpose should be
marked by unity of action in every de
tail. We should avoid over-lapping
wherever possible and produce a
united front on the problems of spir
itual life.
Chapel Is Neutral
It is hoped that the various organ
izations on the campus, including the
denominational clubs, will all join in a
single program. Since the Memorial
Church is neutral ground, denomina
tionally, there is no reason why all
groups should hesitate to unite in it.
The Vestry will be used as a lobby and
reading room, as well as conference
room for all who care to use it. Small
groups who have no other place to meet
should feel free to make use of the fa
cilities thus afforded.

It is now nearly 20 years since a rela
tively obscure young British officer,
named Donald Hankey, was killed in
action on the Western front, but, in
spite of the lapse of years, it is to
certain words of his that I turn as I
consider my task in Stanford Univer
sity. This young British officer found
time during the agony of the war to
write some surprisingly original essays
which were published with an intro
duction by the editor of "The Specta
tor."
One of Donald Hankey's essays has
as its title "The Religion of the In
articulate." Kis thesis was that the
ordinary soldier, though he considered
himself irreligious and certainly had
no time for theologians or priests, had
in reality a deeply religious attitude
toward life. Through the intimacy of
the barracks room, it was possible to
discover some of the characteristics of
this unformed and inarticulate faith
"and, after all," concluded the essay
ist, "it did.not necessarily follow that
because a man was inarticulate he
therefore had no religion." Two things,
it was suggested, give us an insight
into the real faith of men. These are,
first, their actions, and, second, their
objects of admiration.
The average university man or wom
an today is in very much the position
of the soldiers when Hankey knew at
the front. The acids of modernity and
of sophistication have eaten away from
most minds the last remnants of a
merely superstitious faith and it often
seems that nothing is left. My experi
ence with university students indicates
to me that something of great im
portance remains. In regard to ac
tions, the most revealing facts relate

[ not to what men do, but to what they ]
J refuse to do. It would seem that there!
are no persons who do not have at the
i center of their lives what may be called j
; "splendid incapacities." There are
, depths to which men will not sink no
matter what the gain may appear to be.
Here is our starting point and from
J it we should be able to go on to a
| cogent statement of those things by
| which men really live. The objects of
admiration are equally important. It is
interesting to note that whether or not j
I men are themselves veracious they are
| very quick to condemn any failure in
veracity and give their highest ad-
I miration to those marked by dependa
bility and integrity.
Veracity Admired
i Even the supposedly irreligious are j
extremely quick to see through any
one who pretends to be better than he
i is, and to admire the one who demon
| strates some equality between his
| do so admire the life of veracity, that
; claims and his actions. Now if people
is simply another way of saying that
they count it pre-eminently worth
while. This also then is one of the
points that is fixed and stable, and
] from it we can move out in the build-
I ing of a reasonable faith.
It is my conviction that there is a
i great deal which goes on in the world
| which has about it a religious quality,
| though it has absolutely no connection
I with churches, scriptures, or stated pe
| riods of worship. The worst enemy of
| real religion is the supposition that re
j ligion is something separated from life.
' Task To Demonstrate
Our task is to demonstrate that kind
of religion which can sanctify com
mon life anywhere and is as likely to
| be found in the fraternity house, the
c dormitory, or the classroom, as well as
1 th? altar. This !s not to say, however,

that the practice of regular worship is
unimportant. Indeed, our religious ef
forts alone are for the most part feeble
ones, and we need greatly the strength
that comes from corporate worship.
The problem, then, is not whether we
shall have the religion which glori
fies the commonplace, on the one hand,
or the religion which joins in wor
ship, on the other hand. The truth is
that each helps the other. If our com
mon life has been shot through with
spiritual meaning, our worship will be
more valuable to us, and, if we have
engaged with regularity in the expe
rience of worship, it is more easy to
see meaning in common life.
In seeking to discover and fortify the
religion of the inarticulate in a great
university our purpose should be
marked by unity of action in every de
tail. We should avoid over-lapping
wherever possible and produce a
united front on the problems of spir
itual life.
Chapel Is Neutral
It is hoped that the various organ
izations on the campus, including the
denominational clubs, will all join in a
single program. Since the Memorial
Church is neutral ground, denomina
tionally, there is no reason why all
groups should hesitate to unite in it.
The Vestry will be used as a lobby and

room for all who care to use it. Small
groups who have no other place to meet
should feel free to make use of the fa
cilities thus afforded.
