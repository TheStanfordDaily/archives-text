### Tro Harper 
Down in Los Altos I've got a friend
who has all the natives kidded into
thinking he's a G-man. Since he's
listed in the town directory as having
"no occupation," he doesn't have such
a hard time keeping up the reputation.
Now this friend happened to be in one
of the Los Altos fancy food marts the
other day. Talk was flying hot and
heavy. The local apple-barrel sitters
and whittlers had just about got all the
political situations in the country all
figured out when suddenly someone
happened to mention the G-men and
their influence on public morals. As a
man the boys all turned to my friend
quietly looking over a magazine in the
corner. Needless to say none of the
glances was especially straightforward.
He looked up and smiled a little, then
said:
"Yeah, you never know who these
G-men are nowadays."
"Naw. I guess you're right," drawled
one of the boys. "You never know who
the crooks are, either."
Which seems to prove that maybe the
smart college fellows sometimes ain't
so smart.

Some one may have seen this, but
then again, maybe someone hasn't.
Every once in a while a Stanford
student decides to prove to his mama
and papa that he is really learning to
be a smart lad in college and so he
sits down and pens them a few clever
lines on a postcard. The only trouble
is that he sometimes forgets to put an
address on the card. As a result the
post-ofTicers decide to try and find the
author of these cards and post them on
the bulletin board in the P.O. so that
the milling eyes of the multitude may
feast thereon. Some of these cards are
pretty funny.
"Dear Dad:
'Sorry Jack was arrested for speed
ing and had to pay a $10 fine. Too
bad you lost those pigs and that the
horse has blind staggers. But I have
goods news. I'm engaged to the sweet
est girl you ever saw. She wants me to
get her a sparkler so she can show it to
other dumbbells. Love, Jack."

Over in the Daily office today we got
a little card from another outfit seek
ing to outlaw war by fair means or
foul. This way of outlawing it happens
to be not only pretty funny but also
foul. I quote:
"The Peaco Symbol Movement • has
set out to unite the world for peace,
before 1938, by wearing of peace
badges.
"Will you help us? Will you have
your art department design a peace
badge and print it in your publication,
with some suitable words (these are
they) about Peace Symbol Movement,
urging people to cut out the badge and
wear it?
We expect that manufacturers will
take up the idea and produce hats,
coats, luggage, radiator caps, etc., with
peace symbols on them. Pax dress silks
and handkerchiefs are already on the
market.
"For those who understand, it is a
crusade!"
Maybe pretty soon we will be eat
ing pieces of potatoes, driving pieces
of cars, in short, be so thoroughly
wrapped up in peace, we'll forget '
there's a peace movement. Anyway, if
you feel differently about it, you can
cut out this column and wear it around
your head. Mind you; you'll look
pretty silly.

"Dear Dad:
'Sorry Jack was arrested for speed

bad you lost those pigs and that the
horse has blind staggers. But I have
goods news. I'm engaged to the sweet

Over in the Daily office today we got
a little card from another outfit seek
ing to outlaw war by fair means or
foul. This way of outlawing it happens
to be not only pretty funny but also
foul. I quote:
"The Peaco Symbol Movement • has
set out to unite the world for peace,
before 1938, by wearing of peace
badges.
"Will you help us? Will you have
your art department design a peace
badge and print it in your publication,
with some suitable words (these are
they) about Peace Symbol Movement,
urging people to cut out the badge and
wear it?
We expect that manufacturers will
take up the idea and produce hats,
coats, luggage, radiator caps, etc., with
peace symbols on them. Pax dress silks
and handkerchiefs are already on the
market.
"For those who understand, it is a
crusade!"
Maybe pretty soon we will be eat
ing pieces of potatoes, driving pieces
of cars, in short, be so thoroughly
wrapped up in peace, we'll forget '
there's a peace movement. Anyway, if
you feel differently about it, you can
cut out this column and wear it around
your head. Mind you; you'll look
pretty silly.
Down in Los Altos I've got a friend
who has all the natives kidded into
thinking he's a G-man. Since he's
listed in the town directory as having
"no occupation," he doesn't have such
a hard time keeping up the reputation.
Now this friend happened to be in one
of the Los Altos fancy food marts the
other day. Talk was flying hot and
heavy. The local apple-barrel sitters
and whittlers had just about got all the
political situations in the country all
figured out when suddenly someone
happened to mention the G-men and
their influence on public morals. As a
man the boys all turned to my friend
quietly looking over a magazine in the
corner. Needless to say none of the
glances was especially straightforward.
He looked up and smiled a little, then
said:
"Yeah, you never know who these
G-men are nowadays."
"Naw. I guess you're right," drawled
one of the boys. "You never know who
the crooks are, either."
Which seems to prove that maybe the
smart college fellows sometimes ain't
so smart.

Some one may have seen this, but
then again, maybe someone hasn't.
Every once in a while a Stanford
student decides to prove to his mama
and papa that he is really learning to
be a smart lad in college and so he
sits down and pens them a few clever
lines on a postcard. The only trouble
is that he sometimes forgets to put an
address on the card. As a result the
post-ofTicers decide to try and find the
