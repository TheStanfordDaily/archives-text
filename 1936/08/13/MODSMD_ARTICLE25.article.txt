# Pacific Relations Institute Meet Opens

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, J
I Aug. 12â€”"An American standard of
living," Carl L. Alsberg of Stanford
, University told the International Re
search Committee of the Institute of
Pacific Relations at a meeting here,
does not exist.
Alsberg, director of the Stanford
Food Research Institute, condemned
the use of the term. He spoke before i
the committee which met here prelim- I
inary to the Yosemite conference of
the Institute of Pacific Relations Aug
ust 15 to 29.
His address was in connection with i
the program of research into world- !
wide standards of living which the in
stitute is undertaking under direction 1
of W. L. Holland.
"The question of the standard of liv
ing," said Alsberg, "is perhaps more
important in the United States than in
some other countries, because in our
congress the most potent argument for
high tariffs is the 'American standard
of living. Of course there 'ain't no
such animal.'
"In order to protect the 'American
standard of living' you equalize the
cost of production in the United States
and in the countries from which the
imports would come. Of course you
cannot have trade when the costs are
equal. There would be no need for it.
"So we have had the foggiest kind
of thinking and very pernicious writ
ing and talking based on this question
of the standard of living."

The sixth biennial conference of the
Institute of Pacific Relations will begin
in Yosemite National Park tomorrow
and continue until the end of this 1
month. This is the first time the insti
tute has held its session on the Amer- !
ican continent, and California is play- !
ing host for the delegations of the Pa- '
cific nations.
More than 200 delegates from the j 1
United States, Great Britain, China,
Japan, the Soviet Union, Australia, '
New Zealand, Canada, the Philippines,
Korea, France, Mexico, and the Neth- j
erland Indies, will discuss Pacific prob
lems in the round table meetings at
the Ahwahnee Hotel.
35 U.S. Delegates
The United States has 35 delegates
at the conference, headed by Mr. New
ton D. Baker, former Secretary of War
under Wilson's regime. Dr. Ray Ly- ;

man Wilbur, president of the Univer
sity, acts as chairman of the California
delegation, and other Stanford men
will also participate in the conference.
The institute is not an inter-govern
mental organization, and the delegates
from all countries of the Pacific area
are unofficial representatives. The
purpose of this conference is to dis
cuss the political and economic prob
lems of the Pacific nations, but there
will be no resolutions or conclusions on
the subjects discussed. The conference
brings together accurate information
on the conditions in the several coun
tries, and then those conditions, opin
ions and feelings, are discussed with
out any claims of conclusion for action.
Round Table Meetings
The round table meetings to be held
in the conference will be open only for
the delegates, while a limited number
of public meetings are open to the
public. The members of the confer
ence will deliver their addresses at
these meetings.
The chief subjects to be discussed
in this conference will include the
United States recovery program, Japa
nese expansion in world markets, eco
nomic development of the Soviet Un
ion, China's economic reconstruction,
and the changing balance of political
forces and possibilities of peaceful ad
justment. Many experts will examine
the problems of these subjects in the
round table meetings.
Centers on Far East
The conference will be chiefly cen
tered on the Far Eastern problems, es
pecially the economical relation of na
tions; and the Japanese delegation is
paying a good deal of attention to the
problem of China's economic and po
litical situations. China's delegation, a
group of 17 experts and scholars head
ed by Dr. Hu Shih, will represent all
the facts about the present condition in
China, as facts speak louder than any
false propaganda.
The first conference of the institute
was held in Honolulu in 1925. The sec
ond biennial meeting was held in the
same place, and after that the confer
ences were held in Kyoto, Shanghai,
and Banff, Canada. The institute aims
to keep its work practical, to serve in
the removal of difficulties in Pacific re
lations and in the promotion of inter
national peace. It has done much re
search work in co-operation with the

League of Nations and other interna
tional organizations.
Improvement Needed
As we look back to the past 10 years
we realize that the improvement of the
relationship of nations does not come
up to our expectation, and there is still
a great need of peaceful adjustment
among the nations bordering the Pa- 1
cific. The causes of conflict between
nations must be understood, as a
country needs to understand better the
general background and problems of
another. The Pacific peoples should
clearly recognize the present Pacific
situation and consider how to develop
better relations of nations in the years
ahead.
February, 1866, did not have a full
moon. The same was true in 1915 and
1934, but there will not likely be an
other such occurrence until 1961.

Canada produces 88 per cent of the
world's supply of asbestos.
