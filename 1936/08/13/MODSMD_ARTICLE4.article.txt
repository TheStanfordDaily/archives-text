# Males Inspect Bridge From Boat
## 
### Dorothy Hodgins 
Twenty acceptable Stanford males of
the proper age (21) were whirled
around and under the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge last Tuesday
while Harry Hoehn boldly divulged in
formation, out of hearing of all fe
males, concerning the bridge.
One inquisitive female reporter,
however, learned that from the govern
ment boat they saw the entrance of
the tunnel and awed at the ant-like
creatures working at tremendous
heights. One sturdy male broke into
poetry: "Many wonderful things, but
most wonderful is man."
Coveted information was as follows:
The towers have a swaying radius of
9 feet. Expansion and contraction of
the bridge is provided by interlocking,
sliding steel fingers. Before a special
compartment was built a famous diver
took his radio down with him for
amusement as it took a long time for
him to descend due to the pressure of
the water. Only 23 men have been
killed through accidents in a course of
three years and these accidents were
due to personal carelessness.
It was a lovely day, but the bay was
rough and many of the staunch males
inspected the longest bridge in the
world with saddened faces.
