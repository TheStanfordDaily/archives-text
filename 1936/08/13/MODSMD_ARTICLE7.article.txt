# Stage Director Casts Players In Sepia Saga
## 
### 
Like Cecil De Mille, Mr. Rob
ert Brauns, director of "Antony
and Cleopatra," which goes on
view in the assembly hall tonight,
is all business.
Mr. Brauns was castingâ€”not in
a theater but about the neighbor
hood of Ramona Street in Palo
Alto. Two dusky young children
were playing.
"They're it," said Brauns, and
immediately offered the young
sters their big chance. It wasn't
long before the two kids were be
ing rushed up Palm Drive, their
career as Shakespearean actors
well under way.
Sunny and Sister Brown will
make a personal appearance to
night and Saturday night in "An
tony and Cleopatra." The engage
ment is limited positively to two
nights only. So hurry! Hurry!
