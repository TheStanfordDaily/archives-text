## Depression Recovery In Australia Is Subject 
### 
The Honorable Frederic W. Eggle
ston, chairman of the Australian dele
gation to the Pacific Relations Institute,
will speak in the Stanford Little The
ater next Thursday evening on the
topic, "The Australian Policy for De
pression."
The speaker takes the stand that the
inflationary and deflationary methods
used in Australia have contributed to
the quick recovery of the country aid
ed by gold development and the prog
ress of secondary industries.
He gives the following reasons why
the Australian policy for depression
abatement has succeeded:
"Only those measures were taken
that were necessary to relieve strain.
"Because the communities were left
to recover for themselves as much as
possible.
"No attempt was made to restore any
former level but only stability.
"No attempt made to include reform
with recovery."
On Friday morning two classroom
lectures, open to the public, will be
conducted by Mr. Eggleston. The first,
