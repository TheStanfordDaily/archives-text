# Thieves Frolic While Campus Slumbers On
## 
### 
Thieves, or a thief, visited four fra
ternity houses on the campus one
night this week. The loot was valued
I at more than $100.
While the summer students slept,
the prowler entered. At the Delta
Kappa Epsilon he collected $25 and a
i watch. At the Phi Gamma Delta house
j another watch and $20 was added to
i the collection. The Beta Theta Pi boys
were robbed of $25, but their watches
i were saved.
Perhaps the most curious article re
ported missing was the handle of a
vacuum cleaner, taken from the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house. This is puzzling,
and the campus police suspect some
henpecked husband, whose wife broke
her vacuum cleaner. She must also
want some new clothes, perhaps a fur
coat (the August fur sales are still
; on).
Incidentally, the dictionary is miss
ing from the Daily shack. We hardly
, suspect a student, but this is summer
quarter and visiting teachers some
times use dictionaries. However, there
1 are no clues and we cast no reflections,
: so what!
Rio de Janeiro, which had a popu
lation of only 3850 in 1858, now has
more than a million residents.
