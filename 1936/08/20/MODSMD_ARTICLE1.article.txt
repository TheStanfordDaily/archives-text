# Mears Reviews Activities of Closing Quarter
## 16 Universities Represented By 31 Visiting Faculty Members This Summer 
### 
Dr. E. G. Mears, director of sum
mer quarter, reported a registration
of 763 for this 1936 summer session, an
increase of 45 students over last sum
mer's enrollment, when he was ques
tioned about the highlights of the
quarter. Two-thirds of this number, he
added, are graduate students.
Stanford University drew 31 visit
ing faculty members to its summer
quarter, and this list represented 16
leading universities of the United
States, Canada, and Europe. Dr. Mears
anticipates another equally representa
tive group of visiting professors for
the 1937 summer session. Six profes
sors, already appointed for next year,
will come here from the universities
of Vienna, Michigan, Washington,
U.S.C., lowa, and Harvard.
Schubert Cycle Given
The Schubert Cycle which was giv
on by the South Mountain and Pro
Arte Quartets on June 26, 29, and
July 10 and 24, was mentioned par
ticulai'ly by Dr. Mears in his brief re
view of the summer's activities. This
is the fourth summer that the Pro
Arte Quartet has been presented at
Stanford, through the generosity of
Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.
Assisting artists in the Schubert
Cycle were Gunnar Johansen, pian
ist; Walter Bell, double basÂ«; and
Lawrence Strauss, tenor.
"A record breaking number of per
sons registered for the Education Con
ference on Curriculum and Guidance
which was held July 6-10," he stated.
Stage Classics Productions
The third activity which Dr. Mears
stressed in his review of the highlights
was the work in the Stage Classics
Production classes consisting of the
Tudor lecture series which provided a
cultural background for the summer's
plays, followed by the ambitious and
extremely well produced "Antony and
Cleopatra,"' by Shakespeare, and
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra."
Added to these activities were the
Tuesday evening series, consisting of
an out-door entertainment of Las
Tapatias in the Union Court, the Mad
rigal singers, Vivian Wall's dance re
cital, the puppet presentation of the
"Comedy of Errors," and lectures on
current affairs, on art, and on travel.
Visiting Professor Series
On Thursday evenings there were
discussions given by the visiting pro
fessors.
The summer programs also included
musical recording programs, includ
ing lectures on the songs of Shake
speare's time and modern interpreta
tions in symphony and opera of
Shakespeare, and the recordings of the
quartets playing here.
The dramatic readings, or "play
concerts," and a loan exhibit of "One
Hundred Years of Print Making,"
shown from July 20 to August 31, com
pleted the list.
This summer also marked the inau
guration of a series of three vesper
services, organized by the new chap
lain, Dr. Trueblood.
"The public exercises were exceed
ingly well attended," Dr. Mears com
mented.
