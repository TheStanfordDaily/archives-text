# Cowdery Talks Before School Of Education
## Assistant Registrar Tells How Depression Wages Are Gradually Rising 
### 
"The low minimums of the depres
sion period seem to be disappearing.
There has been improvement in plac
ing both beginning and experienced
teachers," stated Dr. Karl M. Cowdery,
associate registrar, before the School
of Education last week in discussing
techniques and outlook for the coming
year.
Although the outlook in the teach
ing fields is more cheerful, the admin
istrative angle is disappointing. Cow
dery said that there are fewer calls
especially in the medium of higher
salaried positions. This has not been a
good placement year in terms of ad
ministrative positions.
In many instances in the past book
agents have notified applicants of
openings so that by the time the uni
versity was informed some hundred
teachers had already contacted the
board and superintendent. This year
the situation with book agents was
not so bad.
Placement in semi-administrative
positions has been better than in pure
ly administrative ones. The difficulty
in placing administrators from outside
the state is great. Very few are placed
and the efforts are disappointing, be
cause training in California is not the
same as teaching in California. Then,
too, there are not enough administra
tive offices to accommodate the num
ber of administrators seeking posi
tions.
Dr. Cowdery explained the work of
the Stanford Appointment Office. Dean
Grayson N. Kefauver asked the co-op
eration of teachers in notifying the
Stanford Office of openings in their
respective schools.

Miss Elizabeth Janin will become the
bride of Eliot Arthur Powell Evans,
Stanford graduate student, next Wed
nesday evening.
