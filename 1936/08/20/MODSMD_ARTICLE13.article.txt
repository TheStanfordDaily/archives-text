The world powers will join together
to suppress Japan if that country be
comes a menace to international
peace through its expansionist policy,
A. V. Alexander, former lord of the
British Admiralty, warned Japanese
delegates in the sixth conference of the
Institute of Pacific Relations in Yose
mite Tuesday.
"If the motives of our Japanese
friends are purely to raise their coun
try's standard of living. I am convinced
all can be arranged by conciliation
and trade agreements," he said, "but if
there is an imperialistic motive, there
are grave dangers for Japan.
"Other nations may allow such a
policy to go far, but if it becomes a
real menace, they will combine to re
move that menace, as modern history
indicates," Mr. Alexander said.
Japanese Deny Imperialism
The Japanese delegates categorically
denied imperialistic motives and any
intention to monopolize world trade
or enter into any agreement with any
other nation to that end.
Dr. Hu Shih, head of the Chinese
delegation, stated he felt the Alexander
speech, by its very frankness, laid the
basis for some worthy results from the
conference.
Japan's record-breaking trade ex
pansion brought the conference to its
high point at Tuesday round table
meetings. The Japanese delegation
was called upon to answer searching
inquiries into the nature, extent, ob
jectives, and methods of their nation's
expansionist policies.
Naval Program Discussed
America's naval program came up
indirectly in the round tables via a
Philippine discussion. British and
Americans saw in Philippine military
training a link with the American
naval policy—a determination of the
United States to protect the Philip
pines from invasion even after the 10-
year period when the islands become
autonomous.
The Japanese delegates are not in
terested in the Philippines, according
to their statement. But they are inter
ested in the American naval program,
recently expanded. The discussion be
came more complex, when the Amer
ican delegation declared that there
was no likelihood that America would
abrogate the open door policy, even
though she is not now lending an ear
to its creaking hinges.
Far East Problems
American affairs are being centered
in the beginning discussions of the
conference. The Far Eastern prob
lems related to the United States were
discussed by the members of the insti
tute. Both American and foreign dele
gates were agreed that the United

I States has by no means abandoned its j
I policy of the open door in China, but
| that preoccupation with internal af
j fairs during the depression has moder- '
! ated emphasis for the time being on the !
j open door. No mention was made of
i the Japanese expansionist policy as the ,
i Japanese delegation had requested that
j matters pertaining to the Japanese po
j sition in yesterday's discussion be
! postponed and incorporated with later
i round tables dealing directly with
Japanese affairs.
Silver Policy Influence
j The influence of the American silver
j policy to the Pacific nations, especially
; China, were examined. As to the
American stand on gold, there was be
lief that it was "dangerous" from the
viewpoint of international relations,
i The Canadian delegation was enthus
iastic for the New Deal recovery pro
gram, for Canada shared in the eco
nomic benefits but not in the political
results.
Owing to the exclusion of newspa
j permen in the round table meetings,
the discussions of the delegates were
held in confidence. The institute's of
ficials at first favored the opening of
' the conclave to reporters, but finally
excluded them from round table meet
ings upon the request of the Japanese
| delegation for certain privacy.
Conference Momentous
The conference is expected to be the
most momentous in the history of the
Pacific Coast, so far as international
affairs are concerned. The three dom-
I inating political questions which come
before the session regarding the prin
cipal political changes that have taken
place in the Pacific area during the
past few years, are: the extent of Japa
nese expansion and the international
status of "Manchukuo"; the inde
| pendence of the Philippines; and the
naval disarmament in the Pacific.
I Special issues to be attacked include
j the Soviet "national policy," United
States' exclusion of Oriental immi
j grants, changing balance of power in
, the Pacific, shifting boundaries, possi-
I bilities of peaceful settlement of ex
; isting differences with the establish
j ment of peace machinery.
Labor Movement Question
Other subjects to be discussed in the
! conference ai*e: the labor movement in
Australia, the rapidity of recovery un
der the New Deal, the raw silk situa
tion in Japan, the Chinese monetary
j system, and the ever-recurring fish
| eries dispute between the Japanese
| and Soviet Russia.
The general Pacific problems are:
! Japan's influence is being enormously
; expanded in Asia; Russia is alarmed;
| Britain, with vast trade and colonial
I possessions in the Far East, is con
cerned; the United States wants the

open door to China; the smaller Pa- |
cific nations are vitally affected. Great
Britain's attitude toward the Roosevelt
| monetary policy, the defunct NRA, the
| agricultural adjustment program, and ,
; the Tennessee Valley Authority will i
! feature the institute's discussion of !
! American activities.

and trade agreements," he said, "but if
there is an imperialistic motive, there
are grave dangers for Japan.
"Other nations may allow such a
policy to go far, but if it becomes a
real menace, they will combine to re
move that menace, as modern history
indicates," Mr. Alexander said.
Japanese Deny Imperialism
The Japanese delegates categorically
denied imperialistic motives and any
intention to monopolize world trade
or enter into any agreement with any
other nation to that end.
Dr. Hu Shih, head of the Chinese
delegation, stated he felt the Alexander
speech, by its very frankness, laid the
basis for some worthy results from the
conference.
Japan's record-breaking trade ex
pansion brought the conference to its
high point at Tuesday round table
meetings. The Japanese delegation
was called upon to answer searching
inquiries into the nature, extent, ob
jectives, and methods of their nation's
expansionist policies.
Naval Program Discussed
America's naval program came up
indirectly in the round tables via a
Philippine discussion. British and
Americans saw in Philippine military
training a link with the American
naval policy—a determination of the
United States to protect the Philip
pines from invasion even after the 10-
year period when the islands become
autonomous.
The Japanese delegates are not in
terested in the Philippines, according
to their statement. But they are inter
ested in the American naval program,
recently expanded. The discussion be
came more complex, when the Amer
ican delegation declared that there
was no likelihood that America would
abrogate the open door policy, even
though she is not now lending an ear
to its creaking hinges.
Far East Problems
American affairs are being centered
in the beginning discussions of the
conference. The Far Eastern prob
lems related to the United States were
discussed by the members of the insti
tute. Both American and foreign dele
gates were agreed that the United

I States has by no means abandoned its j
I policy of the open door in China, but
| that preoccupation with internal af
j fairs during the depression has moder- '
! ated emphasis for the time being on the !
j open door. No mention was made of
i the Japanese expansionist policy as the ,
i Japanese delegation had requested that
j matters pertaining to the Japanese po
j sition in yesterday's discussion be
! postponed and incorporated with later
i round tables dealing directly with
Japanese affairs.
Silver Policy Influence
j The influence of the American silver
j policy to the Pacific nations, especially
; China, were examined. As to the
American stand on gold, there was be
lief that it was "dangerous" from the
viewpoint of international relations,
i The Canadian delegation was enthus
iastic for the New Deal recovery pro
gram, for Canada shared in the eco
nomic benefits but not in the political
results.
Owing to the exclusion of newspa
j permen in the round table meetings,
the discussions of the delegates were
held in confidence. The institute's of
ficials at first favored the opening of
' the conclave to reporters, but finally
excluded them from round table meet
ings upon the request of the Japanese
| delegation for certain privacy.
Conference Momentous
The conference is expected to be the
most momentous in the history of the
Pacific Coast, so far as international
affairs are concerned. The three dom-
I inating political questions which come
before the session regarding the prin
cipal political changes that have taken
place in the Pacific area during the
past few years, are: the extent of Japa
nese expansion and the international
status of "Manchukuo"; the inde
| pendence of the Philippines; and the
naval disarmament in the Pacific.
I Special issues to be attacked include
j the Soviet "national policy," United
States' exclusion of Oriental immi
j grants, changing balance of power in
, the Pacific, shifting boundaries, possi-
I bilities of peaceful settlement of ex
; isting differences with the establish
j ment of peace machinery.
Labor Movement Question
Other subjects to be discussed in the
! conference ai*e: the labor movement in
Australia, the rapidity of recovery un
der the New Deal, the raw silk situa
tion in Japan, the Chinese monetary
j system, and the ever-recurring fish
| eries dispute between the Japanese
| and Soviet Russia.
The general Pacific problems are:
! Japan's influence is being enormously
; expanded in Asia; Russia is alarmed;
| Britain, with vast trade and colonial
I possessions in the Far East, is con
cerned; the United States wants the

open door to China; the smaller Pa- |
cific nations are vitally affected. Great
Britain's attitude toward the Roosevelt
| monetary policy, the defunct NRA, the
| agricultural adjustment program, and ,
; the Tennessee Valley Authority will i
! feature the institute's discussion of !
! American activities.
The world powers will join together
to suppress Japan if that country be
comes a menace to international
peace through its expansionist policy,
A. V. Alexander, former lord of the
British Admiralty, warned Japanese
delegates in the sixth conference of the
Institute of Pacific Relations in Yose
mite Tuesday.
"If the motives of our Japanese
friends are purely to raise their coun
try's standard of living. I am convinced

and trade agreements," he said, "but if

intention to monopolize world trade
or enter into any agreement with any
other nation to that end.
Dr. Hu Shih, head of the Chinese
delegation, stated he felt the Alexander
speech, by its very frankness, laid the
basis for some worthy results from the
conference.
Japan's record-breaking trade ex
pansion brought the conference to its
high point at Tuesday round table
meetings. The Japanese delegation
was called upon to answer searching
inquiries into the nature, extent, ob
jectives, and methods of their nation's
expansionist policies.
Naval Program Discussed
America's naval program came up
indirectly in the round tables via a
Philippine discussion. British and
Americans saw in Philippine military
training a link with the American
naval policy—a determination of the
United States to protect the Philip
pines from invasion even after the 10-
year period when the islands become
autonomous.
The Japanese delegates are not in
terested in the Philippines, according
to their statement. But they are inter
ested in the American naval program,
recently expanded. The discussion be
came more complex, when the Amer
ican delegation declared that there
was no likelihood that America would
abrogate the open door policy, even
though she is not now lending an ear
to its creaking hinges.
Far East Problems
American affairs are being centered
in the beginning discussions of the
conference. The Far Eastern prob
lems related to the United States were
discussed by the members of the insti
tute. Both American and foreign dele
gates were agreed that the United

I States has by no means abandoned its j
I policy of the open door in China, but
| that preoccupation with internal af
j fairs during the depression has moder- '
! ated emphasis for the time being on the !
j open door. No mention was made of
i the Japanese expansionist policy as the ,
i Japanese delegation had requested that
j matters pertaining to the Japanese po
j sition in yesterday's discussion be
! postponed and incorporated with later
i round tables dealing directly with
Japanese affairs.
Silver Policy Influence
j The influence of the American silver
j policy to the Pacific nations, especially
; China, were examined. As to the
American stand on gold, there was be
lief that it was "dangerous" from the
viewpoint of international relations,
i The Canadian delegation was enthus
iastic for the New Deal recovery pro
gram, for Canada shared in the eco
nomic benefits but not in the political
results.
Owing to the exclusion of newspa
j permen in the round table meetings,
the discussions of the delegates were
held in confidence. The institute's of
ficials at first favored the opening of
' the conclave to reporters, but finally
excluded them from round table meet
ings upon the request of the Japanese
| delegation for certain privacy.
Conference Momentous
The conference is expected to be the
most momentous in the history of the
Pacific Coast, so far as international
affairs are concerned. The three dom-
I inating political questions which come
before the session regarding the prin
cipal political changes that have taken
place in the Pacific area during the
past few years, are: the extent of Japa
nese expansion and the international
status of "Manchukuo"; the inde
| pendence of the Philippines; and the
naval disarmament in the Pacific.
I Special issues to be attacked include
j the Soviet "national policy," United
States' exclusion of Oriental immi
j grants, changing balance of power in
, the Pacific, shifting boundaries, possi-
I bilities of peaceful settlement of ex
; isting differences with the establish
j ment of peace machinery.
Labor Movement Question
Other subjects to be discussed in the
! conference ai*e: the labor movement in
Australia, the rapidity of recovery un
der the New Deal, the raw silk situa
tion in Japan, the Chinese monetary
j system, and the ever-recurring fish
| eries dispute between the Japanese
| and Soviet Russia.
The general Pacific problems are:
! Japan's influence is being enormously
; expanded in Asia; Russia is alarmed;
| Britain, with vast trade and colonial
I possessions in the Far East, is con
cerned; the United States wants the

open door to China; the smaller Pa- |
cific nations are vitally affected. Great
Britain's attitude toward the Roosevelt
| monetary policy, the defunct NRA, the
| agricultural adjustment program, and ,
; the Tennessee Valley Authority will i
! feature the institute's discussion of !
! American activities.
The world powers will join together
to suppress Japan if that country be
comes a menace to international
peace through its expansionist policy,
A. V. Alexander, former lord of the
British Admiralty, warned Japanese
delegates in the sixth conference of the
Institute of Pacific Relations in Yose
mite Tuesday.
"If the motives of our Japanese
friends are purely to raise their coun
try's standard of living. I am convinced
all can be arranged by conciliation
and trade agreements," he said, "but if
there is an imperialistic motive, there
are grave dangers for Japan.
"Other nations may allow such a
policy to go far, but if it becomes a
real menace, they will combine to re
move that menace, as modern history
indicates," Mr. Alexander said.
