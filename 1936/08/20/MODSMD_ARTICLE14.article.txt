### TRO HARPER 
The other day I happened to be talk
ing to a gentleman just out from the
East who happened to be staying at
one of the larger hotels that sits high
atop Nob Hill up in San Francisco.
Feeling the need of food and drink, he
dropped into the dining room to there
satisfy his lust for the better things of
life. Finally, after looking over the
bill of fare for the better part of ten
minutes while the waiter stood first
on one foot and then on the other, he
looked up and said wearily:
"I think I'll just have a plate of
beans."
The waiter looked both surprised
and chagrined, then drawing himself
up to his full five feet three he said
pompously:
"I beg your pardon, sir, but never
has this hotel ever served beans."
Turning through the stack of papers
over in the Journalism Library the
other day I happened to run across a
rather neat little item reported by the
Associated Press:
"Jim Gidden's toe—the one next to
the great toe on the right foot—had
been giving him thunder, so the 88-

in their car: Despite the fancy looking
lock on the front that most manufac
turers use to fool erstwhile Jimmy Val
entines, a simple penknife will turn
the trick when applied to the bottom
of the locker. It's nothing but card
board, very easily destroyed.
Signs of the times: On an Unemploy
ment Relief Association in a
city there is a sign that says: "Moved
to basement in alley."
Down on the highway in one of the
local spas, there is a lad that runs the
establishment who doesn't care much
for work. In fact, he cares so little
for work that all he'd like to do is sit
in the shade and watch life go by.
Which he does on off days. Whenever
anyone asks him why he bought the
place, he confesses he wished he never
had.
"After I did buy the joint," he says,
"I found people expected me to sell
them things. I try my best to discour
age them from coming here. Things
just go from bad to worse. If I tell
them my sandwiches have maggots in
