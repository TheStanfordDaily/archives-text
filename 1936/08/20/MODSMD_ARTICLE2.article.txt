# Go to Stanford; You Too May Be a Success
## 
### 
According to Columnist 0. O.
Mclntyre, there is one course be
ing offered at Stanford which
doesn't appear on time schedules.
Quoting:
I was accosted by the famous
800 Hoo beggar along the west
drive of Central Park the other
duskâ€”probably the dozenth time
our paths crossed. Hatless, well
dressed and collegiate looking, the
approaches timidly for alms and
when, as he is on account of his
opulence, rebuffed, turns in sud
den tears away. He will not re
spond to call and most people,
conscience stricken, hurry after
him. Nearly always a dollar is his
reward. His story never varies.
He is a stranded Leland Stanford
student and this, so help him,
was the first time he ever stooped
to bogging. He has been at it five
years and I'm told has a fat bank
account.
