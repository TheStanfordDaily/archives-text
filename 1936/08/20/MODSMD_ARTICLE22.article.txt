# Tudor Series Is Completed
## Dr. Hazel Hansen Speaks On Historical Figures 
### 
"Almost any man who was great in
the annals of history has left his
mark on Egypt," stated Hazel Hansen, j
associate professor of classics, in the
last of the Tudor lectures, given in tha
Women's Clubhouse. Miss Hansen cit
ed Moses, Alexander, Darius, Antony,
Caesar, Nelson and Gordon as out
standing examples.
Quoting from Herodotus that "Egypt
is the gift of the Nile" Miss Hansen
said that Egypt was vital for Rome's
grain supply. Unlike other Roman
provinces Egypt became the empei'or's
private property. Alexandria, the
richest city, was noted for its libra
ry and museum. The library, how
ever, was burned during Caesar's
Egyptian campaign.
The speaker corrected certain fal
lacies that are wont to pass for true
history.
Cleopatra died August 29, 30 8.C.,
at the age of 39. According to Plutarch
she was of pure Greek blood and not
a half-caste. "Cleo-patra" means "of
illustrious ancestry." Caesar took
Caesarion, son of Cleopatra and Cae
sar, to Rome. Ceasarion at the age of
17 was put to death in Augustus'
reign. The asp in the basket of figs
suicide story is improbable.
Miss Hansen pointed out that there
are no authentic portraits of Cleo
patra. Coins show her late in her life.
"She had brains not beauty."
The lecture was richly illustrated
with slides and statues from the Stan
ford Museum.

In England, in 1300, the cost of 120
eggs was 16 cents.
