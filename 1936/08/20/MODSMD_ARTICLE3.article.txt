# Paly Playhouse Offers "There's Always Juliet"
## 
### 
Two well known Stanford stage lov
ers, Jean Albertson and Fred Clark,
will play opposite one another again
at the Palo Alto Civic Theater when
the Community Players present that
delightful romantic comedy, "There's
Always Juliet," tonight, Friday, and
Saturday at 8:15 o'clock. Reservations
may be made by calling the Commun
ity Center.
The play is British, amusing and con
cerned with a love affair. Inevitably
it is compared with "Private Lives,"
but it is less noisy, and does not suffer
by comparison. The two Stanford
stars of "There's Always Juliet" also
had the roles of Amanda and Elyot in
the Players production of Noel Cow
ard's "Private Lives."
In their present roles Fred Clark
and Jean Albertson have a nice prob
lem of distinctions, sharply drawn by
the playwright. They play the young,
fresh, romantic lovers who meet at a
cocktail party and immediately fall in
love.
John Van Druten, the playwright,
introduces the lovers almost as soon as
they have met for the first time, and
carries them through a whirlwind ro
mance and when the curtain falls she
has said yes and he is assailing his
future mother-in-law by transchan
nel telephone.
There are only four characters, the
others being Lucie Bentley, an expe
rienced comedienne, and Jack Mac-
Dowell.
