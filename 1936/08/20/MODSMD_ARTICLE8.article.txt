# Adroit Performances Seen in Summer Plays
## 
### DAVID BROWN 
The brighter producers know that
William Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra" is a cantankerous trouble
some thing to produce. Not heeding i
the fact that the professional stage
has produced the play only twice in a
decade, and then only with such per
sons as Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters, the '
Course in Stage Classics Production 1
put on "Antony and Cleopatra" last j
week and did a mighty commendable |
job of it. Robert Brauns, the director,
and the cast, every member, merit the
j orchids.
Fine Performances
I Three, in particular, turned in fine
> finished performances in the produc- j
tion. Alice Snyder, as Cleopatra, I
played her role with the strength, as '
well as the engaging weakness of the j
Queen. Her interpretation was ma
ture and professional, full of the emo- I
tional shadows and lights of Cleopatra's
character and containing the inconsist
ent dignity that belongs exclusively to I
womankind. In view of the fact that |
this was Miss Snyder's first venture
into theater-work, I feci her perform- |
mice of this erratic part, so feared by j
| professionals, was more than remark- I
j able.
Amelia Baines, as Charmian, turned
in perhaps the smoothest performance '
of the lot. Her gestures were sflfdrbly I
! intelligent, her lines and general spirit •

also were of professional calibre.
The third, and on a par with the first
two, was George Wood, as Pompcy.
Mr. Wood imparts to his role a boister
ousness and a rcalness enhanced by his
ease on stage. Mr. Wood has magnifi
cent stage presence and he is the third
of the rave triangle.
Ciist Is Admirable
Louis Scales, as Caesar, had the frig
id brittleness of a Caesar in his voice.
His inflections like his voice were thin
and clear and his interpretation was,
on the whole, well balanced. The same
can be said for Gilman Gist, as Eno
barbus. To him goes especial praise
for his understanding of the part as
evidenced by his delivery of the
speech, describing the beauty of the
Queen.
Coming to Antony, played by
Homer Huxtable, we arrive at a dif
ferent situation. Mr. Huxtable has a
certain amount of stage presence, ad
mitted. But his stage presence pos
sesses a pomposity not befitting the
quality of his performance. As a re
sult he often appears too explosive and
impulsive. Mr. Huxtable's voice has
not sufficient clarity. It is muffled.
His portrayal was understanding and
sincere, to be sure, but the deficiency
was on the technique side.
Thomas Seller, as Agrippa, demon
strated the fine quality of voice so evi
dent in his Dortraval of Caesar in

"Caesar and Cleopatra." Brobury Ellis
played (he part of the page with skill.
Excellent Settings
The sets and costumes were par
ticularly fine and credit is due Carroll
Alexander and Helen Green, respec
tively. The original music, written for
the production by Adolph Hanson, was
interesting in spite of the frequent dis
j tortions produced by the recording j
I equipment. Music must come from the !
j pit—from living musicians.
Altogether the production was well
I directed and well acted. It represents
! one of the most ambitious attempts of j
| the Stanford stage. Happily, it was a
successful attempt.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" 1
A man named Edwin Williman de
[ served stellar billing in last week's
I presentation of George Bernard Shaw's
j "Caesar and Cleopatra." He played
! Brittanus, "the man who believed the
| laws of Britain were the laws of na
i ture."
Mr. Williman played the part of be
| ing bull's eye to Shaw's shafts of sa
j tirical comment on the smug com
placency of nineteenth century Brit
ish society. Mr. Williman was—well,
| ho was Brittanus and that's the best
I that can be said for any actor that he
! simply "was"' his role.
Thomas Seller gave an inspired per
formance as Caesar. His voice, ges-
tures, mood were perfect. lie instilled
all the mature strength—and the re
lapse into the tiredness of a man grow
ing old. In the speech before the
Sphynx, Mi", eller demonstrated great
ability in holding the stage alone with
out boring the audience.
Phyllis Corson was a Cleopatra as
measured and as well-interpreted as
Mr. Seller's Caesar. She got the friv
olity and Ihe pensiveness of the girl
queen Shaw conceived the "serpent of
the Nile" to be.
Honors too to Onyet Watson for her
playing of the boy-king, Ptolemy; to
Jane Anderton's well conceived Fta
tateeta; to Brobury Ellis' Appolo
dorus; to James Broughton's Pothinus
and all the others of the cast who made
the perfoi'mance the engaging thing it
was. George Wood demonstrated his
actors into sharply defined paths. There
seemed to be a unity and an objective
to each characterization. The actors
and actresses themselves knew where
and why they were going.
Where they did go was swiftly and
smoothly through "Caesar and Cleo
patra" to a finish heralded by bravos.
And it was not the finish that was be
ing cheered, either.

and why they were going.
Where they did go was swiftly and
smoothly through "Caesar and Cleo
patra" to a finish heralded by bravos.
And it was not the finish that was be
ing cheered, either.
The brighter producers know that
William Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra" is a cantankerous trouble
some thing to produce. Not heeding i
the fact that the professional stage
has produced the play only twice in a
decade, and then only with such per
sons as Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters, the '
Course in Stage Classics Production 1
put on "Antony and Cleopatra" last j
week and did a mighty commendable |
job of it. Robert Brauns, the director,
and the cast, every member, merit the
j orchids.
Fine Performances
I Three, in particular, turned in fine
> finished performances in the produc- j
tion. Alice Snyder, as Cleopatra, I
played her role with the strength, as '
well as the engaging weakness of the j
Queen. Her interpretation was ma
ture and professional, full of the emo- I
tional shadows and lights of Cleopatra's
character and containing the inconsist
ent dignity that belongs exclusively to I
womankind. In view of the fact that |
this was Miss Snyder's first venture
into theater-work, I feci her perform- |
mice of this erratic part, so feared by j
| professionals, was more than remark- I
j able.
Amelia Baines, as Charmian, turned
in perhaps the smoothest performance '
of the lot. Her gestures were sflfdrbly I
! intelligent, her lines and general spirit •

also were of professional calibre.
The third, and on a par with the first
two, was George Wood, as Pompcy.
Mr. Wood imparts to his role a boister
ousness and a rcalness enhanced by his
ease on stage. Mr. Wood has magnifi
cent stage presence and he is the third
of the rave triangle.
Ciist Is Admirable
Louis Scales, as Caesar, had the frig
id brittleness of a Caesar in his voice.
His inflections like his voice were thin
and clear and his interpretation was,
on the whole, well balanced. The same
can be said for Gilman Gist, as Eno
barbus. To him goes especial praise
for his understanding of the part as
evidenced by his delivery of the
speech, describing the beauty of the
Queen.
Coming to Antony, played by
Homer Huxtable, we arrive at a dif
ferent situation. Mr. Huxtable has a
certain amount of stage presence, ad
mitted. But his stage presence pos
sesses a pomposity not befitting the
quality of his performance. As a re
sult he often appears too explosive and
impulsive. Mr. Huxtable's voice has
not sufficient clarity. It is muffled.
His portrayal was understanding and
sincere, to be sure, but the deficiency
was on the technique side.
Thomas Seller, as Agrippa, demon
strated the fine quality of voice so evi
dent in his Dortraval of Caesar in

"Caesar and Cleopatra." Brobury Ellis
played (he part of the page with skill.
Excellent Settings
The sets and costumes were par
ticularly fine and credit is due Carroll
Alexander and Helen Green, respec
tively. The original music, written for
the production by Adolph Hanson, was
interesting in spite of the frequent dis
j tortions produced by the recording j
I equipment. Music must come from the !
j pit—from living musicians.
Altogether the production was well
I directed and well acted. It represents
! one of the most ambitious attempts of j
| the Stanford stage. Happily, it was a
successful attempt.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" 1
A man named Edwin Williman de
[ served stellar billing in last week's
I presentation of George Bernard Shaw's
j "Caesar and Cleopatra." He played
! Brittanus, "the man who believed the
| laws of Britain were the laws of na
i ture."
Mr. Williman played the part of be
| ing bull's eye to Shaw's shafts of sa
j tirical comment on the smug com
placency of nineteenth century Brit
ish society. Mr. Williman was—well,
| ho was Brittanus and that's the best
I that can be said for any actor that he
! simply "was"' his role.
Thomas Seller gave an inspired per
formance as Caesar. His voice, ges-
tures, mood were perfect. lie instilled
all the mature strength—and the re
lapse into the tiredness of a man grow
ing old. In the speech before the
Sphynx, Mi", eller demonstrated great
ability in holding the stage alone with
out boring the audience.
Phyllis Corson was a Cleopatra as
measured and as well-interpreted as
Mr. Seller's Caesar. She got the friv
olity and Ihe pensiveness of the girl
queen Shaw conceived the "serpent of
the Nile" to be.
Honors too to Onyet Watson for her
playing of the boy-king, Ptolemy; to
Jane Anderton's well conceived Fta
tateeta; to Brobury Ellis' Appolo
dorus; to James Broughton's Pothinus
and all the others of the cast who made
the perfoi'mance the engaging thing it
was. George Wood demonstrated his
actors into sharply defined paths. There
seemed to be a unity and an objective
to each characterization. The actors
and actresses themselves knew where
and why they were going.
Where they did go was swiftly and
smoothly through "Caesar and Cleo

the perfoi'mance the engaging thing it
was. George Wood demonstrated his
actors into sharply defined paths. There
seemed to be a unity and an objective
to each characterization. The actors
and actresses themselves knew where
and why they were going.
Where they did go was swiftly and
smoothly through "Caesar and Cleo
patra" to a finish heralded by bravos.
And it was not the finish that was be
ing cheered, either.
The brighter producers know that
William Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra" is a cantankerous trouble
some thing to produce. Not heeding i
the fact that the professional stage
has produced the play only twice in a
decade, and then only with such per
sons as Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters, the '
Course in Stage Classics Production 1
put on "Antony and Cleopatra" last j
week and did a mighty commendable |
job of it. Robert Brauns, the director,
and the cast, every member, merit the
j orchids.
Fine Performances
I Three, in particular, turned in fine
> finished performances in the produc- j
tion. Alice Snyder, as Cleopatra, I
played her role with the strength, as '
well as the engaging weakness of the j
Queen. Her interpretation was ma
ture and professional, full of the emo- I
tional shadows and lights of Cleopatra's
character and containing the inconsist
ent dignity that belongs exclusively to I
womankind. In view of the fact that |
this was Miss Snyder's first venture
into theater-work, I feci her perform- |
mice of this erratic part, so feared by j
| professionals, was more than remark- I
j able.
Amelia Baines, as Charmian, turned
in perhaps the smoothest performance '
of the lot. Her gestures were sflfdrbly I
! intelligent, her lines and general spirit •

also were of professional calibre.
The third, and on a par with the first
two, was George Wood, as Pompcy.
Mr. Wood imparts to his role a boister
ousness and a rcalness enhanced by his
ease on stage. Mr. Wood has magnifi
cent stage presence and he is the third
of the rave triangle.
Ciist Is Admirable
Louis Scales, as Caesar, had the frig
id brittleness of a Caesar in his voice.
His inflections like his voice were thin
and clear and his interpretation was,
on the whole, well balanced. The same
can be said for Gilman Gist, as Eno
barbus. To him goes especial praise
for his understanding of the part as
evidenced by his delivery of the
speech, describing the beauty of the
Queen.
Coming to Antony, played by
Homer Huxtable, we arrive at a dif
ferent situation. Mr. Huxtable has a
certain amount of stage presence, ad
mitted. But his stage presence pos
sesses a pomposity not befitting the
quality of his performance. As a re
sult he often appears too explosive and
impulsive. Mr. Huxtable's voice has
not sufficient clarity. It is muffled.
His portrayal was understanding and
sincere, to be sure, but the deficiency
was on the technique side.
Thomas Seller, as Agrippa, demon
strated the fine quality of voice so evi
dent in his Dortraval of Caesar in

"Caesar and Cleopatra." Brobury Ellis
played (he part of the page with skill.
Excellent Settings
The sets and costumes were par
ticularly fine and credit is due Carroll
Alexander and Helen Green, respec
tively. The original music, written for
the production by Adolph Hanson, was
interesting in spite of the frequent dis
j tortions produced by the recording j
I equipment. Music must come from the !
j pit—from living musicians.
Altogether the production was well
I directed and well acted. It represents
! one of the most ambitious attempts of j
| the Stanford stage. Happily, it was a
successful attempt.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" 1
A man named Edwin Williman de
[ served stellar billing in last week's
I presentation of George Bernard Shaw's
j "Caesar and Cleopatra." He played
! Brittanus, "the man who believed the
| laws of Britain were the laws of na
i ture."
Mr. Williman played the part of be
| ing bull's eye to Shaw's shafts of sa
j tirical comment on the smug com
placency of nineteenth century Brit
ish society. Mr. Williman was—well,
| ho was Brittanus and that's the best
I that can be said for any actor that he
! simply "was"' his role.
Thomas Seller gave an inspired per
formance as Caesar. His voice, ges-
tures, mood were perfect. lie instilled
all the mature strength—and the re
lapse into the tiredness of a man grow
ing old. In the speech before the
Sphynx, Mi", eller demonstrated great
ability in holding the stage alone with
out boring the audience.
Phyllis Corson was a Cleopatra as
measured and as well-interpreted as
Mr. Seller's Caesar. She got the friv
olity and Ihe pensiveness of the girl
queen Shaw conceived the "serpent of
the Nile" to be.
Honors too to Onyet Watson for her
playing of the boy-king, Ptolemy; to
Jane Anderton's well conceived Fta
tateeta; to Brobury Ellis' Appolo
dorus; to James Broughton's Pothinus
and all the others of the cast who made
