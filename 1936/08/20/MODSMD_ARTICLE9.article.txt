# Sports Experts Disagree On Football Data
## Stanford Prospects For Rose Bowl Tourney Are Equal with U. S. C., Cal 
### Millard Browne 
"Hi, Joe, how does the Rose Bowl
look this year?"
That's the kind of stuff they'll be
talking about up at Berkeley today,
and from now until some time late in
November—or December.
While Stanford's education grads
and bawlout conscious summer stu
dents commence the quarterly worry
about finals, California's fall semester
registration brings football back up to
first place in the annual realignment
of conversation topics.
At Berkeley, the answer to that Rose
Bowl query is, ''Pretty fair."
Down here, if anyone should ask, it,
would be, "Who knows?"
Of course, it isn't actually football
season yet—not till September 15. But
the mid-summer opening of Berkeley,
Santa Clara, and other semester-sys
tem Northern California schools some
how lights the fuse for gridiron propa
ganda and crap-shooting formations
(lifted from Pegler).
All is not rosy, or Rose Bowly, on
the Stanford football horizon. But all
isn't necessarily black either. The best
authorities, and their word can't be
taken for much when it refers to Stan
ford's chances in the 1936 campaign,
seem to think the Cardinals will not
win the Pacific Coast championship.
But they each believe that Coach Tiny
Thornhill's Red machine will not be
as bad as other experts think.
In short, the most feasible-sounding
prediction is that Stanford will be
something between mediocre and good
as compared to her seven conference
opponents.
The work of California and Southern
California alumni, which was started
some two years back when it became
apparent Stanford was at the peak of
a prosperity wave, has finally mate
rialized and accounted for many var
sity players which will be hard to stop.
The Golden Bears, whose sopho
mores last year strangely resembled
the Thornhill sophs of 1933, will reach
a peak that has not been surpassed at
Berkeley since the Wonder Team days.
Southern California's 1936 squad, if
the Trojan public relations department
can be trusted, will be more like the
Howard Jones machine of old than the
more recent S.C. fodder.
Washington rates a tie with the
Bears and Trojans in the pre-season
dope, and Stanford seems to conn:
next —along with Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, and U.C*L.A.
This arrangement, you understand, is
purely arbitrary; they haven't award
ed the championship as yet.
The annual remark, "It'll be a tough
season all around," finally has come
true. Each of these eight teams will
play the other seven this year, and
that innovation in Coast Conference
procedure still has Santa Clara, St.
Mary's, and other independents—nec
essarily shut out by the full confer
ence schedules—on the war-path.
Although Stanford, defending a
three-year record of participation in
the Rose Bowl, officially is the team to
beat, no one is taking this particularly
seriously. California, Washington, and
S.C. aren't nearly as much impressed
with Stanford as they are with each
other—and themselves.
That can be explained on the
strength of the fact that 15 Cardinal
lettermen, including nine first string
ers, have been graduated from last
year's team.
Best bets on the way this year's
squad will line up at the outset seem
to have Carl Schott, Chet Olcott, and
Jack Clarke as the leading ends; Pop
Grant, Pete Zagar, Dave Carnahan,
and Bob Mangan as a much better
tackle-department, than most people
think; Bob Matthews as one of the
leading guards on the Coast teaming
with Don McMillan, Porky Cuneo,
Jay Holdridge, or Dick Brigham; and a
slightly weaker group of centers head
ed by Nellie Heath, Dick Sutton, and
Louis Tsoutsouvas.
Two veterans—one a potential ail-
American quarterback, the other the
best safety man on the Coast—form
the nucleus for Stanford's backfield.
They are Bill Paulman, kicker-passer
blocker de luxe, and Jimmy Coffis.
Two other lettermen, Fred Williams
and Joe Vigna, are after first string
backfield jobs, but Pete Fay, Bill
Kirsch, Leo Madlem, Tom Collins, or
Glenn Hamilton might break through
to one of the halfback posts, and Earl
Hoos, Johnny Campbell, and Jake
Brigham will do some alternating
with Paulman and Williams in the
fullback and quarterback work.
The Indians will not rely on an 11-
man team of stars, but will concentrate
on a two-or-three-deep-for-every
position set-up.

They are Bill Paulman, kicker-passer
blocker de luxe, and Jimmy Coffis.
Two other lettermen, Fred Williams
and Joe Vigna, are after first string
backfield jobs, but Pete Fay, Bill
Kirsch, Leo Madlem, Tom Collins, or
Glenn Hamilton might break through
to one of the halfback posts, and Earl
Hoos, Johnny Campbell, and Jake
Brigham will do some alternating
with Paulman and Williams in the
fullback and quarterback work.
The Indians will not rely on an 11-
man team of stars, but will concentrate
on a two-or-three-deep-for-every
position set-up.
"Hi, Joe, how does the Rose Bowl
look this year?"
That's the kind of stuff they'll be
talking about up at Berkeley today,
and from now until some time late in
November—or December.
While Stanford's education grads
and bawlout conscious summer stu
dents commence the quarterly worry
about finals, California's fall semester
registration brings football back up to
first place in the annual realignment
of conversation topics.
At Berkeley, the answer to that Rose
Bowl query is, ''Pretty fair."
Down here, if anyone should ask, it,
would be, "Who knows?"
Of course, it isn't actually football
season yet—not till September 15. But
the mid-summer opening of Berkeley,
Santa Clara, and other semester-sys
tem Northern California schools some
how lights the fuse for gridiron propa
ganda and crap-shooting formations
(lifted from Pegler).
All is not rosy, or Rose Bowly, on
the Stanford football horizon. But all
isn't necessarily black either. The best
authorities, and their word can't be
taken for much when it refers to Stan
ford's chances in the 1936 campaign,
seem to think the Cardinals will not
win the Pacific Coast championship.
But they each believe that Coach Tiny
Thornhill's Red machine will not be
as bad as other experts think.
In short, the most feasible-sounding
prediction is that Stanford will be
something between mediocre and good
as compared to her seven conference
opponents.
The work of California and Southern
California alumni, which was started
some two years back when it became
apparent Stanford was at the peak of
a prosperity wave, has finally mate
rialized and accounted for many var
sity players which will be hard to stop.
The Golden Bears, whose sopho
mores last year strangely resembled
the Thornhill sophs of 1933, will reach
a peak that has not been surpassed at
Berkeley since the Wonder Team days.
Southern California's 1936 squad, if
the Trojan public relations department
can be trusted, will be more like the
Howard Jones machine of old than the
more recent S.C. fodder.
Washington rates a tie with the
Bears and Trojans in the pre-season
dope, and Stanford seems to conn:
next —along with Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, and U.C*L.A.
This arrangement, you understand, is
purely arbitrary; they haven't award
ed the championship as yet.
The annual remark, "It'll be a tough
season all around," finally has come
true. Each of these eight teams will
play the other seven this year, and
that innovation in Coast Conference
procedure still has Santa Clara, St.
Mary's, and other independents—nec
essarily shut out by the full confer
ence schedules—on the war-path.
Although Stanford, defending a
three-year record of participation in
the Rose Bowl, officially is the team to
beat, no one is taking this particularly
seriously. California, Washington, and
S.C. aren't nearly as much impressed
with Stanford as they are with each
other—and themselves.
That can be explained on the
strength of the fact that 15 Cardinal
lettermen, including nine first string
ers, have been graduated from last
year's team.
Best bets on the way this year's
squad will line up at the outset seem
to have Carl Schott, Chet Olcott, and
Jack Clarke as the leading ends; Pop
Grant, Pete Zagar, Dave Carnahan,
and Bob Mangan as a much better
tackle-department, than most people
think; Bob Matthews as one of the
leading guards on the Coast teaming
with Don McMillan, Porky Cuneo,
Jay Holdridge, or Dick Brigham; and a
slightly weaker group of centers head
ed by Nellie Heath, Dick Sutton, and
Louis Tsoutsouvas.
Two veterans—one a potential ail-
American quarterback, the other the
best safety man on the Coast—form
the nucleus for Stanford's backfield.
They are Bill Paulman, kicker-passer
blocker de luxe, and Jimmy Coffis.

Jack Clarke as the leading ends; Pop
Grant, Pete Zagar, Dave Carnahan,
and Bob Mangan as a much better
tackle-department, than most people
think; Bob Matthews as one of the
leading guards on the Coast teaming
with Don McMillan, Porky Cuneo,
Jay Holdridge, or Dick Brigham; and a
slightly weaker group of centers head
ed by Nellie Heath, Dick Sutton, and
Louis Tsoutsouvas.
Two veterans—one a potential ail-
American quarterback, the other the
best safety man on the Coast—form
the nucleus for Stanford's backfield.
They are Bill Paulman, kicker-passer
blocker de luxe, and Jimmy Coffis.
Two other lettermen, Fred Williams
and Joe Vigna, are after first string
backfield jobs, but Pete Fay, Bill
Kirsch, Leo Madlem, Tom Collins, or
Glenn Hamilton might break through
to one of the halfback posts, and Earl
Hoos, Johnny Campbell, and Jake
Brigham will do some alternating
with Paulman and Williams in the
fullback and quarterback work.
The Indians will not rely on an 11-
man team of stars, but will concentrate
on a two-or-three-deep-for-every
position set-up.
"Hi, Joe, how does the Rose Bowl
look this year?"
That's the kind of stuff they'll be
talking about up at Berkeley today,
and from now until some time late in
November—or December.
While Stanford's education grads
and bawlout conscious summer stu
dents commence the quarterly worry
about finals, California's fall semester
registration brings football back up to
first place in the annual realignment
of conversation topics.
At Berkeley, the answer to that Rose
Bowl query is, ''Pretty fair."
Down here, if anyone should ask, it,
would be, "Who knows?"
Of course, it isn't actually football
season yet—not till September 15. But
the mid-summer opening of Berkeley,
Santa Clara, and other semester-sys
tem Northern California schools some
how lights the fuse for gridiron propa
ganda and crap-shooting formations
(lifted from Pegler).
All is not rosy, or Rose Bowly, on
the Stanford football horizon. But all
isn't necessarily black either. The best
authorities, and their word can't be
taken for much when it refers to Stan
ford's chances in the 1936 campaign,
seem to think the Cardinals will not
win the Pacific Coast championship.
But they each believe that Coach Tiny
Thornhill's Red machine will not be
as bad as other experts think.
In short, the most feasible-sounding
prediction is that Stanford will be
something between mediocre and good
as compared to her seven conference
opponents.
The work of California and Southern
California alumni, which was started
some two years back when it became
apparent Stanford was at the peak of
a prosperity wave, has finally mate
rialized and accounted for many var
sity players which will be hard to stop.
The Golden Bears, whose sopho
mores last year strangely resembled
the Thornhill sophs of 1933, will reach
a peak that has not been surpassed at
Berkeley since the Wonder Team days.
Southern California's 1936 squad, if
the Trojan public relations department
can be trusted, will be more like the
Howard Jones machine of old than the
more recent S.C. fodder.
Washington rates a tie with the
Bears and Trojans in the pre-season
dope, and Stanford seems to conn:
next —along with Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, and U.C*L.A.
This arrangement, you understand, is
purely arbitrary; they haven't award
ed the championship as yet.
The annual remark, "It'll be a tough
season all around," finally has come
true. Each of these eight teams will
play the other seven this year, and
that innovation in Coast Conference
procedure still has Santa Clara, St.
Mary's, and other independents—nec
essarily shut out by the full confer
ence schedules—on the war-path.
Although Stanford, defending a
three-year record of participation in
the Rose Bowl, officially is the team to
beat, no one is taking this particularly
seriously. California, Washington, and
S.C. aren't nearly as much impressed
with Stanford as they are with each
other—and themselves.
That can be explained on the
strength of the fact that 15 Cardinal
lettermen, including nine first string
ers, have been graduated from last
year's team.
Best bets on the way this year's
squad will line up at the outset seem
to have Carl Schott, Chet Olcott, and
Jack Clarke as the leading ends; Pop
Grant, Pete Zagar, Dave Carnahan,
and Bob Mangan as a much better
tackle-department, than most people
