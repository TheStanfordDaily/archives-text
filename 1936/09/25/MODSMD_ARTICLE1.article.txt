# 9,000 Acres To Play In
## 
### 
i/"\N AN alluvial plain, washed down from the north side of the
V-ySanta Cruz mountains and bulging out into San Francisco Bay
there is a University. It has buildings, many of them beautiful. It
has acres of fields and rolling foothills. It has stadia and swim
ming pools, professors and books.
Taken in the lump they mean nothing. The Stanford Farm
spreads out for a space of 9,000 acres. But 9,000 acres and build
ings, books, and swimming pools if there is nothing else mean
nothing. There is a co-ordination, something has blown the breath
of life into this sleeping giant. A vision and an ideal did it per
haps. Rationally, you may suppose, there is nothing that would
cause a pioneer railroad builder to want the children of California
I to be his children. But there was.
Rationally, you may suppose, there is nothing that would cause
men to want to struggle for an abstract thing, an amorphous mass.
Why do professors stay here on the campus at lower salaries when
they could go somewhere else? Does the Stanford symbol repre
sent something to them more than a group of buildings, a flash of
red-jerseyed football players fighting Lilliputian battles in a Biob
dingnagian way?
There is a meaning to Stanford.
You may live here for four years and never sense it, never
feel it. You may pay your SI 15 a guarter and feel that you have
contributed your share. If you feel that way it is all right. No
body is expecting anything more, rationally. For rationally, there
is no meaning to Stanford. Rationally, all it is is a group of build
ings, professors, and books, grade systems, bawlout averages,
extracurricular activities.
But there is something here at Stanford for you if you want 1o
dig it out.
Nobody is asking you to dig it out, except in your own peculiar
way. Rationally, of course, there is no reason why you should
I want to. Nobody is going to be standing over you at Stanford and
demanding that you learn to think, to develop a scientific curiosity,
to know about yourself, or your historical heritage, because ra
tionally, there is no reason why you should.
Nine thousand acres to play in. Infinite opportunities to creak
something. Infinite opportunities to destroy. Nine thousand
acres to play with your destiny. Four or more years to mold it in
Rationally, of course, you will be a fool about it. Will you?
