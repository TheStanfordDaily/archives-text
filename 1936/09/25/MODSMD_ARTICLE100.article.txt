### 
Promises for one of the finest
tennis seasons was given Coach
Sherman Lockwood by a Stanford
team that has been touring the east
all summer with signal success, and
which returns to competition this
year.
Ben Dey and Bill Seward led off
by winning the National Collegiate
doubles crown in Chicago June 28,
defeating Bickel and Burgess of
Chicago in the final 9-7, 6-2, 6-3 in
the final. Dey was Stanford's best
singles bowing to Verr/bn
John of U.S.C. 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 in the
semifinals. John was defeated by
Ernest Sutter of Tulane in the
final.
In the Eastern Intercollegiate
Championships at New York July
4, Seward and Bob Underwood won
the doubles crown with an 8-6,
6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3 score from Gui
board and Anderson of Dartmouth.
Stanford also walked off with the
team championship at this tourney,
scoring 28 points. Miami, 22, and
Dartmouth, 17, trailed.
Principal loss to this year's team
will be the graduation of Captain
John Law. Remaining as first rate
players are Seward, Dey, Under
wood, Bob Braly, and Bob Pommer,
Sherwood Armstrong, up from the
frosh, also should be a winner this
time.
