# Olympic Trials Prove Dismal For Card Hopes
## Slinger Dunn Alone Of Ten Stanford Track Men Reaches Berlin 
### 
There have been dismal days in
Stanford track and field history,
but one of the all-time highs was
reached July 12 last at Randall's
Island Stadium, New York, when
exactly one of 10 Stanford men sur
vived the final eliminations for the
United States Olympic team.
It may have been the heat, the
uncertain footing of the new
grounds, an unknown jinx, Dink
Templeton's absence, the law of
averages, or jurt plain hard luck,
but no matter what, Slinger Dunn,
winner of the discus, was the only
Stanford man. past or present, to
make the Berlin track squad. Dunn
went on to take second to Ken
C/arpenter's 165-7 in the Berlin
final.
Ben Eastman landed sixth in the
1:51 flat 800 after a promising
practice season in which he hit
1:50.1. Ben's only remark was "I
never did get to feeling I could run
right today."
Phil Levy spent another nervous
night and finished fifth in the dis
cus to Dunn's 157-7. Levy had pre
viously broken the Stanford rec
ord at the Pacific Coast intercolle
giates with 170-10.
Jim Reynolds was likewise fifth
when it took a third to win a boat
ride, throwing 49-10 behind Jack
Torrance's winning throw of 51-6.
Dunn was fourth with 50-I*4. John
Lyman did not return to this coun
try to qualify, hence was kept from
competition; however, he did take
a long enough intermission from
his studies at Heidelburg to serve
as attache for the American team
in Berlin.
Jack Weiershauser ended seventh
in the 200-meter finals after a
long and successful barnstorming
season that promises him to be a
foundation of Templeton's 1937 var
sity. Ed Burrows was an also-ran
in the 1500, which was won by
Glenn Cunningham in the then
sub-Olympic time of 3:49.9. Bur
rows hitch-hiked most of the way
to the New York finals after hav
ing run 3:56.4 in Los Angeles trials,
a time that might make him a 4:17
miler next year.
Norm Bright, after having re
corded far and away the best 5000-
meter times in the country, sprained
an ankle muscle in the final lap of
a wild race finally won by both
Louie Zamperini and Don Lash,
and finished fifth.
