# Veteran Water Poloists Favored To Regain Title
## 
### 
Seeking to make up for last sea
son's most disastrous record of 23
years, Coach Nort Thornton's water
polo varsity will start practice next
week in preparation for attempts to
regain the Conference title, now
held by California.
Hopes this year are exceedingly
bright, and although Cal is still the
team to beat, Stanford will prob
ably be at even odds with the Ber
keieyites when comes ihe competi
tive season.
Captain Bob Haslacher, the Pa
cific Coast's outstanding goal guard
for the past two years, will return
for a final season and should be the
spark plug of the team.
A veteran backfi >ld of Chuck Gif
fin, Ben Voss, and Don Peterson
should capably hold Thornton's
guard worries in check.
At forwards, however, the situ
ation is different; graduation of
Co-captains Wiget and Woodward,
and Clemo and Sutherland leaves
a large order to fill.
Bob Hoover will be the remaining
letterman forward, while Jack Vi
bert will handle the sprint posi-

I tion, where he should be able to
take the ball from any sprint com- i
petition now known on the coast. I
Bill Hanna, 190 pounds of bee% J
! "burned up" the pool in Thornton's !
six weeks' spring practice session,
and John Lamb, a frosh last year
j whose ball handling has caused him i
to be called the "Luisetti of water
polo," might ably help form a suc
cessful forward combination,
i :
Stanford is in two leaguesâ€”the ;
I Southern Division of the Pacific j
' Coast Conference, along with Cali
fornia, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.. and
| also the Northern California Water
i Polo League, which numbers as
members the Olympic Club, the j
Athens Club, and San Jose State.
First competition will be with the
i Athens Club about the middle of
! October, while freshman water polo !
J schedules will begin about the same '
time.
