# Card Golfers Win Laurels Over Summer
## Team Places Second In North Shore Tourney; Stewart, Edwards Star 
### John Dern 
A successful summer of compe- j
lit ion behind them, Stanford's var- j
sity golfers will begin arriving on
the Farm in the next few days, 1
"itching," as Coach Ed Twiggs says, .
"to get going on another good sea- ;
son."
Height of the summer's endeavors
was the International Golf Associa
tion Championship held June 22-27
at the North Shore Golf Club,
Chicago, in which Stanford finished
but two strokes behind the winning j
Yale team. Eight men made the
trip to represent the Farm, four of
.hem paying their own expenses.
Coach Twiggs accompanied the
boys.
Second to Yale
"Spec" Stewart, Jack Wallace, \
Don Edwards, and Louie Cass shot !
the four best scores to give Stan
ford a team total of 628. Yale's best
four took a (i 26. Notre Dame with '
a 630 was followed closely by Michi
gan, last year's champion, North- j
western, and Princeton. Only one
stroke separated these latter teams.
Stewart shot but one round above
the par 72 for the course. Had not I
C;iss suffered a poor 84 on his first j
round, Stanford would have re- j
turned with the Golf Association of j
America Trophy.
Thompson Stricken
Bob Thompson suffered an attack .
of appendicitis, which also helped j
to alter the final results, a few days !
before the competition. Morse Er- ,
skine, Bob Welch. Pete Hass, and
Henry Edwards also competed for
the Indians.
The best 32 scores during the team
play served as qualifications for the
individual championship playoff.
Stewart, 149; Wallace, 15G; and Don
Edwards, 158, qualified for Stanford.
Stewart downed Lynn Day of Notre
Dame in the first round and Woody I
Malloy of Michigan in the second, i
playing the best golf of the entire '
32. Paul Leslie of Louisiana State, >
runner-up to Charles Kocsis of
Michigan, defeated Stewart 3 and 2, I
even though the Stanford lad was
two under par.
Manning Competes
During the rest of the summer,
Stanford men were active independ
ently. Cal Manning, last year's
frosh sensation, reached the quar
ter-finals in the lowa State Golf
Tourney at Waterloo in July. Jack
Wallace also competed and did well,
going out on a 70. Cal followed up
his fine work in Waterloo by re
taining his City Championship for
the second year in Ottumwa, lowa.
Jeeb Halaby also showed up well j
with a championship on the South j
this summer. Don Edwards com- '
peted in the Western Champion- |
ships at Omaha, though troubled j
with a side muscle pulled in llinois I
one cold evening just before the |
Intercollegiates.
Stars Not to Return
"Spec" Stewart, Don Edwards, |
Bob Thompson, and Morse Erskine
will be lost to this year's varsity. !
Twiggs lists Bill O'Neal, held out
for his final year of eligibility, John
Crable, Jim Dillon, Brown Cannon, i
A1 Hyman, Lassy Davis, Hass, Hal- !
aby, and Wallace as his best hopes
for this year's team.
