# Card Athletes Pile Up Wins During Year
## 
### 
Here's the all-sports record for !
1935-36 that this year's Farm teams j
will be running competition with:
Although the total number of
points rolled up by the "Vowing t
Sophs" was not very great, being 87
to their opponents' 12, it was enough i
to earn a tie for first place in con- j
ference standings and the "Big Red !
Toboggan" slid into the Rose Bowl j
once more, where Southern Metho- j
dist and its followers were sent !
back to Texas broke.
Conference lloop Win
"Smiling John" Bunn's hoopsters
did even better, winning the South
ern Conference after a playoff with
Southern Cal, and going on to win I
the Pacific Coast championship by !
swamping Washington in two
straight games. In the round-robin
tournament to determine the Pacific
Coast representative to the tourna
ment in New York for the XI Olym- i
piad basketball team, Stanford lost '
to Oregon State in the semi-finals.
Three outstanding events put the |
track squad in the headlines: 1
"Dink's" boys took Cal to the
cleaners in a very decisive manner; i
the Fresno relays saw them earn a j
tie with Southern Cal; and an eight
man team took fourth in the NCAA
meet at Chicago.
Tennis Team in Wins
The tennis team, while splitting
with both southern Cal and Cal, '
took a clean sweep from UCLA,
later went on to win the National
Collegiate Championship. Handi
capped by a lack of experienced 1
players, the baseball squad had a
tough season.
Card natators swam to a victory j
over Cal, continuing a winning |
streak for 19 years, and coppcd sec
ond place in the outhern Division
Championships. Golfers took both
individual and team honors in the
California Collegiate meet at Peb
ble Beach, and also took Cal by a
good margin. In June, the niblick
men were second to Yale in NCAA
golf competition.
YVatcr Poloists Third
Water poloists, for the first time \

in 22 seasons, failed to win the Pa- J
cific Coast Championship, and had '
to be content with third in the final 1
playoff.
Improving steadily as the season
progressed, the soccer team finished
the year with third place. Ruggers ;
took a tic with Southern Cal for
their payoff at the end of the season. I
Stanford boxers ended a fairly j
successful season with a fourth
place in the Pacific Coast Inter- !
collegiate Championships.

ference standings and the "Big Red !
Toboggan" slid into the Rose Bowl j
once more, where Southern Metho- j
dist and its followers were sent !
back to Texas broke.
Conference lloop Win

did even better, winning the South
ern Conference after a playoff with
Southern Cal, and going on to win I
the Pacific Coast championship by !
swamping Washington in two
