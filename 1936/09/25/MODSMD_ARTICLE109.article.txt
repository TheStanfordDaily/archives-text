# Beavers Win Coast League
## Ducks To Meet Oaks In Baseball Finals

One of the tightest scrambles of

land for the championship in a best
four-game series, the Ducks having
won their way to the final by four
straight wins over the Seattle In
dians, and the Oaks are leading 3
to 1 over San Diego's Padres.
The league season was a see-saw
affair throughout, with Oakland and
Seattle holding an edge in the early
stage of the campaign. In the lat
ter stages, however, the race broke
wide open, with four-way ties the

fare and often the first live teams
Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Mis
sions, and Oakland, often within
three games of each other.
Pitching leaders were Wee Lu
dolph of Oakland, 21 wins, (J losses,
and Jack Salveson of Los Angeles,
21 wins, 7 losses. Leading at bat
work were Joe Marty, San Fran
cisco outfielder, .I! 59; Johnny Fred

Bassler, Seattle catcher, .352.
