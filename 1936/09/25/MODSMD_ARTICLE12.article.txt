# Grut Taste Vanishes From Campus Water
## 
### 
Stanford water no longer tastes
like something out of the nether
regions! That, to many returning
students, will be the biggest news
of this issue.
For the past six months the Uni
versity has been renovating its res
ervoir and pipe line system, ac
cording to Assistant Comptroller
Alfred L. Trowbridge. While re
pairs were going on, the water was
liberally dosed with chlorine to in
sure its safety.
Chlorine Content Reduced
Now, according to Trowbridge,
the reservoir atop San Juan Hill
has been cleaned, many of the pipes
have been replaced, and it is safe
to reduce the chlorine content of
the water to a point where the
taste is imperceptible.
Repairs have not yet been com
pleted. however. Further pipe .re
placements are whedulsd to take
place, and the work will be com
pleted sometime this quarter.
"No Cross Connections"
"Pipes were traced for cross con
nections, but, despite rumors float
ing around the campus, none were
found," Trowbridge told The Daily.
"However, it was thought best to
replace many of the pipes, and give
the reservoir a complete cleaning,"
he added.
