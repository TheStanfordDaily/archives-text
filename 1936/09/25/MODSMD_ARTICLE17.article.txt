# HANDBOOK REVEALS LOWDOWN
## 
### 
Containing everything from the |
j lowdown on campus politics (com- ,
! monly called the gravy train) to in-
I structions on how to converse with
1 co-eds, the 1936-37 edition of the
' A.S.S.U. Handbook, more commonly
! known as the Frosh Bible, will be i
distributed to freshmen, both men
and women, at their rooms Friday,
the first day of the Pre-registration
Period.
"That is," hastily adds Editor
Frank Fullenwider, "if the books ar- J
rive from the printers. They have
been known to be late before."
Breezy Stories
The new volume, which appears at j
first glance to be a thick and unin
teresting tome, is in reality crammed
! with useful information written in a
j breezy and interesting manner.
Starting with a more thorough de-
I scription of the campus than has
ever been attempted in these books
; before, the volume continues with a
I listing of campus traditions, a brave
but hopeless attempt to explain the
j confusing intricacies of the grade
. point system, and takes a few well
i known cracks at the student body
[government and its officers. Fullcn
l wider was exceptionally well quali
j fied to write this section, as he was
one of the authors of the present
A.S.S.U. Constitution and served on
.Executive Committee for two terms.
The book contains the onlv obtain- '

able copy of campus traffic regula
tions.
How To Get Out
Listing the various activities, how
to get out for them, and to what po
sitions one may expect to rise, the
volume discusses publications (The
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral), dra
matics, debating, music, concert se
ries, and athletics.
The book contains fraternity and
sorority rushing rules, plugs for the
dormitories and eating clubs (the
latter arc unique Stanford institu
tions which satisfy the craving for
social clubs without the rigamarole
of fraternities), and lists the more
prominent honorary clubs and so
cieties.
(»as and Alky Again
Another new feature of the Hand
book is the "Social Slants" section,
in which Fullenwidcr was assisted
by Joyce Dunkerly, former Roble
sponsor, and Marco Thorne. "Social
Slants' gives hints on campus life
and its customs, including Quad
conduct, men's and women's wear
ing apparel for Quad and more for
mal wear, local dating customs, some
elementary etiquette, and a few sug
gestions on how to reconcile the Ad
ministration's attitude on liquor
with your own.
Quoting President Wilbur's oft
quoted statement that "gasoline and
alcohol do not mix," Fullenwidcr
adds, "The funny part of it is that

| he's right. Anyone in college who j
drinks enough so that it impairs his j
1 health or his ability to study is a
fool.
"Campus opinion," the volume :
says, "frowns on getting tight in a
! public place. It invariably makes a
| man look ridiculous and a woman |
1 disgusting. The man who goes out |
with a girl and gets swacked is noth- |
I ing less than a heel. If the girl gets !
blotto also, all sympathy for her ,
fades and it is the consensus of opin- >
ion that she deserves whatever she \
gets."
Stanford Couples
The volume mentions some of the !
! off-campus spots to which students 1
are habitually attracted. This latter j
section mentions Palo Alto theaters
and dining places, some of San 1
Francisco's hotels and dancing spots,
and outdoor resorts in the vicinity.
Particularly double-edged is Fullen
wider's remark. "Del Monte has also
been a fevorite resort for Stanford !
couples."
Usual Dictionary
The frosh dictionary, always the
most amusing section of the book,
contains such definitions as:
"A.S.S.U.- -Breeding ground of fu
ture ward healers and political wire
pullers maintained by the struggling
dues payer whose only return is the
merry but expensive entertainment
of birding the big shots.
' "Dull Session The midnight con- 1

ference where you can learn prac
tically everything but how to pass
the econ ex next morning. Typical
start—'Shall we begin with sex now
or get around to it later?'
"Class Lecture —Process where
by the notes of the professor be
come those of the student without
going through the brains of either.
"Die Luft der Frieheit VVoht —
University motto. Translated it
means, 'Make all checks payable
to Stanford University.
"Lockout—A misnomer, as they
let you in and give you hell; worth
it in the long run.
"Men's Council —An amazing
system of jurisprudence perpe
trated by reformed sinners sitting
in judgment on better men and
damned nervous about it.
"San Francisco A collection of
half a dozen hotels and a jail. It
costs just as much to get out of
any of them.
"Time Schedule — The Admin
istration's recognition of the Chi
neze puzzle addict. Would be use
ful if solvable."
Departing from the custom of pre
vious years, the A.S.S.U. Handbook
docs not contain a copy of the A.S.
S.U. by-laws. These, together with
the Constitution, will he printed in a
separate, smaller edition and be
made available at a later date to
the >se interested.
