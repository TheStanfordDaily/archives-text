# New Students Given Welcome By Dr. Wilbur
## 
### 
Each year the Stanford family i
welcomes a large group of students
who are new to our campus. It is a
time of enthusiasm and inspiration.
We want those who come here to
love the University and all of its
surroundings as those of us do who
have been here for many years.
We want them, too, to join in on j
the protection and development of
our University. My own suggestion
is to try to find out just as much as
you can about the University for |
yourself, from those who are al
ready here and from careful read
ing of the various University pub
lications.
It is important from the very be
ginning to learn to read systemat
ically the student publications as
they appear. This is one of the best
ways to become a useful and active
member of the University.

To all new and old students I ex
tend a hearty welcome.
Already campus activity is well
under way, with the early return
of freshman and varsity football j
players. All students who can pos- i
sibly do so should plan to return |
Saturday for the Santa Clara game, j
Our team will need your support.
The preregistration program,
should prove very beneficial to the
new students, as well as the stu- 1
dent body. The few days that the
new students are to have about the
campus before registration will al
low them to become better ac
quainted with Stanford from the
very beginning.
The pre - registration program
new students coupled with the j
Santa Clara game will send us off
to a flying start. And with your i
help and co-operation we should j
have a most successful year.
