# They Call It The Farm

Tucked in between wings of the two largest men's dormitories on the cam
pus, the Toyon Court (above) gives the mothers the impression that their sons
are surrounded by the homey atmosphere of a rock garden. It really looks


Since its completion, the Basketball Pavilion has been Stanford's indoor playground. On various
evenings it has housed everything from concerts to the Masgue Ball. The new theatre may dim its
lights for more serious occasions.



Above is the Democratic sub
station, Stanford's most popular
contact with the "outside world."
To upper classmen it's a place to
deposit "I need money" letters, to
frosh, at first, it's the post office.


Take the Row or leave it, no one can deny that the beautiful neo-classic
exterior of the Phi Gamma Delta house typifies that certain cultured smooth
ness. It's in this section as the symbol of a definite part of Stanford, the
epitome of "standing." You'll find out about the insides later.
Once, the Fiji house was the most beautiful on the campus. Today, with
all the Row re-doing its houses, it is now less of a notable example of what
a fraternity can be than formerly.


After you've graduated, you'll realize that the Chapel dominates more than Stanford's skyline. It plays a
big part in the Farm's pageant, though it is peopled only a few times a week and is vocal only one. Freshmen
attend "to see the place," often return.


This is the straight and narrow. After an all-night bull session,
Encina darklings pour themselves into this narrow funnel that leads
from the free-and-easy room to the high-ceilinged Quad cubes,
where students receive what mama and papa sent them here to
get. In winter it is leafless, in spring it is a long green arcade with
the barrel arch of the English corner peeping in the far end. Stu
dents learn to love this lane, like anything connected with extreme
emotions. It will become your own during first finals.
On your way to class it will be the most amazingly short walk
on the campus. On your way to lunch it will be the longest. After
a month or so, you'll know every tree, every groove in the con
crete. Engineers cut across back of the libe. Chemists won't bother
with it. But Social Science majors always use it.


At left is the library. It contains
books. You'll tend to use it on those
"nights before" -and of course, the
book you want will be out. If you're
a student, you'll find enough re
search material to keep you busy
12 hours a day. You'll also find li
brarians eager to help with that term
paper, or that awful ex.
It is most decidedly not the place
to go Friday nights. And if you really
want to get down to business you
won't attempt to do your stuff in the
reserve book room. There aisles are
not aisles, but skidways.
Famous for their bull sessions,
Toyon and Branner Halls (right) are
the bulwark of hall politics. They
may look quiet from faraway, but
they're not. Freshmen, however,
needn't worry about the noise, largely
because they have to bod down at
Kncinrji anyway Real honest to good
