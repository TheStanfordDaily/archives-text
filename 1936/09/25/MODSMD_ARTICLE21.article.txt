# Daily To Hold First Tryouts October 5
## 
### 
A chance to write stories and see
them in print, to be on the inside
i of campus events as staff member of
I a daily newspaper-—is offered to all
1 new students, including freshmen,
J at the first Stanford Daily tryouteo
meeting in the Journalism Library,
October 5 at 5:00 p.m.

This year the Daily offers not only
a new "front," but new and enlarged
offices and new services and equip
ment— including a speedy "pony"
telephone wire service and a model
newspaper darkroom. A picture
service to keep pace with news cov
erage has been arranged, and the
call is as much for photographers as
for writers.
Reporters and photographers will
be chosen from tryoutees qualifying
during the tryoutee period—con
sisting of a few short meetings to
tell newcomers of the Daily system.
Previous experience is entirely un
necessary.
