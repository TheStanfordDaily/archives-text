### 
Stanford is holding a Pre-Registration Period this week-end to wel
come the incoming Lower Division students, freshmen and sophomores,
and acquaint them with the University, its traditions, its practices, its
shortcuts, and its angles.
Living quarters will open Friday morning in order that students may
become settled before start of the formal program on Saturday.
The week-end period will include conferences with faculty advisors,
meetings with talks by University heads, bull-sessions with campus big-

► shots, tours to interesting campus
; spots, a barbecue on the top of one
of the hills back of the campus, and
j a matriculation service in the Chapel
by the new Stanford Chaplain, Dr.
I D. Elton Trueblood.
Oldsters on the campus who re
! member the horrors of their first
registration day can envy the luck
I of this year's frosh who will have a
| leisurely period to make out their
j first course of study with their ad
! visors.
Will Discuss Honor Code
j Freshmen of past years used ot
I hear a great deal of talk about the
; Honor Code and traditions without
! knowing exactly what was referred
I to; this year, student leaders will
i have friendly chats with small
[ groups about characteristic fea
j tures of campus life.
Even many of the older students
; at Stanford have never got around
j to see such campus sights as the
! Wind Tunnel, the University Press,
the Museum, or the Art Gallery.
| On Sunday of the Pre-reg period,
campus leaders will conduct small
I groups around to see some of these
| spots, and probably will take in the
j workings of such places as the Li
j brary, the A. S. S. U. offices.
Barbecue Sunday
The climax of the period is to be
a barbecue for new Lower Division
students on Stanford Hill Sunday
evening back of the 16th green of
the golf course, where a view of the
campus can give the frosh an idf»a
of the whole Stanford setting.
The Pre - registration period
evolved from the suggestion of Al
mon E. Roth, Comptroller of the
University, at an Honor Code panel
discussion of Men's and Women's
Councils last spring.
Reg Day Rush Eliminated
The Code discussion had brought
; out the fact that freshmen had not
known Stanford traditions or rules,
and therefore violated them. It also
showed that the rush of Registration
, Day had started off many a fresh
j man on the wrong courses.
Backed by A. S. S. U., the Stan
ford student body organization, the
period is under the direction of the
j Stanford Cardinals, headed by Chick
I F rani eh. Faculty members arc as
sisting the students with speeches,
and in the Saturday morning course
i of study conferences.

evening back of the 16th green of
the golf course, where a view of the
campus can give the frosh an idf»a
of the whole Stanford setting.
The Pre - registration period
evolved from the suggestion of Al
mon E. Roth, Comptroller of the
University, at an Honor Code panel
discussion of Men's and Women's
Councils last spring.
Reg Day Rush Eliminated
The Code discussion had brought
; out the fact that freshmen had not
known Stanford traditions or rules,
and therefore violated them. It also
showed that the rush of Registration
, Day had started off many a fresh
j man on the wrong courses.
Backed by A. S. S. U., the Stan
ford student body organization, the
period is under the direction of the
j Stanford Cardinals, headed by Chick
I F rani eh. Faculty members arc as
sisting the students with speeches,
and in the Saturday morning course
i of study conferences.
Stanford is holding a Pre-Registration Period this week-end to wel
come the incoming Lower Division students, freshmen and sophomores,
and acquaint them with the University, its traditions, its practices, its
shortcuts, and its angles.
Living quarters will open Friday morning in order that students may
become settled before start of the formal program on Saturday.
The week-end period will include conferences with faculty advisors,
meetings with talks by University heads, bull-sessions with campus big-

► shots, tours to interesting campus
; spots, a barbecue on the top of one
of the hills back of the campus, and
j a matriculation service in the Chapel
by the new Stanford Chaplain, Dr.
I D. Elton Trueblood.
Oldsters on the campus who re
! member the horrors of their first
registration day can envy the luck
I of this year's frosh who will have a
| leisurely period to make out their
j first course of study with their ad
! visors.
Will Discuss Honor Code
j Freshmen of past years used ot
I hear a great deal of talk about the
; Honor Code and traditions without
! knowing exactly what was referred
I to; this year, student leaders will
i have friendly chats with small
[ groups about characteristic fea
j tures of campus life.
Even many of the older students
; at Stanford have never got around
j to see such campus sights as the
! Wind Tunnel, the University Press,
the Museum, or the Art Gallery.
| On Sunday of the Pre-reg period,
campus leaders will conduct small
I groups around to see some of these
