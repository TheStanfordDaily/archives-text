# SOUR GRIPES

This life of the Stu'.aorH Daily's
Salvation Army cicw of editorial
soul-savers is a hard one and the
worst part about it is singing sal
vation to a bunch of souls who
would rather know the cold dope
on collegiate sin th;tn be saved
from it.
The cold dope is, unfortunately,
and this is written not only for the
freshman class but also for the re
porters of the San Francisco Call-
Bulletin who seem to consider Stan
ford women the most interestingly
naughty females on the hoof, that
the Farm is pretty pure, although
the place is .as full as any high
chool of fakers who sedulously
cultivate the appearance of having
::een much and done more.
Let it be known, though, that
success and not sin is the under
graduate's god almighty and the
most successful people—i.e., those
who get the most rewards for the
lea I effort—are those who started
<ally. By successful people we
ate not referring to the politicians,
who know enough how to put
friendship on a commercial mass
production basis for ultimate con
sumption at the polls. Rather, we
peak of those who are listed in the
hawlout as manager or secretary
of some organization which seems
10 and does—exist only, for the
purpose of socking suckers a 10- or
20-dollar initiation fee.
To bring the discussion more out
from under the tablecloth, the
In : hman debate squad and Encina
Club, for instance, are legitimate
cnlrrprises and there is a certain
amount of gravy accruing to the
manager of each. It is doubtful if
more than three candidates went
out lor either job last year. And
yet (he chances are that either one
11 the other of those managers will
!>c student manager within three
tr four years with the power of a
'filler and the income and privi
eg< s approximating those of the
■■'resident.
Not that we are urging everyone
o suddenly decide to be debate
.nnnager or Encina Club manager,
'Lit ralher are we pointing out that
he process of getting on the gravy
rain at the beginning is reasonably
easy. Infinitely simpler, in fact,
.han trying to board the jugger
naut when it has gathered a year
or two's momentum. Nor are the
accommodations at first particu
larly gold-plated, but there is a
:;mdency as time goes on for the
-noils to be divided strictly among
-hose "on board" rather than to
jo tossed out for any outsider to
oick up.
By now Machiavelli and not Gen
ral Evangeline Boothe will claim
is as his own. Certainly the senti
nents don't jibe with what the
Jean's letter has been preaching
ill summer. At the same time, the
Vcshman class ought to be fore
warned that the gravy has always
/one to the people who made up
'heir minds to get it. And started
)ut after it—early.
