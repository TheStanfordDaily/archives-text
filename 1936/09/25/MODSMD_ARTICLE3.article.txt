You should see Farmer's and Mendelowitz's Gi aphic Art stooges try to get these arches (above) and
that tall palm onto paper. Right behind those three arches is the Memorial Court. Stanford has a lot
of traditions and memorial this and that, but you get used to it.

little pathway in the foreground leads to a coke at the

Sanctum (above) of the newly appointed Chaplain Elton Trueblood, the Vestry of the Chapel holds
as much appeal for the bride and bridegroom as the mosaic front holds for the Eastern tourist. The
newly wedded couple flies out the Vestry door as mother and dad come running in the front. That
isn't snow on the ground and bushes, nor is the sky clearing after a Southern California storm. It is
merely the effect of a photographer's nightmare and the use of infra-red film to fool the Freshman
who plans to ski on the campus. There is the Stan ford Ski Club, however.

WHEN grizzled alumni come back to Stanford and walk through
the Quad, you mustn't mock their evident nostalgia. For you
will be just as they are when The Farm has receded thirty years into
memory's perspective.
They love it as you will, for the Quad is their's, every last stone of
it. And as you walk through it, you'll find a certain sense of posses
sion coming over you—for the Quad to most of us has come to sym
bolize a hundred things other than the classes, books, and chance
meetings whose connections with it are obvious.
You mustn't look at it objectively. Nothing could be more out of
place than high windows in low buildings, mosaics trying to be chro
matic instead of geometrical, renaissance cornices on plain arches.
No one but adoring tourists kid themselves into admiring the Quad
as an artistically valid creation.
The true Stanfordite learns to use it as a symbol of his own dear
disordered college memories.
You'll find, as the years go by, that the Quad's brown stone is a
perfect surface for emotional overlays. And, most precious of all,
you'll find that the Quad seems to grow up with you, never do you
grow away from it.
That's why Stanfordites returning to the Farm never smile in
dulgently on the dear old Quad. It's still serious stuff to them, the
epitome of a great adventure that may be bought—but is never
paid for.
It will become part of you, and more importantly, you will be
come a part of it—there's no attitude proof against this strange merg
ing of identities.

If you have lost all interest in football, if it is too cold for swimming, if the
tennis courts are still wet, and if the Roble acquaintance is out riding with your
best friend, then here is the place to go. They have books there.

WHEN grizzled alumni come back to Stanford and walk through
the Quad, you mustn't mock their evident nostalgia. For you
will be just as they are when The Farm has receded thirty years into
memory's perspective.
They love it as you will, for the Quad is their's, every last stone of
it. And as you walk through it, you'll find a certain sense of posses
sion coming over you—for the Quad to most of us has come to sym
bolize a hundred things other than the classes, books, and chance
meetings whose connections with it are obvious.
You mustn't look at it objectively. Nothing could be more out of
place than high windows in low buildings, mosaics trying to be chro
matic instead of geometrical, renaissance cornices on plain arches.
No one but adoring tourists kid themselves into admiring the Quad
as an artistically valid creation.
The true Stanfordite learns to use it as a symbol of his own dear
disordered college memories.
You'll find, as the years go by, that the Quad's brown stone is a
perfect surface for emotional overlays. And, most precious of all,
you'll find that the Quad seems to grow up with you, never do you
grow away from it.
That's why Stanfordites returning to the Farm never smile in
dulgently on the dear old Quad. It's still serious stuff to them, the
epitome of a great adventure that may be bought—but is never
paid for.
It will become part of you, and more importantly, you will be
come a part of it—there's no attitude proof against this strange merg
ing of identities.

If you have lost all interest in football, if it is too cold for swimming, if the
tennis courts are still wet, and if the Roble acquaintance is out riding with your
best friend, then here is the place to go. They have books there.

It will become part of you, and more importantly, you will be
come a part of it—there's no attitude proof against this strange merg
ing of identities.

If you have lost all interest in football, if it is too cold for swimming, if the
tennis courts are still wet, and if the Roble acquaintance is out riding with your
best friend, then here is the place to go. They have books there.



Seating approximately 89,000 people
the Stanford Stadium (right) is scene of
spectacles ranging from gridiron clas
sics and Olympic trials to Presidential
acceptance speeches.
Through its gates yearly pour the
persons whose money fills the coffers
of the Board of Athletic Control pre
sided over by Graduate Manager A1
Masters. Money which provides dor
mitories, pavilions, and smooth office
eguipment for the BAC building.
A rear view of the clock tower (left)
opposite the main library. This serves
as an ever-present reminder to students
languishing on the library steps that
time and profs wait for no man. The
eaves furnish annual accommodations
for wayward swallows seeking free tui
tion. When the birds' presence be
comes too evident, the Board of Trus
tees finds it necessary for Custodian in
charge of the south side of the Quad to
clean up the mess and the nests.

You should see Farmer's and Mendelowitz's Gi aphic Art stooges try to get these arches (above) and
that tall palm onto paper. Right behind those three arches is the Memorial Court. Stanford has a lot
of traditions and memorial this and that, but you get used to it.


This section doesn't include a picture of Encina,
because most of the Freshmen will be over at Roble
(above) by the second week anyway. The ducky
little pathway in the foreground leads to a coke at the
Union about 9 o'clock every night.



Sanctum (above) of the newly appointed Chaplain Elton Trueblood, the Vestry of the Chapel holds
as much appeal for the bride and bridegroom as the mosaic front holds for the Eastern tourist. The
newly wedded couple flies out the Vestry door as mother and dad come running in the front. That
isn't snow on the ground and bushes, nor is the sky clearing after a Southern California storm. It is
merely the effect of a photographer's nightmare and the use of infra-red film to fool the Freshman
who plans to ski on the campus. There is the Stan ford Ski Club, however.


Scene of annual springtime water cai
nivals sponsored by the Junior Class, Lake
Lagunita (above) puts on a yearly disap
pearing act by filling up after winter rains
only to dry up as June approaches.
But don't let the ads fool you: you can't
kiss a girl in a canoe.
To the left—the engineering corner is
a haven for Chaparral hawkers once a
month. Dramatic Council also sells its
tickets to campus productions on this spot.
Early rising engineering students ogle the
few beautiful girls as they pass by in tim*.
to the eight o'clock chimes of the clock
tower seen in the background.
Peculiar little pagoda in the back
ground packs big stuff. Every guarter of
an hour the telechron lets loose on the
Westminister chimes, startling the stu
dents in Blackwelder's Geology I out of
a sound sleep. When the chime rings at
11 o'clock the Row cooks pop the potatoes
into the oven.


WHEN grizzled alumni come back to Stanford and walk through
the Quad, you mustn't mock their evident nostalgia. For you
will be just as they are when The Farm has receded thirty years into
memory's perspective.
They love it as you will, for the Quad is their's, every last stone of
it. And as you walk through it, you'll find a certain sense of posses
sion coming over you—for the Quad to most of us has come to sym
bolize a hundred things other than the classes, books, and chance
meetings whose connections with it are obvious.
You mustn't look at it objectively. Nothing could be more out of
place than high windows in low buildings, mosaics trying to be chro
matic instead of geometrical, renaissance cornices on plain arches.
No one but adoring tourists kid themselves into admiring the Quad
as an artistically valid creation.
The true Stanfordite learns to use it as a symbol of his own dear
disordered college memories.
You'll find, as the years go by, that the Quad's brown stone is a
perfect surface for emotional overlays. And, most precious of all,
you'll find that the Quad seems to grow up with you, never do you
grow away from it.
That's why Stanfordites returning to the Farm never smile in
dulgently on the dear old Quad. It's still serious stuff to them, the
epitome of a great adventure that may be bought—but is never
paid for.
It will become part of you, and more importantly, you will be
come a part of it—there's no attitude proof against this strange merg
ing of identities.
