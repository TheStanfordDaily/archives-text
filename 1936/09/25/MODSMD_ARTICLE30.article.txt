# Theater To Be Ready In April, Says Roth
## Full Outline of Structure Visible In 30 Days 
### 
With work temporarily at a stand
i still because of cement pouring for
: the floor of the balcony, Stanford's
! new Memorial Theater rises over HO
feet, gilders and wooden framework I
completed.
The entire outline of the structure I
: will be visible by the end of Oc
| tober, predicts Comptroller Almon
J E. Roth. By then concrete will have
l been poured for the walls, forms 1
! will have been removed, and the
! final touches will be begun.
Finished in April
End of construction is foreseen j
for April. Spring quarter will see
dramatic production in a setting i
more complete and luxurious than
any before approached on the Farm.
Work on the 60-foot street run- ;
ning in front of the theater is well j
under way. Water mains already
have been laid, and paving will be j
completed before registration. The I
old parking lot directly across from \
the Art Gallery will be covered by |
men landscaping. Diagonal park
ing along the new street will ac
commodate more than the the same '
number of cars.
Concrete Work Slow
How long does it take for con- 1
crete to cure? "Thirty-two years," j
replies Comptroller Roth. But he
means thoroughly hard. Forms can
be removed on the campus struc
ture after 28 days of setting.
Wooden framework, on which |
concrete will be poured for the bal- I
' cony floor, will all have to be re- !
| moved from below the finished :
| flooring. It is removable in sec
| tions from the steel girders and
j hardened concrete.
Use Scales
i To get the proper curve for the
balcony levels, a steel cable was
strung from above the stage to the
back of the balcony. Scales were at-
I tached to the rear end. A definite
| tension was necessary, as the cable 1
was used to describe a perfect cir
cle for each row of seats, and the
amount of weight upon the wire was
varied, measured exactly by the at
tached scales, for each consecutive
row.
Two distributing aisles, one at
the back of the balcony and one in
the middle, will make for easy ap
proach to seats. Wide spaces be
tween rows guarantee ample leg
j room.
Lobby Impressive
The main lobby's vaulted ceiling
is now barely discernible through
the wooden framework and steel
girders. Two wide staircases at each
end of the huge lobby ascend to the
balcony.
