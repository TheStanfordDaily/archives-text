# Willis Leaves To Study Java Geology
## Emeritus Professor Plans Three-Week Hike Into Tropical Wilderness 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emer
itus of geology at Stanford, left lust
week on a Dutch freighter to study
the geologic conditions of Java. lie
; was accompanied by Mrs. Willis, and
I in Batvia, Java, will meet Dr. and
Mrs. Arthur T. Day.
Dr. Day is director of the geo
physical laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington and is a
■ noted authority on volcanoes. To- ,
gether the geologists intend to ex- I
plore the back country of the is- i
lands.
There are not many primitive j
lands in the world which the 79- I
year-old Stanford geologist has not I
visited. Since 1929 he has been mak- I
1 ing a technical survey of the rift
valleys of eastern Africa, where he
made geological investigations thi'te
I years ago. The l'esults of this trip
were printed by the Carnegie In*
I stitution this summer.
During three weeks of his Java
j nese sojourn, Dr. Willis will pro
! ceed into the primitive and volcanic
j country on foot with Dr. Day and a
| company of natives. Ho has learned
| the Malay tongue for this part of
! the trip, and was already familiar
with Dutch, which is the principal
i commercial language of the islands,
j The scientists expect heavy rains on
their trip.
Dr. Willis declared that he had no
further plans than his trip to Java, i
I but added that he was inquisitive
i about the geological formations in
I other regions such as the Phi lip—
' pines, the East Indies, and India.
