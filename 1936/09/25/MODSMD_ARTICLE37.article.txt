New Wing for Union
Sigma Nu with $8000 to .spend
let the outside of their house re
main intact, and only redecorated j
the interior. To take care of feed
ing the ever-increasing number of
women, the University is spending
$6000 to build on a new dining

room for Union women. The wing,
however, will not be finished in
entirety by the time school starts. I
In order to put on a 1 new front ;
for returning students, the Stan- j
| ford Bookstore has spent close to I
j $1000 for new showcases and a |
I renovated sidewalk. A fully equip
| ped dark room was installed and
the D-iily shack enlarged as much
as $1200 would allow.
Building on faculty homes on the
campus took nearly $32,000 of the
summer's expenditures. Ten thou
sand dollars each was spent for new
c istruction on homes of Carl
Bland, associate professor of his
tory, and Alfred Coester, profes
sor of Spanish-American literature.
New construction costing $9000
finished off a home for Paul Kirk
patrick, associate professor of phys
ics. An addition to the house of
W. M. Danner cost $2600.
University Loans Money
Because of an old University rul
ing, fraternity and sorority houses
may enly be remodeled, and there
fore cannot be completely torn
down. Under this arrangement, the
University will loan each builder a
sum up to $15,000 upon approval of,
the construction plans by Univer
sity officials.
