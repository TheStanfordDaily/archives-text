WILL the fourth time be the charm for
the genial Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill?
The genial coach who is a bit cynical about
the conventional cliches of the coaching pro- j
fession, such as secret practice sessions and
triple-spinner hocus pocus, won't promise
anything, but on the other hand he doesn't i
deny that the Rally Committee stands a
chance to get another free trip to Pasadena.
Little nifties of the old Thornhill school,
however, are such old-fashioned ideas as
the way to get a touchdown is to get ahold
of the ball and to advance it down the field.
But will there be another Grayson to make
the traditionally strong Thornhill line game
effective by those rapier thrusts off tackle
and the ends, can this new inexperienced
team develop the mobility and the co-ordi
nation that the vowing Sophs showed in such
instances as the first quarter of last year's
Big Game? If we knew, we'd tell you.
