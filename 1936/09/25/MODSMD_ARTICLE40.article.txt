# $325,000 Education Building Approved
## 
### 
Twenty years ago Dr. Elwood P.
Cubberley, then newly appointed
dean of the Stanford School of Ed
ucation, and his wife, Helen Cub
i berley, decided that they would de
vote their lives toward the making
i possible of a building worthy of the
1 school that Dr. Cubberley was then
| busily engaged in building up.
Now, this summer, the announce-
I ment has been made by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, that the deci
sion of 20 years has been carried out
j and tentative plans for a new $525,-
000 Education Building have been
approved by the Board of Trustees.
The new building, gift of Dr.
Cubberley and his wife, will rise on
j the south side of the Library, fac
ing the Engineering Building. Con-
J struction probably will begin the
; early part of January;-
The story of the new building is a
| story of a man's steadfast devotion
to his work. Dr. Cubberley worked
for 35 years here and was made
! emeritus in 1932. The eminent po
sition of the School of Education
at this lime is to a great extent due
to his efforts.
Books Published
I He is author of 17 published vol
umes of educational textbooks, six
major school survey volumes, and
is editor of the Riverside Textbooks
in Education, of which there are
| over 100 volumes.
Profits from these works were
! carefully invested by Dr. Cubber
t ley. When he made his gift to the
University in 1933 they were in the
form of $400,000 worth of stocks and
bonds. Since that time, their mar
ket value has risen to $500,000.
Three Story Height
The new building will be three
! stories high and will carry out the
| original architectural Quad motif
as modified by Bakewell and Brown,
; University architects, in later
buildings. Front of the building
j will be stone, the rest will be in a
plastered concrete similar to the
surface of the Women's Gym.

The front of the structure will be
brought out on Lasuen Street to
parallel the Art Gallery, giving the
Library a recessed position in the i
new Quad group and leaving the
parking place on the south of the
Library substantially unchanged.
In the building will be 91 rooms I
with a seating capacity of 1187, in- |
creasing the University's class- | •
room capacity by 15 per cent, j
There will be 33 offices, four library j
rooms to accommodate 210 students, j
The School of Education Library '
will contain stacks with a capacity |
of 125,000 volumes.
Plans for the building were |
largely worked out on Dr. Cubber
ley's own drawing board, from the
basic room plans down to minute
details of furnishing.

Plans for the building were |
largely worked out on Dr. Cubber
ley's own drawing board, from the
basic room plans down to minute
details of furnishing.
Twenty years ago Dr. Elwood P.
Cubberley, then newly appointed
dean of the Stanford School of Ed
ucation, and his wife, Helen Cub
i berley, decided that they would de
vote their lives toward the making
i possible of a building worthy of the
1 school that Dr. Cubberley was then
| busily engaged in building up.
Now, this summer, the announce-
I ment has been made by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, that the deci
sion of 20 years has been carried out
j and tentative plans for a new $525,-
000 Education Building have been
approved by the Board of Trustees.
The new building, gift of Dr.
Cubberley and his wife, will rise on
j the south side of the Library, fac
ing the Engineering Building. Con-
J struction probably will begin the
; early part of January;-
The story of the new building is a
| story of a man's steadfast devotion
to his work. Dr. Cubberley worked
for 35 years here and was made
! emeritus in 1932. The eminent po
sition of the School of Education
at this lime is to a great extent due
to his efforts.
Books Published
I He is author of 17 published vol
umes of educational textbooks, six
major school survey volumes, and
is editor of the Riverside Textbooks
in Education, of which there are
| over 100 volumes.
Profits from these works were
! carefully invested by Dr. Cubber
t ley. When he made his gift to the
University in 1933 they were in the
form of $400,000 worth of stocks and
bonds. Since that time, their mar
ket value has risen to $500,000.
Three Story Height
The new building will be three
! stories high and will carry out the
| original architectural Quad motif
as modified by Bakewell and Brown,
; University architects, in later
buildings. Front of the building
j will be stone, the rest will be in a
plastered concrete similar to the
surface of the Women's Gym.

The front of the structure will be
brought out on Lasuen Street to
parallel the Art Gallery, giving the
Library a recessed position in the i
new Quad group and leaving the
parking place on the south of the
Library substantially unchanged.
In the building will be 91 rooms I
with a seating capacity of 1187, in- |
creasing the University's class- | •
room capacity by 15 per cent, j
There will be 33 offices, four library j
rooms to accommodate 210 students, j
The School of Education Library '
will contain stacks with a capacity |
of 125,000 volumes.
