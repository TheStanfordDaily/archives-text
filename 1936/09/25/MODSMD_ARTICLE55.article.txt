Clipped by Phil Bernheim
HELLO! Here we are again, after
an interregnum (go on, look it up)
of eight months, bringing you the
news, gossip, and not-too-scandal
ous scandal of that sphere of ac
tivity known as "show business,"
with a few semi-occasional devia
tions into other fields.
SPOT NEWS is non - existent
when one has to write several days
before publication and with the
knowledge that the column will not
be read until several days after it
is printed. So for new students and
others, we present a resume of
amusement spots in Paly and Frisco,
and a list of orchestras and night
spots.
MOVIES: Palo Alto offers the
Stanford Theater, with first-run
major productions, and the Varsity
with second-run, both with double
bills and both on the main drag,
University avenue. About a mile and
a half to the east is the May field
Theater, accessible on the Mayfield
(campus) bus, and a similar dis
tance north on highway 101 is the
Menlo. accessible only by automo
bile or hoof. San Francisco, of
course, is filled with fine cinema
palaces (whoops!).
LEGITIMATE: One or more le
gitimate houses in San Francisco
are usually lit at all times, present
ing good Coast casts in Eastern hits.
The Palo Alto Community Play
house presents several amateur
productions varying in quality from
fair to terrible every month.
HI RLESQUE: San Francisco has
a number of houses, of which the
Capitol and Liberty are best known.
The latteV has the reputation.
U. of C. SPOTS—Griff Williams
is currently at the Mark (Hotel
Mark Hopkins), having just re
turned from a successful engage
ment in Chicago. Jan Garbcr, mod
estlv billing himself as the "Idol
of the Airlanes," is currently at the
Frantic (St. Francis) but will be
replaced by E<l Fitzpatriek, Jr., for
merly of the Deauville Club, on the
29th. Sterling Young is still at the
Palace, but will be replaced by
Merle Carlson, formerly of Reno
and Southern California, by regis
tration day. Rumor hath it, by the
way, that the Palace will soon re
model its famed Rose Room Bowl.
Larry Kent, who used to be in Ho
nolulu, is at the Drake's (Hotel
Sir Francis Drake's) newly opened
Persian Room. Tom Brown and
Ran Wilde remain at the Bal Taba
rin and Deauville, respectively,
with no immediate changes sched
uled.
PERSONAL OPINION: Griff Wil
liams has the most danceable band
in the City, but not much to listen
to. Sprightly, but not swing. Ed
Fit/patrick has an indescribable
sweet sophisticated sax tone to his
troupe, but not saccharine as is
Garber. Sprightly, but not swing.
Our personal favorite of all Frisco
bands. Ran Wilde is sprightly and
violinny—good, but I don't like the
crowd at the Deauville.
