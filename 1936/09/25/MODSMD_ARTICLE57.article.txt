# Sweaters, Skirts Are Standard Campus Wear

### 
When Stanford women coir.e back
to the Farm they leave the greater
part of their Paris creations safely
tucked in closets and drawers at
home, for sweaters, skirts, and
simple sports dresses are the prin

A plain sill; street dress or two

as rushing teas and the more in
formal campus dunces. Then that
glamorous formal will come into its
own for the Big Date in the city.

Excess jewelry constitutes an

j of adornment, especially earrings,
| should not be worn with Quad
clothes.

also to extremes in make-up. If
bristling mascara, neurotic eye
shadow, and slaughterhouse nail
polish must be used, at least be
subtle about it. Even your best
date won't appreciate it it you ap
pear in classrooms with your nails
looking as if you had cleaned rab
bits all your life.
