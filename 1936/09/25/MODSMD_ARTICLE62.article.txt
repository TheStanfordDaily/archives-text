On Encina's concrete front stops a few days
less than three years ago there sat a tableau of
odd, angular forms, misshapen like football
men. They were ogling down like harpies,
griffons, and gargoyles on all that passed be
low, these football players were.
They were sitting on the concrete steps, get
ting a Hell of a kick out of watching their fel
low classmates arrive: Mama's boys, with chauf
feurs in livery, mama's toys without chauffeurs,
but v/ith mamas.
I took my suitcase out of my rumble seat.
It seemed heavy. As I carried it up the steps
it would bang against my knee, or catch on a
step and throw me slightly off balance. I
didn't dare to look to see if they were watch
ing, but continued up to the big front door with
its tremendous knob, fiddled with it for a while
to unlatch it (I discovered later that the latch
string at Encina is always out—of order) finally
bruised myself over the threshold., turned
around and discovered that no one had even
noticed me.
It was an awful letdown.
That herd on the front steps was my in
troduction to the first random sample of the
Stanford herd, the great commoner, the great
buffer and burnisher. It was a letdown to
find out that the great herd does not notice
you unless you make yourself conspicuous
by your presence.
There wasn't anybody there to say, "Now,
my little man, welcome to Stanford, would you
need some help or advice in getting settled and
acguainted here?" There wasn't then, there
hasn't been anyone since, there won't be any
in the future, though the present Pre-Reg period
is a shot in this direction (even if in the dark).
The Stanford herd is an introduction to the
herd any individual will meet in later life.
It is only old sentimentalists and milk-sops
such as editors of Dailies, who think that the
Stanford herd should be different.
Besides, how was I to know, puny little
freshman with a suitcase, that I would some
day consummate my ambition to be one of the
herd, one of the socialized individuals, who
from the sanctity of applegreen edit offices rain
down storms of publicity upon the exhibition
ists, but will neglect to seek out the guiet cub
icles, where the unnoticed boys with suitcases
a r e laboriously bringing to fruition, the fanciful
dreams of their introverted genius?

Those who go to college and never get out
are called professors.—George Givot.
