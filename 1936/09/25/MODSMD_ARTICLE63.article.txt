# Quiet Is Requested

Why mention this sort of stuff at all? Why
not keep it quiet? Why destroy the idealistic
conceptions a freshman has before he gets
here? V/hy not write an editorial such as Mel
linkoff (minor prophet who thundered down
oracles from the Daily pulpit three years ago)
pleading with the students to study? Why not
cultivate the former editor's ability to be in
spirational in a cynical way?
I'm not so sure that even if I wrote an
editorial urging every freshman to study, and
that even if every freshman road the editorial
and every freshman sludied, it would be
good for them or the school.
It would be downright harmful for over 50

' per cent of the freshmen to learn to think, be
cause 50 per cent of the freshmen are not sent
here to learn how to think. They are sent here
to be buffered and burnished by the herd, to
learn how to become happy, contented, well
adjusted extroverts, who can sell automobiles
I and marry beautiful husbands or wives. Study
ing for them is an outside activity, a part to
play in the comic opera conception of college.
The 50 per cent (including Indians, not
taxed) who are sent here to learn to think get
discouraged, settle down to a morose existence
of being professors or newspapermen, without
ever having experienced the sensation.
