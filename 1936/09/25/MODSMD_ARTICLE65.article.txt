r rHE first student leader who will be on hand to
welcome you Encina freshmen to Stanford will
be the laundry agent. He will be working his way
through school, his aged mother will be dying, he will
be practically destitute of all worldly possessions, but
you're darned betcha, he ran all the way back to
school from Yountville to be hei'e in time to welcome
you.
The second student leader who will be on hand
is the radio salesman. He will be working his way
through school, his aged mother will be dying, he will
be destitute of all worldly possessions, but he walked
all the way back to school from Simpson's Corners,
and that's the reason he wasn't here first to greet you.
The laundry or the radio salesman probably will
sign you up with a verbal contract not to use the
products of any of his twenty competitors in the
hall. You will learn how the other laundries rip off
buttons, browbeat their employees, beat their wives,
beat their husbands, and don't pour it to their clothes.
You will not learn that your newly found laundry
agent will let your laundry rot. in his laundry can
before he delivers it, particularly when thsre's a tux
shirt in there and you're buzzing out to the Roble
formal that night.
According to a decision handed down and out by
Men's and Women's Council, this verbal contract
made with your laundry agent to furnish him with
dirty laundry throughout the year is legally binding
until revoked by the appearance of a bigger and
heavier laundry agent.
You frosh may wonder why Our Hasher knows all
about this laundry racket. Well, Our Hasher was one
of these laundry agents when he was a frosh, and like
all laundry agents, sneaked up to the post office by
night and mailed his laundry home for his ma to do
on Mondays.
'I'HE first student leader you Roble freshmen will
meet probably will he a student leader. This is a
universal type, of which every girl must be wary. He
got his title by leading students on.
Next student you must, be wary of it Our Hasher,
who at one time during fall quarter always mentions
the fact that Roble gals arc lousy this year for the first
time. To which it is the duty of Roble penwomen to
respond with letters in campus opinion protesting
what a heel Our Hasher is. WATCH FOR IT, also
selected short subjects.
