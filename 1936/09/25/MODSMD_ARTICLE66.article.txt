"Go slow and see our campus; go fast and see the
Men's and Women's Councils." That is the spirit of
(ho Farm's traffic regulations. Speedsters and other
violators are fined by the Councils with half the fine
suspended and carrying over to the next offense. Thcv
also have the power to suspend driving privileges of
serious offenders.
Besides (ho state traffic rules, which are all en
forced on the campus, rigid speed and parking laws
are laid down by the administration and enforced by
Officer "Gordy" Davis in his black and white Ford.
Twenty miles an hour is the speed limit on the
campus roads, and 15 miles al all intersections. New
students are warned to hj especially careful around
(he post office, Encina, the Row, in front of the Chem
istry Building, the Library, and the 8.A.C., because
of the traffic jams usually to be found around these
points. Palm Drive and all roads leading into the
campus h;.ve a sped limit of thirty miles an hour.
"Gordy" Davis stresses the necessity of riding inside
the cars and not on running boards. This includes
football rallies, the traditional time to overload cars.
Only three passengers are allowed in the front seat.
All "no parking" areas are plainly marked by signs
or paint. New students are warned particularly against
parking in front of flu- Post Office and on the path in
the Library parking lot.
