# BULL SESSION
## DEAD FROM THE NECK UP—OFFICIALLY 
### 
Freshmen can take this as a
warning. Upperclassmen hardly
need take it as a criticism, for Bull
Sessioner is not yet a traitor to his j
cflass.
We would merely remind all frosh ;
that they are dumb. They are par- i
ticularly dumb when they go out
for one of Stanfol'd's activities. That
last truism cuts two ways: one cut
for the cynic who believes only j
dumbbells go out for activities; the i
other cut for the Farm Sociologist j
who sees the tryoutee freshman's
stupidity as the necessary comple
ment of trying-out, not the cause.
We'll take the second cut, and
put this interpretation on it: that
the Farm's activity-fuehrers sim
ply demand consummate stupidity ;
on the part of all tryoutees, the abil
ity to take orders from someone who |
knows little or nothing about the j
work to be done.
Hi * *
Good little freshmen will hear'
their upperclass bosses belch some- !
thing like this: "We don't care how
good you were back at Podunk ;
High, you've got to establish your
own reputation here. We're not a
bit interested, boys, that three or
four among you did professional j
work last summer in this particular j
field. We don't care whether you
earned a salary doing it or not. I
You've got to go through all the
deadly routine we can organize so
you'll realize what a bunch of brain- j
storms your Stanford leaders really ,
are."
The good little freshmen (even the
ones who happen to know their
business) must take gouts and
gouts of such drool from some poor

sap, providentially a senior, who is
in charge of "training the tryout
ees."
* * *
Behind closed doors, activity lead
i ers will tell you that much good
I material is lost because of the way
the freshman tyro is treated. Scrim
maging from one undignified and
stupid chore to the other, verbally
| grilled by someone who obviously
1 doesn't know what he's talking
| about, the frosh who really has in
telligence, trained or untrained,
simply gets disgusted and forgets
all about it.
As a result the activity loses. But
that doesn't matter. For the egos of
Stanford's activity-leaders are in
| fiated. And ego-inflation is an im
-1 portant thing on this campus—an
| autumnal tonic, no less. Naturally,
j the procedure of talking down tal
j ent has been neatly rationalized.
; The theory is "Give 'em hell. If
! a tryoutee stands for a month of
! insults, he's a good man."
* * *
The truth is, after a month of
polite sadism and calculated waste
of time, it isn't the good man who's
still hanging around. It's the thick
| skulled dope who still doesn't real
j ize how dumb he is, or how much
j dumber his leader.
And so many of Stanford's ac
tivities are getting poor material,
with the good material simply giv
ing up and going to the library—
I fine for them, amortizing for the
library, and a comfort to the armor
plated intellects who like to pull
the wings ofT aspiration, in lieu of
flies.

Freshmen can take this as a
warning. Upperclassmen hardly
need take it as a criticism, for Bull
Sessioner is not yet a traitor to his j
cflass.
We would merely remind all frosh ;
that they are dumb. They are par- i
ticularly dumb when they go out
for one of Stanfol'd's activities. That
last truism cuts two ways: one cut
for the cynic who believes only j
dumbbells go out for activities; the i
other cut for the Farm Sociologist j
who sees the tryoutee freshman's
stupidity as the necessary comple
ment of trying-out, not the cause.
We'll take the second cut, and
put this interpretation on it: that
the Farm's activity-fuehrers sim
ply demand consummate stupidity ;
on the part of all tryoutees, the abil
ity to take orders from someone who |
knows little or nothing about the j
work to be done.
