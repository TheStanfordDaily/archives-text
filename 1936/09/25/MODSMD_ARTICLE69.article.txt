After well over seven lean years j
knowing locals are beginning to
speak of The Drama with new fer
vor. Reason? Stanford has a new
theater. Well, of course it is not
entirely completed, but the last
brick should be set in soon. When
it is Stanford is promised liner dra- j
matic productions, and more of j
them—one major performance each j
month, a workshop play each week, j
Sam French at Stanford
From Sioux Falls, Portland, or
Podunk, the entering freshman will
probably find the state of the drama
at Stanford comfortably similar to !
the state of the drama at Sioux
Falls, Portland, or Podunk High.
Chief difference seems to be that
Samuel French catalogues inspire i
the selection of high school plays j
while Stanford productions arc
picked by Dramatic Council, with
or without the aid of Mr. French's
manual.
The quarter's major productions j
may range all the way from a Ber- \
nard Shaw piece to a not-so-good
pioneer .nelodrama; comedy is on 1
the whole favored. Most popular ;
production is invariably the Big :
Game Gaieties, student - written |
rally musicale.
Well might the freshman be be- j
wildered by the variety of dra- |
matic organizations at Stanford, j
Sword and Sandals, men's honorary j
dramatic society, sponsors play I
readings throughout the quarter |
for which freshmen, unable to take
part in campus productions, are
encouraged to try out. Women's
honorary dramatic society is Mas
quers.
Ah, Yes—Rain's Head
Ram's Head, men's society, spon- j
sors the annual Big Game Gaieties,
while Barnstormers, recently or
ganized for campus veterans, has as j
its charge the spring musicale.
The cinema is not to be forgotten. '
Time was when Stan- '
ford stamped, whistled, cat-called |
in Palo Alto moviedromes. Now j
police are vigilant; only Lowell j
Thomas may be hissed with im
punity.

wildered by the variety of dra- |
matic organizations at Stanford, j
Sword and Sandals, men's honorary j
dramatic society, sponsors play I
readings throughout the quarter |
for which freshmen, unable to take
part in campus productions, are
encouraged to try out. Women's
honorary dramatic society is Mas
quers.
Ah, Yes—Rain's Head
Ram's Head, men's society, spon- j
sors the annual Big Game Gaieties,
while Barnstormers, recently or
ganized for campus veterans, has as j
its charge the spring musicale.
The cinema is not to be forgotten. '
Time was when Stan- '
ford stamped, whistled, cat-called |
in Palo Alto moviedromes. Now j
police are vigilant; only Lowell j
Thomas may be hissed with im
punity.
