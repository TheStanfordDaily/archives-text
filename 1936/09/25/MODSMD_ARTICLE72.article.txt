# Shipkey Sees Promise In Frosh Squad
## Sixty-five New Gridders Compete for Berths On First-Year Team 
### 
One of the brightest outlooks in !
years is on the menu for frosh '
coach Harry Shipkey these days as |
he toils with a still uncut squad of ,
65 strapping gridders, plentifully
sprinkled with pedigreed and new- I
coming luminaries.
Harry Shipkey is new to his job, !
having come here this year from
Salinas High to replace Rabbit '
Bradshaw, who has gone to Fresno
State.
Worked Under Warner
Shipkey's style is a no - shift
double wingback set, dating back i
to (he days when he was a stellar j
tackle and end here under Kerr
and Warner in '22, '23, and '24.
Key man of this plan of course !
is the fullback, where the class of I
40 is at present two deep. Chet \
Patton, a 187-pounder from Bob
by Grayson's school in Portland, i
and Howard Hickingbotham, 191, |
from Piedmont, both show great j
ball-carrying possibilities and good !
football sense. Hickingbotham is
the faster of the two, but Patton is 1
loose-kneed, swivel-hipped lad that
really pushes 'em down.
Gene Coldiron, who brings a |
long record with him out of Ho- i
quiam, Washington, seems to be the '
leading blocker on the team, and I
already has the quarterback posi- j
tion safe in his vest pocket.
Kansas Halfbacks
Buddy Wilson and Jack Carpen- '
ter, all-staters from Kansas, lead I
the half-back contingents.
The frosh line also seems well !
fixed even at this early date. At i
center is Hugh Radke, 177-pounder, |
named as Central Coast County all- j
star last year, and closely followed j
by Frank Carter, who comes here 1
from Kiski, Pennsylvania. You I
know Kiski.
Guards are Ernie Damarus of San j
Diego, 192, Norman Juney of Wil- j
lows, and Bob Young of Eureka.
All strong high school linesmen,
these guys are being hounded by '
about eight others who want to play j
guard for Shipkey. Young seems
to star at place kicking; wearing
Corbus old 19 in scrimmage Satur
day last he kicked himself 2 for 3.
A Few Tackles
Leading tackle is 209 pounds of
Stan Anderson, another all-Stater
from Portland. Anderson looks to
be the next edition of the 60-min
ute, never-worry boys. Other lead
ing parts here go to Stockton Shaw
of San Francisco, Harry Price of
Salinas, Jack Bates of Piedmont,
Sid Lewis, and Pat Nowell.
End positions still cause some
concern, with Reed of Sacramento,
Greer, and Gallarneau ahead of the
field.
Assisting Shipkey are Coaches
Wes Muller and Larry Rouble, line,
and Frank Alustiza, backfield.
Daily workouts continue through
out the season; the first frosh, game
will be with Modesto J.C., a pre
liminary to the varsity-Santa Clara
encounter on September 26. Will ya
be there?

Kansas Halfbacks
Buddy Wilson and Jack Carpen- '
ter, all-staters from Kansas, lead I
the half-back contingents.
The frosh line also seems well !
fixed even at this early date. At i
center is Hugh Radke, 177-pounder, |
named as Central Coast County all- j
star last year, and closely followed j
by Frank Carter, who comes here 1
from Kiski, Pennsylvania. You I
know Kiski.
Guards are Ernie Damarus of San j
Diego, 192, Norman Juney of Wil- j
lows, and Bob Young of Eureka.
All strong high school linesmen,
these guys are being hounded by '
about eight others who want to play j
guard for Shipkey. Young seems
to star at place kicking; wearing
Corbus old 19 in scrimmage Satur
day last he kicked himself 2 for 3.
A Few Tackles
Leading tackle is 209 pounds of
Stan Anderson, another all-Stater
from Portland. Anderson looks to
be the next edition of the 60-min
ute, never-worry boys. Other lead
ing parts here go to Stockton Shaw
of San Francisco, Harry Price of
Salinas, Jack Bates of Piedmont,
Sid Lewis, and Pat Nowell.
End positions still cause some
concern, with Reed of Sacramento,
Greer, and Gallarneau ahead of the
field.
Assisting Shipkey are Coaches
Wes Muller and Larry Rouble, line,
and Frank Alustiza, backfield.
Daily workouts continue through
out the season; the first frosh, game
will be with Modesto J.C., a pre
liminary to the varsity-Santa Clara
encounter on September 26. Will ya
be there?
Complete list of frosh candidates:
Almy, Anderson, Burbeck, Bardin,
Bates, Bennett, Berlinger, Black,
Blt-ekc r, Bolt, Bo vet, Bowers,
Bromley, Carter, Coldiron, Collom,
Crehan, Curtis, Daley, Damarus,

One of the brightest outlooks in !
years is on the menu for frosh '
coach Harry Shipkey these days as |
he toils with a still uncut squad of ,
65 strapping gridders, plentifully
sprinkled with pedigreed and new- I
coming luminaries.
Harry Shipkey is new to his job, !
having come here this year from
Salinas High to replace Rabbit '
Bradshaw, who has gone to Fresno
State.
Worked Under Warner
Shipkey's style is a no - shift
double wingback set, dating back i
to (he days when he was a stellar j
tackle and end here under Kerr
and Warner in '22, '23, and '24.
Key man of this plan of course !
is the fullback, where the class of I
40 is at present two deep. Chet \
Patton, a 187-pounder from Bob
by Grayson's school in Portland, i
and Howard Hickingbotham, 191, |
from Piedmont, both show great j
ball-carrying possibilities and good !
football sense. Hickingbotham is
the faster of the two, but Patton is 1
loose-kneed, swivel-hipped lad that
really pushes 'em down.
Gene Coldiron, who brings a |
long record with him out of Ho- i
quiam, Washington, seems to be the '
leading blocker on the team, and I
already has the quarterback posi- j
tion safe in his vest pocket.

One of the brightest outlooks in !
years is on the menu for frosh '
coach Harry Shipkey these days as |
he toils with a still uncut squad of ,
65 strapping gridders, plentifully
sprinkled with pedigreed and new- I
coming luminaries.
Harry Shipkey is new to his job, !
having come here this year from
Salinas High to replace Rabbit '
Bradshaw, who has gone to Fresno
State.
Worked Under Warner
Shipkey's style is a no - shift
double wingback set, dating back i
to (he days when he was a stellar j
tackle and end here under Kerr
and Warner in '22, '23, and '24.
Key man of this plan of course !
is the fullback, where the class of I
40 is at present two deep. Chet \
Patton, a 187-pounder from Bob
by Grayson's school in Portland, i
and Howard Hickingbotham, 191, |
from Piedmont, both show great j
ball-carrying possibilities and good !
football sense. Hickingbotham is
the faster of the two, but Patton is 1
loose-kneed, swivel-hipped lad that
really pushes 'em down.
Gene Coldiron, who brings a |
long record with him out of Ho- i
quiam, Washington, seems to be the '
leading blocker on the team, and I
already has the quarterback posi- j
tion safe in his vest pocket.
Kansas Halfbacks
Buddy Wilson and Jack Carpen- '
ter, all-staters from Kansas, lead I
the half-back contingents.
The frosh line also seems well !
fixed even at this early date. At i
center is Hugh Radke, 177-pounder, |
named as Central Coast County all- j
star last year, and closely followed j
by Frank Carter, who comes here 1
from Kiski, Pennsylvania. You I
know Kiski.
Guards are Ernie Damarus of San j
Diego, 192, Norman Juney of Wil- j
lows, and Bob Young of Eureka.
All strong high school linesmen,
these guys are being hounded by '
about eight others who want to play j
guard for Shipkey. Young seems
to star at place kicking; wearing
Corbus old 19 in scrimmage Satur
day last he kicked himself 2 for 3.
A Few Tackles
Leading tackle is 209 pounds of
Stan Anderson, another all-Stater
from Portland. Anderson looks to
be the next edition of the 60-min
ute, never-worry boys. Other lead
ing parts here go to Stockton Shaw
of San Francisco, Harry Price of
Salinas, Jack Bates of Piedmont,
Sid Lewis, and Pat Nowell.
End positions still cause some
concern, with Reed of Sacramento,
Greer, and Gallarneau ahead of the
field.
Assisting Shipkey are Coaches
Wes Muller and Larry Rouble, line,
and Frank Alustiza, backfield.
Daily workouts continue through
out the season; the first frosh, game
will be with Modesto J.C., a pre
liminary to the varsity-Santa Clara
encounter on September 26. Will ya
be there?
