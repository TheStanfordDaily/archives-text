# Shipkey Sees Promise In Frosh Squad
## Sixty-five New Gridders Compete for Berths On First-Year Team 
### 
One of the brightest outlooks in !
years is on the menu for frosh '
coach Harry Shipkey these days as |
he toils with a still uncut squad of ,
65 strapping gridders, plentifully
sprinkled with pedigreed and new- I
coming luminaries.
Harry Shipkey is new to his job, !
having come here this year from
Salinas High to replace Rabbit '
Bradshaw, who has gone to Fresno
State.
Worked Under Warner
Shipkey's style is a no - shift
double wingback set, dating back i
to (he days when he was a stellar j
tackle and end here under Kerr
and Warner in '22, '23, and '24.
Key man of this plan of course !
is the fullback, where the class of I
40 is at present two deep. Chet \
Patton, a 187-pounder from Bob
by Grayson's school in Portland, i
and Howard Hickingbotham, 191, |
from Piedmont, both show great j
ball-carrying possibilities and good !
football sense. Hickingbotham is
the faster of the two, but Patton is 1
loose-kneed, swivel-hipped lad that
really pushes 'em down.
Gene Coldiron, who brings a |
long record with him out of Ho- i
quiam, Washington, seems to be the '
leading blocker on the team, and I
already has the quarterback posi- j
tion safe in his vest pocket.
Kansas Halfbacks
Buddy Wilson and Jack Carpen- '
ter, all-staters from Kansas, lead I
the half-back contingents.
The frosh line also seems well !
fixed even at this early date. At i
center is Hugh Radke, 177-pounder, |
named as Central Coast County all- j
star last year, and closely followed j
by Frank Carter, who comes here 1
from Kiski, Pennsylvania. You I
know Kiski.
Guards are Ernie Damarus of San j
Diego, 192, Norman Juney of Wil- j
lows, and Bob Young of Eureka.
All strong high school linesmen,
these guys are being hounded by '
about eight others who want to play j
guard for Shipkey. Young seems
to star at place kicking; wearing
Corbus old 19 in scrimmage Satur
day last he kicked himself 2 for 3.
A Few Tackles
Leading tackle is 209 pounds of
Stan Anderson, another all-Stater
from Portland. Anderson looks to
be the next edition of the 60-min
ute, never-worry boys. Other lead
ing parts here go to Stockton Shaw
of San Francisco, Harry Price of
Salinas, Jack Bates of Piedmont,
Sid Lewis, and Pat Nowell.
