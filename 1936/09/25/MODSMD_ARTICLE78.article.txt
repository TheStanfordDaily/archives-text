Bringing out some well-earned j
respect for Stanford football, three i
former Card gridders nearly mo- j
nopolized the .show at an annual I
pro football game witnessed by j
75,000 in Chicago September 2.
Ernie Caddel of the world's
champion Detroit Lions was the
spark plug of the team's ofTen.se,
scoring its only touchdown, while '
the defensive play of Boy Reynolds
and Keith Topping of the college
all-stars was praised by all pres- j
ent. The game ended 7-7.
Caddel played all over Pop War
ner's backfield in '30, '31, and '32; |
Topping and Reynolds were mem
bers of the vowing sophs.
"The Bayshore Highway is the
quickest route to San Francisco,,
but frosh would do well to remem
ber that it will be an exceptional
class if one or more of its numbers ,
aren't killed on the highway's four i
lanes of seeming safety."—Hand
