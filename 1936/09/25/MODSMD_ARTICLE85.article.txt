# Injuries Keep Paulman, Coffis From Opener
## Heath Out for Season; Second String Men Are Hurt During Practice 
### 
Injuries already have stabbed
deep into Tiny Thornhill's football
ranks, perhaps to cause a definite
effect on the team's 1936 season.
Bill Paulman, fullback and punt
er par excellence, received a
cracked ankle in scrimmage that
may keep him out a month, perhaps
for the season, depending on subse
quent examinations.
Ileatli, Stone Hurt
Jimmy Coffis, regular left half,
has a wrenched knee from the
same scrimmage, and may miss the
Santa Clara tussle.
Nellie Heath, reserve center, tore
his knee ligaments so badly in the
first week of practice that he will be
lost for the season.
Grant Stone, second string end,
pulled his shoulder out of socket,
but will probably be back in two
weeks.
Bob Dakan, end; Ed* Gamier,
half; and Jack Huebel, full, all have
received minor leg muscle pulls.
First String Announced
Tiny's first string, as of Monday,
September 21, stood: Jack Clark,
left end; Neil Rasmussen and Carl
Schott, right end; Claude Callaway,
left tackle; Pete Zagar, right tackle;
Bob Matthews, left guard; Leo
Ferko, right guard; Louis Tsoutsou
vas, center. Earl Hoos, quarter
back; Fred Williams, left half; Joe
Vigna, right half; and Jake Brig
ham, fullback.
