# Untried Football Team To Cavort For Farm In '36
## Thornhill Juggles Eager Material To Replace Lost Vowing Sophs 
### Phil Klauber 
For the sake of variety this fall
the great Stanford football follow
ing will he up against something
new and different—for the first time
since Tiny Thornhiil look over tho
football reins, the Big Red Machine
is going to be not a seasoned, well
knit affair, but one of new and un
ified parts, put together more or
less securely.
Because take if or leave it, ever
since the class of '36 began to play
varsity ball, things were kind of
free and easy; Stanford used to win
games as an accepted thing, and
eight or ten regulars would return
each year for three seasons to build
up the finest three-year grid record
the Farm has known.
Tho class of '36 is gone.
But wait. Thinks could be a lot
worse!
"Lead-man Paulman"
Lead-off man in all these surveys
is of rourse the fullback, W. 11.
"Wimp" Paulman, last, year's regu
lar quarterback. Bill was honorable
mention on a lot of all-star teams
last year, but didn't really get inlo
form until Southern Methodic,
when lie seemed the best backfield
man on either team. His punting,
passing, blocking, running, place
kicking—heck, he can do anything
—should give Card fans plenty of
cause for thanks this season.
Jeemy Colfi.s is back, too. Every
body remembers the little safety
man built so close to the ground
and so capable of returning kicks,
catching passes, and slapping the
tackles on that left half's reverse.
Hons in Again
Earl Hoos is playing first string
quarter again, after saving himself
last year. "Goose" Hoos, all 190
pounds of him, is full of rolling
blocks and football instinct. Joe
Vigna, the little 180-pour.der who
played a lot of ball while Bones
Hamilton was convalescing last sea
son, will be over at right half.
A pony backfield, says you?
"Short and sweet," say 3 Liebendoi
fer.
Callaway and Zagar
When discussing the 1936 Stan
ford line, start with the tackles.
Yessir, they're better, even, than
last year. Claude Callaway, always
a 60-minute never-worry man, and
last survivor, with Hoos, of the
"Vowing Sophs," is back for his final
season after an uncertain year's bat
tle with bronchitis. Weighing 205
