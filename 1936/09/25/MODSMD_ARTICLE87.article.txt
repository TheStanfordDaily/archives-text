# Untried Football Team To Cavort For Farm In '36
## Thornhill Juggles Eager Material To Replace Lost Vowing Sophs 
### Phil Klauber 
For the sake of variety this fall
the great Stanford football follow
ing will he up against something
new and different—for the first time
since Tiny Thornhiil look over tho
football reins, the Big Red Machine
is going to be not a seasoned, well
knit affair, but one of new and un
ified parts, put together more or
less securely.
Because take if or leave it, ever
since the class of '36 began to play
varsity ball, things were kind of
free and easy; Stanford used to win
games as an accepted thing, and
eight or ten regulars would return
each year for three seasons to build
up the finest three-year grid record
the Farm has known.
Tho class of '36 is gone.
But wait. Thinks could be a lot
worse!
"Lead-man Paulman"
Lead-off man in all these surveys
is of rourse the fullback, W. 11.
"Wimp" Paulman, last, year's regu
lar quarterback. Bill was honorable
mention on a lot of all-star teams
last year, but didn't really get inlo
form until Southern Methodic,
when lie seemed the best backfield
man on either team. His punting,
passing, blocking, running, place
kicking—heck, he can do anything
—should give Card fans plenty of
cause for thanks this season.
Jeemy Colfi.s is back, too. Every
body remembers the little safety
man built so close to the ground
and so capable of returning kicks,
catching passes, and slapping the
tackles on that left half's reverse.
Hons in Again
Earl Hoos is playing first string
quarter again, after saving himself
last year. "Goose" Hoos, all 190
pounds of him, is full of rolling
blocks and football instinct. Joe
Vigna, the little 180-pour.der who
played a lot of ball while Bones
Hamilton was convalescing last sea
son, will be over at right half.
A pony backfield, says you?
"Short and sweet," say 3 Liebendoi
fer.
Callaway and Zagar
When discussing the 1936 Stan
ford line, start with the tackles.
Yessir, they're better, even, than
last year. Claude Callaway, always
a 60-minute never-worry man, and
last survivor, with Hoos, of the
"Vowing Sophs," is back for his final
season after an uncertain year's bat
tle with bronchitis. Weighing 205
pounds, he looks to this as his best
season.
The other tackle is Pete Zagar,
the 220-pounder who was last year's
high scoring freshman, in spite of
playing in the line, Zagar is a born
footballer, much more spectacular
as a frosh than was All-Americari
Horse Reynolds.
From here on in the positions
seem more or less ill-defined. At
guards, Bob Mathews, 195-pound
letterman, and Leo Ferko, 182-
pound transfer from U.S.F., seem to
lead the field, made more sparse by
decision that Porky Cuneo has
played out his eligibility, and that
Don McMillan has a class that con
flicts with football.
Center Prospects
Center standouts are Louis
"Chooch" Tsoutsouvas, 205-pounder
who has been behind Muller and
Brandin for two yeai's, Dick Sutton,
200-pound bull-necker from last
year's frosh, and Tony Calvelli, 180-
pound transfer from San Mateo
J.C., who the wags say is extremely
tough.
At ends the present leaders are
Carl '"Big" Schott, who won the 1934
Big Game, and Neil Rasmussen, a
195-pound transfer from San Mateo.
Right up in there, though, are this
big lug Chet Olcott, Jack Clark,
who played a lot of ball a year ago,
Grant Stone and Bob Dakan, subs
last year, and Butler, Hege, and
Cummings of the '39 frosh.
But don't get the idea that Thorn
hill has to pick a team from these
above; there is plenty of extra tal
ent out there, and some of it is going
to get regular jobs.
The Extra Talent
Pop Grant—you know Pop Grant,
Bob Mangan, Dick Shannon, By
West, Sam Beckley, and Dick Brig

! ham, all of 'em are corking good
tackles and can get places on the |
traveling squad.
Ralph Quails, sub last year, and !
I Captain Jay Holdridge and Charles
Drace of the '38 frosh are the bul
warks of the thinned-out guard
i ranks.
Hal Saunders, Bill Hucklebridge, i
a Riverside J.C. transfer, Andy j
Stojkovich, and Sam Kellogg com- j
plete the end candidates.
Reserve backfield strength is es- !
pecially talented, with speedy Fred
Williams a big standout. Fred was
a Jesse Owens in his high school
days, has been back of Bobby Gray
son for two years, and has showed
some awfully difficult knees to
tacklers so far this year.
1 Glenn Hamilton you have heard
I about—the 190-pound fullback that !
Thornhill saved last year. Ham is
. a triple threat, if ever you saw one.
Some from the Frosh
Leading plunger of these reserves
is one Jack Brigham, who is going

Brandin for two yeai's, Dick Sutton,
200-pound bull-necker from last
year's frosh, and Tony Calvelli, 180-
pound transfer from San Mateo
J.C., who the wags say is extremely
tough.
At ends the present leaders are
Carl '"Big" Schott, who won the 1934
Big Game, and Neil Rasmussen, a
195-pound transfer from San Mateo.
Right up in there, though, are this
big lug Chet Olcott, Jack Clark,
who played a lot of ball a year ago,
Grant Stone and Bob Dakan, subs
last year, and Butler, Hege, and
Cummings of the '39 frosh.
But don't get the idea that Thorn
hill has to pick a team from these
above; there is plenty of extra tal
ent out there, and some of it is going
to get regular jobs.
The Extra Talent
Pop Grant—you know Pop Grant,
Bob Mangan, Dick Shannon, By
West, Sam Beckley, and Dick Brig

! ham, all of 'em are corking good
tackles and can get places on the |
traveling squad.
Ralph Quails, sub last year, and !
I Captain Jay Holdridge and Charles
Drace of the '38 frosh are the bul
warks of the thinned-out guard
i ranks.
Hal Saunders, Bill Hucklebridge, i
a Riverside J.C. transfer, Andy j
Stojkovich, and Sam Kellogg com- j
plete the end candidates.
Reserve backfield strength is es- !
pecially talented, with speedy Fred
Williams a big standout. Fred was
a Jesse Owens in his high school
days, has been back of Bobby Gray
son for two years, and has showed
some awfully difficult knees to
tacklers so far this year.
1 Glenn Hamilton you have heard
I about—the 190-pound fullback that !
Thornhill saved last year. Ham is
. a triple threat, if ever you saw one.
Some from the Frosh
Leading plunger of these reserves
is one Jack Brigham, who is going
to play a lot of ball this year. Jake
| has been as hard to stop as any of |
them in practice this fall.
Last year's substitutes Doc Luck
| ett and Tom Collins are both back
For the sake of variety this fall
the great Stanford football follow
ing will he up against something
new and different—for the first time
since Tiny Thornhiil look over tho
football reins, the Big Red Machine
is going to be not a seasoned, well
knit affair, but one of new and un
ified parts, put together more or
less securely.
Because take if or leave it, ever
since the class of '36 began to play
varsity ball, things were kind of
free and easy; Stanford used to win
games as an accepted thing, and
eight or ten regulars would return
each year for three seasons to build
up the finest three-year grid record
the Farm has known.
Tho class of '36 is gone.
But wait. Thinks could be a lot
worse!
"Lead-man Paulman"
Lead-off man in all these surveys
is of rourse the fullback, W. 11.
"Wimp" Paulman, last, year's regu
lar quarterback. Bill was honorable
mention on a lot of all-star teams
last year, but didn't really get inlo
form until Southern Methodic,
when lie seemed the best backfield
man on either team. His punting,
passing, blocking, running, place
kicking—heck, he can do anything
—should give Card fans plenty of
cause for thanks this season.
Jeemy Colfi.s is back, too. Every
body remembers the little safety
man built so close to the ground
and so capable of returning kicks,
catching passes, and slapping the
tackles on that left half's reverse.
Hons in Again
Earl Hoos is playing first string
quarter again, after saving himself
last year. "Goose" Hoos, all 190
pounds of him, is full of rolling
blocks and football instinct. Joe
Vigna, the little 180-pour.der who
played a lot of ball while Bones
Hamilton was convalescing last sea
son, will be over at right half.
A pony backfield, says you?
"Short and sweet," say 3 Liebendoi
fer.
Callaway and Zagar
When discussing the 1936 Stan
ford line, start with the tackles.
Yessir, they're better, even, than
last year. Claude Callaway, always
a 60-minute never-worry man, and
last survivor, with Hoos, of the
"Vowing Sophs," is back for his final
season after an uncertain year's bat
tle with bronchitis. Weighing 205
pounds, he looks to this as his best
season.
The other tackle is Pete Zagar,
the 220-pounder who was last year's
high scoring freshman, in spite of
playing in the line, Zagar is a born
footballer, much more spectacular
as a frosh than was All-Americari
Horse Reynolds.
From here on in the positions
seem more or less ill-defined. At
guards, Bob Mathews, 195-pound
letterman, and Leo Ferko, 182-
pound transfer from U.S.F., seem to
lead the field, made more sparse by
decision that Porky Cuneo has
played out his eligibility, and that
Don McMillan has a class that con
flicts with football.
Center Prospects

"Chooch" Tsoutsouvas, 205-pounder

man on either team. His punting,
passing, blocking, running, place
kicking—heck, he can do anything
—should give Card fans plenty of
cause for thanks this season.
Jeemy Colfi.s is back, too. Every
body remembers the little safety
man built so close to the ground
and so capable of returning kicks,
catching passes, and slapping the
tackles on that left half's reverse.
Hons in Again
Earl Hoos is playing first string
quarter again, after saving himself
last year. "Goose" Hoos, all 190
pounds of him, is full of rolling
blocks and football instinct. Joe
Vigna, the little 180-pour.der who
played a lot of ball while Bones
Hamilton was convalescing last sea
son, will be over at right half.
A pony backfield, says you?
"Short and sweet," say 3 Liebendoi
fer.
Callaway and Zagar
When discussing the 1936 Stan
ford line, start with the tackles.
Yessir, they're better, even, than
last year. Claude Callaway, always
a 60-minute never-worry man, and
last survivor, with Hoos, of the
"Vowing Sophs," is back for his final
season after an uncertain year's bat
tle with bronchitis. Weighing 205
pounds, he looks to this as his best
season.
The other tackle is Pete Zagar,
the 220-pounder who was last year's
high scoring freshman, in spite of
playing in the line, Zagar is a born
footballer, much more spectacular
as a frosh than was All-Americari
Horse Reynolds.
From here on in the positions
seem more or less ill-defined. At
guards, Bob Mathews, 195-pound
letterman, and Leo Ferko, 182-
pound transfer from U.S.F., seem to
lead the field, made more sparse by
decision that Porky Cuneo has
played out his eligibility, and that
Don McMillan has a class that con
flicts with football.
Center Prospects
Center standouts are Louis
"Chooch" Tsoutsouvas, 205-pounder
who has been behind Muller and
Brandin for two yeai's, Dick Sutton,
200-pound bull-necker from last
year's frosh, and Tony Calvelli, 180-
pound transfer from San Mateo
J.C., who the wags say is extremely
tough.
At ends the present leaders are
Carl '"Big" Schott, who won the 1934
Big Game, and Neil Rasmussen, a
195-pound transfer from San Mateo.
Right up in there, though, are this
big lug Chet Olcott, Jack Clark,
who played a lot of ball a year ago,
Grant Stone and Bob Dakan, subs
last year, and Butler, Hege, and
Cummings of the '39 frosh.
But don't get the idea that Thorn
hill has to pick a team from these
above; there is plenty of extra tal
ent out there, and some of it is going
to get regular jobs.
The Extra Talent
Pop Grant—you know Pop Grant,
Bob Mangan, Dick Shannon, By
West, Sam Beckley, and Dick Brig

! ham, all of 'em are corking good
tackles and can get places on the |
traveling squad.
Ralph Quails, sub last year, and !
I Captain Jay Holdridge and Charles
Drace of the '38 frosh are the bul
warks of the thinned-out guard
i ranks.
Hal Saunders, Bill Hucklebridge, i
a Riverside J.C. transfer, Andy j
Stojkovich, and Sam Kellogg com- j
plete the end candidates.
Reserve backfield strength is es- !
pecially talented, with speedy Fred
Williams a big standout. Fred was
a Jesse Owens in his high school
days, has been back of Bobby Gray
son for two years, and has showed
some awfully difficult knees to
tacklers so far this year.
1 Glenn Hamilton you have heard
I about—the 190-pound fullback that !
Thornhill saved last year. Ham is
. a triple threat, if ever you saw one.
Some from the Frosh
Leading plunger of these reserves
is one Jack Brigham, who is going
to play a lot of ball this year. Jake
| has been as hard to stop as any of |
them in practice this fall.
Last year's substitutes Doc Luck
| ett and Tom Collins are both back
For the sake of variety this fall
the great Stanford football follow
ing will he up against something
new and different—for the first time
since Tiny Thornhiil look over tho
football reins, the Big Red Machine
is going to be not a seasoned, well
knit affair, but one of new and un
ified parts, put together more or
less securely.
Because take if or leave it, ever
since the class of '36 began to play
varsity ball, things were kind of
free and easy; Stanford used to win
games as an accepted thing, and
eight or ten regulars would return
each year for three seasons to build
up the finest three-year grid record
the Farm has known.
Tho class of '36 is gone.
But wait. Thinks could be a lot
worse!
