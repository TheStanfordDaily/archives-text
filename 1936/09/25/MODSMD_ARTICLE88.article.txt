# Coach Bunn Smiles With Reason As Hoop Team Returns Intact
## Practice To Commence Immediately; Line-up Is Same as for Last Year 
### Harry Press 
"Smiling John" Bunn has all the
reason in the world to smile. While j
tho other three teams of the Big
Four are losing men by graduation,
Stanford's 1936 championship aggre- j
gation is returning intact, and, with
Ihc addition of three stellar hoop- i
sters up from last year's frosh,
should stay on top of the heap for
another season.
Bunn Speaks
The champs' mentor had quite a j
bit to say about opponents' chances 1
for the coming year. "Although
Southern Cal lost Hupp, around
wWetji their offense was built, and
Browning, husky sharp - shooting
forward, I believe their team will
be just as good this year, if not
better.
"Last yeai''s frosh team was one
of the outstanding yearling groups
in the southland, and sends several
flashy players to the varsity to bol- .
ster "Elevator Sam" Barry's team. |
IJ.C.L.A. is in practically the same ;
position as U.S.C., losing only
Ashen, who was last year one of the
best guards on the coast.
"Cal also has an outstanding j
frosh team coming up to aid the
varsity, which loses only Olsen
and Rathbone, with Carlisle, Cordes,
and Herwig, among others, return-
ing."
Line-up the Same
This year's line-up will be the
same as it was in 1936. Luisetti and |
Turner will hold down the forward
positions; guards will be Calder
wood and Moore; and Stoefen will
again be center.
Bob Zonne, who last year alter
nated both at guard and center, will
now confine his attentions to the
guard post, and it will be his broth
er, Phil, whose average of 17 points
a game during his frosh year tabs
him as "the boy to watch." who ;
will vie with "Stork" Stoefen for ,
the center honors.
Bill Quade, H. B. Lee, and
"Sparky" Robertson are the other
mainstays who are returning, and
former frosh stars, besides Phil
Zonne, are Dick Neeley, who was
(he bulwark of the 1936 yearling,
defense, and Jack Kessel, who, ac
cording to "Smiling John," "han
dles the ball as well as any man i
on the squad."
Heath Doubtful
Whether or not Nellie Heath will
be out for the squad is doubtful, as
he sustained a severe leg injury in i
pre-season grid practice.
Practice will be held three times
a week, beginning immediately
after school opens. To give bas
ketball fans a chance to see how
the 1937 quintet acts under fire, !
three games are to be played be- '
fore the Christmas holidays, against <
as yet unannounced opponents. One
will be played soon after the Big
Game, and the other two just before ;
finals week. During the Christmas j
vacations the squad will tour the '
East on a barnstorming tour, play
ing many strong Mid-Western and
Eastern teams.
More than Hopeful
"Yes," said Bunn, "I think the ;
boys are going to do all right this
season. Only two men, Bell and
Nobs, graduated, and when the rest
of the squad comes back, in swell
shape after a good long rest, it
seems to me that they will be rarin'
to go. Hank's 200 pounds will help
build up a faster and steadier of- I
fense. You can say that the other
teams are going to have to hump
plenty to knock us off the top!"
"The Stanford campus has an
area of 8,800 acres. One thousand
of this are used for educational
purposes, and the rest are devoted
to farming, grazing, and timber."— j

Southern Cal lost Hupp, around
wWetji their offense was built, and
Browning, husky sharp - shooting
forward, I believe their team will
be just as good this year, if not
better.
"Last yeai''s frosh team was one
of the outstanding yearling groups
in the southland, and sends several

ster "Elevator Sam" Barry's team. |
IJ.C.L.A. is in practically the same ;
position as U.S.C., losing only
Ashen, who was last year one of the
best guards on the coast.
"Cal also has an outstanding j
frosh team coming up to aid the
varsity, which loses only Olsen
and Rathbone, with Carlisle, Cordes,
and Herwig, among others, return-
ing."
Line-up the Same
This year's line-up will be the
same as it was in 1936. Luisetti and |
Turner will hold down the forward
positions; guards will be Calder
wood and Moore; and Stoefen will
again be center.
Bob Zonne, who last year alter
nated both at guard and center, will
now confine his attentions to the
guard post, and it will be his broth
er, Phil, whose average of 17 points
a game during his frosh year tabs
him as "the boy to watch." who ;
will vie with "Stork" Stoefen for ,
the center honors.
Bill Quade, H. B. Lee, and
"Sparky" Robertson are the other
mainstays who are returning, and
former frosh stars, besides Phil
Zonne, are Dick Neeley, who was
(he bulwark of the 1936 yearling,
defense, and Jack Kessel, who, ac
cording to "Smiling John," "han
dles the ball as well as any man i
on the squad."
Heath Doubtful
Whether or not Nellie Heath will
be out for the squad is doubtful, as
he sustained a severe leg injury in i
pre-season grid practice.
Practice will be held three times
a week, beginning immediately
after school opens. To give bas
ketball fans a chance to see how
the 1937 quintet acts under fire, !
three games are to be played be- '
fore the Christmas holidays, against <
as yet unannounced opponents. One
will be played soon after the Big
Game, and the other two just before ;
finals week. During the Christmas j
vacations the squad will tour the '
East on a barnstorming tour, play
ing many strong Mid-Western and
Eastern teams.
More than Hopeful
"Yes," said Bunn, "I think the ;
boys are going to do all right this
season. Only two men, Bell and
Nobs, graduated, and when the rest
of the squad comes back, in swell
shape after a good long rest, it
seems to me that they will be rarin'
to go. Hank's 200 pounds will help
build up a faster and steadier of- I
fense. You can say that the other
teams are going to have to hump
plenty to knock us off the top!"
"The Stanford campus has an
area of 8,800 acres. One thousand
of this are used for educational
purposes, and the rest are devoted
to farming, grazing, and timber."— j

tho other three teams of the Big
Four are losing men by graduation,
Stanford's 1936 championship aggre- j
