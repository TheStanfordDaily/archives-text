# Rider, Needham Swim In Olympic Tryout Meets
## Vibert; Towne Return To Sprint, Breast Stroke; Winkelman to Diving 
### 
Along with other sports, the fame
of Stanford swimming traveled east
this summer when Dave Rider and
Winfield Needham, pride of Coach
, Nort Thornton's distance free-style
corps,, competed in Olympic elimi
nations.
In the Senior National A.A.U.
championships at Des Moines in
June, Rider was fourth in the mile
behind Flanagan of Miami, Hoyt
| of Yale, and Peery of Canada, and
ahead of Jack Medica of Washington
who later won the Berlin 400-meter
crown.
Rider Meets Stiff Opponents
Rider was fifth in the 880 at this
meet, defeating Jimmy Gilhula of
U.S.C. and John Macionis of Yale,
| both big names in U.S. swimming.
Needham had a cold and did not
! compete in Des Moines.
After that came a three weeks'
period of training at Yale under
Coach Kiputh of the U.S. Olympic
| team, after which the final Ameri
can tryouts were held at Provi
dence, R.1., in July.
Needham in Competition
Rider, perhaps a bit over-trained,
was fifth in the finals of the 1500
meters, two seconds behind Macio
j nis, while Needham was eighth, in
i trials that were judged by finishing
times only. In the 400 at this meet
Rider was second in to
Medica, but finished" eighth in the
finals while Needham was ninth. In
the 200-meter eliminations Need
ham was ninth, Rider tenth.
With Rider and Needham both
j returning to hold down the free-
I style distances, and Vibert and
Don Towne in the sprints and breast
stroke, respectively, and Roy Win
kelmann to dive, Coach Thornton's
1 swimming team should be a world
j beater next spring.
