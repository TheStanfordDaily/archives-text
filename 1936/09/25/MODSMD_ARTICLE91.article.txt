Stanford people is the fact that the
World Series for some reason starts
i that day.
And this year is no exception.
Present statistics point toward an- >
i other "Five Cent" or all-New York
classic, while Joe McCarthy's Yanks
already turned winners in Ameri
can League record time —18 games
out, and with Bill Terry's Giants
very close to grasping the National
League flag.
The Yankees of course are noted
ibis year for their "murderers' row"
or full squad of clean-up men— r
Gehrig, Di Maggio, Dickey, and j
Lazzeri, while the Giant willowmen, i
Ott, Whitehead, Moore, and Leiber, I
though not so famed are quite!
i nearly as efficient.
Pitching strength of the two teams j
I seems about equal, with Carl Hub-
I bell of the Giants already being
assigned a couple of victories by
the wags, and support from Schu
- macher, Gumpert, and Fitzsimmons.
I The Yanks, on the other hand, have j
a more widely spread strength in
Hadley, Broaca, Melone, and Pear
