# Gridders Become Gold Diggers For Summer
## 
### 
Stanford's gridders are plenty
versatile. This summer saw them
doing everything from ballyhooing
a gold-digging fan-dancer at the
Texas Centennial to digging gold in
the Empire Mine in Grass Valley.
Although most of the boys earned
their money in California, several
went far afield to bring home the
bacon. Colorado saw Fred Williams
as "a lone cowhand" on a dude
ranch, and Sam Beckley and Bob
Shannon, who paired up to scratch a
few flecks of gold from a mine.
Road Gang Experience
Porky Cuneo is a fugitive from a
road gang—that is, a state road con
struction gang in Oregon. Ralph
Quails learned how to march in a
Washington State ROTC camp. An
other Oregonian was Chet Olcott,
who earned his bread and butter
chopping down defenseless ti'ees
with his little hatchet.
Bob Mangan, who refuses to be
quoted on the matter, loafed in
Vancouver. "Ballyhooligan Doc"
Luckett completes the list of out
of-staters. His cash was earned at
the Texas Centennial.
Oil Field Workouts
Back in God's country, we find
that the Bakersfield and Taft oil
fields helped Jimmy Coffis, Bob Da
kan, Carl Schott, and Leo Ferko
make money and gain weight.
Other black gold tycoons ar>* Bill
Paulman, who got a good tan in Lost
Hills, and "Choo-Choo" Tsoutsuvas,
whose piano-legs shook Mother
Earth in the vicinity of Santa Maria.
A Long Beach office engulfed
"Barrel Bob" Matthews, Joe Vigna,
and Jack Clark, while Russell Mc-
Kinney drove a truck in Visalia,
and Berneth Layer did likewise in
Salinas.
They Went Digging
Grass Valley gold-diggers—from
a mine—were Dick Partridge, Tony

Mecia, Wally DeWitt, Andy Stojko-_
vich, Fred Gustafson, and "Pete the
Moose" Zagar. "Crooner Cab" Cal
loway puttered and putted around
I the Stanford golf course, and also
! keeping the home fires burning
were Pop Grant and Earl Hoos,
who spent their time getting some
"book-larnin'" at summer school.
Paly kiddies and gals were treated
| to the sight of Glen Hamilton mak
ing ice cream. Bill Kirsch kept, the
wires burning for the San Francisco
| telephone company, Tom Collins
, gassed Cal crates at a Berkeley
filling station, and Dave Carnahan
helped build something in Los An
geles.
San Bernardino had Byron West
as a rancher, and Stockton had
Chuck Drace. Loafing were Wally
Hege, who was "at home" in River
side, Jay Holdridge, who wasn't
j even at home, and the Catalina
beach-comber, Grant Stone.
