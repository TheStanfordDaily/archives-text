"Any good American high school
team could have won the Olympic
basketball championship," Gordy
Mallatratt, member of the American
demonstration baseball team, as
serted upon his return to the Farm
from Europe.
Most foreign basketball players
shoot underhand and like many
other of the athletes at the Games,
came to learn how the game is
â€¢ played, Mallatratt declared. The
I Olympic casaba championship was
played outside in accordance with
French rules which permit much
less body contact than the American.
Mallatratt played second base
man on one of the two American
teams which put on a demonstration
of the "great American pastime"
before 100,000 enthusiastic Nazi
spectators. Coach Harry Wolter had
charge of the squad of college play
ex-s among whom were, in addition
to Mallatratt, Fred Herrington, Dick
Hanna, and Ike Livermore of Stan
ford.
The success of the demonstration,
according to Mallatratt, may be
measured by the fact that 15 na
\ tions agreed to send teams to the
| 1940 Games in Tokyo.
