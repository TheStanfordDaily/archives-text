Coach "Tiny" Thornhill made his
debut on the transcontinental net-
I work of the National Broadcasting
I Company Monday when he dis
cussed "Sport's Place in the College
I Curriculum" on a program ad
j dresstd to the Class of 15)40 en
titled, "What Every Freshman
Should Know."
Thornhill described college as the
four finest years in life, advising
entering freshmen to lay out for
themselves a well balanced pro
; gram in which sport should play an
important part. Freshmen with any
athletic ability, he declared, should
pick their favorite sport, report for
practice, and stick to it, for in so
doing they will be afforded the op
, portunity of associating with the fin
; est group of youngsters in college.
