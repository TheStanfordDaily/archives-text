It's in the air, boys; have you
got it?
Scrape the sand out of your ears,
exhale the coal dust and salt air,
bring your rain coat, and get on the
trolley, 'cause King Football is in
again, I'm telling ya.
Yes, I know, you still reek of Joe
Louis—Max Schmehng, the Ameri
can Olympic Committee and Elea
nor Holm, Joe DiMaggio and all the
rest, but get back to the Farm and
you can't mistake it.
The place is overrun with 'em—
about 160 beefers are monopolizing
the campus, candidates for Stanford
freshman and varsity teams. Man
agers, coaches, and team are the
only people around, training table
is the only food the Co-op is put
ting out, and practice is the only
sure place to find Jim or Mike to
discuss last week's two seed loan.
It's great. A real tonic to have the
whole campus united again after a
spring season where everybody is
interested in this or that sport and
as a result nobody goes to see or
cheer anything.
MEMORIES—
Reminds you of all sorts of things.
Creeping up on Troy in '33 and fi
nally slapping 'em down in the Coli
seum. The '34 season of easy wins
climaxed by that awful orgy in
Berkeley that was so long and
drawn out before the relief came.
Last year, with every one a thriller,
the awful feeling after U.C.L.A., the
wonderful spirit before and the fire
engine parade and rally after Wash
ington, the fitting ending of three
straight over Cal.
And those Rose Bowlers — Rain
and Columbia and Lou Little's mag
azine articles; Alabama's big score,
so sudden and thorough that nobody
ever seemed to discuss it or care,
ana that classic last time of two
splendid clubs battling to the last
ditch.
Other things come up —the Cal
rooting section after a game, the
bands marching through punting
practice, the scramble for tickets,
Grayson going to and from the
bench, tearing up the cards, the
thud of leather, the smell of sweat
and ether in the locker rooms, and
the bonfire.
I tell you, football is king in its
own right!
* A NEW SETUP
We have a new situation this time,
with all Conference schedules at
equal weights and calling for seven
straight rate games. Whether this
tends to favor a weak team or a
strong team or anybody, it's hard
to say, but this I know: every game
on the schedule will count and
count heavily on the score sheet.
All of our schedule is conference
except two: Santa Clara, the opener,
and Columbia, the finale in New
York, November 28. These, you will
note, are as good as any; Santa Clara
is a long-time rival, sole blemish on
the '34 season, and occupies the
psychological important opening
date. Columbia is another; there
is a Rose Bowl and Saturday Eve
ning Post score to settle, and some
important eastern prestige to bol
ster.
Get it? It means that we have to
be on our toes every time, that you,
and you, and you have to get be
hind Thornhill and his team and
push to the limit, all week, every
week.
PLANNED BACKING
Web Jones and his gang will ar
range all kinds of stuff—all univer
sity practice days with women spec
tators especially for some reason

requested by Tiny, torchilght and j
S.P. station rallies, and windshield I
stickers, all the way through, with |
emphasis that there is to be no let- i
down; every game is as important j
as the next.
Let's not have a bit of crying; it's j
going to be more difficult this year j
than before, but you've guL lu get
used to fighting for your wins iust
like everybody else.
And the fight is anything but
hopeless; Washington and Califor
nia look pretty big to the scribes,
but both have their weaknesses—
look at their ends, for instance.
The Bruins, too, look good, but no
better than last year, if as good,
while all this rot about Troy looks
from here to be unfounded. They're
in a mess down there.
We have a dandy bunch of boys
working hard out there, and more, j
we have the best coach in the world
working with them.
So come on, citizens; climb on
this new Big Red Toboggan and give
a big shove. Let's see how far we
can ride!
