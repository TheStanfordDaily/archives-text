f keep the
COST of
living
By keeping prices low,
Penney's keeps the cost
of living down And in
that way, we build toward
a higher standard of liv
ing, toward continually
increasing Prosperity!
Here's the way it works.
We make it possible for
more people to afford the
things that make life more
pleasant and comfortable.
As more people buy, the
demand for goods in- i
creases, more must be
produced. This creates
more jobs, all along the
line from the factory to
Penney's own counters!
