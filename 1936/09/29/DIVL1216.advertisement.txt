I han a,
Letter!
/ Dear Son:
/ Those Stanford Dailies your mother and I Jw
/ are getting every morning keep us posted on
I what's happening "down on the Farm" bet- agf
/ ter than any letter you've ever written!
/ Then, too, the paper is a daily reminder jjgjy
/ that we're not forgotten, even if you are too SB
J busy to write. Though of course we couldn't
j expect you to do the work of The Daily s
/ fifty reporters in "covering the campus." J
I Thanks for the year's subscription. We get fa/
I so much pleasure from reading The Daily J
j that I'm even glad to pay that trifling $4 bill Jfy
