# Frosh Aroused For Mud Brawl
## Favored To Out-slush '39 In Annual Mess 
### 
Early reports from Encina hall de
note an enthusiastic expectancy al
ready arising for the annual mud
fight between sophomores and fresh
men. According to tradition, the
mudfight is scheduled to bo held
within the next week or two on the
frosh football field.
The Class of '39, only undefeated
class in the history of the mudfights,
will issue the annual challenge to
Encina as soon as President Peter
Fay appoints a soph mudfight cap
tain.
Frosh on Own
As largely as- possible through
their own initiative this year, the
frosh will then organize and appoint
their leaders. The Class of '40 is
highly favored.
For 15 minutes each side will at
tempt to drag its opponents behind
the lines into prepared mud pits.
Count will be made of the victims,
and the side having dunked the most
captives by the end of the battle will
be declared the victor. A judge's
committee, composed of juniors and
seniors, will be appointed later.
Gawkcrs Expected
As usual, a large crowd of specta
tors is expected to witness both the
mudfight and the parade of laundry
sack-clad frosh which will precede
the tournament.
Last year's battle was very closely
contested. Under their captain. Phil
Zonne, the Class of '39 just barely
nosed out '38 by an 84-82 score.
Hopes run high through the hearts
of this year's sophomores that they
may become the first class to annex
both ends of the two-year combat.

The most positive men are the
most credulous. '
There arc 330,000,000 feet of
standing timber in the state of
' Washington.
