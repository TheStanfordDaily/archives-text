# Wolter Faces Bright Future With Vet Team
## Three Regulars Absent As Ball Squad Opens Fall Practice Season 
### Dave Swanberg 
With a veteran team returning,
Coach Harry Woiter has an opti
mistic outlook for his baseball team
j this year. Only three of last year's
I regulars were lost by graduation.
The catcher's position will be well
taken care of by Leo Heagerty, rated
by many as the finest college catcher
in the state. In addition to playing
errorless ball behind the plate, he is
one of the heaviest hitters on the
squad.
Ray Weiershauser, the Indians' ace
hurler, is returning and will be given
assistance by Howard Paine, Spike
Furman, and the left-handed Tom
Killefer. Woiter may use Killefer in
the outfield if he continues to show
the batting improveemnt that he evi
denced at the end of practice last
year.
Holman at First
First base will probably be held
down by Captain Red Holman, al
though Woiter may bring in Vern
Johnson from the tfutfield and have
Holman in the outer garden, since he
is considerably faster than Johnson.
Shortstop and third base will be
manned by Veterans George Farrell
and Buck Newsom, respectively.
Coach Woiter is somewhat concerned
about the second base position, as
Frank Tremaine graduated and his
understudy, Jack Huddleston, trans
ferred to Oregon. Dale Reimer looks
to be the best bet for the keystone
sack at present.
Olympic Vet Plays
Besides Johnson, the outfield will
consist of Dick Hanna, who played
on the American Olympic baseball
team in Berlin this summer; Bob
Matthews, and Glenn Hamilton. The
latter two are at present out for foot
ball and will not report for baseball
practice until next quarter.
These regulars will be pressed for
positions on the varsity by members
of last year's second string and by
lasc year's none-too-strong freshman
team, the mainstays being Tony
Mecia, Hub Huebel, Wally de Witt,
Walter Hege, Hank Glasser, Ed Gar
nier, and Phil Zonne.
Practice Eased Up
Practice will be held only three
times a week this quarter as outside
competition does not begin until
February. The varsity practices on
the sunken diamond, while the fresh
men will convene on the field ad
joining it.
All freshmen interested in baseball
are urged to sign up as soon as pos
sible so that the team may be able to
function as a unit Woiter will take
charge of it this fall, but after foot
ball is over Coaches Bobby Grayson
and Jim Lawson will endeavor to!
whip the 1940 team into a winning
aggregation.

team in Berlin this summer; Bob
Matthews, and Glenn Hamilton. The
latter two are at present out for foot
ball and will not report for baseball
practice until next quarter.
These regulars will be pressed for
positions on the varsity by members
of last year's second string and by
lasc year's none-too-strong freshman
team, the mainstays being Tony
Mecia, Hub Huebel, Wally de Witt,
Walter Hege, Hank Glasser, Ed Gar
nier, and Phil Zonne.
Practice Eased Up
Practice will be held only three
times a week this quarter as outside
competition does not begin until
February. The varsity practices on
the sunken diamond, while the fresh
men will convene on the field ad
joining it.
All freshmen interested in baseball
are urged to sign up as soon as pos
sible so that the team may be able to
function as a unit Woiter will take
charge of it this fall, but after foot
ball is over Coaches Bobby Grayson
and Jim Lawson will endeavor to!
whip the 1940 team into a winning
aggregation.
With a veteran team returning,
Coach Harry Woiter has an opti
mistic outlook for his baseball team
j this year. Only three of last year's
I regulars were lost by graduation.
The catcher's position will be well
taken care of by Leo Heagerty, rated
by many as the finest college catcher
in the state. In addition to playing
errorless ball behind the plate, he is
one of the heaviest hitters on the
squad.
Ray Weiershauser, the Indians' ace
hurler, is returning and will be given
assistance by Howard Paine, Spike
Furman, and the left-handed Tom
Killefer. Woiter may use Killefer in
the outfield if he continues to show
the batting improveemnt that he evi
denced at the end of practice last
year.
Holman at First
First base will probably be held
down by Captain Red Holman, al
though Woiter may bring in Vern
Johnson from the tfutfield and have
Holman in the outer garden, since he
is considerably faster than Johnson.
Shortstop and third base will be
manned by Veterans George Farrell
and Buck Newsom, respectively.
Coach Woiter is somewhat concerned
about the second base position, as
Frank Tremaine graduated and his
understudy, Jack Huddleston, trans
ferred to Oregon. Dale Reimer looks
to be the best bet for the keystone
sack at present.
Olympic Vet Plays
Besides Johnson, the outfield will
consist of Dick Hanna, who played
on the American Olympic baseball
team in Berlin this summer; Bob
Matthews, and Glenn Hamilton. The
latter two are at present out for foot
ball and will not report for baseball
practice until next quarter.
