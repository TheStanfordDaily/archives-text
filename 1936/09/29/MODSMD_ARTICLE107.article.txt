# Maloney Asks For Boxing Material
## 
### 
A wild scramble for the positions
on the boxing team will be expected
as nearly all the veterans have filled
out their eligibility, according to
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports.
As to his material for the coming !
year, Maloney is uncertain until the j
registration days are over.
Any students, new or old, who are j
interested in the art of using their '
two hands as weapons, are requested
to sign up. There will be a novice
tournament to be held this fall, fol- j
lowed by the intercollegiate matches |
whose entrants are mostly chosen j
from the winners in the novice I
match.
