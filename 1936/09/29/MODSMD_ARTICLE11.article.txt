## 
### 
First of A.S.S.U. President Jim 1
Reynolds' plans for the new year will
be carried out tonight when movies
of the Santa Clara game are shown
in the Little Theater before the Reg
istration Dance.
] Reynolds projects weekly show
| ings of the football pictures which
j the B.A.C. takes of every game, fol
! lowing the success of last year's oc
! casional showings. "If not of every
! game, at least of every off-campus
( game," says the student head.
Another of his plans is organized
i and co-ordinatcd student effort to
â€¢ "sell" Stanford to prospective stu
j dents.
"Students must assume their share
i of responsibility in selling Stanford
jto prospective students, especially
j athletes," Reynolds said. "The alum
ni are getting tired of digging up
! nuggets, sending them here to look

the place over, and then having them
ignored when they get on the cam
pus.
"Down at 5.C.," says the student
body prexy, "they treat 'em as if
they were gods. We don't have to
given 'em the place, but it wouldn't
hurt for some of the boys to ask
'em up to the house for lunch."
Athletes are not the only pros
pects to be so treated, but Reynolds,
being an athlete himself, believes it
important to impress the brawny
boys. "After all," Reynolds said,
"it's the athletes who provide most
of the fun for the rest of the stu
dents, and it's the athletic teams that
represent Stanford most strongly in
the minds of the public."
In the field of Ex Committee-sub
sidiary organization relations, Rey
nolds promises co-operation and a
fair deal for all, at least as far as he
can make it possible.
