# Improved Timing, Figures Thornhill, Major Need In Build-up for Courage
## Squad Labors on Pass, Line Drills; Jim Coffis Returns to Workouts 
### Herb Diamond 
Last Saturday's grid season opener
resulted i na 13-0 drubbing for Stan-
I fordâ€”a Santa Clara victory for the
first time in four years; but it ap
parently takes a lot more than that
| to dim the hopes of Tiny Thornhill
and his charges.
Tiny readily acknowledges that
i the clockwork timing that comes
only with experience seems to have
left with the "vowing sophomores";
[ nevertheless there's no reason why
lit cannot be regained. Seasoning
J should bring it.
There is also the fact that the
squad's blocking mildly pleased the
head mentor. This in itself might
| well bolster the hopes of disap
pointed Stanford fans. The Indians
in their first game lacked experience
| and they lacked timing, the passing
j looked weak, but there is still no
j reason to believe they didn't show
I promise.
Passing Practice
Yesterday afternoon's session on
J the practice field was devoted en
tirely to passing and line drills, and
similar workouts will continue
throughout this week. Hamilton and
Brigham did most of the tossing
while Stone, Sehott, Cummings, and
Rasmussen each did his share of
receiving. These six gridders will
form the basis upon which Tiny
hopes to build a creditable passing
attack.
Cofiis' log injury apparently gave
; him little trouble yesterday, for he
| was doing all of his share in the
lineup. Paulman, however, has defi-
I nitely decided not to enter school
this quarter, and thus he will save
I an entire year's eligibility instead of
attempting to play this season after
, having cracked an ankle bone.
W.S.C. Win, Maybe
It must be remembered that
Thornhill's usual forecast is any
thing but optimistic for a coming
! game, but he has not yet made any
j predictions to the effect that Stan-
J ford will go int othe Washington
State fracas this week-end as the
J underdog. And with the added cm
! phasis on a passing attack together
j with line workouts this week, the
i outlook for the Farm eleven should
prove anything but discouraging.
