BELL, 0., Sept. 28 (/P). â€” Police
threw two tear gas bombs today to
disperse hundreds of striking Me
morial High School students, pro
testing against the transfer of a fa
vorite teacher. Three youths were
held on charges of suspicion.
Police Chief Frank Cunningham
discharged the bombs near the
throng as the students refused to
hall a demonstration outside the
school and enter the building. A
squad of half a dozen policemen
were on the scene.
