# Coach Returns To Campus After Year of Travel
## Maloney Arouses Anzac Interest in Olympiad; May Make Bid in 1944 
### John Dern 
Back to the campus this fall after
a year's leave of absence comes
Harry Maloney for his twenty
eighth year in Stanford Physical
Education activities. His official
title remains Director of Minor !
Sports.
Most of the past year Maloney
spent in travel, visiting educational
institutions and renewing old ac
quaintanceships. Height of his year's
experiences was his five months'
journey aboard a freighter to and
around Australia.
In Australia Maloney made several
definite accomplishments. His ef- i
forts aroused Australian interest in j
seeking the 1944 or 1948 Olympic-
Games bid.
Ilave Large Stadia
The Australians are particularly
well suited for the holding of the j
Games since they already possess j
fine large municipal stadia and both
summer and winter sports may be
held at the same time of year. Ma
loney's suggestion that Sydney be |
given the summer sports and the
mountains 40 miles away from Mel
bourne be given the winter sports
has evidently united the country in
amicable co-operation for seeking
the bid after Tokyo. The Honorable
Archdale Parkhill, Minister of De- |
tense, whom Maloney assisted in this
work, has received great encourage
ment from the Premier.
Australian tracks are made oi
grass. Changing these to cinders and
widening them from six to eight
lanes is all that needs to be done to
prepare Australia for Olympic spon
sorship.
Schedules Series
While in Australia, Maloney also
brought about the scheduling for
1938 of an all-University good-will
rugby series with Australian teams.
The American team is to be formed
of the Coast's best rugby players. \
Primary purpose of this tour will be i
to help Sydney celebrate her 150 th
anniversary.
Cricket, track, and rugby are the |
three leading athletic sports on the ;
southern continent. Baseball has
gotten a bad start, Maloney says, be- |
ing emphasized only professionally ,
and not in the schools.
Stanford as a school stands head |
and shoulders above othe PraciAc
Coast schools in the estimation of 1
Australians. This is due primarily
to the number of successful Stan
ford men in Australia. There is good |
room for college graduates in Aus- 1
tralia, whose population is only six
and a half million; twenty million J
inhabitants might subsist.
On the return trip Maloney and
his freighter were nearly stranded i
on the reefs off Pitcairn Island when
the Diesel engine went bad. Two
hundred inhabitants live on the is
land today, but most of the youths
nowadays migrate to Australia.
Takes Auto Trip
His year's experiences were com- ;
pleted with an auto trip across the
continent and athletic talks to Ca
nadian high schools.
Maloney is to coach soccer and |
rugby this year and "keep his eye
on" boxing and fencing. He hopes j
to repeat his soccer record of 42
straight victories, including nine
years of double victories over Cali
fornia. He will accompany the Stan
ford graduates Paly All-Blacks to
Vancouver this Christmas, but Stan
ford's varsity probably will not make
a similar trip north this year.

around Australia.
In Australia Maloney made several
definite accomplishments. His ef- i
forts aroused Australian interest in j
seeking the 1944 or 1948 Olympic-
Games bid.
Ilave Large Stadia
The Australians are particularly
well suited for the holding of the j
Games since they already possess j
fine large municipal stadia and both
summer and winter sports may be
held at the same time of year. Ma
loney's suggestion that Sydney be |
given the summer sports and the
mountains 40 miles away from Mel
bourne be given the winter sports
has evidently united the country in
amicable co-operation for seeking
the bid after Tokyo. The Honorable
Archdale Parkhill, Minister of De- |
tense, whom Maloney assisted in this
work, has received great encourage
ment from the Premier.
Australian tracks are made oi
grass. Changing these to cinders and
widening them from six to eight
lanes is all that needs to be done to
prepare Australia for Olympic spon
sorship.
Schedules Series
While in Australia, Maloney also
brought about the scheduling for
1938 of an all-University good-will
rugby series with Australian teams.
The American team is to be formed
of the Coast's best rugby players. \
Primary purpose of this tour will be i
to help Sydney celebrate her 150 th
anniversary.
Cricket, track, and rugby are the |
three leading athletic sports on the ;
southern continent. Baseball has
gotten a bad start, Maloney says, be- |
ing emphasized only professionally ,
and not in the schools.
Stanford as a school stands head |
and shoulders above othe PraciAc
Coast schools in the estimation of 1
Australians. This is due primarily
to the number of successful Stan
ford men in Australia. There is good |
room for college graduates in Aus- 1
tralia, whose population is only six
and a half million; twenty million J
inhabitants might subsist.
On the return trip Maloney and
his freighter were nearly stranded i
on the reefs off Pitcairn Island when
the Diesel engine went bad. Two
hundred inhabitants live on the is
land today, but most of the youths
nowadays migrate to Australia.
Takes Auto Trip
His year's experiences were com- ;
pleted with an auto trip across the
continent and athletic talks to Ca
nadian high schools.
Maloney is to coach soccer and |
rugby this year and "keep his eye
on" boxing and fencing. He hopes j
to repeat his soccer record of 42
straight victories, including nine
years of double victories over Cali
fornia. He will accompany the Stan
ford graduates Paly All-Blacks to
Vancouver this Christmas, but Stan
ford's varsity probably will not make
a similar trip north this year.
Back to the campus this fall after
a year's leave of absence comes
Harry Maloney for his twenty
eighth year in Stanford Physical
Education activities. His official
title remains Director of Minor !
Sports.
Most of the past year Maloney
spent in travel, visiting educational
institutions and renewing old ac
quaintanceships. Height of his year's
experiences was his five months'
journey aboard a freighter to and
around Australia.
