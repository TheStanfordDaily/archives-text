Is anyone up in the air about our
varsity's debut Saturday?
Well, calm down, everybody; I
know it's hard to take a licking after
going so long without them, but
there are a number of things to be
said about the Santa Clara situa
tion, and more important than that,
about the few remarks you hear
around—"Cheez, we couldn't take
Paly High this year."
We're not bad off; such remarks
are a sign both of poor training and
football ignorance, and above all
they are un-Stanfordlike. We won't
get far that way. Look here:
Tiny Thornhill, who should know
as much about it as any of us, is as
cheerful and optimistic as ever,
which is plenty. He knows the odds
were pretty long against us at the
start, but more than that, he saw a
lot of redshirts playing admirable
ball under the circumstances, and
some that with a little tutelage and
rehearsing can go to form a new and
virulent Big Red Machine.
BRONCS WERE SUPERIOR
Santa Clara was the best team on
the field, and if they had played to
their capabilities, were a good 13
points better than Stanfox-d. With the
butches of both sides scored up, 7 or
.10 to nothing would compare them
closer, off the statistics.
But they should be good, citizens,
and they are going to have a sea
son! Seven of them started against
us last year, and five the year before.
That's experienced material, and
some big guys go to Santa Clara, and
Shaw is a good coach, and Manny
Gomez and Jules Perrin were ex
tremely hot ball carriers Saturday.
So much for that.
On the credit side you have a
number of other facts. Did any of
you see Clark? Yea, Jack was good
that day—played the full way, and
was just as good at the end as at the
beginning, slapping the Broncs down
time and again when they ran their
right side, sometimes making two or
three gets in succession. He also
caught two forward passes, more
than all the rest of the players put
together.

BALL PLAYERS—GOOD ONES

Fred Williams looked awfully hard I
to catch up until the time of his in- I
jury. The wags say that Fred is I
going to do a lot of ball carrying
this year when the new A.P. (After
Paulman) plan of strategy goes into
effect.
And Jake Brigham, starting off 1

when the rest of the boys were tired,
pitching them left-handed for bulls'
eyes. Vigna's reverses were surpris
ingly effective, and Coffis will bring
his back this week.
Hoos was tough all afternoon, and
did good calling, or as good as a los
ing quarterback can look. Ham, in
spite of you, was steady considering
his experience.
The line had some good defensive
play—Matthews and Ferko went all
the way, while Callaway, Tsoutsou
ves. and Galvelli were hard to cross.
Pop rant made some nice ones.
So there you are. Santa Clara
gained 20 more yards that day, but
was on the short end of the first
downs. No one was carried off, in
itself a remarkable thing, but the
complete absence of Stanford pen
alties was quite significant.
Shows that the boys were alert and
clean, and there are 7 or 12 good
prospects out there, and, from Tiny's
post-game grin, that we still can win
more than several.
