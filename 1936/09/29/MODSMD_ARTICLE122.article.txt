St. Mary's Gets Scare

other good for 91 yards on the kick
off, resulted in St. Mary's being be
hind at the half, 13-12.
The Gaels scored first, but failed to
convert. Then came Gonzaga's two
bedlam - raising touchdowns, with
one conversion, followed by St. Ma
ry's second score. The second half
was St. Mary's Tremendous reserve
power pushed the final score up to
26-13.

week-end's best game, the Washing

Huskies into camp 14-7.
The first score came two minutes
after the start of the second period.

nine plays, Rork drove the final two
yards over left guard to the prom

score being immediately tied by
Logg's conversion.

fourth quarter when Alphonse boot
ed a long one over Haines' head.
Haines, running toward his own goal,
fumbled the catch, and Antol of the

recovery on Washington's 30. Two
plays—both passes—later, and the
game was Minnesota's.
