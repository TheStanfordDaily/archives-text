# Spanish Rebel Spares Hank
## Luisetti's Spanish Gets O.K. from Sentry 
### 
A 12-year-old Spanish rebel held
in his hands the hopes and aspira
tions of the Pacific Coast Conference
champion Stanfoi'd basketball team
early in the summer when he jabbed
the muzzle of a rifle into the ribs
of "Hank" Luisetti in a Spanish l bor
der town.
Luisetti, traveling as the guest of
Edwin Woods, Stanford junior, was
hurrying out of an alley from the
rear of a hotel to join Woods in the
last France-bound train out of the
war-torn area when the suspicious
youngster accosted him. The fright
ened Luisetti elevated his arms and
muttered "Americano, americano" in
the best Spanish he could muster.
The youth finally got the drift and
let him go unharmed.
Later Luisetti and Woods attended
the Olympic Games in Berlin and
proceeded to other European cities.
When he returned to Farm two
weeks ago Coach John Bunn hardly
knew his agile forward who had
reached the 200-pound mark.
