# Maloney Admits Ignorance About Soccer Season
## Only 3 Veterans Return; Sign-up Set for 4 p.m. Tomorrow at Encina 
### 
When the public is in the dark
about the prospects of a team and
who's going to play and how, it just
isn't anything unusual; but when the !
coach himself doesn't know who or
what or how, then the situation is
really under wraps.
Soccer prospects loom darker than
a 40-to-l shot at Epsom Downs, be- ;
cause nobody knows who will be
back from last year's varsity or who i
will show up from last year's frosh !
or nuthin', nohow. One thing that is
pretty definite, though, is the return
of Bullis, Gomez, and Deßennedetti,
former varsity men, to help Coach
Harry Maloney in tutoring the dark
horses in the rudiments of soccer.
With the sign-up set for tomorrow i
afternoon at 4:00 in Encina gym for
both frosh and varsity, Coach Ma- i
loney has issued a call for as many
new recruits as possible for both
outfits. The opening game will be I
with San Jose State October 10, so j
there will be little time to whip the
squad into shape.
The complete conference schedule
is as follows:
October 10 —San Jose State at San
Jose.
October 17—San Mateo J.C. at San
Mateo.
October 24—San Jose State here.
November 7—U.S.F. here.
November 14—California here.
November 21—California at Berke
ley.
November 25—San Mateo J.C. here.
December S—U.S.F. at San Fran
cisco. !
