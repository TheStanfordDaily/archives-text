NEW YORK, Sept. 27 (/P).â€”Char
lie Siegel, elusive little back from
New York University, playing his
first game in professional football,
provided the spark which carried the
New York Yankees to a 13-6 vic
tory over the Syracuse Braves Sun
day in their first home game in the
newly organized American League.
A crowd of about 5000 saw the con
test in the Municipal Stadium on
Randall's Island.
