# MASTERS EXPLAINS OLYMPIC TEAM RIOTING IN BERLIN
## Articles on Corruption To Be Published

Too many kibitzers made the
American Olympic delegation one of
the most trouble-beset at the games,
according to A1 Masters, graduate
manager, who accompanied the U.S.
athletes to Berlin as a track and field
manager.
And the woes that led to the
abrupt return of Jesse Owens and
the expulsion of Eleanor Holm Jar
rett are only the beginning, folks.
Masters' original sound-off on
Olympic mismanagement made on
his return to New York was consid
ered by sports dopesters as the open
ing gun of a new warfare between
college leaders and A.A.U. officials
for control of the Olympic organiza
tion.
Writes Articles
And now Masters is writing an ar
ticle on the subject with Frank Tay
lor, former editor of the Illustrated
Review, soon to be published in Col
liers', amplifying his original charges
against the management of the teams
both before and after embarking for
Germany.
"To start with there were too many
officials with something to say, each
one conflicting with the other, and
making the trip a long round of an
noyances for the athletes. The trip
seemed to be planned for the enjoy
ment of the bosses," he declared.
"In the second place, there was a
lack of contact between the athletes,
housed in Olympic Village, and the
officials, who lived in comfortable
hotels miles away."
Trip Mismanaged
'"The handling of the trip simply |
bred discontent among the athletes. !
There was, for instance, the dollar- j
per-week-for-laundry gag, with all :
funds held by the coaches and offi- |
cicris, and an unbelievably meager
lowance doled out to the athletes to 1
pay for current expenses."
"Instead of a few good times fol- j
lowing the games, the officials de
cided on barnstorming excessively j
wearing, particularly after such ef- ]
fort as Olympic victories required." |
"Anxiety to get the percentage of
profits was jhort-sighted, and was, '
I believe, the motivating cause of
such debacles as the Owens return," I
Masters declared.
"In my opinion, Owens did the I
proper thing." ,
