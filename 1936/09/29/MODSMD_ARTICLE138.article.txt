### Harry Press 
When you are listening to the \
broadcast of the game with Colum- ;
bia on November 28, and hear i
j this ....
"We're in the last quarter now,
with just about ten minutes to go. J
The score is still 7-6, Columbia ,
leading. Stanford's ball, third down, !
on their own 36-yard line. Paulman |
is back to kick . . . the ball Is i
snapped . . . and it's blocked! That ■
slippery pigskin is rolling way over !
1 to the other sideline . . . Coffis is
after it ... he grabs it and begins
i to tear down the side . . ."
. . . don't get excited and yell, !
j "Hey! Did you hear that? How |
come he's getting away with it? j
That isn't legal!" Because for once, j
1 you, the loud-speaker quarterback, |
are wrong.
Old Rule Now Out
Heretofore, a ball kicked from
scrimmage, as a punt, drop kick, or
place kick, which did not cross the
scrimmage line (for example — a i
blocked kick), could be recovered I
by either team, but only the team j
that did not put the ball in play I
could run with it.
The best that the kicking team 1
got out of their misplay was to re- |
cover the ball, if they could, lose a
down on the play, but they could s
not advance it.
Advancing the Ball
This arrangement was not to the .
liking of either John Football Fan ,
or the players and coaches. So j
when the time came for the annual j
get-together of the bigwigs who j
make up the National Rules Com- [
mittee, a loud howl was heard, j
Thus, from now on, "Any player j
of either side may recover and ad
vance a ball kicked from scrimmage j
which for any reason does not cross j
the scrimmage line."
Two other changes, both minor,
were made by the Rules Committee, i
The first one places the responsibil
ity for prompt appearance on the
field for the start of the game and
for the second half up to the coaches
of the teams without notification
from the officials.
Legal Substitutions
The second recommends to com- 1
peting schools that by mutual
agreement the coaches assume all ,
responsibility for th<i legality of j
substitutions. Up to this year it
was necessary that the officials on
the field keep a record of the sub
stitutes as they came in and off the i
field, which often took considerable j
time and held up the games.
The "roving student" plan inaugu- j
rated this year at Princeton, allows :
students the widest possible choice of !
courses.
