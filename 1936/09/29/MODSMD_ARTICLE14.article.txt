That's the age California law re
quires residents to attain before they
ci<n legally partake of anything more
than soft drinks. Section 61 of the
state code very pointedly prohibits
the serving of alcoholic beverages
to minors, therefore the Slate Board
of Equalization officers, headed by
J. C. Corbett, arc rigidly enforcing
this law.
During the past two weeks officers
have centered their drive in the ter
ritory between Palo Alto and Gilroy.
The net result has been the turning
away from drink resorts of hundreds
of students and other minors, the
arrest of nineteen resort owners, and

seventeen convictions. One local es
tablishment. has been forced to close
its doors.
Enforcing the statutes in the Pe
ninsula area, officers have constantly
patrolled cafes and night clubs lo
cated on Highway 101. Thus, when
suspected minors order beverages
containing more than one-half of
one per cent alcohol, they will be
asked either by bartenders, waiters,
or the state officers themselves to
prove conclusively that they arc of
legal age. If the means of identifica
tion or the suspect's word is doubted,
the state board will further check
until it is satisfied or arrest the mi
nor together with the owner of the
establishment serving the drink.

In violations of the liquor code,
heaviest responsibility falls upon the
resort owner. For this reason, and
bccausc of the accompanying loss of
patrons, local owners have expressed
fear for their future prosperity.
Various complaints from Penin
sula schools have been listed as
moving the state board to institute
its current drive. Approximately fif
teen thousand minors arc enrolled
in public high schools, junior col
leges, or Stanford University within
the area now under surveillance.
Officers have warned that any of
these convicted as violators of the
liquor code wijl be sentenced to the
detention home.
So, it is soft drinks or no drinks.
