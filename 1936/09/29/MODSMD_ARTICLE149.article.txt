# YANKS, GIANTS WILL OPEN WORLD SERIES TOMORROW
## Bill Terry Will Depend On Pitching Strength 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 28 (JP).â€”'The
opening shots on the World Series
were fired from the rival camps of
the Giants and Yankees today, while
the front offices dusted off the "Sold
Out" signs for reserved seat tickets.
The Yankees came right out and
picked themselves and their batting
power to take the series, starting
Wednesday, in five games.
Bill Terry announced his prob
able starting lineup and put himself
on record as backing his Giants to
finish on top because of the old, old
baseball theory that good pitching
can silence heavy hitting any time.
More interesting, however, from
the pre-series standpoint than the
expected statements of confidence
from the rival forces was the an
nouncement by Giants' Secretary
Eddie Brannick that the Polo
Grounds' reserved and box sections
are completely gone for the first,
second, and, if necessary, sixth
games.
Big Seat Sale
The Yankees, who will entertain
the third, fourth, and fifth games,
scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and
' Sunday, in their stadium on the op
posite bank of the Harlem River,
also reported a shortage of reserved
1 seat tickets.
In his pre-battle statement, Terry
named his Giants for their "excep
i tional pitching," overlooking the
Broadway betting odds of 11 to 20,
; up or down, with the Yankees fa
i vorites, and the fact that his number
two pitcher, fat Freddy Fitzsimmons,
looked in anything but champion
ship form in the season's finale yes
terday.
Terry at First
Terry also made it known that
he's starting himself at first base in
the opening game, which "King Car
ol" Hubbell is expected to pitch, dc-
J spite his previous announcement
that Sambo Leslie will cover the
sack in the series. Apparently Terry
figures that he can hold down the
fust corner to more advantage, bad
I knee notwithstanding.
