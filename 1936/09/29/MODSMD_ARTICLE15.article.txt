# Frosh Pre-Reg Period Gets Initial Test; Honor Talks, Assembly Held
## Freshmen Learn Farm Traditions; Attend First Dance Given This Year 
### Dave Botsford 
Five hundred first-year men were
filled with just what they needed
to know about fraternity rushing,
Honor Code, and other aspects of
Stanford morality when they
jammed Encina's historic lobby Sat
urday night to hear speeches by the
Farm's student big-wigs.
Almon E. Roth, University comp
troller, scheduled to make the main
speech of the evening, was unable
to attend because of illness.
Bob Hoover, Interfraternity Coun
cil president, explained the Row's
new rushing rules in the principal
speech of the lobby meeting. "While
in general this year's regulations
will be more lenient than before,"
he said, "the Council will really
clamp down on houses and freshmen
violating the rules we do have."
A.S.S.U. President Jim Reynolds,
member of Zeta Psi, spoke on the
opportunities offered by Hall life.
"Fraternities are not the only thing
at Stanford," he explained. "You're
the one who must decide. You're the
one who must be happy. There are
plenty of fine fellows in the halls."
Later, while radios blared and a
few uninterested frosh played poker
in adjoining rooms, sponsors and
certain other student leaders ex
plained the Honor Code more fully
to small groups.
"Don't worry about the law steps,"
Men's Councilman Bill Quade told
his charges. "It's just a tradition.
Half the time you can't tell a fresh
man anyway." Cheers from the
freshmen at this.
Jim Reynolds told hi? group: "Re
member that some of your parents
are sacrificing to keep you here in
school, maybe giving up trips to
Europe, so that you can get an edu
cation. Grades aren't everything;
there is sometimes very little differ
ence between an A and a B. But
they are an indication of how much
you put into your work."
Other points cleared up for the
inquirers:
"There's no harm in getting liquor
down the highway. But leave it off
the campus," said Quade. He neg
lected to say that most El Camino
roadhouses have clamped down on
minors.
"You can tell on your room-mate
if you want to when he throws a
water-bag, but you don't have to,"
declared Jack Calderwood.
"Watch out for Gordy, the cop. He
usually hangs out by the 8.A.C., the
Libe, the post-office, and up the
Row," said Quade again.
Before streaming out for the
frosh jolly-up, the Encinans were
given mimeographed Honor Code
explanations written by Roy An
derson, Men's Council chairman.
And for the first time in years, they
really knew what it was all about.
