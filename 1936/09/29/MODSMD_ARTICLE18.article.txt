## 'Avalanche of Students Overwhelmed Me,' Professor Harriman Says 
### 
Contacted for quotes by The Daily
yesterday, members of the Lower
Division advisory committee ex
pressed their opinion on the newly \
organized pre-registration period as 1
follows:
"I feel that it was a very fine thing j
thing to get to talk and get ac- i
quainted with my advisees before j
the rush commences. I conducted i
an informal meeting in which ques
tions were invited on program prob- i
lems and general rules regarding law
school prerequisites."—Harry Rath- ,
bun, associate professor of law.
"The program as a whole is a
splendid thing, though I did not
personally advise any new students
myself. I am only a member of the
Lower Division ommittee through |
my position as Director of Western
Civilization courses."—Maxwell Sa
velle, associate professor of history.
"I hadn't expected any such ava- ;
lanche of students during the early .
advisory period. I really only ex- '
pected a few students who had prob
lems to talk over. It wasn't very sat
isfactory not having the actual reg
period beginning until Monday. I
think that it might he a good plan to
have one or two days more of actual
registration for new students in fu
ture years." — Raymond Harriman,
professor of classical literature.
"Though this is my first experience
as an adviser, I think that the job
is greatly simplified by having the
pre-reg advisory period. I talked
over the problems with about half of
my advisees, and I feel that it helped
them a great deal. A little more of
the same thing, perhaps ;.n added
day to the program, would further
improve the situation. We need more
of it."—Victor Twilly, assistant pro
fessor of biology.
"I found it very advantageous to
have freshmen students get away to
a much better start. The students
are able to get their programs fairly
well settled before the actual regis
tration day, which is a distinct ad
vantage."— Reginald Bell, assistant
professor of education.
"It is a step in the right direction.
The main thing in a pre-reg period
is to get the students to think about
their courses and not stampede into
the Administration Building, trying
to rush through it as quickly as
possible. The student really gets to
know what Stanford has to offer
them."—Paul Farnsworth, associate
professor of psychology.

professor of classical literature.
"Though this is my first experience
as an adviser, I think that the job
is greatly simplified by having the
pre-reg advisory period. I talked
over the problems with about half of
my advisees, and I feel that it helped
them a great deal. A little more of
the same thing, perhaps ;.n added
day to the program, would further
improve the situation. We need more
of it."—Victor Twilly, assistant pro
fessor of biology.
"I found it very advantageous to
have freshmen students get away to
a much better start. The students
are able to get their programs fairly
well settled before the actual regis
tration day, which is a distinct ad
vantage."— Reginald Bell, assistant
professor of education.
"It is a step in the right direction.
The main thing in a pre-reg period
is to get the students to think about
their courses and not stampede into
the Administration Building, trying
to rush through it as quickly as
possible. The student really gets to
know what Stanford has to offer
them."—Paul Farnsworth, associate
professor of psychology.
Contacted for quotes by The Daily
yesterday, members of the Lower
Division advisory committee ex
pressed their opinion on the newly \
organized pre-registration period as 1
follows:
"I feel that it was a very fine thing j
thing to get to talk and get ac- i
quainted with my advisees before j
the rush commences. I conducted i
an informal meeting in which ques
tions were invited on program prob- i
lems and general rules regarding law
school prerequisites."—Harry Rath- ,
bun, associate professor of law.
"The program as a whole is a
splendid thing, though I did not
personally advise any new students
myself. I am only a member of the
Lower Division ommittee through |
my position as Director of Western
Civilization courses."—Maxwell Sa
velle, associate professor of history.
"I hadn't expected any such ava- ;
lanche of students during the early .
advisory period. I really only ex- '
pected a few students who had prob
lems to talk over. It wasn't very sat
isfactory not having the actual reg
period beginning until Monday. I
think that it might he a good plan to
have one or two days more of actual
registration for new students in fu
ture years." — Raymond Harriman,
professor of classical literature.
