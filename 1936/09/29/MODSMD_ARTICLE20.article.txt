Members of the freshman class
turned out in almost full style Sat
urday morning to hear what old
time campus sages had to say on
the traditions and ideals of Stan
ford.
While the men on the floor eyed
the women in the stands, Chairman
Chick Franich opened the welcom
ing assembly by introducing stu
dent body President Jim Reynolds.
The Common Interest
Reynolds, who said he was
brought up on the ideals and tra
ditions of Stanford, told the fresh
men that Stanford had something
to offer each one of them if they
would take advantage of their op
portunities and work only as a unit.
"Stanford has lived up to my
every idea! and offers more ad
vantages than any other univer
sity in the world. It will mean the
same to you in time," stated Rey
nolds enthusiastically.
Following Reynolds was Esther
Pelton, student body vice-president,
with a short welcoming talk.
John Bunn Jests
In contrast, John Bunn, basketball
coach, humorously attempted to
warn the frosh about over-enthu
siasm by giving them a real laugh
with his story of an optimist who
slept all night in the steerage only
to wake up in the morning without
ever noticing the smell.
Quite at home in the Pavilion,
Burn also stressed the importance
of workni.g on one's own initiative,
for there would be no one around
who would push the frosh into ac
tivities.
"It is the love for the University
and the memories it holds for them
that causes the alumni to try to
get good athletes for Stanford
teams," Bunn said in closing.
Wally Baird and Fred Clark added
to the program their respective en
tertainment of piano ragging and
baby-killing pantomimes.

the floor and took an active part in
their first on-campus social activity
at Saturday's jolly-up.
