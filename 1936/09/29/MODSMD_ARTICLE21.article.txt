# Irwin Visits 'Black Hole Of Palo Alto'
## Find Scribe in Woodpile When Day of Reckoning Comes to Miscreant 
### Tom Irwin 
I have just returned from the j
I<l ;it*k Hole of Palo Alto, scourge of j
llif inisrreanls who get their ears j
mil nl low gear iu the city limits j
.'ind noted for the knotty problems
ii presents to its inmates
S;m Francisco police are not the
only ones who have a woodpile. The |
one in Palo Alto is a lot better. You I
find something new in it every day. |
Kverybody should know some
thing about this famous institution |
but I would suggest that you make
no personal investigations. I can j
tell yini how to get there, however,
it you insist.
rbe (lily of Palo Alto, a scat of ,
learning, sets a great store by its |
pedestrian shoppers and has posted i
the preserve as liberally as you j
eon Id hope. A bag .if a dozen mo
torists a day used to be allowed j
eacli pedestrian but now pickings;
are netting so lean it keeps the dicks [
very busy satisfying the demand. |
Bagged Out of Bounds
Ihe place is getting so badly j
hunted out that Officer Hen Mickey j
of the constable Hickeys of Palo'
Alto township had to go out to the
wilds of California avenue, a meas- I
iired mile and a half from the shop- !
ping district, to bring me down J
while I was furtively trying to sneak |
nsecn to mine host's house in a !
borrowed car.
\\ i! 11 motorist-hugging going on a |
mile and a half out in a town of
II,HIM) you can do some simple j
. rithmetic and see how San Fran
*'sco cops could arrest errant driv- I
(; s 10 miles out on a basis of t>oo,-•
• 00 population. Hut, of course, that j
would pue 'em 10 miles past Palo
Ho and I wouldn't put anything
past Palo Alto.
Hut back to the scene of the
rime. While yet a block from my
''est inat ion 1 saw this eminent
endarme, Mickey, emerge from a
lump of eucalyptus trees and flop
n bis bike. Although, he started in ]
o< direction, 1 assumed he was I
■ fter a band of snails that whistled 1
; ast me just as he flagged me down. !
Grabbed in Low Gear
He was just in time. In another |
. linute I'd have been in second I
ear.
Me said something about a 25- |
die zone, which seemed odd when j
here are supposed to he houses j
long a 25-mile zone, and then he j
avc me a pink invitation to visit !
Police .ludge John Springer per- i
: onally.
1 accepted the invitation and en- I
nintered more oddities. For in j
alo Alto they are so sure the game |
aniens are right they don't even |
ive you n trial. Hut they're very
' huiiimy and co-operative—so much
>. in tact, that Judge Springer, a
ood man weighing .'toil pounds,
often acts as clerk while his clerk i
cts as judge.
She's pretty good, too. She looked j
I my invitation, picked up a table i
<<l figures with some colored lines '
on it, ran her pencil over the tab- j
ilalions and came np with a *s'.
.lumber.
Internal Pleading
I hadn't said anything about |
pleading. I haven't yet. I guess you '
don't make pleas in Palo Alto.
Hut it's all for the best. You de- I
velop such Strang arms chopping
wood that you involuntarily give I
the steering wheel a sharp twist as
you near Palo Alto and go either
right or left toward civilization.
Anyway, in the absence of *5 Ii
look my 10 hours on the municipal ,
woodpile. If you are going down i
that way, I suggest you take the
Hayshore.
As for the woodpile, you get a
credit of 50 cents an hour for work- 1
i ng on it Tuesday and Thursdays.
The other four working days don't
count. And Sunday, of course, is
always a day of arrest.
It is a little known fact that polo,
a game of the ancient Persians, was
invented by Chinese women. Daily I
California.
