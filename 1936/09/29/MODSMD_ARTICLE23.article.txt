# PLAY PRODUCERS TO BE DEVELOPED BY LANGE
## 
### 
Plans for the new School of the !
| Theater, as announced yestei-day by j
1 Gordon C. Lange, recently appointed
| head of dramatics, include the build
ing up of a dramatic department
which will send away students with
| wide experience in all aspects of play
I production.
Departmental Duty
With the extensive new equipment i
which will be available with the I
completion of the New Theater, Mr.
Lange sees it as the function and
duty of the department that, no mat
ter what field of dramatic work stu
dents go into after graduation, they
will be well grounded.
Alhough a great many students
t on ly go out for dramatics "for the
' fun of it." Mr. Lange hopes to even
tually make them realize that the
: best entertainment is found in the
, best plays. Proof of this theory is
; seen in the record attendances at the
: Globe Theater Shakespeare Players
' at the Chicago and San Diego fairs.
University Productions
University theatrical productions
j will be different from commercial 1
| projects due to the fact that the cam
pus theater will be equipped for any j
I form of work. The danger of stu- '
| dents being spoiled by this equip
j ment will be combatted by giving
j varied training calling for ingenuity
j in the work.
j Students will be given an oppor
! tunity to gain experience and train
i ing of a practical nature in both i
j present-day and historical play pro- [
j duction. They will do historical i
; plays important as drama produced :
I from an entertainment point of view, j
Experimental Plays
j It will also be the responsibility j
j of the theater to produce experimen-
J tal plays, giving opportunity for cre-
I ative work on the part of students.
Mr. Lange believes that it is the
! duty of such dramatic schools as
| Stanford to also produce entirely
; new plays, thereby giving American
j drama a chance to grow out of its
| present state of stagnation.

The idea of attempting to raise
the level of audience criticism by
putting the responsibility of the
plays on the audience, may also be
experimented with by giving small
productions and inviting audiences
to attend, with the provision that
they write in a criticism of the work
following the performance.
The difficulty with this scheme,
according to Mr. Lange, is that the
audiences tend to criticize the au
thor rather than the play' itself.
However, he believes that people
coming to a play under such a con
dition,tend to be much more critical
than those who must pay at the
box office before attending.
Although he will not guarantee
their production, Mr. Lange is anx
ious to see any and all scripts of
plays, one-act or otherwise, and
written by students or faculty.
