# Theater Rises As Balcony Floor Is Set
## Completion of Building Prophesied for April As Work Progresses 
### 
Work on Stanford's new Memorial
Theater continued to forward this
week as the cement was poured to
form the floor of the balcony. With
girders and wooden framework al
ready completed, Comptroller Almon
K. Itoth predicts that the entire out
line of the building will he visible
lÂ»y the end of October.
Final touches will begin then, ;uul
completion of the building is fore
seen for April, when Stanford dra
matics will liud themselves with a
more complete background than
they have ever had.
The wooden framework, on which
the concrete is being poured for the
balcony, will be removed in sections
as soon as the concrete has settled.
Two aisles in the balcony will
provide an easy approach to seats,
and wide spaces between rows will
guarantee ample room.
Paving on the new street in front
of the theater is well under way.
More than the usual number of cars
will be accommodated because of
diagonal parking rules. The old
parking lot across from the Art <ial
lery will be covered by landscaping.
