# Revised Rushing Rules in Effect As Season Opens
## 
### 
As another year begins on the
Farm, the Mow tightens its belt in
preparation for a new and different
year of rushing.,
With anxious minds the bigwigs
In charge of fraternity affairs await
the result of latest attempt to void
the disagreeable rushing scandals
which seem to be a periodic occur
ence at Stanford.
Following the Sigma Chi affair of
last winter, when thai house was
deprived of its rushing privileges
for a year, the Interfraternity coun
cil spent many weeks endeavoring
to devise a system whereby it would
be impossible for any more similar
outbreaks to occur.
Whether the fault lay in the rush
ing rules themselves or in their ap
plication and enforcement was not
known by the council. Finally,
however, it was decided In central
ize the responsibility for illegal
rushing and also to give the Frosh
and Row a more extensive and bet
ter chance to associate with one an
other, by means of week-end rush
ing periods.
Code Signed
Regarding the enforcement of the
rules, an Interfraternity Honor
Code was drawn up, to he signed by
the respective house presidents in
which they pledged themselves to he
personally responsible for the con
duct of their house during rushing.
Men who were considering violation
of the rules would he deterred by
the knowledge that if their action
became known a personal stigma
and loss of presige would follow,
not or.J>y to themselves but to their
house president.
In having Friday and Saturday
rushing it is hoped that a much
more informal relationship will de
velop between the Row men and
Frosh, causing them to become bet
ter acquainted during the short
period and also perhaps eliminating
the necessity of a break in the Code.
Also there will he less interference
with studies, which has long been
a strong talking point with the
faculty.
