# He-Man Music, On Glee Programs for Year, Kendall
## 
### 
A he-man glee club, with tunes ,
styled for the collegian who wants !
to sing—that's the musical* outfit j
planned by Raymond Kendall, act- i
ing instructor in Music, and director !
of the Women's and Men's Glee
Clubs here.
"There'll be no lugues for us this j
year," he declared. And by fugue, I
Mr. Kendall doesn't mean the real;
thing by Bach, but such worn-out
musical war-horses as "Morning" by j
Olie Speaks, or "I Am the Builder" i
or the venerable "Invictus."
Such numbers went out with hob- !
ble skirts, he says, so Stanford's rep-
I ertory will be made up of live stuff,
j a pleasure to hear and a pleasure
j to sing.
College Songs
There'll be college songs, new and
vitalized arrangements of the clas- ;
I sics, and a training in popular songs j
| that will make both the Men's and 1
! Women's Glee Clubs available for
j campus musical shows. j -
"Glee clubs everywhere are sing- ! |
j ing better music tuciuy," Mr. Kendall ,
j explains. Good music is no longer j
• considered good merely because a I
| famous composer wrote it. Selec- j
| tions are based on merit, and on the | •
! favor of the singers themselves— , (
! who have changed in recent years (
almost as much as the tunes. I •
"Once upon a time, only sissies , j
would actually stand up and sing. |
And the stuff they selected was dead. (
Today, singing has become popular, j
i and people are finding pleasure in
; making their own mUsiC — people |
' who weigh 200 pounds, work out
1 on the football field, and look more
j massive than vocal." I
Abandon Women's Choral
| The big change in glee club ad- |

a spring tour of the Pacific Coast ! |
colleges and appearance with a sym- : |
i phony orchestra in San Francisco,
as well as appearances locally.
Tryoutee periods will be held
shortly, Mr. Kendall announces— I
| and he doesn't want soloists, but
j just garden variety singers particu
| larly, the people who tell you "I
! can't sing." "They're the ones who
j can," he's found.
