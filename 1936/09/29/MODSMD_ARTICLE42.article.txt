# Roble Sponsors Meet Frosh Women in Honor Parley
## 
### 
Throughout the country, whenever |
Stanford traditions mentioned,
the Honor Code system is the out
standing. In order to acquaint the
freshmen women with this feature j
of Stanford, and to make them real
ize its significance, sponsors at Roble |
met Saturday with the girls in their
corridors to explain it.
It was emphasized that the Honor j
Code does not only apply to aca- j
demic regulations, but to the social
rules as well. The sponsors tried to
impress upon the new women the j
importance of taking to heart the i
spirit of the Code.
"The right thing to do may not j
always be covered by the rules, j
However, it is assumed that when !
we get to college we know light
from wrong," explained Pauline
Stevens to her group.
Continuing, she said, "As Stanford I
women we should be proud of the j

Honor Code because of the fine
things it stands for."
One of Stanford's most prized pos- I
sessions, the Code, originated in |
1921. Prior to this time, the system j
had been used in examinations in !
the Law School. Here it proved to j
be so popular that the student body
in general petitioned for its adoption \
in the whole university. This was :
accomplished, and it has remained I
Stanford's heritage.
Besides these lights on the Code,
the regular information was given.
Signing the pledge on papers and j
examinations, abiding by the social j
regulations, intermissions during ex- t
ams, no smoking on the Quad, and
non - transference of student body
tickets for games were enlarged
upon.
The difficulties involved in report
ing violations were discussed, and
the tapping method was explained, j
Sponsors emphasized the importance !
of reporting violations, declaring
that talking to the offender and let
ting him know he was seen was the
best method, reporting being the last
resort.
After the sponsors' talks, the new
women were given the opportunity
to ask questions. Most of these ap- J
plied to the social regulations. Here j
are some typical questions and an
swers on the subject:
Question: "If two or more people
work together on a subject, is it a
violation of the Honor Code?"
Answer: "Ordinarily it would not >
be considered such; however, in dif

ferent departments there are differ
ent rules. The best idea is to find out
at the beginning how the professor
stands on the subject." J
Question: "Is the person who re
ports a violation subjected to any
publicity?"
Answer: "No, names are not re
vealed, and the violator has a fair
I chance to vindicate himself."
Question: "When you get a 'lock
in,' who sees that you stay in?"
Answer: "No one, you are entirely
governed by your conscience and the
! Honor Code."
Question: "In tapping to attract
j the attention of a suspicious person,
! isn't one apt to call attention to her-
I self?"
Answer: "Not ordinarily, and in
case it ever occurs in your classes,
j the courteous thing to do would be
' not to turn and stare at the tapper."

rules as well. The sponsors tried to
impress upon the new women the j
importance of taking to heart the i
spirit of the Code.
"The right thing to do may not j
always be covered by the rules, j
However, it is assumed that when !
we get to college we know light
from wrong," explained Pauline
Stevens to her group.
Continuing, she said, "As Stanford I
women we should be proud of the j

Honor Code because of the fine
things it stands for."
One of Stanford's most prized pos- I
sessions, the Code, originated in |
1921. Prior to this time, the system j
had been used in examinations in !
the Law School. Here it proved to j
be so popular that the student body
in general petitioned for its adoption \
in the whole university. This was :
accomplished, and it has remained I
Stanford's heritage.
Besides these lights on the Code,
the regular information was given.
Signing the pledge on papers and j
examinations, abiding by the social j
regulations, intermissions during ex- t
ams, no smoking on the Quad, and
non - transference of student body
tickets for games were enlarged
upon.
The difficulties involved in report
ing violations were discussed, and
the tapping method was explained, j
Sponsors emphasized the importance !
of reporting violations, declaring
that talking to the offender and let
ting him know he was seen was the
best method, reporting being the last
resort.
After the sponsors' talks, the new
women were given the opportunity
to ask questions. Most of these ap- J
plied to the social regulations. Here j
are some typical questions and an
swers on the subject:
Question: "If two or more people
work together on a subject, is it a
violation of the Honor Code?"
Answer: "Ordinarily it would not >
be considered such; however, in dif

ferent departments there are differ
ent rules. The best idea is to find out
at the beginning how the professor
stands on the subject." J
Question: "Is the person who re
ports a violation subjected to any
publicity?"
Answer: "No, names are not re
vealed, and the violator has a fair
I chance to vindicate himself."
Question: "When you get a 'lock
in,' who sees that you stay in?"
Answer: "No one, you are entirely
governed by your conscience and the
! Honor Code."
Question: "In tapping to attract
j the attention of a suspicious person,
! isn't one apt to call attention to her-
I self?"
Answer: "Not ordinarily, and in
case it ever occurs in your classes,
j the courteous thing to do would be
' not to turn and stare at the tapper."
Throughout the country, whenever |
Stanford traditions mentioned,
the Honor Code system is the out
standing. In order to acquaint the
freshmen women with this feature j
of Stanford, and to make them real
ize its significance, sponsors at Roble |
met Saturday with the girls in their
corridors to explain it.
