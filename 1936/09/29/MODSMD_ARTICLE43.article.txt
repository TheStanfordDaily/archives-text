\ BOSTON. Sept. 28 (/P).â€”The Mas
\ sachusetts ballot law commission
| dismissed today a protest filed
| against the candidacy of Henry
! Cabot Lodge, Jr., Republican nomi-
I nee for United States Senator.
Former Slate Auditor Alonzo B.
Cook, an independent candidate
for Senator, protested there was no
such person as "Henry Cabot Lodge,
jjr.," but Attorney General Paul A.
i Devcr said Cook's protest raised
"no adequate legal cause" to remove
Lodge's name from the ballot.
Cook contended Lodge, the grand
son of Henry Cabot Lodge, was the
son of George Cabot Lodge and
therefore could not legally use the
j suffix "junior."
