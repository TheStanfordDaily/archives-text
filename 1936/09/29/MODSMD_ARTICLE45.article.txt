Times are hard for the poopoopa- i
mark us. He is in charge of thinking [
up the pre-initiation abadaba to in- i
fliet on the pledges in the house. |
Now that rushing comes so soon, he I
won't have time to warm up his in
j't nuity before initiation is all over.
More than that, the Interfraternity
Ctjuricil has tossed hell week out for
good. Out-in-the-open stuff like 1
making the sophomores carry bed- j
room pillows to class and sit on them
is definitely blacklisted. At the same j
time, tha Council will have a hard j
time detecting whether the neophytes -
are forced to wear non-removable j
burlap underwear, except possibly ;
by observing the way the boys walk, j
It also will be hard to prevent the j
yearly revival of the classic fire drill, i
wherein the pledges pick up water ;
in their mouth and crawl down two j
or three flights of stairs to spit the
liquid on a fire constantly refueled
by upperclassmen.
Maybe the Council had the right
idea. Excess paddling is carrying the
Human holiday too far. Thf was
once a student at Washington whose
.spine was so injured by piling
that he had to sit on an inflated cush
ion the rest of his life. Not so long ;
ago there was a Stanford man who
was .so irked at being forced to stand
motionless all night on the baseball
field that he ran home to mamma, or
rather, to his aunt. He never came,
back to Jive in the house.
Ruling question nighl out, though, j
is no less than a dirty shame. The
worst part about it is that while the
more fiendish activities can still go
on by candlelight inside the house, |
the fraternity that sets its pledges to ;
chasing over the hills for female ■
bullfrogs is almost sure to be caught, j
And tagged.
Ihe moguls-that-be say quest
night destroys property. Perhaps so.
Countless pieces of out-of-date
plumbing have perished every Octo
ber, but who would call that any
thing but civilization on the advance? ;
The suspicion still lingers that Palo ;
Alio citizens who need a new fence I
wait for hell week before tearing it j
down. Then they send the bill to the !
University and the fraternities foot j
it.
Call it sentimentalism it you want.
Maybe we've seen too many college
movies. But no matter how your fin- i
gers got burned looking for dates by |
candlelight on the tombstones in the j
Menlo Cemetery, the armchair re- j
miniscing is more than enough com- 1
pensation.
Half of the fraternity legends are j
about the time somebody was set out
on the Bayshore Highway looking i
£or a signed hotel register and ended
np -pending the night at Agnew Hos
pital for the insane. Or about the ;
chap who was dumped off in the
Santa Cruz mountains miles from the j
seashore and told to bring back clam
shells and was picked up by a man 1
in a car who was just returning from
a clambake.
