# Schafer Calls for Speakers As Bureau Anticipates Big Season
## 
### 
Forecasting a big year for the
Stanford Speakers' Bureau, student
activity which supplies speakers to
near-by clubs and luncheon or
ganizations, Manager Chuck Scha
fer returned to the campus early
to plan the bureau's action for the
coming year.
Requests for speakers are already
pouring in, according to Schafer.
Need More Speakers
"Since only 10 of the original 20
speakers are returning," Schafer
told The Daily, "we have room on
the bureau's ground floor for as
many speakers as want to try out.
We want speeches on almost any
topic—speeches about foreign coun
tries by people who have lived or
traveled abroad, descriptions of ihe
drought area and present relief
measures, book reviews, play read
ings, human interest stories—any
thing goes."
To be placed on the list, talks
must first be approved by the fac
ulty adviser, yet to be chosen, and
then by the Speakers' Bureau Re
view Board, composed of Schafer,
Debate Manager Jim Hill, A.S.S.U.
President Jim Reynolds, the fac
ulty adviser, Mr. McKelvey, and
Women's Conference Appointee.
Deadline for hearing approved
speeches this quarter is October 20th.

Only ten other universities have
similar organizations, Schafer says.
J The bureau's activities give pub
licity to Stanford and practical ex
perience, as well as valuable con
tacts, to the speakers.
Already several talks have been
! scheduled for the coming quarter,
; and a prospectus has been sent to
! organizations throughout the Bay
| region.
Since most of the large San Fran
cisco service clubs will soon print
programs for the coming year, it is
important that interested students
prepare speeches as soon as possible.
Chuck Schafer wants to see old and
new speakers in his office in the Old
! Union immediately.
