### 
During the past km miner Ex-Prcsi- j
dent Herbert Hoover returned on a I
part-time basis to his profession of
mining engineering. He interspersed |
his political activities wiiii visits to
luimeroMS mines in the capacity of !
a technical advisor.
With his brother, Thcadore Jesse
Hoover, Dean-Emeritus of the Shin- j
ford School of Engineering, he in- â– 
speeded the Sim Idria quicksilver i
mine in the Gahihm Mountains east
of Salinas. Following this visit,
Theodore Jesse Hoover purchased
an interest in the mine. This mine's |
output would be valuable to muni- j
tion manufacturers in a future war. j
National publicity was given Mr. j
Hoover's trip to Nevada's Jumbo j
Mine, the largest American gold
strike of the decade. He visited the
Jumbo Mine the latter part of An-j
gust with 11. W. Hanns, San Fran
cisco oilman, "purely out of geo- |
logical curiosity."
The Ex-President's advice to I
George Austin, owner of the mine, j
was to hold on to it and to turn j
down all purchase offers. Mr. I
Hoover refused payment for his ad- \
vice, stating "That kind of advice is

free." Oilman Hanna bought live
claims around Jumbo*
Mr. Mark llcqua, former Cali
fornia National Republican Commit
teeman, reported, following Mr.
Hoover's inspection of his mine at
Mountain City, Nevada, that the
former president was in the market
for a "good" mine. He stated that
Mr. Hoover planned to return act
ively lo mining engineering if lie
could purchase a promising mine.
