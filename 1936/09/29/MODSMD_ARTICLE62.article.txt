# Dr. Hansen Perfects Super X-Ray Device, 5 Million Volt Germ Killer
## Medicine, Physics, Radio May Use 'Gadget' 
### 
A machine that opens new hori- J
eons to the scientist, promising revo
lutionary changes in curative medi
cine, higher physics, and ordinary
radio transmission, has been per
fected by Dr. William Hansen, young
assistant professor of physics here.
To the unpracticed eye, the ma
chine is just a gadget of copper. To
Stanford's physicists, for whom
modern miracles are everyday
things, it's just a "washtub," or
"Hansen's gadget." But to the sci- j
entific world, the machine is one of
the greatest sources of energy in j
the world, even in small form pro- i
viding power of at least 5,000,000
volts. It can furnish the strongest i
X-rays in the world.
Already, four possible uses have !
been found for the machine, and
those remaining undiscovered may
be limitless, physicists declare.
No bigger than an ordinary wash
tub, so simple that it amazes those 1
who have sought for similar sources
of energy with massive machines, it
solves one of the television engi
neer's main problems by providing |
ultra-short radio waves of tremen
dous strength. To scientists, its abil- ,
ity to produce X-rays creates a new
arsenal of bullets to bombard the I
atom and break it down. For phy
sicians, it produces an artificial lea
ver to treat human diseases.
The inspiration for the Rhuma
tron, as the machine is officially
named, came to Dr. Hansen a little
over one year ago, he revealed. He
worked for months on paper, figur- j
ing every detail before he built his
first model. Last spring his dreams
became real.
His colleagues saw a copper cyl
inder, covered at both ends. Inside j
i' was the invisible miracle —a radio I
wave that bounced between the top
and bottom. It's almost as simple as
a ball bouncing between two sur
faces, except that the radio wave '
gains in energy where the ball I
would lose. The increase is the j
result of the action of a radio tube i
inside the cylinder, activated by high |
voltage lines. When the radio wave ;
has bounced several times, it is
ready to be tapped and applied—to
a radio antenna for broadcasting, or |
perhaps left inside the machine to ,
manufacture artificial fever, or to i
speed up an atom to produce amaz- '
ingly high voltages.
Whether his machine could be
used to cure cancer, Dr. Hansen
was unable to say. Its curative |
powers, he believes, may be limited i
to the fever-producing function. In !
that case, the Rhuma-tron would be
enlarged to the size of the room, and
the organism to be cured placed in- j
side it. Body temperature would rise i
as a result of the passage of the j
radio waves, building a fever high
enough to kill germs inhabiting the j
body. I
While the Rhuma-tron would sur
pass in many respects other X-ray
producing machines, it does not
compete with the cyclotron devel
oped several years ago at the Uni
versity of California for atomic dis
integration. 'Hansen's Gadget"
hurls electrons, the U.C. device —the
nucleus of heavy hydrogen.
The main immediate application of |
the Rhuma-tron is to the field of
television and radio, preliminary
tests indicating that it will fill a need
long felt by radio engineers. Medi
cal use of the device will be post
poned pending further investiga
tions.
Stanford authorities plan con
struction of a deep tunnel on the
campus with at least ten feet of soil
between the deadly rays of the
apparatus and human contact.
