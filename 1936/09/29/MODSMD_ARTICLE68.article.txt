# Modern Men Are Religious, Says Chaplain
## Successor to Dr. Gardner Defends Attitude 
### 
Average university students of to
, day, although they consider them
-1 selves irreligious and think they
have no time for theologians or
priests, have in reality a deeply re
ligious attitude toward life, accord
j ing to Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Uni
; versity chaplain.
Dr. Trueblood assumed his duties
i as successor to Dr. David Charles
Gardner in June. The new chap
lain is a member of the Society of
Friends, and has recently been pro
fessor of philosophy and the phi- !
losophy of religion at Haverford Col
lege, Pennsylvania.
After receiving an A.B. degree
from Penn College, lowa, he was
graduated from the Harvard Divin
ity School in 1927. He later received
a Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins
| University.
Vesper Services Initiated
! During the summer Dr. True
i blood's sermons were in the light of
j a series of discussions of "Religious
I Realism." His thesis is that strong
religion is concerned with what God
demands of men, rather than what
their faith will do for them. Much
| current religion, he holds, is weak
J because men seek personal gain
! from it.
In conjunction with Warren D.
Allen, University organist, he inau
j gurated a series of Sunday evening !
j Vesper Services. The usual organ '
recital was extended to include read
' ir.gs and prayers. These services
will probably be continued this fall.
Plans Revealed ,
In commenting on his work here
Dr. Trueblood said. "The acids of
modernity and of sophistication have
j eaten away from most minds the last
remnants of a merely superstitious
| faith and it often seems that nothing
is left. My experience with univer
sity students indicates to me that
something of great importance re
mains."
The worst enemy of real religion
is the supposition that religion is
something separated from life. Dr.
Trueblood believes that there is a
great deal which goes on in Ihe
world which has about it a religious
_ quality, though it has absolutely no
i connection with churches, scriptures,
or stated periods of worship.
Chapel Is Neutral Ground
The chaplain expressed the hope
that the various organizations on the
campus, including the denomina
tional clubs, will all join in a single

program. Since the Memorial Church
is neutral ground denominationally,
there is no reason why all groups
should hesitate to unite in it. The
Vestry will be used as a lobby and
reading room, as well as a confer
ence room for all who care to use it.
Small groups who have no other
place to meet should feel free to
make use of the facilities thus af
forded.
Dr. Trueblood preached the Ma
triculation sermon Sunday in con
nection with the Freshman Registra
tion program.

In commenting on his work here
Dr. Trueblood said. "The acids of
modernity and of sophistication have
j eaten away from most minds the last
remnants of a merely superstitious
| faith and it often seems that nothing
is left. My experience with univer
sity students indicates to me that
something of great importance re
mains."
The worst enemy of real religion
is the supposition that religion is
something separated from life. Dr.
Trueblood believes that there is a
great deal which goes on in Ihe
world which has about it a religious
_ quality, though it has absolutely no
i connection with churches, scriptures,
or stated periods of worship.
Chapel Is Neutral Ground
The chaplain expressed the hope
that the various organizations on the
campus, including the denomina
tional clubs, will all join in a single

program. Since the Memorial Church
is neutral ground denominationally,
there is no reason why all groups
should hesitate to unite in it. The
Vestry will be used as a lobby and
reading room, as well as a confer
ence room for all who care to use it.
Small groups who have no other
place to meet should feel free to
make use of the facilities thus af
forded.
Dr. Trueblood preached the Ma
triculation sermon Sunday in con
nection with the Freshman Registra
tion program.
Average university students of to
, day, although they consider them
-1 selves irreligious and think they
have no time for theologians or
priests, have in reality a deeply re
ligious attitude toward life, accord

; versity chaplain.
Dr. Trueblood assumed his duties
i as successor to Dr. David Charles
Gardner in June. The new chap
lain is a member of the Society of
Friends, and has recently been pro
fessor of philosophy and the phi- !
losophy of religion at Haverford Col
lege, Pennsylvania.
After receiving an A.B. degree
from Penn College, lowa, he was
graduated from the Harvard Divin

i blood's sermons were in the light of
j a series of discussions of "Religious

religion is concerned with what God
demands of men, rather than what
their faith will do for them. Much
