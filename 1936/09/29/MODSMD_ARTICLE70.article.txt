# Tentative Plan For Theater School Made
## Dramatic Workshop Class To Stage Regular Plays With Student Direction 
### Sue Hammond 
Plans for the schedule of produc
tion for the new theater are still
fomewhat uncertain owing to the
indefinite .status of the present Dra
matic Council. However, a tentative
policy of the School of the Theater
has been formulated.
'I his proposes the staging of a
major production each quarter, with
probably more than one perfor
mance. In addition to this there will
be regular weekly or bi-weekly pro
ductions staged by the class in dra
matic workshop, which will be di
rected by students under the super
vision of a faculty adviser, or a
graduate student adviser who will
in turn work under Dr. Gordon
Lange, head of the department.
The distinction between the aca
demic workshop productions and the
regular quarterly presentations is
that the latter will be open to the
students at large.
It has not as yet been determined
whether the major productions will
be .sponsored by Dramatic Council
and the student body, or by the
University administration.
Various plans have been proposed
to take care of musical shows pro
duced each quarter entirely by stu
dent organizations, a continuation of
thi present custom of Barnstormers
and Ram's Head.
Dr. Lange plans to outline a year's
balanced program in advance, blend
ing both the policies of major and
workshop productions, so that plays
of all types may be worked together
for variety and practical experience.
These will include modern comedy
and drama, classical tregedies, cos
time, and experimental plays.
The policy with regard to play
readings will have to be worked out
to lit in with the program of work
shop productions. Readings in the
last five years have been fulfilling
the function which will now be
taken over by workshop productions.
These, however, will not be discon
tinued, but will be given in addi
tion to workshop presentations.
