# Natural Amphitheater Fast Taking Form as Part of Art Center
## 
### 
When the gift of $35,000 and car
i loads of free earth were given to the
University last March, Comptroller
Almon E. Roth saw a long-sup
-1 pressed desire materializing, namely, !
! a "natural" amphitheater for the
! University.
Today that amphitheater is fast
| taking form between Lasuen md
Galvez streets. Back to back with
the new Memorial Theater, it will be
in the center of the proposed art
center.
The amphitheater will seat ap-
I proximately 7500 persons, but it can
be made to accommodate more if
necessary. There will be nothing to
j suggest that it is a man-made proj
l ect, the stage and bowl being sodded
j and naturally irregular.
It will be used for graduation ex
ercises, outdoor plays and concerts.
Memorial Theater dressing rooms
will be easily accessible from the
1 stage of the amphitheater, while the
trees clustering around the bowl will
cut off the view of campus buildings.
