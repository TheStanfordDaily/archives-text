# Students Give Building Funds
## 
### 
Novel among the features in the
j history of Stanford's new theater
unit is the fact that construction has
been financed almost entirely by
I student funds, according to Comp
-1 troller Almon E. Roth.
Both directly and indirectly, stu
dents have contributed, and will
continue to contribute until 1957, to
the $587,000 .sum. On that date, it
is estimated, a loan from the Uni
! versity Board of Trustees will have
been repaid with full interest. '
Approximately $186,000 was se- ]
cured immediately after the close of j
the war by the original Memorial
i Fund Committee, which sought to I
raise a symbol of tribute on the j
campus to Stanford men who died
in service overseas.
Waited for Money
With the proposal in mind to erect j
a theater, however, officials decided
to hold and build the fund until it
was suflficierttly large to permit con
struction of a building according to
the present plans.
Five years ago the fund was i
swelled by $2,000, the result of con
tributions obtained through an edi- j
torial campaign in Chaparral. At j
present, 75 per cent of all Union I
prots are turned over to theater j
finances together with $1 per quar
ter from each student.
20 Years to Pay
Four per cent interest is being paid
to the Board of Trustees on a loan
granted to permit start of construc
tion hist fall. The dollar from each \
student will clear the principal and
interest in approximately 20 years,
Roth said.
A gift of $.'55,000 from Howard
Frost of Los Angeles as a memorial
to his son, John Lawrence Frost,
has also been received.
