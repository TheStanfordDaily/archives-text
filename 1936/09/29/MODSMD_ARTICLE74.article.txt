A revolution may be going on
over in Spain, but that's noth
ing compaied to what has been
going on inside the Daily shack
since the first of September.
First came a notice to the
Edit Board from the Univer
sity Press th,at they were buy
ing a new Linotype, and
wanted us to select some new
headline type to go with it. So,
for the second time in two
years, The Daily undergoes a
facial, appearing today for the
first time with copnplete Bo
doni make-up. in line with cur
rent trends in newspaper dress.
Continuing an age-old tradi
tion, The Daily sticks its nose
out, but this time it's a 10-foot
addition, which brings the
shack $1400 worth out toward
the street. Included in the im
provements is the new, up-to
date dark room for The Daily's
increasing pictur ecoverage,
added room for the editorial
staff, and office-space for the
business staff, which pays for
all 'this.
For one month, and one
month only, The Daily has the
world - wide news - coverage
services of both Associated
Press and United Press. In or
der to get the fullest and most
timely service possible for out
side news, a special, new 30-
minute telephoij:: "pony" is
being put in. After 30 days,
The Daily will continue with a
coverage service that seems to
best fit The Daily's peculiar
tastes
