Farm building, Comptroller Almon
E. Roth last January revealed that
the Memorial Theater and the Am
phitheater are to be part of a pro
posed five-building art center.
The present Art Gallery is one
member of this group. Plans call for
the construction of a Graphic Arts
and a Music Building on either side
of t!ie new theater. The Memorial
Theater will make possible a Stan
ford school of drama. As a result
control of dramatics would probably
be transferred from the Ex Com
mittee to the University adminis
tration.
