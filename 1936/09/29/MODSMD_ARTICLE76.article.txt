# Dual Control Fixes Lights
## 
### 
Only lighting control unit of its
kind in the West, the New Theater
will have only the best, with its
dual control console.
No encumbering switches and
rheostats will be needed, "Playing"
on a control board smaller than the
console of an organ, the operator
will be master of all lights in the
house, and also of lights in the ad
joining Little Theater.
He will merely "plug in" the lights
he wants to regulate, much as the
operator "plugs in" a telephone call,
and then produce the effects he
wants by turning little knobs like
radio control dials.
A similar control board will be
installed in the projection booth of
the Little Theater, with the capacity
to regulate the lights in either of the
two theaers.
Sage Width Variable
An unusual width of 40 feet will
be provided for the stage opening in
the main auditorium, and a height
of 30 feet. Adjustable width will
be provided by adding tower - like
"tormentors" which will move the
apparent sides of the stage opening
tc/ward the center. Lighting equip
ment will slide in with the torment
ors, thus producing a narrowed stage
in every respect.
The stage tower will be 65 feet
high, allowing full - height 30 - foot
drops to be drawn completely out of
sight.
Moving Scenery
Wings with 22 feet width on each
side and a stage depth of 50 feet will
allow use of set "wagons" in addi
tion to drops for moving and con
trolling scenery.
With the large available floor
area of the stage these wagons can
be set up with all the scenery on
them before the performance, and
then sets can be changed by merely
rolling the wagons around.
