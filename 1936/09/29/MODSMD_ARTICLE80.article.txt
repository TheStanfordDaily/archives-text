## 
### 
Lagunita Court's two new wings, \
to be finished by this time next fall,
will positively replace The Oaks, off
campus dormitory for women, Miss
Anastasia Doyle, Lagunita director,
stated yesterday.
The new wings will house approx
imately 40 women each, and will
be located at a right angle to the
two rear casas, Magnolia and Euca
lipto. The number of residents has
been limited in order not to strain j
the kitchen facilities and crowd the !
dining-room.
Construction of ihe wings will be
begun before the concrete mixers
now in use at the new theater have
been removed. After the concrete is
poured the rest of the construction
will be allowed to wait until after '
the rainy season is over. Each wing, |
besides containing bedrooms for the j
women, will have some sort of recre- i
ation room.
Due tp an increase in construction
: costs, the new wings will be slightly

more expensive to build than the
previous casas. However, the cost
per room, $2500, will remain apprax
imately the samo, since the addi
tional expense of social rooms, din
ing-rooms, and kitchen has already
been met.
