# The 						Bedbug Letter

### 
Dear Brovvney:
You are now v/orking on the Santa Paula
Chronicle, and may never read this. You prob
ably won't be interested if you do. In your fare
well Dear Jorgi edit you mentioned that these
edits are largely garbage and never should be
left uncovered.
Yet you wrote yours, and I shall write mine.
We write them, knowing what tripe they are
because we are college editors, and college
editors are a sentimental class. W believe that
people read edits. We believe that our edits are
worth the several columns of the page that we
devote to them. And because we are romantics,
we address these valedictory words to the out
going chief, not really to heap the sweet-smell
ing garbage on our predecessor, but in the hopes
that we will be unlike other college editors and
accidentally hit upon some program of action
for the rest of our volume.
Let's get it over with quickâ€”Browney, you
put out a good volume. But that isn't what I
v want to thank you for. I want to thank you for
burning over to this highly inefficient, muddle
headed romantic smooth-running, hard-working
staff.
Smooth-running and hard-working staffs are
not gifts from heaven but gifts from editors who
know their business. You did.
Now about this program of action: In The
Daily files are many of these hail and farewell
pieces, prophesying or concluding successful
attacks upon the Union, the Bookstore, the Ad
ministration, the boomlay-boomlay-boom steam
radiators in the Libe, and ants in Encina. The
attacks were successful, I presume, because it is
a Daily editorial axiom that conflict arouses in
terest. I suppose that these various attacks did
arouse the students to a white-heat, and thus
served their purpose. At a late hour last night,
however, Union and Bookstpre prices remained
as high as their monopoly position economic
ally permitted without a minor revolution; the
Administration conclusively has proven that it
knows mere about its business than a half
baked undergraduated, who must, perforce,
spend most of his day making out requisitions
for three-cent stamps, the radiators boom in
stentorian tones, and Encina is still an ant-hill.
I suppose, though, thai tnere is a certain func
tion of a campus paper to be a gadfly to the
many plush-lined bureaucrats that must of ne
cessity paper the walls of campus offices. I
have heard that the price of Union coffee fell
from ten cents to five cents, that the Union will
cash checks of five dollars instead of two, be
cause of Daily edits. I have also heard it whis
pered, that certain administrators admitted that
one Daily campaign last spring was a good
thing, but that they couldn't accede to it, be
cause it v/ould set a precedent of yielding to
The Daily. And the same social and economic
forces that gave rise to ten cent coffee and
two dollar checks remain, modified only in the
sporadic instances. I do not want to spend my
young life, Browney, in battling economic and
social forces, not even for reader interest. If
The Daily has a certain nuisance value in reduc
ing isolated inconsistencies, it probably will
continue its functions as a nuisance, depending
on how my dyspepsia is.
The temper of the times, if it is anything but
ill-tempered, is not propitious for reform or up
lift, as cynical as this may sound. Somewhere
along the line, in Cit or History, we learned
about a disintegrating society. In a world full
of hate and unrest, realizing that no matter
which way we swing, the individual is bound to
suffer, wo find our universities are still educat
ing the pretty boys for a society of the easy
going Twenties. Call it Taylorization or Sta
kanovism or what you will, there still is going
to be a speed-up. Somewhere, somehow, some
body is going to have to do some thinking. If
college students aren't going to do it, and there
is no indication now that they are, then who is?
The Daily won't, I'm sure. We're too busy

over here making out requisitions for three-cent
stamps.
As ever,
Jorgi.
