# People Do Not Read Long Edits
## 
### 
This is bad journalism. Because it is bad jour
nalism to write long edits; people do not read
long edits. It may be due to the notion that
editors write themselves out the second
paragraph and have nothing to say, or it may
be due to the fact that people do not read long
edits. Nevertheless there is something that
should be said and it should be said today.
This is: if student government has never
justified itself at Stanford, it justified itself over
the week - end. The Pre - reg idea was first
broached by students, and carried on by a stu
dent committee in the face of opposition from
some faculty members.
To many students belongs credit, but right
now, Chick Franich, Jim Reynolds, Mary Craig,
Esther Pelton, and Dean Peirose should be
mentioned for the sincerity and the enthusiasm
with which they brought an idealistic concep
tion to a practical conclusion, and they should
be mentioned today, even if people do not read
long edits.
