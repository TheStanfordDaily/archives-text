The most important question before the nation at
this time is not "Who's there?" but "How arc things
shaping up?"
The answer, of course, is "Yes."
For the new (and slightly used) women are terrific,
and the nine women's wrest homes up the Row already
have received telephonic communication from gentle
man friends, sponsors, lady friends, sponsors, hashers,
and friends, that "There are some 14 Kash and Karat
nuggets wandering loose over here at the old bastile,
and you can get a good class if A1 Roth doesn't pledge
them Lagunita."

Greek houses that weren't being occupied by car
penters and painters this summer, rented out their
sumptuous mansions to families who come to the quiet
summer quarter to see darling star in the summer
jlays, or just to listen to papa's heart tremor. One
such group inhabited the Pi Phi retreat, and reported to
one of my H-men that they spent a good deal of time
chasing rats. The H-man commented, though, that
this was nothing compared to the rats the Pi Phi's
chase at their jolly-ups.

Just to counteract this, I should make up some nasty
swipe at the Kappas, but the Kappas never pursue the
elusive stag, or rush illegally, or do anything such as
that. A Kappa told me this herself.
