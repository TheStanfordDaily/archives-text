# What They Thought About It All

### JANET GOULD, '40 BOB SPEIDEL, '40 FRANCES SLATER, '40 
In order to get the freshman's attitude toward the
Pre-registration Period, The Daily asked two fresh
man journalists who happened to drop in on the
Shack to write up their impressions of it. We are
happy to print below the following conflicting ac
counts:

In spite of three days of fact-cramming, the incom
ing Lower Division students were left with relatively
little knowledge of campus customs and many of their
questions unanswered.
According to freshmen the days provided by the
new plan were most valuable for getting settled in the
living groups and the amount of information gleaned
about Stanford traditions and activities depended upon
the sponsors' knowledge. The barbecue was the most
popular feature, with the Jolly-up second and the wel
coming assembly, tour, and talks by campus leaders
along the line.
A general cross-section of the information gathered
during the period included explanations of the Honor
Code and its violations, the arrangement of class
rooms, living group regulations, that one gets from
Stanford what one puts into it and that it is a very
democratic University. On the tours to traditional
spots the freshmen saw the Library, Quad, Unoin, the
largest dormitories, the Museum, and the Art Gallery.
All usable information came from the sponsors and,
in some cases, the advisers, was the average opinion.
On the other hand, the freshmen wanted to know:
When and where they could smoke, how much money
should be allowed for incidental expense.',, how to get
football tickets, to what the student body card entitles
them, what materials arc necessary besides class-books,
the position of the law steps and Thurlow's in town,
when mail comes to the post office, and—most-asked of
all—to what affairs a person may go without a date.

Name's Goodrich, Joe Goodrich. Anything I can do,
Phil? Glad to help! By the first day of the pre-rcgis
tration period, even the freshest of the freshmen is
impressed by the spirited and friendly atmosphere of
democracy that is so prevalent on the Stanford campus,
the firm Stanford handclasp and the willingness of
uppcrclassmen to help new arrivals become orientated.
Pre-regislration tends to make the freshman and
student transferring from another school feel that
Stanford is not just another university, that Stanford
is superior, and that it has a definite purpose and in
terest in guiding the pursuits of its students toward the
most constructive objectives. He feels that Stanford is
sincerely interested in his welfare in making the most
of his collcge years. However, during these first few
days before classes take him into the land of the
midnight oil, he has time to realize that his accom
plishments at Stanford are subject to his own ambi
tions and continuity of purpose. He is made to realize
that rewards will not be handed to him.

Well, the first thing I noticed when I arrived here
was the architecture. The roof-tiling is definitely early
Spanish, the porticos have a sneaking suspicion of
Byzantine, the archways arc neo-Gothic, the dorm is
kinda Colonial, and I could absolutely swear that I
caught sight of a Corinthian pillar here and there. I
think it was too sweet of them to be so democratic,
don't you? And the whole effect is os dern pretty.
There is the nicest fellow here who talked to all us
kids and told us to make ourselves right at home. His
name is Mr. Fritter or something and he is a coach.
Then Mrs. Diekema, the nice director, talked to us
all, and I liternllv felt myself budding into fine, younir
womanhood. . .
