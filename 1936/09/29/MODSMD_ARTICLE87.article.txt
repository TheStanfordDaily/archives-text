WIN STEAD WEAVER'S BACK! j
Good news io every past Gaieties- j
attender, it is of even more signifi- I
cance to frosh, for it means that still
another Stanford generation will be j
privileged to witness the antics of i
one of the craziest zanies ever to j
trod the Assembly Hall's protesting
boards.
A true screw-ball, with a wit as
bizarre as it is funny, Weaver will j
set you chortling and cheering the !
first time you see him, and you 11 be
a Weaver fan for life. No matter,
what the quality of this year's Gaie
ties, Weaver will make 'em worth
while.
NEWS OF STANFORDITES: Ex
gridster Don Colvin started a new
series of nightly sportscasts on KSFO
at 6:30 last night. Bob Dwan has
been appointed assistant to Night
Program Superintendent Dick El- ,
lers of NBC. Frank Barton, for
merly with Carl Ravazza's band, is
taking Dwan's place as an NBC an- \
nouncer.
ERRATA: Because a dumb lino
type operator mistook the proof no
tation, "u.c." for U. of C., when it
really means upper case, you pos
sibly wondered just what "U. of C. |
Spots" I was talking about last Fri- i
day. It should have been, "Dance
Spots," and included mention of Ellis i
Kimball's swing band at Topsy's
Roost, at the Beach.
