To campus hotbloods freedom's,
winds have long been a touchy issue. I
But they still rustle in certain
spheres. Shaw and Schonberg are
explained, praised or damned by au
thorities. I have even heard a pro
fessor deliver a long, though unspar- ;
ing speech on the god Gable.
There is no dearth of criticism at ,
Stanford.
The Reviewer's subject matter will
include campus, occasional Palo Alto
and San Francisco theatrical pro
ductions, music, books, moving pic
tures. Comment is entirely personal,
is in no way intended to concur with
the small minority or the mass. Since
evasiveness suggests indecision and, i
I even more odiously, ignorance. I
shall labor to be forthright. Also at
some risk.
THE SUMMER SEASON. I.
Hollywood and British-Gaumont
produced no masterpieces, several ,
worthy films, mnay more mcdiocri- i
| ties.
Frederick March eclipsed other
players in work intensity by appear
ing simultaneously in three much
heralded productions—"Mary Queen
of Scots,'' "Anthony Adverse," and
"The Road to Glory." Of the three
his listless characterization of the
dynamo - hero of Hervey Allen's
monster-piece was the weakest. As
Bothwell, the man of action, he re
vived considerable, as the lieutenant'
of the last film gave his finest per
formance in several seasons.
"Nine Days a Queen" I did not tee.
If "Mary Queen of Scots" arouses
historians' ire, it is not Hollywood
but Maxwell Anderson who must
answer. Vanity dominates hnrd
headedness in Florence Eldredge's
interpretation of Elizabeth. As for
Mary, she is absolved from all blamo
in the murder of Darnley. Katharine
Hepburn's selfishness is subdued,
lurks still. Photography, in the scaf
fold and court scenes, increases the'
picture's merits.
Important for its effective musical
score, photography, as well as its sig
nificance as propaganda was govern
ment-sponsored The Plow that
Rrbkc the Plains. A man-wrought
tragedy of fertile prairies turned to
drought-land is portrayed here. That
the film was made to create sym
pathy for the Resettlement Adminis
tration makes it no less valid as art.

One of the summer's finest bits of
acting occurred in an otherwise ba- j
nal picture, "The Gorgeous Hussy." i
Buelah Bondi made of Andrew Jack
son's pipe-smoking backwoods wife, i
Sarah, a pathetic figure.
"Swing Time," another Astaire-
Rogers musical, and English-made
"It's Love Again" continued the mu
sical dancing comedy tradition.

the embodiment of the ideal little'
girl, Irvin S. Cobb to drawl com
fortable platitudes, with rather less.

produced no masterpieces, several ,
worthy films, mnay more mcdiocri- i

If "Mary Queen of Scots" arouses
historians' ire, it is not Hollywood
but Maxwell Anderson who must
answer. Vanity dominates hnrd
headedness in Florence Eldredge's
interpretation of Elizabeth. As for
Mary, she is absolved from all blamo

picture's merits.

score, photography, as well as its sig

Rrbkc the Plains. A man-wrought
tragedy of fertile prairies turned to
drought-land is portrayed here. That
the film was made to create sym
pathy for the Resettlement Adminis
tration makes it no less valid as art.
