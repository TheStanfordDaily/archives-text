PLEASE SAY PLEASE I
As identifying as a Boston Bull's'
bow-legs are a Stanford man's good '
manners. Scion of a family in Amer- ,
ica's upper four per cent, he not only
blows his nose exclusively in his
handkerchief and eats with his
mouth closed, but cushions his climb
through society with pleasant airs.
His mama has drilled him to say
| "please," "thank you," and "pardon
me" for so many years that these
| oral courtesies are reflex: as auto
| matic as his inhibition against teeth
| picking at a faculty dinner (regard
| less of steak-gristle).
His good manners are similar to
those practiced by successful con
j cerns. A Stanford man may suspect
somebody is a dastard, but he doesn't
say so to the suspectees' face. In like
1 manner, • a business concern may ]
have good reason to believe a custo- 1
mer's credit rating is triple D, but 1
1 the customer doesn't get the glass j
eye. Instead, the business man :
plumps for a sale, and after a check |
up might even ease payments dan- J
gerously close to the profit margin. |
When payment is made he appears I
highly honored, bows the customer
out of the store, and says "thank
you!"
What we are sneaking up on is the
j business of buying an education at I
Stanford Inc., the old intellectual'
general store down Palo Alto way.
Today, its custumors will follow (
; instructions first and ask questions !
; afterward on a sign reading "make |
all checks payable to Stanford Uni
versity." Not a "please" anywhere.
Nor even a "thank you." And, by j
| Harry, if you don't make checks

payable today, you're socked just
two dollars more tomorrow. And, by
Harry, we won't take post-dated
checks.
Such regulations are office routine.
But our point is: they don't have to
be hollered from every corner of the
ad building. They would be just as
effective if whispered through a
businessman's smile of regret, per
haps preceedcd by a sympathetic
"we're very sorry, but . . .
Of course, everyone realizes that
the University must collect. Most of
us even realize we are getting a ter
rific bargain from Stanford Inc. But
it simply isn't good business for
Stanford Inc., to tell us so, and as
sume we're so anxious to buy they
need merely snap their fingers for
the money. Nor is it good business,
after so snapping, to take your $115
as if it were a bum nickel, or make
sizeable syllabus fees payable within
a three-day period, my boy, or else!
There are few ordinary businesses
that could survive a year with such
a customer-policy. People simply
would not accept the inference that
they are wild to buy, besides being
irresponsible. Nor would they stand
for the attitude expressable as: "You
ought to be glad we take your $115
checks, you bad risks, you!"
Not that some of us aren't bad
risks, you understand. Simply that
we object being so called.
So we suggest, as long as the Uni
versity wants to appear as a mer
chandiser, that it hire a stooge whose
business would be liberally sprink
ling all University demands for pay
ment with "pleases" and thankyous,"
which would make them requests.
Then, when the alumni association
pleads for endowments 20 years
hence, we won't get paralysis of the
index finger when we start to "make
checks payable."
