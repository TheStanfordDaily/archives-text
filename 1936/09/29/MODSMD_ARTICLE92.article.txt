# Broncos Down Cards 13-0 In Opening Game
## 'Gorilla' Gomez Conducts First Tour to Stanford Goal Line Personally 
### Tim Sullivan 
As 2500 saddened sons of the
Stanford Red watched their goal
posts splinter into sawdust last Sat
urday, there came the realization
that the palmy days of Indian foot
ball are at an end. The Bronco had
emblazoned a 13-0 footprint on the
Redskin grid record, and in sixty
short minutes Tiny's pupils found
themselves relegated from the head
to the foot of the class.
Santa Clara struck twice, each
time with a deadly thrust that sunk
deep into the Stanford end zone.
Starting from the Card 25, early in
the second quarter, the Broncs soon
shoved forward to the 20-yard stripe
from where "Gorilla" Gomez es
caped to the eight-yard line, finally
being caged by Vigna and Callaway.
Then the same little Spaniard
plucked a touchdown pass out of the
ozone.
Comeback Balked
Coming back to regain their lost
laurels in the second half, Stanford's
eleven battled their foes to a stand
still throughout the third quarter
only to make a costly mistake dur
ing the fourth period. Glenn Ham
ilton's pass committed the unpar
donable sin of flying into the arms
of Buck Shaw's boy Gilbert, who
after running .to the Indian 25,
slipped the ball to his team-mate
Barlow. The pill finally was laid to
rest on the eight-yard marker from
where Barlow sneaked around left
end to a score despite being par
tially halted by "Doc" Luckett two
yards from home. Falaschi's try for
point was true this time.
Late in the game the Red machine
rolled for a moment as in days gone
by. Jack Brigham, Card fullback,
passed 8 yards to Jack Clark who
lell on the 50. After a couple of
fruitless pot shots at the line, Brig
ham dropped back and fired another
one at Clark who caught the oval
en route to the Santa Claran's \7
where he was stopped.
Vigna's Disappointment
On the first play Joe Vigna broke
into the clear in the immediate vi
cinity of the goal line, where he anx
iously awaited Mr. Brigham's aerial
fling. However, the winds of des
tiny swept the Brigham pass a yard i
to the left of "little Joe." That play .
marked the pinnacle of Stanford's !
scoring aspirations. Luckett was i
smothered by six savage Santa Clar- 1
ans; Jake Brigham wafted an in- j
complete pass over the goal; and it '
was all over—except the mournful ;
chanting of the hymn and the more j
jubilant demolition of the last wood- '
en goal posts in California by a i
swarm of inspired SC undergrads.
Thirteen to nothing—and where j
does that leave Stanford at the pres- j
ent writing? Not in such a sour 1
state of mind as the score might :
indicate. There was something akin
to a revival spirit in the locker room |
after the game. For the first time the
boys realized that they could no |
longer rely on the mythical vowing i
sophs for support, a consciousness j
that they must fashion their own
fate came suddenly to all of them. !
