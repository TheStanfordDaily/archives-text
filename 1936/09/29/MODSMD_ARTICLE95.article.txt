# Norm Bright Wins Cross-City Trek
## 
### 
Norman Bright, Stanford's gradu
taed ace distance runner and Sunny
vale school teacher, is still adding
crowns to his laurels. Finishing
ahead of 20 contestants, he captured
the seven - mile cross - city race
through San Francisco's Excelsior
district held last week.
Yesterday, in the classic Dipsea
run, the toughest cross-country race
in America, Norm finished with the
third best actual time, but his
heavy handicap shoved him back to
19th place in the final results. Bob
Alexander, Stanford's top-notch mil
er, finished fifth in actual time,
fourth with handicap.
