A college professor noticed that
poor grades are often due not to
brains running low hut to pens run
ning dry!
So lie worked out an utterly differ
{ ent and basically better pen principle
I —and Geo. S. Parker engineered it
i to perfection.
Thus came the revolutionary Parker
saeless Vacumatic that has super
seded every old-style pen —both sac
tyi te and saeless.
Recently the student editors of 30
college papers asked 4,699 of their
readers, "Which make of pen do you
own? Which pen do you prefer?"
To both questions more students
answered "Parker,"' than any other
two makes of pens COMBUSTED!
One reason is that the Vacumatic
ink supply is EVER-VISIBLE, the
ENTlhll length of the barrel. It
isn't merely last-drop visibility—
doesn't merely show when your pen
! is empty. It shows days ahead \X 11 lON
I T'S RUNNING LOW, so it can't
run dry against your will.
The Vacumatic's working parts
arc sealed ill the top WHERE INK
CAN NEVER TOUCH THEM—
can never decompose them. That's
why this miracle pen is (rIJAHAN
TEEU mechanically perfect.
And the Parker Vacumatic has no
rubber ink sac or lever filler —hence
