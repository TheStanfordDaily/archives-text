# Enrolment of 3921 Passes Old Marks
## Men Exceed Women 2.5- 1; Depression Losses Are Entirely Recovered 
### 
With the registration total of 3,921
students, a new record enrollment
was established at yesterday's close
of a two day registration period, both
over last year's comparable figure
and also for the total all quarter high
in the history of the University.
This year's total which includes
122 students at the San Francisco
Medical School exceeds last year's
comparable figure of 3,783 students
by 138. The previous all quarter
high made at the end of last year's
autumn quarter with 3,895 registra
tions recorded was also topped by
26 more students.
Figures Show Gain
Both men's and women's figures
shows respective gains, this year's
total including 2788 men and 1133
women as compared to 1935's enroll
ment of 2722 men and 10(51 women.
This year's ratio of men to women
thus stands at approximately 2.5 to 1.
Looking back over the registra
tions for similar periods over the
past six years, a study shows a high
of 3513 students registered in 1930
followed by a decline to a depres
sion low in 1932 of 3167 registra
tions filed. By 1934 the previous
high of 1930 was surpassed with
3,599 students enrolling in the Uni
versity.
Look Hack to 1891
Another comparison in the growth
of the University is noted in con
trasting yesterday's figures with the
approximately 500 students regis
tering on the opening quarter of
Stanford, October 1, 1891.
