# Love-Making Is 'Sucking Oranges,' 'Goo-Goo Riding' in Slang Contest
## 
### 
â™¦
When author Charles G. Norris
last spring offered $50 through the
l columns of Chaparral for the best
; list of campus slang, the magazine
i was deluged with choice bits of
i collegiate argot.
Winners of the contest, judged
by Dick Dawson and Rosemary Be
net, were Fred Clark, first prize;
Tro Harper, second prize; Curtis
Prendergast, third prize.
Most numerous were the syno
nyms for love-making and women.
J In the former classification were
| goo-goo riding, sucking oranges, to
snuzzle, and to pitch woo. To hang
j one on is "to kiss evenly and well."
Well Stacked Copies
A blonde is a cotton-noggin here,
j a swell gal is "hot copy," and a quiff
may be any female at all. A well
built girl is said to be jelled, or
stacked, as, "That frail is stacked
like a deck of cards without the
! joker."
The women, too, have a lan
; guage all their own. If you hear
I one girl giving another the doleful
j news that "Charlie's dead," be not
! too saddened; it merely means her
| slip is showing. If the girl has
! slipped a cable, she's actually
; broken a shoulder strap.
Are You a "Gooch"?
Among the other colorful expres
i sions current on the campus are "to
tool a mount," drive a car; "whale
oil," hot air or guff; "lower the
boom," give hell to; "green jitts,'*
that morning-after feeling; "custard
lip or satchel mouth," one who talks
j too much; "duked out or gussied
, up," all dressed up; "gooch," to
j dance in the city, or a smooth dan
i cer; "cookin' with gas," doing all
; right, getting down to business;
j "fry your noggin," get drunk; "jam
j session," the study period night be
| fore an ex.
