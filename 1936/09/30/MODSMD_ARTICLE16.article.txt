* more dangerous than the enemy, bc-
I cause they handle rifles as though
| they were popguns.
"The rebels have no uniforms,
I most of thorn can't even read. Some
of them are sentries who stop me to
! see my pass on my trips between
Burgos and Hendaye, usually grum
ble for a while and let me pass, un
willing to admit their illiteracy."

Burgos and Hendaye, usually grum
