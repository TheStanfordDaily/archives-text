# Gros Named Debate Coach; Chapin Leaves
## October Six Set by New Forensic Adviser For First Meet of Season 
### 
While Lee Chapin is studying in
England and France during his
leave of absence, former Student
Manager Bob Gros has been ap
pointed faculty adviser for debate,
or, as the office is popularly called,
debate coach.
For the first time in many years,
Gros announced, men and women
debaters will meet together. The
initial meeting of the year will be
held Tuesday, October 6, in the Eng
lish corner. The room number is to
be announced later.
Informal Get-together
All men and women debaters are
invited to this informal get-together,
freshmen included. At this time
hours for individual meetings will be
arranged. One and two units are to
be given for the course.
The majority of the debaters' time
this quarter will be spent in study
ing the current political question.
Two approaches to the problems are
to be made. The first is that actual
debates will be heldâ€”that is, Re
publican vs. Democrats.
Laboratory Work
The second method of study will
be classroom laboratory work, in
which the debaters will analyze the
logical validity of the arguments put
forth by the political parties.
While at Stanford, Gros was a var
sity debater, and was debate man
ager in 1934-35. The same year he
was president of the Western Asso
ciation of Debate Managers.
