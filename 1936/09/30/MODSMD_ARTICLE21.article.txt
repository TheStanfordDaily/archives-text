# Builders Go Row As Disgruntled Greeks Camp Out
## Jordan Home Overrun By Peregrinating Delts; Phi Psi's Reinstalled 
### 
With only three houses still un
finished, five new or rebuilt houses
now line the row. Phi Psi, with
only interior remodeling, moved in
last week, leading the race for com
pletion by registration day.
Chi Omegas will move into a still
unfinished house today, but will eat
they can until tomorrow
morning, when meals begin. Elec
tricians and workmen applying fin
ishing touches will probably not be
completely evacuated for a week.
D.U.'s Rough It
Delta Tau Delta, luckier than D.U.,
has moved in en masse to Dr. Jor
dan's home, where they will prob
ably stay until the fiftenth. Far
reaching changes will bring the Delt
mansion on the hill up to date
throughout.
The D.U.'s dot the campus. Eight
are occupying the cook's shack be
hind their huge and entirely reno
vated house; one sleeps outside on a
mattress and springs in the back
yard; some stay with friends, and
some are still at hotels.
Although the upper floors are
completed, the D.U's may not move
in until the end of the week, ac
cording to a ruling handed down by
the contractor.
Valiant Sigma Nu
Phi Psi partially remodeled the
two upper floors, adding woodwork
and altering the dining room. Fire
escapes were the only exterior ad
dition.
Sigma Nu added a now dining
room, which is still under con
struction. The Sigma Nu's however,
eat undaunted while plasterers arc
still at work.
