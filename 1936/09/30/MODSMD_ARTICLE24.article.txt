## 'Could Be Better; Says Killefer; Ex Committee Members Enthusiastic 
### 
"What do you think of the newly
instituted pre-registration program
for freshmen?"
While members of (he Lower Div
ision advisory committee and ad
ministrative olTicers of the Univer
sity were still commenting favorably
on the recently introduced plan, this
question was put to various student
leaders. Their answers, unanimous
ly in praise of the orientation pro
gram, follow:
Tom Killefer, junior class presi
dent: "It seems to me that the idea
is basically sound. Though I have
not contacted many frosh, the ones I
have talked If) seem to think it's a
good idea. However, I think that the
pre-registration period could be im
proved next year."
Roy Thompson, sophomore man on
Ex Committee: "I think the pre
registration period is rather nice.
The information that new studerts
get from faculty and student leaders
is very helpful as far as the under
standing of such things as the honor
code, traditions, and songs goes. All
in all, I think it's beneficial."
Mary Craig, head sponsor at
Roble: "I'm so enthusiastic about it
that I can hardly talk. I feel sure
that the Class of 1940 is fortunate in
being the first class to have this
wonderful opportunity."
Fred Williams, member-at-large
of the Ex Committee and varsity
football man: "This is the first time
in the history of the school that
freshmen have had an opportunity
to become acquainted with the heads
of the Farm and with the customs
here. It is a move that should be
continued."
Chuck Fontius, student manager:
"I think it is a very good idea, and
that it worked quite well for its first
trial. Particularly good were the
Honor Code discussions at Encina
and Roble. With its continuance it
should go ofi more smoothly, but the
idea is excellent."
Dean Pierose, chairman of the pre
registration committee "I think it's
by far the best thing that's ever hap
pened here. The freshmen wpre en
thusiastic about everything they
were told. Everyone seemed to like
it and got in the spirit of things. It's
something that my class really
missed out on when we were fresh
men."
Jackie Brown, member of Ex
Committee: "The freshmen I have
talked to enjoyed it very much."
Fred Nagel, orchestra leader "At
the outset I thought it was a swell
idea, and although I haven't had
very close contact with the results
of the Pro-Reg Period I have heard
that it was very successful. It give:;
a break to the frosh who don't know
the campus."
Sharp Whit more, Encina: "I
thought it was helpful as far as En
cina men were concerned. Living in
one wing of Encina makes it difficult
to know any boys in the rest of the
hall. By having a barbecue and a
meeting in the gym, we got, ac
quainted. Pre - registration also
helped us get rid of that lost feeling.
Now at least, we won't be in a da/.'
when we walk along the Quad.
Ted Lyon: "I think it's fine We
had time to get settled before every
thing el.se starts. Usually there's so
much to be done at one time thai
nothing is done as well as it should
be."
