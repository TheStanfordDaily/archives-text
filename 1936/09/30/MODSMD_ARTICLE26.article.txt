Somebody once said that the rea
son the Communists are sore is be
cause the capitalists get all the good
women.
Which makes it pretty obvious
that the reason some people sit down
and weep great buckets of printer's
ink about the "over-emphasis of
football" is because they are sore at
the athletes getting all the good
women. Or did I hear Jorgi ask if
there were any good women around
here?
Anyway, all this place needs no\£
is snow and then we'd see Honest
Abe Jim Reynolds come trudging
through with the other seven cents'
worth he forgot to give us when he
(old us about the fine and dandy
ways of treating the muscle battalion
they have at U.S.C. All he disre
membered to add was that we can't
call the Southern California School
for Movie Extras and Chorus Boys
names any more. I

That's going to be tough on us.
For years we've consoled ourselves
with thinking that no matter how
low we got, we'd never sink to
where U.S.C. was. In fact, the situa
tion at U.S.C. was almost a national
joke. The California Pelican once
ran a cartoon of a huge bruiser from
the steel mills waving a of pa
per in front of his aged mother's
classes and saying, "Gee ma, can ya
imagine it—me getting a scholarship
from U.S.C.?" The gag was reprinted
in college humor magaiznes all over
the country.
Seriously, though, let there be no
complaints, not even our own. After
all, what hurts is that Reynolds is so
completely dead right. And so hon
est about it, too, without even a pas?;
at pulling the wool over anybody's
eyes. It is rumored that not only
U.S.C., but U.C.L.A. and Berkeley
too have been institutions of higher
athletics for years and years. If
