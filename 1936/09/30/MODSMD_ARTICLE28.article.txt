# Two More "Carbon Copy" Brothers Muddle Encina
## 
### Tim Sullivan 
Lightning may never strike twice
:in the same place, but Encina's
! brow-beaten walls are witness to the
! fact that twins do. The Class of '39
I boasted proudly of their famous
| Zook boys, wrestlers from Kansas,
! and now the frosh of '40 ai'e trying
to figure out the mystery which
shrouds two small men named Mos
i kovitz.
Alfred and Leonard Moskovitz,
| residents of Room 345 Encina, are
j the cause of the aroma of curiosity
| which permeates the otherwise pure

I Stanford too follows the path that
! some people think is full of sin, let
it be to Reynolds' credit that Stan
ford does it honestly.
—Curtis Prendergast

I Farm air. They are not exactly iden- i
tical twins—no indeed—Alfred was I
born 15 minutes before little Leon-I
ard saw the light.
Boys Are Versatile
Graduates of Lowell High School
in San Francisco, the brothers Mos- '
kovitz hope to become lawyers, par- I
ticipate in track, and make music for i
the Stanford band. Leonard has
leanings toward the trumpet, and
Alfred is skilled with the clarinet. I
i Further, the boys have restless fin- j
j gers. They want to do work in j
journalism, and are fortified with i
J experience as music editors on their j
I high school sheet.
Questioned concerning first im
pressions of his new university!
j home, A. Moskovitz said: "It has i
| been my life's ambition to go to j
Stanford." His brother, a humorous i
j glow lighting his brown eyes, in- '
formed the reporter that they had j
an elder sister who goes to Cal, and
hastened to add: "That's why we |
came to Stanford."
