# Study Value Of School Training
## Reports Based on J.C. Student Cases 
### 
Punching adding machines in the
lobby of the Old Union for the past
five months, some 20 WPA and
NYA workers have been engaged in
compiling statistics for the *'Stan
ford Occupational Study."
The statistics are to be used as
the basis of a study to show the ef
fectiveness of training institutions
in equipping their students for oc
cupational careers, and the actual
experiences which have come to
them during their attempts to se
cure permanent employment.
To Publish Findings
A previous study, already com
pleted, dealing with the occupa
tional mobility of a typical Amer
ican community—San Jose —is about
to be published by the Stanford
University Press. This study was
supplemented by a similar study of
Santa Clara County jail and poor
farm inmates.
The present study is concerned
with reports from approximately
8,000 junior college students of the
Class of 1930, these students hav
ing been out on the labor market
in a majority of cases from three to
five years since leaving school.
Analyzing Backgrounds
An analysis of the students' oc
cupational backgrounds is now be
ing made to determine from what
occupational levels they come in re
lation to intelligence test scores,
training, expectations and place
ment after the school period.
A follow-up study of these stu
dents is in progress to determine
the effectiveness of training and ac
tual facts of occupational placement.
Dr. Davidson Directing
The study is under the direction
of Dr. P. E. Davidson of the School
of Education and H. Dewey An
derson, State Assemblyman from
San Jose; and is being supervised
by Mrs. Linna V. Culver, who
moved her minions about a week
ago to the old Roble Gym. It is
estimated that about three more
months will be required for the
work's completion.
To Study Work Trends
A second phase of this project
will be the development of a new
scale of occupations based on rates
of pay, prestige, and competency,
or the degree of skill required.
Proposed projects to be related to
the present undertaking are a study
of occupational trends, to show
what occupations are expanding or
contracting and what effect such
tendency has on the placement of
workers, and a study of occupa
tional interests.
The worlds largest carnivorous
animal is the Kodiak bear, found in
the pure species only on Kodiak
Island, Alaska. These creatures of
ten attain a height of 12 feet and
weigh more than a ton.
