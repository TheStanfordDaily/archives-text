# Subdued Reds Feel Lash Of Thornhill Whip
## Practice Features Speed, Passing Power; Coffis Stone Return to Squad 
### Herb Diamond 
To the eyes of fancy-hatted Tiny
Thornhill the Stanford gridders ap
pear strong defensively, but it seems
that in this respect only do they now
rank with their predecessors of last
year.
The present lack of speed and
passing power has been giving the
Farm mentor more than a little
worry, with the result that he's
been sending the Indians through
increasingly stiffer sessions on the
practice turf.
Coilis On Deck
The squad worked far into Mon
day evening, and last night they
were at it again—covering line
charges and passing, along with
plenty of scrimmage against Coach
Ben Winkleman's Grays.
The present lineup is apparently
comparable in weight to last year's
Red Machine, but when it comes
to speed there is much to be desired.
Thus far diminutive Jimmy Coffis
and broad jumper Leo Madlem, both
of whom are used at left half, are
the only men who seem to exhibit
the much-needed winged feet. Cof
fis' ankle apparently bothers him
not at all, for he's been taking full
part in the proceedings this week.
Stone Okeh
Grant Stone has come back at
right end, and although his shoulder
is now improved, he has been taking
it easy in order that he will be able
to see action at Pullman this Satur
day. Bob Dakan, who worked out at
left end, has relinquished that post
to Stone and moved the other end
of the line. Fred William's slight
leg injury taken against Santa Clara
seems negligible.
The 19-0 victory that Washington
State ran up over Montana last
week should definitely establish the
Cougars as a threat in the Pacific
Coast Conference, inasmuch as the
Montanans have been rated far
stronger this year than ever before.
