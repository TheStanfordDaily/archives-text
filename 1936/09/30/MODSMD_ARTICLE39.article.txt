# Grubbs Optimistic Over Polo Chances; First Squad Returns
## 
### Jack O'Donnell 
Optimism of the most enthusiastic
sort is fairly oozing between cracks
in the walls of the Horse Polo office
these days.
For, according to Captain Grubbs,
who answers to the name of head
coach of the mallet wielders in addi
tion to otjper titles which accrue to
his professorial duties, all four men
who comprised the squad at the close
of the 1935 season will return for
more horseplay for Stanford.
First String Returns
The four who very likely will
again step into first string berths are
Russ Rasmussen, Bee Derby, and the
Fullerton brothers, Jim and Bob.
To afford life's spice, competition,
Don McAuslin and Bert McLintock,
both of whom saw plenty of action
last year, will be up there striving
mightily to obtain a starting position.

| Only player of note to depart by
i way of graduation from the ranks of
j top-notchers was Carl Beal.
Arizona Tops Schedule
Outstanding engagement on the!
j Stanford polo schedule, which at the |
i present is a rather sketchy affair, is
that with the University of Arizona,
| at Tuscon. The game is slated to be
1 played during the Thanksgiving
holidays.
Action, however, will be had every
J Friday afternoon on the Stanford
field during a greater part of the sea- j
son, either among squad members, or
with several of the club teams which
| thrive along the Peninsula. Encoun
. ters will probably be scheduled with
' the San Mateo Freebooters, and
I Will Tevis' highly touted organiza
! tion. Practice for the Stanford lads
j will begin next Monday.
