# Row Dominates Ex Committee
## Greeks Claim Six Seats On Governing Body 
### 
When Ex Committee, Stanford's
legislative body, holds its initial
meeting a week from last night, the
effect of the Row's thumping vic
tories in last spring's A.S.S.U. elec
tions will again be stamped in Hall
partisans' minds.
The loss of Graduate Member Gib
Holloway, D.U., who didn't return to
school, will not cut the Row's lead
much. Out of nine Ex Committee
members, six still represent the
Greek letter houses. A member to
replace Holloway will be elected
later this quarter.
Row committeemen are President
Jim Reynolds, Zete; Senior Man Bob
Mallett, Chi Psi; Senior Woman
Ruth Goodan, Pi Phi; Member-at
large Fred Williams, Delt; Sopho
more Man Roy Thompson, Kappa
Sig pledge; and Sophomore Woman
Jackie Brown, D.G.
Hall occupants are represented on
the student governing body by Vice
president Esther Pelton, Lagunita;
Junior Man Chick Franich, Hall
candidate for A.S.S.U. president last
spring, Toro; and Junior Woman
Shirley Jones, Lagunita.
