# SIDELINE SLANTS ...

### 
While the dapper Mr. Klauber, big |
hoy of the sports department, is re
cuperating from th</ strain encount
ered in turning out yesterday's twelve
page paper, it becomes the lot of one '
of his more humble minions to spend
a few moments hashing over the in
tricate problems involved in the cur
rent Farm football crisis.
A play in last Saturday's chaotic
Santa Clara struggle which has been
largely overlooked by the scribes
comes to mind. j
Jumping Joe Vigna
Jumping Joe Vigna had just begun
a hurried excursion around left end
I when two burly SC boys loomed up
j in his path. It looked like the jig was
up for Joe when Glenn Hamilton, in a
I role worthy of the famous "Bones,"
j lunged into the two foeman and
brought them both simultaneously to
the turf while Vigna scampered on for
a seven-yard gain.
| Nor were seats on the bench the
secure resting spots for substitutes
I that Ihey have in seasons not
I long past. Searching for a combina
| tion that would click, Coach Tiny sent
i reserves into the action upon the
,slightest provocation. Pop Grant, Neil
Rassmussen, and Jake Brigham
looked the best of the men who al
ternated with the starting lineup as
ccgs in the halting Red tornado.
Boys Back in Harness
The good Mr. Thornhill, who has
of late had little compensation for
that goodness (witness the cruel

fate that swept Paulman and Coffis
from his liock), had cause for a bit
of rejoicing yesterday. Reasons for
this were two-fold.
First, Jeemy Coffis was given de
hospitalization papers by Dr. Roth.
In fact, the fiery safety man's pres
ence made Tiny so tickled that he
sent his charges through the first •
Monday scrimmage that they have |
had (following a game the previous '
Saturday) since the beginning of his |
| regime as head coach at Stanford, j
( Results ol said scrimmage were
I highly gratifying to the coaching j
I staff and the few spectators who
, were present to witness this un- i
looked for turn in practice routine.
McMillan Back
Secondly, the chief of the Indians
j was in no wise dismayed when, as
' he gazed over his contingent of
| cleated braves, he espied one Don
| McMillan, veteran guard and pre
| med. student who was supposedly
; lost as -a martyr to the chem lab.
J '-'Mac" has ironed out his schedule
| difficulties and is ready to bolster
! again the running guard post.
Tiger on the Loose
Turning for a moment from the
I gridiron to focus our atention on a
! sturdy litlte Stanl'ordite who is burn
| ing up the track (trail is really the
i word for it) months before the regu
| lar season, we see the achievement of
; little "Tiger" Alexander, winner of
j three firsts in last year's intramurals
I and monogram earner in the mile.

The tiny tiger-man leather lunged
his way to a fourth place in the Ma
rin County 7 u j mile run last Satur
day, and in doing so outdistanced
most of a huge field of starters. His
time was only a few seconds shy of
the old course record.

| Leaving Alexander with the gold
medal he was awarded for his ef
forts in the long cross country chase,
we may properly close with a choice
reminiscence of gayer days on the
grid.
