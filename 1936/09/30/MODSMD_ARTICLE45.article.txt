# The 						Hello Tradition Lives Again

Said one freshman in yesterday's Daily: "By
the first day of the pre-registration period, even
the freshest of the freshmen is impressed by the
spirited and friendly atmosphere of democracy
that is so prevalent on the Stanford campus."
Said another: "In spite of three days of fact
cramming, the incoming Lower Division stu
dents were left with relatively little knowledge
of campus customs and many of their questions
unanswered."
One frosh criticizes the technique of fact
cramming, the other feels that he has been wel
comed. Between these two viwpoints there is
conflict. People resent being fact-crammed.
People like to be welcomed, to be made to feel
as if they are wanted.
Which one was the real impression that the
freshmen recieved?
The Daily does not know. The Daily tried to
find out. As far as we can determine, the re
action on the part of the frosh was a positive
one. They liked being welcomed, and even if
they felt that the welcome was more fact-cram
ming than welcome, what would they have felt
if there had been no organized effort to wel
come them at all?
When I was a freshman, my sponsor didn't
arrive until the third day, and then, about all he
could think of to say was "Hello." But in those
days, he v/as adjudged one of the best sponsors
in the Hall. He at least said "Hello" in a friendly
way.
Even if the Pre-reg period didn't get the fresh
men informed as to campus customs, it at least
set the sponsors of Encina and Roble to think
ing about them. The enthusiasm with which
they carried out the program attests to the fact,
that they, themselves, had felt the lack of wel
come in old Reg Days, had remembered that
they hastily had chosen courses which set
them off entirely wrong on their college career.
They were willing to come back several weeks
early and work hard for the program. But some
(but by no means all)) faculty members, who,
ostensibly are being paid for educating stu
dents, grumbled at the prospect of having to
return two days early to attempt to advise them
so that they would start out getting an educa
tion instead of getting in dutch.
