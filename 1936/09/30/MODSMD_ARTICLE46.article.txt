Around eleven thirty Monday night, the
pressman walked into the front office, and said
he had no six page rolls, that The Daily would
have to go 12 pages instead of 10.
This meant to our horrified editors, already
oppressed with the idea of getting out a ten
page paper for the morning of Reg. Day, under
staffed before its tryoutee period, and some
what rusty after a summer layoff, that we would
have to make up two extra pages on the spur
of the moment. So at 12 o'clock at night, we
reached down in the sock, pulled out some old
Theater cuts, lifted some three-months-old stor
ies out of the files, and proceeded to slap to
gether the edition in time to get to bed by six
o'ciock in the morning.
I have heard several comments today upon
the proof errors in the paper, wrong heads on
wrong stories, and the fact that some reporters
didn't get their stories right. Nobody com
mented, though, on the fact that The Daily ap
peared with 12 pages of disposable tissue on
the morning of Reg Day.
