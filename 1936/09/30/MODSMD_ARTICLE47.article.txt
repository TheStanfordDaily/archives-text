at this late date of the University's policy to
wards student drinking, we print here an ex
cerpt from Dr. Wilbur's letter to presidents of
living groups last year: "The regulations of the
University are meant to prevent the use of al
coholic liquors of all sorts on the campus. At
the same time students who consume liquor
elsewhere and bring the good name of the

through resultant conduct are liable to dis

grounds for expulsion from the University."
