# In the Daily Shack
## 
### 
We don't want to be too inquisitive over here
at The Daily, lest we get the label of muck
rakers, but we wish that the gentelman who un
loaded the four sacks of cow manure in front
of the Daily Shack yesterday morning would
make known his reasons for the actions.
Was it a reflection on the loquaciousness of
the edits? or a comment upon the need for
more fertile ideas?
