CURTAIN AT B:IO—A.M.
You may think your papa the most illiberal guy in
the woi'ld. He is probably a Republican. He is pos
sibly a Chauvinist. And no doubt he wants you to
marry brilliantly, raise kiddies, and live in a white
man's neighborhood.
So he sends you to college. God only knows what
you will buy with the quarterly allowance he-earned
despite-Roosevelt. But if you go to classes, you will
buy doubt for papa's most cherishcd principles of life.
* * * *
We don't mean Communism or Anarchism or how
to smear Herb Hoover with a time-bomb. Those are
ideas. All you will leam (worth learning) are doubts.
If papa is a college man, he already knows this and
isn't nearly so dumb as a Republican should be.
But even if he didn't go to college, he probably has
resigned himself to your purchase of something more
than conventional polish. In his heart, dumb papa
probably recognizes your outside chance of building a
new and better way of life—from someone else's
doubts, as long as his facts are no lrnjner valid.
* * * *
For he must realize the things he lived by as facts
were just "facts," no more correct than some aerated
hypothesis bandied from professor to student and back
to examination paper.
And maybe he even confesses that as a world
builder, he was a swell world-wrecker. If he has
made his deposition as sweeping as the evidence of
'29 justifies, he has at least a secret hope that the new
world we must build will not be like his old one.
* * * *
Youth suffered in that old world as painfully as the
intellectual stumble-bums who made it.
The jobless college grad had an economic hangover
without ever having had the fun of an economic drunk.
He never knew how it felt to have a stock broker write
a fat check because he hollered right while watching
the exchange board. But he does know the result of
that hollering. And he has sworn off his papa's "fac
tual" economic moonshine. Instead he'll stick to the
soft drink of theory.
* * * *
Like most men who weren't too woozy to see
straight, professors also realize that the old "truths"
by which papa earned his paper profits—the protocols
of individualism and untrammcled profits—fell with
the steel index. So he has substituted for them nebu
lous speculations, rules of life's game that may not be
right, but aren't clearly wrong. He, therefore, teaches
us not what to know, but what to think.
* * * *
In Political Science he tells us that Communism is
more than a red-baiting combination of letters, less
than a perfect unguent for the world's sores. In Eco
nomics, he tells us that there is no mysterious divinity
controlling the rise and fall of car-loadings. In Phi
losophy, he tells us merely that we know nothing.
There are few facts in all this, only samples of the
world s best thinking on its worst problems. Not
what has been decided, but what has been proposed.
Education at Stanford is not given us as a finished
product, heat before serving, but as the raw materials.
Instead of a compound, we get the component chem
icals. Whether we make a useful substance, or blow
ourselves to glory, is entirely up to us.
