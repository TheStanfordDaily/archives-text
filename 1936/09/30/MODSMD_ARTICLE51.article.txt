While many Stanford students spent a profitable
summer on the books reviews; so that they could talk
in the seminars this winter as if they'd read the book,
others improved their minds journeying to the Euro
pean centers of culture, ogling at the gold leaf and
the community plate.
One such was a representative of the Dean of Men
on the Olympic baseball team. In London, the Dean's
man met up with Mr. Lee Chapin, director of Stanford
Public Speaking, now on leave this quarter.
Together they went down into Chinatown to get
Gee Yuk Chow Mein Eastern Style on the 40-cent
lunch. Outside of one of the bean sprout havens, was a
villainous-looking Chinese changing the menu.
Mr. Chapin, who is quite proud of the Chinese he
picked up at Lingnan University in China, addressed
the coolie in the dialect.
The Chinese stared at him in amazement, finally
said, "Naow I say, ol fellow, I cawn't understand a
word you're saying."
In the hamletsburg of Palo Alto, a student of this
University received a notice that if he didn't pay cer
tain fees to the Accounting Department by that after
noon, he would receive a $2 fine. So the hamletsburger
made his check payable to Stanford University and
sent it out by air mail from Paly. On the envelope,
the P.O. stamped: "Sent by truck to facilitate delivery."
Chuck Schafer, the blonde hellion of the Speaker's
Bureau, comes into the Daily shack every other day
to see if he can't get some publicity for his super
organization of table pounders.
After several days he has hit upon the idea of using
Our Hash for the dissemination of his propaganda,
and so he tells us a story on "Will Rogers, the Man"
Gros. ,
The script reads that Bureau Speaker Gros went to
a small town service club to deliver an address.
The chairman said: "Today, we have the pleasure of
hearing Mr. Robert Gros. Next week, we shall visit
the sewage disposal plant."
Thi.s does not dispose of Mr. Schafer, however.
