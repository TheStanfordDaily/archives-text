It may be the hot climate, it may'
be the summer Daily, or the school
teachers, but apparently Dr. Harold 1
W. V. Temperley of Cambridge, vis
iting summer professor in history,
got a new and different slant on the
Stanford student body. The slant
caused him to write the poetry
printed below, which he willed to
the editor when he departed.

AN IMPRESSION OF STANFORD
When a student goes to Stanford, he
must learn
The difference 'twixt alcohol and
gas.
He must also teach his teachers to
discern
That he's something rather more
than just a "pass."
Refrain
Till it's farewell to Stanford, fare
well to its shades,
To its red-clustered roofs and its
cool colonnades,
To its honey-brown walls and its
palm-covered glades.
He must sometimes take the straight
and narrow road
And sometimes shun the broad way
and the green.
He must keep the Ten Command
ments and the Code
And scrub his shield of honor bright
and clean.
Refrain
When professors come a-visiting and
shirk
The students view it well, and save
his face.
But if he buckles down and does his
work,
The students spread the news all
round the place.
Professors aren't as black as they are

painted,
And students not so white, within
my knowledge.
But if neither have their place
am«ng the sainted,
Let eacTi of them come play the man
at college.
Refrain
Till it's farewell to Stanford, fare
well to its shades,
To its red-clustered roofs and its
cool colonnades,
To its honey-brown walls and its
palm-covered glades.
