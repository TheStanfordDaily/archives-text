The Editor, Sir
I feel very sorry for Bull Sessioner
Eiscnbach. He seems to be laboring'
under the illusion that the Stanford
men are models of good behavior.
Sometime you should loan him
enough money to go to the local pic
ture show and hear the offsprings of
the upper 4 per cent enjoy a movie. |
Maybe Mama didn't do right by
them, but to object to the kind of
signs the Accounting Office uses on
the grounds that they offend the del
' icate sensibilities of the Stanford
Rough is laughable.
