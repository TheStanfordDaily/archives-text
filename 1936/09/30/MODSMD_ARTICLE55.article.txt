Clipped by Phil Bcrnheim

HAVE YOU WONDERED what's
become of your favorite raido pro
gram? It's been shuffled around in
the semi-annual daylight saving ex
plosion, this time caused by Eastern
production centers abandoning the
thing. Most national proframs are
heard one hour later, but many have
chanyed day and time completely, as
have many Coast productions.
PRESS NOTES: Most widely read
of syndicated columnists is O. O. Mc -
Intyre. His "New York Day by Day"
is carried by over 400 newspapers in
the United tSates, Hawaii, and the
Philippines. Every city in America
of over 20,000 population reads his
daily screed, excepting only Dallas.
His was the first syndicated column,
and only five papers have ever dis
continued it—and then only because
the papers themselves were discon
tinued. McNaught Syndicate, which
peddles the stuff, figure that 10,248,-
817 readers see the column daily.
REPLACEMENTS: Bernie Cum

Colonel Stoopnaglc and Budd, in
their last night in "Town Hall," pre

way, start a new series of their own
Sunday.
WORLD SERIES: First broadcast
on KPO, KGO, and KFRC at 10:15
this morning. Curse the boys that
think it's fun to load up every major
station with this. Some like it, but
some don't. Certainly this is not op
erating in the public "interest, con
venience, or necesstiy."
Druten was probably the most en
joyed. Others were Laburnum

gram? It's been shuffled around in
the semi-annual daylight saving ex
plosion, this time caused by Eastern

PRESS NOTES: Most widely read
of syndicated columnists is O. O. Mc -
Intyre. His "New York Day by Day"
is carried by over 400 newspapers in
the United tSates, Hawaii, and the

daily screed, excepting only Dallas.
His was the first syndicated column,
and only five papers have ever dis
continued it—and then only because
the papers themselves were discon
tinued. McNaught Syndicate, which
peddles the stuff, figure that 10,248,-
817 readers see the column daily.
