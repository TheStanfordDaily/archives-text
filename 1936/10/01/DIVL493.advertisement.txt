WHEN the class of 1917 was at college, a long
distance telephone call took (on the average)
more than ton minutes to he put through.
This time has been whittled down gradually, so
that now the connection is made in an average of
] A minutes—nine out of ten of them while you
hold the line.
JJut this is only one phase of the relentless effort
to improve. Your service is better today because
voice transmission is clearer — interruptions and
errors less frequent than
ever before.
America demands fast but
sure telephone service—and
gets it.
