# Negotiations Proceed To Avert Pacific Coast Shipping Tie-up
## Employers, Union Men Clash on Arbitration 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 (U.P.)
—Federal negotiators, racing against
time in efforts to avert a Pacific
Coast shipping shutdown at mid
night, made little progress tonight as
shipowners and union longshoremen
clung close to their original stands
on the arbitration question which
was the crux of the deadlock.
The employers, asked to agree to a
60-day truce, made a minor conces
sion in agreeing to extend present
working contracts 15 days so far as
maritime unions were concerned,
with the exception of the most pow
erful union in the situation, the In
ternational Longshoremen's Asso
ciation.
It was believed the other unions—
the sailors, the mates and pilots, the
engineers, and other ship workers—
would refuse to accept the offer of
the exception.
Transcontinental telephone and
telegraph wires buzzed as Washing
ton authorities, and especially the
new Federal Maritime Commission,
sought to force a delay in the rup
ture, which was scheduled for mid
night.
McGrady, assistant secretary of la
bor, called Admiral Taylor, member
of the maritime commission, last
night and begged him to persuade
the ship operators to agree to a
truce. Harry Bridges, I.L.A. leader,
also talked with Taylor.
