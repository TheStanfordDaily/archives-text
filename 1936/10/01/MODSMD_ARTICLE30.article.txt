# Red Machine Faces First Conference Ordeal In Cougar Game Saturday
## 
### Herb Diamond 
When the train carrying the cur
rent edition of the Big Red Machine
pulls out of the Palo Alto station at
exactly .5:27 o'clock this afternoon,
Stanford's hopes for Coast gridiron
supremacy will be abroad. Satur
day's game at. Pullman will be the
, first conference tilt for the Indians
j and a win over Washington State
1 would be of no little value.
Squad Listed
Farm rooters will escort to the
local depot a squad of thirty-six
J stalwart men of the gridiron, each
carefully picked by Coach Tiny
Thornhill and his associates, Jim
Lawson, Bob Grayson, Ben Winkle
man, and Husky Hunt. The official
list of gridders a.s released last night
included the following names: Bayer,
D. ( Brigham, J. Brigham, Callaway,
Calvelli, Campbell, Clark, Coflij
Collins, Dakan, Fay, Ferko, Gamier,
Grant, Hamilton, Holdridge, Hoos,
1 Kirsch, Luckett, D. McMillan, F. Mc-
Millan, Madlem, Mangan, Matthews,
Olcott, Rasmussen, Schott, Shannon,
Stone, Sutton, Tsoutsouvas, Vigna,
West, deWitt, Williams, Zagar, and
senior manager Dan Lisberger.
Tiny and his staff have put the
1 crew through a series of intensive
workouts during this week in prepa
! ration for the fracas. Passing and
i line charging have been particularly
stressed.
, While Babe Hollingsbery, Cougar
| mentor, was expressing grave con-
I cern over two of his first string
linemen now on the injured list, he
still found time to release a tenta
tive starting lineup for Saturday's
! festivities. Terry will be at left
i end, Bell will hold down the left
j tackle post; Jones, left guard; Smith
j at the center post; Campbell, right
; guard; Scheyer, right tackle; and
Bates, right end. The backfield will
be composed of Goddard at quarter-
Fletcher, left half; Sienko, right half;
j and Dougherty, fullback.
Two Cougars Injured
The two men injured are Bates,
who suffered a broken thumb in the
19-0 victory over Montana last week
and Grimstead, reserve tackle, who
dislocated an elbow. The Farm sick
list included Schott and Munger
with bruised knees, while Tsout
' souvas has six stitches in his finger
! as a result of a tussle with a but
! cher knife.
A stiff scrimmage session against
Coach Ben Winkleman's Gray
eleven was included in the practice
proceedings which lasted well into
1 last night. Winkleman is firmly con
vinced that the Cougars have a host
! of talent that they didn't show
j against Montana last week because
j they weren't forced to use it.
Stanford is Underdog
The Cougar's line-charging is re~
j puted to be a deadly weapon, and
! Goddard, at quarter, can always be
i counted upon to score when he's
, anywhere near the goal line. As a
I matter of fact, Stanford is the un
j dcrdog in the opinion of some dope
ste.rs. But it must also be remem
bered that Thornhill likes to have
j things look that way before an im
; portant contest, in order to rule out
I any hint of overcontidence on the
! part of the squad.
Tiny still intends to use plenty
! of passes, and he feels that they
i should prove a great deal more
I effective than they were against
Santa Clara. The Cardinals will
hold their final workout at 4 o'clock
; tomorrow afternoon in Portland's
Multnomah Stadium.
