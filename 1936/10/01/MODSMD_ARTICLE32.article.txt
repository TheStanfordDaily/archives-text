### MY RED FLAG, BOYS 
Mr. Stanley Dollar, who, as I re
member, once earned around $150,-
000 selling boats to his own company,
lias gathered the San Francisco
waterfront employers gang around
hirn. Their general attitude of dust
ing off the brass knuckles indicates
they rre prepared to chow that
they'll be damned if they'll let any
dirty Communists show them how
to run their business.
The word Communist is being
tossed around so glibly these days
that even the San Francisco Chron
icle no longer takes it seriously.
Thus calling Harry Bridges and his
tough longshoremen a bunch of red
radicals is not so serious as charging
that they seem incapable of compre
hending chat the steamship lines
have the right to hire whomever
they please.

Those who still think the 1934
waterfront strike was for higher
wages should be told now that con
trol of the hiring hall is what the
unions really want.
The idea is this: no matter how
dirty the actual hiring hall may be,
and no matter whether the cuspidors
there always seem to be put where
they are needed least, the hiring hall
is the Santa Claus of the ILA unions
and without it the unions would be
about as effective as the Rainbow
Girls in bringing the employers to

After all, when the dispatcher at
the hiring hall yells through the
public-address system, "Come on
youse guys, I need 20 pickets â€”no
picketing, no work," he has got to
mean it, if the hiring hall is going
to be anything more than a contin
uously-operated poker pavilion. The
union must be the great and only
giver of all jobs if it intends to have
any control over the rank-and-file
membership who must often wonder
if they could get jobs better on their
own hook.
So when the union finally does
control the hiring hall in a manner
that some shallow minds compare to

Hitler's rule over Germany, it can
really command a powerful army to
bring an employer to his knees on )
this question of higher wages.

It depends on the point of view
whether you think the union hiring
hall violates a divine and sacred
right of employers to hire whomever j
they please. The right to pay a man
starvation wages is also a divine and
sacred right. In these blessed
United States it would seem 'that the j
union is the working man's only pro
tection against being forced to take
what employers give him and like it
or to take what is given him and j
lump it.
To the hecklers on my right I say:
Was it legislative generosity or union
agitation that brought about the j
eight-hour law? Answer that.
