# Frosh Take To Air For Trojan Game
## Shipkey Plans To Match Passes with U. S. C. Babes' Aerial Circus 
### Phil Klauber 
Outweighed 197 to 184 pounds in
the line, but taking 183 over 178
pounds in the backfield, Harry Ship
key's Stanford frosh plan an aerial
offense in their big tussle with the
Trobabes in the stadium Saturday.
"Darn rights we're going to beat
U.S.C.!" says Harry. "Right!" say
dis assistants Rouble and Muller
and Alustiza in unison, and to
back it up, promptly lay several
bets on the Papoose nose, bets se
cured with doubting gray linemen
during last night's scrimmage with
'40.
A real passing circus will it be, too,
as Hobbs Adams' southerners used
the aerial route in much of their
big score over Riverside J.C. last
week.
Pitching for Shipkey will be Pat
ton, old iron, Hickingbotham, and
Grover, while Grant, Gallarneau,
Greer, Reade, and Sparling will do
the receiving.
Coach Shipkey announces with
pleasure that all of his gridders
have surmounted the aptitude test,
hence he can enter practice with a
firm foot for the rest of the season.
Some of the guys forgot to take it.
and not being full-fledged Stan
ford men, could not enter the Mo
desto game last week until it was
over—in the second quarter.
Harrowed by hashers leaving at
5:30, Shipkey plans to start his preps
at 3:30 hereafter. Lab instructors—
a little leniency?
