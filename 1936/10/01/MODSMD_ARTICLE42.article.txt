# Stanford Men Win Trophy in National Collegiate Meet
## Bob Bowers, John Parke Gain Title for Precise Landing and Bombing 
### 
Early last June in Chicago's Na
tional Intercollegiate Air Meet, two
members of Stanford's Flying Club
scored heavily in three eevnts to
bring the winning trophy west to
Palo Alto. Bob Bowers and John
Parks gained the title in only two
days of flying with their red-winged
cabin monoplane.
After scoring in both the contests
for precise landing, the co-pilots of
Stanford's piano finished up bomb
ing a target accurately. Parks and
Bowers first took the spot-landing
from a height of a thousand feet, fol
lowing with the precision landing
from a straight approach. The bomb
ing was done from a height of five
hundred feet, the projectile reaching
a 50-foot target below.
The trophy, signifying victory,
stands 36 inches and is engraved
with the names of the victorious fly
ers. Parks and Bowers can see their
names underneath those of the 1935
Purdue flyers.
The club, with its base at the Palo
Alto Airport, is composed of 20 men
and women and a Taylor Cub cabin
monoplane. All the activities are
financed by members of the club, in
addition to the dues of a dollar a
year and a required six-hour course
with the Associated Air Service. Be
sides President Rosenfield, who is
working for a transport license,
there are ten pilots.
