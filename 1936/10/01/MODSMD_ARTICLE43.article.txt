About 90 of us went over to those
movies of the Santa Clara game
Tuesday.
i say bu witli considerable of a
snicker, first because all of the boys
who stayed away, afraid of being
late to the Reg Dance were over
temorous; second, because we all
had comfortable seats and could see.
Do you remember when 700 were
sardined into the Little Theater,
hanging to the transoms by their
teeth last year to see the Washing
ton game?
The pictures are taken each week
by 8.A.C.-employed cameramen, for
a variety of purposes, principally as
a help toward showing Tiny and the
team their mistakes, and secondly
for showing to interested alumni
clubs and high school students.
Photography is excellent; the films
are taken with telescopic lense from
the roof of the press box. They are
run through in slow motion, with ac
tions and numbers of all players
amazingly clear.
The entire run shows only playing
time and a short gander at the score
board to see which down and how
far to go and how much time and
such between each play, and the
show lasts about 45 minutes.

SLOW AND
FAST WHISTLES

They all argue about several plays
that had definite effect on Stanford's
fate, but this goes first—narry a wag
says a harsh word about Nibs Price,
the ref. Refereeing is a terribly
tough job, and we all make mistakes,
but mistakes or none, the final out
come stands readily accepted by first
and last.
On that fumble of Gomez' after
his left end sweep down to our 8.
Ihe Bronc let the ball squirt out the
moment he was hit; his body at the
moment of separation takes an angle
of 60 degrees with the ground. This
was the only distinct butch, an
early, or "fast" whistle they call it.
On the other holler play, the one
that led to the fourth quarter touch
down, you remember a Hamilton to
Gilbert to Barlow touchdown. Well,
Gilbert was caught on the 25-yard
line where he pivoted"a bit, and had
his forward movement stopped, but
when he lateralled to Barlow, he
was still off the ground, say at 45
degrees.
A tardy, or "late" whistle they
might call it.

DEEPER INTO

Bui other things come to light:
For the most part the Stanford
passers and kirkers are well pro
tected, once in a while given enough
time to pick their noses before get
ting the ball away.
Santa Clara was down on kicks
much faster than the Stanford line.
Tom Collin.? deserves credit for his
handling that quick kick. The boy

' played it right and got himself back
I there.
Matthews made some great
shoulder blocks on his pulling out
plays, but he also looked like a high
diver on some The Stanford line on
running offensive needs, they say.
seasoning.
Two interesting things seemed to
get the attention of the crowd—Mat
i thevs and Ferko on defense never
charged at the same time; first one
would get away first and then the
other, sometimes by good margins.
The other incident got good guf
' faws—Pavelko was tackled in the
; second quarter, and while lying on
his back waiting for the whistle, he
held the ball up waiting for a pos
sible lateral receiver. Well, the first
receiver to appear was Callaway
pouncing in on him. Pavelko sucked
in that ball like a long lost child.
Most of all, (hough, it showed that
the Stanford guys, not having much
experience in big league ball, need
, just that. They gotta get so they can

line or out and meet him in the right
place, as a matter of instinct.
