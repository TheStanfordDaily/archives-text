### 
POLO GROUNDS, NEW YORK.
Sept. 30 (U.P.) — Undaunted by
drenching rain and the big guns that
faced him, Carl HubbelJ, the long,
lean, mound magician from Meeker,
Okla., today pitched the New York
Giants to a 6-1 victory over the
floundering Yankees in the opening
game of the subway world series.
With rain driving down on his
hunched shoulders, Hubbell stood
out there on the little mountain of
mud that was the mound and his
slender arm rose and fell for nine
lull innings against nine men who
were considered the most dangerous
batting array ever assembled.
In winning this, his 17th straight
victory of 1936 and his 27th of the
season, the most valuable player in
the National League yielded seven
hits to the highly - touted Yankee
batsmen, and one lone run—the re
sult of George "Twinkle-toes'' Sel
kirk's homer in the third.
