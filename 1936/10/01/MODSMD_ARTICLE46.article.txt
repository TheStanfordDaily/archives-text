# Water Poloists Out To Regain Coast Crown
## Veterans Form Nucleus For Promising Squad 
### 
Nurt Thornton, Stanford's genial
water pool mentor, is getting ready
to seek vengeance on other coast
teams this year.
Until last year, the Indian water
poloists had only lost three battles
in 22 years of competition. That
"until last year" phrase refers to the
Cardinal's first disastrous year, at
least in the eyes of Ma - . Thornton.
His men only lost two games
apiece to Cal and U.C.L.A., winning
all the rest, but it wasn't a confer
ence championship, and that's what
spells success for any Stanford
water polo squad.
Mr. Thornton has reason to be
optimistic about this year's team
as it will be almost entirely made
up of veterans, with such men as
Captain Bob Haslacher, returning
to take over goalie duties, Chuck
Griffin, Ben Voss, Don Peterson,
Jack Loupe, and Pat Pearson to
pick from for the three guard posi
tions, and Bob Hoover, Jack Vibert,
and Bill Hanna at forwards.
John Lamb, last year's sensational
triple threat m;in of frosh water
polo fame, leads the list of promis
ing newcomers, and will be a serious
contender for a first string spot.
The Indians go in for night water
polo in their season's opener against
the Athens Club October 12 in En
cina Pool, x and tangle with U.C.L.A.,
defending coast champs, in the initial
conference test on October 16 in
the local pools.
