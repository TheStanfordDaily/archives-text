# Thornhill Explains Failure Of Aerial Attack Saturday
## 
### 
Tiny slid his new multicolored cap
back on his head and began to an
swer a question, the same question
he's been answering all week â€”
what's the chief reason Stanford's

passing was so
rotten last week
end, and what
about same on
Saturday?
''There were
two main things
haywire against
Santa Clara,"
Tiny explained.
"First, our ends
weren't getting
out. Second, our
passers were
watching the in
coming linesmen,
instead of the re-

J ceivers. That's the whole thing in a
nutshell."
Tiny went on to explain that on
! the first couple of plays the passes
went fairly well, that is, until a
i couple of hard charging Bronc line
| men sent a couple of inexperienced
| pass throwers sprawling all over the
j lot.
| A passer is apt to watch the ball,
| eager to see if it finds its goal. And
at that time he's perfect meat for the
anemic 200-pound tackle who loves
j to find a back off balance, eagerly
peering after a twirling pigskin,
j And, therefore, it's not difficult to
! see why, with the exception of those
first few plays, Stanford passers
paid too much attention to the oppo
-1 sition's line.
"What about passes at Washington
State, Tiny?"
J "We'll probably use just as many,
but they'll go off better this time.
Washington has a powerful line so
passes will be one of our big hopes.
These fellows in our backfield will
feel a lot more at home Saturday."
"Will we beat Washington State?"
we finally asked, putting the genial
Thornhill on the proverbial spot.
But Tiny chose to politely parry
this one. "Well, I can't say. We'il
i give 'em a good game."
