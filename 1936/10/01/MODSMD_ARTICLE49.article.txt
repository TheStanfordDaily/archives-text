# Varsity, Papoose Soccermen Hold Initial Workouts
## Many Veterans Return; Frosh Turnout Small 
### 
With the signup for both frosh
and varsity soccer completed in
Etlcina gym yesterday afternoon,
Coach Harry Maloney and his chief
assistant, Dick Buliis, iook forward
to a bright season in conference
play. Varsity men came out par
ticularly strong in numbers and
quality, with twelve lettermen back
to bolster the Cardinal forces, The
freshman squad is small, and as yet
unproven, so there are ample op
portunities, according to Buliis, for
freshman to come out and earn their
numerals.
Only apparent weakness on the
varsity appears at the fullback posi
tions, where a lack of ample sub
stitutes may make it tough at times
during the season. Richardson, let -
terman from last year, rugged and
dependable, is the only letterman
out for either of the two fullback
posts, but Ben and Frank Day,
brother act on the frosh last year,
are figured to be in there.

Three lettermen, Dave Sloane, Bob
Hull, and Dick Hanna, practically
have the left, center, and right half
positions sewed up. and are three of
the cau-es for Bullis' elation, while

the front line, with Nightingale at
left wing, Rasmu.ssen at left inside.
Dibblee at center, Knecht at right
inside, and Schuupp at rk-ht win; .
is well fortified.
