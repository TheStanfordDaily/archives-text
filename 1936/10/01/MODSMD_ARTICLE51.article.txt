# The 						B.A.C. Means Business

### 
As a result of the turmoil caused by the lack
of rooter's tickets for the Big Game last fall, the
Board of Athletic Control along with The Daily
attempted to impress on the students the neces
sity of buying their rooter's tickets as soon as
they were announced on sale.
But again this fall, the B.A.C. has heard growl
ings from students about the management of
ticket sales. In answer, Don Liebendorfer,
B.A.C. nev/s director, made the following state
ment to The Daily in an effort to definitely settle
the matter for the remainder of the year:
"We have had two sources of gripes from
students today on the subject of the rooter's
tickets, to wit: 1. The price—sl.lo. 2. That the
rooters' sale is being held too early. Here's the
explanation. The price is exactly the same as it
has been for years and is in accordance with our
agreement with Southern California. We are
holding the sale so early because we can not
start allotting other tickets —alumni, Block "S,"
etc., until we know the exact size of the rooting
section. We don't wish to be caught short with
too few tickets for student rooters, nor do we
wish to have a bunch of tickets left right in the
middle of the field after we have started al
lotting poorer seats to the earliest applicants in
the preferred lists."
