This is the last quarter that Professor Edward
Maslin Hulme will teach European Thought and
Culture.
After 16 years of teaching at Stanford, he be
comes emeritus at the end of this year. To some
of this community, this nas little significance,
to others it has much.
Because European Thought and Culture is
more than a course, it is an experience, and Pro
fessor Hulme is more than a Professor, he is an
artist.
I don't think there was any clause in Dr.
Hulme's contract which said that when he lec
tured he would have to interest students.
But he chose to interest them. He realized that
it was necessary to interest before it was pos
sible to instruct, and he was able to interest be
cause he had something to say.
There is a flavor about a Hulme course. A
student feels that here, for the first time, there is
the authentic, the original model of the college
professor.
Professor Hulme is inspirational because he
is not convinced that the college student is a
dumb brute, incapable of feeling and sentiment.
And because he is not convinced, many a stu
dent has found himself in his course, capable
of feeling and sentiment, desiring to know, for
the first time in 15 years or so of uninspired
academic drudgery.
I sometimes wonder if that isn't what a col
lege professor is for. \
