# The Usual Disaster Strikes

### 
When we first heard that Professor Thomas
Bailey had taken a leave of absence and de
parted for George Washington University, some
one in ihe group commented: "Oh, oh, Stanford
loses another good professor," and nodded his
head as if to say that Stanford couldn't afford to
lose many more.
Of course, it is only a leave of absence, and
there is no assurance that Professor Bailey won't
return. Still, there is a fear there. Professor
Bailey was a very popular lecturer.
Coupled with the news that this is Professor
Hulme's last year, the tendency is to say, as
some have said, that Stanford is being sapped
of its teaching faculty, that the outstanding pro
fessors are being lured away from the Farm by
offers in the East.
Some years ago, Berkeleyites crowed when a
survey made in the East credited them with a
great many more known scientists than Stan
ford. For which, the comeback has been: "What
is the difference, how many scientists there are
on the faculty, if the students don't get to know
them?" Research scientists are necessary for
the advancement of civilization, but students
trained to think are even more necessary in or
der that a cultured body of citizenry is built up
to be a recipient of the research.

I don't think Stanford's educational problems
are principally the lack of faculty brain power.
Stanford has certain advantages in holding its
faculty. Not the least of these are climate and
pleasant working conditions.
The wage differential is not such that it leads
to a great inducement, except in the matter of
promotions to better positions elsewhere. There
is a differential for some of the professors who
like to be closer to the great libraries and re
search archives in the East. Stanford has given
many professors to other colleges, who have
distinguished themselves in helping to build up
other schools. This does not hurt Stanford's
reputation at all.
She still has many professors at home, build
ing up departments here. She also has ob
tained young professors from other schools
-who are doing the same thing. I have seldom
heard a serious student go begging for a good
course. Rather, the problem has been how to
fit in all the courses he would like to takeâ€”a
serious student, that is.
Stanford's educational problem is not one of
faculty brains. She could use more, but so could
other schools. The answer to the Californian's
crowing is: "Can Stanford, with her smaller stu
dent body, her position as a residence univer
sity, her independence from the state legislature
at Sacramento, better utilize those faculty
brains?"
Can she?
