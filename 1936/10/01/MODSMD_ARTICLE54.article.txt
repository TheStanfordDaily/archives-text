LET'S DO THE LOYVDOWN WITH LANDON
Back in 1933, a Secretary stepped into the office of
Mr. Roosevelt, just starting his first day in his new
job.
"Mr. President," said the minion, "there are 9,000,000
people in America this fine morning waiting for break
fast. They have no money. They have no jobs. Nev
ertheless, there are 9,000,000 people this fine morning
vho want breakfast. Shall I appoint a commission
to study the situation, or serve the doughnuts and
coffee."

It is now 11 o'clock the same morning. In walks a
representative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He
hasn't the circumspection of the secretary. He says,
"For God's sake do something, Mr. President. Business
is out on its feet. We're losing our shirts. (The gentle
man had lost his pants four years previously.) Are
you going to do something, Mr. Roosevelt, or abandon
us to disaster."

Mr. President fed the unemployed. And Mr. Presi
dent also threw a lifeline to business. Being just a
theoretical Democrat, he naturally didn't spend two or
three years debating. He did what he could as fast as
he could do it.
Being just a dumb Democrat, he also didn't put a
bunch of boys to work finding out if his relief to the
nation agreed with the Constitution. And neither busi
ness nor the unemployed asked him to. One wanted
food, the other wanted help, Constitution or no Consti
tution, waste or no waste.

Mr. Roosevelt, being just a lousy Democrat, had a
pretty fair idea why business was out on its feet, why
the unemployed needed federal doughnuts and coffee.
So, being stupid, he attempted to not only give America
a temporary pain-deadener, but to find out where the
pain came from.
And that was O.K. with the gentleman who lost his
pants and shirt and the guy who wanted the breakfast.
It was all right, that is, until the gentleman bought a
new pair of pants and a new shirt, and the guy could
buy his own breakfast.
Then, suddenly, plain clothes and breakfast weren't
enough. The gentleman had to have an economic tux
edo, just like the one he had in 1929. And the guy had
to have not doughnuts and coffee, but shirred eggs and
chicken livers. Mr.- Roosevelt said no, largely because
the gentleman couldn't pay for his tuxedoes and shirred
eggs gave the guy indigestion.

And is Roosevelt a bum! Is he a Communist! Is he
an inefficient so-and-so! â€”Bob Eisenbach
