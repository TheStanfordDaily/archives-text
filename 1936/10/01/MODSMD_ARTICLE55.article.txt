# OUR HASHER

### 
Jim Reynolds in his talk to the Encinamen last
Saturday night, may or may not have pledged any of
them to Toyon or Branner, but anyhow Our Hasher,
being another impartial, unbiased Republican will en
deavor to carry on the good work.
Now it is an oft-mouthed phrase that eating clubs
have some of the features of fraternities, though why
this should be anything to be proud of, nobody seems
to know. An eating club, it is said, has the binding
ties of fraternities without the ceremonies and para
phernalia. Then, too, there is the consideration that
you do not have to sleep in a kennel. There has been,
however, more than one horse in Sequoia.
About this tie that binds, there is'need for some
discussion.
Last spring at the El Toro bindery there was one
tie that was bound for trouble. He was just like a
feather in the breeze. He kept getting in everybody's
hair. During one particularly moist dinner session
about finals time, the gentleman in question dried
himself behind the ears and began plotting to lead one
of his opponents out in the hills and there abandon
him without benefit of clothing. So he drew several
members into the plot, and they all concurred with
alacrity.
The several members, however, decided that jus
tice lay with the other side, so they took the worthy
opponent into the plot. And there was a pretense
made of binding up the worthy opponent. The tie
binder took his own car. showing the gentleman how
its remarkable ignition system worked, and protesting
every time that someone suggested that they were car
rying the kicking and struggling opponent far enough
away from the campus.
Finally (to make the story short, yes, yes, go on)
they arrived at a place mutually satisfactory. They
suddenly turned upon the tie-binder, who was quite
shocked at the perfidy, stripped him of all clothing, left
one shoe and one pair of shorts high up in an oak
tree, and drove home in his car.
It is said that late that night, little ladies in La
gunita and Roble tittered behind drawn blinds, as a
feather breezed past.

ties of fraternities without the ceremonies and para
phernalia. Then, too, there is the consideration that
you do not have to sleep in a kennel. There has been,
however, more than one horse in Sequoia.
About this tie that binds, there is'need for some
discussion.
Last spring at the El Toro bindery there was one
tie that was bound for trouble. He was just like a
feather in the breeze. He kept getting in everybody's
hair. During one particularly moist dinner session
about finals time, the gentleman in question dried
himself behind the ears and began plotting to lead one
of his opponents out in the hills and there abandon
him without benefit of clothing. So he drew several
members into the plot, and they all concurred with
alacrity.
The several members, however, decided that jus
tice lay with the other side, so they took the worthy
opponent into the plot. And there was a pretense
made of binding up the worthy opponent. The tie
binder took his own car. showing the gentleman how
its remarkable ignition system worked, and protesting
every time that someone suggested that they were car
rying the kicking and struggling opponent far enough
away from the campus.
Finally (to make the story short, yes, yes, go on)
they arrived at a place mutually satisfactory. They
suddenly turned upon the tie-binder, who was quite
shocked at the perfidy, stripped him of all clothing, left
one shoe and one pair of shorts high up in an oak
tree, and drove home in his car.
It is said that late that night, little ladies in La
gunita and Roble tittered behind drawn blinds, as a
feather breezed past.

Now it is an oft-mouthed phrase that eating clubs
have some of the features of fraternities, though why
this should be anything to be proud of, nobody seems
to know. An eating club, it is said, has the binding
