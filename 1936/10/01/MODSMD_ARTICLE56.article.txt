Going on'its fourth week at the
Geary Theater in San Francisco is
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's adaptation
of Romeo and Juliet, Leslie How
ard and Norma Shearer starred.
Memorable not only because it
was Irving Thalberg's last produc
tion, the film is a conscious, and
critics say successful, attempt to
translate Shakespeare to the screen.
The poet's own lines have been for
the large part preserved. Technical
directors and Shakespearean au
thorities have worked for two years
on the production, produced sets,
lighting effects that no stage could
duplicate. Seats for the two daily
performances scale from 55 cents to
$1.45, and must be reserved.
Meet My Sister, a musical com
edy concerned with the activities of
a French countess and a psychology
professor ends its first week at the
Alcazar. Ralph Benatzky has writ
ten the music, Walter Slezak, Olive
Olsen, and Harry Welsh furnish the
comedy, Nancy McCord, the ro
mance.

China Clipper (W. 8.) at the Stan- I
ford.
History is seldom less interesting!
| than fiction. More memorable than
Warner Brothers' rather sentimental
j story of the China Clipper and its !
flight would be a film of the actual
events leading to its take-off.
i Pat O'Brien has a vision of things
i to come, leaves a safe land job to I
construct airplanes and to map out
airlines through Latin America. He j
j is aided by his three friends, Henry
Walthall, Ross Alexander, and Huni
: phrey Bogart. Deserted by his wife,
refused by his backer, O'Brien forges
! on, ruthlessly driving friends and
employees.
Most remarkable are the pictures
of the China Clipper steaming out of
the Golden Gate along its foggy, tor
tuous flight. "Pop," the designer,
dies of overwork before the flight is
completed. But the goal is accom
plished. Last scene shows Pat O'- ;
Brien looking out on San Francisco I
bay, mulling over plans for regular j
trans-Atlantic clipper service. '

Memorable not only because it
was Irving Thalberg's last produc
tion, the film is a conscious, and
critics say successful, attempt to
translate Shakespeare to the screen.
The poet's own lines have been for
the large part preserved. Technical
directors and Shakespearean au
thorities have worked for two years
on the production, produced sets,
lighting effects that no stage could
duplicate. Seats for the two daily
performances scale from 55 cents to
$1.45, and must be reserved.
Meet My Sister, a musical com

ten the music, Walter Slezak, Olive
Olsen, and Harry Welsh furnish the
comedy, Nancy McCord, the ro
mance.

China Clipper (W. 8.) at the Stan- I
ford.
History is seldom less interesting!
| than fiction. More memorable than
Warner Brothers' rather sentimental
j story of the China Clipper and its !
flight would be a film of the actual
events leading to its take-off.
i Pat O'Brien has a vision of things
i to come, leaves a safe land job to I
construct airplanes and to map out
airlines through Latin America. He j
j is aided by his three friends, Henry
Walthall, Ross Alexander, and Huni
: phrey Bogart. Deserted by his wife,
refused by his backer, O'Brien forges
! on, ruthlessly driving friends and
employees.
Most remarkable are the pictures
of the China Clipper steaming out of
the Golden Gate along its foggy, tor
tuous flight. "Pop," the designer,
dies of overwork before the flight is
completed. But the goal is accom
plished. Last scene shows Pat O'- ;
Brien looking out on San Francisco I
bay, mulling over plans for regular j
trans-Atlantic clipper service. '
