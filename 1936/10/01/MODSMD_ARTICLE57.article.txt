The content of this letter continues
that I mailed in my previous letters
—the last May 12, 1936, at the above
address to the Students and Faculty
of Stanford University, California.
I do place the message and docu
ment in your hands—it shall become !
property with the Stanford Univer- ,

by me and treat your copy as your
property,—it is the wish that the
paper by me written in part or as a

paper by me written message of 1
