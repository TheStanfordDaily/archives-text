# Council Decides Liquor Policy
## Knowledge of Ruling Is Urged by Chairman 
### 
Women's Council, in their first
regular meeting of the year yester
day, took a definite stand on the
drinking question and announced
their policy concerning the posses
sion or use of liquor by Stanford
women.
A statement issued to Jill new
women by the council read as fol
lows: "Women's Council upholds the
University regulation regarding the
possession or use of liquor on the
campus. Off-campus it is expected
that at all times conduct becoming
a Stanford woman will be main
tained. This means that a Stanford
woman whose conduct in ;iny way
brings discredit upon herself or
the University will be subject to
expulsion. It seems to us that this
kind of conduct is self-evident and
needs no further definition."
Lock-out regulations were also
discussed at the meeting and the
late-leave system placed in work
ing order. Lock-out clerks of all
living groups met with the Council
and received instructions concerning
their duties.
Urging all women to obtain a
thorough knowledge of the social
rules, Mary Belford, Chairman of
Women's Council, stated that "Coun
cil hopes all returning students will
re-read the social regulations and
refresh their memory on all doubt
ful points."
A survey made by the Dean of
Women's office last year revealed
the fact that many new women were
better acquainted wi{.h the rules than
those who had been in attendance at
the University for several years.
