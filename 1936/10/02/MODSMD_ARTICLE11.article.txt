### 
(Special to The Daily)
SAN JOSE. Oct. I.â€”While liquor
code enforcement officers liave been
maintaining a constant vigil in the
peninsula area, reports of alleged
trouble in their own ranks are being
investigated in court.
Yesterday in San Jose members of
the Donihuc Assembly Audit Com
mittee, who are now probing liquor
conditions made the charge that an
organized shakedown plan, assert
ed!y intsituted by a law enforce
ment officer and a San Jose attor
ney, has been in operation. The j
opening session of the probe saw
J. C. Corbett, a San Francisco mem
ber of the State Board of Equaliza
tion, questioned regarding his oust- !
ing of Jerry O'Brien, former inves- J
tigator.
Acting as special council for the j
committeemen. Leo R. Friedman led i
the cross-examination and sought to j
prove the shakedown charge. He
first brought to the stand Dave Sala !
and Rex Fuller, liquor code enforc- |
crs, who testified that Mrs. Amelia
Bechis, proprietor of an establish
ment selling alcoholic drinks, had !
told them that she was warned not j
to sell liquor after 2 a.m. The fol
lowing day, the officers added, Mrs. |
Bechis was telephoned by W. D. j
Foley, San Jose attorney, v/ho of-1
fered to "square things" for $150.
Mrs. Bechis, however, denied the en- !
tire story in court.
Friedman then turned his atten
tion to Frank Lacerda, grocer, who
readily admitted having been ar- i
rested for possession of untaxed
liquor. Lacerda emphatically denied
the charge that he paid Foley $1000
"to fix certain people." He subse-'
quently declared, however, that he
gave the attorney $250 and paid a i
fine of $50.
Friedman next asked Corbett to t
explain why he retained Ray Hicks :
as chief enforcement officer for over
a year, despite the fact that Hicks i
had been arrested for drunk driving,'
but ousted O'Brien almost imme-1
diately. Corbett replied that O'Brien 1
was guilty of insubordination in
making an earlier statement "that he
was running the office and Corbett'
could, go to hell."
A total of 54 witnesses have been
subpoenaed and the probe will prob
ably continue through tomorrow.
