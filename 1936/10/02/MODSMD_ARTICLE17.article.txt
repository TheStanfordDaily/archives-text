# Current Events Class Considered
## 
### 
The new one-unit, plus-minus
current events course proposed by
A.S.S.U. candidates last spring may
or may not be one step nearer reality
when it goes before a faculty board
for consideration this afternoon.
Representatives of the social sci
ence department—Edwin A. Cottrell,
professor of political science; Chil
ton n. Bush, professor of journalism;
and Philip W. Buck, assistant profes
i sor of political science — will pass
j upon the advisability of making the
study an accredited University
I course.
If passed, all students may take
I the course for credit, hear pertinent
talks once a week by professors upon
current events relating to their par
i ticular fields.
