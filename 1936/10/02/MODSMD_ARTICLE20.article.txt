Although El Capitan and El Cua
dro now share a dining hall in com
mon, Burt Goodman, president of the
former eating club, does not think
there will be any hijacking by one
club toward nuggets of the other.
The two organizations were com
pelled to double up when the most
freshmen in Stanford's history ex
hausted the facilities of Encina Com
mons. What used to be El Cuadro's
room will be added to the Commons

The room has been divided down

Although Ihcy eat together, the
societies conduct their meetings sep
arately. Rushing goes on as usual
