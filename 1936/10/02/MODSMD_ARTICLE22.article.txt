# Single, Double Wingback, Varied Shifts, Listed Among Achievements

### Herb Diamond 
There has been a great deal I
talk circulated in these parts ii
about the enviable qualities and ri
produced by Mr. Babe Hollingbei
talents of a certain football tej
at Washington State. Mr. Hollin
berry, it seems, has equipped 1
men with not only a single line sh.
but also a double line shift, not on
a single wingback formation but abo
a double wingback formation besidt ;
a punt formation.
Ace Gridder
Moreover, these same gridders
have speed, and they have power;
thoy are big and they charge fast
and low; they have an ace quarter
back in Goddard; they can pass; and
they have a goodly supply of re
serves and everything else they need
besides the pigskin itself to play
football.
Now all this may be so. As a mat
ter of fact, Coach Ben Winkelman of
the Stanford mentor staff will bear
it out for the most part and he ought
to know because he scouted Mr.
liollingberry's team.
But the Washington Staters can't
transform all of their plain and fancy
talents into action at the same time

, and it's going to take more talking
i than all the citizens of Pullman,

little action on the part of Mr. Hol

1 some pretty determined Indians off
; the Cougars' trail tomorrow after
noon.

It should be pointed out, further
| more, that even in the face of all the
laudatory journalistic literature on
the subject of Washington State, and
all the verbal praise, Scout. Winkel
man himself has dared to inform
Thornhill and the press that "We can
win that ball game!" He can't be
blamed for becoming more confiden-
I tial on the subject of how that feat,
can be accomplished, but it may well
: be presumed that such a statement
would not be made without definite
planning and forethought.
Here on the Farm the Cardinals
have been busy on the practice turf
all (his week, in fact they were busy
until just a few minutes before train
time yesterday afternoon, and Ihcy
will be busy in Portland's Multno
mah Stadium this afternoon. They've
been concentrating far into the
evening on passing, line building,
and speed and they have scrim
maged intensively against the Win
kclman-t rained Grays, (ho quarter
hack of which they have even gone
so far as to dub "Ed Goddard."
Hamilton at Full
As to the starting lineup for to
morrow's tussle, Thornhill has indi
cated that he will probably use
■ Glenn Hamilton at full, hoping in
j experience that caused most of the
passes to go haywire in the Santa
; Clara encounter last week will be
partially remedied. Jimmy Coffis
apparently in fine condition o; e'e
| again, will return to left half. And
