RAIN: NO GAME
The Yc nkees, I hear, lost the first j
game oi' the World Series Wednes
day.
Perhaps they, too, gave away tre- !
mendous odds and bet money on j
themselves. If they didn't, the !
Yanks should feel sorry, for their j
own sake, for the people who did. j
James J. Jeffries, as I remember, j
once intimated that a great number i
of sporting Americans never forgave j
him the famous fadeaway to Jack j
Johnson. Max Baer had considerable |
to do with redistribution of wealth
when he fought Joe Louis, and for j
that matter, the colored people's re
ception of Joe Louis after the sports
writers began to call him the brown
bubble was probably closely tied up
with such matters as suckers' odds I
and suckers' money.
With (he second game rained out I
yesterday, the day of reckoning forj
(he Yankees has been postponed 24
hours, and they will doubdess dream
for many nights about that crazy
eighth inning when everything was
bouncing around like a golf ball in a
barrel. To us westerners, it was'
reminiscent of that famous Califor- j
nia-U.S.C. game of 1930 when every j
Trojan play was a touchdown, while i
(tie toll ran up to 74-0 and rumors
floated about that the last period was j
cut short to keep the score under a i
hundred.

Bill Leiser of the San Francisco
Chronicle remarked when Charles
ATacArlhur's letters to his wife,
-I'.len Hayes, were brought into
court when she was'sued for aliena
lion of affections, that it was good to
■ c ■ a newspaper man use "tweet -
urns" and "sugarpie" just because it
broke down the big, bold, tough man j
llieory about newspaper reporters.;
And it is good to see a team which
;ad a tremendous reputation for be- j
i:ig :u per men break into pieces like |

Too long have the Americans been !
I 'd one big dish of pap after another]
bout » professional athletic teams i
auctioning with the uncanny and;
i radically flawless precision of a i
i am-slicer. John J. McGraw, de
feased Little Napoleon of the
> Hants, who are doing better now
lan they did at many times under |
I is rule of the mailed fist, was no

doubt responsible for spreading this
theory about baseball playei's by his
profound analyses of great, and
lucky, world series plays.

I do not gloat over the temporary
slip of the mighty's foot for sheer
malice alone. Rather. I am glad on
the general principle that a super
man is a myth and exploding the
myth holds a promise of a more
abundant life for us duffers who
know muscular co-ordination only
as two words in the dictionary.
I doubt if the game of bridge was
ever more encouraged generally
than during the famous Culbertson-
Lenz battle for glory and publicity.
The arrangement for super-scien
tific kibitzing was the only place
where the experts were superior.
The press remarked the qual
ity of the bridge was no better, and
the beefing between partners no
less, than at a Saturday night bridge
party with the neighbors next door.
