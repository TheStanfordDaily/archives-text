# Cal Campus Upset By 'Raw' Natating

Nude bathing struck the Califor
nia campus yesterday but dignity
had been restored before the day was
over. However, student swains with
pretty girls* for their companions
were still carefully avoiding the foot
bridge that spans Strawberry Creek,
ordinarily one of the scenic spots of
the campus.
The university scandal started
when a Berkeley patrolman took
into custody two of the three indi
viduals engaged in a mixed swim
iming party in the creekâ€”in the
nude and in broad daylight.
Rather than booking the culprits
on an indecency charge, the Berke
ley officer recommended a spanking
for both the nudist swimmers, who,
happily or unhappily, were only four
years old.
