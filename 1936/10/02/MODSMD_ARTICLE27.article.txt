# Morris Concluding Water Policy Study
## 
### 
Professor Samuel B. Morris, dean
of the engineering school, is rapidly
completing an outline of a water
resources policy for the Pacific
.Northwest which will bo incorpo
rated in a national report to be de
livered to President Roosevelt De
cember 1.
Professor Morris spent most of the
summer in the Northwest region
directing a survey of water resouices
in a district which contains 40 per
cent of the potential water power of
the country. The national report
will be used to determine a long-run
policy in regard to flood control,
power, irrigation, and stream pollu
tion.
