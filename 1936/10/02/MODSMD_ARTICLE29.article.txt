# 'Ruthie' Says Frosh Femininity 'Soph'-isticated and Viewsome
## Switchboard Autocrat Labels Roble Girls As Ultra-fine Group 
### 
"This is the best-looking freshman i
class I have ever seen," asserted
I "Ruthi?," "but then I : ay that every j
] year for publication." Thus Mrs.
! Marian Ruth, long-time switchboard j
j operator at Roble and campus no- !
table, catalogued the '40 crop.
The redoubtable switchboard au- ,
tocrat, whose breezy lingo and in- >
: sight into the private lives of Roble
dwellers is a campus legend, con- |
i tinued, "One thing I can say about
j this bunch though, is that ihey are
( more sophisticated than usual. Why,
j with a good imagination you might,
| even mistake them for sophs."
"Ruthie," whose scarlet fingertips j
; have twinkled over the boards at 1
( Roble transmitting approximately)
four hundred calls per day for six |
years, thinks that this class tops j
i previous years for phone call aver- j
| ages.
When asked if she thought the j
current freshmen were terrific, the |
operator murmured, "Hmmm, so i
Jorgi put you up to this, did he?" {
And then "Ruthie" murmured some-.L
thing else that this interviewer did |
t not quite catch.
Meanwhile, Gus, shoeshine boy at |
Encina and generally a good place j
to find out what you don't know, j
hasn't heard any of the frosh men j
yelling about how good or how bad I
or how anything the frosh women'
are.
"It's a little early yet," says Gus, I
"but maybe things will pick up after I
the week-end."
It would follow that perhaps the j
| frosh men aren't talking about the ,
women — that might be a sign of ,
something, and again it might-not. j
