II past trends hold true, that :
beautiful babe sitting on the library
steps will soon be a dissatisfied
school teacher.
At least, that is the conclusion to ,
be drawn from replies to a question- \
naire sent all Stanford alumna of the
classes of 1929 to 1933.
Statistics compiled Irom the ques- '
tionnaire for a master's thesis in
education by Miss Virginia Swanson
indicate that the "average alumna" ,
is a school teacher, most likely of j
literature or language, and is dis
satisfied with her job.
If she is married, there is a 50-50
chance her husband is a Stanford
graduate too, and her leisure time is
taken up with politics, welfare
work, reading, and music.
If she hasn't caught a husband yet,
then her leisure preferences are
music, athletics, and reading, in the
order named. The single women in
dicated a strong liking for athletics;!
the married ones, having caught up!
with their man, did not.
