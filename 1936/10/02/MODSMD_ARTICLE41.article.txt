# Chief Executive Still In Madrid; Explains Reason for Civil War
## 
### 
MADRID, Oct. I.â€”Spain's bloody
civil war, which has cost more than
140,000 dead in 11 weeks, would
have ended long ago if foreign
powers had not supplied the rebels
with arms and airplanes, President
Manuel Azana of Spain told the
United Press today in an exclusive
interview at the National Palace.
The chief executive, who seemed
to care little what people say about
him, is close-mouthed so far as the
press is concerned. He has refused
ever since he was made president
on May 10. When rumors were
spread by rebels that he had fled
from Madrid he granted the inter
view. "I have conceded this inter
view because I have wanted you to
see that I am here in Madrid," he
said.
When told that the world seemed
to regard his government as a Red
government and that it was charged
the loyalists were fighting for Com
munism he became vehement.
"That is absurd," he declared em
phatically, waving his hands for
added emphasis. "This talk about
Reds is silly. The government is
fighting for political liberty. We are
not fighting for Communism or So
cialism."
