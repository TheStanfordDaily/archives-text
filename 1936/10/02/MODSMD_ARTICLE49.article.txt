# 'Tab' Magazine Supplement To Appear Monday
## 
### 
Monday's Daily will be of a
handier size for dipping in the
breakfast coffee or prune juice.
Reflecting a trend toward the
neat but not gaudy, the next
Daily will appear with a five
column news-magazine instead
of the regular paper.
Containing feature articles,
pictures, fiction, and non-fic
tion, The Daily's magazine will
become a weekly feature if the
first one proves successful.
In this Monday's issue there
will appear an article by Dr.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, head
of the history department, on
the presidential campaign, one
by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, new
University chaplain, on a so
phisticate's return to religion,
and an article on the Salinas
lettuce strike and others.
