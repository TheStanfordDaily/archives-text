# Roosevelt Defends Social Security, Fiscal Policy
## Al Smith Breaks With Democrats, Backs Alf 
### 
FORBES FIELD, PITTSBURGH,
Oct. 1. —President" Roosevelt de
fended the New Deal's security pro
gram tonight and renewed his pledge
to "keep the American people from
starvation."
Speaking in this baseball park, the
President's address was filled with
metaphors of baseball. He defended
his fiscal policy by saying "to bal
ance the budget in 1933 for 1934 or
1 #35 would have been a crime
against the American people."
Policy Reversed
"In 1933," Mr. Roosevelt said, "wo
reversed the policy of the previous
administration. For the first time
since ihe depression, we had a Con
gress and an Administration in
Washington which had the courage
to provide the necessary resources
which private interests no longer
had or no longer dared to risk.
"A b?seball park i 3 i. guud place
to talk about box scores. Tonight I
am going to talk to you about the
box score of the government of the
United States. I am going to tell you
of the story of the fight to bring
recovery and beat down the depres
sion and win recovery. From where
I stand it looks as though the game
is pretty well in the bag.
"I am convinced that when gov
c rnment. finance or any other finance
is honest—and when all the cards arc
on the table—there are no higher
mathematics about it. It is just
plain scoreboard arithmetic.
"When the present management of
your team took charge, the national
scoreboard looked pretty bad. In
fact, it looked so much like a shut
out that you voted a change of man
agement in order to give the coun
try a chance to win the game. And
today we are winning it."

! CARNEGIE HALL, N.Y., Oct. I.—
Alfred E. Smith broke his lifelong
tie with the Democratic party to
i night when he endorsed Governor
| All' M. Landon, Republican candi
| date, for President of the United
| States.
"I humbly believe," Smith shouted,
| "that the remedy for all the ills we
are suffering from today is the elec
i tion of Alfred M. Landon."
Audience Approves
He was speaking to an audience
bedecked in Landon sunflowers, an
audience that cheered every attack
on the New Deal, and came out of
j its chairs yelling approval of Smith's
1 bolting the Democratic party for
the first time in his long political
I career.
It was a hard-hitting .speech that
! spared no one, not even the Presi
! dent of the United States, who for
| merly was a close political ally and
■ personal friend of Smith's.
"L'_ - t it be noted for the record,"
Smith said, "that the present chief
1 executive of the United States,
| whenever he found a dollar outside
i of his salary in the executive man
j sion, argued as a corporation law
j yer in Wall Street."
Questions Roosevelt Aides
Smith was fighting mad, as he dc
! fended himself against the charges
i Hiat he had gone "high-hat." He
l l ipped into the New Deal philosophy
;of government and praised such
Democrats as Senator Carter Glass
i (Virginia) who had expressed dif—
| ferences of opinion with the Roose
! velt administration.
"It occurs to me and it might oc
j cur to you that they should know
1 who the Democratic leaders are. I
j should know who gave of their time
to the party. But I am compelled

lo say, who is Hopkins and who in !
the name of all that is holy is Tug- I
well and where did he blow from?" j
he asked caustically.
PITTSBURGH, Get. 1 UP).—Colo- j
nel Frank Knox, Republican vice- 1
presidential nominee, renewed to-'
night his declaration that the Ad- i
ministration's financial policies leave
"no insurance policy secure, no sav- J
ings account safe."
"This is not a matter of the future.
It is here now," said Colonel Knox
in an address prepared for delivery
immediately before President Roo- ;
sevelt's campaign speech on another 1
local platform.
"The value of the savings dollars i
and the life insurance dollars has
been cut nearly 20 per cent since the j
present Administration took office," (
Knox said. "In addition, the inter
est rate or savings accounts in those
diluted dollars has been reduced . . .
dividends on life insurance policies
have been drastically cut."
"The steady and relentless dilution I
and adulteration of the value of the
savings of the American people by
this Administration have been '
brought to the attention of a hun- :
dred million savers. This witless at- i
tempt to raise a false issue has fo
cused national attention on a real
issue. It has forced the American
people to consider the consequences i
of governmental profligacy."
Colonel Knox, with the President
also in the city to deliver a cam
paign address of his own, repeatedly !
recalled and attacked sentences from j
a speech the President made in a
speech four years ago. A division of |
radio broadcasting time put him on
the air immediately ahead of Roo- i
scvelt.

Alfred E. Smith broke his lifelong
tie with the Democratic party to
i night when he endorsed Governor

"I humbly believe," Smith shouted,
| "that the remedy for all the ills we
are suffering from today is the elec
i tion of Alfred M. Landon."
Audience Approves
He was speaking to an audience
bedecked in Landon sunflowers, an
audience that cheered every attack
on the New Deal, and came out of
j its chairs yelling approval of Smith's
1 bolting the Democratic party for
the first time in his long political
I career.
It was a hard-hitting .speech that
! spared no one, not even the Presi
! dent of the United States, who for
| merly was a close political ally and
■ personal friend of Smith's.
"L'_ - t it be noted for the record,"
Smith said, "that the present chief
1 executive of the United States,
| whenever he found a dollar outside
i of his salary in the executive man
j sion, argued as a corporation law
j yer in Wall Street."
Questions Roosevelt Aides
Smith was fighting mad, as he dc
! fended himself against the charges
i Hiat he had gone "high-hat." He
l l ipped into the New Deal philosophy
;of government and praised such
Democrats as Senator Carter Glass
i (Virginia) who had expressed dif—

in an address prepared for delivery

recovery and beat down the depres
sion and win recovery. From where
I stand it looks as though the game
is pretty well in the bag.
"I am convinced that when gov
c rnment. finance or any other finance
is honest—and when all the cards arc
on the table—there are no higher
mathematics about it. It is just
plain scoreboard arithmetic.
"When the present management of
your team took charge, the national
scoreboard looked pretty bad. In
fact, it looked so much like a shut
out that you voted a change of man

try a chance to win the game. And
today we are winning it."

! CARNEGIE HALL, N.Y., Oct. I.—
Alfred E. Smith broke his lifelong
tie with the Democratic party to
i night when he endorsed Governor
| All' M. Landon, Republican candi
| date, for President of the United
| States.
"I humbly believe," Smith shouted,
| "that the remedy for all the ills we
are suffering from today is the elec
i tion of Alfred M. Landon."
Audience Approves
He was speaking to an audience
bedecked in Landon sunflowers, an
audience that cheered every attack
on the New Deal, and came out of
j its chairs yelling approval of Smith's
1 bolting the Democratic party for
the first time in his long political
I career.
It was a hard-hitting .speech that
! spared no one, not even the Presi
! dent of the United States, who for
| merly was a close political ally and
■ personal friend of Smith's.
"L'_ - t it be noted for the record,"
Smith said, "that the present chief
1 executive of the United States,
| whenever he found a dollar outside
i of his salary in the executive man
j sion, argued as a corporation law
j yer in Wall Street."
Questions Roosevelt Aides
Smith was fighting mad, as he dc
! fended himself against the charges
i Hiat he had gone "high-hat." He
l l ipped into the New Deal philosophy
;of government and praised such
Democrats as Senator Carter Glass
i (Virginia) who had expressed dif—
| ferences of opinion with the Roose
! velt administration.
"It occurs to me and it might oc
j cur to you that they should know
1 who the Democratic leaders are. I
j should know who gave of their time
to the party. But I am compelled

lo say, who is Hopkins and who in !
the name of all that is holy is Tug- I
well and where did he blow from?" j
he asked caustically.
PITTSBURGH, Get. 1 UP).—Colo- j
nel Frank Knox, Republican vice- 1
presidential nominee, renewed to-'
night his declaration that the Ad- i
ministration's financial policies leave
"no insurance policy secure, no sav- J
ings account safe."
"This is not a matter of the future.
It is here now," said Colonel Knox
in an address prepared for delivery
immediately before President Roo- ;
sevelt's campaign speech on another 1
local platform.
"The value of the savings dollars i
and the life insurance dollars has
been cut nearly 20 per cent since the j
present Administration took office," (
Knox said. "In addition, the inter
est rate or savings accounts in those
diluted dollars has been reduced . . .
dividends on life insurance policies
have been drastically cut."
"The steady and relentless dilution I
and adulteration of the value of the
savings of the American people by
this Administration have been '
brought to the attention of a hun- :
dred million savers. This witless at- i
tempt to raise a false issue has fo
cused national attention on a real
issue. It has forced the American
people to consider the consequences i
of governmental profligacy."
Colonel Knox, with the President
also in the city to deliver a cam
paign address of his own, repeatedly !
recalled and attacked sentences from j
a speech the President made in a
speech four years ago. A division of |
radio broadcasting time put him on
the air immediately ahead of Roo- i
scvelt.

Oct. 1. —President" Roosevelt de
fended the New Deal's security pro
gram tonight and renewed his pledge
to "keep the American people from
starvation."
Speaking in this baseball park, the
President's address was filled with
metaphors of baseball. He defended
his fiscal policy by saying "to bal
ance the budget in 1933 for 1934 or
1 #35 would have been a crime
against the American people."
Policy Reversed
"In 1933," Mr. Roosevelt said, "wo
reversed the policy of the previous
administration. For the first time
since ihe depression, we had a Con
gress and an Administration in
Washington which had the courage
to provide the necessary resources
which private interests no longer
had or no longer dared to risk.
