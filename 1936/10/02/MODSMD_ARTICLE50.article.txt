# Sophs Cast Mud Fight Gauntlet
## Blood in Eye, '39 Hopes Freshmen Will Accept 
### 
Anxious to show up the frosh this
year and be the first class in the j
Farm's history to take the annual |
Frosh-Soph Mud Brawl two years in
succession, the sophomores have is- j
sued the yearly challenge to first- j
year men with blood in their eyes.
"If," says Jack Cowan, one of the j
soph co-captains (with emphasis on
the 'if'), "the freshmen wish to ac- '
cept the challenge, let their envoys !
get in touch with either Pete Mc- j
Arthur, A1 Alustiza, or myself as I
soon as they get up enough courage,j
and we will gladly make arrange
ments for the date and hour."
The traditional battle, staged each
year on the freshman football field,
promises to be one of the toughest |
yet, although the Class of '40, with ;
the largest group ever to enter the
university at one time and decorated
with quite an array of huge gentle- j
men who play football, is doped to
win.
The sophs are out to bat the ears
off the freshmen, to use a sophomore
term, and the old do-or-die-for
dear-old-Class-of-'3O spirit may re
sult in more muddy frosh and fewer
muddy sophs. J
