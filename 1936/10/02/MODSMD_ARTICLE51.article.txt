# Kersey Denies Radical Rumor On Education
## California Universities Deficient in Teaching Methods, Said Report 
### 
Vierling Kersey, former state su
perintendent of public instruction,
j recently denied making his much
j publicized statement that training in
j the departments of education at
Stanford and other California uni
versities is inadequate.
"I have been in communication
with Mr. Kersey," said Dr. Grayson
N. Kefauver, dean of the Department
jof Education, "and I am satisfied
j that he made no such statement."
Denies Rumors
At the same time Dr. Kefauver
i declared that the "radical professors
|at Stanford" who oppose the ap
pointment of Dr. Frederick P. Woell
ner of U.C.L.A. as successor to Ker
sey are mythical ones.
"No members of my department,
J so far as I have been able to find,
! even knew of Dr. Woellner's candi
[ dacy for the post. So the red pro
| lessors are non-existent," Kefauver
said.
Kersey's complaint of educational
facilities was supposedly contained
in a report to Governor Merriam last
July.
Department Plans
Dr. Kefauver declined to state
whether the new $525,000 education
J building will fill any need, real or
| fancied. "01' course we have plans
J and aspirations we hope to aceom
) plish; every department has."
i An Associated Press story carried
; the "red professor" quotation of Dr.
| Wcellner vyader a Los Angeles date
i line. Dr. Kefauver said it seemed a
j typical misleading newspaper story.
He said: "Dr. Woellner may have
j been misquoted."
