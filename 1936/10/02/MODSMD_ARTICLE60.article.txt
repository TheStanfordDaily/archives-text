# Papooses Pack Beef, Brawn To Trobabe Tilt
## Coach Confident Frosh Will Defeat S.C. For First Time in 4 Years 
### Tim Sullivan 
While their more publicized var
sity brothers were gathered at the 1
railway promising to skin those
Cougars, the Stanford frosh went j
quietly about their final prepara- ;
tions for the U.S.C. struggle to- i
morrow.
A typical example of the optimistic '
air in the frosh camp was line coach |
Larry Rouble, who seemed con- I
vinced of the truth of his words I
when he said: "These boys are go- i
ing tu be the first to lick the Trojan
Frosh since our bunch turned the |
trick four years ago."
Trobabes Should Be Favored
The southern eleven is reported to ;
have a mania for blocking kicks and
the Shipkey men have been learning j
the art of giving their punter proper j
protection. Gene Coldiron and Chet
Patton have drawn the booting as- |
signment for the local outfit.
Left end Hugh Gallerneau packs
175 pounds around with him when
he goes up in the air after passes, j
Hugh hails from Chicago. Bill Wil
lard, the other wingman, comes from j
Oklahoma and tips the beam at 182. j
Stan Anderson is the fair-haired I
fellow of the first year forward wall. !
Stan, like the famous Pete Zagar, i
makes his home in the woods of
Washington—where he ate enough
bear meat to attain his present -
weight of 220 pounds. A bright fu
ture is predicted for this boy. Bob '
Young, a made-over 210-pound full
back, performs at the other tackle i
post.
Guards are Norman Juney and
Ernest Damarus. Damarus is a Sun j
Diego product and Norman is listed j
as coming from Willows, Calif. Cen- !
ter Hugh Radke weighs 185, hits 'em j
hard, calls Santa Maria his home J
town.
Powerful Ball Packers
Backfield material is plentiful in !
both quality and quantity, and the
four boys who have drawn starting
berth come under the heading of
"pretty good"—or better. They are:
fullback, Chct Patton. a bright bone
battering prospect from Portland;
quarter, Gene Coldiron, 200-pounder
from Washington who has the added i
drive which comes from a crop of !
flaming red hair.
Kansas sends Harold "Bunny"
Wilson to pack the aval .from his j
post, at left half. Swivel - hipped !
Chad Reade plays the safety posi- j
tion and is officially listed as a right i
halfback. Chad learned his football i
at Lowell high in San Francisco.
Mainstays of Coach Hobbs Adams'
potent Trobabe team are Bruce Wil
cox, end; John Thomassin and Russ
Markov, guards; and Phil Gaspar
and Felix Basabe, all-city tackles in
Los Angeles last year. His ball car
riers, each of whom went hog wild
against Riverside last week, are Bill j
Sangster and Doyle Nave, alternate j
quarterbacks.
If it is your desire to know these '
boys better, come around to the j
stadium at 2 o'clock tomorrow.
