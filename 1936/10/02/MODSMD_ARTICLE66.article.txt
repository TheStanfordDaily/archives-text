The townsfolk that attend the
Cardinal-Cougar game in Pullman
tomorrow stand a risk of being driv
en "shift-groggy" during the after
noon, if present indications hold out.
In the old days, the coaches around
the land used to have spats with
each other in the sports sheets about
whether the shift was good strat
egy or no, and whether it was in the
best interests of football or not.
A little history: Pop Warner was
a non-shift man during most of his
Stanford days; his teams trotted
from the huddle to their playing po
sitions, the ball was snapped, and the
play got under way.

JONES A SHIFT MAN
FROM WAY BACK

Howard Jones at U.S.C. always led
the shift contingent, and his teams
went through, and still do, all sorts
of fancy dances and parades after
leaving the huddle and before finally
setting for the lunge. Their set, in
cidentally, nnie times out of ten is
one of two formations, either of
which is played to both right and
left.
Pop used to holler, and often just
ly so, that different teams around
and about would gain momentum on
the shift of position, and hence could
be moving at an advantageous rate
of speed when the ball was snapped.
Recent rules on backfield in mo
tion and on hoidang the ball at least
a full second after the shift before it
is snapped back, however, have elim
inated this argument, and an in
creasing number of teams have come
to practice and use shifts as regular
offensive procedure.
Ben Winkelman has come back
this week with his report on the
Washington State style of attack.
(Incidentally, the northern authori
ties say that Coach Hollingberry
was easing it, that he was concealing
most of his razzle-dazzle power and
saving it for this week.)

COUGARS DO
IT UP RIGHT

Big Ben taught the Cougar offense
to his Reds, and you oughta see it.
("Reds" is a new name for the team
that performs the opposition's plays
in practice here each week. I call
them Reds because they wear red
jerseys, and because they aren't al
ways technically Stanford Grays, the
name heretofore used.)
The Washington Staters have a
varsity of sets —double wingback,
unbalanced line and backfield to
either side, short and long punts,
but the way they hustle through two
or three of them before starting a
play is something great to watch.
You'd think the players, linesmen
especially,' would poop themselves
out before ever getting down for the
lunge. The whole squad, except
center, often changes from 4 and 2
unbalanced left to 4 and 2 unbal
anced right before you can wink an
•eye, with some men running four
steps and shifting over beyond the
next two men.

BUT THORNHILL
CAN STILL COMPETE

And sometimes they do it two or
three times to one play!
Stanford, of course, is no slouch at
shifting. Tiny has his double wing
backs, 4 linemen to either side, single
wings to either side, some balanced
line plays, and specials for punts and
passes, each set designed for a spe
cial offensive move, but also serving
for a variety of weaker plays for
keeping the defense decoyed into
preparation for anything whatever.
And Tiny can slap his guys from
one right into the other and back
again. I tell ya, the two squads may
shift more than they play up there!

Cardinal-Cougar game in Pullman
tomorrow stand a risk of being driv
en "shift-groggy" during the after
noon, if present indications hold out.
In the old days, the coaches around
the land used to have spats with
each other in the sports sheets about
whether the shift was good strat
egy or no, and whether it was in the
best interests of football or not.
A little history: Pop Warner was
a non-shift man during most of his
Stanford days; his teams trotted
from the huddle to their playing po
sitions, the ball was snapped, and the
play got under way.

JONES A SHIFT MAN
FROM WAY BACK

Howard Jones at U.S.C. always led
the shift contingent, and his teams
went through, and still do, all sorts
of fancy dances and parades after
leaving the huddle and before finally
setting for the lunge. Their set, in
cidentally, nnie times out of ten is
one of two formations, either of
which is played to both right and
left.
Pop used to holler, and often just
ly so, that different teams around
and about would gain momentum on
the shift of position, and hence could
be moving at an advantageous rate
of speed when the ball was snapped.
Recent rules on backfield in mo
tion and on hoidang the ball at least
a full second after the shift before it
is snapped back, however, have elim
inated this argument, and an in
creasing number of teams have come
to practice and use shifts as regular
offensive procedure.
Ben Winkelman has come back
this week with his report on the
Washington State style of attack.
(Incidentally, the northern authori
ties say that Coach Hollingberry
was easing it, that he was concealing
most of his razzle-dazzle power and
saving it for this week.)

COUGARS DO
IT UP RIGHT

Big Ben taught the Cougar offense
to his Reds, and you oughta see it.
("Reds" is a new name for the team
that performs the opposition's plays
in practice here each week. I call
them Reds because they wear red
jerseys, and because they aren't al
ways technically Stanford Grays, the
name heretofore used.)
The Washington Staters have a
varsity of sets —double wingback,
unbalanced line and backfield to
either side, short and long punts,
but the way they hustle through two
or three of them before starting a
play is something great to watch.
You'd think the players, linesmen
especially,' would poop themselves
out before ever getting down for the
lunge. The whole squad, except
center, often changes from 4 and 2
unbalanced left to 4 and 2 unbal
anced right before you can wink an
•eye, with some men running four
steps and shifting over beyond the
next two men.

BUT THORNHILL
CAN STILL COMPETE

And sometimes they do it two or
three times to one play!
Stanford, of course, is no slouch at
shifting. Tiny has his double wing
backs, 4 linemen to either side, single
wings to either side, some balanced
line plays, and specials for punts and
passes, each set designed for a spe
cial offensive move, but also serving
for a variety of weaker plays for
keeping the defense decoyed into
preparation for anything whatever.
And Tiny can slap his guys from
one right into the other and back
again. I tell ya, the two squads may
shift more than they play up there!
