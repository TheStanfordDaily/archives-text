# Cross-Country Men Start Practice
## 
### 
With physical exams and registra
tion over, Coaches Dink Templeton
and Bill Ellington look at their
cross-country prospects with a more
relieved feeling. They have some
real runners on board.
The Stanford cross-country sea
son, which serves principally as a
fall track training session, lists a few
dual meets previous to the big one
with Cal, all of which are held on the
Stanford golf course. Three and a
half and two and a half miles are the
standard running distances.
Led by Ed Burrows and Tiger Al
exander, veterans of last year's team,
other tryoutees will be John Dern
and Bill McCurdy, who both did
some running last fall, Workhorse
Emmanuel, up from the frosh dis
tance corps of last year, and Ray
Malott, from Templeton's cinder
path team.
