While the Indians and the Cou- I
gars besport themselves on the I
W.S.C. turf at Pullman this Satur- i
dry, six other major contests, head- i
lined by the Stanford Frosh-Trojan !
Frosh and St. Mary's-California tilts, j
take place up and down the coast.
Nobody seems to want to give j
either the Farm lads or the team i
from Washington the edge, inas
much as both squads are still rather
unknown quantities. The Cougars
boast of Goddard and Welchko in the
backfield and a crew of four big
tackles, but how any of them will
work outside of the veteran God
dard, one of the big guns on the '
coast last year, is still a matter of i
conjecture.
About the same status is given the |
Papoose - Trobube game, although j
Indians Patton, Goldiron, Hicking- j
botham may prove a little too much j
for a dark-horse S.C. outfit.
Cal is favored slightly over St. j
Mary's, and is expected to employ j
lots of speed with Mushy Pollock
and Eddie Vallejo getting lots of j
extra use in practice this week. Ar- j
cher, hot-shot southpaw passer for |
the Bears, may also be used as a fiy ;
in the St. Mary's soup.
U.S.C. is figured to take Oregon i
with ease in a southland game, in
asmuch as the Webfeet look none
too strong and the Trojans loom
larger and larger as potential con- I
ference champs.
Washington over Idaho at Seattle j
with the greatest of ease, tra-la, and !
U.S.F. to take San Jose State, but j
not without a little, small struggle |
are others which are on tap. Wil- !
lamette, without the services of the;
flashy Johnny Oravec this year, I
doesn't figure to give Oregon State !
much of a struggle in the annual ;
Corvallis clash. Last year the jumpy
little man, Oravec himself, wasn't j
enough to stave off a 26-0 defeat, so
things look pretty black for his!

U.S.C. is figured to take Oregon i
with ease in a southland game, in
asmuch as the Webfeet look none
too strong and the Trojans loom
larger and larger as potential con- I
ference champs.

little man, Oravec himself, wasn't j

While the Indians and the Cou- I
gars besport themselves on the I
W.S.C. turf at Pullman this Satur- i
dry, six other major contests, head- i
lined by the Stanford Frosh-Trojan !
Frosh and St. Mary's-California tilts, j
take place up and down the coast.
Nobody seems to want to give j
either the Farm lads or the team i
from Washington the edge, inas
much as both squads are still rather
unknown quantities. The Cougars
boast of Goddard and Welchko in the
backfield and a crew of four big
tackles, but how any of them will
work outside of the veteran God
dard, one of the big guns on the '
coast last year, is still a matter of i
conjecture.
About the same status is given the |
Papoose - Trobube game, although j
Indians Patton, Goldiron, Hicking- j
botham may prove a little too much j
for a dark-horse S.C. outfit.
Cal is favored slightly over St. j
Mary's, and is expected to employ j
lots of speed with Mushy Pollock
and Eddie Vallejo getting lots of j
extra use in practice this week. Ar- j
