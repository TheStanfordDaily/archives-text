# Culture and Anarchy

I asked a freshman a lew days ago what he
thought of the Pre-reg period. He was very en
thusiastic. Yesterday, I asked him what he
thought of Encina. I could see that his earlier
enthusiasm had died. So I asked him to write out
a summary of what goes on. He wrote:
"Flying missiles of every size and shape â€”
green peppers, half-eaien peaches, watermelon
rind, soap and coat hangers are dispatched from
various vantage points of Encina. Snipers are
continually taking their toll and wild-hair condi
tioning the atmosphere of Encina Hall. Fourth
floor "inmates" prefer to surprise their victim:i
with shoe boxes, candy boxes, and paper bags
filled with water.
"Heaviest barrages begin following supper
and taper into an occasional splash after some
of the less boisterous have succumbed to the
beckoning finger oi the assignment sheet. After
some of the more easily fatigued Encinaites
have retired, a nightly bombardment of lower
floor windows facing the Bull-pen begins with
occasionally a stray piece of soap or apple core
entering some window. None of the throwers
of harder missiles are really accurate enough
to call their shots. Bombers using the water bag
method are to be most feared as they operate
with the utmost siealth and accuracy and are
usually clever enough to avoid being identified."
There's nothing very new about it, really. I
notice that there is a slight trend in the technique
towards vegetable matter, but essentially it is
the same. Encina has not changed much in ihe
last few years.
But the freshman, who had been so pleased
with the pre registration period, who felt that
Stanford had held something rather important
for him, wan beginning to wonder if it isn't all
horseplay.
How to account for ihis sadistic desire to de
stroy, the mob spirit, which finds its highest
level of expression in flexing the muscles?
Make allowances for the fact that the boys are
adolescents, that it is their first experience away
from a family that does not know how to raise
boys in this complex civilization.
But that does not account for the fact that the
horseplay continues throughout the sophomore
year. Throughout the fraternities, throughout
the halls. There is very rarely any person with
a mature altitude towards fun. Make allowances
for the fact that the educational process is not
getting ahold of the students. From the start
of grade school, learning has been a simplified
game in building blocks. If you tell the teacher
what she wants you to tell her you get an A.
The competitive grade system, combined with
mass education of students not motivated by
* a mily environment for academic courses, has
. -aaened the significance of learning.
You may also make allowances for the fact
at a student is an imitative animal. He dresses
appear like someone he admires.
He models his actions so that he may blend
u with the actions of the rnob. A freshman is
pt to imitate the prominent members of his
lass; he is c-.pt to imitate the leaders of the
lasses above him.
The sponsors have a hard time yelling "Pipe
down, frosh!" Why don't the freshmen imitate
;he sponsors, or do they?
