The adrenalin squad oi the Rally Committee
has been bustling around, trying to get all of us
pepped ap, so that the team will get pepped up,
I suppose, and win games, I suppose, though
some insist that this is really the normal process
in reverse.
They have been very earnest in their desire
to get various Stanford songs printed in The
Daily so that the students will learn them, so
that they will get pepped up, and the team will
get pepped up and win games. Some day, I
suppose, The Daily will print some of the songs
for the above purposes.
The Rally Committee has impressed it upon
us all that it is very necessary to print the songs
to pep up the teams. In their eagerness to get
underway, however, the adrenalin boys forgot
to ask the Stanford Band to play at yesterday's
Rally mor--> than a day ahead ol time. The Band
declared it did not have enough practice and
said "No."
As a result, the Band was not on hand to cep

up the students to pep up the songs, to pep up
the team which is to win games. This, many
people consider a sin, though others insist that
it is really the normal process in reverse.
