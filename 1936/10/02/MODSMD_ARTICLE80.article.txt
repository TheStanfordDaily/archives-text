# Maybe Presidents Aren't Supposed to Know
## 
### 
Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia
university, spoke at its opening exercises last
week.
In his address, and that was the first time
many student body and faculty members heard
him, he denounced "the lawless and disorderly
force that has closed the Seattle Post - Intel
ligencer."
That in itself isn't very surprising. Mr. Butler
just doesn't believe in union labor and says so.
But he said it at the opening exercises of a uni
versity. And ho defended William Randolph
Hearst and denounced union labor.
It doesn't seem to make sense, a university
president not knowing what justice is and what
prejudice is and what propaganda is.
Maybe university presidents aren't supposed
to know.
But Mr. Butler could at least have kept his uni
versity a university instead of opening the year
with a tirade against those whose welfare might
conflict with his personal interests.
