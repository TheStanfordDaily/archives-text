# The 						Running Board Rider
## 
### 
There are plenty of easy ways for freshmen
in particular to get themselves killed or seri
ously maimed around this campus. They can
fall out of third-story Encina windows along
with their water bags and apple cores. They
can fall in the sewage moats that front the new
theater.
They can do all these things without bring
ing hurt to anyone but themselves. But there
are also the freshmen who ride on the running
boards of speeding Paly-bound autos. One slip
of the foot and the rider is gone and the driver
is liable to be held. Fall out the windows,
stumble in the ditches, but don't ride the run
ning boards.
