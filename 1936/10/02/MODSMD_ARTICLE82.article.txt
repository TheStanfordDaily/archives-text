THE GAME THAT GREW UP
Just as October turns into November, hundreds of
thousands of otherwise god-fearing citizens will sit
in the crisp breezes of the nation's stadia catching
deaths of cold and some entertaniment. They will
crawl down crowded highways, eat too many hot dogs,
arrive home dog-tired, and generally have a good time
in their inimitable American way. Specifically, there
are bald-pated papa, seam-faced mama, little Willie
gawking out of his overcoat, and last but not least,
Junior, "who's 21 now and is sitting away over there
in the rooting section, isn't that cute?"
* « * *
They say they are all watching football games. They
arc not. They are tasting a brew cleverly compounded
from many elements. The actual play of the game is a
small part—shall we say a pinch of spice. They are
really sensing a crowd—with a crowd's dramatic val
ues, enjoying a spectacle—aural and visual. Ancl most
important, they are experiencing a sensation.

That sensation" (the B.A.C. might deprecate our
emphasis for business reasons) is the feeling of Mr.
and Mrs. America, (hat. for three hours every Satur
day they are running the emotional gamut of college
life.
* * «c *
Subtly, invisibly, the boom-boom and rah-rah as
pects of a football game are prepared and maintained
to produce just that feeling—for it pays needed divi
dends.
Of course, it is obvious fakery. For when football
became a big business,-football ceased to be a student
sport and students cersed to create the atmosphere
surrounding it.

The football spirit today is synthetic, a rc-cnactmcnt
of the spontaneous enthusiasm when games were bat
tled out on a sand lot before 300 collegians.
Significantly the college man gets the same kind of
phony enjoyment, artificially colored and flavored, as
mama and papa and Willie. He doesn't feel "close" to
the team. Circumstances no longer permit it. Victory
or defeat will not mean uncontrollable elation or in
sufferable despair to him. He pays his $1.10 for the
environment conducive to kidding himself that a foot
b-iil game is "real collitch" -and he knows damned
well it isn't.
B.A.C. foitunes have put him with the outside foot
ball fan who gets his money's worth watching rooters,
players and bandsmen he personally knows nothing
and cares nothing about, give a second-hand version
of an esprit ae corps that died with football's first
million. —Bob Eisenbach
