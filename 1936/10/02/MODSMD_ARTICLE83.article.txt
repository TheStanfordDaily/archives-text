# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Wong's kitch is rent by internal dissension at this
writing. Wong, who is in supreme command, and
knows it, is very disturbed over the matter of hiring
the new hashboys.
An interdepartmental communication from the kitch
slates quite clearly: "Hashboy bum boy. Makum allee
time noise. Talk to girl. Eat too much, Gettum new
hashboy bum boy. Throw 'em all out. Get off my
feet, you big baboon."
This does not bother the head hasher. Ho is in su
preme command, and knows it. The head hash was
v'oung once himself; he is interested solely in having a
hungry youth with strong muscles who will not be
too neat.
Phis ravenous youth of poor but honest parents in
evitably turns out to be a fraternity brother.
Then there i.s the house mother, who is in supreme
command. She wants a mild-mannered youth without
any bad habits, who will answer the bell when she
rings. SJhe is quite positive that the tall, dark fellow
there on the left who needs a shave will not get the
spoons on the rir*ht side of the knife.
The house president wants her boy frit nds.
And the girls in the house want a blond, curly
j headed Zete who plays football.
The result of all this is that the house gets a hasher
! who is: "Hashboy bum boy. Makum allee time noise.
J Get off my feet, jou big bum."
