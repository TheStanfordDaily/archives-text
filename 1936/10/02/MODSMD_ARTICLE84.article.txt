Editor's Note:
Continuing The Daily's Stockton
Insane Asylum correspondent's ar
ticle, appearing for the first time
yesterday:
State Ranch, Stockton,
August 10, 1936
Dr. Margaret Smyth, superin
tendent of the State Hospital, Stock
ton, Calif. August 1, 1936 —in pres
ence of Mr. Faley, I have asked
Samuel Hamberg, for—that he has
since October 4, 1924—the date I
have quit working in the poultry
yard; (that fellow Hamberg after
he in my absence has broken open
my box that time later handed after
he has taken out of the box in pres
cenee of an attendant and inmate
John my new shoes and one of the
scaring whistles but he kept 30-40
three cent postage stamps, two $1
bills that I have kept in one of my
shoes—about 75 cents in change he
had left in the shoe, two by me
carved well tuned scaring whistles
and a fiddle that I have and other
by me owned things that he has kept
there) has told to me; he does know
nothing about it; whereof I told
him—he stole.
December 1935 I have asked su
pervisor Joseph Parson, to buy for
me a pair of shoes, a $1.50 pocket
watch, six pencils, and a few tablets
of writing paper; sometime later he
made me sign a bill of $24, another
bill of $8, and another one of $12; so
I asked him at he has still more bills
to be signed by me whereof he had
said to me—he will destroy the first
two bills. Later I have found in my
clothes box a pair of working shoes,
pair of slippers, three union suits of
underwear and three light of poor
grade shirts, after I have told to him
—the boss here—l do not wear un
derwear—ALL that I will wear is a
plain of good weight and quality
shirt, ditto such quality blue over
alls with a bib, a sweater or a coat.
The watch, pencils, and the writing
paper 1 have not received. Sometime
June 1936, I have asked supervisor
Parson for a pencil—that fellow had
said to me they have none when I
have seen 8-10 pencils in the desk
drawer; whereof I have said to him:
I do not believe it. He has built
about 100 feet from the sick pa
tients room a dog kennel and does
keeping his dogs in, that times at
night are barking and so— July 1934,
after the pulltry man Hamberg with
out a cause on our part for it has
attacked us (that on previous such
occasions without a cause for it has
pulled me by my nose) i have asked
him at he does intending to pull my
nose again, whereof he has told to
us:— "it is proper (his word) for
him as a state employee to do so";
whereof I have said to him: perhaps
to him it is, but to another man it
would be a crime. Years ago, an
employee here has told to other one,
that they can do anything to the
inmates here, but the public must
not see it. Sometime ago, an em
ployee has told to another that Dr.
McLeesh had said to him, the in
mates become spoiled by good treat
ment; I have seen later that fellow
abuse an inmate with his foot;
whereof time later, as he professing
the Roman Catholic Church faith, I
have preached a sermon in that
faith that he must listen to, as I

was howing the weeds out where he j
and his gang were working. The |
other fellow same day March 1936 i
called me by ugly name, and what
they should do to these foreigners
as he had said it; whereof 1 pointed
my finger at him and told to him
few things that had choked and
silenced him. You ask inmate Jean,
the landscape gardner, about his
lest treatment that he received on
the kitchen a few years ago by Su
pervisor Parson, that after he has
accused the inmate Jean to you—
yet that fellow Parson has used his
feet at the inmate when he was
lying on the ground.
I am very truly yours,
Ludwig Kruppa
Patient in State Hospital
P.S. The above is only a little of
what 1 could tell; that that fellow
forced on me to say. This paper I
have received by a boss here.
Editor's note: Inmate Kruppa's
treatise on the San Francisco Po
lice graft investigation and re
marks on the part played by Satan
in the married life of the American
family will appear in following
articles in this column.
The Editor, Sir:
It was with interest and some dis
gust that we were informed in the
September 29 issue of this paper that
the proceeds from the Masque Bali
were appropriated for purposes of
the new theater.
Were we misled in our belief that
it was customary for these proceeds
to be given the Stanford Convales
cent Home?
This aristocratic function was al
ways feebly justified by the mean
ingless platitude "For Stanford's j
Own. Is not the one dollar spe- j
cial assessment levied against all I
registering students sufficient to al
lay expenses on the new theater j
without taking funds from a really I
worth-while cause?

William Haas
Editor's note:
Almon E. Roth, University i
Comptroller, states that when the |
idea of a Memorial Theater was
still young, money was appropri
ated from the Masque Ball for the
theater fund. In recent years, '
however, Masque Ball proceeds
have not been used for this pur
pose.
