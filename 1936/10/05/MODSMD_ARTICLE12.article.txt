# What Was Wrong With The Quad?
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
"W/HEN hundreds of Farmsters
lined up thres-deep in the Old
• Union last June to claim their five
dollars worth of Stanfordiana, they
had a big, tan-bound volume shoved
under their arms, the 43rd annual
edition of the Stanford Quad.
But before they got out of the dis
tribution room, they knew that
something was wrong with the big,
tan-bound volume. The cover let
ters were smearing and the dye rub
bing off on their clothes. A once
through of the contents, though,
showed the wet cover was not the
only trouble.
"Look at these pictures, Bill. What
happened to them? They're all
blurred and fuzzy." Thus the major
fault of the 1936 Quad.
Faulty Photos
Why were most of the photographs
in the sports, administration, and
candid-camera sections gray and
washed-out? First reports blamed
the deficiency upon Photolithogra
phy, a process of offset printing used
because it is less expensive when a
page is covered with photographs.
Check-up with a "photolith" ex
pert completely discredited this the
ory. The photographs themselves

were definitely to blame. Chuck
Fontius, last yeai - 's yearbook man
ager, explains it "The Quad's pho
tographers were amateurs who had
to be broken in. The darkroom was
new and the equipment complicated.
We used complex Leica cameras
which need experts to operate suc
cessfully. But we lacked the experts."
The Quad's mediocrity, moreover,
cannot be attached to a reduced
budget, as some readers thoOght. The
1936 edition actually cost more than
the preceding year's. The 1935 out
lay was $16,151.30, while $16,560.99
was spent in production last year.
Lacabranne's Reds
Editor Don Hanson tried to make
the 1936 book more completely
"Stanfordish" with an Indian motif
running through the art work. To
accomplish this he hired a run-of
the-mill commerical artist named
Lacabranne, a San Francisco woman
who worked through the Western
Art Service. Though Miss Laca
branne was no "big name" artist as
was J. Paget-Fredericks the year be
fore, her slightly-deformed Indians
cavorting on the end papers and sec
tion dividing pages were definitely
more effective than Paget-Freder

. icks' neurotic nudes in the 1935 book.
But good as Lacabranne's redmen
were, they were not outstanding.
I And they were costly. Perhaps 1937
Editor Ruth Barnes has discovered
by now that Stanford's own art stu
dents could do as well if not better
at a fourth the cost.
"I'm sure the Quad could get well
trained Stanford art students with
good artistic taste to do the finished
art work that is now done in the city
at huge cost to the annual." Such is
the opinion of Daniel M. Mendelow
itz, graphic art instructor.
"This professional art work has at
times, in the past been very good. But
many times it was no more than
second-rate," Mr. Mendelowitz de
clares.
Try Student Art
"It has always seemed to me that
hiring out the art is much the same
as hiring professional writers to do
the text. Moreover, student ai'tists'
work would greatly increase the
value of the Quad as a record of
Stanford life because it would ac
tually be Stanford work."
The page layouts, like much of the
I photography, were haphazard and
second-rate; in Mr. Mendelowitz'
opinion, " a superficial adaptation of
modern typography." The impres
sionistic figures used as intersection
al division pages were the book's
principal dead-spots.
"Unless such designs are clever
enough to amuse, decorative enough
i to beautify, and personal enough to
show some spirit of the section,"
I says Mendelowitz, "they are waste
j ful and worthless."
Annual's Purpose
What is an annual, after all, but a
permanent memory book of the days
"we went to college"? An outstand
: ing Quad should be so planned that

20 years hence we may relive our
Stanford experiences, feel again the
spirit of 1936. Did the 1936 Quad ac
complish this purpose?
It would have, I think, had the
photography been crisp and live, the
art work more typical of "Stanford,
1936." The book was not "dated"
well enough. The senior section, the
fraternity section, the advertising—
much the same as they were back in
1915. The spirit of '36 was lacking.
Only in the candid-camera shots was
'36 typified. And even here the effect
was ruined completely by poor pho
tography.
Has Ruth Barnes, first woman ed

ftor since the initial Quad went to
press 43 years ago, learned the lesson
of past failures? At least we can
say she's started out right.
Already she has on her staff two
of the Farm's most expert camera
men, Tro Harper and Ed Stein
heimer. Already she has begun work
on layouts which definitely break
i from the conventional yet inconsist
| ent lay-out plans of the 1936 book.
Yes, there is a chance that in 1957
when we drag down our Quads from
a dusty attic shelf we'll be able to
look at Ruth Barnes' edition and say,
j "This was Stanford, all right, back
in 1937."
