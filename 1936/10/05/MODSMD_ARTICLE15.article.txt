Chance to see the long heralded
Simone Simon of the signboards and
Girl's Dormitory in the French film
that brought her a Hollywood con
tract is beign offered tomorrow and
Wednesday by the Varsity Theater.
The picture. Lac Aux Dames, is an
adaptation of a Vicki Baum novel,
is siad to feature, besides a fine per
formance by the young French star,
excellent photography of the Tyrol
region, where it was filmed. English
lilies supplement the French dia
logue.
French and German students will
be interested to know that this is the
first of a series of imported films
planned by the Varsity.

Music enthusiasts wearied by rep- j
etitious evenings of Bach and Beeth

oven, anxious to sample the flavor
of exotic music systems, will be in
terested in a lecture, Timbuktu and
Beyond, which is being given by
Mrs. Laura Boulton, collector of na
tive music, at the San Francisco
Community Playhouse, 609 Sutter
Street, Tuesday morning at 11
o'clock.
Accustomed to vaunting its supe
riority over "backward peoples,"
America and Europe are only just
beginning to realize the "backward
ness" of their musical system as com
pared with those, vastly more com
plicated, of the Orient and Africa.
From them we have already bor
rowed, will borrrow more.

The basis of optimism is sheer ter
ror.—Wilde.
