# OUR MASCULINE DISCIPLINE
## 
### 
There is a new spirit in Sinn ford's Memorial Church. It is
an ai/f/ressirc, : it/or oiis voicc that now speaks from Ihe pulpit.
Dr. D. !:lton Trueblood, new chaplain who has come to Stanford
from I larerford Colleije, believes that there is a hit cut relit/ions
feeliiuj amoih/st the students which has been blunted and stifled
by the inadequacies of childhood relit/ions, lie wishes to make
the Church and its I'estry the center of philosophic and rel'hjious
life of the student body. II ill the intellectual and stroiuj appeal be
enou</h to shake the Stanford student body out of its famous
lethan/y?

of attempting to form a civilized but
non-Christian mentality. The ex
periment will fail; but we must be
very patient in awaiting its collapse;
meanwhile redeeming the time: so
that the Faith may be preserved
alive through the dark ages before
us, to renew and rebuild civilization,
and save the World from suicide."
As an apologist for Christianity
Mr. Eliot is bound to take notice of
the much publicized and popularly
acclaimed apologetics of certain emi
nent physicists. He thinks, as we
might suppose he would, that their
contribution has been greatly over
rated, and he is sorry to see the way
in which good Christians have so re
joiced over the fact that Mr. Edding
ton is a Christian.
"I feel," he writes, "that the sci
entists should be received as peni
tents for the sins of an earlier scien
tific generation, rather than ac
claimed as new friends and allies."
The Christian physicists have not
given us any new reasons for the
faith and their only service, as Eliot
points out is that of removing "prej
udices from the minds of those who
have not the faith. but who might
possibly come to it." The distinction
is an important one.
Theological Prejudices
As Eliot surveys the current scene
he is too wise to imagine that there
is any great or unprecedented turn
ing to the faith, any more than there
is a great increase in the number of
serious thinkers. But he does believe
that some of the prejudice against
theology has disappeared and that
young men of today are more ready,
than were young men 20 years ago,

"to believe that theology i§ a mascu
line discipline."
It is encouraging to realize that
T. S. Eliot is still a young man and
his influence as a Christian apologist
may be expected to grow in the com
ing years. We shall watch with
grateful interest as he further steeps
himself in the teachings of the Uni
versal Church and undertakes the
rigors of this "masculine discipline."

The great object of life is sensa
tion; to feel that we exist, even

It is encouraging to realize that
T. S. Eliot is still a young man and

There is a new spirit in Sinn ford's Memorial Church. It is

Dr. D. !:lton Trueblood, new chaplain who has come to Stanford
from I larerford Colleije, believes that there is a hit cut relit/ions

by the inadequacies of childhood relit/ions, lie wishes to make

life of the student body. II ill the intellectual and stroiuj appeal be

of attempting to form a civilized but
non-Christian mentality. The ex
periment will fail; but we must be
very patient in awaiting its collapse;
meanwhile redeeming the time: so
that the Faith may be preserved
alive through the dark ages before
us, to renew and rebuild civilization,
and save the World from suicide."
As an apologist for Christianity
Mr. Eliot is bound to take notice of
the much publicized and popularly
acclaimed apologetics of certain emi
nent physicists. He thinks, as we
might suppose he would, that their
contribution has been greatly over
rated, and he is sorry to see the way
in which good Christians have so re
joiced over the fact that Mr. Edding
ton is a Christian.
"I feel," he writes, "that the sci
entists should be received as peni
tents for the sins of an earlier scien
tific generation, rather than ac
claimed as new friends and allies."
The Christian physicists have not
given us any new reasons for the
faith and their only service, as Eliot
points out is that of removing "prej
udices from the minds of those who
have not the faith. but who might
possibly come to it." The distinction
is an important one.
Theological Prejudices
As Eliot surveys the current scene
he is too wise to imagine that there
is any great or unprecedented turn
ing to the faith, any more than there
is a great increase in the number of
serious thinkers. But he does believe
that some of the prejudice against
theology has disappeared and that
young men of today are more ready,
than were young men 20 years ago,

"to believe that theology i§ a mascu
