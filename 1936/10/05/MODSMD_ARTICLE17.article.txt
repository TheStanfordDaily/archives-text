# A 						Sophisticate Returns To Religion

### D. ELTON TRUEBLOOD 
r |"'o ONE who is watching the signs
of tho times there are few indica
tions of greater significance than
that which may be observed in the
interest of T. S. Eliot, editor of 'The
Criterion," and his followers in re
ligion. His conversion to the Chris
tian faith, which some once looked
upon as a pose, is now admitted to
be thoroughgoing and sincere.
Enough time has passed to show that
his religious interest is no passing
fad. but is the logical outcome of
what was already implicit in his
earlier position. Having become a
Christian, Eliot has already demon
strated the zeal of the convert and
defends, as well as accepts, the his
toric faith.
Dominant Traditions
It must not be thought that Mr.
Eliot's Christianity is a homesick
longing for the thirteenth century
r an aesthetic attachment*to ritual.
He is not willing to .swallow incred
ible dogma in order to "enjoy the
luxury of Christian sentiments and
the excitement of Christian ritual."
The order, he suggests, has, in his
own experience, been quite the op
posite one; he first came with much
effort to rational assent, and the
proper sentiments foljowcd later.
The great doctrines of Christian
!aith. those of the dominant tradi
tion, have come to him to be indubi
tably true. He believes that above
nature is supernature, and that
man's uniqueness consists in the fact
that he recognizes supernatural real
ities. not that he invents them. He
believes in the dogma of Original
Sin, and holds it to be essential to
the fully developed religious view
of life.
Eliot's abilities as a Christian apol
ogist are most evident in his contro
versial moods. Starting as a disciple
of tho late Irving Babbitt. Eliot came
to be later a strong opponent of Hu
manism. This variety of Humanism
was cherished by Professor Babbitt,
it seemed to Eliot, as a substitute for
the Christian..religion. Eliot upholds
this Humanism as Ihr handmaid of
religion, but declares it to be most
unsuitable as an alternative to re
ligion.
Is Humanism Feasible?
His point is not so much that a
"humanistic" civilization is undesir
ahle. but that it is not feasible. A

civilization organized without refer
ence to an intellectual faith in the
super-natural would be so highly
unstable that it would fall either into
mere humanitarianism or a "Cathol
icism of despair."
But Eliot's sword play is even
more brilliant when he is attacking
what he calls the "life-forcers." The
leader of this tribe would seem to be
Bernard Shaw, who has faith in
"life," whatever he means by that.
What Eliot is opposing is the philos
ophy of naturalism in many of its
forms, but particularly he opposes
naturalistic ethics. He mentions
Bertrand Russell and Aldous Hux
ley, but says there is no need to
worry about their influence, "for if
Youth has the spirit of a tomtit or
the brain of a goose, it can hardly
rally with enthusiasm to these two
depressing life-forcers."
Far from trying to make peace
with the enemy, Eliot holds that
there is everything to gain in seeing
how sharp the division is between
the Christians and the non-Chris
tians. The contrast between the
Universal Church and the World is
greater today than it has been at any
time since pagan Borne.
Times Not More Corrupt
He does not mean that our times
arc more "corrupt," but that Chris
tianity is by no means "official."

there is everything to gain in seeing
how sharp the division is between
the Christians and the non-Chris

Universal Church and the World is
greater today than it has been at any
time since pagan Borne.

interest of T. S. Eliot, editor of 'The

ligion. His conversion to the Chris
tian faith, which some once looked
upon as a pose, is now admitted to
be thoroughgoing and sincere.
Enough time has passed to show that
his religious interest is no passing

what was already implicit in his

Dominant Traditions
It must not be thought that Mr.
Eliot's Christianity is a homesick
longing for the thirteenth century
r an aesthetic attachment*to ritual.
He is not willing to .swallow incred
ible dogma in order to "enjoy the
luxury of Christian sentiments and
the excitement of Christian ritual."
The order, he suggests, has, in his
own experience, been quite the op
posite one; he first came with much
effort to rational assent, and the
proper sentiments foljowcd later.
The great doctrines of Christian
!aith. those of the dominant tradi
tion, have come to him to be indubi
tably true. He believes that above
nature is supernature, and that
man's uniqueness consists in the fact
that he recognizes supernatural real
ities. not that he invents them. He
believes in the dogma of Original
Sin, and holds it to be essential to
the fully developed religious view
of life.
Eliot's abilities as a Christian apol
ogist are most evident in his contro
versial moods. Starting as a disciple
of tho late Irving Babbitt. Eliot came
to be later a strong opponent of Hu
manism. This variety of Humanism
was cherished by Professor Babbitt,
it seemed to Eliot, as a substitute for
the Christian..religion. Eliot upholds
this Humanism as Ihr handmaid of
religion, but declares it to be most
unsuitable as an alternative to re
ligion.
Is Humanism Feasible?
His point is not so much that a
"humanistic" civilization is undesir
ahle. but that it is not feasible. A

civilization organized without refer
ence to an intellectual faith in the
super-natural would be so highly
unstable that it would fall either into
mere humanitarianism or a "Cathol
icism of despair."
But Eliot's sword play is even
more brilliant when he is attacking
what he calls the "life-forcers." The
leader of this tribe would seem to be
Bernard Shaw, who has faith in
"life," whatever he means by that.
What Eliot is opposing is the philos
ophy of naturalism in many of its
forms, but particularly he opposes
naturalistic ethics. He mentions
Bertrand Russell and Aldous Hux
ley, but says there is no need to
worry about their influence, "for if
Youth has the spirit of a tomtit or
the brain of a goose, it can hardly
rally with enthusiasm to these two
depressing life-forcers."
