"I don't like it, nyaaaayaaaa."
Of course you don't like it, dearie, it ain't becoming to The Stan
ford Daily to come out in tabloid size. It isn't becoming to The
Stanford Daily to be anything but the Stanford Daily.
You don't like it dearie, because it is different. It is new. You
didn't realize that Monday's Dailies of the past have never had
any news in them. Because nothing ever happens on Sundays at
Stanford. Nobody knows on Sunday what is going to happen on
Tuesday, and nothing ever happens on Mondays at Stanford
when there are housemeetings.
Dearie, we are only sorry that Monday's Daily isn't more dif
ferent. We have tried to make it as different as possible. There is
something to be said for getting out of the rut, you know. How
ever we have our limitations here at the Shack. We only see
things from the day-to-day angle.
We have poured this tabby out as a random shot. Perhaps it
will start people to thinking, and then all we will have to do is to
sit here and mark little configurations on the copy and send it out
to the back shop boys, who don't like this either, because it is
different. We want the help of people who think. We realize that
our chance of making this Monday tabby more than a temporary
spasm in the volume of a newspaper rests on the ability of people
who are not day-to-day thinkers, who can see relations between
things, who are sensitive to their environment, who feel some
thing. This includes, fiction, non-fiction, verse light and heavy.
Please keep it short.
