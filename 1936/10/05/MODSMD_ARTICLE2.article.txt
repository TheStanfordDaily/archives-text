# The 						Campaign Opens Up
## 
### Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson 
;[ DO NOT propose to advocate
anything. I do intend to say what
I think at this particular moment
j about the Presidential campaign.
Most of all I do not intend to essay
the role of "phophet." There is
! ample phophesy, advocacy, and de
nunciation without any addition to
them.
In this campaign we witness an
j unprecedented condition in the
Democratic Party. 1. There is a
Democrat in the office of Presi
| dent who, elected on a platform of
j reform, is still struggling with the
! need of economic recovery, yet en
gaged in vast experimentation not
only in action but in thought.
2. Asfar as party labels are con
cerned and in reality, too, he has
J overwhelming support in both
Houses of Congress and in the na
tional organization. 3. His party
i organization has a campaign financial
appeal of unprecedented size and
scope. Never have all these condi
tions prevailed in a Presidential
campaign.
An Old Story
But it is not unprecedented that
(he nominee of the party is opposed
by prominent leaders of his own

party. This has happened again and
again in our polities. Nor is it un- ■
preeedented for him to have, as far j

I as we can now determine, the un
wavering support of millions of
j habitual Democrats. That has hap
pened before. But polling of all these
will not win the election.
This leads us to consider the un
: precsdented condition in the Re
publican party. 1. Its national leader
of experience is not the nominee,
and although he i.s supporting the
ticket his record is not the issue.
Ihe Republican nominee is not
Iho dircct antithesis of the Presi
dent in doctrine or in pronounce
ment, however, he seems to be in
! expprience and method. 3. He repre
: sents an attempt to win back the
needed votes not by deep contrast
but by vigorous dissent. (There is a
slight analogy to the Hughes-Wilson
contest of 1916.) These conditions
have not been combined in any pre
vious Presidential campaign.
But it is not unprecedented that
the Republican nominee has not the
support of an influential group of
I Republican leaders. For thirty years
these leaders have fought within the
party. They have lamed every Re
publican President and they have
defeated two of them. They repre-
I sent a constant element in the poli
; tics of modern America.
Few Real 'Reds'

Some commentators have made
much of the mood of protest that
| they believe abroad in the land. This
has been over-emphasized and there
has been much misunderstanding.
Notwithstanding the critical state of
international relations and the even
more critical state of industrial re
lations, there appear to be few spots
of genuine political radicalism in
| the United States. The polling
strength of these elements is not
great in this Presidential contest.
Contrast the poor showing of the
nominees of the "third parties" in
all the current poles with the power
ful protest of the Populists in 1892,
with the Progressives in 1912, and
with the LaFollette vote of 1924.
There is a possible reason for this
diflerence but it does not seem to
have been mentioned. It is this:
I in those years of uncertainty and
great breaking of party lines, the
President and the party in power
were Conservative. The rulers in
j office were not pledged to reform,
i experiment and a new deal. The re
i formers were "out." An important
question now may well be this:
What will the so-called independent
! element in the electorate do when
the conditions are reversed?
At this date the campaign has re
vealed 1. the Democratic party,
splendid in statement of objectives
and strong in opposition and denun
ciation. 2. The Republican party,
powerful in its appeal to tradition
and efficiency and lamed by critical
sectional dissent. 3. Third parties
strong in denunciation, and particu
larly in analysis, but weak in their
| appeal to the American voter
Look Beyond Ballot*
I think we had best look beyond
the present election for a great de
cision upon the questions that divide
our people. No great decision will
have been made, whatever the out
come. The lines are not clearly
drawn; the issues are confused: the
armies have not been gathered; and
the leaders have not appeared or at
least have not been recognized for
what they are. As a people we have
made great decisions. We did so at
| the time of the founding of the Na
tion and again in the formulation of
j the Constitution. Again in 1828 and
in 1884 and in 1896 when William
Jennings Bryan was defeated, and
in 1916 when Woodrow Wilson was
re-elected. But the American party
system does not make decisive ac
tion easy. Perhaps jt is fortunate
that it is so. Whatever the out
come, it is because of this party
system, more than any
factor, that we will remain America
j —not Europe, or any nation in Eu
rope. We will continue to fight our
battles "at random," and. it is sad
lo say it. to drift to our destiny.
But 1 am asked, how do you
stand? Where my vote goes is of no
importance whatsoever, except to me
.jnd my conscience. We have enough
participants in American politics. We
: need critical bystanders.

Look Beyond Ballot*
I think we had best look beyond
the present election for a great de
cision upon the questions that divide
our people. No great decision will
have been made, whatever the out
come. The lines are not clearly
drawn; the issues are confused: the
armies have not been gathered; and
the leaders have not appeared or at
least have not been recognized for
what they are. As a people we have
made great decisions. We did so at
| the time of the founding of the Na
tion and again in the formulation of
j the Constitution. Again in 1828 and
in 1884 and in 1896 when William
Jennings Bryan was defeated, and
in 1916 when Woodrow Wilson was
re-elected. But the American party
system does not make decisive ac
tion easy. Perhaps jt is fortunate
that it is so. Whatever the out
come, it is because of this party
system, more than any
factor, that we will remain America
j —not Europe, or any nation in Eu
rope. We will continue to fight our
battles "at random," and. it is sad
lo say it. to drift to our destiny.
But 1 am asked, how do you
stand? Where my vote goes is of no
importance whatsoever, except to me
.jnd my conscience. We have enough
participants in American politics. We
: need critical bystanders.

In this campaign we witness an

J overwhelming support in both

i organization has a campaign financial
appeal of unprecedented size and
scope. Never have all these condi
tions prevailed in a Presidential
campaign.
An Old Story
But it is not unprecedented that
(he nominee of the party is opposed
by prominent leaders of his own

party. This has happened again and
again in our polities. Nor is it un- ■
preeedented for him to have, as far j

I as we can now determine, the un
wavering support of millions of
j habitual Democrats. That has hap
pened before. But polling of all these
will not win the election.
This leads us to consider the un
: precsdented condition in the Re
publican party. 1. Its national leader
of experience is not the nominee,
and although he i.s supporting the
ticket his record is not the issue.
Ihe Republican nominee is not
Iho dircct antithesis of the Presi
dent in doctrine or in pronounce
ment, however, he seems to be in
! expprience and method. 3. He repre
: sents an attempt to win back the
needed votes not by deep contrast
but by vigorous dissent. (There is a
slight analogy to the Hughes-Wilson
contest of 1916.) These conditions
have not been combined in any pre
vious Presidential campaign.
But it is not unprecedented that
the Republican nominee has not the
support of an influential group of
I Republican leaders. For thirty years
these leaders have fought within the
party. They have lamed every Re
publican President and they have
defeated two of them. They repre-
I sent a constant element in the poli
; tics of modern America.

Some commentators have made
much of the mood of protest that

has been over-emphasized and there
has been much misunderstanding.
Notwithstanding the critical state of
international relations and the even
more critical state of industrial re
lations, there appear to be few spots
of genuine political radicalism in

strength of these elements is not
great in this Presidential contest.

nominees of the "third parties" in
all the current poles with the power

with the Progressives in 1912, and

There is a possible reason for this
diflerence but it does not seem to
have been mentioned. It is this:
I in those years of uncertainty and
great breaking of party lines, the
President and the party in power
were Conservative. The rulers in
j office were not pledged to reform,

Some commentators have made
much of the mood of protest that
| they believe abroad in the land. This
has been over-emphasized and there
has been much misunderstanding.
Notwithstanding the critical state of
international relations and the even
more critical state of industrial re
lations, there appear to be few spots
of genuine political radicalism in
| the United States. The polling
strength of these elements is not
great in this Presidential contest.
Contrast the poor showing of the
nominees of the "third parties" in
all the current poles with the power
ful protest of the Populists in 1892,
with the Progressives in 1912, and
with the LaFollette vote of 1924.
There is a possible reason for this
diflerence but it does not seem to
have been mentioned. It is this:
I in those years of uncertainty and
great breaking of party lines, the
President and the party in power
were Conservative. The rulers in
j office were not pledged to reform,
i experiment and a new deal. The re
i formers were "out." An important
question now may well be this:
What will the so-called independent
! element in the electorate do when
the conditions are reversed?
At this date the campaign has re
vealed 1. the Democratic party,
splendid in statement of objectives
and strong in opposition and denun
ciation. 2. The Republican party,
powerful in its appeal to tradition
and efficiency and lamed by critical
sectional dissent. 3. Third parties
strong in denunciation, and particu
larly in analysis, but weak in their
| appeal to the American voter
Look Beyond Ballot*
I think we had best look beyond
the present election for a great de
cision upon the questions that divide
our people. No great decision will
have been made, whatever the out
come. The lines are not clearly
drawn; the issues are confused: the
armies have not been gathered; and
the leaders have not appeared or at
least have not been recognized for
what they are. As a people we have
made great decisions. We did so at
| the time of the founding of the Na
tion and again in the formulation of
j the Constitution. Again in 1828 and
in 1884 and in 1896 when William
Jennings Bryan was defeated, and
in 1916 when Woodrow Wilson was
re-elected. But the American party
system does not make decisive ac
tion easy. Perhaps jt is fortunate
that it is so. Whatever the out
come, it is because of this party
system, more than any
factor, that we will remain America
j —not Europe, or any nation in Eu
rope. We will continue to fight our
battles "at random," and. it is sad
lo say it. to drift to our destiny.
But 1 am asked, how do you
stand? Where my vote goes is of no
importance whatsoever, except to me
.jnd my conscience. We have enough
participants in American politics. We
