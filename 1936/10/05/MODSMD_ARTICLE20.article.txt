i HPHE American Legion marshalled

I police threw Earl Browder, Com
munist candidate for the presidency,
into jail for vagrancy.
But they miscalled their shots.
They should have thrown him into
jail for putting on a poor show, if
his San Francisco exhibition was
any indication of his stock com-
I pany's talent.
Jam Browder

Browder jammed San Francisco's
Dreamland Auditorium with Com
munists and curious alike. There
was even a Father Divine conting
ent who had crossed the B;ty on a
special nickel ferry ride. There was
a picture of Stalin on the wall, and
a drawing of the worker enslaved
in the manner of the famous Laa
coon statue. The Young Commun
ists League marched down the

aisle waving rod flags and singing
(he Internationale, which is no sec
ond Marsaille by any means.
Then the president of the Young
Communists League got up and
shouted in a scratchy voice that the
problem of modern youth was not,
as Horatio Alger imagined it. how to
rise from bootblack, to bank presi
dent, but rather how to become a
bootblack in the first place.
A young negro from Oakland got
up and remarked that Communism
offered the only hope of economic
equality for his race.
Scream for Eagles
After him some woman got up and

screamed for ten-doiiar bills, then
fives, then ones. As the money
trickled in, a paper figure of Hearst
—with Hitler on the reverse .side—
was dropped further and further into
a barrel marked garbage.
Finally, when the woman could
not yell another dime out of the
audience, Brovvder arose and spoke
in a soft, well-modulated voice. He
warned the audience that he spoke
sermons, not speeches, and after he
plowed through Roosevelt and labor,
those who wei'e not sure of their
faith began to wearily plod toward
the doorway. Perhaps they had
heard their fill of the Word.

as Horatio Alger imagined it. how to
rise from bootblack, to bank presi
dent, but rather how to become a
bootblack in the first place.
A young negro from Oakland got
up and remarked that Communism
offered the only hope of economic
equality for his race.
Scream for Eagles
After him some woman got up and

screamed for ten-doiiar bills, then
fives, then ones. As the money
trickled in, a paper figure of Hearst
—with Hitler on the reverse .side—
was dropped further and further into
a barrel marked garbage.
Finally, when the woman could
not yell another dime out of the
audience, Brovvder arose and spoke
in a soft, well-modulated voice. He
warned the audience that he spoke
sermons, not speeches, and after he
plowed through Roosevelt and labor,
those who wei'e not sure of their
faith began to wearily plod toward
the doorway. Perhaps they had
heard their fill of the Word.
