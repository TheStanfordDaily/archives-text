# WHAT WENT ON HERE, AND WHAT'S COMING

pre-registered, and>
finally received, the class of '40
set the pace in news of the week.
Formal clad, they wound up the
stairs of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's
home Saturday night, danced for
three hours, and impressed by both
their numbers — large — and co
operation—unusual.
More stage, more willingness to
dance, less rudeness in dropping
partners when "stuck" made the
affair move smoothly. Carnation
labeled sponsors at first worriedly
introduced; then, not needed, moved
on to enjoy themselves.
President Wilbur greeted each of
the largest-evef registration on ar
rival, but stood guarded from the
too-vigorously hand-shaking frosh
at the close of the evening, sur
rounded by six senior women.
Frosh women lent enough charm to j
the occasion to encourage upper
class gate crushers, who moved j
shamefacedly down the line, unable '

to escape introductions.
PRELIMINARY WELCOME was
the 10 o'clock assembly which served
as greeting to frosh, respite from
classes to others.
President Wilbur refused to carry
out the Daily's prophesy of a gaso
line, alcohol, non-mixing theme. !
"This," said the President, "is not a
chemistry class."
Nevertheless his stand was clear, j
"1 like to see my students often,"
he explained. "I only see a drunk
once." '
Dean Yost greeted frosh women,
: outlined necessity of choosing proper
leaders. Dean Culver stressed im
: portance of friendliness, pointing out
that rfiendships made here often last
for a lifetime.
MATRICULATION SERVICE car
; ried the business of greeting into
; religious fields. Led by sponsors, the
frosh entered double file, filling the
j front section of the chapel. Person

CAMPUS POLITICS will be tem
porarily reviewed when Ex-Com
i mittee sets the date tomorrow night j
! for special elections, designed to lill
| the vacated Ex Committee and Coun
i cil posts. Big-shots and vote-gathers
scout rumors of impending cau
cuses. Nominees, they predict, are
i already fairly well lined up.
POST-PARTY refreshments for
the majority of Farm students neces
sarily change form. Miller's, Junction
Inn, other roadhouses under probe
I in the Board of Equalization Inquiry,
i require legal proof of legal age.
' Internal dissension rends the
; liquor-vendors. Charges and coun
j ter-charges of bribery, non-taxed
j liquor, private stills, are being
| hurled. Most proprietors are held

under sizeable personal bond, and
walk a narrow line in fear of for
feiting all their past and future
profits.
POLITICAL BALLYHOO, moan
while, starts in full force. Marvie
Kahn, prexy, and Stan Beaubaire,
Daily editor in '35. are rallying
round with the Young Republicans.
Young Democrats retaliate by meet
ing in the Women's Clubhouse to
; morrow night at 7:30. Purpose: or
ganization and election of officers.
Both factions intend to carry the
j battle onto the campus. Both fac-
I tions would like to enlist the entire
student body. Both factions will (
issue propaganda, hold meetings, try
to raise enthusiasm.
Speeches of Knox, Smith, and
Roosevelt Thursday night went un
noticed, or at least uncommented,
by even the ardent politico* of the
faculty. They were at President
i Wilbur's reception. This may or may 1

THE DAILY marches on.
First came the dark-room, for full
phuto self-service. Then came new
type-face and consecutive 14-page
and 12-page issues.

first of its kind on the campus, makes
its initial appearance.
And this afternoon tryoutees will
be interviewed for the first time.
Meeting at 5 o'clock in the Journal
ism Library of the Press Building,
they will meet members of Edit
Board, be instructed in preliminary
routine. Two weeks of tryout period
will end with selection of staff
reporters, to bring new blood to the
already over-worked veterans.
