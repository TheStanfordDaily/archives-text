The score ended Washington State
34, Stanford 13. The gloom-spillers
ami win-lose column boys will pull
in their necks and moan.

contest.

and thus will keep their record in
'act, while Stanford is relegated to a
third paragraph team throughout the
land; but the victory was narrower

Cardinal points will long remain a
legend to those who were at Rogers
Field in Pullman Saturday, and to
those of Stanford who hung breath
