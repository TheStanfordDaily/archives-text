# Frosh Score After Damarus Recovers Trojan Fumble
## Young Gives Stanford One Point Margin 
### 
Stanford's snappy freshman grid
ders vindicated their coach's pre
game optimism when they handed
the favored Trojan yearlings a 7-6
licking here Saturday. The accurate
toe of Bob Young, place-kicking
tackle from Eureka, spelled doom
for the Trobabes.
After a scoreless first half which
saw the pigskin see-sawing up and
down the field with great regularity,
the Frosh turned a Trojan fumble
into seven points and the ball game.
Sangster dropped the pill as he was
brought to earth on the opening play
of the second half, and alert Ernest
Damarus recovered for Stanford on
Troy's 22.
Three plays later Fullback Johnny
Grover ripped a pass to Chad Reade,
who made his way to the 11-yard
line for a first down. Then, after
fooling everybody with what ap
peared to be a touchdown pass, the
Frosh really scored. Sparling had
crossed the goal line standing up
after taking a pass from Grover, only
to have the ball slip out of his mitts
at the last moment. There was plenty
of room for argument, but the ref
eree, ruled an incomplete pass.
On fourth down — still 11 yards
from the last line—Grover again shot
an aerial missile. Halfback Chad
Reade leapt into the air one yard
from the goal and made a seemingly
impossible catch from under the
noses of two startled Trojan defend
ers. Grover smacked center for the
touchdown.
Then the Shipke-y strategy depart
ment went into' action. Bob Young
was rushed into the fray to kick

goal, and he delivered the goods.
Maddened by their foemen's score,
the Trobabes cut loose with an of
fqnse which threatened obliteration )

Bill Willard, Papoose end, stole the j
ball from Sangster, the Trojans re- i
newed their efforts and as the result j
of a long pass found themselves on
the Frosh 12. In three plays Quar
terback Bill Sangster slashed his

> Trojan student of place-kicking,
! flunked this most important of all his
exams, his boot going wide of the
, bars.
That marked the demise of the
Trobabe terror. They never got in

to the efforts of Tackles Anderson

Stanford's snappy freshman grid
ders vindicated their coach's pre
game optimism when they handed
the favored Trojan yearlings a 7-6
licking here Saturday. The accurate
toe of Bob Young, place-kicking
tackle from Eureka, spelled doom
for the Trobabes.
After a scoreless first half which
saw the pigskin see-sawing up and
down the field with great regularity,
the Frosh turned a Trojan fumble
into seven points and the ball game.
Sangster dropped the pill as he was
brought to earth on the opening play
of the second half, and alert Ernest
Damarus recovered for Stanford on
Troy's 22.
Three plays later Fullback Johnny
Grover ripped a pass to Chad Reade,
who made his way to the 11-yard
line for a first down. Then, after
fooling everybody with what ap
peared to be a touchdown pass, the
Frosh really scored. Sparling had
crossed the goal line standing up
after taking a pass from Grover, only
to have the ball slip out of his mitts
at the last moment. There was plenty
of room for argument, but the ref
eree, ruled an incomplete pass.
On fourth down — still 11 yards
from the last line—Grover again shot
an aerial missile. Halfback Chad
Reade leapt into the air one yard
from the goal and made a seemingly
impossible catch from under the
noses of two startled Trojan defend
ers. Grover smacked center for the
touchdown.
Then the Shipke-y strategy depart
ment went into' action. Bob Young
was rushed into the fray to kick

goal, and he delivered the goods.
Maddened by their foemen's score,
the Trobabes cut loose with an of
fqnse which threatened obliteration )
to anything in its goal-bound path.
