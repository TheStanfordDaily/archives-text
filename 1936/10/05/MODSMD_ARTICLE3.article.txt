# A 						COLLEGE EDITOR INTERVIEWS THE COLONEL
## 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
T>EAUBAIRE called me up a couple
of weeks ago and asked me if I
wanted to interview Col. Frank
Knox, Republican candidate for
/ice-president.
"ieaufcaire, in case you don't know,

who stepped into a fat job with
Hearst on his graduation, a fat job
.vith the S.F. Bay Exposition, and

Daily "Why It's Mews" columnist,

Congress in this district.
I said, "Sure."
'You're a good Republican aren't
/ou?"
For 24 Hours
'For 24 hours anyhow," I re
plied.
"I'll get you on Knox's train as it
;omes into Martinez, and then you
•an talk to him on his way into the
:ity. Charles Post, editor of the
Daily Californian, will be with you.
This is a wonderful opportunity; if
/ou play your cards right, y9U may
oe quoted all over the country."
this big moment, I prepared
carefully. Going through newspa
pers to get an idea of questions to
Hsk Knox, I quite sadly cams to
•he realization that there was little
>f significance or of importance to
•ollege youth, thai I could ask him.
£nox probably knows, and I cer
tainly know exactly what he means
oy the "American system." That is
not to say, though, that it means
very much for the American col
legian.

rain towards Martinez. As the Mon
arch of the College Dailies rode along
oeside me, we finally hit upon sev
eral college angles: NY.A.. Teacher's
Oath, Kansas teachers. NYA. was
>ur best bet, we decided.
Ve got off at. Martinez along with
he rest of the Republican delegation
from San Francisco. Thf high school
oand was standing on the loading
platform. There was a sign: "Con

Northern Cal Republican Drive,
S.F.B. Morse, inkeeper at Del Monte
to plutocratic weekending Stanford

Republicans. From Fresno was Mr.
Manning, father of a Stanford Kappa.
All the Republicans seemed to be the
solid-citizen type.
They were definitely not the po
litical prototypes of Jim Farley. They
were courteous, friendly, likeable,
and except for the above-mentioned,
uninteresting. None of them would
I class as intellectual giants.
I asked if they were expecting
Hoover to do any campaigning. They
thought he would give one or two
speeches, probably. How about ru
mors of dissention in Republican
political ranks in Northern Cali
fornia?
"Oh no, they're having a pretty
tough time down in the south, but
we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through
Salinas?" I asked, "you know the
lettuce sheds line both sides of the
tracks."
"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his
strength and is not going to wear
himself down campaigning as Hamil
ton did. After tonight's speech in
S.F. he's going to disappear from
sight, and nobody's going to hear
from him for a day and a half, and
then \he will suddenly appear in
Santa Barbara."
"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun
flowers to Knox, standing on the
rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col
onel, came shortly after we pulled
out of Martinez. While two Oak
land Post-Enquirer reporters were
"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter
his one-day trip down from Ore
gon, but would see us.
The gracious Colonel sat on the
landward side of the train, and like
all the rest of the stalwarts in the
room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
Doling out money to needy col-,
lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.
When we got into the ferry build
ing, there was a crowd of about 150
down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I
never felt so flattered in all my life, i
Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the
press associations was sitting next
fo the chauffeur.
I asked him what he thought of
Knox. He replied that he was a good
guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.

down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I

Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the
press associations was sitting next
fo the chauffeur.
I asked him what he thought of
Knox. He replied that he was a good
guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.

"Oh no, they're having a pretty

we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through

"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his

"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun
flowers to Knox, standing on the
rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col
onel, came shortly after we pulled
out of Martinez. While two Oak
land Post-Enquirer reporters were
"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter
his one-day trip down from Ore
gon, but would see us.
The gracious Colonel sat on the
landward side of the train, and like
all the rest of the stalwarts in the
room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
Doling out money to needy col-,
lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.

room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
Doling out money to needy col-,
lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.
When we got into the ferry build
ing, there was a crowd of about 150
down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I
never felt so flattered in all my life, i
Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the
press associations was sitting next
fo the chauffeur.
I asked him what he thought of
Knox. He replied that he was a good
guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.

I asked if they were expecting

thought he would give one or two
speeches, probably. How about ru

political ranks in Northern Cali

"Oh no, they're having a pretty

we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through

"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his

"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun

rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col

out of Martinez. While two Oak

"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter

speeches, probably. How about ru

"Oh no, they're having a pretty
tough time down in the south, but
we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through
Salinas?" I asked, "you know the
lettuce sheds line both sides of the
tracks."
"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his
strength and is not going to wear

"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun
flowers to Knox, standing on the
rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col
onel, came shortly after we pulled
out of Martinez. While two Oak
land Post-Enquirer reporters were
"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter
his one-day trip down from Ore
gon, but would see us.
The gracious Colonel sat on the
landward side of the train, and like
all the rest of the stalwarts in the
room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
Doling out money to needy col-,
lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.
When we got into the ferry build
ing, there was a crowd of about 150
down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I
never felt so flattered in all my life, i
Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the
press associations was sitting next
fo the chauffeur.
I asked him what he thought of
Knox. He replied that he was a good
guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.
T>EAUBAIRE called me up a couple
of weeks ago and asked me if I
wanted to interview Col. Frank
Knox, Republican candidate for

guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.

I asked if they were expecting

thought he would give one or two

"Oh no, they're having a pretty

we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through

"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his

"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun
flowers to Knox, standing on the
rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col
onel, came shortly after we pulled
out of Martinez. While two Oak
land Post-Enquirer reporters were
"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter
his one-day trip down from Ore
gon, but would see us.
The gracious Colonel sat on the
landward side of the train, and like
all the rest of the stalwarts in the
room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
Doling out money to needy col-,
lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.
When we got into the ferry build
ing, there was a crowd of about 150
down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I
never felt so flattered in all my life, i
Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the

lege students," I said, do you be
lieve in that?"
"Is that one of Tug well's crazy
schemes? No, of course not." said
the Colonel laughing loudly, rather
too loudly I thought.
Post and I found ourselves back
in the car. Here a rather thin young
man about thirty years of age, came
up to me and said he heard that 1
was from the Stanford Daily, and
asked me to come front with him.
In the front of the car, I was intro
duced to the head man of the Sac
ramento contingent, who was the
only old style politician on the train,
but he was one of heroic proportions.
Some ol his front teeth were missing.
They explained that the heroic
politician had been in to interview

Col. Knox for one whole hour, and
had found him very gracious and
willing to shake hands, whereas back
in the days when McKinley was in
the White House,
the heroic politi
cian explained
that no sooner had
he shaken hands
than the cops
made him move
on. But Col. Knox

had been very

gracious. They
wrote down their names on a sheet
of paper for me, and said they were
willing to answer any questions
about Knox I wanted. Since I
knew what Knox meant by the
"American system," I said instead:
"Are the rumors about distention
in the Sacramento Republican ranks
true?"
"No, of course not," they said.
"We have everything running along
smoothly. Our only trouble is that
poeple think we haven't a chance.
But down in Frisco and Lot Angeles,
they can't get together at all. What
did you think of Knox, sonny?"
"I thought he was very gracious,"
I replied and excused myself.
When we got into the ferry build
ing, there was a crowd of about 150
down to see him. And they all
jammed into the ramp.
The band poured itself into "Oh,
Susanna," Landon's convention pa
ean. Beaubaire, who had stayed in
San Francisco, rushed through the
crowd to meet the Colonel. The
newspapermen's flash bulbs going off
in his face seemed to daze the Col
onel slightly.
I tried to get ahold of Beaubaire
to tell him Post and I would hop a
streetcar and meet him at the Fran


tic. But he was too busy. There |
were about 15 7-passenger Cadillacs
backed up to the curb. Every
body was jammed around Beaubaire,
to Post and I walked down to one j
of the empty Cads, popped ourselves
into the back seat.
Beaubaire shouted something, and
the chauffeurs started to pull out.
The sleek cars were decorated with J
"Welcome Col. Knox, Dreamland
Rally tonight." This all did not seem
to set so well with the longshoremen,
who had stuck around until 7 o'clock
to see the sight.
"Vote for Roosevelt," they hooted.
One ran up alongside our car, jeered
something like "Dirty Capitalist." I
never felt so flattered in all my life, i
Post and I had this tremendous j
back seat to ourselves, but up front,
it happened, the reporter who had
accompanied the Knox special
around the country for one of the
press associations was sitting next
fo the chauffeur.
I asked him what he thought of
Knox. He replied that he was a good
guy, but personally, he was for
Roosevelt.
I told him about Beaubaire, and
said he probably would be the sec
ond John Hamilton.
"That isn't much to aspire to," said
the reporter. "I was there when lie
started out. Right after Landon's
nomination," he said, "I'm running
this show.' and from there on things
got worse instead of better."
By 8 o'clock we were inside the
Dreamland auditorium. We had re
served tickets, but the Republican
party of Northern California was
there ahead of us. The place was
packed.
Beside me sat what might pass
for a Communist. But the audience
as a whole tinged on the elderly.
Gray heads predominated in the
audience People who seemed to have
worked hard and saved all their
lives in the petit bourgeouis tradi
tion. People who meant well, who
wanted to do the right thing. There
was nothing that looked like a male
factor of great wealth in the audi
ence.

When Jan Garber had finished his
hour of musical gymnastics, the
script apparently called for com
munity singing. Garber summoned
[ Beaubaire to lead the audience.
After quite a bit of this, Knox ar
rived amidst enthusiasm and polite
applause.
The Colonel discussed the funda
! mental principles of government,
though he did not mention the
NYA. By the time Knox came out
and said, " lam proud I am a busi
ness man," the man next to me
who looked like a Communist but
wasn't, was sound asleep, a two
inch ash drooping from his cigar
i ette.
About 10 o'clock, the meeting gave
out. So 1 drove home and went to
j bed, very tired from the job of
being a Republican for 24 hours.
Col. Knox is a very gracious man.
T>EAUBAIRE called me up a couple
of weeks ago and asked me if I
wanted to interview Col. Frank
Knox, Republican candidate for
/ice-president.

were courteous, friendly, likeable,

I asked if they were expecting

thought he would give one or two
speeches, probably. How about ru
mors of dissention in Republican
political ranks in Northern Cali
fornia?
"Oh no, they're having a pretty
tough time down in the south, but
we're going strong up here."
"Is Knox going to go through
Salinas?" I asked, "you know the
lettuce sheds line both sides of the
tracks."
"As a matter of fact," one of them
explained. "Knox is conserving his
strength and is not going to wear
himself down campaigning as Hamil

S.F. he's going to disappear from

"Uh-huh," I said.
When Knox's special pulled m,
Post and I were too busy getting on
to more than see somebody pass
off a bunch of marigolds as sun
flowers to Knox, standing on the
rear platform.
Our chance to interview the Col
onel, came shortly after we pulled
out of Martinez. While two Oak
land Post-Enquirer reporters were
"trying to smoke him out" up front,
Eric Cullenward, publicity director
tapped us on the shoulder, explained
that the Colonel was very tired alter
his one-day trip down from Ore
gon, but would see us.
The gracious Colonel sat on the
landward side of the train, and like
all the rest of the stalwarts in the
room, sat in a straight back chair
with his back to (he scenery, his face
to the center of the car. If this ar
rangement was for the transaction of
business, such was not the case
when we entered. We were intro
duced.
We hemmed a hit, and he hawed.
I asked him how he liked the hot
weather. He grinned broadly. Post
asked him if be agreed with Landon's
Chatauqua speech.
"That's easy, "laughed Knox. "Of
course, I agree with it. I am in fa
vor of education." he laughed.

"The Teacher's Oath part, too?" I
asked.
"Sure, sure," he said and laughed.
"I also agree with his Portland,
Me. speech in which he accused
Roosevelt of wrecking the World's
Economic Conference and pre
venting the stabilization of the
world's currency."
"Do you believe in stablizing sur
rency?" I asked.
"Yes, yes, of course." he said,
laughing.
"But you believe in the gold stand
ard, too," I said.
"Yes of course."
You think you can have a stable
currency and the gold standard at
the same time?" I asked.
"Certainly, certainly." I could feel
the big-wigs shifting in their seat,
muttering under their breath, "darn
fool college kids."
"Would you support the National
Youth Administration?"
"N.Y.A." I interposed.
"What's that?" asked Knox.
