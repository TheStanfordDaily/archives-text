# STRIKEBREAKER!

### JACK TRACY, '37 
rff il_K NEIGHBORS wouldn't speak to us any more. The (lours of Salinas'
elect were barred to us. I couldn't talk to the blonde with whom I
went steady for three years, nor to her sister, nor to her mother, nor her
father.
I wouldn't dare to show my face at the Rainbow Girl's dance in the
basement of the Masonic Hall, or the P.-T.A. dance at the Civic Club.
I was an outcast in the high society of Salinas.

Because people are hating other*
people in Salinas. The elect hated
me and my family, not because we
ate with our knives (we didn't) but
because we were the family of a let
tuce packer who had supposedly
"gone against his class."
The Lettuce Came
Lettuce-packing is not a beautiful
business. It is an interesting and
exciting business. It involves the
transcontinental shipping of a highly
perishable product for a highly var
iable market. It involves the leasing
of hundreds of acres of ground be
fore the lettuce may even be planted.
It involves speculation, by fairly
small, independent packers who
mortgage the tremendous earnings
of one year on the expectation of
the next. My father was not in the
lettuce business for the beauty of it.
He was in it to make money.
When the time came to renew the
Union contract this year, the Union
presented 52 demands, among which
was the much-disputed Union pref
erence in hiring. The leaders of the
Grower-Shippers Association had
already cleaned up on the fall "deal"

I won't do, and I'm not expecting
you to do anything you don't want
to."
I followed behind in the second
truck.
Right in front of the "Poodle-
Dog," strikers' quarters made over
from a disreputable highway joint,
my truck vapor-locked and the mo
tor died. Immediately the truck was
surrounded by a horde of jeering
men and women. If they had rushed
me, I had a shotgun. In the first two
chambers was tear gas. In the others
was buckshot, in case the tear gas
failed. Instead of rushing the pick
ets stood menacingly, the women
excitedly swearing in the dirtiest
language they could think of. and
they had good imaginations. Several
of them poked out excrement
smeared on a broom-stick, shrilled:
"Here's your supper, you
Madame LaFarge was a piker.
These women never knew how to
knit nor would they, if they could.
Finally, I got the truck going.

fields. He *could not afford to go

those who had already shipped most
,\f their crop, breaking the Union
was a good investment in lower

the Union and got ready to ship.

the next. My father was not in the
