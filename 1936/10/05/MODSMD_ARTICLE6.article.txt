Hunched over the wheel, my
father jammed the lead truck into
low. and lurched out. He had said,
"I'm not expecting you to do what

blasts. I tore out o£ the house and
down to the Armory. There the sher
iff excitedly paced the platform. "We
are expecting 2000 longshoremen,
coming down here tonight, armed to
the teeth v/ilh machine guns to blow

I Several strikers ran out to cut the
ropes on the lettuce trucks and to j
dump the loads o(T. Several of the
j armed deputies got out of their cars, j
j They were outnumbered at least j
100 to 1. The strikers began to close i
i in on them. Shot-guns were fired to
attract more deputies. The strikers
| chose to misinterpret this act to |
mean firing on them. A fist fight
started on a corner. A free-for-all
| followed throughout almost an en
lire city block. One man who was
! knocked down fired from the ground
and emptied his gun at the crowd,
j Three shots took effect, and two of
these were innocent bystanders. The
crowd was repelled with nausea gas
for the time being.
Nausea gas is terribly effective,
causing both uncontrolled vomiting
j and diarrhea.
I noticed one of (he local cops. He
had a brace of pistols around his
stomach, several billy clubs, a
sawed-off shot-gun strapped to his
thigh. He went to get on his motor
cycle, and grunted, but he couldn't
lift his leg over the seat.

billy clubs. Their job was effective

closed their shops. They were repri

Hunched over the wheel, my
father jammed the lead truck into
low. and lurched out. He had said,
"I'm not expecting you to do what

blasts. I tore out o£ the house and
down to the Armory. There the sher
iff excitedly paced the platform. "We
are expecting 2000 longshoremen,
coming down here tonight, armed to
the teeth v/ilh machine guns to blow
the town up." I looked around me,
expecting to see everyone grinning.

I Several strikers ran out to cut the
ropes on the lettuce trucks and to j
dump the loads o(T. Several of the
j armed deputies got out of their cars, j
j They were outnumbered at least j
100 to 1. The strikers began to close i
i in on them. Shot-guns were fired to
attract more deputies. The strikers
| chose to misinterpret this act to |
mean firing on them. A fist fight
started on a corner. A free-for-all
| followed throughout almost an en
lire city block. One man who was
! knocked down fired from the ground
and emptied his gun at the crowd,
j Three shots took effect, and two of
these were innocent bystanders. The
crowd was repelled with nausea gas
for the time being.
Nausea gas is terribly effective,
causing both uncontrolled vomiting
j and diarrhea.
I noticed one of (he local cops. He
had a brace of pistols around his
stomach, several billy clubs, a
sawed-off shot-gun strapped to his
thigh. He went to get on his motor
cycle, and grunted, but he couldn't
lift his leg over the seat.
