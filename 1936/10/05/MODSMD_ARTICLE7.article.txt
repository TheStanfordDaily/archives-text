# In Uniform

I snw a long line of state crips
grimly advancing. At first I could
n't understand it. They were moving
towards the packer's barricades,
driving before Ihe in a bunch of
newspaper photographers.

Two hundred state cops could
have cleaned up on the whole busi
ness, where a thousand "special dep
uties" failed. The uniform made a
difference.

I was sitting in a shipper's office
on the sixth floor of the bank build
iug. There came a knock at the door. J
I rose to open it. "Sit down," he j
yelled. He reached in his desk and
pulled out an old Spanish revolver (
and edged carefully over to the door.-
He threw it open, bellowed. "Come
in."
"Special delivery letter; sign here,
please," piped a small voice.
