# Wrongs

£ BELIEVE that there arc wrongs
on both sides. Undoubtedly the
Union with its 52 demands is exag- j
geraling slightly what they want . . .
they probably put a great many in i
for trading purposes. The shippers
on the other hand have evidently
the single idea in mind to break the |
Union while they have a chance. The
I deliberate running of trucks through J
j the main street of town was nothing
j mofe than asking for violence. Ship
! pers were warned by the sheriff and j
1 ihe police department that nothing
could be gained if they started vio- '
j letice. By running trucks through i
i the main street, they did more to stir
up violence without directly starting
it themselves than any other thing.
The shippers are so set on break
j ing the Union up they go to ex
| Ironies to accomplish their purpose.
At this point it does not seem pos
sible that an agreeable settlement
will be made. The association is
getting out quite a bit of lettuce and
\ the strikers can't do much about it.
When the fall season hits iti peak
there either will be immediate set
j tlement or a great deal more vio
j lence than has been witnessed to
date. At any rate, it is a certainty—
right or wrong—the Union will be
smashed in the valley, and it will
take years to regain its position.
