# Hamilton Wins Keeble Pen Award
## 
### 
Glenn Hamilton, passing, kicking,
slashing fullback, was awarded the
Keeble Pen this week for his out
standing play against Washington
State, after a poll of attending sports
writers had chosen him the most
valuable man on the Stanford team
that day.
Hamilton kicked most of the after
noon against Ed Goddard, and was
largely responsible for nearly 200
yards gained by the Stanford aerial
offense. He sustained a wrenched
knee, however, before the first Stan
ford score, and was replaced by Jake
Brigham.
Hamilton will be out of practice
for about a week, and will probably
miss the Oregon game this week.
