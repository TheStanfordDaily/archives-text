# Failures To Keep Frosh. Out for Year
## Sophomores May Receive Early Reinstatement; Freshmen Must Wait 
### 
The Committee on Scholarship has
enacted a significant change in the
rules governing requirements for re
instatement, according to J. P. Mit
chell, Registrar. No longer will it be
possible for a freshman to apply for
"early reinstatement" immediately
following his disqualification.
A student who has been disquali
fied during his freshman year may
apply for reinstatement only after
the lapse of at least one academic
year (3 quarters). He must then sub
mit satisfactory evidence that during
this period he has either (a) attended
college elsewhere, or (b) worked at
some gainful occupation.
Records of attendance at other col
leges or universities must reach an
average equal to that required for
admission from the institution con
cerned, and must amount to at least
one quarter or semester. Employ
ment in a gainful occupation must
show diligence, ability, and maturity
of purpose, and must amount to
seven months or more.
Sophomores may continue to pe
tition for early reinstatement, as has
been the case during the past two
years. The rule provides that "only
students who have been in residence
at Stanford University or elsewhere
for four full quarters will be eligible
for early reinstatement."
The newly adopted rules will ap
ply to first-year students at the end
of this and subsequent quarters, but
wiii not effect retroactively petitions
which have already been acted
upon.
