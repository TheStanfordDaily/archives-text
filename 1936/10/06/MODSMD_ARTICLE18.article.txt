# CAMPUS DEMOCRATS ORGANIZE
## 
### HUNTER HENDEE 
New-deal-inclined Farmers con
gregate in the Women's Clubhouse
this evening at 7:30 o'clock to elect
officers, plan campaign surprises,
and perform other essentials in re
organizing their "Stanford for
Roosevelt" squad.
Meanwhile, Republicans work
pretty much under cover, news of
their activities reaching the ears of
this reporter chiefly through the
vague medium of rumor.
(«.(>.P. Active at Cal
Enthusiastic Landon support is re
ported on Campus Cal by Publicity
man Eric •Cullenward. Significance
of this news rests on the fact that
supposedly Cal and Stanford Repub
licans arc working in cahoots on the
two campi—the Berkeley Old Guard
having already enlisted to their sup
port some "several hundred." as re
ported by Alden Smith, ex-U.S.C.
prexy and big-wig of the Cal-Farm
Republican cause.
Stanford democrats, on the other

hand, are well versed in the old-time
art of political wrangling. Says Ste
phen Enke, grad student who prom
ises to figure bright in New Deal
campus spotlight tonight, "While Re
publican Liberal League paid agents
are fumbling around the campus try
ing to arouse enough enthusiasm to
organize a club, the Stanford Young
Democrats, without outside induce
ment, are going into spontaneous ac
tion."
:50ft-50ft Will Vote
Senior Charles Zucker: "We ought
to have a greater turn-out on the
campus this year than they had in
1032 because people are no longer
awed by Mr. Hoover of San Juan
Hill."
Determined to avenge the campus
defeat of '32, Young Democrats here
around will go forth to ballyhoo the
same three to five hundred Farm
tied voters to vote the Roosevelt
way.
Admit Ballyhoo
They don't beat about the brush

when it comes to this politics busi
ness. "It's not education—it's just
plain ballyhooing — and all the fun
that goes with it." That seems to be
the motive of these campus Demo
crats.
Tonight, besides electing leaders to
carry on the official business, they
will decide to just what tactics they
will resort to poll the votes for their!
Washington favorites. Rallies. I
dances, barbecues, debates — they'll j
all be suggested, discussed, and de
cided upon.
Toyon Resident William Ward, an
other of the spring "Stanford for
Roosevelt'-ers and therefore anoth
er potential mogul tonight and
thereafter, mentions his laundry
business as means of college support
and says, "No intelligent student
who has had to earn his way through
Stanford can fail to appreciate the
things Roosevelt has done for us
both through the NYA on the cam
pus and through business recovery
at home."
