# Graduate Kills Self at Carmel
## Fisher Elected Member Of Phi Beta Kappa 
### 
James M. Fisher, '21, who received
his A.B. in German last June with
Phi Beta Kappa honors was found
dead yesterday in an inlet below
Granite Creek Bridge, five miles
south of CaiTnel Highlands.
Fisher's body, with a bullet hole
through his head, was an undoubted
case of suicide according to Coroner
J. A. Cornell of the Monterey County
staff.
Suspicious of an automobile that
had been parked near their house
for three days, Mr. and Mrs. Edward
Doud of Monterey informed the
Monterey police. Because of dark
ness, the police were only able to
guess at the position of the body.
They found it the next day in a
small cove near the bridge.
Fisher, a member of Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity, left home Wed
nesday afternoon ostensibly to
keep a business appointment in San
Francisco but was never seen alive
again.
He had been living at the home of
his aunt in Palo Alto since his
graduation last June. His parents
had been dead for many years.
