TOLEDO, Spain. Oct. 5 W).â€”ln
surgent romforcements today moved
up to bolster the "ring of steel" en
circling Madrid.
Fascist guerrilla bands speeded a
"mopping-up drive" in the Toledo
area, sweeping the countryside to
pave the way for the final "big push"
on Madrid.
The government forces, spurred
by "do or die" orders from Madrid,
were putting up a desperate resist
ance in fierce hand to hand skir
mishes, but fascists claimed repeated
victories.
