# Three Officials Concede W.S.C. Game Victory To Stanford
## Movies Prove Indians Won On Last Play No Formal Protest To Be Lodged; Team Boycott On Morris Reported 
### 
Three members of the Pacific
Coast Conference Officials' Asso
ciation last night inspected motion
pictures in San Francisco of Sat
urday s Stanford - Washington
State football game and were
unanimous in the opinion that Jake
Brigham's lourth down plunge
was a touchdown, according to the
Associated Press. The three offi
cials, who requested that their
names be withheld, said that the
motion picture definitely showed
that Brigham went over the line in
his fourth line plunge.
Meanwhile, charges against Ref
eree Bobby Morris seemed headed
only for the realm of unofficial dis
cussion. Officials of the Pacific Coast
Conference said they would take no
action unless Stanford lodged a pro
test. Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur told
The Daily last night that contrary to
a report carried in this morning's
San Francisco Chronicle, he had def
initely instructed General Manager
Alfred R. Masters of the Board of
Athletic Control not to lodge an offi
cial protest.
The Chronicle also published a
rumor that players on the Stanford
varsity had notified Coach Tiny
Thornhill that they would refuse to
play in any other game this season
at which Morris officiates. Thornhill
could not be reached for a state
ment at a late hour last night, and
inquiries to assistant coaches met the
rfÂ»nly ; "Talk to Tiny "
"We don't want to play in front of
Morris again," the players are re
ported to have said. "We'll play only
if you positively order us."
Morris is scheduled to work at
least one more Stanford game, prob
ably against Washington here, the
Chronicle said.
