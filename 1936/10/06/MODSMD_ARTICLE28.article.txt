WOTTA MESS
The amateur legal experts in the
back parlor have brought out the
heavy artillery again. This time
they aim the blast at Officer Gordy
Davis and the Men's Council on the
idea that these two symbols of law
and order are operating without au
thority.
This is a serious charge, and it is
brought forth here not as a fact but
as an interesting theory that might
prove even more fascinating if true.
The trouble is that the shotgun the
amateur experts are handling is go

However, on to the firing line
Bing bang No. 1: Stanford Univer

speed laws do not apply on private
property. Saying that Stanford is a

Big backfire No. 1: A special state

Big bang No. 2: Does the Men's
Council court give you the right of
jury trial? If it doesn't, isn't it un
constitutional?
Big backfire No. 2: If you don't
like the Council's idea of justice,
then take your case to the San Jose
courts.
Big bang No. 3: All right then,
supose some of the members of the
Men's Council happen to be under
21. They can't get drinks, but can
they administer justice?
Little backfire No. 3: Does any
body know whether the California
State constitution says anything
about the age of justices?

At this point the sour griper con
