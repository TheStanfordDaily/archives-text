Stanford traditions from way-way
back are being hauled out into the
open under direction of Miss Louise
Price, head of the Union unit.
Dr. W. E. Cowley, of Ohio State,
was allotted a fund by the Carnegie
foundation to organize a national i
study of college traditions. Though
work was begun on the project in
11)32, Miss Price did not take it in
hand at Stanford until last January j
when she collaborated with Mr. Gil- 1
belt C. Wrenn, former director of
personnel.
Comb Files
Assisted by four journalism ma
jors, working under the NYA allot
ment, Miss Price has combed back
files of The Daily, Chappie, and
Quad as well as the Stanford and
Timothy Hopkins collections.
Miss Price's researches go back to
the times when Stanford had only
500 students—giving it the desired
100 edge over Berkeley — and the
campus was so small and intimate
students know even the love affairs
of the faculty, "who were all very
yuung then," Miss Price explained.
Origin of Colors
Did you know that Cardinal—
NOT red and white—is Stanford's
official color The first official col
lege color was gold, but some stu
dents, objecting to the similarity to
Cal. chose Cardinal. There was a
heated battle between color factions,
and the prcesnt scheme was chosen
when San Francisco papers came out
J after the Stanford-Cal game with
"Cardinal defeats Blue and Gold."
i This is one of many traditions un
j earthed by Miss Price.
Beware
Anyone with that which he would
conceal in his Stanford past should
: cover his tracks quickly before Miss
Price tells about a now prominent
graduate and the "Farm's" most fa
mous beer bust, or the time Ben
| Eastman led Encinamen through
Roble halls during a pajarrtarino.
When sufficient material has been
collected the Carnegie Fund will
publish a complete book on "Amer
ican College Traditions," in which
i Stanford will have a section.

Beware
Anyone with that which he would
conceal in his Stanford past should
: cover his tracks quickly before Miss
Price tells about a now prominent
graduate and the "Farm's" most fa
mous beer bust, or the time Ben
| Eastman led Encinamen through
Roble halls during a pajarrtarino.
When sufficient material has been
collected the Carnegie Fund will
publish a complete book on "Amer
ican College Traditions," in which
i Stanford will have a section.
