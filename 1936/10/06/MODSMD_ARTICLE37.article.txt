# Thorn hill Will Ignore Squawk About Officials
## Tony Calvelli Moved To Fullback; Hamilton, Grant on Injured List 
### Herb Diamond 
Referee Bobby Morris, who worked
in the Stanford-Washington State
game, is alleged to have "coached"
Ed Goddard, Cougar quarterback.
'I'fcere is also the matter of several
decisions on the- part of officials in
both the Pullman and the Bronco
contests, that might be called ques
tionable.
As a matter of fact, questionable
decisions have played no small part
on the gridiron so far this season;
some dopesters even go so far as to
say they cost Stanford a probable
win last Saturday afternoon and a
possible scoreless tie a week before.
Tiny Not Interested
But Tiny Thornhill, the man who
should have most to say about the
whole thing if there is anything to be
said at all, reiterated his earlier
statements last night to the effect
that he plans to do exactly nothing
about it. Thus the Cardinals trotted
onto the practice turf yesterday
afternoon; this time in preparation
for Saturday's battle with Oregon,
apparently regarding past history as
just that.
Fullback Glenn Hamilton, Keeble
award winner this week for his work
in the Washington State fracas,
limped off the train yesterday morn
ing wilh an injured knee that will
keep him on the sidelines for at
least a week.
Others Hurt
Also on the sick list now are Pop
Grant, suffering from a bruised
shoulder, and Pete Zagar, whose eye
is a deep blue. There is little chance
that either of these men will see
action against Oregon, according to
Dr. Blake Wilbur, team physician
who made the northern jaunt.
Also missing from practice yester
day were Bob Dakan and Chet Ol
cott, reserve ends. Dakan is in the
hospital with flu, while Olcott re
mained in Portland with his sick
mother.
Backfield Changes
Thinning of the fullback ranks
by loss of Bill Paulman and then
Hamilton has caused Tiny to shift
in Tony Calvelli to the position.
Tony, a rugged little center trans
fer from San Mateo, worked all
afternoon at the position to prepare
himself for Saturday. Jake Brigham
is still leading the ranks here but
will be relieved by Calvelli and may
be even by Fred Williams, who
played the spot last year.
Oregon, after their 26-0 loss to
U.S.C. last week, looks to be the
best bet the Cards have met to date.
However, the 26-0 on the other hand
may mean the coming of another
Trojan powerhouse; so it'll be a ball
game, coming and going.

in Tony Calvelli to the position.
Tony, a rugged little center trans
fer from San Mateo, worked all
afternoon at the position to prepare
himself for Saturday. Jake Brigham
is still leading the ranks here but
will be relieved by Calvelli and may
be even by Fred Williams, who
played the spot last year.
Oregon, after their 26-0 loss to
U.S.C. last week, looks to be the
best bet the Cards have met to date.
However, the 26-0 on the other hand
may mean the coming of another
Trojan powerhouse; so it'll be a ball
game, coming and going.
Referee Bobby Morris, who worked
in the Stanford-Washington State
game, is alleged to have "coached"
Ed Goddard, Cougar quarterback.
'I'fcere is also the matter of several
decisions on the- part of officials in
both the Pullman and the Bronco
contests, that might be called ques
tionable.
As a matter of fact, questionable
decisions have played no small part
on the gridiron so far this season;
some dopesters even go so far as to
say they cost Stanford a probable
win last Saturday afternoon and a
possible scoreless tie a week before.
Tiny Not Interested
But Tiny Thornhill, the man who
should have most to say about the
whole thing if there is anything to be
said at all, reiterated his earlier
statements last night to the effect
that he plans to do exactly nothing
about it. Thus the Cardinals trotted
onto the practice turf yesterday
afternoon; this time in preparation
for Saturday's battle with Oregon,
apparently regarding past history as
just that.
Fullback Glenn Hamilton, Keeble
award winner this week for his work
in the Washington State fracas,
limped off the train yesterday morn
ing wilh an injured knee that will
keep him on the sidelines for at
least a week.
Others Hurt
Also on the sick list now are Pop
Grant, suffering from a bruised
shoulder, and Pete Zagar, whose eye
is a deep blue. There is little chance
that either of these men will see
action against Oregon, according to
Dr. Blake Wilbur, team physician
who made the northern jaunt.
Also missing from practice yester
day were Bob Dakan and Chet Ol
cott, reserve ends. Dakan is in the
hospital with flu, while Olcott re
mained in Portland with his sick
mother.
Backfield Changes
Thinning of the fullback ranks
by loss of Bill Paulman and then
Hamilton has caused Tiny to shift
in Tony Calvelli to the position.
