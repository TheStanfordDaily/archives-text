# Shutouts Feature Week-end Football
## 
### 
That "inches"- game at Pullman
dwarfed all other Coast grid games
this week-end for exciting finishes,
but when St. Mary's took Cal for a
rideâ€”well, that was somethin'.
And did the galloping beef trust
go! The actual score was 10-0, but
in winning the game, the Gaels
showed enough power to score, it
seemed, at will. California threat
ened only once, at the start of the
second half, but its attack petered
out on the three-yard line.
At Los Angeles, Trojan fans dug
out dust-covered memories of
U.S.C.'s famous thundering herds, as
Howard Jones' 1936 edition trampled
Oregon 2G-0, after a scoreless first
half.
Other coast greenswards saw these
results
U.C.L.A. 30. Montana 0
Washington 22, Idaho 0
U.S.F. 13, San Jose State 0
Oregon State 13, Willamette 0
Santa Clara 27, Portland U. 0
The Faculty Women will be of
fered a swimming course starting to
morrow. The classes are to be held
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
at 10 a.m. in the Women's Gvm.
