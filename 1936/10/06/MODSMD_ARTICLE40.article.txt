At 10:30 yesterday morning the
regular S.P. local puffed in, dis-
I charged its load, and then started on.
j The load was the 1936 Big Red
Machine and entourage, fresh home
from the most unexpected, the most
valiant, and the most heartbreaking
second half stand seen in football
for many a day.
There were about 20 of us down
I there and some 20 more Palo Alto
citizens, to shake their weary hands
and congratulate them.
They were pleasant, very quiet,
and glad to be back. To what?
THEY HAD AN
EVENTFUL TRIP
After lunch, though, things sink
, back to normal, and the tales may be
! told.
In the first place, nobody accused
| anybody of anything, as the 4-inch
Hearstian headline would indicate.
Protests are rare in football, and
beefing is unheard of from Stanford
teams. This one is no exception.
The boys evidently were discuss
ing the officials in the showers after
the game—they always do—and evi
dently there was plenty to discuss
on this score, but odd or even, what

the players say in the showers is
their own business, and should not
be twisted into gripes about losing
the game.
After putting up a battle like they
did, and losing by so little, the result
is bound to be a sore subject with
them, but they certainly don't de
serve the derision of being called
poor sports.
The movies will certainly be inter
esting, and should end all the argu
ments, but it seems to me that the
team already had it all finished off
right in their first remarks when hit
ting the campus:
CALL PRAISE
FOR TIIE COUGARS
"Jeez, that Goddard is good. Kick?
We shure coulda used old Wimp
against them Saturday. Pass?
Straight an' flat." "Yeh,, they used
an awfully heavy line against us—
seven or eight men at °s, and it
hurt our running attk
Most of them say "*s did
step out on his 55-y +,hat
Brigham made at .tra
touchdown, maybe two. „• pen
alties, Stone's for clipping reined to
find less favor than thai on Hamilton
for interference.
Moving pictures of the game,
which the B.A.C. hopes to have ready
this week, should clear up some of
these things, but remember, gang—
nokjpdy is perfect (some Democrats
doubt this) in calling hard ones in a
hurry and men aren't appointed to
work big games and coach one of the
teams. Morris has worked a lot of
the best of them without a whimper.
STATISTICS A GOOD
CAUSE FOR CHEEK
The Monday morning quarterbacks
find the statistics a big improvement
over last week—Stanford gained 278
yards to 228 for the Cougars. First
downs were also on our side, 12 to 6,
while Tiny's pass drill last week
netted him 222 yards from the 13
good out of 26 passes that were at
tempted. Stanford recovered 4
fumbles during the afternoon, one
for a touchdown, but were deficient,
34 to 40, in the average length of
punts. That's a significant one.
So here they are back with us,
with the season barely under way.
Only 15 of them played up there,
speaking well for the Cardinal con
ditioning program, and showing us
that at least one team of them, and
maybe more, is all set to show us
some real ball games from here on.

STATISTICS A GOOD
CAUSE FOR CHEEK
The Monday morning quarterbacks
find the statistics a big improvement
over last week—Stanford gained 278
yards to 228 for the Cougars. First
downs were also on our side, 12 to 6,
while Tiny's pass drill last week
netted him 222 yards from the 13
good out of 26 passes that were at
tempted. Stanford recovered 4
fumbles during the afternoon, one
for a touchdown, but were deficient,
34 to 40, in the average length of
punts. That's a significant one.
So here they are back with us,
with the season barely under way.
Only 15 of them played up there,
speaking well for the Cardinal con
ditioning program, and showing us
that at least one team of them, and
maybe more, is all set to show us
some real ball games from here on.

The ancient '"Neanderthal man"
was short, and walked in a stooping
posture, with his head thrust far
forward.
At 10:30 yesterday morning the
regular S.P. local puffed in, dis-
I charged its load, and then started on.
j The load was the 1936 Big Red
Machine and entourage, fresh home
from the most unexpected, the most
valiant, and the most heartbreaking
second half stand seen in football
for many a day.
There were about 20 of us down
I there and some 20 more Palo Alto
citizens, to shake their weary hands
and congratulate them.
They were pleasant, very quiet,
and glad to be back. To what?
THEY HAD AN
EVENTFUL TRIP
After lunch, though, things sink
, back to normal, and the tales may be
! told.
In the first place, nobody accused
| anybody of anything, as the 4-inch
Hearstian headline would indicate.
Protests are rare in football, and
beefing is unheard of from Stanford
teams. This one is no exception.
The boys evidently were discuss
ing the officials in the showers after
the game—they always do—and evi
dently there was plenty to discuss
on this score, but odd or even, what

the players say in the showers is
their own business, and should not
be twisted into gripes about losing
the game.
After putting up a battle like they
did, and losing by so little, the result
is bound to be a sore subject with
them, but they certainly don't de
serve the derision of being called
poor sports.
The movies will certainly be inter
esting, and should end all the argu
ments, but it seems to me that the
team already had it all finished off
