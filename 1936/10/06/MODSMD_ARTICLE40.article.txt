At 10:30 yesterday morning the
regular S.P. local puffed in, dis-
I charged its load, and then started on.
j The load was the 1936 Big Red
Machine and entourage, fresh home
from the most unexpected, the most
valiant, and the most heartbreaking
second half stand seen in football
for many a day.
There were about 20 of us down
I there and some 20 more Palo Alto
citizens, to shake their weary hands
and congratulate them.
They were pleasant, very quiet,
and glad to be back. To what?
THEY HAD AN
EVENTFUL TRIP
After lunch, though, things sink
, back to normal, and the tales may be
! told.
In the first place, nobody accused
| anybody of anything, as the 4-inch
Hearstian headline would indicate.
Protests are rare in football, and
beefing is unheard of from Stanford
teams. This one is no exception.
The boys evidently were discuss
ing the officials in the showers after
the game—they always do—and evi
dently there was plenty to discuss
on this score, but odd or even, what

the players say in the showers is
their own business, and should not
be twisted into gripes about losing
the game.
After putting up a battle like they
did, and losing by so little, the result
is bound to be a sore subject with
them, but they certainly don't de
serve the derision of being called
poor sports.
The movies will certainly be inter
esting, and should end all the argu
ments, but it seems to me that the
team already had it all finished off
right in their first remarks when hit
ting the campus:

"Jeez, that Goddard is good. Kick?
We shure coulda used old Wimp
