# Water Poloists Prepare For Athens Meet
## Haslacher Heads Strong Squad; First Game In Encina Pools Tuesday 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton is pointing
his rugged varsity water poloists
toward their first encounter with the
Athens Club water dogs in the En
cina Pool a week from tonight.
Thornton is out to avenge last
year's disastrous season, and his
Cardinal mermen are out for noth
ing less than championships in both
the Pacific Coast Conference and the
Northern California Water Polo
League.
Squad Experienced
The husky Card mentor will have
no worries about lack of experience
among his players, as he will have a
strong veteran squad to throw at the
Athenians in the night tussle next
week.
Captain Bob Haslacher will be in
his familiar position in the net. Bob
has been a Coast all-star for two
years, and his early season work
shows him well on the way to a third
successive season of honors.
"Luisetti of Water Polo"
In the backfield wil be Chuck
Griffn, Jack Loupe, and Don Peter
son, who have all played with the
Olympic Club septette. Thornton will
also have Ben Voss and Pat Pearson
to shoot into the guard positions.
In the forward spots will be Bob
Hoover, only returning first string
forward; Jack Vibert, who should
take the sprint from any center for
ward on the coast; Bill Hanna, who
has played with the Olympic Club;
and John Lamb, who has appro
priately been tagged "the Luisetti of
water polo," due to his sensational
ball handling on last year's frosh
squad.
