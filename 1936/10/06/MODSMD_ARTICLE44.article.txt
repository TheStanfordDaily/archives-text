# 2.509 Rooters Buy S.C. Game Pickets
## 
### 
Sale of 2309 rooters' tickets to the
U.S.C.-Stanford game was announc
ed yesterday by Don Liebendorfer,
a gain of about 300 over the number
sold two years ago, when the Indians
last entertained the Trojans.
Although the sale this year is larg
er than twb years ago, the registra
tion figures show the percentage of
students purchasing ducats to be no
larger than before, despite every ef
fort by the B.A.C. to give students a
chance to secure their tickets.
