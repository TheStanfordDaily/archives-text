# Freshman Eleven Recuperates While Subs Scrimmage
## Fullback Patton Is Ready For Action Against Black Foxe Eleven 
### Tim Sullivan 
Frosh gridders who had a part in
the ham-stringing of the U.S.C.
eleven rested yesterday while third
and fourth string men scrimmaged
against one another as the coaching
staff watched eagerly for hidden
talent.
Foremost example of said "hidden
talent" was Jack Grover, pass toss
ing fullback, who played one of the
leading roles in the drama that ended
with a 7-6 win over the Trobabes.
Grover had been an obscure fourth
stringer until his sudden climb to
stardom Saturday.
Patton Plays Possum
Absent from the starting lineup in
the SC fracas was Chet Patton the
Portland pile driver who usually
handles the fullbacking chores for
Mr. Shipkey's gang. Chet was hob
bling around with a game ankle and
remained on the bench for the full
GO minutes. He will be ready for
action next week however.
Having been confined to a limited
amount of space in yesterday's tab
loid, we failed to take due notice of
the masterful job turned in by half
back Chad Reade in running back
enemy punts. Time and again the
San Francisco speed burner eluded
three and four potential Trojan
tacklers, only to fall at length into
the clutches of a fifth.
Punting Prowess Pays
Gene Coldiron's kicking likewise
pulled the Frosh out of many a hole,
his punting prowess being the more

commendable because the SC babes i
were much publicized for their I
ability to block kicks.
Linemen Damarus, Willard, and i
Andersen displayed a fine brand of |
heads up ball in hopping on three of
the southerners' fumbles to half what

would otherwise have been touch
down drives.
With added confidence that comes
from the taste of Trojan horse meat,
the Papooses have taken it upon
themselves to engage the Black Foxe
Military Academy next Saturday.
