# Daily Tryouts
## 
### 
Along about this time of year, there is frenetic
activity in the activities. Various managers and
office sitters-in-chief attempt to entice wary
frosh into their various gymnastics. The Daily
is no exception.
We sometimes wonder why anybody tries
out for The Daily. Daily members don't get
blankets and pins for meritorious service in
beating down the pressman at the back shop
at 12:00 o'clock at night. We don't have any
ritual or songs other than when Eis and Hodge
wind up on "The Old Mill Stream" or "The
Stars and Stripes Forever," while the night edi
tor waits for their copy, and you only get your
picture in the paper when you run for editor.
But strangely enough people do come out
for The Daily. They seem to like the noise and
excitement, and some of the lady staff members,
and they get to meet the Big Shots and write
their weighty statements for them. Then there
is a staff picnic or two, a staff meeting, and
afternoon club every week, and sometimes a
banquet.
As an activity The Daily is good enough.
Being a Daily copy editor may not raise the
national standing of the house to as great an
extent as being fourth string on the Grays, but
it raises it higher than four units of sitting in
the parlor talking with the boys.
Atmosphere, flavor, and a desire to be in an
activity may start most of us out to being col
lege journalists, but it doesn't hold us. It's some
thing else. It's more than the smell of the ink
on the galleys, it's more than the welcome
sound of the bank boy knocking out the page
proofs, it's mixed up with the fatal, debilitating
obsession of the business, the idea that in our
own stupid way we are doing something worth
while, and there is fun in working if there seems
to be a purpose in it.
The Daily wants talent, both of the journalistic
and activity man type. Somewhere in the audi
ence there is a frustrated genius, though not
quite as frustrated as our Stockton correspond
ent, Mr. Kruppa, perhaps. All that this genius
needs to some encouragement and avenue for
expression. This edit is meant for encourage
ment. The Daily is meant for expression.

thing else. It's more than the smell of the ink
on the galleys, it's more than the welcome
sound of the bank boy knocking out the page
proofs, it's mixed up with the fatal, debilitating
obsession of the business, the idea that in our
own stupid way we are doing something worth
while, and there is fun in working if there seems
to be a purpose in it.
The Daily wants talent, both of the journalistic
and activity man type. Somewhere in the audi
ence there is a frustrated genius, though not
quite as frustrated as our Stockton correspond
ent, Mr. Kruppa, perhaps. All that this genius
needs to some encouragement and avenue for
expression. This edit is meant for encourage
ment. The Daily is meant for expression.
Along about this time of year, there is frenetic
activity in the activities. Various managers and
office sitters-in-chief attempt to entice wary
frosh into their various gymnastics. The Daily
is no exception.
We sometimes wonder why anybody tries
out for The Daily. Daily members don't get
blankets and pins for meritorious service in
beating down the pressman at the back shop
at 12:00 o'clock at night. We don't have any
ritual or songs other than when Eis and Hodge
wind up on "The Old Mill Stream" or "The
Stars and Stripes Forever," while the night edi
tor waits for their copy, and you only get your
picture in the paper when you run for editor.
But strangely enough people do come out
for The Daily. They seem to like the noise and
excitement, and some of the lady staff members,
and they get to meet the Big Shots and write
their weighty statements for them. Then there
is a staff picnic or two, a staff meeting, and
afternoon club every week, and sometimes a
banquet.
As an activity The Daily is good enough.
Being a Daily copy editor may not raise the
national standing of the house to as great an
extent as being fourth string on the Grays, but
it raises it higher than four units of sitting in
the parlor talking with the boys.
Atmosphere, flavor, and a desire to be in an
activity may start most of us out to being col
lege journalists, but it doesn't hold us. It's some
thing else. It's more than the smell of the ink
on the galleys, it's more than the welcome
sound of the bank boy knocking out the page
proofs, it's mixed up with the fatal, debilitating
obsession of the business, the idea that in our
own stupid way we are doing something worth
