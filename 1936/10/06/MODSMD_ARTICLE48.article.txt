# We Lose Again
## 
### 
For one who has been around here a couple
of years, it is an entirely new sensation to lose
two football games in succession at the begin
ning of the season.
Until the injuries hit Tiny Thornhill's Palo
Alto boys, a lot of the old wags around here
really had entertained hopes of getting back in
the Rose Bowl again this year, just to laugh at
the boys who said "You can't do it." The Bowl
prospect is no longer so rosy.
There are other things that are rosy, though.
One thing is that Stanford is lucky to have a
psychologically-sound football coach, able not
only at parrying with alumni, the students, the
press, but with the team. If Thornhill is a super
coach, and there are those who swear it, he is
pretty sensible about it.
Another thing is that Stanford is lucky to
have a psychologically-sound football team.
They showed that in the W.S.C. game.
Another thing is that Stanford has a psycho
logically-sound student body (in regard to foot
ball). Win-or lose, the only thing that can move
the Stanford student body is a dish of prunes.
No particular adulation for the football heroes,
only respect and sympathy. No hysteria, and
little overemphasis.
We have lost two games. There are indica
tions that we may not lose many more. But
despite these rosy indications, the most rosy is
that Stanford's over-emphasis on football is not
as bad as the sporting greens would have it, all
because various pivotal groups are psycholo
logically sound.
