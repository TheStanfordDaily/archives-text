# Latinsâ€”Lousy Lovers

"Esquire" and "Fortune" magazines got off to
A good start this month by being banned by a
couple of nations with delicate nerves. Japan
took a dislike to an article in the latter publica
tion, but this can hardly be called news, for
Japan is very touchy about a fellow named
Hirohito. Cuba decided to add its name to the
list of countries who, at one time or another,
have banned "Esquire."
The October number of "Esquire" contains an
anonymous article on the absorbing subject,
"Latins are Lousy Lovers," and Cuba didn't like

the idea. They therefore saw to it that no copies
of the magazine were distributed in their Gar
den of Eden. "Esquire" can stand the blow,
however, for not long ago publication was
banned by several European nations.
"Fortune" fell into disfavor by printing an
issue devoted entirely to Japan. Five men, in
cluding a Japanese, worked five months gather
ing the material, two of the men spending three
months in Japan. Great care was taken to avoid
offense, but, it appears, to no avail. The issue
was banned because an article "treated Emperor
Hirohito indelicately."
Considering the way Japan is run, they may
have some excuse for keeping out literature
which they fear might be contrary to whatever
kind of propaganda they themselves issue, but
Cuba seems to be straining the point. The only
apparent reason the government could have had
in banning the offending issue of "Esquire" must
lie in the fact that the people of the island re
public, hot-blooded as they are purported to be,
might have demanded a march on Chicago and
"Esquire" in an attempt to save their reputations
and the tourist trade.
We're different in this country. Nothing gives
us more pleasure than to pay a pseudo-cynic like
G. B. Shaw to come over here and insult us. And
when it comes to magazines attacking the gov
ernment, we don't have to import them: we
foster our own.
