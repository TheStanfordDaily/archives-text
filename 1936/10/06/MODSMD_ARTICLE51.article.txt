WIIO WINS THE BONEIIEAD DERBY?
It can't be true that "no one is more stupid than a
voter."
The politicos themselves have belied that preach
ment. In their practice of it they indicate that for
sheer thickheadedness, it is they, rather than the vot
ers, who win the fur-lined dunce cap.
It takes sublimated stupidity to compose the verbal
bunglings bellowed from the political rostrum. It takes
only garden variety stupidity to accept them. Which
reasoning, if valid, automatically retires the voter in
the 1936 bonehead derby, and automatically puts the
politico in first place.

Leading is no comic strip Senator Widcbottom, but
the Colonel—so very, very sincere that he sometimes
brings tears rather than cheers.
The last name is Knox. Unlike a University econ
omist, the Colonel is a business man. He is chief
mouthpiece of the Republican Party largely for that
reason—and because he is a case-hardened positivist.
His running-mate, a newspaper feature service
character named Alf, is entirely too reasonable. In
his first two speeches he showed the intelligence fatal
to a good rousing campaign. He admitted that his
party would be faced by the same problems as the
party in office—that nowhere in the Republican ranks
was there a Merlin who could dispose of the relief
problem, as an example, in exchange for votes.

All Alf did was somewhat plaintively wail, "Let Us
Play, Too." Then they wired the Colonel for sound.
The Colonel didn't want to play, he wanted to fight,
which was a step in the right direction.
He was "sick and tired," very human for such a
big man.
Moreover, the Colonel had the right remedy. It was
Knox's Pot-Still Panacea. All you had to do was pat
business on the head, stop changing its regulatory dia
pers, and give it two encouraging doses of old Doc
Knox's shoe-polish to get money moving as money
should move.

We thought of Doc Townscnd as a winner, but
the Doc had the wrong label on his sugar-syrup. Father
Coughlin didn't market his stuff in the right container.
And Lcmko, well, ho wok just, a corner drug store man
at heart, trying to break into the wholesale field.
But Doc Knox. He's got lithographed labels. And
we'll stick ear muffs in the fur-lined cap—so he can
hear himself think, if any.
