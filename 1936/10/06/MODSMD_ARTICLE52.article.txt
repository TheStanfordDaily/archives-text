# OUR HASHER

You'd think that after all those years of writing
down footnotes and upending appendectomies, that
all this brain power we've got stored down in those
bins in the faculty cubicles could settle once and for
all the matter of a little thing like the Demo-Gop con
troversy. But they can't..
This fact assumes a deadly significance at such
places as faculty teas and bridge parties. And anything
of deadly significance at a faculty tea is very deadly
indeed.
The torts and feasance school of thought as repre
sented by a certain Dr. W. came to a decided clash one
evening with the car loadings and industrial index de
partment as represented by a certain Dr. W, over a
cup of coffee and a snail, and a grand slam in no
trumps.
Dr. W of torts was an ardent Republican, and you
know what that means. Dr. W of loadings was one of
these "unbiased Democrats," and you know what that
means. The Republican was berating the New Deal
for disgusting things in relation to the Civil Service.
The Democrat said, "I'll bet that Farley has never done
an illegal or dishonest thing in public office."
Dr. W, Republican, said: "I'll bet he has."
"All right," said Dr. W. Democrat, slyly reaching
down into his wallet, "here's a hundred dollars if you
can prove it."
Dr. W. Republican, muttered something about being
terribly busy, and returned to his coffee, his snail, and
his> footnotes.
