Romeo and Juliet (MGM) at the
Geary Theater, San Francisco, proves
that advance publicity can be true,
and that Hollywood, when she sets
out to produce Shakespeare of which
the poet would be proud, can do so.
Acting, itself fine, is yet less grati
fying than technical elements, pos
sible only in the medium of the talk
ing picture, that are here utilized.
Settings, delicate Renaissance inte
riors, the public square at Verona,
formal gardens with their pools and
fountains and cedar groves, each in
itself is a study. Costumes are rich,
authentic. And no stoop is Juliet's
balcony, but a high lookout which
Romeo must half-scale.
Use Script Intact
No concession is made to the
masses, fortunately; Shakespeare's
"script" remains largely intact. It is
a pleasure to hear the balcony scene
spoken softly, not shouted. And the
cloudy details of the sending of the
friar's message are finally cleared in
an episode occurring before the
tragedy's climax.
Norma Shearer as a lithe and satis
fyingly youthful Juliet, succeeds in
achieving the strength of character
demanded of her when she deter
mines to drink the potion. If Leslie
Howard is a mild and somewhat
tired Romeo, he is agile at least,
splendid in the love scenes. Edna
Mae Oliver gives a highly individual
characterization of the nurse, makes
of her a garrulous, crochety protec
toress. John Barrymore as Mercutio
romps and grimaces through his role
with an almost uncontrolled relish.
If he overacts he does give a gusto to
the company.
No Mob Scenes
Basil Rathbone is a scornful, im
petuous Tybalt, and Reginald Denny
as Benvolio is stout,- able.
MGM has not made the error of
making of Shakespeare a "spec
tacle." There are no weary mob
scenes; the mercenaries of the Capu
lets and the Montagues do not out
rank Caesar's armies. "Romeo and
Juliet" becomes more than a drama
photographed by the films; it is con
verted into a new medium, and re
mains art. â€”Warson
