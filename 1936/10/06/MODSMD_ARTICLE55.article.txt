IT'S A SHAME that such a swell
tune as "Did I Remember?" was
wasted on such a mediocre picture j
as "Suzy." But then I guess MGM
didn't expect it to be such a hit. Al
though popular, it was never such a
sensation the first time it came out
about eight years ago. It was called
"Fancy Our Meeting" then, and Jack
Buchanan and Elsie Randolph (Wal
ter Winchell to the contrary not
withstanding) sang it in the British
musical comedy success, "That's a
Good Girl."
WHAT'S THE MATTER with
waltzes? Nobody seems to be play
ing them anymore, and those that
are heard are so much tripe. The
best ones, such as "Frag' Nicht," "Je
Vous Adore" (the French depart
ment will tell you it should be "Je
T'Adore"), and "Follo,w Your Heart," j
get an occasional hearing, then dis
appear from the airlanes. Why, dam
mit, why?
THIS MAY SHOCK some of you
boys who used to worship George
Olsen, but the maestro has taken
over Orville Knapp's band, vocal
ists, style, and slogan (a new style
in melody). They're at the Hotel
Gibso/i in Cincinnatti and sound just
exactly as Knapp used to.
STATE OF THE NATION ITEM:
The highly debatable question, "Who
should take care of the baby at j
night?" will be the basis for the first i
discussion presented by the new ra
dio program, "Husbands and Wives,"
over KGO at 6:30 tonight.
