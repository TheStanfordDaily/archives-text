# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						ORDER CHANGETH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Once upon a time there was a uni
versity by the name of Stanford that
was known for its "roughs" and gen
eral informal atmosphere. At that
time it was a pleasure coming back
in the fall. Everyone knew every
body else and everyone, even the
famed "500," smiled and said, j
"Hello." That was the chapter in
Stanford's history when the school
was a man's university.
Along came 1933 and with it a new
era of, shall we call it: the Lost (
Rough, perhaps better yet the Turn
ing of a Man's University Into a
Woman's University. The Adminis- j
tration did a very good job of that
\\ hen the bars were lowered on !
women. At first the change was not 1
very noticeable because, thank
heaven, there were still some good
old roughs left.

Not many of the old roughs were I
here last year; this year it is so >
noticeable that an old grad would
have to ask if he was really in the
right place. The women are no
longer friendly. One might say that
(he new ones are snooty social- !
seeking skirts.
The men used to go to dances in
sweaters and old moleskins or cords;
neckties were unknown. The Stan
ford HE-MAN has turned into a
sissy kisser. I think that it might be
a courtesy some time this year to
give the old rough a fitting burial.
It might satisfy those who have seen
the old order change.
One Who Was Here in 1932
Non-streamlined sedans waste j
about half of their power, at 30 miles

sistance.
