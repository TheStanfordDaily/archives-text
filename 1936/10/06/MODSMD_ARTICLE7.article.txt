# Soph Pugilist Gives Life Saving Blood
## 
### 
According to a late flash sent di
rect from the hospital, a Stanford
sophomore boxer, Bill Wilber, re
cently benefited an unknown person
through the medium of one pint of
blood.
Economically, Wilber's sacrifice
was a worthwhile oneâ€”he collected
$25 for his bloody loss. It was his
first transfusion.
