# Committee May Ban Mud-fight
## Unit Requirement May Be Placed on Salaried Student Body Offices 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
What may be the last of Stan
ford's "rough" traditions teetered on
the brink at Ex Committee's initial
meeting last night—the six-year-old
mud-fight between freshmen and
sophomores.
While no official action was taken,
the annual event was seriously un
der fire as first one, then another of
the committee's members came out
against it. Fred Williams and Ruth
Goodan took the only definite stands
in its favor.
Decide Next Week
President Jim Reynolds called for
no vote, however, but appointed
Chick Franich and Roy Thompson a
special committee to consider the
"scramble" before next Tuesday's
meeting. Prominent freshman and
sophomores and the Administration
will be contacted before Ex Com
mittee decides finally on the mud
fight's fate.
Student body interest in it isn't
much," said Franich. "It's just an
obscene display, anyway."
"Oh, the Roble girls probably like
it," said Reynolds.
"Weaklings Mashed"
Chuck Fontius, student manager,
explained the stand of Dr. Thomas
Storey, health service head. "All the
athletes are forbidden to enter the
fight, then wc leave the weaklings to
go out there and mash themselves
up."
Administration opposition to the
affair seems to be based on the in
juries received by participants.
Meanwhile, other student-body
business included:
UNIT REQUIREMENT for sala
ried student-body officers — Fontius
unfolded the story of certain man
agers of A.S.S.U. activities who had
attended Stanford as graduate stu
dents, flunked their courses, and
drew their pay checks anyway. His
complaint was that these officials
were on the A.S.S.U. payroll even
though they took no interest in their
studies, that their jobs should be
given to students who are really here
for an education.
The motion that all salaried offi
cers should pass 10 units per quarter
to draw A.S.S.U. paychecks was fa
forably received but tabled for fur
ther consideration.
PROFIT LIMIT on Chaparral edi
tor and manager—Franich suggested
limiting the profit split now allowed
humor mag officials along the line
fhat Daily and Quad headmen are
limited. Decision: Publications
Council will mull over the matter
before Ex Committee acts.
PERMANENT AWARDS, small
axe-and-gavel for watch chain "not
to cost more than $17.50," were
voted all retiring A.S.S.U. presidents.
Ex Committee last spring unofficially
bought Wally Brooke such a "sou
venir" but it still lies in the student
body safe undelivered.
"There was no money to pay for
it," someone explained.
When plans were made to make
each year's award identical, Jim
Reynolds smiled. "I \tfould rather
have a red 'S' on mine," he said.
JOHN DERN was appointed stu
dent member of the Student Aid
Committee by unanimous vote.
QUAD DISTRIBUTION to high
schools was discontinued for the
current issue only. Reason: only 12
yearbooks instead of the usual 50
were available. Quads are usually
sent out to leading Coast high
schools to advertise Stanford.
"Are you sure it's such good pub
licity to send them out anyway?"
asked Roy Thompson innocently.
SPRING ELECTIONS, suggested
Reynolds, should be moved ahead
from the third to the first Tuesday in
May to prevent end-quarter confu
ison, to give officers-elect a chance
to learn "what it's all about." To be
considered later.
CURRENT EVENTS COURSE and
next week's election were made offi
cial by Committee vote.
DEFUNCT ORGANIZATIONS will
be dropped from the A.S.S.U.'s
books, declared Fontius. Clubs not
active for the past three or four
years include the Cardinal Chess
Club, Chi Nu Kappa, Delta Epsilon,
Foil and Mask, and DeMolay.
GRADUATES in Los Angeles, and
perhaps in San Francisco, will have a
chance to join prominent athletic
clubs at greatly reduced rates if
plans Reynolds is working on go
through.
Reynolds warned Ex Committee
members before the meeting's busi
ness began that "if you have some
thing to say, say it—or else nothing
at all."
"Stifling free speech," barked
Franich. .
