# Wife of Professor Marooned In Spain by Fascist Rebellion
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
'"The frontier is closed."
II you were in France and your
wife in Spain, such a statement,
would hardly be soothing, but these
were the words that greeted Max H.
Savelle. director of History of West
ern Civilization, when he arrived at
!he Spanish border last July.
Mr. and Mrs. Savclle left for Eu
rope in June. Mr. Savelle went to J
Paris to study and Mrs. Savelle, who
is Spanish, went to Lugo, northwest |
of Madrid* to visit relatives.
Rebellion Starts
When the rebellion broke out i
against the Madrid government, Mr.
Savelle was in London. He was not
particularly alarmed, but decided to
â€¢_;o to Spain, get Mrs. Savclle, and |
then go on to Valladolid and study.
He started for'Coruna, in the north
west corner of Spain, on Saturday,
July 25.
Learning tlvit it was impossible to
land at Coruna, he planned to go
south to Vigo, but found that port I
also closed. He decided to disem

bark at Cherbourg and enter Spain |
ly land.
"Frontier Is Closed"
It was when Savelle arrived at the
Franco-Spanish border that he
heard: "The fiontier is closed." For
three weeks, while he repeatedly
wired Washington, Madrid, and Lis
bon, he was completely out of touch
with Mrs. Savelle.
As a last resort, he planned to
enter Spain through Portugal.
Though the Portuguese consul in
Paris informed him that transporta
tion from Portugal into Spain was
very poor, Savelle immediately took
ship for Lisbon.
In mid-ocean the captain received
orders from the British Admiralty to
put in at Vigo to take off refugees,
so Mr. Savelle landed at the very
port which for three fruitless and
exasperating weeks he had been try
ing to reach.
Finds Wife
Mrs. Savelle had meanwhile been
reached by phone from Lisbon and
was waiting in Vigo when Mr. Sa- I

velle arrived. From there they went
to Lisbon, took the next boat for
England, and le. r t soon after for
home.
Mrs. Savelle had been in country
which was fortunately taken by the
rebels almost at once, so that there
was very little fighting after the
first few days. However, her broth
er-in-law, a liberal, was suspected of
firing on Fascists from his windows,
and in retaliation his house was
bombarded. Owing to the traditional
bad marksmanship of the Spanish,
little damage was done, although the
occupants were forced to barricade
windows and doors with mattresses
and lie on the floor to escape stray
bullets.
Wins Release
Mrs. Savelle's brother-in-law was
arrested, but influential friends in
the Fascist command secured his re
lease. He is still at liberty, although
under constant suspicion.
Commenting on the Spanish situa
tion Suvelle stated. "The struggle is
of great international significance,
because almost all of the nations of ,
Europe are aligned on one side or
the other. A government victory will
undoubtedly mean a socialist dicta
torship, a rebel victory a Fascist
state.
"France favors a government vie- j
tory, but does not dare to do so
openly, for fear of precipitating a '
general European war. It would cer
tainly jeopardize the forthcoming
Conference of Locarno Powers for
the strengthening of the bases of i
European peace.
Italy Favors Rebels
"Italy would like very much to see
the rebels win, because she feels that
a Fascist Spain would be sympa
thetic to her dream of controlling the j
Mediterranean. It is common gossip j
throughout Europe that Rebel Gen
eral Franco has promised Mussolini j
a naval base in the Balearic Islands
in return for his aid."
