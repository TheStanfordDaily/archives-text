# Thornhill Denies Asserted Protest of Cougar Game; Team 'Strike' Story False
## Washington State Fracas Forgotten as Indians Prepare for Oregon 
### Phil Klauber 
After all this "Cards accuse" and
"Stanford Team Strikes" excitement
is finished the truth and inside on
the matter finally outs itself, Thorn
hill and the team are vindicated, and
two San Francisco reporters take
considerable of a hook to the chin.
These papers came out Monday
evening with big yarns about "Stan
ford football players yesterday serv
ed notice of a 'strike' and refusal to
play in another game this season if
Bobby Morris of Seattle officiates,"
as a result of questionable officiating

Grid addicts may see for
themselves whether or not.
Stanford deserved more touch
downs in Pullman when pic

Stories Bewildering
The yarns caused considerable
chagrin to the Daily's night staff and
to members of the team and student
body yesterday. Most chagrin of all,
though, went to Tiny Thornhill late
Monday night when a third city
paper asked for verification of the
yarn they read in the first two city
papers.
"Strike story?" said Thornhill.
"What strike, Salinas?"
Citizens, does a football team pre
are to go on strike without telling
its coach?
Next, they say that Dr. Wilbur re
quested A1 Masters to lodge a pro
test with Herb Dana, commissioner
of officials. This Dr. Wilbur denied
Monday night.
Tiny's Ire Concocted
Finally they quote Tiny as bub
bling with enthusiasm: "I'm going to
carry this thing to the limit, and if
Dana asks me about it I'll tell him a
thing or two." Tiny plans no pro
test whatever, will not even file the
customary on the game, but
will co-operate in any investigation
that Dana decides, to hold.
So there it is. Some Stanford play
ers undoubtedly accused Morris,
while in the showers after the game,
of assisting Ed Goddard in calling
the Cougar plays. And the movies
will show some discrepancies in de
cisions. And the reports filter down
that Referee Morris has anything but
a clear record in the Northwest.
But in spite of that, the 14-13 de
cision will not be protested, the Stan
ford team will not strike, an inves
tigation will not be demanded, and
the whole thing will now become of
the past, eclipsed by preparation for
the Oregon game here this week
