MURDERED BY lIIS OWN HAND
Until recently, or perhaps they
still do it yet, the English news
papers have been in the habit of
staying away from scare-heads on
stories concerning death. They put
the phrase, "A Regrettable Ocur
rence" over such stories, and while
from an American point of view the
head lacks news value, the phrases
efficiently labels the story as well as
sparing the feelings of those who
knew the deceased.
American papers are full of ac
counts of suicides and it is possibly
true that the average American has
an unusually morbid mind when he
devours the full circumstances sur
rounding the death as recounted by
the afternoon yellow journals. At
the same time, the space given such
a story on the front page and the
lack of repercussions on the church
news page might by a strained anal
ogy indicate that the American pub
lic is more interested in why a
youngster should kill himself than
in the morality of somebody taking
his own life.

No doubt most people agree with
George Bernard Shaw that youth is
a wonderful thing and it is too bad
that it is wasted on children. They
fail to see why anybody with their
whole life ahead of them should be
fed up with this world at the hard
ened old age of 20. Youth, however,
is the age of being misunderstood.
Youthful cynicism, which my father
calls riding around on a mental gar
bage wagon, no doubt has much to
do with youthful suicide.
No one would assume from rela
tive amounts of publicity that chil
dren who kill themselves outnumber
.older people who do likewise, but
there might be more than one per
son than myself who has a theory
that those who bring themselves up
on the grand emotional scale super
analyze themselves into hopeless
pessimism when the going gets
tough. I make no protest for human
beings living like frogs, who have no
complexes which make life inter
esting and who have not gone on
record as a race of beings addicted
to voluntarily drowning themselves.
But is it possible that higher educa
tion acting on sensitive natures tends
to produce baby Hamlets who pon
der over themselves to a point of
insanity?

There are, after all, only a few
people who work themselves into the
mess that Madame Bovary of the
Flaubert novel did when her whole
scaffold of phony excuses fell down
on her in a heap and her sticking
around to stumble out of the wreck
c'ige was sheer impossibility. But as
for a person who, in the language of
his friends, never did anything
wrong in his life, to decide that this
world was the worst of all possible
worlds—could he have had any more
than a normal amount of worries?
But then such talk as mine is what
made the renowned Pollyanna such a
terrible heel.
