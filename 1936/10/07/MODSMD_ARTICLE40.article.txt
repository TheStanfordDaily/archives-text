# Tiny Opens Practice For Webfoot Tilt
## Calvelli To Fill Fullback Position; Dakan Has Influenza; Clark Back 
### Herb Diamond 
That 2(5-0 victory gained by the
forces from Troy last weekend over
Oregon can by no means be taken
to herald the coming of a "breather"
for the Indians in their tussle with
the Webfeet next Saturday after
noon.
Tiny Thornhill knows this, and
with the Washington State game now
a matter for gridiron historians so
far as ho is concerned, he plans to
send his men through increasingly
stiffer workouts this week in prepa
ration for the Oregonians.
Injuries Hurt Webfeet
In their first tilt of the season,
Couch Prink Callison's charges
downed the University of Portland
14-0, without the services of veterans
Bud Goodin, Joe Huston, and Leif
Jacobsen, all benched by minor in
juries. This week, Callison again
faces the probable loss of Goodin
and Huston, because they both suf
fered leg injuries in the U.S.C.
fracas.
In the fullback spot vacated by
Glenn Hamilton, injured in the
Cougar clash and definitely out of
the lineup for the coming three
weks, Thornhill has kept Tony Cal
velli. It is not at all improbable that
Calvelli, formerly at center, will
start in Hamilton's place against
Oregon, for he can block and puss
with equal accuracy.
Grant Also Out
"Pop"Grant will also be out of the
game, the doctors having definitely
diagnosed his injury as a chipped
shoulder bone. Although he ap
peared on the practice field yester
day afternoon, his arm and shoulder
were in a sling and, according to
reports, he will be on the sidelines
about as long as Hamilton.
Bob Dakan is still in the hospital
with influenza; Jack Clark, however,
made an appearance on the field
yesterday after a painfully bruised
arm sent him to the infirmary the
day before.
