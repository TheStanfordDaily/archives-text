## SAVED FROM THE WASTE BASKET 
### 
Ai the freshman reception up at
Wilbur's after the LJ.S.C. game Sat
urday most of the sweet young
things, including his jubilant sister,
were looking for Jack Grover, the
third string fullback who was the
hero of the afternoon. Jack had gone
to a dance over at Mills.
If conversions become too few and
far between, they may call in Pete
Fay, reserve varsity halfback. Pete
was kicking dropkick about 5 for 6
last week from anywhere 35 yards
out. These are good kicks, and you
remember that in drop-kicking, an
extra man is free to block and de
fend the kicker.
Larry Rouble was a little over en
thused when he said, "This crowd
(Class of '40) will be the first team
to beat U.S.C. Frosh since our team
turned the trick in 1932. Rouble for
gets the day when Bill Paulman and
the Class of '38 completed 12 out of
15 passes to win 27-19.
Anent the protests about Bob Mor
ris, referee at Pullman last Saturn
day, comes this one. "Mike," said a
bystander to one of the Stanford
lineman fresh home from the fray,
"why didn't you guys dust him off
after the game?"
"Aw," said Mike, "it's no use mak
ing a pile of manure smell worse by
stirring it up."
Let's get these many and compli
cated relationships straight. Glenn
Hamilton is a brother of Tom Ham
ilton, Naval Academy coach, and no
relation of Robert A. "Bones." Jer
ry Sparling, '40 halfback, is a cousin
of Ray Sparling, left end at U.S.C.
a few years ago.
Howard Hickingbotham, '40 full
back, is a brother of Joe Hicking
botham, fullback and Rhodes Schol
ar from University of California 7
years ago. Jake Brigham, fullback,
and Dick Brigham, guard, are cous
ins. Don and Frank McMillan,
guards, are brothers. By West, tack
j le, and John West, end, are not re
' lated.
More reports come back from the
j 15 who played at Washington State.
| "It was pretty hot and the altitude
] got us. Every six plays we'd have to
sit down and take a blow." Pullman
! is 3500 feet above sea level.
' There was tell of too much talk in

the huddle during the first quarter
up there. "I'm gonna sock the next
guy that talks," said Jimmy Coffis,
feeling the boys were carrying it too
far. There was no more such
trouble.
Al Wesson, U.S.C. publicity mon
ger, has written up about the "Hate
Troy" club of Northern California.
He advises the club to disband and
call off its purposes, because, he says
with a glance four or five years
back, the one thing the Haters can't
stand is a winning U.S.C. football
team. "Now that we are definitely
on the way back," says Wesson, "the
Haters'll just plain hate this year,
double hate next, and purple neck
double concentrated hate themselves
hoarse and bleery-eyed in 1938."
And in addition, old Braven Dyer,
smooth penned boy of the L. A.
Times, has promised his readers lhat
Stanford will lose at least four games
after the Santa Clara tussle. You
see they haven't forgotten us down
there. —Klauber
