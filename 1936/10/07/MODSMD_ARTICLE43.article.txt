# Feed, Not Fight, Is Problem Of Frosh Gridders
## Coach Shipkey Works Ends in Preparation For Black Foxe Tussle 
### 
Big problem at yesterday's Frosh
grid practice was not to discover
ways and means of stifling the ramp
ant militarism of the Black Foxe
Military eleven next Saturday, but
to provide more nourishment for un
derfed athletes of Shipkey's squad.
Jack Grover, 152 pound fullback,
complained of never leaving the
table with "that full feeling in my
stomach," while Gene Coldiron, beefy
quarterback, bragged about having
tapered down to a scant 188 pound
level. Truly a delicate problem for
Encina's chefs has arisen.
The feedbag controversy having
been temporarily shelved, the boys
went about the routine chores of
hitting the dummy while the more
agile ends scooped in passes thrown
by their coach.
Dissatisfied with the performance
of his ends against the SC freshmen,
Coach Shipkey concentrated on them
in yesterday's scrimmage.
Stanford has evidently chosen a
rough road for Saturday's tilt.
