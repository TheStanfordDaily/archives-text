# Hoop Practice Opens With Flash of Spirit
## 
### 
Starling the 1936-37 season with a
practice session Monday that had
enough chatter and pepper to hold
three or four teams for a season, the
Cardinal basketball squad was a
sight to gladden the heart of cagey
Coach John Bunn on the opening
day of the drive for a second consec
utive conference championship for
the Farm. •
In spite of the fact that but 30 men
have turned out, one of the smallest
squads with which Bunn will have
worked in eight years at Stanford, |
prospects are as bright or brighter j
than they have ever been.
First String Returns
The same team that won the con
ference last year, enhanced by the i
presence of the entire first string of
the frosh team last season — Phil
Zonne, Jack Kessell, Lyman Calkins,
Dick Neeley, and Pete McArthur —
along with Dick Lyon of the '34
frosh, looms as one of the strongest
on the coast, if not the best.
However, Coach Bunn, in talking
to the squad before the first day of
general limbering up, predicted that
the team to win the conference this
season will not lose as many as
three games. He forecast last year
that the winner would lose three
games. Stanford came up the win
ner with four games lost, which
should sound as a warning to those
who choose to disregard "Genial
John's" little lecture of yesterday.
Incomparable Hank Luisetti,

whirling dervish of the Coast hard
wood, and his mates, Jack Calder- i
wood, ail-conference guard last
year; Captain Dinty Moore, Art '
Stoefen, H. B. Lee, the Zonne boys,
and others went through the first of
a few days of getting used to the ball j
yesterday, after which fundamentals j
j will start.
Warmup Practice
Practice will be held Mondays at
3 and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4
o'clock until about the middle of No
vember, when daily workouts begin.
! First games are set for December 4
j and 5, with the names of the op-
I ponents not yet ready for release.;
i December 18, immediately following
j finals, a traveling team chosen from
the squad of 30 will leave on a tour
of the East and Middle Western
states for games with Kansas, Ne
braska, and others.

three games. He forecast last year
that the winner would lose three
games. Stanford came up the win
ner with four games lost, which
should sound as a warning to those
who choose to disregard "Genial
John's" little lecture of yesterday.
Incomparable Hank Luisetti,

whirling dervish of the Coast hard
wood, and his mates, Jack Calder- i
wood, ail-conference guard last
year; Captain Dinty Moore, Art '
Stoefen, H. B. Lee, the Zonne boys,
and others went through the first of
a few days of getting used to the ball j
yesterday, after which fundamentals j
j will start.
Warmup Practice
Practice will be held Mondays at
3 and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4
o'clock until about the middle of No
vember, when daily workouts begin.
! First games are set for December 4
j and 5, with the names of the op-
I ponents not yet ready for release.;
i December 18, immediately following
j finals, a traveling team chosen from
the squad of 30 will leave on a tour
of the East and Middle Western
states for games with Kansas, Ne
braska, and others.
Starling the 1936-37 season with a
practice session Monday that had
enough chatter and pepper to hold
three or four teams for a season, the
Cardinal basketball squad was a
sight to gladden the heart of cagey
Coach John Bunn on the opening
day of the drive for a second consec
utive conference championship for
the Farm. •
In spite of the fact that but 30 men
have turned out, one of the smallest
squads with which Bunn will have
worked in eight years at Stanford, |
prospects are as bright or brighter j
than they have ever been.
First String Returns
The same team that won the con
ference last year, enhanced by the i
presence of the entire first string of
the frosh team last season — Phil
Zonne, Jack Kessell, Lyman Calkins,
Dick Neeley, and Pete McArthur —
along with Dick Lyon of the '34
frosh, looms as one of the strongest
on the coast, if not the best.
However, Coach Bunn, in talking
to the squad before the first day of
general limbering up, predicted that
the team to win the conference this
season will not lose as many as
three games. He forecast last year
that the winner would lose three
games. Stanford came up the win
ner with four games lost, which
should sound as a warning to those
who choose to disregard "Genial
