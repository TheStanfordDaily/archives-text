# Dixon To Bolster Cross-Country
## 
### 
News that Warren Dixon, ace
miler from Dink Templeton's cinder
squad, will compete in cross-country
this fall has considerably heightened
the Cardinal strength.
Dixon has completed his track
competition, but is eligible for an
other year at cross-country, which is
a separate and distinct sport. Cross
country practice will start at the
golf course Monday afternoon.
