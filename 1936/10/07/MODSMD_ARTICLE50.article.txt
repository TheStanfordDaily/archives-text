# London Bridges Falling Down

### 
One who was here in 1932 went to a Union
jolly-up Saturday night. The next day he was
in to The Daily with his campus opinion which
we printed yesterday, blaming the degeneration
of Stanford democracy on the increase in num
bers of women at the University.
To me, this is a linking of two facts which
were simultaneously only through coincidence.
It is true that there has been a flood of new
women; and women, with all their little virtues,
do not in themselves make a University great.
I am inclined to hold with those that the best
thing about having women at a University is
that this makes it easier for the men. However,
let us not forget that the decline of the Rough,
is more or less a symbol of Stanford's and the
West's coming of age. Let's not blame the
women for too much, or they might not like it.
We are apt lo forget that what we are getting
at Stanford now is a post-war generation, edu
cated entirely in post-war schools. It also is
coming from a predominantly urban society.
Evolution away from the drab to the peacock in
men's dress is part of nation-wide trend in col
leges, of which Esquire may either be cause or
effect. The trend at Stanford is due also to the
fact that the rigours of the depression have sent
the student of many middle class families to
junior colleges and state universities, and re
stricted enrollment at Stanford to sons of upper
middle class, of more prosperous professional
and business men.
The fine old cornerstones of morality which
sounded so fine a few years ago, seem to be
disappearing as a complement to awful rapidity
of social change. This is supplemented by the
fact that the more prosperous strata of society
never seemed to have dipped themselves very
deep in the Calvinist discipline.
Along with a very materialistic attitude to
wards philosophy, learning, cind molality, the
one who was here in 1932 sees a distinct trend
away from the democratic.
I question that.
I have heard many stories about the "500."
Unquestionably they came from a different
mold. I particularly remember the titans who
stalked the stage when I was a freshman:
Jeanne Millard, Jane Hillebrand, Babe Dear,
Barbara Binns, and others. The Jeanne D'Arcs of
Cap and Gown, leaders of Stanford's "suffra
gette" period. You don't see that type around
any more. There is an acquiescence, a submis
sion to the environment, and I don't think it is
because the environment is so radically
changed.
I have heard, also, that the old "500" was
snobbish, and I think it was. I think the 500
women were pretty smug, even in some of their
suffragette periods. The simple economic in
terpretation of the increase of new women
would tend to mean that with the ratio of men
to women decreased, the women can not afford
to be so choosy. In fact, women seem to have
beer, relegated more to their proper sphere
of subtle, sophisticated luring of men.
"Ruthie" at the telephone desk at Roble says
they have become more sophisticated. Of
course they have, they've been brought up on
Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, and don't forget, by
all means, the leveling influence of Hollywood.
The sole function of a woman at college is to
acquire a few social graces, learn how to keep
a conversation going without having to think,
to learn to be able to look unconcerned when
the maid drops a tray, and to get a husband.
Some women are choosy because they have
many to pick from. But those who have many
to pick from seldom are snobbish or undemo
cratic, because snobbishness springs from an
inferiority complex, a realization that there is no
other way lo maintain one's position. You may
notice this in a group scale among sororities.
To say that Stanford is less democratic than
in the old days seems to be an unwarranted
playing with the facts. I have heard many
stories of the old Stanford. Of the intense ri
valry and hate between Row and Hall. Of the
extreme arrogance of the upper caste of rich
men called "barbarians" anymore at Stanford,
me ncalled "barbarians" anymore at Stanford.
Democracy springs from economic equality. I
think there is less actual disparity in family in
come at Stanford now, although the aggregate
incomes may be higher.
Unquestionably, the Stanford student has
changed. To say that he has become more
studious, less righteous, less sure of moral
codes, more tolerant, is correct. To say that

the women have become more like women and
less like martinets, is true. But to say that
Stanford has become less democratic seems to
me to be confusing exterior manifestations of an
age-old problem with a horse of a different color.
