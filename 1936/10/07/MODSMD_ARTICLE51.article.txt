He was not well known at Stanford. There
will be too few students who will remember
James Fisher, a German major, a Phi Beta Kappa,
and a boy who couldn't decide what his posi
tion in modern society should be.
He came to Stanford on a scholarship to be
come a doctor, but he didn't want to be a doctor.
A vocational guidance examination proved that
he wanted to be a chemist, but he didn't want to
be a chemist.
Caught in the web of graduation requirements,
it was ruled he should be a German major, but
he didn't want to teach German. But he gradu
ated last June with Phi Beta Kappa honors, and
an A.B. in German.
Monday his body was recovered from an
ocean cove, shot through the head. What was it
that this boy needed that Stanford couldn't give
him?
