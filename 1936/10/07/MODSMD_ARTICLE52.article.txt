SWING, MR. VOTER
Mitchell Saadi, high priest of the local Demos Lodge,
requests us to announce that Stanford's Young Demo
crats will throw a dance at Palo Alto Community Cen
ter Friday night, music by Gordie Heche, refreshments
by the slush fund.
He considers the affair ostensibly significant because
his fledgling organization is slinging it. Others think
it significant because it's being slung in the faces of
those most exquisitely intense Republicans—the Palo
Alto citizenry.
But it is really important for quite another reason,
one that neither the Democrats nor the Grut Or Pab
lum dispensers have thought of: it is a political dance.
* * * *
And as such it epitomizes a campaign technique that
will not only sweep Mitchell's party to victory in No
vember but, if as effectively used by the virginal in
tellects of the Republicans, could even make Landon
seem an effective human being.
Cleverly enough, the Democrats aren't trying to win
the election. They're simply giving a good perform
ance.
As long as they're not selling tickets, they hint, the
least you can do is give them that absolutely free vote
of yours.
First off, the Democrats have an all-star cast. Mas
ter of Ceremonies is that golden-voiced idol of the
air-lanes, Franklin. When he charms you from a White
House microphone, radio artists are frequently at his
side to study his technique.
* * * * t
They say there is nothing like him in the business;
and if he is defeated, he can land a job anywhere sell
ing cigarettes instead of America.
Franklin gives the continuity. His speeches are a
compound of two-syllable words for the ignorami and
neat, apparently well-squared ideas for intellecti.
London, he couldn't sell a bucket of water to a Kansas
drought victim.
Then we have the comic, Farley: that jocund, high
blood pressured, flush-faced and lovable ass of the
world. He wears a derby, comedy's accessory since
Weber and Fields. Contrast that with the Brooks
Brothers' sack-suits of Lochinvar Hamilton. We ask
you.
Doing a sort of Willie Howard single is Johnny (the
ant-eater) Garner. An old cow-hand from the Rio
Grande, he hasn't stepped in it yet. Why doesn't Knox
go back to Chicago?
* Us * *
Not only are the* Republicans handicapped by a
lousy case, they're not even trying to give a show.
Landon's performance so far is a stinkaroo. Knox has
been bellowing like a fourth-string lago for his eco
nomic Desdemona. Hamilton has been trying to play
a straight part, difficult for a campaign manager.
And both shows are on America's Broadway, the
radio. Problem: who gets the fan mail.

Then we have the comic, Farley: that jocund, high
blood pressured, flush-faced and lovable ass of the
world. He wears a derby, comedy's accessory since
Weber and Fields. Contrast that with the Brooks
Brothers' sack-suits of Lochinvar Hamilton. We ask
you.
Doing a sort of Willie Howard single is Johnny (the
ant-eater) Garner. An old cow-hand from the Rio

Not only are the* Republicans handicapped by a
lousy case, they're not even trying to give a show.
Landon's performance so far is a stinkaroo. Knox has
been bellowing like a fourth-string lago for his eco

a straight part, difficult for a campaign manager.
And both shows are on America's Broadway, the
radio. Problem: who gets the fan mail.

Mitchell Saadi, high priest of the local Demos Lodge,
requests us to announce that Stanford's Young Demo
crats will throw a dance at Palo Alto Community Cen
ter Friday night, music by Gordie Heche, refreshments
by the slush fund.
He considers the affair ostensibly significant because
his fledgling organization is slinging it. Others think
it significant because it's being slung in the faces of
those most exquisitely intense Republicans—the Palo
Alto citizenry.
But it is really important for quite another reason,
one that neither the Democrats nor the Grut Or Pab
lum dispensers have thought of: it is a political dance.
* * * *
And as such it epitomizes a campaign technique that
will not only sweep Mitchell's party to victory in No
vember but, if as effectively used by the virginal in
tellects of the Republicans, could even make Landon
seem an effective human being.
Cleverly enough, the Democrats aren't trying to win
the election. They're simply giving a good perform
ance.
As long as they're not selling tickets, they hint, the
least you can do is give them that absolutely free vote
of yours.
First off, the Democrats have an all-star cast. Mas
ter of Ceremonies is that golden-voiced idol of the
air-lanes, Franklin. When he charms you from a White
House microphone, radio artists are frequently at his
side to study his technique.
