# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
My Encina H-man reports from his position high
in the air shaft that two kinds of heat have now been
turned on in Encina. First came the steam, and then
came the sponsors. And then came the heat. It seems
that the sponsors had their first sponsor meeting Mon
day night. The boys have not decided yet whether the
Commons bun-throw should be overhand or under
hand. But with two kinds of heat, the bun, at least,
will be toasted.
The hasher, being an independent and hardy soul,
can look at women's rushing with a cynical, even if
hungry, stare. He laughs quite loudly at women's
rushing restrictions and even laughs a little at men's
rushing restrictions, as do many fraternities. (Our
Hasher received a phone call late Monday night from
some excited individual who said that there was an
illegal rushing party going on. Since the gentleman
would give no further details, Our Hasher's only course
was to phone O'Brien's, who replied emphatically in
the negative. This shows, of course, that the gentleman
who phoned must have been lying.)
To continue: The hashers can laugh particularly at
the abolishment of the Women's Conference Party
this year because it was just a wholesale rushing
party, though nobody could understand why it should
be anything else. The result of all this sanctimonious
attitude toward the Roble sanctum is that the sorority
gals have to find new means to get a line on the frosh
class, which is a necessity for the sororities, though, it
is said, the fraternities only need to get their hooks
on them.
Those who went to the Matriculation Service Sun
day reported that there were more Row women there
than freshmen.
And now we find that the wily Row Dianas have
concocted a new scheme, which goes to show what the
hashers can do for society. There is a great rivalry
going on new between the various houses to get key
hashers in Roble, who turn in a weekly report. The
report is something like the list Shipkey keeps of
weight his frosh football lugs gain eating at the train
ing table and the weight they lose trying to get to
sleep in Encina. However, the report is somewhat
weighted toward the basic problem: is the Roble gal a
heavy dater, a heavy activity gal. or just heavy?
