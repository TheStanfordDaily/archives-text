# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I suppose I had no right to do this,
and will probably be interpreted as
a typical sorehead, but I couldn't
refrain from commenting on the ar
ticle and side notes concerning the
Salinas strike.
It is rather surprising that the
editor, who is a Salinasite himself
and whose home is amongst those
of the "high society" of Maple Park,
would allow the publication of such
rot. However, the fact remains that
it was published, and undoubtedly
was the source of much amusement
to a great percentage of the readers.
Perhaps I could add a few more
items to Mr. Tracy's contribution. I
could tell of how most of the ship
pers' families were forced to leave
town because of actual threats from
strikers. Of how there was an aver
age of fifty thousands of dollars a
day being lost by the combined
shippers up to the time they built
a "stockade" around their sheds in
order to pack unmolested. Of how
only last Thursday night there were
three bombings on the property of
one of the leading ice companies—
obviously done by radicals. Of the
Monterey County Communist Party
bulletins whose contents make it
difficult to believe that we live in a
civilized country. There are numer
ous other things which could be
named, but that would take more
time than I find available.
As for Mr. Tracy's story—there are
some very good points in it, and
several very poor ones. But that
wasn't what irked me so much. It

was the "Hot Time" article. I would
advise the writer of said article to
take a jaunt to Salinas and look the
situation over before he ridicules
it again to such an extent . I'm sure
that any "newly-rich" lettuce man
who read his column would be over
joyed to meet him and would give
him an exceedingly warm reception!
Editor's note:
Ordinarily all letters to this col
umn must be signed, but because it
is typical of an expected reaction,
this letter is running today.
Students who wish to retain their
anonymity in Campus Opinion may

was the "Hot Time" article. I would
advise the writer of said article to
take a jaunt to Salinas and look the
situation over before he ridicules
it again to such an extent . I'm sure
that any "newly-rich" lettuce man
who read his column would be over
joyed to meet him and would give
him an exceedingly warm reception!

The Editor, Sir:
I suppose I had no right to do this,
and will probably be interpreted as
a typical sorehead, but I couldn't
refrain from commenting on the ar
ticle and side notes concerning the
Salinas strike.
It is rather surprising that the
editor, who is a Salinasite himself
and whose home is amongst those
of the "high society" of Maple Park,
would allow the publication of such
rot. However, the fact remains that
it was published, and undoubtedly
was the source of much amusement
to a great percentage of the readers.
Perhaps I could add a few more
items to Mr. Tracy's contribution. I
could tell of how most of the ship
pers' families were forced to leave
town because of actual threats from
strikers. Of how there was an aver
age of fifty thousands of dollars a
day being lost by the combined
shippers up to the time they built
a "stockade" around their sheds in
order to pack unmolested. Of how
only last Thursday night there were
three bombings on the property of
one of the leading ice companies—
obviously done by radicals. Of the
Monterey County Communist Party
bulletins whose contents make it
difficult to believe that we live in a
civilized country. There are numer
ous other things which could be
named, but that would take more
time than I find available.
