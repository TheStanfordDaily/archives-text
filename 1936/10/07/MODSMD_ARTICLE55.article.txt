# WHO'S EXASPERATED NOW?

The Editor, Sir:
The most exasperating of nuisances
is the person who whines about the
$8 syllabus fee for elementary
courses in French, Spanish, and Ger
man. Though university authorities
state that such courses should be
taken in high school, the $8-wailer
retorts he cannot study all three
languages before coming to college.
Certainly the wailer is woefully
mistaken when he declares that the
$8 fee is exorbitant. He has failed,
no doubt, to investigate that the tui
tion here is appreciably lower than
that at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
other universities on a par with
Stanford. Worst of all, he has for
gotten the myriad other advantages
that Stanford offers.
