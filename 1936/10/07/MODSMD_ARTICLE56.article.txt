"MELT INIY SISTER," at the Al
cazar, is an amusing musical com
edy built around the old princess
pauper" theme. Only this time it is
a countess who is in love with her
librarian, a shy professor of psy
chology. The professor, awed by the
countess' rank, evades her advances,
and it is only through a ruse that she
gets him to marry her. She dis
guises herself as her "sister," who
has given up her title and works in
a shoe store.
Walter Slezak, Austrian musical
star, plays the role he created abroad,
Eric, the librarian. He possesses
a certain charm, which shows up
especially when he sings the song,
"My Ideal" first in English, then
French and German, somewhat in
the Maurice Chevalier manner. The

rest of the music is indifferent, and
even "My Ideal" is not as romantic
as might be due to the girth of the
hero.
Nancy McCord, late star of the
New York production of "May Wine,"
makes a lovely countess. Her voice
is excellent and her handsome face
and figure are really worthy of a
less mediocre production than "Meet
My Sister."
L ois January as Henriette, the
maid ,shows a lovely pair of legs
and was altogether pleasing in her
bit part. Claud Allister, perpetual
British lord of the movies, plays
a French counterpart as the Mar
quise de Chatelard and gives a good
performance as the countess jilted
fiance.
