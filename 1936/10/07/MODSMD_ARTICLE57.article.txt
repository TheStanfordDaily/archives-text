# Hill Gives Bureau Speech
## 
### 
Stanford Speakers Bureau pre
sented its first speaker of the term
yesterday when James Hill, debate
manager, spoke on "Doctors, Dol
lars, and Diseases" to the San Fran
cisco Business League.
Because the Bureau has more en
gagements than speakers, Manager
Chuck Schafer asked that new try
outees attend a meeting to be held at
2:30 Friday in the Ex Committee
Room. All speeches must be ap
proved before October 20 by a re
view board.
Campus leaders have given the
bureau unanimous praise. Their
statements follow:
JAN NORTH, member Rally Com
mittee: "I advise all the women who
are interested in an activity that

offers new contacts, experiences, and
unusual opportunities for dramatic
expression to take full advantage of
this valuable training."
JIM REYNOLDS, student body
president: "Not only do the speak
ers gain valuable expeiience for
themselves, but they also obtain fa
vorable publicity for our Univer
sity."
WINSTEAD WEAVER, philosoph
ical genius and Mad Monk of the
Farm: "Oratory is an art which of
fers the speaker a means of tran
scending his usually limited objec
tive world, and gives him the op
portunity of communicating pungent
ideas to a receptive audience."
