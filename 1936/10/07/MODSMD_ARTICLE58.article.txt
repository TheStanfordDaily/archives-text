### Clipped by Phil Bernheim 
ALL THE ATROCITIES, the hor
rid blatancies, of the jazz vogue may
be forgiven for such tunes as "Soli
tude," "Getting Sentimental," and
"April in Paris."
SOB STORY (from this column of
November 22, 1935): Three or four
years ago, Smith Ballew led one of
the country's best dance orchestras.
It was not one of the most famous,
but "Smith Ballew and his Piping
Rock Orchestra" were a nightly fea
ture on the Columbia Broadcasting
System, and their Columbia record
ing of "Time on My Hands" still
stands as the smoothest of that piece
ever made.
Today, Smith Ballew and a vastly
inferior band play unobtrusively in
L.A.'s Cafe de Paris, just another
junk band. You'd pass it by on your
radio dial. Where once were smooth
arrangements and syncopated beauty
there are now only sour notes and
ragged playing. Nostalgia grips us.
SEQUEL: Now look at the boy
Smith Ballew, minus band but defi
nitely with personality and voice,
stars weekly on the Saturday night
Chateau programs via NBC. Who
said they never come back?
FOR JADED RADIO LISTEN
ERS: If Pacific Coast programs and
dance bands bore you, try picking
up some of the Eastern shows in the
evening. Easy to hear are WLW,
700 kc. (NBC, Mutual: WGN, 720 kc.
(Mutual); WBBM, 770 kc. (CBS);

WCCO. 810 kc. (CBS); WTAM. 1070
kc. (NBC); and WBT, 1080 kc. Also
good for occasional broadcasts not
reaching the Coast are KOA, Den
ver, 830 kc. (NBC) and KSL, Salt
Lake City, 1130 kc. (CBS). Recep
tion on all but the last two stations
is erratic, some nights being swell,
others terrible. If at first you don't
succeed . . .
AROUND THE DIAL: Tenor Nino
Martini sings songs from his new
picture, "Gay Desperado," with
Andre Kostelanetz' orchestra over
KFRC at 6. Fred Allen returns to
KPO at 9.

rid blatancies, of the jazz vogue may
be forgiven for such tunes as "Soli
tude," "Getting Sentimental," and
"April in Paris."
SOB STORY (from this column of
November 22, 1935): Three or four
years ago, Smith Ballew led one of
the country's best dance orchestras.
It was not one of the most famous,
but "Smith Ballew and his Piping
Rock Orchestra" were a nightly fea
ture on the Columbia Broadcasting
System, and their Columbia record
ing of "Time on My Hands" still
stands as the smoothest of that piece
ever made.
Today, Smith Ballew and a vastly
inferior band play unobtrusively in
L.A.'s Cafe de Paris, just another
junk band. You'd pass it by on your
radio dial. Where once were smooth
arrangements and syncopated beauty
there are now only sour notes and
ragged playing. Nostalgia grips us.
SEQUEL: Now look at the boy
Smith Ballew, minus band but defi
nitely with personality and voice,
stars weekly on the Saturday night
Chateau programs via NBC. Who
said they never come back?
FOR JADED RADIO LISTEN
ERS: If Pacific Coast programs and
dance bands bore you, try picking
up some of the Eastern shows in the
evening. Easy to hear are WLW,
700 kc. (NBC, Mutual: WGN, 720 kc.
(Mutual); WBBM, 770 kc. (CBS);

WCCO. 810 kc. (CBS); WTAM. 1070
kc. (NBC); and WBT, 1080 kc. Also
good for occasional broadcasts not
reaching the Coast are KOA, Den
ver, 830 kc. (NBC) and KSL, Salt
Lake City, 1130 kc. (CBS). Recep
tion on all but the last two stations
is erratic, some nights being swell,
others terrible. If at first you don't
succeed . . .
AROUND THE DIAL: Tenor Nino
Martini sings songs from his new
picture, "Gay Desperado," with
Andre Kostelanetz' orchestra over
KFRC at 6. Fred Allen returns to
KPO at 9.
