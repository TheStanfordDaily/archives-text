# Mud-fight Plans Await Sanction
## 
### 
With Ex-committce's sanction still
pending, plans were being made for
the annual frosh-soph mud-fight.
At Ex-committee meeting Tues
day night objections were raised to
this Stanford tradition. No official
action was taken at that meeting,
other than the appointing of Chick
Franich and Roy Thompson to in
vestigate the matter. Official de
cision on whether it can be held or
not will be made at next Tuesday's
Ex-committee meeting.
Jack Cowen has been selected to
lead the "thirty-niners" in the fracas.
If the sophs win, it will be the first
time that any class has won the
slush battle in both frosh and soph
years. Last year, lead by Phil Zonne,
they were victorious by a close
margin.
This year's frosh will follow Joe
Mulligan and Dick Waldron.
Last year Dr. Thomas A. Storey
gave several severe blastings to the
practice when several of the war
riors developed severe colds as a
result of their duckings.
The gist of Dr. Storey's attack was
that he did not think it advisable
from the health standpoint, but if
the participants wanted to have the
fight he was not opposed to it.
