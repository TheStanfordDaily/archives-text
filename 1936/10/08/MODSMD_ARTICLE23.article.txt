# Large Crowd Sees Card-W.S.C. Film
## 
### 
Flashing across the Assembly Hall
screen before a crowd of more than
900 enthusiasts, the pictures of the
Washington State-Stanford game
were received with appropriately
timed cheers and boos, by a Farm
audience last night.
The pictures will continue to be
shown, according to Student Body
Proxy Jim Reynolds. "This re
sponse," he said, "proves that the
students want to see game pictures.
At least one more game and perhaps
all the games will be exhibited."
