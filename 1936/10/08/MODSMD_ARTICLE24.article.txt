# Yearlings' Political Views Show Papa's Influence
## 
### 
Because of his personality, be
| cause he says, "My friends," 80 per
| cent of Encinamen think President
! Roosevelt is just a garden variety
i slug, according to a survey of frosh
opinion.
Stanford's yearlings try hard to
conceal the fact that their views are
j also papa's. Out of every seven
pollees six admitted paternal origin
!of their ideas, the seventh was a
, Democrat. But all have whipped up
| a considerable hatred of genial
F.D.R. for reasons they declare are
their own, but which are also
Knox's.
"I am not a Democrat because my
family and I are getting nothing out
of it," one declared. Another said, "I
am against the present administra
tion for four reasons, and they're all
the same, that dirty twinkle in Hoo-
I sevelt's eye."

The frosh who were Democratic
in sentiment disliked the Republic
ans because Hoover typified them.
They believe that the candidacy of
"Landon and Knox is just funny,
nothing to get excited about." Most
of them are Democrats admittedly
because of Roosevelt's personal
charm, and the fact that he is not a
Republican rather than any supe
riority of his administration.
Thirty per cent of the Republican
frosh agreed that G.O.P. catch
phrases swung them to Landonâ€”
such as "Two Chickens in Every
Pot" and "Prosperity Is Just Around
the Corner." Many of them believe
that such slogans are as good today
as when Hoover was in office.
A Democrat declared "I'm hot for
the Democrats because I think it's a
good idea for my grandchildren to
pay my debts. I don't know why we
didn't think of that before."
