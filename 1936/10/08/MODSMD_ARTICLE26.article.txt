# Cardinals Announce Dance For Night of U.S.C. Game
## Plans Made for Bonfire, Welcome Committee 
### 
One of the largest and most novel
dances of the season will be pre
sented the evening of the U.S.C.
game, October 24. Sponsoring this
affair are the Cardinals, who ap
pointed Mark Hopkins as dance
chairman last night at their regular
session. As a heavy post-game at
tendance from the southland is an
ticipated, no effort or expense will be
spared in arranging for the program.
Five hundred empty barrels have
been tentatively promised by a mem
ber of Cardinals to make of the Big
Game bonfire the most successful
blaze in history. Heading the con
flagration committee are Barbara
Murphy and Jeeb Hallaby.
Name Handshakers
Future celebrities who visit the
Farm will be met by an official Card
inal committee of handshakers and
back-slappers. In charge of organ
izing this useful service, otherwise
known as the Visitors' Welcoming
Committee are Tom Killefer, Bob
Mallett, and Ruth Goodan.
In order to provide Stanford so
journers with overnight accommo
dations, Cardinals named Bob Mc-
Roskey to investigate possibilities of
having living groups extend hospi
tality. This service is planned with
an eye to playing more cordial host
to high school students who fre
quently visit the Farm.
Hosts would have an opportunity
to "sell" Stanford to these future
University nuggets.
Assemblies Revived
Cardinals plan to revive last year's
abortive high school assembly
scheme of sending Farm luminaries
to surrounding secondary schools to
amuse students with a presentation
of Stanford in all its phases.
T. M. McDaniel, Betty Grover, and
Kay Moran were appointed to sound
out the situation by addressing let
ters to neighboring high schools.
