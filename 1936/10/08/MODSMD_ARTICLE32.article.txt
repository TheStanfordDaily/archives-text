ALAMEDA, Calif., Oct. 7 (A>)â€”
The China Clipper, carrying five
newspapermen, hopped off at 3:25
p.m. today for Honolulu on a pre
liminary passenger-observation flight
before inauguration of passenger
service to Manila on October 21.
The 20-ton craft roared down the
bay and took oft after a 50 second
run, heading out the Golden Gate to
Honolulu, 2,400 miles away, with
the first passengers outside of Pan
American company personnel to
make the long journey.
