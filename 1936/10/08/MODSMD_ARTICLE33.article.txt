# Men Needed For German Play Cast
## 
### 
Tryouts, held yesterday afternoon
for the annual autumn dramatic
production of the German depart
ment, have not yet produced a com
plete cast, announced Director Kurt
F. Reinhardt at a late hour last night.
Choice of a play has not yet been
determined because of a lack of male
characters, any of whom are strong
ly urged to report to Dr. Reinhardt
immediately. The probable selection
will be "Leonce and Lena," a com
edy in the Shakespearean manner.
