# New Men Will Fill Holes In Varsity Nine
## Wolter Gives Prospects As Cards Hold First Workout of Season 
### ART ALLEN 
Surveying his material at the first
varsity baseball workout of the year,
Coach Harry Wolter hesitated a bit,
then took inventory and tentatively
placed his men.
Bill Newsom, last year's star third
baseman, has transferred to Creigh
ton Medical School in the mid-west.
Wolter plans to move George Farrell
over to that position from the short
patch, and play Leonard Lindy, San
Mateo J.C. transfer, at Farrell's old
spot.
Second base will be a wide open
battle with Dick Tam, University of
Hawaii transfer, and Dale Reimer of
the 1935-36 squad on top at present.
Hard hitting Verne Johnson and
Captain "Red" Holman will alternate
between first base and right field.
Tony Calvelli, erstwhile gridder
from San Mateo J.C., will be out for
one of the other outfield posts. "Post
holes" Matthews, also a gridder at
present, and Dick Hanna, back from
Berlin, will be given a chance to
show their wares behind the plate,
along with veterans Leo Heagerty
and Mike Ferro, although either of
the former two may be used in the
outfield.
Joie Griffin from Santa Monica
J.C. is slated to bolster the pitching
staff of Ray Weiershauser, Tom Kil
lefer, Fullback Glenn Hamilton, and
"Howie" Paine. Paine, who started
late after the basketball season last
year, will devote the entire season to
baseball this time, and should be
much improved.
