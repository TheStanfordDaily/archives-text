# Hare Victor By Hair as Panting Pooches Pursue
## 
### 
Crowds of chem students placed
heavy bets on a big Stanford derby
that took place yesterday morning
when a badly harassed jackrabbit
and two yapping police dogs raced
madly across the front lawn of the
Chemistry Building.
In the first quarter the dogs gained,
but the bunny widened the distance
by scooting under parked cars. Ten
sion was high as drooling tongues al
most touched the rabbit's tail. Then,
with a miraculous series of twistings,
the jack streaked across the parking
field a full length ahead.
As the race continued through a
fence the outcome is unknown, but
when last seen, the bunny was ahead
with the villains still pursuing.
