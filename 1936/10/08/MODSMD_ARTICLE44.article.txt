# Frosh Handbooks Come Out Today
## 
### 
A tasty confection of red on white,
just two and seven-eighths by four
and eleven-sixteenths inches, the
1536-37 edition of Stanford's hand
book, will be presented freshmen
either today or Friday, according to
Frank Fullenwider, editor.
Departing from the old established
rule, this year's frosh bible contains
a readable abridgement of the by
laws rather than these articles in
full. Fullenwider especially calls
the reader's attention to a new sec
tion on student employment which
he is confident will prove interesting
and helpful.
Handbooks will be distributed to
Fioble and Encina sponsors who may
pass them on to their class of '40
wards in the manner most con
venient to them.
