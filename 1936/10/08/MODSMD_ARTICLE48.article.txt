# Papoose Team Reaches Peak For Next Tilt
## Coach Juggles Material; Appoints New Backs For Passing, Kicking 
### 
Scrimmage was the order of the
day as the first year footballers
reached the peak of their prepara
tion for the tussle with Black Foxe
Military academy Saturday.
Coach Harry Shipkey continued to
juggle with his well-stocked supply
of backfield material and after com
pleting the act he came out of his
wizardry with a new fullback. Rod
Parker has been selected to open at
that spot against the soldiers.
Walker At Half
In addition to Parker, there will
be a second new face in the Frosh
ball carrying department. Tom
Walker, who has shown a tendency
to be able to hang on to a pass
once it has fallen into his hands, has
been given the call at right half.
This gives the Papooses a pair of
pass-catching artists, as Chad Reade,
left halfback, has already demon
strated his ability to "gather 'em in."
The remainder of the backfield
is composed of Gene Coldiron, the
quick kicking red head from Ho
quiam, Wash. Coldiron's unexpected
rapid fire boots put the SC yearlings
in several holes last week, and Gene
will have a surprise in store for any
Black Foxe safety man who creeps
up too close.
Suffer Minor Injuries
Today pass defense, signal practice,
and line defense will hold the at
tention of Shipkey's grid class. Ted
Lewis, Bob Young, Stan Anderson
and "Crash" Higgenbotham all suf
fering from" minor hurts and will
take a rest which is calculated to
put them back in trim for Saturday's
tiff.
As regards the amount of avoirdu-
I pois possessed by the rival elevens,
j the figures show that there is vir- (
tually no difference in the weight
of the two teams. Both average
around 188 pounds.
It is questionable whether Chet
Patton, first string full, will be able
to play against Black Foxe as he has
been slowef to recover from a leg
' injury than was at first anticipated.
