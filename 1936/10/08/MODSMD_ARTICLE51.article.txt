# Morris Tales Persist; Farm Stays Silent
## Calvelli Continues Stellar Pace at Full; Webfeet Head for Farm Today 
### 
Continuing to maintain the stand
they took from the very beginning,
spokesmen for Stanford were still si
lent last night on the alleged Bobby
Morris complaint. And that's the way
they will stay, notwithstanding the
varied rumors that still persist dog
gedly.
As if to emphasize the attitude that
last week's Indian-Cougar clash is
now merely a matter for newspaper
archives, Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters has steadily declined to make
any statements, and Tiny Thornhill
is far too busy preparing his men for
the coming Oregon fracas to be
thinking about past events.
Dana To Press Probe
Herb Dana, Coast football com
missioner, first announced that noth
ing much could be done in the mat
ter, even if Morris were proved guil
ty of the rumored charges. He soon
added, however, that he could con
tinue to press matters in the case of
Morris' integrity being questioned.
"Morris has been charged with
'coaching' on the field. I intend to
investigate until his name either is
cleared or the charges are proved."
Thornhill sent his charges through
still another intensive practice ses
sion that lasted far into yesterday
evening. In the scrimmage under the
lights Hands Calvelli continued his
stellar work at fullback. Calvelli
seems to have the much-needed
qualities, speed and passing ability,
that Tiny would like to see in his
whole aggregation.

and his Webfeet have been anything
but idle. They leave today for the
