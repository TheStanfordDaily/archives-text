GRID MOVIES—A
COMING INSTITUTION

Well, the movies from Pullman
were interesting, didn't you think?
In spite of having been a loyal
Stanford supporter for the last 40
years it seems to me that Jake's un
allowed touchdown plunge was six
of one and a half dozen of the other.
It was an off tackle drive to the
right side, and some Cougar hit him
before he got there. At the team
showing Tuesday night they ran it
about four times, with everyone
studying that rear, or left leg of
Jake's. The knee goes low, about a
yard from a score, but doesn't look
as low as the next time it went all
the way down, after the ball was
safely into scoring territory.
Brigham drove forward with his
eight leg to carry himself over,
kinda dragging the rear one. Bobby
Morris was about five yards directly
behind Brigham, but the head lines
man and some photographers had
perfect views of that rear knee.
Other interesting things came out
—Coffis definitely hit the outside line
with his right heel on the touch
down that was called back, while the
clipping penalty on Stone was really
due to Vigna. Joe was carrying the
ball, and as Stone rolled into a Cou
gar, Vigna veered, the Cougar turned
Farm, after having found time for
only three sessions on the practice
turf. Callison has centered all his
efforts on developing the Oregon
ians' attack, and he figures that as
long as his first string stays on the
field Stanford will have plenty to
worry about.
Last week, he points out, the squad
held Howard Jones' powerful men
of Troy scoreless until half time.
Then, when Jones rushed practically
a whole new line-up into the melee,
the Webfeet were overwhelmed.

DANA HAS TAKEN
AN INTEREST

Dana has now written down for
written evidence on Morris's con
duct; he wants to either vindicate
the official or take him out of work
ing the U.S.C. game here two weeks
hence.
Do you think that anybody will
write anything down about Morris
to send in? Or say anything more
about the punk officialling to any
one? Or otherwise have his name
mixed into the thing? Maybe I miss
my guess.
Best of all, the pictures show why
it was passing and not running that
, got Stanford down the field. The
Cougars were playing a 7-man line
! throughout, and had difficulty cov
ering all the Stanford receivers.
Often these would be clear by seven
or eight yards, unusual in these days
of 6-2-2-1.
The line was a tough one to han
dle for boys who are used to setting
! against six men, but on occasions,
I especially the first and third Stan
ford touchdown drives, the running
! play gains were admirable. Did you
see how far away from the team the
wingbacks sat on both flankers and
ordinary plays?

WALTON IS
BACK WITH US!

Everybody remembers Jack "Bird
legs" Walton. He was a guard behind
Larry Rouble in 1934, Masque Ball
King, and his 225 pounds and ever
jovial manner used to entertain
players and fans alike. He also
played some good football between
gr-gs.
Walton dropped out of school last
year, and worked for an oil company
down near Ventura. He was hanging
around the last couple of days, shak
ing hands and watching practice,
planning maybe to return to Ventura
yesterday.
But things have happened; Pop
Grant's shoulder injury has depleted
the left tackle and Walton is in fine
fettle for playing tackle. Then the
offices of the Registrar and the Dean
of Men began to hum with activity.
I Yesterday Walton came back to
I school and went to classes.

DANA HAS TAKEN
AN INTEREST

Dana has now written down for
written evidence on Morris's con
duct; he wants to either vindicate
the official or take him out of work
ing the U.S.C. game here two weeks
hence.
Do you think that anybody will
write anything down about Morris
to send in? Or say anything more
about the punk officialling to any
one? Or otherwise have his name
mixed into the thing? Maybe I miss
my guess.
Best of all, the pictures show why
it was passing and not running that
, got Stanford down the field. The
Cougars were playing a 7-man line
! throughout, and had difficulty cov
ering all the Stanford receivers.
Often these would be clear by seven
or eight yards, unusual in these days
of 6-2-2-1.
The line was a tough one to han
dle for boys who are used to setting
! against six men, but on occasions,
I especially the first and third Stan
ford touchdown drives, the running
! play gains were admirable. Did you
see how far away from the team the
wingbacks sat on both flankers and
ordinary plays?

WALTON IS
BACK WITH US!

Everybody remembers Jack "Bird
legs" Walton. He was a guard behind
Larry Rouble in 1934, Masque Ball
King, and his 225 pounds and ever
jovial manner used to entertain
players and fans alike. He also
played some good football between
gr-gs.
Walton dropped out of school last
year, and worked for an oil company
down near Ventura. He was hanging
around the last couple of days, shak
ing hands and watching practice,
planning maybe to return to Ventura
yesterday.
But things have happened; Pop
Grant's shoulder injury has depleted
the left tackle and Walton is in fine
fettle for playing tackle. Then the
offices of the Registrar and the Dean
of Men began to hum with activity.
I Yesterday Walton came back to
I school and went to classes.
GRID MOVIES—A

Well, the movies from Pullman
were interesting, didn't you think?
In spite of having been a loyal
Stanford supporter for the last 40
years it seems to me that Jake's un
allowed touchdown plunge was six
of one and a half dozen of the other.
It was an off tackle drive to the
right side, and some Cougar hit him
before he got there. At the team
showing Tuesday night they ran it
about four times, with everyone
studying that rear, or left leg of
Jake's. The knee goes low, about a
yard from a score, but doesn't look
as low as the next time it went all
the way down, after the ball was
safely into scoring territory.
Brigham drove forward with his
eight leg to carry himself over,
kinda dragging the rear one. Bobby
Morris was about five yards directly
behind Brigham, but the head lines
man and some photographers had
perfect views of that rear knee.
Other interesting things came out
—Coffis definitely hit the outside line
with his right heel on the touch
down that was called back, while the
clipping penalty on Stone was really
due to Vigna. Joe was carrying the
ball, and as Stone rolled into a Cou
gar, Vigna veered, the Cougar turned
Farm, after having found time for
only three sessions on the practice
turf. Callison has centered all his
efforts on developing the Oregon
ians' attack, and he figures that as
long as his first string stays on the
field Stanford will have plenty to
worry about.
Last week, he points out, the squad
held Howard Jones' powerful men
of Troy scoreless until half time.
Then, when Jones rushed practically
a whole new line-up into the melee,
the Webfeet were overwhelmed.

GRID MOVIES—A
COMING INSTITUTION

Well, the movies from Pullman
were interesting, didn't you think?
In spite of having been a loyal
Stanford supporter for the last 40
years it seems to me that Jake's un
allowed touchdown plunge was six
of one and a half dozen of the other.
It was an off tackle drive to the
right side, and some Cougar hit him
before he got there. At the team
showing Tuesday night they ran it
about four times, with everyone
studying that rear, or left leg of
Jake's. The knee goes low, about a
yard from a score, but doesn't look
as low as the next time it went all
the way down, after the ball was
safely into scoring territory.
Brigham drove forward with his
eight leg to carry himself over,
kinda dragging the rear one. Bobby
Morris was about five yards directly
behind Brigham, but the head lines
man and some photographers had
perfect views of that rear knee.
Other interesting things came out
—Coffis definitely hit the outside line
with his right heel on the touch
down that was called back, while the
clipping penalty on Stone was really
due to Vigna. Joe was carrying the
ball, and as Stone rolled into a Cou
gar, Vigna veered, the Cougar turned
Farm, after having found time for
only three sessions on the practice
turf. Callison has centered all his
efforts on developing the Oregon
ians' attack, and he figures that as
long as his first string stays on the
field Stanford will have plenty to
worry about.
Last week, he points out, the squad
held Howard Jones' powerful men
of Troy scoreless until half time.
Then, when Jones rushed practically
a whole new line-up into the melee,
the Webfeet were overwhelmed.

DANA HAS TAKEN
AN INTEREST

Dana has now written down for
written evidence on Morris's con
duct; he wants to either vindicate
the official or take him out of work
ing the U.S.C. game here two weeks
hence.
Do you think that anybody will
write anything down about Morris
to send in? Or say anything more
about the punk officialling to any
one? Or otherwise have his name
mixed into the thing? Maybe I miss
my guess.
Best of all, the pictures show why
it was passing and not running that
, got Stanford down the field. The
Cougars were playing a 7-man line
! throughout, and had difficulty cov
ering all the Stanford receivers.
Often these would be clear by seven
or eight yards, unusual in these days
of 6-2-2-1.
The line was a tough one to han
dle for boys who are used to setting
! against six men, but on occasions,
I especially the first and third Stan
ford touchdown drives, the running
! play gains were admirable. Did you
see how far away from the team the
wingbacks sat on both flankers and
ordinary plays?

WALTON IS
BACK WITH US!

Everybody remembers Jack "Bird
legs" Walton. He was a guard behind
Larry Rouble in 1934, Masque Ball
King, and his 225 pounds and ever
jovial manner used to entertain
players and fans alike. He also
played some good football between
gr-gs.
Walton dropped out of school last
year, and worked for an oil company
down near Ventura. He was hanging
around the last couple of days, shak
ing hands and watching practice,
planning maybe to return to Ventura
yesterday.
But things have happened; Pop
Grant's shoulder injury has depleted
the left tackle and Walton is in fine
fettle for playing tackle. Then the
offices of the Registrar and the Dean
of Men began to hum with activity.
I Yesterday Walton came back to
I school and went to classes.
