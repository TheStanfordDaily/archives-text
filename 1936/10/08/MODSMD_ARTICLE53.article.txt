# Indian Soccer Men To Meet San Jose State
## Coach Maloney's Veteran Eleven Vies for First Title in Four Years 
### 
After one brief week of drill, the
Stanford soccer squad launches its
1936 conference season with a game
Saturday against San Jose State.
The Cardinal team ended well up
in the top flight last year, but this
fall it is gunning for its first title
in four autumns. Foremost in the
competition will be California and
the University of San Francisco, co
holders of the 1835 championship.
Lettermen Return
Coach Harry Maloney has an ex
perienced eleven. Ten lettermen are
available for the first string, along
with several of frosh experience.
Assistant Coach Dick Bullis, who
had complete charge of the team last
year during Maloney's absence, has
a tentative line-up ready for the
opening tilt. Paul Helms is sched
uled to start at goal, Dick Hanna at
right back, and Wayne Richardson at
left back. Two freshmen numeral
winners, George Chalmers and Ir
ving Hawkins, are after the right
half post, while capable Dave Sloane
is at left. Bob Hall, veteran star, is
slated to take the field at center half.
Injury Jinx Fought
Outside right will be Carl Schaupp
and inside right either A1 Dibble or
Howard Naquin. The center forward
position goes to Harry Lowe, inside
left to Pete Knecht and outside left
to one of two vets, Chuck Parker or
"Pooch" Nightingale.
Stanford took a 2-1 decision from
San Jose in 1935, but as in previous
years the opposition will have the
advantage of more practice and some
official play. The Redmen will at
tempt to break an injury jinx which
has persisted for several seasons. The
misfortune of a broken leg has at
tended each San Jose contest and
this time the locals hope to avert
such a calamity.
When Birdlegs and Mrs. Goestle,
scholastic standing expert, untangled
his eligibility, Stanford will be ahead
one good but slightly used lineman.
