# The 						Mud Fight Is Here to Stay
## 
### 
When I was a freshman I ditched the Mud
Fight on the pretense that I had a book due at
the library, when a sophomore, I told the guys
at the house I had a story due at The Daily.
Therefore I am fully qualified, as are several
women who have spoken on the subject, to
urge the retention of the Mud Fight as a vital
tradition of Stanford, one which will save Stan
ford from going "sissy."
The mudfight is a great asset to The Daily,
because we can take pictures of it and print
them in the paper. They tell me that the mud
fight also helps to organize the frosh class. They
say that it is a lot of fun, and that if kids want to
go out and have a lot of fun; what if a few of
them do get hurt?
I heartily agree that the Mud Fight does or
ganize the frosh class. But can someone in the
audience tell me why the frosh class needs to
be organized? Is there any function to an organ
ized class other than being organized? We no
sooner get the frosh organized here at Stanford
than we disorganize them by sending part of
them up the Row and the rest of them up the
Hall. Yes, the freshmen should make friends
with other freshmen. I don't exactly see, though
how shoving a sophomore in the face fulfills
that purpose, but it must be interesting.
What fun it is to have traditions! We have
one about No Smoking on the Quad. But this
is slowly dying, despite the fact that it has very
good economic and social grounds to support it.
It lowers the Farm insurance rate, and it keeps
smoke out of the eyes and lungs of those who
don't smoke. The tradition is dying because it
doesn't seem to suit the personal convenience of
those who do smoke. Traditions are very nice.
They add flavor. Stanford has several. It even
has a new one, such as Gros' no-hat-check tip
ping tradition, started last year. And the ride
to-Paly tradition. The Mud Fight tradition is one
of only five or six years duration. And a Mud
Fight Tradition is good only for the perpetuation
of the Mud Fight, as far as I can see—something
like organizing the frosh class in order to organ
ize the frosh class.
We now progress to the fun part of it. I am
not broad enough (or tall enough) in my view
point to understand what fun it is to throw a kid
smaller than myself in a mud pit. The reason
for this is that there are few kids smaller than
myself, and I am always the on 6 that gets
thrown in.
But I supopse there is a fierce, sadistic joy to
it, something like gouging a guy's eyes out with
a poker. Since football and basketball players
are theoretically not supposed to participate
in the mud fights, the men who get fun out of it
are the medium-sized boys who get to throw the
batamweights in. Now for the bantamweight,
there is the fun of being a good sport about it,
falling in with mud oozing up, covering up a still
grinning face, hoping that some fraternity man
will see an put a pin on. This is what is known,
they tell me, as dirty rushing.
There also is a good deal of fun in flexing
the muscles. 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, though this can be
done, too, at home, in front of an open window.
Now the medium weights say that this is very
much fun for the bantamweights. Based on the
assumption, of course, that the bantamweights
go under still grinning. But the reason that the
bantamweights go under still grinning is that
there is a great deal of moral suasion. The me
diumweight class, seeing that they get fun out
of throwing bantamweights into the mud have
built up the slave morality, that in order to prove
your virility and manhood, you must flex your
muscles 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, and go under still grin
n ng. There is probably nobody more sensitive
about his masculinity than a bantamweight. That
is why the first guy in grammar school to smoke
is usually some droop with a t.b. chest; he is
very intense in his ardor to prove his daring.
And that is why the bantamweights go out for
the Mud Fight, and go under still grinning.
Whether there is any great coercion directly
exerted on the freshman puny, is a disputable
tjuestion, but there are a lot of punies who

don't know any better than to go out and make
asses out of themselves.
Some of our enlightened despots contend,
though, that it is very good for the punies to
have asses made of themselves. It makes men
of them. This seems to be a somewhat dis
credited philosophy amongst some of the des
pots even more enlightened, but it bears refuta
tion. The in-group morality of the past held that
we need such initiatory rites to prove the ability
of the new groups to guard the esoteric mys
teries of the order. The modern theory seems
to be, though, that we aren't requiring our stu
dents to "Die for dear old Stanford" anymore,
but to live for dear old Stannford. And the only
trial by ordeal we now have is the Aptitude
Test. That is as it should be. In Stanford's
.struggle for existence in this competitive so
ciety, it seems possible that we can use a few
good central nervous systems, whereas the me
dium weight who can throw more bantam
weights in the sludge is apt to prove of service
to Stanford as a senior soccer manager. I hope
that this takes care of that.
There has been some talk of trying to find a
substitute for the Mud Fight, such as a taffy-pull
or a fashion show, with prizes awarded for the
most double-breasted suits. If the groups feel
that the freshmen need some welcome other
than the Aptitude Test and the Pre-Reg period,
they might install an automatic machine that
punches them in the nose as the lady in the
Ad Building stamps their first $115 check. But
anything else, to me, seems like a waste of
time.
There are fewer and fewer sophomores every
year who think with their muscles and like to
throw things. There are fewer freshmen who
like to get thrown. When the state of civilization
has reached such a peak that the masses who
don't like to throw things outweigh the influ
ence of the few influential medium weights who
do, we will have no more childishness such as
the Mud Fight.
Until that time, The Daily will support the
Mud Fight because it is a tradition and because
it organizes the frosh class, and because edits
should never go against the influence of vested
medium weight interests.

substitute for the Mud Fight, such as a taffy-pull
or a fashion show, with prizes awarded for the
most double-breasted suits. If the groups feel
that the freshmen need some welcome other
than the Aptitude Test and the Pre-Reg period,
they might install an automatic machine that
punches them in the nose as the lady in the
Ad Building stamps their first $115 check. But
anything else, to me, seems like a waste of
time.
There are fewer and fewer sophomores every
year who think with their muscles and like to
throw things. There are fewer freshmen who
like to get thrown. When the state of civilization
has reached such a peak that the masses who
don't like to throw things outweigh the influ
ence of the few influential medium weights who
do, we will have no more childishness such as
the Mud Fight.
Until that time, The Daily will support the
Mud Fight because it is a tradition and because
it organizes the frosh class, and because edits
should never go against the influence of vested
medium weight interests.
When I was a freshman I ditched the Mud
Fight on the pretense that I had a book due at
the library, when a sophomore, I told the guys
at the house I had a story due at The Daily.
Therefore I am fully qualified, as are several
women who have spoken on the subject, to
urge the retention of the Mud Fight as a vital
tradition of Stanford, one which will save Stan
ford from going "sissy."
The mudfight is a great asset to The Daily,
because we can take pictures of it and print
them in the paper. They tell me that the mud
fight also helps to organize the frosh class. They
say that it is a lot of fun, and that if kids want to
go out and have a lot of fun; what if a few of
them do get hurt?
I heartily agree that the Mud Fight does or
ganize the frosh class. But can someone in the
audience tell me why the frosh class needs to
be organized? Is there any function to an organ
ized class other than being organized? We no
sooner get the frosh organized here at Stanford
than we disorganize them by sending part of
them up the Row and the rest of them up the
Hall. Yes, the freshmen should make friends
with other freshmen. I don't exactly see, though
how shoving a sophomore in the face fulfills
that purpose, but it must be interesting.
What fun it is to have traditions! We have
one about No Smoking on the Quad. But this
is slowly dying, despite the fact that it has very
good economic and social grounds to support it.
It lowers the Farm insurance rate, and it keeps
smoke out of the eyes and lungs of those who
don't smoke. The tradition is dying because it
doesn't seem to suit the personal convenience of
those who do smoke. Traditions are very nice.
They add flavor. Stanford has several. It even
has a new one, such as Gros' no-hat-check tip
ping tradition, started last year. And the ride
to-Paly tradition. The Mud Fight tradition is one
of only five or six years duration. And a Mud
Fight Tradition is good only for the perpetuation
of the Mud Fight, as far as I can see—something
like organizing the frosh class in order to organ
ize the frosh class.
We now progress to the fun part of it. I am
not broad enough (or tall enough) in my view
point to understand what fun it is to throw a kid
smaller than myself in a mud pit. The reason
for this is that there are few kids smaller than
myself, and I am always the on 6 that gets
thrown in.
But I supopse there is a fierce, sadistic joy to
it, something like gouging a guy's eyes out with
a poker. Since football and basketball players
are theoretically not supposed to participate
in the mud fights, the men who get fun out of it
are the medium-sized boys who get to throw the
batamweights in. Now for the bantamweight,
there is the fun of being a good sport about it,
falling in with mud oozing up, covering up a still
grinning face, hoping that some fraternity man
will see an put a pin on. This is what is known,
they tell me, as dirty rushing.
There also is a good deal of fun in flexing
the muscles. 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, though this can be
done, too, at home, in front of an open window.
Now the medium weights say that this is very
much fun for the bantamweights. Based on the
assumption, of course, that the bantamweights
go under still grinning. But the reason that the
bantamweights go under still grinning is that
there is a great deal of moral suasion. The me
diumweight class, seeing that they get fun out
of throwing bantamweights into the mud have
built up the slave morality, that in order to prove
your virility and manhood, you must flex your
muscles 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, and go under still grin
n ng. There is probably nobody more sensitive
about his masculinity than a bantamweight. That
is why the first guy in grammar school to smoke
is usually some droop with a t.b. chest; he is
very intense in his ardor to prove his daring.
And that is why the bantamweights go out for
the Mud Fight, and go under still grinning.
Whether there is any great coercion directly
exerted on the freshman puny, is a disputable
tjuestion, but there are a lot of punies who

don't know any better than to go out and make
asses out of themselves.
Some of our enlightened despots contend,
though, that it is very good for the punies to
have asses made of themselves. It makes men
of them. This seems to be a somewhat dis
credited philosophy amongst some of the des
pots even more enlightened, but it bears refuta
tion. The in-group morality of the past held that
we need such initiatory rites to prove the ability
of the new groups to guard the esoteric mys
teries of the order. The modern theory seems
to be, though, that we aren't requiring our stu
dents to "Die for dear old Stanford" anymore,
but to live for dear old Stannford. And the only
trial by ordeal we now have is the Aptitude
Test. That is as it should be. In Stanford's
.struggle for existence in this competitive so
ciety, it seems possible that we can use a few
good central nervous systems, whereas the me
dium weight who can throw more bantam
weights in the sludge is apt to prove of service
to Stanford as a senior soccer manager. I hope
that this takes care of that.

have asses made of themselves. It makes men
of them. This seems to be a somewhat dis
credited philosophy amongst some of the des
pots even more enlightened, but it bears refuta
tion. The in-group morality of the past held that
we need such initiatory rites to prove the ability
of the new groups to guard the esoteric mys
teries of the order. The modern theory seems
to be, though, that we aren't requiring our stu
dents to "Die for dear old Stanford" anymore,
but to live for dear old Stannford. And the only
trial by ordeal we now have is the Aptitude
Test. That is as it should be. In Stanford's
.struggle for existence in this competitive so
ciety, it seems possible that we can use a few
good central nervous systems, whereas the me
dium weight who can throw more bantam
weights in the sludge is apt to prove of service
to Stanford as a senior soccer manager. I hope
that this takes care of that.
There has been some talk of trying to find a
substitute for the Mud Fight, such as a taffy-pull
or a fashion show, with prizes awarded for the
most double-breasted suits. If the groups feel
that the freshmen need some welcome other
than the Aptitude Test and the Pre-Reg period,
they might install an automatic machine that
punches them in the nose as the lady in the
Ad Building stamps their first $115 check. But
anything else, to me, seems like a waste of
time.
There are fewer and fewer sophomores every
year who think with their muscles and like to
throw things. There are fewer freshmen who
like to get thrown. When the state of civilization
has reached such a peak that the masses who
don't like to throw things outweigh the influ
ence of the few influential medium weights who
do, we will have no more childishness such as
the Mud Fight.
Until that time, The Daily will support the
Mud Fight because it is a tradition and because
it organizes the frosh class, and because edits
should never go against the influence of vested
medium weight interests.
When I was a freshman I ditched the Mud
Fight on the pretense that I had a book due at
the library, when a sophomore, I told the guys
at the house I had a story due at The Daily.
Therefore I am fully qualified, as are several
women who have spoken on the subject, to
urge the retention of the Mud Fight as a vital
tradition of Stanford, one which will save Stan
ford from going "sissy."
The mudfight is a great asset to The Daily,
because we can take pictures of it and print
them in the paper. They tell me that the mud
fight also helps to organize the frosh class. They
say that it is a lot of fun, and that if kids want to
go out and have a lot of fun; what if a few of
them do get hurt?
I heartily agree that the Mud Fight does or
ganize the frosh class. But can someone in the
audience tell me why the frosh class needs to
be organized? Is there any function to an organ
ized class other than being organized? We no
sooner get the frosh organized here at Stanford
than we disorganize them by sending part of
them up the Row and the rest of them up the
Hall. Yes, the freshmen should make friends
with other freshmen. I don't exactly see, though
how shoving a sophomore in the face fulfills
that purpose, but it must be interesting.
What fun it is to have traditions! We have
one about No Smoking on the Quad. But this
is slowly dying, despite the fact that it has very
good economic and social grounds to support it.
It lowers the Farm insurance rate, and it keeps
smoke out of the eyes and lungs of those who
don't smoke. The tradition is dying because it
doesn't seem to suit the personal convenience of
those who do smoke. Traditions are very nice.
They add flavor. Stanford has several. It even
has a new one, such as Gros' no-hat-check tip
ping tradition, started last year. And the ride
to-Paly tradition. The Mud Fight tradition is one
of only five or six years duration. And a Mud
Fight Tradition is good only for the perpetuation
of the Mud Fight, as far as I can see—something
like organizing the frosh class in order to organ
ize the frosh class.
We now progress to the fun part of it. I am
not broad enough (or tall enough) in my view
point to understand what fun it is to throw a kid
smaller than myself in a mud pit. The reason
for this is that there are few kids smaller than
myself, and I am always the on 6 that gets
thrown in.
But I supopse there is a fierce, sadistic joy to
it, something like gouging a guy's eyes out with
a poker. Since football and basketball players
are theoretically not supposed to participate
in the mud fights, the men who get fun out of it
are the medium-sized boys who get to throw the
batamweights in. Now for the bantamweight,
there is the fun of being a good sport about it,
falling in with mud oozing up, covering up a still
grinning face, hoping that some fraternity man
will see an put a pin on. This is what is known,
they tell me, as dirty rushing.
There also is a good deal of fun in flexing
the muscles. 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, though this can be
done, too, at home, in front of an open window.
Now the medium weights say that this is very
much fun for the bantamweights. Based on the
assumption, of course, that the bantamweights
go under still grinning. But the reason that the
bantamweights go under still grinning is that
there is a great deal of moral suasion. The me
diumweight class, seeing that they get fun out
of throwing bantamweights into the mud have
built up the slave morality, that in order to prove
your virility and manhood, you must flex your
muscles 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, and go under still grin
n ng. There is probably nobody more sensitive
about his masculinity than a bantamweight. That
is why the first guy in grammar school to smoke
is usually some droop with a t.b. chest; he is
very intense in his ardor to prove his daring.
And that is why the bantamweights go out for
the Mud Fight, and go under still grinning.
Whether there is any great coercion directly
exerted on the freshman puny, is a disputable
tjuestion, but there are a lot of punies who

don't know any better than to go out and make
asses out of themselves.
Some of our enlightened despots contend,
though, that it is very good for the punies to

there is a great deal of moral suasion. The me
diumweight class, seeing that they get fun out
of throwing bantamweights into the mud have
built up the slave morality, that in order to prove
your virility and manhood, you must flex your
muscles 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, and go under still grin
n ng. There is probably nobody more sensitive
about his masculinity than a bantamweight. That
is why the first guy in grammar school to smoke
is usually some droop with a t.b. chest; he is
very intense in his ardor to prove his daring.
And that is why the bantamweights go out for
the Mud Fight, and go under still grinning.
Whether there is any great coercion directly
exerted on the freshman puny, is a disputable
tjuestion, but there are a lot of punies who

don't know any better than to go out and make
asses out of themselves.
Some of our enlightened despots contend,
though, that it is very good for the punies to
have asses made of themselves. It makes men
of them. This seems to be a somewhat dis
credited philosophy amongst some of the des
pots even more enlightened, but it bears refuta
tion. The in-group morality of the past held that
we need such initiatory rites to prove the ability
of the new groups to guard the esoteric mys
teries of the order. The modern theory seems
to be, though, that we aren't requiring our stu
dents to "Die for dear old Stanford" anymore,
but to live for dear old Stannford. And the only
trial by ordeal we now have is the Aptitude
Test. That is as it should be. In Stanford's
.struggle for existence in this competitive so
ciety, it seems possible that we can use a few
good central nervous systems, whereas the me
dium weight who can throw more bantam
weights in the sludge is apt to prove of service
to Stanford as a senior soccer manager. I hope
that this takes care of that.
There has been some talk of trying to find a
substitute for the Mud Fight, such as a taffy-pull
or a fashion show, with prizes awarded for the
most double-breasted suits. If the groups feel
that the freshmen need some welcome other
than the Aptitude Test and the Pre-Reg period,
they might install an automatic machine that
punches them in the nose as the lady in the
Ad Building stamps their first $115 check. But
anything else, to me, seems like a waste of
time.
There are fewer and fewer sophomores every
year who think with their muscles and like to
throw things. There are fewer freshmen who
like to get thrown. When the state of civilization
has reached such a peak that the masses who
don't like to throw things outweigh the influ
ence of the few influential medium weights who
do, we will have no more childishness such as
the Mud Fight.
Until that time, The Daily will support the
Mud Fight because it is a tradition and because
it organizes the frosh class, and because edits
should never go against the influence of vested
medium weight interests.
When I was a freshman I ditched the Mud
Fight on the pretense that I had a book due at
the library, when a sophomore, I told the guys
at the house I had a story due at The Daily.
Therefore I am fully qualified, as are several
women who have spoken on the subject, to
urge the retention of the Mud Fight as a vital
tradition of Stanford, one which will save Stan
ford from going "sissy."
The mudfight is a great asset to The Daily,
because we can take pictures of it and print
them in the paper. They tell me that the mud
fight also helps to organize the frosh class. They
say that it is a lot of fun, and that if kids want to
go out and have a lot of fun; what if a few of
them do get hurt?
I heartily agree that the Mud Fight does or
ganize the frosh class. But can someone in the
audience tell me why the frosh class needs to
be organized? Is there any function to an organ
ized class other than being organized? We no
sooner get the frosh organized here at Stanford
than we disorganize them by sending part of
them up the Row and the rest of them up the
Hall. Yes, the freshmen should make friends
with other freshmen. I don't exactly see, though
how shoving a sophomore in the face fulfills
that purpose, but it must be interesting.
What fun it is to have traditions! We have
one about No Smoking on the Quad. But this
is slowly dying, despite the fact that it has very
good economic and social grounds to support it.
It lowers the Farm insurance rate, and it keeps
smoke out of the eyes and lungs of those who
don't smoke. The tradition is dying because it
doesn't seem to suit the personal convenience of
those who do smoke. Traditions are very nice.
They add flavor. Stanford has several. It even
has a new one, such as Gros' no-hat-check tip
ping tradition, started last year. And the ride
to-Paly tradition. The Mud Fight tradition is one
of only five or six years duration. And a Mud
Fight Tradition is good only for the perpetuation
of the Mud Fight, as far as I can see—something
like organizing the frosh class in order to organ
ize the frosh class.
We now progress to the fun part of it. I am
not broad enough (or tall enough) in my view
point to understand what fun it is to throw a kid
smaller than myself in a mud pit. The reason
for this is that there are few kids smaller than
myself, and I am always the on 6 that gets
thrown in.
But I supopse there is a fierce, sadistic joy to
it, something like gouging a guy's eyes out with
a poker. Since football and basketball players
are theoretically not supposed to participate
in the mud fights, the men who get fun out of it
are the medium-sized boys who get to throw the
batamweights in. Now for the bantamweight,
there is the fun of being a good sport about it,
falling in with mud oozing up, covering up a still
grinning face, hoping that some fraternity man
will see an put a pin on. This is what is known,
they tell me, as dirty rushing.
There also is a good deal of fun in flexing
the muscles. 1-2-3-4; 1-2-3-4, though this can be
done, too, at home, in front of an open window.
Now the medium weights say that this is very
much fun for the bantamweights. Based on the
assumption, of course, that the bantamweights
go under still grinning. But the reason that the
bantamweights go under still grinning is that
there is a great deal of moral suasion. The me
diumweight class, seeing that they get fun out
of throwing bantamweights into the mud have
built up the slave morality, that in order to prove
your virility and manhood, you must flex your
