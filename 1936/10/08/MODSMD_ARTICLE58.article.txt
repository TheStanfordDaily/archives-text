# BULL SESSION
## THE 						COLD AND CLAMMY DOPE 
### 
If women proverbially have the last word, expe
rience shows that men have the first. And if it's the
women who tease a gal to death socially with the feline
barbs of insult, it's the men who open the first wound
with the clumsy bludgeon of rumor.
Almost any night of any school year where men
gather, a bull session not only gets around to sex, but
climaxes with a fictional story of some gal who is not
only a hot number, but a walking aphrodisiac.
* $ *
Amateurs at the art of defilement-by-remote-con
trol are content to tell a lurid story "they only heard."
Merely because it gives their story credence, they
include the name of some pretty, popular and desir
able gal.
But the professionals, those salacious Shakespeares,
use a name as a necessary dramatic device. And their
stories are almost invariably worth listening to—not
only as basically gratifying tales, but as works of art.
Their product perfectly assumes the disguise of a
bona fide narrative. Apd even the keenest of their
auditors, who make a sophisticate's discount, tend to
retell the story always with the Fatal Name. They give
legal blackmail the currency of sound social money.
* * # *
Through the years at Stanford, one can count hun
dreds of social ghosts, the gals who may have loved
wisely, but who gave the impression they might love
too well.
It isn't the women who seize on that impression and
build it into a seamy moral indictment. They brand
their sisters Scarlet only as their moral obligation.
It is the men who do the pre-requisite dirty work—
and dirty it is. For it takes from a gal almost every
chance to be a success—matrimonially or professionally.
It is a sacrifice, more cruel than those of Moloch and
Baal.
* * * *
Women's "back fence" volley ball is just intramural
sports compared to the varsity rugby of a stag picnic.
Yet the noble male, fresh from an artistic victory
and a moral slaughter, will invariably jerk his thumb
deprecatingly at a gang of females, determinedly fin
ishing the grisly job he started the night before.

Women's "back fence" volley ball is just intramural
sports compared to the varsity rugby of a stag picnic.
Yet the noble male, fresh from an artistic victory
and a moral slaughter, will invariably jerk his thumb
deprecatingly at a gang of females, determinedly fin
ishing the grisly job he started the night before.

If women proverbially have the last word, expe
rience shows that men have the first. And if it's the
women who tease a gal to death socially with the feline
barbs of insult, it's the men who open the first wound
with the clumsy bludgeon of rumor.
Almost any night of any school year where men
gather, a bull session not only gets around to sex, but
climaxes with a fictional story of some gal who is not
only a hot number, but a walking aphrodisiac.

Amateurs at the art of defilement-by-remote-con
trol are content to tell a lurid story "they only heard."
Merely because it gives their story credence, they
include the name of some pretty, popular and desir
able gal.
But the professionals, those salacious Shakespeares,
use a name as a necessary dramatic device. And their
stories are almost invariably worth listening to—not
only as basically gratifying tales, but as works of art.
Their product perfectly assumes the disguise of a
bona fide narrative. Apd even the keenest of their
auditors, who make a sophisticate's discount, tend to
retell the story always with the Fatal Name. They give
legal blackmail the currency of sound social money.

Through the years at Stanford, one can count hun
dreds of social ghosts, the gals who may have loved
wisely, but who gave the impression they might love
too well.
It isn't the women who seize on that impression and
build it into a seamy moral indictment. They brand
their sisters Scarlet only as their moral obligation.
It is the men who do the pre-requisite dirty work—
and dirty it is. For it takes from a gal almost every
chance to be a success—matrimonially or professionally.
It is a sacrifice, more cruel than those of Moloch and
Baal.
