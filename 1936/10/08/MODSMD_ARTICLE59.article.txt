"There is no cold epidemic, cough, cough."
I just want to make that clear before we continue
with the business at hand.
However, people do have colds. One such was a
member of that home for rested men, the S.A.E. house.
About 5 o'clock one afternoon this week he informed
the brothers that he was going to drive himself, his
cold, and his fever down to the hospital. They offered
to drive him down, but he shushed them with a wave
of his hand, his cold, and his fever.
A day later, he rang up the home for rested men
and asked somebody to come down and drive him back
to the house.
This consternated the boys no end, but they drove
down and picked him up, and discovered to their sur
prise that his car was gone. When the walking plague
returned to the S.A.E. house, he, in turn, was conster
nated at. finding no automobile.
This deserved some explanation, so the S.A.E.'s
called the hospital, discovered from the nurses that
the brother had wandered into the hospital at 7 o'clock
the night before, suffering from amnesia. This did not
account for the missing automobile, though.
Since the cold cookie had lost his memory between
5 and 7 o'clock, the mystery of what happened to his
car remained unsolved.
A day later, the S.A.E.'s were sitting on the steps
of their home for rested men, and a sophomore D.G.
buzzed past in the cold cookie's car. The cold one
hailed the D.G. and asked if he could have his car
back. She said, "O.K. Thanks a lot."
However, this does not mean that the mystery is
I solved by any means. Now, the S.A.E. does not dare
iask the D.G. how she got the car, because as far as he
knows, they've never been introduced.
