Lac Aux Dames at the Varsity
Theater
It is instructive to take a long
range peep through our bifocals oc
casionally, see what countries other
than Great Britain and our own are
doing in moving pictures. For to me
"Lac Aux Dames" was more inter
esting as an example of continental
film craftsmanship than because it
marked the advent of Simon Simone.
The story in itself is unremark
able. A proud but penniless young
engineer is forced to teach swimming
lessons in a summer resort where he
is uncomfortably adored by his
charges, wealthy Rosine Derean and
an elfish girl named Puck (Simon
Simone). Oddly, Rosine wins out.
Direction plods and what might
have been a climax is chopped into
a series of prolonged if minor ca
tastrophes. There is no x*esolution to

the problem, only a last minute fran
tic tying up of ends which, to those
accustomed to Hollywood's thwack
ing finishes, must seem incomplete,
inadequate. We feel that Erik might
better have chosen Puck, that he will
go on, a bewildered impractical. And
that is what lends worth; character
ization is not subordinated to plot
exigency.
The slow direction pace has one
merit; it establishes a distinct mood
that is repeated in the bleak lake
scenes, intensified by George Auric's
musical score.
Commendably unselfconscious
handling of love scenes reminds us
of the moral gap between America
and Europe, invites unwelcome
speculation as to the methods by
which Hollywood, prim since her re
cent decency purge, might slyly have
suggested Facts. —Warson
