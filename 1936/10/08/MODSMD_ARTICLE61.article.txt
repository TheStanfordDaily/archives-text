# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps to our friend of Wednes
day's Campus Opinion column it
may appear odd that the Daily would
print a story on the Salinas strike.
To many of us it is most encouraging.
What is better news than something
happening "locally"—no matter how
ugly a mess that story may present?
Undoubtedly Mr. Tracy would be
given a warm reception were he to
journey to Salinas. Which proves
exactly what? Only that California
vigilantism—of which we ought all
to be ashamed—thrives on our door
step!
Perhaps our friend of yesterday
forgets that it is today "illegal" for a
labor union to carry on legal picket
ing in Salinas or Monterey county.
That a lettuce packer willing to come
to an agreement with the union can
not procure ice with which to pack
his lettuce. That even the avowedly
"non-radical S.F. Chronicle" sees fit
to expose the conditions in Salinas.
Not a tasty story, 'tis true. And
it may prove little to my friend of
yesterday. But these facts al - e true,
they are news, and Stanford stu
dents have a right to know them
through their own press. May the
Daily continue to furnish us "news."

The Editor, Sir:
Being new to Stanford and labor
ing under the impossible delusion
that I was attending a university, I
am glad to be set right by "one who
was here in 1932" on the "Rough"
question.
As soon as possible I shall discard
my conventional tie, etc., for a boy
ish emulation of one of the follow
ing characters: (1) the southern poor
white or negro (affected by checker
ed, multi-colored shirt); (2) the
choo-choo engineer (achieved by
blue denim whip (accomplished by
polo shirt); (3) the hybrid Tommy
Hitchcock-Hollywood whip (accom
plished by polo shirt); (4) the sailor
—any one of several nautical types
(regular 69c, selling this week at all
the best stores for $2).
In the event I am unable to bring
myself to these garments I shall
compromise by whipping into a
masquerade as the human germ by
wearing cords forever.

The Editor, Sir:
The Daily was really good.
Congratulations. Let's have more
of them, and let's not have the fic
tion grow too preponderant nor the
articles too light in vein.
Here is an opportunity for the
profs to give all the students a break
by writing analyses and descriptions

of situations and things which they
are authorities on. Here is a chance
for students in general to express
themselves and pass on worthwhile
thoughts and experiences.
Here is a chance for publication
of student humor, verse, and short
fiction.
We hope that next Monday's issue
will be bigger and better, so much a
part of Stanford that we will keep it
long after other Dailies have been
thrown in the waste-basket, and
crammed full of thought provoking
articles. On with The Daily.
