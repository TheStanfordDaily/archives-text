Mr. George Bromley, who is cer
tainly one of Stanford's most expe
rienced men as well as being more
intelligible than Jorgi's oft-quoted
kitchen oracle, says that people who
gamble, gamble to make money.
Brom's experience runs all the way
from being a sucker himself to be
ing a shill man and sucker-lure at
a carnival where the old army game
was opened for just a half an hour
on the last night of the stand to pay
the carnival's entire expenses. Being
a sucker hurt him the most, he says,
somewhere up in Montana where he
put several hundred dollars of some
body's else's money on a fist full of
four kings. All the other guy had
was two pair, but they came from
the bottom of the deck and were two
pairs of aces and Brom had to make
good the money by floating a short
term loan in a hurry.

At this point the Amalgamated
Penny-Ante-Dime-Limit Fraternity
Poker Trusts will rise to state that
they play for fun only; but when the
financial angle is defended on the
grounds that money makes the game
interesting, it looks as if the money
itself were the interesting thing. And
when some poor unfortunate is being
taken for a bad ride nobody would
be so brazen as to assert that he was
having as much fun as he was paying
for. After all, when marbles are
played for keeps, it is only fun when
you're winning.
Of course there has been a lot of
moral preaching about the sin of
gambling, but when almost any ven
ture of any sort has all kinds of un
certainty about it, standing pat on 16
is only one outstanding form of a
gamble. It may be too bad to com
mercialize moi'ality, but nonetheless
the financial aspect of what may hap
pen to your shirt in a game that is
not necessarily sti'ip poker seems
more important than what Lady
Luck does to your soul. And it is a
sad commentary on human perspi
cacity that few seem to realize that
the lady of chance can be kicked in
the teeth only a few times before
she gets tough.

But then we came here neither to
bury gambling nor to suggest that
Barnum was conservative in esti
mating the production rate of those
who keep the various mechanical
pickpocket devices on the highway

flushed with gold. Rather, in so
many superfluous words, we came
on a wild goose chase to find out,
if everybody who gambles loses,
who wins?
The answer seems to be that
gambling as a method of redistribut
ing the wealth has no justice at all
about it, and when everybody loses,
the one who wins is invariably some
lucky sap who never needed the
money anyway.

NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (/P)—"Life,"
52-year-old humorous magazine, has
been sold to the magazine Time at
an unannounced price, it was an
nounced today at the former's of
fice. It was said Lite would cease
publication next week.

Rome was probably at its lowest
ebb in the year 1365, when it is said
to have contained a population of
only 17,000.
Mr. George Bromley, who is cer
tainly one of Stanford's most expe
rienced men as well as being more
intelligible than Jorgi's oft-quoted
kitchen oracle, says that people who
gamble, gamble to make money.
Brom's experience runs all the way
from being a sucker himself to be
ing a shill man and sucker-lure at
a carnival where the old army game
was opened for just a half an hour
on the last night of the stand to pay
the carnival's entire expenses. Being
a sucker hurt him the most, he says,
somewhere up in Montana where he
put several hundred dollars of some
body's else's money on a fist full of
four kings. All the other guy had
was two pair, but they came from
the bottom of the deck and were two
pairs of aces and Brom had to make
good the money by floating a short
term loan in a hurry.
♦ * *
At this point the Amalgamated
Penny-Ante-Dime-Limit Fraternity
Poker Trusts will rise to state that
they play for fun only; but when the
financial angle is defended on the
grounds that money makes the game
interesting, it looks as if the money
itself were the interesting thing. And
when some poor unfortunate is being
taken for a bad ride nobody would
be so brazen as to assert that he was
having as much fun as he was paying
for. After all, when marbles are
played for keeps, it is only fun when
you're winning.
Of course there has been a lot of
moral preaching about the sin of
gambling, but when almost any ven
ture of any sort has all kinds of un
certainty about it, standing pat on 16
is only one outstanding form of a
gamble. It may be too bad to com
mercialize moi'ality, but nonetheless
the financial aspect of what may hap
pen to your shirt in a game that is
not necessarily sti'ip poker seems
more important than what Lady
Luck does to your soul. And it is a
sad commentary on human perspi
cacity that few seem to realize that
the lady of chance can be kicked in
the teeth only a few times before
she gets tough.
* * #
But then we came here neither to
bury gambling nor to suggest that
Barnum was conservative in esti
mating the production rate of those
who keep the various mechanical
pickpocket devices on the highway

flushed with gold. Rather, in so
many superfluous words, we came
on a wild goose chase to find out,
if everybody who gambles loses,
who wins?
The answer seems to be that
gambling as a method of redistribut
ing the wealth has no justice at all
about it, and when everybody loses,
the one who wins is invariably some
lucky sap who never needed the
money anyway.
