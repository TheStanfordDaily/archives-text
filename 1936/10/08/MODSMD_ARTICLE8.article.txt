# Library Seeks Old Chappies
## 
### 
A gap in their 1934-35 files of
Chaparral will be filled, hopes the
Stanford library, by back number
contributions of the funny mag from
students owning such antique issues.
Much thanks from the library
goes to Gordy Steedirian for donat
ing the October and November edi
tions of 1934 and the February num
ber for 1935. Any other back num
bers of Chappie will be eagerly ac
cepted at the library to be used in
composing a duplicate file for the
Felton library which will soon be
available to the reading public.
