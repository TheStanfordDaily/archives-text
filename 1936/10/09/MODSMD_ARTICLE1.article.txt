# Committee Last Harrier To Mud-fight
## Freshmen, Sophs, Agree Unanimously To Hold Brawl Next Thursday 
### HARRY PRESS 
Subject to Ex Committee approval,
the mud-fight will be held! This
news, for which frosh and sophs alike
have been waiting for several days,
was announced last night after a
meeting attended by representatives
of both classes and the sub-commit
tee appointed to study the question.
Holding their get-together in the
Union, sub-committee members
Chick Franieh and Roy Thompson,
Soph Prexy Pete Fay, and Joe Mul
ligan, captain of the frosh team, were
unanimous in their opinion that the
traditional mud-fight should take
place.
Next Week?
If Ex Committee places its stamp
of approval on the report at its
meeting next Tuesday night, the
slush slinging will entertain frosh
and other spectators Thursday after
noon, October 15, on the west end of
the practice football field.
"I feel that the mud-fight is a fine
tradition," commented Committee
Member Franieh, "in that it gives
the frosh and sophs a chance to let
off excess steam which otherwise
might lead to more serious conse
quences, such as former soph raids
on Encina."
Fay Froths
When warred that the mud fight
would be definitely abolished in the
future unless more soph enthusiasm
were shown. Fay said: "We're not
going to skip the chance to be the
first class to win the fight both in
our frosh and soph years, and will
have more fellows on the field this
lime than we had when Phil Zonne
led us to a close victory last year."
