EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 8 CU.R). â€”
Coach Prink Callison and 29 of his
University of Oregon gridsters left
for Palo Alto today for renewal of
gridiron warfare Saturday with
Stanford.
Despite loss of Joe Huston, regular
guarjl, and Bud Goodin, veteran
back, who are out for the season
with knee injuries, the Webfeet were
in fine spirit and hoped to avenge
the 33-7 defeat handed them by the
Indians in 1929, last meeting between
the teams.
Attack Planned
Callison planned a wide-open at
tack against Stanford, and indicated
at least six sophomores would be
in Saturday's starting lineup.
Tom Blackman, 190-pound soph
triple-threater, will be shifted from
halfback to fullback to replace
Goodin. Sophomore Jean Lacau,
former San B'rancisco All-City prep
star, may share full backing duties
with Blackman.
Redwood City Boy to Start
Jimmy Nicholson, another sopho
more, will start at left half. The
veteran Bob Braddock will be at
right half, and Don Kennedy, Red
wood City, California, a reserve from
last year, will fill the blocking quar
ter berth.
The four other sophomores who
will likely start are: Hans Nilsen
and Bud Robertson, ends; Nell Gio
vanni, guard; and Cliff Morris, tac
kle. The remainder of the starting
line-up will be Farrar, center; Ama
to, guard, and Captain Del Bjork,
tackle.
