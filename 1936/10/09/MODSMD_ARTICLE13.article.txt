# Program Changes Due by October 13
## 
### 
Five o'clock Tuesday afternoon,
October 13, is the deadline for
changing study-list cards. All study
cards must be filed at the informa
tion window of the Registrar's office
before that time, or a fine will be
charged for each change.
After October 13, changes of pro
gram may be made only by petition
to the Registration committee. If the
permission is granted, the student
must pay the following fines: $2 for
each subject added or dropped; and
$3 if one course is substituted.
Each student is held responsible
for his official study-list card which
is on file at the Registrar's office.
No credit will be for a course, either
in the academic or the Physical Edu
cation department.
