# INDIANS PLAN PASS ATTACK FOR TOUGH WEBFOOT DEFENSE
## Webfeet Put Up Staunch Three – quarter Stand Against Troy's Power 
### HERB DIAMOND 
How good is Tiny Thornhill's grid
squad this season?
In the form of some determined
Webfeet a shiny golden opportunity
to answer this much-debated query
comes to the Farm tomorrow after
| noon. At 2:30 o'clock Coach Prink
I Callison's fighting Oregonians, who
! put up a really brilliant defense for
[ three quarters against the power and
! reserve strength of Troy last week-
I end, will be on hand to battle it out
| with the Indians.
Confidential reports from Eugene
indicate that the Oregon defense has
[ lost none of its potency since last
i Saturday and, in addition to that, a
pretty fair offense has been built
around one Tom Blackman, who will
probably start at full. Blackmail's
pass-tossing and punting ability are

said to be rare and wonderful things
indeed, and Callison seems to be de
pending on Tom to make things
tough for the Cardinals.
Blocker, Packer
No mean blocker is Arleigh Bent
ley, who is scheduled to hold down
the quarterback post. Dale Laselle,
who will start at left half, is listed
as a pretty shifty ball carrier and
one of the most improved players on
the Coast this year.
And Bob Braddock, the gent who
led the Webfeet in ground-gaining
last season, will round out the back
field at right halfback. On the line
will be a pair of very able tackles
named Del Bjork and Ken Skinner.
Biork captains the Oregonians this
season after two brilliant seasons;
last year he was accorded all-Coast
mention, while the other half of
Callison's quarter-ton tackle combi
nation is almost on a par with Bjork.
Hamilton Hurt
In preparing to face all this oppos
ing talent, Thornhill has been hard
pressed by injuries and lack of good
reserve material. Last night came
the word that big Fullback Glenn
Hamilton has a torn ligament which
will make it necessary for him to use
a brace when and if he returns to
practice. Dr. Fritz Roth, team phy
sician, pointed out that Hamilton
will thus be of little use to the In
dians for the rest of the season.
With Hamilton ha sgone whatever
punting prowess the squad had. For
none of the present first string back
fielders are better than fair kickers.
However, such subs as Hands Cal
velli, fullback; Roger Munger, end;
and Wally DeWitt, ccnter, have been
showing up in a manner that should !
partly compensate for Tiny's recent :
losses.
Satchel-Mitts
Calvelli, by the way, is said to
have the largest hands ever seen on
the Farm and he has a deadly pass
ing aim. Not to be forgotten is Jack
Walton, who only returned to the j
Indians V/ednesday, and who will !
probably be in for injured Pop Grant !
at tackle. When Walton's temper is j
aroused on the gridiron, he should (
rank with the best of tackles.
True enough, Oregon teams have
never looked good against the Cardi
nals in the past, but up North they
arc some great shucks. Playing at I
home, they have lost only four games :
in the past eight years; one each to
Oregon Stale, U.C.L.A., California,
and the University of Washington.
Gotta Be Good
In the Cougar tilt, the Redskins
gained practically nothing on the j
ground, but when they turned to the
ozone they theoretically over- !
whelmed the Washingtonians. There -
has been some talk that the Cougars '
lacked defensive strength, at least j
wherein passing is concerned, and it j
has also been pointed out that Ore- J
gon will have an effective pass de- !
fense.
So if the Indians pass through the j
Webfeet they will prove a lot of 1
prowess, and that's exactly what ■
ihev should do tomorrow.
