# Farm 'Blind Date' Bureau Proposed
## 
### 
A "blind date" bureau will be
formed on the Stanford campus if

to Jean Frank, instigator of the idea.
Proven successful on other campi,
including Cal, the bureau, it is felt,
will lill a definite need at Stanford.
At tl.e present time, student lead
ers are being questioned concerning
the probabl" success of the plan and
if general approval is voiced it will
go before F.x Committee soon.
