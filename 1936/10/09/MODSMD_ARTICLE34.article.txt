"THE BIG GAME" AND STUFF
Reports from San Francisco, where
"The Big Game" is showing, indicate
that even with a whole herd of gen
uine football players tearing up the
turf for their 50 bucks a day, the
movie is still right in line with the
ancient and glorious tradition con
cerning pigskin operas.
That is, the campus is lousy with
chorus girls strutting about heavily
mascaraed at high noon and the
whole school—instead of just Jim
Reynolds and a couple of thousand
other guys as it is around here—lives
and breathes and eats athletics along
with its dish of Wheaties every
morning.
There is also, I am told, the usual
predicament of the big star missing,
as usual, just at the game time, with
a mad scramble to get him onto the
field just in time to score the win
ning touchdown by eluding eleven
i opponents who had jolly well better
miss tackling him or else the scene
will have to be shot over.

It is fortunate indeed that the boys
who think up the football scenarios
have seen fit to do as their fathers
did. It means that we may expect no
sudden changes in the other brands
of stock stories. Foreign Legion plots
will be as always before with the
Legion spending all its time march
ing out into the desert to capture
seme piece of rock nobody ever
cared about anyway, getting all shot
to pieces by the Arabs and then
marching back to headquarters
again where the survivors can take
up moping about their past where
they left off before.
The only horrible thought occur
ring here is that with "The Big
Game" strictly according to the
grand old formula, there might be
a general retrogression all over
Hollywood. According to the fan
I magazines, the new technique in
love-making just developed by Hol
lywood—as if they invented any
thing along this line that everybody
didn't know already—is to do all the
dirty work with the eyes. Now that
such an epochal, pace-setting movie
as '"The Big Game" has come out in
favor of the good old stuff, the final
clinches in all pictures may be as
before, two people biting each other's
faces off.

The news of "The Big Game"
should be comforting generally, for
it means (hat Mr. Hearst can keep
his attention on Russia and not
worry about another basic American
principle being trampled underfoot.
After all, if Hollywood were to do
something different in these troubled
times, there might be such unspeak
able confusion throughout the land

that possibly Franklin Delano Rnoao
velt might sneak one over on Mr.
Hearst and ship in a whole army of
red communists straight from Mos
cow to really ruin this country for
good. —Curtis Prendergast
