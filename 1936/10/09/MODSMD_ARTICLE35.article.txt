# Roble for Rooseveltâ€”Parental Influence Not for Frosh Women
## F.D.R.'s Personal Appeal Turns Hall Democrat 
### JEAN KELLY 
Not because of his political knowl
edge, not because of his experience,
and not because of his four-year
record is Roble planning to support
Franklin D. Roosevelt when the cam
paign invades the Farm.
Roosevelt, think the Robleites, has
appeal.
His clothes, bis voice, his aristoc
racy will swing the election if the
frosh women have their way. Encina
men favored Landon because, they
said, their fathers did. But Roble
women, independent and charmed
by a persuasive manner, plan to
climb the New Deal bandwagon.
And here's why:
"Wonderful Smile"
Says Jean Bolton, "He has a great
er universal appeal than Landon.
His smile is wonderful, his voice
convincing, and did you ever notice
his dimples?"
"I like him for many reasons,"
agrees Helen Isaacs, "but I think
foremost because of his clothes. They
have that look of Bond Street, which
coupled with a good tailor, is irre
sislaule."
Fireside Talk Fan
A fireside talk fan is Jean Webb,
who requests that voters "listen to
that flat nasal twang of Landon's,
then have the pleasure of hearing
Roosevelt's melodious tones."
"Every movement proclaims the
fact that he is a gentleman." remarks
Betty Winstead. "I know that's not
what runs a country but it helps
loads. Think of foreign'impressions
and other social aspects which do
help our international relations."
Lauds Accomplishments
"My family are Republicans," ac
cording to Marion Steinlein, "but if
I could only vote, he would be my
choice. His wonderful accomplish
ments toward alleviating unemploy
ment and bad social conditions
should also re-elect him," she added
practically.
"What has Landon got that Roose
velt hasn't got?" query the frosh
women. "Why should we oust F.D.R.
without giving him a chance to fin
ish what he has started? Perhaps
Landon is less of a professional poli
tician, which might account for his
lack of ability to put over his ideas.
But Roosevelt puts his over by sheer
force of personality. If I were of
age, he would certainly get my vote."
Their final argument, addressed to
Encina, consisted of the unanswer
able query, "Who wants to marry an
average man?"

"Every movement proclaims the
fact that he is a gentleman." remarks
Betty Winstead. "I know that's not
what runs a country but it helps
loads. Think of foreign'impressions
and other social aspects which do
help our international relations."
Lauds Accomplishments
"My family are Republicans," ac
cording to Marion Steinlein, "but if
I could only vote, he would be my
choice. His wonderful accomplish
ments toward alleviating unemploy
ment and bad social conditions
should also re-elect him," she added
practically.
"What has Landon got that Roose
velt hasn't got?" query the frosh
women. "Why should we oust F.D.R.
without giving him a chance to fin
ish what he has started? Perhaps
Landon is less of a professional poli
tician, which might account for his
lack of ability to put over his ideas.
But Roosevelt puts his over by sheer
force of personality. If I were of
age, he would certainly get my vote."
Their final argument, addressed to
Encina, consisted of the unanswer
able query, "Who wants to marry an
average man?"
Not because of his political knowl
edge, not because of his experience,
and not because of his four-year
record is Roble planning to support
Franklin D. Roosevelt when the cam
paign invades the Farm.
Roosevelt, think the Robleites, has
appeal.
His clothes, bis voice, his aristoc
racy will swing the election if the
frosh women have their way. Encina
men favored Landon because, they
said, their fathers did. But Roble
women, independent and charmed
by a persuasive manner, plan to
climb the New Deal bandwagon.
And here's why:
"Wonderful Smile"
Says Jean Bolton, "He has a great
er universal appeal than Landon.
His smile is wonderful, his voice
convincing, and did you ever notice
his dimples?"
"I like him for many reasons,"
agrees Helen Isaacs, "but I think
foremost because of his clothes. They
have that look of Bond Street, which
coupled with a good tailor, is irre
sislaule."
Fireside Talk Fan
A fireside talk fan is Jean Webb,
who requests that voters "listen to
that flat nasal twang of Landon's,
then have the pleasure of hearing
Roosevelt's melodious tones."
