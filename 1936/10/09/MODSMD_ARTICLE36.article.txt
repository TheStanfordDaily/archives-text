### FRANCES SLATER 
MrElyca, who cuts a familiar and
sartorially correct figure as Phelps
Terkel fashion mentor, will lay you
five to one that he can make a per
fect slouch out of you for twenty
fiat.
The idea here, of course, is not to
look as much like a coal heaver in
the steel mills as possible, but to be
able to wear those loose, casual,
comfortable clothes with aplomb.
For those hatless, tie-less, coatless
confirmed Quad-ites, Mr. McElyea
and staff have assembled the follow
ing items:
1. A chocolate - brown, open
throated "Gooper Feather" shirt,

made of a washable silk and wool
mixture similar to challis clotlf.
2. A pair of individually, Terkel
tailored lancer twill pants in tan, or
a pair of sage-brush green gabar
dine.
3. Russian calf brown brogues
and a scarf, from their colorful ag
gregate, blocked in one of the new
paisley patterns.
For Dinner—For Dancing—Mary
Elizabeth Shop has a bewitching,
white taffeta, very decollette both
back and front, with yards and yards
of opera bouffant skirt whose wicked
swing is repressed only by a wide
velvet hem-band, shaded from deep
sapphire to ice-blue.
It has a small jacket, which you
peel off on gala evenings.
Zwierlein Peri-Cure. Joan Craw
ford once remarked. "You can say
your foot hurts and it sounds all
right . . . but when you say your
feet hurt it sounds lousy."
Stanford women, however, mince
no words when it comes to describ
ing the state of their pedal extremi
ties in the process of breaking in a
pair of hard-boiled new oxfords.
Well, Mr. Zwierlein of Walkover
has a solution. It's a sandal—now,
don't balk—because although' it is
air-cooled by aesthetic perforations,
although it is a very attractive suede
shoe with a built-up cuban heel—in
spite of all its comfort, this sandal
has GOOD arch support. It takes
you in hand firmly, and oh so-o-o
gently.
W r hieh reminds us: You probably
need some new hose at this stage in
the game Well Sue Berry Salon is
tainers; if your skin isn't taut and
dry from over-exposure, and the
ley collection of'jars, bottles, tubes,
and sundry other cosmetic con

closing out dozens of pairs of hose— j
all colors, all weights, and all sizes. I
They are selling now at COST. In
, case you're skeptical, the Berry i
Salon is discontinuing this fall line 1
because sizes didn't run long enough {
I for very large women . . .and that !
I certainly doesn't apply to you.
And they'll prove it to you, too!
j If your shelf isn't laden with a mot- ;
I high chlorine content in the water, .
cross your fingers and don't read;
this.
If, on the other hand, you are look
ing for just ONE cream that will
CLEANSE, LUBRICATE, and
NOURISH your skin, try ihe Mad
ame Palja Vitalizer at Roos Bros.
Beauty Parlor. And if you phone ;
| early enough, Mrs. Walker will see ,
I to it that you have a free facial !
' proving its merits.
For the Horsey set —Thoit's Flor
sheim have a riding boot that will
i grow old gracefully and serviceably. j
| English fashioned by C. B. Slater
! and Co. (which means quality to any
| seasoned equestrian), it is smoothest
j looking in caressable, chestnut-
I brown Russian calf.
Thoit's also have an enchanting
Ming boudoir slipper—black satin,
broidered with Oriental opulence in !
metallic and scarlet threads.
Ad-Vantages: The Peacock oxford !
at Zwierlein's, narrow-heeled, piped
I across the vamp in kid, and fash- '
ioned of a misty purple swede, called j
Aubergine—a shade that is keyed .
perfectly to that dusky, twilight |
range from Hyacinth-blue to opaque j
Cyclamen . . . Mary Elizabeth's j
saffron crepe dinner dress, draped at
the bodice, and stencillcd with a
delicate tracery of silver embroidery i
. . . and her Scotch plaid tunic, with
its starched clerical collar, impec
cable, stiff and proper as Doctor
Wilbur's . . . Phelps-Terkel's gray
gabardine trench-coat, cut like an
authentic army mackintosh, with
plenty of capacious pockets, and a
sturdy plaid lining . . . the new;
Contoure terra-cotta make-up at I
Roos Bros. Beauty Parlor, a color
that has an impartial affinity for i
dark, fair, or indifferent complexions
. . . Thoit's sangora "bobbie" sox,
anchored at the ankles with elastic,
so that they keep their brevity with
out disappearing into a nadir at |
your heels . . . the Sue Berry
sweaters—one, a spruce green do
mestic wool, ribbed at infrequent in
tervals; fastened down the front
with conical, little brown buttons in
single file, and gird at the waist
with a rust-colored plaited belt.
