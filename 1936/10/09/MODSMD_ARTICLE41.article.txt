# Buck Opens Current Events Course With Talk on Presidential Campaign
## 
### 
"Both parties' promises are so
fundamentally alike, the choice be
tween Roosevelt and Landon will
have to rest on your own impres
sions of what they will do if they
get elected," Philip W. Buck, assist
ant professor of political science, told
a capacity crowd yesterday as the
social science department's new
"Current Events" course got under
way.
"Both the Republican and Demo
cratic parties are aiming for the vote
of the 1934 borderline states—the Far
West, the Middle West, and New
England," Buck told the huge class.
"And the promises they make
amount up to the same thing."
Economic Security Bait
Agricultural benefits are offered
farmers of the Great Plains, eco
nomic security serves as bait for the
industrial Northwest, but "nobody
knows what the Pacific Coast
wants," declared the professor.
"Party strategy this year is re
versed from the usual. The Repub
licans must take over new votes
while the Democrats must contrive
to hold the votes they already have,"
explained Buck.
Landon Selling Landon
Party position in the public eye is

quite different. Roosevelt is attempt
ing to sell America the Democratic
party, but the Republican party
must sell Alf Landon to America.
Buck declared that little faith can
be placed in the several national
"straw votes." Each, he said, shows
different results which makes doubt
ful the validity of any of them.
Buck's speech, first of a series of
weekly talks by outstanding faculty
members, covered the "Strategy of
the Presidential Campaign." Max
well H. Savelle, associate professor
of history, will next Thursday speak
on the Spanish rebellion. He viewed
it first hand this summer.
