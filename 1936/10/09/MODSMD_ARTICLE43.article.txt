# Chlorinating Water Destined To Stay: Roth
## Spiritual Side of Stanford Told by Dr. Reynolds; Hall Sparsely Filled 
### 
Though chlorine may be tempo
rarily removed from campus water
in the near future, the long-range
trend will be toward chlorination,
Comptroller Almon E. Roth told yes
terday morning's student assembly.
The drop in water level in deep
wells has been temporarily stayed
by the last two winters, and for a
short time chlorine may be with
drawn if the bacterial content falls
below the danger point.
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, president
of Stanford Associates, explained the
spiritual side of Stanford's history.
He stressed the heritage passed on
from the struggles of the founders
to present-day struggles of hard
working students, who do such
things as work eight hours a day
spinning cables on the Bay bridge in
order to earn money to go to Stan
ford, and the sportsmanlike strug
gles of Stanford teams.
The 20 - odd campus brass - hats
who lined the platform were intro
duced by A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds, and were cheated of their
full applause from the sparsely filled
Assembly Hall v/hen they proved
themselves less experienced at bow
ing than they did at being student
leaders.
