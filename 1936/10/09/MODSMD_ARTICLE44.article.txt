## Sixty Players Turn Out For Mallet-Wielding 
### 
Action will be the dominant note
on Head Horse Polo Coach Grubbs'
squad of 60 horsemen this season.
According to Captain Grubbs,
there will be a game of some sort
every Friday afternoon, beginning
October 16, involving either inter
squad contests, or encounters with
several of the private club teams
along the Peninsula,
However, the sole definitely sched
uled game is that with the University
of Arizona, slated to come off at
Tucson during the Thanksgiving
holidays.
Large Turnout
Approximately 60 men have
turned out for the Stanford squad,
necessitating a three-fold division
into Teams A, B, and C. Coach
Grubbs will select his competitive
intercollegiate aggregation from the
20 members of Team A.
Practice is being held tri-weekly.
To date, the four who are riding
in first-string berths are the two
Fullerton brothers, Dirby, and Ras
mussen, all of whom rode regularly
for last year's quartet.
Strong Seconds
However, a second-string outfit,
paced by A1 Fleming, a veteran of
the 1934 campaign, and filled out
with Gene McAuslin, McLintock,
and either Bert Hyde or Hoenigs
berg, will press the first - string
bunch hard.
The firsts and seconds of team A
will inaugurate the season October
16 in an intcrsquad battle.
Charles Thomas has been ap
pointed Senior Manager.
