# Reynolds Plans Train for Bruin Game October 31
## 
### 
Plans for a "Stanford Special"
train to the U.C.L.A. game in
Los Angeles the week-end of
October 31 are being made by
A.S.S.U. President Jim Rey
nolds.
The special — complete with
observation, diner, and •dancing
car—will leave Palo Alto Fri
day night, October .'!0, and re
turn early Monday morning,
November 1. Low rates, to be
announced definitely later, will
probably approximate those for
last year's special to the U.S.C.
game.
