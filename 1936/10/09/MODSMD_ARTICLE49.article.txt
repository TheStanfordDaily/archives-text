### 
Lectures and demonstrations on
the safe handling for target use of
automatic pistols, revolvers, and
rifles were given at the first meeting
of the Stanford Rifle and Pistol Club
Wednesday evening in the Rifle
Range by President Jim Culver and
Secretary Bob Kahn.
A short business session was held
at 7:30 o'clock in the lobby of the
Administration Building to acquaint
new members with aims, purposes,
and privileges of the organization.
From there the club adjourned to the
rifle range, where safety rules were
explained, and target practicing took
place.
