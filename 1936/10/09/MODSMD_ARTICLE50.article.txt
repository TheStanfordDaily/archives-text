# Director Lange Makes Choices For 'Roadside'
## Trio Set As Possibilities For Feminine Leads; Seek Small Gag-man 
### 
Of those who have had interviews
with Dramatic Director Gordon
Lange for parts in "Roadside," Kay
Arthur, Amelia Baines, and Gerald
ine Schreiber are definitely under
consideration for the feminine lead
role.
Mr. Lange is now looking for a
man of small stature who can play a
comedy role. He also wishes it an
nounced that he is chiefly interested
in those who have had speech train
ing.
Tryouts Continue
Tryouts will continue this after
noon in the Little Theater beginning
at 1 :.)0 o'clock. A list of those whom
he wants to come out will be posted
on the door of Mr. Lange's office this
morning.
While the tryouts for the last two
days have taken the form of inter
views, those of this afternoon will
lake the form of readings of the play,
with different experimental pairings
of people.
More the Merrier
Since so many students with act
ing ability have tried out for parts,
and there are so few roles open in a
single play, Mr. Lange believes that
more than one play should be given
each quarter.
These plays could be given on the
studio production plan, using only
props find not scenery if necessary,
and utilizing student direction. This
would give all students of ability an
opportunity to appear in at least one
production. "If we are going to have
any sort oi a dramatic school, we will
have to follow this plan," Mr. Lange
stated.
Staff lessons in drill and physical
culture are given by every factory
in Germany.

California's varsity nine, in the
midst of a losing streak, abandoned
their new black and white socks, and
whipped Stanford in their next game.

In all fairness to the Republican
National Convention, it must be said
that it could have been much
worse.â€”Heywood Broun
