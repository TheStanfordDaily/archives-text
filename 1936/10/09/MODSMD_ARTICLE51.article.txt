# Frosh Turnout Causes Double Hoop Workouts
## Tallest Tryoutee Of Card Cage History Appears at Practice 
### 
With a squad so large that it must
be broken up into two outfits, one
practicing from 4:00 to 5:00 and the
other from 5 to 6 Mondays, Wed
nesdays, and Fridays, the freshman
basketball team h;us started its sea
son during the past week with work
on fundamentals.
The largest man ever to turn out
for any basketball team at Stanford,
either varsity or freshman, has been
one of the 14 or 15 fellows who have
been showing signs of promise in
workouts. Tom Seibert, a New York
boy six feet six inches tall and
weighing in the neighborhood of
225 pounds is one reason why
Coach Wytze Goiter looks forward
to a fairly good season in his first
season as coach of the frosh. He
shows promise, thinks Gorter, of
someday being a real basketball
player around here.
Lew Staehle and Ted Lyon, a pair
of teammates from Piedmont High,
have been working together in prac
tice and, according to Coach Wytze,
look pretty fair. Lyon is a brother
of Dick Lyon, now on the varsity and
a member of the frosh team of 1934,
Luisetti's team. He was out of school
last year, touring the world, but he
returned this year with an idea to
making the varsity.
Epstein, from Illinois; George An
derson, 6 feet three inches and 215
pounds worth from Arizona; Bur
rows Anderson, of Bellingham,
Washington; Leon Lafaille, All-City
player from Oakland last year; and
Bob Moulton, Los Angeles lad, are
a few of the bright lights.
Scrimmages are being held each
Friday, as the team takes its time
getting into shape. First tilts will be
the three-game series with the var
sity scheduled for sometime after the
close of frosh football season in mid-
November.
