### 
Fifteen new members were ad
mitted into the Stanford Flying Club
at a meeting held last night at their
Palo Alto Airport headquarters.
Eight or ten more positions are open
for interested students until the club
limit of 45 has been reached.
The officers, President Walt Rosen
field, Vice-President John Parke,
Secretary Yvonne Beattie, together
with last year's returning members,
welcomed the newcomers to their
first meeting. The club has ruled
that each member must take at least
six hours of instruction from the
Associated Flying Service, in addi
tion to the club dues of a dollar for
the school year.
