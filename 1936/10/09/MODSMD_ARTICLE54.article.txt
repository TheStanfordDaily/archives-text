# Card-Oregon Tilt First Since '29; Farm Unbeaten in Series
## Webfeet Habitually Wilt In Second Half Play 
### 
When Oregon and Stanford clash
on the gridiron tomorrow, it will be
the first time since 1929. The two
teams first m#?t in 1900. Oregon has
never won a football game from
Stanford.
Since the World War, the Indians
have never hud too much trouble
subduing the men from the north.
In yll games, without exception, the
Webfeet have given Stanford a good
battle for one half, but have wilted
in the second.
In the 1928 clash at Eugene, one
of the fastest touchdowns in the
annals of football was scored when
Kitzmiller recovered Frank Wilton's
fumble of the opening kick-off in
the end zone to score for the Ducks.
In all, the touchdown was scored in
less than ten seconds.
In 1929 Oregon scored first nearly
as quickly as the previous year,
when they completed a long pass
over the Stanford safety on about
the fifth play of the game.
However, on both occasions, the
Cards, then under Pop Warner's tu
telage, turned on power and decep
tion to defeat the northerners han
dily. Following is a resume of games
played since 1923:
1923—Stanford 14, Oregon 3.
1924—Stanford 28, Oregon 13.
1925—Stanford 35, Oregon 13.
1926 —Stanford 29, Oregon 12.
1927 —Stanford 19, Oregon 0.
1928 —Stanford 26, Oregon 12.
1929 —Stanford 33, Oregon 7.
