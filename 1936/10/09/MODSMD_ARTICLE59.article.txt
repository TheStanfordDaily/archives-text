# Hoopmen Open Year with Fast Practice Work
## Bunn Fearful of Set-up As Cage Squad Rips Through Rapid Start 
### 
"Too good," says Coach John
Bunn, when he speaks of the way
the basketball squad looks and the
way it worked in practice both Tues
day and yesterday afternoons.
Leery of the ease and speed with
which the team has been handling
itself so early in the season, since
only three workouts have been held,
Bunn is afraid that the team might
suffer a big let-down a little later on.
However, the conditioning of the
squad is nothing to rave about, with
only one or two men in shape to
stand more than five minutes with
out wanting to stop and take a
blow. Captain Dinty Moore is in
the best shape of all, carrying about
175 pounds and set right now to
waltz around with the best of compe
tition. Bunn predicts a great year
for the rilgged leader.
Hank Luisetti is quite a little over
his playing weight of last year, but
according to Bunn the extra burden
doesn't slow him down a bit.
