# Shipkey Crew Wary of Black Foxe Gridders
## Three Quarterbacks May Prove Too Foxy For Papooses Tomorrow 
### BY TIM SULLIVAN 
Sparkplugged by three clever
quarterbacks, the Black Foxe Mili
tary Academy football team will ar
rive today to make final plans for
their prospective conquest of the
Stanford Frosh. The two teams will
raise the curtain on the varsity-Ore
gon game beginning at noon tomor
row.
Foxiest of the "Black Foxes" are
the three aforementioned signal
barkers. This trio consists of Russ
Chesley, Bob Clifford, and "Little
Jim" Little. These boys will put their
heads together in an effort to out
smart Chief Harry Shipkey's inno
cent little Indian Papooses.
Able Grid Gang
The strategy department should
not find it too difficult to carry their
plans into execution as they are
backed up by a group of gridders
who are possessed of a thorough
knowledge of football technique —
plus the ability to apply it effectively
against their opponents.
For instance, whenever yardage is
needed through the line the south
erners' field general can call on Full
back Jack Banta to smash through
the foes' forward wall. Jack is a 185-
pounder and is skilled in the fine arts
of punting and passing as well as the
more crude (although equally ef- 1
fective) practice of line plunging.
Another source of Black Foxe
power is the 190-pound line which
protects the frail constitutions of
155-pound Little Jim Little and his
less robust running mates. Main
springs in the cadets' first defense
front are Frank Bennett, Woody
Dempsey, Johnny Stonebraker, and
Everett Hale.
Fine Defensive Record
For those who are inclined to be
over-optimistic about Frosh chances
of running rampant over the invad
ing eleven, it would be advisable to
cite the Black Foxe season record.
They have been unscored on in two
games and have allowed opposing
teams to make just one first down
against them.
In view of these facts, it is not
startling when the usually ultra
optimistic Mr. Harry Shipkey, coach
and chief publicity agent of the
Stanford freshman football associa
tion, comes out with the following
semi-pessimistic statement: "If we
beat Black Foxe we will still be
lucky," says Mr. Shipkey, not for
getting the instrumental part that
Old Lady Good Fortune played in
helping his proteges to trounce the
U.S.C. yearlings last week.
Parker Leads Team
While the cadet crew will be fa
vored, the Frosh are not going onto
the field with notions of utter de
spair—far from it. Fired to new
heights in practice by Rod Parker,
fullback "find," they intend to
transport some of that spark to the
grid tomorrow and burn down the
heretofore impregnable Black Foxe
defense.
Men who have drawn starting jobs
for the Frosh include: Galarneau and
Willard, ends; Young and Anderson,
tackles; Damarus and Juney, guards;
Radke, center; Coldiron, quarter
back; Reade and Walker, halfbacks;
and Parker, fullback.
To date the Frosh are undefeated.
Tomorrow they will begin to pray.
