GRAYSON—FULLBACK,
GENTLEMAN, ORATOR
Bobby Grayson was over the other
night and gave us a talk on football
in general. Bobby, you know, is an
old debater and seasoned speaker;
I know of no one, barring none, that
has better poise and a more interest
ing line from the platform.
He says that our gridders are in a
kind of crisis now —they have a tre
mendous standing and reputation,
gained over the past three years, to
uphold, and that this vex-y thing
hanging over their heads makes them
wary, cautious, uncertain.
The thing for us to do, says Gray
son, is to come out to practice, yell at
games, and on the street pat them on
the back, urge 'em along, let them
know the deep respect we have for
their ball playing, come win, lose, or
draw. Generally get their minds off
worrying about the task ahead of
them.
BETWEEN THE
HALVES AT PULLMAN
The thing Tiny has done was done
between the halves at Pullman. lie
got the boys into a caucus and told
them that with our material we can't
afford to be a conservative ball club.
We've got to take chances, big ones,
and play a lot of crazy football in
order to win.
Right after this talk, Grayson said
he saw the greatest football come
back of his experience. Against in
numerable bad breaks, the boys came
back even stronger. Twice during
the game it was first and 25, and both
times they made a first down in one
play.
At the very end, he says they were
I set up for a deep pass to the right,

but couldn't waste the time, so Luck
ett tried his place-kick from scrim
mage on the 32, actually on the 40.
The wind blew it to one side, but the
altitude was such that it would have
been good 10 yards longer. After the
touchback the Cougars ran three
plays.
Grayson is a member of the BKU
(Brigham's Knee Up) club.
INJURIES CONSIDERED
lIOW DO WE STAND?
Now for a look ahead. Oregon is
this week, a blank next, and then
U.S.C. here. With Paulman and Ham
ilton out of the fullback ranks
(Ham's knee is a recurrence of a
spring practice injury, and looks to
keep him out quite some time) they
have moved in Hands Calvelli,
former center who played half at
San Mateo J.C.
Calvelli is said to be a very tough
guy straight ahead, and passes like a
demon. Wrapping his hand clear
around the ball, he can outthrow
Zagar, the former team champ, by
10 yards. His kicking is punk,
though, and Turn Collins will prob
ably play right half when Hands is in
there.
Vigna, Hoos, and Coffis (pro
nounced cough-us this season) are
in fine form, and will team with
Brigham, Calvelli, or Williams in
ball carrying tomorrow. Williams
may be the day's hero, or his weak
knee may hold him out altogether.
The line, though badly battered
from last week, man and man is in
better form than ever, with two ex
ceptions. Grant, after playing the
best game of his life in Pullman, is
i still on the injured list, but stands a
[ good chance of being taped up and

ready for U.S.C.
Dakan. reserve end, is still weak
from the flu, but has been replaced
by Rog Munger, who has taken ad
vantage of the chance to show some
play that smells of first string ability.
Walton, declared eligible yester
day, will go in Grant's tackle hole,
better equipped, at 210 pounds, to
play ball than ever before, but with
his gagline stiil an unknown quan
tity, and his grid play dependent on
his frame of mind.
Pretty soon this loss to injuries
situation will become funny.
MORRIS AND DANA,
DANA AND MORRIS
Grayson says Stanford will re
quest Dana not to send Bobby Mor
ris down here to ref the Troy game,
and Dana says he will either ding or
clear Morris right away quick, de
pending on the evidence Stanford
will furnish.
I don't think he will.

INJURIES CONSIDERED
lIOW DO WE STAND?
Now for a look ahead. Oregon is
this week, a blank next, and then
U.S.C. here. With Paulman and Ham
ilton out of the fullback ranks
(Ham's knee is a recurrence of a
spring practice injury, and looks to
keep him out quite some time) they
have moved in Hands Calvelli,
former center who played half at
San Mateo J.C.
Calvelli is said to be a very tough
guy straight ahead, and passes like a
demon. Wrapping his hand clear
around the ball, he can outthrow
Zagar, the former team champ, by
10 yards. His kicking is punk,
though, and Turn Collins will prob
ably play right half when Hands is in
there.
Vigna, Hoos, and Coffis (pro
nounced cough-us this season) are
in fine form, and will team with
Brigham, Calvelli, or Williams in
ball carrying tomorrow. Williams
may be the day's hero, or his weak
knee may hold him out altogether.
The line, though badly battered
from last week, man and man is in
better form than ever, with two ex
ceptions. Grant, after playing the
best game of his life in Pullman, is
i still on the injured list, but stands a
[ good chance of being taped up and

ready for U.S.C.
Dakan. reserve end, is still weak
from the flu, but has been replaced
by Rog Munger, who has taken ad
vantage of the chance to show some
play that smells of first string ability.
Walton, declared eligible yester
day, will go in Grant's tackle hole,
better equipped, at 210 pounds, to
play ball than ever before, but with
his gagline stiil an unknown quan
tity, and his grid play dependent on
his frame of mind.
Pretty soon this loss to injuries
situation will become funny.

Bobby Grayson was over the other
night and gave us a talk on football
in general. Bobby, you know, is an
old debater and seasoned speaker;
I know of no one, barring none, that
has better poise and a more interest
ing line from the platform.
He says that our gridders are in a
kind of crisis now —they have a tre
mendous standing and reputation,
gained over the past three years, to
uphold, and that this vex-y thing
hanging over their heads makes them
wary, cautious, uncertain.
The thing for us to do, says Gray
son, is to come out to practice, yell at
games, and on the street pat them on
the back, urge 'em along, let them
know the deep respect we have for
their ball playing, come win, lose, or
draw. Generally get their minds off

them.

The line, though badly battered
from last week, man and man is in
better form than ever, with two ex
ceptions. Grant, after playing the
best game of his life in Pullman, is
i still on the injured list, but stands a
[ good chance of being taped up and

ready for U.S.C.
Dakan. reserve end, is still weak
from the flu, but has been replaced
by Rog Munger, who has taken ad
vantage of the chance to show some
play that smells of first string ability.
Walton, declared eligible yester
day, will go in Grant's tackle hole,
better equipped, at 210 pounds, to
play ball than ever before, but with
his gagline stiil an unknown quan
tity, and his grid play dependent on
his frame of mind.
Pretty soon this loss to injuries
situation will become funny.
MORRIS AND DANA,
DANA AND MORRIS
Grayson says Stanford will re

clear Morris right away quick, de

will furnish.
I don't think he will.

GRAYSON—FULLBACK,
GENTLEMAN, ORATOR
Bobby Grayson was over the other
night and gave us a talk on football
in general. Bobby, you know, is an
old debater and seasoned speaker;
I know of no one, barring none, that
has better poise and a more interest
ing line from the platform.
He says that our gridders are in a
kind of crisis now —they have a tre
mendous standing and reputation,
gained over the past three years, to
uphold, and that this vex-y thing
hanging over their heads makes them
wary, cautious, uncertain.
The thing for us to do, says Gray
son, is to come out to practice, yell at
games, and on the street pat them on
the back, urge 'em along, let them
know the deep respect we have for
their ball playing, come win, lose, or
draw. Generally get their minds off
worrying about the task ahead of
them.
BETWEEN THE
HALVES AT PULLMAN
The thing Tiny has done was done
between the halves at Pullman. lie
got the boys into a caucus and told
them that with our material we can't
afford to be a conservative ball club.
We've got to take chances, big ones,
and play a lot of crazy football in
order to win.
Right after this talk, Grayson said
he saw the greatest football come
back of his experience. Against in
numerable bad breaks, the boys came
back even stronger. Twice during
the game it was first and 25, and both
times they made a first down in one
play.
At the very end, he says they were
I set up for a deep pass to the right,

but couldn't waste the time, so Luck
ett tried his place-kick from scrim
mage on the 32, actually on the 40.
The wind blew it to one side, but the
altitude was such that it would have
been good 10 yards longer. After the
touchback the Cougars ran three
plays.
Grayson is a member of the BKU
(Brigham's Knee Up) club.
INJURIES CONSIDERED
lIOW DO WE STAND?
Now for a look ahead. Oregon is
this week, a blank next, and then
U.S.C. here. With Paulman and Ham
ilton out of the fullback ranks
(Ham's knee is a recurrence of a
spring practice injury, and looks to
keep him out quite some time) they
have moved in Hands Calvelli,
former center who played half at
San Mateo J.C.
Calvelli is said to be a very tough
guy straight ahead, and passes like a
demon. Wrapping his hand clear
around the ball, he can outthrow
Zagar, the former team champ, by
10 yards. His kicking is punk,
though, and Turn Collins will prob
ably play right half when Hands is in
there.
Vigna, Hoos, and Coffis (pro
nounced cough-us this season) are
in fine form, and will team with
Brigham, Calvelli, or Williams in
ball carrying tomorrow. Williams
may be the day's hero, or his weak
knee may hold him out altogether.
The line, though badly battered
from last week, man and man is in
better form than ever, with two ex
ceptions. Grant, after playing the
best game of his life in Pullman, is

play ball than ever before, but with
his gagline stiil an unknown quan

his frame of mind.
