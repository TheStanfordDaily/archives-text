# Frosh Cinder Outlook Good, Says Ellington
## First Year Track Squad Small; All Events Filled Except Shotput, Discus 
### 
"Best looking bunch of prospects
we've had here in a long, long
while," is the way Assistant Track
Coach Bill Ellington sums up the
Frosh outlook.
The first-year cindermen, who be
gan their long practice grind last
Monday afternoon, boast of a small
select squad, there being but 26 on
the roster as it stands to date.
Team Small
Nevertheless, although the team is
uncomfortably small, there is no con
centration of men in any one event,
thus leaving no event unfilled, with
the exception of the shot and discus.
The two weight openings, how
ever, are confidently expected to be
taken care of as soon as Coach Harry
Shipkey has finished putting the
Frosh gridders through their races.
