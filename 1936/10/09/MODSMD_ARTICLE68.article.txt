# Four Farm Fish To Flash Through Chronicle Cold-Water Clash in City
## 
### Gene Gear 
Coach Nort Thornton's four little '
pollywogs are all set to splash their '
way through a mile of cold San
Francisco water Sunday in the
Chronicle swim at Aquatic Park.
Dave Rider, Harold Wratherbe,
Don Peterson, and Bob Walker have
all turned in their applications for
the gruelling test, with Rider being
rated as one of the two favorites for j
this year's crown.
According to the dojjesters, Rider
and Dick Keating of the Olympic
Club should fight it out for the win.
Rider came into national prominence
a few months ago when he defeated
such aces as Medica of Seattle and
Macionis of Yale. On the other hand,
Keating has been rightfully dubbed
"Richard the Conqueror." The husky
S.F. lad has never seen the foam of
an opponent in tiny open - water
swim.
Harold Weatherbe is a former

Golden Gate J.C. and Olympic Club
distance star who has to be reckoned
with when the top places are
counted.
Don Petersen, the old faithful of
farm aquatic circl'.: has all the light
and conditioning r. d-d to come
through and upset the favorites.
Little i,s known of Bob Walker's
distance ability. He is one of the best
backstroke artists on the Pacific-
Coast. Whether or not he will be at
home in the water l ight side up will
be answered Sunday.
