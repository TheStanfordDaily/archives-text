# Roofers' Hats Are Here to Stay
## 
### 
Some people like to dress up in funny hats
and emit peculiar noises in unison. Other
people do not. Three years ago a student poll
was taken at Stanford to decide whether card
stunts should be continued or abolished. Those
who liked to dress up in funny hats and emit J
peculiar noises in unison won by a very large j
majority.
This would tend to establish the dominance
of this characteristic in undergraduate life. Now
the Rally Committee is an embodiment of this
majority opinion. Therefore it has made the
ruling that, starting with the Oregon game to
morrow, all students must wear white shirts and
rooters' hats, and after the Oregon game ail
those who don't wear the uniform will not be
admitted to the rooting section at all. This is
a departure from previous years, when those
who didn't put on the uniform were merely
relegated to the poor seats.
There are those who say that the Rally Com
mittee cannot do this because students are
entitled to a seat if they buy their tickets.
However, there is apparently nobody to con- |
test this, and the Rally Committee has decided
it, and we all know there are few bodies of
higher importance than this body.
The reason for the Committee's stand is guite
obvious. It represents the view that we need a
rooting section. We need a rooting section that
is organized. It performs the three-fold function
ol encouraging the team, of encouraging the
rooting section, and of looking pretty to those
who have paid money for tickets on the other
side of the field.
The Rally Committee's contention is that, un
less you take drastic measures, nobody would
come in uniform. Now if nobody came in uni
form, it would indicate that nobody wanted to
come in uniform. However, this would offend
the people on the other side of the stadium, and
they would be shocked to think that a group of
Stanfordites were not like Cal and didn't want
to dress in funny hats and emit peculiar noises
in unison. Of course, the people who didn't
want to come in uniform would be happy, and
they would say that those who wanted to come
in uniform would not be allowed inside the
stadium, because it looked funny.
However, that is not the trouble apparently.
Most of the students like to dress in funny hats
and emit peculiar noises in unison. Only some
of them don't. But those who don't will have
to bow down to the will of the majority, because
the Rally Committee is afraid that the placing
of the student in a poor seat is not enough of
an incontive to make him want to buy a hat,
proceeds for which go to the support of the
Rally Committee and card stunts.
Hats are now on sale at the official hattery. |
Get yours before tomorrow's game. Proceeds j
from the sale go to the support of the Rally
Committee and card stunts.
