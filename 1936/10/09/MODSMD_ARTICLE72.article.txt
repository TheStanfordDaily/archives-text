# A 						Slick Course
## 
### 
I think that the organizing of the Current
Events Course is a good move. It will get some
students thinking about what is going on out
side cf Stanford, and it may get some pro
fessors.
To think that this organized effort, however,
will raise the general tone of the student body's
interest is a bit over-optimistic. When a pri
mary function fails, we organize a secondary
effort to attempt to meet the breakdown (I
learned this in a course somewhere).
The primary breakdown is that students have
no intelligent interest in v/hat is going on, what
is happening to the environment in which they
live. In substantiation of this, I offer the ob
servation that students buy large amounts of
the slick-paper magazines, Satevepost and Col
liers, when the organs of some intelligence that
are circulated in the Periodical Room are
thumbed over only by emeritus professors.
To fill this gap we propose to organize a
course. To stop drunkenness and debauchery

we passed a law known as the Prohibition
Amendment.
But students will continue buying the "slicks."
