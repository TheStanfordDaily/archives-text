It is a well-known fact, by now, that Mr.
William Randolph Hearst does not like Stan
ford. It is also a fact, though not so well-known,
ihat Stanford does not like Mr. Hearst.
This makes things pretty even, and very jolly
all around.
Now comes the news that, as a result of over
whelming student birding of Mr. Hearst to
Metrophony News at the Varsity, the manager
has been forced to substitute the Pathe News
for the Metrophony.
This is fine.
Let us bear in mind that last spring Hearst
tried to boycott Stanford by not mentioning
Stanford's name in his valuable papers. He
finally guit after several months of the ordinary
Hearstian's feebleness, when he found that he
couldn't get around the name of Stanford.
Now, it seems that Mr. Hearst couldn't get
along without Stanford, but Stanford can very
comfortably get along without Mr. Hearst.

Today is the last day that you will have a
chance to raise your typographically low Bawl
out average or startle inguiring students as to
the correct spelling of your name. All meaning
that proofs of the autumn quarter Bawlout will
be posted for the last time today in front of the
Administration Building for students to make
final corrections before the bulletin goes to
press.
