IF CERVANTES WERE ON REWRITE
Discounting your stereotype and mine—that Spain
is a land where ripe olives bop you on the head and
pretty senoritas kiss the wound well, the country is
more than a fictional paradise. Down through history
it has been a laboratory for the synthesis of political
struggle.
In the lGth Century, the whole western world was
muddling through a tremendous revolution—Mr. Av
erage Man against the feudal vassals. Now, in the
20th Century, the whole western world is again in the
hell of revolt, this time the Communists against the
Fascists.

Out of 16th Century Spain, courtesy of Cervantes'
genius came that much admired and never-read book,
"Don Quixote," that showed everybody just what tho
battle was all about.
He had the perfect news for his copy, for few coun
tries were as famously feudalized as Spain, and in
few countries was the "revolt" more bitter or sig
nificant. Today Spain again provides the perfect syn
thesis of a world struggle for a super-reporter, but
though the city desks of the world call for his story,
he is not writing.

The job is being done indifferently, with bias and
deliberate carelessness by an axe-grinding press. The
headlines teil merely how many thousands were killed,
the murderers are selected to fit editorial sentiment.
The motive for the murder isn't even discussed.

The slant on life that comes in some unknown
corner of a gene is the one we use in a case like Spain's.
And quite naturally, we favor the rebels. That the
rebels are Fascists, and that they represent a faction
in Spanish life that has emasculated Spain, made it
an economic eunuch in a world of increasing virility,
arc reasonings of which many of us arc almost con
genitally incapable of making.

We are still in love with the Spain of song and story,
like the Spanish grandees of three centuries past. We
don't think of the Spain high in illiteracy, low in
wealthy—high in disease, and low in the personal liber
ty most of us are trying to protect by thought whic'h
will only destroy it.

And there is no Cervantes to put us straight, to
show us the filth that lies under a luxurious Spanish
shawl, the misery that is Spain's only industrial by
product. There is no Cervantes to invent another Don
Quixote, fill him with the dreams of a beauty and a
gayety—final distillation of a real prosperity that died
with the Armada.

For the fight in Spain isn't just a hot-blooded Latin
scrap. It's the depiction of a world struggle in the
trappings of the theatre: the .story of realists versus
dreamers, that needs only the,writer to set it down.
There's world drama in the idea that now only
ghosts of cabaileros serenade the ghosts of senoritas
—that their songs were sung last 300 years ago, and
si ill linger as echoes strong enough to vie with the
cries of the starving.
