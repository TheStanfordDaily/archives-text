The Gamma Phi Betas are up in arms. Chef Wong
says this is nothing new; it is being done all the time.
But the fact remains that at this moment class struggle
is tearing apart the Gamma Phis.
The difficulty is due to the fact that one of the spir
ited Gamma Phis is getting hostessing at a quiet little
eating nook in Paly. This means that she is not pay
ing for meals at the Gamma Phi Beta house.
However, the hostess wants to drink a cup of coffee
every morning before her 8 o'clock. The administrators
of the Gamma Phi house announced their extreme will
ingness to co-operate in this regard for the sum of
$6.50 per month.
This seemd an unwarranted abridgement of the
rights of private property and the due process of law
to the spirited one, so she has smuggled in an electric
plate to her room and is serving a cut-rate breakfast
to catch and carry Gamma Phis.
The Tri-Dells have a member of the Rifle Club in
their house. (If any of you guys in the back row are
interested, the weapons she uses are pistols, not
shotguns.)
Now the Tri-Dells read about the recent robberies
and are very jumpy about burglars, so they count
upon their member of the Fiflr Club to protect them.
She takes a pistol and puts it under her pillow every
night.
Two nights ago, the whole sleeping porch heard a
burglar down stairs and woke up with alarm. The
gun moll crawled out of bed and tiptoed downstairs.
In the kitchen she sighted a white form running away
with tomorrow's leg of lamb. She took cart ful aim and
tired, mortally wounding the Frigidaire.
