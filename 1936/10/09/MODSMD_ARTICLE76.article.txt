(Continuing the letter of Ludwig
Kruppa, Stockton Asylum corre
respondent.)
By t>he agency of the federal G
men was uncovered the horrible cor
ruption morals of the San Francisco
police department that can be traced
to the incompetency or dishonesty of
the administration officials of that
city. This by me written is for those
of mankind that by true intelligence
are capable of true thinking—to con
ceive in truth—they should expound
it to the less of the gifted brethern
of mankind.
Sorqe human females marry hu
man males for their selfish purpose
to provide for their—the brutes—
necessities and under Lucifer the Sa
tan's hypnotic influence are kept in
their devotion to a dog, cat, horse
or other of their devilish animals;
and by their moronic intelligence
reasoning, demonstrating it in pub
lic, as if it were something to their
credit, and demonstrating their teeth
on others.
The following decision, based on
former conclusions: that the Elks or
ganization harbors these that are the
least in obedience and the worst re
specting citizens of the laws of the
Republic of U.S.A. that are of mea
ger morals standard. They are about
the least that are entitled to play
themselves up as they are doing it
to be the guardians of the Consti
tution of U.S.A.
Wizard Francis Townsend M.D.
and such supporters of his plan are
usually of a meager morals standard,
as they are suspecting something for
nothing from others; in this case
much more than they are in need of.
Therefore the leaders and their fol
lowers of such intention can be
placed in the tenacles of Lucifer the
Satan's nature dominion of selfish
ness and corrupted morals category
with members of the so - named
American Liberty League, that is
the chaff of true republicanism.
Your friend,
Ludwig Kruppa

as a frosh and as a soph, perhaps my
point of view differs slightly from
yours. I am one who contends that
the traditional fracas is a lot of fun,
good clean fun, for the most part.
For most of the participants realize
that it is nothing to lose their tem
pers over, and that accidents (inju
ries) will happen, even in the best
of regulated sports.
You ask whether there is any
function to an organized class other
than being organized. To me, or
ganization, in its Mud Fight sense,
means the development among class
mates of common interests valuable
to friendship. Later no, reminis
cence will renew these bonds of
friendship. And since at Stanford,
freshmen are eventually split up by
Hall-Row affiliations, isn't it a good
idea to neutralize the ill effects of
the separation by friendships that
will survive this separation?
And as to the physical nature of
the participants—you seem to think
that football and basketball players
are the only athletes. Must a man
weigh 200 and be six feet tall to be
an athlete? You imply that the me
dium boys maul the little boys. But
ths little boys are not the only ones
playfully immersed; just as many
big boys go under.
And the men in the earlier Mud
Fights didn't attend for the sole pur
pose of flexing muscles or otherwise
showing off to the gals or to fra
ternity rushing chairmen. These mo
tives are secondary, if they merit
consideration at all.
Admitting that mankind should
strive toward a better civilization, I
still hold that human nature occa
sionally likes to escape the starch
collars of civilization, to "mix it up"
in fun that is not harmfully anti
social.
—Bill Boyd '36
