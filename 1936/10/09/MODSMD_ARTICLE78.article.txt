### 
"Picadilly .Jim" (now at the Fox
i Stanford) is a P. G. Wodehouse story
j and if you're acquainted with Wode
i house at all, you know he concocts
: some funny butlers. There is such a
funny butler in this film, and as
I such, Eric Blore more than steals
| the show.
I Remember Blore's butlers in "Top
i Hat" and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"?
| Well, his gentleman's gentleman in
i "Picadilly Jim" tops both perform
[ ances. He is a very proper soul, but
; painfully loyal to his master. Watch
j his eyes and mouth when his feelings
j are hurt.
But don't misunderstand me.
j "Picadilly Jim" does not depend en
' tirely on Blore for its laughs, which
I are, happily, many. Robert Mont
| gomery—the titular lead—is back in
j excellent form again, completely rc
! covered from a series of inferior pic
j tures. Frank Morgan, as Montgom
i ery's perennially adolescent father.
! indulges in late-blooming romance
j with Billie Burke. And Madge
I Evans nabs Montgomery with her
I wholesome loveliness.
But with all these, I guess P. G.
! Wodehouse really made the film
! what it is—with a story which slips
J along easily from farcical situatioh to
I farcical situation, which.ends on a
delightfully ratisfying high note.
"Hollywood Boulevard" isn't bad
i for a second feature. A pot-pourri
of Hollywood's lives and loves, it at
| tempts to remind its audience ■of
j cinematic days of yore by* including
in its cast film stars of other days.
