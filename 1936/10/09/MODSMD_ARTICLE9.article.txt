# Uncensored 'Front Page' Proves Exciting Story of Newspaper Life
## Hecht, McArthur's Play Draws Large Crowd 
### HELEN WARSON 
Ben Hecht and Charles McAr
thur's '"The Front Page ? proved ex
citing meet for a packed Little The
ater audience last night. In fact, the
strenuous tempo of newspaper life
as recorded in melodrama threat
ened to give the actors in a few epi
sodes of Sword and Sandals' pro
duction cases of wholesale jitters.
Jim Corner as Hildy Johnson of
the Herald Examiner swore and
shouted successively at: his sweet
heart (Phyllis Lakin), his boss, his
hysterical mother-in-law, played by
Amelia Baines, and Earl Williams,
convict, was consistently good.
Fred Clark as Walter Burns
shouted back.
Bud Cady, the Red-baiting Mayor
of the cigar and derby, gave one of
the best characterizations. Winstead
Weaver in the part of the reprieve
bearer, Mr. Pincus, drawled a few
lines.
Props and costumes add realism to
play readings, but last night's per
formance proved they have their dis
advantages. Telephones, shifted
nervously among reporters, slowed
action in the first two acts, consider
ably. The direction, which lagged in
early scenes, quickened pace, to end
in high gear.
Onyet Watson was a sufficiently
tortured Mollie Malloy, but Bob
Hartman as Sheriff Hartman could
have achieved more. Jeeby Halaby,
Bob Ireland, Hal Kahn, and Harry
Raider were convincingly hard boil
ed men of the press. Amelia Baines
as Mrs. Brant looked 65, fidgeted and
quavered, but muffled lines some
what.
A vote of appreciation to the Pow
ers for an uncensored production. To
future play reading performers:
don't frown, eye audience, gesture
when not participating. It is dis
tracting. Obliterate yourself, please.
