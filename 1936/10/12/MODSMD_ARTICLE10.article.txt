# Will the Mud Fight Follow the Plug-Uglies?
## 
### 
the consensus of Uni
versity ofiiicial opinion is that
students will definitely get injured
if ihey participate in the freshman
sophomore mud fight, Dr. Thomas
A. Storey, men's medical adviser,
states that his department keeps no
records or statistics of the actual
number of students that have in
curred injuries in the annual brawl.
Dr. Storey states that the muddy
water is a good place to start sinus
infections, along with respiratory
and skin infections, but he does not
know how many of the 20.000 odd
cases that were treated at the men's
health service last year could be
traced back directly to the mud fight.
In Hands of Students
As the Ex Committee considers
the abolition of the tradition-sanc
tioned mud fight which establishes
the supremacy of the freshmen or
sophomores in a display of primi
tive barbarism, other University of
ficials are unanimous in their disap
proval of the conflict, but are equally
unanimous in their contention that
the matter for the present at least
is in the hands of the students.
To Dean of Men George B. Culver,
who as a student on the Farm in the
nineties admits having taken part

in the water tank scrambles of that '
day, the mud fight is a hangover of
man's primitive instincts to maul
his fellow man. The hazards which

the fight present to the physically
weaker elements of the two classes
j prompted Dean Culver to issue to
The Daily the following opinion:

"The policy of our coaches in
keeping the men of their squads out
t of the mud fight is a fair indication
[ of their attitude regarding the phys

ical hazards of the affair. I quite
agree with the coaches.
"I have always felt that any in
dividual who goes into the mud fight
is fortunate if he escapes minor or
more serious injuries. There is al
ways the added possibility of some
respiratory infection as an aftermath
of the affair.
"No matter how carefully it may
be planned, the mud fight degener
ates into an exhausting physical
brawl devoid of any team or indi
vidual display of physical skill. If
the authority for continuing the
mud fight were vested in this office
rather than in the student body offi
cials, I would not favor its continu
ation for the reasons above set
forth."
Interclass Sports
Dr. Storey recommends that the
very natural class rivalry be con
centrated in the interclass sports
program which is carried out in the
physical education department ex
clusively for men who are not signed
up for the regular sports teams.
A Stanford graduate with the class
of '96, Dr. Storey, like Dean Culver,
was one of the "reg'ler fellers" of
his day who risked their lives in

water tower fights which took place
30 or 40 feet up in the air. But today
Dr. Storey after watching the re
sults of various forms of brute
frosh-soph rivalry, especially during
the past years during which he has
been medical adviser to men, sees
in the mudfight not only a menace to
health, but a danger to the Honor
Code in its social aspects, and a
source of adverse publicity for the
University through news reels and
the newspapers.
"Fight Out of Place"
Commenting on lasl year's fracas
Dr. Storey issued this indictment:
"A mud fight is out of place in a
university community. It does not
mix well with our honor code. The
first competition experience of the
entering student is too often a lesson
in the ineffectiveness of our honor
code.
"The mud fight was characterized
by indecencies that would not be
tolerated in a town community. Skin
lacerations and mud favor serious
wound infection. Dirty water in
haled favors respiratory, sinus, and
middle ear infections. Newspapers
and news reels spread unfavorable
publicity all over the country."
Despite its disapproval of the mud
fight, the University administration
is rcluctant to take any action until
the occasion warrants it, preferring
to let the matter rest in the hands of
the students. Whatever Ex Commit
tee does concerning the mud fight
tomorrow night will be without the

coercion of University officials. Its
sanction, however, will entail us
assumption of responsibility for the
fight, and its admission that there i.s
no better way for the expression o' :
class rivalry.
