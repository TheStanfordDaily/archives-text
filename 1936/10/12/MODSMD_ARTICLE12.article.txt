is in no danger of be
coming a barbers' college. Thus,
the rumors that the university was
soon going to add to its undergradu
ate curriculum courses in how to
make three hairs grow on top of a
head where none grew before, were
officially spiked by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Said Comptroller Roth: "Stanford
University is not going into the hair
tonic manufacturing business."

Linking of Stanford's name with
such substances as Vitalis (60 sec
onds a day), Lucky Tiger, and Kreml
(have you got toupee hair?) started
with an advertisement that appeared
recently in Esquire.
Placed alongside of a sketch of a
master chirotonsor squirting the
magic hair-restoring fluid on a pa
tient's head was the word "Baldness"
in bold print. The advertisement
went on to say that "the hair re
storing formula discovered by the
Dermatological Research Department
of the Miogenic Laboratory was now
available to the general public for
home use." The address given was
Box 3003, Stanford University, Cali
fornia.
That the world was really in a
hurry to get its cure for baldness
was evidenced by the fact that many
hopefuls overlooked the Box 3003
part of that address and wrote di
rectly to the University for informa
tion on their marvelous "hair-re
storing formula" as the advertise
ment promised.

Greatly surprised by all the sud
den and strange mail, university au
thorities began to investigate. They
soon discovered that over a year ago
a certain B. H. Ryberg had come to
live on the campus for a short while
and had rented a box at the Stanford
post office. In answer to his replies
from his advertisement in Esquire,
he sent circular letters on paper with
an official-looking letterhead marked
Miogenic Laboratory â€” Department
of Dermatology, Box 3003, Stanford
University. The circular letters

tossed ten-syllable scientific-sound
ing words around in the same man
ner as a women's cosmetic advertise
ment.

"Mr. Ryberg has rented a box at
the Stanford University post office
with the obvious intention of creat
ing the impression that he is in some
way connected with the University
and that the University is sponsoring
his product," Comptroller Roth re
plied to those who wrote about the
hair tonic.
"When we wrote to Ryberg and
told him to cut it out," Roth said,
"the guy had the crust to tell us
that he was sorry there was a con
fusion of addresses and that if we
would send him his mail, he'd send
us any letters for us that came to
him."

"Of course we're taking legal steps
to shut the bird up," Roth added.
