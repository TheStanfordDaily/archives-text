# CAMPUS OPINION
## BENIGHTED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has been my feeling that a col
lege paper in matters of national pol
itics should be non-partisan. There
fore, it is with some annoyance that
I find one of the regular departments
of the Daily, namely, Bull Session,
devoting much of its space to witty
persiflage derogatory to the Repub
lican candidates in the present cam
paign. Perhaps my annoyance is due
solely to the fact that I am one of
those benighted fools who are in fa
vor of Mr. Landon. Believe it or
not, Mr. Bull-Sessioner, there ai'e
some people at Stanford who are not
going to vote for Mr. Roosevelt.
Hence, in fairness to that body of
the Daily's readers whose paper it is
just as much as the opposing fac
tion, I think it is only right that the
staff either adopt a "hands off" policy
regarding the campaign issues, or
devote some space to the opinions of
those on the opposite side of the
fence.
Furthermore, I trust that Mr. Bull-
Sessioner is not, as his offering of
October 7th would indicate, going to
support Mr. Roosevelt because he
has pictured the latter as a sort of

matinee idol, or because Mr. Farley
! is a "lovable ass."
However, I do heartily agree with
! the remark that Mr. Garner "hasn't
j stepped in yet." I might add that it
is very doubtful if he willâ€”for ob

vious reasons. Mr. Bull-Sessioner
should at least give Colonel Knox
credit for one attainment. He's the
first vice-presidential nominee that
we have heard from for a long time.
