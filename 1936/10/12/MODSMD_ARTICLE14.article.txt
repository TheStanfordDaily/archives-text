STANFORD HORIZONS, by Ray
k Lyman Wilbur, Stanford-Univer
sity Press, 1&36.
Stanford Horizons, a collection of
commencement addresses and other
articles, was published this summer
by the Stanford University Press to
commemorate the twentieth year of
his presidency.
Delivered over a period of years
that included such crises as a war, a
bitter peace, recovery and a world
depressionâ€”years that remolded the
minds and attitudes of many men,
the lectures surprise for their very
lack of contradiction. Dr. Wilbur's
original convictions on democracy,
on evolutionary progress, and edu
cation stand.
Good citizenship is Dr. vv liuui's
demand of the college graduate.
"Education means a capacity for
greater service, greater usefulness,
and for the happiness that goes with
usefulness, not the training of your
mind so that you can acquire a big
ger house or a fine automobile. It
means capacity for co-operation
with your fellows in solving all the
problems we all face together."
"In the field of politics today in
this or in any other country, the ed
ucated man or woman who is will
ing to think in terms of political life
is greatly ueeded . . . public service
in hundreds of different fields offers
a natural opportunity for the univer
sity graduate."
No pessimist is our leader. "In
spite of its terrible inadequacies and
awful blunders," he told the Class of
1919. "civilization is working stead
ily toward higher levels and greater
light."
Most trenchant, perhaps, is Dr.
Wilbur's comment on war: "Some
wars have been brought about cold
bloodedly, but most of them are due
to what we might call glandular
thinking. They result from emotion
al storms based usually upon fear.
War is the supreme tragedy coming
from failure to understand. This
failure to understand comes largely
from lack of information, and appre
ciation of the other man's or other
nation's point of view."
In Democracy and Education, the
president believes, lie the means of
combutting war, ignorance, crime,

and cruelty. But education in de
mocracy must not, need not, stand
ardize individuals. Mental differ
ences as well as physical differences
must be squarely faced. "That to me |
is the essence of our American sys- I
tem: to give everybody an equal
chance to try, but after trial not to j
stop those who succeed because of |
those who do not do so well."
Interesting to check is Stanford
University, 1936, with the university

as conceived by the president in his
inaugural address 20 years ago. The
dissimilarities, and there are ma'.iy,
may well be rued.

That a depression, other events, 1
interfered with his purpose must be
kept in mind.
Stanford Horizons affords a clear !
statement of Dr. Wilbur's views. I

Even to other than future educators,
it is compact, well sprinkled with
apt stories, illustrations. At the risk
of appearing fatuous, the book is an
education in education.
