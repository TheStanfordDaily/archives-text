# Cards Tie Webfeet, 7-7; Tiny Points to Trojans
## Runs by Vigna and LaSelle, Intercepted Passes Feature Deadlocked Game 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Rising by degrees, Tiny Thornhill's football varsity came out of Satur
iia\ with a 7-7 deadlock with Oregon, considerable of an improvement over
the- Santa Clara and W.S.C. defeats.
\lthough the crowd of 15,000 to the man admitted that Prink Callison's

team was underrated, and that the*
breaks, statistics, and score were as
even as ever they come, still it was a j
disappointment to Stanford follow
ers.
Oregon had been trounced the
Week before by U.S.C., and the of
fense shown by the Indians at Pull
man last week pointed toward a
Caidinal victory. But in part it was
iu-t that, judging from Thornhill's
wot ds after the game—too much at
tention last week to the game past,
not enough to the game coming.
Vigna Starter
it was Little Joe Vigna that started
he day off for Stanford. After a,
ntdfield duel, one good 17-yard run
by Coffis, and some short gains, they !
called Joe to hit off tackle on a
Single wing to the left, third and 3.
Vigna made the three and 43 more, j
getting through the line standing up'
and pushing his right into the faces
of fully four Webfeet that caught up
with him on the way to the goal. It!
wasn't fleet legs that earned that
score, it was that strong right hand.
Joe then held the ball while Leo
Fe t ko converted.
Oregon Slaps Back
Oregon came back right away, j
though, with Dale Laselle doing the
big act in a play much the same as j
Vigna's—a 37-yard run to Stanford's j
17-yard line, where a series of tries !
by Tom Braddock and Arleigh
Bentley kept paying ground until
Bentley's 3-yard play through center
vscured a touchdown. Laselle place
kicked it, the second play of the sec
ond quarter.
From there on the ball see-sawed, j
Stanford, showing a pretty fair of- 1
tense, got as close as the Webfoot '
26-yard line late in the final period,
only to have two tries by Coffis and
passes by Vigna and Fred Williams
fall short of a first down.
Oregon's best chance was near the
end, when they intercepted Brig
ham's toss and got to the Card 27,,
where an attempted field goal was
blocked by Bob Mangan. This was
the last play of the game.
Little Punting
There was little punting in the
game, as intercepted passes ade
quately took care of ball exchanges.
Stanford threw 24 passes, completed
7 and had G go wrong. Oregon '
'hrew 8, completed none, and had 3
intercepted. First downs were 10-10,
while gross yardage gained was
Stanford's, 197 to 189.
The Oregon ball carriers, Black
man, Laselle, Braddock. and Bent
fey, seemed hard for the Stanford
linemen to stop all afternoon.
It was the equally capable ball car
rying of Coffis, Vigna, Williams, and
Brigham that saved the Stanford
skin, as Tiny afterward said: "Our
tackling and blocking today was de
ficient; they weren't cleaning up at
all."
