# Frosh Defeat Cadets by 14-7; Reade Shines
## Passes Lead to Scores; Black Foxe's Early Lead Soon Overcome 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
The team that had held all opposi
tion to one first down was given a
14-7 beating by the undefeated
Stanford freshmen here Saturday.
First Stanford score came early in
(he third quarter. Eric Bovet, Pap
oose quarterback, punted to the
Black Foxe 3-yard line where End
Doug Grant downed the ball. A
poor Cadet kick which went out of
bounds on their own 14 paved the
way for a Frosh score.
After three thrusts at the line
which were effectively repulsed, the
Papooses pushed it over. Howard
Ilickingbotham fired a forward pass
to "Perry" Peers, who caught it in
the end zone. The play netted 15
yards. Stocky Dick DeLauer place
kicked the extra point to even the
game score at 7 all.
Shortly after the final quarter got
under way, Chad Reade stole a Black
Foxe pass and converted the theft
into a Stanford touchdown. Reade
accounted for one of the most spec

tacular plays ever turned in by a
freshman here, when he intercepted |
the ball near the sideline, lost his j
balance, partially stopped to recover
it, and then outdistanced four pur- j
suing rivals to the goal line. Chad's |
great gallop gained 45 yards. Once
again DeLauer was good for the sev- I
enth point.
