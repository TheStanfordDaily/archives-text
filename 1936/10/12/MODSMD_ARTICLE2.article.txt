course of recovery from the
last depression has been marked
oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel
■ >pment projects.
On this rising wave of confidence
n the future, re-employment of in
iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con
ditions again prevailing and spread
ng through the entire range of con
sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933
las been slow by comparison.
n fact, the index of total industrial
production prepared each month by
he Federal Reserve Board has only
lining the past summer advanced
dearly beyond the high peak regis
ered in the summer of 1933. The
pattern, duplicated in the records of
actory employment, payrolls, and
even commodity prices, instead of
jeing a concave arc is a convex arc,
vith tapering momentum.
Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more
han any other factors to the wave
>1 bank failures which was rising
>minously all through the depression
Hid which in turn produced a steady
iquidation of securities and com
plete prostration of the investment
narkets.
n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
"*0 these two situations the New
Deal brought some of its most ehar-
methods of relief. Break
nß away from past tradition and
m cedent there was 1. ,• lily devised
i ew "administration, known for
hurt as the AAA, which entered
hi i the contracts with farmers
rovvin i designated staple crops,
iroviding payment of benefits or

bounties in return for contraction of
acreage.
This presently had the effect of
reducing some of the excessive car
ryovers, but the freakish drought
seasons of 1934 ;ind 1!).'><> have done
considerably more to reduce surplus
supplies of grains and animal prod
ucts. The cotton surplus has been
brought into more normal compass
partly through revival in general
business at home and abroad.
The combined effect of crop con
trol and a cheapening of the dollar
(now wholly neutralized by similar
measures abroad) has been to raise
prices nf all farm products more than
proportionately to the reduced pro
duction, and tin* resulting expansion

in farm income and purchasing
power has "contributed in no small
measure to restoring the market for
motor cars, farm equipment, build
ing materials, and general merchan
dise.
Even though the AAA was ruled
by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional late in 1935 the general
principle of preventing excessive
acreage and avoiding unwieldy sur
pluses of crops whose foreign mar
ket has now been impaired by con
ditions beyond our control, will
probably continue to persist through
legislation directed primarily toward
land conservation and crop diversifi
cation.
The urban mortgage crisis, and its

j counterpart in the complete collapse
I of (he building industry, has been a
i complicated and difficult problem.
To this also the federal government
has brought to bear novel methods
whose soundness and ultimate suc
! cess are still to be tested.
Through the emergency loans of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpo
i ration, organized by the Hoover ad
; ministration, and later by the device
of federal deposit insurance and a
strong upswing in investment values,
the banking system was put in shape
; to function and resume the opera
tions of lending on property. The
appalling wreckage created bv loose
management and unsound methods
in the building and loan field -was
gradually cleared up and these insti
tutions put in shape to resume busi
ness.
Finally the federal government it
self set up agencies to insure ap
proved mortgages and for a 'time
made direct salvage or refinancing
Joans to home owners.
The real force which has begun to
operate in reviving home building,
however, has been the improvenient
in general buying-power, the avail
ability of long-term funds on first
mortgage at reasonable interest
rates, and especially the growing
need for housing accommodation.
Families are "unscrambling," rather
than living together to economize
rent, and the rising marriage rate
has also created new demand for
housing.
Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250
per cent higher than they were at
ihe bottom in 1933, while the total
contracts awarded, including indus
trial, utility, and public structures,
will exceed the bottom annual total
by 150 per cent. If the building Con
tinues to increase at its current an
nual rate it will reach the boom
Jpvpl of the middle '20's within two
years.
In this field recovery been
more in accordance with the normal
pattern, slow at first, and later ac
celerating. But it is clear fram the
statistics that the recent present rate
of building expansion (and one can
include also realty operations gen
erally) is as rapid as in any past
period of recovery.
The fact that the actual volume; is
still so far below the peak of tjie
past boom is due, not to a slow
of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie
bottom of the depression.
Unemployment Serious
Owing to the slow start of tjhe
building and plant equipment indus
tries in getting under way the prob
lem of industrial unemployment hfcs
been a particularly serious one. Ev4n
if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re
lief recipients, to WPA workers do
ing semi-useful things, to silver
miners for lining Treasury vaults
with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?
To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

Those who restrain desire do so
because theirs is weak enough to be
restrained; and the restrainer or rea
son usurps its place and governs the
unwilling.—William Blake.

To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

course of recovery from the

oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel

On this rising wave of confidence

iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con

sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933

even commodity prices, instead of

Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more

n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
"*0 these two situations the New
Deal brought some of its most ehar-
methods of relief. Break
nß away from past tradition and
m cedent there was 1. ,• lily devised

hurt as the AAA, which entered

ryovers, but the freakish drought
seasons of 1934 ;ind 1!).'><> have done
considerably more to reduce surplus
supplies of grains and animal prod
ucts. The cotton surplus has been
brought into more normal compass
partly through revival in general
business at home and abroad.
The combined effect of crop con
trol and a cheapening of the dollar
(now wholly neutralized by similar
measures abroad) has been to raise
prices nf all farm products more than
proportionately to the reduced pro
duction, and tin* resulting expansion

in farm income and purchasing
power has "contributed in no small
measure to restoring the market for
motor cars, farm equipment, build
ing materials, and general merchan
dise.
Even though the AAA was ruled
by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional late in 1935 the general
principle of preventing excessive
acreage and avoiding unwieldy sur
pluses of crops whose foreign mar
ket has now been impaired by con
ditions beyond our control, will
probably continue to persist through
legislation directed primarily toward
land conservation and crop diversifi
cation.
The urban mortgage crisis, and its

j counterpart in the complete collapse
I of (he building industry, has been a
i complicated and difficult problem.
To this also the federal government
has brought to bear novel methods
whose soundness and ultimate suc
! cess are still to be tested.
Through the emergency loans of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpo
i ration, organized by the Hoover ad
; ministration, and later by the device
of federal deposit insurance and a
strong upswing in investment values,
the banking system was put in shape
; to function and resume the opera
tions of lending on property. The
appalling wreckage created bv loose
management and unsound methods
in the building and loan field -was
gradually cleared up and these insti
tutions put in shape to resume busi
ness.
Finally the federal government it
self set up agencies to insure ap
proved mortgages and for a 'time
made direct salvage or refinancing
Joans to home owners.
The real force which has begun to
operate in reviving home building,
however, has been the improvenient
in general buying-power, the avail
ability of long-term funds on first
mortgage at reasonable interest
rates, and especially the growing
need for housing accommodation.
Families are "unscrambling," rather
than living together to economize
rent, and the rising marriage rate
has also created new demand for
housing.
Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250
per cent higher than they were at
ihe bottom in 1933, while the total
contracts awarded, including indus
trial, utility, and public structures,
will exceed the bottom annual total
by 150 per cent. If the building Con
tinues to increase at its current an
nual rate it will reach the boom
Jpvpl of the middle '20's within two
years.
In this field recovery been
more in accordance with the normal
pattern, slow at first, and later ac
celerating. But it is clear fram the
statistics that the recent present rate
of building expansion (and one can
include also realty operations gen
erally) is as rapid as in any past
period of recovery.
The fact that the actual volume; is
still so far below the peak of tjie
past boom is due, not to a slow
of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie
bottom of the depression.
Unemployment Serious
Owing to the slow start of tjhe
building and plant equipment indus
tries in getting under way the prob
lem of industrial unemployment hfcs
been a particularly serious one. Ev4n
if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re
lief recipients, to WPA workers do
ing semi-useful things, to silver
miners for lining Treasury vaults
with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?

If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re
lief recipients, to WPA workers do
ing semi-useful things, to silver
miners for lining Treasury vaults
with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?
To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

course of recovery from the
last depression has been marked
oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel
■ >pment projects.
On this rising wave of confidence
n the future, re-employment of in
iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con
ditions again prevailing and spread
ng through the entire range of con
sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933
las been slow by comparison.
n fact, the index of total industrial
production prepared each month by

lining the past summer advanced
dearly beyond the high peak regis
ered in the summer of 1933. The
pattern, duplicated in the records of
actory employment, payrolls, and
even commodity prices, instead of
jeing a concave arc is a convex arc,
vith tapering momentum.
Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more
han any other factors to the wave

Hid which in turn produced a steady
iquidation of securities and com
plete prostration of the investment
narkets.
n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
"*0 these two situations the New
Deal brought some of its most ehar-
methods of relief. Break
nß away from past tradition and
m cedent there was 1. ,• lily devised
i ew "administration, known for
hurt as the AAA, which entered
hi i the contracts with farmers
rovvin i designated staple crops,
iroviding payment of benefits or

bounties in return for contraction of
acreage.
This presently had the effect of
reducing some of the excessive car
ryovers, but the freakish drought
seasons of 1934 ;ind 1!).'><> have done
considerably more to reduce surplus
supplies of grains and animal prod
ucts. The cotton surplus has been
brought into more normal compass
partly through revival in general
business at home and abroad.
The combined effect of crop con
trol and a cheapening of the dollar
(now wholly neutralized by similar
measures abroad) has been to raise
prices nf all farm products more than
proportionately to the reduced pro
duction, and tin* resulting expansion

in farm income and purchasing
power has "contributed in no small
measure to restoring the market for
motor cars, farm equipment, build
ing materials, and general merchan
dise.
Even though the AAA was ruled
by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional late in 1935 the general
principle of preventing excessive
acreage and avoiding unwieldy sur
pluses of crops whose foreign mar
ket has now been impaired by con
ditions beyond our control, will
probably continue to persist through
legislation directed primarily toward
land conservation and crop diversifi
cation.
The urban mortgage crisis, and its

j counterpart in the complete collapse
I of (he building industry, has been a
i complicated and difficult problem.
To this also the federal government
has brought to bear novel methods
whose soundness and ultimate suc
! cess are still to be tested.
Through the emergency loans of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpo
i ration, organized by the Hoover ad
; ministration, and later by the device
of federal deposit insurance and a
strong upswing in investment values,
the banking system was put in shape
; to function and resume the opera
tions of lending on property. The
appalling wreckage created bv loose
management and unsound methods
in the building and loan field -was
gradually cleared up and these insti
tutions put in shape to resume busi
ness.
Finally the federal government it
self set up agencies to insure ap
proved mortgages and for a 'time
made direct salvage or refinancing
Joans to home owners.
The real force which has begun to
operate in reviving home building,
however, has been the improvenient
in general buying-power, the avail
ability of long-term funds on first
mortgage at reasonable interest
rates, and especially the growing
need for housing accommodation.
Families are "unscrambling," rather
than living together to economize
rent, and the rising marriage rate
has also created new demand for
housing.
Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250
per cent higher than they were at
ihe bottom in 1933, while the total
contracts awarded, including indus
trial, utility, and public structures,
will exceed the bottom annual total
by 150 per cent. If the building Con
tinues to increase at its current an
nual rate it will reach the boom
Jpvpl of the middle '20's within two
years.
In this field recovery been
more in accordance with the normal
pattern, slow at first, and later ac
celerating. But it is clear fram the
statistics that the recent present rate
of building expansion (and one can
include also realty operations gen
erally) is as rapid as in any past
period of recovery.
The fact that the actual volume; is
still so far below the peak of tjie
past boom is due, not to a slow
of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie
bottom of the depression.
Unemployment Serious
Owing to the slow start of tjhe
building and plant equipment indus
tries in getting under way the prob
lem of industrial unemployment hfcs
been a particularly serious one. Ev4n
if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid

The fact that the actual volume; is

of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie

if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re

with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?
To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

course of recovery from the
last depression has been marked
oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel
■ >pment projects.
On this rising wave of confidence
n the future, re-employment of in
iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con
ditions again prevailing and spread
ng through the entire range of con
sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933
las been slow by comparison.
n fact, the index of total industrial
production prepared each month by
he Federal Reserve Board has only
lining the past summer advanced
dearly beyond the high peak regis
ered in the summer of 1933. The
pattern, duplicated in the records of
actory employment, payrolls, and
even commodity prices, instead of
jeing a concave arc is a convex arc,
vith tapering momentum.
Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more
han any other factors to the wave

Hid which in turn produced a steady
iquidation of securities and com
plete prostration of the investment
narkets.
n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
"*0 these two situations the New
Deal brought some of its most ehar-
methods of relief. Break
nß away from past tradition and
m cedent there was 1. ,• lily devised
i ew "administration, known for
hurt as the AAA, which entered
hi i the contracts with farmers
rovvin i designated staple crops,
iroviding payment of benefits or

bounties in return for contraction of
acreage.
This presently had the effect of
reducing some of the excessive car
ryovers, but the freakish drought
seasons of 1934 ;ind 1!).'><> have done
considerably more to reduce surplus
supplies of grains and animal prod
ucts. The cotton surplus has been
brought into more normal compass
partly through revival in general
business at home and abroad.
The combined effect of crop con
trol and a cheapening of the dollar
(now wholly neutralized by similar
measures abroad) has been to raise
prices nf all farm products more than
proportionately to the reduced pro
duction, and tin* resulting expansion

in farm income and purchasing
power has "contributed in no small
measure to restoring the market for
motor cars, farm equipment, build
ing materials, and general merchan
dise.
Even though the AAA was ruled
by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional late in 1935 the general
principle of preventing excessive
acreage and avoiding unwieldy sur
pluses of crops whose foreign mar
ket has now been impaired by con
ditions beyond our control, will
probably continue to persist through
legislation directed primarily toward
land conservation and crop diversifi
cation.
The urban mortgage crisis, and its

j counterpart in the complete collapse
I of (he building industry, has been a
i complicated and difficult problem.
To this also the federal government
has brought to bear novel methods
whose soundness and ultimate suc
! cess are still to be tested.
Through the emergency loans of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpo
i ration, organized by the Hoover ad
; ministration, and later by the device
of federal deposit insurance and a
strong upswing in investment values,
the banking system was put in shape
; to function and resume the opera
tions of lending on property. The
appalling wreckage created bv loose
management and unsound methods
in the building and loan field -was
gradually cleared up and these insti
tutions put in shape to resume busi
ness.
Finally the federal government it
self set up agencies to insure ap
proved mortgages and for a 'time
made direct salvage or refinancing
Joans to home owners.
The real force which has begun to
operate in reviving home building,
however, has been the improvenient
in general buying-power, the avail
ability of long-term funds on first
mortgage at reasonable interest
rates, and especially the growing
need for housing accommodation.
Families are "unscrambling," rather
than living together to economize
rent, and the rising marriage rate
has also created new demand for
housing.
Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250

Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250
per cent higher than they were at
ihe bottom in 1933, while the total
contracts awarded, including indus
trial, utility, and public structures,
will exceed the bottom annual total
by 150 per cent. If the building Con
tinues to increase at its current an
nual rate it will reach the boom
Jpvpl of the middle '20's within two
years.
In this field recovery been
more in accordance with the normal
pattern, slow at first, and later ac
celerating. But it is clear fram the
statistics that the recent present rate
of building expansion (and one can
include also realty operations gen
erally) is as rapid as in any past
period of recovery.
The fact that the actual volume; is
still so far below the peak of tjie
past boom is due, not to a slow
of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie
bottom of the depression.
Unemployment Serious
Owing to the slow start of tjhe
building and plant equipment indus
tries in getting under way the prob
lem of industrial unemployment hfcs
been a particularly serious one. Ev4n
if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re
lief recipients, to WPA workers do
ing semi-useful things, to silver
miners for lining Treasury vaults
with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?
To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac

r n this gradual building-up proc

oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel

This familiar process of revival

New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933

production prepared each month by

Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic

property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val

proportionately to the reduced pro

in farm income and purchasing

Even though the AAA was ruled

in general buying-power, the avail

Building Booming
The value of residential building
contracts this year will be about 250
per cent higher than they were at
ihe bottom in 1933, while the total
contracts awarded, including indus
trial, utility, and public structures,
will exceed the bottom annual total
by 150 per cent. If the building Con
tinues to increase at its current an
nual rate it will reach the boom
Jpvpl of the middle '20's within two
years.
In this field recovery been
more in accordance with the normal
pattern, slow at first, and later ac
celerating. But it is clear fram the
statistics that the recent present rate
of building expansion (and one can
include also realty operations gen
erally) is as rapid as in any past
period of recovery.
The fact that the actual volume; is
still so far below the peak of tjie
past boom is due, not to a slow
of expansion, but to ihe extremely
low point in activity reached at tjie
bottom of the depression.
Unemployment Serious
Owing to the slow start of tjhe
building and plant equipment indus
tries in getting under way the prob
lem of industrial unemployment hfcs
been a particularly serious one. Ev4n
if all the jobless workers in the con
struction and related materials in
dustries are again absorbed within

tinue to be large numbers of "white
collar" and fanu workers dislodged
from their normal activity by tech
nical shifts of one kind or another.
In seeking to relieve this situation
the expenditures of both the federal
and local governments have risen to
tremendous sums, and the federal
deficit alone amounted to over 2 bil
lions in the last fiscal year, even after
deduction of the veterans' bonus
payments.
If we combine all the money paid
by government to farmers, to city re
lief recipients, to WPA workers do
ing semi-useful things, to silver
miners for lining Treasury vaults
with useless metal, and to a consid
erably increased number of public
functionaries, the total easily ex
plains why consumer purchasing has
gone ahead with abandon. And it
also explains some of the hesitation
of private capital to go forward with
new ventures, although obviously
new capital is not going eagerly into
the rehabilitation of old enterprises,
such as the railroads, so long as old
debt is excessive and badly con
gealed.
Public Starts Upswing
In some respects we have already
enjoyed a major boom, financed not
according to historic precedent,
through the private investment and
bank-loan machinery, but rather by
public financial largesse. The banks
have greatly increased their depos
its, but on the loan side there is little
gain; the gain is almost wholly in
holdings of government lOU's.
Since in the past a marked hesita
tion to continue the process of
lending for the future always mark
ed a turning point in the wave of
prosperity, and signalled the begin
ning of reaction, one cannot but
wonder what may happen if there
should be a marked curtailment in
the present peculiar process of
pumping funds to industry through
the indirect channel via consumer
incomes.
Will private investment initiative
promptly carry the ball further after
federal extravagance is curbed (and
it will probably be more or less
curbed regardless of the outcome of
the coming election)? Or will the
growing shadow of international dis

turbance thi'ow the financing direct
ed by public agencies into a new di
rection, as the present armament
boom in Britain strongly suggests?
To these questions there is ob
viously no sure answer at present.
One thing, however, deserves a
final word of comment. We have
achieved such recovery as has so far
occurred, and it has been without
doubt impressive, by financial poli
cies which suggest extravagance, not
only in terms of public finance but
extravagance in terms of domestic
finance.
Installment credit is being manu
factured at a rate comparable to that
in the roaring '20's. The individual
is being tempted to mortgage his full
ture, at a low interest rajte to be sure,
but in many more directions at once
than ever before. The urge to bor
row and let tomorrow take care of
itself is paramount and übiquitous
and resort to it find, ready public
sponsorship. In this sense our recov
ery is now proceeding under what
may turn out to be forced draught,
and those who are wise will take
warning.
Also those who can see a succes
sion of government deficits, both
local and feedral, ultimately creat
ing an impasse in our public
finances should emphastically insist
upon the early elimination of all
spending which is not essential, or
which does not contribute to sound
and continuous advance in the basic
fields of production.

Those who restrain desire do so
because theirs is weak enough to be
restrained; and the restrainer or rea
son usurps its place and governs the
unwilling.—William Blake.

course of recovery from the
last depression has been marked
oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel
■ >pment projects.
On this rising wave of confidence
n the future, re-employment of in
iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con
ditions again prevailing and spread
ng through the entire range of con
sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933
las been slow by comparison.
n fact, the index of total industrial
production prepared each month by
he Federal Reserve Board has only
lining the past summer advanced
dearly beyond the high peak regis
ered in the summer of 1933. The
pattern, duplicated in the records of
actory employment, payrolls, and
even commodity prices, instead of
jeing a concave arc is a convex arc,
vith tapering momentum.
Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more
han any other factors to the wave
>1 bank failures which was rising
>minously all through the depression
Hid which in turn produced a steady
iquidation of securities and com
plete prostration of the investment
narkets.
n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
