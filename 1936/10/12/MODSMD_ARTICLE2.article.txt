course of recovery from the
last depression has been marked
oy several features which are in
contrast to any previous experience.
In past periods of recuperation the
process of revival has usually bet»n
ather slow at first, with gradual ac
celeration continuing into the suc
ceeding boom conditions.
r n this gradual building-up proc
ess it has been usual for our basic
ndustries to feel almost from the
oeginning the stimulating effect of a
enewed flow of capital funds and
nvestment initiative into long-term
construction, equipment, and devel
■ >pment projects.
On this rising wave of confidence
n the future, re-employment of in
iustrial labor expanded, general
purchasing power was restored, and
ve eventually found prosperity con
ditions again prevailing and spread
ng through the entire range of con
sumer goods, as well as capital
goods, activity.
This familiar process of revival
vas accomplished with little if any
lirr>ct participation or assistance
Vom governmental sources, federal
jr local.
New Deal Contrasts
vgainst this historical pattern the
ecent recovery of economic and
inancial conditions stands in marked
contrast. The New Deal administra
ion, confronted by a tremendous
ciepre:- ion crisis, adopted the phi
losophy of a "planned," rather than
i spontaneous, recuperation and pro
ceeded to adopt policies embracing a
novel mixture of reform, reorganiza
ion, rehnancing. and recovery.
As a result of these policies, to
gether with the existence of excep
'ional demoralization in Jhe long
erm capital markets, the initial
stimulus, instead of coming in the
industries making capital equipment
and producing basic raw materials,
is before, came with startling force
n the industries catering more di
ectly to final consumption.
By the middle of 1933 there had
occurred the sharpest spurt in such
production ever witnessed in this
country. Part of this was specula
tive, in anticipation of inflation ow
ing to our departure from gold, or
n anticipation of abrupt increases in
abor costs due to the projected in-
Justrial codes under NRA. But at all
events we got under way in indus
rial revival with so spirited a leap
hat the further progress since 1933
las been slow by comparison.
n fact, the index of total industrial
production prepared each month by
he Federal Reserve Board has only
lining the past summer advanced
dearly beyond the high peak regis
ered in the summer of 1933. The
pattern, duplicated in the records of
actory employment, payrolls, and
even commodity prices, instead of
jeing a concave arc is a convex arc,
vith tapering momentum.
Aid Bank Failures
Vmong the most serious economic
problems before the country four
/ears ago were the collapse of real
property values in the cities and the
severe decline in farm product val
les and incomes in the rural areas.
Fhese situations contributed more
han any other factors to the wave
>1 bank failures which was rising
>minously all through the depression
Hid which in turn produced a steady
iquidation of securities and com
plete prostration of the investment
narkets.
n the urban centers there was a
auplus of unrentable domestic, of
ic, and hotel space; in storage there
vere growing surpluses of staple
arm products far exceeding any
hmg in history.
"*0 these two situations the New
Deal brought some of its most ehar-
methods of relief. Break
nß away from past tradition and
m cedent there was 1. ,• lily devised
i ew "administration, known for
hurt as the AAA, which entered
hi i the contracts with farmers
rovvin i designated staple crops,
iroviding payment of benefits or

bounties in return for contraction of
acreage.
This presently had the effect of
reducing some of the excessive car
ryovers, but the freakish drought
seasons of 1934 ;ind 1!).'><> have done
considerably more to reduce surplus
supplies of grains and animal prod
ucts. The cotton surplus has been
brought into more normal compass
partly through revival in general
business at home and abroad.
The combined effect of crop con
trol and a cheapening of the dollar
(now wholly neutralized by similar
measures abroad) has been to raise
prices nf all farm products more than
proportionately to the reduced pro
duction, and tin* resulting expansion

in farm income and purchasing
power has "contributed in no small
measure to restoring the market for
motor cars, farm equipment, build
ing materials, and general merchan
dise.
Even though the AAA was ruled
by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional late in 1935 the general
principle of preventing excessive
acreage and avoiding unwieldy sur
pluses of crops whose foreign mar
ket has now been impaired by con
ditions beyond our control, will
probably continue to persist through
legislation directed primarily toward
land conservation and crop diversifi
cation.
The urban mortgage crisis, and its

j counterpart in the complete collapse
I of (he building industry, has been a
i complicated and difficult problem.
To this also the federal government
has brought to bear novel methods
whose soundness and ultimate suc
! cess are still to be tested.
Through the emergency loans of
the Reconstruction Finance Corpo
i ration, organized by the Hoover ad
; ministration, and later by the device
of federal deposit insurance and a
strong upswing in investment values,
the banking system was put in shape
; to function and resume the opera
tions of lending on property. The
appalling wreckage created bv loose
management and unsound methods
