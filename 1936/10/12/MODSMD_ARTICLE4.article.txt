# What's Right With the Quad?
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
year about this time the
editor of the Quad pulls up a
chair in front of his desk, smiles at
a Daily reporter, and says, gracious
ly, "Sit down please. I want to tell
you about the great plans we have
for this year's annual."
The reporter hears the editor's
glorious tale, runs back to Daily
shack to write a flattering story
about "the greatest Quad in Stanford
history." When, about eighl months i
later, the Quad shows up in its fin- j
ished form, it may or may not live j
up to the editor's "campaign prom- '
ises."
Ruth Barnes, first woman editor
since 'he initial Stanford yearbook
appeared 43 years ago, punctuated I
her story Friday with actual proof,
something which is not usually done.
Photo jam Planned
"A campus picture book, with
candid photographs jamming the
pages from cover to cover that's the
1937 Quad. In fact, we will even use
one photograph on the cover if il
will reproduce successfully," she ex
plained.

Photographs will take the place of
art work formerly done by San
Francisco artists. The end papers
and section pages will be full-page
camera studies."
On her desk already were piles of

first-rate pictuers taken by Tro
Harper and Ed Steinheimer, two of
the Farm's really expert cameramen.
"Then the page lay-outs are being
planned by a professional advertis- j
ing artist, a man who is rated by ad
vertising agencies the best on the
coast." She pulled out of a drawer j
two or three sample layouts. They
showed a definite break from ihe
conventional pages of the past. They
were actually fresh, modern, alive.
Razz Razzed
"We have omitted the razz section,
overdone now for many years. In its
place, among the advertisements,
will appear cartoon comics and hu
morous photographs of campus life."
She said other things, too, about
staff reorganization and writers. Il
probably wasn't a bad idea, after all,
to let a woman fill the editor's chair
for a year. Fiery little Ruth Barnes
is cleaning lip the Stanford Quad,
earnestly and efficiently. If she keeps
up with the brains and enthusiasm
she has shown so far, the Daily next
year will have a hard time filling a
page on "What Was Wrong With the
" 1937 Quad."
