# PHI BETE FOR F.R.

THE PJAN from Mars, the cur
rent all-American Mud Fight is
nothing more than a bit of nose
thumbing and thumb-waggling; to
the embryonic ward heelers on the
Stanford campus, it is an all-im
portant battle of right vs. wrong in
volving basic principles.
The Young Democrats already
have had a dance down at the Com
munity Center. The Young Repub
licans, a little slower on the draw,
promise a jolly-up "sometime in the
near future" but throw in an added
attraction of radio broadcasts.
Tonight, Coach John Bunn and
Captain Dinty Moore of the Stan
ford basketball team will appear on
KGO at 11:00 with Nibs Price and
John Rathbone of the Cal team. The
program, sponsored by the Young
Republicans, will certainly not de
fame the character of the Kansas
Coolidge.
Democrats Ballyhoo
The Young Democrats, organized
35-50 strong last week, have already
been besieging the Daily office with

GROUP 1 — Lower Division
honor students, 1934-35
Bau lout average, 1.30
For Roosevelt, 70 per cent
For Landon, 30 per cent
Ratio Roosevelt to Landon,
9-4
Contacted, 35 per cent
GROUP 2—Fraternity X
Bawlout average, 0.25
For Roosevelt, 22 per cent
For Landon, 78 per cent
Ratio Roosevelt to Landon.
1.2-4
Contacted, 95 per cent

ballyhoo. The Young Republicans,
though not definitely organized,
claim a signed-up membership of
175. Both young groups are backed
quite vigorously by campaign man
agers sitting in offices downtown in
Palo Alto.
When it is realized that both
groups are appealing to a politically
impotent group, there is cause to
wonder, why all the fuss about poli
tics on the campus? Only the sen
iors, or about one-fourth of the
undergraduates, are old enough to
vote (and drink). Less than one
fourth of them will vote, because
they are too far away from their
legal residence and too lazy to send
for an absentee ballot. Yet, the
Young Republican party is spend
ing money on radio talks every
Monday night that have a direct ap
peal to collegians.
Plainly, the interest of the Re
publicans is in the straw ballot that
will be taken on the campus. There
is a reason for this. There is a great
value to a party in a university
straw vote, because this somewhat
compact group is easy to poll, and
university students are assumed to
be educated.
Still for Hoover
And Republicans are justified in
assuming that a poll of Stanfordites
will give a Republican result. Last
election, when there was a great
Roosevelt landslide elsewhere, 31
college campi all over the country
returned a straw vote result of Hoo
ver, 4!) per cent; Roosevelt, 31 per
cent; and Thomas, 18 per cent; and
Stanford returned an even higher
percentage for the losing candidate:
Hoover, 63 per cent; Roosevelt, 29
per cent; Thomas, 15 per cent.
The Young Democrats are quali
fying the import of these straw votes
by pointing to polls taken which tend
to indicate that the higher your
"bawl-out" average, the greater is
the likelihood that you are a sup
porter of the President. Polling sen
iors who won Lower Division honors
at the end of their sophomore year.
Daily reporters found that these
scholastic smoothies were for Roo
sevelt 9 to 4.
Another poll that they took of
the fraternity with the lowest bawl
out average last year favored Lan
don 7 to 2.
The battle is on. The Democrats
and the Republicans, fighting a war
of little importance with heroic
marches and countermarches, hut
to the man from Mars it looks like
a case of the Ins against the Outs.

THE PJAN from Mars, the cur
rent all-American Mud Fight is
nothing more than a bit of nose
thumbing and thumb-waggling; to
the embryonic ward heelers on the
Stanford campus, it is an all-im
portant battle of right vs. wrong in
volving basic principles.
The Young Democrats already
have had a dance down at the Com
munity Center. The Young Repub
licans, a little slower on the draw,
promise a jolly-up "sometime in the
near future" but throw in an added

Tonight, Coach John Bunn and
Captain Dinty Moore of the Stan
ford basketball team will appear on
KGO at 11:00 with Nibs Price and
John Rathbone of the Cal team. The

Republicans, will certainly not de

Democrats Ballyhoo
The Young Democrats, organized
35-50 strong last week, have already
been besieging the Daily office with

GROUP 1 — Lower Division
honor students, 1934-35
Bau lout average, 1.30
For Roosevelt, 70 per cent
For Landon, 30 per cent
Ratio Roosevelt to Landon,
9-4
Contacted, 35 per cent
GROUP 2—Fraternity X

For Roosevelt, 22 per cent
For Landon, 78 per cent
Ratio Roosevelt to Landon.

ballyhoo. The Young Republicans,
though not definitely organized,
claim a signed-up membership of
175. Both young groups are backed
quite vigorously by campaign man
agers sitting in offices downtown in
Palo Alto.
When it is realized that both
groups are appealing to a politically
impotent group, there is cause to
wonder, why all the fuss about poli
tics on the campus? Only the sen
iors, or about one-fourth of the
undergraduates, are old enough to
vote (and drink). Less than one
fourth of them will vote, because
they are too far away from their
legal residence and too lazy to send
for an absentee ballot. Yet, the
Young Republican party is spend
ing money on radio talks every
Monday night that have a direct ap
peal to collegians.
Plainly, the interest of the Re
publicans is in the straw ballot that
will be taken on the campus. There
is a reason for this. There is a great
value to a party in a university
straw vote, because this somewhat
compact group is easy to poll, and
university students are assumed to
be educated.
Still for Hoover
And Republicans are justified in
assuming that a poll of Stanfordites
will give a Republican result. Last
election, when there was a great
Roosevelt landslide elsewhere, 31
college campi all over the country
returned a straw vote result of Hoo
ver, 4!) per cent; Roosevelt, 31 per
cent; and Thomas, 18 per cent; and
Stanford returned an even higher
percentage for the losing candidate:
Hoover, 63 per cent; Roosevelt, 29
per cent; Thomas, 15 per cent.
The Young Democrats are quali
fying the import of these straw votes
by pointing to polls taken which tend
to indicate that the higher your
"bawl-out" average, the greater is
the likelihood that you are a sup
porter of the President. Polling sen
iors who won Lower Division honors
at the end of their sophomore year.
Daily reporters found that these
scholastic smoothies were for Roo
sevelt 9 to 4.
