# Houses Hold Annual Pre-Rush Warm-Up
## 
### 
RUSHING starts earlier this year, which means*
1 that Hell Week, more euphemistically called pre-ini
tiation period, has been held earlier in most fraternities.
A few black and blue spots have been seen in Encina Gym
showers. Fraternity sophomores, if they have shown up
in classes at all, have looked haggard and worn, and have
set their jaws, looking neither to right nor left.
In most of the houses, Hell Week is now over. The
newly initiated sophomores may now go to sleep for pe
riods of longer than five minutes with the secure feeling
that when midnight or 1 o'clock arrives they will not be
dragged out of bed to push peanuts around the living
room floor with their noses on which have been sprinkled
garlic powder or pepper.
Loss of Sleep
Most fraternity Hell Weeks ostensibly last from four
to six days, which means that froiTi now on sophomores
must look forward to catching up on a week's worth of
studying and a week's worth of sleep, all the while trying
to carry the current week's worth of studying and get the
current week's worth of sleep. And don't forget: rushing
starts Friday morning.
Hell Weeks vary greatly in content from house to
house. Theoretically, public humiliation of the sophomore
and destruction of private property have all been banned
by-mutual agreement of members of the Interfratemity
Council. According to present rules, all pre-initiation
work must be done inside the houses.
There rules, though, are still not strictly followed, and
thei-e are many houses that retain the traditional quest
night; in which practice, sophomores are sent scouring the
country at 2 o'clock in the morning for such objects as
feminine underclothing or phonograph recordings of ques
tionable songs. Men are still dumped back in the hills
adn required to return to the house barefooted.
Nerve-wracking
Despite individual variations, Hell Week is based on a
certain, universal formula. It involves the placing of the
neophyte under a physical and nervous strain, the arous-

ing of intense emotions of fear or<
pain or both, the subjection nf the
individual to as complete isolation as
possible. Physical strain is brought
about sometimes by paddling, but
primarily through loss of sleep, or
such ordeals as being required to
stand or sit up perfectly straight fox
long periods of time.
In very few of the houses does
paddling take the principal role,
these days. Anticipatory fear of pad
dling and tubbing is used much
more effectively than paddling it
self. And the houses that do the
most are the ones that would be least
expected to.
Mental Strain
The general weight of Hell Week
falls on mental strain. Since the
frosh is usually isolated from all
members of the house by the no
talking rule, he feels acutely his own
inferiority, his own loneliness. The
seeming solidarity of the upperclass
men, the sternness with which they
treat the matter glosses over the lud
icrousness of Hell Week practices
and initiation ritual. The sophomore
is required to memorize fraternity
and campus lore, songs and rituals.
He is usually given a test under try
ing circumstances, facing bright
lights that blind him by shining di
rectly in his face. In some houses
he is told that he is one of the few
that flunked the examination, and
humiliation and self-abasement fol
low. The fraternity at this time be
comes the most important thing in
his life. The esoteric rites, the songs

ho has been unable to sing under the
strain of the examination, all seem 5
to indicate that this is a very worthy
group of comrades, the group seems
to stand for something very im
portant.
Objectives
A certain class of conscientious
objectors yearly take it upon them
selevs to point out that a Hell Week
works for nothing but misery. But
as far as the fraternity itself goes,
Hell Week has a very definite ob
jective.
Taking a gander at the Encyclo
paedia of Social Sciences resting
quietly in the Libe's Periodical
Room, we found this quote on the
initiation of such savage tribes as
the Nandi of East Africa and the
Xosa of South Africa: "There is set
up an atmosphere of continuous ex
citement, novelty, and tumult that is
intended to enlist the fervent in
terest of the youth. Put on edge
through ingenious torments, sleep
lessness and nerve-wracking frights,
the candidate becomes keenly sensi
tive to the power of his preceptors
and indelible, lifelong impressions
are made."
Thus do the encyclopaedists say in
long words what the quotes from
sophomores printed here infer: that
Hell Week does bind the class to
| gether; the intense emotional relief
: when it is all over does create a
j strong feeling of friendship for the
! fraternity; it does crcate an acute
: awareness for the power of the
founders of Ihe fraternity and the
j chapter's hierarchy.
As far as Hell Week is concerned,
then, it has a very definite function
for the fraternity. But the question
that ever recurs in the post-Hell
Week periods of a fraternity, when
| the power of upperclassmen is
wielded in no particularly produc
tive manner, when the annual report
of the scholarship committee comes
out, what, exactly, is the function of
(he fraternity itself, or does it have
! one?
