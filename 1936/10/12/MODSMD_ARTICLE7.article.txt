# VANDALISM
## 
### 
A sidelight on the peculiar mental
processes make people want to
disfigure the campus of a college
that is its authentic rival was re
vealed when a freshman walked in
to the Daily shack yesterday.
The freshman was quite per
turbed. lie and four of his Encina
sylum friends had left here at 10:30
Thursday night, landed at the Big C
at 2, painted the monolith a cherry
red.
The next morning they picked up

tho Examiner and were quite dis
gusted to find that the act had been
attributed to some Sacramento J. C.
vandals: so be came in and care
fully elaborated the details of the
journey.
The kind thin?* to do, I suppose,
was to congratulate him.

Civilization is not by any means
an easy thing to attain to. There are
only two ways by which man can
reach it. One is by bring cultured.
The other by being corrupt. Country
people have no opportunity of being
either, so they stagnate. â€” Oscar
Wilde.
