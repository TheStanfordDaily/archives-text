(The lollowinq quotations, necessarily anonymous, represent the opinions
ot Row sophomore men regarding Hell Week. The Editor.)
Oh God no, I can't see this "Hell Week" business. It's all a lot of bunk,
and what's more, I won't stand for it. We even agreed to quit, if any undue
punishment occurred, and certainly if we did go through it, we would stop
it for next year.
But day after day of hard work and strict obeisance plus night after night
of no sleep and making an ass of one's self at the threat of a paddle soon
changes your mind, especially when it's over. And the funny part of it is,
the paddle is seldom used.
Oh, it was hell all night, but the whole system, the paddle and all, are
in fact merely to install into the green soph a terrific nervous tension. It's
just psychological, half anticipation and half perspiration, but when you
look back on it, it's darn good, and one of the best experiences you've ever
had or will have.
In the first place, you don't even know your pledge class with whom
you are going to live for three years until you have had this unifying tie
of friendship imposed upon you. You know each man, his faults and weak
nesses, and he knows yours. Together you try to correct them. That's the
principle, and it works.
More than that, you learn to respect tradition, to have an almost com
plete understanding of every brother, and to resolve in every respect to
raise and not detract from the laurels of the bonded group of which you have
become a member. Such is my experience . . .
I was in iiie fifth minute of my evening slumber when three high and
mighty upper classmen abducted me. They brought my most trembling
body before the supreme tribunal of the Fraternity. Here they impressed me
with the significance of the occasion by a most excellent demonstration of the
power of the paddle.
My sleeping quarters for the remainder of the evening consisted of a
spacious bathroom. There was ample sleeping accommodation for four
people except that we had only three mattresses plus fourteen humble
victims.
Came the morn. We worked the greater part of the day hauling wood
under the kindly supervision of our superiors. They were too kind. That
night their kindliness broke all bonds. They permitted us to eat without
table utensils, showed great concern over the warmth of the seat of our
pants, and fed us Epsom Salts in great doses that our systems might be
lreed of all poisons.
We were precious in the sight of the Upper Classmen, so valuable that
they went 15 miles out of their way to take us for a ride. They forgot to
bring us back, but even so their generosity toward us was boundless. For
had they not coated us with an admirable coat of cornflakes and molasses?
Yes, our breakfasts were already set before us in fact, they were (to
speak literally) upon us.
Hell-th week, alias Clean up-the-Soph Week, really isn't such a bad idea
at all. In the first place, it is inclined to remind us second-year adults that
we are still vulnerable to hair brush methods, and it certainly works won
ders in convincing us that in spite of our dynamic presences the brothers still
own the house.
It's bound to cause sore feelings and sorer posteriors. But it's one of the
remnants of the old school. It's a "Hello" tradition that certainly beats the
accepted one as far as getting in close touch with the oldsters is concerned.
Surely I resented last week. I was raging mad at every one of the
brothers at one time or another. I acted like a damn fool, but they seemed
to enjoy it, and I'm not so sure but what I did too.
