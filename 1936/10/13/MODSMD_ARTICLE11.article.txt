WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP). —
Secretary of Treasury Henry Mor
genthau Jr. announced tonight that
the United States, Great Britain, and
France tomorrow will go on a "new
gold standard" which will rout mon
ey speculators and aid further sta
bilization of world currencies.
The new agreement, under which
the three natibns will permit an ex
change of gold for the conversion of

Proposed Original
• "It is a new gold standard, a way
of doing business which has never
been tried before," Morgenthau
said at a press conference. "In agree
ing to the proposal we took into con
sideration first and always our in
ternal prosperity.
"If, for example, we find that the
agreement and its operations are re
tarding recovery, we'll scrap it. Eng
lapd and France have the same
privilege."
The new plan, Morgenthau said,
differs from the old gold standard in
that it will permit the export of ear
marking of gold only to and between
governments instead of private busi
ness institutions and traders.
Exchange Limited
The United States tonight had
nearly $11,000,000,000 worth of gold.
Under the new plan none of this
gold can be shipped to any country
tomorrow except England and
France. Other countries, however,
may come into the agreement and
thus be permitted to participate in
the exchange of gold.
"The door is wide open," said
Morgenthau. "We're not going out
drumming up business, but we'll
welcome all other countries which
want to participate."
