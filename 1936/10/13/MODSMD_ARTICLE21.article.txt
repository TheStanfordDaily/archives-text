# Roble Vetoes Blind Date Plan; Girls Like To Do Own Hunting
## 
### Janet Gould 
Romancc to the contrary, the Ro
bleites prefer to do their own hunt
ing, or so they said in discussing
j whether they would go in for the
embryo blind date bureau in a big
way.
Many denounced the idea outright,
I some thought it would be fun at first,
j others said that it might be a good
; thing, but the burden of each refniin
| was "not for me."
Fear "Black List"
"It would be a godsend to lots of
shy kids," Nancy Baldwin declared.
"That is, until it degenerated into a
black listâ€”that would make it de
feat its own purpose."
Although many of them believed
that beautiful friendships often grow
out of blind dates, they said the risk
, far out-weighed the benefit. They
j all agreed with Kay Powell's senti
! ments that "you'd hate to draw
| something you couldn't -trust, or
| something."
Want Competent Authority
If, a big If, it were to go through,
l most of the lassies say they would
j demand that some responsible 01-
i ganization be behind it, so that "if
! anything happened we could enm
i plain to some authority." Another
j proviso was that of not being able to
back out with a headache when the
date was undesirable.
Men, the women think, are made
of the same stuff. Why should they
I look up in a register to see what they

are going to take to a show? It's the !
finding of little, overy-day dates
that would ruin a project which [
might be a good idea for, say, two 1
big dances a year.
Opinion Is Adverse
Janet Bont summed up the general
opinion with: The heavy - daters
would use it, maybe, once for a
lark. The awfully nice kids might,
,at first. The shyer ones wouldn't
j touch it with a ten-foot pole. I don't |
: know about the others, but I would
j rather go with someone 1 knew be- \
forehand; and anyway a thing like
j that always gets to be pretty cruel
{ and unfair, even with care."
Would Abuse Plan
Other angles are: The men would
use it most and be the first to abuse
it; it would be like hanging out a j
sign that you couldn't get a man;
pretty soon people would begin to
I pair off on their own and only the
1 pills would be in it; and men are al
ways nicer to girls that they pick out
for themselves.
Gioia Butress upheld the other
side. "There are too many fine peo- ;
p!e in a university who never get
around to meeting each other," she |
J said. "Only about twenty per cent
j of the men go out habitually any
way: the others just hibernate from
] laziness or shyness; also I think the
bureau would tend to minimize the
j he-and-she complex around here, j
I It worked at Cal."
