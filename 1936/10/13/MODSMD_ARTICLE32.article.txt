# Final Ruling On Mud-fight Due Tonight
## Decision Up To Students; Administration Heads Recommend Abolition 
### 
Should an old campus tradition,
the mud fight between the sopho
mores and freshmen, be discontin
ued? That is the question confront
ing the Ex Committee tonight arising
because of strong criticism the fight
has recently received.
Various members of the adminis
tration agree that this annual affair
should be abolished. The objecting
faculty members are lead by Dr.
Thomas Storey, medical adviser of
men.
Dr. Storey believes that too many
participants are injured to make the
fight enjoyable. Dean George Culver
states that if the football coaches do
not permit their players to take part,
it is a fair indication of the rough
ness employed.
Few Interested
"Since only a few students seem
interested, especially sophomores
and freshmen, according to several
faculty members, the final decision
will be left up to the Ex Committee,"
A.S.S.U. President Reynolds said
last night.
In tonight's meeting the committee
will discuss rules and regulations
governing on- and off-campus
dances. There has been some criti
cism of off-campus dances and the
treatment of chaperones.
Send Float to U.C.L.A.
The committee will also discuss
the advisability of sending a float
down to the U.C.L.A. homecoming
game.
Anolher problem concerns the ex
cess ot noise in library corridors.
There have been numerous com
plaints about this interference.
Bulletin Arrangement
A more orderly arrangement of
notices on the bulletin board will
also be planned.
The Ex Committee announces the
election of A.S.S.U. officers to be
held Thursday.
