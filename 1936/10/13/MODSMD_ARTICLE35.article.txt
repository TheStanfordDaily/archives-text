* CLEOPATRA IN COLLEGE
The Buddha of the kitchen brigade
has already answered W. B. M., the
conscientious liberal of yesterday's
Campus Opinion who thinks Bull
Sesher Eisenbach is being a suckel
for our charm-school president of
the U.S.A.
With that matter taken care of, it
leaves Klauber in the front office
waxing the pants off some blowy
sports columnist up north and me
out here falling back on the first
member of the famous sex-i'um
gralt trio for the topic of today's

In the paper the other day there
was a story about some U.C. senior
who was so devoted to his studies
that his wife asks a divorce on the
grounds of cruelty and neglect. Since
their marriage in 1932 he hasn't
taken his eyes from his texts. She
wants 20 dollars a month for support
of their 2-year-old daughter.
The case has not come to court
yet, and besides the judge's name is
not mentioned, so I am not liable to
contempt of court for putting in my
two cents to the effect that if the
judge gives her the divorce, he is be
ing a traitor to the male half of the
human race.
* * *
It has been observed that woman
is a changeable creature and more
than one person has slipped con
-1 picuously in assuming that all fe
males operate on the same principles.
But saying that woman is an absorb
ing and demanding organism is not
so much an assumption as an estab
lished certainty that has been fla
grantly demonstrated since the
palmy days when Cleopatra lolled on
the silken cushions of a Nile barge.
Antony lost Rome and eventually
his life over the royal Egyptian
witch. All the obscure hero of to
day's fable stands to lose is a college
degree, but the principle demon
strated in both cases is the same,
namely, that it seems beyond the
comprehension of a woman to under
stand that woman is not the life and
soul of a man, although the reverse
is reputedly true. It would be just
like the type of woman who is suing
her student-husband for divorce
that two years from now she would
whimper that her husband didn't
care enough about her to educate
himself for a better job.

Schopenhauer, who was a miser
able-looking grouch who swore at,
but not off, women for life when he
found they did not esteem Scho
penhauer as esteemed Schopenhauer,
could rise in righteous wrath over
the way some men around here give
up a whole lot of more enlightening
activities to satisfy the demands of
some woman with an abnormal crav
ing for attention.
But then there are no Schopen
hauers around here—not many any
way—just a few disgustingly disin
terested spectators who insist that
those gents who make saps of them
selevs over a woman are saps by
their own choice.

Schopenhauer, who was a miser
able-looking grouch who swore at,

found they did not esteem Scho
penhauer as esteemed Schopenhauer,
could rise in righteous wrath over
the way some men around here give
up a whole lot of more enlightening
activities to satisfy the demands of
some woman with an abnormal crav

But then there are no Schopen

those gents who make saps of them

The Buddha of the kitchen brigade

Sesher Eisenbach is being a suckel

In the paper the other day there
was a story about some U.C. senior
who was so devoted to his studies
that his wife asks a divorce on the
grounds of cruelty and neglect. Since
their marriage in 1932 he hasn't
taken his eyes from his texts. She
wants 20 dollars a month for support
of their 2-year-old daughter.
The case has not come to court
yet, and besides the judge's name is
not mentioned, so I am not liable to
contempt of court for putting in my
two cents to the effect that if the
judge gives her the divorce, he is be
ing a traitor to the male half of the
human race.

It has been observed that woman
is a changeable creature and more
than one person has slipped con
-1 picuously in assuming that all fe
males operate on the same principles.
But saying that woman is an absorb

so much an assumption as an estab
lished certainty that has been fla
grantly demonstrated since the
palmy days when Cleopatra lolled on
the silken cushions of a Nile barge.
Antony lost Rome and eventually
his life over the royal Egyptian
witch. All the obscure hero of to
