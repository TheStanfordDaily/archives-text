# New Maritime Parley Eases Wharf Tension
## U.S. May Present New Peace Plan in Effort To Block Shutdown 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 12 (UP).
â€”Negotiations of new contracts for
Pacific Coast ship and waterfront
workers today brought agreements
on several minor details and
strengthened hopes that a shipping
shutdown would be avoided by
complete agreement or continued
truce October 15.
The International Longshoremen's
Association and coast committee of
employers reached an agreement on
technical details of a pay schedule
for handling "penalty cargoes," those
which are essentially or unusually
difficult to load or unload.
It also was reported the National
Maritime Commission had asked the
I.L.A. to agree to discipline its mem
bers for violations of contract terms
and that the union had pledged its
word to work out a plan.
It was learned last night the new
Federal Martime Commission would
not come to the Pacific Coast, but
might submit a peace proposal of its
own within a few days.
Edward F. McGrady, Assistant
Secretary of Labor, will remain on
the Coast. Prospects for peace or a
continuation of the truce are better
now than they have been for some
time, he said today.
