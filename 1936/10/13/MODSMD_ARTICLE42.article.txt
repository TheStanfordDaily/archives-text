# Brigham Young Descendant More Interesting Than Engine

History flf the past and pulchri
tude of the present are combined in
the above photo, which represents
another epoch in the color-story of
Stanford. The locomotive is the
"Governor Stanford," which made
the first transcontinental crossing in
1863. Among those participating in
the driving of the golden spike at
Ogden, Utah, were Senator Stanford
and Brigham Young, famous Mor
mon pioneer.
But the smiling lady in the pic
ture may be of more interest than
the aging engine. She is Cecilia
("Pete") Young, great-granddaugh
ter of the illustrious Brigham, and
prominent member of Roble society.
To her friends she is better known
by the misnomer of Pete Smith, a
situation which causes considerable
confusion to telephone operators at
Roble.
Enjoys Dancing
Dancing is Pete's favorite form of
recreation. Horseback riding also at
tracts her, but she has been tempo
rarily forced off the bridle path—
result of too many hard jolts in the
saddle.
Miss Young is also interested in
music—so absorbed in it that she was
moved to try out for the Women's
Glee Club. When Director Ray
mond Kendall heard Brigham's off
shoot sing, he, too, was moved. She
announced herself as a second so
prano, but upon hearing her voice,
Mr. Kendall suggested an attempt at
alto.
Wants Good Grades
Queried as to what she hoped to
do here, the pioneer's spunky de
scendant replied that she hoped to
have a good time socially and do
well academically.# Asked in which
of these she wished success most,
"Pete" answered, "Good grades come
first." There was a slight note of
insincerity in her voice, however.
