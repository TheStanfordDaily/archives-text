# Frosh To Meet Stanford Gravs
## 
### 
With another win safely tucked
away in their fast-filling victory va
lise, the frosh took a light workout
yesterday. Opposition for the com
ing week-end will be provided by
the Stanford Grays and the boys do
not regard this one as a crucial.
Coach Harry Shipkey was well
pleased with the work of his end
Hugh Gallerneau in last Saturday's
game against the Black Foxe team.
The guards also made a good show
ing—Ernie Damamarus, Norman Ju
ney, and "Boots" Bardin being out
standing.
Howard Hickingbotham, fullback,
reached his best form of the season,
and Peel's, new end, also looked
good. Bob Young performed in a
highly satisfactory manner at left
tackle until an injury forced his re

moval from the game.
Biggest casualty of the Black Foxe
game was center Hugh Radke, who
sustained an injured twelfth rib.
Radke's injury leaves the center spot
Shipkey's most vexing problem. De-
Maily may be shifted from tackle to
the pivot position in an effort to
bolster the weakness.
Larry Rouble, assistant coach, was
injured in a scrimmage with some of
the subs yesterday, and took consid
erable kidding from the boys who
chided him for being "soft."
Chet Patton remains on the side
lines with an ankle injury, but it
is hoped that he will be ready for
action before the U.C.L.A. game two
weeks hence. Meanwhile G rover,
Parker, and Hickingbotham continue
their fight for the fullback job.
