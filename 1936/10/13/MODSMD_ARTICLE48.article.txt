FOLKS, MEET
HILLY STEPP
Here's a column by a Billy Stepp |
clipped out of the Portland News- '
Telegram. My Portland friends tell j
me not to wax up about it though, I
as he is always moaning and bitch- j
ing about Stanford and nobody pays
any attention to him any more.
But Stepp, anyhow, drools on
about Stanford being "today the in
cubator for football 'cry-baby' . . .
they win with a smile and inflated
heads but they lose with a growl and
an alibi . . . proved beyond a doubt
lhat Stanford hasn't the intestinal
fortitude to smile and say the best
team won . . . strike if Bobby Mor
ris is allowed to officiate any more
of their games . . . how would they
like it if other squads would decide
not to play Stanford any more . . .
football fans of (Portland) like to
see real, true college teams play but
don't care to sit through GO minutes
of football with a bunch of squawk- 1
ers on .one side ..."
And on he goes, about Pop War
ner, and throwing bottles at Gray- J
son, and striking below the belt, and i
Brigham's (ouchdown being a laugh,
far into the night, till finally, '"Yes,
Stanford, a couple of more boos . . .
once the toast of the coast, but now
the roast of the toast."
Well, Billy, if you don't like it, you
can take it and . . .
IT WASN'T
ALL YOUR FAULT
First, wise up and get your dope
straight. I admit the S.F. papers
should serve as accurate records, but
here they didn't. Some Stanford men
in the showers were talking to each
other about Bobby Morris. Lots has
probably been said about you in
shower rooms, but little of it is
meant for publication.
The movies and the W.S.C. gradu
ate manager indicated Brigham's
touchdown to be good, and no one at
the game that day will deny that
Morris was swatting flies, or patting
Goddard on the back, or something
similar. Neither seems to me to be
exactly "laughs."
The team and coaches have had
nothing but praise for Goddard and
the rest of the Cougars ever since
they got home. It has been a lot
less than failing to compliment the
better team: they have even soothed
it off by the fact that they were
beaten by a better team,
I repeat my words of a week ago—
Tiny Thornhill didn't hear about the
"strike" until 12 hours after he was
home, and the boys, already aware
that something had been cooked up,
were as quiet as doorknobs when

they got off the train—you couldn't
get a whisper from them about Bub
Morris.
HAS THERE BEEN
A FORMAL BEEF?
Note also, Stepp, that as Tiny pre- ,
dieted his first day home, no pro- 1
test or evidence in support of one has J
been sent to Dana or Morris from
Stanford; instead, a note of apology
for news stories beyond our control I
and possible defamation of Morris's j
character was wired up.
Is this a strike below the belt? Is
it regular procedure for "football \
cry-babies?"
I
If the "football cry-babies are i
fast on the alibi draw, why did they j
work their fool heads off up there j
when 14 points behind a team that j
looked to have them hopelessly sub
dued?
When before Stepp, in the reign of
the present team, the present coach- j
ing staff, the present student body, i
has there been anything approaching j
a beef after losing a game? Remem- j
ber also, kid, that the "Vowing
Sophs" lost some too, and having a |
bigger rep to uphold, should have
been well practiced at alibis.
And how come so many of your
best men, Grayson, Olcott, DeWitt,
Zagar, Collins, Anderson, Coldiron,
Patton, all of them brave the scof
fing of your clientele and come 700
miles to play football with a bunch i
of cry-babies?
Stepp, your last paragraph cinches ;
your story. We never at Stanford !
boo anybody, because we consider it I
cry-baby-like. —Klauber
