# Tankmen Meet Bruins Friday
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference cham
pions, the U.C.L.A. Bruins come out
of their lair in the southland Friday
for an invasion of the Indian water
hole in an attempt to sink Coach
Nort Thornton's varsity water polo
ists.
The southerners whipped the
Cards twice last year on their way
to an undefeated season, but the loss
of five first string players is going to
tell heavily when Thornton throws
in a heavy, fast, veteran team against
the invaders.
Leading the Bruins will be Dixon
Fiske, forward, who was a member
of the Olympic Games team in Berlin
this summer.
