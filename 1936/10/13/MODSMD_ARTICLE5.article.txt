# Short Change Artist 'Takes' Union Cashier
## 
### 
"Change a ten" queried a dark,
thick-set individual of Marie Brown,
union cellar cashier, yesterday
morning. While the ones and fives
were being rung up, to the accom
paniment of a running patter, the
stranger absconded with a five dol
lar bill.
His method was to talk rapidly
and switch bills as if assisting in the
change-making process. The office
advised the victim to charge up the
crime to profit and loss as no legal
case existed.
Marie doesn't care so much about
the money; it's the principle of the
thing. She has never been short
changed before.
