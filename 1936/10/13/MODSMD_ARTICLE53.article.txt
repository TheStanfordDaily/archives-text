# TINY CALLS U.S.C. GAME EVEN; STARTS SECRET WORKOUTS
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Tiny Thornhill wishes it known in
no uncertain terms that there's going
to be a battle in the Stanford sta
dium a week from this Saturday—a
fiercer struggle than most dopesters
anticipate.
Thornhill is referring to none
['other than the Indian-Trojan con
j test, and he usually means what he
I says. Realizing that last Saturday's
7-7 tie against the Webfeet seems to
have cooled a lot of gridiron en
' thusiasm on the Farm, Tiny was j
quick to point out that the Cardinals j
suffered a complete letdown after the i
Washington State game.
Oregon Underrated
"Our boys were thinking about
last week all during practice," he
added. "Furthermore, Oregon was
vastly underrated, and that combi
nation did us no good. We'll play far
better against the Trojans. We have
two weeks to prepare for it and I'm
hoping I'm right when I say we'll
do plenty in the ball game."
As if to add emphasis to his re
marks and also to buckle down to
intensive work immediately, he made
the somewhat startling announce
ment that the practice field will no
longer be open to students. News
men and properly identified alumni
may get through the gates from now
on, but no others may pass.
Breaks 3-ycar Rule
The fact that he's breaking a tra-
I dition of three-year standing if he
J sends the Redskins through work

outs in seclusion, seems to bother I
Thornhill not at all. The fact that
Pop Warner was criticized on several
occasions for locking up the field |
bothers him less, for he feels that a !
serious enough situation has arisen !
to warrant the move.
Furthermore, the gaudy-hatted
mentor is of the opinion that last
week's so-called football rally on
the fiu'd fell pretty flat. Things must
be done and done intensively, he
reasons; there may be startling
changes in the Cardinals' tactics and
he doesn't want details of his battle
plans bandied about.
Denies Fear of Spies
Thornhill has not made any state
ment to the effect that spies may be
on the loose around the Farm prac
tice field. He denies it, in fact. But
he's determined, nevertheless, to
keep the gates shut until after the
contest with Troy and maybe longer,
principally to impress the boys that
they are in a serious business.
Back to Work
The squad took a rest yesterday
afternoon, but they'll be down to
business again today and most of
this evening. The program calls for
two on one. blocking, tackling, and
fundamentals up to 7 o'clock all
i week long. The California-U.C.L.A.
tussle will be witnessed by Tiny's
class in gridiron arts this week-end
at Berkeley, and that's all the details
of the week's program to be released
so far.

The Indians came out of the Web
foot melee with but a single injury
—Grant Stone suffered a bruised
hip, but he's almost strong enough
for action already and will probably
practice before the end of this week.
