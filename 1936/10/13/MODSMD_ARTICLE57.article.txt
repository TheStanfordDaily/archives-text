# The 						Mud Fight Is Here to Stay Again
## 
### 
May I be the first to congratulate Mr. Bill
Boyd, '36, on his masterpiece of rational think
ing—his Campus opinion printed in Friday's
Daily about the Mud Fight?
Inasmuch as I have not participated in the
Mud Fight and he has, I suppose that I am
poorly equipped to debate the subject of
whether the Mud Fight is fun or not. I can say
that I cannot see why it should be fun to shove
somebody down in the mud, or why it should
be fun to kick somebody in the shins. He, who
has been in the midst of the fray, says it is
fun. Since he is a competent witness, we take
his word for it. That still does not explain,
though, why every year, despite the tub
thumping efforts of the sophomore Mud Fight
captains, fewer and fewer sophomores bother
to turn out.
Every year the soph captain harangue the
class with such appeals to a nonexistent soph
omore group consciousness as Pete Fay's Fri
day statement: "We're not going to skip the
chance to be the first class to win the fight both
in our frosh and soph years." As if the sopho
mores really care who wins. Because every
year the freshmen win. And they win because
they muster the larger number of students.
They muster large numbers of students,
because freshmen are still in the half-savage
stage and are apt to worship blindly before
the graven images of Tradition and they are
also much more easily organized, persuaded,
and shamed into participating.
Mr. Boyd's analysis does not include an ex
planation of how the freshmen make friends
with other freshmen by shoving a sophomore
in the face, or how lasting any such friend
ships should be.
But there's no need to kid ourselves, Mr.
Boyd. No matter who's analysis is correct or
incorrect those poor misguided souls who
think Traditions should remain because they
are Traditions, but who are too busy suffering
the effete ones to create some new and vital
ones will see that the Mud Fight Lives On!
