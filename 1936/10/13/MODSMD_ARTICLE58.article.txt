# Filling the Columns
## 
### 
Along about this time of year, if the Daily
editor is very careful, he can start answering
the Campus Opinion columns, and in this man
ner fill up his edit columns without the trouble
of hatching new ideas for the rest of the volume.
Mr. W. B. M. has written in an opinion pub
lished yesterday criticizing Bob Eisenbach be
cause he is a Democrat and establishes that fact
in his Bull Session. W. B. M. says that a cam
pus paper ought to be nonpartisan.
I suspect W. B. M. of being the son of a
professor. It is only an academic mind that
could propound a theory of editorial sterility.
The rationale of the scientific method is pure
objectivity, which carried to its logical conclu
sion is a mind working in a vacuum. The aca
demic approach to politics would predicate a
nonpartisan viewpoint. In other words, if you
have any opinion or basis of opinion do not
admit it. If you see somebody arguing that
high tariffs beneft the country as a whole, do
not dispute it. Let him go out and convince
thousands of other people. As long as you
keep your objectivity, you are doing your bit
for the country.
Now Mr. Eisenbach is one of those fortunate
individuals who feels that there will be a dif
ference if his side is elected. Mr. Klauber of
the sports page, on the other hand, is a lef
fersonian Republican, and he feels that right
ousness is with his side. He is free to fill his
columns with all the propaganda he pleases.
The editor, being a muddleheaded liberal, will
be objective, but that's his only reason.
None of us will change the course of the
world, or the votes of the Stanford student
body, but if any Republicans would like to
try by scientific method or otherwise, the Cam
pus Opinion columns are open to them.
