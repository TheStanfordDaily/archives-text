# Stanford—On Football
## 
### 
"It just takes on a fly in soup to spoil the
bowlfull"—Samuel Pepys. At least it took only
the sour pen of one sports writer to again reveal
Stanford as a bad loser.
Embittered over Stanford's second defeat,
so early in the football season, said sports writer
faced the possibility of having to write some
thing inglorious about his pet football team.
To escape, he chose the story that Bobby Mor
ris, the Pacific Coast's most popular judge of

gridiron plays, had directed the offense of
W.S.C. last Saturday. . . .
Nearly every college in the Pacific Coast
Conference envies Stanford's conference his
tory. But these episodes of war cries are not
to be coveted by any one of them.
Back in 1925 when Washington defeated the
Indians after Ernie Nevers was carried from
the field as the result of a tackle by Ail-Ameri
can George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, Stan
ford won fame with its first war cry. In 1927
after losing 16-0 to St. Mary's, they cried "foul
play" and wiped the Saints off their schedule
for good.
When they won the Rose Bowl game last
year, Stanford agreed that Bobby Morris, who
was chosen to referee the game, was "one of
the best."
It can't be that every team must violate good
football to beat these Indians. Stanford, your
war cry may be loud; but it's beginning to go
in one ear and out the other.—From University
of Washington Daily
