# BULL SESSION
## THE 						MEN WHO ... 
### 
In yesterday's Daily Tabby we have the gripe of
W. B. M., who derides Bull Sessioner's praise of the
Democrats' pre-election performance, and hopes that
he is not "going to support Mr. Roosevelt because he
has pictured the latter as a sort of matinee idol or
because Mr. Farley is a 'lovable ass'."
* * * *
Now Bull Sessioner is sorry, but he is going to sup
port Mr. Roosevelt for just that reason. He believes
the big trouble with politics is that they're taken se
riously by people who aren't used to thinking outside
the bathroom.
Too many Americans are today listening to the
roars of Knox and the chirps of Roosevelt as gospel
truth. Seldom does it occur to them that such noises
have been pitched to sound serious, and therefore
aren't.
« * * *
Roosevelt knows he can't continue to hold down
old-line business. And Knox knows he can't rescind
the reciprocal trade agreements without wreaking con
siderable hardship on both business and agriculture.
When both of them say just the opposite, college stu
dents are supposed to remember that this is just a
political campaign—not to forget what little econ was
beaten into them.
And that's why Bull Sessioner has indulged in
"witty persiflage." Largely because you can't write
like a political observer on something that needs a
dramatic critic.
* * * *
As for the fact that there are some people at Stan
ford who will vote for Landon, it should be self
evident.
There are also some people at Stanford, W. B. M.,
who still think that what's in a textbook and what goes
on in business are two separate things. Like their
parents, they are too conscious of college as merely a
polisher, not as a keen abrasive that digs down into
your and my false stereotypes of what it's all about.
They'll take the polish, thank you, and follow papa's
advice.
Papa, you remember, is the man who lost his pants
in 1929 and is screaming now for the opportunity to
lose them again, with Landon and Knox, who will
probably be caught with their pants down.
* * * #
Lastly, W. B. M. lauds Mr. Knox because "He's the
first vice-presidential nominee that we have heard
from in a long time." Now you don't hear Mr. Knox.
You sense him, like an oil well explosion. And be
cause he's the first vice-presidential nominee whom
we've heard from won't win him a free pack of Philip
Morris'. Mr. Muffle Argenbright, our cleaning man, is
the most hearable person in America at 7 o'clock
Tuesday morning. But I wouldn't nominate him, and
I don't want to hear him.
Let us be content, W. B. M., with a synopsis: The
Democrats have screwed the country up, and the Re
publicans want to screw it down.

we've heard from won't win him a free pack of Philip
Morris'. Mr. Muffle Argenbright, our cleaning man, is
the most hearable person in America at 7 o'clock
Tuesday morning. But I wouldn't nominate him, and
I don't want to hear him.
Let us be content, W. B. M., with a synopsis: The
Democrats have screwed the country up, and the Re
publicans want to screw it down.

In yesterday's Daily Tabby we have the gripe of
W. B. M., who derides Bull Sessioner's praise of the
Democrats' pre-election performance, and hopes that
he is not "going to support Mr. Roosevelt because he
has pictured the latter as a sort of matinee idol or
because Mr. Farley is a 'lovable ass'."
* * * *
Now Bull Sessioner is sorry, but he is going to sup
port Mr. Roosevelt for just that reason. He believes
the big trouble with politics is that they're taken se
riously by people who aren't used to thinking outside
the bathroom.
Too many Americans are today listening to the
roars of Knox and the chirps of Roosevelt as gospel
truth. Seldom does it occur to them that such noises
have been pitched to sound serious, and therefore
aren't.
« * * *
Roosevelt knows he can't continue to hold down
old-line business. And Knox knows he can't rescind
the reciprocal trade agreements without wreaking con
siderable hardship on both business and agriculture.
When both of them say just the opposite, college stu
dents are supposed to remember that this is just a
political campaign—not to forget what little econ was
beaten into them.
And that's why Bull Sessioner has indulged in
"witty persiflage." Largely because you can't write
like a political observer on something that needs a
dramatic critic.
* * * *
As for the fact that there are some people at Stan
ford who will vote for Landon, it should be self
evident.
There are also some people at Stanford, W. B. M.,
who still think that what's in a textbook and what goes
on in business are two separate things. Like their
parents, they are too conscious of college as merely a
polisher, not as a keen abrasive that digs down into
your and my false stereotypes of what it's all about.
They'll take the polish, thank you, and follow papa's
advice.
Papa, you remember, is the man who lost his pants
in 1929 and is screaming now for the opportunity to
lose them again, with Landon and Knox, who will
probably be caught with their pants down.
* * * #
Lastly, W. B. M. lauds Mr. Knox because "He's the
first vice-presidential nominee that we have heard
from in a long time." Now you don't hear Mr. Knox.
You sense him, like an oil well explosion. And be
cause he's the first vice-presidential nominee whom
we've heard from won't win him a free pack of Philip
Morris'. Mr. Muffle Argenbright, our cleaning man, is
the most hearable person in America at 7 o'clock
