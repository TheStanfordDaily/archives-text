Back in the days when edits used neither "I" nor
"we," and made at least a pretense of saying some
thing, there was a campaign carried on by The Dippy to
have the library open on Sunday night. The library
then carried on a campaign and found The Dippy wide
open every night. Anyway, Friday night in the libe
remains unchanged in that category of beautiful mem
ories and Stanford traditions—perfectly beautiful and
lovely, but useless.
Freshmen are not supposed to know about last
year's campaigns, or this year's either, for that matter,
but they should know something. However, two of
them got confused about this library business, and
walked over Sunday night to study.
The doors, of course, were locked, but this didn't
stop them. They wanted to study and they were going
to study. (You notice there is no interest manifested
here in the Mud Fight.) So they broke in the Library
and walked inside.
They were quite surprised that no English instruc
tors jumped out at them from behind the pillars, there
was no sirocco or tornado blowing down the hall, the
radiators were not pounding, and there were no
smoothies on the second floor yowling down to gels on
the first floor for dates; in fact, atmospheric conditions
were perfect, and the place actually sounded like a
library should sound.
So they quite naturally ascended the stairs in high
hopes of a round of beating the books. But the books
couldn't be beaten. One of the library's Ph.D. janitors
pulled Ihem over to the curb and carefully explained
that the frivolity of the week nights ends on Sunday
nights, and the serious business of janitoring begins. In
short, he threw them out.

There is an eating club at Stanford by the name of
Breakers. Quite frequently Breakers graduate or leave
school (honorable dismissal, of course) so that there
is always room for a new man. providing that he is
the Breaker typo, though the actions of such long line
of Daily journalists as Kellog, Hamilton, Beaubaire,
Letts, and Klauber would indicate that the type is
somewhat pied.
The head glutton of the eatery clubbery arose last
Thursday night and requested that the members stay
late so that they could vote on Joe Pinwheel, who
would be a very desirable addition. All eyes turned
on Joe Pinwheel, who was quietly munching a lamb
chop in the corner. Joe Pinwheel, not knowing what
else to do, neglected to remain for the after-dinner
session. Despite his haste, the members assembled
after dinner, munched thoir lamb chops, and decided
that Joe* Pinwheel would be a very desirable addition,
and Friday, this fact was announced in The Daily.

to study. (You notice there is no interest manifested
here in the Mud Fight.) So they broke in the Library
and walked inside.
They were quite surprised that no English instruc
tors jumped out at them from behind the pillars, there
was no sirocco or tornado blowing down the hall, the
radiators were not pounding, and there were no
smoothies on the second floor yowling down to gels on
the first floor for dates; in fact, atmospheric conditions
were perfect, and the place actually sounded like a
library should sound.
So they quite naturally ascended the stairs in high
hopes of a round of beating the books. But the books
couldn't be beaten. One of the library's Ph.D. janitors
pulled Ihem over to the curb and carefully explained
that the frivolity of the week nights ends on Sunday
nights, and the serious business of janitoring begins. In
short, he threw them out.

There is an eating club at Stanford by the name of
Breakers. Quite frequently Breakers graduate or leave
school (honorable dismissal, of course) so that there
is always room for a new man. providing that he is
the Breaker typo, though the actions of such long line
of Daily journalists as Kellog, Hamilton, Beaubaire,
Letts, and Klauber would indicate that the type is
somewhat pied.
The head glutton of the eatery clubbery arose last
Thursday night and requested that the members stay
late so that they could vote on Joe Pinwheel, who
would be a very desirable addition. All eyes turned
on Joe Pinwheel, who was quietly munching a lamb
chop in the corner. Joe Pinwheel, not knowing what
else to do, neglected to remain for the after-dinner
session. Despite his haste, the members assembled
after dinner, munched thoir lamb chops, and decided
that Joe* Pinwheel would be a very desirable addition,
and Friday, this fact was announced in The Daily.
Back in the days when edits used neither "I" nor
"we," and made at least a pretense of saying some
thing, there was a campaign carried on by The Dippy to
have the library open on Sunday night. The library
then carried on a campaign and found The Dippy wide
open every night. Anyway, Friday night in the libe
remains unchanged in that category of beautiful mem
ories and Stanford traditions—perfectly beautiful and
lovely, but useless.
Freshmen are not supposed to know about last
year's campaigns, or this year's either, for that matter,
but they should know something. However, two of
them got confused about this library business, and
walked over Sunday night to study.
The doors, of course, were locked, but this didn't
stop them. They wanted to study and they were going
to study. (You notice there is no interest manifested
here in the Mud Fight.) So they broke in the Library
and walked inside.
