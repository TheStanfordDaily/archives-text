WEEKLY "VARIETY" REWRITE:
The New York Times is burning over
the Journal and World-Telegram
cutting themselevs in on its round
the-world flight story. The Times is
ignoring the other two papers and
their reporters in their write-ups,
while the other two are making a
real race out of it.
BIG NEWS: News services en
gaged in supplying their wares to ra
dio stations are getting plenty of
dough from it. Income to INS, Uni
versal Service, and UP will be three
million dollars this year. The sta
tions themselves will garner 15 mil
lion in selling the news and station
time to sponsors.
A TREMENDOUS BOOM in the
phonograph record business is re
ported by the RCA-Victor people.
Record sales are up 300 per cent over
last year. Two reasons are given for
the rise of record sales: a large in
crease in automatic phonograph in
stallations in post-Repeal drinking
salons (joints to you); and a similar
increase in risque and bawdy tune
sales, ranging all the way from
$1.50 special releases to the "xace"
records on the 35-cent labels all
companies feature in addition to
their standard 75-cent discs. Some
of 'em, ,by the way, are pretty
smoky. The phono boys don't like
publicity on the dirty discs, but
they're perfectly willing to garner
the substantial coin they bring.
HEARST DOWN: Only New York
dailies to lose in circulation during
the past year were the American and
Evening Journal, two of the three
Hearst sheets in the metropolis.
Marks the second successive year of
downbeat for the American.
AROUND THE DIAL: Borah Min
nevitch's Harmonic Rascals and so
prano Anne Jamison join Fred As
taire on KPO at 6:30; Joan Bennett
and Charles Boyer give a radio ver
sion of "Cyrano de Bergerac" on the
Caravan program with Benny Good
man's ork, via KFRC also at 6:30.
