# Coverly Issues NYA Regulations
## 
### 
Mrs. Irene W. Coverly, director of
the employment office, announces
the following rules for NYA work
ers to be observed as effective at
once:
1. NYA workers must fill out re
lease cards at the beginning of each
payroll month.
2. The payroll period begins on
Sunday and ends on Saturday. Pay
roll cards must be in the Account
ing Department on Monday of each
week.
3. Payroll month ends on October
24 at 5 o'clock and runs from the 25th
to the 24th of each succeeding month.
4. Students should figure the num
ber of hours that they will be able
to work each month and notify the
office if the number is less than the
assigned number of hours. Failure
to do this will result in the reduction
of assigned hours for the balance of
the quarter.
5. If the student is not able to
complete the assigned number of
hours for this first period he must
inform the office at once.
6. There is to be no transfer from
one department to another during
the quarter, unless the original
project ends.
7. A notice concerning NYA for
undergraduates refers to Mrs. Cov
erly. A graduate notice concerning
NYA refers to J. E. McDowell, Room
174, Administration Building.
8. Instructors and students should
read NYA instructions carefully con
cerning turning in time sheets.
9. Do not put fractional hours on
the time sheet.
Release Cards Ready
The following people who have
not called for their release cards at
the NYA office must do so this week:
Bob Barnard, Jack Brigham, John
Cherides, Hugh Cramer, Rex Cram
mer, John Emanuel, Bob Falken
hagen, Paul Forman, Charles Giffen,
Don Greenlee, Alvah Horn, Keith
Billman, Allan Kittell, Lous Love,
Floyd March, Elizabeth McGlashen,
Harrison Standley, Anton Tcixeira,
and Nelson Wheeler.
Applications Accepted
Since vacancies are constantly be
ing made by students who have
dropped NYA to accept outside po
sitions, applications are still being
accepted for NYA. Numerous ap
plications were not accepted this
quarter because of summer savings.
However, students are eligible again
in winter quarter. Students who are
not assigned NYA work are still
eligible for other positions.
