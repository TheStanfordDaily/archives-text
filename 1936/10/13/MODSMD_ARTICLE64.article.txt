"OF LENA GEYER," by Marcia
Davenport, Scribner and Sons.
A novel of the life of a nineteenth
century opera singer interesting be
cause it is, in a sense, the life of all
other prima donnas. It records an
era that probably will not return.
Lena Geyer, really Lenzka Gyruz
kova, is the daughter of a Czech
char-woman, is encouraged to take
music lessons by Pizzettia, a voice
teacher. Pizzetti goes to America,
forgets Lena until he discovers her
six years later in a down town hos
pital ill with puerpuerile fever, her
baby dead. He sends her to the
country to recover, finds her a job,
is well repaid when she sings to him;
she has a Voice.
After hard study in New York, a
few minor roles in the Metropolitan,
Lena goes abroad to study in Ger
many under Lilli Lehmann. In a
few years she is known from Cov
ent Garden to St. Petersburg, and
idolized. In Paris she meets the due
de Chartres, lives with him several
years, finally renounces him, rather
picturesquely, for her art.
Lena finally accepts a contract
with the Metropolitan, comes to
America with her friend Elsie de
Haven. Her manager persuades her
to go on tour, but opera is her
milieu; she clings to it until her
breakdown.
Mrs. Davenport has chosen to tell
the story "Of Lena Geyer" through
the eyes of her associates: her hus
band, her lover, her singing master,
and her friend. So perhaps it is her
own fault that they rather over
idolize. We are led to believe each
aria she sang was perfectly con
ceived, which covers a period of 30
years.
The supposed due de Chartres'
stilted, fastidious account of their
love is particularly noxious. The
author sentimentalizes, overglorifies,
justified perhaps by fact, not in fic
tion.
Better than her writing is the au
thor's acquaintanceship with the
musical background for the period,
the accounts of the Salzburg Mozart
festivals directed by Lilli Lehmann,
of Gustave Mahler, Vestri, and Rich
ard Strauss, other operatic stars like
Caruso, Scotti, Farrar, and Frem
stad.

George White's Scandals, brought
from New York, began a two weeks'
stay at the Curran Theater in San
Francisco Sunday night. Novelties,
the usual George White choruses,
good quips, and unusual decors em
bellish the performance.
Willie and Eugene Howard furnish
much of the comedy. Others starred
are Helen Morgan, Earl Oxford,
George Dewey Washington. Sam,
Ted, and Ray, Richard Lane, Estelle
Jayne, Gloria Rich, Fred Manatt,
and the Stanley Twins. Russell Mar
kert staged the dance numbers. Mu
sic and lyrics are by Jack Yellen and
Ray Henderson, settings by Russell

Patterson. Sketches are by George
White and William K. Wells.
Forthcoming films scheduled by
MGM are Greta Garbo and Robert
Taylor in Camille, Jeanette Mac-
Donald, Nelson Eddy in Maytime,
The Thin Man Returns with Myrna
Loy and William Powell, Eleanor
Powell in Born to Dance, Love 011
the Run with Joan Crawford, Clark
Gable, and, hurrah, another Tarzan
epic with Johnny Weismuller.
On display at the San Francisco
Museum of Art until October 31 is
an unusual collection of American
Indian paintings and five centuries of
Oriental and European rugs.

she has a Voice.
After hard study in New York, a
few minor roles in the Metropolitan,
Lena goes abroad to study in Ger
many under Lilli Lehmann. In a
few years she is known from Cov
ent Garden to St. Petersburg, and
idolized. In Paris she meets the due
de Chartres, lives with him several
years, finally renounces him, rather
picturesquely, for her art.
Lena finally accepts a contract
with the Metropolitan, comes to
America with her friend Elsie de
Haven. Her manager persuades her
to go on tour, but opera is her
milieu; she clings to it until her
breakdown.
Mrs. Davenport has chosen to tell
the story "Of Lena Geyer" through
the eyes of her associates: her hus
band, her lover, her singing master,
and her friend. So perhaps it is her
own fault that they rather over
idolize. We are led to believe each
aria she sang was perfectly con
ceived, which covers a period of 30
years.
The supposed due de Chartres'
stilted, fastidious account of their
love is particularly noxious. The
author sentimentalizes, overglorifies,
justified perhaps by fact, not in fic
tion.
Better than her writing is the au
thor's acquaintanceship with the
musical background for the period,
the accounts of the Salzburg Mozart
festivals directed by Lilli Lehmann,
of Gustave Mahler, Vestri, and Rich
ard Strauss, other operatic stars like
Caruso, Scotti, Farrar, and Frem
stad.

George White's Scandals, brought
from New York, began a two weeks'
stay at the Curran Theater in San
Francisco Sunday night. Novelties,
the usual George White choruses,
good quips, and unusual decors em
bellish the performance.
Willie and Eugene Howard furnish
much of the comedy. Others starred
are Helen Morgan, Earl Oxford,
George Dewey Washington. Sam,
Ted, and Ray, Richard Lane, Estelle
Jayne, Gloria Rich, Fred Manatt,
and the Stanley Twins. Russell Mar
kert staged the dance numbers. Mu
sic and lyrics are by Jack Yellen and
Ray Henderson, settings by Russell

Patterson. Sketches are by George
White and William K. Wells.
Forthcoming films scheduled by
MGM are Greta Garbo and Robert
Taylor in Camille, Jeanette Mac-
Donald, Nelson Eddy in Maytime,
The Thin Man Returns with Myrna
Loy and William Powell, Eleanor
Powell in Born to Dance, Love 011
the Run with Joan Crawford, Clark
Gable, and, hurrah, another Tarzan
epic with Johnny Weismuller.
On display at the San Francisco
Museum of Art until October 31 is
an unusual collection of American
Indian paintings and five centuries of
Oriental and European rugs.
"OF LENA GEYER," by Marcia
Davenport, Scribner and Sons.
A novel of the life of a nineteenth
century opera singer interesting be
cause it is, in a sense, the life of all
other prima donnas. It records an
era that probably will not return.
Lena Geyer, really Lenzka Gyruz
kova, is the daughter of a Czech
char-woman, is encouraged to take
music lessons by Pizzettia, a voice
teacher. Pizzetti goes to America,
forgets Lena until he discovers her
six years later in a down town hos
pital ill with puerpuerile fever, her
baby dead. He sends her to the
country to recover, finds her a job,
is well repaid when she sings to him;
she has a Voice.
