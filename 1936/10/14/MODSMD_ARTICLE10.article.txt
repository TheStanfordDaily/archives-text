CITY SHIPPING tie-up was again
temporarily postponed as ship
owners and dock unions agreed to a
truce to last until October 2G.
CANDIDATE LANDON branded
the Roosevelt regime as dictator
ship-bound in his Detroit speech last
night. He pledged his administra
tion, if elected, to strict democracy.
THE PRESIDENT last night spoke
before thousands of Middle-west
prriprc gathered from the very heart
of Landon territory. Striking close
to home for the Kansans, Roosevelt
expressed doubt that the Landon
governed state could have "pulled
through" the last four years without j
New Deal aid.
