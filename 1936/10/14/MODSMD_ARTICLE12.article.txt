# Roosevelt In Landon District
## Kansas Hears G. O. P. Nominee Assailed 
### 
KANSAS CITY. Mo., Oct. 13 (/I 3 ). —
President Roosevelt's special train
arrived in the metropolitan area to
night at 4:27 p.m.
The President and Mrs. Roosevelt
transferred to an automobile for a
five-mile drive to the municipal au
ditorium through streets lined with
an etsimated quarter of a million
spectators from Western Missouri
and Eastern Kansas.
The President came into Missouri
after a whirlwind barnstorming tour
of Kansas, where he ripped into the
Republican leadership with sarcasm
in an effort to win the nine electoral
votes of Governor Landon's home
State.
Covering Kansas from the. Colo
rado line to the eastern boundary,
the chief executive made his prin
cipal stand at Wichita, a Democratic
stronghold. There he refuted charges
of his opposition and claimed, more
over, that they were spreading the
gospel of fear into farms and homes
in an attempt to sabotage the new
deal.
He applied the verbal lash with
less restraint than at any time dur
ing his present extended trip.
"If I ever write another book," Mr.
Roosevelt said, "I am going to have
a chapter in it about bedtime stories
—political bedtime stories. It will be
a very amusing chapter.
"I am going to fill it with whisper
ing ghosts and stalking bogey men,
and I am going to end the chapter by
telling how the American men and
women on the third of November,
1936, refused to be frightened by
fairy tales.
"You folks do not look a bit scared
of me."
