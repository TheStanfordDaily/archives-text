# Moto-Scooter Offers Challenge to Walking Rough
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
One hundred twenty miles to the
gallon. Five hundred on one pint of
oil. And it's been clocked at 32
m.p.h.
That's the funny red scooter with
the putt-putt noise chaperoned by
Irv Weisbuch you see whizzing
around the campus these days. The
Moto-Scooter it's called by the Chi
cago firm which manufactures it.
One Ordered
To date, one of these vehicles has
already been ordered by a Stanford
student who owns an airplane. He
plans to cut the scooter in two, put
hinges on the parts, and sling it into
the cockpit of his plane; then he
can travel in style to and from the
airport. Similar plans are being en
tertained by a_ local yacht owner,
who wants two of the vehicles.

To operate the Moto-Scooter. the
driver runs with it a short distance,
and when the motor catches, jumps
on. A handle-bar throttle regulates
speed; and the only other gadget is a
mechanical brake.
Epidemic Coming?
Is the day approaching when the
Quad will he thick with whizzing,
red. putt - putting Moto-Scooters,
tandem style, with side-cars and
rumble-seat equipped? Or is this
handy little do-jigger to go the way
of bandies, and knock-knocks?
(Editor's note: After writing the
above article, the reporter decided to
try out the Moto-Scooter himself.
But he took a turn for the worse at
30 m.p.h. and was thrown. The
B.A.C. reports four lacerated fin
gers and a bruise of the leg perios
tium as the injuries sustained.)
