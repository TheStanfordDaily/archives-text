## Frosh, Sophs Give Ideas On Contest; Keeping Tradition Is Favored 
### MARGARET LOUD 
While Ex Committee hashed over
the pros and cons of the Soph-Frosh
mudfight last night, freshmen and
sophomores most concerned with the
traditional battle expressed their at
titudes toward it.
Pete Fay, sophomore president,
was especially in favor of continu
ing the fight. "I do not feel that the
injuries bugaboo is a vital argument
against it," he said.
Others who voiced opinions on the
matter were:
Jim Kncuhuhl: "I'm in favor of it.
It gives those who aren't out for
sports a chance to be in an athletic
contest."
Arnold Jones, Encina: "Everyone
in our room is greatly in favor of it.
It gives us a chance to have a little
fun with the sophomores. We have
to let out desire to be a roughneck
once in a while and the mudfight
is a good place to let it out."
Barbara Bauer, Roble: "I think
that a tradition made should not be
broken. A few cuts and bruises
shouldn't hurt a 'rough'! They're not
babies any more."
Bill Arrasmith, Encina: "I'm look
ing forward to a freshman victory.
It's all in the game if you get banged
up. Any freshman who's afraid of
getting banged up should stay as
far away from the mudfight as pos
sible."
Barbara Day: "I didn't go the mud
fight last year, but 1 still think it's a
fine thing."
Jean Thompson, Tri Delt: "It's a
Stanford tradition and for that rea
son alone should be continued. There
have been no serious injuries to the
participants, so the fellows shouldn't
complain."
Jeanne Sichel, Roble: 'I've been
looking forward to seeing a mud
fight. But being a pacifist I would
hate to see anyone hurt, especially a
star football player."
Jack Dickson, Encina: "It's a good
idea, and a swell chance to make up
for the 'passing' comments of the
'39 boys. Tell the sophomores, 'Here
we come!' "
Peg Woodward, secretary of the Jun
ior class: "I think it's a good idea
and should be continued."
Several Encinamen who were con
tacted were more interested in defy
ing the sophs than giving a definite
opinion on the mudfight. Their
thoughts on the subject boil down
to "Nuts to the sophs! Grr."
Connie Boliosky, Roble: "We've
heard of the mud-fight for years and
should continue to hear of it. The
boys fight among themselves volun
tarily, so why shouldn't they do it en
masse and show the rest of the
campus what they are really made
of."
Jack Grovcr, Encina: "I think it a
good idea. I'm sorry football players
can't participate or I certainly
would."
Charles Hayward, Alpha Delt: "I
enjoyed the fight last year. Of
course we'll win."
Bud Met/gar, Phi Psi: "It's a
noble tradition and it adds color
and no one gets hurt."
Jim Fullcrton, Beta: "I don't ap
prove. It's bad enough breaking
your toes when you get into bed. I
bruise easy."
Sam Berkley, Beta: "It's a good
thing, although the excitement
aroused is greater than the fun of
the actual fight."
Lewis Jost, Phi Psi: "Traditions
are dying all too fast as it is, and we
should hold onto this one."
George Cannon, Zete: It's a tradi
tion that shouldn't be broken. It's
a good way to get at the Phi Delt
pledges."
A character named Joe Blow was
also contacted at the Zete House.
He thought the mudfight a very poor
thing, but would offer no other com
ment.

in our room is greatly in favor of it.
It gives us a chance to have a little
fun with the sophomores. We have
to let out desire to be a roughneck
once in a while and the mudfight
is a good place to let it out."
Barbara Bauer, Roble: "I think
that a tradition made should not be
broken. A few cuts and bruises
shouldn't hurt a 'rough'! They're not
babies any more."
Bill Arrasmith, Encina: "I'm look
ing forward to a freshman victory.
It's all in the game if you get banged
up. Any freshman who's afraid of
getting banged up should stay as
far away from the mudfight as pos
sible."
Barbara Day: "I didn't go the mud
fight last year, but 1 still think it's a
fine thing."
Jean Thompson, Tri Delt: "It's a
Stanford tradition and for that rea
son alone should be continued. There
have been no serious injuries to the
participants, so the fellows shouldn't
complain."
Jeanne Sichel, Roble: 'I've been
looking forward to seeing a mud
fight. But being a pacifist I would
hate to see anyone hurt, especially a
star football player."
Jack Dickson, Encina: "It's a good
idea, and a swell chance to make up
for the 'passing' comments of the
'39 boys. Tell the sophomores, 'Here
we come!' "
Peg Woodward, secretary of the Jun
ior class: "I think it's a good idea
and should be continued."
Several Encinamen who were con
tacted were more interested in defy
ing the sophs than giving a definite
opinion on the mudfight. Their
thoughts on the subject boil down
to "Nuts to the sophs! Grr."
Connie Boliosky, Roble: "We've
heard of the mud-fight for years and
should continue to hear of it. The
boys fight among themselves volun
tarily, so why shouldn't they do it en
masse and show the rest of the
campus what they are really made
of."
Jack Grovcr, Encina: "I think it a
good idea. I'm sorry football players
can't participate or I certainly
would."
Charles Hayward, Alpha Delt: "I
enjoyed the fight last year. Of
course we'll win."
Bud Met/gar, Phi Psi: "It's a
noble tradition and it adds color
and no one gets hurt."
Jim Fullcrton, Beta: "I don't ap
prove. It's bad enough breaking
your toes when you get into bed. I
bruise easy."
Sam Berkley, Beta: "It's a good
thing, although the excitement
aroused is greater than the fun of
the actual fight."
Lewis Jost, Phi Psi: "Traditions
are dying all too fast as it is, and we
should hold onto this one."
George Cannon, Zete: It's a tradi
tion that shouldn't be broken. It's
a good way to get at the Phi Delt
pledges."
A character named Joe Blow was
also contacted at the Zete House.
He thought the mudfight a very poor
thing, but would offer no other com
ment.
While Ex Committee hashed over
the pros and cons of the Soph-Frosh
mudfight last night, freshmen and
sophomores most concerned with the
traditional battle expressed their at
titudes toward it.
Pete Fay, sophomore president,
was especially in favor of continu
ing the fight. "I do not feel that the
injuries bugaboo is a vital argument
against it," he said.
Others who voiced opinions on the
matter were:
Jim Kncuhuhl: "I'm in favor of it.
It gives those who aren't out for
sports a chance to be in an athletic
contest."
Arnold Jones, Encina: "Everyone
in our room is greatly in favor of it.
