# Savelle Speaks On Spanish War
## History Professor Sees Fascist Victory 
### 
Professor Maxwell H. Savelle, As
sociate Professor of History, last
night analyzed the Spanish Rebellion
for a group gathered in the Assembly
Hall. Although he was in Spain
only twice, Mr. Savelle had a great
opportunity to waich the situation
and keep in constant contact with
the rebellion.
'"On the Rebel side," said the
speaker, "are the Aristocrats, the
Roman Catholic Church, the Nation
alists, the Industrialists, and re
cently the Fascists. Intellectuals,
Democrats, Socialists, Communists,
Anarchists, and Syndicalists make
up the strength of the Loyalist
party."
At first the rebel groups worked
separately, but they eventually be
came unified under the present heads
pf Fascism and General Franco. The
plan now approved by the rebels,
to be put into effect when they take
power is four-fold: (1) to establish
a dictatorship, based on "the most
severe principles of government,"
(2) to co-operate with the Roman
Catholic Church, (3) to have a gov
ernment run by experts, (4) to re
store and maintain a completely uni
fied Spain.
First, however, General Franco in
tends to set up an economic syndi
calism modeled after the German
Nazi arrangement. It is the belief
of Professor Savelle that, whatever
the outcome of the struggle, a dicta
torship will be set up; that the social
struggle which began as democracy
against reaction has changed around
to one of Socialism versus Fascism;
and that the Fascist movement, i!
successful, will have trouble for
some time.
