# Spring Quarter Tuition To Stay Fixed at $115, Governing Body Rules
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Spring quarter tuition will remain
at $115 instead of being reduced to
$114, Ex Committee ruled last night
in a series of motions which also sent
the disputed frosh-soph mud-fight
to popular vote at tomorrow's spe
cial election.
The "spring dollar" was placed
back on the regular tuition and
community fees because the Com
mittee felt the A.S.S.U. needed the
$3400 difference for student aid
funds and for partial cancellation
of interest on the New Theater
debt.
Ex Committee's motion will be
sent to the Board of Trustees for
final action. The Board last spring
cut the dollar from 1937 spring tui
tion when it had been decided that
the A.S.S.U. would have sufficient
funds without it.
"Students expect to pay $115 all
year around anyway," said Student
Manager Chuck Fontius. "They
thought they were being kidded
when the dollar was dropped for
only one quarter."
SALARIED STUDENT BODY
OFFICERS must register for and
pass 10 units per quarter to receive
their pay checks, the committee
ruled. The motion, tabled from last
week, was made by Fontius after in
vestigation revealed that certain
graduate students had in the past
held down salaried positions without
actually passing any University
work. The Committee felt such of
fices should go to students who were
really at Stanford "for an educa
tion."
CIIAPERONES AT CAMPUS
DANCES are being neglected, Dean
of Women Yost told the committee
in a letter to Reynolds. Miss Yost
suggested (hat the committee take
some action to restore chaperones
the "proper respect."
"Chaperones are absolutely un
necessary at campus dances." de
clared Chick Franich, "and it's hard
on the chaperones. They feel they
have to accept the invitations but
they feel the 'evening is shot'."
Someone told of a dance in the
Pavilion when I lie chaperones were
stuck behind heavy curtains where
they "couldn't hear anything and
couldn't see anything."
Jackie Brown, Ruth Goodan, and
Chick Franich will discuss with Miss
Yost any changes that can be made
in chaperonage regulations for on
and off-campus dances.
TO ELECTION BOARD were ap
pointed Dave Allison, chairman,
Dick Riddell, , Walt Wickctt, Betty
Brock, Helen Zwick, Margaret Mar
shall, John Dern, Ed Barnett, A1

and Nancy Miihauser.
JOLLY-UPS and their woes wenf
under Ex Committee surveillance.
Vice-president Esther Pelton had
noticed "too many wall flowers."
"The leap year jolly-up showed up
just as many wall flowers among the
men," said Shirley Jones.
"1 have found it's hard to get girl;;
to dance," said Reynolds. The com
mittee laughed and the discussion
went no further.

were dropped from the A.S.S.U. ac
counts at Fontius' suggestion.
SPECIAL TRAIN to U.C.L.A. was

ably be $10.25, the same as last year.

$114, Ex Committee ruled last night
in a series of motions which also sent
the disputed frosh-soph mud-fight
to popular vote at tomorrow's spe
cial election.
The "spring dollar" was placed
back on the regular tuition and
community fees because the Com
mittee felt the A.S.S.U. needed the
$3400 difference for student aid
funds and for partial cancellation
of interest on the New Theater
debt.
Ex Committee's motion will be
sent to the Board of Trustees for
final action. The Board last spring
cut the dollar from 1937 spring tui
tion when it had been decided that
the A.S.S.U. would have sufficient
funds without it.
"Students expect to pay $115 all
year around anyway," said Student
Manager Chuck Fontius. "They
thought they were being kidded
when the dollar was dropped for
only one quarter."
SALARIED STUDENT BODY
OFFICERS must register for and
pass 10 units per quarter to receive
their pay checks, the committee
ruled. The motion, tabled from last
week, was made by Fontius after in
vestigation revealed that certain
graduate students had in the past
held down salaried positions without
actually passing any University
work. The Committee felt such of
fices should go to students who were
really at Stanford "for an educa
tion."
CIIAPERONES AT CAMPUS
DANCES are being neglected, Dean
of Women Yost told the committee
in a letter to Reynolds. Miss Yost
suggested (hat the committee take
some action to restore chaperones
the "proper respect."
"Chaperones are absolutely un
necessary at campus dances." de
clared Chick Franich, "and it's hard
on the chaperones. They feel they
have to accept the invitations but
they feel the 'evening is shot'."
Someone told of a dance in the
Pavilion when I lie chaperones were
stuck behind heavy curtains where
they "couldn't hear anything and
couldn't see anything."
Jackie Brown, Ruth Goodan, and
Chick Franich will discuss with Miss
Yost any changes that can be made
in chaperonage regulations for on
and off-campus dances.

Vice-president Esther Pelton had
noticed "too many wall flowers."
"The leap year jolly-up showed up
just as many wall flowers among the
men," said Shirley Jones.
"1 have found it's hard to get girl;;

mittee laughed and the discussion
went no further.
