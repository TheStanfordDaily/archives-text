# Dock Workers Now Awaiting Arbiters' Act
## Decision of Commission Awaited by Maritime Workers, Shipowners 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13 (UP).
â€”Pacific Coast shipowners and rep
resentatives of maritime and dock
unions tonight agreed to a truce in
the maritime crisis until October 26,
forestalling possibilities of a strike
until the Federal Maritime Commis
sion has a chance to study the situa
tion and attempt adjustment.
Shipowners took the lead in ac
cepting the Maritime Commission's
plea that both sides agree to con
tinue operations in the public intei'-
est while attempting to reach new
contracts. The unions, after long
debate, announced their acceptance
several hours later.
The commission is sending a per
sonal representative to the Pacific
Coast to participate directly in the
conferences, which to date have
failed to produce new contracts to
replace those which expired October
1 but which were continued for 15
additional days.
