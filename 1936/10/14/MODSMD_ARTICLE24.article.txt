# Rebel Stronghold To Be Dynamited
## 
### 
HENDAYE, Franco - Spanish
Frontier, Oct. 13 (U.R)â€”Determined
to exterminate the gallant little
Land of Rebels holding out in be
sieged Oviedo, Loyalist Gen. Gon
zales Pena tonight said tons of
dynamite would be used to blow
Oviedo Cathedral, chief Rebel
stronghold, to bits.
The church tower is the highest
in the city and from their posts,
Rebel machine gunners have beaten
off thousands of Asturian "Dyna
initeros" who have reduced almost
all of the Oviedo to a shambles.
If Pena is able to carry out his
plans before a Galician rescue col
umn advances upon the city, he will
leave the cathedral, Oviedo's proud
est possession, a heap of debris.
Only a few hundred men compose
Aranda's garrison, all that are left of
a force of 2,500 after an 86-day siege.
The main body was located in a mu
nitions plant on the east side of the
city and the remainder in the cathe
dral tower.
