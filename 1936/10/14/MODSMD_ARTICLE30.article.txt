# Landon Cries FDR Aiming at Dictatorship
## Nominee Would Protect Rugged Individualism and American Frugality 
### 
NAVIN FIELD, Detroit, Oct. 13
(U.R)—All' M. Landon charged the
New Deal tonight with taking the
"first steps" toward destruction of
American Democracy and substitu
tion of a permanent dictatorial gov
ernment.
"The need of America," he de
clared in describing the administra
tion's national planning as a failure,
"is for a government that will pro
tect our rights and foster American
iniative, energy and frugality."
Centralized Power
Speaking in this huge industrial
center at the climax of his campaign
across the major battle ground of
the presidential election, the Re
publican nominee cited—one by one
—the "unmistakable" evidences of
ning under the Roosevelt admini
centralized power and national plan
stration.
Then, pledging himself to repeal
"all of the acts giving autocratic
power to the chief executive," he
flung a challenge at the President:
"If there has been a change of
policy (since the first steps toward
changing our form of government)
it is time the American people were
taken into the confidence of the
administration and informed of its
plans . . . No nation can continue
half regimented and half free.
He spoke in a great baseball park
where the chilling wind swept across
the crowd. A special heating ar
rangement helped protect the speak
ers stand.
Lauds Henry Ford
He took advantage of his setting
to emphasize his admiration for
methods such as were employed by
Henry Ford and other leaders of the
automobile industry.
"The automobile industi'y," he
said, "instead of talking about re
covery has worked for recovery.
And I do not think it is without
significance that this industry re
sisted at every turn the compulsory
regulations imposed by NRA. In
deed, one of its most distinguished
leaders (Ford) never signed the code
of the Blue Eagle."
Gov. Landon devoted much of his
speech to the Constitution, which
he described as a "charter that his
served us well." But he said, he did
not contend that it was impossible
to change the Constitution when
necessary to protect free competition
or prevent abuse of privilege.
Gov. Landon referred to oppres
sion under dictatorial governments
abroad and warned that generations
"are growing up in those countries
who have never known the free
search for truth."
"Freedom of thought is gone," he
said. "Freedom of speech is gone.
Freedom of the press is gone. Free
dom of worship is gone. .
"We in America cannot ignore
these warnings. We must not, out
of regard for any man or men, blind
ourselves to the forces thaat are
loose in the world.
"It is not a question of any man
or men. It is a question of human
freedom."
