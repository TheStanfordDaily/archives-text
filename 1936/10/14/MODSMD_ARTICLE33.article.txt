The second bunch of 1936 intra
mural football competitors swung
intci action yesterday afternoon with
four squads hauling themselves onto
the victory bandwagon.
Most decisive win was registered
by Delta Tau Delta, which aggrega
tion plastered Phi Gamma Delta 11,
20-0, in a game featured by a 70-
yard Delt touchdown run in the clos
ing minutes.
Most hard fought game was that
between Theta Chi and El Cuardo,
resulting in an extra-period tri
umph for the first named. Clark,
who paved the way for the Theta
score with a 60-yard romp, and
Hanzlick, who accounted for their
lone touchdown, scintillated for the

Greek letter men.
Sequoia II forfeited its contest to
Theta Xi, while in the remaining
game Beta dropped a heart wrencher
to the Breakers, 6-0.
Beginning this afternoon, six games
will be played instead of the usual
four. ' *
