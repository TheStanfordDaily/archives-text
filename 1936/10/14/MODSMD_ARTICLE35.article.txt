# New Students To Meet Wilburs
## 
### 
After being entertained by Wom
en's Conference with a series of in- '
formal dessert parties, the new trans- !
fer and graduate students will now
have an opportunity to meet Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilbur at the informal
reception being given for them at the i
Wilburs' home on Lagunita Knoll on
Friday, October 16, at 8 o'clock.
Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur will receive
alone, but the Dean of Women and
the Dean of Men will be present, as
well as the faculty members of the
different departments.
Until last year, the Wilburs enter- '
tained the freshmen and transfers
together, but this year, owing to the j
large registration, two separate re
ceptions are being given.
