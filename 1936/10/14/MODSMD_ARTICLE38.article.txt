# Pan Hellenic Plans Series of Parties
## 
### 
Pan-Hellenic entertainment this
year will be divided into three teas,
with one-third of the residents of
Roble and one-third of the Row in

vited to each.
The teas will be held in the
Women's Clubhouse from 3 to 5
o'clock Friday, Saturday, and Sun
day afternoons. Roble women are
urged to come whether they plan to
pledge a house or not as the teas
are non-selective. Informal clothes
will be worn.
