WHY SECRET
PRACTICE NOW?

They will holler their heads off
when they read that Stanford is go
ing to have secret practice for a
while. It has long been a Thornhill
tradition to open the practice gates
to any and all interested, and now,
suddenly, this reversal of form.
How come?
It's simply that in this lean year,
with green untried guys at several
of the lead positions on the squad,
and no outstanding strength on
either line or backfield, it becomes
necessary for Tiny to dig even deeper
into the football bag of tricks.
The useless are going to be
thrown out, some new ones formu
lated, but in general, the offense will
be cut "down to the bone.'
This new offense, featuring a fast
breakaway, or a strategy of throw
ing unexpected plays at unex
pected times, can not well succeed
when adequately scouted and dia
gramed for the opposing coach.
In addition Tiny plans to better
teach his proteges by means of a
blackboard on the playing field —
running plays and then showing Joe
or Mike on the blackboard which
man he should have taken instead of
the one he did. Then, too, there will
be plenty of the Stanford strategy
expounded orally on the field in that
stentorian Thornhill baritone.
Plays described on blackboard be
fore the pubic by the head coach will
not be extremely valuable on the
succeeding Saturday, they say.
Stanford students will yowl that
they pay 115 bucks to come to school
here and then can't even watch their
own football team work out. But on
the other hand, the gates have been
open for years and the average daily
student attendance has just exceed
ed 23. Did any of you see last week's
practice "rally"?

A FEW OF THE
LOYAL WILL SUFFER

Some individuals like Potter and
Smith who are as loyal as ever they
come, and love the squad enough to
come out every day and watch, will
be over the barrel, but it can't be
helped. You can't let some students
in and keep others out; and in spite
of the fact that they haven't been
around for weeks, the ones left out
will bellow.
Newspaper men will be admitted,
as they rarely absorb the things
from a chalk talk that ihe coach
doesn't want known, and can be
counted on to lay certain things low
if requested. Licbendorfer knows the
life history of all the Bay Region
boys, and if any others are around,
Tiny will know it.
So. Citizens, don't get excited.
Thornhill, the boys, and some of us
arc definitely interested in winning
ball games, and this is an obvious
move forward.
You can't get into practice at
U.S.C., and you have to sign your
life away in credentials to get in at
Washington, California, and the
others. Nearly every school in the
country goes into closed meeting
once in a while. Tiny plans them in
definitely up to the U.S.C. game, and
after that maybe only a few times
before Cal.

CHAD READE
GETS HIS ORCHID

No one realizes better than I that
the linemen on a team never get the
publicity breaks—the backs are con
tinually doing the scoring and hence
get their mugs in the papers.
But still I have to follow on—a
number of unknowns did blocking
Saturday in such a way as to make
Chad Re;ide, Frosh right half, look to
have the best future of any ball ear
lier that's hit this place since Gray
son.
Twice the kid was spectacular. His
first was an intercepted pass good
for 45 yards and a touchdown. Ho
caught it, hestated a bit to collect
his balance and his thoughts and
then started straight ahead. About

Stanford students will yowl that
they pay 115 bucks to come to school
here and then can't even watch their
own football team work out. But on
the other hand, the gates have been
open for years and the average daily
student attendance has just exceed
ed 23. Did any of you see last week's
practice "rally"?

A FEW OF THE
LOYAL WILL SUFFER

Some individuals like Potter and
Smith who are as loyal as ever they
come, and love the squad enough to
come out every day and watch, will
be over the barrel, but it can't be
helped. You can't let some students
in and keep others out; and in spite
of the fact that they haven't been
around for weeks, the ones left out
will bellow.
Newspaper men will be admitted,
as they rarely absorb the things
from a chalk talk that ihe coach
doesn't want known, and can be
counted on to lay certain things low
if requested. Licbendorfer knows the
life history of all the Bay Region
boys, and if any others are around,
Tiny will know it.
So. Citizens, don't get excited.
Thornhill, the boys, and some of us
arc definitely interested in winning
ball games, and this is an obvious
move forward.
You can't get into practice at
U.S.C., and you have to sign your
life away in credentials to get in at
Washington, California, and the

country goes into closed meeting
once in a while. Tiny plans them in
definitely up to the U.S.C. game, and
after that maybe only a few times
before Cal.

CHAD READE
GETS HIS ORCHID

No one realizes better than I that
the linemen on a team never get the
publicity breaks—the backs are con
tinually doing the scoring and hence
get their mugs in the papers.
But still I have to follow on—a
number of unknowns did blocking
Saturday in such a way as to make
Chad Re;ide, Frosh right half, look to
have the best future of any ball ear
lier that's hit this place since Gray
son.
Twice the kid was spectacular. His

WHY SECRET
PRACTICE NOW?

They will holler their heads off
when they read that Stanford is go
ing to have secret practice for a
while. It has long been a Thornhill
tradition to open the practice gates
to any and all interested, and now,
suddenly, this reversal of form.
How come?
It's simply that in this lean year,
with green untried guys at several
of the lead positions on the squad,
and no outstanding strength on
either line or backfield, it becomes
necessary for Tiny to dig even deeper
into the football bag of tricks.
The useless are going to be
thrown out, some new ones formu
lated, but in general, the offense will
be cut "down to the bone.'
This new offense, featuring a fast
breakaway, or a strategy of throw
ing unexpected plays at unex
pected times, can not well succeed
when adequately scouted and dia
gramed for the opposing coach.
In addition Tiny plans to better
teach his proteges by means of a
blackboard on the playing field —
running plays and then showing Joe
or Mike on the blackboard which
man he should have taken instead of
the one he did. Then, too, there will
