# France Ignores German Protest
## Government Unconcerned With Thorez' Remarks 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 13 (/P)â€” I The French
government has decided to refuse
to admit the validity of the German
protest against the Communist "in
sult" to Chancellor Adolf Hitler at
Strasbourg last Sunday. The United
Press was informed tonight.

French Deny Insults

What the German press termed
"an unparalled insult to the head of
the German state" is no concern of
the French government, the United
Press was told, therefore France will
refuse either to recognize Germany's
official protest or undertake any
steps against the Communist party as
a result.
The remarks which aroused Ger
man ire were made by M. Thorez,
Secretary of the Communist Party.
The German press demanded a vig
orous protest and yesterday the Ger
man charge D'affaires in Paris was
so instructed.

No Official Status

The speech the United Press was
told, remains a private matter so far
as the Quai D'orsay is concerned. If
the German Foreign Office considers
his remarks libelous, action may be
taken in the French courts, it was
pointed out, but since Thorez is not a
member of the government nor was
the government in any way con
cerned with organization of the
Strasbourg Communist meeting, his
remarks have no official status.
