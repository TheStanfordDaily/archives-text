# Subdued Tone Marks Secret Grid Practice
## Thornhill Puts Squads Through Rapid Pace For Trojan Conflict 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Things went forward in a different
tone of voice at football practice yes
terday.
It was quiet, orderly, smooth, effi
cient—it was one of these new
Thornhill secret practices. The team
was running plays through dummies,
and how they ran 'em!
Tiny was stationed near his black
board, drawing one play on one side
while Grayson instructed the boys in
learning another off the other side.
Some plays were the same old stuff,
others were new varieties, but al
ways the three teams would run
each through several times after
studying a map of it.
Crowds Lacking
Biggest difference of this from any
ordinary workout was the appear
ance of the field; instead of the
crowd of students. Paly kids, alumni,
managers, and general football fans
that usually throng the field and
make the practice sessions a hetero
geneous mass, the thing was orderly.
Three teams of the varsity were in
one spot, changing off at rapid rate,
Husky Hunt's Grays were in anoth
er, the junior managers sat convers
ing in hushed tones on one sideline,
while solitary Trainer Ted Kite
perched himself on the 40-yard line.
Tiny Changes Cap
Tiny also turned over a new leaf
in abandoning that 24th century
coaching cap he's been wearing so
far this season, and has gone back to
that old flea-bitten baseball cap that
seemed to bring him luck over the
past seasons.
News comes from the Trojans, re
turning from Illinois, that Howard
Jones has called Davie Davis, his
present tailback, the best quarter
beautiful shots at him, but that old
Grayson stop and swerve were good
on both.
The second was near the end of
(he game — Readc started around his
right end, and pretty soon was lifting
them up and setting them down so
fast he just ran around the other
boys. Then on the right sidelines he
turned around and began running
the other way so fast that his own
teammates couldn't get out of the
way, finally going down after a 37-
yard gain.
Chad Reade can play on my club
any day in the week.
