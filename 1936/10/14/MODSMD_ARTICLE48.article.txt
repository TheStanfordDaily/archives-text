# Democracy at the Crossroads
## 
### 
Because there is going to be a student body
vote on the question of the Mud Fight, and
since The Daily has already somewhat pro
truded its beagle and said very unkind things
to Mr. Boyd, perhaps it would be wise to give
something of the point of view of the Mud Fight
advocates.
They contend that the Mud Fight is a lot of
fun and that the Daily editor is a sissy. The
first one The Daily disputes; as for the latter,
anyone will agree to that. Still, if the Mud Fight
is a lot of fun, it is a lot of fun. Those who vote
on it are qualified to say that.
Then there is the contention that the Mud
Fight must be held to relieve the tremendous
pressure generated amongst the sophomores
and freshmen who want the battle. If they
don't get it they will take it out in subversive
forms of violence.
As for injuries and unfavorable publicity, it
seems to me that they are irrelevant. No one
has produced particularly pertinent evidence
as to injuries, and there are few wise enough
to tell what publicity is favorable and what is
unfavorable. If a student poll tomorrow shows
that the majority of the sentiment is for the
Mud Fight, then that should clinch the argu
ment and the editorial beagle guessed wrong
on how far our culture has advanced.
