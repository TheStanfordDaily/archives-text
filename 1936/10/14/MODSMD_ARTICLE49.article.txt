# Don't You Love Us In October As You Did in May?

### 
To show the reckless drivers of Palo Alto how
much Stanford trade means, movie theater own
ers are forced to raise the ante to a solid 40-cent
Lop ctau bottom for summer showings, including
the last row of the balcony.
Such highway robbery, they tell the Republi
can tax-payers, are "summer rates." Now it may
be that Palo Alto's marvelous climate gives an
undetectable imitation of summer even in Oc
tober. But our Red professors tell us that, mete
orologically, summer is over.
Personally, I detect a distinct chill in the air
when we plunk down 40 cents at the box office
these dark evening 8 o'clocks. I would say even
Indian summer is over.
There are three suggestions: (1) That theater
managers come out in the air with a thermome
ter. (2) That they change their sign to read "au
tumn rates. ' (3) That they reduce the service
charge on balcony seats to 30 cents so we can
go to the movies. R. E.
