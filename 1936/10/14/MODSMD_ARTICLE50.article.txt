# Trouble in Paradise

A roadside joint is closed "for repairs."
There is no reason why this should mean
anything to Stanford students. Stanford is a
residence University; what happens down the
highway should be of little interest to the stu
dents. But the fact is, that it is of interest to the
students.
Why?
Are students depraved? Do they get a per
verse sense of fun out of going to a joint be
cause it is a joint? No. They go to joints be
cause there is a definite, valuable function that
the highway resort filled. It was an informal,
democratic, and cheap place to take a date.
There was no informal, democratic, and cheap
place to take a date on the campus.
There have been no all-University dances on
the campus on any week-end yet this quarter.
There will be none this week-end. The Cardi
nals Group has one planned for after the S.C.
game but no others this quarter. This leaves
few alternative places for the students to go.
The City is definitely too expensive, too formal,
too much over-run, too far away.
We have heard in the past few days of agi
tation for a Date Bureau; we hear that there are
a lot of Stanford women in the Halls who don't
get asked as often as they should be.
I don't think all-University dances will solve
the problem. I don't tfiink jolly-ups will solve
the problem. I don't think anything will solve
the problem, but there is something that will
ameliorate it.
That something is to open an informal, demo
cratic, and cheap place for dating on the cam
pus. A place with a fountain, easy chairs, maga
zines to read, a dance floor, and a small orches
tra or a radio phonograph combination. Stan
ford, of course, has not reached the liberal point

of some of the Eastern colleges where bever
ages stronger than a Green River milkshake
are served. State law would prevent anything
stronger than 3.2. But even without "narcotics"
a local place would have a definite appeal to
many students who either do not drink, or at
least drink only to be "sociable.':'
It has been suggested that the University
renovate and enlarge the second floor of the
Lake Lagunita boathouse, which would give
the definite advantage of an informal atmos
phere, as well as be close enough to the wom
en's dorms to obviate the need of cars. Such a
"joint" would relieve the no-date situation in
the Halls by encouraging campus dating of
hard-pressed Stanford men. It would lighten the
problem caused by the closing of campus
dances at 1 a.m. and the resultant period of
watchful waiting until 2:30 lockouts. It might
even be practical.
