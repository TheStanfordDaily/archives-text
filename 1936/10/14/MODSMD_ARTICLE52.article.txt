BURY THE DEAD

For the past two weeks, throwing mud at the Mud
Fight has been the favorite indoor sport of faculty
members and Ex Committee. Now they're going to
wash off the Mud Fight and see what an election will
do to it.
That there is nothing to vote on seems pretty ob
vious. The Mud Fight, as a going concern in Stanford
life, passed through insolvency about four years ago.
It was the last of the great company, including the
Plug Uglies, that brightened Stanford life when there
was nothing else to brighten it. It was the last of the
great need-filling traditions. And if nothing else can
be said for it, it was the most enduring of them all.
The mud-fight had a certain genius in its concep
tion. It appealed to the basic mud-pie motive. It had
the drama of struggle, and it was completely and in
dubitably dirty. It should take an honored place with
the rest of Stanford's dead.

Let us so honor it. For nothing,, not even the might
of Stanford Democracy unleashed-under-control, can
bring it back to life. All we can do at the polls is pass
a courtesy resolution giving the Mud Fight the privi
leges of the Rally Committee cemetery.
But we can find solace in these truths: that the Mud
Fight wasn't murdered, it just up and died.
Dean Culver didn't kill it, nor did Ex Committee.
The Dean merely said too many people were being
injured, observed that footballers weren't allowed to
get hurt in a profitless Mud Fight so they could get
hurt in a profitable game.
Ex Committee merely exed it, and found old Mr.
Mudfight failing in this day of easy trips to the Frantic
and easier trips to the show.
So, the issue being clear, we shall have an election
to decide it.
♦* ' *
Unquestionably, we will vote the Mud Fight into
life—or suspended animation in formaldehyde rah-rah.
We will be bound, by facts that point to a decent if
hasty burial, to hold the corpse over.
So we probably will hvae another Mud Fight, and
still another. Somehow, someway, enough sophomores
always will be found willing to be bored by and into
a hog-wallow. And somehow, someway, a "natural
born leader" in Encina will always drum up the requi
site hysteria among the frosh.
You and I will always find time to go down and see
it. And somehow, someway, the gals will always love
it for what might happen, even though it doesn't.
