# OUR HASHER

### 
The Phi Dolt pre-initiation was scheduled for 12:30
a.m. Monday night. The time arrived, and the upper
classmen got quietly out of bed. Lights were turned on,
and 14 empty beds, neatly made, spic and span, gave
proof through the night that the flag was not there.
The Phi Delt bangalow was all set to bang, but
nothing to bang on.
The 14 pledges were enjoying themselves, on the
other hand, sloping peacefully in the unbridled suite
of a Paly Hotel.
By 2 a.m. in the morning, the brothers in Phi Delta
Theta, spic and spank, located the 14 refugees, and
engraved an invitation on them to return to the
chapter house.
The sophomores accepted from the bottom of their
heart.
One of the houses up the Row discovered on the
first day of pre-initiation (Heck Week) that one of
their members in the sophomore class did not like the
proceedings. He summoned the upperclassmen togeth
er in the library, and went into the fundamental
analysis of the situation, quoting Plato, Aristotle, and
the boys. Finally he wound up with the fiat state
ment: "I didn't mind the noise at the table so much.
I didn't care about the men stealing the soap I left in
the showers. I didn't mind having to shove the house
dog off my pillow before I could get into bed, but.
men, I couldn't stand the inexorable fact that when
I got down to the dinner table and looked to my right
and looked to my left, I found nothing but doors, low
fellows who couldn't carry on an intelligent conversa
tion. Gentlemen, I find that I am being mentally stifled
in this house, and must, perforce, withdraw from the
initiatory activities."
There were a few brief moments of silent prayer,
while the gentleman withdrew from the initiatory ac
tivities. As yet, he has not returned for his baggage,
which is on the front lawn.
