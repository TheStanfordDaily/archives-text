# The 						SCRAPBOOK

### Clipped by Phil Bernheim 
DICK JURGENS, idol of our edi
tor, is playing his first eastern en
gagement in the Gold Coast Room of
the Drake Hotel in Chicago. And as
master of ceremonies, the Drake has
Pat O'Malley, late of Jack Hylton's
troupe, who delighted with his stor
ies of Albert and the lion. Paul Pen
darvis, by the bye, is at the William
Penn in Pittsburgh.
KEN MURRAY, the radio comic,
and his stooge, Oswald, are cutting a
series of discs for Victor, who expect
(hope) they'll become a second Two
Black Crows.
FOURTH ESTATE: Col. Frank
Knox's Chicago News carries West
brook Pegler's column. Now Pegler
is a sort of non-partisan Democrat
(like The Daily), and when one of
his recent columns devoted itself to
panning the good Colonel (even as a
recent Daily Bull Session), the
Colonel tossed it out of the paper for
the day. Next p.m. the Chi Daily
Times, Knox's journalistic rival,
printed the censored column with
the permission of Pegler's bosses, the
New York World-Telegram . . .
Pat Ziegfeld, the great Flo's daugh
ter, who works as a columnist for
Bill Rogers' Bev Hill Citizen, has re
rHvfri offers for syndication of her
daily screeds.
LAZINESS IS a bad thing. Lazi
ness causes the shortness of this
column today. See you tomorrow if
I can get up in time.
