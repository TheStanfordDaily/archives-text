# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Whon I expressed my convictions
in Friday's Campus Opinion, I cer
tainly did not intend to inaugurate a
dirty personal duel (verbal or other
wise) between the editor and myself.
In respect to the Mud Fight, I am
inclined to be reactionary because of
the reasons I set forth last Friday,
and because (although I do not be
lieve the tradition to be "effete") I
can find no "new and vital" better
substitute that would not be ridicu
lously sissified. Amen.
Bill Boyd, '36
