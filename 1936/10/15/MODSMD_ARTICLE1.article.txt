# Date Bureau Promised Aid By Cardinals
## U.S.C. â€“ Stanford Dance Committee Appointed At Business Meeting 
### 
A voluntary "Date Bureau" was
established by members of the Card
inals at their meeting last night when
they opened their services to help
new students and others interested
in locating dates.
The action grew out of the feeling
that especially freshmen and trans
fers, being comparatively unac
quainted on the campus, do desire
some aid in getting dates.
Under their plan, the student de
siring a date is to call some member
of the Cardinals who in turn will
try to locate a suitable partner.

Routine business largely occupied
the remainder of the meeting. Kille
fer reported the entertaining of two
French students, who visited the
campus yesterday as a part of a tour
of American universities under the
sponsorship of the French Minister
of Education.
Planned Dance
Hopkins, chairman of the Stan
ford-USC dance, announced the ap
pointment of Wayne Richardson,
John Rice, Jacqueline Brown, and
Jack Grover to aid him in prepara
tions. Betty Grover was appointed
chairman of the Annual Red Cross
Drive.
Other business included reports on
the housing of visiting students to
the campus, and plans fcr a bonfire
and barbecue rally for Big Game.
