# Landon Supporters Come To Front In Roble Survey
## 
### JANET GOULD 
An average man around the home
to wash the dishes and help with the
kiddies, may have advantages over a
dynamic radio personality, the
Roble-for-Landon group has declar
ed. These young Republicans dis
sent with last week's Daily poll,
which gave Roble to Roosevelt, be
cause ot the President's sex-appeal.
Hating Roosevelt's very insides
seems to be the reflex action of be
ing heart and soul for Landon. In
this and in the fact that many of the
women inherit their politcis, a part
of Roble agrees with the Encina
sentiments.
Some of the President's qualities
most annoying to the women are:
his "almost vulgar appreciation of
applause," the fact that he is swayed
by those around him, his general
"boobiness," and the bad taste
shown by the family in the news.
Isn't He Grand
"Why, when you have a grand
thing like Landon running around
loose, you can think of any one else
beats me," Connie Crommelin an
nounced. "Sure, he's an average
man—one who made his own money
and has the respect and support of
his neighbors and his class. And I
think that funny little grin of his has
more personality than Roosevelt's
million-dollar smile — I hate people

who throw their personal magnetism
down my throat."
On the side of inherited politics,
Connie Bohosky is for the Repub
lican because her father is. "And
that's not so dumb," she added. "Our
business would be ruined if that
man got in again, and I want to keep
on having things."
Just Likes Ilim
Kitty Lawrence would vote for the
Kansas governor "simply because I
like him—an argument good enough
for the other side to use."
Unnecessary taxes all their lives
would not please Mary Rieber and
Virginia Hawkes. Landon's record as
governor of Kansas, his sincerity, the
fact that "his feet are on the ground
and he knows where he's going"
have influenced the women's politics.
Keep Fingers Crossed
Most of the arguments for him
take the form of hearty criticism of
Roosevelt, however.
"It's awfully hard to talk election
around here," Florence Murphy add
ed, "when neither side will credit
the other one's arguments. It's easy
to say that the President hasn't done
one thing (he hasn't) or that Landon
will right this mess (he
"I think the thing to do is to go
on believing in the better man and
keep our fingers crossed."
