# Smith Scrap At Political Rally
## 
### 
NORTHAMPTON. Mass., Oct. 14
(IP). â€”Powder and rouge covered the
bruises today which several Smith
College girls received when rival
political groups indulged in a little
hair pulling and nail scratching be
fore a rally for Massachusetts Re
publican candidates was held on the
campus.
With red and green torches flar
ing and a band blaring, a hundred
or so Republican supporters marched
across the campus of the exclusive
college to John M. Green hall to hear
the candidates, headed by John W.
Haigis, candidate for governor.
Tufts of Hair
There they were met by a group of
about 25 Democratic enthusiasts'
brightly painted signs.
A highly pitched soprano hoot
pierced the air. Carmine painted
fingernails went into play. Tufts of
hair from carefully marcelled heads
drifted in the night air.

Leland Stanford, pioneer railroad
builder and founder of Stanford
University, had the first nursery for
plants in the West on his farm here.
