# Row Starts Rush Period Tomorrow
## Hoover Warns Houses Of Rules, Penalties; Honor System Used 
### 
With 2800 rushing cards in the
mail last night, Enema frosh will go
up the Row tomorrow for the first
round of informal entertaining as the
initial rushing period of the 1936-37
season swings into action.
Last minute caution from Bob
Hoover, president of Interfraternity
Council, to both Kow and Encina
men is that they pay particular at
tention to the revised rushing rules
and the penalties for their infrac
tion.
Innovating Friday and Saturday
rushing for the first time, it is hoped
that a much more informal rela
tionship will develop between the
Row and rushees, enabling them to
become better acquainted during the
short priod and also perhaps elim
inating the necessity of rule vio
lation.
Penalty for a violation of the rules
is at the discretion of the Interfra
ternity Board. But by means of the
Honor Code signed by each house
president, wherein he agrees to be
responsible for the actions of his
house during rushing and pledges
himself to utmost obedience of the
rules, it is hoped no infractions will
result.
