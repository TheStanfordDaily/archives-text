### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 14 (JP).—President
Roosevelt told I he nation tonight that
American Democracy had been men
aced by "concentration of wealth
and power," particularly in the last
12 years of Republican administra
tions, and that the New Deal "above
all" had fought to break "the deadly
grip" of monopoly on the business
of the country.
The President spoke from the flag
festooned stage of the Chicago
stadium to thousands of people
crammed into every available seat.
Four years ago in the same hall he
accepted the Democratic nomination
for the presidency.
lie claimed tonight that there had
been a recovery from depression that
could not "just happen," and that it
was the New Deal that had accepted
"the responsibility to save business—
to save the American system of pri
vate enterprise and economic dem
ocracy." And he added it was a rec
ord "unequalled by any government
in history."
