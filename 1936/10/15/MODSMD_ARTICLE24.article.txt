# Wilbur To Receive Transfer Students
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Wilbur will
entertain the new transfer and grad
uate students tomorrow night at 8
o'clock with an informal reception at
their home on Lagunita Knoll. The
dean of women. Mary Yost, and the
dean of men, George B. Culver, will
bo present, as well as members of
the faculty.
This year, instead of entertaining
the freshmen and transfers together,
the Wilburs are giving two separate
receptions because of the large num
ber of new students. Informal
clothes will be worn.
