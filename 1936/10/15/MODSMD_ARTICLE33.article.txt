LONDON, Oct. 14 (/P>. â€” Ernest
Simpson said tonight his wife, Mrs.
Wallis Simpson, friend of King Ed
ward, has filed suit for divorce.
The case has been set for hearing
before Justice Hawke at the Ips
wich Assizes, opening October 27,
said Simpson, a commercial broker.
He asserted the case would not be
defended. Beyond lhat, he declared,
he had no statement to make.
Legal sources pointed out Mrs.
Simpson will seek her divorce on
grounds of adultery, the only method
by which it can be obtained in Eng
land.
The proceedings will be placed on
the "undefended" list, with Simpson
not contesting the charges.
If the divorce is granted, the
former Baltimore woman will bo
freed from her second unsuccessful
matrimonial venture. She was di
vorced in 1927 from Lieut. Earl
Spencer, whom she married in 1916.
The proceedings which Mrs.
Simpson instituted were understood
to be the result, of an "amicable"
arrangement between the parties
concerned.
