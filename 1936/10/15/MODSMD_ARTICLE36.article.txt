## HEAVEN IN LOS ANGELES 
### 
This is Bernheim's private prop
erty all right, but news of such mo
ment can bear being mentioned
twice in the same paper. In short,
the Pacific Daily Racing Form has
given up San Francisco as a base of
operations and will move to Los An
geles by the end of the year.
This is important news, for it
means that the Jehovahs of the
sporting gentry's Bible have given
official recognition to the fact that
Los Angeles is now sucker capital of
the state, if not the nation.

It may be a glorious myth that in
England everything stops for tea,
but it is no myth that in Pasadena,
Hollywood, Los Angeles, and such
places, everything stops for the
horse races. The season at Santa
Anita is long and the take is tre
mendous, and not all of it comes
from the tinsel aristocracy of Holly
wood. The rank and file are the mass
consumers of the pari-mutuel tick
ets.
But there is, I admit, real rugged
stamina in Southern California, for
San Diego lost both the Navy pay
roll and the fair featuring Miss
Cnhitt's exhibition of native Ameri
can art, and still San Diego strug
gled valiantly onward. It took the
closing of Agua Caliente to fold up
San Diego's booming prosperity like
a tent.

I am treading on dangerous ground
here, for the people of Southern Cal
ifornia are known far and wide for
their blind and unreasoning faith in
the beautiful fairy tale that heaven
lies surely just south of Santa Bar
bara.
They would have Saint Peter at the
gate operating a real estate subdi
vision, Angel Gabriel giving 15-min
ute trumpet concerts of hill-billy
music on the radio, followed by ad
vertising blurbs for electric belts to
magnetize your way to health, and
down the road a ways the lesser an
gels constructing a soft-drink stand
in the shape of an enormous plaster
harp.
And if one angel with the Los
Angeles mania for commercialism
opened a creamery selling celestial
ambrosia for 15 cents a glass, the
next day another angel who had as
cended from the Los Angeles county
area would be in business across the
street selling the same thing for 7V2
cents. â€”Curtis Prendergast
