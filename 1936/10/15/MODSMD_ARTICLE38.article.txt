# Professors Jockey Speeding Neutrons in 'Ion Gun' Invention

### DAVE LEFF 
Picture a Ford coupe doing 50 col
liding with a 10-ton Mack and send
ing it off at 500 miles per hour.
That's as close as the layman can
get to conceiving of what happens in
Physics Professor Norris E. Brad
bury's "ion gun."
Tons of heavy hydrogen traveling
over 5.000 miles per second and
charged with 200.000 volts of ener
gy produce a stream of neutrons
charged with 2,500.000 volts and go
ing more than ten times as fast.
The purpose of the unique ma
chine, built by Professors Bradbury
and Felix Bloch, assisted by Profes
sor P. A. Ross, is to produce neutrons
in quantities sufficient for use in re
search.
Neutrons Explained
"Neutrons," explains Professor
Bradbury, "are particles of the same
mass as the nucleus of a hydrogen
atom, but uncharged. Being inert,
they may be used easily and sue-

cessfully in bombarding charged
nuclei." Radium has hitherto been
employed for this purpose but Stan
ford's ion gun discharges the par
ticles more efficiently than a million
dollars' worth of radium. Professor
Bradbury confided that, aside from
labor involved, the machine cost
only $300.
Heavy hydrogen ions—or deutons
—are made from heavy hydrogen
gas in a low voltage arc. Thsi gas
comes from the electrolysis of heavy
water —a liquid selling at $200 the
tumblerful but bought by the gram.
The deutons are bombarded against
a target of fixed heavy hydrogen.
Neutrons and helium result from the
consequent reaction.
Bradbury Comments
Bradbury is vigorous in his assur
ance that no practical social use will
be made of the ion gun as its med
ical and industrial properties are un
known and probably negligible. As
serts Professor Bradbury: "We in
tend confining the ion gun to experi
ments in pure physics, considering
the amplification of scientific knowl
edge to be a social end in itself."
