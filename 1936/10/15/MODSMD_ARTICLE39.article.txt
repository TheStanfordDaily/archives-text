LOS ANGELES. Oct. 14 (/?'). — A

headquarters, said today.

"In one sense," admits Professor
Bradbury, "the ion gun, like one of
H. G. Wells' inventions, releases en
ergy from the atom." He went on to
explain that this, however, is merely
a figure of speech. More correctly, it
trades mass for energy. The ma
chine in the northwest corner of the
quad will never inspire death rays

With selection of George Camp
bell, Dick McCarty, and Harold Rob
erts, the cast for Dramatic Council's
fall production "Roadside," was
completed yesterday by Dramatic
Director Gordon Lange.
Rehearsals are now under way for
Lynn Rigg's poetic portrayal of back

country life. Riggs, a comparatively
young playwright, was born in Ok
lahoma, of which he usually writes,
and is considered one of the best
writers of comedy in the country.
He has published several volumes
of poetry and many plays, among
which were the recent New York
hits, "Green Grow the Lilacs," a
Theater Guild production, and "Rus
set Mantle."
Arthur Hopkins, reputedly one of
the most cultured and enlightened
producers in New York, says of
"Roadside," "I believe it to be the
first American dramatic classic."
