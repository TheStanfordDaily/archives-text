# Card Gridders Work Hard For S.C. Game
## Aerial Attack Receives Thornhill's Attention; Grant, Stone Return 
### BY HERB DIAMOND 
They may have been "passless
wonders" last year, and the year
before, and even the year before
that, but Tiny Thornhill's Redskin
gridsters will be anything but that
from now on.
Although Tuesday evening's aerial
workout looked none too encourag
ing, the passes were clicking more
often yesterday. Jake Brigham, Tony
Calvelli, Johnny Campbell, Doc
Luckett, and Fred Williams all did
their share of tossing, while Grant
Stone, Carl Schott, Jimmy Coffis,
Joe Vigna, and Roger Munger,
among others, were snagging the
pigskin.
Injuries Heal
Stone seemed to be bothered but
slightly with the bruise he suffered
in the Oregon tilt. He was wearing
a sweat suit yesterday, but will
probably don a uniform today or to
morrow. Pop Grant's chipped shoul
der seems to be healing, and there
is a possibility that he will play
against the Trojans.
While the Cardinals were putting
all their energy into the various ac
tivities, Bill Paulman, crutches un
der his arms, stood on the sidelines
taking perhaps his last look at a
Farm workout until next fall. To
day, Paulman leaves for his home
at Oxnard, for he did not enter
school this year in order to save a
year's football eligibility.
Tomorrow afternoon the Indians
are slated to go through _another
workout as intensive as yesterday's
Coach Ben Winkleman's Grays will
scrimmage the Papooses, while the
varsity men, already cloaked in se
crecy, will find more solitude on the
fenced practice turf. They will be all
alone.
The appearance of Herb Dana, boss
of coast football officials, on the field
yesterday caused not a murmur;
Dana's was purely a social visit.
