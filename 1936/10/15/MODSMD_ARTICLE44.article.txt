### BY TIM SULLIVAN 
Preparing well in advance for their
game with (he UCLA yearlings one
week hence, Harry Shipkey's fresh
man charges went about the business ■
nf perfecting plays from punt forma- j
tion yesterday. I
Every day this week the Frosh
have been concentrating on a few J
formations until they have mastered
them. They will have an opportunity;
to make them click against Husky J
Hunt's squad tomorrow afternoon.
Thirty players will entrain for the
UCLA frosh tilt one week hence, -
and the selection of players to make
the trip will depend largely on the
showing made by the various boys
in tomorrow's scrimmage.
The play of his guards, Ernie Da
marus and Norman Juney, has been

gratifying to Coach Shipkey who also
adds: '"the ends are getting better,
but center is still a source of worry."
Pat Powell, a former tackle, is the
latest prospective center recruit. Wes
Muller has been giving this boy in
tensive training and it is believed
that he may fill the bill as alternate
for the somewhat banged-up Hugh
Radke.
