IN THE STANDS

Now I know that interhalf broad
cast at the Oregon game was a new
and untried thing, but all kidding
aside, it was horrible.
The broadcast is being done up
and down the Coast this year, and
we are running competition with
some well trained bands and root
ing sections. I hear we are going
to continue the performance at other
games, so let's get it bearable before
next time.
First off, only one yell leader be
longs up there, be it Web if his po
sition calls for it, or one of the oth
ers if he has a little musical ability.
You never see three yell leaders in
struct, ng card stunts, because there
is no place for disagreeing and un
synchonized instructions, and these
broadcasts are a similar case.
Web s crack about, "Here's your
chance to saj hello to Mom and
Pop" was a slip, 1 Lope; but when a
yell leader slips, strange to say the
rjotefs don't sense it and at times
carry out his orders. If this were Los
Anetles J.C., or, to be more in the
vernacular, Milpitas High, "Hiya
Maw!" might be a well chosen thing
to say over a football broadcast. But
at Stanford with the score 7-7 it
isn't.
And that guy in the front row con
stantly yelling, "The hell with NBC"
was a real payoff.
The fact that Associated Oil gives
us this five-minute period to show
hew we behave at games, and per
haps get enough outsiders interested
in rooting section antics to swell the
attendance a little, is cause enough
to use the time to our best ad
vantage.
How many times do you think we
will get those five minutes if they're
used like last Saturday?

HOW ABOUT THE
PEOPLE IN CHARGE?

To get a clean start, the Rally
Committee can get a supply of mega
phones and song sheets; singing in
the stands doesn't amount to much
without either.
The broadcast should be announc
ed to the section after full plans
have been arranged between the

band and yell leaders, and should be
announced in a strong tone of voice,
not one that seems to apologize for
the whole thing.
Students should either all stand or
all sit, and the band should sit out
on their platform in front, so that
the rooters can tell which piece
they're playing. The P.A. system, of
course, should be squelched during
this time, as the echoes are bad
enough to start with.
Web and Bud Fisher, the band
leader, ought to get together some
night and agree on how to lead their
groups in unison, how to start, and
how to keep the two outfits in the
same key. And Fisher, f'evvens sake
lead t'lat band as if you meant busi
ness, instead of lightly vibrating the
stirk.
Did you ever see Bill Okker lead
music? He nearly breaks his arm.

FIGHTING LIKE
A COUPLE OF CATS

From what I gather, the rooting
section r.fter every game criticizes
the band, and the band spends a lot
of time howling about how rotten
the rooters are. Is that nice, chil
dren-? Why not work together for
improvement?
The band seems to do quite well,
considering that they get 3 hours of
practice a week, and comparing their
performances with other college out
fits that get 7 and 9 hours per week.
The rooi'ng section, too, has pos
sibilities, as was exhibited :ti the en
thusiasm a\er Vigna's run and for
the feather on that blue hat.
In addition to spurring the team
on and up, these shows we put on at
games in a way advertise the Uni
versity and portray what kind of a
spirit and dignity we are supposed
to have at this place.

and down the Coast this year, and
we are running competition with
some well trained bands and root
ing sections. I hear we are going
to continue the performance at other
games, so let's get it bearable before
next time.
First off, only one yell leader be
longs up there, be it Web if his po
sition calls for it, or one of the oth
ers if he has a little musical ability.
You never see three yell leaders in
struct, ng card stunts, because there
is no place for disagreeing and un
synchonized instructions, and these
broadcasts are a similar case.
Web s crack about, "Here's your
chance to saj hello to Mom and
Pop" was a slip, 1 Lope; but when a
yell leader slips, strange to say the
rjotefs don't sense it and at times
carry out his orders. If this were Los
Anetles J.C., or, to be more in the
vernacular, Milpitas High, "Hiya
Maw!" might be a well chosen thing
to say over a football broadcast. But
at Stanford with the score 7-7 it
isn't.
And that guy in the front row con
stantly yelling, "The hell with NBC"
was a real payoff.
The fact that Associated Oil gives
us this five-minute period to show
hew we behave at games, and per
haps get enough outsiders interested
in rooting section antics to swell the
attendance a little, is cause enough
to use the time to our best ad
vantage.
How many times do you think we
will get those five minutes if they're
used like last Saturday?

HOW ABOUT THE
PEOPLE IN CHARGE?

To get a clean start, the Rally
Committee can get a supply of mega
phones and song sheets; singing in
the stands doesn't amount to much
without either.
The broadcast should be announc
ed to the section after full plans
have been arranged between the

band and yell leaders, and should be
announced in a strong tone of voice,
not one that seems to apologize for
the whole thing.
Students should either all stand or
all sit, and the band should sit out
on their platform in front, so that
the rooters can tell which piece
they're playing. The P.A. system, of
course, should be squelched during
this time, as the echoes are bad
enough to start with.
Web and Bud Fisher, the band
leader, ought to get together some
night and agree on how to lead their
groups in unison, how to start, and
how to keep the two outfits in the
same key. And Fisher, f'evvens sake
lead t'lat band as if you meant busi
ness, instead of lightly vibrating the
stirk.
Did you ever see Bill Okker lead
music? He nearly breaks his arm.

FIGHTING LIKE
A COUPLE OF CATS

From what I gather, the rooting
section r.fter every game criticizes
the band, and the band spends a lot
of time howling about how rotten
the rooters are. Is that nice, chil
dren-? Why not work together for
improvement?
The band seems to do quite well,
considering that they get 3 hours of
practice a week, and comparing their
performances with other college out
fits that get 7 and 9 hours per week.
The rooi'ng section, too, has pos
sibilities, as was exhibited :ti the en
thusiasm a\er Vigna's run and for
the feather on that blue hat.
In addition to spurring the team
on and up, these shows we put on at
