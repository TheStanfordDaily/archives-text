San Mateo Junior College, with
whom Stanford equally shared the
spoils of two engagements last year,
is barrier number two in the march
of the Farm soceermen to conference
honors.
Coach Harry Maloney and his men
go to San Mateo this Saturday with
one league victory, a 3-0 decision
over San Jose Slate, already on the
record. That one win places Stan
ford in the early conference lead as
San Mateo has not yet played and
llie California-San Francisco match
last Saturday resulted in a 1-1
stand-off.
In 1935, San Mateo lowered the
red banner in the first tilt by win
ning 2-0. Stanford returned the
compliment later in the season, how
ever, when an identical set-back was
handed out to the junior college
eleven.
The squad was fortified by the re
turn of two varsity men this week
who will probably see action Satur
day morning. They are Irving Haw
kins and George Chalmers, who were
out of competition with injured legs.
