If what I read in the papers is true, there is
an A.S.S.U. election this morning to fill one
Women's Council, two Men's Council, two Ex-
Committee posts, and two mud pits on the frosh
football field.
The merits of the case are obvious.
There are vacancies in five student posts.
Nature abhors a vacuum. The offices will be
filled.
The merits of the Mud Fight are obvious.
The Mud Fight is a tradition. The Mud Fight
is fun. The Mud Fight is a symptom of manli
ness. The Mud Fight is an athletic contest. The
Mud Fight is uplifting. The Mud Fight is edu
cational. The Mud Fight is trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient,
cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. The
Mud Fight is the Mud Fight.
I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier.
