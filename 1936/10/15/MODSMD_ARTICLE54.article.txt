# Nostalgia or Neuralgia
## 
### 
Now that we are all getting so sentimental
about Traditions, Mr. Chairman, I move that
there be established a vote onâ€”Tradition week,
in which the student body votes to ocntinue the
Hello Custom, the No Smoking on the Quad
tradition, the Quiet in the Libe tradition, and
that the Mandolin Club be requested to hold
meetings every week, and that the minutes be
sent to this body for review.
