# The 						Mark-Down
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees meets today and prob
ably will approve Ex Committee's Tuesday
night action which restored the A.S.S.U. dollar
to spring quarter tuition.
Last spring, Bob Grcs, former student mana
ger, upon consultation with Comptroller Almon
E. Roth and other University officials placed a
motion before Ex Committee to take the dollar
ordinarilly allotted for student body expenses
off the spring quarter tuition, while tuition for
all other quarters would remain SI 15.
The reason for this move was that the stu
dent body funds were building up too large a
surplus. There was no point in spending this
surplus to pay off the New Theater debt ac
cording to Gros, because students are paying
directly and indirectly $2 per quarter on the
New Theater. By using the spring quarter fees,
that would raise it to S3 per quarter for spring
fees.
Nov/ this year's manager, Chuck Fontius,
says that the spring quarter mark-down makes
it difficult for the University accountants, and
necessitates a change in the registration books.
He also says it presses the student body, be
cause he says he doesn't have enough in his
budget to meet the annual Student Aid request.
Also, he reasons, the A.S.S.U. would save a little
on interest charges. (The Administration lends
the A.S.S.U. money at 5 per cent, which money
the A.S.S.U. is using to build the University's
Theater.)
Fontius proposes to continue collecting the
baloney dollar, giving one-half to Student Aid
and one-half to the Theater. Fontius reasons
that one dollar per student does not mean much
to the individual student, but it means a lot to
the Student Aid and to the A.S.S.U.
If the Board of Trustees aproves this move,
this year's student manager will be happy, last
year's student manager will watch quietly, say
nothing, Mr. Roth will be out a little of the 5
per cent interest, more students and football
players will have their tuition provided, ac
countancy budgets for spring will be less clut
tered up, and students will continue paying the
usual SI 15 per quarter, 52.50 of which you can
figure will go to the New Theater in spring
quarter.
