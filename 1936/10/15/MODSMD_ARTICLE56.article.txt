The case of the People vs. Eisenbach con
tinues unabated.
If it please the stalwart Republicans, we are
planning a page in the Monday morning Tabby
for all creeds and parties, which will include
statements by ward heelers of the Republican,
Democratic, Socialist, and Communist parties.
If it pleases the stalwart Republicans, we are

expecting a statement from them. At that time,
we shall get to the bottom of this "persiflage"
business.
