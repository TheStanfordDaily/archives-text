# Golden Opportunity

I really have a good business proposition
figured out for the University, which will re
quire only a small down payment and will re
turn a tremendous investment. That proposition
is for the University to go into the garage busi
ness.
Now Stanford has a high rate of automobiles
per student. What is more, Paly garages are
far away. If the University would add to its
facilities, particularly around Toyon, Branner,
and Encina, and up the Row, it ought to clean
up.
Money accruing from this proposition might
be used to build more garages, or fill in the
University budget where the railroad stocks
left off.
