# A 						Good Thing

### 
A place on the campus for informal dancing
and coke-gurgling for students who cannot give
full expression to their personalities in highway
joints, would be a good thing.
It would be a good thing, if it would be built
in an attractive place such as the Lagunita
boathouse.
Perhaps some of the renovating of the boat
house could be done by NY A labor.
It might do away with jolly-ups, hurrah! It
might have easy chairs and magazines.
Are students interested? Do we hear a sec
ond in Campus Opinion?
