# BULL SESSION
## LEAVE IT IN THE GARAGE 
### 
We are appalled. (Yeh, we know you don't care.)
Unless our mathematics are way off, there was a
woman who whistled down University Avenue yester
day at nearly 22 miles an hour. Palo Altans went scur
rying into their main drag emporiums as she caromed
across the railroad track, streaked past Wilson's, and
then settled down into the home stretch past the Fox-
Stanford and that death-trap before Ye Olde Bookey
Shoppey.
Of course she was just a vulgar hussy. You could
tell that at a glance in your rear-view mirror. And she
was dressed in something that looked like an old Cole
Bros, circus poster. But imagine anyone being so
brazen as to roadburn in Paly. That's practically a
violation of the tail-light ordinance.

It's such things that mar Paly's perfect traffic rec
ord. Last year, you remember (you drunken driver,
you) only one pei'son was killed as a result of an
auto accident. Palo Altans are proud nigh onto hys
terics. Observers aren't so enthusiastic. They know for
a fact that almost everybody in Palo Alto is dead
anyway.
Even those who won't accept that fact will agree
that a stationary object can't do any hitting. In that
physical principle, is the real secret of how a bunch
of incompetent drivers avoid mass murder.

It's simply a plot. Mrs. Jones, 250-pounds on the
hoof who doesn't feel a day over 20 and doesn't look a
day over 75, has an unwritten contract with Mr. Toad
bottom that neither will move when they see the
other. And these Palo Altans are people of honor
whose word is better than a lot of bonds these days.
That gives you time.
The whole secret of getting along with them, auto
motively, is not to hit Jones or Toadbottom a good
healthy crack on their gas tanks, but to start planting
a bed of anemones on the running board, buy the
land your car stands on, and set up housekeeping.
Or, if the car is as hot as you are, you could drain
the radiator and shave.

We still wonder who that fearless and nasty woman
was. We'd like to meet her. She looked as if she'd been
around—corners.
