# Row To Meet Roble at Teas
## Pan â€“ Hellenic Functions Begin Tomorrow 
### 
Pan Hellenic Council will act as
hostess to Roble women at a series
of teas to be given tomorrow, Satur
day, and Sunday afternoons.
The Roble and Row women have
been divided into three gi'oups, each
group to attend one of the teas. The
teas will be given from 3 to 5 o'clock
upstairs in the Women's Clubhouse.
Tomorrow and Saturday quad
clothes will be worn, and Sunday
dressy sport.
The teas are non-selective and are
not considered a rushing function,
but are designed merely to afford the
opportunity to Roble and Row wom
en to meet informally. All fresh
man women are urged to come, as
the success of the teas depends on
their co-operation.
The teas will take the place of the
conference party, which was found
to be unsatisfactory because of the
number of women entertained at the
same time.
Transfer women have not been in
vited as they have the opportunity
of informal contact with Row women
all during the year.
