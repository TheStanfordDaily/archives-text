A major fire or flood could never upset the calm
tranquility of the Zeta Psi house, but there has been a
fire of a minor nature that has been burning in the
breast of the Zete brothers for a petite transfer from
the eastern United States who lives in the Oaks. The
result has been a flood of the brothers down to the
Okey-Dokes. This has all upset the calm tranquility
and the contented hour at the Zeta Psi house.
Now the disconcerting thing about it is that the
Zeta Psi house has at last found a petite transfer
from the East who doesn't like Zetes. She doesn't like
football players, and she doesn't like Zetes. The Zetes
cannot understand this. They like football players, and
they like Zetes. The Zetes have posted a bounty of $5
for any Zete who can date the marvel.
Lagunita was having a catechism on social regula
tions the other night.
Said the chief: "Is there such a thing as a cultural
late leave?"
Chorus: "Yes."
Chief: "How long arc you allowed after the function
is over before you get a lock-out?"
Chorus: "One half hour."
Piped a voice from the back: "One half hour cancels
, the culture."
According to the dictionary the cardinal is a bird.
Practice at Stanford seems to bear it out. Added to this
is the firm belief that the Cardinals are birds of a
feather. Practice at Stanford would indicate that birds
of a fodder flock to bodder. ,
Cardinal is the head of Stanford activities. With
out Cardinals there would be no activities. Without
activities there wouldn't be any Stanford. Without
Stanford there would be no Cardinals. So you. can
see how important Cardinals are.
Among other things that Cardinals throw is going
to be a dance following the S.C. game. Now for this
dance the Cardinals G.H.Q. wanted one freshman for
the committee. A Cardinal by the name of Anderson
spoke up and mentioned that there was a bright youth
in the freshman class named Anderson. A Cardinal
by the name of Grover said there was a bright youth
in the freshman class by the name of Grover. Seeing
that young Grover was in the room next door (quite
by accident, you may be sure) he outpointed young
Anderson for the job.
