# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I must resent your airy unconcern
at the charge of partisanship very
justly levied against you by W.8.M.;
I believe every Republican stalwart
on the campus must resent it. Mr.
Eisenbach is a writer on your staff,
and as such is sdbject to your con
trol. If you're going to let him vent
his political spleen, as he has ob
viously been doing in at least three
articles this quarter (October 1, 6, 7),
you should in fairness set up a simi
lar column for the opposite side;
then let the boys fight it out.
To say that your sporfs editor can
supply the need is ridiculous. Mr.
Klauber is expected to gripe about
referees, not presidents. However, I
had supposed that Our Hasher was
strictly local until I saw that rather
suspicious anecdote of October 6th.
You say you are a liberal, that
your viewpoint is objective. Can you
then allow the free use of your col
umn to Mr. Eisenbach? Certainly no
one who supports his views by the
simple method of labeling Landon a
"newspaper feature service charac
ter" and Knox a "quack doctor," a
"stinkaroo," and a "fourth-string
lago," and praises Roosevelt for be
ing a "golden voice of radio," Cactus
Jack for a "Willie Howard," and
Farley for "a lovable ass of the
world, etc.," can be considered an
objective political commentator.
Mr. Eisenbach doesn't even con
sider the campaign worth thinking
about outside the "bath-room." If
you're going to print that kind of rot,
why don't you label it "Political Ad
vertisement" or something?
Stanford has been a Republican
stronghold, even in '32. There is no
reason to believe it has changed this
year. Therefore, worst of all, you
cannot claim to represent the major
ity of students. I, for one, do not in
tend to support Roosevelt and easy

I money. I have not been charmed by
| his magnetic personality. I do not
! consider his record too creditable.
Though I've no doubt he'll win, I
wish you'd concede that this cam
! paign is more than a national min
i strel show. C. W. K.
The Editor, Sir:
We view with alarm the possible
perpetuation by the student body of
j the traditional bone-crusher, the
j macerating misfortune, the mud
fight.
When we consider the future of
America hobbling about on crutches
J and grinning toothlessly through
i battle-scarred lips, we con well un
derstand the viewpoint of those who
|so bitterly condemn the annual
i brawl.
But those who demur stress far
too insufficiently other dangers lurk
-1 ing in our educational system which
imperils the bodies and minds of
I thousands (yea thousands) of prod
j ical sons imbibing learning, lore, and
Yes, down we say with football,
baseball, basketball, track, swim
ming, croquet, badminton, and that
awful menace, ping-pong.
Students of Stanford, let us rally
around the banners of the A.S.U.
(American Saviours of Uth), and
keep Stanford forever safe for flow
ers and femininity.
I Anyway, give them practice for
! the November elections.

The Editor, Sir:
The idea of turning the Lagunita
boathouse into a "joint" is a swell
one. The absence of a social gath
ering place on the University
grounds has long been one of the
sorest spots of the school. I for one
am willing to do what I can to make
the idea materialize.

The idea of turning the Lagunita
boathouse into a "joint" is a swell

The Editor, Sir:
I must resent your airy unconcern
at the charge of partisanship very
justly levied against you by W.8.M.;
I believe every Republican stalwart
on the campus must resent it. Mr.
Eisenbach is a writer on your staff,
and as such is sdbject to your con
trol. If you're going to let him vent
his political spleen, as he has ob
viously been doing in at least three
articles this quarter (October 1, 6, 7),
you should in fairness set up a simi
lar column for the opposite side;
then let the boys fight it out.
To say that your sporfs editor can
supply the need is ridiculous. Mr.
Klauber is expected to gripe about
referees, not presidents. However, I
had supposed that Our Hasher was
strictly local until I saw that rather
suspicious anecdote of October 6th.
You say you are a liberal, that
your viewpoint is objective. Can you
then allow the free use of your col
umn to Mr. Eisenbach? Certainly no
one who supports his views by the
simple method of labeling Landon a
"newspaper feature service charac
ter" and Knox a "quack doctor," a
"stinkaroo," and a "fourth-string
lago," and praises Roosevelt for be
ing a "golden voice of radio," Cactus
Jack for a "Willie Howard," and
Farley for "a lovable ass of the
world, etc.," can be considered an
objective political commentator.
Mr. Eisenbach doesn't even con
sider the campaign worth thinking
about outside the "bath-room." If
you're going to print that kind of rot,
why don't you label it "Political Ad
vertisement" or something?
Stanford has been a Republican
stronghold, even in '32. There is no
reason to believe it has changed this
year. Therefore, worst of all, you
cannot claim to represent the major
ity of students. I, for one, do not in
tend to support Roosevelt and easy

I money. I have not been charmed by
