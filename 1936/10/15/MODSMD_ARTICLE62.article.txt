I here still persist those critics
who refuse to accept Hollywood as
any other than the defiler of the
arts, panderer to passion and me
diocrity. And they have a formidable
case.
The public determines box office
receipts, and in the film industry box
office receipts determine the success
of a production. Well, producers
wag, the public doesn't go to a movie
to see a great comedy or a great
tragedy, things suggesting a vague
and fearful uplift; it goes to be en
tertained, which is entirely different.
It wants romance and plenty of
excitement, and a happv ending. It
gets it, in large doses administered
by its darlings, the Crawfords and
Taylors and Gables of the moment.
The public asks for indifferent actors
and feeble scenarios; as long as it
does it will be fed more of them. Still
the producer's argument.
But it doesn't stop here. When Hol
lywood makes finer productions
critics still hum. Given genuine ac
tors, a worthy story, they maintain
the talking picture still is no fit me
dium for dramatic expression. In the
first place, with the intx-oduction oJ

Reality has been substituted for
