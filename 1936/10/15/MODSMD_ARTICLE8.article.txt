# Gordy Davis Says Students Careless
## 
### 
According to Gordy Davis, campus
traffic officer, the number of acci
dents this quarter has been prac
tically negligible. There have been
only two small collisions, in which
nobody has been injured.
Davis pointed out, however, that
students are still careless. One of the
accidents was caused when the driv
er failed to make a stop, and the
other happened as a student at
tempted to drive at a good clip while
watching a football game on a near
by lawn.
The campus cop also said that
there are two ordinances drivers are j
frequently disobeying, namely, the
20-mile zone along the quad, and
parking regulations at the post office.
