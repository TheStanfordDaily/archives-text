# Flood of New Men To Visit Row Today
## Rushing Starts At 11:30; Luncheon, Bull, Dinner Dates May Be Made 
### George Veness 
Over 800 new men will head up
the Row this morning for their first
experience in the whys and where
fores of Greek life.
Sharp at 11:30 o'clock cars will
start carrying freshly burnished
frosh and anxious transfers from
various points of vantage around
Encina, and "the Big Oak in front
of the Li be."
Three Dates Allowed
Three dates are possible today, in
cluding luncheon until 2 p.m., after
noon of football or "bull" from 2 un
til 5 p.m., and dinner from 6 o'clock
till midnight. Tomorrow two dates
are available from 11:30 a.m. till 2
p.m., and 2 until 5 p.m. Frosh may
accept no more than two dates with
any one house during this period.
In response to several requests
concerning the manner of dress con
sidered proper for a rushee to wear,
the following consensus of opinion
has been garnered from various Row
authorities.
For lunch ordinary school clothes
are the custom. Coats and ties are
commonly worn for all evening
functions. Regarding the new after
noon rushing period, it is advisable
to wear rather hardy garments to
withstand the possible depreciation
caused by football or baseball games.
Ask Rule Meaning
Question has come from both Row
and frosh concerning the meaning
of that rushing rule which states that
"contact of an informal nature be
tween new lower division men- and
fraternity men is permissible."
Bob Hoover, president of the In
terfraternity Council and Board, in
terprets the rule by listing the fol
lowing salient points:
1. No more than three fraternity
men may contact a ireshman outside
Encina.
2. They may not go to the resi
dence of any fraternity man (active
or alumnus) anywhere on the cam
pus.
3. Going to the Union or else
where for refreshment is not per
missible.
4. The time allowed for such con
tact is not stated but is left to the
discretion of the fraternityâ€”with the
full understanding that any abuse of
privilege will be dealt with by the
Interfraternity Board.
5. All other rushing rules must be
followed explicitly: viz., "no off
campus rushing."
