# New Road Opens, Famous Lover's Lane Closed
## 
### 

THIS IS PRETTY DEGRADING STUFF 1 to he happening on the
campus, hut when the tractor gets through chewing up Serra Street
and the road is surfaced and finished by October 24, Encina freshmen
will have a new outlet for their new automobiles, and there will be
diagonal-parking room for the cars that now clutter up the Quad. To
the right, Governor's Lane is completely closed for the first time. So
the couple sits on the bumper and tries to figure out if it is falling
eucalyptus limbs, or just falling that has closed the historic parkway.
