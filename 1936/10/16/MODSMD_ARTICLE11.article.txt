# Farm To Honor U.S.C. at Dance
## School Fight Songs To Be "Swung" By Nagel 
### 
In honor of the Trojan supporters
who will invade the campus for the
week-end of the S.C. game, the
A.S.S.U. will hold its first dance of
the year a week from tomorrow in
the Women's Gym from 9 to 12
o'clock.
Freddie Nagel and his twelve
piece orchestra will furnish the mu
sic with Shirley Jones, Stanford
songstress, as guest artist. Nagel
promises that other campus enter
tainers will be at the dance to do
their part. A feature of the evening
will be the special "swing" arrange
ments which are being prepared of
"Come Join the Band" and "Fight
On for U.S.C."
Tickets for the dance will go on
sale Monday in the A.S.S.U. offices
and in front of the Post Office for
$1 per couple.
Decorations of a suitable motif are
being prepared, and Mark Hopkins,
dance chairman, states that refresh
ments will be served. On the dance
committee are Jackie Brown, Wayne
Richardson, Jack Grover, and John
Rice.
