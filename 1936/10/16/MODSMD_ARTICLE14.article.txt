### HARRY PRESS 
What does a European student
think of Stanford?
Size of the campus and the great
number of student-owned cars arc
two things about the Farm which
have most impressed Hans Erich
Schurer, German exchange student.
' In Germany," he estimates, "about
1000 out of 40,000 students have cars,
and they are just small autos, noth
ing like you have here."
Schurer, who is now living at the
Phi Delt house, is on his first visit to
America. He is an exchange student
together with Dick Stark, last year's
yell king, now attending the Uni
versity of Heidelberg.
A graduate student in chemistry.
Schurer intends to return to Ger
many to do research work. Here he
is studying languages, though he al
i ady speaks English, Spanish, and
French fluently.

Hp has attended two German uni
versities. "First," he stated, "I went
to Munich which has an enrollment
of 14,000. Then I studied at Wurz
burg, which has 5,000. You see, in
Germany universities are named af
ter the towns in which they are
located."
Describes Universities
"There is no campus at either,"
he continued. "The buildings arc
not located together, but are scat
tered throughout the city. Living
quarters are not provided by the
universities, and students live in
private homes and rooms."
Hiding, skiing, sailing, and rowing
are Schurer's favorite sports. Be
sides his student activities, he was ii
♦he anti-aircraft division of the army
for over a year and was a Storir
Trooper for one and one-half years
At a labor camp, the purpose o
i which is to knit city and country

people closer together, he had "two
enjoyable months."

The exchange student is the neph
ew of one of the world's greatest ex
perts on spas, Professor Haertl of
Germany, who helped President
Roosevelt construct the famous
Warm Springs Foundation.
After completing three quarters at
Stanford, Schurer intends to return
to Germany in a unique way. "1
want four or more students to go
with me on the return voyage," he
says. "We will go by boat to Cal
cutta, stopping over in Japan. From
Calcutta we will travel by car back
to Germany."
When Schurer arrived in America
this year on September 13, he bought
a car in Now York and drove across
the country alone in five days. "It
wasn t hard," he laughed. "I've been
i driving for years in Germany."

Germany universities are named af
ter the towns in which they are
located."

"There is no campus at either,"
he continued. "The buildings arc
not located together, but are scat
tered throughout the city. Living
quarters are not provided by the
universities, and students live in
private homes and rooms."
Hiding, skiing, sailing, and rowing
are Schurer's favorite sports. Be
sides his student activities, he was ii

Calcutta we will travel by car back
to Germany."
When Schurer arrived in America

wasn t hard," he laughed. "I've been
i driving for years in Germany."

Size of the campus and the great
number of student-owned cars arc
two things about the Farm which
have most impressed Hans Erich
Schurer, German exchange student.
' In Germany," he estimates, "about
1000 out of 40,000 students have cars,
and they are just small autos, noth
ing like you have here."
