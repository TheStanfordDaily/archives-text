# Upperclassmen Dance While Frosh Gripe at Roble Jolly-up
## Over 600 Attend Affair In Women's Gym 
### 
Over GOO students crowded onto
the dance floor in the women's gym
from 7 to 8 o'clock last night for
the Roble jolly-up, where the fresh
man women were hostesses to all the
men of the college.
It was estimated that only half of
Encina was there: the rest of the
men were upperclassmen. All of
Roble did not attend.
Several disillusioned freshmen,
fleeing from the official red ribbons
of the Roble "man-catchers," said
that they were never coming to an
other function of this kind. Why
should they turn out, they demand
ed, when theie weren't enough
women to dance with, and the up
perclassmen monopolized all the
popular ones?
Encinamen Dislike Idea
The Encinans are not shy, they de
clared. 7'hey just disliked the whole
idea of jolly-ups. Strangely enough,
the women not dancing complained
of the same thing.
"If you have a quick little figure,"
said one who asked to remain
anonymous, "and dance with a good
looking man to start with, you'll go
sailing. Dance the first one with a
pill and no other man will cut in.
Don't dance at all and no really
'sophisticated' man will ask you.
"For these reasons, I think Stan
ford jolly-ups are the most cruel in
ventions I have ever seen."
Girls Get Servile
Too many splendid girls get Ihc
idea that there is something terribly
wrong with them, another declared,
and feel almost servile to any man,
however undesirable, who takes
them from the waiting line. Women
have no light to be hurt because
they don't appeal immediately to
some man who "looks them over
that way."
In spite of these opinions, upper
classmen seemed to think these get
together dances arc fun. As Win
stead (Doodles) Weaver said: "Men
that like girls and dance a lot go to
them always —so there isn't much
place for the freshmen to get ac
quainted.
"1 go to them because I like them
— think that the freshman women
arc getting better. If you think this
is terrible, you should have seen the
way the frumps of a year or so were
treated. And more men would have
come to dance with Roble if it had
been advertised better."
Playing for the dance was the first
appearance of Ken Klee's all-campus
orchestra, featuring Yvonne Benttie
singing "I m an Old Cowhand." "Be
twe en the Devil and the Deep Blue
Sea, and "I Can't Escape from
You."

It was estimated that only half of
Encina was there: the rest of the
men were upperclassmen. All of
Roble did not attend.
Several disillusioned freshmen,
fleeing from the official red ribbons
of the Roble "man-catchers," said
that they were never coming to an
other function of this kind. Why
should they turn out, they demand
ed, when theie weren't enough
women to dance with, and the up
perclassmen monopolized all the
popular ones?
Encinamen Dislike Idea
The Encinans are not shy, they de
clared. 7'hey just disliked the whole
idea of jolly-ups. Strangely enough,
the women not dancing complained
of the same thing.
"If you have a quick little figure,"
said one who asked to remain
anonymous, "and dance with a good
looking man to start with, you'll go
sailing. Dance the first one with a
pill and no other man will cut in.
Don't dance at all and no really
'sophisticated' man will ask you.
"For these reasons, I think Stan
ford jolly-ups are the most cruel in
ventions I have ever seen."
Girls Get Servile
Too many splendid girls get Ihc
idea that there is something terribly
wrong with them, another declared,
and feel almost servile to any man,
however undesirable, who takes
them from the waiting line. Women
have no light to be hurt because
they don't appeal immediately to
some man who "looks them over
that way."
In spite of these opinions, upper
classmen seemed to think these get
together dances arc fun. As Win
stead (Doodles) Weaver said: "Men
that like girls and dance a lot go to
them always —so there isn't much
place for the freshmen to get ac
quainted.
"1 go to them because I like them
— think that the freshman women
arc getting better. If you think this
is terrible, you should have seen the
way the frumps of a year or so were
treated. And more men would have
come to dance with Roble if it had
been advertised better."
Playing for the dance was the first
appearance of Ken Klee's all-campus
orchestra, featuring Yvonne Benttie
singing "I m an Old Cowhand." "Be
twe en the Devil and the Deep Blue
Sea, and "I Can't Escape from
You."
Over GOO students crowded onto
the dance floor in the women's gym
