# Week-end Teas Fete Robleites
## Pan-Hell to Entertain In Women's Clubhouse 
### 
Roble women will be honored at a
series of teas to be given this after
noon, tomorrow, and Sunday by
Pan-Hellenic Council.
Designed merely to afford the op
portunity for Roble aiid Row women
to meet informally, the functions are
non-selective, and not considered
rushing. The teas will be held from
3 to 5 o'clock upstairs in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
Roble and Row women have been
divided into three groups, each
group to be present at one of the
teas. Today and tomorrow Quad
clothes will be appropriate, while
Sunday dressy sport will be the type
of clothes worn.
As transfer women may have con
tact with Row women all during the
year, they are not included in the
teas. All freshman women are in
vited.
Because of the inconvenience con
nected with entertaining a large
number at a time, Women's Confer
ence party has been discontinued
this year, and these Pan-Hellenic
teas are to take its plaÂ«e.
