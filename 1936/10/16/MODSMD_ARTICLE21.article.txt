ment was in almost constant action

niture Company, menaced ;yi entire
block of frame dwellings, destroying
one structure, and disrupted tele
phone service for more than two
hours.
Cotton Iturns

California Cotton Mills, several hun
dred bales of cotton, valued at $fis
a bale, were consumed by flumes.
At Pittsburg, a 70-mile gale sent
boats scurrying for cover on the
Sacramento River, sinking three
anchored fishing boats and disab
ling a pleasure craft. The wind
lashed the river into high waves
and piled several boats on shore.

river. A dust storm also was re
ported in the San Jose district.
