## 
### Lloyd Lapham 
Only four of the five A.S.S.U. offi
cers, scheduled to survive yester
day's ordeal by ballot, had been de
termined at a late hour hist night.
According to the election commit
tee's count no candidate for Wom
en's Council hud obtained a clear
majority.
The four winners are Ben Dey and
Luuis Tsoutsouvas, Men's Council;
Larry Rouble, long-term graduate
member of Ex Committee; and Joe
Burris, short-term graduate member
of Ex Committee.
Heavy Vote
The highest total of valid ballots
was 112(5, cast for Men's Council.
Dave Allison, election chairman,
characterized the vote as "quite
heavy for a special election." He
also stated that a large number of
votes had to be thrown out because
of pencil markings or because the
regulation cross mark was not used.
System Baffling
Baffled by the preferential vote
system, election committee members
refused to name a winner in the
Women's Council contest. Dave Al
lison, chairman, said:
"The vote was so close that we
wanted to be sure that our method
of counting was correct. We want to
have either Mr. Cottrell or Mr. Mc-
Dowell check on us. They are both
out of town. So, the question of
whether there is u winner, or wheth
er a new election must be held, will
have to wait over the week-end."

the second choice votes on the bal
lots of the candidates below the top
two are counted. Those for the top
two are added to their totals. If
neither has a majority of the origi
nal number of ballots, the third
choices are counted in the same way.
Rouble and Tsoutsouvas won by
wide margins. Dey led a group of
six aspirants in the race for the
second Men's Council position by
only a few votes. In the contest for
short-term graduate Ex Committee
member no candidate had a clear
majority on first-choice vote. Burris
won on the second-choice recount.
