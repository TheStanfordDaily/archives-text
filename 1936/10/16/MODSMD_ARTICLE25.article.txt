THE PIG GOT UP
San Francisco has witnessed an- |
other drunken debauch.
On this occasion it was Amos the
duck, who, according to "Time," j
spent one hilarious Saturday eve
ning making the rounds with his
master. The representative of the
S.P.C.A. said Amos was the drunkest (
duck he ever saw. Amos, he said, ]
would stand up on the bar, quaff a j
foaming beaker, and then go bounc- 1
ing off into a ground loop, skid off '
the bar, and tailspin to the floor.
There must be something about
San Francisco that is conducive to
Babylonian revelry, for Amos the j
duck, who had to have somebody
along with him to show him the
ropes, was almost a babe in arms
compared to the dog Sandy. Sandy,
according to reports, was an experi- j
i need and confirmed pub-crawler, j
lis method was to enter the beer I
hall on the corner, put his paws on!
ihe bar, bark until somebody set
him up to a couple of free ones, and |
i ten come rolling home in the ap
proved and conventional manner.
And lately there has been floating
:ibout the unauthenticated rumor j
that when the Grace Brothers brew
c y in Santa Rosa burned down the i
i reels ran with beer and when the |
dugs opened their mouths the next j
i: irning to bark, Ihey burped.

Animals in a looped condition act j
pretty much the same as human be- j
. ;s, but animals are distinctly fur
-11 'r down on the social scale for
thoy do not feel that one drink re
ni.ires them to live up to a certain 1
k.ndard of alcoholic behavior.
On the night we put whiskey in !
ho cat lapped a bit and walked
; round without suspicion. But the
hot was heavy* and the mule kicked !
hu d in a minute or two. At this
pc nt, the cat, who had not seen an- !
other cat drunk before and conse
quently was not sophisticated in the
111; nner of some women, did not pick
r.p the saucer and wave it about.
Ti' ? pussy wobbled a bit, batted its
c;;.s in complete bewilderment, then
'..it over to its bed and jumped in
w it came around the room for the
th. d time.

3ut humans in an alcoholic fog
fee 1 an overwhelming urge to be
•nals. Every party displays at
1 si one guest who is firmly con
vh.ced that he is not Tarzan but
Ti -zan's ape as he swings from
v,' ter to chandelier. The front lawn
o; the old Bastile has witnessed sev
c 1 inebriates who waddled up the
pe like seals, slapped their hands
Ir, ether like flippers, and barked for

someone to throw them a fish. And I
have written elsewhere of the young
man who thought he was an alligator
and insisted on swimming along the
ground on his stomach.
Drunk animals act like humans,
drunk humans act like animals, all
brothers in that one great frater
nity, so why should the pig of the
famous song ever have gotten up and
slowly walked away?
