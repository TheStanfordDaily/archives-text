# Farm Backs '36 Gridders; Ticket Sale Sets Mark
## 
### 
Here's a paradox:
When Stanford's "vowing sopho
mores" brought victories home to the
Farm, less than 3000 rooters attended
the Big Game. â€¢ !
Now with a new team getting un
der way, students will Hock to the
game and sales have reached a high
topping the last two years.
In 1935, only 2700 tickets were
sold; in 1934, when the game was at
California, 2900. Of this year's 3000,
750 are women.
Alumni applications will ,be filled
now and after all allotments are
made, the remaining tickets will be
on general sale at $4.40.
