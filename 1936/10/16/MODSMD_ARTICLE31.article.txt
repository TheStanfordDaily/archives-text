# Robinson Receives Valuable Pictures
## 
### 
One dozen priceless engravings
went out of the President's office
into that of history Professor E. E.
Robinson, high in the turret of En
glish Corner, yesterday. These val
uable antique works of art, depict
ing scenes in American history, will
go to the libe, there to be hung in
room 311, the history department's
star chamber of seminar proceedings.
The engravings, once important
items in the art collection of the late
Timothy Hopkins, have been pre
sented to the University by Mrs.
Hopkins. The subjects, executed in a
manner now seldom if ever seen in
modern work, depict such incidents
as the landing of the Pilgrims, the
marriage of Pocahontas, and the Bat
tle of Bunker Hill.
