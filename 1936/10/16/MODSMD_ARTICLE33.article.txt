## IN DEFENSE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Up until this moment nothing has
been said in favor of that widespread
curse, the Fall head-cold. However, 1
my impartial tendencies force me to
come lo the defense cf this time
honored "institution." If the cold is
of the substantial variety, it nullifies
the chlorine taste prevalent in the
lousy water on our glorious campus.
And so, as millions of others have
sagely remarked, "It's an ill wind,
etc."
