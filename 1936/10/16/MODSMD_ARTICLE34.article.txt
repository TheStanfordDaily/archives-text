The Editor, Sir:
In reading and viewing several of
the pasl issues of (he Stanford Daily,
it seems to me that some of the less
noted members of the staff are plac
ing their own political views ahead
of those of the Daily.
It is an accepted fact that the
Daily is supposed to be non-partisan.
By the pictorial matter it appears
to be nonpart' for Landon.
One of our more noted professors
of the journalism department related
in class that the only reason a paper
supported the Democratic party was
for the profit involved. What is the
Daily's cut?
Down in Orange County, a beauti
ful blossom in the heart of Southern
California, the Democrats had to buy

a weekly paper to obtain the support
of the press.
With such interests represented
on the campus, it seems only fair
that the Landonites are entitled to
as much space as the present Na
tional Government Revolutionist.
I remain wearing my Landon but
