# A 						SECOND

The Editor, Sir:
Are we interested and do we hear
a second? Yes! The idea of reno
vating the boathouse for an all
campus clubhouse is fine and should
be heartily approved by the entire
student body. No more attractive
place could be designed than the
edge of the lake for such a house so
that boaters and swimmers could be
refreshed on hot afternoons.
An attractive place lor students
to relax is a grand one and we are
more than enthusiastic about the
idea.

The Editor, Sir:
Can I add just one more shoulder
to the wheel and ask when in blazes
that road in front of Encina is going
to be reopened? Seems to me the
boys in charge are a lot like house
managers—they let the thing drag
during summer, and then cut it up
just before we got back to school.
Seriously, though, the thing is
quite an inconvenience. How soon'll
it be? done ar.d ready?
Ed. Note—According io yesterdaj's
Drppy, page four, column 6. the sec
tion of Serra Road directly in front
of Encina will be finished in three
days. The road in front of Theater
will he ready hy Oct. 24. Reason that
it wasn't undertaken sooner, accord
ing to J. W. McDonnell, superintend
ent of buildings and grounds, is that
money for projects undertaken un
der this year's budget cannot be
started until after the first of Sep
tember, the date on which the an
nual budget is made out.

The idea of turning the Lagunita
Boathouse into a place for informal
dancing is a grand one.
I, for one, am behind this move
ment and will do anything in my
power to help.
