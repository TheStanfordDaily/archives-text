legions moved relentlessly on Madrid
today, cutting a bloody swath
through Loyalist lines in their drive
on (he capital which, within two
weeks, may be in a state of siege.
Russia's determination to bolt the
Spanish Non-intervention Pact be
cause of alleged foreign aid to the
insurgents, was believed to have
precipitated the rebel advance.
The rebel drive on Navalperal,
San Martin de Valdeiglesias, Santa
Cruz del Retamar, Barbas and Moce
jon showed every sign of being hur
ried and unprepared. One official
suggested (he international situation
may have caused the rebel command
to begin the offensive before com
munications lines and supplies could
be safeguarded.
The same reason caused the Mad
vid defense Junta to speed up an
idequate defense line around the
ity. It called on every able-bodied
'.an not at the front to join in the
ork of constructing forts and
\nches.
