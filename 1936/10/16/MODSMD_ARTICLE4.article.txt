# Sailors' Union Refuses Peace
## Co-operation Pledged To Federal Board 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15 —
Sailors' Union officials, disclaiming
any intention to bolt a workers'
"solid front," said tonight their lo
cals were refusing to take strike
votes requested by union peace ne
gotiators and that the sailors would
give the Federal Maritice Commis
sion "absolute and unrestricted co
operation."
Spokesmen for two other big mari
time unions said their groups were
contemplating falling in line with
the sailors.
The announcements came while
the joint negotiating committee of
the waterfront unions were consid
ering a renewed request of the Mar
itime Commission for an uncondi
tional truce in the current shipping
labor crisis.
Employers previously agreed to
an indefinite truce to supplant the
current truce ending at midnight to
night. The union negotiators how
ever consented only to a truce until
October 26.
When the Maritime Commission
renewed its demand on the unions
for an unconditional commitment the
negotiating committee called for a
referendum among the 37,000 Coast
maritime workers on the question of
a strike to start October 28 if peace
had not been made before then.
