# SAVELLE SEES EVENTUAL DEMOCRACY RISE IN SPAIN
## 
### 
When the fighting began in July, j
the factions were divided into leftist i
republicans and reactionaries. But as '
time went on, the government phi- I
losophy advanced to socialism and
the reactionaries went over to pure
Fascism, Savelle explained.
Fascism Planned
"General Francisco Franco, head
of the rebel army, intends to set up
a totalitarian state based on Mus
solini's in Italy. He promises a gov
ernment by experts whose authority
v/ill be unlimited," said the profes
sor. ''His philosophy, like that of
Hitler and of Mussolini, seems to be
that each individual is reduced to
his duty to the state."
Savelle said he thought that even
tually the same predicament would
face France, but that democracy
would in the end outlast Fascism.
"Though a fascist dictatorship will
probably be set up in Spain, democ
racy will triumph eventually," Max
well H. Savelle, professor of history,
told the newly formed "Current
Events" class at its second meeting
yesterday.
Savelle based his "Spanish Re
bellion" speech partly upon personal
experiences in Europe this summer.-
His family was caught in Spain when
the rebellion broke out and he spent i
a month in negotiations to get them,
across the border.
Lahor-Capita!
"The Spanish rebellion is the out- :
growth of movements typical of all

Europe,' he declared. "The workers
were dissatisfied with their status
and when they tried to set up a more
liberal government, those opposed —
the militarists, the industrialists, the
church, and the landed interests —
x'evolted."
