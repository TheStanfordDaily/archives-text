Football Afoot: Zwierlein's advo
cates two types of stadium footwear.
(1) The mud hound model, frankly
a common breed that will, however,
dog your footsteps faithfully and
everlastingly and treat your pups
with respect. This particular hound
is brown, thistle grained calf, and

thick-soled to keep the damp out.
(2) Number two is grey or brown
bucko, a dcmi-mnccasin type, mold
ed along svelt Bal lines, with a
resilient, pure gum sole. You can
have these and still pay your sylla
bus fees.
ZWIERLEIN, WALK-OVER

Scoring Points. Phelps-Terkel ad
vances. (1) Spendthrift, heather wool
cardigan sweaters which have the
tenuous softness of Highland thistle,
and a perennial wearability for
Scotch thrift. (2) A boldly British,
glen-plaid imported top-coat, cut
fully and freely, unconfined by
seams and lines. (3) The pork-pie
hats in any colors you want.
PHELPS-TERKEL
Lest You Forget: Better order now
for Big Game Night corsages. The
Flower Shop will translate whatever
ideas you have into gardenias, into
cape jasmine, a fragile opalescent
blossom with a luxurious fragrance,
and lustrous deep green foliage, or
into orchids, which are eloquent in
their own behalfs.
THE FLOWER SHOP
Big Game Night. Phelps-Terkel's
midnight blue, combination tux and
tails; the coats are interchangeable,
and Phelps-Terkel will advtse you to
get both cut double breasted; their

conservative cuff links and studs
which have the good taste not to
simulate real gems for $3.50; and
Zwierlein's two types of tux shoes
which are classic and reasonable.
Advantages: Zwierlein's deep
piled beaver pantoufffes, bedroom
slippers which are as comfortable as
they sound . . . Terkel's bathrobe
of blue denim, notched at the lapels,
and edged with white piping . . .
Their frosted crystal decanter, bear
ing the explicit conscription, "Gin,"
in gothic leters. •

This half, column down, will give
a resume of significant fashion tacts
culled from local store to Stanford
co-eds.

Football Afoot: Zwierlein's advo
cates two types of stadium footwear.
(1) The mud hound model, frankly
a common breed that will, however,
dog your footsteps faithfully and
everlastingly and treat your pups
with respect. This particular hound
is brown, thistle grained calf, and

thick-soled to keep the damp out.
(2) Number two is grey or brown
bucko, a dcmi-mnccasin type, mold
ed along svelt Bal lines, with a
resilient, pure gum sole. You can
have these and still pay your sylla
bus fees.
ZWIERLEIN, WALK-OVER

Scoring Points. Phelps-Terkel ad
vances. (1) Spendthrift, heather wool
cardigan sweaters which have the
tenuous softness of Highland thistle,
and a perennial wearability for
Scotch thrift. (2) A boldly British,
glen-plaid imported top-coat, cut
fully and freely, unconfined by
seams and lines. (3) The pork-pie
hats in any colors you want.
PHELPS-TERKEL
Lest You Forget: Better order now
for Big Game Night corsages. The
Flower Shop will translate whatever
ideas you have into gardenias, into
cape jasmine, a fragile opalescent
blossom with a luxurious fragrance,
and lustrous deep green foliage, or
into orchids, which are eloquent in
their own behalfs.
THE FLOWER SHOP
Big Game Night. Phelps-Terkel's
midnight blue, combination tux and
tails; the coats are interchangeable,
and Phelps-Terkel will advtse you to
get both cut double breasted; their

conservative cuff links and studs
which have the good taste not to
simulate real gems for $3.50; and
Zwierlein's two types of tux shoes
which are classic and reasonable.
Advantages: Zwierlein's deep
piled beaver pantoufffes, bedroom
slippers which are as comfortable as
they sound . . . Terkel's bathrobe
of blue denim, notched at the lapels,
and edged with white piping . . .
Their frosted crystal decanter, bear
ing the explicit conscription, "Gin,"
in gothic leters. •

This half, column down, will give
a resume of significant fashion tacts
culled from local store to Stanford
co-eds.
