# BIG GAME DAY
## 
### 
Mary Elizabeth features a unique
liaison between a fully sleeved jack
et of the dressy genre, appliqued
with two pseudo-astrakhan patch
pockets and a singularly rugged lit
tle brown plaid dress, trim, neat, and
professional.
Then she has a warm spice colored
tunic, adorned with two rotund
buttons and crested with quaint,
hand-carved wooden figures which
look like characters from Dickens.
The dress flaunts a brown velvet
ascot tie and belt.
