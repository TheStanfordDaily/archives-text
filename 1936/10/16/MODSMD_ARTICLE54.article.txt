# FOR BIG GAME NIGHT
## 
### 
Sue Berry offers a fabulous Main
boehery hammered satin sculptored
on suave lines, and executed in jewel
tone rose. A torsade mounts the
throat, and in back there is an ap
pendage which is artfully manipu
lated into a cape when the occasion
demands.
Sue Berry also has a Schiaperelli
for little evenings and hotel dancing
in a heavy black crepe, corded down
the front with white scrollwork. It

is a dress redolent of Imperial Rus
sia and its cossacks.
Stadium Shoes: Thoit's have a
shaggy "Scotty" model of reversible
calfskin whose fibers are intact and
unkempt, and a smoother variation
of that model in oxford brown. This
shoe falls quite naturally into the
category of tweeds and nubby hand
knots.
Oh Romeo, My Romeo: Roos
Brothers Beauty Salon will coiff
yotir hair like Norma Shearer's as
she plays Juliet. The knob is long
and there is a glossy aureole at the
nape of your neck.
