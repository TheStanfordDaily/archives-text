# New Spirit Marks Grid Workouts
## Practice Sessions Run Past Dark as Squad Drives for Trojans 
### Herb Diamond 
Every radio announcer who, from
hi.s perch high on the rim of a foot
ball stadium, has reported "grim de
termination" on faces ought to wit
ness one of the Indians' practice ses
sions and really see what "grim de
termination" looks like.
Current reports would have it that
Tiny Thornhill's charges lack spirit,
lack defense, lack offense, and lack a
few other things. And thi.s is in
deed a sad state of affairs, when no
credit at all goes to a squad of se
rious-minded gridsters who have
been and still are trying their level
best.
When any one of them misses a
pass or a tackle in a drill, lie's plenty
irritated about it. And what's more,
the whole outfit keeps up its en
ergy nightly through the closing sec
onds of the longest workouts ever
recorded on the Farm. Practice was
so late Wednesday that the watch
man didn't turn the lights off all
night.
Dana Visits
Ihe fact that Herb Dana paid
Thornhill and Graduate Manager A1
Masters a social call Wednesday af
ternoon seems to have given rise to
reports, all unofficial, that the Coast
grid czar i.s working 'un the recent
Bobby Morris episode. Stanford
spokesmen had nothing to say on the
subject, and Morris is still on the
list to officiate in the Redskin-Tro
jan contest.
Tiny's present plans for the com
ing week include maximum stressing
of pass plays, and a quest for more
speed in the backfield, more ball
carrying ability, and halfback re
serve strength. What may be a spine
injury will keep Leo Madlem on the
sidelines lor the rest of the season,
so Thornhill has moved Doc Luck
ett, former quarter, to left half,
where he'll back up Jimmy Coffis.
Gamier Moves
In at quarter went Ed Gamier,
who gained some experience at that
post during his freshman days. Gar
nier ha.s been used at left half this
year, and shows signs of becoming
a dependable ball-toter as well as an
efficient blocker.
Thornhill took no chances in last
night's scrimmage. Grant Stone,
Jack Clark, Pete Zagar, Rog Munger,
and Joe Vigna, all suffering from
minor hurtsâ€”were kept out of the
tussles and took relatively light
workouts.
