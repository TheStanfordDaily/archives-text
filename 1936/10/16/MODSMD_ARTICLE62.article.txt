'Twas midnight of a Thursday
night; all was quiet in the Daily
shack; everybody must have been
tight.
"Knock-knock," said a familiar
voice. One* of the stooges pulled
himself out of his lethargy long
enuf to mumble "Who's there?" and
immediately returned to his snoring.
"Isadore," returned the voice.
"Somebody's got to finish this
thing," raved the nite ed, as he said
"Isadore who?"
"Isadore open?" returned the voice
in a maniacal tone as he crawled in
on his nose.
"NO!" screamed the nite ed. But
his yells werrj of no help in keeping
out the punster.
"I know it was lousy," said Isa
dore, "but I had to get in somehow.
I heard a vague rumor that you
mugs decided to become forecasters.
Since you should never caster bridge
b fore you come to it, I decided that
iny services were needed. Yea and
verily. I have come. T. Isadore
Drofnats, ready and waiting, gentle
men."
"Yippee," remarked the nite ed
with a decided lack of enthusiasm.
"Go.sh, you guys are lucky I'm
here. When my two sons, Jonathan
Drofnats and Sylvester Jehosephat
Drofnats, rolled out on their ears, I
realized something had to be done.
To here I am, ready to get a broad
â–  ducation. and here I go. Hold on
light."
