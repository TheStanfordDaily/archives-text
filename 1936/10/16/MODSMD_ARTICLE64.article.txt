# SIDELINE SLANTS

QUIET, PLEASK
Wlih an open date tomorrow
there'll be no better chance than
now to clean oft the desk.
Once in a while some of us look
at the edit page of this rag. In
glancing over the thing yesterday I
find that a small issue is evolving:
In an election year should Sideline
Slants devote itself to things polit
ical?
I think not, and shall not. Little
good could come from a lot of rant
ing about the punting averages of
the Republican and Democratic
teams last week, but some one of
these days, if the Daily becomes too
one-sided, you might find tidbits of
propaganda thrusting themselves
out, in efforts, before the score
mounts too high against us, to find a
good substitute for the Golden
Voiced Quarterback.
You think these coaches of ours
are a lot of old beerguts that stand
around and give orders. Not so.
Winkleman and Lawson were
teaching the boys a play the other
night that didn't seem to work—the
first string were defending against it
admirably. So Ben went in and toss
ed the deep pass to Jim; Coffis had
Lawson perfectly covered, but the
latter showed his all-American
properties by simply grabbing it
anyway.
Ends that can jump up in the midst
of a couple of defensive backs and
still grab the ball are something. Re
member Monk?
Then Grayson was running
through the boys a couple of times
in tackling practice yesterday. His
ankle seems to be fully recovered.
Payoff, though, was Rouble and
Muller in scrimmage with the frosh.
They would gang up on Larry and
he would grunt like a tiger to make
his tackles. Pretty soon he began to
bleed over one eye and caught more
disparaging remarks from the on
lookers.
Muller was funnier—kidding Rou
ble all the time while he would
calmly walk in the way of the plays
that came his way.
A beefy guy was out talking to
Liebendorfer at the first secret drill,
someone nobody seemed to know.
Dink Templeton said "Scotchy
Campbell" and a lot of things came
to mind—the 1923 season, Andy
Kerr, present Colgate coach, in
charge at Stanford, preaching the
gospel of the double wingback, in
preparation for Warner's arrival the
next year.
Scotchy Campbell was captain and
quarterback in '23; they won some
and lost some, including to Cal and
U.S.C. Wonder what Campbell
thought of this year's team compared
with his, and of the other changes
that have come over this joint since
he was here.

Intramural football is on again, i
bigger than ever before, by 150 per j
cent in number of teams. This is not ,
meant as a flaunt to the number of
powers around that want the sport i
abandoned as too dangerous; the ar- j
gument of injuries per man-hour of
playing when compared with other !
college sports always comes first.
There have been a lot of sugges
tions that we have volleyball as an
intramural sport this year, perhaps
play it at night during spring quar
ter, on the basketball floor in En
cina Gym. And others have clam- !
bered to have the intramural cross
country run, discontinued three
years ago, re-established. Anybody
in favor of these?
The Stanford Illustrated Review. I
alumni magazine, is still putting out j
its little football weekly, started last 1
year. Harlow Rothert writes most of
them (Dink Templeton did the Ore- j
gon game.)
It is a four-page affair, with a I

deeper analysis of each game than
that given in the Sunday papers,
but still not like these "What's
Wrong—" to which the Chronicle
has given birth this year. With pic
tures, statistics, and a little dope on
the Frosh each week, the sheet is
neat, concise, and complete. I'd like
to pass on to Harlow some of the
compliments I've heard about it.
If any of you are hard up for
some excitement, take a ride across
the bay tomorrow. Anything can
happen in those all-California jousts,
and often does. —Klauber

There have been a lot of sugges

play it at night during spring quar

find that a small issue is evolving:
In an election year should Sideline
Slants devote itself to things polit
ical?
I think not, and shall not. Little
good could come from a lot of rant
ing about the punting averages of
the Republican and Democratic
teams last week, but some one of
these days, if the Daily becomes too
one-sided, you might find tidbits of
propaganda thrusting themselves
out, in efforts, before the score
mounts too high against us, to find a
good substitute for the Golden
Voiced Quarterback.

are a lot of old beerguts that stand

Winkleman and Lawson were
teaching the boys a play the other
night that didn't seem to work—the
first string were defending against it
admirably. So Ben went in and toss
ed the deep pass to Jim; Coffis had
Lawson perfectly covered, but the
latter showed his all-American
properties by simply grabbing it
anyway.
Ends that can jump up in the midst
of a couple of defensive backs and
still grab the ball are something. Re

Then Grayson was running
through the boys a couple of times
in tackling practice yesterday. His
ankle seems to be fully recovered.
Payoff, though, was Rouble and
Muller in scrimmage with the frosh.
They would gang up on Larry and
he would grunt like a tiger to make
his tackles. Pretty soon he began to
bleed over one eye and caught more
disparaging remarks from the on
lookers.
Muller was funnier—kidding Rou

calmly walk in the way of the plays
that came his way.
A beefy guy was out talking to
Liebendorfer at the first secret drill,

out, in efforts, before the score
mounts too high against us, to find a
good substitute for the Golden
Voiced Quarterback.
You think these coaches of ours
are a lot of old beerguts that stand
around and give orders. Not so.
Winkleman and Lawson were
teaching the boys a play the other
night that didn't seem to work—the
first string were defending against it
admirably. So Ben went in and toss
ed the deep pass to Jim; Coffis had
Lawson perfectly covered, but the
latter showed his all-American
properties by simply grabbing it
anyway.
Ends that can jump up in the midst
of a couple of defensive backs and
still grab the ball are something. Re
member Monk?
Then Grayson was running
through the boys a couple of times
in tackling practice yesterday. His
ankle seems to be fully recovered.
Payoff, though, was Rouble and
Muller in scrimmage with the frosh.
They would gang up on Larry and
he would grunt like a tiger to make
his tackles. Pretty soon he began to
bleed over one eye and caught more
disparaging remarks from the on
lookers.
Muller was funnier—kidding Rou
ble all the time while he would
calmly walk in the way of the plays
that came his way.
A beefy guy was out talking to
Liebendorfer at the first secret drill,
someone nobody seemed to know.
Dink Templeton said "Scotchy
Campbell" and a lot of things came
to mind—the 1923 season, Andy
Kerr, present Colgate coach, in
charge at Stanford, preaching the
gospel of the double wingback, in
preparation for Warner's arrival the
next year.
Scotchy Campbell was captain and
quarterback in '23; they won some
and lost some, including to Cal and
U.S.C. Wonder what Campbell
thought of this year's team compared
with his, and of the other changes
that have come over this joint since
he was here.

Intramural football is on again, i
bigger than ever before, by 150 per j
cent in number of teams. This is not ,
meant as a flaunt to the number of
powers around that want the sport i
abandoned as too dangerous; the ar- j
gument of injuries per man-hour of
playing when compared with other !
college sports always comes first.
There have been a lot of sugges
tions that we have volleyball as an
intramural sport this year, perhaps
play it at night during spring quar
ter, on the basketball floor in En
cina Gym. And others have clam- !
bered to have the intramural cross
country run, discontinued three
years ago, re-established. Anybody
in favor of these?
The Stanford Illustrated Review. I
alumni magazine, is still putting out j
its little football weekly, started last 1
year. Harlow Rothert writes most of
them (Dink Templeton did the Ore- j
gon game.)
It is a four-page affair, with a I

deeper analysis of each game than
that given in the Sunday papers,
but still not like these "What's
Wrong—" to which the Chronicle
has given birth this year. With pic
tures, statistics, and a little dope on
the Frosh each week, the sheet is
neat, concise, and complete. I'd like
to pass on to Harlow some of the
compliments I've heard about it.
If any of you are hard up for
some excitement, take a ride across
the bay tomorrow. Anything can
happen in those all-California jousts,
and often does. —Klauber
