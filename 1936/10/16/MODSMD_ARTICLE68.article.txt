# Card, U.C.L.A. Water Poloists Clash Today
## Thornton Names Hoover To Replace Vibert As Sprint In Encina Tilt 
### GENE GEAR 
After a week of hard scrimmaging
to determine who gets first crack at
the invading Bruin water poloists at
4:15 this afternoon in Encina Pool,
Coach Nort Thornton late yesterday
named the seven amphibians who
will open the festivities against the
defending conference champs.
In the Indian net will be Captain
Bob Haslacher. The only small man
on the team, Bob Hoover, will start
in the sprint position in place of the
injured Jack Vibert, who may see a
little action before the finish. At
left lorward will be big Bill Hanna,
and his swimming mate at right for
ward will be John Lamb. These two
aquarians will be hammering at the
Bruin net all afternoon in their dual
rule as the Cardinal scoring threat.
Chuck Giffin, Stanford's most
versatile player, will start at center
back, with Don Peterson at left
guard and Ben Voss at right guard.
The Indian water dogs will be se
verely handicapped by the loss of
Vibert, who is hailed as one of the
fastest center forwards on the coast.
Thornton had been counting on Vi
bert for the valuable advantage
gained in winning the sprint.
Although Hoover is starting at the
sprint position, the Card forwards
will probably take turns sprinting
for the ball.
The Uclans, undefeated champs of

the Pacific Coast Conference last
season, will enter the fray with no
more than an even chance. Five of
the seven first-string paddlers from
the championship outfit are gone this
year, and Thornton will have a well
balanced, veteran team, despite the
injuries which have plagued the
Card coach of late.
The team's silence on today's bat
tle depicts an attitude of revenge for
those two defeats of last year, but
the game can't be rated as anything
but a toss-up.
Roy Winkleman, springboard
artist do luxe, will give a diving ex
hibition from the 10-foot board at 4
o'clock.
