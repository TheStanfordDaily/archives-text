## 
### 
Cotcli Harry Maloney is in a mood
of extreme optimism. His enthusiasm
bears directly on his soccer team
which won its first game of the sea
son last Sat iM-day over San Mateo
and has been spiritedly booting the
leather in practice th week prepar
ing for tomorrow's game with San j
Mateo Junior College.
Wednesday night the varsity whip
ped through its scrimmage in amrz
ing style which caused Coach Harry
to proclaim it "the finest drill of the
season." The men were kicking ac
curately, blocking well, and the for
ward wall was combining with par- '
ticular finesse.
Last night the team went through
its final workout. Coach Maloney
plans to give the players a rest to
night although the squad will gather
in the fencing gallery for a chalk

talk. Twenty-one have been named
to make the jaunt over to San Ma
teo. The eleven probable starters are
headed by Captain Bob Hall at cen
ter half.
Helms will be at the goal, Hanna
and Richardson at right and left
backs respectively, while Noll will

take the riuht half post and Sloans
the left. lii the forward wall are Lowe
at center forward, Sciiaupp at out
side iij;ht. Dibble at inside right
Parker at outside left, and Knecht at
inside left.
