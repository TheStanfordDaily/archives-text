# Rushing

### 
It's easy enough to say that rushing is a farce,
a hoax, and irrelevant. But for some people
it's very serious. And those are just the people
likely to get sliced up in the great bologna
machine.
These people do not understand that for all
its hyper-organization, all its fancy back-slap
ping, the new week-end hours, maybe an illegal
rushing party or two, fraternities don't know
very much more about the men they get, than
the men know what kind of a house they draw.
One thing that can be said for fraternity
rushing, it is certainly not as silly as women's
rushing, where everything possible is done to
make rushing a game of blind man's buff.
Fraternities may be either good or bad ac
cording to the one the freshman chooses, but I
defy a freshman, no matter how canny he is, to
be able to choose accurately. The freshman,
to begin with, doesn't know exactly what he
should or could expect from fraternity life.
Oftentimes he either doesn't get a chance to
make a choice, or must make it before he has
had an opportunity to get to know the person
nel of a house very well (as if anybody could
in formal rushing).
In general, though, we find that fraternity
rushing tends to perpetuate types. This need
not be considered criticism, for after all, the
most that can be said for rushing is that it is
intended to fill a house with enough congenial
members to float the board bills.
For the man who is not a type, however, fra
ternities may have no summons. And it is very
frequently the student who doesn't get asked
by a house, who could stand a bit of that type
casting the most.
Fraternities make the big rush for the smooth
looking boy v/ho is athletic, comes from a fine
family, and dates the best-looking gals, but the
guy who minds his own business, who may be
considered a qreat man in 20 years, who prob
ably would be a good man to live with, but who
doesn't know as much about hound's tooth and
twill, will be overlooked unless he happened
to know in high school a stack of brothers in
one of the kennels up Lasuen.
At which point, I can hear a lot of the good
men v/ho will amount to something 20 years
from now say: "What of it? Who wants to go
a tong anyhow?"
To which I append: "What of it?"

These people do not understand that for all
its hyper-organization, all its fancy back-slap
ping, the new week-end hours, maybe an illegal
rushing party or two, fraternities don't know
very much more about the men they get, than
the men know what kind of a house they draw.
One thing that can be said for fraternity
rushing, it is certainly not as silly as women's
rushing, where everything possible is done to
make rushing a game of blind man's buff.
Fraternities may be either good or bad ac
cording to the one the freshman chooses, but I
defy a freshman, no matter how canny he is, to
be able to choose accurately. The freshman,
to begin with, doesn't know exactly what he
should or could expect from fraternity life.
Oftentimes he either doesn't get a chance to
make a choice, or must make it before he has
had an opportunity to get to know the person
nel of a house very well (as if anybody could
in formal rushing).
In general, though, we find that fraternity
rushing tends to perpetuate types. This need
not be considered criticism, for after all, the
most that can be said for rushing is that it is
intended to fill a house with enough congenial
members to float the board bills.
For the man who is not a type, however, fra
ternities may have no summons. And it is very
frequently the student who doesn't get asked
by a house, who could stand a bit of that type
casting the most.
Fraternities make the big rush for the smooth
looking boy v/ho is athletic, comes from a fine
family, and dates the best-looking gals, but the
guy who minds his own business, who may be
considered a qreat man in 20 years, who prob
ably would be a good man to live with, but who
doesn't know as much about hound's tooth and
twill, will be overlooked unless he happened
to know in high school a stack of brothers in
one of the kennels up Lasuen.
At which point, I can hear a lot of the good
men v/ho will amount to something 20 years
from now say: "What of it? Who wants to go
a tong anyhow?"
To which I append: "What of it?"
It's easy enough to say that rushing is a farce,
a hoax, and irrelevant. But for some people
it's very serious. And those are just the people
likely to get sliced up in the great bologna
machine.
