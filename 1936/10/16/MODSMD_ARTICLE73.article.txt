# The 						Mud Fight Is Here To Stay Again and Yet
## 
### 
The Mud Fight lives on! Ta-ta-ta-dadadada—
TAAA—tec-ta.
The voters have decreed it. The Mud Fight
will continue this year, better policed perhaps
for all the agitation, but it will continue as noth
ing more nor less than the Mud Fight.
Some juniors claim that their class actually
won the Mud Fight v/hen they were sopho
mores, but due to the fact that neither side re
tired its men once they were dunked, and the
sponsors were partial, that their class was
robbed of the decision. If better policing and
sponsoring prevail, these little injustices will
be remedied.
But despite minor variations, the essential
Mud Fight tradition will continue, as long as
sophomores and freshmen consider it neces
sary to v/elcome and orient freshmen to this
school in a muscular manner.
