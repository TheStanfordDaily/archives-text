# At the Pearly Gates

### 
The City of Palo Alto has added to its assets
one underpass â€” estimated cost $200,000, but
Stanford students bound for Paly still have to
wait for one, sometimes two trains to stop, un
load their freight of commuters, and slowly pass
on their way.
Around eight in the morning and six at night,
the greatest campus traffic waits the greatest
time for the greatest number of trains. Now it
wouldn't be so bad if the surly gateman at the
crossing would pump the gates up while the
trains are steaming at the station, and the engi
neer climbs off to get his all-essential package
of cigarettes. But instead, he chooses to sit in
his protective tower and leer at the fuming
students.
When it was found that the City of Palo Alto
only had to scrape its city treasury of about
51000 for its contribution to the Embarcadero
underpass, optimistic people began surmising
that perhaps someone would also build a sub
way for University Avenue.
But this is about as far as the University sub
way will ever get because city engineers figure
that it would cost nearly half a million dollars
before the project could be finished. For not

only is there the initial cost of the underpass but
there are also the landowners on University
Avenue who want their pockets well-lined be
fore they will sell their holdings to the city for
a right-of-way.
But someone looked further than a simple
underpass under the tracks in their present
location, but proposed at the cost of a million
dollars to move the tracks, starting from the
Palo Alto bridge, out toward the highway and
then build an underpass that would go under
the highway, under the tracks, and allow the
formerly signal-and-train-repressed student to
sweep into town in a grandiose manner. But
this dream ends here for Palo Alto has not a
million dollars to spend on a project that might
possibly get the attention of Ripley, nor does
even our fast-spending government think that
such a plan is wise.
Now all this leaves the moaning students
with a fine subway at Embarcadero which they
will seldom use. It leaves Graduate Manager
A1 Masters with a new worry on his now too
long list, for people who take the football spe
cials at the stadium station will now have to
match wits with the after-game driver who
views the new underpass only as a means of
speedy retreat to a San Francisco rendezvous.
And it still leaves the students champing at the
Espee gates.
