LOOK, ROLLO, REPUBLICANS!
After diligent search in the Zete attic and Hoover's
basement, the Daily finally exhumed a couple of ar
ticulate Republicans. One of them writes in yester
day's Daily, the other will write in Monday's Tabby.
But two birds in two weeks hunting is a helluva
catch, particularly since Bull Sessioner baited the local
goppers with all the rabble-rousing devices he knew
of, to say nothing of making an ass of himself.

And even those who bothered to answer were
faint-hearted —which never wins fair election. They
indicated content with the belief that Stanford would
go old-line, substantiated with copious prcccdence if
not copious common-sense.
They apparently didn't think it necessary to in
decently expose their conviction that the Republicans
were right. Instead, they merely damned Bull Ses
sioner for what he believed, and complained plaintively
against his privilege of free expression.

Their attitude is genetically Republican. It subtly
indicates their satisfaction with the apparent status quo,
their Sunday morning chapel viewpoint, and the mental
constipation that intoxicates every intellectual impulse
held precious by economically-free youth.
For now, and probably never again, can we be Urue
to cleanly idealistic ideals. In college we may be
parasites, grinding papa's nose down to the sinuses, but
we can afTord to think honestly. Honest thinking these
four sweet years will not cost us our bread and butter.

And that is why I am a Democrat. Not, mind you,
because the Democrats are entirely right, but because
they represent an efTort in what I consider the right
direction; and because the Republicans represent no
effort whatever.
Now it is not economically smart for me to be a
Democrat. Nor is it economically smart for me to be
a member of the Newspaper Guild.
But right now, as long as mama pays the bills, I
can afTord to indulge these liberal tendencies of mine,
and be true to my best thoughts. For when and if I
get out. of Stanford, the exigencies of the world (I
privately call them blind-spots) may force me to
drop Democracy and the Guild. This is my last chance.

Student Republicans apparently don't share this
viewpoint.. They merely want me to shut up so they
won't have to say anything and we can vote on No
vember 3 in blessed silence.
Now. damn it, I won't shut up. Talking is one of
those indulgences-of-my-best-thoughts that I will not
give up until regular meals depend on it.
And if the Republicans won't talk, they'll simply
have to resign themselves to drivel exclusively about
the marvelous Democrats. I am serving notice.
