HOW TO GET INTO A FRATERNITY HOUSE,
AND WIIY NOT
A fraternity house is like most other houses, except
! that in most houses they leave the garbage cans oul-
I side the house.
A.s a matter of fact, there is really very little dif
l ference between the inside of a fraternity house and
the outside of a fraternity house. Women's Council is
apt to dispute this, but Women's Council doesn't know,
or shouldn't.
The inside of a fraternity house, particularly in the
j winter time, is, on the whole, more comfortable than
I the outside. This is proven by the fact that ants,
I roaches, and other carnivores find it cosier and warmer
| by the fraternity hearth.
Since today is the beginning of rushing again, I
! am oppressed by the simple fact thai there naturally
will be many people who want to get inside of fra
ternity houses.
Now it really is not nearly the complicated process
| you might think it is. In the first place, you put on a
j tie and throw on a coat, and spit out your gum. Then
i you hang around the front of Encina until you see a
bunch of guys who look as if they are legacies and
know the difference between the Kappa Sig and the
Kappa house. These guys, of course, are rushing up
to be rushed. You advance to meet them, bow politely,
and ask to accompany them. They probably will say
"Sure."
If you arrive at the fraternity house at the time that
| the little card says you are supposed to, you probably
will find the house manager waxing the floor or trying
to find a vase to put the posies in. If you arrive at a
fashionable hour, you probably will find the inside of
the fraternity house on the outside, which simplifies
matters.
Never pull the stunt that I did when I was a frosh.
j I arrived at the house on lime. I, too, was oppressed
| with the necessity for getting inside a fraternity house.
so I rang the doorbell. It was a fatal error. This let
j them know that I was there. A half hour later they
had forgotten, and the housebov let me in. I got to
I know the home boy pretty well, and the cook, and
! finally when the football players gave out, they gave
me a card which said [ could come any time I wanted
to jusi m) long us I didn't ring the bell. So I did.

will find the house manager waxing the floor or trying

HOW TO GET INTO A FRATERNITY HOUSE,
AND WIIY NOT
A fraternity house is like most other houses, except
! that in most houses they leave the garbage cans oul-
I side the house.

"Sure."
