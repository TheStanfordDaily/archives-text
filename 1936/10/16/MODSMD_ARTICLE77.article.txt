; BI(; MONEY, by John Dos Passos.
John Dos Passos is not a man to
j mince words as is seen in this, his
i latest book. The "roaring twenties"
; was not a pretty decade, and Dos
j Passos does not attempt to make it
! appear so. Post-war restlessness and
; dollar-hysteria are given full due.
i Almost, it would seem, they are
! made overly important. Dos Passos
i ignores the most pleasant details of
' American life, and lays his stress on
| turbulent materialism of the period.
In form, "Big Money" is curiously
I wrought. Perhaps fundamentally, it
| is a novel, but it contains far more
than pure fiction. There is plot, yes
j —there arc three plots, each dealing
with a separate personality. But plot
1 unfoldment is not Dos Passos' only
means of presenting the picture of
the last decade. He makes striking
1 use of the daily newspaper in the
| 'Newsreels," sections devoted en
j tirely to the shriek of headlines and
j feature stories. Prominent figures of
I too "twenties" are spotlighted, and
[ it is in these biographical sketches
I that Dos Passos shows his finest
workmanship.
He writes of Isadora Duncan,
j Thorstein Veblen, William Randolph
i Iloarst, and in the scant eight or ten
paged devoted to each packs a wealth
! of authentic detail. In the purely
| impressionistic "Camera Eyes," Dos

lassos writes in still another style.
Words are shot together, amenities
oi punctuation forgotten, and yet the
purpose of "Camera Eyes" stands
clear. Here is an effort to put into
words thought processes, familiar
emotions.
"Big Money" is a presentation of
a cross-section of life, and, as such,
promises to have x lasting value, for it
depicts in high relief the aims and
movements of a restless, short-lived
era.
Sex is a governing factor in any
man's life, but Don Passos seems in
tent upon proving it the only one
worthy of lengthy consideration. And
here "Big Money" suffers, for so
stressed is the sensual side of each
of die three main characters that
they lail to be realistic portrayals
Charley Anderson, f<sr example,
bears the authentic mark of the
dollar-sign on his forehead, but, at.
the same time, he is so over-sexed
that his pursuit after money seems
but a side issue. So it is with the
other two central figuies, Margo
Dowling and Mary French.
"Big Money" mirrors the "roaring
twenties" with great accuracy in its
more impersonal "Newsreels," "Cam
ra Eyes," and biographical sketches.
In its plot sequences, however, rank
materialism far outweighs veracity.
