SO WHAT DEPARTMENT: (From
a CBS publicity release) A New
York fan ihis week upset Columbia's
young-lady-in-charge-of-broadcast
tickets by requesting passes to the
Bulova watch program, a production
of five words giving the exact time
. . . Jimmy Jeamail, man-in-the
audience of the "Come On. Let's
Sing" program, recently polled wom
en in the audience with the question,
"When were you first kissed, and did
you enjoy it?" Whereupon an eager
young lady popped out of her seat,
gave Jeamail a resounding kiss, and
topped it with, "How'd you like it?"
FABLE OF THE FARM: One
graduate of last year deserves to be
come a tradition already, and that is
Anne Ritchie. Many are the memo
ries of her clever, sophisticated lyr
ics for Chaparral and Gaieties, and
many are the tales that name her as
their central figure.
One of these concerns Miss Ritchie
and Women's Council. Now Anne
was a far more mature person than
most co-eds, and far more sophis
ticated, in a deeper and more pene
trating way than the flip veneer of
the ordinary co-ed.
At one period in her senior year,
Anne accumulated a great many
lockouts, so many that she was sum
moned before the august presence of
Women's Council to explain herself.
"Now Miss Ritchie," began one of
the inquisitors, "surely you could
manage to get back to Lagunita just
a little earlier. Take this one, for
just two minutes. You knew what
would happen if you were locked
out. Couldn't you have gotten in
two minutes sooner?"
"Certainly," replied Ritchie, as
only Ritchie could reply, "but oh,
those two minutes!"
