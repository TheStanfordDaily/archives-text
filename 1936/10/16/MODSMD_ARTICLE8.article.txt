# 'Election' Is Indian-Don Debate Topic
## Craven, Stotsky Named To Speak Wednesday Night In Little Theater 
### 
The University of San Francisco
debating team will face the Stanford
team here next Wednesday night.
Jack Craven, varsity debater for two
years, and Ralph Stotsky, of the
San Diego Militai'y Academy, will
uphold the affirmative of the ques
tion: "It is resolved that President
Roosevelt should be re - elected."
Jack Downs and Gerald Cahill will
represent the opposition.
Pro and Con
All the adherents and opponents
of Bob Eisenbaeh, the Bull-sessioner,
will have a chance to hear both sides
of the question in the Little Theater
October 21 at 8:15 p.m. If everyone
who is wearing a Landon or Roose
velt button or displaying a sticker
comes, the attendance v/ill break all
records.
The subject is known to be of
great interest to the whole campus.
In an election year, when the strug
gle is so close and so vital to every
one, Republicans and Democrats are
found arguing in every corner. Good
reasoning and mud-slinging are on
all sides of us.
Greeks
The original purpose of debating
in ancient Greece, where it origi
nated, was to decide political ques
tions of great import. Modern debat
ing, too, reaches its highest (and
lowest) ebb when it enters that
field.
From Aristotle and Cicero to*,
modern times, debating has played
an important part in domestic and
national relations. Next Wednesday
night, with a vital, interesting, en
tertaining question, will help you to
decide your political status on No
vember 3.
