# Clark Stars In Devil's Disciple
## Takes Last Bow Before Departing for East 
### 
Fred Clark is making his farewell
bow to local audiences at the Com
munity Playhouse tonight and to
morrow where he is appearing in the
title role in G. B. Shaw's "The Devil's
Disciple."
Phyllis Corson, Stanford's woman
Thespian, has the feminine lead.
Fred Clark portrays the chief
character, Richard Dudgeon, who is
called "the devil's disciple" by his
Presbyterian family and neighbors.
Having survived the misery of child
hood in a home made hateful by his
mother's mistaken Puritanism, he
grows up to flaunt his contempt for
their perverted Calvinism in the face
of the whole sanctimonious commu
nity. The action places Richard in a
position to prove by a disinterested
sacrifice of himself that he, after all,
is the real Puritan.
The Shaw drama connects a cru
cial event in the Revolutionary War
with domestic crises in two colonial
families, the action culminating
when the citizens of an 18th century
New Hampshire town gather in the
market place to see the man they
call "the devil's disciple" hanged by
the British as a rebel.
In this last scene over one hundred
players are on the stage to watch the
hanging. Among the mob, Amelia
Baincs and Jack Temple, other Stan
fordites, will be seen. The produc
tion is directed by' Ralph Emerson
Welles, and directed by Sidney Head,
a Stanford graduate.
