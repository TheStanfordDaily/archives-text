4 will not be allowed on ihe
4 Stanford campus. That was the
verdict of University officials 30
years ago, when the first dusty chug
ging autos appeared on the Farm. In
the peaceful 1910's, no roadsters
whizzed up Palm Drive; only bi
cycles and buggies were parked out
side Encina; and the automobile of
(he president, David Starr Jordan,
was a campus novelty.
It wasn't long before Ihe regulation
against cars was removed; Palm
Drive was opened up about 1915; and
students and professors began (o
sport new autos. Today 35 per cent
of the Stanford students own ears
and drive them daily about the
university.

Cars- 1425 of them—from a Model
T Ford to a 1936 Cord, may be seen
any day on various parts of the

cars are owned by men; 17 per cent
by women.
