# Rabies on the Campus
## 
### 
An Encina student is now undergoing the Pasteur treatment
as the result of a bite he received Tuesday from a stray cat. Sent
to the laboratories of the State Department of Health, the head of
the cat was diagnosed Friday as probably rabies.
Dr. T. A. Storey, director of the School of Hygiene, says that
although a number of rabid dogs were reported during the past
summer from several East Bay cities and from San Jose, and
while one case of rabies of dog has been reported from Palo
Alto during the pasi 12 years, there have been no records in the
vicinity of human rabies.
He warns: "This disease is transmitted by the bite of an in
fected animal. All students and all other campus residents are
urged to avoid handling stray cats or dogs. All campus families
are warned to keep their house pets —dogs and cats —at home.
"While the situation is in no sense to be regarded as a reason
for great anxiety, it should at least be respected as a reason for
exercising preventive measures."
