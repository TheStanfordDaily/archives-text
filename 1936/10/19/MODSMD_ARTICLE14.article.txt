For the year ending June 30, 1936,
a Treasury Department statement
places the amount of relief expendi
tures at $3,118,700,000. This is well
over twice as much money as was
spent for relief in 1934. In July,
1933, a little less than four million
persons and families were on relief.
In March, 1936, according to the
F.E.R.A. report of that month, there
were over five million individuals
and families on relief. Administrator
Hopkins himself admitted that in
January of this year at least 19 mil
lion persons were receiving govern
ment relief funds. Yet the American
Federation of Labor announced in
March, 1936, that over 12 million
persons were still unemployed.
We are forced to conclude, there
fore, that the New Deal has ad
vanced by leaps and bounds in its
policy of relief spending, but has

made little progress in returning
these individuals to permanent and
profitable occupations.
Wrought Financc Havoc
Not only has the New Deal
wrought financial havoc by its
spending policy, but it has injured
the morale of the American public
in general. It has always been a
characteristic of true Americans that
they work for what they get. It was
hard work that made this nation
what it is. We are justly proud that
we have paid higher wages than
other countries, and thus have main
tained a higher standard of living
among the working people.

upon which we can lay our hands is
the election in November of Gov
