# HANDY RUSHING CHART
## 
### 
this year has been
screaming about how wonderful
the frosh women are. Last fall
everyone was moaning about how
crummy they were. But at no time
did anyone indicate what they
thought about the new Encina men.
Which would seem to indicate
that nobody gives a damn about En
cina men. This, however, is not
true. The boys who are interested in
this year's Encina men are the
smooth individuals who make out
rushing cards once a week, and they
aren't the ones to go yelling about.
The undercurrent of feeling up the
Row this period was that this year's
class has something of an edge over
last year's.
The frosh footballers are supposed
to be even stronger than the frosh
team of the "Vowing Sophs." While
all down the line, strength is exhib
ited. In substantiation, and for con
venience of rushing chairmen, the
Daily sports staff has prepared this
handy list of early season freshman

Saddest this sight to me:
The graves of little magazines
That died to make verse free."
