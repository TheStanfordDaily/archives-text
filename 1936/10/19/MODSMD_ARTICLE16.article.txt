# FIRE TRUCK LANTERN
## 
### 
In answering a false alarm Friday
night sent in from the Physics Cor
ner, an electric lantern was lost from
the Seagrave truck near Lomita and
Santa Teresa Streets. "I would be
much obliged if the party that picked
it up would return it immediately to
the fire department," declared Fire
Chief Dugan. Dugan stated the false
alarm was caused by a short-circuit
in the now over-complex fire alarm
signal system on the campus.
