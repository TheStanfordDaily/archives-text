# Through Darkest Stanford with Rod and Gun
## 
### 
IY'HEN Dr. Wilbur and the Inter
fraternity Board finally compro
mised on this new waiting-game
style of rushing last spring, they
thought it would be a step in the di
rection of eliminating illegal rushing.
The longer hours were supposed to
give the houses a chance to get ac
quainted with the freshmen without
further intimacy of an illegal rushing
party.
The new 212-6 hour rushing sys
tem was started Friday.
And illegal rushing started Friday
n'ght.
Finis
And so ends another fine attempt
to clean up the fraternity vs. frosh
Big Game hunt.
As far as the Lasuen grapevine
could find out, only one house il
legally rushed, but so uneasy is the
rushing system that as soon as one
does it others are bound to follow.
That is why, a few hours after din
ner Friday night, two Phi Delts sud
denly appeared in Beta and Alpha
Delt living rooms, Dekes are reputed
to have stalked the Zetes, and the
Zetes stalked the Dekes. After all
the prowling, one fact of significance
emerged: one house was empty.
Logically, perhaps, there is no rea
son to rush illegally this early in the
year. Most fraternities do not have a
line on the boys yet, and there is no
point in throwing money to the
breeze and running risks on courtesy
rushees.
Conflict
But there is a Machiavellian rea
son to rush later on. when the class
is lining up. One reason is that it is
easier to entertain off-campus. An
other is that the party is more selec
tive. and it is also more informal,
more conducive to forming friend
ships and the passing out of pledge
buttons.
There are also valid reasons
against illegal rushing. It is expen
sive. It is apt to give a colored im
pression of a house. It is conducive
to shenanigans and trickery.
Between these two purposes there
is conflict, which the new rushing
system has not resolved.
Flop
The chief gripe about this new set
up appears to lie in the long hours.
Of course, the original idea was to
enable the hunter and the hunted to
get acquainted. But it didn't work
this week-end.
No gortd huntsman was ever seen
to stand out in the open. He'll stay
behind his blind. And it's recognized
that good game stay under cover,
too. So it's generally conceded that
this much-desired spirit of informal
ity is impossible.
Rushers and rushees have both
said: "It's a good evening wasted."
Fraternity men polled last night said,
"We can't keep the guys enter
tained." Frosh said: "We were bor
ed."
One house is said to be definitely
set on dinging the new system be
fore the Council meeting tomorrow
night, and it is certain that those
who favor the present plan will have
some arguing to do to prove that
further trial of the new set-up will
evolve new forms of entertainment,
or will automatically take care of it
self. when the number of rushees
dwindle or become more familiar
with the members of the house.
In the meantime, hunting season
closes until next Friday when once
again the big guns stalk game from
behind the elms (or whatever they
are) along the Row.
Encina Hall, a massive stone
building accommodating over 300
students, though related to the rest
of the Stanford buildings by some
characteristic details, had a differ
ent inception. In general elevation
it repeats on a large scale that of a
finely situated hotel at Silva Plana
in the Swiss Engadine, where the
Stanfords once spent a happy holi
day.—From "Concerning Stanford."
The truth has disappeared. I fancy.
And simple faith has left us, too.
Only the dogs still fawn around us.
And even they do not »eem true.

Delt living rooms, Dekes are reputed
to have stalked the Zetes, and the
Zetes stalked the Dekes. After all
the prowling, one fact of significance
emerged: one house was empty.

Conflict
But there is a Machiavellian rea
son to rush later on. when the class
is lining up. One reason is that it is
easier to entertain off-campus. An
other is that the party is more selec
tive. and it is also more informal,
more conducive to forming friend
ships and the passing out of pledge
buttons.
There are also valid reasons
against illegal rushing. It is expen
sive. It is apt to give a colored im
pression of a house. It is conducive
to shenanigans and trickery.
Between these two purposes there
is conflict, which the new rushing
system has not resolved.
Flop
The chief gripe about this new set

Of course, the original idea was to

No gortd huntsman was ever seen
to stand out in the open. He'll stay
behind his blind. And it's recognized
that good game stay under cover,

this much-desired spirit of informal
ity is impossible.
Rushers and rushees have both

One house is said to be definitely

night, and it is certain that those
who favor the present plan will have
some arguing to do to prove that
further trial of the new set-up will
evolve new forms of entertainment,
or will automatically take care of it
self. when the number of rushees
dwindle or become more familiar
with the members of the house.
In the meantime, hunting season
closes until next Friday when once
again the big guns stalk game from

Encina Hall, a massive stone
