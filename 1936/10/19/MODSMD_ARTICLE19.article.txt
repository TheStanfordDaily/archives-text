# Stanford Tankmen Beat Fighting Bruins 7-5
## Don Peterson Stars In Guard Post Friday 
### GENE GEAR 
Led by a fighting fool who can take
the ball away from any player on the
coast, and a sharpshooting forward
who looks like Luisetti with water
wings on, the Stanford varsity water
poloists laid aside the Bruins of
U.C.L.A. 7-5 in Encina Pool Friday
afternoon.
Don Peterson was the fighting fool
at his left guard position, taking the
ball away from the entire Bruin
team and dribbling down the pool
time and again. Even the great Dixon
Fiske, of Olympic Games fame,
wasn't exempt from the defensive
stabs of this two-headed terror.
Lamh High Pointer
John Lamb was the Luisetti of
water polo with his sensational ball
handling and sharpshooting activi
ties that earned him high-point
honors with five goals.
The Bruins, defending conference
champs, made a real issue of it from
start to finish. Coach Nort Thorn
ton's Indian water dogs, using to
great advantage their weight and
experience, eked out a 3-2 lead at
half time.
Hoover Takes Dash
But Fiske, fresh from Uncle Sam's
Olympic Games team, wasn't click
ing in that first half. Little Bob
Hoover, who started at sprint in
place of the injured Jack Vibert, was
taking the dash from the Bruin cen
ter forward.
In the second half Fiske clicked
and so did the Bruin team. Fiske,
getting the sprint now, fired in two
rapid goals, and the Uclans took the
lead 4-3. The injured Vibe rt was
sent in to attempt to turn the tide.
The husky Card dash star got the
sprint, and from then on Thornton's
men wore down the tiring Bruins for
a hard earned two-point victory.
Hanna Scores Twice
Bill Hanna played the entire game
at right forward, scoring the other
two Card goals. Ben Voss and Chuck
Giffen went the route in their guard
positions, Voss doing well to hold
Fiske to three goals. The injured
Jack Loupe played part of the game
for Peterson at left guard.
Captain Bob Haslacher looked
flashy in the Indian net, and showed
the large crowd why he was picked
for all conference honors last sea
son instead of Walt Wood of U.C.
L.A., who stopped plenty of Lamb's
and Hanna's sizzling shots.
Canada recently created a "Youth
Employment Committee," corre
sponding largely in purpose to the
National Youth Administration in
the United States. The group plans
to improve existing facilities for vo
cational guidance, training, and
placement.

getting the sprint now, fired in two
rapid goals, and the Uclans took the
lead 4-3. The injured Vibe rt was
sent in to attempt to turn the tide.
The husky Card dash star got the
sprint, and from then on Thornton's
men wore down the tiring Bruins for
a hard earned two-point victory.
Hanna Scores Twice
Bill Hanna played the entire game
at right forward, scoring the other
two Card goals. Ben Voss and Chuck
Giffen went the route in their guard
positions, Voss doing well to hold
Fiske to three goals. The injured
Jack Loupe played part of the game
for Peterson at left guard.
Captain Bob Haslacher looked
flashy in the Indian net, and showed
the large crowd why he was picked
for all conference honors last sea
son instead of Walt Wood of U.C.
L.A., who stopped plenty of Lamb's
and Hanna's sizzling shots.
Canada recently created a "Youth
Employment Committee," corre
sponding largely in purpose to the
National Youth Administration in
the United States. The group plans
to improve existing facilities for vo
cational guidance, training, and
placement.
Led by a fighting fool who can take
the ball away from any player on the
coast, and a sharpshooting forward
who looks like Luisetti with water
wings on, the Stanford varsity water
poloists laid aside the Bruins of
U.C.L.A. 7-5 in Encina Pool Friday
afternoon.
Don Peterson was the fighting fool
at his left guard position, taking the
ball away from the entire Bruin
team and dribbling down the pool
time and again. Even the great Dixon
Fiske, of Olympic Games fame,
wasn't exempt from the defensive
stabs of this two-headed terror.
Lamh High Pointer
John Lamb was the Luisetti of
water polo with his sensational ball
handling and sharpshooting activi
ties that earned him high-point
honors with five goals.
The Bruins, defending conference
champs, made a real issue of it from
start to finish. Coach Nort Thorn
ton's Indian water dogs, using to
great advantage their weight and
experience, eked out a 3-2 lead at
half time.
Hoover Takes Dash
But Fiske, fresh from Uncle Sam's
Olympic Games team, wasn't click
ing in that first half. Little Bob
Hoover, who started at sprint in
place of the injured Jack Vibert, was
taking the dash from the Bruin cen
ter forward.
In the second half Fiske clicked
and so did the Bruin team. Fiske,
getting the sprint now, fired in two
rapid goals, and the Uclans took the
lead 4-3. The injured Vibe rt was
sent in to attempt to turn the tide.
