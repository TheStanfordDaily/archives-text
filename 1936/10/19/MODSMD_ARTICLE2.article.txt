### WILLIAM B. MUNRO, JR 
4 TTACKING the expenditures of
the New Deal has become a
lational pastime. The President,
himself, has accused us of, "throw
ing our crutches at the doctor."
However, I think that we, the pa
rents. are entitled to do so, for the
ioctor's bill is far too high.
As President Roosevelt has often
;aid, "Let's look at the record."
In the last fiscal year of Presi
dent Hoover's Administration the
•'ederal government spent $5,153,G44,-
595. From the Daily Treasury State
nent of June 30th, 193G, we see that
•>8,879,798,000 were spent to run the
United States government, for that
/ear. The cost of operating the gov
ernment has increased by 72 per
oent. By looking at the record there
:s little evidence to convince us that
his carnival of spending will de
crease.
Relief Is Too High
?or what purposes has the addi
ional money been put to use?
