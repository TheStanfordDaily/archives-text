# Indian Poloists Battle Olympic Club Tonight
## 
### 
The Indian water poloists,
fresh from their 7-5 scalping of
the U.C.L.A. Bruin, will line up
in Encina Pool tonight at 8:45
to tackle the rough and tumble
aquatic artists from San Fran
cisco's Olympic Club.
At 8 o'clock, the junior varsi
ties clash in a preliminary that
may eventually decide the
championship of the B division
of the Northern California
Water Polo League.
The rugged Olympic Club
varsity hall tossers whipped the
San Jose State varsity 12-2 and
are coming down the Peninsula
with the intent of toppling over
the favored Cards.
