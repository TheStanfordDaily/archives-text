# Card Soccer Squad Plays to 1-1 Tie With San Mateo
## Inaccurate Goal Shots Bar Indians from Win; Lowe Is Only Scorer 
### 
The Stanford soccer team display
ed an attack last Saturday against
San Mateo Junior College that had
all the makings of victory, but when
the final gun sounded a mere 1-1
draw was the best token available.
Throughout the game an alert
Cardinal offensive kept the ball deep
in enemy territory. The forward wall
kept streaming shots at the San Ma
teo goal, but inaccuracy seemed to
be be the theme of the day. The one
Stanford tally was registered by
Harry Lowe, who produced a neat
angle shot to both start and finish
the Red team scoring.
The junior college ball club was
happy to make the final settlement
because, save for the tieing goal,
their attack was practically nil. An
off day for the Stanford lads was
quite apparent, but the individual
play of Captain Bob Hall, Dave
Sloane, Harry Lowe, and Carl
Schaupp was up to the usual high
standard.
One of the deepest holes in the
world was drilled in 192G in Orange
County, Calif. It was sunk 8201 feet.
