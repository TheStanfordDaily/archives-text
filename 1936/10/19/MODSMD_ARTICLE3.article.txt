### BILL MILLIS 
VOTE for Norman Thomas and
George W. Nelson, the Socialist
national candidates, is the only
practical vote in 1936. A Socialist
*/ote is the only vote that will count,
[t is a vote against war and against
fascism. It is a vote against the
system that breeds war and fascism.
It is fi vote against the decaying pri
vate profit system, against the sys
tem of capitalism that forces poverty,
,'xploitation ,and insecurity upon the
overwhelming majority of Ameri
cans.
A Socialist vote is a vote for So -
cialism, a vote for the freedom,
plenty, and security which is pos
sible only in a Co-operative Com
monwealth. Socialism is itself the
most thoroughly practcial answer to
the problems before the world today.
No Reformed Capitalism
It is no longer possible to talk
ibout reforming and liberalizing
capitalism. What we must do is
eliminate the system of private own
ership which acts as a throttle upon
production. In its place we must
erect an American built upon the so
cial ownership and democratic con
trol of the basic industrial system,
[n such a society, planned produc
'ion for use will mean employment
jnd security for all.
As this election campaign pro
gresses, it is becoming increasingly
dearer that there are no fundamen
al differences between Roosevelt and
Landon. They both are repeatedly
saying that their whole aim is to
bolster up and preserve the capital
ist system. The liberals who are
saying that there is a real difference
between the two main candidates of
capitalism are merely repeating the
•ourse which they have followed in
previous elections, just as in 1916
hey were enthusiastic for Wilson
lefcause "he kept us out of the war."
Democracy versus Fascism
The Communists, with their talk
ibout "Democracy versus Fascism"
tnd "Defeat the Republicans at all
:osts," are simply following, or per
laps leading, the confused liberals.
Vhat they forget is that Roosevelt
ind the Democratic party, and Lan
lon and the Republican party, are
dimply the representatives of Amer
can capitalism. In office, neither of
hem would be any bar to the drive
igainst labor and the drive towards
var and towards fascism.
!n America today our one real
iope is in building a strong Social
st movement. In Socialism we find
he one answer to the problems of
vorkers, farmers, professionals, and
/oung people. Socialism is the only
ilt»mative t<» imperialist war and
ascist tyranny. We can win Social
sn in our time. The way to speed
hat day is to vote in 193(5 for Nor
ian Thomas and George Nelson, for
i Socialist America!

i Socialist America!
VOTE for Norman Thomas and
George W. Nelson, the Socialist
national candidates, is the only
practical vote in 1936. A Socialist
*/ote is the only vote that will count,
[t is a vote against war and against
fascism. It is a vote against the
system that breeds war and fascism.
It is fi vote against the decaying pri
vate profit system, against the sys

No Reformed Capitalism
It is no longer possible to talk
ibout reforming and liberalizing
capitalism. What we must do is
eliminate the system of private own
ership which acts as a throttle upon
production. In its place we must
erect an American built upon the so
cial ownership and democratic con
trol of the basic industrial system,

'ion for use will mean employment
jnd security for all.
As this election campaign pro
gresses, it is becoming increasingly

saying that there is a real difference
between the two main candidates of
capitalism are merely repeating the
•ourse which they have followed in
previous elections, just as in 1916
hey were enthusiastic for Wilson
lefcause "he kept us out of the war."
Democracy versus Fascism
The Communists, with their talk
ibout "Democracy versus Fascism"
tnd "Defeat the Republicans at all
:osts," are simply following, or per
laps leading, the confused liberals.
Vhat they forget is that Roosevelt
ind the Democratic party, and Lan
lon and the Republican party, are
dimply the representatives of Amer
can capitalism. In office, neither of
hem would be any bar to the drive
igainst labor and the drive towards
var and towards fascism.
