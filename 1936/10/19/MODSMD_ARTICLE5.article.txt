# THE 						NEW THIRD PARTY
## or, WHO'S CRAZY NOW? 
### HUGH McDOWALL CLOKIE

A RECENT issue of the "March of
Time" devoted considerable at
tention to a political movement
which it designates as the "lunatic
fringe." Now I have no intention of
posing as a defender of the "lunatic
fringe," but it does seem to me both
indiscreet and short-sighted to dis
miss in this supercilious manner a ,
political movement which has the |
possibility of developing into a po
tent third party. Ridicule has never
killed any popular agitation, no
matter how ludicrous its purposes or
how preposterous its intentions.
The Old Lunacy
And anyhow, who are the luna
tics?—the ardent supporters of new
doctrines and policies which they
firmly believe will procure the kind
of America they want, or the arti
ficially enthused adherents of the old
parties, whose differences are chiefly
simulated for election purposes.
We have been told so often, by
those who should know, that the
national contest between Republi- J
cans and Democrats is a manufac
tured rivalry, created for the sole
purpose of electing the opposing
candidates to the Presidency. If one
puts aside the background of preju
dice and sentiment — including the'
favor with which fine party or the
other regards certain types of "busi
ness" it is clear that to win a ma
jority of voters both parties have to
resort to such straddling of issues as
destroys the possibility of a real
choice by the electors. And yet the
best people can be wrought up into

such a state of apprehension, of en
thusiasm. of admiration, and of hate
as merits their inclusion in the "lu
natic fringe." In other words each of
the major parties is just as much a
hodge-podge of conflicting interests,
incoherent theories, and jumbled
opinions as the nation's official "lu
natic fringe."
The New Lunacy
The chief feature then of the so
called "lifnatic fringe" is that their
lunacy is not adequately blended in
the old lunacies. The "new" lunacy
is really neither new nor more crazy
than the "old" lunacy: but it is more

rebellious and less capable of being
submerged in the old forms. Heresy
and apostasy are not sins in poli
tics; it is the non-professional proph
et, the "outsider," who is always an
athematized and excommunicated.
Hoovercrats, "silver" Republicans,
Jeffersonian Democrats, etc., are
respectable politicians, acceptable
and welcomed by either side; but the
upstart who tries to get into politics
without the aid of the orthodox par
ties—such as Epicers, Populists,
Non-partisan Leaguers—are beyond
the pale of decent political life.
The "new" lunatics are explempli
fied by Coughlin, Townsend, Gerald
K. Smith, and Lemke. Since Califor
nia is one of the nine states in which
Lemke will not appear on the ballot
it must not be thought that the
movement is non-existent here. For
in addition to being the home of the
Epic plan California is also highly
organized by the Townsenders.
Epicism, it may safely be said, is
quile unimportant, for in so far as it
is influential it stands behind Roose
velt, and in so far as it is a doctrine
it is socialistic and co-operative. And
Mr. Hearst to the contrary notwith
standing, socialism and communism
are so insignificant as to be negli
gible. After all these years of agita
tion it is probable that Lemke and
his "lunatics" will poll three or four
limes as many as the eminently re
spectable Thomas or the theoretical
Browder.
The Most Forgotten
The significance of the "lunatic
fringe" lies in its appeal to and or
ganization of the "forgotten men" of
America —i.e., their organization for
their own sake and in their own
(supposed interests, and not—as the
other parties attempt—for the bene
fit of the great party machines.
The "forgotten men," as we have
seen in Germany and Italy, are not
the underpaid labor unionists, the
temporarily unemployed, the mort
gaged farmers, or those who know
they are suffering from a depression
("prosperity round the corner"). But
the real forgotten classes are those
for whom prosperity will be—as they
knew in 1926—a delusion.
These are the unemployables, the
ever-bankrupt small retailer, the
hopeless tenant-farmer, the seasonal
worker, and the unprotected white
collar worker whose salary in pros
perity is relatively worse than his
pittance in depression. These men
arc glad to be strike-breakers, Ku
Kluxers, Black Legionnaires, etc.,
just as abroad they formed the body
of the Fascist and Nazi pa tries.
That the possibilities of organizing
them has only just begun to be
realized is evident from the kind of
views which will appeal to them (and
also to hundreds of thousands of
"lunatics" in the older parties).
They will join with the greatest
enthusiasm such organizations as the
Huey Long "Share the Wealth" clubs
(Smith's present racket), the Cough
lin League for Social Justice or the
Townsend Pension scheme. Like a
large proportion of the population
they are open to appeals against
aleins, against international co-op
eration, and to a campaign for a self
contained America; this was Lemke's
basis the mid-summer conferences.
But they are especially subject to a
violent form of the common Ameri
can prejudice against chain stores,
trusts, and monopoly in industry.
To these Coughlin has added a
definitely anti-Semitic tinge and a
long-continued denunciation of in
ternational bankers, Wall Street, and
the "money-changers." The impov
erished and disinherited have not
only been encouraged by the "radio
priest" to expect some alleviation of
their lot, but the chief "rabble
rouser," Gerald Smith, has made it
clear that a real redistribution of
wealth is in their program, not sim
ply by heavy taxation, but by more
or less direct action. Finally, of
course, the Townsend appeal it made
—like its more theoretical ante
cedent, the Douglas "credit" policy
of English origin, and Canadian
practice—to those submerged re
tailers who see a declining business
and think it could be cured by the
stimulation of more currency.
Future Uncertain
What the future bears for these
groups is uncertain. Certainly they
cannot get nothing immediately.
Will they disintegrate and creep into
the folds of the old parties when
these—as they will—offer them most
of the policies desired, or will they
continue and reach the growth their
class-type would indicate? Prophecy
is always dangerous. Progressive,
non-partisan, Epic movements ebb
and flow with few national effects.
But this is because these latter cases

have been sectional in nature. If the
three greatest regional movements
can find a common denominator
there is a good ground for theii po
litical continuance in the future. If
they do enter the older parties it will
not be out of love for them, but be
cause the primary laws make it nec
essary and possible to capture the
moribund organziations state by
state.
Signifcance
The significant thing is that certain
disgruntled classes throughout the
nation are now being welded into a
formidable power. The class that
thinks it is the backbone of the
country—the Nordics, the small mer
chant, the shop clerk, the pen-push
er, the dispossessed farmer, and all
those who have thought themselves
above the ranks of labor but find
themselves increasingly reduced to

dependence are being merged in u
great organization together with the?
labor sections which have no place
in a unionized America or who are
100 old, too incompetent, or too lazy
to work. Both Smith and Coughlin
have spoken of their intentions to
use bullets if the country comes to
the crisis (i.e., if they cannot win
elections). Don't forget that Mus
solini was once a tough' rabble
rousing journalist organizer, or that
Hitler was a comic-opera joke for
j-ears. When Townsend is dead,
Coughlin unfrocked, Lemke back in
the Republican party, and Smith a
Democratic appointee in Louisiana it
will still be possible for the "most
forgotten man" to rise to power with
Hearst papers, Ford money, and
Capone organization.
Man's only sin is that he has not
enjoyed himself enough.—Nietzche.
