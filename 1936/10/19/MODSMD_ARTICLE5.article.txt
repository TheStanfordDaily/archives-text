# THE
						NEW THIRD PARTY
## or, WHO'S CRAZY NOW?

A RECENT issue of the "March of
Time" devoted considerable at
tention to a political movement
which it designates as the "lunatic
fringe." Now I have no intention of
posing as a defender of the "lunatic
fringe," but it does seem to me both
indiscreet and short-sighted to dis
miss in this supercilious manner a ,
political movement which has the |
possibility of developing into a po
tent third party. Ridicule has never
killed any popular agitation, no
matter how ludicrous its purposes or
how preposterous its intentions.
The Old Lunacy
And anyhow, who are the luna
tics?—the ardent supporters of new
doctrines and policies which they
firmly believe will procure the kind
of America they want, or the arti
ficially enthused adherents of the old
parties, whose differences are chiefly
simulated for election purposes.
We have been told so often, by
those who should know, that the
national contest between Republi- J
cans and Democrats is a manufac
tured rivalry, created for the sole
purpose of electing the opposing
candidates to the Presidency. If one
puts aside the background of preju
dice and sentiment — including the'
favor with which fine party or the
other regards certain types of "busi
ness" it is clear that to win a ma
jority of voters both parties have to
resort to such straddling of issues as
destroys the possibility of a real
choice by the electors. And yet the
best people can be wrought up into

such a state of apprehension, of en
thusiasm. of admiration, and of hate
as merits their inclusion in the "lu
natic fringe." In other words each of
the major parties is just as much a
hodge-podge of conflicting interests,
incoherent theories, and jumbled
opinions as the nation's official "lu
natic fringe."
The New Lunacy
The chief feature then of the so
called "lifnatic fringe" is that their
lunacy is not adequately blended in
the old lunacies. The "new" lunacy
is really neither new nor more crazy
than the "old" lunacy: but it is more

rebellious and less capable of being
submerged in the old forms. Heresy
and apostasy are not sins in poli
tics; it is the non-professional proph
et, the "outsider," who is always an
athematized and excommunicated.
Hoovercrats, "silver" Republicans,
Jeffersonian Democrats, etc., are
respectable politicians, acceptable
and welcomed by either side; but the
upstart who tries to get into politics
without the aid of the orthodox par
ties—such as Epicers, Populists,
Non-partisan Leaguers—are beyond
the pale of decent political life.
The "new" lunatics are explempli
fied by Coughlin, Townsend, Gerald
K. Smith, and Lemke. Since Califor
nia is one of the nine states in which
Lemke will not appear on the ballot
it must not be thought that the
movement is non-existent here. For
in addition to being the home of the
Epic plan California is also highly
organized by the Townsenders.
Epicism, it may safely be said, is
quile unimportant, for in so far as it
is influential it stands behind Roose
velt, and in so far as it is a doctrine
it is socialistic and co-operative. And
Mr. Hearst to the contrary notwith
standing, socialism and communism
are so insignificant as to be negli
gible. After all these years of agita
tion it is probable that Lemke and
his "lunatics" will poll three or four
limes as many as the eminently re
spectable Thomas or the theoretical
Browder.
The Most Forgotten
The significance of the "lunatic
fringe" lies in its appeal to and or
ganization of the "forgotten men" of
