has brought recov
ery. This one reason should be
enough. But many Republicans have
apparently forgotten 1932. Bread
lines were lengthening, farmers were
being evicted, banks were failing and
Jeremiahs were predicting social
revolution. Remember?
At that point the man who four
years before had promised two cars
in every garage claimed that if
Roosevelt were elected grass would
grow in the streets of America.
Roosevelt was elected and today
steel and automobile production is
up 338 per cent, net farm income is
up 141 per cent, and during the last
12 months there were the fewest
number of bank failures in 51 years.
Republican Tactics
Today the Republicans are once
more reverting to their customary
technique of trying to scare the
senses out of the American voter
They say that Roosevelt is ruining
business at a time that corporate
stocks are at an all time high, except
ing 1929. There are few business
men who don't prefer 1936 under
Roosevelt to 1932 under Hoover.
Many false issues have been
raised. Some are so ridiculous that
they are funny. Have you heard the
one about Roosevelt being a Com
munist? The President has been
charged with undermining the Con
stitution, destroying American lib
erties and setting himself up as a
dictator. Ha! Ha! The Constitution
still seems strong enough to give the
K.O. to much New Deal legislation.
Landon, Hearst and Knox are still
exercising their Republican privi
lege of beclouding the real issues.
For a "dictator" I think Roosevelt
has been very gentle with the four
or five old Supreme Court justices
who have thrown out so much of his
program: I doubt if Hitler would
have been so reasonable. But we
have the word of Hearst that Roose
velt is a dictator (although not of
course an American one: we all
know he is really an alien in dis

guise.
Not to vote for Roosevelt is to give
half a vote for Landon. Behind Lan
don are Hearst, Rockefeller, Morgan
I and DuPont. Recently the last
named boasted publicly that he had
, so far contributed $383,000 toward
the Republican campaign.
Has Brought Balance
Roosevelt has brought balance into
the American system. His Repub
lican predecessors gave special privi
leges to business at the expense of
the farmer, to capital at the expense
of labor, and to Wall Street at the
•expense of the small investor. This
lack of balance precipitated the de
pression. A return of the Republicans
means the restoration of these privi
leges and in the future the event of
another economic Niagara.

Roosevelt to 1932 under Hoover.
Many false issues have been
raised. Some are so ridiculous that
they are funny. Have you heard the
one about Roosevelt being a Com
munist? The President has been
charged with undermining the Con
stitution, destroying American lib
erties and setting himself up as a
dictator. Ha! Ha! The Constitution
still seems strong enough to give the
K.O. to much New Deal legislation.
Landon, Hearst and Knox are still
exercising their Republican privi
lege of beclouding the real issues.
For a "dictator" I think Roosevelt
has been very gentle with the four
or five old Supreme Court justices
who have thrown out so much of his
program: I doubt if Hitler would
have been so reasonable. But we
have the word of Hearst that Roose
velt is a dictator (although not of
course an American one: we all
know he is really an alien in dis

guise.
Not to vote for Roosevelt is to give
half a vote for Landon. Behind Lan
don are Hearst, Rockefeller, Morgan
I and DuPont. Recently the last
named boasted publicly that he had

the Republican campaign.
Has Brought Balance
Roosevelt has brought balance into
the American system. His Repub
lican predecessors gave special privi
leges to business at the expense of
the farmer, to capital at the expense
of labor, and to Wall Street at the
•expense of the small investor. This
lack of balance precipitated the de
pression. A return of the Republicans
means the restoration of these privi
leges and in the future the event of
another economic Niagara.

enough. But many Republicans have
apparently forgotten 1932. Bread
lines were lengthening, farmers were
being evicted, banks were failing and
Jeremiahs were predicting social
revolution. Remember?
At that point the man who four
years before had promised two cars
in every garage claimed that if
Roosevelt were elected grass would
grow in the streets of America.
Roosevelt was elected and today
steel and automobile production is
up 338 per cent, net farm income is
up 141 per cent, and during the last
12 months there were the fewest
number of bank failures in 51 years.
Republican Tactics
Today the Republicans are once
more reverting to their customary
technique of trying to scare the
senses out of the American voter
They say that Roosevelt is ruining
business at a time that corporate
stocks are at an all time high, except
ing 1929. There are few business
men who don't prefer 1936 under
Roosevelt to 1932 under Hoover.
