### BISSELL MAGEE 
IN the column above read about
what Roosevelt threatens to do.
Or, better, don't bother. Five col
umns west, see the Hearts fairy tales.
Unfortunately, Brother Hearst, hav
ing foisted off the Kansas Governor
on those of us who don't know, has
spent his recent past in close com
pany with II Duce. So you can't find
out in column two what Hitler is
planning for next week.
Right next to this column consult
a rough description of the proposed
Thomas Utopia. Who can object, who
can improve, who can do it, and so
what?
A Different- Program
In this column, we Communists
1 ropose a little different program.
We suggest that a strong Farmer-
Labor Party is the best guarantee for
ihe right to get into columns like
tliest, and to insure better opportu
nities for more and better jobs after
college. So our program is introduc
tory to a Farmer-Labor Party for
next election. This will be in 1340.
This Farmer-Labor Party wtil elect
the President in 1940.
We Comm mists figure thai the
>;YA marks only Act I in a long
progressive program for tho;?'? ok us
who are not yet aged. We urge that
the next administration do stiilT like
forgetting the R.0.T.C., positively
guarantee a spot for schooling, and
then a job for all of us under and
over 21, and maybe abolish the prac
tice of kiddies working in the fac
tory.
We Communista advise a light
touch of soaking the rich. It is ru
mored that the gentlemen repre
sented on Wall Street could readily
handle a much tougher tax on big
incomes, and we propose to slap it to
'em. This dough can be nicely used
to handle the lot of those who
haven't much: unemployed, young
people, and even those of us who are
| employed.

Putting the finis on this fourth,
1 and only decent column, we Com
munists would like to remind every
body that the chiefs are getting us
closer to the trenches than is com
fortable. Since it is the heavy arm
ing boys, the hot shot European
dictators, the big bald boy and the
j miniscule moustache, who are really
pushing the next Big Battle, our
1 view is that the next administration
lake the opposite side. That means
! to take the side of the Soviet Union,
and to join the League of Nations,
and push peace. We don't want war.
If you're not doing anything else on
the third of next, we suggest that
1 you vote Communist.

IN the column above read about
what Roosevelt threatens to do.
Or, better, don't bother. Five col
umns west, see the Hearts fairy tales.
Unfortunately, Brother Hearst, hav
ing foisted off the Kansas Governor
on those of us who don't know, has
spent his recent past in close com
pany with II Duce. So you can't find
out in column two what Hitler is
planning for next week.
Right next to this column consult
a rough description of the proposed
Thomas Utopia. Who can object, who
can improve, who can do it, and so
what?
A Different- Program
In this column, we Communists
1 ropose a little different program.
We suggest that a strong Farmer-
Labor Party is the best guarantee for
ihe right to get into columns like
tliest, and to insure better opportu
nities for more and better jobs after
college. So our program is introduc
tory to a Farmer-Labor Party for
next election. This will be in 1340.
This Farmer-Labor Party wtil elect
the President in 1940.
We Comm mists figure thai the
>;YA marks only Act I in a long
progressive program for tho;?'? ok us
who are not yet aged. We urge that
the next administration do stiilT like
forgetting the R.0.T.C., positively
guarantee a spot for schooling, and
then a job for all of us under and
over 21, and maybe abolish the prac
tice of kiddies working in the fac
tory.
We Communista advise a light
touch of soaking the rich. It is ru
mored that the gentlemen repre
sented on Wall Street could readily
handle a much tougher tax on big
incomes, and we propose to slap it to
'em. This dough can be nicely used
to handle the lot of those who
haven't much: unemployed, young
people, and even those of us who are
| employed.

Putting the finis on this fourth,
1 and only decent column, we Com
munists would like to remind every
body that the chiefs are getting us
closer to the trenches than is com
fortable. Since it is the heavy arm
ing boys, the hot shot European
dictators, the big bald boy and the
j miniscule moustache, who are really
pushing the next Big Battle, our
1 view is that the next administration
lake the opposite side. That means
! to take the side of the Soviet Union,
and to join the League of Nations,
and push peace. We don't want war.
If you're not doing anything else on
the third of next, we suggest that
1 you vote Communist.
