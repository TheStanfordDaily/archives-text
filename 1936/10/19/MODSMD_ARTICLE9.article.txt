# The 						Stanford Rough Was a Sissy--—Maybe
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD DICK HODGSON 
hear a lot of yammering these
days about what a toughie the
college student of a few years ago
was, and how the advent of the new
women has changed everything, and
that the peacocks who now strut
their gabardines down the Quad are
the symbol of an effete and degener
ate race, but little of an authoritative
or accurate nature.
Talk with the administrative chief
tains down in the Ad building, and
they will say that the Stanford stu
dent has changed and that he's
changed for the better.
Trying to get a semi-accurate de
scription of how the Stanford stu
dent has changed, The Daily con
ducted a survey from the President's
Report, old files of The Daily, in
formal talks with professors and with
alumni who graduated from Stan
ford between 1894 and the present.
Under the Table
We were really "rough" 20 years
ago, we could drink the boys from
Cal under the table every time, we
made the freshmen know they were
freshmen in those days—but now,
the boys of '98, 07, and '21 grumble, I
we are a bunch of cocktail-sipping, j
belted-backed sissies.
Fifteen years ago — in 1921 — we
were "roughs," but what about it? In
those days Stanford was as "colle
giate"—in the College Humor man
ner—as it's ever been. We didn't
care much about learning anything.
We took as many pipe courses as we
could. We were the inflamed rah
rah children of the post-war jazz
age. It wasn't the thing to care
about the world outside. We were
youth having our fling.
Bridge
All during the- early twenties, we
played bridge. Auction bridge just
struck as a national craze. With
some of us it became a mania. All
afternoon, late into the night, we
played it. Each house had an unoffi
cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
poker, but for the majority of us it
was bridge.
Many of us. those who were really
"rough," didn't bother to "queen."
We found entertainment in "beering
up"' at Uncle Ben's, the favorite
speakeasy within walking distance.
Or we went to the "shifties," as we
called the motion pictures. Once or
twice a week we would jam into the
old trolley car that then squeaked
out to the campus, and ride it down
(own shouting and rocking the rick
ety car all the way.
Dancing Together
Things in the early twenties, be
fore automobiles became too numer
ous. weren't really much different,
socially, from the early days. We
might, however, have been a little
"rougher" than we were in the nine
ties. Then the boys in Encina would
amuse themselves after dinner each
night by — of all things — dancing
with each other. In the twenties we
either danced with women or not at
all.
Finances didn't bother many of us
in the twenties. Tuition was still
pretty low—s7s a quarter—and in
those flush times we lived off papa
because papa could very well afford
it. Mrs. Irene Coverley, who came
to head the Student Employment
Service since 1926, found three times
as much work as there were students
who wanted it. Some of us, of
course, needed extra funds, but most
of us played bridge or drank beer
or something.
And so we loafed through Stanford
in the twenties. Upon graduation our
fathers put us to work in their fac
tories. or as engineers, lawyers, and
doctors we -fi i t (he professional
world. In any event, most of us were
pretty cocky. The stormy days of
29 and the depression which fol
lowed had not yet shattered our
smugness.

But those of us who remained at
Stanford at the turn of the decade
were to learn that there was a se
rious side to a college education. It
struck us all too suddenly that in a
depression-ridden world you had to
be experienced to get jobs. Stanford j
registration took an abrupt turn
downward as papa's bankroll did
likewise. Before 1929 almost 1100
new students registered each year,
but in 1930 they totalled little more
than 900. By 1932 the low of 838
was reached.
Significant was the fact that, in
common with the nationwide trend, >
a great deal of increase in student j
body enrollment was in the School of j
Social Sciences, where there was a
precipitate .jump from 400 students
in 1921 to about 1100 in 1930. Stu
dents were coming to Stanford to get j
a "liberal education," in other words, j
most of them didn't know what they j
were coming for.
Even the influx of new women
couldn't pull registration up to its |
usual quota. But the end of the i
"500" had other effects.
Femininity
Those of us who dated found the ;
new women not nearly so sure of j
themselves as the old "500" had been. I
Though the word for them wasn't j
"terrific" until 1934 or later, they i
were, certainly, better examples of
femininity. The import trade from j
California and Mills dropped off, and
all-campus dating became more
common.
Willi the serious thirties, the rah- |
rah traditions of the years before I
were one by one forgotten. Fresh- j
men were no longer a separate en
tity. We who entered as first-year
men during the depression entered
simply as Stanford students. The i
upperclassmen, except for spasmodic i
rushing, forgot to haze us. We could j
even walk up the Law Steps now j
and then without much commotion.
Stanford was ceasing to be a col
lege. It had become a University. We I
came to study, and amusement,!
though still important, took second
place in our interests. God knows
our fathers were having a hard J
enough time keeping us here. Where i
72 per cent of the class entering in
1927 stayed through to graduate, but
54 per cent of the 1931 freshmen
could finish four years.
Relief, Not jobs
Mrs. Coverley no longer com
plained about lack of student work
ers. In 1932 she couldn't place half
of us who needed work. Today,
though, with business on the upturn,
she finds part-time work for almost
three-fourths of those needing it.
In 193G we are a more adult stu
dent body, certainly more urbane in
our tastes than ever before. More
than a third of us claim cars of our
own. We take, a more or less active
interest in world affairs. We read
"Time" from cover to cover. In 1927
the library's per capita circulation
was 42 books. Last year it was 90.
The effect of the depression was I
further borne out by grade-point ra- I
tios. From 1930 to 1934 the effect of
the depression apparently was to
increase the grade point ratio of the
men from 2.4(5 to 2.52.
After 1934, though, the effect of
the depression on limiting the num
ber of students applying for admis
sion and the consequent diminishing
of the selective process of competi
tive admission to the University
showed in the drop of the ratio to
2.44 last year. Following the admis
sion of the new women in 1933, their
ratio dropped from 2.76 to 2.64. And
from there it has gone down until
j last year it was at 2.57.
Time Marches
Time has marched on at Stanford.
! And the change in the student body
has been subtle, but it has been
complete. The effect of the World
i War, the impact of machine technol
j ogy, the growth of urban life, the
| great depression of the thirties, all
have had their effect and continue to
have their effects. Statistics have not
| been complete nor available enough
: to give a complete or qualitative
I analysis, but they have shown re-
I sultant trends.

a "liberal education," in other words, j
most of them didn't know what they j
were coming for.

usual quota. But the end of the i
"500" had other effects.
Femininity
Those of us who dated found the ;
new women not nearly so sure of j
themselves as the old "500" had been. I
Though the word for them wasn't j
"terrific" until 1934 or later, they i
were, certainly, better examples of
femininity. The import trade from j
California and Mills dropped off, and
all-campus dating became more

Willi the serious thirties, the rah- |
rah traditions of the years before I

men were no longer a separate en
tity. We who entered as first-year

upperclassmen, except for spasmodic i
rushing, forgot to haze us. We could j
even walk up the Law Steps now j

Stanford was ceasing to be a col
lege. It had become a University. We I

enough time keeping us here. Where i
72 per cent of the class entering in
1927 stayed through to graduate, but
54 per cent of the 1931 freshmen
could finish four years.
Relief, Not jobs
Mrs. Coverley no longer com
plained about lack of student work
ers. In 1932 she couldn't place half
of us who needed work. Today,
though, with business on the upturn,
she finds part-time work for almost
three-fourths of those needing it.
In 193G we are a more adult stu
dent body, certainly more urbane in
our tastes than ever before. More
than a third of us claim cars of our
own. We take, a more or less active
interest in world affairs. We read
"Time" from cover to cover. In 1927
the library's per capita circulation
was 42 books. Last year it was 90.
The effect of the depression was I
further borne out by grade-point ra- I
tios. From 1930 to 1934 the effect of
the depression apparently was to
increase the grade point ratio of the
men from 2.4(5 to 2.52.
After 1934, though, the effect of
the depression on limiting the num
ber of students applying for admis
sion and the consequent diminishing
of the selective process of competi
tive admission to the University
showed in the drop of the ratio to
2.44 last year. Following the admis
sion of the new women in 1933, their
ratio dropped from 2.76 to 2.64. And
from there it has gone down until
j last year it was at 2.57.

tains down in the Ad building, and
they will say that the Stanford stu
dent has changed and that he's
changed for the better.
Trying to get a semi-accurate de
scription of how the Stanford stu

ducted a survey from the President's
Report, old files of The Daily, in
formal talks with professors and with
alumni who graduated from Stan
ford between 1894 and the present.
Under the Table
We were really "rough" 20 years
ago, we could drink the boys from
Cal under the table every time, we
made the freshmen know they were
freshmen in those days—but now,
the boys of '98, 07, and '21 grumble, I
we are a bunch of cocktail-sipping, j
belted-backed sissies.
Fifteen years ago — in 1921 — we
were "roughs," but what about it? In
those days Stanford was as "colle
giate"—in the College Humor man
ner—as it's ever been. We didn't
care much about learning anything.
We took as many pipe courses as we
could. We were the inflamed rah
rah children of the post-war jazz
age. It wasn't the thing to care
about the world outside. We were
youth having our fling.
Bridge
All during the- early twenties, we
played bridge. Auction bridge just
struck as a national craze. With
some of us it became a mania. All
afternoon, late into the night, we
played it. Each house had an unoffi
cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
poker, but for the majority of us it
was bridge.
Many of us. those who were really
"rough," didn't bother to "queen."
We found entertainment in "beering
up"' at Uncle Ben's, the favorite
speakeasy within walking distance.
Or we went to the "shifties," as we
called the motion pictures. Once or
twice a week we would jam into the
old trolley car that then squeaked
out to the campus, and ride it down
(own shouting and rocking the rick
ety car all the way.
Dancing Together
Things in the early twenties, be
fore automobiles became too numer
ous. weren't really much different,
socially, from the early days. We
might, however, have been a little
"rougher" than we were in the nine
ties. Then the boys in Encina would
amuse themselves after dinner each
night by — of all things — dancing
with each other. In the twenties we
either danced with women or not at
all.
Finances didn't bother many of us
in the twenties. Tuition was still
pretty low—s7s a quarter—and in
those flush times we lived off papa
because papa could very well afford
it. Mrs. Irene Coverley, who came
to head the Student Employment
Service since 1926, found three times
as much work as there were students
who wanted it. Some of us, of
course, needed extra funds, but most
of us played bridge or drank beer
or something.
And so we loafed through Stanford
in the twenties. Upon graduation our
fathers put us to work in their fac
tories. or as engineers, lawyers, and
doctors we -fi i t (he professional
world. In any event, most of us were
pretty cocky. The stormy days of
29 and the depression which fol
lowed had not yet shattered our
smugness.

But those of us who remained at
Stanford at the turn of the decade
were to learn that there was a se
rious side to a college education. It
struck us all too suddenly that in a
depression-ridden world you had to
be experienced to get jobs. Stanford j
registration took an abrupt turn
downward as papa's bankroll did
likewise. Before 1929 almost 1100
new students registered each year,
but in 1930 they totalled little more
than 900. By 1932 the low of 838
was reached.
Significant was the fact that, in
common with the nationwide trend, >
a great deal of increase in student j
body enrollment was in the School of j
Social Sciences, where there was a
precipitate .jump from 400 students
in 1921 to about 1100 in 1930. Stu

Cal under the table every time, we
made the freshmen know they were
freshmen in those days—but now,
the boys of '98, 07, and '21 grumble, I
we are a bunch of cocktail-sipping, j
belted-backed sissies.
Fifteen years ago — in 1921 — we
were "roughs," but what about it? In
those days Stanford was as "colle
giate"—in the College Humor man
ner—as it's ever been. We didn't
care much about learning anything.
We took as many pipe courses as we
could. We were the inflamed rah
rah children of the post-war jazz
age. It wasn't the thing to care
about the world outside. We were
youth having our fling.
Bridge
All during the- early twenties, we
played bridge. Auction bridge just
struck as a national craze. With
some of us it became a mania. All
afternoon, late into the night, we
played it. Each house had an unoffi
cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
poker, but for the majority of us it
was bridge.
Many of us. those who were really
"rough," didn't bother to "queen."
We found entertainment in "beering
up"' at Uncle Ben's, the favorite
speakeasy within walking distance.
Or we went to the "shifties," as we
called the motion pictures. Once or
twice a week we would jam into the
old trolley car that then squeaked
out to the campus, and ride it down
(own shouting and rocking the rick
ety car all the way.
Dancing Together
Things in the early twenties, be
fore automobiles became too numer
ous. weren't really much different,
socially, from the early days. We
might, however, have been a little
"rougher" than we were in the nine
ties. Then the boys in Encina would
amuse themselves after dinner each
night by — of all things — dancing
with each other. In the twenties we
either danced with women or not at
all.
Finances didn't bother many of us
in the twenties. Tuition was still
pretty low—s7s a quarter—and in
those flush times we lived off papa
because papa could very well afford
it. Mrs. Irene Coverley, who came
to head the Student Employment
Service since 1926, found three times
as much work as there were students
who wanted it. Some of us, of
course, needed extra funds, but most
of us played bridge or drank beer
or something.
And so we loafed through Stanford
in the twenties. Upon graduation our
fathers put us to work in their fac
tories. or as engineers, lawyers, and
doctors we -fi i t (he professional
world. In any event, most of us were
pretty cocky. The stormy days of
29 and the depression which fol
lowed had not yet shattered our
smugness.

But those of us who remained at
Stanford at the turn of the decade
were to learn that there was a se
rious side to a college education. It
struck us all too suddenly that in a
depression-ridden world you had to
be experienced to get jobs. Stanford j
registration took an abrupt turn
downward as papa's bankroll did
likewise. Before 1929 almost 1100
new students registered each year,
but in 1930 they totalled little more
than 900. By 1932 the low of 838
was reached.
Significant was the fact that, in
common with the nationwide trend, >
a great deal of increase in student j
body enrollment was in the School of j
Social Sciences, where there was a
precipitate .jump from 400 students
in 1921 to about 1100 in 1930. Stu
dents were coming to Stanford to get j
a "liberal education," in other words, j
most of them didn't know what they j
were coming for.
Even the influx of new women
couldn't pull registration up to its |
usual quota. But the end of the i
"500" had other effects.
Femininity
Those of us who dated found the ;
new women not nearly so sure of j
themselves as the old "500" had been. I
Though the word for them wasn't j
"terrific" until 1934 or later, they i
were, certainly, better examples of
femininity. The import trade from j
California and Mills dropped off, and
all-campus dating became more
common.
Willi the serious thirties, the rah- |
rah traditions of the years before I
were one by one forgotten. Fresh- j
men were no longer a separate en
tity. We who entered as first-year
men during the depression entered
simply as Stanford students. The i
upperclassmen, except for spasmodic i
rushing, forgot to haze us. We could j
even walk up the Law Steps now j
and then without much commotion.
Stanford was ceasing to be a col
lege. It had become a University. We I
came to study, and amusement,!
though still important, took second
place in our interests. God knows
our fathers were having a hard J
enough time keeping us here. Where i
72 per cent of the class entering in
1927 stayed through to graduate, but
54 per cent of the 1931 freshmen
could finish four years.
Relief, Not jobs
Mrs. Coverley no longer com
plained about lack of student work
ers. In 1932 she couldn't place half
of us who needed work. Today,
though, with business on the upturn,
she finds part-time work for almost
three-fourths of those needing it.
In 193G we are a more adult stu
dent body, certainly more urbane in
our tastes than ever before. More
than a third of us claim cars of our
own. We take, a more or less active
interest in world affairs. We read
"Time" from cover to cover. In 1927
the library's per capita circulation
was 42 books. Last year it was 90.
The effect of the depression was I
further borne out by grade-point ra- I
tios. From 1930 to 1934 the effect of
the depression apparently was to
increase the grade point ratio of the
men from 2.4(5 to 2.52.
After 1934, though, the effect of
the depression on limiting the num
ber of students applying for admis
sion and the consequent diminishing
of the selective process of competi
tive admission to the University
showed in the drop of the ratio to
2.44 last year. Following the admis
sion of the new women in 1933, their
ratio dropped from 2.76 to 2.64. And
from there it has gone down until
j last year it was at 2.57.
Time Marches
Time has marched on at Stanford.
! And the change in the student body
has been subtle, but it has been
complete. The effect of the World
i War, the impact of machine technol
j ogy, the growth of urban life, the
| great depression of the thirties, all
have had their effect and continue to
have their effects. Statistics have not
| been complete nor available enough
: to give a complete or qualitative
I analysis, but they have shown re-
I sultant trends.

three-fourths of those needing it.
In 193G we are a more adult stu
dent body, certainly more urbane in
our tastes than ever before. More

"Time" from cover to cover. In 1927
the library's per capita circulation
was 42 books. Last year it was 90.
The effect of the depression was I
further borne out by grade-point ra- I

After 1934, though, the effect of
the depression on limiting the num
ber of students applying for admis
sion and the consequent diminishing
of the selective process of competi
tive admission to the University
showed in the drop of the ratio to
2.44 last year. Following the admis
sion of the new women in 1933, their

Under the Table
We were really "rough" 20 years
ago, we could drink the boys from
Cal under the table every time, we
made the freshmen know they were
freshmen in those days—but now,
the boys of '98, 07, and '21 grumble, I
we are a bunch of cocktail-sipping, j
belted-backed sissies.
Fifteen years ago — in 1921 — we
were "roughs," but what about it? In
those days Stanford was as "colle
giate"—in the College Humor man
ner—as it's ever been. We didn't
care much about learning anything.
We took as many pipe courses as we
could. We were the inflamed rah
rah children of the post-war jazz
age. It wasn't the thing to care
about the world outside. We were
youth having our fling.
Bridge
All during the- early twenties, we
played bridge. Auction bridge just
struck as a national craze. With
some of us it became a mania. All
afternoon, late into the night, we
played it. Each house had an unoffi
cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
poker, but for the majority of us it
was bridge.
Many of us. those who were really
"rough," didn't bother to "queen."
We found entertainment in "beering
up"' at Uncle Ben's, the favorite
speakeasy within walking distance.
Or we went to the "shifties," as we
called the motion pictures. Once or
twice a week we would jam into the
old trolley car that then squeaked
out to the campus, and ride it down
(own shouting and rocking the rick
ety car all the way.
Dancing Together
Things in the early twenties, be
fore automobiles became too numer
ous. weren't really much different,
socially, from the early days. We
might, however, have been a little
"rougher" than we were in the nine
ties. Then the boys in Encina would
amuse themselves after dinner each
night by — of all things — dancing
with each other. In the twenties we
either danced with women or not at
all.
Finances didn't bother many of us
in the twenties. Tuition was still
pretty low—s7s a quarter—and in
those flush times we lived off papa
because papa could very well afford
it. Mrs. Irene Coverley, who came
to head the Student Employment
Service since 1926, found three times
as much work as there were students
who wanted it. Some of us, of
course, needed extra funds, but most
of us played bridge or drank beer
or something.
And so we loafed through Stanford
in the twenties. Upon graduation our
fathers put us to work in their fac
tories. or as engineers, lawyers, and
doctors we -fi i t (he professional
world. In any event, most of us were
pretty cocky. The stormy days of
29 and the depression which fol
lowed had not yet shattered our
smugness.

But those of us who remained at
Stanford at the turn of the decade
were to learn that there was a se
rious side to a college education. It
struck us all too suddenly that in a
depression-ridden world you had to
be experienced to get jobs. Stanford j
registration took an abrupt turn
downward as papa's bankroll did
likewise. Before 1929 almost 1100
new students registered each year,
but in 1930 they totalled little more
than 900. By 1932 the low of 838
was reached.
Significant was the fact that, in
common with the nationwide trend, >
a great deal of increase in student j
body enrollment was in the School of j
Social Sciences, where there was a
precipitate .jump from 400 students
in 1921 to about 1100 in 1930. Stu
dents were coming to Stanford to get j
a "liberal education," in other words, j
most of them didn't know what they j
were coming for.
Even the influx of new women
couldn't pull registration up to its |
usual quota. But the end of the i
"500" had other effects.
Femininity
Those of us who dated found the ;
new women not nearly so sure of j
themselves as the old "500" had been. I
Though the word for them wasn't j
"terrific" until 1934 or later, they i
were, certainly, better examples of
femininity. The import trade from j
California and Mills dropped off, and
all-campus dating became more
common.
Willi the serious thirties, the rah- |
rah traditions of the years before I
were one by one forgotten. Fresh- j
men were no longer a separate en
tity. We who entered as first-year
men during the depression entered
simply as Stanford students. The i
upperclassmen, except for spasmodic i
rushing, forgot to haze us. We could j
even walk up the Law Steps now j
and then without much commotion.
Stanford was ceasing to be a col

cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
poker, but for the majority of us it
was bridge.
Many of us. those who were really
"rough," didn't bother to "queen."
We found entertainment in "beering
up"' at Uncle Ben's, the favorite
speakeasy within walking distance.
Or we went to the "shifties," as we
called the motion pictures. Once or
twice a week we would jam into the
old trolley car that then squeaked
out to the campus, and ride it down
(own shouting and rocking the rick
ety car all the way.
Dancing Together
Things in the early twenties, be
fore automobiles became too numer
ous. weren't really much different,
socially, from the early days. We
might, however, have been a little
"rougher" than we were in the nine
ties. Then the boys in Encina would
amuse themselves after dinner each
night by — of all things — dancing
with each other. In the twenties we
either danced with women or not at
all.
Finances didn't bother many of us
in the twenties. Tuition was still
pretty low—s7s a quarter—and in
those flush times we lived off papa
because papa could very well afford
it. Mrs. Irene Coverley, who came
to head the Student Employment
Service since 1926, found three times
as much work as there were students
who wanted it. Some of us, of
course, needed extra funds, but most
of us played bridge or drank beer
or something.
And so we loafed through Stanford
in the twenties. Upon graduation our
fathers put us to work in their fac
tories. or as engineers, lawyers, and
doctors we -fi i t (he professional
world. In any event, most of us were
pretty cocky. The stormy days of
29 and the depression which fol
lowed had not yet shattered our
smugness.

But those of us who remained at
Stanford at the turn of the decade
were to learn that there was a se
rious side to a college education. It
struck us all too suddenly that in a
depression-ridden world you had to
be experienced to get jobs. Stanford j
registration took an abrupt turn
downward as papa's bankroll did
likewise. Before 1929 almost 1100
new students registered each year,
but in 1930 they totalled little more
than 900. By 1932 the low of 838
was reached.
Significant was the fact that, in
common with the nationwide trend, >
a great deal of increase in student j
body enrollment was in the School of j
Social Sciences, where there was a
precipitate .jump from 400 students
in 1921 to about 1100 in 1930. Stu
dents were coming to Stanford to get j
a "liberal education," in other words, j
most of them didn't know what they j
were coming for.
Even the influx of new women
couldn't pull registration up to its |
usual quota. But the end of the i
"500" had other effects.
Femininity
Those of us who dated found the ;
new women not nearly so sure of j
themselves as the old "500" had been. I
Though the word for them wasn't j
"terrific" until 1934 or later, they i
were, certainly, better examples of
femininity. The import trade from j
California and Mills dropped off, and
all-campus dating became more
common.
Willi the serious thirties, the rah- |
rah traditions of the years before I
were one by one forgotten. Fresh- j
men were no longer a separate en
tity. We who entered as first-year
men during the depression entered
simply as Stanford students. The i
upperclassmen, except for spasmodic i
rushing, forgot to haze us. We could j
even walk up the Law Steps now j
and then without much commotion.
Stanford was ceasing to be a col
lege. It had become a University. We I
came to study, and amusement,!
though still important, took second
place in our interests. God knows
our fathers were having a hard J
enough time keeping us here. Where i
72 per cent of the class entering in
1927 stayed through to graduate, but
54 per cent of the 1931 freshmen
could finish four years.
Relief, Not jobs
Mrs. Coverley no longer com
plained about lack of student work
ers. In 1932 she couldn't place half
of us who needed work. Today,
though, with business on the upturn,
she finds part-time work for almost
three-fourths of those needing it.
In 193G we are a more adult stu
dent body, certainly more urbane in
our tastes than ever before. More
than a third of us claim cars of our
own. We take, a more or less active
interest in world affairs. We read
"Time" from cover to cover. In 1927
the library's per capita circulation
was 42 books. Last year it was 90.
The effect of the depression was I
further borne out by grade-point ra- I
tios. From 1930 to 1934 the effect of
the depression apparently was to
increase the grade point ratio of the
men from 2.4(5 to 2.52.
After 1934, though, the effect of
the depression on limiting the num
ber of students applying for admis
sion and the consequent diminishing
of the selective process of competi
tive admission to the University
showed in the drop of the ratio to
2.44 last year. Following the admis
sion of the new women in 1933, their
ratio dropped from 2.76 to 2.64. And
from there it has gone down until
j last year it was at 2.57.
Time Marches
Time has marched on at Stanford.
! And the change in the student body
has been subtle, but it has been
complete. The effect of the World
i War, the impact of machine technol
j ogy, the growth of urban life, the
| great depression of the thirties, all
have had their effect and continue to
have their effects. Statistics have not
| been complete nor available enough
: to give a complete or qualitative
I analysis, but they have shown re-
I sultant trends.


The dashboard and steering wheel of the streamlined Cord, which has made its first appearance on Ih

hear a lot of yammering these
days about what a toughie the
college student of a few years ago
was, and how the advent of the new
women has changed everything, and
that the peacocks who now strut
their gabardines down the Quad are
the symbol of an effete and degener
ate race, but little of an authoritative
or accurate nature.
Talk with the administrative chief
tains down in the Ad building, and
they will say that the Stanford stu
dent has changed and that he's
changed for the better.
Trying to get a semi-accurate de
scription of how the Stanford stu
dent has changed, The Daily con
ducted a survey from the President's
Report, old files of The Daily, in
formal talks with professors and with
alumni who graduated from Stan
ford between 1894 and the present.
Under the Table
We were really "rough" 20 years
ago, we could drink the boys from
Cal under the table every time, we
made the freshmen know they were
freshmen in those days—but now,
the boys of '98, 07, and '21 grumble, I
we are a bunch of cocktail-sipping, j
belted-backed sissies.
Fifteen years ago — in 1921 — we
were "roughs," but what about it? In
those days Stanford was as "colle
giate"—in the College Humor man
ner—as it's ever been. We didn't
care much about learning anything.
We took as many pipe courses as we
could. We were the inflamed rah
rah children of the post-war jazz
age. It wasn't the thing to care
about the world outside. We were
youth having our fling.
Bridge
All during the- early twenties, we
played bridge. Auction bridge just
struck as a national craze. With
some of us it became a mania. All
afternoon, late into the night, we
played it. Each house had an unoffi
cial "varsity" who played tourna
ment games which sometimes lasted
weeks. This was our form of gam
bling then. Some of the "youngsters"
in Encina shot craps or indulged in
