engineering society, finished in a
close second in scholarship to Phi
Beta Kappa for the past school year,
according to a comparison of indi
vidual student group standings ot the
general average of the University
released by Miss Olivia Byler,
scholarship secretary.
Comparisons of the various groups

units. The standings of the individ
ual groups are then rated according
to their relation to the University
taken as a base.

For the University as a whole, the
average ratio of grade points to reg
istered units showed a slight decline
over the previous year 1934-35, this
decline being shared in both the
men's and women's groups.
Women's standing continued to
lead over the men's. In the wom
en's group, sorority standings were
higher than those of nonsorority
groups, while in the men's groups
the nonfraternity men led over the
fraternities, with women's soi'ority
averages higher than either of the
men's groups.

three halls holding equal places two
years ago.

of the eating clubs rated above the
norm with El Tigre and El Toro tied
for first.
