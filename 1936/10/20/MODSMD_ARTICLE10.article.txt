# STANFORD DISHES OWN DIRT FOR AMPHITHEATER
## 
### JIM HURST 
Stanford may not produce all the
! dirt in the world, but she certainly
dishes out the best of it, and plenty
to supply her own needs. "Dirt" may
j be expended to include such related
commodities as sandstone, basalt,
j clay, and road gravel.
When Almon E. Roth wants a new
road built, he tells the boys to go out
and dig up the landscape behind the
military department. Just a few
inches under the black topsoil is a
I natural mixture of clay and gravel,
ideal for the sub-base of the Stan
ford-style roads.
This is the source of materials for
three roads being surfaced on the
i campus right now—the one past
Branner to Mayfield, a new one be
. hind the Memorial Theater, and best
[ (or worst) of all, the sylvan path
I from Lagunita to the golf course.
Fills in Howl
That few inches of black soil
which overlies the gravel is carted
1 over to the site of the new amphi
j theater to be used in building up the

bowl-shaped earth structure. And
the fine silt removed from the former
surfacing of Governor's Lane, at the
moment nearly piled up alongside,
will be put to work growing grass.
Even the source of stone for Quad
buildings is a home owned institu
tion. Stanford has a sandstone quar
ry all its own on the Portola Valley
road. Rock to be crushed and used
in concrete is taken from another
part of the domain, the basalt quar
ry back on the Page Mill road.
Materials Transported
Thus Stanford's road and Quad
buliders import practically none of
their basic raw materials. They
merely move around the natural
stuff from one place to another,
utilizing the by-products, filling all
their requirements.
Even the big hole they're digging
behind the military department
won't remain as an eyesore to pass
ing aviators. The boys will fill it up
with broken concrete, stumps, sec
ond-hand plaster, similar indispns
ables, and smooth it over.

Materials Transported
Thus Stanford's road and Quad
buliders import practically none of
their basic raw materials. They

utilizing the by-products, filling all

Even the big hole they're digging
behind the military department
won't remain as an eyesore to pass
ing aviators. The boys will fill it up
with broken concrete, stumps, sec
ond-hand plaster, similar indispns
ables, and smooth it over.
