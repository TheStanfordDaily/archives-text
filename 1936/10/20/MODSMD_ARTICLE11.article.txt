# Juniors Meet To Lay Plans
## Activities for Quarter To Be Decided 
### 
Fifty representatives of the junior
class will meet tomorrow night at
7:15 in Room 214 to plan a program
of class activities for the quarter.
Under a democratic policy inaugu
rated this year, every house on the
Row will have one representative
while the men's and women's dormi
tories will have from two to four
representatives each.
Included in the business to be
brought up before the group is the
question of whether or not the jun
iors will give their traditional jolly
up this year. Members of the class
are asked to submit to the represen
tatives any alternative suggestions
for a junior party.
Representatives from the various
living groups have been chosen by a
junior class committee, headed by
Tom Killefer, president. Killefer
asks that the appointed representa
tives appoint substitutes if they
cannot attend the meeting them
selves. "We want someone from
every house and dorm on the cam
pus," he stated yesterday.
