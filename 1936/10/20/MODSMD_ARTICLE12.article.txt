# Farm Speakers Hit 'Brain Trusters'
## 
### 
Stanford Republicans made their
second radio appearance last night.
In a program over KGO and a
west-coast hook-up. Professor
Charles Dobbel, Student Manager
Chuck Fontius, and George Wing
field discussed "The Place of the
Brain Trust in Government." Loss
than two weeks ago, John Bunn and
"Dinty" Moore appeared on a similar
broadcast.
A series of questions and answers
were used to illustrate the speakers'
contention that, though there is un
doubtedly a place for the right kind
of "brain trusters" in any progres
sive government, the New Deal
"brein-trusters" have been sadly
mistaken in a great number of their
judgments.
