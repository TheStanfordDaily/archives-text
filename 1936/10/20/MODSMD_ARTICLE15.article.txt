# ROW LEADERS DIFFER ON RUSHING MERITS
## 
### 
Instead of the usual Conference
party for freshmen women, Pan-
Hellenic gave a series of teas this
last week-end. The sorority women
seemed to disagree as to the success
of the affairs. Women who have ex
pressed opinions are:
Nancy Gray, Pan-Hellenic presi
dent, Kappa Alpha Theta: "I think
the teas held over the week-end fot
freshmen women were very success
ful. They were very fair to both the
freshmen and the sorority girls, ev
eryone on both sides had a chance to
meet and form opinions."
Frances Wheeler, Delta Gamma:
"I don't think we met as many girls
at the Pan-Hellenic teas as at the
Conference party in former years."
Kay Bain, Gamma Phi Beta: "I
think they were a much fairer way
for the new women to meet the Row
women. The strain was broken for
the freshmen in meeting Row
women. They were not ignored as at
the Conference parties."
Miriam Roth, Kappa Kappa Gam
ma: "I think the teas were a great
success. I think, from the standpoint
of the women on the Row, that it
was much better for the freshmen
though it was pfetly hard for us."
Whether it will be teas or the Con
ference party next year, is still un
decided.
