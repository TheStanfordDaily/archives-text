j The first period of men's rushing
j under the new system was held lasL
week-end. Prominent men who took
part expressed varied opinions on
the system's merits, when intei
viewed.
Allan Duncar, Alpha Delta Phi:
I "I believe that the campus enter
tainment facilities are totally inade
quate for the present rushing sys
| tern."
Mort D'Evelyn, Sigma Chi: "The
old system was revamped to discour
- age illegal rushing. Period one of the
new system ended with wild rumors
of illegal rushing. Unless those ru
mors are publicly cleared, we will
all be back to the general illegal
rushing of previous years."
"Doodles" Weavei - , Beta Theta Pi:
"I approve of it because in the past
Row men have not had sufficient
time to understand the character
istics of the frosh men and have had
to resort to illegal rushing prac
tices With the present rushing sys
tem, the fraternities have a suffi
ciently long period of close associa
tion with the frosh to discover their
good qualities or faults."
Bill Bendel, Chi Psi: "I think the
| rushing periods are monotonously
j long—both for frosh and Row men.
However, the extended length of
lime enables both parties to get well
acquainted."
In spite of the new system, it seems
the ghost of illegal rushing still hov
ers over the campus.

rushing of previous years."
"Doodles" Weavei - , Beta Theta Pi:
"I approve of it because in the past
Row men have not had sufficient
time to understand the character
istics of the frosh men and have had
to resort to illegal rushing prac
tices With the present rushing sys
tem, the fraternities have a suffi
ciently long period of close associa
tion with the frosh to discover their
good qualities or faults."
Bill Bendel, Chi Psi: "I think the
| rushing periods are monotonously
j long—both for frosh and Row men.
However, the extended length of
lime enables both parties to get well
acquainted."
In spite of the new system, it seems
the ghost of illegal rushing still hov
ers over the campus.

j The first period of men's rushing
j under the new system was held lasL
week-end. Prominent men who took
part expressed varied opinions on
the system's merits, when intei
viewed.
Allan Duncar, Alpha Delta Phi:
I "I believe that the campus enter
tainment facilities are totally inade
quate for the present rushing sys
| tern."
Mort D'Evelyn, Sigma Chi: "The
old system was revamped to discour
- age illegal rushing. Period one of the
new system ended with wild rumors
of illegal rushing. Unless those ru
mors are publicly cleared, we will
all be back to the general illegal
rushing of previous years."
