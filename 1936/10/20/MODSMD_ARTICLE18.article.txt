# Campus Date Spot Planned
## Ex Committee To Discuss Daily Suggestion 
### 
Establishment of "an informal,
democratic, and cheap place for dat
ing on the campus," as suggested by
The Daily last week, will be dis
cussed and referred to an investi
gating committee when Ex Commit
tee assembles for its third meeting
of the year tonight.
Such action resulted from students
complaining that they couldn't have
"a good time" without paying high
prices for dancing in San Francisco,
Jim Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president,
said yesterday.
Enlargement of the second floor of
the Lagunita boathouse has been
suggested as a possible remedy for
the "expensive dating" problem.
Ex Committee will also take up
the matter of chaperones at campus
dances. Dean Mary Yost last week
complained to the Committee that
faculty members have not been
treated "properly" when they served
as chaperones. A subcommittee,
which has conferred with the ad
ministration, will present a report
for Ex Committee action.
