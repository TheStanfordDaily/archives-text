# STATE DIRECTOR OF NYA TO SPEAK IN PALY TODAY
## 
### HUNTER HENDEE 
Stanford's some 560 NYA workers
must trek down to Paly's Commu
nity Center this afternoon if they
want to hear the student employ
ment movement discussed by their
state director, Miss Anne D. G.
Treadwell.
So decided Dr. Robert Ecklos
Swain, public exercises chairman,
after discussion yesterday with Ste
phen Enke, leader of the Farm's
Young Democrats.
Enke and followers, it seems, had
planned to sponsor a speech this
afternoon in the Little Theater by
Mrs. Treadwell on the "Goals and
Aims of NYA." which talk was to
follow the directoress' Palo Alto ad
dress.
Dr. Swain, however, thought it
would be nice if Stanford Demo
crats and NYA workers would listen
to Mrs. Treadwell in Palo Alto at
3:30 o'clock instead of on the campus
at 5.
Might Influence Votes
That Mrs. Treadwell's talk might
have bearing on votes cast by Stan
fordites in the coming election and
that the NYA is therefore a "politi
cal issue" in the opinion of Dr. Swain
is evidenced by the fact that he
suggested Mis. Treadwell come
i down to the Farm to discuss the aims

and goals of the movement in the
latter part of "November or De
cember."
Mr. Enke states: "Mrs. Treadwell
was not going to have given a politi
cal speech. She was to have spoken
on the aims and goals of the NY A.
. . . Now NYA was brought into be
ing by Congress and in all proba
bility it will continued under the
next administration. It is thus not
a campaign issue." (See Campus
Opinion, today.)
Enkc Concerned
However, the present moment
Mr. Enke, as head oi Stanford's
Young Democrats, is deeply con
cerned with this matter of getting
Farmers to vote the Roosevelt-way
come two weeks.
It is therefore strange that Mr.
Enke and followers should be so
deeply concerned with sponsoring a
non-political speech here this after
noon.
Now the question is, if Mrs. Tread
well were not sponsored by any po
litical organization, were she spon
sored by Mrs. Irene Coverley. stu
dent employment director, for in
stance. would the Public Exercises
Committee deem it good taste for her
to speek in the Little Theater this
afternoon?

Dr. Swain, however, thought it
would be nice if Stanford Demo
crats and NYA workers would listen
to Mrs. Treadwell in Palo Alto at
3:30 o'clock instead of on the campus
at 5.
Might Influence Votes
That Mrs. Treadwell's talk might
have bearing on votes cast by Stan
fordites in the coming election and
that the NYA is therefore a "politi
cal issue" in the opinion of Dr. Swain
is evidenced by the fact that he
suggested Mis. Treadwell come
i down to the Farm to discuss the aims

and goals of the movement in the
latter part of "November or De
cember."
Mr. Enke states: "Mrs. Treadwell
was not going to have given a politi
cal speech. She was to have spoken
on the aims and goals of the NY A.
. . . Now NYA was brought into be
ing by Congress and in all proba
bility it will continued under the
next administration. It is thus not
a campaign issue." (See Campus
Opinion, today.)
Enkc Concerned
However, the present moment
Mr. Enke, as head oi Stanford's
Young Democrats, is deeply con
cerned with this matter of getting
Farmers to vote the Roosevelt-way
come two weeks.
It is therefore strange that Mr.
Enke and followers should be so
deeply concerned with sponsoring a
non-political speech here this after
noon.
Now the question is, if Mrs. Tread
well were not sponsored by any po
litical organization, were she spon
sored by Mrs. Irene Coverley. stu
dent employment director, for in
stance. would the Public Exercises
Committee deem it good taste for her
to speek in the Little Theater this
afternoon?
Stanford's some 560 NYA workers
must trek down to Paly's Commu
nity Center this afternoon if they
want to hear the student employ
ment movement discussed by their
state director, Miss Anne D. G.
Treadwell.
So decided Dr. Robert Ecklos
Swain, public exercises chairman,
after discussion yesterday with Ste
phen Enke, leader of the Farm's
Young Democrats.
Enke and followers, it seems, had
planned to sponsor a speech this
afternoon in the Little Theater by
Mrs. Treadwell on the "Goals and
Aims of NYA." which talk was to
follow the directoress' Palo Alto ad
dress.
