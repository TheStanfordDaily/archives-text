### JOHN RICE 
With the S.C. game only four days
away, campus activity got under
way yesterday, as plans for the Rally,
Card stunts, and A.S.S.U.-sponsored
dance were formulated.
While students discussed injuries
received by Davy Davis, Trojan star,
in last Saturday's game with Wash
ington State; and fretted over the
unprecedented "closed" practices to
which Coach "Tiny" Thornhill has
resorted, Cardinal Mark Hopkins an
nounced that bids for the all-Uni
versity dance Saturday night are
now on sale in the A.S.S.U. offices
and in front of the Post Office.
Price is $1.00 per couple.
Rally Plans Incomplete
Plans lor the Pajamarino and
Rally Thursday night are not yet
completed, but will be announced in
The Daily Wednesday morning ac
cording to Jan North and Sandy
Lowngart, co-chairmen of the com
mittee in charge of the rally. Both
said: "Everything is going smoothly."
In order to facilitate the card
stunts there wiil be a complete ex
planation of the way in which the
stunts will be handled at the game
published in Friday morning's Daily.
According to Rally Committee
Chairman T. M. McDaniels this in
novation should do much to termi
nate the clumsiness which Cardinal
rooters have shown n the past.
Winnie Jean Smith and John Dern
are in charge of the card stunts.
Nagel to Play
Providing music for the dance—
which is being given in honor of the
Trojan rooters—will be Freddie Na
gel's twelve-piece orchestra, which
will feature Shirley Jones and Cab
Calloway, giant varsity tackle, as
vocalists.
Should the Indians lose, Calloway
claims that he will be too sad to
sing, but Calloway does not expect
to lose.

student body has been contacted
through the editor of the Daily Tro
jan, Lionel Van Decrlin, and through
student body President Norm John

undertaking and who promises his
full co-operation.

Women's Gym from 9 to 12 o'clock.

Dern on the committee in charge of
the rally are Phil Halla, Al Hyman,
