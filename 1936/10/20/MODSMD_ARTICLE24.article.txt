# SOUR GRIPES
## OUR FAMILY MAN

It lias been suggested by one of
my constant readers—the other two
diligent followers of this column be
ing me and my mom—that I come
to the support of the Kansas sun
flower.
For a good American this business
of defending Landon should be easy.
After all, the powers behind the Re
publican throne are putting forth
Landon as the one man who can save
this country from the dirty machina
tions of that arch - communist,
Franklin Roosevelt. If elected, Lan
don will undoubtedly make America
safe for Americans in the same way
that Frank Finley Merriam saved
California from the red menace of
Upton Sinclair.
» * *
Of course, Landon is a family man
and gets along with his wife. So
does F. Finley Merriam, but when it
comes to Roosevelt, it is reputed that
lie does not get along well with his
front teeth.
Thus it is surprising that the Re
publican National Committee doesn't
capitalize on Landon's domesticity
and adopt the tactics of the Wilkens'
Family Whiskey advertisements.
These are the advertisements, you
know, that tell about how Pa Wil
kens and all the little Wilkens have
been distilling whiskey ever since
(hey can remember and how the
Wilkens family makes family whis
key for family men.
The Republicans could swipe the
slogan from the Wilkens family and
write slogans which run something
like this: A man wants the best for
his family. Landon is a family man,
therefore every man should want
Landon. After all, the logic of such
reasoning would be no more cock
eyed than that of the latest Repub
lican slogan: Remember and
Vote Like Maine.

To make it even better ,they could
have pictures like the Wilkens fam
ily uses. Instead of Pa Wilkens
jerking a finger over his shoulder
at his son and saying, "That's Jed,
there," Landon could be pointing to
daughter Peggy and saying. "That's
Peggy there. Ain't she purty?"
If Peggy took an especially good
picture, she would be a definite con
tribution to Republican campaign
art and everybody would get to
looking for her first, like they do at
the Petty pictures in Esquire. And
everybody would get to thinking, a
man wants the best for his family,
and who knows, maybe Feggy Lan
don is a family girl.

like this: A man wants the best for
his family. Landon is a family man,
therefore every man should want
Landon. After all, the logic of such
reasoning would be no more cock
eyed than that of the latest Repub
lican slogan: Remember and
Vote Like Maine.

To make it even better ,they could
have pictures like the Wilkens fam
ily uses. Instead of Pa Wilkens
jerking a finger over his shoulder
at his son and saying, "That's Jed,
there," Landon could be pointing to
daughter Peggy and saying. "That's
Peggy there. Ain't she purty?"
If Peggy took an especially good
picture, she would be a definite con
tribution to Republican campaign
art and everybody would get to
looking for her first, like they do at
the Petty pictures in Esquire. And
everybody would get to thinking, a
man wants the best for his family,
and who knows, maybe Feggy Lan
don is a family girl.

It lias been suggested by one of
my constant readers—the other two
diligent followers of this column be
ing me and my mom—that I come
to the support of the Kansas sun
flower.
For a good American this business
of defending Landon should be easy.
After all, the powers behind the Re
publican throne are putting forth
Landon as the one man who can save
this country from the dirty machina
tions of that arch - communist,
Franklin Roosevelt. If elected, Lan
don will undoubtedly make America
safe for Americans in the same way
that Frank Finley Merriam saved
California from the red menace of
Upton Sinclair.

Of course, Landon is a family man
and gets along with his wife. So
does F. Finley Merriam, but when it
comes to Roosevelt, it is reputed that
lie does not get along well with his
front teeth.
Thus it is surprising that the Re
publican National Committee doesn't
capitalize on Landon's domesticity
and adopt the tactics of the Wilkens'
Family Whiskey advertisements.
These are the advertisements, you
know, that tell about how Pa Wil
kens and all the little Wilkens have
been distilling whiskey ever since
(hey can remember and how the
Wilkens family makes family whis
key for family men.
The Republicans could swipe the
slogan from the Wilkens family and
write slogans which run something
like this: A man wants the best for
his family. Landon is a family man,
therefore every man should want
Landon. After all, the logic of such
reasoning would be no more cock
eyed than that of the latest Repub
lican slogan: Remember and
