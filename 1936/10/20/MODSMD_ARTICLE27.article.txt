# CAMPUS OPINION
## JOLLY-UP REFORM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I don't think anybody questions
the desirability of having some
means of getting the girls and fel
lows acquainted with each other.
However, I think that even the most
staunch supporter of the date bu
reau idea will agree that it has many
drawbacks and that it is not nearly
so well suited to the Stanford cam
pus as it is to the very large schools
such as Cal.
I believe that, with changes, our
jolly-ups could make a blind-date
bureau entirely unnecessary, if some
system were to be applied so that a
frequent change of partners was ac
complished. While the jolly-ups are
intended to do just that, hardly 1
per cent of the dancers exchange
partners after an announcement has
been made.
Suppose that at the end of each
dance or group of dances, all of the
girls were required to form a circle
around the room with the fellows in
the center and then at the beginning
of the music, each fellow would pick
out a girl for that group only.
It would give the dances an in
formal party spirit, it would mix
the crowd up, and it would give
about twice the dancing room as the
fellows who got left out in that par
ticular dance could be required to
stand in a restricted area instead of
absorbing most of the standing room.

I hope that whoever has charge of
the next jolly-up will give this or
some similar scheme a trial.

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford's Young Democrats Club
had intended to sponsor a talk here
on the campus this afternoon, by
Mrs. Anne D. G. Treadwell, state
director of NYA. When we originally
planned this talk we did not antici
pate any opposition on the part of
the Public Exercises Committee.
However, this is an election year
and the Committee feels that as the
NYA is associated with President
Roosevelt the Public Exercises
Committee cannot, in fairness to
other groups on the campus, allow
Mrs. Treadwell to speak.
Mrs. Treadwell was not going to
have a political speech. She was to
have spoken on the aims and goals of
the NYA. As there are over 500 stu
dents here on the campus who are
working for NYA. I think the sub
ject can justly be said to be of in
terest fo the student body. However,
this is an election year and we must
all be very careful that Stanford is
not used as a sounding board.
Now NYA was brought into being
by Congress and in all probability it
will be continued under the next ad
ministration, whoever is elected. It is
thus not a campagin issue. NYA is a
government project. Unfortunately, a
discussion of the merits of NYA
would reflect some small measure of
credit, inevitably, to Roosevelt.
However, this is an election year and
we must all be very careful.
I can understand the difficulties of
the Public Exercises Committee. But
it seems to me, and a number of oth
ers, that this is being a little too
careful. Dr. Swain wishes to be fair
to all groups. This is very com
mendable. But this air-tight exclu
sion is a little too much and it does
seem a pity that here at Stanford we
have to reside in a vacuum while
outside Ihe gusty winds of freedom
blow.
