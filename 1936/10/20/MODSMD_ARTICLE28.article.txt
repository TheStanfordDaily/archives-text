The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the "Lagunita Boat
house Night Club," we, the past and
present members of the boathouse,
have considered this worthy idea be
fore. For years, Stanford has needed
a "campus hot spot" for students

who enjoy a little informal fun.
Perhaps our student body would be
steered from the evil dens along the
highway, if a "social hangout" were
established on the campus. It is not
liquor that draws the crowds lu
these vice centers as the desire for
social contact.
If someone would bring an old vic
trola and a few to the boat
house, along with a broom and sev
eral mouse-traps, the idea could be
put into effect. During the winter
months when the lake is full an en
joyable evening could be spent
dancing and canoeing. The mice, of
course, would have to move down
stairs, but for the sake of the dear
students they would oblige willing
ly-
Are we men or are we mice, any
way? Shall we or shall we not have
a normal campus life?
