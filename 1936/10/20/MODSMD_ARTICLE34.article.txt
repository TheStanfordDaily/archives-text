# Gaieties Ideas, Talent Sought
## Old Assembly Hall To Be Background of Show 
### 
Anybody who is interested in tak- !
ing part in, or in helping with the |
Gaieties is asked to leave his ideas,
or a list of his talents at ihe Dra- j
matic Manager's office. All ideas
turned in are to be vague outlines,]
not detailed descriptions.
The general theme of this year's
production will be woten around the
fact that it is the last Gaieties to be
held in the Old Assembly Hall, ac
cording to Phil Brown, director.
Some of the history of the Gaieties
held in former years will be traced
if tentative plans are carried out.
Winstead "Doodles" Weaver is
working on a skit, which will mark
his fifth Gaieties appearance.
One of the most unusual things
about this year's show is that no set
tings will be used. Just the bare
stage of the old assembly hall, with
its much autographed walls will
serve as the background.
The only definite idea which was
revealed at this early date was the |
possibility of a magician appearing,
which is a new feature.
Deadlines for the various tryouts
are announced as follows:
Skit deadline Oct. 26
General tryouts Oct. 29, 30
Tunes Nov. 2
Singers' tryouts Nov. 5j
Chorus tryouts Nov. 5
The cheapest violins are those
manufactured in Japan where they
are pressed out of wood, instead of
being carved by hand.
