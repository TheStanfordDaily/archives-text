# Tiny Turns On Heat For Trojan Tilt
## Only Four Workouts Left Before Game; U.S.C. Is Tough in Spite of Tie 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Howard Jones's men of Troy did
not score a triumph over Washing
ton State last Saturday, so they
won't be overconfident; they didn't
lose, so they'll still have plenty of
Trojan energy left. They battled
to a 0-0 draw, and now they are out
to conquer.
With such facts in mind, Tiny
Thornhill swung his Indians into
their final series of workouts last
night. At present there are but four
sessions on the practice turf left for
the Cardinals and these promise to
be increasingly tough.
Ground Covered
As usual, last night's activities
covered a lot of ground and so did
the entire aggregation. Passing was
stressed as much as ever, new run
ning plays were worked over, and
punting drill was in full swing.
Tiny himself, having just returned
from his southern scouting trip, had
a goodly supply of noteworlhy im
pressions to think about. In his own
words, "U.S.C. had a tough time of
it against Washington State; but they
looked pretty good."
Trojan Stars
Such men as Davy Davis, first
string quarter, and Don Keller, re
serve quarter, won Thornhill's plau
dits, as did Captain Gil Kuhn, at
center, and Jimmy Jones, at full.
Although such a passing combina
tion as Keller to End Charles Wil
liams functioned pretty well, Tiny
still voiced the opinion that Troy's
tactics in the ozone were below par.
Reports from Los Angeles indi
cate that Davis and Andy Schind
ler probably will be on the sidelines
during Saturday's contest on the
Farm. Davis was suffering from torn
rib cartilages, and was to be X
rayed for possible bone injuries last
night. Schindler has a leg hurt, but
there is a strong possibility that he
will see action.
Notwithstanding rumors to the
contrary, Doc Luckett, Redskin re
serve halfback, actually has two
badly crushed fingers. He caught
them in a car door last Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley. However, he
was taking full part in practice yes
terday and there is little doubt that
he will play against Troy.

lose, so they'll still have plenty of
Trojan energy left. They battled
to a 0-0 draw, and now they are out
to conquer.
With such facts in mind, Tiny
Thornhill swung his Indians into
their final series of workouts last
night. At present there are but four
sessions on the practice turf left for
the Cardinals and these promise to
be increasingly tough.
Ground Covered
As usual, last night's activities
covered a lot of ground and so did
the entire aggregation. Passing was
stressed as much as ever, new run
ning plays were worked over, and
punting drill was in full swing.
Tiny himself, having just returned
from his southern scouting trip, had
a goodly supply of noteworlhy im
pressions to think about. In his own
words, "U.S.C. had a tough time of
it against Washington State; but they
looked pretty good."
Trojan Stars
Such men as Davy Davis, first
string quarter, and Don Keller, re
serve quarter, won Thornhill's plau
dits, as did Captain Gil Kuhn, at
center, and Jimmy Jones, at full.
Although such a passing combina
tion as Keller to End Charles Wil
liams functioned pretty well, Tiny
still voiced the opinion that Troy's
tactics in the ozone were below par.
Reports from Los Angeles indi
cate that Davis and Andy Schind
ler probably will be on the sidelines
during Saturday's contest on the
Farm. Davis was suffering from torn
rib cartilages, and was to be X
rayed for possible bone injuries last
night. Schindler has a leg hurt, but
there is a strong possibility that he
will see action.
Notwithstanding rumors to the
contrary, Doc Luckett, Redskin re
serve halfback, actually has two
badly crushed fingers. He caught
them in a car door last Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley. However, he
was taking full part in practice yes
terday and there is little doubt that
he will play against Troy.
