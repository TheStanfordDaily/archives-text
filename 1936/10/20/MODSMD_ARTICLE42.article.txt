## THE 						TIME HAS COME 
### 
Everybody knew the day was
coming, and quietly, timidly awaited
it, a few going so far as to wonder
where it would strike.
You know, the day of upsets. Big
league football up until last Satur
day had gone right down the alley—
everything happened just dandy like,
and the prognosticators, both speak
ers and writers, did strut down the
street weary from patting each other
on the back.
Even old Drofnats swaggered
around Friday night with an air of
authority. Last night he was in a
drunken stupor.
All this, of course, is laying nt
mosphere for saying that Princeton.
Ohio Stale, Pittsburgh, and the U. of
C. were sent down to defeat at the
respective hands of Penn, North
western, Duquesne, and U.C.L.A
when least did they expect it.
That game at Berkeley was a
knockout. Never did I see a team
play as close to its capabilities and
as steady a game of ball as did the
Bruins that afternoon, unless maybe
at the Rose Bowl last winter.
They ran the bayy in, they ran it
out, they ran it down, with every
body blocking as neatly as you've
seen. They'd start a sweep with four
guys in front of the ball, and made
the Cal ends look like kindergarten
kids.
Spaulding probably had it all
planned—his boys ran line plays all
afternoon to tighten the defense, and
then thrice put out killer shots, deep
passes that were good 2 out of 3.
To Hershon, the thrower, goes the
credit. The way he hung that ball
in front of Schroeder and just out of
reach of the Cal guys was something
marvelous to watch. Archer was
caught short on the first, while the
second was right between Blower
and Chapman.
If they gave a Keeble pen over
there, Funk would get it —he seemed
to kick 'em out any time and place
he pleased and also ran, passed,

tackled all afternoon- they had no
substitute for him. He outran Pol
lock on one end sweep.
Also noted at Berkeley: They sell
rooter's caps for a dollar right out
side the gate, and do land office
business . . . The Daily Californian
sports staff beat the edit staff 19-0
in a preliminary . . . U. of C. en
thusiasts seem to like football better
than we, or something, as both times
I've been over there, 150,000 people
were in the stands an hour before
game time . . . U.C.L.A. easily tore
down one pair of iron goal posts, but
then were stumped trying to break
them up. Be it moved and seconded
(seriously) that we take our hack
saws over . . . Cal yell kings wore
blue swede shoes, while the Gaels a
couple of weeks back wore red . . .
They gave a spell yell from both sec
tions, alternating the letters . . .
and a yell for President Sproul . . .
Joe E. Brown, loyal Westwood fol
lower, led the serpentine and got in
to quite a rub with one guy who
tried to steal his hat . . . Kids were
running everywhere snatching blue
and gold pom-poms, sometimes col
lecting six or eight . . . Cal stands
were very cheerful and well be
haved afterward . . . U.C.L.A. band
has good suits but punk music;
California has good music, but punk
suits.
