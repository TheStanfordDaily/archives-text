# The 						Manifesto
## 
### 
A date bureau proposed on the Stanford
campus! Agitation to do away with jolly-ups!
Cries in The Daily for a campus dance lounge
on Lagunita! Last spring's "Susan" interval!
All parts of the same problem, whether we
realize it or not. In Stanford's slow democratic
process, a campus need is making itself felt.
That need is for Stanford men and women to
get acquainted with each other.
The petit bourgeois broke down the barriers
that feudalism put in the way of the capitalistic
free market. NOW Stanford students in the
near future will break down the barriers that
interfere with Stanford dating and mating. The
Daily doesn't need to do any more than give
expression to that need, for with the inexorable
workings-out of student agitation, and it will
develop, the barriers will be broken.
One instrument already lies easily at our
feet. The Spring Quarter Dollar, which Ex
Committee finds on its hands with no way to
spend except to sink into Theater mortgage
amortization and the Student Aid Fund, can be
used along with NYA labor either to renovate
the old Lagunita boathouse, or to build a new
one. The student lounge idea, only a part of
this manifold problem, would be a great step
forward in eliminating the necessity for jolly
ups, the necessity for date bureaus.
The Daily cannot do any more than ride the
crest of student agitation and demand, which is
bound to develop, when the issues are made
clear to the students.
So:
You once were free, but are now everywhere
in chainsâ€”Lovers of the World, Unite!
