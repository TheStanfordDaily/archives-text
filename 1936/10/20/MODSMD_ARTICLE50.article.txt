# Again and Yet

I'm going to suggest a very despicable thing.
I realize that it involves basic philosophies of
government, education, and religion, but sug
gested it will be. And it is: if a freshman or
sophomore would get more fun out of attending
n matinee this afternoon than participating in
the Mud Fight, he should by all means attend
the matinee.
This runs counter to the theory of some who
hold that extrinsic loyalties are valuable for the
cultivation of loyalty, that disciplinary activities
are valuable for the cultivation of discipline,
and that anything the individual wishes to do is,
perforce, base and mean. Those who want to
be in the Mud Fight this afternoon should, by
all means, mudfight but they should not expect
others to gurgle and gursh if they don't want to.
Sophomores will say to other sophomores
and freshmen will say to other freshmen that
Ihey should go out on the peaceful playing
fields to defend the honor of the class, quite
:;mug in the belief that honor is purchased so
cheaply these days.
Those who do not go out will automatically
become traitors, just because they have dif
fering tastes in exercise.
Those who do go out and bathe themselves
in the weak solution of Searsville slime and
A.A.C. frosh field manure will, of course, feel
hat they are doing their duty. People who do
their duty enjoy also service stripes of cuts and
scratches, which they proudly exhibit to vaunt
their heroism. Dr. T. A. Storey, of the Men's
Health Service has requested The Daily to an
nounce, however, that such service stripes are
subject to tetanus, gangrene, or other spore in
fections, and should be treated at the Health
Service.
Another way to avoid infection would be to
go to the matinee.
