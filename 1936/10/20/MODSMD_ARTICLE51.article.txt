# Boondoggling on the Campus
## 
### 
Mr. Stephen Enke of the Young Democrats
takes issue in Campus Opinion today with the
Public Exercises Committee on the matter of
allowing the state head of NYA to talk in the
Little Theater this afternoon.
"The endeavor of the University," says the
communication from the President to campus
activity heads and dated October 16, "is to
have free discussion in student organizations

and among groups of students but it is impor
tant that such discussions be representative of
all sides and that they be not in any way identi
fied, even by unthinking outsiders, with the
name of the University."
Mr. Enke admits that the speech given would
not be exactly unfavorable to the present ad
ministration; on the other hand he counters
that NYA is of vital interest to college students.
The Public Exercises Committee seems quite
within its legal rights in refusing it on suspi
cious political grounds. It is certainly right in
protecting the campus from an influx of parti
san oratory. NYA administrators have shown
a sudden interest in cleaning up the seemingly
justified gripes at the local NYA set-up, that
appears to be somewhat connected with No
vember 3.
However, the University has accepted NYA
aid, and if there is a chance to have an open
discussion of it, a hint of partisan politics
shouldn't be allowed to interfere with what
concessions could be wrung from those who
have boondoggled college students, even if it
is before the election.
Or is the philosophy, that after the election,
everything, including NYA, will automatically
right itself?
