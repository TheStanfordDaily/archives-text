THE YELLOW PERIL
(By special wire—press rale collect—from the
Eisenbach sneezorium in Larkspur, Calif.)
Two weeks ago Stanford's collective sinus was a
healthy contraption. Today, surely at least 35 per cent
of us are getting colds or getting over them.
Fortunately, Stanford's social and academic routine
was not blown into a cocked hat. We are still crawling
to classes, Daily minions still stagged about beating the
paper together.
Within our range of experience, Stanford has regu
lar tidal waves of illness, some serious, some trifling.
There was the flu, the measles, and a suspicious flurry
of dysentery at Encina (a story in itself).
But the seriousness of all met official and routine
denial. Never were things out of hand. Yet the Hospi
tal filled up. The Rest Home was jammed. Fortunately,
it was never necessary to institute restrictive measures,
for by the time they were "necessary," the "number of
cases" (not "epidemic") was pointing down.
* * * *
According to the graduate M.D.'s in charge, every
thing on Stanford's physical front is always "satisfac
tory." Now. begging their pardon, we say, "the hell it
is!"
There is nothing satisfactory about a couple of hun
dred measles found hospitalization necessary or pneu
monia imminent.
As a matter of fact, we here at Stanford are so
wondrous healthy that only 50 new colds developed
from the Roble jolly-up Thursday.
Furthermore, we haven't an epidemic. Hell no! We
just have an epidemic.
* * * *
Perhaps we use the word incorrectly. We mean that
a lot of people have head colds. It may not be an epi
demic until we all have chest colds and a place on a
hospital bulletin.
Or it may not be a new epidemic until the Health
service decides. From past experience, it would seem
that is the explanation for the campus' remarkable
bill of health.
Cases of flu, cases of colds. They are baby epi
demics, to be dealt with as such and one way of doing
it is to cancel such unnecessary material clearing
houses as are jolly-ups, to admit an epidemic publicly
and to warn students against it.
This last school years, of course, if the Health Service
had started admitting things it would have sounded
like the broken record.
And the resulting publicity wouldn't have helped
the boys to an A.M.A. blue ribbon nor decreased the
Culver-Yost correspondents with nervous parents.
So the Health Service just quietly stuck to us
throat sticks and ephedrine guns and worked us over
as we wriggled in.
If we were sick, we recovered and there was no
noise. Things were "satisfactory"—the B.A.C. didn't
say for whom.
