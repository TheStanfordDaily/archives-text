# OUR HASHER

### 
History is repeating itself. Roble Hall, cradle of
Stanford womanhood, is up to its old tricks. Last
year, Our Hasher was surprised when one of the
Roble girls practically swooned because a hasher was
seen at the President's Reception.
Back in "Four Corners," girlies didn't dance with
the help. 'Now comes the story that a Roble gal ac
tually did swoon this year when she saw a hasher at
the reception. The hasher, however, emerged un
scathed.
Added to this is the strange case of Roble Hall vs.
Head Hasher. For over three years a Phi Delt tennis
player has been hashing to Roble and Roble has been
gnashing at the Phi Delt. The trouble seems to be that
Roble doesn't like his attitude.
Last year at about this time, Our Hasher printed an
anonymous bit of verse, complaining of the lofty atti
tude of the hasher. The hash machine rejoined in the
columns with a bit of verse that went something like
this: "His job was concerned with hashin', and that
crowded dniing halls were not the place for pashin'."
This year salt has been rubbed into the old wound,
and again Roble is perturbed about the Phi Delt tennis
player, known affectionately by Roble women as "Mr.
God." Early last week the head mnrt appeared in the
hall with one arm in a sling. This brought forth the
deepest sympathy from the women, until he was seen
to remove the injured member and wave energetically
to one of his fair customers.
Immdiately this provoked stern measures: Thurs
day night brfore the jolly-up an entire Roble dining
hall came down with his arm in a sling. The women
did not remove the injured members, however, and
j wave to Mr. God.
Mr. God commented that this was all rather juve
nile, but as yet, Our Hasher has not received any poetry
from either side.
