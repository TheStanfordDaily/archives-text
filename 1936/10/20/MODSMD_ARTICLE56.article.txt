# Wilburs Entertain Transfers, Faculty
## 
### 
Last Friday night at their home on
Lagunita Knoll, President and Mrs.
Wilbur entertained the transfers, the
new graduate students and faculty
members at an informal reception.
The house was decorated with
bowls of native California fruits and
flowers, and the formal garden in
the back of the house was lighted
with strings of colored lights.
