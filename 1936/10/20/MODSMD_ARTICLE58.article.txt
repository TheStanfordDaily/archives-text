"SWING TIME" (RKO) at the Stan
ford Theater.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in
another dance musical of the dance
musical variety originated by them.
The story creaks more, music is not
up to earlier "Top Hat's" but
"Swing Time," through its dancing
makes good entertainment.
You will like the snowstorm se
quence where Rogers and Astaire
sing "A Fine Romance." Only other
good tune is "The Way You Look
Tonight," which Astaire sings to
Rogers, her hair stiff with shampoo
lather.
Eric Blore surprises in the role of
the mincing, moustached dancing
school proprietor. As "Pop," the
sleight-of-hand artist. Victor Moore
is amusing, and Helen Broderick
gets some of the best lines as Rogers'
hard-boiled co-worker.
More dancing, more novelties like
Fred Astaire's blackface number and
"Swing Time" would have been more
outstanding. —Warson
