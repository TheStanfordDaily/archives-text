## 
### WALTER PETERSON 
It took a vote from the whole stu
dent body to sustain it, but sustain
it they did. So today at 4:15 the
freshmen and the sophomores go
round and round and through the
mire and stuff for the glory of dear
old '39 and dear old '40, as the annual
Mud Fight staggers through another
annum.
Traditional for years and years,
although it was interrupted for a
while when an attempt was made to
institute a tie-up battle some years
ago, the Great Struggle has always
gone to the freshman class, through
superiority of numbers.
Many, Many Frosh
This year again the frosh are le
gion, and once again they are fa
vored to smear the sophs. Pete Fay,
soph prexy, and his chief aides-de
camp, Jack Cowan, Pete McArthur,
and Al Alustiza, are stubborn souls
and don't believe a word of it. They
really think they have it in their
pockets.

The frosh, according to reports,
don't think. But they do amass such
a great, blundering, overpowering
Juggernaut that they never have to
think. They just roll.
Says Pete Fay, "There seems to be
good organization among our fel
lows, and we have a pretty good
gang all around. This is going to be
one of the best chances yet for the
sophs to come through with more
glory and less mud."
Toughies, Hey?
And Joe Mulligan, frosh brawl
captain, avers, "The frosh are all
set. We have a big gang, and we're
going out there looking for a good
fight."
So, under Ex Commiftee sanction
and approval of about four-fifths of
the students, the mess goes on today
on the frosh football field. Chick
Franich, Roy Thompson, and Bob
Mallett, appointed by the Ex Com
mittee, are in charge.
