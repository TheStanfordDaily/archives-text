Two delightful shades you'll want the minute you lay
eyes on them. Sparkling and exciting all through
the season. Blend or match them with your new
ensembles and watch the ultra-smart result.
Brownlcaf ... a neutral brown for brown and black.
Cedar ... a lighter brown for wines, greens and navy.
Phoenix stockings are firmly sheer yet
$1.00 have a special talent for resisting wear.
