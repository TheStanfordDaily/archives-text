# Sophs Dunk Freshmen In Slime Pit
## Jack Cowan Leads '39 To Victory in Mud Fight That Ended Mud Fights 
### Walt Peterson 
Brains, master strategy, a super
hyper-ultra magnificent line of at
tack did it for the sophomores, as
they scored a thundering victory
over the freshmen yesterday after
noon on the frosh football field to
be the first and last class ever to
win the annual Mud Fight two years
in a row, following Ex Committee's
decision last night to ban the tradi
tional scrap.
As was noted yesterday in The
Daily, the frosh don't think, and up
to this year they never had to win
the Brawl hands down. The Napo
leons among the sophs, Jack Cowan
at the helm, planned a come-and
gct-us attitude to lure the unknow
ing first-year men down to the soph
end of the runway, next to the soph
pit.
Sophs Strike
Then, with a masterful stroke and
a rapier - thrust, the second - year
warriors encirclcd the green ones
and began a devastating drive which
put their opponents into the mire
by threes and fours.
The frosh finally got themselves
out of the tangle, after having con
siderably more than 100 of their
number plopped into the mud, and
then began a more cautious attack.
However, the sophs still held to their
system and forced the frosh to carry
the fight to them, while they stood
backed to their own pit fifty yards
from the frosh dunking bunker.
Frosh Lack Technique
The result, according to Chick
Franich, master muck-a-muck of
the whole affair, was around 210
dunked frosh and about 54 sunk
sophs. The frosh picked up after the
first sad encounter, but they never
could get more than one soph to their
pit at a time. The total doesn't add
up very rapidly that way, they
found.
With the pace slowing after the
first few flurries, a mere handful of
sophs held off a growling horde of
freshmen for the major portion of
the battle.
Immediately following the final
gun a couple of intrepid movie
cameramen moved onto the field,
one on top of a car and the other on
foot, to get a series of shots of the
gallant but dripping gladiators. The
sophs were shy and retiring, it would
seem, for they wern't around for the
shots, but a howling gang of frosh
practically trod the poor guy to
death in a mob scene before the
Pathc - equipped - with - sound. The
frosh had a swell time after the
fight, in spite of the fact that they
didn t fare so well between the gun
shots.
