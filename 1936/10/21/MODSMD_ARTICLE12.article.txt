# Watch for Big Political Expose In First Chappie Tomorrow
## U.S. Vote Is Caricatized; Pop-Off, Fables Back 
### 
One hundred per cent faithful to
its "Politics and Sociology" theme,
the first Chaparral of the year goes
on sale tomorrow morning at Engi
neer's Corner for 15 cents.
Responsible for this October num
ber of Thappie is lean, whimsical,
bespectacled Editor Gilman Gist,
whose art and fancy have embellish
ed Stanford's humor mag for the
past four years. ,
Besides, there's Jean Farmer, sis
ter to graphic arts department head
Ed Farmer, who carries the Farmer
tradition to new heights with a
searching presentation of the great
American voting public through the
medium of caricature.
Then there's Little Pop Off, chron
icled by Charles Hood, who started
the Injun boy off last year. Hood
sent his stuff down from Elko, Ne
vada. Besides the doings of the
Farm's number one papoose, Charles
has written an expose of Peggy Lan
don's high school social life, and
other articles.
Art. work is by McKenna, Gilles
pie, Page Gilman, Rodell Johnson,
Jack Dixon (a frosh newcomer), and
Old Boy Gil Gist, who is responsible
for the loud but poignant cover.
Fables of the Farm flow glibly
from the typewriters of Bob Hart
mann and Marco Thorne ('3B and
'39), while Tro Harper, Quad pho
tographer, has arranged a picture
layout from material stolen from the
annals of that annual by Chappie for
this purpose.
The Old Boy, aided and abetted,
has done the NOW THAT'S, those
important editorials which have had
such an influence on Stanford's his
tory.
In butterflies, red, yellows, and
browns are pigment colors, while
greens and blues are due mostly to
refraction of light.
