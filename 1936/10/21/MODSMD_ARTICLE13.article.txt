# NYA Director Avoids Politics In Talk
## 
### Hunter Hendec 
If it was a politiacl pep-talk the
35 or 40 Palo Alto matrons cxpccted
to hear as they listened to Mrs. Anne
D. G. Treadwell, state NYA director,
yesterday afternoon at the Commu
nity Center, they were disappointed.
Mrs. Treadwell, in spite of spon
sorship by Young Democrats of Palo
Alto, spoke entirely upon the aims,
methods, and results of the NYA;
and she did not waver from her sub
ject once to put in a word about the
weather, the smiling faces before
her, or the coming presidential elec
tion.
Predicts Continuance
As if to point out that her talk
was concerned only with the stu
dent employment project, she said:
"It makes no difference who has ac
i eomplished this groat move (i.e., the
NYA), but rather that it has been
accomplished." And she concluded:
"With all optimism I say we may
have this project with us for many
years to come."
NYA talk made the afternoon's
get-together so non-political, in fact,

that Paly Democratic Leader Mrs.
Frost practically apologized for men
tioning the word "Democrat" when
reminding the audience of the party's
big rally the latter part of this
week.
Campaigning Vetoed
Questioned later as to intentions
of Roosevelt-boosting had she been
officially asked to speak here on the
campus, Mrs. Treadwell made it
clear that Aubrey Williams, na
tional NYA director, and Harry Hop
kins, head of the WPA (to some de
gree parent organization of NYA),
absolutely forbid political campaign
ing by departmental officers.
Asked if she would consider tak
ing the suggestion of Dr. Swain,
Stanford Public Exercises Commit
tee chairman, namely, to discuss j
NYA after the election, she said,
"Certainly, I might even make a
political speech then!"
Creates Jobs
She pointed out that the aim of
the NYA move is to provide to stu
dents not only funds necessary for j
continuing study but also training i

along lines their interests and tal
ents direct them.
Problem of the project is to cre
ate jobs which do not throw regular
workers out of employment. She de
fended the project against charges
of "boondoggling" by asserting that
such charges came from people dis
satisfied by seeing those in need of
relief pursuing work along lines they
enjoyed.
Republican Praises
Stanford Democrat Stephen Enko
was not present to hear Mrs. Tread
well's NYA discussion. However,
Mrs. Inez G. Richardson, secretary
in charge of student welfare investi
gation under the Hoover adminis
c*
trnt.ion, was present.
Said Mrs. Richardson: "I liked
Mrs. Trradwell's talk very much,
and I think she is working very
conscientiously."
Mrs. Richardson's criticism of the
NYA. however, is leveled at the ad
ministrative set-up, a thing which,
she was very careful to point out, is
entirely out of Mrs. Treadwell's
province.
