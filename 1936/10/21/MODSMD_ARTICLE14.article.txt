# Lecturer Talks On Pueblos
## Indian History, Society Of Southwest Discussed 
### 
Dr. Herbert E. Bolton last night
addressed a large body of interested
listeners in the Assembly Hall on
"The Indian Country of the South
west." The talk covered the history
and traditions of the Pueblo, Navajo,
and Ute Indians. After a short ad
dress by Professor P. A. Martin of
the History Department, Dr. Bolton,
head of tin History Department and
director of the Bancroft Library at
the University of California, shoved
a number of colored slides of Indian
dwellings.
Dr. Bolton estimates that Pueblo
civilization has existed in the South
west of the United States for 20,000
years. For the last 100 years, the
Pueblo, Spanish, and Nordic races
have lived together in a small terri
tory without strife. This is the
longest period in our history that
any three distinct races have been
able to remain in close proximity
without one of them assuming the
role of ruler.
Dr. Bolton evinced a great deal
of interest in the cliff dwellings of
Mesa Verde and the Valley of the
Dead. They are built under over
hanging rock and in the rock itself.
Some of them are watch-towers.
Others are used as living or sleep
ing quarters. The third main group
is made up of "frat, houses," small
round holes.
Indian ceremonial consists mainly
of elaborate dances, each tribe hav
ing its own conception of the cele
bration. The missionaries of the
Roman Catholic Church have failed
to make much headway against the
local forms of worship, and the result
is a complicated system ol half-
Christian, half-pagan rituals.
