# Further Mud Fights Banned
## Ex Committee Abolishes Underclass Melee Despite Student Body Approval Campus 'Night Spot' Plan Referred To Sub-Committee; Ask Wilbur To Allow Women Singers with Outside Bands 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The first freshman class ever to lose a frosh-soph mud light will never
have another chance to defend its "honor"—the Stanford underclassmen's
mud fight W as abolished forever hy unanimous vote of Ex Committee
last night.
Despite 4-to-l student hody approval of the "tradition," expressed by
last week's popular election, the A.S.S.U. legislative body felt that (In

death."
"The whole thing was a farce," de
clared Chick Franich, mud fight,
committee chairman, when the com-
I mittee was considering the affair

"Nothing Indecent"
"There wasn't any fighting, there
wasn't even anything indecent about

it. now. We gave it a fair chance

I campus interest intensely aroused —
but the mud fight just fizzled out,"
he said. "If we abolish it now, peo
ple will begin to think of a suitable
substitute."
Larry Rouble, new graduate mem
ber elected" last week, felt, that. "The
Daily's attitude helped to flop it. The
participants thought they were being
juvenile."
The committee agreed that some
other form of frosh-soph rivalry
should take the mud fight's place,
but left the final decision until next
year.
Nitery Considered
After considerable discussion of
the pros and cons of establishing a
campus "night spot," the committee
approved President Jim Reynolds'
subcommittee for investigating the
situation. Vice-president Esther
Pelton, Chick Franich, Tom Killefer,
and Barbara Kimball were ap
pointed.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth would
not. approve building an "expensivr"
dancing and refreshment establish
ment on the campus right now,
Chuck Fontius, student manager,
said.
"To rebuild the Lagunita Boat
house or build another place, Mr.
Roth feels, would cost the A.S.S.U. at
least $50,000," explained Fontius.
"Such an investment would never
pay because student interest in it
would soon fade."
Union Not Secluded
There was a possibility of using
the Women's Clubhouse or the Un
ion lobby for dancing on Saturday
night, Roth had suggested, but Ex
Committee seemed to favor a more
permanent and secluded "nitery"
situated away from the campus
center.
Evidently in the spirit of fun,
Franich moved "we have a cocktail
lounge." His motion was disregarded.
Some of the members, especially
Fontius, believed current student,
reaction for a dancing spot was
"only temporary. The trouble with
the enforcement agents will blow
over and students will again be
flocking down the highway."
Meanwhile, other Ex Committee
business included:
