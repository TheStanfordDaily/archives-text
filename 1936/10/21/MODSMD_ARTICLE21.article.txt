# Further Mud Fights Banned
## Ex Committee Abolishes Underclass Melee Despite Student Body Approval Campus 'Night Spot' Plan Referred To Sub-Committee; Ask Wilbur To Allow Women Singers with Outside Bands 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The first freshman class ever to lose a frosh-soph mud light will never
have another chance to defend its "honor"—the Stanford underclassmen's
mud fight W as abolished forever hy unanimous vote of Ex Committee
last night.
Despite 4-to-l student hody approval of the "tradition," expressed by
last week's popular election, the A.S.S.U. legislative body felt that (In

"The whole thing was a farce," de
clared Chick Franich, mud fight,

I mittee was considering the affair

"Nothing Indecent"

wasn't even anything indecent about

but the mud fight just fizzled out,"
he said. "If we abolish it now, peo
ple will begin to think of a suitable
substitute."
Larry Rouble, new graduate mem
ber elected" last week, felt, that. "The
Daily's attitude helped to flop it. The
participants thought they were being
juvenile."
The committee agreed that some
other form of frosh-soph rivalry
should take the mud fight's place,
but left the final decision until next
year.
Nitery Considered
After considerable discussion of
the pros and cons of establishing a
campus "night spot," the committee
approved President Jim Reynolds'
subcommittee for investigating the
situation. Vice-president Esther
Pelton, Chick Franich, Tom Killefer,
and Barbara Kimball were ap
pointed.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth would
not. approve building an "expensivr"
dancing and refreshment establish
ment on the campus right now,
Chuck Fontius, student manager,
said.
"To rebuild the Lagunita Boat
house or build another place, Mr.
Roth feels, would cost the A.S.S.U. at
least $50,000," explained Fontius.
"Such an investment would never
pay because student interest in it
would soon fade."
Union Not Secluded
There was a possibility of using
the Women's Clubhouse or the Un
ion lobby for dancing on Saturday
night, Roth had suggested, but Ex
Committee seemed to favor a more
permanent and secluded "nitery"
situated away from the campus
center.
Evidently in the spirit of fun,
Franich moved "we have a cocktail
lounge." His motion was disregarded.
Some of the members, especially
Fontius, believed current student,
reaction for a dancing spot was
"only temporary. The trouble with
the enforcement agents will blow
over and students will again be
flocking down the highway."
Meanwhile, other Ex Committee
business included:
WOMEN ENTERTAINERS with
outside orchestras — The committee
sent a letter to Dr. Wilbur advocat
ing his rescinding of the ruling that
outside orchestras cannot bring sing
ers and entertainers to campus en
gagements.
"It is pretty obvious that good or
chestras won't violate the standard
of decency when their own reputa
tions are at stake," said Shirley
Jones.
CHAPERONES AT CAMPUS
DANCES—Franich reported an in
terview with Dean Mary Yost at
which time they favored "the dance
chairmen being given complete re
sponsibility for proper treatment of
chaperones."
The Committee approved their
suggestions—that invitations to fac
ulty members be mailed or deliv
ered in person, not telephones; that
chaperones be driven to and from
the dance if necessary; that they be
given the chance to talk to and be
come acquainted with students at the
dances; and that young faculty
members who enjoy dancing be
asked if possible.

The whole system is wrong. Chap
erones are, again, obliging people
who put themselves out to come to
a campus dance. But no matter
what princes they may be personally,
the system sends them as snoopers,
and no wonder they are treated as
necessary evils.
And for that matter, why does it
have to be a foregone conclusion that
a campus dance without a chaperone
would turn into a Roman holiday?

The whole system is wrong. Chap

who put themselves out to come to
a campus dance. But no matter
what princes they may be personally,
the system sends them as snoopers,

necessary evils.

have to be a foregone conclusion that

The first freshman class ever to lose a frosh-soph mud light will never
have another chance to defend its "honor"—the Stanford underclassmen's
mud fight W as abolished forever hy unanimous vote of Ex Committee
last night.
Despite 4-to-l student hody approval of the "tradition," expressed by
last week's popular election, the A.S.S.U. legislative body felt that (In

death."
"The whole thing was a farce," de
clared Chick Franich, mud fight,
committee chairman, when the com-
I mittee was considering the affair
| last night.
"Nothing Indecent"
"There wasn't any fighting, there
wasn't even anything indecent about
it. We should abolish it, and abolish
it. now. We gave it a fair chance
today's was a perfect set-up with
I campus interest intensely aroused —
but the mud fight just fizzled out,"
he said. "If we abolish it now, peo
ple will begin to think of a suitable
substitute."
Larry Rouble, new graduate mem
ber elected" last week, felt, that. "The
Daily's attitude helped to flop it. The
participants thought they were being
juvenile."
The committee agreed that some
other form of frosh-soph rivalry
should take the mud fight's place,
but left the final decision until next
year.
Nitery Considered
After considerable discussion of
the pros and cons of establishing a
campus "night spot," the committee
approved President Jim Reynolds'
subcommittee for investigating the
situation. Vice-president Esther
Pelton, Chick Franich, Tom Killefer,
and Barbara Kimball were ap
pointed.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth would
not. approve building an "expensivr"
dancing and refreshment establish
ment on the campus right now,
Chuck Fontius, student manager,
said.
"To rebuild the Lagunita Boat
house or build another place, Mr.
Roth feels, would cost the A.S.S.U. at
least $50,000," explained Fontius.
"Such an investment would never
pay because student interest in it
would soon fade."
Union Not Secluded
There was a possibility of using
the Women's Clubhouse or the Un
ion lobby for dancing on Saturday
night, Roth had suggested, but Ex
Committee seemed to favor a more
permanent and secluded "nitery"
situated away from the campus
center.
Evidently in the spirit of fun,
Franich moved "we have a cocktail
lounge." His motion was disregarded.
Some of the members, especially
Fontius, believed current student,
reaction for a dancing spot was
"only temporary. The trouble with
the enforcement agents will blow
over and students will again be
flocking down the highway."
Meanwhile, other Ex Committee
business included:
WOMEN ENTERTAINERS with
outside orchestras — The committee
sent a letter to Dr. Wilbur advocat
ing his rescinding of the ruling that
outside orchestras cannot bring sing
ers and entertainers to campus en
gagements.
"It is pretty obvious that good or
chestras won't violate the standard
of decency when their own reputa
tions are at stake," said Shirley
Jones.
CHAPERONES AT CAMPUS
DANCES—Franich reported an in
terview with Dean Mary Yost at
which time they favored "the dance
chairmen being given complete re
sponsibility for proper treatment of
chaperones."
The Committee approved their
suggestions—that invitations to fac
ulty members be mailed or deliv
ered in person, not telephones; that
chaperones be driven to and from
the dance if necessary; that they be
given the chance to talk to and be
come acquainted with students at the
dances; and that young faculty
members who enjoy dancing be
asked if possible.
