# SOUR GRIPES
## CHAPERONES AND SUCH 
### 
It seems that the chaperones at
campus dances have not been prop
erly treated of late. Just where the
insults lay has not been disclosed,
but probably the chaperones have
been shoved, as usual, into a side
room at the north end of the party
while the juveniles adjourned to re
organize the party as iar to the south
as possible.
This, of course, is a deplorable
state of affairs. It implies that a
chaperone is something like a cop
at a taxi-dance, the guy who keeps
law and order among a gang of
Philistines who have ideas about
how much better things would be
without law and order.
Only a cop at a taxi-dance is usu
ally a tough mug who derives some
sort of spiritual satisfaction out of
tossing Navy petty officers, the
pretty white hats, and the women
downstairs. Chaperones at dances
are nice people who often look
bored, miserable, out of place, and
definitely not in their own genera
tion.
I wonder how many chaperones,
when the task of being watchdogs of
social morality grows sort of tire
some, wonder just what they are
supposed to be doing anyway?
* * *
At a fraternity off-campus dance,
where sin is darkly rumored to run
rampant in a feeble way, a chaperone
might save a soul or two. The only
thing is that in such an affair, espe
cially if it is held in a private home,
the party does not go wild as much
as it muddles along for an abnor
mally long length of time. The or
chestra plays until two, then the
hoys with campus dates take them
home and come back. The imported
dates stick around, somebody turns
on the radio, and everybody stays
and stays and stays until nobody re
members just what happened after
that.
But at a campus dance, the great
sin that chaperones would prevent
is dancing without moving the feet.
Even here the utility of a chaperone
is to be doubted. After all, the boy
who introduces the dime-a-danee
technique into his style does not fear
