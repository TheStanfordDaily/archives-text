# Friday Rush Cards On Sale at A.S.S.U.
## 
### 
Rushing cards will continue on
sale today in the A.S.S.U. office for
this Friday's rushing period.
Twenty-five hundred cards are
available to fraternities for the one
day period which ends at 8 o'clock
Friday. No rushing is being held
on Saturday, and 8 p.m. is the time
limit because the houses need time
to prepare for S.C. game open
houses.

The oldest copper roof in the
world is that on the Hildesheim Ca
thedral, in Germany. It was put on
in 1320.
