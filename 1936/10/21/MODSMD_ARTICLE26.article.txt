# Four New Roads Will Smooth Way For Campus Autos This Week-end
## 
### R. B. Jones 
Stanford jilloppees will no longer
have to threaten the lives of Stan
ford students whose noses are buried
in huge volumes. All the paving
construction will be over by the
week-end, and the S.C. visitors will
have the pleasure of riding over at
least four smooth pavements on the
campus.
"Even the one that The Daily has
been writing editorials about for the
last fifteen years will be smooth as
glass," says Almon E. Roth, comp
troller. Mr. Roth added that he had
finally found out what made that
road over near the Chem building so
bumpy. The road used to be twenty
feet wide, and when they moved the
palms, the remaining holes were
clogged with soft dirt—which sank—
on top of which the road sank. But
that's to be remedied.
Also the goddess Aphrodite can go
back to work in her old haunts now
that Lovers' Lane will be open for
use. Some member of the class of '40
thanked God—or the goddess, as he
gently patted a sore spot from which
the B.A.C. doctors had plucked sev
eral cactus splinters.
The new road in front of the
equally new theater will be done
by halves. First the dressing will be
put on one side and then on the
other, and that's cold turkey. The
old chains that protected A.S.S.U.
pedestrians from being awakened
firmly from their cultural reveries
will be replaced when these roads
are opened.
