MY FRIENDS, \VF ARE
PLAYING U.S.C. THIS WEEK
1 don't know how many of you
have heard about it, but we have a
football game coming up this Satur
day.
Yes, we played Santa Clara a while
back, a rival of long standing, but
alv/ays they were passed oft by say
ing, "non-conference."
And there was Washington State
and Oregon after that, but we hadn't
played the Webfeet for seven years
and had never played the Cougars
before, so there wasn't much rivalry
in that corner.
But this week, you lethargic in
dividuals, there is a different situa
tion. I hope the freshmen, who so
far have been disappointed at our
attitude toward football, will be giv
en a different lesson.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia are our "number two boys"
at present; California is and always
will be in the first row of the rivalry
contingent.
But during a great part of the
Warner regime Cal didn't amount to
much, and that rivalry sagged. Dur
ing that same time, however, the
Trojans used to beat us just as regu
larly as clockwork, and thereby grew
into a prominent spot on the list.
Then came Tiny Thornhill and the
Class of '36 team that was better
than the others. They came from be
hind and slapped the Trojans down
13-7 in their own back yard back in
1933, ending a two-year winning
stretch for the other guys, and get
ling the Stanford name as much
fame and glory around the nation as
ever it gained in one day.
Some of us still around were down
there that day. Remember it, gang?
SOMETHING LACKING
IN '34 AND '35
Alter that came two years of wins
for us—'34 and last year at 16-0 and
3-0, but they seemed to lack the
sting because U.S.C. was down in
the ruck — anybody could beat 'em.
I admit that last year was a scorcher
while it lasted, but Stanford in the
mood could have done better.
So you get a different situation
from any this time, but closer to
1933 than the rest. They're in and
up again. Not because the L.A. pa
pers are booming them—they always
do—but because this week by a na
tional vote of A.P. sports writers the
Trojans come sixth.
Sixth, get it? If we beat them, we
could consifjcr ourselves sixth na
tionally, or at least way up in there.
It would be their first drop this year,
and take five quarts of the "heh,
heh" out of them. I'm telling you,
we've got something to shoot at, and
if it's a Cardinal sun that sets Sat
urday, we're entitled to holler and
scream all night long.
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
IN FOOTBALL
The townsfolk will stay away be
cause we haven't got a chance. Let
'em. I say we have.
It s too bad that Davy Davis broke
a rib last Saturday, because he was
undoubtedly the spearhead of their
whole attack. The quarter, or tail
back. on a Jones system team carries
the ball on all the fundamental plays
except two—a fullback's plunge and
an end run to the weak side.
With Davis and Ambrose Schind
ler, the second-string quarter, both
on the injured list, they might have
a howl. Both, probably, will play,
but it 11 still be a howl. Paulman and
Hamilton are too far away to be a
howl.
I think we can win because Thorn
hill says so. According to the Max
Schmeling, he knew several months!
beforehand that he could beat Joe
Louis, a thing then considered im
possible, because he had discovered
something in Louis' style that he
knew he had the ability to punish.
Our first big week is here, gang,
and the sooner you realize the ex
lent of it, the better. —Klauber
