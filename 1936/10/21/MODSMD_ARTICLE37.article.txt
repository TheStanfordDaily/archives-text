# Indians Whet Knives For Trojan Scalps
## Team Studies Opponents; Aerial Plays, Blocking Are Stressed in Practice 
### Herb Diamond 
Apparently everything being in
readiness for the final windup of
practice sessions, and the situation
being all quiet, there remains only
one minor question for Tiny Thorn
hill and his Redskins to speculate
about.
There may be numerous queries
anent Saturday's conflict with U.S.C.
that only the game itself can answer,
but this little point may forever re
main a matter for conjecture. It is
just this: were the Cougars so much
tougher against Troy than they were
against the Indians, or was Howard
Jones perhaps reserving his more
befuddling tactics for Stanford and
thus withheld them last week?
Why Trojan Defeat?
In other words, why should the
highly touted Trojans be held to a
scoreless tie by Washington State?
Tiny sought in vain the stuff that has
been making Troy such great shucks,
and Jim Lawson, who accompanied
him to Los Angeles, could add only
a little to the information that Tiny
himself had gleaned.
Last week-end the Farm squad
was benefited more than a little by ,
a closeup study of the California- I
U.C.L.A. melee. The men took ad
vantage of the rare opportunity of j
seeing in action two strong teams j
they have yet to meet. In fact, j
they've taken full advantage of every j
opportunity for gaining gridiron
knowledge.
Calvelli Stars
The Cardinals' pigskin education
in the past week and a half has been j
liberal and complete, and gratifying I
it is to note that their spirit has \
suffered not a bit. They are still
bound to triumph over two or three '
Coast favorites before the season
closes.
Tom Collins, probably the most
dependable kicker that has turned !
up in practice yet, has been used j
lately at fullback. He was at that '
post much of the time yesterday !
afternoon and should be in most of
the festivities Saturday. "Hands"
Calvelli has been winning further J
praise. His passing is definitely im- I
proving, he is a hard-driving ball
carrier, but his punting is only fair, i
Aerial Defense
Fred Williams, speedy left half,
appears to be by far the best punter
but his prowess fails him when un- I
der fire. Glenn Hamilton returned '
to the practice turf Monday, but the
possibility that he will play against I
the Trojans is still very remote.
The continued stressing of aerial
offense is slated for the remainder of ,
this week, as is fundamental drilling :
in defense. Blocking and tackling
will come in for a lot of attention.
Last night it was a two-hour
scrimmage with everyone except
Stone, Hamilton, and Grant taking 1
prat, principally first against second
string. Calvelli sparkled on defense,
and Cofiis seemed awfully hard to
tackle in the open field. Much of
the defense work was a goal line
stand, 7-2-2.

Why Trojan Defeat?
In other words, why should the
highly touted Trojans be held to a
scoreless tie by Washington State?
Tiny sought in vain the stuff that has
been making Troy such great shucks,
and Jim Lawson, who accompanied
him to Los Angeles, could add only
a little to the information that Tiny
himself had gleaned.
Last week-end the Farm squad
was benefited more than a little by ,
a closeup study of the California- I
U.C.L.A. melee. The men took ad
vantage of the rare opportunity of j
seeing in action two strong teams j
they have yet to meet. In fact, j
they've taken full advantage of every j
opportunity for gaining gridiron
knowledge.
Calvelli Stars
The Cardinals' pigskin education
in the past week and a half has been j
liberal and complete, and gratifying I
it is to note that their spirit has \
suffered not a bit. They are still
bound to triumph over two or three '
Coast favorites before the season
closes.
Tom Collins, probably the most
dependable kicker that has turned !
up in practice yet, has been used j
lately at fullback. He was at that '
post much of the time yesterday !
afternoon and should be in most of
the festivities Saturday. "Hands"
Calvelli has been winning further J
praise. His passing is definitely im- I
proving, he is a hard-driving ball
carrier, but his punting is only fair, i
Aerial Defense
Fred Williams, speedy left half,
appears to be by far the best punter
but his prowess fails him when un- I
der fire. Glenn Hamilton returned '
to the practice turf Monday, but the
possibility that he will play against I
the Trojans is still very remote.
The continued stressing of aerial
offense is slated for the remainder of ,
this week, as is fundamental drilling :
in defense. Blocking and tackling
will come in for a lot of attention.
Last night it was a two-hour
scrimmage with everyone except
Stone, Hamilton, and Grant taking 1
prat, principally first against second
string. Calvelli sparkled on defense,
and Cofiis seemed awfully hard to
tackle in the open field. Much of
the defense work was a goal line
stand, 7-2-2.
Apparently everything being in
readiness for the final windup of
practice sessions, and the situation
being all quiet, there remains only
one minor question for Tiny Thorn
hill and his Redskins to speculate
about.
There may be numerous queries
anent Saturday's conflict with U.S.C.
that only the game itself can answer,
but this little point may forever re
main a matter for conjecture. It is
just this: were the Cougars so much
tougher against Troy than they were
against the Indians, or was Howard
Jones perhaps reserving his more
befuddling tactics for Stanford and
thus withheld them last week?
