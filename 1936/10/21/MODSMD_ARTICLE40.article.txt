# Varsity, Jayvee Tankmen Defeat Olympic Water Poloists Monday
## Thornton Prepares For Troy Tilt Saturday 
### GENE GEAR 
In a rough and tumble battle, com
plete with ducking sprees and the
mysterious eclipse of the lights, the
Stanford varsity water poloists
whipped the Olympic Club eleven
into the foam of iTncina Pool Mon
day night to the tune of 5-3.
In the preliminary argument, the
Stanford junior varsity showed an
amazing amount of speed and finesse
to duck the Olympic Club jayvees
by a convincing 6-3 margin. Bill
Allen, flashy sprint man for the
Card juniors, won high point honors
with three goals.
The Indian varsity, showing even
more precision and team work than
was in evidence in the Bruin tilt,
completely outplayed the rugged
Clubmen in the first half, gaining a
lead of 3-0 at half time.
With a little more than a minute to
play, Nort Thornton's men were out
in front 5-1, but the never-tiring
Club water dogs wo ildn't call it an
evening and fought back, scoring
two points before the final gun.
Don Peterson, Stanford's fighting
left guard, swam off with high point
honors for the game with two tallies.
Bill Hanna, who played an excellent
game at sprint; Bob Walker, diminu
tive left forward; and John Lamb,
sophomore scoring sensation, all shot
in one goal apiece for the victorious
Red team.
The team swung into heavy prac
tice yesterday in preparation for
their battle with the U.S.C. Trojans
in Encina Pool Saturday morning.
The Card varsity is tied for the
lead in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, southern division, with the
California Bears. The Indians whip
ped the U.C.L.A. Bruins 7-5, and the
Bears won from their unfortunate
brothers from the south, 5-2.
