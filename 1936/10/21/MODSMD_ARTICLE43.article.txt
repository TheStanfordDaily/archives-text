# Duquesne 'Buries' Pittsburgh Panther
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Pa., Oct. 19 (U.R).
â€”The Pitt Panther was "buried"
Monday in the Allegheny river.
Happy Duquesne University stu
dents, celebrating their upset 7-0
victory over the Pitt Panthers Sat
urday, invaded the down-town sec
tion with a rough box at noon and
paraded through department stores.
The procession wound around the
"Golden Triangle" and terminated in
the middle of the Sixth street bridge,
where, with appropriate ceremony
and crocodile tears, the rough box
was heaved over the railing and dis
appeared beneath the water.
