# Coach Juggles Frosh Lineup For Bruin Tilt
## Many Aspirants Seeking Guard, Center Posts; Patton May Play 
### 
The first thing apparent to a visi
tor at freshman football practice is
the manner in which the lineup is
constantly juggled. There are few
positions which are the private prop
erty of any one individual on the
Stanford frosh grid squad.
For instance, the guard spot was
alternately occupied by Stockton
Shaw, Ernie Damarus, Gordie Mc-
Culloch, and Dick DeLauer. Center
also found several contenders put
ting in their bid for first-string
fame. Pat Nowell, Frank Carter,
and Ted deMailly were taking turns
filling the ball-snapping post while
Hugh Radke, regular center, watched
from the sidelines. Radke is ex
pected to play against U.C.L.A.,
however.
Returns to Practice
A cause for cheer in the Papoose
camp was the return to practice of
Chet Patton, long absent fullback.
If he can learn the signals in time,
Chet may see action in the Bruin
battle.
Whether or not the presence of
Frank Alustiza, assistant coach and
past master of the art of quick
kicking, had anything to do with the
sudden talent acquired by Rod Par
ker for booting the ball with light
ning-like rapidity from a couple of
yards behind scrimmage is not
known, but the fact remains that
young Rod has become a definite
threat in the role of rapid fire punter.
Wilson's Back Bruised
Harold (Bunny) Wilson was in
jured in yesterday's practice and
suffered a recurrence of an old
back ailment. Norman Juney had a
little trouble with his ankle, but is
expected to have the damaged mem
ber in shape before Saturday.
The practice was largely devoted
to defense against U.C.L.A. plays,
with the second-string pretending
to be the baby Bruins.
The following players have been
selected to make the trip south for
the U.C.L.A. frosh game: ends: Gal
lerneau, Willard, Peers, Greer,
Grant, Almy; tackles: Anderson,
Lewis, Young, Durckel, deMailly;
giiards: Damarus, Juney, Delauer,
McCulloch, Bardin, Shaw; centers:
Radke, Carter; quarterbacks: Cold
iron, Bovet, McCormack; fullbacks:
Patton, Hickingbotham, Parker, Gro
ver; left halves: Reade, Wilson, Har
rington; right halves: Walker, Spar
ling.

Returns to Practice
A cause for cheer in the Papoose
camp was the return to practice of
Chet Patton, long absent fullback.
If he can learn the signals in time,
Chet may see action in the Bruin
battle.
Whether or not the presence of
Frank Alustiza, assistant coach and
past master of the art of quick
kicking, had anything to do with the
sudden talent acquired by Rod Par
ker for booting the ball with light
ning-like rapidity from a couple of
yards behind scrimmage is not
known, but the fact remains that
young Rod has become a definite
threat in the role of rapid fire punter.
Wilson's Back Bruised
Harold (Bunny) Wilson was in
jured in yesterday's practice and
suffered a recurrence of an old
back ailment. Norman Juney had a
little trouble with his ankle, but is
expected to have the damaged mem
ber in shape before Saturday.
The practice was largely devoted
to defense against U.C.L.A. plays,
with the second-string pretending
to be the baby Bruins.
The following players have been
selected to make the trip south for
the U.C.L.A. frosh game: ends: Gal
lerneau, Willard, Peers, Greer,
Grant, Almy; tackles: Anderson,
Lewis, Young, Durckel, deMailly;
giiards: Damarus, Juney, Delauer,
McCulloch, Bardin, Shaw; centers:
Radke, Carter; quarterbacks: Cold
iron, Bovet, McCormack; fullbacks:
Patton, Hickingbotham, Parker, Gro
ver; left halves: Reade, Wilson, Har
rington; right halves: Walker, Spar
ling.
The first thing apparent to a visi
tor at freshman football practice is
the manner in which the lineup is
constantly juggled. There are few
positions which are the private prop
erty of any one individual on the
Stanford frosh grid squad.
For instance, the guard spot was
alternately occupied by Stockton
Shaw, Ernie Damarus, Gordie Mc-
Culloch, and Dick DeLauer. Center
also found several contenders put
ting in their bid for first-string
fame. Pat Nowell, Frank Carter,
and Ted deMailly were taking turns
filling the ball-snapping post while
Hugh Radke, regular center, watched
from the sidelines. Radke is ex
pected to play against U.C.L.A.,
however.
