Unlooked-for competition from
the soph-frosh mud-slingers wrought
havoc on intramural football yes- j
terday afternoon, forcing cancella
tion of three of the originally sched
uled games, and resulting in a for
feiting of an additional two, leaving
but one contest to be played.
In the day's lone clash, the Phi
Delts didn't encounter a great deal
of trouble in squelching Delta Upsi
lon, 20-0, while Phi Sigma Kappa
and Los Arcos won a brace of for
feit victories over Branner II and
Encina IE respectively.
The Phi Delt triumph was fea
tured by Dey's pass to Dillon on a
play that netted 70 yards and a
toucfidown for the winners.
Paine and O'Brien also played
good ball for the Phi Delts.
