The Mud Fight does not live on.
Ex Committee last night decided that in view
of the feeble turnout for yesterday's fracas,
that the Mud Fight be officially abolished for
the future.
BUT the Ex Committee's official action did not
kill the Mud Fight. The opposition of the health
service did not kill the Mud Fight. The oppo
sition of The Daily did not kill it.
The Mud Fight died because of lack of stu
dent interest, which is the one thing that can kill
anything, and has sometimes almost killed The
Daily.
Mr. Eaton, who writes in the Campus Opinion
today, probably will point the accusing finger
at me, for my "sneering sarcasm," saying that
my "unsportsmanlike" attitude had something
to do with it.
However, it would seem that "sneering sar
casm" and unsportsmanlike conduct is more
likely to have a retroactive effect on the sneerer,
by arousing resentment against him and a re
doubling of efforts to prove him wrong.
The purpose of yesterday morning's edit was
not to kill the Mud Fight, nor to thwart the pur
pose of the 600-odd stalwarts who voted to have
it continued. It was only to point out to the
student that the sole justification for having the
Mud Fight was the fun involved. If there was
any altruistic purpose for having it, it has not
been brought forward.
The logic was that if the student did not get
fun out of it there was no point in his attending.
The attempt was to keep out of the fight stu
dents who had no business being there,
students who thought that there was some com
pulsion for them to fight.
I do not think Mr. Eaton feels there should be
compulsion, or if he does, I cannot agree with
him on his interpretation of the word "democ
racy."
As far as being an embryonic Hearst, I do
not quite appreciate the flattery. As it happens,
the reporter who wrote the article had no in
structions to do anything but write a news
story. If he chose to "color" it on the assump
lion that it would flatter the editor by reflecting
his views, that was an example of his own poor
iaste. I do not have time, what with sharpening
my pencil, and looking out the window, and
writing editorials, to personally supervise what
goes on in the news room. That is fortunate,
f I did, the articles probably would be more
poorly written, what with sharpening pencils
and looking out of windows.
How seriously we should take a vote of 600
out of 4,000 students is quite open to question.
7 Jot open to question is the fact that not enough
students were interested to turn out for it.
The Mud Fight is dead. It has been dead for
some time. We were all a bit tardy in recog
nizing it, that is all.
