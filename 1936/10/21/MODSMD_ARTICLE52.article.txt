# Mr. Roth is Reasonable

Last spring, Editor Browne printed in The
Daily a short editorial blast on campus roads
which ran: "The bend of Palm Drive near the
Chem building is a rolling, pitching, tossing
:;eries of geo-synclinal flexures. Portola Street
is a poc-marked, stuttering, jittery, amorphous
mass. Lasuen is an inverted soup bowl, which
drains water and automobiles into the gutter
with egual efficiency."
Much to The Daily's surprise, road work was
.started a few days ago on the Chem Building
) oiler coaster, and the Portola Street run-around
was fixed this summer.
Now the editorial staff of The Daily is the
last one to ever mess with the laws of cause and
effect, and we are the next to last to even inti
mate that Daily edits have any effect other than
in the campus opinion column (for which see
Mr. Eaton's offering this morning).
This, only, is certain there was a definite time
•.orrelation between the shoveling out of an edit
.jnd the shoveling up of a road.
We know very well that Comptroller Almon
E. Roth knows more about his business than we

do. We oftentimes think that he knows more
about our business than we do.
We drop in and see him every once in a while
and ask him to do things for the student good,
only to find that he's been planning for 10 years
to do that thing as soon as he can fit it in the
budget.
It is a comforting thing to realize, though, that
when there is a budget that can be argued with,
Mr. Roth knows enough about our business of
being something of a sounding board of student
opinion to consider our offerings, and after
some of the budgets are made out, Daily editors
may point with pride to time correlations.
