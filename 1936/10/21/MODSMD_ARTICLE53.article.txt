It is reasonably sure that the gateman at the
University crossing does not read the Daily, and
it is also reasonably sure that if he did read part
of the Daily, he would not read the editorial
columns.
But notwithstanding the fact that the 'surly
gateman' probably did not read last week's
edit about his passive resistance to raising the
gates while trains are parked at the station, he
seems to respond to the cry and is now lifting
the bars during the train's stop.
Perhaps it was psychical, or perhaps it was
the grumblings of the crowd at the bottom of his
stronghold that turned the tide of the man. But
no matter what, action has correlated with an
other Daily editorial.
