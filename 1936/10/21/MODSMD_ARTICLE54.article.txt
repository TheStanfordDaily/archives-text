# BULL SESSION
## THEY'RE AT EMILY'S POST

LARKSPUR, Oct. 20.—N0 matter on' what side of
the political house you sit, you can't help wondering
who's Alf's angel. Some say the Republicans are back
ing him. We haven't heard official denials, but it's
hardly possible that such a smart outfit as the G.O.P.
would continue to finance a distinct turkey.
More likely is it that Alf's backed by the Demo
crats, who are foolish enough to regard money well
spent that provides rotten competition for their own
star.

For Landon is definitely parked in pants too small
for him. As the campaign rattles into history, he's
realizing it's one thing to be Alf the Governor and
quite another to be Alf, the President.
While merely campaigning he finds himself ringed
round with political toes, each cursed with its bunion
of special interest, and all very difficult not to step
on.
Alf has found grace necessary to giving each special
interest group a whirl around the national ball room,
but it's particularly difficult in those hobnail boots Alf
wears. You can't hop with them, you can only crash.
And Alf has been crashing while that Hyde Park
dude, Franklin, in his patent-leathers, hasn't bumped a
bunion yet—nor drooled on a pinafore.
He's politics' Little Lord Fauntleroy. antithesis of
the plainsmen who still eat intellectual bear meat and
think international finance just an elaboration of his
penny iron pig bank.
Last month dear Franklin (old-fashioned Kansas
muzzle-loaders call him a sissy) participated in a very
swell Canadian shindig at Quebec. Impeccably, he ac
knowledged in French his host's welcome, given in
English. It was class—nothing short of terrific—for an
American. It was so neat that it looked easy enough
for Alf to do, although so easily done that it almost
seemed a waste of time for a president. That it had
an important effect on our foreign political relations
is obvious to anyone who knows the vaule of flattery
to the French.
Franklin knows from pre-natal training that the
butter plate is always to one's left. While managing a
recalcitrant piece of fried chicken, he can dish diplo
matic garbage with France's daintiest debt-cancellor.
For the Squire of Hyde Park is every inch the
gentleman—spelled with a capital G.
Alf may let his wife play the harp, but that only
indicates bum ears or good nerves. He probably isn't
being gentlemanly, just averagely forgiving.
