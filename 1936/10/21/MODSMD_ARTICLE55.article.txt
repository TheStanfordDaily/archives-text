Members of the landless proletariat who drive
Buicks, Chryslers, and Oldsmobiles have been particu
larly vehement lately in denouncing as a vulgar dis
play of wealth, the appearance of two Cords on the
campus this year.
I, personally, am inclined to believe that the wearing
of a bow tie on the Quad is far worse, but there is no
doubt about it; those who lived here 20 years ago
would be shocked to realize that this was the only way
Stanford would be wearing Cords in 1936.
It's an aesthetic question, of course. There are sev
eral functions of the automobile. One function is driv
ing. Another function is parking. And still a third is
the watch fob theory of value.
In other words, we give Phi Bete keys to Phi Betes
to show that they have amassed grade points. We
give debate keys to debaters to show that they have
amassed audiences. Block "S" awards to football men
to show that they have amassed. Now a Cord auto
mobile proves one thing, and that is, that your old man
has so interfered with the laws of supply and demand
that he can afford to let his son ride around in a
portable rock garden and green house. In a University
dedicated to challenging the challenges to liberty, this,
of course, is no matter for pride. In fact, it is rather a
symbol of shame and sorrow, to think that anyone's
father would interfere with simple economic laws.
A Cord, therefore, is more like widow's weeds, and none
of us should exhibit any signs of jealousy.
That the Deke house has taken a very sensible stand
on this may be a matter of pride. The Deke house un
derstands the watch fob theory of value and will have
none of it. The Deke house knows by experience about
such things. Long years ago when Herby Flcishhacker,
Jr., bone-crushed for the Stanford football team, lie had
many friends in the Deke house. And he always left
his Cord parked out in front. This had a resultant
deleterious effect on the Deke publicity, so the Dekes
arc now pretty wary about it.
When a certain dollars-to-doughnuts-in-three
generations scion who pledged Deke last year returned
to Stanford to take up his position as sophomore in the
Deke house, an upperclassman who plays football in
side and outside of the Deke house noticed that he
was driving a Cord. The upporclassnwn said: "No sir,
you can't leave that parked outside the Deke house."
So the dollars - to - doughnuts - in - three-generations
scion came back t«» school again, but this time with a
Ford, which rimes with Cord, but is something entirely
different.

I, personally, am inclined to believe that the wearing
of a bow tie on the Quad is far worse, but there is no
doubt about it; those who lived here 20 years ago
would be shocked to realize that this was the only way
Stanford would be wearing Cords in 1936.
It's an aesthetic question, of course. There are sev
eral functions of the automobile. One function is driv
ing. Another function is parking. And still a third is
the watch fob theory of value.
In other words, we give Phi Bete keys to Phi Betes
to show that they have amassed grade points. We
give debate keys to debaters to show that they have
amassed audiences. Block "S" awards to football men
to show that they have amassed. Now a Cord auto
mobile proves one thing, and that is, that your old man
has so interfered with the laws of supply and demand
that he can afford to let his son ride around in a
portable rock garden and green house. In a University
dedicated to challenging the challenges to liberty, this,
of course, is no matter for pride. In fact, it is rather a
symbol of shame and sorrow, to think that anyone's
father would interfere with simple economic laws.
A Cord, therefore, is more like widow's weeds, and none
of us should exhibit any signs of jealousy.
That the Deke house has taken a very sensible stand
on this may be a matter of pride. The Deke house un
derstands the watch fob theory of value and will have
none of it. The Deke house knows by experience about
such things. Long years ago when Herby Flcishhacker,
Jr., bone-crushed for the Stanford football team, lie had
many friends in the Deke house. And he always left
his Cord parked out in front. This had a resultant
deleterious effect on the Deke publicity, so the Dekes
arc now pretty wary about it.
When a certain dollars-to-doughnuts-in-three
generations scion who pledged Deke last year returned
to Stanford to take up his position as sophomore in the
Deke house, an upperclassman who plays football in
side and outside of the Deke house noticed that he
was driving a Cord. The upporclassnwn said: "No sir,
you can't leave that parked outside the Deke house."
So the dollars - to - doughnuts - in - three-generations
scion came back t«» school again, but this time with a
Ford, which rimes with Cord, but is something entirely
different.
Members of the landless proletariat who drive
Buicks, Chryslers, and Oldsmobiles have been particu
larly vehement lately in denouncing as a vulgar dis
play of wealth, the appearance of two Cords on the
campus this year.
