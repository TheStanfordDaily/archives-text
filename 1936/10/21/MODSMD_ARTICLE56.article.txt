George White's Scandals, at the
Curran Theater in San Francisco.
"Burlesque for the masses, the
Scandals for the upper classes" is
our motto for today. As spruce and
bedizened as George White's Scan
dals are, they still resemble nothing
more closely than their salty kins
man, the burlesque show. Jokes aie
only a little less thwacking, cho
ruses more, and more elegantly,
clothed.
Willie Howard, comedian-in-chief,
romps through the acts as Mussolini,
as a French professor, as Ponce de
Leon, with tireless rapidity, pounds
in every gag with a leer.
What makes the Scandals good en
tertainment despite its not uproari
ous "sketches" are Helen Morgan,
the Stanley twins, and a trio of col
ored dancers. Morgan's "I've Got
to Get Hot," lament of an ex-opexa
star turned torch singer "because
there's Cash in it, not because I'm
passionate," is lively and done with
a fine humor. A medley of "Bill,"
"My Man," and "Lost" brings back
her earlier tearful successes.
The Stanley twins' shadow dance
brought more than one encore, as
did Sam, Ted, and Ray, nimble dog
gers, impersonating Haile Selassie
and his army.
On the average of every ten or

fifteen minutes appear George
White's thirty comely "girls" to
swing, kick, sing. They are attired
throughout the evening in: (1) vari
ations of evening dresses, (2) bath
ing suits, (3) hats, (4) trig lace tux
edos, (5) hoop skirts, (6) gold cloth
overalls.
