## HER OWN BUSINESS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I address a letter to Bob Ei
senbach through you—please—Mr.
Eisenbach.
I must confess I am somewhat hurt
by your insinuation that I weigh
250 pounds or is that Mrs. Jones—
at any rate I am not a vulgar hussy—
and my clothes are my own business
—as to how much I have been
around that is my own business too
—or if you would like to make it
yours, I would like to suggest that if
you have not been around—you stay
away from yours truly. I don't feel
that an Eisenbach would be safe
with anyone who had been around.
Still if you would like to try—and
will go into training for three weeks
—I will at least find out what you
look like and how much money you
have.
In the meantime may I suggest
that you stay off of the Paly street*
if fast driving makes you nervous—
and off the sidewalks if it doesn't.
—Speedburner
