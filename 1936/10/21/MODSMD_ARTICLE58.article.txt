# A 						PROPOSITION

The Editor, Sir:
The article "Upperclassmen Dance
While Frosh Gripe at Roble Jolly-
Up," appearing in Friday's Daily,
presented a picture of cruelty ex
ercised at btantord that is a grim
reality.
My solution to the problem is this:
Be it understood that all outstanding
farmers of this University, namely,
all those that hold elective offices or
belong to service clubs, will as
semble at jolly-ups, during the first
half of which their number shall
comprise the sole stag-line. (During
this period they will be afforded the
opportunity of more time with the
more popular girls than any of the
other fellows will get after the all-
University stag-line enters and be
sides, it will be less crowded.)
When the all-U line is admitted at
7:30, these fellows will excuse them
selves from their partners with
statements to the effect that they
have "official duties" to perform. It
is assumed that the "twice-picked"
girls that they abandon will imme
diately be taken by the stag line.
Then the hostess will, as a matter of
course, introduce the girls that arc
left to our heroes who will devote
the next half-hour to showing these
girls the best time that they can. It
will be easy for them to exchange
partners, knowing each other and
the situation and in that they "show
thei rpartners off" to better advan
tage than lesser roughs. It is not
altogether unlikely that they will be
cut in on. If these fellows like
jolly-ups, they should have as good
a time as anybody; if they don't,
couldn't they feel it their duty to
give half an hour of their time to
welcoming our new students?
Sincerely yours,
