The Editor, Sir:
In seven years upon this campus
I have seen few greater examples of
poor sportsmanship in losing than
that presented by your comments in

Tuesday's Daily regarding the Mud
Fight. Not content wtih reasoned
opposition to that institution prior
to the election, you have throughout
adopted a tone of sneeving sarcasm
which, regardless of the issue in
volved, is as disagreeable in print
as it would be in conversation.
The climax is reached, however,
by today's remarks. A decent re
gard for the democratic process
should make clear (he impropriety
of a general student newspaper
urging, and continuing to urge, the
boycott of something the student
body had within the week voted
overwhelmingly to sustain. You
have not only done this in your
editorial, but have gone farther, and
have even colored a front page news
item with your views. Hearst him
self could do no worse.
A general comment may also be
relevant. Far too often in recent
years Daily editors have regarded
a bucket of cold water as their chief
weapon and stock in trade. An edi
tor may not share frosh enthusiasms
—indeed, probably would not—but
at least a tolerant '"Go out and play,
children, and have a good time"
attitude is not too much to expect.
Youthful enthusiasm and loyalties
will die of temselves soon enough,
as a world full ot bored and selfish
people testifies. To kill off these
qualities prematurely is both un
kind and impolitic and entirely un
worthy of a person like the editor
to whom the frosh look with some
degree of respect. The seat of the
scornful is not becoming to public
figures nor to Daily editors.
Yours very truly, ,
—Richmond Behrens Eaton
