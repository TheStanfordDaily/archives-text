### BILL MOSES 
Forming part of tomorrow night's
large pep barrage in the Pavilion to
wipe out the oncoming Trojan horde
are big guns Coach Tiny Thornhill,
Bobby Grayson, and Jim Reynolds,
A.S.S.U. president, who will intro
duce the guest speaker, Don Thomp
son, well known radio announcer of
last year's football games played in
the Pacific Coast Conference.
Representing Southern California's
rooters will be Norm Johnson, S.C.'s
student body president.
According to Sandy Lowengart
and Jan North, co-chairmen of the
S.C. Rally Committee, Stanford root
ers attending this all campus func
tion will see a big surprise stunt
which is part of the evening's enter
tainment.
Vision Unveiled
Rumors have been going around
the campus to the effect that Lowen
part, North, and Pat Bosqui, Roble
representative on the Tryout Com
mittee, have "conjured up a vision"
and have been working in secret on
this surprise stunt.
Rooters Assemble
Thursday night at 7:15 is the time
set for all Stanford rooters to as
semble at the Fiji house for the
frosh Pajamarino down the Row.
The torchlight parade will be led by
the Stanford Swingsters, sometimes
known as the Stanford Band, and
the time-honored Model T fire en
gine. Actual marching order of the
freshmen will be supervised by the
yell leaders, who will see that seats
are found for the Class of '40 on the
floor of the Basketball Pavilionâ€”a
Stanford Pajamarino tradition.
Roble Serenade
After the speeches have been
given, the yells sent upward, the mu
sic played, and the surprise stunt un
veiled, the frosh men will have their
own torchlight parade up to Roble
for the annual Roble serenade.
