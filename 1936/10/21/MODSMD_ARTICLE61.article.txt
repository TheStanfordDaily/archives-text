DID YOU HEAR 13-year-old Jean
Dante's interpretation of Juliet on
the Magic Key broadcast Sunday?
It struck me she was the best I've
ever heard. Must actresses play the
character far older and more under
standing than she was. After all, the
real Juliet was only 14. The char
acters Shakespeare created were just
a couple of crazy youngsters roman
tically in love, who, when they were
caught up in a tragedy too great for
them, rose to the occasion like the
thoroughbreds they were.
There's too much ''reverence for
the immortal bard" in most inter
pretations. What the hell! It's just
a nice, romantic tale about a couple
of kids that met up with some tough
luck. Why not play it that way?
And that's what I liked about Miss
Dante. She did play it that way.
She didn't hesitate to be just a little
coy (but in an unsophisticated way),
to giggle a little, and to play it im
pulsively, romantically, youthfully.
Three cheers for a sensible inter
pretation of Juliet!
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. Mr. Ripley,
but A. Piana works for the National
Broadcasting Co. Pie, she, or it, as
the case may be, is supervisor of
audience mail in New York.
