# Permanents Must Be Smooth, Natural
## 
### 
Smooth, even, natural - looking
permanents rule the hair waves. A
permanent isn't just a permanent
anj( longer . . . and neither is hair
trimming just a plain cut. Hair is
trimmed to follow the contours of
the head, or is cut in a way that is
most becoming to the individual.
Oil treatments are generally given
before permanents, to make the re
sults soft and natural-looking.
The new fall toppers show off
coiffures beautifully. Hair is swept
back off the face in a youthful way
. . . waves are swirled and cleverly
set . . . and ringlets are curled up
high on heads. Hairdressers have
done their utmost in perfecting per
sonality hair coiffures.
