# Bat-Wing Bows Are Advocated By Campus Men
## 
### 
Bat-wing bows, introduced cas
ually by Esquire last spring, have
finally found a sprinkling of advo
cates on the Stanford campus.
Still more or less relegated to
motor-cops and street-car conduc
tors, bow ties have only been taken
up by the smoothest of smoothies.
But butterflies—the upset hour-glass
type—are definitely out. The long,
lean bat-wings are the only thing,
if any, now worn.
Broad diagonal stripes or bright
polkadots to contrast with goo-goo
sport-coats are the styles, fashioned
from rib silk.
If you want to be on the safe side,
unless you have a thin emaciated
face, wear the same old things.
