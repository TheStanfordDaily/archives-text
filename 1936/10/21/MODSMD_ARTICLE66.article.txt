# Bright Colors Run Dark Close Fashion Second
## Stanford Women Make Bright Rainbow Their Autumn Fashionplate 
### 
Fashion has a colorful story to tell,
and much of its success is due to the
fact that black has risen in popu
larity this season. Of course, black
has always been smart; but it has
never reached such fashion heights
as it has in the last few monthsâ€”
and it promises to continue even
more strongly.
Back to Color
Every smart woman will have her
first Fall dress in black, but she'll
follow through with plenty of color.
There are bright shades high-light
ing basic costumes of raisin brown
spruce green, gray, wine reds, rust
shades, and a considerable amount of
sapphire blue. There will be big
doses of color in gloves, handbags,
flowers, belts, scarfs, and shoes, a
new vogue.
There was a time when a coat was
either black or brown, but not in
this day of flying colors Color should
be the first consideration in the se
lection of a new fall coat, boxwood
green, brazilian, tudor blue, key
stone gray, and beet root are just a
few of the shades you can choose for
a fur-trimmed coat. They will be the
favorites for the football season, for
campus wear, and for the first fall
days in town.
Coats Also Colorful
Sports coats are not to be outdone
and run a very close second in the
march on color in sweepstakes green,
chinook, flame, peacock blue, Italian
wine, and wool brown. Should you
still have a failing for black, put it
in a dress coat, but let your sports
coats be colorful.
Gloved hands will also sparkle
with color. Even very conservative
women are switching to high shades
of Araby green, oxblood, London
tan, and chaudron, which are be
coming more important in the fash
ion picture every day. A new sur
prise is auberigne, a smart eggplant
shade, which is scheduled to strike
a high note in smartness.
Everything Colored
To create a colorful duet, fashion
swings to matched handbags and
gloves, which can be found in al
most every shop. These put a brand
new front on practically any cos
tume.
With the vogue for suits still on, it
goes without saying that there must
be plenty of blouses, especially col
ored ones. Of course, every ward
robe demands at least one white
blouse, but there's no getting away
from the irresistible colored blouses,
this season at least. Ascot and tri
angle scarfs in high shades and bold
prints also lend a gay note to new
suits.
