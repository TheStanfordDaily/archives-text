# Hemphill Is New Council Member
## 
### 
With technical questions of pref
erential vote counting settled, elec
tion committee last Sunday declared
Jean Hemphill winner of the vacant
post on the Women's Council.
The committee's difficulty arose
because neither of the top two can
didates had a majority of the total
votes cast even with second and
third choices added. It was finally
decided that such majority was not
required by the A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion.
In the tabulation below, the first
column gives the first choice votes of
each candidate, the second column,
the second choice votes.
Hemphill 74 128
Parker 74 125
Goodhart 47
Butts 37
Loveland 29
