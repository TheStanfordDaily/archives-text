# Trend Is Toward Colored Shirts
## 
### 
Present day collegiate shirt trends
are toward color and even more
color. Most Palo Alto stores are run
ning much more to colored shirts
than ever before. In men's shops
colored shirts are even outselling ihe
conventional white; however, the
usual percentage is three white to
one colox-ed.
The style of shirt that is selling
best at present is the button-down
collar. A sporty style that is doing
well in one local store is the Oxford
Tweed. In white shirts the plain
collar is doing best, with broadcloth
being the most widely used material.
The most prevailing collar style is
the wide space Kent.
Anita Louise likes to 101 l in hot
water; Carole Lombard prefers a
brisk towel rub; Ann Sothern keeps
a cosmetic tray at the tub; and Irene
Dunne likes French scents.
