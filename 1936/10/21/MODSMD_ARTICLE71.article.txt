# Swagger, Camel's Hair Sport Coats Smartest for Fall
## Fabrics Show Diagonal Weaves; Colors Are Red, Green, Brown 
### 
Trimmed and untrimmed sports |
coats remain true to fashion and are |
smarter than ever. Fitted untrimmed
coats, from Schiaparelli, have huge
lapels and pocket flaps that stick out
over hips and make waists smaller.
Many feature row upon row of
stitching, to bring out their trim
lines. Ihey are generally belted and
exaggerated shoulder width is
achieved through tucks.
The boxy coat is identified by its
new, square hang, and some have
epaulet shoulders. Classic camel's
hair coats are again the darling of
fashion, and are offered in balmacaan
and belted styles. It goes without
saying that they are the backbone of
the college, as well as the business
world.
Fur-Trimmed Swaggers
Look for fur-trimmed swagger
coats! These are really something to
talk about! Besides the regular swag
ger types, there's the tuxedo revered
free-swinging swagger coat.
Ripple or notched collars are smart
for this type of coat, because they
may be buttoned high to the neck
line. Swaggers are cut roomy and
straight and many are stitched to
bring out their straight lines. Ver
tical slash pockets are new. Collars
are played up, and, remember, the
more fur they sport, the better.
New Woolen Weaves
Coating fabrics show preference
for diagonal weaves, smooth, suede
like materials, mohairs, duvetyn and
velours. Among the diagonal weaves
are nubbed yarns and pebbly effects
on smoother grounds.
.Velours include ribbed, as well as
smooth fabrics. Black, of course, is
the - stand-by for dress coats; but
there will also be plenty of color
seen. Spruce Greens, Raisin Browns
and Wine Reds are just a few of the
new shades for Fall. Sports coats
go decidedly gay in bright checks,
| plaids and tweedy woolens.
