# Hosiery Assumes New Flying Colors
## 
### 
The flying colors of the fall hosiery
j are named after autumn leaves,
and some are identified with Roman
names. Pottery rust should be worn
with the new blue shades this year,
and Pepper Pot is very smart with
: the coppery and chaudron tones.
For gray and the darker greens,
Copper Kettle is considered correct.
The colors of the autumn leaves go
best with the lighter and brighter
colors of the earlier fall. Rosewood,
a spicy beige, blends well with
browns and greens, while Beech
wood, a russet tone, is grand with
I chaudron blue, and black. Praline,
a new candy color, is particularly
recommended for warm browns and
I dark greens.
