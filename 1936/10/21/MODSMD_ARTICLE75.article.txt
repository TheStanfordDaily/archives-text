# Smart Women Hail Suit Trend For Fall Season
## Velvet Dressmaker Suits Chic Daytime Wear; Braid, Stitching Good 
### 
The future for suits is bigger than
its past. It is hard to imagine what
smart women did before suits be
came such a big thing in fashion . . .
and it is harder still to imagine what
they would do without them.
The fashion world has turned suit
minded and comes through with a
grand collection for fall. There are
jacket suits, dressmaker suits, tunic
suits, and three-piece suits with and
without fur trim.
Sports Suits Foremost
Two-piece sports suits are due for
another excellent season. There are
single and double-breasted styles,
both of which are smart; but youth
swings to the former. Skirts are slim
and feature the popular kick pleat,
placed at either center front or side.
Some skirts take their smartness
from slits.
Shoulders are a trifle squared and
jackets are well fitted at waistline.
Action back and straight-fitted backs
still shine in the fashion spot-light,
and the vent slit at the back of jack
ets is decidedly new and smart.
Formal Suits Are News
Dressmaker suits are extremely
chic for formal daytime wear and are
developed in velvet, broadcloth and
velveteen. Generally seen in black;
their smartness lies in their cut.
Cordings, braid treatment, and
stitchings are generally the only
trim.
They sometimes follow the peplum
silhouette via gadgets or tucks, and
shoot out in a perky flare at the
back. The tunic silhouette also steals
part of the suit show. This new line
really lends itself beautifully to the
formal afternoon suit story.
Il creates such a slenderizing line
that waists look infinitely small and
the hips very slim. Pencil slim skirts
are the rule for the tunic suit. Flat
furs are sometimes used as trim, al
though tunic suits cut a very smart
figure in themselves.
Wardrobe Suits
The three-piece suit is practically
a wardrobe in itself, because it has
triple appeal. The grandest thing
about them is that most of their
jackets are cut with the new, high
neck-line. Besides being decidedly
new and smart, this feature is very
practical, because for early fall, the
suit mr.y be worn without a blouse,
and take a bow as a two-piece dress.
Of course, it will still take nicely to
blouses.
Then, too, the coat can be worn
with other costumes, and there's a
grand chance of matching, contrast
ing, and scrambling the entire en
semble. Three-piece suits are of
fered in a choice of colors in topcoat
and suitâ€”for instance, a rust top
coat may be worn over a brown two
piece suit. Isn't that something?
The celebrated trio, red, white, and
blue are again popular in a jewelry
way. Three wooden bracelets line up
in this famous combination, together
with three glass rings.
