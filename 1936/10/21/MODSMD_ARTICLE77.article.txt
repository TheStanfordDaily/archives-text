# Belts, Pins Accent Fall Combinations
## 
### 
There's much more to buttons and
belts and clips than just something
to snap on and forget about! Some
times they lend the smartest note to
blouses, suits or frocks. They are
important notes to any costume and
should not be overlooked.
Belts of corded fabric are new and
make skirts more flattering when
worn with tuck-in blouses. They
may also be worn over-blouse fash
ion with sweaters, and are smart
with sports frocks. Thin belts of pig
skin, along with leather belts and
matching buttons, have also become
fashion-conscious, and are the thing
for sportswear. Wood and leather
combinations on pins and clips are
important. Crystal buckles add a
bright note to belts, and crystal clips
are not to be forgotten.
Fashion goes back on the gold
standard and favors gold triangle
clips that are extremely smart with
tailored blouses. Then, too, little
neckline bows of grosgrain ribbon
often lend just the right touch to
blouses and frocks.
