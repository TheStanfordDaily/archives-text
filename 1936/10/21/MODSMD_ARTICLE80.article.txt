# Hollywood Styles Set Fashion On Stanford Campus
## Sausage-roll Hairdress, Knitting Are Latest Fads With College Women 
### 
American women follow Holly
wood styles, not Paris styles.
The sausage-roll hairdress begun
by Norma Shearer in "Romeo and
Juliet" may be seen on one out of
ten feminine heads on the campus.
Last year's three-cornered scarfs
have been replaced by the large
square cow-boyish handkerchiefs.
On a hand-knit suit done in your
spare time with a belt to match you
can look like an Orry-Kelly cre
ation.
If you've seen "Ladies in Love"
you'll remember the evening veil
worn by Connie Bennett. You can
get them in a different shade for
every evening gown, and they are
much more flattering to the aver
age woman than the Paris bird-of
paradise feathers.
To dress up last winter's silk, get
orie of those enormous colored clips,
or a set of numeral buttons in silver
or gold. Little old-fashioned nose
gay buttons look marvelous on vel
vet, and you can get earrings and
bracelets to match.
Knitting at tennis matches and
Sonja Henie exhibitions is the latest
Hollywood fad that has reached the
campus. Take your needles and
yarn to the bull-sessions and you'll
have a skirt and blouse in no time.
Do it in one of the new off-colors
and get shoes to match.
