# 'Swing' Style Evidenced In Rhythmic Attire
## 
### 
Swing music has taken the coun
try by storm! Where there's swing,
there's rhythm .... and where there
is rhythm, there's grace .... which
is exactly where fashion comes in
and takes its share of applause for
swing styles! Swagger coats, jackets,
peplum frocks, boleros, tunics, and
evening clothes, as well, strike up
the band and sing the swing song!
This trend is given full play in the
flared skirt treatment in peplum
frocks .... and tunics certainly con
tribute their share, because they
strike a high note for rhythm afid
grace. Little boleros top smart frocks
and shoot out in back fullness.
Take a look at the new hats ....
even they swing high! They come
forward at a rakish angle, to show off
a swirl of pretty curls.
Hair coiffures have the swing fe
ver They are swirled around in
back and roll up into tiny, soft,
sculptured curls. Hair is brushed
back and swung up smoothly on top
of heads and curls are designed on
lines drawn up from forehead, ears
and back of the neck .... all in line
with the new hats that swing high.
Swagger coats have never been so
full and finger-tip baby stoaggers
and shorter length jackets are nat
urals for this fashion. They flare out
from the shoulders and cut smart,
swinging lines. Princess lines have
gone swing, too. Of course, they re
tain some of the pure classic original,
but add just a smart, new flare that
enhances rather than changes them.
How about handbags? There is noth
ing smarter than top handles . . . .
and they get right into the swing of
things!
The Greeks had a word for it!
Well, so has fashion .... "The Eve
ning Swingown"! Of course, it's long,
but that's not the secret of its swing
success! Frolicsome little basques

and peplums shoot out in back. Soft,
smooth, flowing lines, developed by
pleats or slightly gathered fullness
at the back of bodices, end in grace
fully flaring hemlines and dance to
swing music.

This trend is given full play in the
flared skirt treatment in peplum
frocks .... and tunics certainly con
tribute their share, because they
strike a high note for rhythm afid
grace. Little boleros top smart frocks
and shoot out in back fullness.
Take a look at the new hats ....
even they swing high! They come
forward at a rakish angle, to show off
a swirl of pretty curls.
Hair coiffures have the swing fe
ver They are swirled around in
back and roll up into tiny, soft,
sculptured curls. Hair is brushed
back and swung up smoothly on top
of heads and curls are designed on
lines drawn up from forehead, ears
and back of the neck .... all in line
with the new hats that swing high.
Swagger coats have never been so
full and finger-tip baby stoaggers
and shorter length jackets are nat
urals for this fashion. They flare out
from the shoulders and cut smart,
swinging lines. Princess lines have
gone swing, too. Of course, they re
tain some of the pure classic original,
but add just a smart, new flare that
enhances rather than changes them.
How about handbags? There is noth
ing smarter than top handles . . . .
and they get right into the swing of
things!
The Greeks had a word for it!
Well, so has fashion .... "The Eve
ning Swingown"! Of course, it's long,
but that's not the secret of its swing
success! Frolicsome little basques

and peplums shoot out in back. Soft,
smooth, flowing lines, developed by
pleats or slightly gathered fullness
at the back of bodices, end in grace
fully flaring hemlines and dance to
swing music.
