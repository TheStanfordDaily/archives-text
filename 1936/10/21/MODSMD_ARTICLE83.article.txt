## Princess Silhouette Is Popular Fall Style 
### 
Silhouette is the first considera
tion of the new fall fashions; and,
when it comes to coats, it is most
important. Fashion offers many dif
ferent styles to choose from, and
each one is as flattering as the next.
The modified princess coat, with a
gentle flare in the skirt, unbelted and
fitted through the waist section, is
typical of fall, 1936. Rated second
among coats that are going over big
this season, is the fitted silhouette
with moulded bodice, self belt and
straight skirt.
The Princess silhouette is defi
nitely a dress coat, and may be a
trifle extreme; but many of them are
modified, so they are very easy to
wear . . . and flattering to most fig
ures. The more extreme Princess
coats are worked out with two or
three bands of Persian, making a
border for a flared skirt.
This type of coat generally follows
through with Persian trim for the
collar and, in most cases, is belted.
The softer trend is the unbelted coat,
collared in long-haired fur. This
type of coat will be seen practically
everywhere on smart women, be
cause it goes without saying that it
can be worn for either dress or
sportswear.
Armholes are cut moderately deep,
with fullness in sleeves ending just
below elbow, and tapering to a
small cuff. Fur collars are huge,
lavish and, naturally, extremely
flattering.
