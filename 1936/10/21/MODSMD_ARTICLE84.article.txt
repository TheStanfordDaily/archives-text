# Stocking Shades To Remain Bronzy
## 
### 
Warm bronzy shades are the most
predominant in the new fall hosiery.
Lighter, clearer shades are the flat
tering trend, and coppery and rust
tones have been repeated because of
their past success.
Particular attention in creating
new hosiery shades this season to

their blending qualities with the
new color creations in costumes,
shoes, and accessories. Color charts
have been offered suggesting the
proper shades to be worn with basic
costume combinations. The smart
woman will find it necessary to note
these charts carefully.
The sensational success of black
has much to do with the big recep
tion given black suede shoes this
fall.
