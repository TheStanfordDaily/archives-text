### Bv EAIHI) LAIMIAM 
Campus critics in choosing the
best dressed man on the campus
.split over the question: the "Man Out
of Esquire" versus the "Cleaned-up
Stanford Rough."
Mainly for his cashmere sweaters
and gabardine slacks, T. M. McDan
iel, lally chairman, rated as a slight
favorite in a poll taken yesterday.
Running a close second was Mort
D'Evelyn, senior class president. The
typical costume of suede jacket,
cords, and a white shirt appealed to i
the D'Evelyn adherents as more in
line wilh tradition.
As one person put it: '"Of course,
the sweat shirt and jeans of the
Stanford Rough are out, but the sim
plicity in dress custom should be
carried on." Supporters of McDan
iel countered that men wearing
slacks and sweaters could hardily
be called overdressed.
Most of those who expressed an
opinion stressed suitability as a
large factor in their choices. The
brown ensemble in sweaters and
slacks of student prexy Jim Rey
nolds was called eminently appro
pi iate by a number.
In the Esquire classification, San
ford Lowengarth won high favor. '
Bill Moses, for his tricky bow ties,
took honorable mention.
