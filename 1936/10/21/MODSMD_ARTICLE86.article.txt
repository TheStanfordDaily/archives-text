# Stress Laid On Build-up Garments
## 
### 
Smartly groomed women this year
are those who puy careful heed to
foundation garments. It should be
noted that the chic appearance that
the American women are noted for
is due largely to the garments which
are build-ups to a perfect finish.
The smartest and most expertly
tailored frocks cannot be done jus
tice in an ill-corseted figure. And
the sleek, figure-revealing fashions
that are so smart this year require
correct girdling to give the youthful
figure control that is so necessary.
