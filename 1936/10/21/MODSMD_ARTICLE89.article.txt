# Three 'C's' Are Style Secret: Color, Comfort, and Chic

Looking at the new fall suits as i
1 they hang on their racks, very little
| if any change is noticeable. After
i all, the coats have buttons and the
pockets seem to be in the same place
.... the trousers each have two
legs .... where, then, is the new
ness'.' What is there that's any dif
ferent about the suits for Fall of
1936?
While the suits are on their hang
ers you may be able to sense some
of that newness through the new
patterns and new colors. But, as
soon as you try a suit on, or see
some one else wearing one, it's a
different story entirely!
There's a sense of casual ease, not
bagginess, understand, but real com
fort in every line! And nowhere is
this more pronounced than in the
double breasted suit, the model that
is accounting for more than half of
all sales.
This new double breasted is a i
semi-drape model. Not the old drape
with its unsightly bulges, but a drape
ol entirely new design. The collar
line, for one thing, is lower and re
veals more of the shirt collar.

The lapels art* slightly wider and
the chest is fuller. The buttons are
placed lower and t-here is a. soft
"break" at the waist. The jacket it,
slightly longer. It has been so tail
ored that the lapels can be worn
either buttoned at the lower button,
or not. as you prefer.
Now. all this may sound like dry
details that concern no one except
a tailor. But, you'll be surprised at
the difference these things do make
in your appearance as well as in
your comfort.
The reason we have gone into such
detail to describe this suit is because
these designing principles have been
applied to nearly all of the new fall
suits. Single breasteds, sporls backs,
all, you will find, ace tailored for
ease and comfort.
Nothing "Fancy"
From all that has been said re
garding style designing you may
have received the impression that
new suits are "fancy" affairs. On the
contrary .... they're plainer! The
changes that have been mentioned
allow the suits to drape according to
the natural lines of your body.
