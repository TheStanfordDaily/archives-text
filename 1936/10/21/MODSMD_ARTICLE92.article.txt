makes it more difficult to create an
attractive coiffure which will look
well during rough treatment.

Edward stated:
"The youth and freshness of the
co-ed are best set off by simplicity.
"Except for special occasions. I find
that the practical hairstyle with a
dash of sophistication to bring out
the individuality of the girl is best."

speaking the trend in campus hair
styling is off the face in a clean-cut
severity. Irregular curls in several
different .sizes and shapes comple
ment. the plain front and add that
necessary touch of softness.

| "the Stanford woman wants simple
: lines in good taste, and individually
I adapted."
