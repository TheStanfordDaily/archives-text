# Mud-Fighters Invent Novel Type of Dress
## Varied Attire Featured By Sophs, Yearlings; Mud Packs Popular 
### Walt Peterson 
Fashions experienced a sinking
sensation yesterday, and although
there wasn't much mystery about it
participants are still clearing up a
rather dark situation.
The frosh and the soph men got
together yesterday in a special ad
vance showing of "fall" fashions on
the frosh football field, as the annual
Mud Fight brought out mainly styles
featuring the durability principle.
There was, it is reported, consider
able rivalry and underhanded dirty
work between the '39-ers and the
'40-ers over the creations, with each
group trying to see how efficiently
they could do away with the op
ponents' fashion modes.
Laundry Bags Worn
More than one unique little doodad
featured a laundry bag as a basis
for creative influence, with slots for
the lower limbs and a belt with a
rustic touch, usually rope or some
other material renowned for strength
under adverse conditions.
The more dainty ventured out in
nothing more than swim trunks, but
these poor dears found a little later
in the afternoon that their attire was
hardly suitable for such an ener
getic afternoon. Several casualties in
the form of indelicate rips and tears
were reported in these more fragile
costumes.
Edges Reinforced
For those who liked neither the
laundry sacks nor the aqua toga,
a bit of denim in the shape of
shorts was considered very chic.
Sturdily riveted at the corners and
with turned edges to prevent play
ful ripping by the more hearty of
the engagees seemed to be the favor
ite method of reinforcement.
And then, of course, there were
those nasty old dirty cords that these
bad old ruffians on the campus in
sist on wearing, but they were not
quite so satisfactory as the other
modes on display. Those who had
the presence of mind to wear sub
stantial undergarments were much
better off in the final reckoning.
