# Tea-time Dresses Favor Simplicity
## 
### 
For Sunday teas, afternoon dresses
of velveteen and crepes and some
fine woolens are worn. Shoes have
higher heels and hots are a definite
requirement. Bags and gloves are
optional, but add a complete look
to the costume.
Black is the favorite color for this
type of costume, but a large number
ol brown, green, and new copper
tones are seen. Plainness is the
outstanding factor of afternoon
dresses, relying on the accessories
and richness of materials for the
style.
