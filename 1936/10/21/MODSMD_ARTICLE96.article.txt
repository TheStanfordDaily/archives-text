What are blouses being made of?
Rayon and spun rayon and wool
combinations are being featured for
sports blouses in vibrant football
colors. They strike a smart color
note with tweed suits and will be
favored for college. Combinations of
crepe and satin will be seen, the
satin usually being introduced in
appliques or in bandings on collar
and jabots. There can't be enough
said about fine details worked out in
tuck-ins, since they lend such a
smart touch. This handwork is usu
ally featured on frilly jabots and
collars.
Crepes and satins are offered in a
complete color range, and special
mention is made of rose beige, royal
blue, dusty pink, rust, green, white,
and the new aubergine shade. The
latter is a rich eggplant shade and
is also being exploited in handbags
and filoves.
