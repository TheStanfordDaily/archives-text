# FANCY PLEATS TABOO, BUT SPORTS-BACK STILL TOPS
## 
### 
Remember back about three sea
sons agoâ€”when the first sports back
suit appeared on the style horizon?
Of course you do! It was a style that
may be said to have had a functional
value! That is, the purpose of the
suit was to provide extra freedom
for moving about, for stretching and
twisting and bending. The first mod<?l
accomplished this with a minimum
of fuss and bother.
But, little by little ihe picture
changed. The sports back suit was
still designed for freedom, but it was
complicated by numerous fancy
pleats and tucks and g. dgets that,
in themselves, added nothing to the
purpose for which sports backs were
intended.
It seemed to be a wild race be
tween designers to find something
different without regard to how it
looked. Oh, naturally, a few of these
suns were really smart-looking, but
the majority of them were so ex
treme that predictions were freely
cast about that the sports back suit
would be gone in a few seasons.
Change flas Taken Place!
However, designers have checked
themselves in time. There never has
been any reason to consider sports
backs as a fad, as long as they ac
complished the primary purpose for
which they were intended. And now,
after having run the gauntlet, sports
backs are back to fundamentals.
Those many useless gadgets that
were placed on sports backs have
been almost entirely eliminated. In
cases where these pleats did serve a
useful purpose they have been re
tained. So that for Fall. 1230, three,
possibly four sports back models
stand out as being the real sports
backs.
The first of those is the,old free
swing, the suit that started it ajl.
This suit, you will remember, has
two deep bellows pleats under the
arms and extending from the shoul
ders to the waist A stitched-on belt
at (he waist gives it a semblance of
form-fit, although there isn't even a
suggestion of tightness anywhere
about this model. This one particular
suit has come back strong. During
the period of experimentation that
has passed mr ny things were learned
about it. And these things, although
making no radical change in the ap
pearance of the suit, have made a
change in its fit and in its wear
ability.
A Variation
During the height of fancy pleats
and tucks it was only natural to ex
pect a reaction to set in. This reac
tion took place in a small way at
several of the eastern universities a
season or two back. A new sports
back appeared on ihe campus. It
was known as tl.e gusset suit, and it
can best be described as a modifica

j tion of the free-swing.
The under-arm, or bellows pleats,
under the shoulders at the back, ex
; tend downward only about eight or
j nine inches, instead of continuing to
I the waist. This suit was further
i glorified by two side vents at the
I bottom of the coat.
And this is the model that sounded
he death-knell of ultra-fancy backs,
j Men were quick to appreciate its
simple smartness and equally quick
1 to recognize the fact that this suit
did not curtail the freedom of the
; sports back.
So, for Fall, 1936. you'll see this
, model on equal terms of popularity
with the free-swing. Only instead of
! the two side vents, one center vent
1 is generally in greater favor.
Blouse Hack
And now we come to the blouse
; back suit. The first version of this
model had a stitched on belt and the
i basket above the waist was fuller.
Naturally when gathered at the waist
I it gave a shirred, or blouse effect.
Instead of gaining freedom through i
: the use of under-arm pleats, this!
suit gained freedom because of the
I extra material at the back. Then
things were added to it ... . tucks,
pleats, stitched pleats and whatnot.
The only two that have returned to
favor are the original blouse back in
all of its simplicity and the blouse
back with the inverted pleat down
; the center of the back. These two.
together with the gusset and free
swing will account for nearly all of
the sports backs that style-wise men
! will buy.
Panel Body
The only other sports back that
[ comes into prominence is the panel
j back. Although some men would
j consider this too fancy, it does serve
; a purpose and is especially popular
! with younger men. This suit has
panels, generally six of them, three
j on each side of the back.
These panels, or perhaps, box
; pleats would describe them better.
are flat and extend from the yoke
| at the shoulders to the waist. This
| suit gives freedom much the same
way as the blouse back, through ex
| tra fullness of the back instead of
I under arm pleats.
And with that you have the sports
I back story for Fall. All of these
I models mentioned are exceptionally j
1 popular in double breasteds as well
! as single breasteds. Although the
| double breasted is a more "dressy"
| style and really should never be con
| sidered as a sports back, it has grown

so in favor that it has forced recog
nition as a style suit. And it was the
double breasted more than anything
else that dictated the change to sim
plicity.
Extra Style Details
In spite of all we've said about the
return oi simplicity, we have also
said that where fancy details served
a functional purpose they were re
tained. This is irue of saddle-bag
pockets. Many < ; the models men
tioned may be had with these pock
ets that really can be loaded down
without pulling the coat out of
shape.
And there are the reasons why
sports back suits are no longer con
sidered a fad, why sports back suits
are beinrj seen more and more at
offices and for business wear.

Gray in younger girls' sweaters,
sweater frocks, snow suits and va
rious types ol dresses is smart. A
medium light gray with brightly
contrasted trimmings, red or blue,
is favored.
