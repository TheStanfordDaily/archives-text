# Stanford Coeds Choose Smart Quad Costumes
## Farm Women Noted For Appropriate Dress On Campus as Well as Off 
### 
Stanford coeds are noted for their
smart clothes, and their choice of
the appropriate for both general
campus wear and extra-curricular
activities. Seen on the campus this
week were:
Janet Nelson, Thcta, hurries
around the Quad in a clever green
velvet skirt and red plaid jacket.
A blue velveteen skirt topped by a
plaid wool jacket is the favorite
dressy Quad costume of Mary Lewis,
Delta Gamma.
Anne Barllctt, Alpha Phi, wears
a light tan suit with dark brown ac
cessories on warmer days.
A dubonnet zipper runs the full
length of a dusty blue wool dress
worn by Janice Fulton, Lagunita,
with dubonnet oxfords.
Women's Conference president,
Barbara Kimball, goes to classes in
a grey skirt with a dubonnet sweater
and pearls.
Pioble Sponsor Virginia Hawkcs
sets a good example in what to wear
on Quad by appearing in a grey
wool skirt with pleats front and
back. Over this she wears a white
cashmere sweater and pearls, top
ping it all with a green plaid jacket.
Helen Conklin, Alpha O, wears a
Chinese red wool dress with a huge
metal buckle on the belt.
Probably the most outstanding
coiffure on the campus is worn by
Carol Kundall, Chi Omega. Her hair
is of a clear red gold color, and she
wears it in a roll off the face in a
modified Juliet fashion,
Margaret Loud, Tri Delt, was
glimpsed on her way to the City in
a gray wool suit with wide lapels,
and a green ascot tie. With it she
was wearing grey accessories.
The Pan-Hellenic teas gave the
women a chance to wear their nicest
Quad clothes. These costumes were
particularly smart among those worn
by the hostesses:
Grctchen Ahlswede, Kappa, wore
a brown kitted suit, with a paisley
scarf in purple. Her belt was a
strong contrast in bright orange.
A yellow gold woolen dress with
a full skirt and a brown wool collar
was worn by Louise Moore, Gamma
Phi.
Ann Martincau, Pi Phi, looked
particularly smart Sunday afternoon
in a black crepe afternoon dress
with white accents.
