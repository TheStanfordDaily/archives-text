# Checks, Stripes Seen in New Fall Shirts
## 
### 
A brief summary of the shirt styles
for fall would go like this: more
stripes and more widely-spaced
stripes. Horizontal stripes to pro
duce new checked effects. A combi
nation of dark and light shade to
produce a new effect.
Stripes are big thing. And they
run through an entirely new pattern.
Broader spaced stripes are a natural
trend that started with the popular
British stripes of a few seasons back.
There is a definite switch away from
the deep tones that have captured
men's fancy during the past spring
and fail and the new trend is toward
light-dark effects, or in-between
tones.
Figures Good
Figured patterns that are high
style are those that are widely
spaced, as much as an inch, or more
apart. The extremely bold checks
have been toned down to smaller
ones that give an all-over effect.
Two more ideas worthy of men
tion are new gingham checks and
the new garnet stripes. The first
should make a hit because they go so
well with the new Glen Plaid suits.
The second is a style idea imported
from London and is being taken up
by the university crowd.
The tab collar and the tabless tab
collar, while still being sold, is ap
parently on the way out. The button
down, in regular collars, wider
spaced collars and a new longer
pointed collar will continue in pop
ularity.
A brand new one that is coming
up fast is the slotted collar that has
a novel celluloid strip under the
collar-band to hold collar points and
tie firmly in place.

A rep-woven broadcloth has ap
peared as a clever variation on regu
lar broadcloth. It will undoubtedly
become a style hit within a short
time. Oxfords and brushed twills,
because of the new patterns, will be
better than ever.
Chambrays and madrases will also
be good and these, too, because they
lend themselves well to new stripes
and mellow tone effects.
