## Contest Fails To Change Political Preferences Of Voting Listeners 
### 
Woolworth' well known nickel
and dime store in Paly came to the
aid of a pro-Roosevelt debater last
night. Upholding the affirmative
side of the question, "Resolved, that
Roosevelt should be re-elected,"
against a team from U.S.F., Jack
Craven of Stanford successfully
portrayed a skeleton, a hog, a brain
truster, and a jealous Republican
with the help of ten- and twenty
cent masks.
"The whole campaign has been
one big Hallowe'en party," stated
Craven as he began to display his
masks. "The Republicans have been
dumping garbage cans on the Demo
cratic doorsteps; cutting pumpkin
out of Fascism, making a skeleton in
the closet of the Supreme Court,
setting up bugaboos to becloud is
sues, and in general are behaving
like Hallowe'en pranksters."
Craven's partner in defending
Roosevelt at last night's debate in
the Little Theater was Ralph Stots
ky. The negative anti-Roosevelt
side was upheld by Jack Downs and
Gerald Cahill of U.S.F. Professor
Philip Buck of the political science
department was chairman for the
evening.
At the end of the debate when the
chairman asked for a show of hands
of those in the audience whose po
litical opinions had been changed by
the evening's speeches, not a hand
went up. According to the straw
vote taken after this, the audience
was evenly divided between Roose
velt and Landon supporters, with
one voter for Browder, the Com
munist candidate.
Both affirmative and negative
teams employed the conventional
arguments used by Republicans and
Democrats in the present campaign.
