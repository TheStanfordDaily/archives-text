# Women Enjoy Frosh-Soph Mud Brawl; Find Bulging Biceps 'Soul-Satisfying'
## 
### JANET GOULD 
Because wholesale dirt is "soul-1
satisfying" find bulging muscles al
ways appeal, over 100 women at
tended (lie mud light yesterday as
the crowd's most enthusiastic root
ers.
A few were disgusted, or admitted
their disgust for what they called
"the senseless brutality of it"; the
general consensus seemed to be that,
blood or not, nothing would keep
them away next year. Several sen
iors came to see if it was anything
like the Quad photographs and re
mained to applaud the display of
masculine muscle.
Contest Scored
Desires to see '40 win( to sec how
sporting the men were and if they
could take it, brought the greatest
number of women to the freshman
field. Sylvia Onesti loves to see dirty
men and Lorraine Williamson want
ed to "see a certain man get it in
the face." To many of them the sight
of flying mud was like breaking
windows, soul-satisfying in the ex

treme. Bobbie Rankin went for the
"bulging muscles."
Two old ladies, one a mother of a
freshman football man forbidden to
take part ("Thank goodness, because
it is so rough!"), liked it, said so.
Picking mud from her .ilecve. one
remarked, "It wasn't so Rood last
year. They are rather brutal,
though; just see those four ganging
up on that one; it would be more
interesting if it were single combat.
I sec that there are fewer sopho
mores than freshmen, perhaps be
cause they went through it last
year."
One junior scored the contest be
cause the men were "all so furiousâ€”
that makes it no longer anything but
a common brawl."
Rooting for '10
"I don't know why we like it so
much," Renee Holden remarked. "I
suppose it's the idea of men pitting
their strength or something, but it
seems more to me to be the custard
pie complex with a vengeance. It
was all I could do when I saw that

mud flying around not to dive in my
self and take a hand in the general
destruction. It's great!"
Commenting on the affair as an
outsider, not a representative of the
women or what their attitude should
be, Dean Mary Yost said, "I think it
a typically high-school performance
for college men. If the women enjoy
it, it's their own affair."
