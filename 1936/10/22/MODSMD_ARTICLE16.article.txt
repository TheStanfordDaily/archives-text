# Russia Ready To Send Aid For Madrid
## Soviet May Violate Pact Of Spanish Neutrality To Prevent Fascism 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 21 (/P).—Russia is
ready to bolt the Spanish neutrality
pact and send warplanes to the Ma
drid government, authoritative
sources said tonight.
With the fascist insurgents strik
ing ever closer to Madrid, these
sources said the Kremlin feels it
must send munitions and planes as
the only way to prevent establish
ment of another rightist dictatorship
similar to those in Italy and Ger
many.
Officials were agreed recent de
velopments growing out of the Span
ish war have created "the gravest
days in Europe in two decades."
Dictator Josef Stalin, informed
persons said, is convinced Europe
is nearing ihe abyss of another war,
and that Russia must make her in
fluence felt immediately and in the
strongest and most unmistakable
terms.
The Russian government will rec
ognize the incumbent Madrid gov
ernment under all future conditions
save resignation of the President
and Cabinet, it was said.
Spain has been told by his mili
tary observers that as few as 100
warplanes could turn the entire
trend of the Spanish civil war in
favor of the Madrid government.
Russia could make this number of
planes available almost immediately.
The major influence on the de
termination of the Kremlin to aid
Madrid, it was said, was the increas
ingly bitter German anti-Communist
campaign.
Hitler had plainly coveted the
Russian Ukraine during recent
speeches at the Nazi annual conven
tion at Numberg.
Added to these fears was appre
hension lest the Berlin conversations
between Premier Mussolini's For
eign Minister, Galeazzo Ciano, and
Hitler might presage a united Italo-
German stand against communism.
