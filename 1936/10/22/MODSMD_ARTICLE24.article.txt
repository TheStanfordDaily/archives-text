# Cardinals To Defend Four Year Win Streak Against Vengeful Trojan Outfit
## Davis May Ride Bench; Trojans To Work Out At San Jose on Friday 
### Herb Diamond 
Aroused to the pitch of muttering
wild imprecations and vowing to
avenge three defeats suffered by
Troy at the hands of Stanford in the
past three years, U.S.C.'s grid war
riors will entrain this evening at
8:45 o'clock and head for the Farm.
In accordance with the custom of
previous seasons, the Trojans plan
to arrive at San Jose at 8 o'clock to
morrow morning, go direct to the
Castlewood Country Club, and there
remain in seclusion until noon Sat
urday. Howard Jones will probably
send them through a light workout
tomorrow afternoon on the golf
course, but they will not be in Palo
Alto until just before they tussle
with the Indians.
A1 Wesson, Troy's public relations
representative, has at least partially
confirmed the news that Angie Pec
cianti, hard-driving fullback; Davy
Davis, brilliant quarter; and Dick
Berryman, reserve fullback, will
very probably be on the sidelines
Saturday, although the very thought
of it fills him with dismay.
Rambling Amby
If Davis' torn rib cartilages keep
him on the bench, Jones will rely
upon sophomore Amby Schindler,
who has just recovered from a pain
ful charley horse, to direct the at
tack for Troy. As a yearling last
year, spring practice, and even in
early season scrimmages this year,
Schindler was going great guns. In
recent games, however, his perform
ances have been only satisfactory,
not up to those of Davis.
As it stands now, Nick Pappas,
third-string quarter, is slated to
start, and so is Fullback Glen Gal
vin, a fourth - stringer. This fact
would seem to indicate that there are
mysterious and strange goings-on in
Jones's preparations. But such is
not the case.
Third Stringâ€”Yeah
There Is logic behind the selection
of these two men. When all the de
bris was cleared away at the end of
last Saturday's fracas against the
Cougars and the scoreboard still read
0-0, it was noted by statisticians that
Pappas gained all of 116 yards while
escorting the pigskin against the
Washingtonians 24 times. In short,
he made no less than 16 yards more
than the entire Cougar team piled
up all afternoon.
Galvin is a sophomore who played
end last year, and lately he has been
showing plenty of what it takes to
win Jones' favor. Glenn Thompson,
who looked pretty flashy last year,
seems to have lost whatever speed
he had this season, but he may be
given a chance at the quarterback
post Saturday. Reports have it that
he's a fair pass-tosser, a weighty
plunger, and he used to do very well
alternating between the quarter and
fullback posts.
Afraid of Passes
Jones of Troy held a secret work
| out at Los Angeles yesterday and the
utmost secrecy was supposed to have
prevailed. By some means, however, j
word leaked out that he is plenty
worried about Tiny Thornhill's re
cent concentration on passing. While
training his crew in plain and fancy
aerial defense, Jones voiced the 1
opinion that he would rather confer 1
with Tiny than bandy words on the
outcome of the melee.
The whole point is that Howard
does not want his passers rushed and
confused by the Cardinals. Tiny
pointed out that neither passers nor
anyone else was ever hurt intention
ally on the field, and also indicated
that he would be glad to discuss the
situation with the U.S.C. head man.
Davis Might Play
Rumors have persisted that Davis'
condition is rapidly improving and
that he may play. Spokesmen for .
Troy, however, point to a telegram
received from Dr. Packard Thurber,
team physician, and, at the risk of
seeming pessimistic, see little possi
bility of Davis' complete recovery
before the battle starts.
