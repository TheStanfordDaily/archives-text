F.R.'S BA1) BOY
As far as Roosevelt children go,
James Roosevelt is almost a model
son. He does not drive around in a
car like a bat out of hell just be
cause his papa is president, and no
cop would dare give him a ticket.
That makes him an outstanding
Roosevelt.
But just the same, he is still papa's
boy. He uses the same phony Har
vard accent that papa uses, and he
eevn says "my friends" in that glad
hand way that makes you know he
doesn't mean a word he says. In fact,
he sounds more like papa than papa
himself.
* * «
Only now he's been a bad boy.
But it wasn't Jimmy's fault. He
really didn't mean it at all. He was
so busy saying how much he loved
papa so everybody could hear him
that he opened his mouth too wide
and out popped something about
how daddy was aiming to bring the
NRA back to life again.
That was bad. Even daddy thought
so, for he knew that Mr. Landon
wouldn't like that. And sure enough,
Mr. Landon didn't. After all, Mr.
Landon loves liberty like he loves
his oil wells and even more does he
love the liberty of Americans to run
their businesses as they see fit, es
pecially when it comes to such mat
ters as wages and hours.

Mr. Roosevelt ought to do some
thing about his little boy James. Mr.
Landon has even taken time out in
his pilgrimage to save California for
Americanism to suggest that Mr.
Roosevelt wash son James' mouth
out with soap and water or spank
him hard and say that James just
loved his daddy not wisely, but too
well.
>.*< * *
Mr. Roosevelt ought to do some
thing about all the little Roosevelts
and see that they don't say things
he doesn't want them to. He had bet
ter watch his grandchildren espe
cially, for who knows, maybe by the
time Landon gets back East again he
will be asking the President to pub
licly repudiate what Sistie and
Buzzie have been saying about Lan
don's little boy Johnny.

papa so everybody could hear him
that he opened his mouth too wide
and out popped something about
how daddy was aiming to bring the
NRA back to life again.
That was bad. Even daddy thought
so, for he knew that Mr. Landon
wouldn't like that. And sure enough,
Mr. Landon didn't. After all, Mr.
Landon loves liberty like he loves
his oil wells and even more does he
love the liberty of Americans to run
their businesses as they see fit, es
pecially when it comes to such mat
ters as wages and hours.

Mr. Roosevelt ought to do some
thing about his little boy James. Mr.
Landon has even taken time out in
his pilgrimage to save California for
Americanism to suggest that Mr.
Roosevelt wash son James' mouth
out with soap and water or spank
him hard and say that James just
loved his daddy not wisely, but too
well.

Mr. Roosevelt ought to do some
thing about all the little Roosevelts
and see that they don't say things
he doesn't want them to. He had bet

F.R.'S BA1) BOY
As far as Roosevelt children go,
James Roosevelt is almost a model
son. He does not drive around in a
car like a bat out of hell just be
cause his papa is president, and no
cop would dare give him a ticket.
That makes him an outstanding
Roosevelt.
But just the same, he is still papa's
boy. He uses the same phony Har
vard accent that papa uses, and he
eevn says "my friends" in that glad
hand way that makes you know he
doesn't mean a word he says. In fact,
he sounds more like papa than papa
himself.
* * «
Only now he's been a bad boy.
But it wasn't Jimmy's fault. He
really didn't mean it at all. He was
so busy saying how much he loved
papa so everybody could hear him
that he opened his mouth too wide
and out popped something about
how daddy was aiming to bring the
NRA back to life again.
That was bad. Even daddy thought
so, for he knew that Mr. Landon
wouldn't like that. And sure enough,
Mr. Landon didn't. After all, Mr.
Landon loves liberty like he loves
