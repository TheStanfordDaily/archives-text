## MASS MEETING 
### 
The Editor, Six"
At a huge mass meeting of about
fifty freshmen yesterday, plans for
the mud fight were discussed. The
purpose of the meeting was to get
as many freshmen as possible out for
the affair. Said Joe Milligan, born
leader of the freshmen: "Fellas, we
want all you fellas to come out for
the mud fight. Now you don't have
to be scared, because all you fellas
who will get injured with bad
scratches and bruises can go over
and be fixed up by Dr. Storey. If
you don't get fixed up, these bad
scratches will be very harmful to
you later on, fellas. Now, fellas, I
present to you Chick Franich, who
is bbzzzzubb of the zubbbbbubbb.
Chick Franich, fellas!"
"There isn't much for us guys to
tell you guys, only we want you
guys to stop when you guys get
thrown by sophomore guys into a
pool, because if you don't you will
lose your hearing like one of the

guys did last year."
Then up stepped Joe Milligan, the
natural born leader, adjusting his tie
which he had left in his room. "Okay,
fellas."
And then this observer candidly
said, not too loudly, "Here's mud in
your eye!" I think that was the best
part of the meeting.
Briefly, that is how Messrs. Milli
gan (the born leader) and Franich
sold the freshmen on the idea. Sev
eral Eneina fellas and guys are dis
cussing the advisability of a daisy
picking contest next year, and the
freshman or sophomore who picks
the most daisies will receive a Lan
don sunflower from the Smithsonian
Institute.
