The Editor, Sir:
It is against iny better judgment to
come out of my shadows again, but
to be perfectly honest, I can't keep
quiet any longer.
To some of the members of the Ex
Committee, and to Mr. Fontius in
particular, I would like to point out
that only a third of the students
have cars, and according to Mrs.
Coverley, about one-third of the
cars that are here now will probably
go back to Mama and Papa as soon
as rushing is over.
The recent Daily survey showed
that the freshman and sophomore
classes combined have 326 cars for
1693 students. I think the Ex Com
mittee will grant that it is these
Lower Division students who want
and need a social outlet, and just
how they are going to go "flocking
down the highway" is a bit difficult
to understand.
Also, about 60 per cent of the stu
dents here are earning at least part
of their way through school. Stan
ford apparently takes the attitude
that if a student doesn't have the
money he doesn't deserve any social
recreation. This is the era of
change, and that's one attitude that
I'm all for changing.
Personally, I think that Mr. Fran
ich's idea of a cocktail lounge, minus
the cocktails, is a very good one.
Indirect lighting and soft chairs are
very conducive to a pleasant atmos
phere of relaxation.
Would there be any possibility of
enlarging the Cellar by making an

other room up where the parking lot
is now? Or putting the Union to the
use for which it was originally in
tended?
