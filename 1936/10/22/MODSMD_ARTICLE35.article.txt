## DAVIS BEST EVER: JONES OUGHTA KNOW 
### 
They now say with even more cer
tainty that Davis, Peccianti, and
Berryman will not play for U.S.C.
Saturday.
Davis and Berryman have torn rib
cartilages, while Peccianti has an
injured knee. They are all backfield
men.
Now these injuries, especially after
Howard Jones says that Davis is his
best quarterback ever, might seem
to indicate that Stanford is O.K.
grady for a win this time.
Davis has done about a third of
the Trojan offensive this season, and
that statement of Jones' takes in a
lot of quarterbacks, when you think
that Shaver, and Warburton, and
Drury, and Saunders, and Duffield,
and Mohler, and Kaer are included
on that order.
But wait a minute, you guys who
haven't stopped to think of Jones'
way of going about things. Nearly
always he starts a rugged slasher to
go the first quarter, and then dur
ing the second sends in a faster,
and craftier man. Look at how many
Trojan victories started with scores
in the second quarter. It's a good
way, when you have six or eight
equally good backs—wear the oppos
ing linemen and fullbacks down a
quarter, and then stick in a shifty
man that they will be just too tired
to catch.
