# PAPPAS STOOGES, SCHINDLER RAMBLES
## 
### 
So here you have it againâ€”old
Nick Pappas is going to start at
quarter, like he did a lot last year.
In the second quarter they throw
Schindler at us, and then, soldiers
beware!
Schindler is not a Warburton or
Grayson or Bradshaw type. He is a
big guy with strong calf muscles
(high jumps 6-2) and amazingly
high knee action. He is moderately
fast, as all backs are, but uses as
principal weapons a weave to either
side when tackled, or in some cases
just high knees.
If the Stanford line holds him,
Jones will shoot in Thompson, the
second quarter guy from last year,
who passes for a living. Lots of good
judges say that Thompson could be
an all-Atnerican if he pleased, but
that's where it ends; Thompson plays
good ball when and if he feels like
it, and has been pitiful this year.
The fullback spot, with Berryman
and Peccianti out, will be a little
worse off, but not bad. Coach Jones
has given Glen Galvin and Jimmy
Jones in there to work, but will
probably move in somebody else.
The U.S.C. fullbacks are usually
guys that did four years of ball car
rying in high school but didn't quite
make all-State doing it.
And then again the duties of the
position are very similar to those of
a Jones left half, or "inside back," so
easy calculation shows that you can
shift a guy from tailback to fullback
to inside back and back again with
the greatest of ease.
With Tiny's two weeks of work
and renovated play going against a
bunch of high Trojan footballers,
it'll be a game, seems to me.
