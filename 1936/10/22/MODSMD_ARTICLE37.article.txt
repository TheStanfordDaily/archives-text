# MUD FIGHT'S OUT HUT IT'LL BE BACK
## 
### 
In spite of anything the editor or
the Ex Committee says, the mud
fight yesterday was as good as any,
and had more than enough turnout
to call it worth while. So many
turned out that I couldn't see what
was happening; how about you?
Naw, they won't have another one,
not next year maybe, but it'll come
back, or something just as bad in
Doctor Storey's eyes. They voted the
bonfire away one rash Tuesday
evening. -
Some things, though, do show a
tendency toward pussy footing of
Stanford men:
Dink Templeton's track turnout
this year is the weakest he has
known — there aren't enough guys
out to have the regular Friday prac
tice meets. Anybody who can run
in a straight line could make the
team this year, he says, and the
better his lads show, the longer'll be
(heir trips next winter and spring.
Harry Wolter has a similar situa
tion only worse, if possible—there
are exactly six men out for frosh
baseball, three of them first base
men. In case any of you have for
gotten. it takes nine men to make a
baseball team, and major sport nu
merals are given for participation.
The Stanford band is the last pay
off—those guys who get in every
thing free and get a couple of swell
Irips per year are 15 men short of
their quota. Come on out, mugs, and
get a new suit!
