# Trojans Enter Water Polo Contest As Underdogs; Stanford Fights for Title
## 
### 
Flash—
University of Southern California's
terrible Trojans will enter the Stan
ford battle Saturday in the roles of
decided underdogs.
But it won't be on the gridiron; it
will be the Indian-Trojan water polo
clash in Encina Pool Saturday morn
ing at 11 o'clock.
The southerners have not won a
conference game in the last four
years, but little is known of this
year's team as Saturday's engage
ment will be their 1936 debut.
Nort Thornton's Cardinal varsity,
led by Captain Bob Haslacher in the
goal; Don Peterson, sturdy defensive
amphibian; and Johnny Lamb,
sharpshooting forward, will be the
heavy favorites to dunk the invading
aqua churners from the southland.
The Trojans will be led by Roger
Hatch in the sprint position, and Tom
Wilde at forward. Hatch is the Pa
cific Coast Conference, southern di
vision, champion in the 50-yai'd free
style, and if he can get the ball away
from the Card sprint with any degree
of regularity, it will make the going
tough for the Indian water dogs.
The Cards and the California
Bears are tied for the lead in the
conference with one win apiece, and
a defeat for the Cards will set them
in a rut which will be hard to get out
of in their comeback trail to regain
the conference championship.
