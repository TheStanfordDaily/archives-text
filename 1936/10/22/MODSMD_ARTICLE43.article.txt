# '40 Ready For U.C.L.A. Game
## Patton Returns to Line-up For Dummy Scrimmage 
### 
Dummy scrimmage was the bill of
fare yesterday at the frosh field as
the boys continued to polish their
offense for the U.C.L.A. game.
Chet Patton alternated with Rod
Parker as fullback on the first string.
Out of the line-up for three weeks
with an ankle injury, Patton now ap
pears sufficiently healed to see some
actiorj Saturday.
"Bunny" Wilson, who was carried
from the infield with a back bruise
Monday, was back in harness and
will play against U.C.L.A. Norman
Juney, regular first team guard,
watched practice from the sidelines
in civilian garb, and upon being
questioned modestly declined to
comment on whether or not he
would play against the Bruins.
The team checks out at 7:30 Fri
day night, accompanied by Head
Coach Harry Shipkey and his two
assistants on the freshman board of
strategy, Larry Rouble and Frank
Alustiza.
