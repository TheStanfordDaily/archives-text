# Seniors Decide To Drop Dues
## Officers Will Concentrate On Raising Endowment 
### 
No senior class dues will be col
lected this year, according to Presi
dent Mort D'Evelyn, although last
year's class assessed each member
$1.50.
The Class of '36 collected a total
of $750, but graduated with a balance
of $1200. "The fact that the Class of
'36 made a profit on their undertak
ings and the fact that our own bal
ance is $250 larger than that
of the senior class at this time last
year makes inadvisable the collec
tion of dues," said D'Evelyn.
Instead, class officers will concen
trate on raising a large sum for the
endowment fund. Last year's class
raised $500 by assessments, and
added this amount to their balance,
making a total of $1700.
Purpose of the endowment fund, as
originated by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds,
president of Stanford Associates, is
the idea of leaving something for the
University, and will form the basis of
the campaign.
Four temporary chairmen, one for
each living group, have been ap
pointed to assist in getting the cam
paign under way. They include
Adrienne Johnston, sororities; Es
ther Pelton, women's halls; Jeeb
Halaby, fraternities; and Don
Strauss, men's halls.
They will meet tonight after the
SG. rally with Mort D'Evelyn and
Jim Reynolds in the latter's office in
the Old Union.
