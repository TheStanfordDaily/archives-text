In less than two weeks Landon and Roose
velt will determine for everyone's satisfaction
just how accurate the Digest poll is. Until that
time, the campus has some interesting events
on tap.
Last night was the first of two debates be
tween Republicans and Democrats sponsored
by the Debate Council. Next Wednesday night
Dr. Wilbur will preside over the final debate,
with prominent local debaters from the Repub
lican and Democratic ranks taking apart "basic
issues."
Both the Young Republicans and the Young
Democrats are enticing voters with jolly-ups.
The Republicans are also throwing in their
Monday night radio debates. Campaign stick
ers and lapel buttons passed out around the
Quad seem to find the Landon sunflower in
the lead.
Without any thought of competing with the
Digest, The Daily is running a student poll of its
own next Thursday. On hand at the Law Steps,
Dave Allison and his Election Board hearties
will keep Eisenbach and W.B.M. away from the
stuffing box, will insure an accurate result with
standard A.S.S.U. election procedure.
Consensus of opinion is that Stanford stu
dents will go Republican. In the Roosevelt
landslide of last election, Stanfordites loyally
supported their distinguished alumnus by far
larger percentages than other universities. The
question is, will that percentage hold up?
Young Republicans feel that it will, because the
class background of Roosevelt hate will coun
terbalance the loss due to the fact that an alum
nus is not running. Young Democrats point to
campus polls showing that honor students favor
Roosevelt 9-4. And a poll taken of the football
""team showed Roosevelt in the lead 5-2.
But nobody knows exactly what this proves.
More interesting in some respects will be
the poll taken of faculty members by Pi Sigma
Alpha, honorary Political Science fraternity.
Results will be arranged according to age
groups and schools in the University. Students
are interested in finding what scientific objec
tivity will bring in the political line. Faculty
members probably are also.
But all of this preparatory excitement is
wasted on the Farm's citizenry if they don't fol
low the courage of their convictions and vote.
Political headquarters of both parties are now
rc minding registered voters in the student body
to send in for their absentee ballots to their
home registrar of voters before October 29. Ab
sentee ballots can be made out on the campus,
requiring only the signature of a notary public,
who charges no fee.
