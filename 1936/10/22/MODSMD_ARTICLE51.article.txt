There are plenty of reasons for screaming at
Ex Committee besides its action in dinging fu
ture Mud Fights. The Committee quite obvi
ously followed student democratic demand in
scheduling this year's Mud Fight.
E-x Committee didn't have to have a student
poll on it. They tried it out to see how it would
work.
The Mud Fight that was held plainly showed
that sophomores are not interested, that with
hashers and most athletes excluded as they are
by administrative action, the remainder of the
freshmen have a hard time putting up as much
enthusiasm for it as the newsreels expect.
Ex Committee recognized these facts, decided
that now was the time to ding it when those
fr-xts were recognized, and when there would
bo time to think of substitutes.
If any.
