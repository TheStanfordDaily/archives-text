# Even the Espee

If no one else has an opinion of the typical
Stanford student, it is certain that the Southern
Pacific has. Or perhaps it would be more ac
curate to say that our parent corporation is
fully cognizant of the well-lined pocket of the
Stanford student, as advertised.
At any rate, the fare for the U.C.L.A. special

train is $10.25 in contrast to the $9 rate offered
U.S.C. students for a trip to Stanford this week
end. But the key to the situation is that the ones
from U.S.C. will be riding tourist cars. While
the Espee says they can sell only first-class
pullmans to Stanford, cannot bargain at tourist
car rate.
Another stake in the heart of the rough.
