Mr. Masters is too damn reasonable.
Sub-marginal golfers have started a moan that
fees to play single rounds of golf are too high;
so The Daily immediately pounced upon the
subject for a new campaign. We would blast
the B.A.C. wide open for their robbery of poor
students who want to play a rich man's game.
We would talk to Masters and blast at him to
lower the green fees.
We went to talk to Mr. Masters.
And we came back to The Daily office, feeling
low because the golf course lost in hard cash
55.800 last year, not counting interest and de
preciation—and has lost up to as high as $10,000
in one year. Few people seem to realize that it
costs nearly $54,000 for yearly maintenance of
this golf course that ranks as one of, if not the
best, course on the coast.
Special rates for students have been offered
by the B.A.C. for a green fee scrip book. This
book, costing $17.50, is good for 25 rounds of
golf any time of the day or week. And in con
trast to student body cards, this scrip book is
transferable so that two or three once-a-week
golfers can get together on one book.
The golf course has no other source of earned
income other than individual green fees and
yearly memberships which run $90 a year. And
although a $1 green fee before four o'clock
seems rather high, there doesn't seem to be
very much that can be done about it.
