VANDIE'S BROKEN RECORD
Election year and midsummer are two periods when
no one wants to be in the radio business. At either
time the program managers of the national networks
contract serious disease—politicasis or sponsoritis.
Columbia has just taken to bed with probably the
worst case of politicasis in its history, on the heels of
a sponsoritis attack that ended only a few months ago
following contract-signings with commercial time
buyers.

A man named Vandenburg gave Columbia its pres
ent illness, characterized by static of the vertebrae and
overheated condenser. Vandenburg, famous as the
Republican who should have been nominated, started
the whole business with a campaign talk. He had Co
lumbia executives in an aspirin-eating dither by bill
ing his lecture as "a big surprise."
Now it is surprising when Republicans set around
to be surprising. It is, moreover, dangerous. For such
fireworks as a surprise in the hands of the Republican
campaign committee are about as safe as a pinwheel
in a kindergarten.

Columbia's aspirin-fortification was not amiss, for
what did Mr. Vandenburg want to do but use record
ings of Roosevelt's voice—something against Columbia
rulings.
Columbia said "no." The Republicans became con
fused. Columbia said. "Stop." The Republicans just
breathed harder. And then Columbia unlimbered a
straight left and walloped the master switch that put
Vandenburg and his recorded program off the air.

Automatically, the Republican National Committee
blew a fuse. Just why couldn't they use records? Co
lumbia had a long talk, explained that they didn't per
mit use of electrical transcriptions, just a network
rule, you know. And also hinted that the Republicans
knew about it all the time.
That would satisfy anyone who didn't have to swal
low their own surprise. So it didn't satisfy the G.O.P.
They made an awful noise and went screaming to the
Federal Communications Commission.
The rest will be easy. The F.R.C. won't be able to
do a Ihing except explain that the use of transcriptions
is prohibited by Columbia on C.B.S. network.
And the Republicans will attack the radio commis
sioners for suppressing free speech, make us wonder if
Roosevelt doesn't sound good because of unfair legal
advantage whether we're heading for a dictatorship—
if we ought to vote twice or three times for Landon.
—Eisenbach
