Since the matter of a golf course deficit has come
up, it might be timely to relate a little nifty about the
fact that spiritous liquids and money do mix.
For this we have no lesser authority than a member
of the Board of Trustees. The matter came up when
the Graduate Manager was explaining why the golf
clubhouse was losing money.
He said that other clubhouses made up their losses
by selling liquor, while the local one could not.
Dr. Storey interposed: "I don't see why that has any
thing to do with it."
At this, one of the younger members of the Board
(not a day over 50) who has a little money in his own
right, spoke out: ''Why of course it has, that has every
thing in the world to do with it."
This, fortunately or unfortunately, docs not prove
anything, however.
Last week-end the Alpha O's held a district conven
tion here. The Gamma Phi Betas held open house for
U.C.L.A. guests. A couple of the Gamma Phis from
U.C.L.A., not knowing these two facts, and not know
ing exactly which was the Gamma Phi house on the
campus, sauntered in to the Alpha O convention in
progress, discussed the weather, what a wonderful
thing the "bonds of sisterhood are, what a bunch of heels
the other sororities are, left without finding out they
were talking to Alpha O's from Cal, Stanford, and the
southern provinces.
Last night a Phi Psi met a Hobleite who wanted to
dance at the new Lagunita night club. Since the La
gunita night club was not yet clubbed into submission,
the two adjourned to the Phi Psi house for a jolly-up.
This mpt with such overwhelming approval on the part
of all the Phi Psi's. that pretty soon there were 17 Phi
Psi's and 17 Robleites jolly-upping in the Phi Psi house.
