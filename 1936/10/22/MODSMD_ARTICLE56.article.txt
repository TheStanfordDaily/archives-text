"THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" at the
Palo Alto Community Theater
Bernard Shaw's "melodrama for
Puritans" was given fine dramatic
form by the community players last
week. Sets, supervised by Carroll
Alexander, were detailed, accurate,
particularly so the last city scene
equipped with scaffold, pillory,
store and house fronts. Lighting,
from the dim, early morning opening
interior to the brightness of the last
square scene, conformed with the
mood and tempo of each act.
No glorious revolt is the American
Revolution to Shaw, but a fortuitous
rebellion successful because of a
British cabinet officer's neglect. It
is on this failure of a certain British
minister to forward dispatches to Sir
William Howe ordering him to join
Burgoyne's forces at Albany that
the plot of "The Devil's Disciple"
hangs. General Burgoyne, hopelessly
outnumbered, loses support and Dick
Dudgeon's neck is saved.
Clarke Remains Clarke
' Fred Clarke, despite unfailing
stage presence, was rather too com
fortably Fred Clarke and not
enough Dick Dudgeon. In the will
reading scene he swaggered well,
was cynically gallant throughout,
but there were all the mannerisms

of" June Moon" and "Private Lives"
in this eighteenth century character
ization. And I suspected this Dick of
concealing a kind of noble passion
for the minister's wife, something
that certainly the playwright never
intended. Phyllis Corson was well
cast as the charming young wife of
Minister Anderson.
Rosemary Hay played Mrs. Dud
geon with a grimness that fully sug
gested her narrow New England
morality, her fiendish religiosity.
Florence Brill as Essie the foundling
quailed and moped, and after Dick's
appearance, bloomed, competently.
Cliff Giffin made of Anthony Ander
son a genial Presbyterian divine, an
energetic man-of-action when he
determined to renounce "the cloak
for the sword."
Genial General
Other good characterizations were
that of General Burgoyne, whom
Shaw shows us a thoroughly like
able fellow, played by Cecil Edney;
Jack Warnock as Christy, the good
natured half-wit, pompous Major
Swindon; and a sergeant with an
authentic English accent.
Direction began slowly to build to
a brisk climax in the court room
scene. And the stage was never too
packed — good handling of a large
cast. —Warson
