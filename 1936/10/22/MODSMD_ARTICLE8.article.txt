# Lake Bed Is Chosen For Bonfire Site
## Cardinals Pick Pavilion For Big Game Rally, Barbecue Plans Vetoed 
### 
For the first time the traditional
Big Game Bonfire will be held in
Lagunita's dry lake bed instead of
opposite the 8.A.C., it was decided by
a vote of eight to two at Cardinals
meeting last night.
The plan for a barbecue in con
nection with the Big Game Rally
and Bonfire was finally defeated
after a heated discussion. Main ob
jections were that it would not be
feasible to feed an esitmated crowd
of over 300. as all campus dining
halls would be closed for the event,
and that the rooters' spirit would
expire by the time the rally came
around.
Rally in Pavilion
Cardinals also decided that the
rally should be held in the basketball
pavilion as usual instead of Lagunita
with the bonlre.
The torchlight parade will prob
ably be from the Pavilion to the lake
for the lighting of the bonfire, and
around Lagunita afterwards.
McCroskey: "Let's burn the boat
house" (Moved and seconded.)
Mark Hopkins reported on plans
for the U.S.C. dance. Decorations
will be the usual score and goal
posts. So far 28 bids have been sold.
Franich: "Why not get some pub
licity on this? All I see around here
are posters for George White's
'Scandals'."
Hopkins: "How about the liberty
bond idea—'A kiss with every bid
you buy'."
No Date Bureau
Cardinals reported on progress of
the "date bureau." It was decided to
continue as before with no organized
bureau, but jnembers agreeing to
help students wanting dates.
Grover: "What about the man that
called me that had a wife?"
Graves: "I can't get dates for all
the Hi-Y boys in Paly."
Red Cross Drive plans were re
viewed by Rotty Grover, chairman.
Mark Hopkins was appointed to or
ganize the drive in the men's dormi
tories. Webb Jones will take care of
the Row.
Night Spot Discussed
The possibility of having a campus
night spot was brought up. Most
members were strongly in favor but
suggested that "representative cam
pus opinion" was needed. The boat
house was definitely condemned for
this purpose as being too old and
rickety to withstand the wear and
tear. All were in favor of something
very simple.
Killefer suggested that surplus
junior class funds be thrown in with
the spring dollar to cover the cost of
building the Hideout.

members were strongly in favor but
suggested that "representative cam
pus opinion" was needed. The boat
house was definitely condemned for
this purpose as being too old and
rickety to withstand the wear and
tear. All were in favor of something
very simple.
Killefer suggested that surplus
junior class funds be thrown in with
the spring dollar to cover the cost of
building the Hideout.
For the first time the traditional
Big Game Bonfire will be held in
Lagunita's dry lake bed instead of
opposite the 8.A.C., it was decided by
a vote of eight to two at Cardinals
meeting last night.
The plan for a barbecue in con
nection with the Big Game Rally
and Bonfire was finally defeated
after a heated discussion. Main ob
jections were that it would not be
feasible to feed an esitmated crowd
of over 300. as all campus dining
halls would be closed for the event,
and that the rooters' spirit would
expire by the time the rally came
around.
Rally in Pavilion
Cardinals also decided that the
rally should be held in the basketball
pavilion as usual instead of Lagunita
with the bonlre.
The torchlight parade will prob
ably be from the Pavilion to the lake
for the lighting of the bonfire, and
around Lagunita afterwards.
McCroskey: "Let's burn the boat
house" (Moved and seconded.)
Mark Hopkins reported on plans
for the U.S.C. dance. Decorations
will be the usual score and goal
posts. So far 28 bids have been sold.
Franich: "Why not get some pub
licity on this? All I see around here
are posters for George White's
'Scandals'."
Hopkins: "How about the liberty
bond idea—'A kiss with every bid
you buy'."
No Date Bureau
Cardinals reported on progress of
the "date bureau." It was decided to
continue as before with no organized
bureau, but jnembers agreeing to
help students wanting dates.
Grover: "What about the man that
called me that had a wife?"
Graves: "I can't get dates for all
the Hi-Y boys in Paly."
Red Cross Drive plans were re
viewed by Rotty Grover, chairman.
Mark Hopkins was appointed to or
ganize the drive in the men's dormi
tories. Webb Jones will take care of
the Row.
Night Spot Discussed
The possibility of having a campus
night spot was brought up. Most
members were strongly in favor but
suggested that "representative cam
pus opinion" was needed. The boat
