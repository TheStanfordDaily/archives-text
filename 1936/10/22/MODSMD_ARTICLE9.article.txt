# Dr. Wilbur Silent On Talent Bail
## 
### 
Because he had not yet received
direct request from Ex Committee to
lift the ban on ofT-campus enter
tainers, Dr. Wilbur yesterday de
clined to predict what action would
be taken. "Student Council proposed
that rule several years ago to pre
vent thy recurrence of certain un
fortunate happenings. I can say
nothing until I sec what sort of pro
posal the committee makes."
The opinion of the president was
that, since no particular control cati
be exercised by students over the de
cency of commercial band enter
tainment, responsibility must be def
initely fixed by some plan.
