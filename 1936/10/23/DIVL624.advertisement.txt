Returns Purse
LOST: .Small dark brown Mexi
can tooled leather purse three inches
square —two pieces fitted together.
Large roll of bank bills and house
key inside. Lost in Cellar. Reward.
Perhaps you saw this ad in yester
day's Daily and if you did perhaps
you wondered how much the large
roll really was.
The contents of that purse
amounted to exactly $.100 and was
left in the phone booth of the Cellar
day before yesterday afternoon by
Jean Tatlock, university student.
Because she ran an ad in the
Daily. Miss Tatlock recovered her
purse last night — but the finder
neglected to leave his name.
