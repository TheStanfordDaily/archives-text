# Confessions of Barrymore Book No. 497,659 in Library
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
At 3:13 p.m. Wednesday, Miss El
sie Rennc stamped the number 497,-
659 in a copy of "The Confessions of
an Actor," by John Barrymore. This
recent work, destined for the Felton
library, was the latest book to be ac
cessioned by the main library.
Forty-five years ago, "Manual of
the Vertebrate Animals of the
Northeastern United States," by
David Starr Jordan—a gift of the
author—received the imprint "01"
and became officially the first book
in the Stanford library system which
today—or at any rate last August 31
—numbered 659,897 items, inclusive
of the Medical and Hoover War Li
brary collections.
Ten years ago the number was
little more than half—only 1143,431 —
while on October 1, 1891, the univer
sity opened for business with about
300 hastily gathered books and
pamphlets.
Today, the Hoover War Library J
alone accounts for over 85,000 items,
accession number 85,116 having been
stamped into a set of Dutch news
papers just the day before yester
day.
At the end of the last school year,
gifts and purchases had built up the
Stanford library to 8000 volumes,
housed in one room of what is now
the law department in the inner
Quad.
There the steadily growing collec
tion remained until 1900 when
Thomas Welton Stanford—the sena- i
tor's brother who made his millions '
in Australia donated a $300,000 edi
fice on the outer Quad, the present
Ad Building. There in 1906 were
shelved 90,761 works and in 1916,

234,547. A list, of those donating
gifts—often of complete private li
braries—would be long and would
number many illustrious names.
Among the benefactors, the names of
Timothy Hopkins, who presented the
nucleus of the present transportation
library, and David Starr Jordan bulk
large.
Even as early as 1906 the library
was growing so rapidly that a large
and rococo structure had been all
but completed on what is now the
Theater Quad when the disastrous
earthquake totally wrecked it. A
subsequent library report smilingly
deems this for the best as that
building was an architectural eye
sore.
In 1904, just before leaving for
Honolulu, from where she did not
return alive, Mrs. Stanford made
over $500,000 worth of jewels to the
trustees to be invested in water
tight securities from which the in
come—which fluctuates about $20,000
per annum—was to be used exclu
sively for adding to the library.
In 1919 was completed the familiar
"libc" to the east of the Quad. The
report on its completion enthusias
tically describes it as accommodating
700,000 books—an allowance for the
next 50 years, at least. About eight
weeks ago the total university col
lection— 659,897—was within 40,10.'?,
this figure and several hundred
books were being accessioned daily.
However, the stacks hold but 497,-
659 of these, the rest being scattered
throughout departmental libraries,
and thnre is hardly danger that the
libo will be outgrown in the very
near future.
