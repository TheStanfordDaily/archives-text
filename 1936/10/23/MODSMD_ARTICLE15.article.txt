## 
### 
Allen Kittell and Boh Thallon, both freshmen, were jailed on charges
of disturbing the peace and malicious mischief, and the Varsity Theater in
Palo Alto was damaged to the extent of ftJOO as two hundred frosh went
wild last night and tried to storm Roble Hall and show houses in Palo
Alto, Mayfield, and Menlo Park.
Both of the frosh were picked up at the Varsity Theater by Chief of
Police Howard Zink after tomato-throwing and general rough-housing

Resulted in a broken plate glass win
dow, several broken plates in the
marquee or canopy overhead, three
broken neon sign tubes, and dam
aged clothcs of the cashier. The
cashier was in a serious nervous
condition following the incident,
Chief Zink reported.
Start at Roble
The riotous frosh, just out of the
rally for the Southern Cal game to
morrow, went off on their rampage
first at Roble and tried to crash the
sedate portals. Under combined ef
forts of the cheer leaders and Palo
Alto police they were repulsed, so
they headed tor University Avenue.
In front of the Stanford Theater
another small riot took place, as

President Wilbur, when ask
ed for a statement on last
night's affair by The Daily, said:
"We have a pretty large cam
pus. They could have done
their rioting out here."

forewarned police once again were
too much for the wild-eyed first
year men. No damage was done
there.
Officers Hold
Still one jump ahead of the col
legians, two officers held the fort at
the Varsity house for a time, fling
ing a barrage of tear gas to hold off
the gang. Then a handful of frosh
began a tomato-throwing episode,
only to find themselves facing the
billy clubs of reinforcements. After
breaking out the glass in the mar
quee, smashing the door, and in gen
eral smearing up the front of the
varsity, (hey retired, leaving Thallon
and Kittell in the talons of the law.
Their ire not yet appeased, the
rampagers tore down to Mayfield
with blood in their eyes, only to be
held off there by more of Paly's po
lice. After a minor disturbance they
announced the intention of leaving
lor Menlo Park, warning the lav/ and
setting themselves up some fine op
position for then 1 arrival there.
Meanwhile, another group had al
ready reached the Menlo show
house, and were having a tough time
getting around a civic-minded citi
zen who seen his duty and done it.
A husky Scandinavian, this tough
individual held off the howling mob
with a menacing club until police ar
rived to disperse the crowd.
Cooled off after this complete se
ries of repulsions, the outfit all went
home to think it over, apparently,
for no more uprisals occurred. A
few of the faithful went to the Paly
police station to plead for the release
of the two incarcerated ones, but the
pair were held without bail.
