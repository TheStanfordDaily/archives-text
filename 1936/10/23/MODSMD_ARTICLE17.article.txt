# Sports Writer Calls Indians Professionals
## 
### 
Rooters and fans who jam the
Stanford Stadium tomorrow after
noon will see a great football game
—the best that money can buy, ac
cording to John R. Tunis, prominent
sports writer, who yesterday named
both Stanford and Southern Califor
nia as schools with "professional"
athletic standing.
In an article in "The American
Mercury," according to a United
Press report, Tunis classified 100
colleges as to "their practices in
modern athletics" and charged that
football at most schools is an out
and out racket.
Tunis said that Yale, by agreeing
to sell exclusive rights to its football
broadcasting, "has definitely taken a
far-reaching step. At last we have
an old established university ad
mitting openly what long has been a
fact: that college football is a racket.
Yale intends to get her cut. A great
educational institution finally is
calling a spade a spade—and a foot
ball a golden egg."
Under Group A, "the amaeturs,"
he listed: Alleghany, Bowdoin,
Brown, California Tech, Center, Chi
cago, City Cullugu of New York,
Colby, Gettysburg, Hamilton, Haver
ford, Hobart, Johns Hopkins, Ken
yon, Knox, Lehigh, Williams, Maine,
Middlebury, Oberlin, Occidental,
Pomona, Rochester, Rutgers, Se
wanee, Smarthmore, Trinity, Tufts,
Union, Ursinus, Virginia, Wesleyan,
and William and Mary.
Tunis said he did not believe that
all American colleges and universi
ties conduct subsidized and profes
sionalized athletics. "There are to
day," he added, "a few colleges and
universities which observe the real
traditions of amateur sport. But
there are many more that do not."
Commenting on the group, he said:
'The majority of these institutions
are small colleges, most of them of
high standing . . . They all play
football . . . None attempts to un
derwrite a huge stadium."
Under Group B, "the semi-pros,"
lie listed: Amherst, Boston Univer
sity, Army, California, Cincinnati,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Illi
nois, lowa, Kentucky, Lafayette,
Maryland, Michigan, Navy, N.Y.U.,
Notre Dame, Pennsylvania, Penn
State, Purdue, Rollins, Tennessee,
Texas Vanderbilt, W. and J., and
Yale."
He said: "Here are small colleges
and large ones, (he chief bond in
common being the fact that all have
athletic plants which cost real money
to maintain .This can be done solely
by means of football receipts."
Under Group C, "the profession

That group, Tunis said, "comprises !
a weird assortment. A few are there j
simply because they are obliged to;
be."

That group, Tunis said, "comprises !
a weird assortment. A few are there j
simply because they are obliged to;
be."
Rooters and fans who jam the
Stanford Stadium tomorrow after
noon will see a great football game
—the best that money can buy, ac
cording to John R. Tunis, prominent
sports writer, who yesterday named
both Stanford and Southern Califor
nia as schools with "professional"
athletic standing.
In an article in "The American
Mercury," according to a United
Press report, Tunis classified 100
colleges as to "their practices in
modern athletics" and charged that
football at most schools is an out
and out racket.
Tunis said that Yale, by agreeing
to sell exclusive rights to its football
broadcasting, "has definitely taken a
far-reaching step. At last we have
an old established university ad
mitting openly what long has been a
fact: that college football is a racket.
Yale intends to get her cut. A great
educational institution finally is
calling a spade a spade—and a foot
ball a golden egg."
Under Group A, "the amaeturs,"
he listed: Alleghany, Bowdoin,
Brown, California Tech, Center, Chi

yon, Knox, Lehigh, Williams, Maine,
Middlebury, Oberlin, Occidental,
Pomona, Rochester, Rutgers, Se
wanee, Smarthmore, Trinity, Tufts,
Union, Ursinus, Virginia, Wesleyan,
and William and Mary.
Tunis said he did not believe that
all American colleges and universi
ties conduct subsidized and profes
sionalized athletics. "There are to
day," he added, "a few colleges and
universities which observe the real
traditions of amateur sport. But
there are many more that do not."
Commenting on the group, he said:
'The majority of these institutions
are small colleges, most of them of
high standing . . . They all play
football . . . None attempts to un
derwrite a huge stadium."
