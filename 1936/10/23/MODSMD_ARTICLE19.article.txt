# 'Team Can Win," Says Tiny Trojans Arrive, Go Into Hiding at San Jose Today
## Thornhill Expects Big Red Machine To Roll Over Invaders Tomorrow; Gridders' Spirit High for Encounter 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Tiny Thorniiill is nol a man to make rash promises. A.s a matter of
fact, he makes it a point never to appear unduly optimistic, but he says
Stanford can do it.
He means that 47 staunch, grim, and determined gridiron warriors of
the Farm now stand ready to repel the onslaught of the advancing gladia-

o>tors of Troy. He means that the Red
skins can ride rough-shod over all
the obstacles concocted by doubting
Thomases and prove their real prow
ess tomorrow afternoon.
Trojans Arrive Today
Howard Jones' invaders arrive at
the Castlewood Country Club in San
Jose this morning, and there they
will remain in seclusion until they
! climb aboard a bus for Palo Alto
I shortly after noon tomorrow. Jones
will send his forces through but one
light workout, slated to take place
on the Castlewood golf course late
this afternoon.
Doubters, dirge-slingers, and other
pessimists have been busy cackling
the opinion that the Indians have at
best only an outside chance. Those
same Indians, however, are out not
to discuss px'os and cons, but to con
vert into action their increasing de
termination to triumph.
Indians Earnest
When Tiny and his crew mean
business, they are in no mood to be
trifled with. This was proved con
clusively during the past two weeks.
The Farm mentor has drilled the
squad more than for a Big Game,
more than for a Rose Bowl contest;
as a matter of fact, more than for
any previous fracas in which Stan
ford has had a hand.
He called secret practices, locked
the creaky gates of the practice field
because he felt that the situation
necessitated action, and strong ac
tion. He stressed fundamentals un
til every one of the men learned the
fine art of any and all Tro
jans who might be carrying the pig
skin.
Pass Defense
He grounded the Cardinals in dis
posing of annoying passes that might
come their way. He chose several
of the more outstanding gridsters
and continued to work intensively
on them, but never once did he neg
lect the rest of the aggregation.
And out of this careful and some
what thankless building he evolved a
machine that should distinctly sur
prise even its severest critics to
morrow. And, finally, into this ma
chine he poured a spirit that hasn't
shown the faintest sign of dimming,
much less has it lamed.
Plan Pass Attack
Ardent upholders of the Cardinal
will see when the Red Machine rolls
out on the Stadium turr, some pass
ing that Jones of Troy has been fear
ing since last week, a scries of be
fuddling new line plays, a relentless
attack, and a solid defense.
Jake Brigham, who has been look
ing better on pass-tossing, punting,
and ball-toting right alonjf, gets the
starting call at fullback. "Hands"
Calvclli, shifted from center to full,
who has looked equally efficient on
passing, yesterday took a lot of kick
ing honors in competition with Tom
Collins, Fred Williams, and Brigham.
Calvclli will probably get into much
of tomorrow's action.
Card Starters
I he other starters, who opened in
the Oregon deadlock two weeka ago,
include Grant Stone, light end; Jack
Clark, left end; Cab Callaway, right
tackle; Pete Zagar, left tackle; Loo
Ferko, left guard; Bob Matthews,
right guard; and "Chooch" Tsoutsou
vas, in the line. The backfield will
be composed of Earl Hoos, at quar
