Mi l) FIGHTS AND BURLESQUE
According to reports, the women
found the mud fight soul-satisfying.
Of course, the women, who are the
firmest believers in the doctrine that
woman is the refining influence in
society, will protest on the grounds
that they went down to the mudhole
to see a demonstration of physical
strength. This is the same as saying
(hat men go to burlesque shows for
demonstrations of indigenous Amer
ican art.

The way that women who think
(he mud fight great stuff look down
their noses at masculine lowbrows
who go to see Mamie Gloop do her
act under the blue lights just goes
to show that women's taste in en
tertainment is shallow indeed.
Nothing clever ever happens at a
mud fight. Even at the wrestling
circuses in San Francisco where
women go in great crowds to watch
(he bulging muscles and to scream
(he loudest of all for more blood,
there is always a Terrible Turk or a
Jumping Jugoslavian with handle
bar mustachios to give the mob a
laugh.
Even the crowd gets clever. When
ihe Marked Marvel is sitting on
Shi ok Ben Mar Hassan's stomach
arid pulling hairs out of the Arab's
- lest, some wit in the balcony will
i.iise his voice out of the deathly
llence with "Allah! Allah!"

If' the women think the mud fight
;; great slapstick, they ought to go
to a good burlesque on the wrong
■Je of the railroad tracks. It is the
real last stronghold of the Mack
Sennett technique. And the ad lib
l''ng is sometimes nothing short of
inspired.
1 remember the time at one bur-
It ;que when two sailors were trying
(o sell their girls to the harem. They
got to entertaining the sultan with
i.nple little tricks like picking up
their hats with their teeth and so
<• . Then they got to kidding one
a. other and went right thx-ough the
v iole list of parlor stunts, calling
for amber spots, blackouts, and fade
i. s; fighting over the applause.
They ran so far past time for the
act that the curtain went down while
<>. e gob was on the floor trying to
kick his hat from his foot to his
li ad and we simple-mindeds down
in the chairs were flat on our backs.
