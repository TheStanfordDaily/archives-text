# Complete Co-operation Needed For Complex Rooters' Stunts
## Rally Committee Asks Rooters Not To Bring Dates to S. C. Game 
### 
"Because of the complex nature of
this Saturday's card stunts, we are
asking for the complete co-operation
of the Stanford rooting section," said
T. M. McDaniel and Kay Moran,
Rally Committee chairmen, last
night.
Rooters who sit in the Stanford
rooting section at the S.C. game to
morrow are instructed to sit directly
above the cards which are tacked to
bleacher seats. Also, be sure you
are sitting in a straight vertical line
with the men in front of you.
Follow Directions
According to McDaniel and Moran,
some of the stunts will involve flip
ping over cards, row by row, as the
rope stretched across rooting section
passes over each row of rooters. Do
not forget to Hip your card over
when the rope passes overhead.
When there are two pai'ts to a
card stunt, fit your second card to
the back of the first card, so that
they may be reversed with a mini
mum of effort and a maximum of
speed.
Don't Bring Dates
If every rooter will pay careful
attention to the yell leader, as he
gives detailed information for each
stunt, the card stunts are sure to
have a resultant good appearance
to those seated on the opposite side
of the stadium. Before each stunt, j
a large picture representing the de
sired effect will be shown on the
yell leader's platform.
Those sitting in the rooting section
are asked to comply with the Stan
ford tradition of not bringing dates
to the game because the women are
seated in a separate section. Women
will not participate in the card
stunts.
