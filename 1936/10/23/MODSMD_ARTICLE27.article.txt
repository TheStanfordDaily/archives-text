### FRANCES SLATER 
MEN-TALITIES
PARTY PREFERENCES: So, you
and your father are for Landon?
Well, that clearly makes you a capi
talist. and Phelps-Terkel will tailor
you along those lines in on 6 of two
new weaves:
1. British Glen-Plaid for a gar-

ment, dapper and draped and un
hampered by plebian lines. This will
make up in a top coat or a well
bred suit.
2. Taupe colored Scotch tweed,
decked liberally with shamrock
green and oxford-tan—a heavy mix
ture that exudes a woody pipe
smoke fragrance. Your leather
cased binoculars will show up to ex
cellent advantage slung down a
jacket of this material.
For the Democratic faction, Ter
kel's has a pencil-striped dark
woolen that came in with the Roose
velt administration. They can tailor
this for you in any conservative suit
(colors, cocoa-brown, or slate-blue).
If you are for Lemke or Browder,
Phelps-Terkel will sell you a pair of
cords, and give you up as a bad job.
PHELPS-TERKEL
FOOT-NOTES: The leather was
originally tanned in Cordova Spain
(sorry we can't say war-tofn Spain,
because this process dates from the
18th century). It is thick-skinned
horse-hide, worked to a high polish
and ruggedness in a Florsheim shoe,
wing-toed and plain. Thoits features
it especially this week.
* THOITS-FLORSHEIM
ADVANTAGES: Phelps - Terkel's
mufflers . . . $5.00 for the imported
cashmere kind in subdued tones

(mustard-seed, mauve, azure-blue,
and light tile) . . . then, the $2.50
home grown variety in colors that
are more sure of themselves . . .
Phelps-Te*kel's Argyle hose, fa
miliar hand-wove nsox in plaids and
patterns that make themselves heard
. . . their cigarette gadgets, that are
crude as the pen-knife you carved in
grammar school for your dad's
Christmas present . . . and painted
just as garishly in Stanford colors.
(You twirl the "thing and it flips a
cigarette out at you from a pigeon
hole that keeps it intact.)

***FEMININITIES
GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN:

It is a formal of black, cire satin,
tightly rolled around the hem, into a
lacquered binding. Two flambuoy
ant, giant poppies are caught at the
throat. As you would expect, it has a
low back. (We wouldn't advise you
to try this sinuous sheath unless you
are blonde and somewhat angelic. It
might give the wrong impression.)
SUE BERRY

SCOTCH AND SODA OUTFIT:
A tunic of Oxford-brown Chantilly
lace that ripples at the hem over a
crepe sheathe (you wouldn't know
unless we told you, but tunic owes
its swirl to buckram hem-band).
With this you wear a diminutive,
brown toque, ridged all over and
veiled imperitnently.
MARY ELIZABETH
FOR THE TAILLEUR: Sue Ber
ry's Forstmann wool of dull spruce
green, with a regiment of small but
determined hooks-and-eyes march
ing down its entire length .'. .

Mary Elizabeth's two-piece wood
rose ensemble with an eaton-col
lared jacket of gray nutria.
EYE-TALICS: We can't under
score this Eye-Sheen make-up heav
ily enough. It is a creamy type of
mascara-black or midnight-blue that
you smooth on your lashes. After
you have dashed on some cold water,
the make-up will not smear on your
lids or cheeks.
ROOS BROS. BEAUTY SALON
FLOWERS: The Flower Shop will
pin a giant crysanthemum in your
button hole for the game, or they
will plant a small boutonniere of
carnations or rose buds, Stanford
colors, on the lapel of your suit.
THE FLOWER SHOP
SHOES: All at Zwierlein's ... a
brown suede Peacock pump, with a
pleated tongue . . . Turkish boudoir
slippers from the Arabian Nights,
studded with a firmament of silver
stars . . . black suede slim heeled
sandals, fashioned from a maze of
stitched straps . . . and a type of
sports shoe that nothing but a cam
era can do justice by, so tricky is it
with its covered instep, side-buck
led strap, and patent leather covered
heel.
ZWIERLEIN-WALKOVER
ADVANTAGES: Evanescent dress
ing gowns from Sue Berry—of gos
samer weave Shetland fioss, in frag
ile, delicate colors . . . Sue Berry's
glacial white Chantilly dinner gown,
whose lace-flower pattern is traced
in glittering silver threads . . .
Mary Elizabeth's reorder on Moiud
hosiery, a long - suffering sheet
stocking . . . the frankly magenta
tea rose at Sue Berry, with its real
istic stem, replete with thorns.

***FEMININITIES
GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN:

It is a formal of black, cire satin,
tightly rolled around the hem, into a
lacquered binding. Two flambuoy
ant, giant poppies are caught at the
throat. As you would expect, it has a
low back. (We wouldn't advise you
to try this sinuous sheath unless you
are blonde and somewhat angelic. It
might give the wrong impression.)
SUE BERRY

SCOTCH AND SODA OUTFIT:
A tunic of Oxford-brown Chantilly
lace that ripples at the hem over a
crepe sheathe (you wouldn't know
unless we told you, but tunic owes
its swirl to buckram hem-band).
With this you wear a diminutive,
brown toque, ridged all over and
veiled imperitnently.
MARY ELIZABETH
FOR THE TAILLEUR: Sue Ber
ry's Forstmann wool of dull spruce
green, with a regiment of small but
determined hooks-and-eyes march
ing down its entire length .'. .

Mary Elizabeth's two-piece wood
rose ensemble with an eaton-col
lared jacket of gray nutria.
EYE-TALICS: We can't under
score this Eye-Sheen make-up heav
ily enough. It is a creamy type of
mascara-black or midnight-blue that
you smooth on your lashes. After
you have dashed on some cold water,
the make-up will not smear on your
lids or cheeks.
ROOS BROS. BEAUTY SALON
FLOWERS: The Flower Shop will
pin a giant crysanthemum in your
button hole for the game, or they
will plant a small boutonniere of
carnations or rose buds, Stanford
colors, on the lapel of your suit.
THE FLOWER SHOP
SHOES: All at Zwierlein's ... a
brown suede Peacock pump, with a
pleated tongue . . . Turkish boudoir
slippers from the Arabian Nights,
studded with a firmament of silver
stars . . . black suede slim heeled
sandals, fashioned from a maze of
stitched straps . . . and a type of
sports shoe that nothing but a cam
era can do justice by, so tricky is it
with its covered instep, side-buck
led strap, and patent leather covered
heel.
ZWIERLEIN-WALKOVER
ADVANTAGES: Evanescent dress
ing gowns from Sue Berry—of gos
samer weave Shetland fioss, in frag
ile, delicate colors . . . Sue Berry's
glacial white Chantilly dinner gown,
whose lace-flower pattern is traced
in glittering silver threads . . .
Mary Elizabeth's reorder on Moiud
hosiery, a long - suffering sheet
stocking . . . the frankly magenta
tea rose at Sue Berry, with its real
istic stem, replete with thorns.



MEN-TALITIES
PARTY PREFERENCES: So, you
and your father are for Landon?
Well, that clearly makes you a capi
talist. and Phelps-Terkel will tailor
you along those lines in on 6 of two
new weaves:
1. British Glen-Plaid for a gar-

ment, dapper and draped and un
hampered by plebian lines. This will
make up in a top coat or a well
bred suit.
2. Taupe colored Scotch tweed,
decked liberally with shamrock
green and oxford-tan—a heavy mix
ture that exudes a woody pipe
smoke fragrance. Your leather
cased binoculars will show up to ex
cellent advantage slung down a
jacket of this material.
For the Democratic faction, Ter
kel's has a pencil-striped dark
woolen that came in with the Roose
velt administration. They can tailor
this for you in any conservative suit
(colors, cocoa-brown, or slate-blue).
If you are for Lemke or Browder,
Phelps-Terkel will sell you a pair of
cords, and give you up as a bad job.

pin a giant crysanthemum in your
button hole for the game, or they
will plant a small boutonniere of
carnations or rose buds, Stanford
colors, on the lapel of your suit.
THE FLOWER SHOP
SHOES: All at Zwierlein's ... a
brown suede Peacock pump, with a
pleated tongue . . . Turkish boudoir
slippers from the Arabian Nights,
studded with a firmament of silver
stars . . . black suede slim heeled
sandals, fashioned from a maze of
stitched straps . . . and a type of
sports shoe that nothing but a cam
era can do justice by, so tricky is it
with its covered instep, side-buck
led strap, and patent leather covered
heel.
ZWIERLEIN-WALKOVER
ADVANTAGES: Evanescent dress
ing gowns from Sue Berry—of gos
samer weave Shetland fioss, in frag
ile, delicate colors . . . Sue Berry's
glacial white Chantilly dinner gown,
whose lace-flower pattern is traced
in glittering silver threads . . .
Mary Elizabeth's reorder on Moiud
hosiery, a long - suffering sheet
stocking . . . the frankly magenta
tea rose at Sue Berry, with its real
istic stem, replete with thorns.



MEN-TALITIES
PARTY PREFERENCES: So, you
and your father are for Landon?
Well, that clearly makes you a capi
talist. and Phelps-Terkel will tailor
you along those lines in on 6 of two
new weaves:
1. British Glen-Plaid for a gar-

ment, dapper and draped and un
hampered by plebian lines. This will
make up in a top coat or a well
bred suit.
2. Taupe colored Scotch tweed,
decked liberally with shamrock
green and oxford-tan—a heavy mix
ture that exudes a woody pipe
smoke fragrance. Your leather
cased binoculars will show up to ex
cellent advantage slung down a
jacket of this material.
For the Democratic faction, Ter
kel's has a pencil-striped dark
woolen that came in with the Roose
velt administration. They can tailor
this for you in any conservative suit
(colors, cocoa-brown, or slate-blue).
If you are for Lemke or Browder,
Phelps-Terkel will sell you a pair of
cords, and give you up as a bad job.
PHELPS-TERKEL
FOOT-NOTES: The leather was
originally tanned in Cordova Spain
(sorry we can't say war-tofn Spain,
because this process dates from the
18th century). It is thick-skinned
horse-hide, worked to a high polish
and ruggedness in a Florsheim shoe,
wing-toed and plain. Thoits features
it especially this week.
* THOITS-FLORSHEIM
ADVANTAGES: Phelps - Terkel's
mufflers . . . $5.00 for the imported
cashmere kind in subdued tones

(mustard-seed, mauve, azure-blue,
and light tile) . . . then, the $2.50
home grown variety in colors that
are more sure of themselves . . .
Phelps-Te*kel's Argyle hose, fa
miliar hand-wove nsox in plaids and
patterns that make themselves heard
. . . their cigarette gadgets, that are
crude as the pen-knife you carved in
grammar school for your dad's
Christmas present . . . and painted
just as garishly in Stanford colors.
(You twirl the "thing and it flips a
cigarette out at you from a pigeon
hole that keeps it intact.)

***FEMININITIES
GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN:

It is a formal of black, cire satin,
tightly rolled around the hem, into a
lacquered binding. Two flambuoy
ant, giant poppies are caught at the
throat. As you would expect, it has a
low back. (We wouldn't advise you
to try this sinuous sheath unless you
are blonde and somewhat angelic. It
might give the wrong impression.)
SUE BERRY

SCOTCH AND SODA OUTFIT:
A tunic of Oxford-brown Chantilly
lace that ripples at the hem over a
crepe sheathe (you wouldn't know
unless we told you, but tunic owes
its swirl to buckram hem-band).
With this you wear a diminutive,
brown toque, ridged all over and
veiled imperitnently.
MARY ELIZABETH
FOR THE TAILLEUR: Sue Ber
ry's Forstmann wool of dull spruce
green, with a regiment of small but
determined hooks-and-eyes march
ing down its entire length .'. .

Mary Elizabeth's two-piece wood
rose ensemble with an eaton-col
lared jacket of gray nutria.
EYE-TALICS: We can't under
score this Eye-Sheen make-up heav
ily enough. It is a creamy type of
mascara-black or midnight-blue that
you smooth on your lashes. After
you have dashed on some cold water,
the make-up will not smear on your
lids or cheeks.
