# Rushing Continues Until 8 Tonight
## 
### 
Rushing will continue today with
an abbreviated period ending at 8
o'clock tonight.
Twenty-five hundred rushing
cards have been issued for this pe
riod, according to Bob Hoover,
president of the Interfraternity
Council. The closing time has been
set at 8 o'clock instead of the custo
mary midnight deadiine, because the
fraternities need time to prepare for
the open houses they are going to
hold on Saturday.
