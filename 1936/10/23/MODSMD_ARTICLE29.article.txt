# Yearling Cagers To Meet Varsity
## 
### 
Starting Wednesday on a bit more i
involved team play, the frosh bas
ketball team began to tighten up a j
little as Coach Wytze Goiter looks
forward to the game with the varsity j
November 13.
General fundamentals, including
dribbling, guarding, shooting, and
the like, will still occupy a lot of
the team's time while it goes through
the first spasms of developing an
offense. Defense drills will come
after the outfit has a fairly well-es
tablished offense, according to Coach
Gorter, since the ability to score
goals tends to bolster a team's spirit.
The varsity, naturally stalling
with a great advantage over the
frosh, will need less of fundamentals
work and consequently will be more
advanced than the first-year squad |
when they meet next month, accord- j
ing to Gorter.
