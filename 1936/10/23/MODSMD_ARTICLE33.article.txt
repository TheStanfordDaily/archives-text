# Elmer Fagan Sides with New Deal Policies
## Professor of Economics Gives Views on Fiscal Aspects of Campaign 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Although he made it quite clear
that he was playing no political fa
vorites and was attempting complete
objectivity, Elmer D. Fagan, pro
fessor of economics, yesterday fin
ished his speech on "The Fiscal Is
sues of the Current Campaign" with
the box score standing about 3 to 1
in favor of New Deal policies.
"This business of the federal gov
ernment spending large sums for
wise public works projects during a
depression is economically sound,"
Fagan told students attending the
third session of the new Current
Events course. "Government ex
penditure in the trough of the
business cycle has proven a great
boon to recovery."
F.li. Spending Would Decrease
If Roosevelt were re-elected, his
spending would be considerably less
than during the past four years,
Fagan said. Such large sums for re
lief would be unnecessary with
business better and with the na
tional income up a great deal, reve
nue from income taxes would in
crease tremendously without raising
the present tax rate.
"Whether the Republicans would
appreciably cut federal expenditures
depends entirely upon how seriously
Mr. Landon considers his farm aid
promises," declared the professor. "If
he carried them out logically, it
would be a $2,000,000,000 annual ex
pense in cash payments to farmers."
Against Profit Tax
Fagan agreed with Landon's oppo
sition to the administration's tax on
undistributed corporation profits. He
felt that a revised income tax sys
tem could remove the evil which the
present tax seeks to do—the fact that
unincorporated enterprises paid
large personal income taxes on prof
its while large corporations paid
only a small tax.
Roosevelt s method of raising
funds for unemployment insurance
by a 3 per cent pay-roll tax does not
put too great a strain on the workers
as Landon claims, the professor de
clared.
"The workers are the ones who
will benefit in the long run. This
social security system just with
holds some of the workers' purchas
ing power until such a time as he
will need it," he said.
Different Tax Theories
Though both parties stress taxa
lion based upon ability to pay, Fagan
fcaid their purposes of taxation were
different. "The Republicans believe
in direct taxation for revenue means
only, while the Democrats believe in
taxing the wealthy to provide for
economic equilibrium as the business
cycle runs its course."
When the time comes next month
to vote, Fagan told the students that
they would have to decide for them
selves. "What the candidates say in
their speeches now is not necessarily
what they'll do if elected," he said.

wise public works projects during a
depression is economically sound,"
Fagan told students attending the
third session of the new Current
Events course. "Government ex
penditure in the trough of the
business cycle has proven a great
boon to recovery."
F.li. Spending Would Decrease
If Roosevelt were re-elected, his
spending would be considerably less
than during the past four years,
Fagan said. Such large sums for re
lief would be unnecessary with
business better and with the na
tional income up a great deal, reve
nue from income taxes would in
crease tremendously without raising
the present tax rate.
"Whether the Republicans would
appreciably cut federal expenditures
depends entirely upon how seriously
Mr. Landon considers his farm aid
promises," declared the professor. "If
he carried them out logically, it
would be a $2,000,000,000 annual ex
pense in cash payments to farmers."
Against Profit Tax
Fagan agreed with Landon's oppo
sition to the administration's tax on
undistributed corporation profits. He
felt that a revised income tax sys
tem could remove the evil which the
present tax seeks to do—the fact that
unincorporated enterprises paid
large personal income taxes on prof
its while large corporations paid
only a small tax.
Roosevelt s method of raising
funds for unemployment insurance
by a 3 per cent pay-roll tax does not
put too great a strain on the workers
as Landon claims, the professor de
clared.
"The workers are the ones who
will benefit in the long run. This
social security system just with
holds some of the workers' purchas
ing power until such a time as he
will need it," he said.
Different Tax Theories
Though both parties stress taxa
lion based upon ability to pay, Fagan
fcaid their purposes of taxation were
different. "The Republicans believe
in direct taxation for revenue means
only, while the Democrats believe in
taxing the wealthy to provide for
economic equilibrium as the business
cycle runs its course."
When the time comes next month
to vote, Fagan told the students that
they would have to decide for them
selves. "What the candidates say in
their speeches now is not necessarily
what they'll do if elected," he said.
Although he made it quite clear
that he was playing no political fa
vorites and was attempting complete
objectivity, Elmer D. Fagan, pro

the box score standing about 3 to 1
in favor of New Deal policies.
