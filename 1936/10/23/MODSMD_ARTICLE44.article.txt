TIME: Thursday night, 10:22Vj at
the crash of the gong: Tinkle tinkle.
PLACE: Daily wastebasket.
CHARACTERS: Nite ed, sport ed,
three copy-maulers. The latter trio
exists for the sole purpose of fur
nishing sound effects.
Door opens to admit staggering in
dividual dressed in purple and or
ange-colored pajamas. He speaks:
"Oh, she stood out there in the
midnight air . .
Nite ed, interrupting: "Well, slug,
it's about time you decided to show
up. I thought . . (He is inter
rupted by raucous guffaws, but con
tinues.) "I thought that even you,
Timothy Isadore Drofnats, had heard
that we are putting out a newspaper
here."
Drofnots: "Boy, am I good. Last
week my average was 1000. I even
picked the score of a game that won't
be played until next week. It's part
of my secret system to pick games
that won't be played for two weeks.
I'm going into my trance now. Will
you help me, boss?"
(The sport ed immediately obliges,
bashing our hero on the head with a
tripewriter. Then, properly en
tranced, Timothy Isadore begins
mumbling his super-super scores.)

TIME: Thursday night, 10:22Vj at
the crash of the gong: Tinkle tinkle.
PLACE: Daily wastebasket.
CHARACTERS: Nite ed, sport ed,
three copy-maulers. The latter trio
exists for the sole purpose of fur
nishing sound effects.
Door opens to admit staggering in
dividual dressed in purple and or
ange-colored pajamas. He speaks:
"Oh, she stood out there in the
midnight air . .
Nite ed, interrupting: "Well, slug,
it's about time you decided to show
up. I thought . . (He is inter
rupted by raucous guffaws, but con
tinues.) "I thought that even you,
Timothy Isadore Drofnats, had heard
that we are putting out a newspaper
here."
Drofnots: "Boy, am I good. Last
week my average was 1000. I even
picked the score of a game that won't
be played until next week. It's part
of my secret system to pick games
that won't be played for two weeks.
I'm going into my trance now. Will
you help me, boss?"
(The sport ed immediately obliges,
bashing our hero on the head with a
tripewriter. Then, properly en
tranced, Timothy Isadore begins
mumbling his super-super scores.)
