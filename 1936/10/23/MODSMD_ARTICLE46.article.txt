# Equal Terms Seen in S.C., Farm Record
## Indians, Trojans Each Chalk Up Five Wins, One Tied Since '25 
### BY DAVE SWANBERG 
Even-Steven on the long run score
sheet are Stanford and U.S.C., ac
cording to the record book of the
modern Jones - Warner - Thornhill
era. Since Jones came to U.S.C. in
1925 his teams have beaten the Cards
5 times, while Stanford has taken an
equal number from the Trojans. One
game was tied.
Stanford won II! to 9 in 1925,
thanks to Ernie Nevers and Mike
Murphy, who counted for Stan
ford's two scores. In 1 !)2(> the
score was 13-12 in favor of the
Indians. U.S.C., with Morton Kaer
leading the way, scored twice in
the first half.
Laranetta failed to convert both
times, but the Indians came back to
score when Biff Hoffman plunged
over. Trailing in the final quarter
12-6, Hoffman passed 45 yards to
Dick Hyland over the goal. George
Bogue converted, and Stanford went
on to win its first coast champion
ship.
The following year the two
teams battled to a 13-13 tie. For
three quarters Morley Drury ham
mered the Stanford line, and was
indirectly responsible for the Tro
jans' two tallies. Stanford man
aged to score in the second quar
ter on a long pass. In the final
period big Herbie Fleishhacker,
then a sophomore, was injected
into the game, and the redshirts
came to life. With 20 seconds to
play, Fleishhacker passed to Louie
Vincenti for a touchdown. Murphy
failed to convert.
In the 1928 game, Stanford had all
the yardage, but U.S.C. had all the
points. 10-0 was the score. The
Trojans triumphed again in 1929,
7-0. Francis Tappan took a pass
from Marshall Duffield for the only
score.
In 1930 and 1931, U.S.C.'s thun
dering herd consisting of Mohler,
Pinckert, Shaver, and Musick was
far superior to Stanford, the scores
being -11-12 and 19-0 respectively.
Stanford was favored over
U.S.C. in 1932, but the Trojans
played hcads-up ball and contin
ued their winning streak 13-0. *
Then came 1933. In the first quar
ter little Cotton Warburton scam
pered 47 yards over the goal, and
the heavily favored Troy took the
lead 7-0. Then Stanford rallied and
staged a 60-yard march to score
with sophomore Bobby Grayson car
rying the ball over, straight through
U.S.C.'s "invincible" line.
In the last quarter the Cards
boosted their total to 13 when Bill
Corbus booted two field goals to
give the Trojans their first licking
in over 25 starts. It was one of
Stanford's most glorious victories.
1934 saw Stanford's famous
"vowing sophomores," now jun
iors. crush a weak Trojan 16-0.
Grayson scored twice on short
plunges, while Monk Moscrip ac
counted for a conversion and a
field goal.
Last year the two teams battled 58
minutes with no score, but finally
Moscrip came to the rescue with a
field goal, and the highly touted Red
shirts had to be content with a mere
3-0 win.
