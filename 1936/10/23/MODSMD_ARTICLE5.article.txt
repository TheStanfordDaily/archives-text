# Stanford Wants Rhodes Scholar
## Farm Committee Seeks First in Four Years 
### 
Four yeara ago a Staiifuid student
won a Rhodes Scholarship as Ore
gon's nominee. Not since 1930 has
a California candidate become a
Rhodes Scholar.
Therefore, the Stanford nominat
ing committee is making a drive this
year to have a Stanford student win
a scholarship, and is especially anx
ious to contact all persons interested.
Mr. Buck, Room 25A of the Political
Science Department, will interview
any prospects during his regular
office hours and, in addition, from 2
to 4 p.m. Monday, October 26.
Three-Year Course
Winners of Rhodes Scholarships
receive two thousand dollars' worth
of schooling each year for three
years. Two of the three years are
spent at Oxford University, the other
at any school in England or on the
Continent. Thirty-two American
students become Rhodes Scholars
each year.
The process of nomination is most
exacting. The applicant must first be
nominated by the committee of the
American college he attends. He is
next examined by the state commit
tee which selects two out of all ap
plicants to represent the state. In
California there are usually from
forty to fifty applicants.
Thirty-two Go
The forty-eight states art 1 divided
into regional districts of six states
each. The district committee awards
four scholarships each year, making
thirty-two in all from the United
States. This rigid examination plan
was devised to make sure that only
Ihe best of American students rep
resent their country in European
universities.
