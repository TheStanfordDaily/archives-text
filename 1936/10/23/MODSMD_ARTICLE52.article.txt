THORNIIILL LIFTS SCREEN
ON THIS OPTIMISM
All the scribes describe Tiny
Thornhill as coming back from Los
Angeles this week to prepare for
U.S.C. with a "smile on that face"
and saying, "Yes, we can win."
To the man, though, they hold
their heads and ask themselves, "Is
he goofy? Can it be true? Did his
supper rest well with him? The
man knows football and still thinks
Stanford has a chance!"
Well, sed I, the man is not goofy;
his reasoning is straight-forward
and sound. I defy you to find flaws'
in this.
Says Tiny, "Look at the record.
The week before Santa Clara we had
hard luck in losing Paulman and
Coffis, two of our key men. This ne
cessitated a complete change of plans
and play, as no one could handle
their jobs, and worse yet, a change to
be accomplished jn one week of
practice. What happened?
"The kids weren t accustomed to
their new jobs and we lost.
"The next week at Washington
State, with two weeks' practice back
of us, we did better. We played good
ball, good enough to consider our
selves a winning bail team, and lost
by one point.
"The week after lhat was a sort of
a let-down. The hard luck we had
up north and the bad taste it brought
on down here hurt the players—they
had played winning football against
adverse breaks and were beginning
to wonder if a jiny had come. In ad
dition, Hamilton was hurt and made
one more hole to fill.
"With that unsatisfactory week of
practice, we went ahead to tie Ore
gon, a team that had held U.S.C.
scoreless for 3 \'-> quarters. And then,
lo and behold, the Washington State
team that we had nearly beaten
came down to tie U.S.C. last week,
and nearly beat them!"
Do you get that line of reason
ing? Tiny continues:
SEEMS O.K. SO FAR.
DON'T YOU THINK?
"U.S.C. is not unbeatable, as they
were five and six years ago. They
may be, perhaps, next year, but
they still have a few weak spots that

need patching. Our team, though we
lost some valuable men, is in good
shape. We haven't lost anybody
during these two weeks of practice,
and the kids look good to me.
"We're in the same spot as U.S.C.
was last year. They had lost a lot of
ball games, while we had two Coast
championships, and possibly a third,
to defend. They had everything to
gain and nothing to lose, and could
play all kinds of crazy football with
out being blamed. They did that and
got away with it.
'"Our players, instead of having
things break their way, have had the
opposite—a lot of the best have been
lost to injury. That can't last much
longer without becoming funny.
"Yep. I can see a win in this game
because the law of averages is in our
favor, and what's better, the kids
know it."
DAVIS? PECCIANTI?
BERRYMAN? YES? NO?
Talk still goes on about how ef
fective Davey Davis will be tomor
row. Angie Peccianti, first-string
Trojan fullback, will definitely not
play, but Davis and Dick Berryman,
both with torn rib cartilages, may
see more or less action.
Davis' injury is a rupture of the
front mounting of his rib, much like
that Grayson incurred in the Big
Game of 1934, except that Grayson's
was the rear mounting.
An ailment of. this type usually
causes considerable irritation in deep
breathing, and may keep Datfis con
siderably down. On the other hand
the medicos might be able to dope it
up and have the little guy fit to en
gineer his team to a touchdown or
two.
Schindler, too, is on the question
able list—a broken ankle from last
season has considerably weakened
him this year, and he has been out
with charley-horses much of the
season. "Desperate Ambrose" (no
new gag; they called him that in the
seventh grade) is very susceptible
to muscle tie-ups, as his big thigh
muscles are constantly being bat
tered when he carries the ball.
