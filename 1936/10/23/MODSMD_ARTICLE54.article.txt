## Hibbs as Pass – Receiving End Will Be One of Chief Trojan Threats; Two Sophomores Named To Open Battle

Daily Trojan—Sports Editor

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. Los Angeles. Oct. 22
(exclusive). —With midget quarterback Davie Davis back in harness after
suffering a painful rib injury in last Saturday's scoreless game with Wash
ington State College, the U.S.C. football team was pronounced yesterday
by physicians to be in top shape for its tilt with Stanford at Palo Alto
Saturday.
The Trojan coaching staff had feared earlier in the week that the
veteran quarterback would be unable to see service against the Red-

skins Saturday, and Davie's return<
to U.S.C. grid picture boosts Cardinal
and Gold hopes for a victory over
Tiny Thornhill's warriors this week
end.
Davis To Start
Piloting the starting veteran team
will be Davis, Troy's 1936 candidate
for ail-American honors, whose un
canny ability to cross up the oppos
ing defense by mixing running and
passing plays has been responsible
for nearly every U.S.C. score this
season. Coach Jones has tabbed Da
vis as one of the smartest quarter
backs he has ever coached in his
long career as a mentor on the grid
iron.
The starting veterans Will have a
dangerous passing attack with Da
vis doing most of the flinging and
left end Gene Hibbs on the receiving
end. Hibbs, a brother of Jesse Hibbs,
former all - American tackle, has
made several sensational catches this
season and has a habit of snagging
the pigskin right out of the arms of
the opposing secondary defense.
And with Davis—
The remainder of the opening line
up includes: left tackle, Max Belko;
left guard, Bill Radovich; center,
Captain Gil Kuhn; right guard,
Owen Hansen; light tackle, Miles
Norton; right end. Chuck Williams;
blocking halfbacks, Phil Duboski
and Butch Beatty; and fullback,
Dick Berryman.
Of this crew, Berryman and Du
boski are sophomores, while Norton,
a transfer from Santa Ana J.C., will
also be playing his first game against
Stanford.
Rival Vowing Sophs
Coach Jones' sophomore eleven,
composed entirely of first - year
players, is believed by U.S.C. sup
porters to compare favorably with
Stanford's great team of Bobby
Grayson and company. The Trojan
sophs have made no vows as yet,
however, although there seems to
be no doubt that these young
blooded huskies have provided the
punch that has sent the Thundering
Herd cannonballing back into the
national limelight.
Leading this sophomore team into
action when th? youngsters gallop
onto the field near the close of the
first quarter will be Ambie Schin
dler, all-state prep quarterback from
San Diego high school. Schindler
reminds many Trojan supporters of
Racehorse Russell Saunders of U.S.C.
fame a few years ago, inasmuch as
he carries his knees high and drives
with terrific force. Injured in the
Oregon game three weeks ago,
Schindler has had little chance this
season to prove his real worth as a
ball player.
Teams Will Alternate
By alternating these two teams,
the veterans and sophomores, both
of which he considers to be of almost
equal ability, Coach Jones has been
able to wear down the opposition in
every game this season except last
Saturday's game with Washington
State, in which Hollingbery pro
duced a few capable reserves him
self.

The remainder of the opening line
up includes: left tackle, Max Belko;
left guard, Bill Radovich; center,
Captain Gil Kuhn; right guard,
Owen Hansen; light tackle, Miles
Norton; right end. Chuck Williams;
blocking halfbacks, Phil Duboski
and Butch Beatty; and fullback,
Dick Berryman.
Of this crew, Berryman and Du
boski are sophomores, while Norton,
a transfer from Santa Ana J.C., will
also be playing his first game against
Stanford.
Rival Vowing Sophs
Coach Jones' sophomore eleven,
composed entirely of first - year
players, is believed by U.S.C. sup
porters to compare favorably with
Stanford's great team of Bobby
Grayson and company. The Trojan
sophs have made no vows as yet,
however, although there seems to
be no doubt that these young
blooded huskies have provided the
punch that has sent the Thundering
Herd cannonballing back into the
national limelight.
Leading this sophomore team into
action when th? youngsters gallop
onto the field near the close of the
first quarter will be Ambie Schin
dler, all-state prep quarterback from
San Diego high school. Schindler
reminds many Trojan supporters of
Racehorse Russell Saunders of U.S.C.
fame a few years ago, inasmuch as
he carries his knees high and drives
with terrific force. Injured in the
Oregon game three weeks ago,
Schindler has had little chance this
season to prove his real worth as a
ball player.
Teams Will Alternate
By alternating these two teams,
the veterans and sophomores, both
of which he considers to be of almost
equal ability, Coach Jones has been
able to wear down the opposition in
every game this season except last
Saturday's game with Washington
State, in which Hollingbery pro
duced a few capable reserves him
self.

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. Los Angeles. Oct. 22
(exclusive). —With midget quarterback Davie Davis back in harness after
suffering a painful rib injury in last Saturday's scoreless game with Wash
ington State College, the U.S.C. football team was pronounced yesterday
by physicians to be in top shape for its tilt with Stanford at Palo Alto
Saturday.
The Trojan coaching staff had feared earlier in the week that the
veteran quarterback would be unable to see service against the Red-

skins Saturday, and Davie's return<
to U.S.C. grid picture boosts Cardinal
and Gold hopes for a victory over
Tiny Thornhill's warriors this week
end.
Davis To Start
Piloting the starting veteran team
will be Davis, Troy's 1936 candidate
for ail-American honors, whose un
canny ability to cross up the oppos
ing defense by mixing running and
passing plays has been responsible
for nearly every U.S.C. score this
season. Coach Jones has tabbed Da
vis as one of the smartest quarter
backs he has ever coached in his
long career as a mentor on the grid
iron.
The starting veterans Will have a
dangerous passing attack with Da
vis doing most of the flinging and
left end Gene Hibbs on the receiving
end. Hibbs, a brother of Jesse Hibbs,
former all - American tackle, has
made several sensational catches this
season and has a habit of snagging
the pigskin right out of the arms of
the opposing secondary defense.
And with Davis—
