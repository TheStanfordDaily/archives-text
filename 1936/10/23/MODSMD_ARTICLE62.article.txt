# Twiggs Lauds Frosh Golfers
## 
### 
"One of the best frosh teams I have
ever had," exclaimed Coach Eddie
Twiggs when asked about this year's 1
yearling golf prospects.
With three men shooting consist- :
ently in the low 70's and four or five ,
others playing in the "upper 70's and j
low 80's, the Class of '40 should have '
a fine team this year. The frosh have
no schedule as yet, as interscholastic I
competition doesn't begin until win- [
ter and spring quarters.
Heading the ladder of prospective'
frosh team members are Bob Roos, [
Bob Breyer, and Don Kennedy.
These boys, according to Coach i
Twiggs, shoot consistently good golf
and should be watched.
The tryoutees for the frosh team \
have play-offs each week, so all!
freshmen who aspire to places on the !
squad should start immediately in- i
stead of waiting until later.
The ladder as it stands at present j
is as follows:
1. Bob Breyer
2. Bob Roos
3. Don Kennedy
4. Dave MacHaig
5. Jack Showalter
G. Ed Rust
7. Chuck Russell
