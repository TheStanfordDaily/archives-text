### JOE DU PLAIN 
It appears that the soccer game
tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock
between Stanford and San Jose State
is just a routine engagement, but for
Coach Harry Maloney and his
charges it represents a real chance
to get somewhere in the Bay League
race this fall.
Stanford wants this game be
cause victory will keep them in
first place with the winner of the
California-San Francisco engage
ment also scheduled for Saturday.
The outfit that wins the latter
game will be the team to beat.
On the other hand, the Staters
would be gratified to annul a 3-0
defeat that the Red eleven handed
them in the season opener.
On both Wednesday and Thursday
nights, the squad went through stiff
scrimmage periods. Coach Maloney
believes that he has now remedied
the flaws apparent in the San Mateo
draw.
The Redskins will have full
strength for the contest. Captain
Bob Hall was limping the first of
the week because of foot injuries
incurred in the junior college fray,
buf will be in the starting lineup
at center half tomorrow. It is also
definite that George Chalmers and
Pete Knecht will be at the inside
right and inside left posts respec
tively.
The varsity game does not com
plete the soccer picture for the
week-end. Freshman Coach Dick
Bullis will trot out his yearling

eleven this afternoon at 4 o'clock on
the home field for their second tilt
this year. Polytechnic of San Fran
cisco, 1935 city champs, gave the
frosh a 6-0 trimming a few days
ago and the boys hope to regain
favor by drubbing Menlo Junior
College today.
