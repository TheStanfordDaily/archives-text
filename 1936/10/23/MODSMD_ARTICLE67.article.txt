# Disgraceful Occurrences in Paly
## 
### 
My attention has been brought to certain dis
graceful occurrences in Paly last evening,
following a campus S.C. rally.
The public prints probably will say that Stan
ford students, pajama-clad, stormed and toma
toed Palo Alto Theaters, doing property dam
age to The Fox West Coast Theaters.
And this in some people's eyes will be con
sidered disgraceful.
. Yes, there were disgraceful occurrences in
Paly last night, but they were not performed by
Stanford students, but by Palo Alto cops and
by Palo Alto Theater managers. In fact, there
have been a series of disgraceful occurrences
in Palo Alto extending over a long period of
time and it is not so much overt acts, as it is the
smug, Palo Alto view towards life.
Palo Alto Theater managers have reaped, di
rectly and indirectly, a huge amount of trade
from Stanford students. On one night of the
year and on one night only, has Stanford de
manded the courtesy of free admission, and
that admission is for the traditional Pajamarino.
Palo Alto lives like a leech off of Stanford. With
out Stanford she would be a miniature Menlo,
a punk, suburban hot dog villa. Her theaters
live off Palo Alto (and Stanford).
Yet the whole town, theater managers and
all, is pervaded with the idea that we are doing
them a favor to do business with them. Co
incidental with this disgrace comes the an
nouncement that Paly theaters have no intention
of reverting to the 30 cent Rough seats in the
balcony. But they will continue with their 40
cent "summer" prices. That is, if they don't in
tend to raise them.
There is only one power that these birds who
set cops to billy-clubbing Stanford students un
derstand, and that is economic power. I sug
gest that until Paly theaters show some sign
of courtesy in apology for last night, such as a
lower-price balcony section, that STANFORD
BOYCOTT THE FOX WESTCOAST CHAIN
(and set up the radio-phonograph dance parlor
in Lake Lagunita boathouse to prevent resultant
entertainment starvation).
