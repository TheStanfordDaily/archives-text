By what peculiar alchemy John R. Tunis,
made his American Mercury article charging
Stanford football (among others) with profes
sionalism in not known. His transcontinental
perspective on Coast fooibdll has resulted in the
labeling of Stanford's football team as "pro
fessional."
It is a charge easy to make, particularly in an
Eastern critical magazine, but it is a harder one
to prove. The Butler report, subsidized by the
Carnegie Foundation, spent a good deal of
money several years ago, ostensibly to get to
the bottom of college professionalism in ath
letics.
Butler came out to the coast, did several weeks
nosing around, and then returned to the East
After all his pains, the report published was
a spectacular failure, at least from the sports
writers point of view. It revealed nothing that
wasn't already well-known, and it revealed it
in an "objective" way.
Its conclusion was: "The commercialization
of the intercollegiate athletic policy in the
United States is undeniable."
"As matters now stand," it said: "the funda
mental purpose in intercollegiate contests is
financial and commercial. Monetary and ma
terial returns from intercollegiate athletics are
valued far more highly than the returns in
play, sport, and bodiiy and moral well-being."
Why, certainly.
Tunis himself, in Harper's Magazine for No
vember, 1928, commented that huge incomes
and large expenditures are being used to train
a mere handful of players, an athletic program
designed for all the students is often being
neglected, and cited that Stanford University,
with athletic profits of $194,000 spent 57,500 on
intramural (page Wally Brook).
Nov/, Comrade Tunis, after having spent a
summer at the Olympics, and witnout the bene
fit of as much research as the Carnegie hench
men, comes forth with the rather damning state
ment that Southern Cal and Stanford are in
ihc professional class, while California is only
in the semi-professional. Without accurate
background in fact, and there cannot be that
background because nobody knows the facts,
!he article must be based on opinion, and that
opinion based on football success.
It is not possible for anyone to tell the cor
relation between subsidization of athletes and
football success. It is certain that many ath
letes are paid tuition scholarships at Stanford,
most every athlete has a hashing job, a few get
their room free for sinecure positions in frater
nities or with the B.A.C. It is a fact that an ath
lete who spends a fair amount of time on his
books is a cinch to get a tuition scholarship. But
all scholarships administered by the University
are freely published iri the Bawl out, as Mr.
Tunis recommends, and the University makes
no bones about it.

But there is no out-and-out payment of ath
letes. What people are apt to forget is that
Stanford v/ith its high tuition fee has a huge
handicap to overcome over low tuition schools.
Making up the differential is all that tuition
payment does.
How, then, account for the success of Stan
ford football teams? That is easy. Other schools
can offer more money—and do—to the high
school athlete. But the alumni scouts who go
out and drag these boys in to do our exer
cising for us, have a rather subtle appeal. Those
they are really hot for they will bring up to the
campus, particularly in the spring, take them
around, show them Stanford's tremendous ath
letic lay-out, its 9,000 acres to play in, will se
quester them in Stanford fraternities, the frater
nity men show them such life up and down
the highway as is consistent with the Comic
Opera conception of college, they are awed by
the libe's card catalog, the bust of Hermes and
distinguished alumnus, they are introduced to
the Big Shots, and carefully exposed to a few
selected lectures of the Drs. Bailey and Fagan.
In short, they give them a few days from the
life of that mythical individual: The Stanford
Man, and if you think any other college can
touch it at any salary, you're crazy. They play
upon the folks with the idea of how much it
really means to go to college with the excellent
academic reputation, and how much it means to
the Standard Oil and other corporations to say
that you have a Stanford A.B.
In other words, Stanford, with its small stu
dent body, has had its sensational athletic suc
cess, not because it has had to pay its football
players salaries, but because it has not had
to.
As far as overemphasis is concerned, of
course football has been overemphasized at
Stanford. But it is not Stanford that has over
emphasized it, it is the box office.
The simple, economic power of the box-office
has wielded a tremendous effect, and has
made glaring inconsistencies in the University
educational process, but if there is any better
way in which the University could have parried
or countered the effects, I defy Mr. Tunis to
show us.

lete who spends a fair amount of time on his
books is a cinch to get a tuition scholarship. But
all scholarships administered by the University
are freely published iri the Bawl out, as Mr.
Tunis recommends, and the University makes
no bones about it.

But there is no out-and-out payment of ath
letes. What people are apt to forget is that
Stanford v/ith its high tuition fee has a huge
handicap to overcome over low tuition schools.
Making up the differential is all that tuition
payment does.
How, then, account for the success of Stan
ford football teams? That is easy. Other schools
can offer more money—and do—to the high
school athlete. But the alumni scouts who go
out and drag these boys in to do our exer
cising for us, have a rather subtle appeal. Those
they are really hot for they will bring up to the
campus, particularly in the spring, take them
around, show them Stanford's tremendous ath
letic lay-out, its 9,000 acres to play in, will se
quester them in Stanford fraternities, the frater
nity men show them such life up and down
the highway as is consistent with the Comic
Opera conception of college, they are awed by
the libe's card catalog, the bust of Hermes and
distinguished alumnus, they are introduced to
the Big Shots, and carefully exposed to a few
selected lectures of the Drs. Bailey and Fagan.
In short, they give them a few days from the
life of that mythical individual: The Stanford
Man, and if you think any other college can
touch it at any salary, you're crazy. They play
upon the folks with the idea of how much it
really means to go to college with the excellent
academic reputation, and how much it means to
the Standard Oil and other corporations to say
that you have a Stanford A.B.
In other words, Stanford, with its small stu
dent body, has had its sensational athletic suc
cess, not because it has had to pay its football
players salaries, but because it has not had
to.
As far as overemphasis is concerned, of
course football has been overemphasized at
Stanford. But it is not Stanford that has over
emphasized it, it is the box office.
The simple, economic power of the box-office
has wielded a tremendous effect, and has
made glaring inconsistencies in the University
educational process, but if there is any better
way in which the University could have parried
or countered the effects, I defy Mr. Tunis to
show us.
By what peculiar alchemy John R. Tunis,
made his American Mercury article charging
Stanford football (among others) with profes
sionalism in not known. His transcontinental
perspective on Coast fooibdll has resulted in the
labeling of Stanford's football team as "pro
fessional."
It is a charge easy to make, particularly in an
Eastern critical magazine, but it is a harder one
to prove. The Butler report, subsidized by the
Carnegie Foundation, spent a good deal of
money several years ago, ostensibly to get to
the bottom of college professionalism in ath
letics.
Butler came out to the coast, did several weeks
nosing around, and then returned to the East
After all his pains, the report published was
a spectacular failure, at least from the sports
writers point of view. It revealed nothing that
wasn't already well-known, and it revealed it
in an "objective" way.
Its conclusion was: "The commercialization
of the intercollegiate athletic policy in the
United States is undeniable."
"As matters now stand," it said: "the funda
mental purpose in intercollegiate contests is
financial and commercial. Monetary and ma
terial returns from intercollegiate athletics are
valued far more highly than the returns in
play, sport, and bodiiy and moral well-being."
Why, certainly.
Tunis himself, in Harper's Magazine for No
vember, 1928, commented that huge incomes
and large expenditures are being used to train
a mere handful of players, an athletic program
designed for all the students is often being
neglected, and cited that Stanford University,
with athletic profits of $194,000 spent 57,500 on
intramural (page Wally Brook).
Nov/, Comrade Tunis, after having spent a
summer at the Olympics, and witnout the bene
fit of as much research as the Carnegie hench
men, comes forth with the rather damning state
ment that Southern Cal and Stanford are in
ihc professional class, while California is only
in the semi-professional. Without accurate
background in fact, and there cannot be that
background because nobody knows the facts,
!he article must be based on opinion, and that
opinion based on football success.
It is not possible for anyone to tell the cor
relation between subsidization of athletes and
football success. It is certain that many ath
letes are paid tuition scholarships at Stanford,
most every athlete has a hashing job, a few get
their room free for sinecure positions in frater

show us.
By what peculiar alchemy John R. Tunis,
made his American Mercury article charging
Stanford football (among others) with profes
sionalism in not known. His transcontinental
perspective on Coast fooibdll has resulted in the
labeling of Stanford's football team as "pro
fessional."
It is a charge easy to make, particularly in an
Eastern critical magazine, but it is a harder one
to prove. The Butler report, subsidized by the
Carnegie Foundation, spent a good deal of
money several years ago, ostensibly to get to
the bottom of college professionalism in ath
letics.
Butler came out to the coast, did several weeks
nosing around, and then returned to the East
After all his pains, the report published was
a spectacular failure, at least from the sports
writers point of view. It revealed nothing that
wasn't already well-known, and it revealed it
in an "objective" way.
Its conclusion was: "The commercialization
of the intercollegiate athletic policy in the
United States is undeniable."
"As matters now stand," it said: "the funda
mental purpose in intercollegiate contests is
financial and commercial. Monetary and ma
terial returns from intercollegiate athletics are
valued far more highly than the returns in
play, sport, and bodiiy and moral well-being."
Why, certainly.
Tunis himself, in Harper's Magazine for No
vember, 1928, commented that huge incomes
and large expenditures are being used to train
a mere handful of players, an athletic program
designed for all the students is often being
neglected, and cited that Stanford University,
with athletic profits of $194,000 spent 57,500 on
intramural (page Wally Brook).
Nov/, Comrade Tunis, after having spent a
summer at the Olympics, and witnout the bene
fit of as much research as the Carnegie hench
men, comes forth with the rather damning state
ment that Southern Cal and Stanford are in
ihc professional class, while California is only
in the semi-professional. Without accurate
background in fact, and there cannot be that
background because nobody knows the facts,
!he article must be based on opinion, and that
opinion based on football success.
It is not possible for anyone to tell the cor
relation between subsidization of athletes and
football success. It is certain that many ath
letes are paid tuition scholarships at Stanford,
most every athlete has a hashing job, a few get
their room free for sinecure positions in frater
nities or with the B.A.C. It is a fact that an ath
lete who spends a fair amount of time on his
books is a cinch to get a tuition scholarship. But
all scholarships administered by the University
are freely published iri the Bawl out, as Mr.
Tunis recommends, and the University makes
no bones about it.

But there is no out-and-out payment of ath
letes. What people are apt to forget is that
Stanford v/ith its high tuition fee has a huge
handicap to overcome over low tuition schools.
Making up the differential is all that tuition
payment does.
How, then, account for the success of Stan
ford football teams? That is easy. Other schools
can offer more money—and do—to the high
school athlete. But the alumni scouts who go
out and drag these boys in to do our exer
cising for us, have a rather subtle appeal. Those
they are really hot for they will bring up to the
campus, particularly in the spring, take them
around, show them Stanford's tremendous ath
letic lay-out, its 9,000 acres to play in, will se
quester them in Stanford fraternities, the frater
nity men show them such life up and down
the highway as is consistent with the Comic
Opera conception of college, they are awed by
the libe's card catalog, the bust of Hermes and
distinguished alumnus, they are introduced to
the Big Shots, and carefully exposed to a few
selected lectures of the Drs. Bailey and Fagan.
In short, they give them a few days from the
life of that mythical individual: The Stanford
Man, and if you think any other college can
touch it at any salary, you're crazy. They play
upon the folks with the idea of how much it
really means to go to college with the excellent
academic reputation, and how much it means to
the Standard Oil and other corporations to say
that you have a Stanford A.B.
In other words, Stanford, with its small stu
dent body, has had its sensational athletic suc
cess, not because it has had to pay its football
players salaries, but because it has not had
to.
As far as overemphasis is concerned, of
course football has been overemphasized at
Stanford. But it is not Stanford that has over
emphasized it, it is the box office.
The simple, economic power of the box-office
has wielded a tremendous effect, and has
made glaring inconsistencies in the University
educational process, but if there is any better
way in which the University could have parried
or countered the effects, I defy Mr. Tunis to
show us.
