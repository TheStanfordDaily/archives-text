The Pi Phi's have a way of holding their men. After
the Oregon game, the Pi Phi's responded to an an
nouncement that two children were lost. With hu
manitarian sentiments developed in such worth while
charities as the Convalescent Home Drive, Masque
Ball Queen Contest, the Rally Committee, and Cardi
nals, the Pi Phi's took a li'l white chile and a pickaninny
(age 8 years) home to dinner with them.
Somebody suggested a show. So the women went
upstairs to comb their hair. After 15 minutes or so, the
gentlemen in waiting got tired.
"Hey," they said.
"What's the matter?"
"Let's go."
"Oh, were you waiting? Just a minute."
After 15 minutes:
"Hey."
"Just a minute."
After 15 more:
"Hey."
"What's your hurry?"
"Let's go."
Finally, the women came down with their hair
combed, and everyone went to a show.
But just to prove that the Pi Phi's can hold their
men, the fact must be revealed that despite the waiting
and the Pi Phi's exacting demands upon his time, the
li'l pickaninny whose stepmother is very kind drops
into the Pi Phi house for meals about twice a week
these days.
