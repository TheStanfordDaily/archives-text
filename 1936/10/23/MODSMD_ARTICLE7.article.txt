# Parade Down Row Starts Off S.C. Pajamarino
## Rally Officially Ends At Pavilion; S. C. Leader Praises School Spirit 
### BILL MOSES 
Amidst the blaring fanfare of
Klaxon horns, the beginning of the
S.C. rally went rolling noisily down
the Row last night. While the Stan
ford band and a torchlight brigade
of screaming frosh enthusiasts led
the way down Lasuen and over to
the Basketball Pavilion, cars loaded
with rooters "barreled"' around cor
ners and sped over the dusty library
field to the S.C. rally.
Inside the crowded Pavilion, the
Stanford band swung into action
while upperclassmen yelled, "To
hell with '40.
Johnson Praises Spirit
Webb Jones introduced A.S.S.U.
President Jim Reynolds, who, before
introducing S.C. Student Body Pres
ident Norm Johnson, said, "I don't
believe we have ever had a rally to
equal this one tonight."
Norm Johnson spoke with praise
about the very satisfactory spirit that
always characterized every Stan
ford-S.C. game. "We at S.C. have
always liked the clean, keen spirit
of competition that has been preva
lent in every football game We have
played with Stanford." Mr. Johnson
also spoke of S.C.'s relations with
U.C.L.A., which he termed were
"similar to Stanford's relations with
the University of California."
Thornhill Hopes
Yells were given for both Reynolds
and Johnson. Then Webb Jones
presented Bobby Grayson to the
rally. Keynote of Grayson's speech
was, "I know that after the game is
over Saturday, the Cardinal will
again be waving."
Coach Tiny Thornhill gave the
next speech. High-light of Thorn
hill's talk was, "I think we will have
a great team on the field Saturday.
Let's hope so!"
Webb Jones led a skyrocket yell
for Coach Tiny Thornhill, and then
introduced the guest speaker of thf>
evening, Sportscaster Don Thomp
son. Thompson added a serious note
to the rally by saying that the root
ing section must work for the team
just as the team is working for them.
In concluding, Thompson said, "Be
ing from the North, I would like to
see Stanford win for two reasons.
First, I'd like to see the Trojans
beaten; second, I want to see this
squad play the game I think they
can."
The rally broke up after a "Give
'Em the Axe" yell, at the end of
which a big, wooden Indian let the
Trojan horse have it "riglft in the
neck—there!"

to the rally by saying that the root
ing section must work for the team
just as the team is working for them.
In concluding, Thompson said, "Be
ing from the North, I would like to
see Stanford win for two reasons.
First, I'd like to see the Trojans
beaten; second, I want to see this
squad play the game I think they
can."
The rally broke up after a "Give
'Em the Axe" yell, at the end of
which a big, wooden Indian let the
Trojan horse have it "riglft in the
neck—there!"
Amidst the blaring fanfare of
Klaxon horns, the beginning of the
S.C. rally went rolling noisily down
the Row last night. While the Stan
ford band and a torchlight brigade
of screaming frosh enthusiasts led
the way down Lasuen and over to
the Basketball Pavilion, cars loaded
with rooters "barreled"' around cor
ners and sped over the dusty library
field to the S.C. rally.
Inside the crowded Pavilion, the
Stanford band swung into action
while upperclassmen yelled, "To
hell with '40.
Johnson Praises Spirit
Webb Jones introduced A.S.S.U.
President Jim Reynolds, who, before
introducing S.C. Student Body Pres
ident Norm Johnson, said, "I don't
believe we have ever had a rally to
equal this one tonight."
Norm Johnson spoke with praise
about the very satisfactory spirit that
always characterized every Stan
ford-S.C. game. "We at S.C. have
always liked the clean, keen spirit
of competition that has been preva
lent in every football game We have
played with Stanford." Mr. Johnson
also spoke of S.C.'s relations with
U.C.L.A., which he termed were
"similar to Stanford's relations with
the University of California."
Thornhill Hopes
Yells were given for both Reynolds
and Johnson. Then Webb Jones
presented Bobby Grayson to the
rally. Keynote of Grayson's speech
was, "I know that after the game is
over Saturday, the Cardinal will
again be waving."
Coach Tiny Thornhill gave the
next speech. High-light of Thorn
hill's talk was, "I think we will have
a great team on the field Saturday.
Let's hope so!"
Webb Jones led a skyrocket yell
for Coach Tiny Thornhill, and then
introduced the guest speaker of thf>
evening, Sportscaster Don Thomp
son. Thompson added a serious note
to the rally by saying that the root
ing section must work for the team
just as the team is working for them.
