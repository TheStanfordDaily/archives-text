FREE SPEECH, OK LOOSE TALK
LARKSPUR, Oct. 22.â€”There arc three things the
average man thinks he can do: extinguish a fire, pub
lish a newspaper, and be President.
And, without wanting to seem irreverent, the Con
stitution's free speech guarantees have been used by
the average man chiefly to broadcast suggestions to
firemen, editors, and Chief Executives.
Neither the complexity of the subject nor necessary
occupation with his bread and butter can stop the flood
of his utterly uninformed advice and rash criticism.
It's just human nature to be a cracker-barrel Aunt
Bella.
I don't suppose there was a cracker barrel any
where in (he Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Tuesday.
But that didn't stop America's Chief Aunt BHla, final
product of the world's most careful anthropological
sampling. By years of practice and through hereditary
impulse, he managed to give the finest cracker-barrel
talk in possibly the best cracker-barrel environment in
the entire campaign.
With generalized criticism he implied generalized
remedies for America's ills. And the chief remedy was
not sulphur and molasses, but more and better cracker
barreling by other average men.
Like the vast number who cheered him, the cham
pion averager stood not for one chicken in every pot,
but 125,000,000 fingers in every pie.
The gist of his talk was: "Roosevelt didn't do so
awful bad, just did it without asking you and me."
The idea was, of course, that Roosevelt had stifled free
spcech when he didn't poll all America and its be
fuddled representatives on delicate and immediate
questions of national policy.
The Great Average obviously didn't understand the
mechanics of Reciprocal trade agreements, monetary
juggling, and the deep-set economic purpose behind
such relief measures as the PWA And Roosevelt,
realizing the necessity for immediate action, didn't
consult them. The job needed experts, and Roosevelt
gave it experts.
For once, we had government without benefit of
cracker barrel. And it has worked. It even satisfied
many people. But it can never satisfy the man who
doesn't care how badly a thing is done as long as he
has a hand in its doinf.
