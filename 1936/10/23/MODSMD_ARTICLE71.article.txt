IT SEEMS TO US that Bob Pres
nell was unnecessarily vitriolic in
his comments in Chaparral on Stan
ford's former "Royal Family of the
Drama." True enough it was that
little group was regarded with no
great amount of cordiality by the
rest of Stanford, and true enough it
was that they did take an esoteric
attitude which was riling, to say the
least, but it cannot be denied that
they were men and women of abil
ity, distinct assets to the Stanford
stage, providers of many moments of
enjoyment for the undistinguished
rest of us.
Although no love was lost between
the members of that group and yours
very truly, we feel their passing is a
decided loss to the campus, a loss to
be regretted.
DISTINGUISHED HONORS DE
PARTMENT: Cranston Chamberlain,
recently added to the KFRC con
tinuity department, was once hit by
a golf ball driven by the Prince of
Wales, now King Edward VIII of
England.—CßS publicity release.
PHIL HARRIS cultivates that
drawl Sunday nights for a very good
reason. Without it, he sounds ex
actly like Jack Benny, which, con
sidering they're on the same pro
gram, might prove just a little con
fusing.
FRED ALLEN, viewing in retro
spect his four years on the air, says,
"Looking back over my radio ca
reer, I find it has brought me enough
money to pay for the nervous break
down it's causing, enough fame to
make up for turning me into a bag
gy-eyed hermit, and enough laughs
to drown out the sound of my
gnashing teeth.
"When I took to the air I though
it was just a lark. Little did I dream
it was a whole flock of parrots.
Those were the days when top
comedians were still getting away
with dressed-up vaudeville rou
tines. I tried a couple myself. My
Crossley rating was so low they
typed it in radium so it would show
up in the cellar. Now, however, we
seem to have hit on a workable
formula.
"Personally, I am fairly content.
All I hope is my relatives never find
out what I'm doing. They're so proud
of me. They think I'm first violin
ist in a prison band."
