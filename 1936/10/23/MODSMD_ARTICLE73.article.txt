Plaudits to Twentieth Century-
Fox for producing "RAMONA." Lo
retta Young as Ramona and Don
Ameehe as Alessandro turn in per
formances remarkably brilliant for
their sincerity and naturalness.
Kent Taylor is alto well cast as
Phillippe.
Location used in Helen Hunt
Jackson's early California story is
taken from the original setting—the
San Jacinto mountains and the out
lying provinces of early San Diego.
'RAMON AS" main attribute is
that it has been filmed entirely in
Technicolor. Because of this factor,
the picture breathes a breath-taking
charm and quite captivates its au
dience with the beauty of its scenery.
Although the story is an Ameri
can Classic, one cannot help but ad
mire the skillful portrayals of Ra
mona, Alessandro, Phillippe, and his
mother, who is the traditional lady
of the manor type. The senora is set
against her son's marrying Ramona,
who is part Indian, and she is even
more opposed to Ramona's having
anything to do with Alessandro, son
of a famous Indian chief.
"RAMONA" will not be appre
ciated for its familiar plot, but rather
for the sensitive acting of Miss
Young and Don Ameche. If you
have never seen a Technicolor pic
ture, you should not miss this, which,
in our opinion, is the most important
contribution to cinephotography.
"THREE MARRIED MEN," fea
turing Roscoe Karns and Mary
Brian, is a weak story with deplor
able direction.
"LIVE ALONE AND LIKE IT," by
Marjorie Hillis.
This book is the current non-fic
tion best seller for a reason: besides
being witty and cleverly written, it is
practical. As the author says, "At
some time in your life, perhaps only
between husbands, you are likely to
find yourself settling down to a soli
tary existence whether you like it
or not." Miss Hillis, who is a mem
ber of the editorial staff of Vogue,
shows you how to. like it.
The first commandment for the
single woman is "Thou shalt not let
thyself go.'" Just because you are
having dinner alone, do not grab a
snack in the kitchen while garbed in
an old dressing-gown. Instead, put
on your prettiest dress, prepare an
■ attractive tray, and enjoy your meal
on a couch in front of the fireplace.
Or have it in bed, if you will, with a
good book beside you, as the author
suggests in her chapter entitled "The
Joys of a Single Bed."
This cardinal principle of not let
ting things slip applies to house
keeping, interior decorating, and en
tertaining, just as much as to per
sonal appearance. Miss Hillis dem
onstrates in her case histories the
horrible fate ol the "hall-bedroom"

type of individual who expects to be
charming and successful when she
goes out of her cubby-hole but can
not throw off ihe personality ac
quired in her unattractive surround
ings.
The chapter entitled "A Lady and
Her Liquors" is another one full of
useful information. It tells what to
serve and how to serve it, besides
giving a few basic recipes. Another
chapter deals with the single wom
an's entertainment problems and
suggests many Inexpensive ways of
keeping busy in a big city, such as
attending 20 - year - old movies or
eating in foreign restaurants.

It is thought that the secret of
Stradivari's pre-eminence in violin
manufacture lies in the varnish he
used. Its formula has never been
duplicated.

Kent Taylor is alto well cast as
Phillippe.
Location used in Helen Hunt
Jackson's early California story is
taken from the original setting—the
San Jacinto mountains and the out
lying provinces of early San Diego.
'RAMON AS" main attribute is
that it has been filmed entirely in
Technicolor. Because of this factor,
the picture breathes a breath-taking
charm and quite captivates its au
dience with the beauty of its scenery.
Although the story is an Ameri
can Classic, one cannot help but ad
mire the skillful portrayals of Ra
mona, Alessandro, Phillippe, and his
mother, who is the traditional lady
of the manor type. The senora is set
against her son's marrying Ramona,
who is part Indian, and she is even
more opposed to Ramona's having
anything to do with Alessandro, son
of a famous Indian chief.
"RAMONA" will not be appre
ciated for its familiar plot, but rather
for the sensitive acting of Miss
Young and Don Ameche. If you
have never seen a Technicolor pic
ture, you should not miss this, which,
in our opinion, is the most important
contribution to cinephotography.

"LIVE ALONE AND LIKE IT," by
Marjorie Hillis.
This book is the current non-fic
tion best seller for a reason: besides
being witty and cleverly written, it is
practical. As the author says, "At
some time in your life, perhaps only
between husbands, you are likely to
find yourself settling down to a soli
tary existence whether you like it
or not." Miss Hillis, who is a mem
ber of the editorial staff of Vogue,
shows you how to. like it.
The first commandment for the
single woman is "Thou shalt not let
thyself go.'" Just because you are
having dinner alone, do not grab a
snack in the kitchen while garbed in
an old dressing-gown. Instead, put
on your prettiest dress, prepare an
■ attractive tray, and enjoy your meal
on a couch in front of the fireplace.
Or have it in bed, if you will, with a
good book beside you, as the author
suggests in her chapter entitled "The
Joys of a Single Bed."
This cardinal principle of not let
ting things slip applies to house
keeping, interior decorating, and en
tertaining, just as much as to per
sonal appearance. Miss Hillis dem
onstrates in her case histories the
horrible fate ol the "hall-bedroom"

type of individual who expects to be
charming and successful when she
goes out of her cubby-hole but can
not throw off ihe personality ac
quired in her unattractive surround
ings.
The chapter entitled "A Lady and
Her Liquors" is another one full of
useful information. It tells what to
serve and how to serve it, besides
giving a few basic recipes. Another
chapter deals with the single wom
an's entertainment problems and
suggests many Inexpensive ways of
keeping busy in a big city, such as
attending 20 - year - old movies or
eating in foreign restaurants.
