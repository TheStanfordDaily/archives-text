# HE MADE GOOD—HERE'S HOW HE DID IT
## 
### SHARP WHITMORE 
of his class vvlien in
college, and today one of the na
tion's best known news commenta
tors, Sam Hayes is an unusual ex
ample of a Stanford boy who made
good. And as definite as his success
are his opinions as to the vaiue of
college.
'Go for two years," he advises.
"You need two years — it matures
you. But any more, unless you plan
to enter a profession and need tech
nical training, will not add so much
to your value as an employee as
would two years of practical expe
rience."
And he means it. What's more, he
practiced what he preaches. A fresh
man here in 1925, he was chosen to
head his class. He succeeded in ac
complishing more long-needed re
forms than the great majority of fig
urehead frosh presidents. A second
year resulted in better-than-average
grades, far better than average pop
ularity. But after his second year,
Sam Hayes had what he wanted
from college, so he left.
Too Many Benefits
What did he get? "Stanford—and
any other first class college — will
make a man mature along the right
lines. It's a proving ground, and
dves opportunities for a life you
can't lead and contacts you can't
make in business," he explains. "Any
student, unless following a specific

'profession as doctor or lawyer or ir.<
a similar highly trained field, needs
only two years. The last half of a
university career would be more
valuable spent in job-finding and
job-holding."
Hayes is an advocate of starling at
the bottom if the next rung of the
ladder is easily acccssible. Not un
less.
He began work as attendant in a
Richfield service station. It was hard
work. Next he was promoted to
salesman, and advanced directly into
radio woi'k.
Cot job First
The two years of job-getting Hayes
filled in before coming to Stanford
instead of aftei\
He started work on the Chicago
stock exchange. "Make the most of
every opportunity you get," he ad
vises.
He did. At 17 he was the youngest
trader on the exchange, The record
still stands. But job-hunting was his
idea, and experience his aim, so he
tried radio work, then came to south
ern California and at 18 was general
manager for a window blind com
pany. The salesmanship involved
stood him in good stead when he
had the chance he wanted with
Richfield.
He came to Stanford, used to
standing on his own feet and getting
what he wanted. ''Most men go to
college too young," he has decided.
Social Persiflage
Freshmen, in 1925, were wearing
"dinks." Lower classmen were not
allowed to smoke on campus unless
they smoked a corncob pipe. "Queen
ing"—talking to a woman on cam
pus—was forbidden. Sophs took
their position seriously, expending
much energy in hazing luckless
frosh.
Hayes rebelled. Most of the sophs
who attempted to make his life mis

erable with juvenile
were younger than he. He went to
President Wilbur, got permission to
incite the class of '29 to rebellion.
They rebelled, under his leadership.
And within a year dinks were out
lawed, corncob pipes were seldom
seen, and conversation was carried
on as a matter of course on campus
as well as off.
Wilbur told him at that time that
he was the first student with enough

initiative to abolish rules which 4
should have gone years ago. "I'm
for you," Hayes was told.
Activities Valuable
Hayes denied taking the frosh
presidency for publicity, although he
thinks the contacts and experience
an office-holder gets are a help after
graduation. He took his position se
riously, because he saw reforms to
be made and intended to make them.
Leading his class was the best way.

A student doesn't need money,
thinks Hayes. He came on a scholar
ship given by a Hollywood men's
club. But working at a full-time job,
and attending classes at the same
time is too much of a strain, he feels.
Full self-support is out of the ques
tion. He suggests instead the years
of work before college.

Hayes' college experiences will ap
