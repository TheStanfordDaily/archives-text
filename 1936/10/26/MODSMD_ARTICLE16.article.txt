COULD BE CHEAP
The Editor, Sir:
Who said we wanted any $50,000
entertainment place on the campus,
as Mr. Roth suggests? Such a thing
would be entirely out of place; we
don't want the Lagunita boathouse to
look like the Casino at Catalina
Island. The idea which has met so
many people's approval was, I be
lieve, to fix up the boathouse as an
informal clubhouse. The setting is
perfect; to make the boathouse less
rustic would ruin its appeal.
The boathouse is sturdier than it
looks. I doubt if it would need any
bracing for dancing upstairs. New

flooring would have to be laid, a new
roofing job done, and windows in
stalled. The cost of this plus a radio
phonograph, a few articles of furni
ture, and incidental items for deco
ration should not come to more than
eight or nine hundred dollars. Com
pared to the $50,000 suggested by
Mr. Roth, this is negligible, and yet it
would give us a clubhouse of moun
tain-lodge motif to fulfill a real need
of this campus.
