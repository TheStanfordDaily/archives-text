There is nothing the New Deal has
so far done that could not have been
done better by an earthquake. A
first-rate earthquake, from coast to
coast, could have re-established
scarcity much more effectively, and
put all survivors to work for the
greater glory of Big Business—with
far more speed and far less noise
than the New Deal. — Stolberg and
Vinton.
Beggars mounted run their horses
to death.—Shakespeare
