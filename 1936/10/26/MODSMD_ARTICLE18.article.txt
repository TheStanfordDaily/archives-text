# MINOR SPORTSTERS SCORE TWO WINS
## Water Polo 
### 
The mighty wooden horse of Troy
may rule supreme on land but he
proved to be decidedly unseaworthy
Saturday morning and a band of
Stanford Indians pulled him apart
plank for plank and lot the pieces
drift to the bottom of Encina Pool.
Three subs appeared in the start
ing line-up for Stanford when the
Indians took to the water for the
Card-U.S.C. water polo game and by
half time Nort Thornton's men were
out in front 4-0. The aqua maestro
then threw in his junior varsity
against the terrible Trojans for the
second half of the battle and still the
final score favored the Red team 9-1.
Bob Allen, junior varsity center
forward, playing in the second half,
was high-point man with three goals.
Chuck Giffin, who has been shifted
from guard to left forward, account
ed for two points in the first half,
and Don Peterson, first-string guard,
tallied two. Bill Hanna and Jack
Loupe each scored once.
