# WE PRESENT TO YOU—THE UNITED END
## 
### 
WHEN the New York Times came
out for Roosevelt it made Jim
Farley's heart leap with joy, but it
must have griped the progressives
and the liberals who backed the
President "because Landon is a crea
ture of Hearst and the Liberty
League."
The Times in its methodical and
hyper-accurate fashion admitted
that there was little difference in is
sues as far as farm and fiscal policy
is concerned, gave Roosevelt the
palm, as Warburg has done, for his
foreign policy, and then proceeded to
prove quite logically that we could
expect no further "radicalism" from
the President.
Reactionary Demos
Says the Times: "An . . . assur
ance against radicalism is the effec
tiveness of the social and economic
measures pursued by the Democratic
Party, though often with funda
mental error and raw materialism,"
and candidly admitted further that
because Roosevelt had the "un
questioned confidence" of the mass
es, that he is the one to continue
leading them, since he isn't as radical
as the left wing of the Democratic
party. (And Marx talked about re
ligion being an opiate.)
Now this sort of loose talk on the
part of a respected reactionary has
brought on the national dyspepsia of
the red-hots, but it is nothing com
pared to the internal disorders of
Stanford's chapter of the intercolle
giate red-hot organization known as
the A.S.U.
The A.S.U. was founded here last
year with considerable noise as the
union of all the liberals and radicals
in a United Front against Fascism,
but the current campaign finds it is
neither united nor a front.
The Disunited
If the left-wing on the campus
were ever to fight reaction, a presi
dential campaign is the time to do it_
but what do we find?
Disaffected Stephen Enke, former
A.S.U. publiicty chairman, is head of
the Young Democrats and consorting
with such bourgeois devices as jolly—
up.';, pins, and badges. Bill Millis,
A.S.U. membership co-chairman,
paddles about the Quad peddling
Thomas pamphlets at 10 cents apiece.
Bissell Magee, A.S.U. labor chair
man, will have nothing but Browder
and Ford; while Owen Ulph, former
archdeacon of dialectical material
ism. looks upon Browder and Ford as
reactionaries.
In short, the intellectual bankrupt
cy of the left wing is at hand. While
other colleges hold protest meetings,
the local A.S.U. is ringed about by
the stifling attitude of the Stanford
student body's smug disregard for
social issues, either conservative or
radical. Added to this is the fact that
the A.S.U. can not take a stand
against anything because it does not
stand for anything. Its membership
is caught by the same intellectual
paralysis that has gripped academic
circles everywhere. The professor's
justification for existence is the de
jfication of human Reason.
Reason Bankrupt
But human reason has not formu
lated a program of action in the
current political grouse-hunting. Try
to pin the faculty members down to
a program of action, and they will
hedge, pleading "objectivity." The
fact of the matter is that the profs
are dedicated to a program of in
action, which is fine for the training
of more professors, but hard as the
devil on political democracy.
Human reason has shown itself in
capable of a decision on the present
campaign. The radicals and liberals
themselves are split over the matter
nf the pragmatism of reason. Mean
while, the political campaign bungles
•ilong. In its insensate, stupid way, it
is more rational, more objective, in
its "free-market" reflection of the
wants of people who do not know
what they want, than are the intel
ects who do not know what Reason
votild want.
Liberalism and Rndicalism cannot
mite in an intelligent attitude
oward the campaign. Professors
cannot agree on an intelligent atti-

tude toward the campaign.
The turn of events has shown that
present-day Democracy will floun
der along in its pressure-group way.

year with considerable noise as the
union of all the liberals and radicals
in a United Front against Fascism,
but the current campaign finds it is
neither united nor a front.
The Disunited
If the left-wing on the campus
were ever to fight reaction, a presi
dential campaign is the time to do it_
but what do we find?
Disaffected Stephen Enke, former
A.S.U. publiicty chairman, is head of
the Young Democrats and consorting
with such bourgeois devices as jolly—
up.';, pins, and badges. Bill Millis,
A.S.U. membership co-chairman,
paddles about the Quad peddling
Thomas pamphlets at 10 cents apiece.
Bissell Magee, A.S.U. labor chair
man, will have nothing but Browder
and Ford; while Owen Ulph, former
archdeacon of dialectical material
ism. looks upon Browder and Ford as
reactionaries.
In short, the intellectual bankrupt
cy of the left wing is at hand. While
other colleges hold protest meetings,
the local A.S.U. is ringed about by
the stifling attitude of the Stanford
student body's smug disregard for
social issues, either conservative or
radical. Added to this is the fact that
the A.S.U. can not take a stand
against anything because it does not
stand for anything. Its membership
is caught by the same intellectual
paralysis that has gripped academic
circles everywhere. The professor's
justification for existence is the de
jfication of human Reason.
Reason Bankrupt
But human reason has not formu
lated a program of action in the
current political grouse-hunting. Try
to pin the faculty members down to
a program of action, and they will
hedge, pleading "objectivity." The
fact of the matter is that the profs
are dedicated to a program of in
action, which is fine for the training
of more professors, but hard as the
devil on political democracy.
Human reason has shown itself in
capable of a decision on the present
campaign. The radicals and liberals
themselves are split over the matter
nf the pragmatism of reason. Mean
while, the political campaign bungles
•ilong. In its insensate, stupid way, it
is more rational, more objective, in
its "free-market" reflection of the
wants of people who do not know
what they want, than are the intel
ects who do not know what Reason
votild want.
Liberalism and Rndicalism cannot
mite in an intelligent attitude
oward the campaign. Professors
cannot agree on an intelligent atti-

tude toward the campaign.
The turn of events has shown that
present-day Democracy will floun
der along in its pressure-group way.

WHEN the New York Times came
out for Roosevelt it made Jim
Farley's heart leap with joy, but it
must have griped the progressives
and the liberals who backed the
President "because Landon is a crea

The Times in its methodical and
hyper-accurate fashion admitted
that there was little difference in is
sues as far as farm and fiscal policy
is concerned, gave Roosevelt the
palm, as Warburg has done, for his
foreign policy, and then proceeded to
prove quite logically that we could
expect no further "radicalism" from
the President.

Says the Times: "An . . . assur

leading them, since he isn't as radical

WHEN the New York Times came
out for Roosevelt it made Jim
Farley's heart leap with joy, but it
must have griped the progressives
and the liberals who backed the
President "because Landon is a crea
ture of Hearst and the Liberty
League."
The Times in its methodical and
hyper-accurate fashion admitted
that there was little difference in is
sues as far as farm and fiscal policy
is concerned, gave Roosevelt the
palm, as Warburg has done, for his
foreign policy, and then proceeded to
prove quite logically that we could
expect no further "radicalism" from
the President.
Reactionary Demos
Says the Times: "An . . . assur
ance against radicalism is the effec
tiveness of the social and economic
measures pursued by the Democratic
Party, though often with funda
mental error and raw materialism,"
and candidly admitted further that
because Roosevelt had the "un
questioned confidence" of the mass
es, that he is the one to continue
leading them, since he isn't as radical
as the left wing of the Democratic
party. (And Marx talked about re
ligion being an opiate.)
Now this sort of loose talk on the
part of a respected reactionary has
brought on the national dyspepsia of
the red-hots, but it is nothing com
pared to the internal disorders of
Stanford's chapter of the intercolle
giate red-hot organization known as
the A.S.U.
The A.S.U. was founded here last
year with considerable noise as the
union of all the liberals and radicals
in a United Front against Fascism,
but the current campaign finds it is
neither united nor a front.
The Disunited
If the left-wing on the campus
were ever to fight reaction, a presi
dential campaign is the time to do it_
but what do we find?
Disaffected Stephen Enke, former
A.S.U. publiicty chairman, is head of
the Young Democrats and consorting
with such bourgeois devices as jolly—
up.';, pins, and badges. Bill Millis,
A.S.U. membership co-chairman,
paddles about the Quad peddling
Thomas pamphlets at 10 cents apiece.
Bissell Magee, A.S.U. labor chair
man, will have nothing but Browder
and Ford; while Owen Ulph, former
archdeacon of dialectical material
ism. looks upon Browder and Ford as
reactionaries.
In short, the intellectual bankrupt
cy of the left wing is at hand. While
other colleges hold protest meetings,
the local A.S.U. is ringed about by
the stifling attitude of the Stanford
student body's smug disregard for
social issues, either conservative or
radical. Added to this is the fact that
the A.S.U. can not take a stand
against anything because it does not
stand for anything. Its membership
is caught by the same intellectual
paralysis that has gripped academic
circles everywhere. The professor's
justification for existence is the de
jfication of human Reason.
