# Powerful Trojan Squad Edges Out Indians, 14-7
## Tiny Praises Team in Defeat; Wehba, Dunn, Calvelli Score in See-Saw Game 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Holding a narrow but ample advantage throughout most of the after
noon, the University of Southern California football varsity ended a three
year drought by defeating Stanford 14-7 in the stadium Saturday, and
thereby proved to those present that El Trojan is really "on the way back."
Still the victory was not the all-important epic that a turnabout in this
hot rivalry series would call for—after the game, though happy over victory,

both U.b.C. rooters and team were*
well contained, with nothing but'
praise for the Stanford team; and Ihe
Indian stalwarts were not nearly so
down in the mouth as the loss might
indicate.
They had lost, but they had played
a good game, and they knew it.
The first quarter was a bit wild,
but very even as to breaks. Ferko's
kick-off was poor to put Stanford at
an immediate disadvantage, but
Davis had a poor punt go out to off
set that little later Vigna fumbled
on his 29 to give the Trojans a good
crack at a score, but they fumbled
after having reached the Stanford 8.
and Stone recovered.
Grant Stone-Brilliant Ballhawk
Stone immediately shone again by
recovering on the Trojan 37 a punt
of Brigham's that Davis had bobbled.
but the Cards paid back by letting
Hansen block Brigham's punt, and
permitting Hibbs to recover for
U.S.C. on their own 41, just where
they had started the period.
Coach Jones at this point sent in
his second or sophomore team,
which, led by Quarterback Ambrose
Schindler, seemed unstopable.
Schindler drove through the center,
sent his halfbacks on reverses at the
tackles, and even passed a few, final
ly passing one to Ray Wehba in his
left flat for a score, the tenth straight
play after Troy had received a punt
on its own 41. Wehba place kicked
to make it 7-0.
The remainder of the first half was
of Stanford plays, mostly incomplete
passes by Tony Calvelli. The throws
all seemed accurate, though hard,
and fault lay in the fact that re
ceivers had to pay more attention to
the S.C. defensive backs than they
could to the oncoming ball.
Third Round to Stanford
The third quarter was for the most
part Stanford's. Davie Davis made a
few good runs and passes, but Cal
velli's passing and kicking, Coffis'
receiving and running, together with
a Trojan punt partially blocked by
Clark, gave the ball to Stanford on
the U.S.C. 26. Nine plays later the
ball was lost on downs — Calvelli,
Coffis, and a pass to Stone, had
reached the two-yard line, but could
not get closer.
The fourth quarter saw Schindler
return to the game to make consist
ent gains, but to bog down on ap
proaching the scoring zone. The next

Trojan score was as sudden as it
was sure—Coye Dunn, big left half,
intercepted one of Brigham's passes
on the Stanford 41, and with power
ful strides through a broken field
with a couple of blockers in front of
him, dashed into the right hand cor
ner of the end zone. Stanley place
kicked to make it 14-0.
Stanford immediately came back
with one of those rushes you dream
about, but it was a little late. Stone
and Clark caught one apiece of Cal
velli's passes, while Doc Luckett
grabbed a third for a brilliant 37-
yard gain to put the ball in scoring
position. Calvelli scored from the
two-yard line on third down, just
six plays and 73 yards from receiv
nig the kick-oc.
Luckett converted to make it 14-7,
the last score of the day, as the game
ended with Schindler again driving
downfield toward the Stanford geal.

but the Cards paid back by letting
Hansen block Brigham's punt, and
permitting Hibbs to recover for
U.S.C. on their own 41, just where
they had started the period.
Coach Jones at this point sent in
his second or sophomore team,
which, led by Quarterback Ambrose
Schindler, seemed unstopable.
Schindler drove through the center,
sent his halfbacks on reverses at the
tackles, and even passed a few, final
ly passing one to Ray Wehba in his
left flat for a score, the tenth straight
play after Troy had received a punt
on its own 41. Wehba place kicked
to make it 7-0.
The remainder of the first half was
of Stanford plays, mostly incomplete
passes by Tony Calvelli. The throws
all seemed accurate, though hard,
and fault lay in the fact that re
ceivers had to pay more attention to
the S.C. defensive backs than they
could to the oncoming ball.
Third Round to Stanford
The third quarter was for the most
part Stanford's. Davie Davis made a
few good runs and passes, but Cal
velli's passing and kicking, Coffis'
receiving and running, together with
a Trojan punt partially blocked by
Clark, gave the ball to Stanford on
the U.S.C. 26. Nine plays later the
ball was lost on downs — Calvelli,
Coffis, and a pass to Stone, had
reached the two-yard line, but could
not get closer.
The fourth quarter saw Schindler
return to the game to make consist
ent gains, but to bog down on ap
proaching the scoring zone. The next

Trojan score was as sudden as it
was sure—Coye Dunn, big left half,
intercepted one of Brigham's passes
on the Stanford 41, and with power
ful strides through a broken field
with a couple of blockers in front of
him, dashed into the right hand cor
ner of the end zone. Stanley place
kicked to make it 14-0.
Stanford immediately came back
with one of those rushes you dream
about, but it was a little late. Stone
and Clark caught one apiece of Cal
velli's passes, while Doc Luckett
grabbed a third for a brilliant 37-
yard gain to put the ball in scoring
position. Calvelli scored from the
two-yard line on third down, just
six plays and 73 yards from receiv
nig the kick-oc.
Luckett converted to make it 14-7,
the last score of the day, as the game
ended with Schindler again driving
downfield toward the Stanford geal.
Holding a narrow but ample advantage throughout most of the after
noon, the University of Southern California football varsity ended a three
year drought by defeating Stanford 14-7 in the stadium Saturday, and
thereby proved to those present that El Trojan is really "on the way back."
Still the victory was not the all-important epic that a turnabout in this
hot rivalry series would call for—after the game, though happy over victory,

both U.b.C. rooters and team were*
well contained, with nothing but'
praise for the Stanford team; and Ihe
Indian stalwarts were not nearly so
down in the mouth as the loss might
indicate.
They had lost, but they had played
a good game, and they knew it.
The first quarter was a bit wild,
but very even as to breaks. Ferko's
kick-off was poor to put Stanford at
an immediate disadvantage, but
Davis had a poor punt go out to off
set that little later Vigna fumbled
on his 29 to give the Trojans a good
crack at a score, but they fumbled
after having reached the Stanford 8.
