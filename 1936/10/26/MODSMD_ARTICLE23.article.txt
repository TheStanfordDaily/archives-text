# Yearlings Lose To UCLA Frosh In Last Minutes
## 
### 
Leading 18-17 with only three I
minutes of play remaining, the Stan- j
ford freshmen saw victory snatched
from them when Kenny Washington, (
the U.C.L.A. yearlings' slipper col
ored fullback, bioke loose for a 45-
yard run. Washington's gallop placed
the pigskin on the Stanford 10, from
where the Bruins drove to the score
that won.
Trailing by 17 points at the end of
the first half, the Stanford young
sters came back wtih an offensive
that tore their opponents' line wide
open and netted them three touch
downs. Tom Walker, halfback, was
the big gun in the Stanford attack,
breaking into the open frequently on
reverse plays.
Two of the frosh scores came in
the third quarter with Chad Reade
and Walker going over. The touch
down that gave the Indian babes
their temporary lead came in the
final period when Reade again cul
minated an Indian drive by smash
ing across for 6 points. All of the
Stanford conversions failed.
This game was a tough one for the
Papoose outfit to lose, inasmuch as it
marked their first defeat of the sea
son, their downfall coming after they
had staged an uphill battle which for
a time seemed destined to give them
victory. ,

With three minutes to go, Wash
ington dropped back as if to pass,
suddenly changed its tactics, and was
away down the field almost ot the
goal line before being dropped by
the desperate Stanford secondary.
Even in losing, the frosh showed
an abundance of power on offense
which should stand them in good
stead against San Mateo J.C. next
Saturday.

The only freedom that a human
being has is the l'ight to die.â€”
