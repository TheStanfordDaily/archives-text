# Straw Polls—What They Seem to Show
## 
### PHILIP W. BUCK 
Assistant Professor of
Political Science
HPHERE is an old proverb which
says that straws show which
way tlie winds are blowing. This year
the straw votes show that the wind?
are blowing in all directions.
A little more than a week ago the
Literary Digest poll gave 32 states
to Mr. Landon, at the same time the
Institute of Public Opinion gave 35
states — with some qualifications for
the doubtful areas—to Mr. Roosevelt.
Obviously there are not enough
states to go round; so somebody is
mistaken.
All of us know that the straw vote
is based upon a trustworthy statis
tical device—the use of a sample.
The modern mystery of statistics is
one of the most awe-inspiring
achievements of this country's cul
ture.
We have discovered that if you
count the spots upon the hide, or the
behavior traits in a maze, of a hun
dred thousand guinea pigs, by sta
tistical analysis you can arrive at a
statistical picture of the spot or be
haviour patterns of a million guinea
pigs. It is possible to predict, with
reasonable certainty, the proportion
of the million which will have spots
aft, and the proportion which will
find the carrot in less than ten min
utes on the third try.
May Analyze Vote
The presumption immediately
rises that man can do with man what
he can do with guinea pigs; adver
tisers therefore make statistical
studies of typical consumer reac
tions, and polls of opinion study the
spots on the voters.
Every college student who has an
swered the questions in an objective
test and in these days what one has
not? knows perfectly well that the
crucial element upon which the ac
curacy of the prediction depends is
the representative character of the
sample.
The Literary Digest poll is based
upon a sample that is now approach
ing two million—nearly a twentieth
of the total number of the probable
maximum vote on November 3. But
the Digest figures reveal what may

turn out to be defects in the sample;
so far nearly three-fifths of their
sample voted Republican in 1932.
j Furthermore, the Digest lists were
j made up in large part from telephone
directories, and while a telephone iu
the house was once a mark of the
native son of California, it may not
| be the token which identives the!
j representative voting group of 1936. !
Sample Secret
The Institute of Public Opinion. I
which displays an opposite result for
the two major parties, has been
much more secretive about the na
ture of its sample. It is possible to
say with some confidence, however.;
that it is using a much smaller sam
ple than the Digest employs, this
alone may invalidate its representa

tive character. Most newspaper polls
show at best the temper of a lo
cality.
The Baltimore Sun has been try
ing, with a fair degree of success, to
poll all the voters in the state who
voted in 1932 and in 1934, and its re
sults give Mr. Roosevelt nearly a 60
per cent majority — but that may
hold true only in Maryland. It is
conceivable that Mr. Farley may
think that as Maryland goes so will
go all the nation—except Maine; it
is reasonably certain that Mr. Ham
ilton will believe that the contrary i
will occur, perhaps even in Mary- |
land.
Saliots Outdated
Even if the sample were a perfect
ly representative one, there is still !

the difficulty of the time element.
None of the polls can canvass their
whole list all at once, by the time
the last ballots are counted the first
are likely to be out of date.
What it comes down to is that at
best the straw vote is statistical
guess. Probably these guesses are
superior to the rheumatic twinges
which guide the politically weather
wise in their feelings as to how the
election will go, because here at
least is the basis, in the sample, for
statistical analysis of the attitudes of
some voters.
They are perhaps injurious in one
respect, there is the presumption
that they may influence the "band
wagon vote," that group of voters
which wants to vote on the winning
side.
It is supposed that this group is
fairly large; and since this election
might be quite close, any group of
fairly large dimensions might have a
decisive effect upon the result. Still.
I incline to the belief that most
American voters will hew to the
party line, and let the straws fall
where they may.
One final observation may be ven
tured. Such is the touching interest
of America in the latest manifesta
tion of our genius for gadgetry, that
the true purpose of the election is
in some danger of being obscured
I sincerely hope that on Novem
ber third we shall vote with the in
tention of electing either Mr. Roose
velt or Mr. Landon, and not with the
idea of proving that either the Di
gest, the Institute, the Sun. or any
other temporary statistical agency
found the sample that typifies the
heart and head of America.

telligent.—John Erskine

test and in these days what one has
not? knows perfectly well that the
crucial element upon which the ac
curacy of the prediction depends is
the representative character of the
sample.
The Literary Digest poll is based
upon a sample that is now approach
ing two million—nearly a twentieth
of the total number of the probable
maximum vote on November 3. But
the Digest figures reveal what may

turn out to be defects in the sample;
so far nearly three-fifths of their
sample voted Republican in 1932.
j Furthermore, the Digest lists were
j made up in large part from telephone
directories, and while a telephone iu
the house was once a mark of the
native son of California, it may not

j representative voting group of 1936. !
Sample Secret
The Institute of Public Opinion. I
which displays an opposite result for
the two major parties, has been
much more secretive about the na
ture of its sample. It is possible to
say with some confidence, however.;
that it is using a much smaller sam
ple than the Digest employs, this
alone may invalidate its representa

tive character. Most newspaper polls
show at best the temper of a lo
cality.
The Baltimore Sun has been try
ing, with a fair degree of success, to
poll all the voters in the state who
voted in 1932 and in 1934, and its re
sults give Mr. Roosevelt nearly a 60
per cent majority — but that may
hold true only in Maryland. It is
conceivable that Mr. Farley may
think that as Maryland goes so will
go all the nation—except Maine; it
is reasonably certain that Mr. Ham
ilton will believe that the contrary i
will occur, perhaps even in Mary- |
land.
Saliots Outdated
Even if the sample were a perfect
ly representative one, there is still !

the difficulty of the time element.
None of the polls can canvass their
whole list all at once, by the time
the last ballots are counted the first
are likely to be out of date.
What it comes down to is that at
best the straw vote is statistical
guess. Probably these guesses are
superior to the rheumatic twinges
which guide the politically weather
wise in their feelings as to how the
election will go, because here at
least is the basis, in the sample, for
statistical analysis of the attitudes of
some voters.
They are perhaps injurious in one
respect, there is the presumption
that they may influence the "band
wagon vote," that group of voters
which wants to vote on the winning
side.
It is supposed that this group is
fairly large; and since this election
might be quite close, any group of
fairly large dimensions might have a
decisive effect upon the result. Still.
I incline to the belief that most
American voters will hew to the
party line, and let the straws fall
where they may.
One final observation may be ven
tured. Such is the touching interest
of America in the latest manifesta
tion of our genius for gadgetry, that
the true purpose of the election is
in some danger of being obscured
I sincerely hope that on Novem
ber third we shall vote with the in
tention of electing either Mr. Roose
velt or Mr. Landon, and not with the
idea of proving that either the Di
gest, the Institute, the Sun. or any
other temporary statistical agency
found the sample that typifies the
heart and head of America.

HPHERE is an old proverb which
says that straws show which
way tlie winds are blowing. This year
the straw votes show that the wind?
are blowing in all directions.
A little more than a week ago the
Literary Digest poll gave 32 states
to Mr. Landon, at the same time the
Institute of Public Opinion gave 35
states — with some qualifications for
the doubtful areas—to Mr. Roosevelt.
Obviously there are not enough
states to go round; so somebody is
mistaken.
All of us know that the straw vote
is based upon a trustworthy statis
tical device—the use of a sample.
The modern mystery of statistics is
one of the most awe-inspiring
achievements of this country's cul
ture.
We have discovered that if you
count the spots upon the hide, or the
behavior traits in a maze, of a hun
dred thousand guinea pigs, by sta
tistical analysis you can arrive at a
statistical picture of the spot or be

pigs. It is possible to predict, with
reasonable certainty, the proportion
of the million which will have spots
aft, and the proportion which will
find the carrot in less than ten min
utes on the third try.

The presumption immediately

think that as Maryland goes so will
go all the nation—except Maine; it
is reasonably certain that Mr. Ham
ilton will believe that the contrary i
will occur, perhaps even in Mary- |
land.
Saliots Outdated
Even if the sample were a perfect
ly representative one, there is still !

the difficulty of the time element.
None of the polls can canvass their
whole list all at once, by the time
the last ballots are counted the first
are likely to be out of date.
What it comes down to is that at
best the straw vote is statistical
guess. Probably these guesses are
superior to the rheumatic twinges
which guide the politically weather
wise in their feelings as to how the
election will go, because here at
least is the basis, in the sample, for
statistical analysis of the attitudes of
some voters.
They are perhaps injurious in one
respect, there is the presumption
that they may influence the "band
wagon vote," that group of voters
which wants to vote on the winning
side.
It is supposed that this group is
fairly large; and since this election
might be quite close, any group of
fairly large dimensions might have a
decisive effect upon the result. Still.
I incline to the belief that most
American voters will hew to the
party line, and let the straws fall
where they may.
One final observation may be ven
tured. Such is the touching interest
of America in the latest manifesta
tion of our genius for gadgetry, that
the true purpose of the election is
in some danger of being obscured
I sincerely hope that on Novem
ber third we shall vote with the in
tention of electing either Mr. Roose
velt or Mr. Landon, and not with the
idea of proving that either the Di
gest, the Institute, the Sun. or any
other temporary statistical agency
found the sample that typifies the
heart and head of America.

HPHERE is an old proverb which
says that straws show which
way tlie winds are blowing. This year
the straw votes show that the wind?
are blowing in all directions.
A little more than a week ago the
Literary Digest poll gave 32 states
to Mr. Landon, at the same time the
Institute of Public Opinion gave 35
states — with some qualifications for
the doubtful areas—to Mr. Roosevelt.
Obviously there are not enough
states to go round; so somebody is
mistaken.
All of us know that the straw vote
is based upon a trustworthy statis
tical device—the use of a sample.
The modern mystery of statistics is
one of the most awe-inspiring
achievements of this country's cul
ture.
We have discovered that if you
count the spots upon the hide, or the
behavior traits in a maze, of a hun
dred thousand guinea pigs, by sta
tistical analysis you can arrive at a
statistical picture of the spot or be
haviour patterns of a million guinea
pigs. It is possible to predict, with
reasonable certainty, the proportion
of the million which will have spots
aft, and the proportion which will
find the carrot in less than ten min
utes on the third try.
May Analyze Vote
The presumption immediately
rises that man can do with man what
he can do with guinea pigs; adver
tisers therefore make statistical
studies of typical consumer reac
tions, and polls of opinion study the
spots on the voters.
Every college student who has an
swered the questions in an objective
test and in these days what one has
not? knows perfectly well that the
crucial element upon which the ac
curacy of the prediction depends is
the representative character of the
sample.
The Literary Digest poll is based
upon a sample that is now approach
ing two million—nearly a twentieth
of the total number of the probable
maximum vote on November 3. But
the Digest figures reveal what may

turn out to be defects in the sample;
so far nearly three-fifths of their
sample voted Republican in 1932.
j Furthermore, the Digest lists were
j made up in large part from telephone
directories, and while a telephone iu
the house was once a mark of the
native son of California, it may not
| be the token which identives the!
j representative voting group of 1936. !
Sample Secret
The Institute of Public Opinion. I
which displays an opposite result for
the two major parties, has been
much more secretive about the na
ture of its sample. It is possible to
say with some confidence, however.;
that it is using a much smaller sam
ple than the Digest employs, this
alone may invalidate its representa

tive character. Most newspaper polls
show at best the temper of a lo
cality.
The Baltimore Sun has been try
ing, with a fair degree of success, to
poll all the voters in the state who
voted in 1932 and in 1934, and its re
sults give Mr. Roosevelt nearly a 60
per cent majority — but that may
hold true only in Maryland. It is
conceivable that Mr. Farley may
think that as Maryland goes so will
go all the nation—except Maine; it
is reasonably certain that Mr. Ham
ilton will believe that the contrary i
will occur, perhaps even in Mary- |
