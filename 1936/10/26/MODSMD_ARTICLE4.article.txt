# THE
						POLITICAL WEEK
## 
### 
Climax of Stanford's political
I strip-teasing comes this week. Com-
I pared to locrfl politics, the national
i election a week from Tuesday fades
| into insignificance.
The campus-wide straw poll con
ducted on the Law Steps by Dave
Allison's election board will be
Thursday, while Pi Sigma Alpha,
political science honorary, will poll
[ the faculty all this week. Results
! will be released simultaneously in
i Friday's Daily.
Wednesday night the all-Uni
-1 versity political assembly sees Bob
Mallet and Bob North. Republicans,
i clash with Bob Hart man and Claude
Owens, Democrats. Presenting the
Socialist case is Charles Lindblom.
The committee is still looking for a
real, live Communist.
In line with University policy of
1 free discussion as long as all sides
are represented, the political debate
I will be presided over by Dr. Ray Ly
i man Wilbur. This is the first time
' the President has chairmanned a
campus political debate.
A straw poll, to determine whether
the debate has caused any of the ait-
I dience to change their politics, will
be taken at the beginning and at the
end of the debate.
The past few weeks have seen the

publicity machine of the local Young
Democrats churning effectively,
while the Young Republicans have
concentrated on their 11 p.m. sem
inars over KGO. Now the Young
Republicans pour it on this week.
Tonight is a meeting of the Young
Republicans at Wilson's on the Ave
nue. Alonzo L. Baker. Republican
candidate for Congress, will speak on j
"Blessed Are Our Children, for They I
Shall Inherit the National Debt." ,
Dinner at 6:30 p.m. for ISO cents,
speech at 7:15. free.
Jim Phillips, president of North
ern California Young Republicans
and Cal graduate, will hold forth on i
the 11 o'clock KGO program tonight !
Biggest blow-out of the season,
however, is the Young Republican's i
free treat at the Palace Hotel. Free
dancing to Bernie Cummin's orches- j
tra, entertainment, and refresh
ments is given to nil students who
hold a Young Republican card. One
card in a party of four is all that will \
be required, according to George
Wingfield of the Zeta Psi house, who
is Young Republican president on
the campus.
Curds may be obtained from i
Wingfield, and Dick Taylor at the '
Zete house, and from Bill Johnstone
at Phi Kappa Sigma.
