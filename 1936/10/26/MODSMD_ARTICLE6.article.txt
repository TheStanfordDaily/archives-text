# MUD SMEARED

### DICK HODGSON 
r |' , HE Plug-Ugly fight, the Wash
ington's Birthday parade, the
baseball fight, the poster fight,
Rough's day, Encina Hall raids —
gradually faded out of the Stanford
panorama as the University has come
of age. The Mud Fight, a stage in
the transition, has stayed the long
est of the lot, but probably will go
too.
Tomorrow night the ruling of Ex
Committee to abolish the Mud Fight
last week becomes effective unless a
petition signed by 50 members of the
student body asking that the abol
ishment of the Mud Fight be put to
a vote of the students is submitted to
A.S.S.U. President Jim Reynolds by
tomorrow.
Mud Fight Dead Before
But this is not the first time that
the Mud Fight has been laid to rest.
Miss Louise Price, director of the
Union unit, has compiled a history of
Stanford traditions and customs with
NYA help, from which most of this
saga of the mudfight has been taken.
Way back in the days when your
alumnus father was a student, there
wasn't a real Mud Fight, but instead
various underclass "rushes" were
held. At the time, it was the fashion
in the large eastern universities such
as Harvard, to hold "can rushes" and
"fence rushes." And as Stanford was
designed to be the "Harvard of the
West," she naturally aped the rah
rah antics of 1890 Harvardites.
The most outstanding of these
rather disorganized rushes occurred
in 1894 when the lower classes
had a long and drawn-out brawl as
to whose class numerals should be
placed on the University water tank.
Fights of similar nature continued to
take place several times each year
until 1906. when the first organized
rush was held.
Free-for-all Football Brawl
This first highly planned affair was
to be in the order of a free-for-all
football game, all the men in each
class taking part. The basic theme
being to carry the ball across the
opponents' goal in any manner pos
sible, and not satisfied with merely
winning this authorized fracas, the
boys closed the day with a fatal
brawl.
The next year, the tie-up was in
novated in place of the rushes. Each
class attempted to tie up its oppon
ents and place them in the "morgue."
A few fears later, in 1910, the poster
fight made its appearance usually
taking pl«ce before the tie-up. The
sophomores put up class posters in
conspicuous places and then the
freshmen would try to tear them
down. This only carried out Ihe idea
of stimulating a bloody brawl, and in
1922 both the poster fight and the
tie-up were discontinued.
First Mud Fight in 1923
In October 1923. the vrst real Mud
Fight was held on the lake bed of
Lagunita. From that year on, the
fight was held on the lake bed until
1928, when it also was discontinued
because of student and faculty criti
cism. This change did not come
about in any sudden fashion, but
arew from complaints over the num
ber of participants that were in
jured and infected from the burrs in
the lake bed and from water polluted
by dead fish that had strayed into
the lake in the spring.
The students, not wishing to do
away with the tradition altogether,
returned to tie-ups in 1929 and 1930.
But in 1931, by a vote taken in both
classes, the Mud Fight was reinstat
ed and held on the football field un
der rulings similar to those used in
last week's encounter.
An anachronism in the days when
there is a disintegration of the old
fierce spirit of student body provin
cialism and extrinsic loyalties, the
Mud Fight has lingered on, as Stan
ford's tribute to a glamorous, if silly,
past.

Sonic people never change their
minds, because their intellectual
wardrobe is so skimpy they wouldn't
have anything to put on if they did.

Mud Fight Dead Before
But this is not the first time that
the Mud Fight has been laid to rest.
Miss Louise Price, director of the
Union unit, has compiled a history of
Stanford traditions and customs with
NYA help, from which most of this
saga of the mudfight has been taken.
Way back in the days when your
alumnus father was a student, there
wasn't a real Mud Fight, but instead
various underclass "rushes" were
held. At the time, it was the fashion
in the large eastern universities such
as Harvard, to hold "can rushes" and
"fence rushes." And as Stanford was
designed to be the "Harvard of the
West," she naturally aped the rah
rah antics of 1890 Harvardites.
The most outstanding of these
rather disorganized rushes occurred
in 1894 when the lower classes
had a long and drawn-out brawl as
to whose class numerals should be
placed on the University water tank.
Fights of similar nature continued to
take place several times each year
until 1906. when the first organized
rush was held.
Free-for-all Football Brawl
This first highly planned affair was
to be in the order of a free-for-all
football game, all the men in each
class taking part. The basic theme
being to carry the ball across the
opponents' goal in any manner pos
sible, and not satisfied with merely
winning this authorized fracas, the
boys closed the day with a fatal
brawl.
The next year, the tie-up was in
novated in place of the rushes. Each
class attempted to tie up its oppon
ents and place them in the "morgue."
A few fears later, in 1910, the poster
fight made its appearance usually
taking pl«ce before the tie-up. The
sophomores put up class posters in
conspicuous places and then the
freshmen would try to tear them
down. This only carried out Ihe idea
of stimulating a bloody brawl, and in
1922 both the poster fight and the
tie-up were discontinued.
First Mud Fight in 1923
In October 1923. the vrst real Mud
Fight was held on the lake bed of
Lagunita. From that year on, the
fight was held on the lake bed until
1928, when it also was discontinued
because of student and faculty criti
cism. This change did not come
about in any sudden fashion, but
arew from complaints over the num
ber of participants that were in
jured and infected from the burrs in
the lake bed and from water polluted
by dead fish that had strayed into
the lake in the spring.

A few fears later, in 1910, the poster
fight made its appearance usually
taking pl«ce before the tie-up. The
sophomores put up class posters in
conspicuous places and then the
freshmen would try to tear them
down. This only carried out Ihe idea
of stimulating a bloody brawl, and in
1922 both the poster fight and the
tie-up were discontinued.
First Mud Fight in 1923
In October 1923. the vrst real Mud
Fight was held on the lake bed of
Lagunita. From that year on, the
fight was held on the lake bed until
1928, when it also was discontinued
because of student and faculty criti
cism. This change did not come
about in any sudden fashion, but
arew from complaints over the num
ber of participants that were in
jured and infected from the burrs in
the lake bed and from water polluted
by dead fish that had strayed into
the lake in the spring.
The students, not wishing to do
away with the tradition altogether,
returned to tie-ups in 1929 and 1930.
But in 1931, by a vote taken in both
classes, the Mud Fight was reinstat
ed and held on the football field un
der rulings similar to those used in
last week's encounter.
An anachronism in the days when
there is a disintegration of the old
fierce spirit of student body provin
cialism and extrinsic loyalties, the
Mud Fight has lingered on, as Stan
ford's tribute to a glamorous, if silly,
past.

Sonic people never change their
minds, because their intellectual
wardrobe is so skimpy they wouldn't
have anything to put on if they did.
