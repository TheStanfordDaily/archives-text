and Bob Thallon, freshmen, are
scheduled to appear before Judge
John Springer of Palo Alto on
charges of malicious mischief and '
disturbing the peace last Thursday j
night during a "raid" on the Varsity
and Stanford Theaters.
But that isn't the whole story.
McDaniel's Story
When plans were being laid by
Rally Committee Chairman T. M.
McDaniel for the rally and pajama
rino last Thursday night, he decided
to contact George Teckemeyer, man
ager of the Stanford Thcafer, and
obtain permission for students to be
admitted free to the theater that
night for the !) o'clock show". McDan
iel states that he sent Dulce Parker
a week before the rally to see Tecke
meyer, who in turn promised to con
fer with Fox West Coast Division
Manager Harry Seipel, but also stat
ed that he thought the chances were
slim for any such arrangement.
Monday, McDaniel says, Miss
Parker again saw Teckemeyer, who
had not as yet seen the division man
ager, but said to call Tuesday. Tues
day came and again no decision had.
been reached. And not until the day
before the rally did the Rally Com
mittee get the definite decision that
students would not be allowed to
crash the show after the rally. Mc-
Daniel warned Teckemeyer that the
freshmen would probably try to gain
admission, but that was far as Rally
Committee directions went, the frosh
would only be instructed to march
down the Row to the Pavilion and
then over to Roble, any further ac
tions would be on their own hook.

Tcckcmcycr Says—
Saturday night, a Daily represen
tative interviewed George Tecke
meyer, Stanford Theater manager, to
get his angle on the affair. Tecke
myer is first reputed to have said
that no imp contacted him at all
j about free student admission for
| Thursday night, but Saturday he de
[ dared that a girl had called him two

or possibly three days before the I
rally and that he had told her after a !
delay of a day or two that he eould I
not grant the Rally Committee's re- j
quest.
Giving as basis for his decision the !
fact that for the last two years, he
had opened the doors to students in
more or less an experiment to see
if they would behave themselves if
let in; but that upon both occasions,
students had conducted themselves
in a manner objectionable to both
theater patrons and the theater. He
stated that three or four years ago
the theater circuit was sued for
$40,000 by a woman who was reputed
to have had her back permanently
injured. According to Seipel, divi
sion manager, the theater settled for
$25,000 out of court. However, this
claimed injury occurred during the
period in which students crashed the
iheater by force of numbers, rather I
than being let in by the management
as they have been the last two years. |
Theater Property Damage
But in addition to wreaking per- ;
sonal injuries to its patrons, the the- |
ater management also cites the i
rather extensive property damage i
done to the theater itself. Tecke- '
meyer came out with the statement
that he himself did not have the au
thority to grant permission, but that
he would be willing to let students
hold a rally in the theater, to lead
songs and yells from the stage, if
♦ hey would also co-operate with the
theater and quiet down when the
picture came on. And so ends the
story of George Teckemeyer.
Now it happens that about three
weeks ago Division Manager Seipel
called Almon E. Roth and offered
the theater to the students to hold a
rally in, if they so desired. (Mr.
Roth, however, did not feel that this
offer meant to include a free show
for rallying students, though it ap- I
pears that Teckemeyer, himself,
would be willing to give the students
this free show in addition to the use
of the theater for a rally.) But at the
time the offer was made Mr. Roth
was very busy and also had been
rather sick, and in the confusion he

had neglected to inform any student
leaders about this offer.
Not a Tradition
Mr. Roth feels strongly, however,
that the students have absolutely no
right to expect a private enterprise,
such as the theater, to provide free
entertainment for Stanford students
if it does not so desire.
He believes that the student action
was entirely unwarranted and that
merely because students had been
legally admitted to the theater for
the past two years, it was no indica
tion that such a performance was
now a "tradition." Mr. Roth also
pointed out that the relationship be
tween Palo Alto residents and the
University had been far above the
average college-town connections,
and that further demonstrations like
that of last Thursday would have to
be definitely dealt with in order to
maintain such favorable relation
ships. And so ends the story of
Comptroller Roth.
Police versus Frosh
And now we have the most con
flicting reports of all, these of the
Palo Alto police versus those of the
rallying or accused "rioting" stu
dents. In a statement Saturday night,
Chief of Police Howard Zink claim
ed, in contradiction to student be
lief, that no tear gas bombs were
used or were even in possession of
the police guarding the theaters, and
more than that, he also claims that
officers did not draw their clubs un
til students rushed the doors of the
Varsity Theater — and even though
they did draw them, they did not use
them.
But presenting rather black and
blue evidence to disprove Zink's
statement, several Stanford fresh
men have displayed backs, discol
ored by the blows of billy clubs laid
on by the police. The Palo Alto hos
pital has no record, however, of
treating injured students up to this
time.
A Blank Cartridge
As to the tomato-throwing epi
sode. one phase has as yet not been
brought to public Inspection. Mat
thcw Van Winkle, freshman, told the
Daily that a policeman standing
next to him shot oft' a blank cart
ridge in an effort to halt the advanc
ing students, and that this action
gave impetus to the student barrage
of tomatoes.
As the barrage got under way,
Kittell and Thallon were separately
arrested for throwing tomatoes and
damaging property. Thallon was ar
rested by Officer Elmer Dakin after
he had been hit in the head with a
tomato, Dakin being able to pick out
Thallon as the conspirator out of
the crowd of over 200 seething stu
dents.
Contrary to stories appearing in
the Palo Alto Times, bystanders re
ported that Kittell was coming out of
a grocery store, having in the brief

period come upon an idea for mak
ing a private profit by selling to
matoes to the students. Kittell was
standing wtih his back to the crowd,
when a policeman, who saw the to
matoes in his hand, charged at him
and knocked him down on the pave
ment. It is then that Kittell, an
gered at the action, is reputed to
have thrown the tomato directly into
the face of the officer.
And so end the stories of Chief
Zink, and accused Kittell, and Thal
lon.
Tomorrow's Daily will follow with
the story of Police Judge Springer.

Saturday night, a Daily represen
tative interviewed George Tecke
meyer, Stanford Theater manager, to
get his angle on the affair. Tecke
myer is first reputed to have said
that no imp contacted him at all
j about free student admission for
| Thursday night, but Saturday he de
[ dared that a girl had called him two

or possibly three days before the I
rally and that he had told her after a !
delay of a day or two that he eould I
not grant the Rally Committee's re- j
quest.
Giving as basis for his decision the !
fact that for the last two years, he
had opened the doors to students in
more or less an experiment to see
if they would behave themselves if
let in; but that upon both occasions,
students had conducted themselves
in a manner objectionable to both
theater patrons and the theater. He
stated that three or four years ago
the theater circuit was sued for
$40,000 by a woman who was reputed
to have had her back permanently
injured. According to Seipel, divi
sion manager, the theater settled for
$25,000 out of court. However, this
claimed injury occurred during the
period in which students crashed the
iheater by force of numbers, rather I
than being let in by the management
as they have been the last two years. |
Theater Property Damage
But in addition to wreaking per- ;
sonal injuries to its patrons, the the- |
ater management also cites the i
rather extensive property damage i
done to the theater itself. Tecke- '
meyer came out with the statement
that he himself did not have the au
thority to grant permission, but that
he would be willing to let students
hold a rally in the theater, to lead
songs and yells from the stage, if
♦ hey would also co-operate with the
theater and quiet down when the
picture came on. And so ends the
story of George Teckemeyer.
Now it happens that about three
weeks ago Division Manager Seipel
called Almon E. Roth and offered
the theater to the students to hold a
rally in, if they so desired. (Mr.
Roth, however, did not feel that this
offer meant to include a free show
for rallying students, though it ap- I
pears that Teckemeyer, himself,
would be willing to give the students
this free show in addition to the use
of the theater for a rally.) But at the
time the offer was made Mr. Roth
was very busy and also had been
rather sick, and in the confusion he

had neglected to inform any student
leaders about this offer.
Not a Tradition
Mr. Roth feels strongly, however,
that the students have absolutely no
right to expect a private enterprise,
such as the theater, to provide free
entertainment for Stanford students
if it does not so desire.
He believes that the student action
was entirely unwarranted and that
merely because students had been
legally admitted to the theater for
the past two years, it was no indica
tion that such a performance was
now a "tradition." Mr. Roth also
pointed out that the relationship be
tween Palo Alto residents and the
University had been far above the
average college-town connections,
and that further demonstrations like
that of last Thursday would have to
be definitely dealt with in order to
maintain such favorable relation
ships. And so ends the story of
Comptroller Roth.
Police versus Frosh
And now we have the most con
flicting reports of all, these of the
Palo Alto police versus those of the
rallying or accused "rioting" stu
dents. In a statement Saturday night,
Chief of Police Howard Zink claim
ed, in contradiction to student be
lief, that no tear gas bombs were
used or were even in possession of
the police guarding the theaters, and
more than that, he also claims that
officers did not draw their clubs un
til students rushed the doors of the
Varsity Theater — and even though
they did draw them, they did not use
them.
But presenting rather black and
blue evidence to disprove Zink's
statement, several Stanford fresh
men have displayed backs, discol
ored by the blows of billy clubs laid
on by the police. The Palo Alto hos
pital has no record, however, of
treating injured students up to this
time.
A Blank Cartridge
As to the tomato-throwing epi
sode. one phase has as yet not been
brought to public Inspection. Mat
thcw Van Winkle, freshman, told the
Daily that a policeman standing
next to him shot oft' a blank cart
ridge in an effort to halt the advanc
ing students, and that this action
gave impetus to the student barrage
of tomatoes.
As the barrage got under way,
Kittell and Thallon were separately
arrested for throwing tomatoes and
damaging property. Thallon was ar
rested by Officer Elmer Dakin after
he had been hit in the head with a
tomato, Dakin being able to pick out
Thallon as the conspirator out of
the crowd of over 200 seething stu
dents.
Contrary to stories appearing in
the Palo Alto Times, bystanders re
ported that Kittell was coming out of
a grocery store, having in the brief

period come upon an idea for mak
ing a private profit by selling to
matoes to the students. Kittell was
standing wtih his back to the crowd,
when a policeman, who saw the to
matoes in his hand, charged at him
and knocked him down on the pave
ment. It is then that Kittell, an
gered at the action, is reputed to
have thrown the tomato directly into
the face of the officer.
And so end the stories of Chief
Zink, and accused Kittell, and Thal
lon.
Tomorrow's Daily will follow with
the story of Police Judge Springer.

McDaniel's Story
When plans were being laid by
Rally Committee Chairman T. M.
McDaniel for the rally and pajama
rino last Thursday night, he decided
to contact George Teckemeyer, man
ager of the Stanford Thcafer, and
obtain permission for students to be
admitted free to the theater that
night for the !) o'clock show". McDan
iel states that he sent Dulce Parker
a week before the rally to see Tecke
meyer, who in turn promised to con
fer with Fox West Coast Division
Manager Harry Seipel, but also stat
ed that he thought the chances were
slim for any such arrangement.
Monday, McDaniel says, Miss
Parker again saw Teckemeyer, who
had not as yet seen the division man
ager, but said to call Tuesday. Tues
day came and again no decision had.
been reached. And not until the day
before the rally did the Rally Com
mittee get the definite decision that
students would not be allowed to
crash the show after the rally. Mc-
Daniel warned Teckemeyer that the
freshmen would probably try to gain
admission, but that was far as Rally
Committee directions went, the frosh
would only be instructed to march
down the Row to the Pavilion and
then over to Roble, any further ac
tions would be on their own hook.

songs and yells from the stage, if
♦ hey would also co-operate with the
theater and quiet down when the
picture came on. And so ends the
story of George Teckemeyer.
Now it happens that about three
weeks ago Division Manager Seipel
called Almon E. Roth and offered
the theater to the students to hold a
rally in, if they so desired. (Mr.
Roth, however, did not feel that this
offer meant to include a free show
for rallying students, though it ap- I
pears that Teckemeyer, himself,
would be willing to give the students
this free show in addition to the use
of the theater for a rally.) But at the
time the offer was made Mr. Roth
was very busy and also had been
rather sick, and in the confusion he

had neglected to inform any student
leaders about this offer.
Not a Tradition
Mr. Roth feels strongly, however,
that the students have absolutely no
right to expect a private enterprise,
such as the theater, to provide free
entertainment for Stanford students
if it does not so desire.
He believes that the student action
was entirely unwarranted and that
merely because students had been
legally admitted to the theater for
the past two years, it was no indica
tion that such a performance was
now a "tradition." Mr. Roth also
pointed out that the relationship be
tween Palo Alto residents and the
University had been far above the
average college-town connections,
and that further demonstrations like
that of last Thursday would have to
be definitely dealt with in order to
maintain such favorable relation
ships. And so ends the story of
Comptroller Roth.
Police versus Frosh
And now we have the most con
flicting reports of all, these of the
Palo Alto police versus those of the
rallying or accused "rioting" stu
dents. In a statement Saturday night,
Chief of Police Howard Zink claim
ed, in contradiction to student be
lief, that no tear gas bombs were
used or were even in possession of
the police guarding the theaters, and
more than that, he also claims that
officers did not draw their clubs un
til students rushed the doors of the
Varsity Theater — and even though
they did draw them, they did not use
them.
But presenting rather black and
blue evidence to disprove Zink's
statement, several Stanford fresh
men have displayed backs, discol
ored by the blows of billy clubs laid
on by the police. The Palo Alto hos
pital has no record, however, of
treating injured students up to this
time.
A Blank Cartridge
As to the tomato-throwing epi
sode. one phase has as yet not been
brought to public Inspection. Mat
thcw Van Winkle, freshman, told the
Daily that a policeman standing
next to him shot oft' a blank cart
ridge in an effort to halt the advanc
ing students, and that this action
gave impetus to the student barrage
of tomatoes.
As the barrage got under way,
Kittell and Thallon were separately
arrested for throwing tomatoes and
damaging property. Thallon was ar
rested by Officer Elmer Dakin after
he had been hit in the head with a
tomato, Dakin being able to pick out
Thallon as the conspirator out of
the crowd of over 200 seething stu
dents.
Contrary to stories appearing in
the Palo Alto Times, bystanders re
ported that Kittell was coming out of
a grocery store, having in the brief

period come upon an idea for mak
ing a private profit by selling to
matoes to the students. Kittell was
standing wtih his back to the crowd,
when a policeman, who saw the to
matoes in his hand, charged at him
and knocked him down on the pave
ment. It is then that Kittell, an
gered at the action, is reputed to
have thrown the tomato directly into
the face of the officer.
And so end the stories of Chief
Zink, and accused Kittell, and Thal
lon.
Tomorrow's Daily will follow with
the story of Police Judge Springer.

McDaniel's Story
When plans were being laid by
Rally Committee Chairman T. M.
McDaniel for the rally and pajama
rino last Thursday night, he decided
to contact George Teckemeyer, man
ager of the Stanford Thcafer, and
obtain permission for students to be
admitted free to the theater that
night for the !) o'clock show". McDan
iel states that he sent Dulce Parker
a week before the rally to see Tecke
meyer, who in turn promised to con
fer with Fox West Coast Division
Manager Harry Seipel, but also stat
ed that he thought the chances were
slim for any such arrangement.
Monday, McDaniel says, Miss
Parker again saw Teckemeyer, who
had not as yet seen the division man
ager, but said to call Tuesday. Tues
day came and again no decision had.
been reached. And not until the day
before the rally did the Rally Com
mittee get the definite decision that
students would not be allowed to
crash the show after the rally. Mc-
Daniel warned Teckemeyer that the
freshmen would probably try to gain
admission, but that was far as Rally
Committee directions went, the frosh
would only be instructed to march
down the Row to the Pavilion and
then over to Roble, any further ac
tions would be on their own hook.

Saturday night, a Daily represen
tative interviewed George Tecke
meyer, Stanford Theater manager, to
get his angle on the affair. Tecke
myer is first reputed to have said
that no imp contacted him at all
j about free student admission for
| Thursday night, but Saturday he de
[ dared that a girl had called him two

or possibly three days before the I
rally and that he had told her after a !
delay of a day or two that he eould I
not grant the Rally Committee's re- j
quest.
Giving as basis for his decision the !
fact that for the last two years, he
had opened the doors to students in
more or less an experiment to see
if they would behave themselves if
let in; but that upon both occasions,
students had conducted themselves
in a manner objectionable to both
theater patrons and the theater. He
stated that three or four years ago
the theater circuit was sued for
$40,000 by a woman who was reputed
to have had her back permanently
injured. According to Seipel, divi
sion manager, the theater settled for
$25,000 out of court. However, this
claimed injury occurred during the
period in which students crashed the
iheater by force of numbers, rather I
than being let in by the management
as they have been the last two years. |

rather extensive property damage i

rallying or accused "rioting" stu
dents. In a statement Saturday night,
Chief of Police Howard Zink claim
ed, in contradiction to student be
lief, that no tear gas bombs were
used or were even in possession of
the police guarding the theaters, and
more than that, he also claims that
officers did not draw their clubs un
til students rushed the doors of the
Varsity Theater — and even though
they did draw them, they did not use
them.
But presenting rather black and
blue evidence to disprove Zink's
statement, several Stanford fresh
men have displayed backs, discol
ored by the blows of billy clubs laid
on by the police. The Palo Alto hos
pital has no record, however, of
treating injured students up to this

A Blank Cartridge
As to the tomato-throwing epi
sode. one phase has as yet not been
brought to public Inspection. Mat
thcw Van Winkle, freshman, told the
Daily that a policeman standing
next to him shot oft' a blank cart
ridge in an effort to halt the advanc
ing students, and that this action
gave impetus to the student barrage
of tomatoes.
As the barrage got under way,
Kittell and Thallon were separately
arrested for throwing tomatoes and
damaging property. Thallon was ar
rested by Officer Elmer Dakin after
he had been hit in the head with a
tomato, Dakin being able to pick out
Thallon as the conspirator out of
the crowd of over 200 seething stu
dents.
Contrary to stories appearing in
the Palo Alto Times, bystanders re
ported that Kittell was coming out of
a grocery store, having in the brief

period come upon an idea for mak
ing a private profit by selling to
matoes to the students. Kittell was
standing wtih his back to the crowd,
when a policeman, who saw the to
matoes in his hand, charged at him
and knocked him down on the pave
ment. It is then that Kittell, an
gered at the action, is reputed to
have thrown the tomato directly into
the face of the officer.
And so end the stories of Chief
Zink, and accused Kittell, and Thal
lon.
Tomorrow's Daily will follow with
the story of Police Judge Springer.

McDaniel's Story
When plans were being laid by
Rally Committee Chairman T. M.
McDaniel for the rally and pajama
rino last Thursday night, he decided
to contact George Teckemeyer, man
ager of the Stanford Thcafer, and
obtain permission for students to be
admitted free to the theater that
night for the !) o'clock show". McDan
iel states that he sent Dulce Parker
a week before the rally to see Tecke
meyer, who in turn promised to con
fer with Fox West Coast Division
Manager Harry Seipel, but also stat
ed that he thought the chances were
slim for any such arrangement.
Monday, McDaniel says, Miss
Parker again saw Teckemeyer, who
had not as yet seen the division man
ager, but said to call Tuesday. Tues
day came and again no decision had.
been reached. And not until the day
before the rally did the Rally Com
mittee get the definite decision that
students would not be allowed to
crash the show after the rally. Mc-
Daniel warned Teckemeyer that the
freshmen would probably try to gain
admission, but that was far as Rally
Committee directions went, the frosh
would only be instructed to march
down the Row to the Pavilion and
then over to Roble, any further ac
tions would be on their own hook.
And so ends the story of T. M. Mc-
DsnkL
Tcckcmcycr Says—
Saturday night, a Daily represen
tative interviewed George Tecke
meyer, Stanford Theater manager, to
get his angle on the affair. Tecke
myer is first reputed to have said
that no imp contacted him at all
j about free student admission for
| Thursday night, but Saturday he de
[ dared that a girl had called him two

or possibly three days before the I
rally and that he had told her after a !
delay of a day or two that he eould I
not grant the Rally Committee's re- j
quest.
Giving as basis for his decision the !
fact that for the last two years, he
had opened the doors to students in
more or less an experiment to see
if they would behave themselves if
let in; but that upon both occasions,
students had conducted themselves
in a manner objectionable to both
theater patrons and the theater. He
stated that three or four years ago
the theater circuit was sued for
$40,000 by a woman who was reputed
to have had her back permanently
injured. According to Seipel, divi
sion manager, the theater settled for
$25,000 out of court. However, this
claimed injury occurred during the
period in which students crashed the
iheater by force of numbers, rather I
than being let in by the management
as they have been the last two years. |
Theater Property Damage
But in addition to wreaking per- ;
sonal injuries to its patrons, the the- |
ater management also cites the i
rather extensive property damage i
done to the theater itself. Tecke- '
meyer came out with the statement
that he himself did not have the au
thority to grant permission, but that
he would be willing to let students
hold a rally in the theater, to lead
songs and yells from the stage, if
♦ hey would also co-operate with the
theater and quiet down when the
picture came on. And so ends the
story of George Teckemeyer.
Now it happens that about three
weeks ago Division Manager Seipel
called Almon E. Roth and offered
the theater to the students to hold a
rally in, if they so desired. (Mr.
Roth, however, did not feel that this
offer meant to include a free show
for rallying students, though it ap- I
pears that Teckemeyer, himself,
would be willing to give the students
this free show in addition to the use
of the theater for a rally.) But at the
time the offer was made Mr. Roth
was very busy and also had been
rather sick, and in the confusion he

had neglected to inform any student
leaders about this offer.
Not a Tradition
Mr. Roth feels strongly, however,
that the students have absolutely no
right to expect a private enterprise,
such as the theater, to provide free
entertainment for Stanford students
if it does not so desire.
He believes that the student action
was entirely unwarranted and that
merely because students had been
legally admitted to the theater for
the past two years, it was no indica
tion that such a performance was
now a "tradition." Mr. Roth also
pointed out that the relationship be
tween Palo Alto residents and the
University had been far above the
average college-town connections,
and that further demonstrations like
that of last Thursday would have to
be definitely dealt with in order to
maintain such favorable relation
ships. And so ends the story of
Comptroller Roth.
