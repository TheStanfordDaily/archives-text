### DAVE BOTSFORD 
irrevocable contract between
the Stanford band and the Asso
ciated Oil Company and a defective
public-address system marred an
otherwise almost perfect afternoon
for Cardinal rooters Saturday.
When Webb Jones, head yell lead
er, began to get the rooters' section
lined up for card stunts at the half.
Bud Fisher and his band romped
into "Come Join the Band" for the
radio audience. Loud as Jones could
shout through his microphone was
n't loud enough. The men in the
stands couldn't hear him.
Band Plays On
T. M. McDaniel, Rally Committee
chairman, tried to get Fisher to stop
the band long enough for Jones to
instruct the rooters. But Fisher's
boys played on.
Yesterday a check-up revealed
that Fisher could not, without vio
lating the band's iron-bound con
tract with the oil company, silence
the music. It had been prearranged
that Ihe minute Southern Califor
nia's band left the field the Stanford
band would go out over the net
works for six solid minutes. There
was no other way. Despite pleas of
Jones and McDaniel, Fisher contin
ued to wave his baton.
The row or two of girls seated be
hind the band complained, however,
that one of the drummers, angered
because another drummer failed to
keep time, yelled, "You G —d d—mn
ed " so loud that "it's a won
der a thousand radio sets didn't
strain their tubes."
Defective P.A. System
Also at fault for between-the
halves rooter confusion was the yell
leaders' public address system
which ex-Student Manager Bob
Gros declares has been "a white ele
phant from the first." Saturday it
worked fine for a while, then when
needed the most, sputtered.
When purchased by the A.S.S.U.
several years ago it cost $700, was
really too inexpensive for a good
public address system. Since then
the student body has spent large
amounts on it because of defections.
All last week it was being over
hauled, worked clearly at Saturday
night's dance. But apparently it
wasn't good enough in the beginning
for football games.
Rooters Well Organized
j The rooting section itself was well
| organized except for a minor mis
calculation on seating room. When
the section was filled there were still
two empty rows between the men
and the women. McDaniel remedied
that after the first quarter by moving
the women up two rows. He at first
tried to get men rooters down from
the top bul they refused to move.
From across the field came reports
that Stanford's yells carried clearly
and distinctly and that the card
stunts, those that band music didn't
| mess up, made up in finesse what
| they lacked in originality.
The one new stunt, the moving!
sky-rocket, went off well except that j
the various colors didn't contrast i
enough. The expensive gold, silver,,
and glittering blue cards were not i
noticeable in the dull shadows of the I
Stanford side.
New note in clieer "leading was
Charles Edward Holiday, 8-year-old
chocolate protege of Pi Beta Phi.
Lost at the Oregon game, little !
Charles was taken to dinner by the !
Pi Phi's, fed at that house twice a i
week since. Now Webb Jones has
snapped him up as an unofficial
mascot.
The north goal posts came down,
yes, but the main S.C. rooting section
had nothing to do with it. A score
of excited boys pulled them down.
For the Washington game Novem- I

ber 7, when card stunts will again be
used, all concerned claim planning
ahead will erase the "interdepart
mental inefficiency"' apparent last
Saturday.

amounts on it because of defections.
All last week it was being over
hauled, worked clearly at Saturday
night's dance. But apparently it
wasn't good enough in the beginning
for football games.
Rooters Well Organized
j The rooting section itself was well
| organized except for a minor mis
calculation on seating room. When
the section was filled there were still
two empty rows between the men
and the women. McDaniel remedied
that after the first quarter by moving
the women up two rows. He at first
tried to get men rooters down from
the top bul they refused to move.
From across the field came reports
that Stanford's yells carried clearly
and distinctly and that the card
stunts, those that band music didn't
| mess up, made up in finesse what
| they lacked in originality.
The one new stunt, the moving!
sky-rocket, went off well except that j
the various colors didn't contrast i
enough. The expensive gold, silver,,
and glittering blue cards were not i
noticeable in the dull shadows of the I
Stanford side.
New note in clieer "leading was
Charles Edward Holiday, 8-year-old
chocolate protege of Pi Beta Phi.
Lost at the Oregon game, little !
Charles was taken to dinner by the !
Pi Phi's, fed at that house twice a i
week since. Now Webb Jones has
snapped him up as an unofficial
mascot.
The north goal posts came down,
yes, but the main S.C. rooting section
had nothing to do with it. A score
of excited boys pulled them down.
For the Washington game Novem- I

ber 7, when card stunts will again be
used, all concerned claim planning
ahead will erase the "interdepart
mental inefficiency"' apparent last
Saturday.
irrevocable contract between
the Stanford band and the Asso
ciated Oil Company and a defective
public-address system marred an
otherwise almost perfect afternoon
for Cardinal rooters Saturday.
When Webb Jones, head yell lead
er, began to get the rooters' section
lined up for card stunts at the half.
Bud Fisher and his band romped
into "Come Join the Band" for the
radio audience. Loud as Jones could
shout through his microphone was
n't loud enough. The men in the
stands couldn't hear him.
Band Plays On
T. M. McDaniel, Rally Committee
chairman, tried to get Fisher to stop
the band long enough for Jones to
instruct the rooters. But Fisher's
boys played on.
Yesterday a check-up revealed
that Fisher could not, without vio
lating the band's iron-bound con
tract with the oil company, silence
the music. It had been prearranged
that Ihe minute Southern Califor
nia's band left the field the Stanford
band would go out over the net
works for six solid minutes. There
was no other way. Despite pleas of
Jones and McDaniel, Fisher contin
ued to wave his baton.
The row or two of girls seated be
hind the band complained, however,
that one of the drummers, angered
because another drummer failed to
keep time, yelled, "You G —d d—mn
ed " so loud that "it's a won
der a thousand radio sets didn't
strain their tubes."
Defective P.A. System
Also at fault for between-the
halves rooter confusion was the yell
leaders' public address system
which ex-Student Manager Bob
Gros declares has been "a white ele
phant from the first." Saturday it
worked fine for a while, then when
needed the most, sputtered.
When purchased by the A.S.S.U.
several years ago it cost $700, was
really too inexpensive for a good
public address system. Since then
the student body has spent large
amounts on it because of defections.
