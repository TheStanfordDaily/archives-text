# Wheels of Justice Grind Exceeding Fine
## Thallon Case Continued as Officer Cites Torn Pants, Kittell Gets 25 Honrs on City Woodpile 
### 
One torn pair of pants —one continuation.
The trousers belonging to Sergeant Elmer Dakan of
the Palo Alto police force were introduced as last
minute evidence yesterday in Judge Springer's police
court giving Freshman Bob Thallon a continuation
until today in his hearing on a disturbing the peace
charge.
Thallon is one of the two freshmen arrested during
the post-rally brawl in Palo Alto last Thursday night.
♦ Later in the day, Allan Kittell, Thallon's erstwhile
room mate in the city jail and alleged partner in crime,
was sentenced to 25 hours on the city woodpile, and
given until December 1 to work out the hours.
Charges of malicious mischief against the pair were
dropped after some discussion. In Kittell's case it was
the court's opinion that the charge might more prop
erly be one of battery since he was said to have thrown
a tomato which hit an officer in the face.
Proper restitution for damage to officer Dakin's
trousers will be discussed in Thallon's hearing today.
Thallon expressed fear yesterday that difficulty would
arise if he is also sentenced to the woodpile. He said
he had classes all day Tuesdays and Thursdays, the
time allotted for city wood chopping.
One student in the court room questioned the lia
bility of Thallon for damage to an officer's uniform. He
asked: "If a policeman broke his billy club over the
head of a person, would the person hit be liable for the
damage to the club?"
Meanwhile no student boycott of the Palo Alto
theater had been effectively organized, and no peace
offering in the form of lowered balcony prices had
been tendered to Stanford students by theater opera
tors. According to some observers this was because of
the phenomenal drawing power of "The Great Zieg
field" currently showing at the Varsity.

"The hole in my pants was this hig," he declared in Palo Alto court yes

for Sergeant Dakin's torn pants.
