# Campus Names Appropriate to Farm
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
The names of the dormitories on
the Stanford campus are admirably
suited to the Farm, for all, with the
exception of Branner and Jordon
Halls, have botanical names.
Encina means live o;ik and the hall
itself, according to David Starr Jor
dan in his "Days of a Man," repeats
on a large scale that of a finely
situated hotel at Silva Plana in the
Swiss Engadine, wheer the Stanfords
once spent a happy holiday."
So They Built Rohle
No dormitory for the women was
at first planned because it seemed
advisable to eliminate 'he women
until better facilities could be pro
vided, but on the plea of Mrs Stan
ford that it would be better to in
clude them from the beginning, a
dormitory was built and given the
name of another species of the live
oak, Roble. This was the first build
ing on the campus to use reinforced
concrete.
Toyon is known on the Pacific-
Coast as the Christmas Berry or
California Holly, while the redwood
tree is responsible for the name of
Sequoia, reputedly the last outpost
of the Rou«h

As for the smaller living groups
that compose the Union unit: The
Mariposa Lily, iPne, and Manzanita
are found in abundance in the Sier
ras, and Madrono trees in the Santa
Cruz mountains. Elm Cottage is
surrounded by the tree of that name.
In front of Dr. Gardner's former
residence stands a Hawthorne tree
and the naming of the Oaks and the
Acorns is self-evident.
Lagunita means little lake, but its
four casas bear the names of Euca
liplo, Magnolia, Naranja (citrus), and
Adelpho (Oleander).
History gives us the names of the
streets and other places familiar to
the student.
"Tall Tree"
In March of 1776, Lieutenant Col
onel Juan Bautista Anza gave the
name of "Palo Alto" to the Indian
Rancheria on Arroyo de San Fran
cisquito. El Palo Alto is the tall
wcatherbeaten Redwood tree situ
ated on the north corner of the
Farm. This 950-year-old tree, the
survivor of two, was later adopted
as the oflieial seal of the University.
On Palm Drive, the Fan Palm of
San Diego is alternated with the
Canary Island Date. The Bavshore

was originally a bridle path con
necting the Mission at Santa Clara
with Mission Dolores in San Fran
cisco.
Alvarado Row, entering Portola by
the Library parking lot bears the
name of Juan B .Alvarado. an early
governor of California. Salvatierra,
parallel to it, was named for the Jes
uit father in Mexico who was instru
mental in the founding of the mis
sions.
Recalling the Fathers
Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Sena Street running the length of
the front of the quad recall the
famous padre in early California
history, and the Row is named for
his successor, Lasuen. Cabrillo Ave
nue near the Hoover home was
named for the first explorer and Por
tola on which Branner Hall faces,
for the first governor. Arguello, a
later governor, is namesake of the
street in front of Toyon.
As for the streets in Palo Alio,
look them up on a map and you'll
find most of them named for famous
colleges, Amherst, Columbia, Dart
mouth, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell,
as hii attempt of a college town te
attain an atmosphere, perhaps.

The names of the dormitories on

Encina means live o;ik and the hall

No dormitory for the women was
