# President Wilbur To Lead Pre-Election, All-Party Debate Tomorrow Night
## Forum To Foster Political Opinions on Coming Presidential Election 
### 
An all-party pre-election debate
and forum fill be presented to
morrow night at 7:30 in the Assem
bly Hall, led by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur.
The forum, introduced in 1924,
aims to foster political opinion on
presidential elections, and preclude
campaigning on the campus by out
side politicos.
New Forensics Form
A new forensic form for this de
bate has been planned by Debate
Manager Jim Hill. Following a regu
lar team debate between two Demo
cratic and two Republican speakers,
a Communist party representative
will present his side's views. A
speaker for the Socialist party will
conclude the forum.
Upholding the Democratic point
of view will be Robert Hartmann
and Richard Owenr, while Republi
can speakers will be Robert Mallelt
and Robert North. These two teams
will hold a non-decision debate,
which will precede the Communist
side of the story, to be presented
by Robert Harrover. Concluding
speaker of the evening will be So
cialist Ed Lindblom.
An innovation for this forum will
be a vote to be taken both before
and after the speeches, testing the
audience's ability to retain their
original political views after hear
ing campaign .speeches.
Gros Pro Team Chairman
Chairman of the pro team of the
forum will be Bob Gros, faculty ad
visor for Debating. He will intro
duce Dr. Wilbur. This will be the
first time in the history of the forum,
that Dr. Wilbur has personally con
ducted the debates.
Commenting upon them, Dr. Wil
bur said: "We are all gratified to
have the students take an interest
in (he political events that are going
on in this country.
Wilbur Comments
"Since there are inevitable differ
ences of opinion, and widely varied
points of view, a general meeting in
which partisan expressions â€žcan be
made by 'members of the Student
body is apt to be both interesting and
helpful.
"This plan of having the different
sides represented at a common meet
ing is the best answer we have been
able to find at Stanford for the ques
tion of partisan politics in relation to
the University.
"It is sometimes disappointing to
find out how much of politics is pure
emotion, but in an institution like
ours there should be some good,
solid thinking and a discussion of
the principles of government which
are involved in the coming election."
