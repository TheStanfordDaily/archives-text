# Simpson Trial Set for Today
## Archbishop May Decide To Dodge Coronation 
### 
IPSWICH, England, Oct. 26 (UP).
—Mrs. Ernest (Wally) Simpson's
brief divorce hearing in Ipswich as
sizes will be called promptly at 2:15
p.m. tomorrow, and 10 minutes later
—if there is no hitch—King Edward's
American friend will have discarded
her second husband and again will
be free to marry.
Mrs. Simpson is expected to testi
fy and then to present two witnesses
for brief corroboration. Her hus
band is not likely to appear. He is
not defending the suit.
Divorced persons may not remarry
in England until the decree is made
final six months after it is granted.
Mrs. Simpson's friends say she is
not contemplating marriage with the
King, but a large part of the May
fair circle, in which they have been
seen together so often, believes oth
erwise.
On the eve of Mrs. Simpson's di
vorce, Fleet Street — London's
"Newspaper Row" — tonight was
startled by a report that the Arch
bishop of Canterbury has decided it
may be impossible for him to officiate
at the coronation of King Edward
next May.
It is known that the aged ecclesi
astic is opposed to the King's asso
ciation with Mrs. Simpson.

The Iberians were an ancient peo
ple living at the mouth of the Iberus
River in eastern Spain.
