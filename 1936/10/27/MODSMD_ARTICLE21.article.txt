The talk of the British government
gagging the American press con
cerning this business of the King of
England and lady friend is just so
much foolishness, consequently I am
at liberty this morning to quote the
chizzle-pussed sage of Alvarado
Row.
The sage suggests that Mr. Simp
son could make a fortune by writing
a book entitled, "My Love Life with
the Queen of England." But then Mr.
Simpson isn't that kind of a guy, and
possibly he feels something like
Vice-President Throttlebottom of
"Let 'Em Eal Cake," who married
Diana Deveraux to save internation
al complications and then thought it
was sort of strange when the French
ambassador came along with them
on their honeymoon.
* * *
The Simpson affair, though, isn't
funny-paper stuff, and probably no
one feels this more strongly than that
forgotten woman of the hour. Queen
Mary. It is easy enough for the
wisecrack squad to rib the King's
mother about her birds-nest hats
and her reverence for social con
ventions where her son is concerned,
but unfortunately in this case, con
vention and outward decorum are
not just Puritan bugaboos. When it
comes to the King, necessity should
make a virtue of keeping up appear
ances.
It is easy enough to say that the
King of England is entitled to marry
whom he pleases just like any other
man. Only Edward isn't just another
one of the Windsor boys. He is the
King of England, and as the sour
iiussed sage of Alvarado Row has
observed, the English royal family
Mas gotten along pretty well where
other royal families have failed just
because they have been model rep
esentatives of middle-class, Church
of-England virtue.
That Mrs. Simpson is an American,
a commoner, and married for the
econd time makes for all kinds of
: rouble, but from this side of the At
antic, it could seem that the dis
closure of wedding plans practically
imultaneously with the divorce suit
is the worst faux pas of all.
* * *
Social convention is a cruel and
powerful thing. It takes no great
originality to point out that almost
everything about the great jugger
naut of "what people think" is out of
Dint. The story of Antony and
Cleopatra is the classic example of
vvhat back-fence gossip can do. Not
hat Antony particularly minded los
ng Rome, but he lost it neverthe
less.
1 do not suggest that King Edward
will iose his throne over Mrs. Simp
son. But he is a self-willed man. and
as the smaller fry and the clergy be-
to heckle his behavior, he will

no doubt reply by further flaunting
tradition in their faces.
And the result will be something
more than a tempest in a teapot.

the Queen of England." But then Mr.
Simpson isn't that kind of a guy, and
possibly he feels something like
Vice-President Throttlebottom of
"Let 'Em Eal Cake," who married
Diana Deveraux to save internation
al complications and then thought it
was sort of strange when the French
ambassador came along with them
on their honeymoon.
* * *
The Simpson affair, though, isn't
funny-paper stuff, and probably no
one feels this more strongly than that
forgotten woman of the hour. Queen
Mary. It is easy enough for the
wisecrack squad to rib the King's
mother about her birds-nest hats
and her reverence for social con
ventions where her son is concerned,
but unfortunately in this case, con
vention and outward decorum are
not just Puritan bugaboos. When it
comes to the King, necessity should
make a virtue of keeping up appear
ances.
It is easy enough to say that the
King of England is entitled to marry
whom he pleases just like any other
man. Only Edward isn't just another
one of the Windsor boys. He is the
King of England, and as the sour
iiussed sage of Alvarado Row has
observed, the English royal family
Mas gotten along pretty well where
other royal families have failed just
because they have been model rep
esentatives of middle-class, Church
of-England virtue.
That Mrs. Simpson is an American,
a commoner, and married for the
econd time makes for all kinds of
: rouble, but from this side of the At
antic, it could seem that the dis
closure of wedding plans practically
imultaneously with the divorce suit
is the worst faux pas of all.
* * *
Social convention is a cruel and
powerful thing. It takes no great
originality to point out that almost
everything about the great jugger
naut of "what people think" is out of
Dint. The story of Antony and
Cleopatra is the classic example of
vvhat back-fence gossip can do. Not
hat Antony particularly minded los
ng Rome, but he lost it neverthe
less.
1 do not suggest that King Edward
will iose his throne over Mrs. Simp
son. But he is a self-willed man. and
as the smaller fry and the clergy be-
to heckle his behavior, he will

no doubt reply by further flaunting
tradition in their faces.
And the result will be something
more than a tempest in a teapot.

The talk of the British government
gagging the American press con
cerning this business of the King of
England and lady friend is just so
much foolishness, consequently I am
at liberty this morning to quote the
chizzle-pussed sage of Alvarado
Row.
The sage suggests that Mr. Simp
son could make a fortune by writing
a book entitled, "My Love Life with
the Queen of England." But then Mr.
