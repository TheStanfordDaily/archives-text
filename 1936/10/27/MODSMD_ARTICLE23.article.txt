# Four Stanford Students Represent Farm in America-Japan Conference
## 
### BY ALBERTA GARDEN 
With five weeks of their summer
spent in eating with chop-sticks and
sleeping on mats on the flood. Esther
Pelton, Margaret Johnson, Hortense
Spoehr, and Don Strauss came back
this summer from the third America-
Japan Student Conference in Ja
pan feeling that they had made
some very personal friends in the
Orient.
The four Stanford students were
among 45 students who went to the
conference as delegates. Among the
schools represented were Dartmouth,
Columbia, Minnesota, Northwestern,
U.S.C., U.C.L.A., Occidental, Wil
lamette, Oregon State, Oregon,
Washington, and Stanford. Repre
sentatives from all the Japanese uni
versities attended, and the confer
ence was directed entirely by stu
dents.
The first week of the stay was
spent in Tokyo, with round table dis
cussions on politics, economics, re
ligion, and culture. Following this
was a three-weeks' sightseeing tour
of Japan, during which the Ameri
cans stayed at Japanese inns and
Japanese homes, living in true Ja

panese fashion. On all sides the
travellers were showered with gifts.
Esther Pelton and two other
women at the conference spent a
few hours in a Japanese jail. Th£y
had unwittingly neglected to pay a
board bill at an inn and were taken
into custody by some strict Japa
nese speaking officers. The Ameri
can women could speak no Japanese
and the officers could speak no Eng
lish; so it took some time to ex
plain that the Americans had no in
tention of gypping the landlord.
Sleepers on the Japanese trains
were built for Japanese men only,
the visiting students found. Since
the American men were an average
six feet in height, they had some
bad nights in the short berths given
them.
In the round table discussions, all
of which were carried on in English,
the Japanese students were notice
ably reticent about talking on po
litical and economic subjects, as
such information is closely super
vised by the government. Speak
ing of the Manchurian situation, the
native delegates explained that Ja
pan attempting to use that terri
tory as a buffer agafnst Russia.
Originally it was hoped that Man
churia would relieve the over-popu
lation pressure, but few have mi
grated to it as yet.
The next conference—to be held
next summer — will probably be
somewhere in the Bay region, per
haps at Stanford.
