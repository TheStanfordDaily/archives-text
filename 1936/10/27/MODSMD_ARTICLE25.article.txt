# CAMPUS OPINION
## PHILOSOPHY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Being new at Stanford, it is pos
sible to achieve an unprejudiced
perspective of the university, its tra
ditions, its students and their atti
tudes.
The sun of familiarity having ob
literated the mist of newness, the
most jarring disappointment of all is
the apparent shyness on the part of
students and the ineffective methods
of becoming acquainted. This shy
ness may, on the part of some, be
snootiness, but it is only fair to give
the majority the benefit of the doubt.
Most of us know that awful feeling
of not knowing anyone—a sea of un
familiar faces scaring you into a
shell, very uncomfortable because It
is hiding you. You can't take it off
until you have become hardened
sufficiently not to care. By that time
you feel strange without it.
Taking it for granted that most of
us have had that experience, why do
we insist in forgetting other new
people. Other campuses have friend
lier attitudes. Why not Stanford?
We all cheer together at a rally or at
a game but act as supercilious as
Mrs. Gotrox on the Quad.
Of course to accomplish any fa
miliarity of spirit, certain attitudes
must be torn asunder. In the first
place, is it impossible for unac
quainted men arvd women to ex
change a one-word greeting without
being bald, brazen, or flirtatious? It's
a conceited idea. Men seem to get
along among each other but girls
seem to have lost faith, trust and sis
terhood with each other. They are as
suspicious as flies around fly paper.
There may be a Stanford spirit—
but let it flare with a few hellos fly
ing around. Let the new people feel
at home, the old boys benevolent.
No intimate clubbiness necessarily—
we all have a right to choose our
friends—just casual cheerfulness.
There is nothing to lose and much to
gain. Once the ice is broken the
river flows freely. Where are the
people strong enough to break it?
Stanford has yet to prove itself.

grievance is that there is a limit to
the degree which a writer, unless he
is thoroughly competent, should
criticize, particularly in the cases
where the criticism is not construc
tive and is conducted in a most
flippant fashion.
Frankly, I feel that the Daily is
making a mistake in permitting its
column writers to carry on political
propaganda in the fashion they are
employing throughout its pages. The
present political campaign-is as se
rious and intense a one as has ever
confronted the American people. If
it is to be handled justly, it merits
the discussion of its aspects in the
most rational fashion; and if the
Daily is to enter the field, the ar
ticles pertinent to the coming elec
tion should be not only rational but
as a unit, unbiased, for the Daily pre
sumably is an organ of the student
body, and the student body as a
whole has not yet expressed its views
in either direction.
What I should like to see in so far
as the election is concerned is more
of the articles that appeared in last
week's Tabby, less of Sour Gripes
Prendergast and rabble-rouser Eis
enbach.

Frankly, I feel that the Daily is
making a mistake in permitting its
column writers to carry on political
propaganda in the fashion they are
employing throughout its pages. The
present political campaign-is as se
rious and intense a one as has ever
confronted the American people. If
it is to be handled justly, it merits
the discussion of its aspects in the
most rational fashion; and if the
Daily is to enter the field, the ar
ticles pertinent to the coming elec
tion should be not only rational but
as a unit, unbiased, for the Daily pre
sumably is an organ of the student
body, and the student body as a
whole has not yet expressed its views
in either direction.
What I should like to see in so far
as the election is concerned is more
of the articles that appeared in last
week's Tabby, less of Sour Gripes
Prendergast and rabble-rouser Eis
enbach.

The Editor, Sir:
Being new at Stanford, it is pos
sible to achieve an unprejudiced
perspective of the university, its tra
ditions, its students and their atti
tudes.
The sun of familiarity having ob
literated the mist of newness, the
most jarring disappointment of all is
the apparent shyness on the part of
students and the ineffective methods
of becoming acquainted. This shy
ness may, on the part of some, be
snootiness, but it is only fair to give
the majority the benefit of the doubt.
Most of us know that awful feeling
of not knowing anyone—a sea of un
familiar faces scaring you into a
shell, very uncomfortable because It
is hiding you. You can't take it off
until you have become hardened
sufficiently not to care. By that time
you feel strange without it.
Taking it for granted that most of
us have had that experience, why do
we insist in forgetting other new
people. Other campuses have friend
lier attitudes. Why not Stanford?
We all cheer together at a rally or at
a game but act as supercilious as
Mrs. Gotrox on the Quad.
Of course to accomplish any fa
miliarity of spirit, certain attitudes
must be torn asunder. In the first
place, is it impossible for unac
quainted men arvd women to ex
change a one-word greeting without
being bald, brazen, or flirtatious? It's
a conceited idea. Men seem to get
along among each other but girls
seem to have lost faith, trust and sis
terhood with each other. They are as
suspicious as flies around fly paper.
There may be a Stanford spirit—
but let it flare with a few hellos fly
ing around. Let the new people feel
at home, the old boys benevolent.
No intimate clubbiness necessarily—
we all have a right to choose our
friends—just casual cheerfulness.
There is nothing to lose and much to
gain. Once the ice is broken the
river flows freely. Where are the
people strong enough to break it?
Stanford has yet to prove itself.

grievance is that there is a limit to
the degree which a writer, unless he
is thoroughly competent, should
criticize, particularly in the cases
where the criticism is not construc
tive and is conducted in a most
flippant fashion.
