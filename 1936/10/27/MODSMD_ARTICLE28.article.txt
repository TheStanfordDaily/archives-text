The Editor, Sir:
A youth was lying on the pave
ment between the wheels of a bi
cycle. A Paly cop was beating him
with a club, nl the eyes of the local
theater managers, the officer was
evidently doing his duty "defending"
their theaters from the vicious on
slaught of vandals.
But there were others who saw in
the armed resistance to the harmless
annual pajamarino the culmination
of a long series of moves to discour
age student attendance at local the
aters. Three years ago when we
were freshmen a student body card
entitled the bearer to a 25-cent ad
mission to the Stanford. This privi
lege was abolished, but for 30 cents
you could still get into the balcony.
That privilege now costs you 40
cents.
