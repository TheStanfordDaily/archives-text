The Editor, Sir:
A youth was lying on the pave
ment between the wheels of a bi
cycle. A Paly cop was beating him
with a club, nl the eyes of the local
theater managers, the officer was
evidently doing his duty "defending"
their theaters from the vicious on
slaught of vandals.
But there were others who saw in
the armed resistance to the harmless
annual pajamarino the culmination
of a long series of moves to discour
age student attendance at local the
aters. Three years ago when we
were freshmen a student body card
entitled the bearer to a 25-cent ad
mission to the Stanford. This privi
lege was abolished, but for 30 cents
you could still get into the balcony.
That privilege now costs you 40
cents.
Then jail and fines were meted out
to anyone bold enough to express
audibly his disapproval of rotten en
tertainment. And now, like the cop
who beats a student when he's down,
the Palo Alto theater managex's have
seen fit to enlist the entire police
force to end another Stanford tradi
tion.
A quiet warning in advance to the
Rally Committee could probably
have prevented the whole menacing
situation. Instead, they chose the
smart-aleck way, and transformed a
harmless evening of fun into a near
riot. It is hard to believe that any.
appreciable number of Stanford stu
dents will enter either the Varsity or
Stanford theaters until the managers
publicly apologize for the bad judg
ment they showed last Thursday
night.

The Editor, Sir:
A youth was lying on the pave
ment between the wheels of a bi
cycle. A Paly cop was beating him
with a club, nl the eyes of the local
theater managers, the officer was
evidently doing his duty "defending"
their theaters from the vicious on
slaught of vandals.
But there were others who saw in
the armed resistance to the harmless
annual pajamarino the culmination
of a long series of moves to discour
age student attendance at local the
aters. Three years ago when we
were freshmen a student body card
entitled the bearer to a 25-cent ad
mission to the Stanford. This privi
lege was abolished, but for 30 cents
you could still get into the balcony.
That privilege now costs you 40
cents.
Then jail and fines were meted out
to anyone bold enough to express
audibly his disapproval of rotten en
tertainment. And now, like the cop
who beats a student when he's down,
the Palo Alto theater managex's have
seen fit to enlist the entire police
force to end another Stanford tradi
tion.
A quiet warning in advance to the
Rally Committee could probably
have prevented the whole menacing
situation. Instead, they chose the
smart-aleck way, and transformed a
harmless evening of fun into a near
riot. It is hard to believe that any.
appreciable number of Stanford stu
dents will enter either the Varsity or
Stanford theaters until the managers
publicly apologize for the bad judg
ment they showed last Thursday
night.
