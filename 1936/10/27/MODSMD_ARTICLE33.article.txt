# Coffis Worried Over First String Position
## Thornhill Says Football Team Didn't Fail Him; Ought To Win Soon 
### BY HERB DIAMOND 
"Am I still on the first string,
Tiny?"
None other than halfback Jimmy
Coffis wanted to know that just as
soon as he came into the locker
room after the fracas with Troy.
Coffis was very seriously worried
and even after he had been reas
sured that he hadn't lost his spot
on the varsity, he still looked a bit
perplexed.
He was expressing the sentiment
ol some of the rest of his team-mates
as well as his own when he first
made the query. The men thought
they had let Tiny down. But they
hadn't—not by any means, and
Thornhill himself says so.
At present he couldn't be much
more jovial if his charges had
cracked through and upset Troy
completely. The battle turned into
pretty much of an upset as it was;
actually the Cardinals came within
one small break or two of at least
tying the invaders. But the sources
ol greatest pleasure to Tiny centers
around those seven plays the squad
unleashed when the score stood 14-0.
Ihe Redskins had been shoved
back and scored upon; the ball had
been taken right out of their grasp
on an interception just when their
offense was beginning to click—but
even in the face of all this they had
the ability, the courage, and the
spirit to march 73 yards through and
over the walls of Troy to collect their
7 points.
Practice sessions will keep on be
ing closed to outsiders, for the coach
ing staff seems to believe that this
plan is worth continuing. The squad
started things off for the week with a
relatively light session last night.
