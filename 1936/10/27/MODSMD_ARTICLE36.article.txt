# Bay Region Teams Beaten
## 
### 
"Local Boys Don't Make Good"
would be a good heading for this
little story. On gridirons widely
separated through the country, Bay
Region teams came out of the show
ers following defeats.
Headline maker of the week was
an intersectional battle between two
old rivals, St. Mary's and Fordham,
played in New York. After looking
very weak in the first seven minutes
following the kickoff, the Rams came
back, living up to their name, to win
the ol' ball game, 7-6. The Moraga
Maulers scored all their points via
the field goal route, with Lou Ferry
doing the booting.
The actual length of the kicks, in
cluding the end zone, were 34 and
49 yards. Which is something the
Gotham fans haven't seen for many
a day. Fordham's score came a few
minutes later as a result of a 14-yard
pass thrown by Palau, who also
kicked the winning point.
On the coast, Washington bounced
the Bears 13â€”0. California failed to
get within range of the Huskies' goal
all afternoon. Cal's "Big Brothers"
got mad in the final period of their
game with Oregon State, and finally
came through to a 22-13 win.

The nearest land to Iceland is
Greenland, 150 miles away. Scotland
is 500 miles southeast.
