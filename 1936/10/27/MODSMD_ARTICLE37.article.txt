## Calvelli, Stone Get Pens; 'Chooch' Wins Radio 
### 
Ol' Man Benevolence went on a
bender this weekend, and Stanford
football players came out on the
good end with a miscellaneous col
lection of pens, chewing gum, ra
dios, and suitcases.
Tony Calvelli, who played about
half the game at fullback and com
pleted six out of sixteen passes with
out an interception, earned the Rob
ert Elmer Dakan award of one car
ton of Beech Nut gum, unchewed,
and a suitcase given by Wiley Smith,
San Francisco Examiner cartoonist
a la Hatlo.
Two Keeble pens were given this
week, the other to Grant Stone, end,
who was continuallyjnessing up Mr.
Davis and Mr. Schindler and other
toughies on the Head Man's squad
Saturday. The reason for this double
gift was the absence of a game last
week.
Wiley Smith's weekly award sys
tem also gave Lou Ferry, Gael player
who kicked two field goals for St.
Mary's against Fordham in New
York Saturday, a suitcase.
The Lyddane Brothers Hardware
company gave its weekly radio
award this time to Louis Tsoutsou
vas, only Card player who stayed on
the field for the whole game.
"Chooch" was one of the Card de
fensive giants, halting one Trojan
drive by intercepting a Schindler
pass for the only interception by
Stanford during the game.
