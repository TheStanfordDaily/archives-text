# SIDELINE SLANTS...
## 
### 
After the huhhuh and adrenin sub- I
side, you flop into an easy chair to i
think it all over, and there are many {
things that come to mind about the
U.S.C. game Saturday.
(Most of them have been coming |
to mind for 43 hours, too, because the
Monday tabby doesn't give you
enough room to start to think—you
simply grab the Examiner and go to
work.)
Everybody seemed to think after
ward that the statistics would be
horrible — it looked like Schindler
would make more on every two
plays than Stanford made all after
noon. That was because we were
behind, and every gain seemed to
take more time from that needed to i
tie up the score. . . .
The figures, though, showed but a
slight edge to U.S.C., with total
yards gained at 241 and 204, but
much of the Stanford yardage was
from passes—l2l) from 9 completed
out of 25, while Troy made 82 yards
from 7 completed out of 18. First
downs were to U.S.C., 11 over 10,
while both sides lost the ball twice
on fumbles ....
Tiny was loud in his praise of
Schindler after the game: "We're
going to do something about him; he
was the difference between winning
and losing today. Our offense. You
saw it yourselves. I'm well satisfied
—the kids played a fine game of ball,
and they're going to get even better.
Standouts? Tsoutsouvas played a
whale of a defensive game, the only
man to go GO minutes, and I liked the
way Calvelli covei'ed his passes."
Calvelli spoke the piece about
Schindler: "He's not such a power
ful driver; it's just that the guys
were hitting him too low. For a man
with high knee action like that the
only thing you can do is hit him
high and knock him over to either
side. The line was grabbing at his
feet, and with Schindler you can
only get one foot at a time. That's
not much better than no feet at all."
Everybody was wondering about
that play to the weak side that seem
ed such a consistent gainer—Coffis
(or Vigna) would take the ball from
center and seem to drop it on the
ground before starting off. Looked a
lot like sloppy ball handling, but it
looked the same way in secret prac

tice last week; they were rehearsing
the "take-drop" for hours on end.
Another thins: they had rehearsed
was that end-around of Rasmussen's,
a new one to Thornhill opponents.
A lot of wags criticized Hoos for
calling a new, slow starting play on
that fourth and two down by the
goal, but they all know lhat if it had
worked I here would never be a
harsh word . . .
From where I sat I couldn't find a
flaw in Bobby Morris' officiating.
The fact that he was in charge of
this all-important game seemed so
insignificant to both spectators and
players that it was forgotten after
the first few plays. (Spokane and
Portland papers please copy.)
The "Trojan sophs are on their
way up" rumor is even worse th;>n
it sounds: of the "veteran" team,
three are sophomores, four juniors,
and four seniors, while of the
"sophomore" squad, ten are sopho
mores and one a junior . . .
Training restrictions on the U.S.C.
players are interesting. Any of the
Trojans who wanted to ride around
or spend the time with friends after*
the game had to get special permis
sion from the Headman. They also
said, "Take a drink? We couldn't if
we wanted. He has his stooges plant
ed all over here and L.A. to watch
us" . . .
