# Let's Dance

Though the money-bag holders over at the
A.S.S.U. office cannot as yet tell how much
money was garnered as net gravy from last
Saturday's dance, it has been rumored that a
very neat little profit was made—probably
coming close to SISO.
This money will find its way into A.S.S.U.
coffers after all outstanding bills are paid. But
what will happen to it in the A.S.S.U. budget is a
moot question.
Now judging from this last "dollar dance" and
also the Reg Dance, students at Stanford really
go for cheap on-campus dances. But will they
not also go for still cheaper on-campus dances —
a 50 cents-a-couple dance—similar to Satur
day's affair except in price? The Daily suggests
that the Cardinals or some other A.S.S.U. com
mittee take the profits from the post-U.S.C.
dance to help defray expenses and put on an
all-campus 50 cent dance after the Washington
game or some other time in the near future:
This will not take care of dance-loving stu
dents who remain on the campus this weekend
while trains, planes, and cars carry other hun
dreds of students to root at the U.C.L.A. game.
The transformation of Lagunita Boathouse into a
nightery is still a Daily dream, but there is
nothing to stop the lobby of the Old Union by
the A.S.S.U. office to be rigged up with a radio
phonograph, with a roaring log fire in the mas
sive hearth for cheap campus dancing enter
tainment.
Even the Cellar could arrange to stay open
until one o'clock, or at least until twelve to serve
those attending. The cost would be little, the
Cellar would obtain business formerly allotted
to highway rendezvous, and the office of the
respective Deans would cease to worry about
"students conducting themselves in manner un
b3coming a Stanford lady or gentleman."
