Palo Alto should form a vigilante committee
lo protect its homes and shops from the maraud
ing vandals who swoop down on Palo Alto
from their dens in the Cit Library at Stanford.
Stanford lives like a leech off of Palo Alto.
Without Palo Alto and the Fox Theaters there
would be no Stanford, no stop-and-go signals,
no vandals, no pajamas.
Paly has grown to be one of the best-managed
municipalities in the state, a fine residential area
for suburbanites, a town of accepted culture not
because of its proximity to Stanford, but because
of its proximity to Menlo.
And now, Stanford not only accepts credit for
the growth of Palo Alto, but attempts to extort
a.s booty the privilege for its young savages to
descend upon the town like the hordes of Gen
gis Kahn and by rapine and plunder strip it of
its life blood. These hordes attack policemen
without any provocation at all and neon signs
they break, when the neon signs have done
nothing to them. They think theater prices are
too high. They want them to be reduced.
People who want prices reduced are radicals.
Reduction of prices entails the loss of profit for
the theater, which is a destruction of private
property. The destruction of private property
means Communism. Stanford is the hotbed of
edition, Anarchism, Shintoism, and disrespect
c.f Law and Order.

If Palo Alto once yields to these terrorists,
she must yield forever. Never, while there is a
drop of lifeblood in the veins of Palo Alto citi
zens, must she yield. United in a common front
against the foreign invader, she must BOYCOTT
Stanford, and BOYCOTT now.
