Rooting sections, being a necessary evil
should be handled as well as possible; Stanford
bands also being a necessary evil should be
handled as well as possible, and when rooting
sections and Stanford bands get together, they
too should be handled as well as possible. .
After the fiasco of interdepartmental stupidity
displayed at Saturday's game passing the buck
resulted between the Rally Committee and the
band. It is too late now to overcome the dis
organization of Saturday, but it is not too late
for Rally Committee and the band to work out
an effective co-operative arrangement for fu
ture games.
Although the band may make contracts with
the Associated Oil Company to play during the
intermission, it also should co-operate with the
yell leader to enable him to efficiently direct the
card stunts between band numbers.
The U.S.C. band had the Hollywood appear
ance with their feather-in-the-hat uniforms, but
they showed clever organization and enthusi
astic performance; which is more than can be
said for our cymbal-crashing organization.
But in addition to co-operation between our
own forces, some sort of definite arrangement
should be made between visiting bands and our
band as to when each will play during, times-out
and between quarters. Even the best of bands
will not please the musical ear, not matter how
dull, if they play different selections at the same
time.
