WE ARE A SHOVELMAN
We see by the papers that a shovelman on the WPA
was in line to win a two thousand-buck consolation
prize on the Irish sweepstakes if he doesn't win $150,000
for picking the right horse with the right ticket.
He is the only shovelman who ever won anything
pleasant. And all columnists, who shovel even as he
does, are grateful. This columnist stands in absolute
awe. The very Gods must have touched a man. who
earns a living shoveling good earth, and then has
thrown at him this Rooseveltian bonus.
As for shoveling words, and their less acceptable
meanings, there is no reward in that profession regard
less of the Vocational Guidance Department.

There is no money, for the boys who dish out gravy
are wary of a writer not compelled to dish their bilge.
There is no honor, for columnists, like others of the
newspaper profession, merely record the positive
achievements and defections of the world. There is
nothing hut the joy nf knowing you are the most con
tradicted of God's children.
Peculiarly, it is a joy that makes the job self
sufficient. And when voj-populi boils over with written
replies—we have ecstasy.

Columnists, of course, are much like trumpet play
ers. They lose their lip after too many years of blow
ing. The trumpeter's occupational disease is purely
physiological. The columnist's, purely mental.
The columnist is almost sure to get cynicisis. For
it is impossible to write palpable persiflage day after
day, have it taken seriously, and still preserve one's
faith in human intelligence.
Our bantering is a defect of method. We find, be
cause our talents are limited, that the one way of get
ting readers is to vehemently outrage their beliefs.
First they are amused, then they are amazed, finally
they begin to hate. And when they start to hate, we
have them.

Walton Wickett, who sends in a campus opinion, is
a clinical eyample. He says Bull Session is ridiculous,
as if I didn't know it. He says I'm worthless if I'm not
being sarcastic. True. He says he hates me. I love it.
And somewhere in his letter he says he reads the
column every morning.
To the perverse and ingrown ego of the columnist,
Mr. Wickett is balm indeed. And to all the others who
are not only mad enough to read, but mad enough to
write in—we thank you.
In our dark business some genius dubbed it "in
tellectual white slavery") such damnation is implied
praise. We shall do our best to earn it.
