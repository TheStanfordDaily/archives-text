# OUR HASHER

Roble seems to be the center of a great deal of in
trigue. Not only do the girls go out but they also go in.
They go around singing
T.M., TM.
All the girls are in love with him,"
and they cause hashers to write in letters as "I throw
in the sponge. I have nothing against the Frosh women.
They have all been very nice to me this year, and I'm
tired of hearing that I'm a 'sour-puss' and that they all
hate me. If they do, let them tell me so in person, and
I'll make the satisfactory adjustments privately. After
all, I only work there and try to mind my own business.
What Roble needs is a men's club."
Then, it seems, the girls have good fun doing all
sorts of pranks. Last week-end several of them snatch
ed the red lanterns off of rails guarding streets im
provements and newly-dug ditches.
In order to get them inside the Hall, they raised
them up through their window. Just as they got them
up to the sill, up walks Officer Davis, who spent a
good deal of time explaining to one of the girls how
people can be hurt and injured and the University
sued for damages as a result of such actions. In the
fading light, the girl he was carefully explaining this
to looked suspiciously like the freshman daughter of
one of Stanford's noted trustees.
Officer Davis figured in another bit of Roble in
trigue last week-end, when five Encina citizens of the
lettuce-strike city of Salinas, marched into Roble lobby
after hours and announced quite loudly that they were
thore to spend the night.
Officer Davis arrived at the response of Roble's de
fenders and threw the boys out, with the aid of one-half
of the local fire department.
The boys are charged with picketing.
