THE GORGEOUS HUSSY," at the
Stanford Theater
If this coins millions for Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, it will be for the
picture's star appeal, the magic of
Big Names, and little else. Story and
historical aura are only a back
ground against which popular screen
stars flit, stride, and soar to periodic
climaxes.
Joan Crawford is Peggy O'Neill,
the inn-keeper's daughter who for
her beauty, goodness, and political
astuteness becomes the favorite of
Washington statesmen, incuding the
President himself. Jealous Washing
ton wives, though, wag tongues, call
her the gorgeous hussy. Which of
course she is not.
Despite the ascendancy of Robert
Taylor in teasers as the romantic in
terest, he appears only in the open
ing reels to court and marry Peggy,
then departs next morning for the
Philippines. The next word is that
he has died of tropical fever. Thus
the disarming Mr. Taylor is disposed
of.
But Peggy's real love is the rather
morose John Randolph of Virginia,
played by Melvyn Douglas. Ran
dolph believes passionately in states'
rights, while Peggy is loyal to the
Union. So with tragic heroism both
renounce each other for their po
litical affiliations.
The Secretary of War (Franchot
Tone) finally asks Peggy for her
hand. She accepts, but receives no

peace from Washington gossips even
after her innocence is proved at a
trial conducted by the President.
Last scene shows Jackson waving
good-bye to Peggy and husband
bound for the United States ministry
in Spain.
The film's best feature is Beulah
Bondi's slow, tragic interpretation of
plain-spoken, pipe - smoking Mrs.
Jackson, who suffers with Peggy
from the carping of politician's
wives. Lionel Barrymore was a
homespun if rather enfeebled An
drew Jackson. I was fascinated more
by his forehead than his role; make
up artists had elongated his head a
good inch. Dialogue is filled with
the sententious phrases which his
torical pictures find it hard to avoid.
