# PRETTY PASS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Things have come to a fine pass.
When Palo Alto police start pulling
clubs on Stanford students some
kind of action should be taken.
Last year the Palo Alto Police De
partment started a clean up of the
theaters and a boycott was suggest
ed. Again this year, I repeat, and
with a vengeance, that the Palo Alto
theaters should be boycotted.
After all, the Stanford students
give a great deal of trade to the
fair (?) city of Palo Alto, and espe
cially the Stanford and Varsity The
aters. Without their patronage, the
balcony would be empty, and this,
as the theater may well know, is not
very good for box office receipts, es
pecially at these "summer prices."
In previous years, once a year, the
Stanford frosh have been allowed
free admission to the Stanford The
ater, and the theater can well afford
such an action — now the theater
turns its back on the students.
Stanford Students — let's get this
boycott rolling and see how the the
aters like it when the students turn
their backs on them.
Yours for a united Stanford boy
cott of the Palo Alto theaters.
