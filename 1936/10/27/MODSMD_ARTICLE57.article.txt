# IMPECCABLE FRENCH
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In last week's Bull Session there
appeared a little paragraph fairly
bursting with admiration for Presi
dent Roosevelt's speech at Quebec.
We are told how the great Gentle
man (capital G) impeccably ac-

knowledged in French his host's
welcome; and we are reminded of
the important effect it had upon our
foreign political relations—"obvious
to anyone who knows the value of
flattery to the French."
I happened to see the newsreel
shot of this scene at a theatre in
Paris last summer, and can vouch
for the reception given it by the
French audience there.
Shocked by the incredible accent
and the amazing self-assurance be
hind it, (he audience was first
stunned into silence. Then came the
natural reaction. Sneers, guffaws,
and cat-calls filled the house, and
voices could be heard rising in in
dignation at the atrocity committed
upon the mother-tongue.
If this was supposed to be subtle
flattery to the French, it backfired
most dismally.
