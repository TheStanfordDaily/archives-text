# Juniors Vote 'No' On Fall Jolly-up
## 
### 
Junior class will have no jolly-up
this quarter, decided juniors meeting
at the Pi Phi house, according to
Tom Killifer, president.
Representatives assembled from
every living group could not decide
whether to use all class funds for
the Junior Prom or toward the re
building of the Lagunita boathouse
into a night spot.
The juniors will meet again this
week, meanwhile various proposals
are being considered by the living
groups.
