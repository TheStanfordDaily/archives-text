# Golf House Planned For 'Nitery' Test
## Ex Committee Ruling On Women Entertainers Is Approved by Wilbur 
### 
Agitators for a campus "night
spot" were at least partially ap
peased last night when Ex Commit
tee, subject to B.A.C. sanction, ap
proved opening the elubhouse of the
Stanford golf course to night "traf
fic" next Saturday night and every
week night next week.
Also affeeting Farm dance addicts
wns President Ray Lyman Wilbur's
approval of Ex Committee's sugges
tion that women entertainers be al
lowed to appear with outside or
chestras.
Clubhouse into 'Nitery'
For the golf club "nitery" experi
ment, a radio or phonograph will
probably be installed, the soda foun
tain will be operated, and the club
house will be thrown open for
dancing and informal entertainment
until 11 or 12 o'clock. This initial
undertaking was assigned to Cardi
nals for complete arrangements.
Use of the golf clubhouse is not
permanent. Ex Committee intends it
only for an experiment, to see
whether or not Stanford students are
sufficiently interested in a "night
spot" to warrant building a perma
nent one.
The 8.A.C.. which controls the golf
course, must approve Ex Commit
tee's action before the week's experi
ment is set for sure.
Roth's Suggestion
Comptroller A! Roth had suggest
ed trying the clubhouse to President
Jim Reynolds, besides advocating
two other plans. An addition to the
Union could be built, Reynolds said,
for less than $25,000 which could ac
commodate either radio or actual
orchestra dances.
The $25,000 would be taken from
the Union Improvement Fund and
such a Union addition would cost the
A.S.S.U. nothing. Such a place, if
student interest lagged later, could
be taken over by the Union as an
auxiliary banquet and dining hall.
Roth's other suggestion was using
the Union dining hall and lobby for
dancing on certain nights only.
Lake Spot Dinged
The proposed scheme for rebuild
ing the Lagunita Boathouse, or
building a new place on the bank of
the lake, would entail too much ex
pense for plumbing and fountain fa
cilities, Roth had told Reynolds.
Larry Rouble and Chick Franich
seemed to oppose using the Union or
an addition to the Union because it
was "getting away from the original
idea." An informal spot far enough
from the "academic environment"
was sought by the student body, they
argued. Esther Pelton held out for
the Union deal—"it doesn't need to
be too elaborate," she claimed.
Women Are Back
The campus night life was also
affected last night when Ex Com
mittee received a letter from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur approving, with cer
tain reservations, the new ruling
that women entertainers may appear
here with outside orchestras.
Dr. Wilbur urged that someone be
responsible for watching the enter
tainers during the dancing, be cm
powered to oust them the minute
they begin any "questionable" per
formance. The contract between the
dance chairman and the orchestra
leader should be approved by Ex
Committee, he said. The Committee
reacted by giving the head police
man authority to oust entertainers
made the dance chairman respon
sible for any off-color performances
REG DANCES — The advisability
of granting reg dances to campus or
ganizations was doubted by Franich
who argued that "the A.S.S.U. is
really just doling out money to
privileged organizations because the
profits really belong to the student
body."
Joe Bun is believed reg dance
profits should be turned over to the
Student Aid Fund. Ruth Goodan
and he will investigate the matter
this week.
ISM. (.ami: BONFIRE was grant
ed $100.
AFTER-DANCE BUFFET supper
November 7 planned by Lagunita
was approved after the by-law read
ing "all Saturday night functions
must close at 12 o'clock" was chang
ed to "all Saturday night dances
must close at 12 o'clock."

Women Are Back
The campus night life was also
affected last night when Ex Com

Lyman Wilbur approving, with cer
tain reservations, the new ruling
that women entertainers may appear
here with outside orchestras.
Dr. Wilbur urged that someone be
responsible for watching the enter
tainers during the dancing, be cm
powered to oust them the minute
they begin any "questionable" per
formance. The contract between the
dance chairman and the orchestra
leader should be approved by Ex
Committee, he said. The Committee
reacted by giving the head police
man authority to oust entertainers
made the dance chairman respon
sible for any off-color performances
REG DANCES — The advisability
of granting reg dances to campus or

who argued that "the A.S.S.U. is

Agitators for a campus "night

Stanford golf course to night "traf

Clubhouse into 'Nitery'
For the golf club "nitery" experi
ment, a radio or phonograph will
probably be installed, the soda foun
tain will be operated, and the club
house will be thrown open for
dancing and informal entertainment
until 11 or 12 o'clock. This initial
undertaking was assigned to Cardi
nals for complete arrangements.
Use of the golf clubhouse is not
permanent. Ex Committee intends it
only for an experiment, to see
whether or not Stanford students are
sufficiently interested in a "night
spot" to warrant building a perma
nent one.
The 8.A.C.. which controls the golf
course, must approve Ex Commit
tee's action before the week's experi
ment is set for sure.
Roth's Suggestion
Comptroller A! Roth had suggest
ed trying the clubhouse to President
Jim Reynolds, besides advocating
two other plans. An addition to the
Union could be built, Reynolds said,
for less than $25,000 which could ac
commodate either radio or actual
orchestra dances.
The $25,000 would be taken from
the Union Improvement Fund and
such a Union addition would cost the
A.S.S.U. nothing. Such a place, if
student interest lagged later, could
be taken over by the Union as an
auxiliary banquet and dining hall.
Roth's other suggestion was using
the Union dining hall and lobby for
dancing on certain nights only.
Lake Spot Dinged
The proposed scheme for rebuild
ing the Lagunita Boathouse, or
building a new place on the bank of
the lake, would entail too much ex
pense for plumbing and fountain fa
cilities, Roth had told Reynolds.
Larry Rouble and Chick Franich
seemed to oppose using the Union or
an addition to the Union because it
was "getting away from the original
idea." An informal spot far enough
from the "academic environment"
was sought by the student body, they
argued. Esther Pelton held out for

until 11 or 12 o'clock. This initial
undertaking was assigned to Cardi
nals for complete arrangements.
Use of the golf clubhouse is not
permanent. Ex Committee intends it
only for an experiment, to see
whether or not Stanford students are
sufficiently interested in a "night
spot" to warrant building a perma
nent one.
The 8.A.C.. which controls the golf
course, must approve Ex Commit
tee's action before the week's experi
ment is set for sure.
Roth's Suggestion
Comptroller A! Roth had suggest
ed trying the clubhouse to President
Jim Reynolds, besides advocating
two other plans. An addition to the
Union could be built, Reynolds said,
for less than $25,000 which could ac
commodate either radio or actual
orchestra dances.
The $25,000 would be taken from
the Union Improvement Fund and
such a Union addition would cost the
A.S.S.U. nothing. Such a place, if
student interest lagged later, could
be taken over by the Union as an
auxiliary banquet and dining hall.
Roth's other suggestion was using
the Union dining hall and lobby for
dancing on certain nights only.
Lake Spot Dinged
The proposed scheme for rebuild
ing the Lagunita Boathouse, or
building a new place on the bank of
the lake, would entail too much ex
pense for plumbing and fountain fa
cilities, Roth had told Reynolds.
Larry Rouble and Chick Franich
seemed to oppose using the Union or
an addition to the Union because it
was "getting away from the original
idea." An informal spot far enough
from the "academic environment"
was sought by the student body, they
argued. Esther Pelton held out for
the Union deal—"it doesn't need to
be too elaborate," she claimed.
Women Are Back
The campus night life was also
affected last night when Ex Com
mittee received a letter from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur approving, with cer
tain reservations, the new ruling
that women entertainers may appear
here with outside orchestras.
Dr. Wilbur urged that someone be
responsible for watching the enter
tainers during the dancing, be cm
powered to oust them the minute
they begin any "questionable" per
formance. The contract between the
dance chairman and the orchestra
leader should be approved by Ex
Committee, he said. The Committee
reacted by giving the head police
man authority to oust entertainers
made the dance chairman respon
sible for any off-color performances
REG DANCES — The advisability
of granting reg dances to campus or
ganizations was doubted by Franich
who argued that "the A.S.S.U. is
really just doling out money to
privileged organizations because the
profits really belong to the student
body."
Joe Bun is believed reg dance
profits should be turned over to the
Student Aid Fund. Ruth Goodan
and he will investigate the matter
this week.
ISM. (.ami: BONFIRE was grant
ed $100.
AFTER-DANCE BUFFET supper
November 7 planned by Lagunita
was approved after the by-law read
ing "all Saturday night functions
must close at 12 o'clock" was chang
ed to "all Saturday night dances
must close at 12 o'clock."
