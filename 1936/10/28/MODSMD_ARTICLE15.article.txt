# Landon, F.D.R. Seek Election in Straw Vote
## 
### 
Presidential polls of Literary Di
gest, Institute of Public Opinion,
Hearst-Ci osley, Baltimore Sun, and
all others will be forgotten on the
campus tomorrow as The Daily
stages its quadrennial straw vote.
As a culmination of rabid campus
campaigns, students will indicate
their favorite candidates from 8:30
till 1:'50 o'clock at the law steps, with
the votes of men and women being
placed in separate boxes. Election
committee headed by Dave Allison
will officiate.
Results will bo released in Fri
day's Daily. In the same issue re
sults of an independent poll of fac
ulty members conducted by Pi Sigma
Alpha, honorary political science so
ciety. will be tabulated.
Most significant question to be
answered, besides actual strength of
each candidate, is whether the down
ward trend in Republican popularity
will continue. Republican student
votes were 75 per cent of the total
in 1928 and dropped to 63 per cent
in 1932. There is also the question
whether a Stanford alumnus as a
candidate held up the Republican
majority abnormally.
Ballots for faculty members were
left with departmental secretaries
yesterday and will be collected to
morrow. To determine whether any
difference of opinion exists between
age groups, votes of instructors and
professors will be counted separately.
