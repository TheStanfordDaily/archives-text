# Interest In Politics Reaches Climax In Symposium Tonight
## Republicans, Democrats Debate; Communist, Socialist To Answer 
### 
Debate Manager Jim Hill, com
menting upon the political forum to
be held at 7 :30 o'clock tonight in the
Assembly Hall, said: "I think the
interest which is being shown in
tonight's debate pretty thoroughly
explodes the myth that Stanford
students are apathetic when it comes
to national questions.
"The debaters have worked hard
and should present intelligent and
instructive speeches. But, in addi
tion, the men are utilizing every op
portunity to inject humor into the
debate. It's going to be good."
Wilbur Heads Meeting
For the first time in the history of
the forum, which was introduced in
1924, President Ray Lyman Wilbur
will conduct the meeting.
First will be a regular non-deci
sion team debate between Republi
cans and Democrats, whose argu
ments will then be torn down by a
Communist and Socialist.
Debaters Present Views
Bob Hartman and Claude Owens
will uphold the Democratic end of
the ticket. Hartmann was coach of
last year's frosh, member of the state
championship team as a freshman,
and participated in the Lemoyne
University debate.
Owens, a transfer from Santa Ana
J. C., was a member of the South
ern California championship debate
squad, and a varsity debater last
year.
First speaker for the G.O.P. will be
Bob North, who has had several
years' experience with varsity de
bating at the University of Hawaii.
Bob Mallett, winner of the Common
wealth debate, and winner of the de
bate award last year, will present the
rebuttal for the Republicans.
Bob Ha trover, a history graduate,
will give the Communist views, fol
lowed by Ed Lindbloom, Socialist,
Lindbloom is a public speaking as
sistant, adviser to the Speakers' Bu
reau, and a member of the Joflre
team with three years' varsity expe
rience.
Audience to Vote
A vote will be taken both before
and after the speeches to determine
how much the audience's political
opinions are changed by the debate.
It seems quite likely that a few
hidebound politicos will change color
Even Hartmann, participant in the
debate, modestly admitted, "I was
under the power of persuasion,
formerly a Republican, but since
working on this debate I have been
converted by my own eloquence. '
