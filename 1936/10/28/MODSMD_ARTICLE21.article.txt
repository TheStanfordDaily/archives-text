# SOUR GRIPES
## CUSTER'S LAST STAND 
### 
What with a super-colossal four
ring political carnival, with a lion
tamer and everything, coming off to
night, somebody might think that
college students really have a mind
for something more than silk stock
ings, ankles, and allied subjects.
But if the millennium has arrived
and there are a few who think of
such ponderous subjects as recipro
cal tariffs, then the millennium is on
its way out and those who have
political minds will shortly be looked
upon as poor intellectual dopes, a
little lower on the social scale than
philosophy majors and divinity stu
dents.
* * *
For after all, the depression is
over, so why should anybody think
about such things as social security?
v or that matter, who wants social
ecurity anyway? All we want is the
Jays of 1928 back again. And don't
let anybody fool us about that.
There was a lot of talk about the
spiritual value of the depression. All
about how we knew how to take life
in slower tempo, how we learned
who were our best and truest friends,
and how we found solace and com
fort at church. Such rot! We took life
in slower tempo because we didn't
have anything to do; we knew who
our best friends were because they
paid their lOU's and we went to the
little red church in the wildwood
just because nobody had any money
lo go to the little brown tavern in the
alley.
* * *
The sign of the returning times,
of the good old days upon us, seems
lo be the coming generation of col
yge youth. It takes no astute ob
erver to notice it even now. Razzle
dazzle is king again. The boys at
ootball games, they whistle and
: hey whoop, they throw things and
i hey swear and they tank that all
i his is sure swell collitch stuff, eh
.:id? Before we know it, everybody
/ill be wearing fancy suspenders
>.ut over their shirts like they do at
lollywood High and they'll be call
ng houses on the Row "frats."
This political meeting tonight,
vhere the attempt at least will be
o solve national problems, is just
bout Custer's last stand. The In
lians are approaching over the hori
on, the old thundering herd of col
'egiates of 1927.

For after all, the depression is
over, so why should anybody think
about such things as social security?
v or that matter, who wants social
ecurity anyway? All we want is the
Jays of 1928 back again. And don't
let anybody fool us about that.
There was a lot of talk about the
spiritual value of the depression. All
about how we knew how to take life
in slower tempo, how we learned
who were our best and truest friends,
and how we found solace and com
fort at church. Such rot! We took life
in slower tempo because we didn't
have anything to do; we knew who
our best friends were because they
paid their lOU's and we went to the
little red church in the wildwood
just because nobody had any money
lo go to the little brown tavern in the
alley.

The sign of the returning times,
of the good old days upon us, seems
lo be the coming generation of col
yge youth. It takes no astute ob
erver to notice it even now. Razzle
dazzle is king again. The boys at
ootball games, they whistle and
: hey whoop, they throw things and
i hey swear and they tank that all
i his is sure swell collitch stuff, eh
.:id? Before we know it, everybody
/ill be wearing fancy suspenders
>.ut over their shirts like they do at
lollywood High and they'll be call
ng houses on the Row "frats."
This political meeting tonight,
vhere the attempt at least will be
o solve national problems, is just
bout Custer's last stand. The In
lians are approaching over the hori
on, the old thundering herd of col
'egiates of 1927.

STRAW POLL TOMORROW
What with a super-colossal four
ring political carnival, with a lion
tamer and everything, coming off to
night, somebody might think that
college students really have a mind
for something more than silk stock
ings, ankles, and allied subjects.
But if the millennium has arrived
and there are a few who think of
such ponderous subjects as recipro
cal tariffs, then the millennium is on
its way out and those who have
political minds will shortly be looked
upon as poor intellectual dopes, a
little lower on the social scale than
philosophy majors and divinity stu
dents.
