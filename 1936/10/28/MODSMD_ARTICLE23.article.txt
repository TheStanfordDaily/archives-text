# Bankers Plan Foreclosure Of St. Mary's
## Delay in Paying Interest On Bonds Due to Low Receipts, Enrollment 
### 
Foreclosure proceedings against St.
Mary's College are in preparation by
a committee of five San Francisco
investment bankers, it was declared
today.
For the last two and a half years
the college has been unable to pay
any interest on its bonds, of which
$1,370,500 are in the hands of the
public. The bondholders found they
were forced to foreclose on the
property of St. Mary's College which
was pledged as security.
Thirty-seven per cent of the col
lege's receipts for the year ending
June 30, 1936, was from the athletic
department and this came chiefly
from football. Control of these funds
is in the hands of the athletic de
partment and the officials of this de
partment make the disbursements.
It was recommended by the bond
holders' committee for the comp
troller to have charge of these funds.
The bondholders' committee cited
as "particularly discouraging" the
fact that student enrollment has
dropped considerably in the last four
years.
Two offers to raise a fund partially
to pay off the bondholders have been
suggested by the college and re
jected.
