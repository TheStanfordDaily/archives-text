# DEAN OPENS DINING HALL
## 
### 
Dedicating the new dining room
in the Union to "friendliness and
gracious living," Dean Mary Yost
last night officially opened the $6,000
addition. Customarily, Dean Yost
would have spoken to the group of
Union residents earlier in the quar
ter, but house officers deferred the
dinner to coincide with the comple
tion of the dining room.
