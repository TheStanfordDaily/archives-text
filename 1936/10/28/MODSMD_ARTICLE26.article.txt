"This is the longest separation my
brother and I have ever had," Leon
id Moskowitz said mournfully last
night. Alfred Moskowitz. the other
half of the Moskowitz twins of En
cina, whose arrival and accomplish
ments were detailed for Daily read
ers during registration week, was
taken to the hospital last Saturday
with an infected knee.
Leonard says he has been pretty
lonely. "My brother and 1 have
always gone to classes together since
we started to school. But, I think
he'll be out tomorrow," he said
more happily. The twins have du
plicate study programs here.
"He has acted as if he were lost,"
affirmed Leonard Liberman( room
mate on the pair. "All he does is sit
around and mope when he isn't over
at the hospital to see Ahred."
"Are they identical twins?" said
Liberman. "Say, those guys even
sleep alike. Last week I came into
the room when they were asleep
and they were in precisely the same
position, each with an arm under his
head and his knees cocked up."
