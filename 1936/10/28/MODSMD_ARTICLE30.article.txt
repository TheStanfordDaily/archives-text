# Farm Purchases Increase Palo Alto Trade 30 Percent
## Creameries, Movies Show Biggest Patronage 
### JANET GOULD 
Gold-lined or not, the pockets of
Stanford students and their owners
are indispensable to Palo Alto mer
chants. A 30 per cent average trade
increase from August to September
is laid to the influx of newcomers for
the fall quarter, and 2000 Stanford
ites are regular customers during the
year.
Clothing shops, movie houses,
creameries, Woolworth's, laundries,
and the electric appliance shops have
a sustained popularity, a poll show
ed, while the average groceries and
markets have little more trade be
cause of the vax'ious hall food shops
and the co-operative buying system
used on the campus for the living
groups.
Dress Shops Need Co-eds
Furnishing stores, especially for
the women, admit that their stock
and income are based on what the
college student wants to wear, one
manager said, and Palo Alto could
not patronize all the expensive dress
shops.
"It would be hard doing without
Stanford," the manager of Wool
worth's announced. "Aside from the
influence of the large payroll and the
expenditures of any institution of its
kind, the students themselves add
about 25 per cent to our business at
the beginning of the fall quarter.
When they get settled this slacks off
a little."
New Accounts Increase
Bank clearings for the same period
jump anywhere from one to two
million dollars, figures show. The
increase is in the new accounts,
many of which are on deposit to
last the whole quarter.
"This trading population of the
university is spending almost one
third again as much money as in the
depression years," Margaret Welli
ver, secretary to the Chamber of
Commerce, said. One popular con
fectionery sells candy and fountain
foods to customers over half of
whom are from the university; not
many regular meals are sold be
cause they either eat at the halls or
go up to the city.
"The creameries, movies, dry
goods stores, and especially the ga
rages. are taking care of more busi
ness because of the students.
Shop Popularity Consistent
"All this shouldn't be confused
with the university's being the rea
son for the increase of population
from 750 in 1900 to 16.500 today,"
she added. "This trade is from stu
dents themselves."
The outfitters are consistently
popular, and a definite 20 per cent
of the patrons of various beauty
shops are from Stanford. The sta
tioners are not so well patronized
because of the bookstore on the
campus, and few rents are paid into
Palo Alto other than for graduates'
rooms because of Timothy Hopkins'
plan to rent out university property
for campus residences.
