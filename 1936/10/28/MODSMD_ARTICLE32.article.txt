# Robert Ireland Cast for Part in 'Roadside'
## Back Country Texas Is Scene of Production; Dialect To Be Used 
### 
In the cast for the Dramatic Coun
cil production of "Roadside," to be
presented November 6. Phil Brown
is replacing Robert Ireland in the
part of Red Ike. Leads in the play
will be taken by Jim Corner and
Geraldine Schrieber.
The play is a dialect comedy with
back-country Texas as its locale.
Lynn Riggs, the author, was born in
Claremore, then Indian Territory,
now Oklahoma, and his intimate
knowledge of that country is clearly
shown in the plot and dialogue.
According to John Anderson, Now
York dramatic critic, "Roadside" has
quality and richness, and the sim
plicity of backwoods whose roots go
deeper into America than the Broad
way Subway."
Arthur Hopkins says of the play,
"It is my belief that Rigg's play will
reach posterity. It. has the feel of
survival, and I believe it to be the
first American dramatic classic."
