## EVERYBODY GOES TO LOS ANGELES 
### 
Shipmates, we leave port this
week.
I don't know why it is—maybe the
warm climate, or maybe that gal out
on West Pico, but when Stanford j
plays in Los Angeles, everybody goes j
down. Have you made your plans
yet?
There shouldn't be any moan
about going down to see us lose an
other. The Bruins are strong, yes,
but so are we, and getting better.
U.S.C. may be the best team on the
coast for all you know, and we came
near to taking them. It might easily
have been the other way without the
least bit of a howl.
But better than that, happily, the
local student body is getting used to
coming out on the short end. and are
beginning to see that the old Olympic
adage, '"Tis better to have fought
well than to have won," or some
thing like that, really has something.
With a lot of good, exciting foot
ball. with our guys playing right up
to their very best all the way
through, and with a swell crowd of
Trojans taking it easy when they
came over afterward. I don't think
there was a single Stanfordite in the
stands Saturday that didn't spend
an enjoyable afternoon, in spite of
losing, and losing to U.S.C.
