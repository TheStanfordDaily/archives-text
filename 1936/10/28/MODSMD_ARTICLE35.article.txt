# U.S.C.—A PEAK U.C.L.A.—A PLATEAU
## 
### 
The Bruins this week are differ
ent from U.S.C. in that their power is
more widely spread. They haven't
got equals of Schindler and Davis at
all around offense, but they have
some fine ball carriers in Hirshon,
Ferguson, Spaulding, and Williams,
and Fred Funk, one of the best all
around backs on the Coast, espe
cially adept at kicking.
When we saw them a couple of
weeks ago, they had a single shift,
out of a very fancy first formation:
center and two tackles up on the
line, an end behind each tackle and
both guards behind the center. This,
together with a Notre Dame set for
the backs, left them wide open to
shift into anything, right or left.
Mostly it was a kind of box, strong
side to the right.
Everybody says they had and have
no offense, which may or may not be
true, depending on who their op
ponents are, but for the most part
they get their points — they have
beaten Pomona, Occidental, Mon
tana, California, and Oregon State,
and have lost but one—to the Hus
kies, 14-7.
