# SOME PEOPLE'S CHILDREN—

Amongst the thousands of Trojans
that came up last week-end was
Clark Jones, sport editor of their
Daily Trojan down there. He has a
breeze for a situation—whenever he
wants to know the U.S.C. chances
this week-end, or a change in the
line-up, lie can go ask Papa—Head
man Howard H. Jones.
And Clark Jones get 15 bucks each
month for his trouble. What a capi
talistic sheet!
Up in the press box right next to
us for the last three games have
been three different guys. First two
games they were Cal scouts, and
Saturday, of all people, was a Notre
Dame agent, getting a line on U.S.C.
for their game in Los Angeles De
cember 5. Months ahead of time—
they must take that game seriously!
He wouldn't introduce himself, but
he still had some interesting things
to say. He thought Stanford had a
swell ball club, and complimented
them at several turns of the road.
He said the passes in the first half
weren't working because the ends
were running too hard, paying more
attention to getting out there than to
getting the oncoming ball, and that
the change in the second half indi
cated that somebody had suggested
they keep their eyes open.
The hard, sure Calvelli pitches he
termed dandy, but said Tiny'd have
to do some running plays from his
double wingback formation pretty
soon, or the whole defense would
soon be able to go back to guard
passes.
