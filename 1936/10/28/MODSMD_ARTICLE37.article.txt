# Fred Williams Promoted To First String
## Tony Calvelli Replaces J. Brigham at Fullback; Glenn Hamilton Plays 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
While only a few days ago they
said he was without a line or a
backfield or replacements or a
prayer, last night Tiny Thornhill
was busily back at work laughing
at the world.
Laughing because he had shown
them —he had spoken in the face of
all adversity to say that he had a
good squad, and so it turned out.
The score may have been a touch
down against Stanford last Satur
day. but there wasn't a spectator on
the premises who didn't come away
with anything but respect for the
Cardinal gridders and their im
provement in those last two weeks.
A peculiar situation was out there
yesterday — freshmen running dum
my scrimmage against the first
teams. It seems that they had been
studying them all last week in prep
aration for their game down there,
and saw the Bruins in action Satur
day, so they were a natural. Gray
son played left half (Spaulding Jr.
and Hirshon and Ferguson), while
his Reds passed and ran the tackles.
Zagar Recuperating
Pete Zagar was the only man not
in suit; he was practicing in sweat
clothes in honor of a bruised hip re
ceived early in Saturday's fray. Leo
Ferko still has a birdcage headgear
S/nr his broken schnoz, but it doesn't
subtract from his effectiveness.
The first string, as of yesterday,
showed the first changes since
Washington State: Calvelli was at
fullback ahead of Brigham, while
Fred (Big Boy) Williams was at Joe
Vigna's left half post. All eyes look
ed with glee at Glenn Hamilton's re
turn —he was running plays at full
back with the third team, in full
football regalia, and with but a slight
limp.
First Team Line-up
The first team of last night, abso
lutely tentative for practice pur
poses, was Stone and Clark, Calla
way and Zagar, Ferko and Matthews,
Tsoutsouvas, Hoos, Coffis and Wil
liams, Calvelli.
