# Card Water Poloists Will Tangle With San Jose State Team Today
## 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton's powerful
Redskin water poloists are all set to
do a little dunking today in Encina
Pool with the San Jose Spartans.
With one lamp on the U.C.L.A.
battle down south Friday, Stanford's
aquatic Big Red Machine will plough
into the underdog Spartans in what
is expected to be a warming up ex
ercise for the Indians. It will be the
fans' last chance to see the Card
water dogs in action in the local
plunge until that momentous strug
gle with Cal November 24.
The real treat for water polo fans
on the Farm, however, will very
likely be the preliminary at 4 p.m.
when the Card junior varsity tangles
with the strong Spartan frosh sep
tet, who are conceded a good chance
against the jayvees.
Thornton announced the starling
line-up for the varsity encounter,
which will begin immediately after
the preliminary. Bill Hanna will be
at sprint; Bob Allen and Bob Hoover
at wing forwards; Ben Voss, center
back; Don Peterson and Chuck Gif
fen at guards; and Captain Bob Has

lacher in the goal.
John Lamb, injured sharpshooter
who is being boomed for all confer
ence honors, may not see action to
day, but should be ready for the
crucial Bruin ga.ne in Los Angeles
Friday.
STRAW POLL TOMORROW
