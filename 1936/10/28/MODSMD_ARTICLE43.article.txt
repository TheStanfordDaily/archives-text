# By Moonlight
## 
### 
Ex Committee last night decided to try an
experiment. Starting this Saturday night and
continuing for a week, the Golf Clubhouse will
be open (pending B.A.C. approval and Cardinal
activity) in the evening for dancing and coke
sipping.
Now, the Golf Clubhouse is a long ways away
from the student dream of a Lagunita nightery.
But the fact that it will be open, that it is infor
mal, in an attractive setting, and not too far
away from the campus, gives supporters of the
former project cause to back this one.
There are several things about the Clubhouse
opening that keep it from being a fair indica
tion of the wholesale support that the students
would give to a Lagunita nightclub. The Club
house is not as easy to get to, and distance
might cut down on some of the attendance.
Another thing is that this is U.C.L.A. game
week-end and some of the students will be
traveling.
However, there is a great body of students
on the campus who won't be going South, and
who are just the ones who would want such a
watering place on the campus.
Now, the Clubhouse is in a good spot, as
parked cars about 2 o'clock on any Saturday
night will guarantee, and although it is up on
a hill, it is not too far to walk to. This is the day
and age of the body beautiful, one of whose
prophets advocates walking as the healthiest of
exercises. Also, if my almanac does not fail
me, this Saturday night there is going to be a
moon (a campus moon, sonnie). Also, it is time
to reinstall the old tradition that the Board of
Trustees won't give you your diploma till
you've kissed your sweetie on the Inner Quad
with or without moonlight.
To be quite clear: One-arm driving is dan
gerous and shifting with your knee requires
too much practice. We need a return to the
s'mpler life here on the Farm.
The Cardinals are in charge of this, but it is
up to all of us with visions of a bigger and
batter Back to the Farm movement to show the
higher-ups that there is a real campus need for
a local "joint." If that need is shown, and shown
forcefully, then the rest can follow later.
Benny Goodman records, please, Franich.

away from the campus, gives supporters of the
former project cause to back this one.
There are several things about the Clubhouse
opening that keep it from being a fair indica
tion of the wholesale support that the students
would give to a Lagunita nightclub. The Club
house is not as easy to get to, and distance
might cut down on some of the attendance.
Another thing is that this is U.C.L.A. game
week-end and some of the students will be
traveling.
However, there is a great body of students
on the campus who won't be going South, and
who are just the ones who would want such a
watering place on the campus.
Now, the Clubhouse is in a good spot, as
parked cars about 2 o'clock on any Saturday
night will guarantee, and although it is up on
a hill, it is not too far to walk to. This is the day
and age of the body beautiful, one of whose
prophets advocates walking as the healthiest of
exercises. Also, if my almanac does not fail
me, this Saturday night there is going to be a
moon (a campus moon, sonnie). Also, it is time
to reinstall the old tradition that the Board of
Trustees won't give you your diploma till
you've kissed your sweetie on the Inner Quad
with or without moonlight.
To be quite clear: One-arm driving is dan
gerous and shifting with your knee requires
too much practice. We need a return to the
s'mpler life here on the Farm.
The Cardinals are in charge of this, but it is
up to all of us with visions of a bigger and
batter Back to the Farm movement to show the
higher-ups that there is a real campus need for
a local "joint." If that need is shown, and shown
forcefully, then the rest can follow later.

Ex Committee last night decided to try an
experiment. Starting this Saturday night and
continuing for a week, the Golf Clubhouse will
be open (pending B.A.C. approval and Cardinal
activity) in the evening for dancing and coke
sipping.
Now, the Golf Clubhouse is a long ways away
from the student dream of a Lagunita nightery.
But the fact that it will be open, that it is infor
mal, in an attractive setting, and not too far
away from the campus, gives supporters of the
former project cause to back this one.
