Tonight we have a debate. Tomorrow we
have a straw poll. Stanford is true to thee, poli
tics, in her fashion.
Last official Farm political activity before the
election next Tuesday, today's debate and to
morrow's poll is an example of Stanford's at
tempt to be objective and educational. It is
lucky for Stanford that it is one of the few
institutions which can afford to be.
To any one who peers out at the political
activity from the Farm's Ivory Tower, it must
be a rude shock to see that the issues are not
being decided in an objective or intelligent
manner.
Business men are backing Landon not be
cause of his states' rights interpretation of gov
ernment, but because they see in Roosevelt's
spending policy and his motions for reform, the
threat of heavier taxes on them, and greater
social control of their business.
Laboring men are backing Roosevelt because
'hey feel he holds forth opportunity for them
to organize their unions in a more effective
attempt to raise wages. Those on relief are
backing Roosevelt because they are on relief.
It is only the restricted cloister of the acade

mician that can indulge the fantasy that the
voters are educated in our schools, or that even
if they are educated, they will use that "educa
tion" for anything but the advancement of their
own selfish ends.
Stanford can afford to believe in that fantasy
because it lives off that fantasy.
