Harvard, long the home of the cream of
American collegians, is coming back into its
own at last.
According to a recent issue of the Harvard
Crimson, Cambridge students are really climb
ing the social ladder once again—that is, stu
dents of the right kind, the Crimson hastens to
add.
It seems that Back Bay debutantes are bored
with their present crop of admirers and are out
looking for new fields to conquer. And what
more natural to pick than Harvard, Fair Harvard,
repository for three centuries of all the noblest
and best in American manhood?
But here the debbies come in for a rude shock,
apparently. Insidiously, the hordes of the pro
letariat have been pulling a few fast ones and
a Brooklyn accent is no longer a stranger to
Dunster House and other pleasant Cambridge
haunts.
Matters have been taken in hand quickly,
however, by the gallant members of the Har
vard "better set." And now, the Crimson tells
us, questionnaires are being judiciously and
quietly circulated among a carefully hand
picked group of male blue-bloods, asking their
height, weight, preferences and other vital
statistics to satisfy the demands of Boston's
fairest. Only the best for the best.—The Co
lumbia Spectator
