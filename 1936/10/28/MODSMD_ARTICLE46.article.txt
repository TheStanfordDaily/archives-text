AFFIRM All VELY, NO
The Assembly Hall will not be crowded tonight.
Despite the excessive four-column cut on the front
page, despite publicity placards, notices, and word-of
mouth advertising—Stanford students probably will not
attend the political debate.
So far I have been tactful. Now I am telling you
bluntly that you never even heard of a debate being
given tonight. But you're glad I told you, for now
you won't wander down looking for pictures of the
U.S.C. game.

Frankly, I'm not going to the debate, either. I can
only admire such men as Jim Hill, Bob Mallett, and
Bob Hartman, who are interested enough to study the
campaign before they talk about it.
How do they get time? I guess they're awful smart.
They should be interesting, huh, but we'll go to a
show in Menlo or Mountain View.

You see. you and I don't want to learn anything
about the campaign. It isn't that we don't give a
damn. Oh no, we'd never admit that. It's just that
we've learned to steer clear of things that may change
our views.
After all, we've suffered formulating beautiful little
recipes for life. They've been born of the brain's white
sweat, and we treasure them for the pain they caused
us.
Some of these recipes are quite simple: You're a Re
publican because your dad is one. I'm a Democrat be
cause your dad is a Republican, etc.
* * * *
If we sat on the Assembly Hall's uncompromising
chairs and listened to some intelligent comment, we'd
very likely find those little recipes no longer valid.
Of course we might not but you and I don't feel like
taking the chance, do we?
Wouldn't it be awful for you, with your dad and
your background of respectability, to come out rooting
for Roosevelt. And for me, with my background
(Mother says she's giving it to me even if it kills her)
to come out thinking Landon wasn't an undeveloped
negative? That might happen.
Naturally, you can view the issues objectively and
appreciate the other side—but at the same time, you
can't run the risk of having your intellectual facade
redecorated any more than I can.
So we'll go to a show, and hope for a Mickcy Mouse.
That's redecoration enough.
