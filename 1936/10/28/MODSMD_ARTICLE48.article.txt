# CAMPUS OPINION
## BAND VS. ROOTERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Something's gotta be done. The
band, by itself, is okay. The rooters,
alone, are also okay. But when they
try to put on a combined show, bed
lam results.
Mr. Webb Jones can lead the
rooters, but if he tried to lead both
the rooters and the band, I am afraid
it wouldn't work, simply because he
doesn't know enough about music.
Proof of Webb's lack of knowledge
in this field is seen by the way he
claps his hands after the band plays
the chord to give the rooters the key;
the band will always play "Come
Join the Band" at about 150 beats a
minute, whereas Webb claps his
hands at approximately 110 a min
ute. And that doesn't work. He got
the idea of clapping between the
playing of the chord and the piece
from the U.S.C. yell leaders, but evi
dently he doesn't realize that some
thing done not at all is better than
something done sloppily.
Mr. Bud Fisher, band director, can
lead the band. But he couldn't lead
the rooters and the band combined
because he has no life. He stands
up there with a dead pan and an
equally dead arm. When sitting near
the top of the section, it is hard to
believe that his arm is moving. And
he very seldom glances over to Mr.
Jones to see what that individual is
doing. Perhaps the band director
believes that his group is a separate
section, which should not be both
ered with what the rooters are doing.
Why don't these two guys get to
gether and wox-k out a plan whereby
one of them would lead both groups
v/henever they were combined in a
song. If this is impractical, and I
believe that it is, they should pick
out one person who has the ability
to handle the job, and give him com
plete control over both the band and
rooters.
Something's gotta be done. There's
too much interdepartmental ineffi
ciency.

band, by itself, is okay. The rooters,
alone, are also okay. But when they
try to put on a combined show, bed
lam results.
Mr. Webb Jones can lead the
rooters, but if he tried to lead both
the rooters and the band, I am afraid
it wouldn't work, simply because he
doesn't know enough about music.
Proof of Webb's lack of knowledge
in this field is seen by the way he
claps his hands after the band plays
the chord to give the rooters the key;
the band will always play "Come
Join the Band" at about 150 beats a
minute, whereas Webb claps his
hands at approximately 110 a min
ute. And that doesn't work. He got
the idea of clapping between the
playing of the chord and the piece
from the U.S.C. yell leaders, but evi
dently he doesn't realize that some
thing done not at all is better than
something done sloppily.
Mr. Bud Fisher, band director, can
lead the band. But he couldn't lead
the rooters and the band combined
because he has no life. He stands
up there with a dead pan and an
equally dead arm. When sitting near
the top of the section, it is hard to
believe that his arm is moving. And
he very seldom glances over to Mr.
Jones to see what that individual is
doing. Perhaps the band director
believes that his group is a separate
section, which should not be both
ered with what the rooters are doing.
Why don't these two guys get to
gether and wox-k out a plan whereby
one of them would lead both groups
v/henever they were combined in a
song. If this is impractical, and I
believe that it is, they should pick
out one person who has the ability
to handle the job, and give him com
plete control over both the band and
rooters.
Something's gotta be done. There's
too much interdepartmental ineffi
ciency.
