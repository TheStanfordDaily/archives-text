# END CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Dear Editor:
Seeing that traditions are being
done away with this season, I sin
cerely recommend that the tradition
'of having the student body perform
as carnival actors on Saturday after
noons of fall quarters be brought to
an end.
The B.A.C. would probably not
favor such a move for they can sell
three tickets for every two seats in
' the rooting section and offer as an
I added attraction to the game pretty
little pictures which are colorful but
usually unrecognizable. There would
be no question that the question of
rooters' decorum could be forgotten,
i Tne sprinkling of older alumni and
friends would tend to keep the sim
pler minded students in submission
and would make the games more
enjoyable to all.
By a spreading out of the Stanford
supporters and an increase of the
number of yell leaders, the alumni
and friends would have a chance to
join in on our cheers and songs.
This idea is prevalent throughout
the East and the cheering there is at
least equal to that out here on the
coast. Regimented rooting riles me.
I'm for enjoyable Saturdays without
the sideshow, but I guess that too
many "Roughs" think that they look
too, too cute in a rooters' hat and the
gals thinks pom-poms are good fun
j to buy as well as wave.
