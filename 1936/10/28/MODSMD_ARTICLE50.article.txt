"PORTRAIT OF AN ERA" (as
drawn by C. D. Gibson) by Fair
fax Downey. At the Stanford
Book Store.
To our grandparents and even our
parents Charles Dana Gibson was as
much of an institution as the bicycle
of Queen Victoria. He was the cre
ator of the Gibson girl, that gracious
bundle of vanquished femininity
about whom plays were written,
songs sung, revues staged. But in
magazines, books, and exhibitions he
also drew an era. That era of the
bouncing '90's Fairfax Downey here
recreates for us through an account
of the illustrator's life, copious re
productions of his work. ,
Charles Dana Gibson's rise from a
penniless boyhood to fame and
riches reads amazingly like a Horatio
Alger story, "Sink or Swim," per
haps, or "From Rags to Riches."
When the 19-year-old lad walked
into the oflice of "Life" one winter's
day in 1886, he did not dream the
portfolio of drawings under his arm
would be accepted, that he would
one day be the magazine's outstand
ing contributor, carry it to- new
heights of popularity.
"Life's" editor, "John Ames Mitch
ell, was a reformer and Gibson was
first set to work as a political car
toonist and a social satirist. A vio
lent cartoon lampooned Cleveland

for his free trade policy, a series of
others on Metropolitan Museum of
ficials for refusing to admit the pub
lic on the Sabbath. A Gibson-
Mitchell solution of war threats of
1887 showed European monarchs
bound to the mouths of their own
cannon, while a series of illustra
tions for "The Anglomaniacs" at
tacked those Americans who aped
British fads and customs.
But Gibson was not at heart a so
cial reformer. He disliked personal
rancours, shied really from contro
versial issues. The social cartoon
was his milieu—the slightly senti
mental delineations of lover's quar
rels and cooings with such captions
as "The First Affair," "Yes and No,"
and "The Greatest Game in the
World—His Move," romance over a
checkerboard.
In 1890 the "Gibson girl" made
her appearance. Tall, statuesque,
with wavy blonde hair, her ample
curves and her noble, if somewhat
vacuous, features—every woman the
illustrator conceived, save for a few
doughty matrons, was a "Gibson
girl." Tlie "Helen of Troy and Cleo
patra" of gallants of the 90's, she
soon became the feminine ideal; girls
in every walk of life looked to Gib
son to tell them "how to dress, sit,
stand, enter vehicles, walk, and
cat."
At the outbreak of the war, Gib
son immediately enlisted his pen in
the cause, became head of the War
Department's Division of Publicity,
and drew scathing "hate the Kaiser"

pen drawings, vigorous volunteer
posters. It is typical of Gibson that
the war should not have embittered
his rather sugary art. A typical Ar
mistice illustration in "Life" was
"He's Coming Back," caption for the
pretty girl radiantly reading a letter.
Gibson rarely saw anything but life's
cheery side.
The flapper spelled the doom of
the Gibson girl. With the war the
statuesque woman with the Grecian
features and the refined mien was

definitely outre. Dana Gibson's few
efforts to reproduce this new woman
were formless and unconvincing. He
could not, would not, draw her.
