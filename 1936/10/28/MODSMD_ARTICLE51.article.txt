WES PEGLER, Scripps-Howard
columnist, has for some weeks now
been herding a choice flock of Re
publican turkeys who are just about
ready to be plucked by sporting
minded Democrats whose money
speaks as loud as their opinions.
This spectacle of free pelf to be
had for the asking has made Steve
Enke, shining light of the local
Young Demos, writhe with desire.
The Demos are burdened with a $25
profit from their recent jolly-up,
which they wish to lay on their filly's
nose.
Unfortunately, all of Pegler's col
lection of hand-nurtured elephants
are already spoken for by the sharp
penned columnist's friends.
So Enke is sending out an 5.0.5.,
through this column, for anyone
who owns one of those shy little
creatures, a monetarily adequate Re
publican. If you have one on your
preserve, please cut Stevie in!
A CERTAIN RESTAURANT in
San Francisco names some of its
choicer double-deck sandwiches
after well-known personalities. The
"Mayor Rossi" is a combined boiled
ham and Swiss cheese. The "Rudy
Vallee" is baked ham and turkey.
GOOI) TUNE that will go places
when published: Harry Barris' "Life
Is Wonderful."
GRATITUDE: Columbia staged an
elaborate salute to station KMOX,
St. Louis, last week in comemoration
of the station's birthday. And then
KMOX didn't carry the program.
