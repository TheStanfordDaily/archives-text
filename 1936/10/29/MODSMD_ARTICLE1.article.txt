# Mallett Hit Of Debate As Mock F.R.
## Six Students Participate Before Large Crowd; Ed Lindblom Scores 
### 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, him
self, stalked the stage of the Assem
bly Hall last night, waggled his head,
shook his finger, and said "My
Friends."
And this Franklin, a remarkably
comical duplicate of the Washington
original, wore a sunflower. He was
Bob Mallett, who shouldered the Re
publican burden of argument in the
inter-party debate which brought six

students into a discussion of party
aims and promises, saw Dr. Wilbur
as permanent chairman, and Bob
Gros as a prc-argument master of
ceremonies.
Owens, ilartmann
Upholding the New Deal were
Claude Owens and Bob Hartmann,
who emphasized Roosevelt's power
of leadership, but belittled comment
on political policies, since "there is
really no difference in the two major
platforms."
Republican adherents, Bob North
and Mallett, attempted to prove that
Roosevelt has retarded recovery.
This assertion was refuted and re
juvenated with numerous contradic
tory statistics and statements.
North objected to the Democrats'
desire for an outstanding man, say
ing, "Let's don't have supermen in
office, who can't read the calendar
when they look at it."
Down with Everything
The symposium amounted to talks
by upholders of the Communist and
Socialist parties. In a "bourgeois
tuxedo," William Harrover, speak
ing for the Communist party, criti
cized the major parties, explaining
that "an earthquake could have done
as much as the New Deal."
Begging his hearers to forget prej
udices against the word "socialism,"
Edward Lindblom showed his utter
disdain for the Communists. "A
Communist is more than a Socialist
in a hurry," he said. "He is a So
cialist on a drunk!"
Like Lindblom
Lindblom received heavy applause
after his remarks, which centered
around the necessity of readjusting
our economic system instead of ar
guing about trivialities.
The crowd of something over 400
was considered an encouraging turn
out by Gros, who was particularly
pleased by the "liveness" of the
audience.

Claude Owens and Bob Hartmann,
who emphasized Roosevelt's power
of leadership, but belittled comment
on political policies, since "there is
really no difference in the two major
platforms."
Republican adherents, Bob North
and Mallett, attempted to prove that
Roosevelt has retarded recovery.
This assertion was refuted and re
juvenated with numerous contradic
tory statistics and statements.
North objected to the Democrats'
desire for an outstanding man, say
ing, "Let's don't have supermen in
office, who can't read the calendar
when they look at it."
Down with Everything
The symposium amounted to talks
by upholders of the Communist and
Socialist parties. In a "bourgeois
tuxedo," William Harrover, speak
ing for the Communist party, criti
cized the major parties, explaining
that "an earthquake could have done
as much as the New Deal."
Begging his hearers to forget prej
udices against the word "socialism,"
Edward Lindblom showed his utter
disdain for the Communists. "A
Communist is more than a Socialist
in a hurry," he said. "He is a So
cialist on a drunk!"
Like Lindblom
Lindblom received heavy applause
after his remarks, which centered
around the necessity of readjusting
our economic system instead of ar
guing about trivialities.
The crowd of something over 400
was considered an encouraging turn
out by Gros, who was particularly
pleased by the "liveness" of the
audience.
