# Campus Big Shots Call It Landon's Poll
## 
### 
If the guesses of several prominent
Farm students are right, the wind
will probably blow Landonward in
the presidential straw vote to be con
ducted by The Daily today.
Chick Franich, chairman of the
Cardinals, says, "I think that there
are a sufficient number of naive Re
publicans on the campus for Landon
to win the poll."
From assistant cheer leader Jim
Ransohoff comes a very definite re
ply: "Landon. I expect him to lead
I 3 to 2. Stanford after all is a con
servative campus."
Enke Pessimistic
The head of the Young Democrats
Club, Stephen Enke. admits, "I doubt
if Stanford students will be able to
forget their pocket book'and so will
vote Republican."
Barbara Kimball, president of
Women's Conference, agrees that
Landon will probably swing Stan
ford. She states, "I think that there
is enough egg on people's lapels to
indicate that Stanford might very
easily go Republican."
"Doodles" Speaks
In line with the majority belief
Winstead Weaver says, "It is my
opinion that at Stanford Landon will
come out ahead because parents of
Stanford students who can afford to
send their children here must have
suffered financial set-backs due to
Roosevelt's onerous taxes and prob
ably recommended that they vote in
favor of the Republicans."
Jacqueline Brown, member of Ex
Committee, dares to disagree with
the general verdict: "The campus
seems so evenly divided it is hard
to tell how the vote will come out.
But I hope that we have enough en
lightened individuals to swing it to
Roosevelt."
The Dazzling Democrats claim
that the only reason the Republicans
held even 63 per cent of the campus
last election was because Hoover
was a Stanford alumnus, and senti
ment was the sword that sheared the
Donkey's drapery. They also claim
that back in Chicago the Republican
bettors are asking four to one odds
before they will lay any of the hard
mazuma on the line for the Flower
of Kansas.
Campus Chooses
The Rousing Republicans, on the
other hand, think that's a lot of
blarney, and have it all doped out
that publicity by John M. D. (Doc
tor of Morale) Hamilton hooked up
with Latidon's radiant, smiling pus
sonality will whitewash all opposi
tion.
That's just the build-up the drum
mers are staging, and somebody's
going to look like an awful liar
when the Daily poll results are re
vealed. There won't be any need to
wait until the actual election comes
off: the campus will decide it.
The slight discrepancy between the
campus vote of 1932 and the actual
result has been explained away as
a big double - cross â€” some dirty
Democrat stuffed the ballot box
while the Republican campaign
manager wasn't looking. The Daily
poll still is batting 1000 per cent.
