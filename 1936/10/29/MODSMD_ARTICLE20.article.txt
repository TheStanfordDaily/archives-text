If the Stanford campus in the elec
tion today from 8:30 to 1:30 at the
Law Steps chooses Roosevelt, Gov
ernor .Alfie-Walfie might just as well
go bac kto Kansas and hang up his

the Airlanes can start packing his
trunk.

be sentinelized and tabulated under
the guarding glare of Dave Allison
and the election committee, there
will be published in tomorrow's
Daily a ballot score showing how the
faculty stands on the subject of the
