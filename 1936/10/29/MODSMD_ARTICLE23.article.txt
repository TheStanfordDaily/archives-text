THE PRICE OF PANTS
Where is the guy who thinks that
fifteen dollars is too much to pay for
a pair of policeman's pants? Where
is the upstart who dares suggest that
ijIG to the cop is nothing short of a
windfall for the cop.'
Man, don't you know you can't
cavil at justice or ridicule the mighty
arm of the law? That's contempt of
court. Besides, you just don't know
your Palo Alto.
# * *
What do you think Palo Alto is,
anyway, just another hick town? Of
course it isn't, it is a positive gem
of the peninsula and you don't catch
ihe cops wearing ordinary blue serge
pants like any old cop could wear.
Palo Alto is a fine town where only
ihe finest is tolerated, and their
tandards, suh, are not dropped when
t comes to policemen's pants.
After all, even a policeman has got
to look his best. Of course Officer
Dakin comes to court without bene
{. t of necktie, but when he is on
duty, that's a different story. Maybe
Ihe Phelps-Terkel influenced has hit
him, too, or maybe he figures that it's
time to change to winter underwear
and autumn pants. If he has been
riding Esquire, he will notice that
the man about the country ajid the
I : operly dressed cop will wear
n ugh brown tweed. Only he ought
to add just a fleck of red and white
to the cloth, to remind him of how
h got the new pants in the first
p! :ce.

lut if he got that kind of pants,
1, (1 have to get a whole outfit to
nr tch. He'd need a good loud
: i use-coat and two-toned shoes to
go with the pants. That would run
II i into money, and if he figures the
!if<;>en bucks would only pay sales
la: for a spiffy new outfit like that,
why doesn't he borrow money from
S. V Scherer? Of course the officer
>ws about S. A. Scherer and how
\ , | can get cash in 5 minutes with
no payments for (>0 days. Maybe he
he L'd about him on the police radio
when there were no calls and they
dialed the phonograph-record sta
ti. .is.
Cut for that matter, he wouldn't
}.; ve to go to S. A. Scherer. He could
0 , to the Federal Outfitting Com
pany and get a whole outfit, suit,
l:;.i, topcoat, shoes, socks, under
war and garters all for one dollar
d vn and one dollar a week. He
c<,.:ld even go down to Mose on High
Street, where he could have the
whole place and Mose all for 15
1 cks. And certainly there is a pair
( , pants in Mose's inventory that
would come pretty close to match
ing the torn pair. Why doesn't he
! y that?
* * *
All right now, Sergeant Dakin.
t'"i all for you and all that, but
wi ere did you buy that famous torn
pa r of pants in the first place? I'd
lik • to see the clip joint that would
charge 15 stone for a pair of pants—
any pair of pants.
