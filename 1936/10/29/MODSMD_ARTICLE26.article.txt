# Dock Strike Sure as Zero Hour Nears
## F.D.R. 'Miracle Message' Only Hope To Prevent Tie-up of S.F. Shipping 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28 (UP).â€”
A maritime strike that will close
America's gateway to the Orient and
paralyze the great West Coast ship
ping industry appeared inevitable
tonight.
Barring a last minute miracle,
leaders of seven sea and dock unions
are expected to issue a strike call at
midnight or shortly thereafter. They
were given that power this week in
a referendum of the union member
ship, which voted more than 9 to 1
to authorize the walkout.
McGrady Tails
President Roosevelt appeared to be
the only one now who can produce
the "miracle." Mayor Angelo Rossi
of San Francisco appealed to the
Chief Executive to act after all other
efforts to bring together Pacific Coast
shipowners and the representatives
of 35.000 workers on fundamental
issues of new contracts failed.
Even Mr. Roosevelt's ace trouble
shooter in labor troubles, Edward F.
McGrady, Assistant Secretary of
Labor, was balked by the stubborn
ness of the workers in insisting on
changes in the contracts McGrady
helped negotiate to settle the 1934
strike.
Efforts Continued
McGrady brought the operators
and the representatives of several
unions into conference today. After
a two-hour session, he reluctantly
admitted "No progress has been
made." He will continue his efforts
up to the last minute.
The Federal Maritime Commis
sion, brought into being prematurely
by the President to act in the emer
gency, failed similarly.
The situation tonight was the
same as it was the night of October
1 when tlx; unions were ready to
strike. McGrady succeeded that time
in wangling a 15-day truce from the
belligerents and intervention of the
Maritime Commission extended the
peace 13 additional days.
