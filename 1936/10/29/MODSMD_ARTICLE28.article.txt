# F.R. Ends Drive In New York
## Sure That 'Sidewalks Of New York' Want Him 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 28 (U.R).â€”'Tired
but happy, President Roosevelt was
convinced tonight that the sidewalks
of New York would give him the
powerful 47 electoral votes of his
native state when the ballots are
counted Tuesday.
The chief executive based his
hopes on the enthusiasm of the hu
man outpouring that greeted him as
he toured and spoke throughout the
entire metropolitan area on a pro
gram that lasted all day.
His visit was the prelude to a sec
ond campaign swing to New York
that will begin Friday and end late
Saturday with a major address in
Madison Square Garden.
