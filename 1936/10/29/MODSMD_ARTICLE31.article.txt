# Wagon Wheels Roll Onto Stage For "Roadside" Drama
## 
### 
"Wagon wheels, carry me homo"
is no novelty, but wagon wheels
carried into the Assembly Hall most
assuredly are. In fact wagon wheels
practically anywhere are a rarity
nowadays. The ones in question
were finally located and "borrowed"
from an obviously unnamed ranch.
Though this all sounds like a typi
cal Encina prank, it is only a part of
the stage set for the forthcoming
production "Roadside," according to
technical director Orville Goldner.
He explained that after the historical
objects were obtained and trans
ported to the Assembly Hall, they
were found to be too large to roll
down the aisle to the stage. Ac
cordingly, workmen were obliged
to spread planks across the rows of
seats and roll the troublesome props

down over them.
Goldner also explained that the
student-constructed set used in the
play is built on a plan similar to that
of a revolving stage. The background
of the first act can be shifted about
quickly to disclose the setting of
the second act, which is built on the
other side.
The action of the drama centers
about a group of hill-billies in the
year 190(i. Now in rehearsal under
the direction of Gordon Lange, di
rector of dramatics, it is scheduled
for performance November 6.
