# Fascists Not Aiding Spain, Board Agrees
## Non-intervention Group Spikes Soviet Charges Of Aid to Insurgents 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 28 (U.R).—The In
ternational Committee for Non-in
tervention in Spain announced to- j
night in an official communique that
it had agreed Russia's charges of !
Italian and Portuguese aid to Span
ish rebels had not been proved. The
Soviet delegates on the Committee
dissented.
In the end, nothing was settled and
the tension between the supporters
of rebels and loyalists in Spain was :
unrelieved. Ambassador Ivan Mai
sky of the Soviet Union presented an
"explanation" of Russia's statement j
last Friday. It said, in effect, that
Moscow was willing to respect the |
non-intervention convention if the
Fascists did—but that the world ;
knew they didn't.
Italy, represented by Ambassador
Dino Grandi, presented 20 new spe
cific instances where he said Russia
had aided the Spanish loyalists by
sinews of war.
The commission decided that Rus- 1
sia should continue its membership, j
despite its recent declaration that it !
no longer felt bound by terms of the '
pact.
Grandi also submitted a proposal
that the committee henceforth sub
ject its meetings to pitiless publicity.
He said that fuller and more com- j
prehensive communiques should be i
issued.
Although assuring the committee
that Soviet Russia still was sup

porting the non-intervention the
ory, the note said it assumed that
"equal obligations rest on all par
ticipants."
"A violation of the agreement by
even one of them," it added, "re
lieves other participants of their
obligations.
"The Soviet Government, like
probably the whole world, is firmly
convinced that even alter the agree
ment came into effect, governments
sympathizing with the objects and

aims of the Spanish rebels continued
abundantly to supply them with
military airplanes, tanks, artillery
and machine-guns."
The Soviet note did not specify the
nations meant, but earlier Russia had
named them as Germany, Italy and
Portugal.
Governor Perry of Virginia is one
of 10 governors in the United States
who has both a bachelor's and ad
vanced decree.

LONDON, Oct. 28 (U.R).—The In
ternational Committee for Non-in
tervention in Spain announced to- j
night in an official communique that
it had agreed Russia's charges of !
Italian and Portuguese aid to Span
ish rebels had not been proved. The
Soviet delegates on the Committee
dissented.
In the end, nothing was settled and
the tension between the supporters
of rebels and loyalists in Spain was :
unrelieved. Ambassador Ivan Mai
sky of the Soviet Union presented an
"explanation" of Russia's statement j
last Friday. It said, in effect, that
Moscow was willing to respect the |
non-intervention convention if the
Fascists did—but that the world ;
knew they didn't.
Italy, represented by Ambassador
Dino Grandi, presented 20 new spe
cific instances where he said Russia
had aided the Spanish loyalists by
sinews of war.
The commission decided that Rus- 1
sia should continue its membership, j
despite its recent declaration that it !
no longer felt bound by terms of the '
pact.
Grandi also submitted a proposal
that the committee henceforth sub
ject its meetings to pitiless publicity.
He said that fuller and more com- j
prehensive communiques should be i
issued.
Although assuring the committee
that Soviet Russia still was sup

porting the non-intervention the
ory, the note said it assumed that
"equal obligations rest on all par
ticipants."
"A violation of the agreement by
even one of them," it added, "re
lieves other participants of their
obligations.
"The Soviet Government, like
probably the whole world, is firmly
convinced that even alter the agree
ment came into effect, governments
sympathizing with the objects and

aims of the Spanish rebels continued
abundantly to supply them with
military airplanes, tanks, artillery
and machine-guns."
The Soviet note did not specify the
nations meant, but earlier Russia had
named them as Germany, Italy and
Portugal.

vanced decree.
