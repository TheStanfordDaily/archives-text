# Pre-Season Track Set-up Promising
## Practice Figures Show Voigt, Weiershauser In Excellent Form 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Dink Templeton's track team is
working tirelessly these days, get
ting in some good work before the
rains set in, and conforming strictly
to the Templeton training theory:
get in good shape now, and stay that
way till the competitive season js
come and gone.
Already the weekly practice meets
and other time trials have turned
out a bunch of figures that might
show who will do what next year.
Sprints: Stan Hiserman 10.1 and
Chuck Voigt look very promising;
Jimmy Kneubuhl has not yet
up to expectations.
440: Jack Weiershauser and Ray
Malott 50.1 are better off than they
were last year at this time. Cy
Oberg, Gordy Hyde, and Wilson
Slater are also in good form.
880: Malott 2:02.6 and Bill Mc-
Curdy will be powerhouses here;
Carl Mahurin also is getting his
times down.
Mile: Bob Alexander 4:30.8 will
have a real winning season—he and
Dink have been working like slaves,
and their efforts are beginning to
bear fruit. McCurdy has done 4:23.8
already here.
Two-Mile: Sadly depleted by Ed
Burrows' breaking his leg; Burrows,
who did 9:25.3 last year, an unoffi
cial Stanford record by seven
lengths, may be off the track a short |
while, maybe a very long while.
John Dern and Workhorse Eman
uel will hold it down.
Hurdles: Johnny Hewitt at 16 flat
and 25.5. Weiershauser, Oberg, and
Dick Bale at 25.6.
High Jump Dick Morrison leading
at 6 feet; Hank Luisetti and John
Moller, lettermen, haven't appeared
as yet. Ben Smith and Jack Siefert
have hit 5-9.
Broad Jump is low, with Leo Mad
lem out for football. Voigt at 22 feet
is the best.
Javelin: Walker, Brownton, and
Kellogg at 180 are standouts; Stone
and Hardin haven't appeared yet.
Pole Vault: Vic Boor and Sumner
Gill now vaulting about 12-6.
Weights: Jim Reynolds, Mel Hur
ley, George Bergmann, Jack Lipp
man, Jack King. Reynolds has done
46-9, Hurley 135 feet. They are
waiting for Zagar.

Chuck Voigt look very promising;
Jimmy Kneubuhl has not yet
up to expectations.
440: Jack Weiershauser and Ray
Malott 50.1 are better off than they
were last year at this time. Cy
Oberg, Gordy Hyde, and Wilson
Slater are also in good form.
880: Malott 2:02.6 and Bill Mc-
Curdy will be powerhouses here;
Carl Mahurin also is getting his
times down.
Mile: Bob Alexander 4:30.8 will
have a real winning season—he and
Dink have been working like slaves,
and their efforts are beginning to
bear fruit. McCurdy has done 4:23.8
already here.
Two-Mile: Sadly depleted by Ed
Burrows' breaking his leg; Burrows,
who did 9:25.3 last year, an unoffi
cial Stanford record by seven
lengths, may be off the track a short |
while, maybe a very long while.
John Dern and Workhorse Eman
uel will hold it down.
Hurdles: Johnny Hewitt at 16 flat
and 25.5. Weiershauser, Oberg, and
Dick Bale at 25.6.
High Jump Dick Morrison leading
at 6 feet; Hank Luisetti and John
Moller, lettermen, haven't appeared
as yet. Ben Smith and Jack Siefert
have hit 5-9.
Broad Jump is low, with Leo Mad
lem out for football. Voigt at 22 feet
is the best.
Javelin: Walker, Brownton, and
Kellogg at 180 are standouts; Stone
and Hardin haven't appeared yet.
Pole Vault: Vic Boor and Sumner
Gill now vaulting about 12-6.
Weights: Jim Reynolds, Mel Hur
ley, George Bergmann, Jack Lipp
man, Jack King. Reynolds has done
46-9, Hurley 135 feet. They are
waiting for Zagar.
Dink Templeton's track team is
working tirelessly these days, get
ting in some good work before the
rains set in, and conforming strictly
to the Templeton training theory:
get in good shape now, and stay that
way till the competitive season js
come and gone.
Already the weekly practice meets
and other time trials have turned
out a bunch of figures that might
show who will do what next year.
Sprints: Stan Hiserman 10.1 and
Chuck Voigt look very promising;
Jimmy Kneubuhl has not yet
up to expectations.
