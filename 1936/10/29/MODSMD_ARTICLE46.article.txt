# All-School Fistics Draw Ring Novices
## 
### 
A short-cut to fistic glory is to be
offered Stanford men in an all-uni
versity novice boxing tournament
scheduled for November 10, 11, and
12.
Any man who has not previously
won a boxing title is eligible for the
competition. The tourney has been
conducted successfully in recent
years, but a large turn-out is neces
sary to assure continuance.
Boxing Coach John Priddle will
receive all applications in the men's
gymnasium. There will be no weight
restrictions. All divisions from
featherweight to heavyweight will be
represented.
