# Crosby's Skippy Rides G.O.P. Elephant in Homing Selection
## Comic Character Rivals Landon's Enthusiasm 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Skippy is a Republican! At least
the father of this comic strip hero
is as ardent a supporter of The
Party as you can find. In fact, Percy
Crosby rivals Mr. Landon in en
thusiasm for the G.O.P. cause.
First knowledge of this state of
affairs came to general notice when,
nearly a year ago, Mr. Crosby cir
culated a pamphlet entitled "De
fense of the Administration Against
the Charges of the Russian Ambas
sador."
The cartoonist evidently got in
side dope that Russia Vas accusing
Roosevelt of being untrue to the
Communist Party. Very conclusive
and scholarly was Mr. Crosby's de
fense of the President against these
charges, which he termed ridiculous.
The implication is that everyone
knows that Roosevelt is a lousy,
hairy Communist.
Book Inspires Comment
Such a booklet was bound to in
spire comment, and a number of
people wrote to the cartoonist, ask
ing, rather discourteously, who paid
him to put out this guff.
Weeks rolled by. Eminent artists
evidently don't like to write letters.
Along in June, however, these in
quiries were answered, after a fash
ion. That is, the inquirers were
looked upon as likely buyers of Mr.
Crosby's new book, "Three Cheers
for the Red, Red, and Red," a "force
ful attack on the policies of the New
Deal."
Announcement Released
Recently, another of these blanket
announcements was released. No,
moreover, by Percy, but by A. D.
Crosby, ostensibly the cartoonist's
brother. At present, we have Mr.
(Skippy) Crosby ill from overwork
and Mr. (Brother) Crosby handling
sales of this remarkable book.
Ranks Thinned
Observers deem it unfortunate
that the Crosby ranks are thinned
at this momentous moment. This is
almost a calamity, since all resources
available are expected to be neces
sary in selling this masterpiece of
current intellectual writing.
