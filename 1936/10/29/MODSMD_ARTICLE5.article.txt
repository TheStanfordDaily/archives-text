# Silver Screen To Pick Five
## 'Road Back' Tests Set For Today in Little Theater 
### 
Universal Pictures comes to Stan
ford today, as Test Director Sylvan
Simon and a crew of worthy min
ions hold tryouts for all men stu
dents 17 to 22 years old in the Little
Theater from 1 to 6 o'clock this after
noon in an effort to find five players
to fit leading roles in the forthcoming
production, "The Road Back."
As a sequel to "All Quiet on Ihe
Western Front" produced a few
years ago by the same company, this
picture will carry on the tragic plot
with a story of how five young sol
diers stumbled through the after
math of the war trying to find them
selves.
Suitable applicants interviewed by
Simon will be photographed by
Stanley Cortez, cameraman brother
of Actor Ricardo. These shots will
be sent to Hollywood for inspection
by Director James Whale. The ones
chosen by him only have to hop the
sound test hurdle to be off and away
for the movies.
Those who wish to heed the call of
galorious galamorous Pictureland
and can't make it to the Little The
ater to get in with the common
horde can make arrangements with
Mrs. Coverley, Student Employment
Office, for interviews.
If Universal doesn't find the five
Barrymores here another stand will
be made at Berkeley for Cal, St.
Mary's, and U.S.F. students who
have an urge for southern atmos
phere.
