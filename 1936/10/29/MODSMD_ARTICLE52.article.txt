Yesterday afternoon for the first
time this seaon, all of the six regu
larly scheduled intramural football
games were played, with nary a for
feited contest marring the records.
Easily the outstanding game, from
the point of spectator intez*est, was
that between Zeta Psi and Phi Psi,
with the latter aggregation eking out
a 9-7 win.
Zetes Come Back
Early in the first half the Zetes

took the lead on a nicely executed
pass play from Reid to Atkinson.
Ditz added the extra poinSon a pass
from Wallace.
In the second half .with the Zetes
pretty much on the offensive, Phi
Psi's halfback Smith snatched an
opposition pass out of the ozone and
lugged it 50 yards to a score, thus
putting his outfit back in the run
ning. The conversion try, however,
was blocked, leaving the score in
tact at 7-6.
Nothing daunted, the Phi Psi's
continued their comeback rush, and
culminated their attack in the final
30 seconds when Spaulding split the
cross-bars with a 30-yard drop
kick field goal.
In another feature game, Fiji I,
with the Surfass to Davis pass com
bination clicking nicely, snowed
Kappa % Alpha under, 20-0.
Delts Win
The Delta Chi - Japanese Club
scramble found the Delts, bearing
down under unexpected competition,
blasting out a close win in the last
half, 6-0. Fremlin was credited with
the winning score on a pass from
Sullivan.
In the remaining games the Med
School Sophs squeezed out an over
time 7-6 win over Los Arcos, with
Collins starring for the winners,
while Phi Delta Phi II was squelch
ing Chi Psi 11, 6-0. Oudi was re
sponsible for the winning touch
down in the latter game.
A sign-up chart for intramural
handball has been posted on the
B.A.C. bulletin board. Play will get
under way in approximately a week.
