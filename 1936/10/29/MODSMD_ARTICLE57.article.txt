# Tiny's Boys Hit Rails For Los Angeles, Pasadena, Coliseum, UCLA, Biltmore
## Spring Street Weisenheimers Slap Oil 2-1 Odds Against Cards, but Gridders Plan To Spill Dope Bucket with Win 
### 
Thirty-six sons of the Stanford Red will board the Lark at 9:13 tonight;
destination Los Angeles; and purpose to pay a social call on a party known
as the Westwood Bruins.
Still well fired up over the contest in the Coliseum Saturday, though
the odds will probably hit 2 to 1 against them between now and then,

Tiny's football entourage plans a 1
workout in the Coliseum tomorrow
afternoon, a stay in Pasadena that
night, and at the Biltmore Saturday
night.
Those to Go
Traveling will be: Ends, Stone,
Clark, Rasmussen, Munger, Schott,
Olcotet, Cummings. Tackles: Zagar,
Callaway, Chant, Mangan, West,
Shannon. Guards: Matthews, Ferko,
Holdridge, D. McMillan, F. McMil
lan, Walton, D. Brigham. Centers:

Quarterbacks: Hoos, Garnier,

gna, Kirsch, Coffis, Luckett, Madlem,

Collins. Completing the group will
be Coaches Thornhill, Lawson,
Grayson, and Winkleman; Trainer
Kile; Dr. Blake Wilbur; and Man
agers Lisberger ,Young, and Hovey.
Practice yesterday dwelt again on
play formations; the backs were get
ting a lot of work against U.C.L.A.
plays, especially deep passes, at
which the Bruins are particularly
dangerous. Linemen worked a bit
on dummy scrimmage.
Calvelli Still In
Tony Calvelli was still at the first
string fullback position, and Fred
Williams was at right half, both the
first alterations Tiny has made on
his starting eleven since Washington
State.
Zagar's bruised hip and Ferko's
broken nose, the only recent inju
ries to the Cardinal forces, are caus
ing very little pain or worry, and the
squad is considered in as fine a con
dition as it has reached yet this
season.
The Uclans are worrying over
Captain George Dickerson and Pete
Barber, their starting tackles who
are under the weather but expected
to be ready to roll on Saturday.
These gents are the strength of the
Bruin line, together with Sherman
Chavoor, the Armenian center who
is being boomed for all-coast again
this year.
Funk Flashes
The Uelan backfield is said to be
in fine shape: Harris at quarter dues
the blocking; Funk at right half is
said by some to be the best kicker
west of St. Louis and no slouch at
running or passing, while Bob Wil
liams at fullback is a hard-pounding,
fast ball carrier. The left half, or

principal ball-carrying spot, is held
down by Bill Spaulding Jr., Hirshon,
and Ferguson, each of them just as
fast and just as rugged as the other.
The ends are Robinson and Bob
Schroeder, president of the student
body down thar'.
