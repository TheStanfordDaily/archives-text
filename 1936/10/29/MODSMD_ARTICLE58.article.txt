# Frosh Footballers Prepare To End Season with Bang
## Cal Game To Close Year; Line-up Shifted, Nowell Promoted to Center 
### 
With the all - important clash
against California only two weeks
away, Stanford's freshman pigskin
pastimers are grooming themselves
to wind up their season with a pair
of victories.
First of the anticipated triumphs
is supposed to be scored against San
Mateo J.C. next Saturday. Second
on the list of prospective victims is
the Cal frosh outfit, whom the Pa
pooses play at Berkeley in their
last game. Last week the California
yearlings earned a 7-2 decision over
San Mateans.
According to Wes Muller, who
scouted the Cal-San Mateo scuffle,
the defeated team was defensively
very tough, allowing the baby bears
only three yards inside tackle all
afternoon. Consequently it was not
surprising to see the Shipkey pro
teges spend considerable time throw
ing and catching passes in yester
day's practice session. Chet Patton
and Howard Hickingbotham did
most of the tossing.
A new face appeared in the ever
changing freshman lineup, when Pat
Nowell popped up at the center
position while Hugh Radke, former
occupant of that post, played on the
second team. Patton was back at
fullback after an absence of nearly
a month. Tom Walker, Chad Reade,
and Gene Coldiron held the other
backfield jobs.
