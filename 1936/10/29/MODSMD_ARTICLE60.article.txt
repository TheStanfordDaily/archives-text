THE A.P. AND
ITS BIG TEAMS
The Associated Press is getting out
a list of the best teams of the coun
try, with votes among sports writ
ers through the country deciding the
issues each week.
Now these polls are interesting, not
that sports writers know anything
about it—they don't—but interesting
in the results they put forth.
Minnesota is way out in front, as
she should be, and they have Pitts
burgh and Northwestern at 2 and 3.
These squads I suppose are tough,
but Pittsburgh slipped enough to be
beaten by Duquesne a while back.
The Huskies still lead the coast
contingent in fourth place, .with
Southern Cal the next in seventh,
behind Fordham and Army. Now
this is all very nice, except that it
looks like they have one voter out
here and 20 or so in New York City.
The Cougars, who tied the seventh
place team and have been winning
all their others before and since, are
not in the fh\st 20, while the Bruins,
who probably have a tie for the sec
ond best team out here and probably
will wap the seventh place team
Thanksgiving Day, likewise are out
in the cold.
Santa Clara, the only undefeated
squad left on the Coast, is just barely
on board at 19th spot, while St.
Mary sis in a tie lor twentieth.
Seems very evident that the boys
look at the "Football Results" score
column Sunday morning, and then
vote, before the night before has
worn off.
FOOTBALL—AND
SUDDEN DEATH
Football deaths are also again
coming into the picture—they always
do by this time of the year. It is the
same story again: of 17 fatalities so
far, two were college players, and
the rest distributed between sand
lots and high schools.
Without thinking of the thousands
of kids that go in for the sport each
year and the low per capita fatality
rate, a lot of cartoonists will redraw
that figure of Death hovering over
the stadium. Think this time, though,
boys; better draw it hovering over
the prep school practice field, or bet
ter yet, the 9-year-old game on the
village green.
ROSE BOWL—
THE ETERNAL PROBLEM
The Rose Bowl pickers are at work
again already, and they find them
selves behind the nine ball on the
Pacific Coast. The only undefeated
team out here, the Broncs, are inde
pendents, and independents are not
selected. Not that there is a rule
against it. but the Conference man
agers pick the representative, and
they always keep it among them
selves.
The East has eight undefeated,
untied teams: Villanova, Army, Holy

Cross, Fordham, Minnesota, Yale,
and Marquette, but all have school
or league policies preventing them
from competing in the Rose Bowl
except four: Villanova, Holy Cross,
Marquette, and Fordham.
Of these probably only Holy Cross
will come through the rest of the
year undefeated .so we may have to
dip down in the marred records for
an eastern representative.
HIALEAII PARK ANI)
THE STANFORD STADIUM
There comes word that Howard
Jones is backing possibilities of* a
"camera eye" for football games —
cameras to be placed over each goal
line to record questionable plays.
Prints will be developed whenever
the referee calls for them, and pho
tographic decisions will be final, ac
cording to the plans.
"We will always have trouble
while we use the present system,"
Jones says. "The referee cannot call
a play justly. He is behind the ball
carrier and must rely on what he is
told by the head linesman. In many
cases the head linesman must ex
plain he couldn't see if a touchdown
was scored because (here were sev
eral players between him and the
ball.
"Cameras are used at horse races,
and they settle all arguments. I
can't see why the same plan could
not be applied tu football."
Well, it could, except that the
camera wouldn't, in hj.lf the cases, be
able to see through the head lines
man and the several players, and
that it would lake diligent, capable
operators to secure usable prints
during the dark days on which
games often are played, and that the
system would cause all kinds of de
lay and arguments before and after
the prints were made, and that the
system would be so expensive as to
be prohibitory to many small schools,
and a few other details that would
have to be ironed out.
But it's a good idea, anyway.
