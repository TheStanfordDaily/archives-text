# Frosh Hoopmen Work on Offense
## 
### 
"We're getting down to brass
tacks nowâ€”no fooling around," was
the way Coach Wytze Gorter sized
up his Class of '40 hoopsters yester
day.
The frosh are practicing solely on
offense this week, concentrating on a
slow break. "Of course," Gorter
said, "(hat is only temporary; we'll
work in a fast break later. Next
week, defense will be the order of
the day, and pretty soon we'll be
practicing five days a week."
Al the present time, the first
string consists of Staehle and Lyons
at forwards, Siebert at center, and
Anderson and Epstein at guards.
