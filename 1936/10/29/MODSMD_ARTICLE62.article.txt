Although the unexpected defeat by
San Jose State last Saturday put
quite a crimp in Stanford's cham
pionship soccer hopes, the Cardinal
hooters are bearing down in prac
tice with the intent of putting forth
their strongest front in the next big
league battle with the University of
San Francisco.
The defeat by the Staters changed
the situation rapidly, but the locals
now have two weeks to think the
matter over. The San Francisco
game will not be until November 7,
but there will be no lapse in drill.
Coach Harry Maloney stated that
he finds little amiss on defense, but
that the attack is erratic and needs
considerable polishing. Final scrim
mage for this week will be held to
night and four practice periods are
set for the following week.
