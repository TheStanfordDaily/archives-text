# Half and Half
## 
### 
I take back half of what I have said about
Palo Alto, for it seems that half of Palo Alto
looks upon what happened a week ago tonight
as the disgrace it was. And half of Palo Alto
is wondering why Stanford isn't going through
with the theater boycott that was threatened.
I am wondering too.
There was a time when the reports were
drifting in to the newspapers when it seemed
that the students were entirely to blame, as if
the freshmen were asking for trouble. But more
and more, as facts are cleared up, it seems that
there were some "young officers who probably
lost their tempers during the melee as any
young persons would do."
I know the nature of a Stanford mob, pa
jama-clad or not, and I know, that even though
younger persons than the officers, they didn't
lose their tempers, if at all, first.
In short, there was provocation for tomato
throwing, and although there is no ethical right
to destroy private property, there are certain
things that can explain the will to destruction.
I quite agree v/ith Comptroller Roth when he
says that students should respect the rights of
private property. We should learn that at Stan
ford. But we should also learn at Stanford that
the ownership of private property entails the
sane use of that property. For those who are
in the business of meeting the public, the Paly
theaters showed a remarkable lack of taste, fore
sight, and civility. For that bungling manage
ment on the part of men who should know
better—two freshmen are spending long hours
at labor on the Paly woodpile, and 15 bucks
for a policeman's pants.
The theater management says that admitting
Pajamarino frosh was an unreasonable thing
because they reported injuries and damages
sustained at previous Pajamarinos. None of the
injuries, as far as it is known, were incurred at
any time except when the theater resisted the
frosh, and at no time has any one ever advanced
ihe effort to organize the freshmen like the
Rallly Committee organizes the students at a
football game.
If the theaters want to resist an old Stanford
folkway, let them resist with their cops, and
marines if necessary. That is within their rights
of private property. It is within the legal right
of the cops to club students who shove and
push them, even if in a carnival spirit.
But it is also within the right of Stanford stu
dents to express strongly that they don't like
such attitudes. Theater managers apparently
don't respect Stanford's consumer interests, as
witnessed by their failure to withstore the 30
cent balcony seats, and their continuation of
that Hollywood lemon: the double-bill.
There is one way to make them respect them,
however, and that is by talking in a language
they understand. Stanford should organize a
boycott and organize it for the week-end trade,
->o that the theater managers can understand it.
A boycott needs pickets, and pickets imply
volunteers. We can rig up the signs easy
enough, if we can get enough caliants to volun
teer for 10 minutes service apiece between the
hours of 7 and 9. The colors are waving, will
you respond?

in the business of meeting the public, the Paly
theaters showed a remarkable lack of taste, fore
sight, and civility. For that bungling manage
ment on the part of men who should know
better—two freshmen are spending long hours
at labor on the Paly woodpile, and 15 bucks
for a policeman's pants.
The theater management says that admitting
Pajamarino frosh was an unreasonable thing
because they reported injuries and damages
sustained at previous Pajamarinos. None of the
injuries, as far as it is known, were incurred at
any time except when the theater resisted the
frosh, and at no time has any one ever advanced
ihe effort to organize the freshmen like the
Rallly Committee organizes the students at a
football game.
If the theaters want to resist an old Stanford
folkway, let them resist with their cops, and
marines if necessary. That is within their rights
of private property. It is within the legal right
of the cops to club students who shove and
push them, even if in a carnival spirit.
But it is also within the right of Stanford stu
dents to express strongly that they don't like
such attitudes. Theater managers apparently
don't respect Stanford's consumer interests, as
witnessed by their failure to withstore the 30
cent balcony seats, and their continuation of
that Hollywood lemon: the double-bill.
There is one way to make them respect them,
however, and that is by talking in a language
they understand. Stanford should organize a
boycott and organize it for the week-end trade,
->o that the theater managers can understand it.
A boycott needs pickets, and pickets imply
volunteers. We can rig up the signs easy
enough, if we can get enough caliants to volun
teer for 10 minutes service apiece between the
hours of 7 and 9. The colors are waving, will
you respond?
I take back half of what I have said about
Palo Alto, for it seems that half of Palo Alto
looks upon what happened a week ago tonight
as the disgrace it was. And half of Palo Alto
is wondering why Stanford isn't going through
with the theater boycott that was threatened.
I am wondering too.
There was a time when the reports were
drifting in to the newspapers when it seemed
that the students were entirely to blame, as if
the freshmen were asking for trouble. But more
and more, as facts are cleared up, it seems that
there were some "young officers who probably
lost their tempers during the melee as any
young persons would do."
I know the nature of a Stanford mob, pa
jama-clad or not, and I know, that even though
younger persons than the officers, they didn't
lose their tempers, if at all, first.
In short, there was provocation for tomato
throwing, and although there is no ethical right
to destroy private property, there are certain
things that can explain the will to destruction.
I quite agree v/ith Comptroller Roth when he
says that students should respect the rights of
private property. We should learn that at Stan
ford. But we should also learn at Stanford that
the ownership of private property entails the
sane use of that property. For those who are
in the business of meeting the public, the Paly
theaters showed a remarkable lack of taste, fore
sight, and civility. For that bungling manage
