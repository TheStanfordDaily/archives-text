# Objectivity Thou Art a jewel

### 
One of those discrepancies in our modern
society which nobody can understand or ex
plain is why The Daily misquotes professors,
and then insults them by turning around and
asking them to subscribe to the organ.
The business department has out a leaflet
monstrosity, inferring that if professors read
The Daily and keep up" on campus doings
and the infinite nonsense of the undergradute
student body, they will be "popular" with the
students. Now, among other things, this shows
a distressing lack of consistent logic for such a
symbol of consistency as tnat requi3ition-bound
staff that underwrites my split infinitives.
Under their theory (and almost any other, too)
The Daily should be sent to the professors free.
Most of the professors don't care if they are
"popular" with the students, but the students
certainly do.
If the students want their professors to be in
formed on the infinite nonsense of the under
graduate student body, and "spice" up their

lectures with "popular" references they ought
to deliver The Daily, the Chaparral, and The
Quad to each professor's door.
But you can't tell business men that.
Now, no one has ever compiled a study show
ing correlation between popularity of professors
and the reading of The Daily, and if it were
shown, they could not prove which was cause
and which was effect.
But there is one thing that everyone, even
professors, can learn from The Daily at one time
or another, and that is how hard it is to trans
mit an attitude developed in an hour lecture to
a half a column of type.
It is only a student newspaper. I suppose, that
would attempt to do that. Still, it has been done.
One of the times that The Daily didn't do it,
though, was in its report of last week's Current
Events Course.
Although we sent one of our best newshawks
out to listen to Professor Fagan's discourse on
the fiscal policies of the New Deal, he didn't
explain in his half column of type, that although
the lecturer s conclusions knocked out more
Republican fallacies than Democratic, that he
was only presenting an analysis of fiscal poli
cies and did not dream of recommending Demo
cratic policies in general over Republicans.
For The Daily's inference on Dr. Fagan's
politics, we are sorry. We, in our childlike,
naive way try to be objective. Not until we
attain a social consciousness akin to The Colum
bia Spectator s can we afford to be subjective—
and throw away such middle-class luxuries as
rationalism and scientific objectivity—in our
news policy. And when we do butch, we don't
have the satisfaction of knowing if it is for a
worthy cause.
So, for the Current Events Course this after
noon, our reporter promises a hyper-objective
attitude bordering on the inarticulate, followed
by a few brief moments of silent prayer.
