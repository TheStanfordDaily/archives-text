FUN—ON THE CAMPUS
What Ex Committee has proposed and the Cardinals
will manage—Stanford's home-made nitery and ro
mancery on the golf course—is the answer to a prayer.
You might have heard it daily from the Adminis
tration Building ever since dad traded in the Steinway
so sonny might ride. For divine guidance was the only
thing left to Stanford. All its power and glory couldn't
mitigate student ability to flow gently to and from
Miller's (pause for a sorrowful side-glance). Nor could
it stop somebody's little boy for flowing too liquidly to
the city on the Bayshore, and getting spilled.
* * * *
The wheels of progress, balloon-tired, had dulled
the lure of the campus dance and the campus func
tion, and made vastly more available piquant city
amusements.
It was not so much that hotel dancing was inher
ently wrong, simply that it was expensive, that it gave
an absolute dating advantage to the well-heeled and
well-motored, and that it undeniably laid students open
to menaces more fatal than iniquitous.
Moreover, San Francisco's factory-made good times
were preventing students from making their own fun—
which is a part of true education.
And to cap things ofT, there was little that could be
done about it, short of building a Chinese wall around
the campus.
# * * *
Then came the obvious solution. Ex Committee
provided it with tjic suggestion that some place be
found on campus with atmosphere right from the stu
dent viewpoint as well as the administration's. (Some
people say Mr. Roth helped things by tearing up the
feeders to Palm Drive so you couldn't get off the cam
pus without at least three broken springs).
# «f* * *
The golf course is it, as many can personally testify.
It's the most beautiful part of the campus, away from
ordinary associations. But most importantly, the golf
course is romantic. On that score alone it wins hands
down over the Women's Clubhouse and the Pavilion.
And that score is important. For up to now, campus
dances have tended to be just a little matter-of-fact,
a little unfestive, or so blatantly gorgeous and expen
sive that the priceless ingerdient was lost.
# # ♦ *
A good phonograph can Rive you Jimmy Dorsey
and all the boys for a good deal less than $900, the
clubhouse gives you the dance-floor, and the great
open spaces give you room for an intcrdance cigarette
without the danger of burning Stanford to the ground.
The possibilities are distinct.

The golf course is it, as many can personally testify.
It's the most beautiful part of the campus, away from
ordinary associations. But most importantly, the golf
course is romantic. On that score alone it wins hands
down over the Women's Clubhouse and the Pavilion.
And that score is important. For up to now, campus
dances have tended to be just a little matter-of-fact,
a little unfestive, or so blatantly gorgeous and expen
sive that the priceless ingerdient was lost.

A good phonograph can Rive you Jimmy Dorsey
and all the boys for a good deal less than $900, the
clubhouse gives you the dance-floor, and the great
open spaces give you room for an intcrdance cigarette
without the danger of burning Stanford to the ground.
The possibilities are distinct.

FUN—ON THE CAMPUS
What Ex Committee has proposed and the Cardinals
will manage—Stanford's home-made nitery and ro
mancery on the golf course—is the answer to a prayer.
You might have heard it daily from the Adminis
tration Building ever since dad traded in the Steinway
so sonny might ride. For divine guidance was the only
thing left to Stanford. All its power and glory couldn't
mitigate student ability to flow gently to and from
Miller's (pause for a sorrowful side-glance). Nor could
it stop somebody's little boy for flowing too liquidly to
the city on the Bayshore, and getting spilled.

The wheels of progress, balloon-tired, had dulled
the lure of the campus dance and the campus func
tion, and made vastly more available piquant city
amusements.
It was not so much that hotel dancing was inher
ently wrong, simply that it was expensive, that it gave
an absolute dating advantage to the well-heeled and
well-motored, and that it undeniably laid students open
to menaces more fatal than iniquitous.
Moreover, San Francisco's factory-made good times
were preventing students from making their own fun—
which is a part of true education.
And to cap things ofT, there was little that could be
done about it, short of building a Chinese wall around
the campus.

Then came the obvious solution. Ex Committee
provided it with tjic suggestion that some place be
found on campus with atmosphere right from the stu
dent viewpoint as well as the administration's. (Some
people say Mr. Roth helped things by tearing up the
feeders to Palm Drive so you couldn't get off the cam
pus without at least three broken springs).
