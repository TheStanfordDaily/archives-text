# OUR HASHER

If there had been some song about "Palo Alto, open
up your Golden Gate," and the freshmen had been
singing it last Thursday night, maybe the Paly cops'
night-clubbing of pajamariners would not have taken
place.
At least the San Francisco cops have a certain
cavalier spirit that Paly's mercenaries do not have.
A group of ardent S.C. students adjourned to a San
Francisco hotel last Saturday night to celebrate the
fruits of victorj' after three years of pretty slow
fasting.
The Troy soldiers gathered themselves into a hotel
room, and proceeded to pour libations and potations.
Early in the evening they wore pretty well down in
their cups, and down on the cops-, fo they amalgamated
some ice cubes, leaned out the windows, and proceeded
to pelt an officer upon the head. The officer did not like
this. He summoned the riot squad. The SC. boys,
amazed at the turn of events, did some fast slowing.
When the riot squad broke down the door, the Troy
men were lined up in a row and singing: "San Fran
cisco, open up your Golden Ga<c, you'll let no stranger
wait, outside your door."
The cops humbly bowed, begged the gentlemen's
pardon, and departed.
It's funny how election changes things. We hear
all these tales about the WPA making a drive for a
"work week," and "lift a shovel week," NYA showing
a sudden repentent interest in cleaning up its baili
wicks. and now, after four long years, the Alpha Delts
receiving a letter from Bro. Franklin. The letter, which
just arrived yesterday, says:
"The President is sorry he is unable to attend your
initiation ceremony October 18."
