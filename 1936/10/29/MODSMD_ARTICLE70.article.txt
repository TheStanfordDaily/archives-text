j The Editor, Sir:
j I have read your editorial entitled
i "Disgraceful Occurrences in Paly,"
I and I am surprised to find out that
j the 16,000 Palo Alto leeches live off
i the 4,000 Stanford students. Less
i than five dollars a month profit is
j received by the Palo Alto leeches
i from each Stanford student. And the
I net sum per month is $20,000.
i Therefore, the Palo Alto leeches
J are living on the dollar and a quar
ter per month of the students of that
; lyccum of learning without equal,
j Stanford. And then every once in a
i while these respectable Stanford
I students come into Palo Alto and
! have a glorious time tossing tomatoes
â€¢ around at passers-by.
Another point is that Palo Alto has
grown, not because of, but in spite
of, the eminent lyceum of learning
that I have already spoken about. It
; had to grow, because it is the most
j logical place for a San Francisco
| suburb.
If you Stanford SNOBS don't like
j Palo Alto, board up that University
Avenue of yours and trade in
Mountain View, if they don't see
, you first.

| The Editor, Sir:
I In yesterday's Campus Opinion
j we read in a letter from Bob Moore
I to the effect President Roosevelt's
I "incredible accent" had upon cinema
j addicts in France.
Mr. Moore said he heard the news
reel of Roosevelt's Quebec speech
! delivered in French. How much of
the speech did he hear? He could
have heard only one or two sen
| tences as the picture company must
j have cut the speech. He could not
| have heard the reception given the

president by the Canadians.
Millions over here heard the entire
speech by radio. Millions heard the
prompt and enthusiastic applause of
the Canadians. There wasn't a single
boo, to say nothing of a guffaw
Strange, is it not, that the Canadians
who heard the entire speech should
have given it such a hearty ac
knowledgment while the Parisiennes
who couldn't have heard more than
two sentences broke out into "sneers
and cat-calls."
Having had three years of French
in high school, Mr. Moore ought to
have been able to perceive that
President Roosevelt's French was
distinctly good.
I doubt the accuracy of his letter.
