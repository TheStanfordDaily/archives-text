TOOTH FOR TOOTH: George and
Arthur MacFarland, saxophonists
for Fred Waring, are identical twins.
During their five years with the

j thur appeared at rehearsal minus his
j left incisor. At last, thought the or-

j grinning from ear to ear. His left
j incisor also had been giving him
i trouble, and he'd just had it pulled.
