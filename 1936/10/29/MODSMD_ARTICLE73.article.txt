# SLEEP TIGHT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Because of my absence from the
scene I was not able to avoid the car
which removed some of the green
paint from my shiny fender yester
day. But if the person whose con
veyance snuggled so cozily against
mine at the east side of the Library
Monday noon spent a sleepless night
because of a troubled conscience, he
may sleep better now.
I'm sure that if he should phone
P.A. 22744 suitable arrangements
could be made.
