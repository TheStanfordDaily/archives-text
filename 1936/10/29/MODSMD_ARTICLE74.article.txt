The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the forlorn
"Woodlake Echo" has been getting
it in the neck long enough from our
"Chappy," hence the enclosure of the
gem below from the October issue of
Chaparral, page 29:
San Mateo: "Director Brauns, with
the true art that conceals art, skill
fully juggled two tables, half a
dozen chairs, a sofa, and 11 people
on the tiny stage to provide an un
forgettable picture of the Hallam
family's weekly gathering, so con
vincing in all its unstudied details
that one forgot acting and technique
in a complete illusion of reality."
We might add, Brobury Ellis, the
malicious comment, "Unforgettable
is right!"
