# SCHOOL SPIRIT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What's the matter with the fa
mous Stanford spirit? For years I've
heard all sorts of marvelous things
about this school, and although this
is my first year here, I'm a Stan
fordite from 'way back.
Since arriving I've read The Daily
avidly, thinking that I'd learn even
more about the school and absorb
quantities of school spirit through
it, especially in Campus Opinion.
What do I find? A lot of people air
ing their pet gripes. And today I
learn that the track team, the frosh
baseball team, and the band are short
of men. Some spirit, I must say.
I hear about traditions and find

few of them carried out. Is there a
boycott on women here or what?
Just try to get a ride to Paly. If there
are traditions, let's carry them out,
all of them. Is the younger genera
tion too blase to throw themselves
wholeheartedly into a plan? Or does
the school need a headline football
team to support? It's the old stu
dents, that aged group of seniors,
who are really loyal, with a few
of the others thrown in.
I suggest a class in school spirit
be organized and a few bouquets
thrown instead of brickbats. Stan
ford really is an exceptional school,
you know, and held in high esteem
from coast to coast.
