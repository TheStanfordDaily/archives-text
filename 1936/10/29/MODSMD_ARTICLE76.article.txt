"DAS BLAU LICHE" at the Varsity
Theater.
A German film that again illus
trates the diversity in aim of British
and American on the one hand, and
foreign productions on the other. The
film gets its title from the mysterious
glow that appears every full moon
over Mount Cristelino, lures stal
wart young men away from the vil
lage to climb to their deaths. Junta,
a half-wild mountain girl, alone
scales the mountain, brings back
strange chunks of crystal to sell the
townsmen.
When a young German artist
comes to stay in the Dolomite vil
lage, he protects "the Witch girl"
from angry villagers, wins her af
fection, eventually scales the moun
tain after her to discover a gem
lined cave, the source of "the blue
light." He overcomes the suspicion
of the villagers, leads them 'to the
cave. But Junta comes before his
return. Horrified that her cave has
been pillaged, she plunges to her
death in the valley below.
It is a grim tale, its grimness in
tensified by the musioal score. In
the tense moments of the peak-scal
ing the massive low notes of a pipe
organ make you strain with the inn
keeper's son on his fatal climb. Or
chestration is so rich that it almost
obviates the necessity of dialogue.
The minor leader tohe of the music
tells of the curse on the village,
forewarns of the tragedy to come.
Action creeps, practically unre
lieved by dialogue, which is inten
tional, for it increases the somber
heaviness of mood. Expressions are
exaggerated, projected as they might
be on the stage. Here, I think, our
cinema actors are more natural.
Careful study is given the grisly old
peasant faces.
Photography is rather blurred, but
the mountain scenery is beautiful,
unusual night photographs of trees,
water, clouds, mountain peaks se
cured.
