# Stanford's Prospects For Initial Victory Improve As New Backfield Clicks
## Backfield Combine Fast; High Score Predicted In Tomorrow's Game 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Betting money is against them. Bill
Spaulding, Bruin. mentor, has con
cocted what he believes to be a
"sure-fire" way of scoring touch
downs against them. The Uclan line
men have been making various pre
dictions as to how hard they will be
driving against them. ,
But all this pre-game burial serv
ice accorded the chances of Stan
ford's winning a conference tilt
seems to be the usual thing this sea
son. And it now finds Tiny Thorn
hill and his 36 stalwart gridiron
warriors deeply moved. Moved to
let out a piercing war cry and defy
anybody to list one good reason why
they won't, be giving the Bruins a
fast and furious battle tomorrow
afternoon in the Coliseum.

The Redskins, now camping at the
Hotel Huntington in Pasadena, will
work out on the battle turf this
afternoon. Tiny will continue to
concentrate on aerial offense but will
in no way neglect defense tactics.
Tomorrow's tussle promises to be
one of free scoring, with final hon
ors being garnered by the squad that
can strike effectively and fast.
Attack Will Count
Attack, be it in the air or not, will
probably count for a great deal more
than anything else and the Cardinals
will be well prepared indeed. The
new backfield combination, includ
ing sharpshooting "Hands" Calvelli
at full and speedy Freddy Williams
at right half, is considered a power
ful weapon.
< Newsmen in the South speak of it
as the fastest and most dangerous
combination Tiny has placed on the
field since last season, and this is not
overestimating things a bit. Injuries
on the team arc few and minor. Pete
Zagar, first-string tackle, is still
bothered by a slightly bruised hipâ€”
an injury he sustained in the Trojan
battle last week. And Joe Clark,
who played a flashy game at end ir.
the same game, is reported to have a
weak ankle. Both Zagar and Clark,
however, are slated to start tomor
row afternoon.
Spaulding's Idea
Down at Westwood, Mentor
Spaulding has thought the situation
over and come to a conclusion. He
has even concocted a scheme which
reads something like this: if the
Westwoodites can make more touch
downs than Stanford and if they col
lect. those touchdowns faster, they
will win.
This is by no means a startling
expose. It's logical and sounds sim
ple, but the Bruins will have no little
trouble putting it into action.
Spaulding knows this, or he wouldn't
be spending so much time running
his squad through scrimmages
against an imitation set of Indians.
Spaulding is making attempts to
get Billy Bob Williams >to toss the
pigskin so that there will be three
backs with passing talent in the
fracas at the same time. Williams
has been trying hard, but so far is
not up to the standard set by any
of the left halfbacks or Fred Funk.
