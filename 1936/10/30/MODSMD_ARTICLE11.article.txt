# Contralto Receives Ovation In Opening Series Concert
## 
### HELEN WARSON 
Encina men, had they stopped to
listen last night, could have heard
Kathryn Meisle singing in the Pa
vilion a half a block away, on the
strong notes, that is. For Miss
Moisle's voice is a developed one, of
operatic dimensions.
If it has not the bell-like quality
of a Pons or a onselle (perhaps the
soprano is naturally more bell-like),
it is a full contralto, its range broad
and uniformly controlled. The Schu
bert song group perhaps best, proved
Miss Meislc's variety, versatility. The
quiet melancholy of the first, "Aug
enthalt," with its pensive piano ac
companiment, contrasted with the
swift gaiety of "Wohin." And I liked
the way Miss Meisle modulated her
higher notes in thir; there was a
tender quality in it, difficult for the
native contralto voice to achieve. The
lusty "Der Erlknnig," always a fa
vorite wilh concert audiences, she
exploited to its full dramatic pos
sibilityâ€”the reassuring tones of the
fitther, with hovernig Death express-

Ed in the middle vocal range.
Miss Meislc's program was a more
popular one, perhaps some would
argue more "catholic" than are
those usually dealt Stanford audi
ences. This Stanford audience seem
ed to appreciate the well-worn "In
the Luxembourg Gardens," the "Ha
banera" from "Carmen," Saint Saen's
'Mon Coeur s'Ouvre a ta Voix" as
well as "The Erlking" and Tschai
kowsky's tearful "None but the
Lonely Heart." Most of the selec
tions, moreover, were in English, and
Miss Meisle is not afflicted with
cloudy diction. I could even under
stand what she was singing about.
Which is exceptional.
But this singer's true metier, I
think, is not the concert stage: it is
the opera. I should prefer to see her
not as the artist beside the piano as
sh was last night, but as the aveng
ing Fricka of "Die Walkure or as
Aida's plotting Amneris. The breadth
of her notes, her personality better
endear her to this medium.
