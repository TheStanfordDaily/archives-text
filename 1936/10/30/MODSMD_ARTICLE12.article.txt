i long years, Stanford students casl
j 61 per cent of their votes for Alfred
, M. Landon in The Daily's presiden-
I tial poll yesterday.

sevelt, 259; Thomas, 22; Browdcr, 13;

Box Stuffed
Election committee declared 200
Communist ballots invalid after a
check-up showed that number of
ballots over number of persons vot
ing. The discrepancy was discov
ered when the committee ran out of
ballots at noon. The 200 Communist
tickets were obviously marked with
the same pen, according to Dave Al
lison, who conducted the poll for
The Daily.
Presidential preference at Stan
ford whs at some variance with other
California colleges. At the Univer
sity of California Landon gained only
a plurality over Roosevelt in a
2000-votc poll, while at U.S.C.
! Franklin led Alf by 61 votes out of
a thousand cast.
Women for Landon
Women students led the Landon
parade in giving the Kansas gover
nor 68 per cent of their vote. They
also showed greater unanimity in
that they gave only seven votes to
minor candidates.
Democrats showed largest numeri
cal gain this year with 34 per cent
against 19 per cent in The Daily's
poll four years ago. Communist
votes jumped 123 per cent from 6 to
13 votes, while Socialists dropped
from 16 per cent to 2 per cent of the
total.
Few Write-ins
Only two write-in candidates, Sta
lin and Trotzky, appeared in yester
day's poll against eight four years
ago. President Wilbur was among
those omitted.
Assisting Allison on the election
committee were: Walt Wicket, Dick
Riddel, Barbara Riley, Margaret
Marshall, Ed Barnctt, and Belly
Brock.
