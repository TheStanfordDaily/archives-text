Nov/ no one is kidding anybody in saying that the Cellar as
she stands, even with toasted marshmallows on the A.S.S.U.

give them any incentive to stay there. So we've got to fight for it.
We ve got to show these dodoes that there is enthusiasm for an
on-campus night club. Unless we have something to show our
benevolent despots, we won't even get the B.A.C.'s very own
Clubhouse. Their attitude has plainly shown that.
Let our attitude plainly show them.
