# Scout Stotsky Helps Cineman Gets into Films
## 
### 
When Universal Pictures
cameraman Stanley Corte*/ got
lost on his way to the right part
of the campus yesterday to take
pictures of candidates for the
movies, he asked Ralph Stotsky
where he was and where he
was going.
Ahout half-way through the
afternoon a telegraph boy
tramped up to Corte/ and
handed him a wire between
shots. Everything paused while
the telegram was read.
The content, it came out, was
a judicious request by Stotsky
to have his picture taken along
with the other fellows.
So, when he responded to
Cortez' return wire saying sim
ply, "Yes," Director Simon had
Stotsky's picture taken, and
now he's in the movies, too.
