"We believe lhat. when returns
from all the ticket chairmen have
been taken, we will have totaled
more than $1000 at, the Chrysanthe
mum Tea," said Mrs. Wilson, Moth
ers' Club president, yesterday.
Mrs. Wilson estimated that, the
(lower booths took in $175, and those
selling gourds and autumn decora
tions $80. Besides this, the bridge
tables, an innovation this year,
brought in $1.25 apiece.
While this year's tea was about
equal to others as far as receipts go,
Mrs. Wilson said that she considered
it had been made outstandingly en
tertaining by the varied student pro
gram.
Funds from the Chrysanthemum
Tea go into the Mothers' Club gen
eral fund, and are then allotted for
Student Welfare or Scholarship,
each of which receives around $1000
a year.
The Rest Homes, which are an ex
pence of $2700 a year, are financed
by the Mothers' Club Spring Fete.
