# Universal Pictures Select Hewitt, Davison, Campbell As Standouts in Movie Tests
## Hollywood Cameramen Leave Campus After Filming 17 Cardinals 
### WALT PETERSON 
Universal Pictures Corporation in
the persons of Sylvan Simon, test
director, Stanley Cortez, head cam
eraman, and Mike WaLsh, super-as
sistant cameraman, stalked onto the
campus yesterday afternoon, strode
through a mess of interviews and
photography with a corresponding
amount of Stanford Teutonics, and
swirled off the campus again with
900 feet of film showing how 17
Indians look in front of a movie
camera.
Searching for five young men to
take leading roles in "The Road
Back," sequel to the war epic "All
Quiet on the Western Front" of a
few years ago, Director Simon found
three standouts at the tryouts by
the north Quad arch among the band
of 17, John Hewitt, Seymour Davi
son, and George Campbell. All of
the choices have definite prospects,
with the cold dope on just who will
be who, if any, resting with the judg
ment of Director James Whale in
Hollywood.
Simon Likes Hewitt
Hewitt, a sophomore, caught the
eye of Simon as particularly fitted
to the role of Albert, one of the five
war-wracked German soldier boys
left before a yawning gap in life
with the sudden close of the war.
Tall, square-jawed, and light-com
plectioned, Hewitt was the apple of
Universal's eye.
Davison struck the director's
fancy as fitted to the part of Eric,
a rather quiet, thoughtful youth. He
is a senior, registered from Belmont.
Short, stocky, with a square jaw
and a good Deutscher mien describes
Campbell, Kalama, Washington,
sophomore who was the first in the
group to draw special expressions of
praise from Simon and his crew.
Brookmau Filmed
Late in the day Dorothy Brookman
was procured by Dramatics Director
Gordon Lange, and it wasn't long
before Cortez & Walsh, picture-box
handlers, inc., had quite a strip of
film with nobody on it but her. The
blond, tennis-playing gal was okay
with everybody, even if the tryouts
were being held to find five men.
Others of the 17 neo-Taylors were
Bob Forward, Clinton Olson, Doug
Watson, Winton Close, Joe Lawry,
Julius Hooven, James Corner, Wil
liam Kalb, Kenneth Ray, Louis Cass,
Ralph Stotsky, Bowmar Rodgers,
Guy Bowcock, and Dave Ryus.

eye of Simon as particularly fitted
to the role of Albert, one of the five
war-wracked German soldier boys
left before a yawning gap in life
with the sudden close of the war.
Tall, square-jawed, and light-com
plectioned, Hewitt was the apple of
Universal's eye.
Davison struck the director's
fancy as fitted to the part of Eric,
a rather quiet, thoughtful youth. He
is a senior, registered from Belmont.
Short, stocky, with a square jaw
and a good Deutscher mien describes
Campbell, Kalama, Washington,
sophomore who was the first in the
group to draw special expressions of
praise from Simon and his crew.
Brookmau Filmed
Late in the day Dorothy Brookman
was procured by Dramatics Director
Gordon Lange, and it wasn't long
before Cortez & Walsh, picture-box
handlers, inc., had quite a strip of
film with nobody on it but her. The
blond, tennis-playing gal was okay
with everybody, even if the tryouts
were being held to find five men.
Others of the 17 neo-Taylors were
Bob Forward, Clinton Olson, Doug
Watson, Winton Close, Joe Lawry,
Julius Hooven, James Corner, Wil
liam Kalb, Kenneth Ray, Louis Cass,
Ralph Stotsky, Bowmar Rodgers,
Guy Bowcock, and Dave Ryus.
Universal Pictures Corporation in
the persons of Sylvan Simon, test
director, Stanley Cortez, head cam
eraman, and Mike WaLsh, super-as
sistant cameraman, stalked onto the
campus yesterday afternoon, strode
through a mess of interviews and
photography with a corresponding
amount of Stanford Teutonics, and
swirled off the campus again with
900 feet of film showing how 17
Indians look in front of a movie
camera.
Searching for five young men to
take leading roles in "The Road
Back," sequel to the war epic "All
Quiet on the Western Front" of a
few years ago, Director Simon found
three standouts at the tryouts by
the north Quad arch among the band
of 17, John Hewitt, Seymour Davi
son, and George Campbell. All of
the choices have definite prospects,
with the cold dope on just who will
be who, if any, resting with the judg
ment of Director James Whale in
Hollywood.
