Heavy rains were falling in
Southern California last night,
with good indication that there
might he wet weather at game
time Saturday.
Tiny Thornhill said last night
before leaving that rain would
put the team at some disadvan
tage; although Calvelli can
throw a wet ball, the receivers
would have difficulties.
