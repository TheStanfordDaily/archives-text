# Union Scene of Nitery Dance Tomorrow As B.A.C Dings Golf Links Evening Spot
## Hallowe'en Motif, Moon Inspire Cellar Affair 
### DAVE LEFF 
Despite B.A.C. canceling of golf
course nitery plans, Stanford will
hold a Hallowe'en dance tomorrow in
the Union Cellar and adjoining
A.S.S.U. lobby.
Permission for the use of the links
dance spot was refused by Miss
Eunice DuPrau because A1 Masters,
B.A.C. general manager, having gone
south, was unavailable.
Festive Start
Corn stalks, a roaring fire, fountain
service, S.A.E. and Kappa house rec
ords, and a moon on Union Court,
with the fountain playing under col
ored lights, will combine to give
Stanford's newly conceived on-cam
pus dance spot a festive start and a
Hallowe'en motif.
If sufficient interest is displayed,
if students drop in for a foxtrot the
way they do for a coke, there are
prospects of a permanent nite club
being erected with canned music
playing far far into every night.
Marshinallow Roast
Furthered by Cardinals, with ar
rangements in the hands of Betty
Grover, Ruth Goodan, and Jeeb
Halaby, Saturday's affair proposes
to start the dance series with marsh
mallow roasting at the A.S.S.U. fire
place, dancing on two levels of the
Union Cellar — whose tables and
chairs will be removed—and rendez
vous in Union Court under a full
round yellow Hallowe'en moon.
Festivities commence at 8:00 and
arrangements have been made to
keep the Cellar and lobby open un
til midnight. Union Court, Inner
Quad, and Lagunita bank will not
close, however.
Golf Club Denied
Miss DuPrau at first denied use
of the golf course clubhouse, origi
nally scheduled for the nitery, on
the grounds that golfers frequented
the place until past nine, that thei'e
would be no one to clean it up, and
that no soda jerkers would be avail
able. It was later learned, however,
that Masters, before leaving, had
tentatively withheld approval of
Cardinal plans for holding an in
formal radio-phonograph dance at
the golf course building.
It is expected, if trade is brisk
enough at the Union tomorrow eve
ning to warrant continuance of the
idea, that permission will be ob
tained for the future use of the
golf course with its added scenic ad
vantages.
Sufficient enthusiasm may encour
age execution in the future of
Comptroller Roth's suggestion to
build a Union annex to furnish mu
sic every night. Such an establish
ment would probably resemble a
nite club with occasional dinner
dances and free hoofing all times
after dark.
