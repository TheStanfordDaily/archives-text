MADRID, Oct. 29 (UP).—Loyalist
forces, gradually driven back to the
gates of Madrid by rebel troops in
recent weks, lashed out today with
a vigorous counter-offensive and
scored what were declared here to
be major gains directly south of
Madrid.
The government said loyalists had
recaptured Scsena, Torrejon do
Velasco, Torrejon de la Calzada, and
"other towns."
