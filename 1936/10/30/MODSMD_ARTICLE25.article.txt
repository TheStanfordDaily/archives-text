Hade with sandwich signs reading
o 1 one side: Stanford and Varsity
' leaters are unfair to Stanford stu
<i >nts, and on the other: "Police
( lit f Zink is a Zink."
Now all that goes on the assump
( 11 that Stanford students are or
: nixed and of one mind. But you
v >, Mug, even though they may be
0 one mind on female virtue and
v versa, they are not exactly what
y< i would call organized.
