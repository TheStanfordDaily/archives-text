# Gaieties Judges Approve Acts
## Acts Not Yet Assigned Scheduled For Today 
### 
After yesterday's general tryouts,
plans for the Gaieties are progressing
rapidly, according to Phil Brown,
director. The judging committee was
greatly pleased by the number and
spirit of the tryoutees who appeared.
Singers, piano players and all mu
sical acts were chosen for the show,
but will not be announced until a
later date.
At today's tryouts all individual
skits and acts as well as casting for
skits will be heard. Of those who
tried out yesterday, all who are not
definitely in an act are requested to
come back today between 1 and 4:30
in the Little Theater.
Girls who signed up for the chorus,
and all others who tried for some
thing definite, will be notified when
and where to appear for rehearsals.
Today's tryouts wind up the pe
riod, leaving nothing but written
tunes still open to competition.
