# Frank J. Miller Acquitted On Liquor Charge
## Accused of Selling Minors Intoxicating Beverages; Must Face Paly Court 
### 
' Not sufficient evidence for con
viction."
Such was the opinion of Deputy
District Attorney Chesley Douglas,
and now Frank J. Miller stands ac
quitted of tine charge of selling in
toxicating liquor to minors.
But Miller, however, does not
stand completely free in the eyes of
the court, for he must answer next
Wednesday again in Palo Alto to a
simiicr allegation. He and his bar
tender, Robert Lowe, will appear
belore Justice of the Peace Edward
E. Hardy, who presided in the first
hearing.
Lengthy Session
It was only after a lengthy session
that Prosecutor Douglas finally rec
ommended that a defense motion for
a directed verdict of acquittal be
granted. The jury granted this re
quest without objection. Douglas
later explained that the evidence he
was depending upon turned out to
be not so strong as he had first an
ticipated, and to his mind a verdict
of guilty would not be upheld in the
appellate court even if he were able
to obtain it.
In no uncertain terms, though, he
intimated that there is stronger evi
dence to be used in the second case
next week. The formal charge
against Miller is that he did "sell,
furnish, give, and cause to be sold
an alcoholic beverage containing
more than one and one-half per cent
alcohol by volume, namely a 'Tom
Collins' to two minors."
'Tom Collins'
The arrest was made on the night
of September 19 by Rex Fuller and
Hugh A. Boyle, liquor agents.
Brought to light in the testimony
were indications that an adult pur
chased two "Tom Collins" for a 20-
year-old youth.. The youth then as
sertedly took the drinks into an
other room and gave one of them
to a girl companion.
When Fuller and Boyle accosted
the pair, they both confessed they
were less than 21 years of age and
the youth admitted giving the waiter
false representation of his age. Max
Root, bartender, went on to explain
what a "Tom Collins" contained, and
it was judged an intoxicant.
Instructions Clear
Miller and his employees repeated
ibat there were instructions not to
serve minors with intoxicants, and
if there was any doubt, to insist
upon proof of age. After Defense
Attorney K. R. McDougall had ar
gued that it had not been shown
that an intoxicating beverage was
sold to a minor, that an adult pur
chased the drink, he moved for dis
missal.
The prosecutor concurred later in
this motion, and the jury brought
into the courtroom a formal verdict
of not guilty.
