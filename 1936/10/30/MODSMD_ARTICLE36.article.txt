# History Gives Indians Edge Over Bruins
## Past Favors Stanford; Large Scores Mark Early Card Wins 
### DAVE SWANBERG 
The Stanford-U.C.L.A. game to
morrow will be a vastly different
affair from the first game between
the two schools eleven years ago.
The two teams first met at Stan
ford in 1925. U.C.L.A., then known
as "Southern Branch," proved no
opposition for the Kedshirts, led
by Ernie Nevers, the score being
82-0.
The teams didn't meet again until
1928, U.C.L.A.'s first year in the
conference. The Indian "welcoming
committee" wasn't very gracious to
the newest blessed event of the
coast conference, sending the Baby
Bears back to L.A. with a smarting
45-7 defeat.
The following year the Bruins
again invaded the North, and Ihey
were again promptly scalped 57-0.
In 1930, Stanford journeyed
south and played their only night
game in history at the Coliseum.
The southern Bear was meanwhile
growing up. The score had shrunk
to 20-0.
In the 1931 game Stanford had to
call on Lady Luck to win. With the
score tied at G all and one minute
to play, Dusty Allen uncorked a
long prayer heave which Don Colvin
captured and dashed across the goal
to give the Cards the game, 12-6.
The Bruins won their first vic
tory from Stanford in 1932. After
spotting Stanford a touchdown,
they came back to tie the score
and then block a Stanford punt
to put themselves in front, 13-6.
A field goal by Stanford's Bill Cor
bus was the difference between vic
tory and defeat in 1933, 3-0 being
the count.
In the 1934 encounter, the Big Red
Machine with its Hamiltons, Mos
crips, Reynolds, and Graysons
reached its peak and literally shoved
the hapless Bruins out of the Coli
seum to the tune of 27-0.
Last year the same Red Machine
took little note of the insignificant
Bruins. But after 60 minutes of
hectic football, the lowly Bruins
came out on the long end of a 7-0
score. Stanford had nearly 3 times
as much yardage, but yardage
alone doesn't win games. The In
dians drew first blood after five
minutes of play when Alustiza
ran an intercepted pass back to
the Bruin 20. It then took Gray
son two plays to score. Moscrip's
conversion failed.
In the same period, Hamilton
fumbled, and U.C.L.A. recovered on
Stanford's 40. Chuck Cheshire ad
vanced it to the 8. Ted Key went
over the goal on his second try and
then converted for the winning mar
gin.

1928, U.C.L.A.'s first year in the
conference. The Indian "welcoming
committee" wasn't very gracious to
the newest blessed event of the
coast conference, sending the Baby
Bears back to L.A. with a smarting
45-7 defeat.
The following year the Bruins
again invaded the North, and Ihey
were again promptly scalped 57-0.
In 1930, Stanford journeyed
south and played their only night
game in history at the Coliseum.
The southern Bear was meanwhile
growing up. The score had shrunk
to 20-0.
In the 1931 game Stanford had to
call on Lady Luck to win. With the
score tied at G all and one minute
to play, Dusty Allen uncorked a
long prayer heave which Don Colvin
captured and dashed across the goal
to give the Cards the game, 12-6.
The Bruins won their first vic
tory from Stanford in 1932. After
spotting Stanford a touchdown,
they came back to tie the score
and then block a Stanford punt
to put themselves in front, 13-6.
A field goal by Stanford's Bill Cor
bus was the difference between vic
tory and defeat in 1933, 3-0 being
the count.
In the 1934 encounter, the Big Red
Machine with its Hamiltons, Mos
crips, Reynolds, and Graysons
reached its peak and literally shoved
the hapless Bruins out of the Coli
seum to the tune of 27-0.
Last year the same Red Machine
took little note of the insignificant
Bruins. But after 60 minutes of
hectic football, the lowly Bruins
came out on the long end of a 7-0
score. Stanford had nearly 3 times
as much yardage, but yardage
alone doesn't win games. The In
dians drew first blood after five
minutes of play when Alustiza
ran an intercepted pass back to
the Bruin 20. It then took Gray
son two plays to score. Moscrip's
conversion failed.
In the same period, Hamilton
fumbled, and U.C.L.A. recovered on
Stanford's 40. Chuck Cheshire ad
vanced it to the 8. Ted Key went
over the goal on his second try and
then converted for the winning mar
gin.
The Stanford-U.C.L.A. game to
morrow will be a vastly different
affair from the first game between
the two schools eleven years ago.
The two teams first met at Stan
ford in 1925. U.C.L.A., then known
as "Southern Branch," proved no
opposition for the Kedshirts, led
by Ernie Nevers, the score being
82-0.
