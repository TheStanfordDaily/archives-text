# CAMPUS OPINION
## WORTH WRITING 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
At last the Daily publishes an ar
gument for Roosevelt which is worth
replying to. Stephen Enke makes the
statement in one Monday Tabby that
Republican warnings regarding
Roosevelt's financial policies are un
founded. The reason he gives is the
amazing pick-up which business has
encountered during the present ad
ministration. The inference is that
Roosevelt has been responsible for
the improvement.
This inference strikes me as highly
dubious. Charles W. Davis, demo
cratic candidate for president in 1924,
ambassador to England, and member
of Congress, who spoke on behalf of
the Jeffersonian democrats last
Tuesday night, declares such a con
clusion to be altogether illogical. He
gives two reasons:
1. Business runs in cycles which
are independent of the party in
power.
2. Our present national financial
standing is just about as sound as
having a delicious picnic on top of
an ant hill.
What with business admittedly
temporarily improved, there will be
a desire for loans from banks on the
part of corporations anxious to ex
pand and to add improvements. Now
the banks at present are in as bad
a position for making loans as ever
they have been, for Roosevelt's un
distributed profits tax has caused
them to get rid of their surplus, and
his forcing them to buy federal bonds
in order to obtain money for relief
has taken whatever other reserves
they have had. As for the federal
bonds themselves being good well,
Roosevelt has left payment on them
up to a future administration. Cer
tainly there is no money available
to call them now. Even the money
which has come in on R.F.C. loans

and Farm Mortgage loans, both of
which were made in the time of the
"do nothing" Hoover regime, has
been dispensed on relief.
I agree with Mr. Enke that "there
are few business men who don't
prefer 1936 under Roosevelt to 1932
under Hoover"; but considering such
men as Newton D. Baker, Charles
Davis, A1 Smith, Walter Lippman, all
sound business men who voted for
Roosevelt in 1932 and are now sup
porting Landon; considering the
great number of newspaper editors
who have gone over to Landon —
even the New York Times, a pillar
of the Democratic party, is in the
process of shifting; considering the
views of any sound and practical as
opposed to theoretical economist —
taking all these into account, I say
that were it possible, there would be
even fewer men who would not pre- i
fer Hoover in 1936 to Roosevelt in
1932, in short, that the President's
ruthless spending of money and his i
slip-shod methods of reconstruction ;
have resulted in his complete dis- |
credit in the eyes of any clcar
thinking American.
