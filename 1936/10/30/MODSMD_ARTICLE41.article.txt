# Current Events Class Told Labor Will Support Roosevelt
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Eighty to 90 per cent of American i
labor will suppoi*t the re-election of
President Roosevelt at the polls next
Tuesday, John T. Dunlop, acting in
structor in economics, told the fourth j
meeting of the Current Events class
yesterday.
The American Federation of Labor
and John L. Lewis' "Non-Pax*tisan
League" consider Roosevelt their
"friend" because of past action and
future promise to labor. Landon they
reject, Dunlop said, because of his
probable siding with company un
ionism and because of his backers
—the Big Boys of Business.
Security Big Point
A main point in Roosevelt's favor
was the Now Deal's Social Security
Act, according to the instructor. "The
President's system of unemployment
and old-age insurance for workers is
not a burden on the workers. It is
fair from every standpoint," he said.
Dunlop condemned reports that
the Social Security Act was unfair
to workers as "plain garden-variety
lies, the lowest and dirtiest form of
partisan politics."
After his speech he told The Daily
that though Ihe re-election of Roose
velt would doubtless benefit labor he
left open to question the benefit to
the country as a whole.
F.R. for Labor
"The President has taken positive
stops to improve labor's postion. He
has taken steps to provide for a na
tional labor exchange, which would
permit the systematic shift of work
ers from one territory or industry to
another as the need arose," the lec
turer explained.
Curbing the use of the injunction
as a weapon against strikes, attempts
to stabilize the coal industry, at
tempts to arbitrate labor disputes,
relief to the unemployed, stimulation
to labor membership through NRA —
all these points Dunlop listed as
strengthening labor's "friendship"

fox* Roosevelt.
Principal labor "gripe" against
Landon was his Big Business back
ers — the Du Ponts, Rockefeller,
Morgan — Dunlop explained, is
involved with U.S. Steel, which is
one of organized labor's bitterest en
emies.
Landon Not So Hot
If Landon were elected any effec
tive enforcement of labor wage laws
and of collective bargaining would
probably be undermined, Dunlop
prophesied—though he qualified his
statement by saying that he was
"only prophesying." "Employers
would consider the Kansan's elec
tion a moral victox*y and would be
inclined to clamp down on labor
ers," he declared.
Professor H. H. Fisher will speak
next week on the "Russian Consti
tution."

F.R. for Labor
"The President has taken positive
stops to improve labor's postion. He
has taken steps to provide for a na
tional labor exchange, which would
permit the systematic shift of work
ers from one territory or industry to
another as the need arose," the lec
turer explained.
Curbing the use of the injunction
as a weapon against strikes, attempts
to stabilize the coal industry, at
tempts to arbitrate labor disputes,
relief to the unemployed, stimulation
to labor membership through NRA —
all these points Dunlop listed as
strengthening labor's "friendship"

fox* Roosevelt.
Principal labor "gripe" against
Landon was his Big Business back
ers — the Du Ponts, Rockefeller,
Morgan — Dunlop explained, is
involved with U.S. Steel, which is
one of organized labor's bitterest en
emies.
Landon Not So Hot
If Landon were elected any effec
tive enforcement of labor wage laws
and of collective bargaining would
probably be undermined, Dunlop
prophesied—though he qualified his
statement by saying that he was
"only prophesying." "Employers
would consider the Kansan's elec
tion a moral victox*y and would be
inclined to clamp down on labor
ers," he declared.
Professor H. H. Fisher will speak
next week on the "Russian Consti
tution."
Eighty to 90 per cent of American i
labor will suppoi*t the re-election of
President Roosevelt at the polls next
Tuesday, John T. Dunlop, acting in
structor in economics, told the fourth j
meeting of the Current Events class
yesterday.
The American Federation of Labor
and John L. Lewis' "Non-Pax*tisan
League" consider Roosevelt their
"friend" because of past action and
future promise to labor. Landon they
reject, Dunlop said, because of his
probable siding with company un
ionism and because of his backers
—the Big Boys of Business.
Security Big Point
A main point in Roosevelt's favor
was the Now Deal's Social Security
Act, according to the instructor. "The
President's system of unemployment
and old-age insurance for workers is
not a burden on the workers. It is
fair from every standpoint," he said.
Dunlop condemned reports that
the Social Security Act was unfair
to workers as "plain garden-variety
lies, the lowest and dirtiest form of
partisan politics."
After his speech he told The Daily
that though Ihe re-election of Roose
velt would doubtless benefit labor he
left open to question the benefit to
the country as a whole.
