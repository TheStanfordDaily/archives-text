FOLKS, MEET THE f
PUBLICITY MEN
An interesting sideline to this pro- j
fession is the mail you get. It is
composed almost entirely of athletic
"releases" or mimeographed sheets
sent out by the publicity directors of
various colleges here and around.
That's Liebendorfer's job around
Stanford —he sends out a couple of
mimeographed sheets each week to
papers all over the country, telling
how to spell Tsoutsouvas and how
much Chet Olcott weighs.
The sheets are always written out |
news story style, or in tabular form,
ready to insert in column 3. But
each sport editor who receives one
has to cut it way down and change
it around so that his line won't be the
same as that appearing in the Star-
Press across the street.
We never see Liebendorfer's, but
we see plenty of others. Walter
Frederick at California sends one
nearly every day, giving full condi-'
tion and line-up dope on all three
California teams varsity, freshmen,
and Ramblers.
A1 Wesson of U.S.C. is on the list
for one a week; his is a short one j
giving only the latest dope on in
juries and possible changes in line
ups.
Roy Rosenthal comes through
every now and then with some in
teresting stuff on what the Huskies
are doing in the far north, interest
ing because it is information we
never hear down this far south.
Bruce Hamby of the University of
Oregon puts his release in a yellow
envelope with fancy doings on the
outside, with line of the week dope
on Captain Bjork and the rest of his
guys.
We also get 'em pretty complete
from Fresno State and College of the
Pacific, and a kid named Andy Davis
got out some beauts on Black Foxe
shortly before they played the Frosh
up here.
Payoff is the Washington State
press release. It takes about four
days to get here from the Inland
Empire frontier, an 3 when it ar
rives, is invariably about the number
of gals who registered for folk danc
ing this year, or an experiment being
conducted by the Agricultural
School on a new species of apple.
The Bruins have them all beat.
Ben Person, dope monger from the
Westwood school, sends us long,
useful tabulations on his men, where
they are from and why, last year's
schedule, dope on the coaching staff,
eligibility facts, and so on far into
the night.
Worse yet, he gives a long bio
graphic sketch on the traveling
U.C.L.A. teams—favorite football and
movie heroes, and what Barber,
Schroeder, et al. like best to eat!
REWARD EM?
VESSIR. BUT BE CALM
The local news organs (Stanford
Daily, Illustrated Review, Paly
Times, etc.) throughout the season
have been praising the Thornhill !
machine as good, great, developing,
coming, improving, spirited, to keep
their "daubers" up, and our "daub
ers" up, and for want of something
better to do.
Let it here be advised, though, to
ease off gradually. It is very possible
that the players will read some of
this "greatest fight ever" and "al
ready vindicated themselves" stuff,
and believe it. It is inherently bad
to believe anything you see in a
sports column, but any of you can
see the dangers of too much of that
particular kind of propaganda.
Dink Templeton went especially
hog wild in the last alumni Football
Weekly covering the U.S.C. game
(I saw a couple of first stringers
reading it, too) on the angle of "sixty
minutes of STANFORD FIGHT,"
and "won far more than any one
game could possibly mean."
This is not a slam at Dink. He is
one of the most intelligent, and in
teresting waiters I have ever read or
known, but everybody knows that he
is innoculated with over-enthusiasm
—about 99 out of 100 times he is the
greatest optimist (or pessimist) in
the state of California.
I certainly hope that through the
Daily's writings or Dink's or any
body else's, the Big Red Machine
doesn't get the idea that it is already
tops and set up for the rest of the
season. Or that a good third quarter
push is as soothing as a win.
Last year's team was a champion
ship outfit, but due to the fact that
everybody was satisfied with win
ning and not much else, they played
just about 45 minutes of champion
ship ball during the entire season.
The same thing could work here;

there is not so much of a reputation
to lure them on, and with a good
write-up on that "third-quarter
push," they might, after a few more
tough ones, begin to think about
nothing else.
No, boys. We like the way you've
improved, and you know that, but
we also wanta win some games, and
you know that. Remember it; this
is a hard week to start, but a good
week.
All aboooooart!

A1 Wesson of U.S.C. is on the list
for one a week; his is a short one j
giving only the latest dope on in
juries and possible changes in line
ups.
Roy Rosenthal comes through
every now and then with some in
teresting stuff on what the Huskies
are doing in the far north, interest
ing because it is information we
never hear down this far south.
Bruce Hamby of the University of
Oregon puts his release in a yellow
envelope with fancy doings on the
outside, with line of the week dope
on Captain Bjork and the rest of his
guys.
We also get 'em pretty complete
from Fresno State and College of the
Pacific, and a kid named Andy Davis
got out some beauts on Black Foxe
shortly before they played the Frosh
up here.
Payoff is the Washington State
press release. It takes about four
days to get here from the Inland
Empire frontier, an 3 when it ar
rives, is invariably about the number
of gals who registered for folk danc
ing this year, or an experiment being
conducted by the Agricultural
School on a new species of apple.
The Bruins have them all beat.
Ben Person, dope monger from the
Westwood school, sends us long,
useful tabulations on his men, where
they are from and why, last year's
schedule, dope on the coaching staff,
eligibility facts, and so on far into
the night.
Worse yet, he gives a long bio
graphic sketch on the traveling
U.C.L.A. teams—favorite football and

REWARD EM?
VESSIR. BUT BE CALM
The local news organs (Stanford
Daily, Illustrated Review, Paly
Times, etc.) throughout the season
have been praising the Thornhill !
machine as good, great, developing,
coming, improving, spirited, to keep
their "daubers" up, and our "daub
ers" up, and for want of something
better to do.
Let it here be advised, though, to
ease off gradually. It is very possible
that the players will read some of
this "greatest fight ever" and "al
ready vindicated themselves" stuff,
and believe it. It is inherently bad
to believe anything you see in a
sports column, but any of you can
see the dangers of too much of that
particular kind of propaganda.
Dink Templeton went especially
hog wild in the last alumni Football
Weekly covering the U.S.C. game
(I saw a couple of first stringers
reading it, too) on the angle of "sixty
minutes of STANFORD FIGHT,"
and "won far more than any one
game could possibly mean."
This is not a slam at Dink. He is
one of the most intelligent, and in
teresting waiters I have ever read or
known, but everybody knows that he
is innoculated with over-enthusiasm
—about 99 out of 100 times he is the
greatest optimist (or pessimist) in
the state of California.
I certainly hope that through the
Daily's writings or Dink's or any
body else's, the Big Red Machine
doesn't get the idea that it is already
tops and set up for the rest of the
season. Or that a good third quarter
push is as soothing as a win.
Last year's team was a champion
ship outfit, but due to the fact that
everybody was satisfied with win
ning and not much else, they played
just about 45 minutes of champion
ship ball during the entire season.
The same thing could work here;

there is not so much of a reputation
to lure them on, and with a good
write-up on that "third-quarter
push," they might, after a few more
tough ones, begin to think about
nothing else.
No, boys. We like the way you've
improved, and you know that, but
we also wanta win some games, and
you know that. Remember it; this
is a hard week to start, but a good
week.
All aboooooart!

FOLKS, MEET THE f
PUBLICITY MEN
An interesting sideline to this pro- j
fession is the mail you get. It is
composed almost entirely of athletic
"releases" or mimeographed sheets
sent out by the publicity directors of
various colleges here and around.
That's Liebendorfer's job around
Stanford —he sends out a couple of
mimeographed sheets each week to
papers all over the country, telling
how to spell Tsoutsouvas and how
much Chet Olcott weighs.
The sheets are always written out |
news story style, or in tabular form,
ready to insert in column 3. But
each sport editor who receives one
has to cut it way down and change
it around so that his line won't be the
same as that appearing in the Star-
Press across the street.
We never see Liebendorfer's, but
we see plenty of others. Walter
Frederick at California sends one
nearly every day, giving full condi-'
tion and line-up dope on all three
California teams varsity, freshmen,
and Ramblers.

School on a new species of apple.
The Bruins have them all beat.
Ben Person, dope monger from the
Westwood school, sends us long,
useful tabulations on his men, where
they are from and why, last year's
schedule, dope on the coaching staff,
eligibility facts, and so on far into
the night.
Worse yet, he gives a long bio

REWARD EM?
VESSIR. BUT BE CALM
The local news organs (Stanford
Daily, Illustrated Review, Paly
Times, etc.) throughout the season
have been praising the Thornhill !
machine as good, great, developing,
coming, improving, spirited, to keep
their "daubers" up, and our "daub
ers" up, and for want of something
better to do.
Let it here be advised, though, to
ease off gradually. It is very possible
that the players will read some of
this "greatest fight ever" and "al
ready vindicated themselves" stuff,
and believe it. It is inherently bad
to believe anything you see in a
sports column, but any of you can
see the dangers of too much of that
particular kind of propaganda.
Dink Templeton went especially
hog wild in the last alumni Football
Weekly covering the U.S.C. game
(I saw a couple of first stringers
reading it, too) on the angle of "sixty
minutes of STANFORD FIGHT,"
and "won far more than any one
game could possibly mean."
This is not a slam at Dink. He is
one of the most intelligent, and in
teresting waiters I have ever read or
known, but everybody knows that he
is innoculated with over-enthusiasm
—about 99 out of 100 times he is the
greatest optimist (or pessimist) in
the state of California.
I certainly hope that through the
Daily's writings or Dink's or any
body else's, the Big Red Machine
doesn't get the idea that it is already
tops and set up for the rest of the
season. Or that a good third quarter
push is as soothing as a win.
Last year's team was a champion
ship outfit, but due to the fact that
everybody was satisfied with win
ning and not much else, they played
just about 45 minutes of champion
ship ball during the entire season.
The same thing could work here;

there is not so much of a reputation
to lure them on, and with a good
write-up on that "third-quarter
push," they might, after a few more
tough ones, begin to think about
nothing else.
No, boys. We like the way you've
improved, and you know that, but
we also wanta win some games, and
you know that. Remember it; this
is a hard week to start, but a good
week.
All aboooooart!

FOLKS, MEET THE f
PUBLICITY MEN
An interesting sideline to this pro- j
fession is the mail you get. It is
composed almost entirely of athletic
"releases" or mimeographed sheets
sent out by the publicity directors of
various colleges here and around.
That's Liebendorfer's job around
Stanford —he sends out a couple of
mimeographed sheets each week to
papers all over the country, telling
how to spell Tsoutsouvas and how
much Chet Olcott weighs.
The sheets are always written out |
news story style, or in tabular form,
ready to insert in column 3. But
each sport editor who receives one
has to cut it way down and change
it around so that his line won't be the
same as that appearing in the Star-
Press across the street.
We never see Liebendorfer's, but
we see plenty of others. Walter
Frederick at California sends one
nearly every day, giving full condi-'
tion and line-up dope on all three
California teams varsity, freshmen,
and Ramblers.
A1 Wesson of U.S.C. is on the list
for one a week; his is a short one j
giving only the latest dope on in
juries and possible changes in line
ups.
Roy Rosenthal comes through
every now and then with some in
teresting stuff on what the Huskies
are doing in the far north, interest
ing because it is information we
never hear down this far south.
Bruce Hamby of the University of
Oregon puts his release in a yellow
envelope with fancy doings on the
outside, with line of the week dope
on Captain Bjork and the rest of his
guys.
We also get 'em pretty complete
from Fresno State and College of the
Pacific, and a kid named Andy Davis
got out some beauts on Black Foxe
shortly before they played the Frosh
up here.
Payoff is the Washington State
press release. It takes about four
days to get here from the Inland
Empire frontier, an 3 when it ar
rives, is invariably about the number
of gals who registered for folk danc
ing this year, or an experiment being
conducted by the Agricultural
School on a new species of apple.
