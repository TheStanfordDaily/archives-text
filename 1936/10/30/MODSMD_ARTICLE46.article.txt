# San Mateo Club Cancels Polo Tilt With Farm Riders
## Team Prepares For Castro Match With Intra â€“ squad Game 
### 
Stanford's mallet swingers will not
play the San Mateo Polo Club today
as planned, announced Polo Coach
Captain Haydon Grubbs in giving
out the tentative schedule of games
for the autumn quarter. Inability to
play of six - goal player George
Pope, captain of the San Mateo team,
was the cause of the cancellation.
However, there will be a heated
intra-squad game on the highway
field at 3:00 o'clock, in preparation
for a return match next Friday with
last week's victorious Castro Valley
team. Bud Derby, regular number
two, is now in the hospital with
bronchitis, and today his place will
probably be filled by Don McAus
land, bold striker from the second
team.
The first team will then line up
with Rammy Rasmussen at one, Mc-
Ausland at two, Jim Fullerton play
ing number three, and Bob Fuller
ton in the back position he has held
for four years.
It is still not too late for those in
terested in polo, whether experi
enced or not, to join the squad, ac
cording to Captain Grubbs, who fur
her pointed out that Stanford offers
a splendid opportunity to any stu
dent to play this so-called "rich
man's" game,' Practice is held daily
at 3:00, Saturdays at 10:00, and there
will be a hard game every Friday
for the rest of the quarter.
