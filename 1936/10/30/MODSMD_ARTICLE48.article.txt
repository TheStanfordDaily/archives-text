# Water Dogs Meet Bruins At U.C.L.A.
## Farm Doped as Victors In Crucial Pool Battle; U. S. C. Tilt Tomorrow 
### GENE GEAR 
An invading band of Redskin wa
ter poloists will slap the water
around in the pint-sized bathtub of
the U.C.L.A. Bruins this afternoon
in a crucial Pacific Coast Conference
battle.
The Cardinals will enter the fray
in the role of slight favorites
mainly because of their 7-5 vic
tory over the defending champs on
the Farm two weeks ago. But
right there is where the Cardinal
edge terminates.
The Bruins have a dangerous
team; they are led by Dixon Fiske,
member of the Olympic Games team
this year, and they will be playing
in their own 60-foot pool. These
factors, combined with the fact that
John Lamb. Indian scoring ace who
tallied five times against the Bruins
in the first game, will enter the
game with a cut over his eye.
Lamb can't he counted on for
another five goals. The Bruins will
probably be watching him closer
this time, but this may be the
means of breaking Bill Ilanna
into the open for a few scores.
The following ten men made the
trip southward: Captain Bob Has
lacher, Bill lianna, Bob Hoover, Bob
Allen, John Lamb, Charles Giffen,
Don Peterson, Ben Voss, Jack
Loupe, and Pat Pearson.
Tomorrow morning Nort Thorn
ton's aquatic warriors will tussle
with the University of Southern
California Trojans in another con
ference struggle. The Farm wa
ter dogs won 9-1 last week from
the Trojans, using the junior var
sity half of the game.
A win from the Bruins is almost
imperative to keep Stanford's un
defeated squad in the race for the
championship. Over in Berkeley,
they are calling the Bear amphibians
"the wonder team," after their 5-0,
5-2, and 16-1 victories over the
Olympic Club, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C.
respectively.
