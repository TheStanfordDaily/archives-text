FOOTBALL SATURDAYS: Three
simple, light-weight woolens from
Mary Elizabeth are football minded
. . . one, an eel-grey, fitted snugly
along the hips, zipped tantalizingly
down its length, developed flatter
ingly at the shoulders by an epaulet
arrangement, and belted simply in
dull black leather . . . another, a two
piece rabbit's hair woolen with a
top of aqua blue, tiered in little
pockets, and a slip of a black skirt
. . . and, lastly, an unassuming, tai
lored one-piece, light as a zephyr,
trimmed somewhere along the line
with brown leather buttons which
are whipped into small whorls.

HI-BOYS: You probably saw
these high-top shoes*at the begin
ning of the season in one of the
fashion mags, and glanced them over
with jaundiced eye.
But that was at the first of the
season. If you're open-minded, the
advantages of this sane footwear
have appealed to you. So we know

you'll look up Tlioits if you're in
the market for a pair of campus
shoes, and ask for one of these two
hi-boy models:
1. A reversible calf-skin Bucko,
edged in polished alligator and eye
lei ted distinctly five times ($8.75).
2. A service buck in green or
black, pinked along the top, square
toed and leather-heeled ($5.00).

DORMITORY NIGIITS: 'When
the frost is on the punk in" you will
cherish a pair of corduroy pajamas
in some inspired autumn leaf shade,
stabbed by bright slashes of some
directly contrasting autumn leaf
shade ... or an all-wool flannel
bathrobe, suggested by the United
Air Lines as ideal for traveling . . .
both at Mary Elizabeth.
AD-VANTAGES: Thoits' irides
cent hose, the "Firefly" and "Spark
ler," Artcraft fashioned, which are
neutral enough to jibe with any one
of the vast range of winter shades
. . . their sandal-foot stocking, which,
by way of luxury, is reinforced only
at the heel, and barely perceptibly at
the toe . . . their new stock of eve
ning sandals, a black satin with a
strap-work lattice all piped in gold
kid, some satin-lame combinations,

sculpted octagonal heel . . . Mary
Elizabeth's coronation dressâ€”a true
jewel-tone green, literally studded
with small gem flowers . . . her soft
grey felt hat, which descends from
gregt to jut over one eye.
