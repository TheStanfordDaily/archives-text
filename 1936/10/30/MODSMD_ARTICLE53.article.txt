HIGHLAND FLING: Phelps-Ter
kel has clans of Scotch 'plaid ties, in
patterns copied faithfully from those
of the families which bore them and
dubbed by the names of those fam
ilies. There are Douglases and
Campbells and Stuarts lying ami
cably side by side in the store win
dow while old men Douglas, Camp
bell, and Stuart are probably turn
ing over in their graves. There is
even a Macbeth in the lot, a pattern
largely predominated by a sultry
purple shade.
The collective racks of Phelps-
Terkel look like a surrealist's night
mare, laden with such a battling
bunch of checks, stripes, plaids, and
tweeds. But upon singling a few
items out for close inspection, we
found that they can be made to purr
with accessories of their own kind.
For instance,
there is the English draped top-coat,
raglan-sleeved, in black and white
homespun. There is a variation of
that homespun in a brown-green
and tan flecked suit. Then there is
shat brown shadow plaid top-coat
in the window which is an interest
ing hybrid between the loose slung
English type and the more conven
tional American pocketed, belted,
Joe College breed.

DOG IN THE MANGER: We
warned you that the Mud Hound at
Zwierlein's - Walk-Over would be
barking up your tree.
Now that the rainy season is com
ing down the stretch, the Mud
Hound at Zwierlein's wants it known
that he is a thick-skinned, double
soled, tough as nails breed, who will
withstand all kinds of weather, and
emerge with his Scotch grain sleek
as ever.
ZWIERLEIN-WALK-OVER
ADD-VANTAGES: The Allen A
plaid sox at Zwierlein's—not sub

. . . the lumber-jack shirts at Phelps-
Terkel from the North Woods . . .
their dubonnet square scarf, coin
dotted conspicuously in yellow, to
be jammed in the throat of a brown
cashmere sweater . . . their linen
crash, and natural silk polo shirts in
undyed state.
Greece and Albania have no radio
broadcasting stations.

HIGHLAND FLING: Phelps-Ter
kel has clans of Scotch 'plaid ties, in
patterns copied faithfully from those
of the families which bore them and
dubbed by the names of those fam
ilies. There are Douglases and
Campbells and Stuarts lying ami
cably side by side in the store win
dow while old men Douglas, Camp
bell, and Stuart are probably turn
ing over in their graves. There is
even a Macbeth in the lot, a pattern
largely predominated by a sultry
purple shade.
The collective racks of Phelps-
Terkel look like a surrealist's night
mare, laden with such a battling
bunch of checks, stripes, plaids, and
tweeds. But upon singling a few
items out for close inspection, we
found that they can be made to purr
with accessories of their own kind.
For instance,
there is the English draped top-coat,
raglan-sleeved, in black and white
homespun. There is a variation of
that homespun in a brown-green
and tan flecked suit. Then there is
shat brown shadow plaid top-coat
in the window which is an interest
ing hybrid between the loose slung
English type and the more conven
tional American pocketed, belted,
Joe College breed.
PHELPS-TERKEL
DOG IN THE MANGER: We
warned you that the Mud Hound at
Zwierlein's - Walk-Over would be
barking up your tree.
Now that the rainy season is com
ing down the stretch, the Mud
Hound at Zwierlein's wants it known
that he is a thick-skinned, double
soled, tough as nails breed, who will
withstand all kinds of weather, and
emerge with his Scotch grain sleek
as ever.
ZWIERLEIN-WALK-OVER
ADD-VANTAGES: The Allen A
plaid sox at Zwierlein's—not sub
dued in color but surprisingly com
patible with this season's suitings
. . . the lumber-jack shirts at Phelps-
Terkel from the North Woods . . .
their dubonnet square scarf, coin
dotted conspicuously in yellow, to
be jammed in the throat of a brown
cashmere sweater . . . their linen
crash, and natural silk polo shirts in
undyed state.
