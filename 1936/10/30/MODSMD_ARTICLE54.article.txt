# Bruins Primed for Game; Expect Second Straight Win from Farm Gridders
## Cardinal Team Ready for Difficult Battle As Members Sustain Slight Injuries; U.C.L.A. Mentor Predicts Bruin Win Daily Bruin Sports Editor 
### FRANK STEWART 
WESTWOOD, Oct. 28.—1n anything but a calm and collected mood,
General Will Spuulding and hi* gridiron warriors of this locality have been
drilling long and hard all week in anticipation of tomorrow's invasion of
Chief Tiny ThornhilPs dangerous tribe of marauding Redskins.
An enthusiastic homecoming crowd of around 60,000 is expected to be
on hand to see the Bruins and the Indians, traditional rivals of eleven years'

standing, square oft' on the Los An-t
geles Coliseum battle turf, commenc
ing at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Cards Lose First Game
Back in 1925 U.C.L.A. and Stan
ford first met in football combat,
with the Bruins receipting for an 82
to 0 pasting. The second battle came
in 1928, and since then the West
wooders and the Palo Altans have
faced each other annually in the
great collegiate pastime. Going into
tomorrow's encounter, Stanford
holds a 7 to 2 edge in the nine pre
vious games played.
On the basis of their respective
records this season, however, the
veteran U.C.L.A. varsity is being
favored to take second straight de
cision over a less experienced but
improving Indian eleven. Last year
the Bruins surprised by tagging the
Rose Bowl champions with their
only defeat.
Still Have Chance
That torrid 7 to 6 triumph over
Grayson, Moscrip, and company last
year gave U.C.L.A. a one-third slice
of the Pacific Coast Conference
championship melon. The other por
tions of the melon went to the
"Northern Branch" (there is nothing
like rubbing it in) and to another
northern institution named (ah,
go ahead, guess).
And so it will be co-champ versus
co-champ tomorrow, with only the
home team still in a position to de
fend successfully its 1935 laurels.
Whereas the Indians have lost two
games and tied one in conference
competition to date, the Bruins are
still within shooting distance of
league leadership with a pair of vic
tories and one defeat to their credit.
Reds Just Starting
But that's what's causing Head Man
Spaulding so much worry. Thorn
hill's team will go into tomorrow's
tussle with everything to win and
nothing to lose. On the other hand,
Spaulding feels that his squad will
be under the psychological handicap
of knowing that it must win or else
lose all hope for another champion
ship.
Another thing that is causing the
genial Uclan pigskin professor to
worry more than is his wont is the
fact that the Stanford outfit is only
beginning to find its stride. Its ex
cellent performance against the
powerful Trojans last week-end
showed that it not only has a good
defense but a very dangerous aerial
attack.
Oregon State Tough
Still another cause for gloom on
Spaulding's part is the condition of
Captain George Dickerson, Pete Bar
ber, Bob Barr, and Jack Hastings,
first-string tackles and guards. These
four mainstays of the local line have
been on the sidelines all week with
injuries and are very doubtful start
ers tomorrow.
Last week the Bruins had the
doubtful pleasure of tackling one of
those "improving" teams, namely,
Oregon State, and had to stage a
fourth-quarter rally to come through
with a hard-earned 22 to 13 victory.
Tomorrow another one of those
"improving-with-every-start" teams
—namely, Stanford—moves against
the burly bruins. But the Spaulding
charges are all primed to turn back
the Red machine—we hope!

ship.
Another thing that is causing the
genial Uclan pigskin professor to
worry more than is his wont is the
fact that the Stanford outfit is only
beginning to find its stride. Its ex
cellent performance against the
powerful Trojans last week-end
showed that it not only has a good
defense but a very dangerous aerial
attack.
Oregon State Tough
Still another cause for gloom on
Spaulding's part is the condition of
Captain George Dickerson, Pete Bar
ber, Bob Barr, and Jack Hastings,
first-string tackles and guards. These
four mainstays of the local line have
been on the sidelines all week with
injuries and are very doubtful start
ers tomorrow.
Last week the Bruins had the
doubtful pleasure of tackling one of
those "improving" teams, namely,
Oregon State, and had to stage a
fourth-quarter rally to come through
with a hard-earned 22 to 13 victory.
Tomorrow another one of those
"improving-with-every-start" teams
—namely, Stanford—moves against
the burly bruins. But the Spaulding
charges are all primed to turn back
the Red machine—we hope!
WESTWOOD, Oct. 28.—1n anything but a calm and collected mood,
General Will Spuulding and hi* gridiron warriors of this locality have been
drilling long and hard all week in anticipation of tomorrow's invasion of
Chief Tiny ThornhilPs dangerous tribe of marauding Redskins.
An enthusiastic homecoming crowd of around 60,000 is expected to be
on hand to see the Bruins and the Indians, traditional rivals of eleven years'

standing, square oft' on the Los An-t
geles Coliseum battle turf, commenc
ing at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Cards Lose First Game
Back in 1925 U.C.L.A. and Stan
ford first met in football combat,
with the Bruins receipting for an 82
to 0 pasting. The second battle came
in 1928, and since then the West
wooders and the Palo Altans have
faced each other annually in the
great collegiate pastime. Going into
tomorrow's encounter, Stanford
holds a 7 to 2 edge in the nine pre
vious games played.
On the basis of their respective
records this season, however, the
veteran U.C.L.A. varsity is being
favored to take second straight de
cision over a less experienced but
improving Indian eleven. Last year
the Bruins surprised by tagging the
Rose Bowl champions with their
only defeat.
Still Have Chance
That torrid 7 to 6 triumph over
Grayson, Moscrip, and company last
year gave U.C.L.A. a one-third slice
of the Pacific Coast Conference
championship melon. The other por
tions of the melon went to the
"Northern Branch" (there is nothing
like rubbing it in) and to another
northern institution named (ah,
go ahead, guess).
And so it will be co-champ versus
co-champ tomorrow, with only the
home team still in a position to de
fend successfully its 1935 laurels.
Whereas the Indians have lost two
games and tied one in conference
competition to date, the Bruins are
still within shooting distance of
league leadership with a pair of vic
tories and one defeat to their credit.
Reds Just Starting
But that's what's causing Head Man
Spaulding so much worry. Thorn
hill's team will go into tomorrow's
tussle with everything to win and
nothing to lose. On the other hand,
Spaulding feels that his squad will
be under the psychological handicap
of knowing that it must win or else
lose all hope for another champion
ship.
