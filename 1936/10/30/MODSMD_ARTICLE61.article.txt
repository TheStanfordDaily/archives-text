Bumming to Bunn. Hitch-hiking
from Springfield, Illinois, to Stan
ford to see about his college edu
cation. That's the story of Joe Ash
craft, '39, member of the varsity
basketball team.
Ashcraft was a star basketballer
back home. He wanted to come
to Stanford. So in the summer of
1935 he left Springfield via thumb.
Alter touring through the South,
he arrived on the campus two
weeks later, only to find that
Coach John Bunn, the man he
wanted to see, was down in La
Jolla. Although Joe had gone
through that town a few days
before, be retraced his steps.
Bunn took an interest in him and
advised him to take a year's school
ing in a junior college. So Ashcraft
rushed back to Springfield in the
same way he had come West in five
days in order to start school on time.
After completing his studies at

Springfield Junior College, Ash
craft came again to California, this
time in a borrowed car. The re
sult ol this trip was that after tak
ing the aptitude test, he was ad
mitted into Stanford. Then be re
turned home to work during the
summer.
Finally in late August, Joe re
turned to Stanford, again by his fa
vorite mode of travel. Since he ar
rived on the campus early, he went
out for football, later transferring to
basketball.
That's the modern youth's story of
old Horace Greeley's advice, "Go
West, young man, go West."
Now Joe Ashcraft is a member of
the varsity hoop squad. Coach Bunn
thinks he may get a chance to go
East with the team this winter. The
coach says he doesn't think Joe will
have to bum his way, but maybe it
would be a good idea for the whole
team to thumb their way to save
expenses.
