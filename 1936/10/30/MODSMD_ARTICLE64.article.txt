# Rifle Club Elects Ogilvie President
## 
### 
Harry Ogilvie was elected new
president of the Stanford Rifle and
Pistol Club, replacing President Jim
Culver, and took over Wednesday's
meeting, using the butt of a .45 for a
gavel. Secretary-treasurer Bob Kahn
was re-elected.
The club is planning a number of
matches, and hopes that they will be
as successful as the first match Oc
tober 21 with the Palo Alto police
force, in which the Stanford shaip
shooters beat the Paly officers with
a score of 1291 to 1206.
