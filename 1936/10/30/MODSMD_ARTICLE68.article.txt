Yesterday afternoon, in the fea
ture contest in the intramural foot
ball competition, Chi Psi I ran ram
pant over a demoralized Theta Chi II
squad, 46-0.
The Chi Psi lads piled up a total
of seven touchdowns, five of which
were accounted for, directly or in
directly, by Clark, to win in a walk.
Theta Delts Win
The Theta Delt-El Campo game,
which the Thetas won by a 13-0 tally,
however, produced the premier long
run of the day when Todd rambled
80 yards to u score, after, taking a
lateral pass from Moller.
Closest game was that between
Phi Kappa .Sig and Encina 2E, in
which the highly favored Greek-let
ter men were greatly extended to
nose out a one-point, overtime tri
umph.
Faye and Rhodes stood out for Phi
Ka'p.
I).U. Trounces Toyon
The day's fourth contest found the
Delta Upislon powerhouse, led by
Cowan, hammering out a nifty 34-0
win over Toyon 11. D.U. was con
sistently the more effective organiza
tion, scoring 20 in the first half, and
14 in the second session.
In the one remaining game which
was actually played, El Toro shoved
Phi Sig into the dirt to the tune of
26-0, while Business School II was
taking a forfeit victory from En
cina lE.
