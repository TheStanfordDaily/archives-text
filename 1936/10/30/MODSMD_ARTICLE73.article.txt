With the Young Republicans' free show in
the City and the Toyon Informal tonight, the
Cellar extravaganza and marshmallow toast to
morrow night, and the matter of a U.C.L.A. game
somewhere south of here, there is ample reason
for steering a v/ide berth around the Paly
Theater pestilential area this week-end.
The technique for tomorrow night's dance
would seem to be that for those plutocrats who
feel a moral obligation to spend dough, to take
out the super-charged limousine, steer a course
away from the super-charging Paly Theaters,
and take in the movies at Menlo, Mayfield, or
Mountain View, and then return to the campus
for a spot of dancing in pleasant surroundings.
For those who do not have an automobile,
the campus is very large and you can do your
rioting around here. The campus is adequately
fitted with paths and scenery. And there is a
moon. We're lucky that we don't have to ask
the B.A.C. for that.
