Three dead—rather a morbid ending to a
triumphant gridiron expedition in which U.C.-
L.A. defeated Cal 17-6 two weeks ago.
Three were badly injured in auto accidents
when U.S.C. swarmed to the Stanford campus
last Saturday; another series of dulling events
that take the edge off of any victory on the
football field.
This afternoon, hundreds of Stanford stu
dents will set out in a mad rush for Los
Angeles to make the game tomorrow. Many
of them will be returning home for the week
end, but others v/ill be going down solely for
the side. Boom, disipate, drink wisely and not
too well—if you must —but v/hen it's time to
start the road back, be sure that when you see
the curve in the road, you follow convention
and take that curve with due decorum.
Stanford has been more than lucky during
the past few years in having no students in
volved in fatal accidents. Perhaps it has been
partially luck and partially the fairly good com
mon sense of the Stanford student.
The train is safe but if you must drive your
own, start back to the Farm without the glassy
eye, and keep the road in front of you rather
than above.
