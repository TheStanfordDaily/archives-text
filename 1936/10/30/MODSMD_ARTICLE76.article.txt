# Straw Poll
## 
### 
Well, it seems that even Stanford's straw poll
can't be accurate. The 200 stuffed ballots in the
box would be enough to throw out any other
election, but nobody seems to care much on ?
s'raw poll.
Stanford's undergraduates hewad to the tra
ditional line of Republicanism, which is not hard
for anyone to explain.
The fact that the faculty was predominantly
Democratic, particularly in those departments,
v/here political belief should make a difference,
would seem to indicate that the researches of
the academic mind were not trickling down to

the students. Or, as my father, who is a Re
publican, would say: "It shows that the stu
dents have more sense than the faculty."
Anyway, thanks are due Dave Allison and his
election board for supervising the returns. If it
hadn't have been for his minions, the 200 or
less missing ballots would not have been lo
cated in the ballot box.
