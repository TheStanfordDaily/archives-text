# Cellar Marches On
## 
### 
Comptroller Almon E. Roth has suggested the
proposition of a $25,000 extension to the Cellar
as a solution to the local night club void.
Ex Committee is deferring action on that until
the experiment of the Golf Clubhouse is tried,
but it is a little afraid that this would not be
quite what is wanted.
The idea behind the Lagunita boathouse plan
is that it is just far enough out of the ordinary
run of things, and yet close enough to be avail
able.
There is a fear on the part of the students that
the Cellar extension would be too formal, too
hall-like, not night-clubbish enough.
On the other hand, any proposition to reno
vate the boathouse would involve a complete
reconstruction, which Mr. Roth says would run
into more money than a Cellar addition be
cause of the necessity for equipping a new
fountain and expenses attendant to setting up
a building up in the wilds of Lagunita. There
is the added factor that the money from the
Union Building fund might not be available for
construction of buildings away from the Union,
though there would to be justification for
using building money from the student-financed
Union for building a unit of the Cellar, even if
the unit were up at Lake Lagunita.
One thing which Mr. Roth fears is that a lone
project such as a Lagunita one is apt to become
a white elephant if student trade changes from
campus to highway joint as it has from high
way joint to highway joint, depending upon the
whim of the students.
And that is one thing that the Old Union
experiment must show: that there is a definite
campus need, which cannot be filled either
down the highway or up in the City.
