STANFORD'S LIT-TLE RED HEN
'"Stan-ford is a Uni-ver-sity. It has a lot of Stu
dents. It has a lot of Mon-ey. it wants more.
"It al-so has a golf club House, and quite enough of
a Golf Course, thank you. The Stu-dents have the use
of the Golf Course, na-tur-al-ly, be-cause the Uni-ver
sity is be-ing run for Stu-dents. *
And so say-ing, the Lit-tle Red Hen cock-ed her
Lit-tle Red Head and shook the spot of Brains God
has re-served for hens.
"God is Tyove," she smiled. "This is a Beau-ti-ful
Uni-ver-sity. And all the people at the 8.A.C., ev-cn
those who de-ny Stu-dents the use of their Club-
House, arc Beau-ti-ful People. They are all smart. And
if they do not let the Stu-dents use the Club-House for
a dance, you may be sure there is good rea-son, like
not bc-ing able to af-ford a Sev-cn Dol-lar attend
ant to watch the Girls and keep the nice new Fur-ni
ture from get-ting dir-ty.''

"Today is Flag Day." she said.
"Af-tcr all, Mis-ter Mas-ters is not at the Beau
ti-ful Uni-ver-sity at pres-cnt. He has gone away.
That leaves all the Beau-ti-ful people at <hc B.A.C.
just look-ing Bcau-ti-ful. They can-not do any-thing
be-cause Mis-ter Mas-ters is not here. All they are
sup-posed to do, you see, is say: "I'll take it up with
Mis-ter Mas-ters."
"Doc-tor Wil-bur is a Nice Man. Dean Cul-ver is
a nice man, and so is Dean Yost and Miss De Prau.
But no one can do any-thing for the Stu-dents un
less Mis-ter Mas-ters is here."
Then the Lit-tle Red Hen fid-gct-ed and said.
'Please cx-cuse me, for I am Stan-ford's Of-fi-cial
Egg Lay-er, and I must work."
"Don't you think c-nough Eggs have been laid
a-round here?" I queried.
"I do not like your At-ti-tude," said the Lit-tle
Red Hen. You are try-ing to find out a-bout the
Club-House, and Mis-ter Mas-ters is not here. Not
on-ly would the Beau-ti-ful B.A.C. have to pay for
an At-tendant, but it would al-so have to spend lots
and lots of Big Game Prof-its on ex-tra So-da Clerks.
Be-sidcs, the Gar-den-er sleeps at the Club-House,
and he can-not be kept up on ac-count of the
Stu-dents."
"Then we can-not dance in the Club-House?"
"Not un-less you see Mis-ter Mas-ters."
"Have you seen Mr. Mas-ters?"
"Oh, sure," said the Lit-tle Red Hen, "and last week
he said you could not use the Club-House."
"Then all these Ex-cuses arc so much Gar-bagc,"
I said.
"Stan-ford Gar-bagc," said the Lit-tle Red Hen.
