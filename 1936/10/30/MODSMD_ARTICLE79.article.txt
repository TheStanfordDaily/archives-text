STELLAR CELLAR STRUGGLE
Since Stanford % hras h fiy-by-nightery
I guess the boys won't now get tightcry,
Will keep themselves in good repute
By going on a Cellar toot.
These cocky boys who don't go down to check up on
Bawlout proofs when they're posted for correction,
sometimes find themselves surprised when the Bawlout
comes out. Although you seldom find anybody com
plaining of being put plus 200 when they should bo
plus 20. every once in a while the boys who should be
plus 89 scream when the Bawlouts come out accusing
them of being minus 80. There is also the matter of the
poor registration clerks who have a hard time figuring
out the Greek letters that the boys write in their cute
little reg books while juggling chairs and a table and
two chairs and a professor on the other knee. Which
is all in the way of saying that severai sorority women
huve been calling up the Kappa Alpha Thcta house to
date Richard Bancroft.
But th;it's nothing, the Phi Sigs report they have a
! Â«al who actually wants to pledge. She walked in the
i other night, set her suitcases down in the living room,
J and announced that she w;is there to stay. The boys
j kicked her out. She didn't have an initiation fee.
