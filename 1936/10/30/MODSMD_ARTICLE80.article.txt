with 'em . . . Boh PresneH rolling
all over the gym floor on a piano
mover's dolly . . . Paul Crary shoot

at the back of the chorus girls' laps
POSSIBILITIES DulcO Parker's
tune, "Phi Beta Kappa in Love," is a
natural . . . Extra-clever lyrics . . .
Gerry Schreiber. only singer of the
afternoon who knew how to sell her
song to an audience . . . Give the
gal a little training and she'll be
okay.

the campus rendezvous problem with

set-ups, though the latter are tech
nically forbidden . . . Only compe
tition is what the Wisconsin Cardi
nal's former editor termed "two ex
cellent roadhouses" about six miles
