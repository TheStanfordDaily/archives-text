THAT SHOW'S HERE AGAIN!
The Gaieties, we mean Tryouts yes
terday brought back that old hectic
atmosphere that always attends the
annual search for talent. Old Roble
Gym presented a scene even crazier
than the movies would paint it.
GLIMPSES AT TRYOUTS: The
gang around Mac Gordon's rhyth
mical piano . . . Bud Bernhardt, hair
over eyes, making strange noises like
a hopped up Harry Barris . . . Shirley
Jones in the group, "Wa-de-ho-ho
ho-ing" like the rest . . . Angelica
Hill and Bud Cady going to town
with 'em . . . Boh PresneH rolling
all over the gym floor on a piano
mover's dolly . . . Paul Crary shoot
ing paper wads with a rubber band
at the back of the chorus girls' laps
POSSIBILITIES DulcO Parker's
tune, "Phi Beta Kappa in Love," is a
natural . . . Extra-clever lyrics . . .
Gerry Schreiber. only singer of the
afternoon who knew how to sell her
song to an audience . . . Give the
gal a little training and she'll be
okay.

University of Wisconsin has solved
the campus rendezvous problem with
the 770 Club . . . Located in the
Memorial Union Building, in the
heart of the campus, the club func

set-ups, though the latter are tech
nically forbidden . . . Only compe
tition is what the Wisconsin Cardi

cellent roadhouses" about six miles
