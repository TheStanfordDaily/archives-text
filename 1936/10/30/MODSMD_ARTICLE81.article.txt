Silk hats are being whisked, fur
wraps removed from their moth balls
in San Francisco today for Grand
] Opera season begins tonight. And
Opera means so much to San Fran
ciscans that tickets for it seldom go
on public sale; private subscriptions
virtually fill the house.
Tonight's opera, La Juivc, by a
; Fx-enchman, Halcvy, with its cos
tumes of the Middle Age, its ballet,
pomp, and fanfare is well suited for
an opening performance. Paris chose
it to dedicate her own splendid opera
| house. Gaetano Merola directs, while
I in the cast Elizabeth Rethberg ap
pears as Rachel, the veteran Gio
! vanni Martinclli and Ezio Pinza sup
-5 porting her.
Saturday Rossini's robust The
Barber of Seville will inaugurate the
; first of the Opera Association's pop
ular scries. A newcomer, Carlo
Morelli of Chicago will play Figaro,
! while Charles Kullman sings the
I tenor Almaviva; Rosina will be play-
I ed again by Josephine Tumminia.
Next week's performances number
four. Midquartcrs, seats means little,
j I shall stand to hear Kirsten Flag
i stad sing Wagner's Isolde Monday
night. Lauritz Melchior, Emmanuel
List, Friedrich Schorr, and Kathryn
Meisle, whom we heard last year
too, in the unforgettable Ring also
! appear.
Wednesday night Carmen is being
sung, with Bruna Castagna, soprano,
in the title role — Charles Kullman,
i Ezio Pinza, and Tumminia support
ing. Gennaro Papi of the Metropoli
tan will direct. Lawrence Tibbctt
should be a dynamic Rigolctto a
week from tonight. It will be inter
esting to compare this performance,
with Pinza, Tumminia, and Kullman
in the other chief roles, with last
I year s San Carlo Company produc
j tion. «
Students who have not tickets will
1 probably find it difficult to get scats
' lor even the popular night produc
lion; standing room can be pur
■ chased at the door.

Tonight's opera, La Juivc, by a
; Fx-enchman, Halcvy, with its cos
tumes of the Middle Age, its ballet,
pomp, and fanfare is well suited for
an opening performance. Paris chose
it to dedicate her own splendid opera
| house. Gaetano Merola directs, while
I in the cast Elizabeth Rethberg ap
pears as Rachel, the veteran Gio
! vanni Martinclli and Ezio Pinza sup
-5 porting her.

I ed again by Josephine Tumminia.
