The Editor, Sir:
After hearing Dr. Trueblood'sl
last sermon, I found that I did not I
agree with him at all. This Sunday, ;
I find that he has taken a more in
tolerable course of inconsistency.
Two weeks ago, Dr. Trueblood's
plea was for young people who don't
try to reason out problems of re
ligion or general conduct, but let
their emotions be their complete
masters and "bang their heads into
hidden stone walls."
The idea is that some of the en
thusiasts may by chance miss all the
"stone walls" and luckily hit a wise
course. Any doubts are wicked. In
tellectual questioning is to be shun
ned. Now, everyone fall into line
behind Papa Townsend. That he may
be a little wrong must not make us
hesitate in the least.
Last Sunday, Pastor Trueblood
turned around to decry the easy
standards of our parents, which-do
not inspire a spirit of revolt as did
the earlier rock-bound Puritanism.
In contrast to the previous admoni
tion, he asks us this week to aim for
a goal of "intellectual freedom and
open-minded thought" in establish
ing a personal religion. This is any
thing but similar to "falling in love,"
but Dr. Trueblood's earlier assertion
was that the getting of religion
should be like the poiseless process
of falling in love.
Does everyone else on this whole
campus disagree with this frosh? If
the flags were waved for a war with
Japan, for instance, would the whole
school let their emotions be their
guides and rush to the colors, with
out wondering whether or not there
was a munitions maker in the wood
pile? Of course, any doubts of this
kind would be sophistication, and,
according to Dr. Trueblood, wickcd.
Will Dr. Trueblood please come
out from behind the shrubbery and
tell us whether he wants us to be
enthusiastic Townsendites or reason
ing creatures?
