# CORRECTING CORRECTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In your Tuesday morning issue, I
read a communication which must
be corrected, along with the author's
pseudo-knowledge. I refer to the
Campus Opinion that- is captioned:
"Impeccable French."
The author saw or heard a news
reel in Paris. People speak French
in Paris, uncorrupted French. In
Quebec, a Frenchman is brilliant in
deed. if he can adjust himself to the
dialect immediately. Ask some
Frenchman who has been there. He
will tell you that no one speaks
French in Quebec. I fail to see the
justification of Mr. Moore's criticism,
in view of the fact that Mr. Roosdvelt
was addressing French-Canadians,
not Parisians. While I don't doubt
that his friends, the Parisians, didn't
approve the accent, it is evidenced
by the cheers (which Mr. Moore
would have heard had he listened)
recorded after the brief speech in
French.
All this in defense of Bob Eisen
bach's column, which quite obvious
ly needs no defense. I repeat: THE
GREAT GENTLEMAN did speak
impeccably of the assembled French-
Canadians.
