The Editor, Sir:
I would like to make use of your
columns to congratulate those who

have been working for a student
"nitery" on the campus. I think the
clubhouse is about as good a place
as there is on the campus at present
for an initial trial of the scheme and
if the Committee pushes as hard to
make the first week a success as they
have thus far, it can't fail.
I am glad to sec that The Daily is
so thoroughly behind the plan and I
hope it will continue to get front
page publicity.
