# MORE ON MOORE

The Editor, Sir:
I read with some interest the let
ter entitled, "Impeccable Frcneh,"
written by Bob Moore.
He says he saw a newsreel in Paris
last summer of President Roosevelt's
visit to Quebec and that the Presi
dent's French was greeted by
"sneers, guffaws, cat-calls and voices
rising in indignation." Now I am
not interested in the President's
French. I do not know whether it is
good or bad but I am interested in
Mr. Moore's testimony concerning
French manners.
Let us reverse the situation. Sup
pose the President of France had

visited an English-speaking country
and had endeavored to speak to his
audience in its mother tongue with
indifferent or even with no success
at all. I am fairly certain that, if a
newsreel of this occasion had been
shown in a theater in San Francisco
or in Palo Atlo, the French Presi
dent's speech, even in bad English,
would have met a courteous recep
tion. I think it might even have
been applauded as a "noble aflort."
If Mr. Moore's interpretation of
what he saw and heard in Paris is
correct it seems to me that it is time
to talk less about traditional French
courtesy and more about the good
manners of Americans.
