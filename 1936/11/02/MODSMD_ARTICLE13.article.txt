# THE 						RIGHT THING
## 
### 
In a time
When Truth itself
Is questioned
When social disintegration
Has brought regimentation
And experimentation,
When the old faiths are disap
pearing
Mores, folkways, mocking,
jeering,
Materialism
Idealism
Neither right.
You have the nerve my former
lover
To come here under cover,
And say you want to do
The right thing.
In 1708 two men —William Glover
and Col. Thomas Cary—claimed the
North Carolina governorship. Each
agreed to issue writs for an election.
The election was held and Cary won.

Tickets for "Roadside," to be pre
sented by the Dramatic Council Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall, will
go on sale today from 10 to 2 o'clock
at the Post Office, and may be ob
tained during the remainder of the
week at the A.S.S.U. Office.
New low prices will be in effect for
the play, according to Dramatic
Manager Diuk Daugherty, so that
productions will be available to more
people. Seats will be $1, 75 cents, and
50 cents; unreserved 35-cent seats
are also obtainable.
A new 50-cent section has been es
tablished downstairs, balcony center

and old 75-cent side sections have
been cut to 50 cents.
