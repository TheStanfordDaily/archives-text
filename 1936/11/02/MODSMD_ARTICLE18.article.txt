# SAM HAYES-HOW HE MADE GOOD
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: We conclude the
story of Sam Hayes, Richfield re
porter and former Stanford stu
dent, which was started last week.
The interview was written by
Sharp YVhitniore.)
His sudden ascent from salesman
to radio news reporter was aided by
the smattering of radio work he had
had before coming to Stanford.
"Train yourself as widely and as
widely as possible," he advises.
Ss Voice in Movies
Today, if a football game is being
announced, or if you hear a radio
news report in a motion picture, nine
of ten chances it's Hayes. Movie
contracts supplement his radio work,
although he is rarely seen.
In his offices in Los Angeles' Rich
field building, a towering black-and
gold structure built with more of an
eye to architectural impressiveness
than heat resistance, he has a staff
of five men and six women.

He spends three to four hours
each day there. Two teletypes bring
in wire news. Each article is clipped
for him, sorted into appropriate
piles. He arrives at 7:1)0 each eve
ning, goes through the pile of copy,
and has the chosen items pasted on
large sheets of cardboard. Each is a
network of underlinings and mark
ings. Pronunciation, enunciation,
emphasis, are all indicated at a
glance. He goes through the talk
once in his crisp rapid-fire manner
and is timed for length. He adds his
personal announcements, any last
minute news, and leaves for the ra
dio station.
Deluged with Mail
He caters to fan mail. The Rich
field advertising campaign is de
signed to prompt inquiries as to
where to drive, condition of roads,
etc. "That's 1)0 for tonight, friends,"
his sign-off sentence, brought in in
numerable inquiries when he first
said it. Today it is as well known.

almost as is Hayes.
Today Hayes is 32. He could pose
for a sparse-hailed Esquire ad. He
stands (> feet 4, weighs 235 pounds,
looks like a football (fhd but never
was. He seems shy. This impression
is probably caused by his habit of
thinking before he talks, of sizing up
a visitor. He wears tweed or plaid
sports coats. An intense interest in
Stanford is immediately evidenced.
His speech is as clear in enuncia
tion and almost as fast as during his
broadcasts. His English is flawless
but unstilted. On his wide desk arc
over 20 books, all of them diction
aries, thesauri, or dialects. An ash
tray with "S.A.E. — Stanford" in
bronze flanks a book-end.
Cetting a Job
How get a job like his? He knows,
and he can explain it logically. "In
order to become acquainted with the
news, live it wholeheartedly," he
advises. He suggests newspaper
work, perhaps reporting, but prob

ably classified advertising as the first
step. "Then, after becoming estab
lished, quit. Go to an advertising
agency, and an ambitious one —one
that has the opening far up the line
that you want. From then it's up to
you. But as equipment for this job,
have a varied background.' His own
salesmanship, stock exchange work,
and radio experience were a perfect
combination. And two years of col
lege are necessary, he adds.
Would he go to Stanford again, if
he were beginning all over? '"Yes—
emphatically. I think it's the out
standing university in the nation."
Politics interest him. He is carry
ing on a poll similar to the Literary
Digest's, asking people to write in to
him. A commentator should, how
ever, view the campaign issues and
consequent propaganda impersonal
ly, he added hastily.
Interested in News
He reads newspapers word for
word —several of them. He is inter

ested in every national and interna
tional event, and if he fails to under
stand their significance he finds out.
During his years on the radio he has
had only one vacation. Rush Hughes,
well known in his own right, filled
in for him for two weeks.
Hayes doesn't claim that everyone
can get the job he wants. But if the
man has the capacity to handle it,
and supplies himself with the expe
rience, he is infinitely better fitted
than if he enrolled in college, grad
uated, and then tried to find a job.
His point about two years in college,
and no more, is not in any sense of
(he word a compromise. Junior and
senior years are devoted to a major
study, much more specialized than
are the first two. Yet a university is
better than a junior college, he
thinks, because of better faculty,
better contacts, richer experience.

Maine.—Old Republican ballad.

salesmanship, stock exchange work,
and radio experience were a perfect

he were beginning all over? '"Yes—

Digest's, asking people to write in to
him. A commentator should, how

During his years on the radio he has

(Editor's Note: We conclude the
story of Sam Hayes, Richfield re
porter and former Stanford stu
dent, which was started last week.
The interview was written by
Sharp YVhitniore.)
His sudden ascent from salesman
to radio news reporter was aided by
the smattering of radio work he had
had before coming to Stanford.
"Train yourself as widely and as
widely as possible," he advises.
Ss Voice in Movies
Today, if a football game is being
announced, or if you hear a radio
news report in a motion picture, nine
of ten chances it's Hayes. Movie
contracts supplement his radio work,
although he is rarely seen.
In his offices in Los Angeles' Rich
field building, a towering black-and
gold structure built with more of an
eye to architectural impressiveness
than heat resistance, he has a staff
of five men and six women.

He spends three to four hours
each day there. Two teletypes bring
in wire news. Each article is clipped
for him, sorted into appropriate
piles. He arrives at 7:1)0 each eve
ning, goes through the pile of copy,
and has the chosen items pasted on
large sheets of cardboard. Each is a
network of underlinings and mark
ings. Pronunciation, enunciation,
emphasis, are all indicated at a
glance. He goes through the talk
once in his crisp rapid-fire manner
and is timed for length. He adds his
personal announcements, any last
minute news, and leaves for the ra
dio station.
Deluged with Mail
He caters to fan mail. The Rich
field advertising campaign is de
signed to prompt inquiries as to
where to drive, condition of roads,
etc. "That's 1)0 for tonight, friends,"
his sign-off sentence, brought in in
numerable inquiries when he first
said it. Today it is as well known.

almost as is Hayes.
Today Hayes is 32. He could pose
for a sparse-hailed Esquire ad. He
stands (> feet 4, weighs 235 pounds,
looks like a football (fhd but never
was. He seems shy. This impression
is probably caused by his habit of
thinking before he talks, of sizing up
a visitor. He wears tweed or plaid
sports coats. An intense interest in
Stanford is immediately evidenced.
His speech is as clear in enuncia
tion and almost as fast as during his
broadcasts. His English is flawless
but unstilted. On his wide desk arc
over 20 books, all of them diction
aries, thesauri, or dialects. An ash
tray with "S.A.E. — Stanford" in
bronze flanks a book-end.
Cetting a Job
How get a job like his? He knows,
and he can explain it logically. "In
order to become acquainted with the
news, live it wholeheartedly," he
advises. He suggests newspaper
work, perhaps reporting, but prob

ably classified advertising as the first
step. "Then, after becoming estab
lished, quit. Go to an advertising
agency, and an ambitious one —one
that has the opening far up the line
that you want. From then it's up to
you. But as equipment for this job,

his sign-off sentence, brought in in
numerable inquiries when he first
said it. Today it is as well known.

almost as is Hayes.
Today Hayes is 32. He could pose
for a sparse-hailed Esquire ad. He
stands (> feet 4, weighs 235 pounds,
looks like a football (fhd but never
was. He seems shy. This impression
is probably caused by his habit of
thinking before he talks, of sizing up
a visitor. He wears tweed or plaid
sports coats. An intense interest in
Stanford is immediately evidenced.
His speech is as clear in enuncia
tion and almost as fast as during his
broadcasts. His English is flawless
but unstilted. On his wide desk arc
over 20 books, all of them diction
aries, thesauri, or dialects. An ash
tray with "S.A.E. — Stanford" in
bronze flanks a book-end.
Cetting a Job
How get a job like his? He knows,
and he can explain it logically. "In
order to become acquainted with the
news, live it wholeheartedly," he
advises. He suggests newspaper
work, perhaps reporting, but prob

ably classified advertising as the first
step. "Then, after becoming estab
lished, quit. Go to an advertising
agency, and an ambitious one —one
that has the opening far up the line
that you want. From then it's up to
you. But as equipment for this job,
have a varied background.' His own
salesmanship, stock exchange work,
and radio experience were a perfect
combination. And two years of col
lege are necessary, he adds.
Would he go to Stanford again, if
he were beginning all over? '"Yes—
emphatically. I think it's the out
standing university in the nation."
Politics interest him. He is carry
ing on a poll similar to the Literary
Digest's, asking people to write in to
him. A commentator should, how
ever, view the campaign issues and
consequent propaganda impersonal
ly, he added hastily.
Interested in News
He reads newspapers word for
word —several of them. He is inter

ested in every national and interna
tional event, and if he fails to under
stand their significance he finds out.
During his years on the radio he has
had only one vacation. Rush Hughes,
well known in his own right, filled
in for him for two weeks.
Hayes doesn't claim that everyone
can get the job he wants. But if the
man has the capacity to handle it,
and supplies himself with the expe
rience, he is infinitely better fitted
than if he enrolled in college, grad
uated, and then tried to find a job.
His point about two years in college,
and no more, is not in any sense of
(he word a compromise. Junior and
senior years are devoted to a major
study, much more specialized than
are the first two. Yet a university is
better than a junior college, he
thinks, because of better faculty,
better contacts, richer experience.

story of Sam Hayes, Richfield re
porter and former Stanford stu
dent, which was started last week.
The interview was written by
Sharp YVhitniore.)
His sudden ascent from salesman
to radio news reporter was aided by
the smattering of radio work he had
had before coming to Stanford.
"Train yourself as widely and as
widely as possible," he advises.
Ss Voice in Movies
Today, if a football game is being
announced, or if you hear a radio
news report in a motion picture, nine
of ten chances it's Hayes. Movie
contracts supplement his radio work,
although he is rarely seen.
In his offices in Los Angeles' Rich
field building, a towering black-and
gold structure built with more of an
eye to architectural impressiveness
than heat resistance, he has a staff
of five men and six women.

He spends three to four hours
each day there. Two teletypes bring
in wire news. Each article is clipped
for him, sorted into appropriate
piles. He arrives at 7:1)0 each eve
ning, goes through the pile of copy,
and has the chosen items pasted on
large sheets of cardboard. Each is a
network of underlinings and mark
ings. Pronunciation, enunciation,
emphasis, are all indicated at a
glance. He goes through the talk
once in his crisp rapid-fire manner
and is timed for length. He adds his
personal announcements, any last
minute news, and leaves for the ra
dio station.
Deluged with Mail
He caters to fan mail. The Rich
field advertising campaign is de
signed to prompt inquiries as to
where to drive, condition of roads,
