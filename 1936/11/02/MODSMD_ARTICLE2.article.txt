It is curtains for our quadren
nial Miracle Play of 19.'5 G.
My earliest political recollections
date back to the Bryan era. My
father was a Bryan man and with
filial duty I upheld Ihe family tra
dition. I had strong convictions.
Since then I have learned that the
strength of one's convictions usually
varies directly with the depth of
one's ignorance. My convictions
found expression in my lining up on
a side of tlie road with other brats
of my age and political faith and
challenging the enemy on the other
side with
Hurrah for Bryan! He's the man.
McKinley lives in a garbage can.
The enemy responded with
Fried cats and pickled rats
Is good enough for Dimmycrats.
Clod Fighters
The encounter usually ended with
a clod fight in which we shied jagged
chunks of flint-like Kansas gumbo
at the heads of the opposition. Our
marksmanship was pretty bad; the
casualties were slight; and after
election we engaged in friendly
quarrels over jacks, marbles, and
mumble peg.
Since then I have remained an in
corrigible political fan. This fall I
have tuned in on the major prophets
and the minor wind bags until Mrs.
Thompson has threatened me with
divorce proceedings and the neigh
bors have tried to shoot me. I have
heard the melodoius crooning, the
monotonous bleating, the forensic
trickery, the misrepresentation, the
half truths, the jockeying, the eva
sions, the impossible promises, the

dirty digs, and the attempts to put
the other fellow in the hole.
I have been promised sounder
money, a more efficient civil service,
better relief, more employment, low
er taxes, a balanced budget, peace,
prosperity, profits, blah, blah, blah,
and so on and so on. Only the can
didates wtihout hope of election
could indulge the luxury of intel
lectual honesty. Surely my childish
defense of Bryan with taunts and
clods was more honorable and
sporting if not more sensible. I won
der why men, in building up a can
didate, spend millions on stuffing
without considering the quality of
the shirt to be stuffed.
The Miracle Play
I referred to the campaign as a
Miracle Play. There are striking re
semblances. Like an American po
litical campaign, the medieval mir
acle play was highly institutional
ized. It presented, as its leading
characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle
play the devils rendered a real serv
ice by supplying a form of low com"
edy, while in a campaign we manage
to lose our sense of humor and the


"Sorry Coach, the quarterback had to go out and vote."
