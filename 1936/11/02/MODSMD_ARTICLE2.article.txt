It is curtains for our quadren
nial Miracle Play of 19.'5 G.
My earliest political recollections
date back to the Bryan era. My
father was a Bryan man and with
filial duty I upheld Ihe family tra
dition. I had strong convictions.
Since then I have learned that the
strength of one's convictions usually
varies directly with the depth of
one's ignorance. My convictions
found expression in my lining up on
a side of tlie road with other brats
of my age and political faith and
challenging the enemy on the other
side with
Hurrah for Bryan! He's the man.
McKinley lives in a garbage can.
The enemy responded with
Fried cats and pickled rats
Is good enough for Dimmycrats.
Clod Fighters
The encounter usually ended with
a clod fight in which we shied jagged
chunks of flint-like Kansas gumbo
at the heads of the opposition. Our
marksmanship was pretty bad; the
casualties were slight; and after
election we engaged in friendly
quarrels over jacks, marbles, and
mumble peg.
Since then I have remained an in
corrigible political fan. This fall I
have tuned in on the major prophets
and the minor wind bags until Mrs.
Thompson has threatened me with
divorce proceedings and the neigh
bors have tried to shoot me. I have
heard the melodoius crooning, the
monotonous bleating, the forensic
trickery, the misrepresentation, the
half truths, the jockeying, the eva
sions, the impossible promises, the

dirty digs, and the attempts to put
the other fellow in the hole.
I have been promised sounder
money, a more efficient civil service,
better relief, more employment, low
er taxes, a balanced budget, peace,
prosperity, profits, blah, blah, blah,
and so on and so on. Only the can
didates wtihout hope of election
could indulge the luxury of intel
lectual honesty. Surely my childish
defense of Bryan with taunts and
clods was more honorable and
sporting if not more sensible. I won
der why men, in building up a can
didate, spend millions on stuffing
without considering the quality of
the shirt to be stuffed.
The Miracle Play
I referred to the campaign as a
Miracle Play. There are striking re
semblances. Like an American po
litical campaign, the medieval mir
acle play was highly institutional
ized. It presented, as its leading
characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle
play the devils rendered a real serv
ice by supplying a form of low com"
edy, while in a campaign we manage
to lose our sense of humor and the


"Sorry Coach, the quarterback had to go out and vote."
devil act is a flop.
In a political campaign we have
our symbols of righteousness and
iniquity and an angel or a saint is
pitted against each devil or imp. It is
old stuff. We like the old. On the
side of righteousness there is the
Constitution. Few understand it,
but it must not be undermined. This
attitude goes back to the days when
John Marshall worked a miracle act
of his own by undermining the Con
stitution and at the same time cloth
ing it with inviolability and the Su
preme Court with omniscience, and
so the Court itself has become a
symbol of salvation.
Then there is Americanism. More
old stuff. The Know-Nothings used
that and it is still used by the know
nothings. Like the poor in scrip
ture, we have the know nothings
with us always. I know because 1
have been in so-called educational
work for many years. We have also
had paraded before us the angelic
symbols of Peace, Liberty, the Flag,
the Home, the School, and the
anced Budget. Saints have been
ushered in, notably Jefferson, Lin
coln, and Theodore the Greatâ€”all of
them a bit devilish in their day. but
no longer capable of deviltry. Good
old Tom. His picture hangs above
my desk and I keep wondering what
he would say about the use of his
name by the Jeffersonian Democrats.
Symbols of Iniquity
Among the symbols of iniquity we
have managed to introduce some
new characters. One is a monstrosity
by the name of Regimentation. An
other is known as Experimentation
in Government. And then there is
that dirty little devil in gown and
mortar board who answers to the
name of Brain Truster, Crack Pot,
or Professor. The imp called Com
munism has been doing double duty,
but Comrade Browder has almost
achieved respectability. The other
symbols of deviltry are not new. The
Dictatorship Act was staged in the
days of Andrew Jackson, Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Woodrow Wilson. Each one of these
saints trod the boards and took his
bow and was garbed in the satanic
vestments of dictatorship.
And now the play is ending. To
morrow we shall go through the
ceremony of rededicating our faith

in vox populi. Regardless of who is
elected, life will go on as before.
We shall continue to wear pants and
pay taxes. We shall go on living to
gether, helping one another, cheating
one another, washing one another's
shirts, and stealing one another's
automobiles.
Blessed with Faith
Fortunately, we do not take cam
paign threats too seriously. At the
movies we enjoy the thrill of mo
mentary fright when the villain still
pursues her, but we have faith in

the traditions of the scenario writer
and we know that in the end the hero
will make an honest woman out of
the heroine. In the heat of a polit
ical campaign we are also blessed
with faith. We may be ill at ease,
but down in our hearts we do not be
lieve that if the opposition is elected
it will mean grass grown streets,
desolated farms, smokeless chim
neys, and worthless insurance poli
cies. If we really believed all that,
the defeated minority would commit
hari kari as soon as the election re
sults came in.
Before my classes I have fre
quently paraphrased John Dewey's
and Matthew Arnold's definition of
education as "the development of a
discriminating intelligence which

will serve as a bulwark against the
invasion of bunk." The educated
should be able to distinguish be
tween the conspicuous and the im
portant. Political campaigns are
conspicuous, but their importance is
relative. History will probably prove
that the movement now under way
in American labor organizations is
far more important than the outcome
of the presidential election. The so
cial effects of a mechanical cotton
picker is more far-reaching than any
political victory in the cotton belt.
At this very moment, some obscure
scientist, tinkering with his test
tubes in a Stanford lab, may be shap
ing tomorrow's triumph or despair.
Who knows?
Bellows and Ballots
Our social relationships are shaped
by our means of production and not
by bellowing and balloting. The
rendezvous with destiny was not
held in a Philadelphia stadium. It is
held daily on our farms and in our
factories, and we. are so constituted
that we will attempt an honest solu
tion of our problems only when we
are driven by impending necessity.
Is this cynical? Not at all. I love
the line Paul Engle sings, "This is a
hell of a big country, mister." It is
too big to be saved or ruined by the
outcome of this election. Naturally,
I shall express my preference, but
win or lose, I shall not be down
hearted. I still have faith in the old
saw, "God takes care of drunkards,
little children, and the United
States."

at the heads of the opposition. Our
marksmanship was pretty bad; the

election we engaged in friendly
quarrels over jacks, marbles, and

Since then I have remained an in
corrigible political fan. This fall I
have tuned in on the major prophets
and the minor wind bags until Mrs.

divorce proceedings and the neigh
bors have tried to shoot me. I have
heard the melodoius crooning, the

defense of Bryan with taunts and
clods was more honorable and
sporting if not more sensible. I won
der why men, in building up a can
didate, spend millions on stuffing
without considering the quality of
the shirt to be stuffed.
The Miracle Play
I referred to the campaign as a
Miracle Play. There are striking re
semblances. Like an American po
litical campaign, the medieval mir
acle play was highly institutional
ized. It presented, as its leading
characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle
play the devils rendered a real serv
ice by supplying a form of low com"
edy, while in a campaign we manage
to lose our sense of humor and the

devil act is a flop.
In a political campaign we have
our symbols of righteousness and
iniquity and an angel or a saint is
pitted against each devil or imp. It is
old stuff. We like the old. On the
side of righteousness there is the
Constitution. Few understand it,
but it must not be undermined. This
attitude goes back to the days when
John Marshall worked a miracle act
of his own by undermining the Con
stitution and at the same time cloth
ing it with inviolability and the Su
preme Court with omniscience, and
so the Court itself has become a
symbol of salvation.
Then there is Americanism. More
old stuff. The Know-Nothings used
that and it is still used by the know
nothings. Like the poor in scrip
ture, we have the know nothings
with us always. I know because 1
have been in so-called educational
work for many years. We have also
had paraded before us the angelic
symbols of Peace, Liberty, the Flag,
the Home, the School, and the
anced Budget. Saints have been
ushered in, notably Jefferson, Lin
coln, and Theodore the Greatâ€”all of
them a bit devilish in their day. but
no longer capable of deviltry. Good
old Tom. His picture hangs above
my desk and I keep wondering what
he would say about the use of his
name by the Jeffersonian Democrats.
Symbols of Iniquity
Among the symbols of iniquity we
have managed to introduce some
new characters. One is a monstrosity
by the name of Regimentation. An
other is known as Experimentation
in Government. And then there is
that dirty little devil in gown and
mortar board who answers to the
name of Brain Truster, Crack Pot,
or Professor. The imp called Com
munism has been doing double duty,
but Comrade Browder has almost
achieved respectability. The other
symbols of deviltry are not new. The
Dictatorship Act was staged in the
days of Andrew Jackson, Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Woodrow Wilson. Each one of these
saints trod the boards and took his
bow and was garbed in the satanic
vestments of dictatorship.
And now the play is ending. To
morrow we shall go through the
ceremony of rededicating our faith

in vox populi. Regardless of who is
elected, life will go on as before.
We shall continue to wear pants and
pay taxes. We shall go on living to
gether, helping one another, cheating
one another, washing one another's
shirts, and stealing one another's
automobiles.
Blessed with Faith
Fortunately, we do not take cam
paign threats too seriously. At the
movies we enjoy the thrill of mo
mentary fright when the villain still
pursues her, but we have faith in

the traditions of the scenario writer
and we know that in the end the hero
will make an honest woman out of
the heroine. In the heat of a polit
ical campaign we are also blessed
with faith. We may be ill at ease,
but down in our hearts we do not be
lieve that if the opposition is elected
it will mean grass grown streets,
desolated farms, smokeless chim
neys, and worthless insurance poli
cies. If we really believed all that,
the defeated minority would commit
hari kari as soon as the election re
sults came in.
Before my classes I have fre
quently paraphrased John Dewey's
and Matthew Arnold's definition of
education as "the development of a

Since then I have remained an in

heard the melodoius crooning, the

The Miracle Play
I referred to the campaign as a
Miracle Play. There are striking re
semblances. Like an American po
litical campaign, the medieval mir
acle play was highly institutional
ized. It presented, as its leading
characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle
play the devils rendered a real serv
ice by supplying a form of low com"
edy, while in a campaign we manage
to lose our sense of humor and the


"Sorry Coach, the quarterback had to go out and vote."
devil act is a flop.
In a political campaign we have
our symbols of righteousness and
iniquity and an angel or a saint is
pitted against each devil or imp. It is
old stuff. We like the old. On the
side of righteousness there is the
Constitution. Few understand it,
but it must not be undermined. This
attitude goes back to the days when
John Marshall worked a miracle act
of his own by undermining the Con
stitution and at the same time cloth
ing it with inviolability and the Su
preme Court with omniscience, and
so the Court itself has become a
symbol of salvation.
Then there is Americanism. More
old stuff. The Know-Nothings used
that and it is still used by the know
nothings. Like the poor in scrip
ture, we have the know nothings
with us always. I know because 1
have been in so-called educational
work for many years. We have also
had paraded before us the angelic
symbols of Peace, Liberty, the Flag,
the Home, the School, and the
anced Budget. Saints have been
ushered in, notably Jefferson, Lin
coln, and Theodore the Greatâ€”all of
them a bit devilish in their day. but
no longer capable of deviltry. Good
old Tom. His picture hangs above
my desk and I keep wondering what
he would say about the use of his
name by the Jeffersonian Democrats.
Symbols of Iniquity
Among the symbols of iniquity we
have managed to introduce some
new characters. One is a monstrosity
by the name of Regimentation. An
other is known as Experimentation
in Government. And then there is
that dirty little devil in gown and
mortar board who answers to the
name of Brain Truster, Crack Pot,
or Professor. The imp called Com
munism has been doing double duty,
but Comrade Browder has almost
achieved respectability. The other
symbols of deviltry are not new. The
Dictatorship Act was staged in the
days of Andrew Jackson, Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Woodrow Wilson. Each one of these
saints trod the boards and took his
bow and was garbed in the satanic
vestments of dictatorship.
And now the play is ending. To
morrow we shall go through the
ceremony of rededicating our faith

in vox populi. Regardless of who is
elected, life will go on as before.
We shall continue to wear pants and
pay taxes. We shall go on living to

other is known as Experimentation

Fortunately, we do not take cam

the traditions of the scenario writer

will make an honest woman out of
the heroine. In the heat of a polit

with faith. We may be ill at ease,
but down in our hearts we do not be

heard the melodoius crooning, the

The Miracle Play
I referred to the campaign as a
Miracle Play. There are striking re
semblances. Like an American po
litical campaign, the medieval mir
acle play was highly institutional
ized. It presented, as its leading
characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle
play the devils rendered a real serv
ice by supplying a form of low com"
edy, while in a campaign we manage

devil act is a flop.
In a political campaign we have
our symbols of righteousness and
iniquity and an angel or a saint is
pitted against each devil or imp. It is
old stuff. We like the old. On the
side of righteousness there is the
Constitution. Few understand it,
but it must not be undermined. This
attitude goes back to the days when
John Marshall worked a miracle act
of his own by undermining the Con
stitution and at the same time cloth
ing it with inviolability and the Su
preme Court with omniscience, and
so the Court itself has become a
symbol of salvation.
Then there is Americanism. More
old stuff. The Know-Nothings used
that and it is still used by the know

characters, God the Father on the
one side and the Evil One on the
other. It offered gradations of saints
and devils and degrees of godliness
and deviltry. The "rage of Herod '
was heard in the streets. And the
play was symbolic.
But there are differences. In the
miracle play the entire audience dis
tinguished between God and the Evil
One and could applaud and boo in
unison. In a campaign on the other
hand, the forces of righteousness and
iniquity depend on which side you
happen to be. Also Vn the miracle

"Sorry Coach, the quarterback had to go out and vote."
devil act is a flop.
In a political campaign we have
our symbols of righteousness and
iniquity and an angel or a saint is
pitted against each devil or imp. It is
old stuff. We like the old. On the
side of righteousness there is the
Constitution. Few understand it,
but it must not be undermined. This
attitude goes back to the days when
John Marshall worked a miracle act
of his own by undermining the Con
stitution and at the same time cloth
ing it with inviolability and the Su
preme Court with omniscience, and
so the Court itself has become a
symbol of salvation.
Then there is Americanism. More
old stuff. The Know-Nothings used
that and it is still used by the know
nothings. Like the poor in scrip
ture, we have the know nothings
with us always. I know because 1
have been in so-called educational
work for many years. We have also
had paraded before us the angelic
symbols of Peace, Liberty, the Flag,
the Home, the School, and the
anced Budget. Saints have been
ushered in, notably Jefferson, Lin
coln, and Theodore the Greatâ€”all of
them a bit devilish in their day. but
no longer capable of deviltry. Good
old Tom. His picture hangs above
my desk and I keep wondering what
he would say about the use of his
name by the Jeffersonian Democrats.
Symbols of Iniquity
Among the symbols of iniquity we
have managed to introduce some
new characters. One is a monstrosity
by the name of Regimentation. An
other is known as Experimentation
in Government. And then there is
that dirty little devil in gown and
mortar board who answers to the
name of Brain Truster, Crack Pot,
or Professor. The imp called Com
munism has been doing double duty,
but Comrade Browder has almost
achieved respectability. The other
symbols of deviltry are not new. The
Dictatorship Act was staged in the
days of Andrew Jackson, Abraham
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Woodrow Wilson. Each one of these
saints trod the boards and took his
bow and was garbed in the satanic
vestments of dictatorship.
And now the play is ending. To
morrow we shall go through the
ceremony of rededicating our faith

in vox populi. Regardless of who is
elected, life will go on as before.
We shall continue to wear pants and
pay taxes. We shall go on living to
gether, helping one another, cheating
one another, washing one another's
shirts, and stealing one another's
automobiles.
Blessed with Faith
Fortunately, we do not take cam
paign threats too seriously. At the
movies we enjoy the thrill of mo
mentary fright when the villain still
pursues her, but we have faith in

the traditions of the scenario writer
and we know that in the end the hero
will make an honest woman out of
the heroine. In the heat of a polit
ical campaign we are also blessed
with faith. We may be ill at ease,
but down in our hearts we do not be
lieve that if the opposition is elected
it will mean grass grown streets,
desolated farms, smokeless chim
neys, and worthless insurance poli
cies. If we really believed all that,
the defeated minority would commit
hari kari as soon as the election re
sults came in.
Before my classes I have fre
quently paraphrased John Dewey's
and Matthew Arnold's definition of
education as "the development of a
discriminating intelligence which

will serve as a bulwark against the
invasion of bunk." The educated
should be able to distinguish be
tween the conspicuous and the im
portant. Political campaigns are
conspicuous, but their importance is
relative. History will probably prove
that the movement now under way
in American labor organizations is
far more important than the outcome
of the presidential election. The so
cial effects of a mechanical cotton
picker is more far-reaching than any
political victory in the cotton belt.
At this very moment, some obscure
scientist, tinkering with his test
tubes in a Stanford lab, may be shap
ing tomorrow's triumph or despair.
Who knows?
Bellows and Ballots
Our social relationships are shaped
by our means of production and not
by bellowing and balloting. The
rendezvous with destiny was not
held in a Philadelphia stadium. It is
held daily on our farms and in our
factories, and we. are so constituted
that we will attempt an honest solu
tion of our problems only when we
are driven by impending necessity.
Is this cynical? Not at all. I love
the line Paul Engle sings, "This is a
hell of a big country, mister." It is
too big to be saved or ruined by the
outcome of this election. Naturally,
I shall express my preference, but
win or lose, I shall not be down
hearted. I still have faith in the old
saw, "God takes care of drunkards,
little children, and the United
States."
