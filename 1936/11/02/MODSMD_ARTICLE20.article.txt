# Indians Scalp Fighting Bruin With Convincing 19-6 Victory
## 
### GENE GEAR 
A courageous band of Stanford
Indians swooped into the Los An
geles Memorial Coliseum Saturday
afternoon to see what could be done
about putting a rampaging Bruin in
his place.
Tiny Thornhill led those fighting
Redskins out of that same arena
several hours later wliile 55,000 spec
tators stared wide-eyed at an almost
lifeless Bruin sprawled out on the
turf, three touchdown arrows in his
side.
Underrated Indians
The Redskins were rated as a
fighting, bothersome band of Indians
but they weren't supposed to have
the drive and marksmanship neces
sary to pierce the Bruin hide for the
kill.
They weren't supposed to, but still
they whipped U.C.L.A. to the tune of
19-6, thereby erasing last year's ig
nominious 7-6 defeat in the eyes of
even the most sceptic followers of the
Big Red Machine.
Captain Earl Hoos, calling the sig
nals, wanted to strike early, and
strike early the Cards did. The
Bruins, receiving the kick-off,
couldn't do much with the pigskin so
they elected to kick from their own
32. Big Pete Zagar, who does a good
deal of his playing in the enemy
backfield, broke through to block
Funk's kick, and Jack Clark fell on
the ball on the Bruin IS.
A first down pass was intercepted
by Billy Williams on the 10-yard

stripe. This time Funk got his kick
away, but little Jimmy Coffis ran it
back to the Uclan 31. Messrs. Cal
velli. Coffis, and Williams pounded
through to the five-yard line, and on
the fourth down those five yards
looked pretty darn far.
Calvelli faded back, looking for
receivers who just weren't there.
Giving this up as hopeless, Tony
streaked to the right, just squeezing
into the corner for the score. Bob
Matthews converted, and the Cards
held on to that pi'ecious 7-0 lead for
the remainder of the first half.
Bill Spaulding's Bruins came back
with a vengeance in the third quar
ter. driving down to the Stanford IG,
where a fourth down pass from Izzv
Cantor to Charlie Pike connected
for G points.
Bruins Score Once
But the battling, scarred Bruin had
to be content with that one clawing
into the stalwart band of Redskins.
In the fourth quarter, Tiny's never
tiring warriors, displaying an offense
they have lacked all season, drove 73
yards down the field, with Jake
Brighani supplying the spark. The
drive culminated with a rifle pass
from Brigham to Clark, who fought
his way from the four-yard line to
score.
Stanford's third venture into pay
dirt came a little later when Coffis
broke up U.C.L.A.'s tricky reverse
pass and wheeled 58 yards down the
sideline into the end zone.

His expenses totaling but $200,
Miller Outcalt, University of Cincin
nati law student, toured through
England, Ireland, Scotland, and
Wales this summer. He traveled by
bicycle and lodged at Youth Hostels
throughout the English countryside.
