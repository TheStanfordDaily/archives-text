# The 						Union Puts Up Its Front
## 
### 
1"N last Monday's tabloid, the A.S.U.
found itself the helpless butt of
Editor Jorgensen's whimsy. After
separating the humor from the rea
son, the main issue against us seems
to be that when all the hue and cry
concerning a united front against
Fascism is permeating political cir
cles, our little Stanford chapter of the
A.S.U.. alas, finds itself neither unit
ed nor a front.
Such an accusation reveals an
alarming misinterpretation of the
historical role of the A.S.U. A united
front, translated into popular lingo,
means a program of action, not a
round table symposium in which all
the brain-wrackers get together and
attempt to convert each other into
his own particular ultimate solution
lo the economic problem. This, inci
dentally, is precisely what has been
going on ever since political philoso
phy became the thing the best brains
were wearing.
The United Front
Such an approach has done noth
ing but widen Ihe breach between
those seriously bent upon progres
sive political action while the reac
tionary yokels have remained in the
saddle and taken advantage of the
internal dissensions of the Left
Wing. Hence a united front cannot
be a front of individuals totally in
agreement as to ultimates. Such a
front would be, truly, no front at all
but only a minority political sect
without sufficient driving power to
pound sand in a rat-hole. Hence, a
.inited front, if it is to be ready for
action, must be based on something
else.
To elucidate more clearly, let us
ake Editor Jorgensen as Exhibit A.
Jorgi is no Communist. Jorgi is even
ess of a socialist. And to accuse him
of static Republicanism. Democrat
sm (or any other ism) would,
Joubtlt ssly, not flatter him. Jorgi is

an individualist. In short — a good!
healthy liberal. Now .as a liberal, j
Jorgi may pafely subscribe to the ]
platform of the A.S.U. (If he would!
take the trouble to find out that it
really had a platform. There seemed
to be slight doubts on this score in
last week's column.)
The Platform
Platform, to-wit: (!) For world
peace. (2) For greater educational
opportunities for all young people.
(3) Maintenance of academic free
dom for student body, faculty and
Daily editors. (4) Opposition to all
forms of racial discrimination. Be
yond these planks Jorgi may not care |
to go. So the A.S.U. doesn't go any !
further either. You see, it is just an j
old-fashioned arithmetical formula—
find the least common denominator j
and then you get the answer. The !
platform of the A.S.U.. in a word. I
resolves itself down to the least i
common denominator of enlight
ened student opinion.
It aims to become a mass organi
zation geared for action. It does not
intend to fall into the class of or
ganization prevalent in those halcyon
days of <he Henckenites, the esoteric 1
cliques of bankrupt intelligentsia
forever standing completely out of!
touch witfr the rest of the student
body and astounding themselves with ;
their own pungent brilliance.
The Labor Movement
Since these glorious days of lotus
gathering under the pre-Hoover re
gime .the progressive student wing
has found new allies in the primary
driving force for world peace — the 1
labor movement. Working men and !
young people bore the brunt of the
hist war. They are the ones who will
be expected to bear such brunt
again. It is. consequently, urgent
that these two forces act together as
a homogeneous body impelling the

small reactionary element who are
able to glut themselevs with the
pl'oftis of international conflict to re
frain from plunging us, once again,
into the trenches.
The A.S.U. has not only a dream
child around which to recruit mem
bership. It can look back concretely
to last April 22nd when three-quar
ter of a million students gave voice
to the resentment against the war
machine by a nation-wide, one-hour
strike for peace. Next year this
number should swell to over a mil
lion. The A.S.U. can look upon the
successful results of its joint-action
with the American Youth Congress
in accomplishing the renewal of the
NYA when the administration had
decided to toss the entire system of
student relief onto the trash-heap.
Other, no less brilliant, work has
been done on individual campuses.
The bonds of unity are crystallizing.
It is only for the rest of the here
tofore inert mass of progressive
opinion to get shoulder to shoulder
with the A.S.U. and victory will be
assured.
Stanford Chapter
American Student Union
In "Time," the weekly newsmaga
zine whose slogan is "Curt, Clear,
Complete," appeared the following
item last Friday
"Night before Southern Califor
nia's football team beat theirs, 14 to
7, 300 exuberant Stanford youths
smashed the doors of a theater, did
$300 damage inside, were prevented
by police with tear gas from break -
ing into Roble Hall, girl's dormitory,
to climax their annual 'pajamarino
riot."
