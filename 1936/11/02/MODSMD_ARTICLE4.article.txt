jDALY cops and police judges were
eager to protect private proper
ty when Pajamarino frosh wanted to
see a free show. As Sinners Thallon
and Kittell stood before the bar of
judicial dignity and contemplation,
the judge showed them what arrant
knaves they were to attempt to in
vade the sanctity of the theater.
Sheepishly Thallon and Kittell ad
mitted that.
But it seems that Paly has a
double standard of morality in re
gard lo private property. When the
private property belongs to a wealthy
theater chain, that's one thing, but
when private property means a
dusty, barren store, which contains
two desks, and has for decoration
only the signs "All-party Progres
sives," and "Lund for Assembly,"
that's another one altogether.
Paly Red-Baifer
Coming up for trial in Paly courts
this week, God and Palo Alto will
' ing, is a Mrs. Marjorie Steevns. Paly
I red-baiter and wife of a prominent
! building and loan official. Mrs. Stev-
I ens is accused of breaking into the
all-party store and attempting to
i make ofT with records. However, it
took the Progressives a whole week
Ito get a warrant sworn out against
! Mrs. Stevens, and they had to go

over the heads of two Paly judges
and get an order for a warrant from
the district attorney before they
could have her arrested.
In her own earnest fashion. Mrs.
Stevens believes that she is doing
her duty to the commonwealth by
exposing "Communistic activity,"
among Paly's hot-house liberals and
Stanford's few plain-speaking pro
fessors. Nobody knows who Mrs
Stevens works for, but Paly's sus
picion is that it is not Hearst, but
Col. Sanborn's eagle-screaming San
Rafael "American Citizen."
Palo Alfo Communism
The "American Citizen" has a sec
tion of Palo Alto notes, and a recent
issue came out with a blanket in
dictment of Palo Alto Communism
which started with Landonite editor
of the Paly Times, Dallas E. Wood,
the Presbyterian, minister, Oscar
Green, and went on down.
Mrs. Stevens' activities include a
great deal of keyhole-peeping, and
current gag at the various leagues
against this and that Ls to quickly
open the door. Everyone laughs and
slaps his thighs when Mrs. Stevens
falls into the room flat on her face.
Her roving eye recently fell on the
All-party Progressive headquarters
down on Emerson Street. Though
with a distinct liberal tinge (or
twinge), the Progressives do have a
certain number of Republicans and
Democrats.
Parfy-Party Party
The genesis of the Party-Party
Party came when Dewey Anderson,
registered Republican and incum
bent assemblyman from this district
decided not to stand for re-election.
Anderson was a Progressive—several
jumps ahead of Chester Rowellian
progressivism. Two liberals decided
to carry on the Anderson torch. As
a result, they split the vote and
Adron Beene, a pre-war. Liberty
League Republican, and a Prohibi
tionist and Inhibitionist, got both
Democratic and Republican nomina
tions. This was so repulsive to An
dervonian progressives that he and
others beat the drums among the
Republican and Democratic liberals
and threw their support to Tielfa
Lund. Socialist nominee. Lund wasn't
