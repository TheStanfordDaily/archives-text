# Farm Rushing
## 
### GORDY FROST 
YY r HILE 15 carloads of Farm popu
lation cavorted in the Los An
geles Biltmore, Beverly Wilshire,
and Ambassador Hotels this week
end—and, in the Coliseum for a
few hours, Stanford's current rush
ing battle paused for a breather.
And in between breaths came new
judgments of Interfraternity Coun
cil's double-revised rushing system.
Comment that apparently was
strongly against the set-up two
weeks ago was swinging around,
and where Row bigwigs screamed
"lousy," mild murmurings of "not so
bad" were audible. In fact, from
some dark corners of the critical
Row, bits of guarded praise crept
forth.
Facing the Facts
Time seems to have tempered the
new system. With a good week of
griping out of the way, to which In
terfraternity Council paid little heed,
dwellers up on the Row have settled
down to face the facts.
And the facts seem to be that, de
spite early opposition, the new set
up permits the exercise of ingenuity
to replace the ancient doctrine of
high pressure.
Too, most houses have their classes
doped out by this time. In some
houses half dozen or more frosh
are already wearing the brass—and
as such, former rushees have turned
to rushers. All of which is a load
off the brothers who found those 12
o'clock periods a strain on convei"sa
tional sources.
Pledging Over Par
And speaking of the bi'ass. Usual
reports have filtered through that
the usual house pledged the usual
two over par, and is unusually wor
ried as usual.
On the frosh front two schools of
thought seem to be appearing. Class
number one is the fellow who "likes
us," and sits around rushing the
rushers until the evening's festivities
are ovei\ This guy makes friends
easily, already knew some of the
brothers, and has three uncles who
were under that particular bond
years ago. He probably knows more
about the house than do his enter
tainers.
Number two is bored, figures he
can't leave before the time's up,
would "a darn sight rather be at the
show with Encinaroomate Joe," to
use one man's words.
Free and Easy
Problem of the Row seems to be
in handling No. 2, making conversa
tions into bull sessions, having it
understood that men can come and
go as they please, that ties and coats
call come off without fear of the
"bong."
Thus with no flagrant cases of il
legal rushing on the records, or off
the records, and outstanding gripes
softened to whispers, Stanford's
rushing system "to end all searches
for new rushing systems," goes into
its third round, next Friday night.
