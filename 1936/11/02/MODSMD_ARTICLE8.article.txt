# We Dated Peggy Ann
## 
### 
(On the Stanford campus is the
Kansas contingent, typical students
from the "typical prairie state." Two
of these men have dated Peggy Anne
Landon, a former Stanfordite now in
Kansas has also. From their stories
this composite was made.)
r dance hall burned down last
summer, so that leaves only the
movies, campus dances, and picnics
out on the Kaw River to interest
Topeka daters. Peggy was away all
this summer, so we didn't see her
very much, but a year ago we went
out pretty frequently.
No Difficulties
Dating with the governor's daugh
ter in Kansas entails no special dif
ficulties except that a state trooper
meets you when you knock at the
door, escorts you into the high
ceilinged living room of that anti
quated architectural monstrosity, the
governor's mansion. He takes your
name up to Peggy and returns to toll
you she'll be right down, but, as
with Stanford Pi Phis, you'll have to
wait.
Peggy Anne is no raving beauty,
but she's passably good-looking. We
can state that she's a darn good
dancer as are all K.U. women, bar
none. The standard of the midwest
U.'s insofar as dancing is concerned is
head and shoulders above the west
ern standards—at least compared to
Stanford.
Yes—She Smokes
Peggy Anne smokes but doesn't
drink. A lot of mid-west women
don't either. She doesn't bum cig
arettes off of you on a date but
brings her own. As far as we've been
able to ascertain she doesn't neck.
Like many Stanford women, she
doesn't know or care anything about
politics; and doesn't carry on a very
deep conversation. She studies to
get by. but doesn't particularly care
for books.

Unlike many of her Pi Phi sorority
sisters she doesn't have a car to
drive to school, but like her sorority
sisters she has to make up her bed
every morning.
As her father i.s the average Amer
ican Babbitt, she is the average
American school girl. Nothing flashy
or startling, just a quiet, unobtru
sive co-ed.
We don't think she would be a Pi
Phi at Stanford .

(On the Stanford campus is the
Kansas contingent, typical students
from the "typical prairie state." Two
of these men have dated Peggy Anne
Landon, a former Stanfordite now in
Kansas has also. From their stories
this composite was made.)
r dance hall burned down last
summer, so that leaves only the
movies, campus dances, and picnics
out on the Kaw River to interest
Topeka daters. Peggy was away all
this summer, so we didn't see her
very much, but a year ago we went
out pretty frequently.
No Difficulties
Dating with the governor's daugh
ter in Kansas entails no special dif
ficulties except that a state trooper
meets you when you knock at the
door, escorts you into the high
ceilinged living room of that anti
quated architectural monstrosity, the
governor's mansion. He takes your
name up to Peggy and returns to toll
you she'll be right down, but, as
with Stanford Pi Phis, you'll have to
wait.
Peggy Anne is no raving beauty,
but she's passably good-looking. We
can state that she's a darn good
dancer as are all K.U. women, bar
none. The standard of the midwest
U.'s insofar as dancing is concerned is
head and shoulders above the west
ern standards—at least compared to
Stanford.
Yes—She Smokes
Peggy Anne smokes but doesn't
drink. A lot of mid-west women
don't either. She doesn't bum cig
arettes off of you on a date but
brings her own. As far as we've been
able to ascertain she doesn't neck.
Like many Stanford women, she
doesn't know or care anything about
politics; and doesn't carry on a very
deep conversation. She studies to
get by. but doesn't particularly care
for books.

Unlike many of her Pi Phi sorority
sisters she doesn't have a car to
drive to school, but like her sorority
sisters she has to make up her bed
every morning.
As her father i.s the average Amer
ican Babbitt, she is the average
American school girl. Nothing flashy
or startling, just a quiet, unobtru
sive co-ed.
We don't think she would be a Pi
Phi at Stanford .
You can change anything if you do
not change its name. Call Commun

you'll cet somewhere. LaPicre
