Judgment is based on a standard
of one couple per five to six square

all evening and the total number of
first-night Nitery couples was prob

never misses a good thing, was there
in full force with his bazooka and an

no obstacle which might prevent the
success of this experiment." Doodles
then went about his business of lead
ing yells between numbers.
Removal of Office Partifsons
Jeeb Halaby, Cardinal committee
man responsible for the success this
dance developed into, together with
committee women Kuth Goodan and
Betty Grover, said, '"Saturday night's
showing indicates great enthusiasm
for a campus night club. Plans arc
being worked out for a permanent
place. It will be better organized
next time."
These plans, confided Halaby,
specify the '"removal of office parti
tions in the A.S.S.U. lobby and en
larging the place to its full size. The
lobby was at one time the Union
smoker. It's smooth hardwood floor,
generous dimensions, large fireplaces,
convenience to Union Court, and
proximity to the campus render it
the logical place for nightly dances.
"Tremendous! Stupendous! Co
lossal!" exclaimed Betty Grover,
watching eager couples toasting
marshmallows, dancing to the phon

ograph recording of "Frankie and
Johnnie," and stuffing cornstalks
down each other's backs. "I didn't
know the campus had it in it," she*
added. "Here's for more and belter
ones—particularly with more room.'
To Ruth Gooda'i, it seemed appar
ent from the number of eager
couples "that the future nitery will
be received with even greater ap
proval."
Jolly-up Failing
Commenting on the practical pos
sibilities of the venture, ex-student
body president Wally Brooke said:
"The jolly-up as the 'get-acquainted'
device at Stanford fails to givp the
campus complete satisfaction nowa
days. The Union Board of Governors
can and probably will fix over the
Union lobby and perhaps build an
annex for a campus dance spot. More
solidified student demands will help."
Originally, among other sugges-

tio/is had been that of dancing on
the level of the cellar and maga
zine stand. Although this was not
done, the fountain reported an ap
pi eciable increase of sales over pre
vious Saturdays. These were mostly
5-cent cokes and ades, which fact
further indicates the informality of
(he Nitery. The large round moon,
which apparently had gone south
for the game the day before, ap
peared as advertised, aided ind
abetted by sundry stars and silver
lined clouds. However, the air was
somewhat too chill for protracted
use of Union Court, the Inner Quad,
and Lagunita.
Repeat Performance
Cardinals plan to repeat the func
tion next week, and if enthusiasm
has not subsided, to arrange for
nightly dances. Although the golf
comse clubhouse as a permanent
night spot is not out, Halaby ex
plained that the tile floor is not en
tirely satisfactory for dancing.
Further, i( would be necessary to
break in several new soda clerks,
clean up the place between midnight
and <> a.m., and placate the caretaker
who makes the building his home.
Whereas these obstacles are sur
mountable, they complicate the issue
and throw a better light on the en
larged Union lobby.
