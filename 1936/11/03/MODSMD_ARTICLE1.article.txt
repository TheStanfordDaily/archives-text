# Husky Squad Blocks Path Of Tiny's Big Red Machine
## Saturday's Starters Yet Undecided; Calvelli's Eye Ready for Game 
### HERB DIAMOND 
"Those Huskies are going to be
tough this Saturday—a lot tougher
than they were in beating Oregon
7-0 a couple of days ago. But if we
improve as much this week as we
did last week, we'll have a fine
chance to break their winning
streak."
That's the way Tiny Thornhill now
looks at the situation, and he gives
some pretty sound reasons for this
bit of opining. He agrees that his
Indians have been gaining confidence
right along, and now that they've
cracked through with a major upset,
their spirit should be in prime con
dition this week-end.
Calvelli To Play
The Bruin fray brought to light
such overdue individual talent as
that of Jake Brigham and Tony Cal
velli. They may have both been in
spired Saturday, but if they can get
that way in each of the four tilts
remaining on the schedule they will
indeed continue to be a pair of
deadly Indian arrows.
Fears that Calvelli may have suf
fered a serious eye injury were
dispelled yesterday when Dr. Blake
Wilbur, acting team physician, an
nounced Tony's only hurt as a small
cut in the optic. If no infection sets
in, and there is no reason why it
should, he should be in good fettle
for Saturday's grid festivitives. He
was pitching with high accuracy
in practice last night, in spite of the
bum lamp.
Husky Veterans
Tiny is perplexed when it comes
to picking starters to meet Jimmy
Phelan's boys. Both Brigham and
Calvelli are well fitted to perform
anv and all fullhack duties. And will
it be Joe Vigna or Freddy Williams
at right half?
Tiny isn't sure yet, but he does
know this: Washington has no less
than nine veterans, tried and true,
who are being groomed right now for
110 other team but Stanford.
Many of these Seattle-ites — or
rather full-fledged stars —were put
on the shelf last week-end and those
that weren t out of the Oregon
game, stayed in for relatively short
intervals. Such greats as Chuck
Bond, Jim Cain, By Haines, Elmer
Logg, Jack McKenzie, Mitchell Mon
dala, Ed Nowogroski, Max Starce
vich, and John Wiatrak are included
in the group.
Thornhill Optimistic
For the past two years they've
been keeping the Huskies rating in
the Coast conference right up at the
top, and, according to reports, they
stand ready to do some convincing
arguing about who will take honors
on the Farm Saturday.
But Thornhill, however, is far from
pessimistic. He has faith in the
squad that just now is beginning to
exhibit some of the prowess he's
been building in it for the past month
or so. As it stands now, the Huskies
will need every bit of talent they've
shown this season; with a little im
provement in the Cardinals, the Hus
kies will need even more than that.
