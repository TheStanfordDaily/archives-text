# Faculty Sees Roosevelt Win As Polls Open
## Conservative Comments Made by Cautious Stanford Professors 
### 
Fearing (hat they would be in
criminating themselves, most of the
Stanford professors questioned on
their opinions as to the outcome of
the election, gave very conservative
answers. Of those who made a pre
diction, all were of the thought thai
the President would keep his job.
Among those who commented are:
Charles David Marx, emeritus
professor of civil engineering: "I
think that the incumbent President
will be elected."
Edward Maslin Hulme, of the his
tory department "Roosevelt's going
to be elected by an enormous ma
jority."
Edwin A. Cottrell, political science
professor: "My only estimate is that
it is very close on either side."
Philip W. Buck, assistant professor
in the political science department:
"I'm not in the business of prediction.
No polished professor dares to pre
dict."
Richard T. LaPierc, assistant pro
fessor of economics: "I haven't any
money to get on it, so I am quite
indifferent."
David Harris, associate professor
of history, says: "I think that Roose
velt will win."
Another prediction of a Roosevelt
win comes from the history depart
ment. Professor Max Savclle says:
"I think Roosevelt is going to win."
Bcrton J. Ballard, instructor in
Journalism, says: "Roosevelt's going
to win, there is no way to escape it.
The important thing is what the elec
tion is going to mean after it is won.
If the Republicans have left the or
dinary liberal in such a state that
he has no choice, which I think they
have done in their campaigning, the
election will have no meaning."
Professor Earl C. Thomas, associate
professor of civil engineering, merely
says: "Anybody else's guess is as
good as mine."
However, the general opinion was
that today's election is not primarily
political, but emotional.
