# ALF M. LANDON
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Peggy Anne Landon may or may
not be making her bed in the Pi Phi
house today. Theo Cobb Landon
may or may not be strumming her
harp today. But there's little doubt
that Alfred Mossman Landon, home
townish and horse-and-buggyish as
he may be, will be sitting on the edge
of his executive chair tonight with
his radio tuned to "Latest election
returns report neavy landslides
for . . .
Alf Landon has said as 'much, or
as little, as any candidate could. His
followers are convinced that Amer
ica will be saved by.today's voting.
His opponents are convinced, too,
that America will be savedâ€”but not
by Landon. At any rate, Alf Lan
don's fate is sealed.
Those of us who vote for Landon
today know by this time pretty much
what we'll get if our votes have any
effect. The Kansas governor Ls not
essentially a politician. He is, if his
entire antics these past few months
were at all valid, a plain, honest,
sincere Middle Westerner whom Re
publicans are booming for President
because they couldn't find anyone
else.
Hearst and Last for Alf
Before 1931 he was an oil man.
Govei nor>'hip of Kansas has been his
first taste of politics. A year ago
William Randolph Hearst had made

up his mind that Roosevelt was a
traitor, so, with Kansas' budget al
most balanced, his glance hit Lundon.
From that time until this, Landon
has become more and more in the
public spotlight.
Frugality Watchword
As millions of "X's" are marked
after his name from coast to coast
today, as many reasons for the Lan
don choice will run through voters'
minds.
First and foremost is his frugality.
Economy has always been Landon's
watchword, both personally and
To a nation full of
Americans frightened by Roosevelt's
spend-now-and-pay-later programs,
Republicans hope to have "sold"
Landon's pay-as-you-go conscience.
Fiscally, there is not much differ
ence between the campaign promises
of Landon and those of the President.
Landon stands for continuance of
agricultural payments, continuance
of relief, continuance of strengthen
ing of the social security program.
He will, though, doubtless cut down
the federal budget some, will change
the Administration's policy of re
ciprocal trade agreements.
American Free for Americans
Most of Landon's votes today will
come from an electorate who be
lieves he stands for a philosophy of
government entirely opposite from
that of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
