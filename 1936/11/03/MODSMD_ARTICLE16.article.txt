# Nitery Gains Masters' OK, Prexy Avers
## Golf Clubhouse Is Open With B.A.C. Sanction, Jim Reynolds Says 
### DAVE LEFF 
That Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters definitely refused use of the golf
course clubhouse for Saturday's
Nitery was denied yesterday by stu
dent Body President Jim Reynolds,
who spoke with Masters down south.
Masters later reassured the Daily
that barring B.A.C. objections the
links clubhouse will be entirely
available for the night spot if stu
dents still want one, and provided
they assume responsibility for keep
ing the place in order.
Refuting the charge that he had
denied this permission Thursday,
Masters explained that he expected
the student manager to call on him
Wednesday for approval of the Nit
ery and that as he failed to appear,
he left for the south that evening.
Board of Governors To Aid
Meanwhile, the A.S.S.U. lobby,
Women's Clubhouse, and old Roble
gym present alternate possibilities
for a casual dance spot.
One hundred per cent co-operation
with student plans was promised by
Union Board of Governors, follow
ing the success of Saturday's affair.
This implies remoyal of the glass
partitions which so cramped the
Hallowe'en crowd, if the lobby is
chosen permanently.
The Women's Clubhouse, or the
$25,000 annex proposed by Comp
troller Roth are other locations in
the Union unit.
Alterations Necessary
If students desire a spot simple,
rustic, spacious, and capable of
adornment, the old Roble gym is at
their disposal. Thii» building, al
though it suffers from a bad reputa
tion by comparison with the new
gymnasium, is ideally located with
respect to scenery and convenience,
an 3 would require little alteration.
The entire matter comes up before
Ex Committee this evening for dis
cussion. The Nitery, however, re
mains a Cardinal project. Jim Rey
nolds. who invites interested parties
to air inspirations at the session to
night, states: "I believe this Nitery
should be centrally Jocated so as to
allow the greatest amount of student
participation."
Following Ex Committee consider
ation of the matter, Cardinals tomor
row will arrange for the second ex
perimental Nitery, which, if it re
ceives the same reception accorded
the Hallowe'en axair, will presage a
permanent nightly institution.

Board of Governors To Aid
Meanwhile, the A.S.S.U. lobby,
Women's Clubhouse, and old Roble
gym present alternate possibilities
for a casual dance spot.
One hundred per cent co-operation
with student plans was promised by
Union Board of Governors, follow
ing the success of Saturday's affair.
This implies remoyal of the glass
partitions which so cramped the
Hallowe'en crowd, if the lobby is
chosen permanently.
The Women's Clubhouse, or the
$25,000 annex proposed by Comp
troller Roth are other locations in
the Union unit.
Alterations Necessary
If students desire a spot simple,
rustic, spacious, and capable of
adornment, the old Roble gym is at
their disposal. Thii» building, al
though it suffers from a bad reputa
tion by comparison with the new
gymnasium, is ideally located with
respect to scenery and convenience,
an 3 would require little alteration.
The entire matter comes up before
Ex Committee this evening for dis
cussion. The Nitery, however, re
mains a Cardinal project. Jim Rey
nolds. who invites interested parties
to air inspirations at the session to
night, states: "I believe this Nitery
should be centrally Jocated so as to
allow the greatest amount of student
participation."
Following Ex Committee consider
ation of the matter, Cardinals tomor
row will arrange for the second ex
perimental Nitery, which, if it re
ceives the same reception accorded
the Hallowe'en axair, will presage a
permanent nightly institution.
That Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters definitely refused use of the golf
course clubhouse for Saturday's
Nitery was denied yesterday by stu
dent Body President Jim Reynolds,
who spoke with Masters down south.
Masters later reassured the Daily
that barring B.A.C. objections the
links clubhouse will be entirely
available for the night spot if stu
dents still want one, and provided
they assume responsibility for keep
ing the place in order.
Refuting the charge that he had
denied this permission Thursday,
Masters explained that he expected
the student manager to call on him
Wednesday for approval of the Nit
ery and that as he failed to appear,
he left for the south that evening.
