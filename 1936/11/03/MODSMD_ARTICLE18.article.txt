WHOSE MONEY ARE YOU?
This guy Klaubcr wants me to
come out flat on the election. As he
says, he doesn't want me to blurb
around about how the Republican
campaign is a stinkeroo and how
Roosevelt has known all the time
where the butter plate is. So that
puts me out leading with my chin.
As for Roosevelt, I don't believe a
word he says. The funniest thing of
the whole campaign was A1 Smith
the other night taking Roosevelt's
palpable tripe about New England
being an integral part of the eco
nomic tradition of the country and
asking what all that meant and then
answering why sure he knew what
it meant —it meant that Boston was
in the United States. When Roose
velt goes up into New England
boasting that he is a descendant of
Sam Adams you can be sure that
when he goes into Texas he will
swear that he is a descendant of Sam
Houston.
* * *
So maybe Roosevelt has saved the
country by putting a golden calf in
every wheelbarrow, but don't tell me
that Landon is the Moses to lead us
out of the wilderness.
Why, that guy Landon is the fog
giest, most unconvincing, and tho
roughly reactionary scarecrow to
come out of the West since the one
horse shay fell apart in a glorious
heap. Where Roosevelt slips in not
being over-honest about what he
ays, Landon bumps along in hope
ess stupidity. He talks high tariff
nd farm relief in the same breath,
/hen all high tariffs have done for
. he farmer is raise foreign tariffs so
) igh that he has got to sell at any
! rice. He talks peace and then puts
■>n an American Legion hat and
: lys that we've gotta stay out of the
\/orld Court, which makes it all the
j.lainer that General Hugh S. John
; m was right when he said that Lan
( in thinks foreign relations are
Cousins Tony and Guiseppe from
Inly.
* * *
The Republicans promise keeping
i p relief with no taxes. Do they
ihink that the Lord and his angels
1 ave at last decided to come to the
aid of the party? And as for all this
talk about governmental waste —
wasn't it Hoover's Postmaster Brown
v'ho bought a new limousine because
l.e couldn't get into the old one
without knocking his silk hat off?
The Republican party has always
? ood for the vested interests of the
< ountry, and the class of the Landon
■ ipport this year is undoubtedly
' oosevelt's greatest asset. Every
Tag-waving, red-baiting, tear-jerk
i lg standpatter has joined in this
1 oly crusade to save America from
the red terror. They offer as the little
lamb to lead them all a man with all
ihe sterling qualifications of our own

As for Roosevelt, I don't believe a
word he says. The funniest thing of
the whole campaign was A1 Smith
the other night taking Roosevelt's
palpable tripe about New England
being an integral part of the eco
nomic tradition of the country and
asking what all that meant and then
answering why sure he knew what
it meant —it meant that Boston was
in the United States. When Roose
velt goes up into New England
boasting that he is a descendant of
Sam Adams you can be sure that
when he goes into Texas he will
swear that he is a descendant of Sam
Houston.
* * *
So maybe Roosevelt has saved the
country by putting a golden calf in
every wheelbarrow, but don't tell me
that Landon is the Moses to lead us
out of the wilderness.
Why, that guy Landon is the fog
giest, most unconvincing, and tho
roughly reactionary scarecrow to
come out of the West since the one
horse shay fell apart in a glorious
heap. Where Roosevelt slips in not
being over-honest about what he
ays, Landon bumps along in hope
ess stupidity. He talks high tariff
nd farm relief in the same breath,
/hen all high tariffs have done for
. he farmer is raise foreign tariffs so
) igh that he has got to sell at any
! rice. He talks peace and then puts
■>n an American Legion hat and
: lys that we've gotta stay out of the
\/orld Court, which makes it all the
j.lainer that General Hugh S. John

The Republicans promise keeping

says, he doesn't want me to blurb
around about how the Republican

puts me out leading with my chin.
