# Liquor Charge Is Postponed By Paly Court
## Evidence Dearth Delays Hearing Two Weeks; Strong Case Expected 
### 
His second hearing having been
postponed from tomorrow morning
until November 16 at 9:30 o'clock,
Frank J. Miller, only last week ac
quitted on a charge of selling intoxi
cating liquor to minors, will face
Justice of the Peace Edward E.
Hardy again in Palo Alto on an iden
tical charge.
Evidence Lacking
Miller, who was freed last Wed
nesday because there was "not suffi
cient evidence for conviction," must
appear with his bartender, Robert
Lowe. It was only after an all-day
session in the first trial that Deputy
District Attorney Chesley Douglas
came to recommend the granting of
a defense motion for a directed ver
dict of acquittal.
Without objection the jury granted
his request. Later Douglas pointed
out that the evidence he was de
pending upon was actually not so
strong as he anticipated, and that a
verdict of guilty would probably not
be upheld in the appellate court,
even in the event he had obtained
such a verdict.
Attorney Confident
He was quick to add, however,
that he considered the case against
Miller in the next hearing to be
much stronger. The evidence will
be more complete than that of last
week, Prosecutor Douglas intimated.
Acting in Miller's defense will be
Attorney A. R. McDougall, who in
the first trial apparently established
the contention that it had not been
shown that an intoxicant was sold
to a minor, that actually an adult
purchased the drink.
