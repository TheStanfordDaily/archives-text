# Second Rushing Cards Out Today
## 
### 
Rushing cards are in the mail to
day for the second complete rushing
period scheduled this Friday and
Saturday.
There are about 2750 cards being
issued for this week-end which will
for the first time see Row men es
corting rushees to a football game as
part of the rushing program. The
Saturday afternoon period from 2
until 6 o'clock will probably see 24
fraternities each with its own par
ticular group of rushees meeting in
the Stanford Stadium.
The Interfraternity Council will
meet tomorrow at the Beta house to
take care of routine business and
perhaps discuss the new rushing sys
tem, according to Bob Hoover, presi
dent of the council.
