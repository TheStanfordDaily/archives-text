# Ex Committee To Decide Nitery Fate
## 
### 
Whether or not Stanford's first
nitery was a success—officially—will
come out when Ex Committee meets
for its weekly session tonight.
Upon the success of Saturday
night's experiment hangs the per
manency of a campus night spot. If
Ex Committee considers it favor
ably, machinery will be put into
action to draw up plans for an es
tablished Stanford night club.
Phil Bernheim will present a sug
gestion to the committee that the
A.S.S.U. officially and financially
help to sponsor nationally the songs
from the Big Game Gaieties.
Social regulations will again be
mulled over—whether Men's and
Women's Councils should send rep
resentatives to all off-campus dances
and whether all campus living
groups are obligated to use B.A.C.
police at their functions.
