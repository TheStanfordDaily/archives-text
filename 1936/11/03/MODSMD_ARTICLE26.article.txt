## Owners May Appeal To Navy for Federal Aid 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 2 (UP). —
Charges of Communist support,
threats of violence and additional
ship tie-ups swept the New York
water front tonight in the outlawed
"rank and file" strike of the Inter
national Seamen's Union, called to
support West Coast strikers.
One hundred and thirteen ships
employing 6,978 men were affected
on the Atlantic seaboard and in Gulf
ports as the insurgent walkout
spread. Trans-Atlantic lines were
drawn into the walkout when the
United tSates iLnes cancelled to
morrow's sailing of the S.S. Manhat
tan.
21 Ships Held Up
Twenty-one ships were tied up in
the metropolitan area when seamen
refused to take out two more vessels.
The Pananja Pacific Line cancelled
the scheduled sailing' of its luxury
liner, the S.S. Virginia, and made
refunds to 525 passengers.
Members of the American Steam
ship Owners Association were in
heated conference tonight discussing
ways of circumventing the strike
which already has cost them thou
sands. An appeal for Federal aid
with the Navy manning the vessels
reportedly was debated.
The strategy committee of the Sea
men's Defense Committee, an in
surgent group of the union headed
by lanky Joseph Curran, met in se
cret session to discuss possible inter
vention of the Navy. Curran said he
feared violence.
Communists Accused
"There will be no holding the men
in line if the ship owners bring in
the Navy and Coast Guard," he said.
"It will be a case of trying to hold
back the men as a matter of pre
serving their own lives.
"I foresee violence and plenty of
it. I charge that the ship owners are
trying to stir up real trouble."
Clarence Angle, secretary of the
union which has declared the strike
unauthorized, accused Communist
agitators of supporting the strike.

trying to stir up real trouble."
