# FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
## 
### JOHN RICE 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, head
man of these United States, is no
longer the fair-haired lad and dar
ling of all that he was shortly after
his election in '32. In fact, the Presi
dent's star has fallen so markedly in
recent months that observers who
once pondered the size of his re
election margin have worked over
time during the last few months try
ing to figure the result of today's
election.
Quick shifts in sentiment are by no
means new to this country, which
swept Herbert Hoover into office
with an unprecedented majority in
1928, only to send him to a stunning
defeat four years later.
Poll-Casts Wrong Before
Nastiest looking sock F.D.R. has
received politically in quite a while
is the Literary Digest poll, which
gives Landon a smashing lead in all
but 16 of the smaller states and a
majority of 376 to 161 in the Electoral
College.
Democratic supporters of the .few
Deal refute these statistics with the
statement, "according to the 1936 Di
gest poll Hoover carried 61 per cent
of the country's popular vote in '32.
This seems ample evidence of the
inaccuracy of the forecast."
A suave politician, an unparal
leled speaker, and an astute states
man arc but a few of the titles be-

stowed on him by enthusiastic ad
mirers.
Incumbent Position Good
Although less popular, experts
stand ready to admit that Mr. Roo
sevelt has today's election rather
well in hand. Chief bases: the in
cumbent is always likely to get the
rail when things are going pretty
well, the opposition apparently
hasn't got what it takes.
Many anti New Dealers will put
X's on the line for F.R. because his
administration has not shown the
niggardliness associated with G.O.P.
Old Republican gripes of commu
nistic and dictatorial tendencies of
the administration are losing their
sting, as William Randolph Hearst
and his boys let off a final wild bar
rage of hints and slurs in an at
tempt to prove a hook-up with the
U.S.S.R.
F.D.R. Will Be Thrifty
If elected it is generally acknowl
edged that Mr. Roosevelt and his
followers will turn from the aggres
sive reforms which have been their
standbys for the last four years. As
was stated by the New York Times
when that paper announced its de
cision to support the President, Roo
sevelt is expected to be more con
servative, and his foreign policy is
indubitably superior to that planned
by Governor Alfred M. Landon.

by Governor Alfred M. Landon.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, head
man of these United States, is no
longer the fair-haired lad and dar
ling of all that he was shortly after
his election in '32. In fact, the Presi
dent's star has fallen so markedly in
recent months that observers who
once pondered the size of his re
election margin have worked over
time during the last few months try
ing to figure the result of today's
election.
Quick shifts in sentiment are by no
means new to this country, which
swept Herbert Hoover into office
with an unprecedented majority in
1928, only to send him to a stunning
defeat four years later.
Poll-Casts Wrong Before
Nastiest looking sock F.D.R. has
received politically in quite a while
is the Literary Digest poll, which
gives Landon a smashing lead in all
but 16 of the smaller states and a
majority of 376 to 161 in the Electoral
College.
Democratic supporters of the .few
Deal refute these statistics with the
statement, "according to the 1936 Di
gest poll Hoover carried 61 per cent
of the country's popular vote in '32.
This seems ample evidence of the
inaccuracy of the forecast."
A suave politician, an unparal
leled speaker, and an astute states
man arc but a few of the titles be-

stowed on him by enthusiastic ad
mirers.
Incumbent Position Good
Although less popular, experts
stand ready to admit that Mr. Roo
sevelt has today's election rather
well in hand. Chief bases: the in
cumbent is always likely to get the
rail when things are going pretty
well, the opposition apparently
hasn't got what it takes.
Many anti New Dealers will put
X's on the line for F.R. because his
administration has not shown the
niggardliness associated with G.O.P.
Old Republican gripes of commu
nistic and dictatorial tendencies of
the administration are losing their
sting, as William Randolph Hearst
and his boys let off a final wild bar
rage of hints and slurs in an at
tempt to prove a hook-up with the
U.S.S.R.
F.D.R. Will Be Thrifty
If elected it is generally acknowl
edged that Mr. Roosevelt and his
followers will turn from the aggres
sive reforms which have been their
standbys for the last four years. As
was stated by the New York Times
when that paper announced its de
cision to support the President, Roo
sevelt is expected to be more con
servative, and his foreign policy is
indubitably superior to that planned
by Governor Alfred M. Landon.
