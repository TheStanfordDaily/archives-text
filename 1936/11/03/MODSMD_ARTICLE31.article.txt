POLITICS, I)RAT IT,
POLITICS

In spite of the fact that we are be
ginning a great big "Wax Washing
tori" campaign today, we are also
finishing another —"Roast Roosevelt"
—and, since as Jorgi said, the latter
may influence our three squares ten
years hence somewhat more than the
former, we will go to bat at the
political diamond this morning for
the first, and last (Thank God) time.
From what little I have gathered
reading the papers over the past few
years, and reading Eisenbach's col
umn for the last few weeks, I come
to the conclusion that there is but
one sane course in front of us —to
take the ball away from the Golden
Voiced Quarterback before he com
pletely throws the game.
Franklin D., as Eisenbach has said,
is a polished gentleman, a splendid
orator. Such things the Republicans
admit. Moreover, I am willing to
concede things they won't admit: he
probably knows where the butter
plate goes, how to wave his smiling
face at the crowds lining the parade
route, and a little bit of French.
However, that seems to be where
his abilities cease, and believe it or
not, our Eneina janitor was a good,
smiling orator, and talked pretty
fair French!

INTRODUCING
BENITO J. ROOSEVELT

..I don't like:
1. The way he ruthlessly threw the
Democratic platform of 1932 to the
winds and went on about his busi
ness as if campaign promises were a
lot of dung to feed the people in ex
change for votes.
2. His literal catering to mass de
mand — setting himself up as the
Great White Savior of a doomed peo
ple. No one denies that we are bet
ter off now than we were in '32. No
one denies that a lot of Roosevelt's
measures seryed as props to busi
ness. And no one denies that de
pressions always have, as well as
downswings, upswings, as a regular
matter of course.
And no one denies that the bank
disaster of March 1932 was due in
large to the fact that after the No
vember electjon business was hog
tied, not knowing which way to turn
because Roosevelt would not com
municate any of his future policies
or assistance to Hoover. And no one
denies that industry is considerably
hogtied today, in a quandary as to
future action because Rooseveltian
guidance has stalemated it on its
upward path.
3. His spending of your money and
mine, not his own, is a sore spot.
I am dead serious when I say I can
picture you and me in 1950." This
little Junior. His share of the na
tional debt is $045.23."
4. His friend "Cueball" Farley is
one of the most ruthless politicians
ever known. In the midst of tend
encies toward an efficient and intel
ligent employment in the Civil Serv
ice he has altered the statutes or dis
regarded them in such a way as to
build up the most powerful, the
most dangerous spoils system the
country has ever seen.
5. He surrounds himself with a
bunch of college professors, the
"long and short boys" the R?pub
licans call them. College professors
are good men on the lecture stand,
but in government, as in industry,
you have to work up through all
stages of the set-up before you can
creditably handle the top job. Roose
velt never worked up through any
thing. He couldn't.
G. He throws the Constitution to
the wind with ease, and then smirks
afterward. "Aw, I knew it was
against the rules all the time, but
maybe the ref wouldn't see it." The
Constitution may be an antiquated
old piece of confetti, but it's done
pretty well for 150 years, and is there
for just this purpose —as a check on
any headstrong guy who might get
hold of the reins.
7. I could go on all day, but I
won't. A vote for Landon is twice
as valuable because it is a vote
against Roosevelt.

P S.: And it'll be a vote to make
his wife dry up and go home.
