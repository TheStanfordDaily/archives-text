# Cards Show Amazing Power, Defense in Defeating U.C.L.A.
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
In that it took 17 hours for The |
Daily's U.C.L.A. yarn to get from
Mills Field to Palu Alto, a lew notes
on the Bruin game are in order.
The fun started on (he fourth play
of the game, when old Renfrew Za
gar slipped off a halfback guarding
Fred Funk's first punt on the Bruin
3G, and proceeded to block it, Jack
Clark recovering on the 17. Eleven
plays later the Cards had fourth and
fifth on the Bruin 5-yard line. The
play was a pass to Stone right over
center, but he was covered, so Cal
velli ran around right end, just
jumping across at the corner. Wy
rick, Bruin tackle, stuck his thumb
in Tony's eye in the last tackle.
Brigham looked the best of any of
the Stanford backs. His passing was
great—3 for 4—harder and much
more accurate than he has yet j
known. And his line bucks were of ;
the best —that off-tackle slant of j
Grayson's from double wing was
particularly effective, giving him his
five yards per play average.
Bruins Show a Bit
The third quarter saw U.C.L.A.
coming back strongly; Walt Schell
and Izzy Cantor made short but
consistent gains through the middle
of the Stanford line, but it took a
deep pass. Cantor to Charley Pike, to
get in close to the 3-yard line. Can
tor immeidately punched it over,
but Cab Callaway got his left eye
in front of the place kick to keep
Stanford in the lead, 7-6.
Next, of course, came another of
those 1936 Stanford riot acts. Vigna
returned the kickoff to the Stanford
27. Joe threw an 'incomplete pass,
then Jake threw to Stone for 21
yards. Then it was Brigham for 12,
Brigham for 2, Brigham incomplete,
Brigham for 11, Coffis for 1, Brig
ham to Stone for 11, Coflis for 3, and
Brigham to Clark for 13. This last
one "Almy" caught on the 2-yard
line, whirled to his left, and stepped
over. Matthews' kick was blocked.
Ten plays, 73 yards, 13-6.
Four plays after this, Coffis got his
—he intercepted Montgomery's deep
pass at full speed on his 40, and
started those little legs straight
ahead. All the way he went, with
Vigna cleaning out Chavoor, the
last man in the way. Jimmy threw
the ball down with glee when he
crossed, as in last year's Big Game.
"I was through with it. I didn't want
it any more," said Jim in the show
ers afterward.
Statistics
Yards gained to Stanford, 192 over
184, with 58 coming from 4 completed
passes out of 6, while the Bruins
made 43 from 3 completed out of 14.
U.C.L.A. led in first downs, 10 to 9,
and had 3 passes intercepted, but
look - Stanford punts averaged 35.8,
to ? .9 for Funk and his supporting
C(
■ eople will be slow to realize what
ll \ victory means, but the fact that
v . L.A. thoroughly trounced Cal
17->J, and were termed by many on

the coast as good Rose Bowl mate
rial, ably paints the picture.
Although the game was a hair
raiser for three quarters, the Cards
deserved their win, and left the field
with the Angelenos and Stanfordites
alike amazed at the offense, defense,
and cool all-around play of a Red
shirt team that wasn't given a prayer.
The rushing of Zagar, Stone, Clark,
the all-around offensive of Brigham,
Calvelli, Coffis, and Vigna, the strat
egy of barkers Hoos and Vigna. the
strength of the center of the Stan
ford line and of fullbacks Tsoutsou
vas and Hoos all combined to over
shadow the touted Bruin clan, and
set the rooting section into a frenzy
of gay spirit and optimism for the
games to come that did not pass off
during the night.
In the Showers
The dressing room afterward was
a joyous place—managers and news
men snorted when the band came up
the walk blaring "Come, Join . . ~"
but Coach Winkleman invited them
in and they blasted up and down the
shower row.
Said Tiny, "Good? Yeh, and
they're going to get better." Said Ed
Hoos, "The Trojans are as good as
these Bruins, but they have Schin
dler. They'll take U.C.L.A."
The Bruin rooters were fine sports
all the way through, and had some
dandy card stunts—one with an In
dian doing a dance of about six dif
ferent positions, and another with
a cleverly shaded "C," where those
forming the letter stood up with
their cards. After the' game they
gave the Axe yell: "Your Axe is
dull, where? Right in the edge."
The Stanford Band-Rooting Sec
tion difficulties seemed to have been
well smoothed out, although in the
press box some asked who was the
limp redcoat standing in front of the
hand.

Patriotism is often an arbitrary
veneration of real estate above prin
ciples.—George Jean Nathan
