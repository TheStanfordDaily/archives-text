# Underdogs Spring Upset Wins In Week End Games
## Wildcats Win on Gopher Fumble; Santa Clara, Unbeaten, Wins Again 
### HARRY PRESS 
'Twas a sad week-end for all those
unbeaten grid teams, because several
so-called "underdogs" decided to be
come kings for the day, which they
did in a great big way.
Biggest headlines went without a
trace of argument to the Minnesota-
Northwestern battle, in which the
Gophers' winning streak df 21
straight was finally broken* by a
snarling band of Wildcats who
proved to be just 6 points tougher
than Bernie Bierman's mighty men.
The break of the game came just
before the end of the third period in
the form of a fumble by the Gophers
on their own 13-yard marker, fol
lowed by a slugging penalty against
Minnesota's co-captain and star
tackle Ed Widseth, which put the
ball in the Wildcats' possession on
their opponents 1-yard stripe. On
the third play, Steve Toth plowed
through for the score. Minnesota
couldn't break through the stubborn
Purple team, and the game ended
just like that, 6-0, the biggest upset
of the year, ending the football su
premacy of the Gophers, temporarily
at least.
Uncle Sam's front line defense
from Annapolis took to the field in a
leaky boat and was immediately
sunk by the Pennsylvania jugger
naut, 16-6. The Army's powerful
tanks hit a barbed wire fence when
Colgate knocked them from the
ranks of the undefeated, 14-7.
Santa Clara, undefeated and un
tied, moved to front and center in the
national gridiron with a 12-0 win
over Auburn, while Washington
State barely eked out a victory over
Cal, 14-13. Washington likewise had
plenty of scares, but came out on
top of Oregon, 7-0.
