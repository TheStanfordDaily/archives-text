# Frosh Watermen Take Paly Hi 14-2
## 
### 
A scrappy bunch of water poloists
from Palo Alto Hi, with nothing
much more than fight in their at
tack, went down before the second
half onslaught of Jack Murietta's
crack frosh septet in Encina Pool
yesterday afternoon.
When the tired aqua warriors
climbed out of the tank at half time
the Indian babes were only hanging
onto a 4-2 lead. A spirited pep talk
during the intermission added the
incentive needed and the frosh ball
tossers chalked up a 14-2 win.
Jack Reade and Bob Savage tied
for high point honors with four goals
apiece, while Bob Plate and Rivers
Narin tallied twice apiece. Jack
Blackburn and Reade played stellar
ball in their forward positions.

The 1930 census places the average
size of a North Carolina family at
4.66 persons.

Quinine can be rendered tasteless
by addition of naphthalene, a sub
stance which by itself is almost as
bad tasting as quinine, scientists say.
