I have watched with amazement the past few
weeks the Republicans' objections to political
ideas expressed in The Daily. Their contention
was that Eisenbach was prostituting the fount of
knowledge at its source by emitting Democratic
propaganda in his column. They screamed at
him for being flippant about vital issues, and
for not rubbing Stanford's traditional prejudices
the right way. The Straw Poll has come out
confirming the supposition that undergraduate
Stanford is predominantly Republican, and I
shall now commit a double sin of not only being
"unrepresentative" of their will, but attempt to
be a little less flippant in my analysis. I hope
the Republicans will understand that I do not
expect to change any votes at this late date, and
that is one reason I'm writing it.
I cannot quite understand the fervor with
which Mr. Eisenbach beats the tom-tom for Roo
sevelt's great reforming zeal. I acknowledge
Roosevelt's grip over the products of unrest and
social injustice, but there is a striking disparity
between his speeches and his performance.
Mr. Roosevelt's principal contribution to reform
may well be that he has crystallized class senti
ment, which will turn to a genuine expression
v/hen it eventually becomes disillusioned.
I don't think Roosevelt has spent nearly
enough, but what he has spent, he hasn't spent
as well as he should.
NRA was not the blue eagle, it was the dodo.
Economically it had not a leg to stand on. Brook
ings has clearly shown that. For an economy of
plenty, AAA is one of the weakest measures
ever enacted, but you mustn't forget that eco
onmically we are not living in an economy of
plenty, and economically, the way to deal with
the Farm problem is to liquidate the Farmers,
and, unfortunately, the Farmer is not the Eco
nomic Man of Adam Smith. Roosevelt's reform
measures in the Coal Industry and Wall Street
pulled their punches. The Corporations Excess
Profits Tax was poorly drawn.
Though he has contributed significantly to
the growth of industrial unionism by his moral
support, his actual support to labor has been
more apparent than real. As far as actual reform
in either economic or political fundamentals
goes, Roosevelt has done little. Roosevelt has
not gone far enough. The issue of the Supreme
Court he has not faced squarely.
As far as economic reform goes, his income
tix measures, his legislation on banks and spec
ulation, his reciprocal trade measures, his de
posit insurance plan, have all chipped at the
periphery of the problem. But as America
climbs up the slope toward another business
orgy, has Roosevelt devised anything either in
central banking, control of business, economic
planning, that will keep us out of another boom
and panic?
Roosevelt has undoubtedly contributed to
international good will by his disavowal of Re
publican Dollar Diplomacy, but his only answer
to international co-operation has been his with
drawal, turtle-like, into his shell. His Big Navy
policy has shown no consistency with any
philosophy and only reflected his Navy back
ground.
He has unquestionably built up, through Far
loy, a political machine, and probably has used
Relief money to do it. But he has not stepped
on the toes of Civil Service any more than his
predecessors. This is not entirely a compli
ment.
As a reformer, as a political scientist and
leader, as a deep and analytical thinker, Roose
velt plainly has been a failure. But Roosevelt's
job has plainly been not to be a reformer or a
political scientist, but to be President. As such,
I think, he has been probably the apotheosis
of the American system.
Roosevelt has done nothing, as I have sug
gested above, about the really important things
tiiat really count. But I ask you, what exactly,
could he have done? He is a representative
of the American people. He holds a political
office. He is not a headman in Plato's republic,
las supreme job is to represent the political
pressures that elect him to office. He is working
within the present system. There is no large
Lody of informed opinion that can intelligently
work out modifications or changes in that sys
tem. As a reformer, Roosevelt has not gone far,
but he has gone farther than the expressed
public opinion would warrant him going. The
Now Deal is intelligent enough to realize that
their measures are haphazard; if you don't think
r,o, read some of Henry Wallace's explanations
of the problems of agriculture, and why it is
impossible to do anything about them.
How about Landon? Would he answer the
criticisms that have been made? No. Landon
is not even aware that these problems exist.
Economically and politically he is illiterate.
From a comparatively simple, middle - class
background, as governor of an agrarian state,
lie still thinks that any boy born in a log cabin

I think, he has been probably the apotheosis
of the American system.
Roosevelt has done nothing, as I have sug
gested above, about the really important things
tiiat really count. But I ask you, what exactly,
could he have done? He is a representative
of the American people. He holds a political
office. He is not a headman in Plato's republic,
las supreme job is to represent the political
pressures that elect him to office. He is working
within the present system. There is no large
Lody of informed opinion that can intelligently
work out modifications or changes in that sys
tem. As a reformer, Roosevelt has not gone far,
but he has gone farther than the expressed
public opinion would warrant him going. The
Now Deal is intelligent enough to realize that
their measures are haphazard; if you don't think
r,o, read some of Henry Wallace's explanations
of the problems of agriculture, and why it is
impossible to do anything about them.
How about Landon? Would he answer the
criticisms that have been made? No. Landon
is not even aware that these problems exist.
Economically and politically he is illiterate.
From a comparatively simple, middle - class
background, as governor of an agrarian state,
lie still thinks that any boy born in a log cabin

ican citizen," when the income of the average
I have watched with amazement the past few
weeks the Republicans' objections to political
ideas expressed in The Daily. Their contention
was that Eisenbach was prostituting the fount of
knowledge at its source by emitting Democratic
propaganda in his column. They screamed at
him for being flippant about vital issues, and
for not rubbing Stanford's traditional prejudices
the right way. The Straw Poll has come out
confirming the supposition that undergraduate
Stanford is predominantly Republican, and I
shall now commit a double sin of not only being
"unrepresentative" of their will, but attempt to
be a little less flippant in my analysis. I hope
the Republicans will understand that I do not
expect to change any votes at this late date, and
that is one reason I'm writing it.
I cannot quite understand the fervor with
which Mr. Eisenbach beats the tom-tom for Roo
sevelt's great reforming zeal. I acknowledge
Roosevelt's grip over the products of unrest and
social injustice, but there is a striking disparity
between his speeches and his performance.
Mr. Roosevelt's principal contribution to reform
may well be that he has crystallized class senti
ment, which will turn to a genuine expression
v/hen it eventually becomes disillusioned.
I don't think Roosevelt has spent nearly
enough, but what he has spent, he hasn't spent
as well as he should.
NRA was not the blue eagle, it was the dodo.
Economically it had not a leg to stand on. Brook
ings has clearly shown that. For an economy of
plenty, AAA is one of the weakest measures
ever enacted, but you mustn't forget that eco
onmically we are not living in an economy of
plenty, and economically, the way to deal with
the Farm problem is to liquidate the Farmers,
and, unfortunately, the Farmer is not the Eco
nomic Man of Adam Smith. Roosevelt's reform
measures in the Coal Industry and Wall Street
pulled their punches. The Corporations Excess
Profits Tax was poorly drawn.
Though he has contributed significantly to
the growth of industrial unionism by his moral
support, his actual support to labor has been
more apparent than real. As far as actual reform
in either economic or political fundamentals
goes, Roosevelt has done little. Roosevelt has
not gone far enough. The issue of the Supreme
Court he has not faced squarely.
As far as economic reform goes, his income
tix measures, his legislation on banks and spec
ulation, his reciprocal trade measures, his de
posit insurance plan, have all chipped at the
periphery of the problem. But as America
climbs up the slope toward another business
orgy, has Roosevelt devised anything either in
central banking, control of business, economic
planning, that will keep us out of another boom
and panic?
Roosevelt has undoubtedly contributed to
international good will by his disavowal of Re
publican Dollar Diplomacy, but his only answer
to international co-operation has been his with
drawal, turtle-like, into his shell. His Big Navy
policy has shown no consistency with any
philosophy and only reflected his Navy back
ground.
He has unquestionably built up, through Far
loy, a political machine, and probably has used
Relief money to do it. But he has not stepped
on the toes of Civil Service any more than his
predecessors. This is not entirely a compli
ment.
As a reformer, as a political scientist and

velt plainly has been a failure. But Roosevelt's

more apparent than real. As far as actual reform
in either economic or political fundamentals
goes, Roosevelt has done little. Roosevelt has
not gone far enough. The issue of the Supreme
Court he has not faced squarely.
As far as economic reform goes, his income
tix measures, his legislation on banks and spec
ulation, his reciprocal trade measures, his de
posit insurance plan, have all chipped at the
periphery of the problem. But as America
climbs up the slope toward another business
orgy, has Roosevelt devised anything either in
central banking, control of business, economic
planning, that will keep us out of another boom
and panic?
Roosevelt has undoubtedly contributed to
international good will by his disavowal of Re
publican Dollar Diplomacy, but his only answer
to international co-operation has been his with
drawal, turtle-like, into his shell. His Big Navy
policy has shown no consistency with any
philosophy and only reflected his Navy back
ground.
He has unquestionably built up, through Far
loy, a political machine, and probably has used
Relief money to do it. But he has not stepped
on the toes of Civil Service any more than his
predecessors. This is not entirely a compli
ment.
As a reformer, as a political scientist and
leader, as a deep and analytical thinker, Roose
velt plainly has been a failure. But Roosevelt's
job has plainly been not to be a reformer or a
political scientist, but to be President. As such,
I think, he has been probably the apotheosis
of the American system.
Roosevelt has done nothing, as I have sug
gested above, about the really important things
tiiat really count. But I ask you, what exactly,
could he have done? He is a representative
of the American people. He holds a political
office. He is not a headman in Plato's republic,
las supreme job is to represent the political
pressures that elect him to office. He is working
within the present system. There is no large
Lody of informed opinion that can intelligently
work out modifications or changes in that sys
tem. As a reformer, Roosevelt has not gone far,
but he has gone farther than the expressed
public opinion would warrant him going. The
Now Deal is intelligent enough to realize that
their measures are haphazard; if you don't think
r,o, read some of Henry Wallace's explanations
of the problems of agriculture, and why it is
impossible to do anything about them.
How about Landon? Would he answer the
criticisms that have been made? No. Landon
is not even aware that these problems exist.
Economically and politically he is illiterate.
From a comparatively simple, middle - class
background, as governor of an agrarian state,
lie still thinks that any boy born in a log cabin
t an be President, that he is the "aveiage Amer
ican citizen," when the income of the average
I have watched with amazement the past few
weeks the Republicans' objections to political
ideas expressed in The Daily. Their contention
was that Eisenbach was prostituting the fount of
knowledge at its source by emitting Democratic
propaganda in his column. They screamed at
him for being flippant about vital issues, and
for not rubbing Stanford's traditional prejudices
the right way. The Straw Poll has come out
confirming the supposition that undergraduate
Stanford is predominantly Republican, and I
shall now commit a double sin of not only being
"unrepresentative" of their will, but attempt to
be a little less flippant in my analysis. I hope
the Republicans will understand that I do not
expect to change any votes at this late date, and
that is one reason I'm writing it.
I cannot quite understand the fervor with
which Mr. Eisenbach beats the tom-tom for Roo
sevelt's great reforming zeal. I acknowledge
Roosevelt's grip over the products of unrest and
social injustice, but there is a striking disparity
between his speeches and his performance.
Mr. Roosevelt's principal contribution to reform
may well be that he has crystallized class senti
ment, which will turn to a genuine expression
v/hen it eventually becomes disillusioned.
I don't think Roosevelt has spent nearly
enough, but what he has spent, he hasn't spent
as well as he should.
NRA was not the blue eagle, it was the dodo.
Economically it had not a leg to stand on. Brook
ings has clearly shown that. For an economy of
plenty, AAA is one of the weakest measures
ever enacted, but you mustn't forget that eco
onmically we are not living in an economy of
plenty, and economically, the way to deal with
the Farm problem is to liquidate the Farmers,
and, unfortunately, the Farmer is not the Eco
nomic Man of Adam Smith. Roosevelt's reform
measures in the Coal Industry and Wall Street
pulled their punches. The Corporations Excess
Profits Tax was poorly drawn.

the growth of industrial unionism by his moral
support, his actual support to labor has been
more apparent than real. As far as actual reform
