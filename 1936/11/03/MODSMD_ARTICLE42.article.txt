BEHIND THAT GREEN CURTAIN
Today, dumb college professors and smart business
men will stop correcting papers and hating Roosevelt
to retire behind Democracy's green curtain.
There, away from blaring radios, officially away
from the coercion of pure selfishness and vicious fac
tionalism, they will vote.
They are free to adjust their tie, pick their teeth—
and cast their ballots—all functions best done in private.
A tremendous number of them will view the first
two adjustments more important than the last. As
individualists, they probably will vote Republican.
Others will vote before they perform the other func
tions. They will be radicals—Democrats, Socialists,
Communists, or low-down Rosicrucians.

In the great majority of cases, voters will have no
idea what they are voting for. Their half hour spent
in the booths will have just one increment—a period
of needed privacy in an over-socialized world.
There are millions who will vote Democratic be
cause their papas did. The Republicans point to them
as just dumb. There are millions who will vote Re
publican because their grandfathers did. The Demo
crats will villify them as unworthy of the franchise.
There are uncounted thousands who will vote either
bccause they "like Roosevelt" or bccause they don't.

And there are a few, white hopes of popular gov
ernment, who will restrict their polling booth picnic to
the casting of an intelligent vote.
They will have studied the issues, which go far
below such things as reciprocal trade agreements, the
MR A or the AAA. They will have been neither con
vinced nor disabused by radioed arguments condemn
ing anything in a half-hour. They will realize that the
important thing in this election isn't spending, saving,
budget-balancing or giving poor business confidence,
but whether Amercia holds individual liberty above the
"greatest good for the greatest number" concept.
These blessed people, regardless of how they vote,
will have burrowed to the bases of the campaign: not
a New Deal balance sheet or a Republican excoriation,
but the philosophic principles of Democracy, itself.
The Democrats obviously stand for a planned econ
omy, believing in a more equitable distribution of the
world's goods and a protectorate over profit-grabbing
business. The Republicans stand for a revival of in
dividual liberty, with the citizen untrammeled in the
pursuit of his individual happiness.

The Republicans may be short-sighted, seeing a bird
in the separate hand as worth two in the bush of
planned economy. The Democrats may be long
sighted, seeing more happiness for a greater number if
productive industries are controlled, but meanwhile
working against Ihe interests of both public and busi
ness alike in the mechanics of such control.
* * # *
This is the sort of stuff behind it all. It is the sort of
stuff in any econ or poly sci textbook you pick up. It is
far different from what London has told you, or what
Roosevelt has told you. It is the stuff that makes
voting too big a job for you and me.
So we'll pull little levers, after we've adjusted our
tie and picked our teeth.
