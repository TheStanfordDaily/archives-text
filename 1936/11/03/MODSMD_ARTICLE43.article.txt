# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Since both candidates have been running on their
records, they need a new needle. And Landon needs
a new noodle. Franklin doesn't realize that Theodore
broke his record at 0(50 meters in 1912. Landon may
bo blowing his horn, but it's a cinch that with his
rhythm he can't swing 50 votes. America's voters
don't want jobs, they want relief from it all.
On the other hand, Roosevelt is just a song and
dance man. When the music stops, he's lost. Roosevelt
had a rendezvous with destiny in Philadelphia, and a
rendezvous with Wall Street a week or so later in New
York. Roosevelt's rendezvous i- quite a night club, but
he seems to be clubbing destiny to death. What Roose
velt and this country need is a pood 5-eeht nitery.
Our Hasher therefore comes mil this morning for
Landon he kept u.s out of the war.
