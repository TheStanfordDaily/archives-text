TODAY IS FLAG DAY. No, wait,
I mean today is election day. And
all the columnists on The Daily are
coming out flat, just like that, for
their favorite candidates.
So, nothing loathe, I shall state my
political convictions. I am an Anti-
Republican. To me, the greatest is
sue of the battle is that the Repub
licans shall not be returned to office.
Which, naturally, leaves just one
candidate in the presidential field.
Roosevelt is not perfect. Many of
his policies are open to criticism. But
it is imperative that certain forces
and influences which inevitably come
to the fore during Republican ad
ministrations shall be minimized.
The Scrapbook keeper has spoken!
WHY HASN'T Don McNeil, wise
cracking master of ceremonies on
so many Chicago NBC programs,
achieved greater fame? The man is
not only a good comedian, but he
keeps at it, writing his own material,
for a number of programs, week after
week. He dishes more real comedy
per seven days than any of the so
called top ranking comedians.
GOOD TUNE: "You Don't Love
Right." Try Eddie Fitzpatrick's toe
tickling version sometime.
MUSIC PUBLISHERS ARE SORE
at Lucky Strike's Hit Parade pro
gram. They say that dealers are or
dering tunes according to their posi
tion on the Big Ten, that unless a
tune makes the Lucky list, oi'ders are
cancelled. They've already screamed
"unfair" to the Federal Trade Com
mission, but that body says it doesn't
see how somebody in the tobacco in
dustry could harm the interests of
someone in the music industry."
