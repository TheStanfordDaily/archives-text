"LADIES IN LOVE," At the Fox
Stanford Theater
The Daily boycotted its own boy
cott Sunday night to review what
was ostensibly Simone Simon's cur
rent starring vehicle, "Ladies in
Love." We are not sure it was worth
it.
The advertisements both in Paly
and in the City rank Simone ahead
of Loretta Young, Janet Gay nor, and
Constance Bennett (the ladies in
love). Really, she has less to do
than either Paul Lucas or Don
Ameche. We just want to get you
straight so you won't miss where we
did—seeing "Ladies in Love" for
Simone's sake.
Evejj in the few scenes in which
the French actress is featured, some
thing has happened to her. She's
still decidedly different and quaint
and dimply, but the make-up man
has blackened her up, darkened her
eyes, hardened her features. The
soft light and shadow that helped her
naive smile and twinkling eyes in
"Girls' Dormitory" are missing. If
you've never seen Simone in any
thing, don't start out with this one.
For the rest of the lovely ladies,
their episodic love lives are inter
esting but not exciting. Alan Mow
bray, as Janet Gaynor's magician
friend, carries the film to its heights
—with hilarious lines and situations.
Highest point: when Mowbray
talks Gaynor into embracing him,
heaves a sigh of relief, and says—

"Wheewww, for a minute I thought
I'd lost my grip."
"Sworn Enemy," secondary fea
ture, might make up for Simone's
lack. It tells the tale of rackets in a
big city, of Robert Young's fight to
the top as investigator for an inves
tigator. Florence Rice,
Grantland Rice's daughter, will re
mind you a little of Madge Evans.
