## BOYCOTT JUSTIFIED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I entirely agree with the editorial
on theater boycott in the Thursday
issue of the Daily. It seems to me
that if the Daily succeeds in leading
this boycott against Paly theaters,
some definite good for Stanford men
and women will be done. This is an
entirely justifiable action, and I cer
tainly hope it will effect the much
needed changes.
However, I see no reason to get up
a big gripe for Palo Alto as a town.
True, they do endorse the present
control of speeding. A glance at the
figures on accidents, injuries, and
deaths before and after the drive
started should convince anyone of its
sensibility. Few cities can show a
better record.
Palo Alto's greatest asset is its
proximity to Stanofrd University.
This fact is admitted by the city
planning committee, appointed by
the Palo Alto Residents Club.
The town itself does not live off
Stanford like a lot of leeches. Most
of the residents living in Palo Alto
have work in San Francisco. As a

place from which to commute, Palo
Alto is practically ideal. It is near
enough to the city so that residents
don't get too countrified, yet far
enough away so that it is a great
place to raise the kiddies, etc.
I don't see where any cop's pants
are going to cost $15. This, however,
is not representative of the spirit of

the entire town.
So take it easy. You're apt to raise
your blood pressure with so much
moaning.
