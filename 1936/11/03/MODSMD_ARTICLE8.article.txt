NEW YORK, Nov. 2 (UP). —The two men in Hyde Park, New York,
and Topcka, Kansas, tonight dramatized the campaign issues for the
voters, hut in hundreds of hamlets, cities, and rural districts the struggle
fori power went on, with the tide of battle turning, in many cases, on
local issues.
The people—ls,ooo,ooo of them—will elect 35 United States senators,
432 members of the House of Representatives, 33 governors, and hun-

dreds of judges, state legislators, and'
local officials. Control of Congress
was a prize for which the rival par
ties were fighting almost as hard as
they were for the election of Presi
dent.
Republicans Optimistic
"It will be an amazing turnover,"
said Representative Chester Bolton,
chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, predict
ing that the G.O.P. would go into
the next Congress in control of the
house.
Publicly, Democratic Chairman
James A. Farley said he expected
Democrats to hold their present ma
jority in the house. Privately, Demo
cratic leaders look for a loss of be
tween 35 and 60 seats, which still
would leave the New Deal with an
adequate working majority.
Bad Weather Forecast
Bad weather was predicted for
most of the nation. Rain and snow,
turning rural roads into mud and
making a ride to the polls a dis
couraging matter for the farm vote,
were forecast for most of the Mid
west and the border states. A cold
wave marched out of the Northwest
and moved into the farm belt, leav
ing snow in the Rocky Mountain
states.
William Randolph Hearst, who
supported Mr. Roosevelt in 1932, said
he would risk his reputation "as a
political prophet" that Governor
Landon would be elected.
Thomas Predicts F.R. Win
AH these observations led many to
believe that tomorrow's election will
be of historic importance chiefly be
cause it will mark the collapse of old
party lines and the building of two
new parties that will be conservative
and liberal, no matter what names
arc used to designate them.
Norman Thomas, Socialist candi
date for President, spoke from New
York, asking votes for the doctrine
that Capitalism is an outworn ma
chine that must be replaced. He
predicted the rc-clcction of Mr.
Roosevelt.
