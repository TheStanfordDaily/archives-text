# Committee Plans Nitery To Follow Play Friday
## Reg Dances To Be Sublet To Student Groups With Worthy Cause 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Success of Stanford's first student
operated nitery was acknowledged
officially last night as Ex Committee
ripped through its weekly meeting
in less than an hour, shortest time
yet this year.
After empowering Cardinals to
supply the audience of "Roadside"
with a three-hour ' night spot" in the
A.S.S.U. lobby following the show at
10 o'clock Friday night, the Commit
tee stamped its approval on one mo
tion, referred another to a subcom
mittee.
Registration dances will be "sub
let" to campus organizations only
after they have furnished the Com
mittee with proof that the profits

will be used for "a worthy purpose,"
last night session ruled.
If the Committee is not satisfied
that applying organizations would
live up to a "worthy purpose," the
A.S.S.U. itself will sponsor the
dance, according to the approved
motion drawn up by Student Man
ager Chuck Fontius.
Joe Burris urged that the A.S.S.U.
run all leg dances itself, turn profits
over to the Student Loan Fund. Ruth
Goodan, who had talked with Mrs.
Almon E. Roth, argued that organ
izations running the dances now turn
their profits into scholarships for
which "there is a definite need."
Phil Bernheim, campus dramatic
"authority," presented the commit
tee with a plea for a $30 grant with
which to finance national plugging
of songs from the Big Game Gaieties.
"Princeton gets its Triangle Show
numbers published every year," said
Bernheim. "They are big successes.
If wo go about it systematically we
can put over Gaiety songs."
He outlined plans for obtaining
coast-to-coast radio presentation of
this year's songs, asked S.'iO to have
them printed for distribution to the
country's principal orchestras and
music publishers.
"No matter how good they are," he
said, "they won't be accepted if no
body knows about them."
Shirley Jones and Bob Mfillctt.
both Farm music-lights themselves,
and Fontius, money-light, will con
sider Bernhcim's proposal before
next Tuesday.

Success of Stanford's first student
operated nitery was acknowledged
officially last night as Ex Committee
ripped through its weekly meeting
in less than an hour, shortest time
yet this year.
After empowering Cardinals to
supply the audience of "Roadside"
with a three-hour ' night spot" in the
A.S.S.U. lobby following the show at
10 o'clock Friday night, the Commit
tee stamped its approval on one mo
tion, referred another to a subcom
mittee.
Registration dances will be "sub
let" to campus organizations only
after they have furnished the Com
mittee with proof that the profits

will be used for "a worthy purpose,"
last night session ruled.
If the Committee is not satisfied
that applying organizations would
live up to a "worthy purpose," the
A.S.S.U. itself will sponsor the
dance, according to the approved
motion drawn up by Student Man
ager Chuck Fontius.
Joe Burris urged that the A.S.S.U.
run all leg dances itself, turn profits
over to the Student Loan Fund. Ruth
Goodan, who had talked with Mrs.
Almon E. Roth, argued that organ
izations running the dances now turn
their profits into scholarships for
which "there is a definite need."
Phil Bernheim, campus dramatic
"authority," presented the commit
tee with a plea for a $30 grant with
which to finance national plugging
of songs from the Big Game Gaieties.
"Princeton gets its Triangle Show
numbers published every year," said
Bernheim. "They are big successes.
If wo go about it systematically we
can put over Gaiety songs."
He outlined plans for obtaining
coast-to-coast radio presentation of
this year's songs, asked S.'iO to have
them printed for distribution to the
country's principal orchestras and
music publishers.
"No matter how good they are," he
said, "they won't be accepted if no
body knows about them."
