### 
NEW \ ORK, Nov. 4 (UP). — President Roosevelt has
been elected to a second term in the White House on the
basis of incomplete United Press returns from 48 states.
Governor Alf M. Landon, his Republican opponent, con
ceded the election at 1:35 E.S.T. today in a telegram to the
I President at Hyde Park.
At that hour Mr. Roosevelt was a winner or leader in
■ 45 states with 519 electoral votes and Governor Landon was
j a winner or ahead in three states with 12 electoral votes.
Mr. Roosevelt's plurality promised to be tremendous and
' a record-breaker.
At 1:45 a.m. E.S.T. the popular votes were:
Roosevelt, 10,848,610
Landon, 6,245,751
William Lemke, 74,360
On the basis of a probable vote of 44 million in this elec
tion Mr. Roosevelt's plurality may be more than 10 million

votes if final returns maintain his
load in the proportions existing when
Governor Landon accepted defeat.
Mr. Roosevelt maintained 32 plural
ities for 7,060,000.
Notable in returns which ended

the political controversy wore Roose
velt's lead in Kansas on the basis of
incomplete returns, the prospect
that the President would carry his
home state, Now York, by a margin
of close to one million votes and
Governor London's failure so far to
keep Delaware in ihe G.O.P. column.
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and
Michigan wore not complete, but the
Now Deal Democratic President was
leading in all of them as in Indiana
all states in which the Republicans
had concentrated a hot campaign.
