TIIE BELCH AT ST. MARY'S
The San Francisco News thinks
that the student dailies at Stanford
and California are getting a lot of
fun out of the spectacle of St. Mary's
College running on the rocks be
c-iuse the football team isn't paying
Ihe dividends it is supposed to.
Perhaps the editorial writers on
the News have been reading the rival
Monarch of the College Dailies
across the bay, but it is certain that
The Stanford Daily has never grown
hoarse cheering the wolves that howl
about the gates of Moraga. Of course,
what we think privately is off the
record and nobody's business but our
own.
After all, Stanford has had its own
troubles in regards to bonds and in
terest payments, and even though
our bonds are ethically more gold
edged, we cannot snicker at St.
Mary's skidding down the balance
sheet in a spray of red ink. The fun
we do get is at the success of the St.
Mary's varsity on its triumphal tour
of the East.

As far as I can see, the great wor
shippers of the St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, and U.S.F. aggregation are the
sports writers on the San Fi'ancisco
papers. What it is that makes them
;o partial to these outfits, I don't
':now, but some day the gentlemen
of the press are going to break a
"ertebra bending over backwards in
l;< ing favorable to the parochial
: r hools.
In the dead days of August when
1 'otball is still in the foggy future,
I ;e San Francisco sportswriters start
1 ilking about how St. Mary's has an

I plember rolls around, and when

tie main concern is not for the game

The truth is that St. Mary's gives
eat favors in the form of free trips
with the team to sports writers who
