Nitery goes on again Friday
night, after "Roadside" pre
sentation, in the specially deco
rated A.S.S.L'. lobby, Cardinals
decided last night.
Marshmallows before the
fireplace and cokes in the Cellar

dance prevents a Saturday nit
ery, hut Cardinals hope to make
it an every night affair after it
has passed the experiment
stage.
