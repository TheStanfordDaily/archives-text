# Federal Mediation In Strike Sought By Civic Leaders
## Special Meeting of Board Called by Chairman; F.D.R. May Intervene 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP). â€”
Powerful pressure was exerted upon
(he United States Maritime Commis
sion today to urge Federal interven
tion in the spreading strike of marine
workers.
Admiral H. A. Wiley, chairman of
the commission, called an emergency
meeting of its three present mem
bers to discuss scores of telegrams
begging that the government inter
cede to thaw shipping tie-ups and
avoid threatened bloodshed.
An official of the commission,
which has been in office less than a
month, said these messages had been
received from business men, civic
bodies, and shipowners in many
ports.
Board Restricted
However, it was intimated by
sources close to Admiral Wiley, that
little action could be taken by the
commission other than suggesting
to President Roosevelt that he per
sonally intervene.
Its restricted powers allow only
"investigation' of labor conditions
aboard subsidized vessels. Such in
vestigations are being hampered by
the dispute, official said.
If the President declared a 'na
tional emergency," the commission
would be empowered by the Mer
chant Marine Act of 1936 to requisi
tion vessels. These might conceiv
ably be manned with government
crews, such as the Naval Reserve.
