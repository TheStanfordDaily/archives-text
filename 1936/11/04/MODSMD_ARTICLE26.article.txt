# Sophs Sponsor Jolly-up Rally
## New Plan To Be Tried For Washington Tilt 
### 
In place of the usual Washington
game rally, a free dance sponsored
by the sophomore class aided by the
rally committee will be held in the
women's gym tomorrow from 7 to 8
o'clock.
The affair is on the jolly-up plan,
according to Chairman Harry Hor
ton, and will be carried out in the
rally theme with cartoons of the
team by Sam Matlison and red and
white favors. George Haller's all -
campus band featuring Yvonne
Beatty will play.
This is the first time an affair of
this kind has taken the place of a
traditional rally, T. M. McDaniel,
rally committee chairman, announc
ed, and if successful will be contin
ued next year.
"Anybody who wants to can come
and get a date there," Harry Horton
said. "I think it would be a good
thing if we could put this over in
place of the usual rally in the Pa
vilion, and make it a regular feature.
Maybe the different classes could
sponsor dances for other games."
