# Lecturer Talks On Tokyo Stage
## Mrs. Penlington Shows Pictures of Theaters 
### 
Mrs. Zoe Kinkaid Penlington
spoke on the "Tokyo Stage" last
night in the Little Theater.
Her topic covered three divisions
of Japanese drama: the Kabuki,
which is 300 years old, known as the
popular stage of Japan; the Doll
Theater, much like our marionettes
except that they are life-size, also
300 years old; and the Noh theater,
resembling the Greek stage and pos
sibly related to it. The last is the
oldest of the three, 500 years.
Most of Mrs. Penlington's lecture
concerned her slides, either in de
scription or explanation. She showed
photographs of many of the actors,
scenes ,and even some of the dances.
The theater in Japan shows a good
cross section of life. Everyone goes
to see the great actors, fine costumes,
gorgeous settings and beautiful
workmanship. Everyone is affected
equally by the stirring scenes por
trayed, Mrs. Penlington said.
Besides the three classical types of
drama, there are, in Tokyo, moving
picture houses, reviews, and the
modern theater.
