As there was an absence of "dis
orderly conduct on the train" to the
U.C.L.A. game ,there were no cases
before the Men's Council at their
usual meeting yesterday.
Robert A. Hall, secretary of Men's
Council, commented that "the gang
acted pretty good" in regard to the
rooters.
Smoking is forbidden on the trans-
Pacific dipper planes.
