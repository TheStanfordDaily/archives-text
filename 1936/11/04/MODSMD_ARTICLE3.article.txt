# What Stanford Thinks About It All
## EDWARD M. HULME 
### 
"The election has come out the
way I felt sure it would. The mass
of our people know where their in
terests lie and who are their true
leaders. All the tiresome bunk, for
it. bus been nothing less than that,
we have had to listen to about
Americanism and the Constitution
has met with the sharp rebuke it
deserved.
"Roosevelt's second term will be
very successful. He will not have to
face a great depression; nor will he
have to con: ider another election.
He will, I believe and hope, move
further to the left and will preesnt
to Congress a number of measures
of fundamental importance to the
welfare of the great majority of the
people.
"The election was a victory of
principle over privilege. I hope that
now all our people will work to
gether for peace, justice, and the
happine s of our citizens.'
