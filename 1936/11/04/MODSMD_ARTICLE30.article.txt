# Tiny Invents New Attack For Huskies
## Running Plays 'Look Like Something' for First Time during Season 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Indian warriors, determined and
dauntlessâ€”fast and at last furious,
have been called into some pretty
business-like pow-wows within the
last two days. And Big Chief Tiny
Thornhill will keep them rolling
along the war path, his recent activ
ities boding no good for Mr. Jimmy
Phelan's team.
Among other things, Thornhill has
empowered his charges with a batch
of brand new tactics. Out of Mon
day afternoon's rather light drill and
yesterday's more intensive session
under the lights comes the indication
that the Redskin attack will indeed
be a source of befuddlement to
Washington.
Blocking Pleases
Tiny has already voiced the opin
ion that to him the most enjoyable
part of the Indians' performance last
Saturday was the generally improv
ed blocking. For the first time this
season, he adds, the running attack
"looked like something."
So he reasons thus: improved play
in a ground attack will make the
Cardinals' passing offense more po
tent in the future. And when it comes
to an actual prediction of scoring in
this week-end's fracas, Tiny has this
to say: "I'm almost satisfied we can
shove over a score or two on the
Huskies. And I'm not so sure we
can't stop Haines and Cain, both on
running and pass plays."
New Plays Concocted
Now, encouraged by the prospect
of no injuries to handicap the squad's
activities this week, Thornhill has
begun to drill his men on some
newly concocted plays. Phelan, on
the other hand, is reputedly suffer
ing the pangs of distress because in
juries have crept into his veteran
backfield combination of By Haines,
Jim Cain, Elmer Logg, and Ed
Nowogroski. <
Since 1893 Stanford has met the
Washingtonians 15 times, winning 9
contests, tieing 2, and losing but 4.
The greatest honor the Indians can
garner this Saturday is the assurance
that a win puts them, unofficially, on
a par with the top ranking squads in
the Coast League.
