# Soccer Team To Meet Bruins
## Uclans Request Special Game with Stanford 
### 
"League-ally" speaking, the soccer
set-to with the University of San
Francisco next Saturday morning is
all-important because the Stanford I
outfit will have to win if they expect '
any more attention in the bay circuit
this fall. However, a newly carded
game with U.C.L.A. for the follow
ing Tuesday is creating quite a stir
in the home camp.
The Westwood teem will be up
north for three days preceding Ar
mistice to play California and San
Francisco and their recent telegram
requested an engagement with the
Card eleven. Coach Harry Maloney
wired his okay and now the idea will
be to mimic the gridiron activities of
Calvelli, Coffis, and company.
