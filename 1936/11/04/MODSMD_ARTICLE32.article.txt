TIIE HUSKIES ARE
SAID TO BE GOOD
The University of Washington is
widely respected in football circles.
This is because they have a vet
eran team this year, nine two-year
lettermen and a like number of one
year lettermen. They have big,
tough, experienced linemen in
Chuck Bond, John Wiatrak, and
Max Starcevich.
They have for backs Elmer Logg,
punter and quick-kicker supreme,
By Haines, a flash in the open field.
Nowogroski and Cruver, equally
able triple threat fullbacks, and
Waskowitz and Cain, who could
make any ball team on the Coast.
They have a record this year that
is coveted by all: wins over U.C.L.A..
Oregon State, Idaho, California, and
Oregon, with a 14-7 loss to Minnesota
as the only blemish. Minnesota you
have heard about — national champs
until they met Northwestern in the
rain last week.
The Huskies are heading at the
Rose Bowl, and because of their big
game with Minnesota are well
known in the East.
Yes, the University of Washington
is widely respected in football circles.
BUT WAAAAIT
A MINUTE
No Stanford man who was in the
stands or on the bench in the Coli
seum has any doubt but what we can
lick the Huskies. And beat them
even, barring all flukes, breaks, or
what have you.
These are not the optimistic
thoughts of a Thornhill, nor the in
sane ravings of an imbecile, unless
we are all crazy. Granted that if you
beat the best in the league you your
self are pretty good, it seems goofy,
looking at the 1936 Stanford record, j
But funny things nappen, and it's [
a fact: no Stanford man who was in ;
the stands or on the bench in the \
Coliseum has any doubt but what
we can lick the Huskies. Dick
Friendlich described it the best of!
any: ' Thornhill has a football team, j
Where he got it or what he made it
out of, I don't know. But he has it."
I think that back of the U.C.L.A.
win was this—the boys got sick and
tired of losing close ones week in
arj w(-.ek out, but they also decided j
that the way tu win that one would
be to block, tackle, r.nd drive in a I

way that their i.Jversaries would
stay blocked, tackled, or driven, and
i.ot by reading "What's Wron? with
Stanford' articles in the norning
papers.
This is borne out in the fact that
thev earned 65 yards worth of pen
alties as reward for their hard play.
No Bruins, were roughed enough to
make them mad, though—most an
gry of any were the Cards, for los
ing the 65 yards.
Experience only will teach them
what's right and what isn't—Bones
Hamilton was a great halfback be
cause he knew just exactly how hard
he could hit a guy and not get
penalized.
All in the spirit of these desperate
efforts at a win last week, you should
have seen Calvelli. Even Tricky
Dick Hyland would stroke his chin
if he saw Calvelli hold the 'ball out
in front of him. He probably gets a
pretty good grip on it with those
hands of his, but every time the
whistle blew, there was Tony, hold
ing the ball way out as far as he
could without having some Bruin
grab it.
Paulman was at the game, was in
the dressing room afterward, his foot
still in a cast. Glenn Hamilton didn't
make the trip.
What would have happened if all
had been in good shape?

beat the best in the league you your

the stands or on the bench in the \
Coliseum has any doubt but what
we can lick the Huskies. Dick

any: ' Thornhill has a football team, j
Where he got it or what he made it
out of, I don't know. But he has it."
I think that back of the U.C.L.A.
win was this—the boys got sick and
tired of losing close ones week in
arj w(-.ek out, but they also decided j
that the way tu win that one would
be to block, tackle, r.nd drive in a I

way that their i.Jversaries would
stay blocked, tackled, or driven, and
i.ot by reading "What's Wron? with
Stanford' articles in the norning
papers.
This is borne out in the fact that
thev earned 65 yards worth of pen
alties as reward for their hard play.
No Bruins, were roughed enough to
make them mad, though—most an
gry of any were the Cards, for los
ing the 65 yards.
Experience only will teach them
what's right and what isn't—Bones
Hamilton was a great halfback be
cause he knew just exactly how hard
he could hit a guy and not get
penalized.
All in the spirit of these desperate
efforts at a win last week, you should
have seen Calvelli. Even Tricky
Dick Hyland would stroke his chin
if he saw Calvelli hold the 'ball out
in front of him. He probably gets a
pretty good grip on it with those
hands of his, but every time the
whistle blew, there was Tony, hold
ing the ball way out as far as he
could without having some Bruin
grab it.
Paulman was at the game, was in
the dressing room afterward, his foot
still in a cast. Glenn Hamilton didn't
make the trip.

TIIE HUSKIES ARE
SAID TO BE GOOD
The University of Washington is
widely respected in football circles.
This is because they have a vet
eran team this year, nine two-year
lettermen and a like number of one
year lettermen. They have big,
tough, experienced linemen in
Chuck Bond, John Wiatrak, and
Max Starcevich.
They have for backs Elmer Logg,
punter and quick-kicker supreme,
By Haines, a flash in the open field.
Nowogroski and Cruver, equally
able triple threat fullbacks, and
Waskowitz and Cain, who could
make any ball team on the Coast.
They have a record this year that
is coveted by all: wins over U.C.L.A..
Oregon State, Idaho, California, and
Oregon, with a 14-7 loss to Minnesota
as the only blemish. Minnesota you
have heard about — national champs
until they met Northwestern in the
rain last week.
The Huskies are heading at the
Rose Bowl, and because of their big
game with Minnesota are well
known in the East.
Yes, the University of Washington
