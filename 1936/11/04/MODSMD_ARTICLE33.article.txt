History records that in the pre
depresison era of 1928 the Stanford
freshmen defeated California's bat
tling babes by a 7-6 score. Since that
time frustration has marked every
Papoose effort to tomahawk the little
Bear.
In 1932 the frosh, powerfully
armed with Gravsons, Alustizas, Cal
laways, and Moscrips, could gain no
better than a 7-7 tie with Coach
Clint Evans' boys. After a last des
perate but futile effort to tame the
obstinate animal from Berkeley,
Rabbit Bradshaw turned in his
coaching credentials last fall and
moved on to Fresno.
Harry Shipkey had been in the
habit of producing prep "wonder
teams" at Salinas. His pleasant work
there was interrupted by Stanford
grid enthusiasts who believed they
had found in him a man capable of
molding a yearling eleven that could
crush Cal.
For nearly two months Mr. Ship
key has been going about the process
of building a football machine that
will win the Little Big Game. Satur
day the test comes. California's
freshmen will play hosts to Stan
ford's men of "40" at Berkeley.
