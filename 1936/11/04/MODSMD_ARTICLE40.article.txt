# Nitery

### 
Last week-end there was the U.C.L.A. game.
Those who didn't go south went home to see
the folks. There wasn't supposed to be a soul
left on the campus. Yet, a mob jammed the
A.S.S.U. lobby for the inaugural Nitery dance.
As far as it is known, everyone had a good
time. No one expressed regret that there
wasn't any liquor being served. No one felt
that a cover charge of S3 was necessary to
make the evening a success. This would indi
cate, I think, that there is a place and a need
for a campus night spot.
The question is: does the A.S.S.U. lobby fill
the need and is it the place?
There are several real advantages now pos
sessed by the lobby. It is already there, and
would require only a small amount of labor
to tear out the offices now lining it. It is also
near the center of the campus, and for those
who don't have cars this is a great selling point.
However, that office space is really needed,
and even with the offices torn out, just exactly
what would you have? The room, despite its
two fireplaces, is a little too formal for a night
club.
I'f the idea of retaining the night club near
the center of the campus holds, the ideal would
seem to be to burrow along at the same or ap
proximately the same level as the present
Cellar, put in tables and chairs, and leave the
center of the room to dance in or carry on
throughout the whole Cellar.
Any night club that is built also should have
a small stage for the presentation of student
entertainers, skits, songs, or Weaver.
The great advantage of the centrally located
Nitery plan is that it would lend itself to casual
dancing after a few hours per night of pounding
the books in the Libe, and thus would have a
definite week-night function.
Soon we probably will see the Golf Club
house tried. The Golf Clubhouse has the ad
vantage that it is probably the most attractive
building and the best all-year setting possible
for a Nitery. It has the factor of being off the
beaten path. To those without cars this is a
drawback, although the distance from Roble
and Lagunita to the Golf Clubhouse seems
greater than it is. To those with cars the Club
house possesses the real advantage of being far
enough away to be unusual, not too far to be
reached easily. There is one real obstacle to
a Clubhouse Nitery, and that is that it probably
v/ill not be large enough, and the Clubhouse
may not stand enlarging.
It is too bad that there are so many objections
to the Lake Lagunita Nitery plan, for it holds
the possibility of being a night club that really
would hold the students. It has an unusual
setting, even though the lake is full only part
of the year. The Lake Lagunita Nitery would be
"different," yet easily accessible. Also, the
construction of a new building would give the
opportunity to plan a building that fits the need,
rather than one that conformed to buildings
built to fit other needs. Prime objection: origi
nal cost.
Well, we have our alternatives. Let's not for
get to see the wood for the trees. It is necessary
to maintain our enthusiasm for the general idea
of the campus Nitery, while experimenting
with different forms of campus entertainment.
It is only by experimentation that we can tell
what we want. We shouldn't go into this thing
blindlyâ€”but with many questions answered,
tiie real function clearly defined. Unless we do
know what we're driving after we are liable
to end up with lots of building, but not the kind
we need.
