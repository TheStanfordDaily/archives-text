# Boycott
## 
### 
Palo Alto High probably will join Stanford in
its boycott of the theaters. What, Palo Alto
would be striking for is the return of student
latos. Residents of Paly and old-time Stanford
ites remember the day when the presentation
of a student body card and 25 cents was enough
to get students into the theater.
There is no logical reason why Paly's sug
gestion should not be adopted by Stanford in
its fight to lower prices. Paly theaters raised
their rates from the former ones simply because
they knew they could. Nobody was around to
squawk during the various summers that "sum
mer prices" went into effect.
Now, the idea of special student rates of 25
cents is something to squawk for.
Also something for which to squawk is the
death of the double bill, and the return of
Mickey Mouse.
Stanford can hold a consumer's strike in co
operation with Paly High, if we organize it.

It may mean a temporary discomfiture in going
up or down the highway to other shows that
are only slightly older than the Paly variety
(Barnstormers is reported to be considering re
viving some slightly older than those, such as
some early Chaplin, "The Birth of a Nation,"
et al.). This week-end, though, finds ample rea
son again for staying away from the Paly thea
ters.
The Dramatic Council really has cut its rates
at last; Dick Daugherty is offering some of his
Roadside ringside seats at 35 cents. Also sched
uled this Friday night is the second Nitery in
the A.S.S.U. lobby. Saturday night brings the
Cardinals A.S.S.U. dance in the Women's Gym.
We have everything to gain by staying away
from Paly theaters. It may seem hard to miss
a good show now, but it will bring big returns
in better entertainment at lower prices, if Stan
ford succeeds in putting across its consumer
strike.
