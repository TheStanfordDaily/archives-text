# BULL SESSION

AT A LATE HOUR LAST NIGHT
At the present moment no one is conceding any
thing. Franklin is sitting tight at Hyde Park with a
plate of ham and eggs, Eleanor, and a radio. Alf is
sitting tight in his Morris Chair with a dish of corn
pone, Theo Cobb ,and a radio.
Other good Democrats and Republicans, not ex
pected to be Kansas Coolidges or national saviours,
are tight both sitting and standing.
No matter who wins, the nation traditionally be
lieves that the first Tuesday in November, every four
years, is to be celebrated in a wet and witching manner.
For while Americans have an infinite capacity for
believing their vote will make or break America, the
night of vote-casting finds them equally capable of
seeing it as a pleasant and colossal joke.

With a flask in one hand and a blonde in the other,
they realize what (hey knew all along—that a President
isn't going to make or break anything, and that
American gets along so swimmingly because (he men
elected to do one thing are stopped by men elccted to
do something else..

In that single peculiarity of American Democracy is
perhaps our safeguard against such annoyingly efficient
governments as prevai.l in Russia and Italy. For if we
elect a President pledged to reduce the tariff, establish
R.O.T.C. units, and provide more seed for canary birds
in (he Virgin Islands, we carefully elect congressmen
whose business it is to get post-offices, be pacifists, and
favor the use of canary birds as black-damp sniffers in
coal mines.
The system works. If we have a depression every
seven years, that's certainly more enjoyable than being
told to price down your dog food when it means forget
ting about the new radio you wanted.
If our foreign trade suffers, that's better than having
a flock of dirty Russian wheat flooding our markets
and greatly increasing national wealth at the expense
of a hand-plow dirt farmer in Minnesota.

For the American has an ungodly lust for life. And
he realizes, with a sort of animal intelligence, that life
is composed of terrible suffering as well as orgies of
self-indulgence. Unlike the pathological Latin and the
stolid Aryan, he really doesn't want the idyllic econ
omy that reason dictates.
So, the same people who voted for Roosevelt in '32
morbidly enthusiastic for his sweep-clean program on
corrupt business, felt a tinge of satisfaction when the
Supreme Court cracked down.
The nine old men were, in their system of govern
ment, nine old cathodes. They completed the circuit
of futility from the positive President and Congress
to the negative judges.
And the resulting explosion in (he national ignition
was just what was wanted. It kept things from work
ing right according to system.
American really abhors a system. Just to be devil
ish, it probably will i-e-elect Franklin. It's sure that
its cleverly imposed checks will prevent anything from
happening that would be reasonable, and will main
tain that fascinating muddle that gives us an excuse,
every four years, to get drunk, and an excuse, every
seven years, to complain about business.
