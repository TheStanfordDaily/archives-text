MY DAY
We went to Ihe animal fair,
The donk and Ihc elcphunk were there
The red babboon
By the light of the moon
Combed Communists out of his hair.
The donkey he got drunk
And sat on the elephunk's trunk
Now both of <them inhaled
The promises they retailed
And died with their boots on in bunk.
Political note: Participants in last week's open forum
on political issues in the coming election were presented
with copies of Herbert Hoover's "Challenge to Liberty."
The gift was from Dr. Wilbur. On the books to the
Republican debaters was inscribed: "In appreciation of
the debate." On the books to the rest of the debaters
was: "A memento of the debate."
The Deegees are carrying this boycott thing too far.
Not only did they boycott the theater, but they boy
cotted the U.C.L.A. game, boycotted Ihe campus Nitery.
Eleven of them were seen last Saturday boy
cotting men by holding a stag party in the City, The
Hi-Y boys from Paly High must have soured them on
life.
Definite proof that San Francisco is unfair to Stan
ford students is the story that last Saturday night one
of the Farm boys partied at a City hotel .until 3 o'clock
in the morning. On his way home he dropped into the
men's room. Before he yot out, some wag had locked
the door, and he was forced to spend Ihe night.
