With three performances over,
three more scheduled for this week,
San Francisco's fourteenth opera
season has begun indeed.
Jewels and orchids probably loom
larger in spectators' minds than does
opera on opening night, and for that
reason "La Juive" was a good choice
for the first performance last Friday.
The opera itself. I think, is not a
particularly persuasive one. Music
in it is certainly not flimsy; there are
excellent choruses and two and three
pari vocal interludes, but the whole
thin>, lacks fire. It is tragedy that is
somehow a little detached and too
prolonged.
Voices and characterizations were
splendid. Giovanni Martinelli re
ceived an ovation for his incantation
in the last act as the persecuted
goldsmith, while Rethberg in the
title role as his daughter was in full
voice. Ezio Pinzo, veteran basso,
gave force and dignity to the charac
ter of the Cardinal de Brogni.
A contrast to the medieval tragedy
was Saturday night's popular per
formance of "The Barber of Seville."
Rossini's rollicking comedy of con
cealment was enjoyed by audience
and musicians alike. Carlo Morelli,
a newcomer to opera, romped and
swaggered as Figaro and revealed a
clear, strong baritone voice. But
Ezio Pinza as the bespectacled,
black-frocked music master nearly
eclipsed the barber. "The Barber
of Seville" is opera bouffant and Sat
urday's artists enjoyed it as that.
Tonight's performance, "Carmen,"
has Bruna Castagna in the title role,
Charles Kullmann, Ezio Pinza, and
Josephine Tumminia. Gennaro Papi,
Italian director, will conduct. Stand
ing room at $1.50 will probably be
available at the door.
