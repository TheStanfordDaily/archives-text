The Editor, Sir:
In Thursday's Campus Opinion,
Historian questions the accuracy of
my letter concerning President
Roosevelt's speech at Quebec.
I did not hear the radio broadcast
of the speech and the prompt and
enthusiastic applause of the Cana
dians. Undoubtedly, only a fragment
of the address was given in the news
reel.
I saw this same newsreel shot sev
eral times, at various theaters in
Paris, and the reception .was prac
tically the same each time. My let
ter merely described how the audi
ence reacted to the newsreel.
Is it not natural that a people, such
as the Canadians, who are being
honored by a visit from the Presi
dent of the United States, should ac
cord him gracious and enthusiastic
acknowledgment on such an occa
sion, whatever his accent might be?
