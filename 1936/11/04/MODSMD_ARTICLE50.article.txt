# A.S.U. Sponsors Armistice Reading
## 
### 
On other campi, chauvinists will
beat their drums, pacifists will beat
their breasts on Armistice Day, but
at Stanford, peace-minded students
will sponsor a reading of Irwin
Shaw's powerful play, 'Bury the
Dead," instead.
Under the auspices of the Ameri
can Student Union and the Stanford
Committee on Peace Activity, the
tryouts will be held in the Little
Theater this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Florence Cohen, in charge of the
production, announces that tryouts
are open to the student body. Defi
nite rehearsal plans have not yet
been released.
"Bury the Dead" was produced by
Sword and Sandals this summer, but
this is the first time that it will be
shown before the general student
body. The play gets its power from
the ironic implications from Shaw's
peculiar twist in having his soldiers
who are killed refuse to die.
