# MORE NITERY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We're all for the Nitery. May we
offer a few suggestions? We believe
the vacant lot across from the Corp
yard would be an ideal location for a
campus hangout, easily accessible to
the majority of the fair sex and not
far off the beaten trail of the stalwart
Stanford Rough.
A twenty-five thousand dollar
structure here could be easily con
verted if necessary into student body
offices or some such needed edifice
when the wanderlust took the hearts
of the Stanford youths. This pro
posed structure would be open from
3 to 12 p.m. every day and on spe
cial occasions could be used to take
some of the rush away from the Cel
lar. All we want is a fountain, a
few easy chairs, a fire place, a place
to dance, a radio-victrola, and a roof
over our heads.
A Nighter and a Nighterette
