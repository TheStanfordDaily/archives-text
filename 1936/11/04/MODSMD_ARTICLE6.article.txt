"The apparent Roosevelt land
slide, especially in metropolitan cen- \
ters and Middlewest and Pacific
states, with probably the largest
electoral vote in liO years, shows the
confidence which labor and the
farmers have in the policies of the
New Deal.
"However, Roosevelt will probably
be more conservative during the
next four years due to the usual op
position by Congress to a second
term President.
"He will probably have some va
cancies to fill on the Supreme Court
bench, and may accomplish his de
sire to place his favorite measures
before Congress again and expect the
Court to sustain them.
"Business will continue to im
prove regardless of the result of tlv
election. This election presages a
permanent realignment between
more liberal and conservative ele
: ments even to the definite elimina
tion of the existing major parties
