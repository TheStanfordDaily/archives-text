### 
NEW YORK. Wednesday, Nov. 4
(UP). — Democratic control of the
national House by 3 to 1 was pre
dicted early today on the basis of
incomplete election returns which
failed to show Republican gains.
Two years ago 322 Democrats and
103 Republicans were elected to tlie
House. Fragmentary returns from 21
states at 130 a.m. showed election
conceded of 10K Democrats, mostly
from the Solid South, and 10 Repub
licans.
Tentative Democratic gains show
ed up in Pennsylvania and Connec
ticut, pointing to tlie possibility that
the present House Democratic ma
jority may even be increased. Twr
Republican representatives were de
fcf led in Pennsylvania. Democrats
made a clean sweep of all six house
seats in Connecticut.
Southern states held true to the
Democratic course, and early return;
to the Middle West did not show «
Republican pick-up.
California founded the state pail
movement 60 years ago.
