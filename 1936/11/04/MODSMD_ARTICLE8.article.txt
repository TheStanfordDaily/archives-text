# Sig Chi House Gets Hoover Razz â€”By Mistake
## 
### 
To the accompaniment of
tooting horns and dragging tin
cans, approximately 35 cars
from San Jose Inst night came
to the campus in caravan for
mation, hcnt on razzing former
President Herbert Hoover.
Heading up the Row, they
first mistook the Sigma Chi
house for the Hoover residence,
shouting, "Yah, yah. Hoover,"
at the defenseless Sig Chis.
They then headed out May
field avenue toward Junipero
Serra in a mistaken effort to
find San Juan Hill. Led back
on the right road by an oblig
ing Stanford student, they
drove up the hill and straight
into the arms of Campus Officer
(ieorge Burns, waiting at the
Hoover road chains.
Burns kept the caravan mov
ing out and down the hill.
The cars bore large Roosevelt
isgns, paper streamers, and
some empty five-gallon cans
tied to their rears.
Dick Rath man, former mem
ber of the Stanford band, who
earlier in the evening had tried
to organize a student serenade
of the Hoovers, mistook the
caravan for some of the stu
dent he had phoned and proud
ly officiated with Burns in di
recting the cars atop San Juan
Hill.
