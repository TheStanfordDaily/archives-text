# Alf 16 Votes Ahead in Paly
## Two Stanford Precincts Split on Issue 
### 
Stanford campus, home of former
President Herbert Hoover, gave
Governor Alf M. Landon a decisive
majority yesterday but the campus
town was not so definitely in the
G.O.P. column.
Traditionally Republican Palo Alto
gave some promise of climbing on
the Democratic bandwagon on the
basis of incomplete returns tabulated
at midnight. With 14 precincts in
complete out of 30. Landon led the
President by only 16 votes out of
3,4.14 cast.
Stanford's two precincts split on
presidential favorites, with ex-
President. Hoover's voting booth
showing a 78 vote majority for Lan
don out of 248, while No. 2, in a
complete count, gave Roosevelt 95
to 72 for Landon.
Democratic Congressman McGrath
led his Republican opponent, Alonzo
Baker, by 481 ballots out of 2.103 in
incomplete returns from 18 Palo Alto
precincts in the eighth district con
test.
While no definite returns were
available on the 22 propositions sub
mitted to the voters, Palo Alto was!
said by official tabulators at the Paly '
Times to have given a no majority on
No. 22, the chain store tax measure.
