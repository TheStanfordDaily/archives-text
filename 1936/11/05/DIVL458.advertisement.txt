Tough as a Football Coach
A roustabout shoe—a shoe for cords, slacks
and sweaters —built for the strenuous life of
high-school and college men. It gets its
toughness from the raw-hide leather—a new
material in shoes and the same that's used in
the most durable types of luggage. Natural
color with a rough, heavy leather sole and a
storm-wear bellows tongue. "The Bruiser"
just begs ior a chance to "take it."
