# Husky Team Set for Card Tilt Saturday
## Indians Work on Pass Plays, New Offense; Washington En Route

llow flashy will be this Byron
Haines at ball carrying Saturday?
How good and how steady will be
his friend, ELnier Logg, at punting
Saturday?
Answer those questions and you
answer who's apt to win the big get
together in the Stadium, the fifteenth
annual classic of Stanford Indian vs.
Washington Husky. ,
Those questions loom important
because all the boys who have seen
Coach Phelan's men recently divulge
that his strategy is this: Logg punts
the Huskies out of any possible dif
ficulty and other times kicks simply
as an offensive move. He can and
docs outkick any of his competitors
10 yards, and 10 yards at each ex
change will amount to a good net
gain after some minutes of play.
Huskies Powerful
Meanwhile Phelan wears down the
opposing line with Johnston, Wasko
witz, Cruver, or others in his group
of nine all-Coast backs, laying the
way to spring Mr. Haines, the faster
guy of the group, into some death
striking play that may begin any way
â€”an end run, a reverse, a lateral .. .
The Huskies set much like U.C.
L.A. before their shift, three men
up to the line and the rest spread
out conveniently behind them. Then
they go into their final set, nearly
always a balanced line, Notre Dame
box.
This fact the Stanford backers
look upon with delight, because what
smashing fellows like Clark, Zagar,
Callaway ,and Stone might do to a
straight Notre Dame attack is some
thing awful to contemplate.
Attack Varies
But the awful contemplation ends
in theory. Actually Coach Phelan
has such an unbelievable magazine
of tricks in cross bucks, laterals, for
ward passes, and other like tools for
spreading the defense that the Stan
ford line will be lucky to be able to
gang up on one play out of five.
The Huskies left Seattle yesterday,
35 of them. They will work out in
the Stadium tomorrow afternoon, to
get the taste of dry grass. Latest
reports give them all to be in fine
fettle except Ed Nowogroski, lead
ing fullback, but he is replaced by
A1 Cruver, a sophomore every bit as
good.
Cards Optimistic
At the Stanford camp yesterday
there was an air of optimism. Every
one is in good trim except Glenn
Hamilton, whose knee is still stiff but
not enough so to keep him from
running plays. Hamilton, taped up,
might play Saturday, but undoubt
edly Coach Thomhill will not risk
further injury.
