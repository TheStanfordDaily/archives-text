# Tryouts Held For Armistice Reading
## 
### 
The horrors of war were relived
yesterday afternoon in the Little
Theater, as 35 students went through
the paces of reading excerpts from
the play, "Bury the Dead."
It was the tryouts held by the
American Student Union and the
Stanford Committee on Peace Activ
ity to find a suitable east to present
a reading of Irwin Shaw's dramatic
masterpiece on Armistice Day in the
Little Theater.
The cast will be chosen within the
next few days. Sword and Sandals
produced "Bury the Dead" this
summer, but this is the first time
that it will be shown before the
general student body.
