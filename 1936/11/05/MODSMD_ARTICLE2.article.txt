Serpentine, paper hats, horns will
be given away at the door of the
sophomore - sponsored Washington
game rally-dance tonight from 7 to

Harry Horton, chairman and co
author of the new idea. Red and
white streamers and 100 balloons
will help to rouse "the real rally
spirit."
"I don't know how well this dance
in place of the regular pavilion rally
will turn out," Horton added, "but at
least it gives every student a chance
to take a more active part in the pre
game fun, and the fellows and girls
can make connections for the rest
of the week-end dances."
