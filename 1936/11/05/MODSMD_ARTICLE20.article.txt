# Trooper Whistles But Not For F. R.
## 
### 
The first post-election Fascist in-
I surgcncy started full blast on the
Stanford campus Tuesday night,
when a single storm-trooper dressed
I in the white-visored cap, red mili
' tary jackct, white braid, pants and
j shoes of the Stanford Band at
j tempted to organize a protest dem
; onstration and start "a quiet and
peaceful revolution" that would
i throw Franklin Delano Roosevelt
out of the White House.
I Part of the protest demonstration
I of the storm-trooper was to take a
gathering in front of Hoover's home
last night as a demonstration of
Stanford's sympathy with the ex
-1 President for putting up a "gallant
fight."
The storm-trooper, piccolo-playei
l of the Stanford Band, dropped ink

the Daily office at 10:45 Tuesday and
endeavored to enlist Daily members,
harassed with late election returns,
in the propsoed serenade. He re
ported that he had gone up and down
the Row, but could find no sere
naders.
He did not have his piccolo with
him, but he said that he did not
really need it to lead the serenade,
because ho/could whistle instead. He
said his way had been paid eight
! times by the Stanford Band to
[ U.C.L.A.-S.C. games. Each time he
was forced to whistle, because he
) couldn't find a piccolo that suited
I him.
Said the Fascist, "The time has
come when all the able-bodied and
1 sound-minded men and women of
I both parties should join together in

] a great peaceable enterprise to over-
I throw tyranny and to set up anew
i the standards of the Libcral-CON
j SERVATIVE parties."
Roosevelt's election affected other
! Farmsters in other fashions. For in
stance:
"NO I'M NOT A FRESHMAN
NOR HAVE I BEEN OUT ALL
NIGHT. I SIMPLY LOST WITH
LANDON."
It seems that one way of paying
election bets is to wear a summer
tux outfit to class and to carry a sign
with the above words on it. At
least, that's the penalty Alan Du
commun, Sigma Chi, imposed on
fraternity brother Bill Martin, who
read the Digest Poll and decided that
Landon was a cinch.
