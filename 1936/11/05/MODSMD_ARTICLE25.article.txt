# F.D.R. Leads 3-2; Democrats Gain 4-1 in Congress
## Landon Wins Only Eight Electoral Votes; Roosevelt May Win Twenty Seat Greater Majority in Senate 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 4 (U.R).—President Roosevelt, holding a 3 to 2 lead
over Governor Alf M. Landon, appeared today to he marching toward a
possible presidential plurality of in million votes.
He has heen returned to the White House by a landslide, according to
United Press election figures for approximately two-thirds of the nation's

121,637 voting precincts. In late af
ternoon the popular vote showed:
Roosevelt 22,659,715
Landon 13,976,139
Democrats apparently won a top
heavy 4-to-l control over Congress.
On the basis of latest returns they
held 340 House seats to 85 for Re
publicans—lowest Republican repre
sentation in the House since 1890. In
the Senate, Democrats apparently
will top Republicans by a 74-to-18
margin. Three Old Guard Republi
can incumbent senators were deci
sively beaten and two others trailing.
Greatest Sweep
Governor Landon's defeat was
even worse than that of Taft in 1912.
Each got eight electoral votes, but
Taft was running in a three-cornered
race against Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt. Landon had only one op
ponent.
The size and scope of the Roose
velt sweep was shown by the fact
that he led in states that have 523
of the nation's 531 electoral votes.
Only two states —Maine and Ver
mont—seemed safe for Governor
Landon and their electoral votes to
taled eight.
A total vote of between 43 mil
lion and 44 million was indicated —
a record. The 1932 vote was approx
imately 38 million.
Roosevelt: 3-2
Provided the present ratio of votes
is maintained—and it was fairly con
stant throughout the day—the final
tabulation should be approximately:
Roosevelt, 27 million; Landon, 17
million.
No other candidate for President
ever polled such a large vote as is
indicated for Mr. Roosevelt. In 1932
he defeated Herbert Hoover, 22 mil
lion to 15 million.
The President enters his next term
with a fair prospect of having an
increased majority in the House, al
ready overwhelmingly Democratic.
Election of 262 Democratic congress
men was conceded by Republicans.
Sixty-six other Democrats were
leading. It appeared possible that the
Democrats, now holding 322 of the
435 seats, might increase their ma
jority by 10 to 20 members.
Some Seats Doubtful
Although some Senate seats still
were in doubt, it appeared, on the
basis of available returns, that the
lineup in the upper chamber would
be:
Democrats, 73.
Republicans, 19.
Farmer - Laborites, 2 (Shipstead
and Lundgren of Minnesota).
Progressive, 1 (La Follettc of Wis
consin).
Independent, 1 (Norris of Nebras

taled eight.
A total vote of between 43 mil
lion and 44 million was indicated —
a record. The 1932 vote was approx
imately 38 million.
Roosevelt: 3-2
Provided the present ratio of votes
is maintained—and it was fairly con
stant throughout the day—the final
tabulation should be approximately:
Roosevelt, 27 million; Landon, 17
million.
No other candidate for President
ever polled such a large vote as is
indicated for Mr. Roosevelt. In 1932
he defeated Herbert Hoover, 22 mil
lion to 15 million.
The President enters his next term
with a fair prospect of having an
increased majority in the House, al
ready overwhelmingly Democratic.
Election of 262 Democratic congress
men was conceded by Republicans.
Sixty-six other Democrats were
leading. It appeared possible that the
Democrats, now holding 322 of the
435 seats, might increase their ma
jority by 10 to 20 members.
Some Seats Doubtful
Although some Senate seats still
were in doubt, it appeared, on the
basis of available returns, that the
lineup in the upper chamber would
be:
Democrats, 73.
Republicans, 19.
Farmer - Laborites, 2 (Shipstead
and Lundgren of Minnesota).
Progressive, 1 (La Follettc of Wis
consin).
Independent, 1 (Norris of Nebras

NEW YORK, Nov. 4 (U.R).—President Roosevelt, holding a 3 to 2 lead
over Governor Alf M. Landon, appeared today to he marching toward a
possible presidential plurality of in million votes.
He has heen returned to the White House by a landslide, according to
United Press election figures for approximately two-thirds of the nation's

121,637 voting precincts. In late af
ternoon the popular vote showed:
Roosevelt 22,659,715
Landon 13,976,139
Democrats apparently won a top
heavy 4-to-l control over Congress.
On the basis of latest returns they
held 340 House seats to 85 for Re
publicans—lowest Republican repre
sentation in the House since 1890. In
the Senate, Democrats apparently
will top Republicans by a 74-to-18
margin. Three Old Guard Republi
can incumbent senators were deci
sively beaten and two others trailing.
Greatest Sweep
Governor Landon's defeat was
even worse than that of Taft in 1912.
Each got eight electoral votes, but
Taft was running in a three-cornered
race against Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt. Landon had only one op
ponent.
The size and scope of the Roose
velt sweep was shown by the fact
that he led in states that have 523
of the nation's 531 electoral votes.
Only two states —Maine and Ver
mont—seemed safe for Governor
Landon and their electoral votes to
taled eight.
