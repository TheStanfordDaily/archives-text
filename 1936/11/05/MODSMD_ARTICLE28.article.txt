### 
New rules governing the use of
campus bulletin boards are: all ma
terial must be typewritten or print
ed; everything should be "well an
chored" to the board; and the mate
rial must be dated for a two-week
period, or re-dated, otherwise it will
be taken down.
Barbara Goodrich, Winifred Jean
Smith and Jean Cutler, appointed by
Ex Committee, decided on the rules
yesterday.
