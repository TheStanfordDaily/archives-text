# Stanford Holds Patent On Tricky Typewriter Device
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
Poor Cal! Once again she takes a
beating and once again Stanford
brings home the bacon—in the shape
of patent rights to the recent inven
tion of a Berkeley student.
It all began because Sergei Fo
menko Toman, young Russian stu
dent in the physics department at
U.C., happened to be a personal
friend of Berton J. Ballard, Stanford
instructor in journalism.
Attends Convention
Attending the California Newspa
per Publishers' convention held here
in October, 1935, Toman became in
terested in a discussion by the dele
gates of the need for a double mar
ginal aligning typewriter. Hitherto
photolithographic printing has been
greatly hampered by the lack of a
machine able to type with uniform
right-hand margins, to which read
ers are accustomed.
Laymen unfamiliar with the pho
tolithographic process may not
know that it offers a cheap method
of reproducing typing and other
printed matter. The desired material
is photographed and a zinc plate
taken directly from the photo, thus
eliminating the costly process of set
ting type.
Starts Work
Toman, under the impetus of Bal
lard, set to work to produce a ma
chine making possible even right
hand margins. In the Stanford Press
building he built a crude but suc
cessful model, submitted it to Uni
versity Press officials, and received
financial backing for further experi
ments. The University has now re
ceived a patent for the perfected in
vention.
The device is operated by a simple
adjustment made with the left hand
before typing each line of copy. This
causes space to be evenly distrib
uted along the line so that the mar
gin on the right-hand side is ex
actly even.
"Nine-tenths of the work of in

vention," 26-year-old Sergei states
modestly, "is to conceive of a de
sirable device. Once a problem is
framed, its solution is relatively
simple." But though the youthful,
retiring physicist makes light of his
achievements, his friend Ballard
hastens to commend them.
"Sergei is not only an inventor,"
he declared, "but he is musically in
clined, and an accomplished cook as
well." He further disclosed that To
man is an ardent opera and sym
phony fan —having studied music
before he went into physics — and,
moreover, he has perfected a ham
burger declared by competent crit
ics to be preferable to the ordinary
run of fried chicken."

brings home the bacon—in the shape
of patent rights to the recent inven
tion of a Berkeley student.
It all began because Sergei Fo
menko Toman, young Russian stu
dent in the physics department at
U.C., happened to be a personal
friend of Berton J. Ballard, Stanford
instructor in journalism.
Attends Convention
Attending the California Newspa
per Publishers' convention held here
in October, 1935, Toman became in
terested in a discussion by the dele
gates of the need for a double mar
ginal aligning typewriter. Hitherto
photolithographic printing has been
greatly hampered by the lack of a
machine able to type with uniform
right-hand margins, to which read
ers are accustomed.
Laymen unfamiliar with the pho
tolithographic process may not
know that it offers a cheap method
of reproducing typing and other
printed matter. The desired material
is photographed and a zinc plate
taken directly from the photo, thus
eliminating the costly process of set
ting type.
Starts Work
Toman, under the impetus of Bal
lard, set to work to produce a ma
chine making possible even right
hand margins. In the Stanford Press
building he built a crude but suc
cessful model, submitted it to Uni
versity Press officials, and received
financial backing for further experi
ments. The University has now re
ceived a patent for the perfected in
vention.
The device is operated by a simple
adjustment made with the left hand
before typing each line of copy. This
causes space to be evenly distrib
uted along the line so that the mar
gin on the right-hand side is ex
actly even.
"Nine-tenths of the work of in

vention," 26-year-old Sergei states
modestly, "is to conceive of a de
sirable device. Once a problem is
framed, its solution is relatively
simple." But though the youthful,
retiring physicist makes light of his
achievements, his friend Ballard
hastens to commend them.
"Sergei is not only an inventor,"
he declared, "but he is musically in
clined, and an accomplished cook as
well." He further disclosed that To
man is an ardent opera and sym
phony fan —having studied music
before he went into physics — and,
moreover, he has perfected a ham
burger declared by competent crit
ics to be preferable to the ordinary
run of fried chicken."
Poor Cal! Once again she takes a
beating and once again Stanford
brings home the bacon—in the shape
of patent rights to the recent inven
tion of a Berkeley student.
