# Councils Issue Hints on Code
## Student Leaders Aim For Honorable Conduct 
### 
Endeavoring to aid Stanford stu
dents to understand the Honor Code,
a keystone in the building of Stan
ford character, Men's and Women's
Councils issued the following sug
gestions for conduct during exams:
1. Sit in alternate seats. This is not
only for comfort, but also to lessen
distraction and to insure each stu
dent from being unknowingly in
volved in a violation.
2. If classrooms are too small for
this method, students should sug
gest to the professors that other
rooms should be used. The faculty
has indicated its willingness to co
operate.
3. In case of any suspected cheat
ing in an exam, tapping with pen or
pencil on the desk is an indication
that cheating is suspected and is a
very good warning.
4. Conversation in an exam may
be entirely harmless, but it can bo
looked on with suspicion. It is sug
gested that conversation be cut to a
minimum.
5. Writing out the full honor
pledge—"No unpermitted aid given
or received"—with the full signature
is necessary for each student to feel
that he has carried out the spirit and
ideal of the code.
