# Frosh Out To Regain Fame In Cal Bout
## Members of '40 Hit On Scheme To Recapture Lost Mudfight Glory 
### 
Having been the first class in mod
ern history to bow before the sopho
mores in the now extinct mudfight,
certain members of the Class of '40
have hit upon a plan whereby they
hope to regain their prestige.
Thirty-six frosh are intent on ac
complishing something which hasn't
been done in the memory* of the
present Stanford generation. They
comprise the football squad, and
have a desperate ambition to beat
the California Cubs when they meet
on the Berkeley gridiron Saturday.
Situation Promising
Chances that the frosh will be suc
cessful in their latest quest grew
brighter when it was revealed that
Perry Connor, place-kicking Bear
guard, has been relegated to the
sidelines as a result of a twisted knee
sustained while playing against Ma
rin J.C. last Saturday. However the
return to action of left halfback Ted
Hubert partially makes up for the
loss of the man with the educated
toe.
The Stanfords themselves have a
clean bill of health and are doing no
scrimmaging this week, being an
xious to steer clear of the hospital
while preparing for Cal.
A significant change in backfield
personnel found Jack Grover, 150-
pound Kansas boy, a probable starter
at quarterback. Grover's greatest
asset is the rapiditly with which he
can get his high spiral kicks away.
Gene Coldiron will alternate with
the Kansan at quarter.
Walker at Right Half
Tom Walker, hero of the U.C.LA.
game, is billed to start at right half,
with Jerry Sparling held in reserve.
Left half spot goes to Chad Reade,
the slippery San Franciscan, and
Howard Hickingbotham is a likely
starter at fullback. Rod Parker and
Chet Patton are other fullbacking
possibilities.
