AND. FROM
Tilt OLD SCHOOL:
As I look about this Los Angeles
Coliseum it strikes me that lor a
party who has traveled a thousand
miles to every Big Game without a
miss since 1921. 1 know surprisingly
little about this game.
This standing and running guard
business is beyond me. In my day
both guards fell down to furnish a
sluice through which the fullback
was thrown by the halves. Mean
while the quai'terback, whose duties
were largely conversational, was al
ready calling the cryptogram for the
next play.
My technology may be a little
weak after 30 years, but it seems to_
me that the work of Stanford's in
side five-eighths was a little loose in
the scrum. Well, just as Klauber '37
might take a few pointers from
Klauber '08 on the non-necessity of
splitting all infinitives, and the dis
tinction between "like" and "as," so
also American football might take a
lesson or two from its pop, Rugby.
Kicking into touch was adopted by
the child several years back. Some
day rules and tactics will put into
our game something to equal the
lateral passing rush of Rugby, the
greatest sight in any country's foot
ball.
That blocked punt by Zagar in the
first inning was the cleanest I have
seen in many a game. How often this
kind of thing is followed by mur
murs throughout the stands, "What's
the matter with Funk? His shoes
must be untied; he's lost all distance
and accuracy." Of course he has; he
doesn't have time to get them away.
LA lIONDA. ROSE
BOWL CHAMP
This brings to mind the fact that
comparisons between successive ap
pearances of a team are meaningless
without taking strongly into account
the nature of the opposition. Milpitas
may look wondei-ful against Alviso.
The reverses click without a miss,
the passes find receivers parked
alone in great open spaces, and the
punts reach the mortuary angles
with unerring accuracy.
But the following week when Mil
pitas plays LaHonda, it is an en
tirely different story. The backs do
not seem to get started; the passes
sail away with no predetermined
destination and are usually inter
cepted; the punts are leaden and
erratic. Everyone says, "Well, well,
the boys got the swelled head last
week." Or, "That's what comes of
breaking training rules." Or, "When
everybody goes out for all-Ameri
can, where's the teamwork."
As a matter of fact, of course, the
change isn't in Milpitas at all; it is
the difference between LaHonda and
Alviso that tells the story. LaHonda
has a line that gets through to smear
the plays before they get started.
The triple-threat man in the back
field has learned by sad experience
in the first three plays that he has to
shed the ball fast, even if George, the
receiver, has not yet reached the
40 deg. 33 min. N., Long. 116 deg.
3 min. W.
I like this Brigham on his bucks.
Looks like old times —Jim Weller, I
mean.

There is more excitement in
watching a ganje that is not a set-up
than the best predoped certainty
ever played.
EISENBACH—A PEBBLE
ON THE BEACH
Bob Eisenbach does not worry me.
I do not know his mom, and she is
the important member of the team.
By the time you read this. Bob will
either be saying, "I told you so," or,
"What's the difference?". The frantic
excitement of college columnists and
their pet peeves change less from
year to year than do the courses of
staid professors only half a step
from emeritus. 1 * '
I remember when the first auto
mobile was permitted to stray up a
side-road to the Row. This was long
after the new machines had shown
that they might some day be useful
accessories to transportation, but
their presence in the vicinity of the
more austere temples of knowledge
was still considered ultra-convicial.
The result of the new order gave
Pro Bono Publico and Constant
Reader an opportunity which filled
the columns of the Dirty Parlor
Doily (as The Daily was then called)
far into the next semester. But the
autos came anyway.

might take a few pointers from
Klauber '08 on the non-necessity of
splitting all infinitives, and the dis
tinction between "like" and "as," so
also American football might take a
lesson or two from its pop, Rugby.
Kicking into touch was adopted by
the child several years back. Some
day rules and tactics will put into
our game something to equal the
lateral passing rush of Rugby, the
greatest sight in any country's foot
ball.
That blocked punt by Zagar in the
first inning was the cleanest I have
seen in many a game. How often this
kind of thing is followed by mur
murs throughout the stands, "What's
the matter with Funk? His shoes
must be untied; he's lost all distance
and accuracy." Of course he has; he
doesn't have time to get them away.

BOWL CHAMP
This brings to mind the fact that
comparisons between successive ap
pearances of a team are meaningless
without taking strongly into account
the nature of the opposition. Milpitas
may look wondei-ful against Alviso.
The reverses click without a miss,
the passes find receivers parked
alone in great open spaces, and the
punts reach the mortuary angles
with unerring accuracy.
But the following week when Mil
pitas plays LaHonda, it is an en
tirely different story. The backs do
not seem to get started; the passes
sail away with no predetermined
destination and are usually inter
cepted; the punts are leaden and
erratic. Everyone says, "Well, well,
the boys got the swelled head last
week." Or, "That's what comes of
breaking training rules." Or, "When
everybody goes out for all-Ameri
can, where's the teamwork."
As a matter of fact, of course, the
change isn't in Milpitas at all; it is
the difference between LaHonda and
Alviso that tells the story. LaHonda
has a line that gets through to smear
the plays before they get started.
The triple-threat man in the back
field has learned by sad experience
in the first three plays that he has to
shed the ball fast, even if George, the
receiver, has not yet reached the
40 deg. 33 min. N., Long. 116 deg.

and accuracy." Of course he has; he
doesn't have time to get them away.
LA lIONDA. ROSE
BOWL CHAMP
This brings to mind the fact that
comparisons between successive ap
pearances of a team are meaningless
without taking strongly into account
the nature of the opposition. Milpitas
may look wondei-ful against Alviso.
The reverses click without a miss,
the passes find receivers parked
alone in great open spaces, and the
punts reach the mortuary angles
with unerring accuracy.
But the following week when Mil
pitas plays LaHonda, it is an en
tirely different story. The backs do
not seem to get started; the passes
sail away with no predetermined
destination and are usually inter
cepted; the punts are leaden and
erratic. Everyone says, "Well, well,
the boys got the swelled head last
week." Or, "That's what comes of
breaking training rules." Or, "When
everybody goes out for all-Ameri
can, where's the teamwork."
As a matter of fact, of course, the
change isn't in Milpitas at all; it is
the difference between LaHonda and
Alviso that tells the story. LaHonda
has a line that gets through to smear
the plays before they get started.
The triple-threat man in the back
field has learned by sad experience
in the first three plays that he has to
shed the ball fast, even if George, the
receiver, has not yet reached the
40 deg. 33 min. N., Long. 116 deg.
3 min. W.
I like this Brigham on his bucks.
Looks like old times —Jim Weller, I

There is more excitement in
watching a ganje that is not a set-up
than the best predoped certainty
ever played.

Bob Eisenbach does not worry me.
I do not know his mom, and she is
the important member of the team.
By the time you read this. Bob will
either be saying, "I told you so," or,
"What's the difference?". The frantic
excitement of college columnists and
their pet peeves change less from
year to year than do the courses of
staid professors only half a step
from emeritus. 1 * '
I remember when the first auto
mobile was permitted to stray up a
side-road to the Row. This was long
after the new machines had shown
that they might some day be useful
accessories to transportation, but
their presence in the vicinity of the
more austere temples of knowledge
was still considered ultra-convicial.
The result of the new order gave
Pro Bono Publico and Constant

far into the next semester. But the

AND. FROM
Tilt OLD SCHOOL:
As I look about this Los Angeles
Coliseum it strikes me that lor a
party who has traveled a thousand
miles to every Big Game without a
miss since 1921. 1 know surprisingly
little about this game.
This standing and running guard
business is beyond me. In my day
both guards fell down to furnish a
sluice through which the fullback
was thrown by the halves. Mean
while the quai'terback, whose duties
were largely conversational, was al
ready calling the cryptogram for the
next play.
My technology may be a little
weak after 30 years, but it seems to_
me that the work of Stanford's in
side five-eighths was a little loose in
the scrum. Well, just as Klauber '37
might take a few pointers from
Klauber '08 on the non-necessity of
splitting all infinitives, and the dis
tinction between "like" and "as," so
also American football might take a
lesson or two from its pop, Rugby.
Kicking into touch was adopted by
the child several years back. Some
day rules and tactics will put into
our game something to equal the
lateral passing rush of Rugby, the
greatest sight in any country's foot
ball.
That blocked punt by Zagar in the
first inning was the cleanest I have
seen in many a game. How often this
kind of thing is followed by mur
murs throughout the stands, "What's
the matter with Funk? His shoes
must be untied; he's lost all distance
and accuracy." Of course he has; he
doesn't have time to get them away.
