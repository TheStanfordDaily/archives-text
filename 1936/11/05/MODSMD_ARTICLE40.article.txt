### 
A better clicking squad, more ex
perienced mounts, and offense im
provements give Coach Captain
Grubbs hopes of stopping the pow
erful Castro Valley Ranch team in
the return match to be played to
morrow on the local field. Leon
Derby, regular No. 1 who has been
out with bronchitis, is back, but both
he and the rest of the first team will
see less action as it is intended to
make many second team substitu
tions.
As the previous Castro Valley
game was the first of the season, the
squad didn't get going until the
third chukker. Then it was already
too late, but the Cardinals are get
ting smoother all the time now, and
they are going to show a new of
fensive form as the result of this
week's practice.
Both teams will probably have the
same starting line-up. The Stanford
opening team will again find Russ
Rasmussen at number 1, Leon Derby
at number 2, Jim Fullerton at num
ber 3, and Captain Bob Fullerton in
the back spot. Playing for the ranch
team will be Pat Linfoot. Will Tevis,
Warren Hellman, and Dick Lausner.
