# Freshmen Start Hoop Season
## Alternate Sqads Seen By Coach Wytze Gorter 
### 
Dreams of having two or three
teams which will work through the
entire season as units, to be inter
changed during games as is done
with the Southern Cal football team,
fill the mind of Freshman Basketball
Coach Wvtze Gorter as he lays plans
for the season.
One small, fast unit and one or
possibly two talL rugged, and strong
squads, with not more than one or
two substitutes apiece, strike Gorter
as the logical solution to the problem
created by the presence of 10 or 12
men of almost equal ability.
Outside of the first four or five
merf who may be put into a top class
as the outstanding, there is a large
group which is almost uniform, and
from which Gorter figures to set up
two teams to play together without
change throughout the season.
In this gang there are enough for a
"small" team, averaging about five
eleven in height, which would be the
fast outfit Gorter sees as a weapon to
force the opponents for a short time.
Then, as the team to go in and mop
up on the not-so-fresli-as-when
they-started enemy, will be one of
the two "big" teams, which will av
erage around six-one or six-two.
For the first team, the standouts
seem to be Lew Staehle, Tom Sei

1 bert, Bob Moulton, Ted Lyon, and
Leon LaFaille. LaFaille has been
having trouble ever since practice
started with bum dogs, but he looks
like the candy to Gorter if and
when he gets going. However, these
men are all quite vulnerable in their
position, with many of the second
group starting to show signs of rapid
development.
