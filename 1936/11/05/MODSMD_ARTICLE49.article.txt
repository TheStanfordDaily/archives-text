Like the man in North Carolina who beat the
same brass drum for fifty years (Stanford Daily
filler), The Daily carries on for a genuine Nitery,
not just a "twi-litery" as Bullsessioner Eisenbach
puts it today. The golf clubhouse has not as yet
been tried, but its distant location may put it
into the discard. It conflicts with the basic rea
son for a Nitery—that of having some place that
is accessible to all.
The lobby of the old Union will come up for
its second trial tomorrow night, but even a
renovated Union lobby cannot supply the color
that is needed for a real campus rendezvous.
The suggestion of adding a unit to the Union
group has its rather fine points, but cannot
compare with a nite-spot at Lake Lagunita. Not
a Nitery built out of the old boathouse, but a
complete new building, modern in every detail
—a place that will be included in the Pacific
Greyhound tours along with the Angel of Grief
and the Mausoleum.
Henry Hughes, junior transfer living in Se
quoia, went to last week's dance and on going
home sat down and drew up an all-color sketch
for such a Nitery. He roughly estimates the
over-all cost at about $6000. Included in his
proposed one-story building is a fully eguipped
SlOOO soda fountain at one end of the main
room—decorated not in the dull Cellar style
but in that of a tasteful but modern Steve Brodie
siloon.
The drawing was made with the idea in view
of having this Nitery located on the east side
of the Lake, but set far enough back from the
water level so that in the fall and winter the
now dry lakebed would not be too evident.
But there are hopes, though they may be far
distant, that Lake Lagunita will not always be
rented out during the summer to grow corn in,
but that when students return to school in the
fc-11 there still will be water in Lagunita along
with the 9000 acres to play in.
Back in the head of Comptroller Almon E.
Poth is the idea that the University might build
p. reservoir up near Searsville Lake—the largest
of the "Stanford Lakes"—that would store up
water for the University in no small manner. If
such a project goes through, the University al
ready has an agreement with the Bear Gulch
Water District which lies back of Stanford and
Atherton to take some of this water for their
own purpose, starting two years from this lan
uary.
But more than this little side scheme, this
proposed reservoir also would give the Uni
versity a great deal more water for irrigation
purposes. As most of the boathouse languishers
already know, the main reason why Lagunita
dries up so quickly in the spring is because the
v/ater is drained out for irrigation of campus
trees and gardens. But according to Mr. Roth,
if this proposed new water supply were made
available, not so much water would need be
taken from Lagunita, and in years of good
rainfall it might even be possible to keep water
in Lagunita all year around. So it is more than
likely that a Lagunita Shore Nitery would not
always face out onto a dry lakebed.
Now of course, there are always those parsi
monious individuals who want to know where
the money for such a Nitery will come from.
And here is where we hark back to the old
Spring Quarter Dollar that played such a heavy
part in Ex Committee proceedings this year and
last.
It was decided that this dollar should be kept
on the spring quarter tuition and the approxi
mately 53500 that would be taken in would be
divided equally between the Student Aid Fund
.ind the Now Theater Fund. Recognizing the
fact that the Student Aid Fund is a very worthy

thing, it also appears that a good Nitery would
be a very fine thing. Now it also appears that
the Student Aid Fund already received 54500
from Bookstore profits, but it does not appear
that there is any apparent money available for
the construction of a clubhouse.
As to the $1750 contribution to a $500,000 The
ater Fund, it is a mere drop in this proverbial
bucket. But if half of the proceeds from the
Spring Quarter Dollar were also turned over to
the construction of a $6000 Nitery, two spring
quarters would see the building and its Bohe
mian furnishings mortgage free, and by that
time a Searsville reservoir might keep the lake
partially full all year.
This half-million dollar theater is being pro
vided for the few dramatic minded students to
experiment, perform, and play in while the
others come to watch. But for the more than few
students who want an informal place to dance
in, there should be a new place.
Big obstacle to building such a Nitery is ad
ministrative fear that student's wouldn't patron
ize it. A continuation of the crowd that made
a success of last Saturday night's dance and the
one after "Roadside" tomorrow night will show
that even unfavorable conditions such a Nitery
would be catering to a demand.
