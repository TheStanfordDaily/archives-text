BULLETS OR BOLOGNA
There are two ways to get immediate executive
action at Stanford: commit suicide in front of the Ad
Building or attack the ramparts on San Juan Hill.
A nitery makes no impression. Now that the stu
dent body has finally won a twi-litery, this same
thought has occurred to many a valiant battler for
the public good: they cannot regard their work as
achievement, but as victory.
They have beaten the foe. And what a foe it was.
Swimming before their red-eyes even today are the
blank faces of a gross of secretaries, the blanker faces
of desk-stooges. Their minds are tired from trying to
get a hold on underling's who can do nothing but make
slippery excuses.
If they never knew it before, they realize that Stan
ford is tied up like a Christmas package—with stick
ers -and red tape. The card reads: "Not to be opened
until we're good and ready."

That the whole top-heavy system is the result of
stupidity, not cautious and well-developed intelligence,
seems obvious. Or is it stupidity? The way Stanford's
executive departments react when something serious
happens isn't stupid.
We can never forget the fine afternoon last spring
when some one mistakenly flashed the police on a
Lagunita drowning. It seemed only seconds before
Gordie Davis' siren screamed past The Daily shack, in
his wake high-placed administration executives.
The Ad Building boys covered the situation like
Hearst covered Landon.

And the Lord unquestionably finds such conscien
tiousness good. But he would also approve, perhaps
more heartily, that Stanford stooges and stooge-drivers
believe in direct action on the little things in life.
Without reservations, it is obvious that the nitery
situation could have been cleared up even though Mr.
Masters was down South and in full charge of the
golf clubhouse at Ihe same time. Reasonably, the
administration should have jumped at the desire of
students to have fun on the Farm. That they didn't so
jump is explainable only one way: they didn't even
hear about it.
Instead, enterprising students were wasting their
time talking to people whose business in life is saying
"I can't do anything for you. You'll have to see Mr.
McWhaf."
So we make this suggestion: next time the collec
tive students want anything, they either barricade oi
march, with pistols to their heads, up and down the
Ad Building stairs. Only one person need shoot lim
self to get the reaction, however.
