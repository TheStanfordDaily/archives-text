Political Note: Mr. Petrie, Palo Alto high church
disciple of Apostle Townscnd, is not holding forth on
the Library steps as he used to, but his spirit is march
ing on nonetheless.
The Socratic Mr. Petrie apparently did not find
enough students to subscribe to the Townscnd monthly
dues in the market place of knowledge, as it were, and
wanted the more academic approach of the lecture
platform. So he asked to be let on the all-University
political forum of last week.
Officials turned him down because his speech was
not political. At this, Mr. Petrie set up a terrific
moan. "What is the idea," he asked in his elephantine
soprano. "You won't let me speak this time because
my speech is not political, and last year the University
officials refused me permission to talk in the Little
Theater on the grounds that it was."
As far as the election is concerned, Professor Walter
Thompson of the Poly Sci Department pretty well sums
the whole matter up in the revealing statement: "As
Maine goes, so goes Vermont."
An instructor in the same department endeavored
to exercise a rational attitude toward the state propo
sitions 1 to 24. Now the only proposition he cared about
was proposition 22, so he went to one of these meetings
called to argue over the propositions. There an Econ
prof went through the list for the audience, and wound
up on 22, admitting that he supported it not on eco
nomic, but on humanitarian grounds. The political
scientist disagreed with the humanitarian stand on
economic grounds, but he marked it on his sample
ballot as a representation of the sentiment of the meet
ing. Now when the political scientist got in his booth
on election day he didn't care very much about the
other measures and started barreling down the yes
nos-no-yesses; he went right through number 22 and
marked it "yes." He now hopes that he, at least, is a
humanitarian.
There is a Dcke who is a football player and who
is in love with a Theta and who cats some of his
meals at the Dcke house. The Dekes seem to be aware
that he is in love with a Theta and that he eats some
of his meals at the Deke house; so they kid him at the
table about his Theta affiliation, which does not bother
him at all, because lie bares his feelings and says.
"I love her, to heck with you guys." Which leaves the
brothers in Delta Kappa Kpsilon with no come-back
at all.

Theater on the grounds that it was."
As far as the election is concerned, Professor Walter
Thompson of the Poly Sci Department pretty well sums
the whole matter up in the revealing statement: "As
Maine goes, so goes Vermont."
An instructor in the same department endeavored
to exercise a rational attitude toward the state propo
sitions 1 to 24. Now the only proposition he cared about
was proposition 22, so he went to one of these meetings
called to argue over the propositions. There an Econ
prof went through the list for the audience, and wound
up on 22, admitting that he supported it not on eco
nomic, but on humanitarian grounds. The political
scientist disagreed with the humanitarian stand on
economic grounds, but he marked it on his sample
ballot as a representation of the sentiment of the meet
ing. Now when the political scientist got in his booth
on election day he didn't care very much about the
other measures and started barreling down the yes
nos-no-yesses; he went right through number 22 and
marked it "yes." He now hopes that he, at least, is a
humanitarian.
There is a Dcke who is a football player and who
is in love with a Theta and who cats some of his
meals at the Dcke house. The Dekes seem to be aware
that he is in love with a Theta and that he eats some
of his meals at the Deke house; so they kid him at the
table about his Theta affiliation, which does not bother
him at all, because lie bares his feelings and says.
"I love her, to heck with you guys." Which leaves the
brothers in Delta Kappa Kpsilon with no come-back
at all.
Political Note: Mr. Petrie, Palo Alto high church
disciple of Apostle Townscnd, is not holding forth on
the Library steps as he used to, but his spirit is march
ing on nonetheless.
The Socratic Mr. Petrie apparently did not find
enough students to subscribe to the Townscnd monthly
dues in the market place of knowledge, as it were, and
wanted the more academic approach of the lecture
platform. So he asked to be let on the all-University
political forum of last week.
Officials turned him down because his speech was
not political. At this, Mr. Petrie set up a terrific
moan. "What is the idea," he asked in his elephantine
soprano. "You won't let me speak this time because
my speech is not political, and last year the University
officials refused me permission to talk in the Little
Theater on the grounds that it was."
