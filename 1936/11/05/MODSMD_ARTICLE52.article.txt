SAN FRANCISCO OPERA II
To those who heard the Philadel
phia symphony orchestra play the
love music from Tristan and Isolde
last year, the performance of the
opera Monday night was of particu
lar interest. The orchestra was still
there with'its shimmering strings, its
clear horns, its woodwinds, but it
was there to complement the human
voice. Instruments echoed and re
inforced, but no longer replaced,
personalities.
Wagner is never trivial; even when
he is expressing the emotion of love,
it is a grandiose emotion; the prin
cipals are superhuman people whose
tragedy is as immense as their
statures. Kirsten Flagstad was a
beautiful Isolde. Except for an in
terval in the third act, she was on

the stage most pf the time, singing
with that effortless, glorious voice.
Unlike other stars she never heaves,
scarcely seems to breath when she
sings. Her "Liebestod" sung to the
dead Tristan, brings "the most
beautiful erotic music ever written"
to its end.
Kathryn Meisle, who appeared last
week at Stanford, was splendid as
the sorrowing Brangane, her rich
voice capable of surmounting Wag
ner's symphonic score. Lauritz Mel
chior gave a warmth to the role of
Tristan, but may have suffered a
slight cold. Emanuel List and Fried
rich Schorr contributed to the dis
tinguished cast as King Mark and
Kurvenal, servant to Tristan.
An enthusiast next to me breathed,
"This is opera!" It was.
