The Editor, Sir:
Somebody attempting to discredit
or embarrass the Stanford Browder-
Ford Club marked those 200 forged
ballots in Thursday's straw vote.
Obviously it was someone who
realized lhat this "crime"—if gen
erally believed—would reflect on the
campus Browder - for - President
Club; the one who did the act didn't
mean it as any aid. Such a clumsy
attempt reminds one of the Mooney
case or the burning of the Reichstag.
