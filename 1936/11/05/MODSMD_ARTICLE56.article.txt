# FAVORS 'REVIVALS'
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now you're talking. I have just
read that the Barnstormers would
like to "revive old motion pictures
for Stanford audiences." What we
want are some early Chaplins, Ben
Hur, and Theda Bara, silent though
they may be, and streaked with use
though they are. Let's have some
really old revivals, silents.
I should think that there would be
little cost connected with showing
these pictures, as no sound equip
ment would be needed, and I have'
heard that in some colleges in the
East they have regular releases of
very old silents. Can't we get in on
this? It's a great idea and well
worth at least a try. Many of us
can't even remember a silent picture.
