# DON'T CALL IT A SCHOOL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In recent years it has become the
habit of Stanford students to refer
to the university as a "school." The
use of that word in referring to the
university is entirely incorrect. A
university is composed of several
schools, colleges, or departments, and
in some instances, institutes. Ordi
narily, the word school refers to
some secondary institution.
Of course if one is attending the
Stanford Medical School in San
Francisco, it is perfectly proper to
refer to that separate institution as a
school. However, in conversation
and in writing it is always referred
to as "the school." Let us call Stan
ford what it really is, a university
and not a school.
