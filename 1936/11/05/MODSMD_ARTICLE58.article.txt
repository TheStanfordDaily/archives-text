# SISSY-KISSERS ALL

The Editor, Sir:
Not so long ago I wrote an opin
ion suggesting a fitting burial for the I
old rough. Since then many things
have happened; one sissy kisser re- j
sponded that he would not dare be
seen in moleskins, sweat shirt,, etc.; !
another article suggested that Stan
ford had changed from a college to a
university; and now I see where the
university is changing into a night 1
club.
When Stanford was a college the
freshmen had no trouble getting
into the shows on the night of the
pajamarino. Why? Simply because
if the shows did not let them in they
KNEW that they would lose the
Stanford patronage. Today with the
sissy kissers around and also the
| night clubbers, they KNOW that

nothing will happen. May I weep
once more for the passing of the
rough and the changing from a col
lege to a university and night club.
