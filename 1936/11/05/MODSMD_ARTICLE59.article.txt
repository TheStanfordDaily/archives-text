ROVER BOYS IN EUROPE
One of the Rover Boys, who spent
the summer touring Europe with his
brother on Tom Swift's motorcycle,
is back at Stanford again as an au
thority on the situation in Europe.
For some time he has been recog
nized as knowing just how to shift
gears with your knee when driving
a gondola down the Grand Canal in
Venice, but this morning he has
gone serious-minded and now dis
cusses foreign affairs. By foreign af
fairs he does not mean the business
of King Edward and friend, but
rather the recent stuff in the papers
about how the Italians are trying to
make the English lion purr like a
pussy-cat.

In words of one syllable this as
tute Rover Boy explains the terri
fying topic of projected Anglo-
Italian amnesty. He says that the
Italians hate the limeys and tells, as
a case in point, the story of himself
and his brother in Italy. They took
their motorcycle into the Harley-
Davidson agency in Rome to get it
checked over. While they were
waiting, they got talking to the girl
secretary. She asked them if they
were English in a tone she would use
in asking them if they were snakes.
When they said they were Ameri
cans, she put on her best smile and
told them that all Italians hated the
British, but they like Americans be
cause the Americans won the war.
Now this was a startling assertion,
for even though all Europe knows
America won the war, they are not
in the habit of admitting as much.
All this was soon explained, how
ever, for it turned out that by the
war they meant the Ethiopian War.
It has been a serious business for
them, and they hate the English be
cause the British oil sanctions prac
tically hamstrung the Italian Army
frying out in Ethiopia. If the Amer
icans had cut off the oil supply, the
Italian Army would really have
folded for good, but we are still in
business for profit, the oil kept going
to Italy, and the Americans came to
be regarded as the original Friendly
Indians.

Now all this about England and
Italy is dull stuff, but the point is
that America really had a chance to
stop a war, for once, if she had sided
in with the League of Nations.
Which should come as a disconcert
ing fact to those who wave the
American flag in one hand and -the
San Francisco Examiner in the other
and vow that they, too, like George
Washington, believe America should
live like a gopher.
