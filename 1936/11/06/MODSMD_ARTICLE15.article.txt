# Fisher Describes Soviet Politics To New Events Class
## U.S.S.R. Needs 'Peace Above All' for Five Year Plan's Success 
### 
Soviet Russia is devoting its en
ergies to founding a self-sufficient
socialistic nation instead of hoping
for a world revolution for commu
nism, H. H. Fisher, professor of his
tory, told the new Current Events
class yesterday.
World political developments, par
ticularly the Nazi movement in Ger-
and Japan's occupation of
vlanchukuo, have made it impera
tive for the U.S.S.R. to line up
riendly nations in case of another
world war, Fisher declared.
"Russia did not openly aid the
I'panish socialist government in the
( irrent rebellion," he explained,
"because to do so would probably
have increased German and Italian
a.d to the Fascists. If all Europe
t( ok sides, the threat of general war
w >uld be too dangerous. And for
si ccess of the second five-year plan,
tli? U.S.S.R needs peace above all."
The new Russian constitution,
tli nigh still not in effect, points
to.vard more democracy in its uni
v< sal suffrage clause, the professor
. ii'd, but the selection of candidates
is till pretty much in the hands of
th Communist party.
I isher explained that although the
fiv -year plans have been partially
successful in industrializing Rus
i,i. , particularly as to armament
n lufacturing, the U.S.S.R. is still
fa; behind Germany, Great Britain,
an the United States as an indus
trial nation.
