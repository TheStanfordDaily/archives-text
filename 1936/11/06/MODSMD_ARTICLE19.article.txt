# Men's Rushing Schedule Set
## 
### 
Rushing continues this week-end
with three Friday and two Saturday
dates available to the time-pressed
frosh.
Regarding the much-maligned
Friday midnight, closing time, the
fraternities wish to make it under
stood that although the rushing cards
may indicate that hour of departure,
the frosh need feel no hesitancy in
leaving earlier if they so desire.
All houses taking rushees to the
game Saturday are asked to get to
the game as soon as possible in order
not to have a large crowd arriving
in the rooters section after the start
of the game, according to Bob Hoo
ver, president of the Interfraternity
Council.
