# Rooters Root At Soph Rally Dance
## 
### 
Over 230 students danced, popped
balloons, yelled for Stanford foot
ball men and watched U.C.L.A. game
pictures last night at the first campus
rally dance, sponsored by the sopho
more class. Red and white paper
rooting caps and whistles were given
away at the door and cartoons of the
triumphing Stanford Indian hung on
the walls.
Between the dance and the show
ing of the movies Jimmy Coffis,
Louis Tsout'souvas, and Joe Vigna
were introduced by Webb Jones, and
"Doodles" Weaver sang "Nobody's
Sweetheart Now" to the accompani
ment of George Mailer's orchestra.
Since the sophs were not having ?
formal rally the dance was a success
said "Sandy" Lowengart. Harry Mor
ton, also of the Rally Committee and
chairman of the affair, asked, "If this
sort of thing isn't continued, why
not?"
