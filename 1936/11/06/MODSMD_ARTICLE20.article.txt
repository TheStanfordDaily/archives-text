Burt Goodman was elected presi
dent of the Inter-Club Council when
that body met yesterday in the Los
Arcos clubroom. Other officers for
the year are Carlton Thomas, vice
president; and Chic Gadsby, secre
tary-treasurer. Activities for the
year were discussed, including rush
ing and an inter-club dance to be
held in the Toyon lobby.
"In my v/ay of thinking," said
Temporary Chairman Leroy Wright,
"retract and enter more into campus
activities in order to check the ris
ing prestige of the fraternities."
