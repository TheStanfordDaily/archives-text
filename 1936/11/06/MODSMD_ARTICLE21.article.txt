# Mails Reveal Freshman Loves, Hopes, Sorrows
## Soph Writes Home About Initiation, Sinus, Milk 
### MARGARET LOUD 
There's something wrong with the
Cardinals' unofficial dale bureau. At
least that's the opinion of one love
lorn Roble freshman who has ig
nored the bureau and decided to
get her dates by using the fan mail
stuff that most of us wrote on slates
in fourth grade grammar school.
The Robleite didn't use a slate but
sent the following message to a se
cret sorrow through the Stanford
post office: "My dear Edgar, My
girl-friend and I see you almost
every day on the Quad. She has got
an awful crush on you, but she is
very shy so she is afraid to speak to
you. We found out your name from
a friend of ours. Helen is dying to
meet you and I think it would be
awfully nice if you could call on her
or take her out somewhere. I know
she'd be thrilled to death.
Tall, Darkâ€”Handsome?
'"She is quite tall and has black
hair and eyes. You'll like her a lot
I'm sure. Incidentally, she loves to
dance.
"From your looks, I know that you
are the type of person who will un
derstand this, and I can assure you
that you won't be disappointed if
you look her up ... .
"For obvious reasons, I'm not sign
ing my name. Sincerely, A Roble
ite."
Other unfortunates besides the
lovesick freshman who have en
trusted their secret troubles to Un
cle Sam's mails are also having them
exposed. The following, from a soph
going through hell week, is now
tacked up with other misaddressed
penny postcards on the post office
bulletin board. "Dear Pop, We are
right in the middle of initiation so
I can't write you much of a letter.
We have to be in bed every night
although they get us up at 11:30,
give us a workout until about 1.
Tonight we have to be in our rooms
by 8, so I guess they will work us
out for about 4 hours tonight. Dave
just came in and he said that tonight
was the last of informal but formal
was Sunday.
Dairymen, Please Note
"Sinus has stopped running but I
must still use the drops every morn
ing. I get a glass of milk in the
morning and a pint for lunch and
dinner. Ben is not playing football.
Love, Charles. P.S. More later."
Another freshman, evidently a
football player, writes the following
optimistic message, also on the bul
letin board. "Everything is line,
school has quite a bit of studying,
but I have to expect that. I received
$15 today that I paid for eating the
first 2 weeks before school so it
didn't cost me anything for the two
weeks. I get very fine food and ev
erything is fine."

from Devil's Island, the French
Guiana convict colony, in 1933.
