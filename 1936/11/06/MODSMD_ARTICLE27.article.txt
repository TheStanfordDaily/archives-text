hunted for new faces, figures, and
voices all over the world for the
picture studios.
"There is no pre-registration re
quired,"' said Sulzbacher. All those
who come to the auditions will have
a chance to try out. Anything goesâ€”
singers, musicians, actors, skits, and
even comedians. We will furnish an
accompanist, but students must bring
their own music. From those who
audition, we will choose an indefinite
number of acts to appear on Stan
ford's program."
