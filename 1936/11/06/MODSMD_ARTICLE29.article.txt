SHOUT STORY: WE
GET 'EM DOWN HERE

Bobby Grayson said a while back,
when speaking of the Washington
Huskies, "Thank God, we get them
down here this year."
Bobby meant that one thing is
certain: Washington never showed
much in the warm climes of the
Stanford Stadium. Out of six starts
here they have won two.
The first was 12-8 in 1922. Every
body beat Stanford in 1922; if you
didn't, you weren't out of the J. C.
class. The second was in 1932, ten
years later. This game wasn't great
shucks, either; the Huskies had a
poor season both before and after,
and one of the weakest of Warner's
teams was in the bottom of one of
its synelines.
Washington scored all of theirs
early, and Stanford pushed two
scores over in the second half when
Coach Phelan had sent in his re
serves. The 7000 people who came
out of their burrows to see it didn't
seem to care.
In 1934, though, the jinx got back
into action. The Huskies came to
Palo Alto undefeated, a strong soph
omore squad thought by the North
west to be as close to perfect as any.

Well, Reynolds, Topping, Grayson
and the "Laughing Boys" look them
24-0, three converted touchdowns
and a field goal, playing perhaps one
of the best collective games of their
long and successful Stanford career.
Maybe it was because the year be
fore their only defeat had been at
Washington's hands, 6-0, from two
field goals kicked by all-American
End Bill Smith in the rain and slush
of Seattle.
The 1935 game, up there last year,
is also important in this series, be
cause it will probably be hung in
front of the Husky nose this week as
a firebrand.
P'nelan's gang, then juniors, were
hot again, undefeated. And Stanford
hadn't shown a thing—the Washing*-
tonians sat back quietly to await the
slaughter. So Grayson and his bum
ankle, Moscrip, Coflfis, Luckett, and
Collins proceeded to scrap them 0-0,
in what was described by all present
as a whale of a football game.
And their hoop team last winter,
undoubtedly a powerhouse, was lit
erally whitewashed in its two ap
pearances down here!
So you get the situation—no mat
ter how good a game the northerners
play on their home grounds, they
seem, by past tendencies, to leave it
up there when they journey Stan
fordward.
It 'can't be said whether things will
continue thus in 193G, but it can be
said that the Huskies are good. They

may deny it, and some of their
games may indicate otherwise, but
the boys who scrutinize carefully
have decided that they know just
exactly when and how much to ex
tend themselves and their power.
They won't withhold a bit of it
this week.
