# Phelan Not Overly Worried Even Terms Are Poped
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
James Phelan, a gentleman from
Seattle who has given no little evi
dence that he knows football and
football players, is wary, and yet he's
not overly worried.
Furthermore, he is what might be
called pretty cool and collected, con
sidering that only yesterday he de
clared the Indians possessors of ''the
most dangerous offense on the Pa
cific Coast."
Depends 011 Squad
The truth of the matter is that he
is as firm as all get-out in the belief
that his Huskies, who arrived in San
Jose with him just last night, will
make at least a creditable showing
against Tiny Thornhill's red-shirted
cohorts tomorrow afternoon. Wheth
er or not the Washington squad will
do a lot better than that he has not
said.
There is justification, however,
for the belief that the Huskies bring
with them ability and fight aplenty—
enough to give the Redskins a whale
of a fray from the opening kick-off
tomorrow. To begin with, the war
riors from the North have bowed
this season only to Minnesota, and
this fact alone says a good deal.
Strong Backfield
Then, Phelan has one of the
strongest backfields in the Coast
league—Elmer Logg, quarter; By
Haines and Jimmy Johnstone,

halves; and Ed Nowogroski, fullback.
And there is plenty of prowess in the
line. True enough, Nowogroski and
John Wiatrak, ace center, have both
been on the injured list during the
past week.
Nevertheless, both have been used
in scrimmage this week, and have
given reassuring performances. And
they will both work out this after
noon on the stadium turf. In short,
they can and will very well be used
tomorrow if what Phelan has been
hearing about Stanford turns out to
confirm his worst fears.
Cruver To Start
Starting at Nowogroski's regular
post tomorrow should be A1 Cruver,
however. Bud Ericksen is tenta
tively billed to begin in place of
Wiatrak. And the remainder of the
line-up will tentatively include Max
Starcevich and Art Means, guards;
Vic Markov and Chuck Bond, tack
les; and Dick Johnson and Frank
Peters, ends.
The Seattle mentor has experi
mented now and then since the
opening of the season with a bevy of
reserve backs to uncover the most
promising four. Last reports have it
that Fritz Wakowitz, flashy punter
and passer, is most outstanding at
right half; By Haines, at left half;
Chuck Newton, at quarter; and Cru
ver', at full.
