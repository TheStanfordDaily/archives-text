# Sword and Sandals Postpones Tryouts
## 
### 
Tryouts for the reading of Ibsen's
"Brand" to be given November 12
by Sword and Saodals were post
poned yesterday bocause of conflict
with Gaieties rehearsals. Charles
Denny, director, announced the try
outs would take place at a later date.
Anyone is eligible to take part in
this reading, as it is the only type of
dramatic production on the campus
in which freshman women may take
part.
