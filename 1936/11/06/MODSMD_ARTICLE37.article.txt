# Papooses Face Unbeaten Bear Cubs Tomorrow
## Comparative Scores Give Berkeley Squad Edge In Traditional Little Big Game Shipkey's Men Determined To Upset Dope, Triumph Over Cal Frosh; Team Drills on Pass Defense 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Thirty-six men of destiny will leave the campus tomorrow with a firm
resolution in their hearts to accomplish a task which has baffled Stanford
representatives since 1928. Harry Sliipkey's freshman grid team is journey
ing to Berkeley where at 2:00 o'clock they will battle for 60 minutes against
Clint Evans' unbeaten California Cubs.
Once more the Bear yearlings are installed in their perennial position
pre-game favorites. Once more the sons of Stanford are equally deter-

ined to disregard the dope and 4
emerge victors in the classic "Little
Big Game."
Cubs Favored
Comparative scores give Evans'
men the edge. They whipped U.C.
L.A. 13-12. Stanford lost to the same
team by a 23-18 score. Cal also
boasts a win over the powerful San
Mateo J. C. eleven, while local
boys can only try to forget the fact |
that they lost to the same outfit.
But such statistics are held in little
esteem by mentor Shipkey who says:
"We are going to upset the Cali
fornia apple cart and win that ball
game tomorrow." Mr. Shipkey is.
not a man given to making rash j
statements. In fact he has eleven j
good reasons for believing in the j
truth of his utterance.
YVillard Lauded
Reason number one is Bill Wil
lard, scrappy wingman from Henry
etta, Oklahoma. Bill is starting at
right end, and is counted on to stop
anything that the Bears may choose
to .shoot at him. Second reason is
Bill Greer, left end who has worked
up to a first string berth during the
last three weeks by dint of his fine
defensive play.
Five of the other nine reasons why
Stanford thinks they will take Cal
are: Sid Lewis and Stan Andersen,
huge tackles who can stand the gaff;
Norman Juney and Ernie Damarus, |
a clever pair of guards; and Hugh !
Radke, who is back at first string I
center. These men have the job of j
halting the Bear's thrusts on the j
ground before they can get well :
started.
Backs Drilled
To the backfield falls the more I
difficult role of keeping California j
passes from clicking for touchdowns, j
Last night Frank Alustiza and Ship- j
key shot pass after pass at the de- i
fending frosh backs who finally
began to bat them down with a de
gree of regularity.
A surprise starter at fullback is
Howie Hickingbotham, who has the
makings of a first rate triple threat
artist. He can kick, pass, and run
with the porkhide with equal ease.
Calling the plays will be quarter
back Jack Grover, who will also
have the risky responsibility of run
ning back the Bear punts. Chet Pat
ton and Rod Parker will alternate
with Hickingbotham, while Gene
Coldiron and Eric Bovet are subs
for Grover.
Sparling Shifted
Jerry Sparling has been shifted to
left half' to replace Chad Reade,
whose charley horse may keep him
on the bench for the greater part of
the game. Tom Walker is slated to
open at the right half position. Ed
Harrington, "Bunny" Wilson, and
Ken McMurray are other boys who
may see action at half.
Probable starters for California
include: L. Smith and Wilhelm, ends;
J. Smith and Mcßurnie, tackles;
Fcrran and Connor, guards; Sauer,
center; Huters, quarterback; In
gram and Erickson, halfbacks, and
Anderson, fullback.
It hasn't been done in eight years,
but this time tab Stanford to win.

Jerry Sparling has been shifted to
left half' to replace Chad Reade,
whose charley horse may keep him
on the bench for the greater part of
the game. Tom Walker is slated to
open at the right half position. Ed
Harrington, "Bunny" Wilson, and
Ken McMurray are other boys who
may see action at half.
Probable starters for California
include: L. Smith and Wilhelm, ends;
J. Smith and Mcßurnie, tackles;
Fcrran and Connor, guards; Sauer,
center; Huters, quarterback; In
gram and Erickson, halfbacks, and
Anderson, fullback.
It hasn't been done in eight years,
but this time tab Stanford to win.
Thirty-six men of destiny will leave the campus tomorrow with a firm
resolution in their hearts to accomplish a task which has baffled Stanford
representatives since 1928. Harry Sliipkey's freshman grid team is journey
ing to Berkeley where at 2:00 o'clock they will battle for 60 minutes against
Clint Evans' unbeaten California Cubs.
Once more the Bear yearlings are installed in their perennial position
pre-game favorites. Once more the sons of Stanford are equally deter-

ined to disregard the dope and 4
emerge victors in the classic "Little
Big Game."
Cubs Favored
Comparative scores give Evans'
men the edge. They whipped U.C.
L.A. 13-12. Stanford lost to the same
team by a 23-18 score. Cal also
boasts a win over the powerful San
Mateo J. C. eleven, while local
boys can only try to forget the fact |
that they lost to the same outfit.
But such statistics are held in little
esteem by mentor Shipkey who says:
"We are going to upset the Cali
fornia apple cart and win that ball
game tomorrow." Mr. Shipkey is.
not a man given to making rash j
statements. In fact he has eleven j
good reasons for believing in the j
truth of his utterance.
YVillard Lauded
Reason number one is Bill Wil
lard, scrappy wingman from Henry
etta, Oklahoma. Bill is starting at
right end, and is counted on to stop
anything that the Bears may choose
to .shoot at him. Second reason is
Bill Greer, left end who has worked
up to a first string berth during the
last three weeks by dint of his fine
defensive play.
Five of the other nine reasons why
Stanford thinks they will take Cal
are: Sid Lewis and Stan Andersen,
huge tackles who can stand the gaff;
Norman Juney and Ernie Damarus, |
a clever pair of guards; and Hugh !
Radke, who is back at first string I
center. These men have the job of j
halting the Bear's thrusts on the j
ground before they can get well :
started.
Backs Drilled
To the backfield falls the more I
difficult role of keeping California j
passes from clicking for touchdowns, j
Last night Frank Alustiza and Ship- j
key shot pass after pass at the de- i
fending frosh backs who finally
began to bat them down with a de
gree of regularity.
A surprise starter at fullback is
Howie Hickingbotham, who has the
makings of a first rate triple threat
artist. He can kick, pass, and run
with the porkhide with equal ease.
Calling the plays will be quarter
back Jack Grover, who will also
have the risky responsibility of run
ning back the Bear punts. Chet Pat
ton and Rod Parker will alternate
with Hickingbotham, while Gene
Coldiron and Eric Bovet are subs
for Grover.
