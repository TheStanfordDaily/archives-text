# Your Stanford Nile and Nitery—--in Pictures
## 
### 

YOUR DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT IS — "Roadside,"
story* of the road-dwellers, told by Lynn Riggs and staged by
Gordon Lange as his first production under the Stanford
aegis. In the cast are Howard Roberts, Jack Beatty, Jim
Corner, and Geraldine Schreiber, shown above (left to right)
in a scene from the first act when "Texas," picturesque out
law, is "cotched," and with him, the fiery Hannie. The gentle
man cowering at extreme left is the jailer.

The play is a refined Western, in western dialect. Re
sponsible for some mighty realistic settings is Phil Brown,
Stanford's Max Reinhardt. There's supposed to be a thirty
second change somewhere from the open road to the closed
courthouse. Watch for it tonight at the Assembly Hall, when
thc.play's single performance will start at 8:30 sharp. Tickets
at the usual places and prices.


YOUR SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT IS lb H tery, to be
held in the Old Union directly following the ' rmance ol
"Roadside." There will be a ' replace, a radio, piano and a
Union soda-fountain supplied by the manag i u?nt. Show.i
above is the Daily staff, Nitery champions, trying out the
floor and the Daily staff, weighing the Union lobby, and

finding it wanting - compared to the golf clubhouse. Will
it do? It will have to. And lock-outs are only a stop away.
Being close to home, food, and fireside, it's recommended
to all students whose hearts warm to tho Fun on the Tarm
idea. It might work, in time.
