# Rooters Get Instructions On Behavior
## 
### 
With tomorrow's kick-off at 2:00
sharp, rooters are warned to be in
their places beforehand. As card
stunts will be given, men must wear
white shirts and rooters' caps; wom
en white shirts and pom-poms. These
latter may still be had at the A.S.S.U.
office.
The disorder at the U.S.C. game
two weeks ago occasioned by late ar
rival of rooters must not be re
peated, said Jake Irwin, in charge
of the stadium. "Much as I hate to
resort to it, tardy arrivals will be
kept out henceforth."
Mr. Irwin requested fraternities,
whose noon rush period ends at 2:00,
to quite a little earlier.
There will be no preliminary to
the game. Band and rooters v/ill be
broadcast the last five minutes of
the half-time period.
Officials: Referee, Tom Lautit; um
pire, Jim Cave; head linesman, Jim
Blewett; and field judge, Rufe
Klawans.
