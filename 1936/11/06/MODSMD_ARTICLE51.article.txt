"Roadside," the second Nitery, Ihe Wash
ington game tomorrow afternoon, the A.S.S.U.
dance tomorrow night. Not much reason to
risk your life on the highways or your re
spectability while rubbing elbows in the City
hotels with San Francisco's Democrats, or your
pocketbook while rubbing elbows with Paly
policemen in the local cinema dens.
