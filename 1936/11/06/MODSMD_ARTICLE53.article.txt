### 
A fighting tedm, a colorful team, a rapidly
improving team. Anything can happen. We
won't be playing for the Rose Bowl. We won't
be ploying because we hate the Huskies. We
will be playing because we want to show the
ya-vaers that a Stanford team can play like a
Stanford team, because it is fun to play foot
ball, and it is fun to win.
