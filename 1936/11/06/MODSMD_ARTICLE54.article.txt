# Play

I haven't seen the script of "Roadside." I
haven't seen the new dramatics director. I
haven t seen, and neither has the campus, most
of the cast before, but I have an idea that to
night's play will be good.
About my only basis for opinion is the choice
of the play. As far as you can tell from a hasty
perusal of the advance notices, "Roadside" is
folk-epic-historicai. It sounds as if it is drama
and not some of the drawing-room charades
that have passed for plays on local boards in
the past. Last year Director Uhler started out
with a bang in Paths of Glory," then lapsed
into "June Moon." I hope a success with this
first show will convince the Dramatics Council
that they cannot hope to compete v/ith the flick
ers in Paly with drawing-room gags and farce.
Those who pay their money to see a campus
drama, want good drama, with some attempt
at art. I hope they get it tonight, and continue
to get it in succeeding productions.
