# By the Tail
## 
### 
Only fools and college editors attempt to
analyze presidential election returns, particu
larly two day 3 after the election. Still, it is a lot
sm.inor than trying to analyze them before the

election, as Citizens Gallup, Funk and Wag
nalls should know.
Startling fact, of course, is not Roosevelt's
majority of 66 per cent of the major party vote,
but that it was distributed all over the country.
Even conservative, rock-ribbed, gilt-edged New
England/went into the Democratic column.
Not all of that vote could have come from
WPA workers, nor crazy college professors,
or government employees. Majority sentiment
on the campus seems to be that Roosevelt
roused the rabble. That it was the dumb, igno
rant laboring man, who couldn't grasp the re
cherche reasoning of the Republicans' philoso
phy of government.
It is plain to see that Roosevelt did rouse the
rabble, and because of it this is a significant
election in American history. But as for the
rabble not understanding the recherche rea
soning of the Republicans, no one has been able
to prove that the Republicans could understand
it. Really, the rabble seems infinitely more
capable of understanding the Republican phi
losophy than the Republicans have been able
to understand the simple implications (except
for exploitative purposes) of the growth of
machine technology on society and its govern
ment.
Now, we find from coast to coast, that the so
called rabble, who never before had bothered
to exercise the franchise, have awakened to
a fact the vested interests found out 50 years
ago: that political means can be used to serve
economic ends.
Whether the implications ox this new vote
conscious rabble will shock Roosevelt into ef
fecting a right-about-face towards the Left seems
doubtful, but if Roosevelt doesn't know he has
a lion by the tail now, he soon will.
