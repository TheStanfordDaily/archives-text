# BULL SESSION
## WILL ROADSIDE I ALL BY THE WAYSIDE? 
### 
Stanford has scads of actors, bad and good, but not
even a third-rate audience. Perhaps it's because stu
dents have such well-developed voiccs themselves, but
the fact is that not the twelve disciples in selected
readings could fill the old Assembly Hall.
Which speaks well for the "Roadside" cast, who
have worked to a finished performance tonight in
spite of a guaranteed empty house. It has taken weeks
to sculp foreign character into Stanford physiognomies
and our famous excuse for a stage. But the harried
sculptors are content with the joy of work, sinco they
are denied giving joy to others.
* * * iS
When the curtain rises tonight, if your voice isn't
too hot, you will see Lynn Riggs' well-seasoned story
of roadside squatters, who flaunt their seamy happiness
in the face of a world that regards back-scratching as
sinful because it's pleasant.
The show is a valid depiction of how the lower
quarter of the other half lives. It isn't pretty. It isn't
careful of your prejudices, and Director Lange was
careful to preserve certain moral dubiosities intact. It
should be a worth-while performance.
* * * #
But why waste space. Even the actors know we
can't take it in. As a matter of fact, they know only
too well we won't get so much as a glimpse of it until
next June, when the Quad comes out describing the
"well-filled house" and telling us all about it in the
Quad's necessarily "pretty-please" way.
By that time the yearbook will have a section for
plays, all poorly attended, and all workouts for a
sincere group of faculty and students.
* * * *
The section will be simply entitled Dramatics. It
might better be called "Cain's Warehouse," or "Stan
ford Plays Should Be Neither Seen nor Heard."
For such is our little kingdom of Thespis. With a
magnificent new theater rapidly approaching curtain
time, the half-million dollars we arc spending on it
begins to look like a waste. It will be money thrown
away, as far as student use of the building goes, unless
wc spend a million sensitizing Stanford's 4000 self
named patrons of the arts.
Otherwise, Comptroller Roth might revise his plans
and turn the New Theater into a Masque Ballcry, or
a mid-nitcry, or something else less dramatic and Irs ,
"arty" than a place where students can put on good
plays before an audir-nce.
Or maybe it won id be less trouble to hire stooges
to sit out front so wc can go to the movies—where wc
belong.

sinful because it's pleasant.
The show is a valid depiction of how the lower
quarter of the other half lives. It isn't pretty. It isn't
careful of your prejudices, and Director Lange was
careful to preserve certain moral dubiosities intact. It
should be a worth-while performance.

But why waste space. Even the actors know we
can't take it in. As a matter of fact, they know only
too well we won't get so much as a glimpse of it until
next June, when the Quad comes out describing the
"well-filled house" and telling us all about it in the
Quad's necessarily "pretty-please" way.
By that time the yearbook will have a section for
plays, all poorly attended, and all workouts for a
sincere group of faculty and students.

The section will be simply entitled Dramatics. It
might better be called "Cain's Warehouse," or "Stan
ford Plays Should Be Neither Seen nor Heard."
For such is our little kingdom of Thespis. With a
magnificent new theater rapidly approaching curtain
time, the half-million dollars we arc spending on it
begins to look like a waste. It will be money thrown
away, as far as student use of the building goes, unless
wc spend a million sensitizing Stanford's 4000 self
named patrons of the arts.
Otherwise, Comptroller Roth might revise his plans
and turn the New Theater into a Masque Ballcry, or
a mid-nitcry, or something else less dramatic and Irs ,
"arty" than a place where students can put on good
plays before an audir-nce.
Or maybe it won id be less trouble to hire stooges
to sit out front so wc can go to the movies—where wc
belong.

Stanford has scads of actors, bad and good, but not
even a third-rate audience. Perhaps it's because stu
dents have such well-developed voiccs themselves, but
the fact is that not the twelve disciples in selected
readings could fill the old Assembly Hall.
Which speaks well for the "Roadside" cast, who
have worked to a finished performance tonight in
spite of a guaranteed empty house. It has taken weeks
to sculp foreign character into Stanford physiognomies
and our famous excuse for a stage. But the harried
sculptors are content with the joy of work, sinco they
are denied giving joy to others.

When the curtain rises tonight, if your voice isn't
too hot, you will see Lynn Riggs' well-seasoned story
of roadside squatters, who flaunt their seamy happiness
in the face of a world that regards back-scratching as
sinful because it's pleasant.

quarter of the other half lives. It isn't pretty. It isn't
