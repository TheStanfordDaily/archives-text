Manzanita is ready to picket the D.U. bouse for
| bolnf* Unfair. Tension exists at (his point over the
matter of s'ecp. During the D.U.'s Pre-iniliation Pe
! 'iod, the brothers' amphibious initiatory activities kept
! the neighboring Nitamanzas awake.
So the Man.:anita women started in pro-initiating
the D.U.'s ihe night that the D.U.'s stopped. The in
surgents pill alarm clocks up on the D.U. fence and
| set them to go oIT at 2:!50. This was followed by an
j Armistice Day parade in which pans were beaten. The
D.U.'s didn't like this, particularly after a long, hard
| w?ek in which pans were taken down and things were
I beaten. So they ran out after the Manzanita girls,
who ran down and so did the alarm clocks.
After this there was a good deal of guerilla warfare
; with Ihe odds of warfare shifting back and forth. At
| the present writing, the stiike has shifted away from
Ihe waterfront, since tlie D.U.'s have put up barri
cades around their swimming pool, hut i! is centering
around the vital utilities, with the D.U.'s pulling Ihe
! light switch every or so, so that the Manzanita
j girls cannot study books.
On one of these cool, crisp autumn nights the Chi
i Os decided to have a house warming to show ofT their
I new house, so they had a joily-up and had their
' house warming. In the middle of the affair, a couple of
( Phi Dclts walked in, saw a Chi O and friend sitting on
a settee. The Phi D *11 . being hungry, suggested tHat
! they try to find something to oat; so they left the
j settee sitting, wandered out to the kitchen where lhey
j had a round with the cracker box. Then the Chi O
! showed them the house, the rew upstairs rooms, and
j Ihe fire escape. The Phi Delts thanked her and walked
j out.
