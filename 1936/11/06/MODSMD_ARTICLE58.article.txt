## EATING YOUR WAY 
### 
A small-sized manhunt in our
| own backyard has been ended with
: the finding of that eminent quack,
| Dr. J. Douglass Thompson, on the
| radio again at 10:30 a.m. on one of
the phonograph - record stations
about the middle of the dial.
For some years now Dr. Tawmpson
j has been telling us about that wawn
derful little bohdy of ours in an
i accent that seems to have been de
j veloped by a broad "a" travelling
! up his nose and coming out so that
! he now speaks of cahsting his pehls
befoh swine. He refers to his recent
| run-in with the law concerning the
{ accuracy of his statements. Dr.
1 Tawmpson was, as I remember, ac
-1 quitted, as was that other prominent
! Oakland healer, Fong Wan, the
| herbalist and miracle man.

But anyway, Dr. Tawmpson is
j back again, growing more dear to us
every minute with his famous Eating
! Your Way to Health program. For
j an accurate reporting of Dr. Tawmp
! son's priceless advice, I am indebted
jlo my roommate. After the an
i nouncer reads a bit of poetry telling
us that he is the sunlight of the day
i and the starlit heavens of the night,
j ihe good doctor's hokum commences
j on the following tack:
"Good mawning ev'rybohdy. This
: mawning I am going to tell you about
j that mahvelous little veg'table bet
j taw known as the' prune. Many of
j you do nawt realize how truly re
i rnawkable this vahluable little veg'-
table is. Do you know that of the
j twenty-three ehlements found in
: thawt bohdy of yaws, this little
; prune possesses twenty-two? Well,
! it's true. It is particularly rich in
i phawsphorus, and phawsphorus, my
i friends, is that little ehlement so
necessary to the prawper functioning
j of the brain, as well as for a thou
; sand of those other wawnderful
I things that are going awn in yaw
| bohdy ev'ry minute, from the tip of
■ yaw head, yes, even down to those
I very toes on yaw feet.
i "This mawning I have here a let
| ter from Mrs. E.J. of Petaluma
i awsking about an ahffliction in her
j hands. I am sure I can help you,
j Mrs. E. J. of Petaluma. This dis
! awder of the joints is called arth-
I ritis. You see, arthritis is caused by
| an inflammation in the walls of thawt
; mahvelous little garbage can bettah
i known as the small intestine. You
will find a special chapter dehvoted
| to arthritis in the "Eating Your Way
J to Health Library." If you have not
, received yaw cawpy. you may get
j one by sending but the sum of five
| dohllaws to Dr. J. Douglass Tawmp
j son.
j "If at the same time, you wish to
I order a copy of the "Eating Your
Way to Health Library Cookbook,"
j you may do so by sending faw dohl
i laws extra. But for the sum of nine
I dohllaws you will receive promptly
i two handsomely-bound volumes
! with yaw name engraved in gold on
| each. The "Eating Your Way to
Health Library Cookbook," with its
seven hundred tempting recipes of
! new and delicious dishes, is by MRS.
| J. Douglass Tawmpson."

| There is absolutely nothing like
j Dr. J. Douglass Tawmpson. The
j only thing that could touch him
j would be a Siberian negro who spoke
i Russian with a Mississippi drawl
reading an advertisement for Lydia
; E. Pinkham's vegetable compound.
