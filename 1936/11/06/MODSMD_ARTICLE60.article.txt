# CAMPUS OPINION
## DEFENDS PALO ALTO 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I entirely agree with the editorial
on theater boycott. It seems to me
that if the Daily succeeds in leading
this boycott against Paly theaters
one definite good for Stanford men
and women will have been done.
This is an entirely justifiable action,
and I certainly hope it will effect the
much needed changes.
However, I see no reason to get up
a big gripe for Paly as a town. True,
they do endorse the present control
of speeding. A glance at the figures
on accidents, injuries and deaths be
fore and after the drive started
should convince anyone of its sensi
bility. Few cities can show a better
record.
Palo Alto's greatest asset is its

proximity to Stanford University.
This fact is admitted by the city
planning committee, appointed by
the Palo Alto Residents' Club.
The town itself does not live off
Stanford like a lot of leeches. Most
of the residents living in Palo Alto
have work in San Francisco. As a
place from which to commute, Palo
Alto is practically ideal. It is near
enough to the city so that residents
don't get too countrified, yet far
enough away so that it is a great
place to raise the kiddies, etc.
I don't see where any cop's pants
are going to cost $15. This, however,
is not the representative spirit of the
entire town.
So just take it easy. You're apt to
raise your blood pressure with so
much moaning.
