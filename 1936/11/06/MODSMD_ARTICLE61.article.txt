Yes, the shows at the Stanford
and Varsity theaters this week-end
will very likely be lovely shows,
and what's more you lovely fellows
will very likely take equally lovely
gals to see them.
You will pay $1.10 for two loggy
seats with backs straight up that give
you a crink in the neck. But you
won't mind that because you being
a lovely boy, and she being a lovely
gal, you will in all probability hold
hands and never even look at the
lovely "flicks."
These theaters were built, bought,
and paid for out of campus pocket
books—well, practically, but they
can't afford to let pajama-clad frosh
in free just once a year; they can't
afford to let the boys in the balcony
titter at Mr. Lowell Thomas's funny
nose; and they certainly can't afford
to bring their prices within reach of
the few Stanford roughs siill left on
the campus.
No, they can't afford to do all
these things, but nevertheless you
will come home and tell all your
friends about the lovely show you
have seen at the lovely theater in
lovely Palo Alto—that, of course, is
because you are a lovely boy and
you have a lovely gal.
C'mon old man, buck up and strap
a pole to your back, and you of the
famed 1100, if you want to hold
hands, go on up to the Stanford Hill
or out on Governor's Lane. But stay
away from those nasty show houses
down there until they stop biting the
hands that feed 'em!—R. B. Jones
