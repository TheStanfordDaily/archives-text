There is one thing that bothers me
about the present Night Club plans,
and that is that the women are still
at the mercies of you "gods of the
earth."
Ask any one of quite a number of
Stanford women what they thought
of the "fling" in the Union last Sat
urday night and the answer comes
back, "I wasn't invited."
Perhaps more exchange dinners
would take care of the situation.
Let's hope something will be done !
along those lines anyway.
