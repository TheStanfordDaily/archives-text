# Spirit, Tip-Top Condition Make Cardinals Dangerous To Washington Tomorrow
## Tiny Optimistic on Eve of Battle to Erase Blot of Early Season Defeats; Clark, Calvelli, Callaway All Will Start 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Tomorrow stands ready to he a memorable clay to the IMG Stanford
varsity football team.
The scene is the fifteenth annual Stanford-Washington grid classic in
the Stadium, the background is Washington's occupying the top-dog posi
tion in the Pacific Coast Conference, and the situation is that Stanford is

► far below that on the books, but right
up near that on the actual capability
sheet.
'i iny Informed
No one is informed better than
Tiny Thornhill concerning the pow
erful Husky attack, their wide-open
and variable style of offense, and
their strong, immovable defense, and
not a bit of the information has been
kept by him and his asisstants from
the Stanford squad.
But in spite of this, the new Big
Red Machine is in the finest state of
repair and condition possible. The
players have won but one game this
year, and they realize that their early
season scores will be completely
obliterated if they turn the trick by
upsetting the touted Huskies to
morrow.
They are not in the least cocky.
They .still arc so new at the game
that they rub elbows now and then,
but their inexperience doesn't get
them down. Instead, they know that
if they win in spite of it, the more
credit goes to them, and ihey have
shown all of their past four audi
ences that they like to win.
Huskies Not Perfect
Tiny analyzes the situation: '"The
Huskies, although they have won a
lot of good ball games, aren't a per
fect bunch. They have run into a
lot of trouble in some of their games,
and anybody who says they weie
resting against Oregon last week is
all wet. The whole first team was in
there, and everybody knows that a
seven-point lead isn't much in these
days."
The Stanford boys are set right,
says Tiny. "The kids know they
were good last week, but they know
they'll have to be better this time,
and they are better. Calvelli and
Brigham arc alternately coming up
by leaps and bounds, and they're
both triple threats now."
No Recent Injuries
Not an injury has pierced the
Stanford team this week; Calvelli's
eye and Callaway's shiner are re
paired and ready, while minor leg
bruises on Grant and Clark are in
significant. s
The wags look to a wide open game
from both sides; the Huskies have
enough respect for the Stanford
aerial attack to stay spread through
out the day and thus facilitate *
little straight ahead play. Both teams
are fast enough to get around the
opposing ends, while the punting ef
fectiveness of Elmer Logg, said by
some to be the'""fTp;»m 6V thfToa: t,
will be somewhat diminished by the
rushing tactics of the Stanford ends
and tackles.
Early Score Important
An early score or break may prove
incentive to change the entire out
come, as both squads arc t awfully
hard to beat when once they get
ahead. Then, too, there is nothing
like being behind (i points to incite
a smashing and successful offensive
drive.
After a long stay at dummy scrim
mage and smoothing off a ' "w play
last, night, the Indian startei.-. stood
the same as last week: ends, Giant
Stone and Jack Clark; tackles,
Claude Callaway and Pete Zagar;
guards; Bob Matthews and Leo For
