# A. B.'S IN HOLLYWOOD
## 
### MARGARET LOUD 
you want to step through the
screen doors of Hollywood after
spending four years on the Farm,
don't expect an A.B. from Stanford
to make the going any easier for
you. A college education won't nec
essax-ily help you land a job in the
movie city and the stuff you cram
med into your brain before finals
won't make you act better before the
camera, write a snappier scenario, or
plan a more artistic stage set.
"Some Hollywood studios stand in
awe of a college education; some are
jealous of it; but some just don't give
a damn about it." That is the opinion
of Harold Helvenston, former Stan
ford dramatics director, who now
works at the Disney studios. And
Frank O'Neill and Eleanor Harris,
two other Stanford graduates who
have also successfully crashed the
gates of two other studios, agree
with him. A college education is
rather immaterial to Hollywood.
Asylums and jails
A former queen of the Masque
Ball, Eleanor "Hey-Hey" Harris, is
now a junior scenario writer for
Twentieth Century Fox. She is sup
posed to be a comedy-romance writ
er but she also has helped in trage
dies and mysteries. "A college edu
cation hasn't hindered me," she de
clares, "but all it has done to help is
to give me a smattering knowledge
of many fields. I can act with more

authority when I am writing about
things like insane asylums or jails."
College, she continues, has been a
definite advantage to her as far as
getting poise and meeting people go.
Studio writing is different from any
thing college teaches, however. Fox
studios, according to Miss Harris,
have six junior writers, most of
whom have been at the studios for
two years and have not had college
educators. While "Hey-Hey" does
not feel that college has helped her
work directly, she states that it was
better than four years of free-lancing
would have been.
What she values most about her
present work are the interviews
with producers who give experienced
advice on making pictures interest
ing for eight reels. She intends to
remain on the Twentieth Century-
Fox lot. "I'd like to write plays,"
Miss Harris says, 'but if they were
successful I'd get back to Hollywood
eventually."

Frank O'Neill, student director of
dramatics at the Farm last y«ar, is
now on the pay roll of the M-G-M
scenario department, under seven
year option contract. "A college edu
cation has not helped me," he de-

Clares, "nor have I run into any case
in whicjj a college education helped
anyone in Hollywood in a material
way. I got my own job largely on my
