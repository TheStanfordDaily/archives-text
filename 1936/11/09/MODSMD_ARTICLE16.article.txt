## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Coming out better than any other
Coast team has fared against them
this year, Coach Tiny Thornhill's
sport model Big Red Machine took a
14-14 tie from the fighting Washing
ton Huskies Saturday in the Sta
dium.
With U.S.C. and Washington State
being punched in the nose by Cal
and Oregon State respectively the
same day, the Huskies found them
selves at the end of the afternoon's
activities leading the Pacific Coast
Confer cnce. And the Stanford team
at the end of the day could con
template a tie game with the league
leaders.
Yet neither seemed very happy
about it.
Said Jimmy Phelan, "1 knew all
the time that Stanford was going to
be good, but I didn't expect this
much. We used every bit of strength
we had on the bench, but didn't seem
to have much punch inside the 10-
yard line. The games to come are
going to be tough for us, because
we're whittled down to the bone. I
lost Merle Miller some weeks ago,
and Haines' knee is pretty bad.
Nowogroski and Wiatrak too are not
well off."
Said Tiny Thornhill, "It was a

slippery ball, with no grain in it to
hold on to. The Huskies were good
today, and our kids played a fine
game to come out as they did. We're
on the way now, but we've still'got
lots to worry about with our nest
; ones, Oregon State and California,
winning as they did today."
For the unbiased spectator, the
game was a world-beater, filled with
fine football and unexpected thrills.
But most of it was Washington, as
the Huskies ran nearly twice as
many plays as did Stanford, and
gained twice as much: 198 against 78
on the ground, and 80 against 58 in
the air. Stanford completed 4 out of
16 passes, Washington 10 out of 23,
| while first downs were 6 to IG.
The first period sparkled with
i fumbles, Stanford muffing three and
Washington two, but Waskowitz apd
Haines made lots of yardage in be
| tween. Stanford held for downs once
on the 2-yard line, but ten plqys
| after kicking out, Jim Cain went
: over rgiht tackle for Wz feet and a
score. It was the third play of the
second quarter, following five min
utes of play inside the 15-yard line.
Cain held while Al Cruver convert
ed, to make it 7-0.
