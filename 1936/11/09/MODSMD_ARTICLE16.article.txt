# Cards Tie Huskies 14-14; Meet O. S. C. Saturday
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Coming out better than any other
Coast team has fared against them
this year, Coach Tiny Thornhill's
sport model Big Red Machine took a
14-14 tie from the fighting Washing
ton Huskies Saturday in the Sta
dium.
With U.S.C. and Washington State
being punched in the nose by Cal
and Oregon State respectively the
same day, the Huskies found them
selves at the end of the afternoon's
activities leading the Pacific Coast
Confer cnce. And the Stanford team
at the end of the day could con
template a tie game with the league
leaders.
Yet neither seemed very happy
about it.
Said Jimmy Phelan, "1 knew all
the time that Stanford was going to
be good, but I didn't expect this
much. We used every bit of strength
we had on the bench, but didn't seem
to have much punch inside the 10-
yard line. The games to come are
going to be tough for us, because
we're whittled down to the bone. I
lost Merle Miller some weeks ago,
and Haines' knee is pretty bad.
Nowogroski and Wiatrak too are not
well off."
Said Tiny Thornhill, "It was a

slippery ball, with no grain in it to
hold on to. The Huskies were good
today, and our kids played a fine
game to come out as they did. We're
on the way now, but we've still'got
lots to worry about with our nest
; ones, Oregon State and California,
winning as they did today."
For the unbiased spectator, the
game was a world-beater, filled with
fine football and unexpected thrills.
But most of it was Washington, as
the Huskies ran nearly twice as
many plays as did Stanford, and
gained twice as much: 198 against 78
on the ground, and 80 against 58 in
the air. Stanford completed 4 out of
16 passes, Washington 10 out of 23,
| while first downs were 6 to IG.
The first period sparkled with
i fumbles, Stanford muffing three and
Washington two, but Waskowitz apd
Haines made lots of yardage in be
| tween. Stanford held for downs once
on the 2-yard line, but ten plqys
| after kicking out, Jim Cain went
: over rgiht tackle for Wz feet and a
score. It was the third play of the
second quarter, following five min
utes of play inside the 15-yard line.
Cain held while Al Cruver convert
ed, to make it 7-0.
Jake Brigham went in, and com
bining good kicks, lucky rolls, and
Jimmy Coffis' runbacks, Stanford
soon found themselves on their 48-
yard line. A pass from Brigham to
Coffis gained 29 of it, and Brigham
punched twice and Coffis once to
make it fourth and 1 on the 14-yard
line. Fred Williams made it all from
Y-formation balanced line — off his
right tackle and around to the corner
to dodge Ericksen and score lying
down. Tex Luckett went in and con
verted. with Coffis holding, 7-7.
The third quarter was still wide
open, with Brigham and Williams
making enough gains to keep the ball
until Stanford had scored. Not
counting a punt that was called back,
and a pass that Ericksen intercepted
and promptly fumbled, it was a 16-
play, 100-yard march to the second
score. One hundred yards because
they went into play after the kick-off

on their 30, and took two 15-yard
penalties on the way down.
The stabbers, though, were passes,
as usual—Brigham to Stone in the
right for 11, and Brigham to Coffis in
the left flat for 17 yards that gave a
first down on the 1-yard line. After
this one Brigham went over in two
tries, and Luckett again converted,
to make it 14-7 Stanford, with 6
minutes of the third quarter still to
go.
Last Chance Fails
Earl Hoos recovered Waskowitz's
fumble on the next kick-off, giving
Stanford a first down on the Husky
13-yard line, but the attack failed

with Luckett missing a placement
from a bad angle on fourth down.
Here Washington showed what
sheer power means— they had the
ball for 31 of the next 35 plays, with
Waskowitz, Cain, and Cruver gain
ing a couple of lengths of the field
only to be stopped on the 1-yard line
once, and the 23-yard line again. But

the boys from the north had it, and
with five minutes to play Waskowitz
passed to Cain in the right flat for 5
yards and a score. Elmer Logg con
verted to tie the game, 14-14.
The rest of the match was prin
cipally 11 passes thrown by both

teams in attempts to break the dead
lock. but with little effectiveness.
I Although the Stanford linemen
said the Husky line charge was
weaker than U.S.C.'s, they had noth
ing but respect for Cain, Haines,
Cruver, Logg, Waskowitz.
