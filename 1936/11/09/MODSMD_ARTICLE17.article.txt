# Frosh Lose To California 7-0 In Little 'Big Game'
## Cubs Score in First Quarter, Repulse Papooses' Scoring Attack 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Stanford will have to wait at least
one more year before she will be able
to boast of a team which can beat
California in freshman football. The
B< ars drove over for a touchdown in
the first quarter of Saturday's game
at Berkeley, and try as they would,
the Papooses could not shove the
leather over the last line. Final score
•was 7-0.
The California score was made by
Ted Hubert, left halfback, on a
fourth down plunge from the one
yard line. Perry Connors kicked the
goal. That concluded the scoring for
the afternoon, although Stanford
threatened three times.
Papooses Threaten
In the second quarter with Full
back Patton and Ed Harrington, left
half, carrying the ball, the Papooses
drove to the Cal 4-yard marker, only
to lose the ball on downs. A short
time later they were stopped on the
Bear 9.
Before the end of the half Stanford
recovered a fumble on the Cub 30
and made their way to the 6-yard
stripe, where they again found the
Cal defense too formidable for them.
Stanford Bottled
The second half saw Stanford bot
tled up by Louis Smith's long dis
tance kicking, and they were unable
to drive further into Cub territory
than the 30-yard line. However, Ed
Harrington did break loose for a 35-
yard jaunt to keep the Stanford of-

fense alive. He started from his own
30 and romped to the Cal 35 before
being brought down. This was the
high-water mark of the Papoose of
fense. They were forced to spend the
remainder of the game trying to get
out of the vicinity of their own goal
line.
Players Injured
Exceptional roughness was a fea
ture of the hard-fought battle. Bill
Willard, Hugh Gallerneau, Hugh
Radke, and Stan Anderson received
injuries that might keep them out of
the line-up for a time if there were
any more games to be played.
Stanford played one of their best
games of the year in losing, but the
old California jinx coupled with in
ability to click in the pinches cost
them a possible victory.
