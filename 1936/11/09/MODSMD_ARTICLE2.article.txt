# THE 						GRAND SNIPE HUNT
## 
### DAVID HARRIS 
Associate Professor of History
'\T THE outset, of this somewhat
reluctant venture in tabloid
journalism I must warn and confess.
The warning is to the effect that I
do not write in my capacity as an
associate professor of modern Euro
pean history with a nostalgia (as my
Jong-suffering students know) for
the middle ages. I am too timid to
expose niv professional self to that
widespread current of conviction
which holds that men with mortar
boards on their heads—and especial
ly those with sneers on their faces
—should never insinuate their het
erodox persons into vital problems
and public service.
A Contemplator
I address myself to the commission
with which the editor has flattered
me J in the non-academic phase of a
dual personality. Doctor Associate
Professor sits in his study—at least j
he should be there—pouring over the
Bulgarian atrocities of 1876; it is
Mr. Private Citizen who, skull cap |
on his sparse pate and a wan after- I
the-game smile on his face, sprawls!
before the living room fire and con- |
templates the American election of j
1930.
And now ihe Confession, I have no
■xpert knowledge. Almost all I know
is what I read in the headlines in the
middle of the morning while I fortify j
myself with a spot of poison at the i
local pub. These meagre gleanings,
sluiced down with a cup of white, I
have been operated on by the acid of j
my wistful thinking and the bile of i
my predilections and have mounted
to my head in the form of several
tentative thoughts which I am finally !
about to reveal.
Literary -Digest Pol!
As I watch Mr. Landon and Mr. A1
Smith and Father Coughlin paddle
up the dready wastes of Salt Creek
I have been prompted to wonder if!
the nineteenth century is not at last |
coming to an end in a majority of
American minds. The best evidence ]
is that 'Literary Digest' poll to which
poor Mr. Hamilton clung so hope
fully and so gracelessly until the last
moment on Tuesday night. Hereto
fore replies from owners of automo
biles and subscribers to telephones
gave a fairly accurate index of the
division of American opinion, but my
reading of the present results leads
to the conclusion that no longer does
'he inertia of the previous century
push the little people into diving on
political contests just as their more
fortunate neighbors have been wont
'o do.
In other words, the campaign and
'he vote have tended to bring out
hat bi-polarity of opinion which in
evitably—it seems to me must as
sert itself in an industrial society.
The issue of the contest, has tended —
except perhaps in my native and un
-egenerate South to throw into op
posite camps those who, after the
nanner of the eighteenth and nine-
Tenth centuries, look at government
argely in terms of a vampire who

sucks the golden blood of the people
and those, on the other hand, who
deem government a desirable agency
for promoting the common weal. In
still other words, the social stratifica
tion of an industrial world has in
truded itself into the old unrealities
of American politics and there it will
remain. Each side to the late strug
gle accused the other of fomenting
class hatred, and undoubtedly both
did make a class appeal, but no se
rious person can believe that those
appeals made an important contribu
tion to America's rapidly developing
class friction; those appeals wete
fundamentally only a recognition
that the division is here.
Democratic Voters
Undoubtedly many people voted
Democratic because they had got at
the fleshpots after 12 years of sub
marginal existence. Undoubtedly
others voted Democratic because the
name was revered in the hotlses of
their fathers. Undoubtedly still oth
ers. were captured by a voice that
would warm the heart if it intoned
merely the weather report. (I shall
not consider the assurance given me
Wednesday by an eminent scientist
that the Democrats flooded ihe coun
try with WPA money on the eve of
the election.) None the less I can
not believe just now that there was
nothing to it but a contest between
two personalities and two brands of
hokum.
There was a contest over the role
of government in American life and
the American people responded
overwhelmingly to the appeal to
make its government an agency of
social amelioration in — it must be
emphasized -an industrial nation. It
seems to me that this basic issue has
been presented clearly for the first
time. Heretofore it has been ob
scured by our infinite capacity for an
increasingly vicarious enjoyment of

the type of nineteenth century capi
talism which the Republican party
stands for as well as by the success
ful effort of the Democratic party to
be a mildly watered-down imitation
of its rival.
The Old Cuff
But whether or not I am right in
this interpretation. I believe most
people will agree with me—perhaps
even Mr. Hamilton himself when the
spirit of reconciliation seizes upon
him—that the old shibboleths sancti
fied by generations of use failed to
work. Quoting Lincoln and snarling
over the mantles of Jeffersoh and
Theodore Roosevelt and pointing
with terror to alien influences—all
that old gufif (if I might borrow a
term frbm my friend Wes Muller)
seems to have lost the magic ring.
Around 80 per cent of the newspa
pers in the land were fighting Mr.
Roosevelt with the old weapons and
they received what an astute Stan
ford alumnus has called "the most
stunning blow to the prestige of
American journalism in at least a
lifetime." No one ever expected de
cency from Mr. Hearst, but that dis
tinguished roster of editors who
climbed into the sty with him must
share his discredit and reprobation,
and perhaps his falling circulation.
Whatever might have been the no
! bility of the Republican platform and
the genial Americanism of the candi
date, the campaign as it actually de
veloped presents a good case for the
mental and moral bankruptcy of the
I present leaders of the party. Not
even when I was a boy in Texas
listening to Jim Ferguson and his
compers go after each other with
rhetorical meat axes and stink bombs
did I hear such things as were re
cently mouthed by allegedly Respon
sible Republican speeches and "liter
ature." Of course this sort of thing

has always been done in American
campaigns and conservative outs are
bound to become hysterical, but
more than ever the Republicans this
year represented themsleves as the
best people and failed to recognize
the obligations of their noblesse.
We need a vital conservative party
—preferably in opposition—but if it
is going to be vital it will have to
adopt more rational and decent tac
tics than calling a clever opponent a
Communist, than pointing out how
much more gracefully its candidate
smokes a cigarette than does his
rival, than conniving at brazen lies
stuffed into workers' pay envelopes.
If intelligence should be. used by any
party, that party ought to be the con
servative one which has so much to
lose through foolishly discrediting
tho.se institutions which gives its
members their wealth and social po
sition. The Conservative party in
England has been much more apt in
learning this lesson.
Dirfr-Throwers
The Stanford alumnus whom I
have quoted believes that 90 per cent
of the dirt of the campaign was
thrown by the outs. That does not
necessarily mean that the Democrats
are morally superior people, but it
does mean. I believe, that the Demo
crats, however fortuitously it has
come about, had a moral advantage
in their campaign.
But what has happened has hap
pened and it does iw> good to the
ragged nerves of the country to make
recriminations. The task at hand is
to make it through the next four
years to what may be a real crisis in
American history. The impeccable
Daily recently gave to our commun
ity the sage words of a respected
colleague to the effect that a "pol

ished" professor never predicts in
politics. I painfully recall that just
under those lofty words was a bump
tious prognostication of Mr. Roose
velt's victory attributed to Professor
Harris. Since the professor has with
in the week exposed himself in such
! a manner, the private citizen part of
the combination is equally a chast
ened spirit.
But I cannot resibt one brief peep
into the crystal spheie. I am sure
that by now most of those who have
been wearing imitation middle
western weeds on their bosoms have
abandoned the notion that the Presi
dent is going to proclaim himself dic-
I tator and lash us into an alien form
of state with common wives and—
l worse still—common property. 1
brazenly predict that those who still
hold to this sublime self-spoofing
- will have to admit next year, and the
year after that, their pleasant sur
prise at finding that there still are
supreme courts and constitutions and
Kiwanis clubs and Daughters of the
American Disturbance of 177 G.
Valiant Self Spoofers
The people for whom I feel sorry
are another valiant band of self
spoofers—those liberals and Pinkoes
who anticipate a Rooseveltian turn to
the left. The President is undoubt
edly enraged by the attack on the
social security program, but I doubt
seriously if either rage with big busi
ness or good intentions toward man
kind will change Mr. Roosevelt from
what he really is — a conservative
with impulses that now and then
make him appear a little more lib
eral than Mr. Landon. Those kind
words and those gestures such as the
TVA during the last four long years
will perhaps be repeated, but they
are essentially decoys to the left; he
will seldom go outside of left tackle
and most often in seeking a hole in
the center will allow himself to be
chased to the right side of the line.

I have no great confidence in Mr.
Roosevelt's performances past and
future, but I have come to the point
where I wish to believe that the
American people are no longer sym
pathetic with the idea that economic
society and political society should in
theory be separate while actually the
former controls the latter. I may be
setting out on a grand snipe hunt
with the liberal brethren, but I am a
lover of real democracy and in these
parlous days when democracy
throughout the world is in trouble, I
seek my consolations where I can
find them. My hopes, therefore, have
taken a new lease on life.
