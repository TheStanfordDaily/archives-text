i.ITS (he smoothest running slrike
you ever saw." Those*are the
words of a student in the Graduate
School of Business, just returned
from two days spent on the strike
ridden San Francisco waterfront.
As a union man, this individual
circulated among the striking dock
workers, ate in their soup kitchens,
worked on their pickets, and learned
and sympathized with their position.
From his account, the union men
are well organized, operate a police
system of their own, and have "am
ple facilities to provide for all the
men on the waterfront for a long
time."
The pickets are operated from the
central organization, he says. Work
ing four six-hour shifts, they cover
every pier on the waterfront 24 hours
a d.ny.
For each pier, there is a picket
captain. Under him there are from
to ten men. depending on the size
1 of the dnrk. He if directly rtttpOTl
•ible for the actions of his men, and

must report before and after his
shift.
While J here may be more, he re
ports of two union operated soup
kitchens in the area. There union
men may obtain, upon presenting
their union cards, two good meals a
day, consisting of soup, stew, beans,
bread, potatoes, and coffee.
Although the primary purpose of
the picketing is to keep any ships
from sailing, they do make excep
tions. A fish oil processing boat,
which has always operated under
union agreements, was recently per
mitted to leave from Pier 46.
"From my observations in San
Francisco, there is ample evidence to
indicate that the shipping compa
nies tried to force the strike a month
before the election," be declared.
"T1 te fundamental issue boils
down to the retention of hiring halls
and preferential employment. The
bargemen's declaration for higher
wages and shorter hours is a minor
issue."
