# A 						WATERFRONT SCAB
## 
### CURTIS PRENDERGAST 
IN 1934 that distinguished Stanford
ex-undergraduate, Herbert Fleish
liacker, Jr., implored Stanford stu
dents to break, the waterfront strike
and save San Francisco from the ter
ror that gripped it.
For those who saved San Francisco
rrom the terror in 1934, and to those
who may save San Francisco again
if the present strike goes on to the
npen warfare stage the rewards are
tremendous. Or so I am told, al
though I drew down a cool $23 a
month, which would hardly have
paid for my dentistry. But for the
longshoremen, (he pay was about a
dollar an hour, a dollar an hour from
employers who were so hard up for
help that even the worst loafer drew
a fat check. It was a lot better than
scraping squashed apricots out from
under the machines at the cannery
for 40 cents an hour, the Portuguese
cannery girls notwithstanding.
Bloody Beatings
And with such fine pay to be had
for the mere asking during a strike,
about the only argument against
scabbing that has any force is the
strictly materialistic argument that it
is healthier not to. Of course, not all
scabs get beat, at least the ones who
run fast don't get caught, but the
possibility of nasty consequences is
always there.
The beatings are bloody affairs,
since a strike is a matter of life and
death to those who strike and picket.
The pickets are not so foolish as to
attack man for man. Seven or eight
of them will nab one scabber, and a
youngster I knew saw seven or eight
of them hold the unfortunate strike
breaker while the others pounded
him to a pulp, jumped up and down
on him, robbed him of his money, an
all but rolled him in the bay when
the police squad car came booming
down the Embarcadero to break up
the party. And the mugs hired as
Pinkerton guards for the special oc
casion of the strike delight in telling
stories of men getting their noses
spread across their faces from ear to

ear.
A beating at the moment is not the
only danger to be incurred by break
ing strikes. For in the eyes of the
union there is no sin as unforgiv
able as scabbing, and the working
theory is, once a fink always a fink.
I take no stock in the wild tale I
heard about a man being refused
work in the Salinas lettuce sheds be
cause he was discovered to have
scabbed , in Minneapolis teamsters'
strike in 1901, but I disbelieve the
story only on the grounds that the
union couldn't have found out a
thing that happened at such a remote
point of time or space. The moral of
the story is that something like that
could happen.
For that reason, I weep for the law
students who picked a bit of spare
change in the strike and still hope to
dabble in politics a little later on. In
these days of the growing power of
the labor vote, the candidate who
| sports a dirty labor record while
rousing the rabble will not last long,
for scabbing, like murder, will out.
And a poor scab who has once scab
bed can never live it down as far as
the unions are concerned.
Communist Morals
At this point the Communists and
other socially minded radicals will
claim that I have overlooked the
greatest point of all. that scabbing is
morally wrong. Of course Commun
ist morals are social morals, which
makes breaking strikes a crime
against society. Not many capital
istic college students believe in such
a standard of morality, and I am not
sure that I do either, but most of us
cherish some notion of bettering so
ciety in some way.
All anyone has got to do is to sleep
on the bug-infested mattresses the
shipowners call seamen's beds, and
to eat the hunks of fatty pork with
out a strip of lean they Call meat to
understand that the person who
scabs and thus helps maintain such
conditions should be sleeping in the
mattress along with the bugs.

IN 1934 that distinguished Stanford

and save San Francisco from the ter
ror that gripped it.
For those who saved San Francisco
rrom the terror in 1934, and to those
who may save San Francisco again
if the present strike goes on to the
npen warfare stage the rewards are
tremendous. Or so I am told, al
though I drew down a cool $23 a
month, which would hardly have
paid for my dentistry. But for the
longshoremen, (he pay was about a
dollar an hour, a dollar an hour from
employers who were so hard up for
help that even the worst loafer drew
a fat check. It was a lot better than
scraping squashed apricots out from
under the machines at the cannery
for 40 cents an hour, the Portuguese
cannery girls notwithstanding.
Bloody Beatings
And with such fine pay to be had
for the mere asking during a strike,
about the only argument against
scabbing that has any force is the
strictly materialistic argument that it
is healthier not to. Of course, not all
scabs get beat, at least the ones who
run fast don't get caught, but the
possibility of nasty consequences is
always there.
The beatings are bloody affairs,
since a strike is a matter of life and
death to those who strike and picket.
The pickets are not so foolish as to
attack man for man. Seven or eight
of them will nab one scabber, and a
youngster I knew saw seven or eight
of them hold the unfortunate strike
breaker while the others pounded
him to a pulp, jumped up and down
on him, robbed him of his money, an
all but rolled him in the bay when
the police squad car came booming
down the Embarcadero to break up
the party. And the mugs hired as
Pinkerton guards for the special oc
casion of the strike delight in telling
stories of men getting their noses
spread across their faces from ear to

ear.
A beating at the moment is not the
only danger to be incurred by break
ing strikes. For in the eyes of the
union there is no sin as unforgiv
able as scabbing, and the working
theory is, once a fink always a fink.
I take no stock in the wild tale I
heard about a man being refused
work in the Salinas lettuce sheds be
cause he was discovered to have
scabbed , in Minneapolis teamsters'
strike in 1901, but I disbelieve the
story only on the grounds that the
union couldn't have found out a
thing that happened at such a remote
point of time or space. The moral of
the story is that something like that
could happen.
For that reason, I weep for the law
students who picked a bit of spare
change in the strike and still hope to
dabble in politics a little later on. In
these days of the growing power of
the labor vote, the candidate who
| sports a dirty labor record while
rousing the rabble will not last long,
for scabbing, like murder, will out.
And a poor scab who has once scab
bed can never live it down as far as
the unions are concerned.

At this point the Communists and
other socially minded radicals will

claim that I have overlooked the
greatest point of all. that scabbing is
morally wrong. Of course Commun
ist morals are social morals, which
makes breaking strikes a crime
against society. Not many capital
istic college students believe in such
a standard of morality, and I am not
sure that I do either, but most of us
cherish some notion of bettering so
ciety in some way.
All anyone has got to do is to sleep
on the bug-infested mattresses the
shipowners call seamen's beds, and
to eat the hunks of fatty pork with
out a strip of lean they Call meat to
understand that the person who
scabs and thus helps maintain such
conditions should be sleeping in the
mattress along with the bugs.
