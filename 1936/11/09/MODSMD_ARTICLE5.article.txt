# Strike--â€”Over a Planked Steak
## 
### 
\fcfE wore talking about the im- |
pending longshoreman's strike
over one of the Union dining hall's
dollar dinners about four weeks ago.
Opposite me was a dynamic little
man, short, wiry, alert. He is the
spokesman for one of the employers'
associations involved in the present
strike, and his name appears fre
quently in the city papers these days.
We asked him if h? thought there
would be a strike before election.
"Our men are voting tonight," he
said. '"When I get back, they may
have gone out."
"Roosevelt has been trying to stall
it off, hasn't he?" we said.
"He can't hold them back. No one
can stop them. But they might as
well hold the strike and get it over
with. San Francisco has already lost
most of its shipping business.
"Waiting may not matter to others,
but I can see it will be the rtiin of
San Francisco."
Not Communism
Somebody suggested that the
Communists were responsible for the
strike.
"No," he replied. "The longshore
men do not have any political pro
gram. Communism is a rather subtle
philosophy. It takes a man who has
studied Econ 1 or 2 for two or three
quarters to understand it."
"Is Bridges a Communist?"

"No, I don't think he has any par
ticular philosophy either. He and his
men are the products of unrest.
Bridges sees the inequalities in the
present system, as can anyone who
does any thinking or any reading
these days. But they are trying to
tear down the existing system be
fore there's a better one worked out
to take its place."
He then recounted the employers'
point of view about the instability
and irresponsibility of Union leader
ship. told that the Unions broke their
promises, that their discipline over
their men was weak, that the closed
shop was impracticable because of
this.
He also told about his efforts
among the employers' associations to
get them to pay living wages, provide
better working conditions by appeal
ing to their enlightened self-interest,
be scientific in their relations with
their employees. But among the em
ployers, he encountered opposition,
and even in these groups there was
instability and irresponsibility on the
part of individual employers.
A Sincere Believer
Ho was very sincere, this man was.
It could be seen that, he was Very
keenly disillusioned. It could be seen
that he had taken Economics for at
least two quarters, that he had done
some reading and thinking. He was
not the ruthless capitalist of song and
story. A Stanford graduate out in
the world of action, he happened to
be in one of the sorest spots of our
social structure.
He could sfe that it wasn't a ques
tion anymore of plain right or wrong.
What was right for one was wrong
for another. He was aware that
forces beyond his control were caus
! ing men to beat up other men, that,
everywhere was instability and ir
responsibility, that selfishness and
greed on both sides was carrying to
its extreme, logical conclusion the
ugly and brutal implications of a
philosophy of self-interest.
As I looked at him over fny Union
planked steak, I could not say that I
envied him. H. J.

part of individual employers.
A Sincere Believer
Ho was very sincere, this man was.
It could be seen that, he was Very
keenly disillusioned. It could be seen
that he had taken Economics for at
least two quarters, that he had done
some reading and thinking. He was
not the ruthless capitalist of song and
story. A Stanford graduate out in
the world of action, he happened to
be in one of the sorest spots of our
social structure.
He could sfe that it wasn't a ques
tion anymore of plain right or wrong.
What was right for one was wrong
for another. He was aware that
forces beyond his control were caus
! ing men to beat up other men, that,
everywhere was instability and ir
responsibility, that selfishness and
greed on both sides was carrying to
its extreme, logical conclusion the
ugly and brutal implications of a
philosophy of self-interest.
As I looked at him over fny Union
planked steak, I could not say that I
envied him. H. J.
\fcfE wore talking about the im- |
pending longshoreman's strike
over one of the Union dining hall's
dollar dinners about four weeks ago.
Opposite me was a dynamic little
man, short, wiry, alert. He is the
spokesman for one of the employers'
associations involved in the present
strike, and his name appears fre
quently in the city papers these days.
We asked him if h? thought there
would be a strike before election.
"Our men are voting tonight," he
said. '"When I get back, they may
have gone out."
"Roosevelt has been trying to stall
it off, hasn't he?" we said.
"He can't hold them back. No one
can stop them. But they might as
well hold the strike and get it over
with. San Francisco has already lost
most of its shipping business.
"Waiting may not matter to others,
but I can see it will be the rtiin of
San Francisco."
Not Communism
Somebody suggested that the
Communists were responsible for the
strike.
"No," he replied. "The longshore
men do not have any political pro
gram. Communism is a rather subtle
philosophy. It takes a man who has
studied Econ 1 or 2 for two or three
quarters to understand it."
"Is Bridges a Communist?"

"No, I don't think he has any par
ticular philosophy either. He and his
men are the products of unrest.
Bridges sees the inequalities in the
present system, as can anyone who
does any thinking or any reading
these days. But they are trying to
tear down the existing system be
fore there's a better one worked out
to take its place."
He then recounted the employers'
point of view about the instability
and irresponsibility of Union leader
ship. told that the Unions broke their
promises, that their discipline over
their men was weak, that the closed
shop was impracticable because of
this.
He also told about his efforts
among the employers' associations to
get them to pay living wages, provide
better working conditions by appeal
ing to their enlightened self-interest,
be scientific in their relations with
their employees. But among the em
ployers, he encountered opposition,
and even in these groups there was
instability and irresponsibility on the
part of individual employers.
