well-written review.)
ROADSIDE," by Lynn Riggs,
presented by Dramatic- Council last
Friday in the Assembly Ilall.

4 SIMPLE, unpretentious play,
well adapted to a university
production and a university audi
ence, "Roadside" was well received.
The cast, which consisted of a not
unfamiliar group of "hill-billy"
characters, contributed some excel
lent performances. It must be ad
mitted that the actors were at a con
siderable disadvantage. Their vehicle
was not a strong one. The lines were
good, the characters were well
drawn, but the plot was trite.
A Wild Mountain Lass
"Roadside" takes place in the
backwoods in the year 15)05. Hannie
Rader, a wild mountain lass, is trav
eling in her father's covered wagon,
and she is being pursuaded by her
dried-up ex-husband, whom she
married while in a dreadful state of
ignorance. "The" man comes along
in the form of Texas, a likeable,
handsome, he-man, who lists im
maculate conception among his min
or qualifications. The fact that Texas
has had a slight encounter with the
law forms a skeleton for the slight
plot to hang on.
The outstanding performance was
given by Geraldine Schreiber in the
juicy role of Hannie Rader. She gave
the part all the necessary verve,
freshness, and earthy comedy. Miss
Schreiber's moments of pathos were
weak, but they were completely
overshadowed by the excellence of
her characterization as a whole.
James Corner gave a clean-cut pre
sentation of the heroic Texas, lie
injected a great deal of personal
charm into the role, and did not
overstress the of the
bold, bad man.
Slapstick Sccncs
From the standpoint of dramatic
construction, the slapstick courtroom
scene was inexcusable, but the audi
ence enjoyed it to the fullest extent.
As Judge jßnodgrass (the old bur
lesque character), Richard McCarty
was perfection itself. He played the
scene for all it was worth with very
amusing results. Phil Brown and
Edmund Kerr revived another old
vaudeville act in the roles of Red Ike
and Black Ike, and they gave excel
lent comedy performances. As Btizzy
Hale, the rejected suitor, George
Campbell contributed the only weyk
characterization of the play. It was
greatly overdone, which is a common
fault iti character parts in amateur
productions. Jack Beaty, Howard
Roberts, and Janet Dole filled the
minor roles very well.
Since the Dramatic Council gives

but one production a quarter, "Road
side" was not a wise choice. It
wouldn't last three nights on Broad
way. When there is so much excel
lent material available, it seems
rather senseless to waste time on an
inferior vehicle. Gordon C. Lange's
direction of "Roadside" was good. He
deserves praise for the color, fresh
ness, and zest of his production. Oro
ville Goldner's settings and cost unit 1
were most effective.
Why must the audience at an in
stitution of higher learning audibly
gasp for breath when it hears a word
it is very familiar with, even though
it is not recommended by Emily
Post?
