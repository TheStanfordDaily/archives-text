# Dated Men and Dateless Women
## 
### 
Stanford women may gather in 1
lonely groups on the second floor of
Lagunita or houses on the Row on
Friday and Saturday nights or they
may stag it to Solaris in San Fran
cisco with their sorority sisters. 13ut
il they do. they c.m't blame Stanford
men for dateless week-ends.
University registration figures
show that there are approximately
three men to every woman on the j
Stanford campus; a survey made j
over the week-end in IS fraternities i
and three eating clubs shows that
more than one-third of the Stanford
men dale women on Friday and Sat
urday nights. There are enough
available dating men who don't stay
home or don't go <>n stag parlies to
lake out every Stanford eo-ed. II
the Stanford co-eds can't meet the
competition from Mills, Cal and Paly
High well, that is something again.

Last Friday night a survey take n
in all the 'houses and clubs on the
campus showed th il out of 522 Stan
ford men, IST dated women, IS2 went

stayed in their house or hall rooms.
< )| the IS7 dates on Friday night, 21
were blind dates, and of Ihe 172 dates
on Saturday night 17 were blinds.
, Leading daters of the week-end
among fraternities and eating clubs
were El Campo with a total of 53
dates foi Friday and Saturday nights,
the Kappa Sii;s with !>1 dates, and the
Alpha Sig- with '!â€¢$ dates. The
dates with I* for both nights, while
' the Delta Chi s were next with (i

blind dales.
The fewest number of dates were
in the Chi Psi and Beta houses, the
Chi Psi's having only 5 dates for the
entire week-end and the Betas 7.
Of course, these figure s do not in
clude the brothers who were o[T the
campus, but the Chi Psi's still look
suspiciously woman shy since they
boast of having .17 .-tags, during the
week-end.
