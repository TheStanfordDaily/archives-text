# Air Audition Draws Farm Radio Talent
## Seven Coast Universities Will Be Honored On New Program Series 
### HARRY PRESS 
"If we listen to as much talent to
morrow as we did today, it's going
to be very easy to pick the acts to
appear on Stanford's Night," en
thused Carl Sulzbacher, chief audi
tioner for the new series of pro
grams, "Salute to California Col
leges."
Over 40 acts tried out yesterday
afternoon and night in the Assembly
Hall. The talent included, besides
many singers, several skits, a tap
dancer, a clarinet and accordion duet,
and Doodles Weaver.
Auditions today will be held in the
Women's Clubhouse from 2-4, and
7-9, not in the Assembly Hall, as
previously announced.
To Use Mike
Reviewing the talent as it comes
over the mike will be Sulzbacher and
Leon d'Usscau. The former has been
in charge'of auditioning for the well
known "California's Hour" program,
and has heard over 15,000 "tryout
ees," while d'Usseau has hunted for
new faces, figures, and voices all
over the world for the picture stu
dios.
In this series, each of seven Cali
fornia colleges will have its night on
the air. To be honored are U.C.L.A.,
Stanford, California, U.S.C., Mills,
College of the Pacific, and Pomona.
The program, plus the college talent,
will present Conrad Nagel as master
of ceremonies, David Broekman's 30-
piece orchestra, a mixed glee choir of
20 voices, and a guest star. A salute
to the college being honored will be
given by Nagel.
No Registration Needed
"There is no pre-registration ne
quired," said Sulzbacher. "All those
who come to the auditions will have
a chance to try out. We will furnish
an accompanist, but students must
bring their own music."
Those who are chosen for the pro
gram will receive $25 in cash, a free
trip to Los Angeles and back, plus
the opportunity to compete for $165
more and another Los Angeles trip. '
