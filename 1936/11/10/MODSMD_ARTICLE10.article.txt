# Roth Justifies Student Control Of Farm Traffic
## 
### 
Answering constant questions con
cerning Men's and Women's Coun
cils' jurisdiction over campus traffic,
Comptroller A. E. Roth made the
following statement:
"Men's and Women's Councils op
erate under authority which is dele
gated to it by the University authori
ties. The basis of its authority is the
same as for any other method of stu
dent conduct or discipline. Univer
sity traffic regulations which are set
up by Men's and Women's Councils
with the approval of the University
have the same authority as any other
regulation affecting student con
duct.
"I am convinced," concluded Mr.
Roth, "that the Men's and Women's
Councils have done a line piece of
community service in assuming re
sponsibility for traffic regulations,
and that the results achieved under
this system are far more satisfactory,
both from the standpoint of the Uni
versity and the students, than they
would be if we were to turn the mat
ter over to civil authorities."
The two councils also have juris
diction over Honor Code Cases and
both Men's and Women's Councils
reported yesterday that there have
been no violations of the Honor
Code brought before them this
quarter.
Mary Beiford, chairman of Wom
en's Council, stated that this is quite
an improvement over last year. It is
hoped that this record may be kept
up. However, any violations or sus
pected violations should be reported
to the Councils in order to insure the
carrying out of the Code.
