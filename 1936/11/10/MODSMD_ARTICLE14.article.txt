# Madrid Junta Fears Revolt Within City
## Military Government To Confiscate All Private Arms and Munitions 
### 
MADRID, Tuesday, Nov. 10 (U.R).—
Fear of the military junta in control
of Madrid that Fascist sympathizers
concealed within the city will rise
against the Popular Front defenders
was indicated today.
Col. Jose Miaja, chief of the junta,
signed a decree giving all citizens 24
hours in which to deliver arms they
may possess to police stations.
At the end of the 24-hour period
any unauthorized person found pos
sessing arms "will be considered an
enemy of the constituted authorities
and subject to military trial."
Members of the government's de
fense forces, leaders of syndicalist
organizations, and citizens who have
been mobilized by the defense junta
are exempt from terms of the dccree.
MADRID, Nov. 9 (U.R).—Rebel ar
tillery and airplanes pounded Ma
drid with bombs today, killing at
least 10 persons and wounding 160
others. The insurgent infantry, how
ever, was unable to advance.
Artillery shells burst into build
ings in the central business district,
opening gaping holes and creating
panic among the population. A
bomb struck a nursery in a district
where rebels had announced women
and children would be safe. Miracu
lously no one was killed.
Meanwhile, the insurgents at
tempted futilely to push their lines
further into the city. Again today
there was bloody fighting in the
Casa de Campo, just across the Man
zanares River from the royal palace,
but the rebels were held south of
the river.
Terrific bombardment of the city
from rebel positions in the south and
to the west began at 8 a.m. Two
shells, obviously directed from the
same battery, came whistling into a
room just above the Oriental Cafe
in the Puerta del Sol. Madrid's
"Times Square."
The shells barely cleared the Min
istry of the Interior on the other side
of the square. They dropped into
the cafe, which is next to the Ameri
can Hotel, and exploded with a deaf
ening roar, wrecking the place. No
one was in the cafe or the rooms
above it. The American Hotel was
not damaged.

MADRID, Tuesday, Nov. 10 (U.R).—
Fear of the military junta in control
of Madrid that Fascist sympathizers
concealed within the city will rise
against the Popular Front defenders
was indicated today.
Col. Jose Miaja, chief of the junta,
signed a decree giving all citizens 24
hours in which to deliver arms they
may possess to police stations.
At the end of the 24-hour period
any unauthorized person found pos
sessing arms "will be considered an
enemy of the constituted authorities
and subject to military trial."
Members of the government's de
fense forces, leaders of syndicalist
organizations, and citizens who have
been mobilized by the defense junta
are exempt from terms of the dccree.
MADRID, Nov. 9 (U.R).—Rebel ar
tillery and airplanes pounded Ma
drid with bombs today, killing at
least 10 persons and wounding 160
others. The insurgent infantry, how
ever, was unable to advance.
Artillery shells burst into build
ings in the central business district,
opening gaping holes and creating
panic among the population. A
bomb struck a nursery in a district
where rebels had announced women
and children would be safe. Miracu
lously no one was killed.
Meanwhile, the insurgents at
tempted futilely to push their lines
further into the city. Again today
there was bloody fighting in the
Casa de Campo, just across the Man
zanares River from the royal palace,
but the rebels were held south of
the river.
Terrific bombardment of the city
from rebel positions in the south and
to the west began at 8 a.m. Two
shells, obviously directed from the
same battery, came whistling into a
room just above the Oriental Cafe
in the Puerta del Sol. Madrid's
"Times Square."
The shells barely cleared the Min
istry of the Interior on the other side
of the square. They dropped into
the cafe, which is next to the Ameri
can Hotel, and exploded with a deaf
ening roar, wrecking the place. No
one was in the cafe or the rooms
above it. The American Hotel was
not damaged.
