# Local Barristers Hold Moot Court
## Row, Hall Committees Will Canvass Campus 
### 
In the first of a series of prelimi
nary trials in the Stanford Moot
Court, Barney Dreyfus and Tom
Moroney opposed Tom Hamilton and
Keith Stable in a case involving a
company's stock purchase plan, with
Joseph Bingham, law professor, act
ing as judge.
Continuing tonight, tomorrow
night, and the first three days of next
week, these cases will include the
trial of an assault and battery charge
arising from a football game. All
sessions of the "court" will begin at
7:15.
In tonight's session, Moroney and
Dreyfus were judged as having the
best case and the best briefs, but
Hamilton and Stahle were especially
commended for their skillful defense
of the weaker side.
