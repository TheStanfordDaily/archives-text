When the frequent campus visi
tors from Sweden or Australia ar
rive at Che Memorial Court one of
two things happens: they meet Frank
Taylor or they meet Les Forrest.
Either way they are informed of
every phase of Stanford life and see
all worth-while views of the Chapel.
Both of them, with a silent part
ner who wants to remain that way,
are in complete charge of the pic
ture stand midway between the
biology building and the; Assembly
Hall. Every day from 10 till 4 they
sell photographic views of the cam
pus, booklets on the architecture and
history, answer questions.
Questions Are "Screwy"
' The questions are the screwiest
part of it." Les Forrest confides. "We
have to memorize all the literature
on the traditions and stuff, so any
thing like 'Where is Hoover's home?'
and 'How would the Indians stack
up against Minnesota?' and 'Is it
true that everyone on the campus is
j Republican?' is OK. We can try to
I answer that. But when some Italian

woman comes up after the Chapel
tour and says that she 'never knew
before that Eve was a blonde; how
did it happen?' it gets pretty bad."
Only last week a civil engineer
from Japan said that he had come
over expressly to see the stadium, in
order to got ideas for one near
Osaka, Japan. A great percentage of
the visitors to the campus are from
Australia, New Zealand, going to
England and Canada. Sweden and
Germany come next on the list of
foreign sightseers, Taylor said. In
one bus-load making the peninsula
tour were a lady from Oklahoma
who came all tho way to see the
Chapel, one from Indiana, and sev
eral from Texas. A Texas Univer
sity tenor said that he was disap
pointed in Stanfordâ€”it was "too
quiet, peaceful, more like a teachers'
college." Not many of the tourists
come from the peninsula district.
The stand makes monthly from
$100 during the tourist season to $50
in the winter, according to Mrs. Irene
Coverley, appointment secretary.
Aside from sales the managers

charge a dollar for conducting
groups through the Chapel. One
man, usually a senior, buys all the
stock, has two assistants appointed
to him and divides the profits, selling
I his part of the merchandise to a
| successor when he graduates. The
| positions are competitive, all appli
j cants having to study for two months
. facts about Stanford, its founding
I and customs, before passing a regu-
I lar quiz. The highest are selected if
I their personality and talking ability
! are good.
| "These boys are the representa
tives of the University to the casual
| visitor," Mrs. Coverley explained,
i "and we want to have them give the
| best impression possible."
