### 
"I have been impressed again and
again with the vitality which Amer
ican education possesses in the
hands of a fine teacher," Dr. Verna
Carley said last night in opening the
first of the series of talks in the
newly resumed Stanford Radio Hour
from station KGO.
Dr. Carley, who is associate pro
fessor of education and Director of
Teacher Training, spoke on the topic
"The Critical Role of the Teacher in
the Modern School.''
Designating the teacher as the
most important single influence in
Ihe school environment, the speaker
pointed out, "In every modern school
functions never before delegated to
the teacher are increasing steadily
as the recognition of the importance
of the teacher as the central, the de
termining factor, in all aspects of
the educational program becomes
more apparent."
Good scholarship, an attractive
personality, high professional inter
est, a rich cultural background, abil
ity to speak effectively, and a demo
cratic viewpoint are only a few of
the requisites which Dr. Carley
would impose upon the teacher who
seeks a place in the modern school.
