# Ex Committee Plans Nite Club
## May Get Golf Clubhouse For Friday Dance 
### 
With the success of last Friday's
afler-"Roadside" nitery still ringing
in their ears, Ex Committee will
slide into their upholstered chairs
around their long, oval table tonight
to "do something about it."
Probable outcome of tonight's dis
cussion: another nitery "experiment"
this week-end, perhaps in the golf
clubhouse. Another campus spot up
for consideration is the Old Roble
Gym. Its lack of fountain facilities
and ultra-barnlikeness may work
against it.
Ex Committee will also consider
Student Manager Chuck Fontius'
proposed plan for disbursement of
Daily funds for "local art"—pictures
of campus activities.
Fontius believes a new set-up,
possibly a special committee of him
self, the Daily editor, and business
manager, could budget these ex
penditures more systematically.
Under the current Ex Committee
ruling, the Daily gets 15 cents a
quarter from each student's com
munity fees to use exclusively for
picture-taking and engraving ex
penses.
Whether or not Men's or Women's
Council members must attend off
campus dances to make such dances
"legal" will be decided once and for
all.
The plan for the A.S.S.U. to finance
national exploitation of this year's
Gaieties songs has been investigated
this past week by Committeemen
Shirley Jones and Bob Mallett. They
will report, the Committee will ap
prove or disapprove granting $30 for
the promotion scheme.
