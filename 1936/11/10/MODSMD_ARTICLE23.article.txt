# Chappie Humor Hits Big Game
## Bears, Indians Cavort In Rhyme, Pictures 
### 
Not only football, but Stanford
lore in all its phases—from love on
the Quad to barber shop surgery —
gets a play in the forthcoming Big
Game number of the Farm's humor
magazine on sale November 19.
From the glaring four-color cover
to the cigarette ad on the last page,
the Big Game number is funny. Old
standbys, Jack Scott, Winstead
Weaver, Bob Hartmann, and Curtis
Prendergast rub shoulders with the
Class of '40, and other newcomers.
But while the November Chappie
laughs at "Modern Trends in Adver
tising," by newcomers Harrison Ste
phens, and publishes the memoirs of
Winstead Weaver in "Forty Years of
Eligibility," it doesn't forget the cur
rent theme of the football classic
with Cal. Especially, Jim Maclnnis
doesn't forget it. in "The Hair of the
Bear," while the "Thornhilliard" of
Marco Thome, Bob Hartmann, and
Gilman Gist renders the event into
immortal poetry for the sake of pos
terity.
The art work, sprinkled through
out the pages of the Big Game issue,
contains more than football, too,
though Rodell Johnson goes the lim
it on biblical relations between bears
and Indians.
