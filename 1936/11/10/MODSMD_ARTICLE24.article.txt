# Body Discovered At Yacht Harbor
## 
### 
A body dragged out of the Palo
Alto Yacht Harbor Sunday noon had
not yet been identified yesterday
morning, according to Deputy Coro- I
ner Provenzano of San Jose.
The body was found on the mud I
flats near Charleston Slough by two
young duck hunters, Patrick Fogar
ty, 17, and Theodore Jones, 14, 11
Melville Avenue. It was taken to
the Roller and Hapgood Funeral
Parlors, from where it was removed
to the coroner's office at San Jose for
observation. As the body was hardly
more than a skeleton, nothing could
be determined except that it was a
heavy-set man about 6 feet tall. The
shoes, which were workman's, were
the only articles of clothing in good
eondit ion.
"We can only guess the amount of ,
time it has been there," said Mr.
Provenzano.
He added that the body is being
examined for bullet wounds or other
marks to determine the nature of
death, and the clothing is being gone
over for laundry marks to aid in
identification.
