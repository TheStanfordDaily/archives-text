# 'Roadside' Makes Profit, Breaks Attendance Record Of Two-Year Period
## Second Nitery Crowded As Students Jam Lobby after Play 
### 
Willi more than 650 tickets being
sold for Friday night's Dramatic
Council presentation of "Roadside,"
attendance at the play was better
than that at any production last
year or the year before. Back-to
the-Farm movement was also noted
in the crowded Nitery following the
play, and in Saturday's well-at
tended A.S.S.U. dance.
According to A.S.S.U. Office sta
tistics, "Roadside" was the first dra
matic product, other than the Gaie
ties and the Spring Musicals, to
make a financial profit in several
years. Attendance topped last au
tumn quarter's presentation by more
than 200.
Dance Successful
That the Nitery is now a thing
accomplished was proved by the
success of Friday evening's affair,
when over over 250 couples jammed
the A.S.S.U. lobby for the second
time in one week.
Decorated in a simple crepe paper
motif featuring the purple and gold
of Washington plus Stanford's red
and white, the unenlarged dance
hall saw a steady influx of people,
including a goodly number of stags
who ignored the sign reading "Cut
up: Don't Cut In'' to advantage. Most
of the customers were after-theater
dancers from "Roadside."
Cellar to Stay Open
The Cellar fountain, open for the
first time in modern Stanford his
tory until 1:00, reported exactly
twice as much trade for the hour
11:00 to midnight as last timeâ€”l4o
ring-ups vs. 70 for Saturday's Hal
lowe'en Nitery. From 12:00 to 1:00,
4(5 checks were rung up.
The evening's cash business totaled
over $29 as against the $9.05 for
Saturday's one-hour extension. Miss
Christine Ricker, who arranged for
keeping the Cellar open, says that
she is willing to carry on this con
venience as long as long as the Ni
tery is kept at A.S.S.U. lobby and
the students wish it.
Planning to carry on experimenta
tion in various location before a per
manent night spot is built. Student
Body President Jim Reynolds re
ported no work had been done on
the next Nitery dance, but suggested
probable trial of the golf coursc
country club.
