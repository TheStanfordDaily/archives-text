SWEET ADKUNE
The sign at Beltramo's which
used to warn ladies and gents not of
legal age to stay out seems to have
shrunk these days in comparison to
(he enormous new banner close by
which now informs the patrons that
yodelers and general noise - makers
will be bounced.
It may be that the suburban neigh
bors next door have complained, but
it may be that old Alex Beltraino has
at last observed that fundamental
fact relative to college students—
beer and noise.
* «i *
The fundamental fact relative to
beery college students and noise is
that college students feel that one
smell of a beer bottle imposes upon
them the duty to cut up, chase
around the rafters after rats, and
raise their voices in a sloppy version
(if Sweet Adeline. And the reason
, hat flaming youth feels the unholy
iirge to make noise and sing the
tiresome ditty is that it has been
\/caned on one great pulpy mass of
1 quid propaganda relative to beer
drinking.
For years the "selected short sub
jects" at the moving picture shows
and the nondescript collection of
v, udeville acts showing on the Or
j/'.eum circuit have had reproduc
tions of the famous old scene where
i; college boys ol the turn of the
c< ltury, in turtle neck sweaters up
t< their ears, down a tankard or two,
th ■11 lean back against the bar and
hi rmonize "Sweet Adeline" with the
u 1 man sailing off in a half-yodel
while the others pause for breath at
th end of a phrase.
t matters little that "Sweet Ade
llnj" is a song of another generation.
'] h i loud-mouthed boys of our own
.it eration feel that they, too, are
re. ular fellers just like the old guys
tl.'i.t used to sing beer-hall quartets,
in - !-. '1 must sing so that everyone
around them will notice what fine
j( liy fellers they are. So they lift
u;; their voices and blatt, to borrow
a word from Snuffy Smith, boda
ciojsly and raucously.
The beer-hall boys may be bad
t!it- way they put on the fancy poses
v hen they drink beer, but they are
> ! poor relations of the boys who
c iik champagne and immediately
ume the air of gay Bohemians on
l/inge. After all, beer is a bour
; ' t is drink, whereas it takes a real
onnoisseur to appreciate cham
pH.c;ne, and the added advantage of
champagne is that if you think
you're not getting much you can look
;t all Ihe lead seals on the top and
the crests and pedigrees all over the
1.-ii.el to make sure you're getting all
yoa paid for. In that respect, cham
pagne is just like an orchid, which
smells very pretty because the per
fume from the flower is a delicious
o 1 >r of five and ten-dollar bills that
car. be detected even at a distance.
i wonder how much champagne
wt aid be sold if it cost 50 cents a
<y . trt, or how many "Sweet Adeline"
cii /ruses would be rendered if no
or. • had foisted upon the race the
r< ten tradition that people with
be r must sing. After all, what's the
iu < of drinking champagne if nobody
e; i see you are drinking it, and
v. iat's the use of singing "Sweet
A ieline" unless it is to let people
r: lice that you have had a smell at
i: beer bottle?
