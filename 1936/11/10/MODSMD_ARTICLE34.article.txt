# Churchman Talks on Culture Tonight
## 
### 
Dr. Albert W. Beaven will talk on
"Contemporary Culture in the
Christian World" tonight at 7:30 in
the Assembly Hall. The speaker has
twice been president of the Federal
Council of Churches of Christ in
America, and is now president of the
Colgate-Rochester Theological Sem
inary at Rochester, N.Y.
Dr. Beaven is now traveling with
the National Preaching Mission as
one of its principal speakers. His
lecture here, however, will not be
one of the regular mission talks.
The speech will be Dr. Beaven's
analysis of our present civilization,
based on his recent tour of the world,
and the Christian solution for its ills.
In this way, he will show the way to
a rejuvenation of the world's total
culture. In connection with this, Dr.
Eeaven will tell briefly of the Na
tional Preaching Mission, its pur
poses, its actions, and its results.
