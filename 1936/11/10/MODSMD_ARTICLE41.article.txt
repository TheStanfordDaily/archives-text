## 
### 
Paly theaters hung out the S.R.O.
sign over the week-end despite am
bitious attempts last week to organ
ize an effective boycott.
Original plans called tor co-opera
tion of Hall and Row men. When the
Row gracefully declined to detail
pickets because of arduous rushing
activities a petition was circulated
among Hall men by Bill Schultz of
Branner which gained 29 signers in
half an hour. Signers agreed to
picket in ten-minute shifts.
But no picketing occurred!
Schultz in explaining the failure of
the plan said that he had to work and
so could do none of the actual organ
izing. Dan Holtom. who helped with
the preliminaries, estimated that
only one in ten of the signers would
actually have picketed anyway.
However, signers contacted by The
Daily reasserted their willingness to
work and expressed surprise that
they had" not been called upon. In
the words of Paul Hartman and
Woodrow Miller they "were only
waiting for someone to tell them
when and where."
