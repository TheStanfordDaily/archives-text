## SPEAKING OF THE ROSE BOWL 
### 
Everybody after the game Satur
day was asking his neighbor about
the Rose Bcnvl.
Any tinie you think the Stanfords
art lethargic and uninterested con
cerning matters of the gridiron, just
waft the New Year's Day Classic,
with its extra day of vacation, its
trip to the celebrating southland, and
its extra month of football publicity,
in front of their collective nose, and
you get as .'inc a stimulus as any.
And so, after .tieing the league
leaders Saturday, and hearing of the
Washington Stale and U.S.C. defeats,
there were a lot of people scratching
their heads and thinking.
Well, we'i > out, so forget that. But
the rest of it is still a race. Santa
Clara (and Santa Barbara State) will
not be invited because they are out
side the steely grip which the Pa
cific Coast Conference holds on the
selection.
Washington looks the best bet
right now, but they have been tied
once, and a loss would knock them
out of the ring. The Huskies play
U.S.C. next week â€” you've seen
U.S.C., and Washington State No
vember 2(>. Those all-Washington
games are blood-burners.
