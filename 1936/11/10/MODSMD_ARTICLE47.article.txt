# WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TROJANS
## 
### 
U.S.C. looked all right until Cali
fornia dropped them last Saturday,
and why California should drop them
no one knows. Grant that the Cal 13
points could have been predicted, bul
why couldn't. Troy pulverize those
tackles? Aie they as good as all
that? Something was wrong.
Washington State, the other seem
ing possibility, still has U.C.L.A.
and Washington to whip, something
of a task for anyone's team, and,
having lost 16-(> to the Oregon State
Beavers and tied U.S.C. 0-0. seems a
short-end bet at this stage.
One thing sure irritates: All the
whining on the Stanford campus
after Cal beat U.S.C. Why this? We
haven't much love for Stub Allison
and his college, no, but they've lost
four already, and that's degrading
enough. Let 'em beat the Trojans;
few other people will, and it makes
theVonferenee race more interesting.
I've heard, "Cal has a ball team,
but gee, don't let 'em know it," and
"That means they're a lot better'n
we are, and we'll lose to them." and
"I'm already getting scared of that
Big Game."
Children, what prattle Our guys,
as they stand, are a couple of touch
downs better than Cal .and some of
you can remember how much better
we do in Bit; Games that are 2 to 1
against us
Then, too, the"re a week away, and
all reports coming from Portland in
dicate that Oregon State is, 1 all kid -
ding aside, considerable of an im
proved ball club:
