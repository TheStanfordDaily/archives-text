High spot in yesterday's prelimi
naries of the nÂ« .ce boxing tourney
was the first round technical K.O. of
Jack Grover over Oliver Kirven.
Grover rushed right in as soon as
the gong rang, slugging and banging
for all he was worth.
Because he kepi a poor guard,
Kirven was repeatedly bashed in the
face, not being able to get an effec
tive punch in edgewise. Toward the
end of the round refere Fred Glober
took pity and declared the K.O.
which gave Grover the fight. The
two boys were matched in the 159-
pound division.

this afternoon at 4 o'clock. The
judges were Jake Irwin and Myron
Sprague. Al Valarde, former Stan
ford man, was referee for the first
two bouts. Fred Glober officiated for
the rest of the fight. This afternoon

light-heavyweight division, several
others in the 129. 139, 149, and 159-
pound divisions.
