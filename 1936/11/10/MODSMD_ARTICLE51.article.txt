In the other games, participants will
be divided according to class.
up or down three or four teams,
and about 40 men have seen action.
Every man out there has scrim
maged, and done plenty of it. An
entirely new team played the first
10 minutes in the Little Big Game,
to get numerals!
Yep, the Frosh worked hard, but
they enjoyed it because Shipkey
gave them a chance to show. Is that
like Bradshaw?
