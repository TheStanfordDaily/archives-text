# Zagar, Luckett, Stone Win Grid Awards in Husky Tilt
## 
### 
Roaring Renfrew, the Cle Elum j
flash more commonly known as Pete |
Zagar, caught the judges' eye Satur
day afternoon in the Washington
fracas ,and as a result he is now the
possessor of a brand new fountain
pen given weekly by David Keeble,
Palo Alto merchant.
There were times during the day
when the B.A.C. Bard, Don Lieben
dorfer, sounded like a phonograph
stuck on one groove as he called off
the name of the tackier on series of
plays, Zagar, Zagar, Zagar.
Don Luckett bit himself off a
mouthful of jaw exercise by kicking
a pair of ultra-necessary conversions
to win the Robert Elmer Dakan

award of gum, gum, and gum. Ho
also was the gentleman who got a
couple of sticky fingers on a pass
that Ear] Hoos didn't think anybody
could catch.
Grant Stone, the end nobody on
the coast knew much about until a
few weeks ago, came through with
another sizzler Saturday that earned
him one of Wiley Smith's weekly
traveling bag awards. 01' No. 46
slithered through Husky interferers
constantly like a breath of wind to
earn with Vie Bottari of Cal the
Examiner cartoonist's suitcases.
Jake Brigham, triple threat full
hack, completed the haul by drawing
down one of the Hatlo hats. Bob
Herwig of Cal got the other.
