## Card Chances Bright As Maloney Drills Eleven To Correct Mistakes 
### 
The UCLA soccermen are this |
week proving to bay region teams I
that they are really an ambitious and
durable bunch of players. With a
traveling squad of 18 men they yes
terday played the University of San
Francisco, this afternoon at 3:!>0
o'clock they meet the Stanford elev
en, and tomorrow they go up to Ber
keley to do battle with California's
winning ball club.
Although the invaders are not
members of the local conference,
they annually arrange one or two J
matches with Stanford. Last spring, j
Coach Harry Maloney took his Cards
down to West wood and they came
home with all the honors. Chances
for a repeat victory appear bright,
but Coach Maloney sent his men
through a long drill last night in an
effort to correct the mistakes in the
tie game with U.S.F. Saturday. He
said that the team played first class
soccer but hoped to tone down the
spirited yet erratic play of the inside
men, Chalmers and Dibble.
In the San Francisco game, the 22-
minute quarters showed to be such
a strain that two 35-minute halves
may be employed this afternoon. Be
sides Chalmers and Dibble at inside
left and right, the starting line-up
includes Helms at goal, Hanna and
Richardson at the two back posts,
Captain Hall at center half flanked
by Hawkins and Sloane, Schaupp
and Parker at right and left outside,
respectively, and Lowe at center
forward.
A new treatment for opium ad
dicts, by giving them a hypodermic
| of the serum in a blister from their
own bodies, is described in "Modern
Medicine." Two injections are de
clared to wipe out the desire fox
opium. ,
