# Cards Practice tor Beavers; Husky Enigmas Baffle Fans
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
When all the Husky pelts and In
dian war paint* were cleared off
the Stadium battle ground last Sat
urday, there were a few minor enig
mas and causes for speculation left
floating through the air.
Agreed upon is the fact that both
squads played GO minutes of gruel- |
ling, thrilling, and clean football. .
Tiny Thornhill has only praise for
Jimmy Phelan and his squad, and
Phelan wholeheartedly lauds Thorn
hill and his men.
Penalties Question
There were a couple of occasions,
nevertheless, when some of the out
spoken customers questioned de
cisions on the field. Referee Tommy
Louttit didn't approve of Jimmy
Coffis' take-drop to the weak side,
ruled it dead where the ball was
touched to the ground. The play has
been used in two previous games and
wasn't questioned.
The other was a roughness pen
alty on Calvelli for tackling Ctiin out
of bounds; this, different from the
foregoing, was a question of fact,
not rule. Could Calvelli avoid hit -

ting Cain out of bounds or couldn't
he? Neither of the two decisions in
fluenced greatly the outcome of the
game, and were soon forgotten by all
concerned except the newspaper I
quarterbacks.
Hamilton Stronger
The Claude Callaway situation was
much less tense last night, as the big
rugged tackle reported to practice
and ran pk'ys with the first team,
shoulder notwithstanding. What was
originally labeled a broken bone
turned out to be no more than a bad
bruise, according to the X-rays. >
Glenn Hamilton is passing and run
ning well looking stronger every
day.
Of equal importance is the ques
tion: how good i.s Oregon State?
They were good enough last Satur
day to down Washington State, now
tied with Southern California at sec- |
ond place on the Conference ladder.
The Beavers, with Joe Gray in
the lead role, outclassed the pass
tossing Cougars at their own game
this fact alone i.s their biggest threat.
