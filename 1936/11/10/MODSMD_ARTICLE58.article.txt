# The 						Daily Takes Its Mid-term
## 
### 
Got a chance to sleep over the week-end.
Got a chance to relax. Got a chance to think
about things. For the last couple of days, I've
been hearing again among the students what
I hadn't heard for quite a while. It may be that
I hadn't been among the students enough to
hear it, but it also may be that the honeymoon
is over. What I've been hearing is that same old
cry: "What's the matter with The Daily?" So I
boned up on back files of The Daily, and pre
pared to take my mid-term.
I. Why doesn't my story get in the paper?
This comes under the classification of the
usual gripe. Ever since I've been on the sheet,
I've heard organization managers come scream
ing in, because their notice seemingly was
crowded out of the paper by such things as
"Deciduous trees can be transplanted after their
leaves turn color," even after they had person
ally drilled into the head of the night editor the
importance of their story.
Slips such as this come under the head of
interdepartmental stupidity. Personal drilling
into the head of the night editor may result only
in a faint buzzing sound in the heads of the
copy editor, copy reader, proof reader, lino
typer, and make-up man. Sole remedy seems
to be the development of high personal effi
ciency on the part of each cog in the machine.
Has this volume of The Daily done this? No.
11. What's the matter with campus coverage?
This quarter's paper has been so busy piping
the flight of the unusual that it hasn't settled
clown to covering the important, but routine
stuff. What's really going on in the depart
ments? What are the changes being made by
administrators to keep up with the larger stu
dent body? What attempts are being made
io keep up with the larger student body? What
attempts are being made to improve Stanford
education? How about the new buildings? Why
is Ex Committee interested in dance chaper
ones? What is the cold dope on Reg Dance
profits?
Of course, I can answer that The Daily has
never adequately covered these, that we are
so used to having people drilling in our heads,
that we can't climb out of the rut of canned
copy journalism. That is no reason, though,
why we shouldn't.
111. What has been done that is editorially con
structive?
Right now, I am having a slight hang-over
ill the matter of the theater boycott. I've been
around here long enough to know that it is
impossible to organize this student body for a
boycott. I've also been around long enough to
know that there are two sides to most ques
tions. The Pajamarino was a collection of un
fortunate circumstances. The theater managers
guessed wrong when they thought they could
intimidate the frosh with a cordon of cops. The
cops guessed wrong in thinking they could
Lully the frosh. I guessed wrong in thinking
fiat students could do any more than make a
weak gesture towards boycotting the theaters,
: i thinking that I could tie-in a perfectly logical
move to lower prices to mass consumers, with
a punitive expedition. This last week-end has
plainly shown the bankruptcy of any such at
tempt.
Even if this campaign had been successful,
even if you can credit The Daily with showing
the students the rational basis for abandoning
the Mud Fight, even if the idea for the Nitery,
thrown out, innocently enough, in The Daily
edit column reaches fruition, what have we
aone but play about the periphery of real
issues?
The important thing is not that the golf course
charges high green fees because it cannot pay
its debt. The important thing is that when the
golf course was constructed, Stanford would
i.ave nothing but the best. The result is that we
] ave one of the best golf courses on the Coast,
1 ut one which only the prosperous students can
«• fford to play on.
When we build our Union Cellar, we build
one with only the best of furnishings, but ac
cording to the last report, even with high prices,
v/e can't make money on it.
Our Bookstore, on the other hand, made
money hand over fist on its fancy book ends,
and tariff for revenue-only official jewelry. But

the last illusion that it was run as a student co
opertaive, whose function is to furnish goods
to student consumers at the lowest possible
price, vanished last year with the turning over
of its profits to the Student Aid Fund, albeit a
worthy charity.
The Corp yard, which used to be in a sense
a co-operative by furnishing gasoline and hard
ware at cut rates to faculty members, no longer
will do business on that basis, while around the
corner, a privately owned enterprise pays rent
for the privilege of selling gasoline.
Everyone admits our New Theater will be
very nice and the best in the West, but it does
not have the undergraduate talent or support at
present to warrant its $500,000 construction, and
no one seems to be making any effort to estab
lish either a graduate or undergraduate school
of dramatics. And, in the light of the Hollywood
trend, does anyone know whether such a school
on the West Coast would have a purpose or an
ability to fulfill a purpose? Meanwhile, stu
dents are paying at least two dollars (discount
ing the mysterious fiction of the Union dollar)
a guarter for its erection, without any assur
ance that the money they are spending will be
of greater service there than in something that
would react more directly on student welfare.
We seem to be erecting beautiful buildings,
all of which is laudable. But is our library ade
guately stocked with books? Are the beautiful
buildings sometimes built and managed more
for their beauty or for the sake of managing than
for their utility to students?
Getting away from buildings, our faculty
members give exes, mid-terms, finals. The blue
books come in. They are marked. The results
go down to the registrar's office. Graphs are
made out showing ratios and correlations. But
does anybody know if students are getting an
education? Statistics seem to show that stu
dents are studying more, the grade points seem
to show they're learning less.
Anyone who sees the college student at work
and at play knows that grades are indicators of
forced learning. The grade system has replaced
the incentive to study, to learn, to know. Grades
have become a substitute for knowledge, be
cause there is fear in the hearts of the adminis
trators that if grades are removed, students
would realize that the stuff they have been cram
ming has no point and no meaning for them,
that they are only going through the motions,
because they can't find a job at the age of 17,
and an A.B. and the polishing effect of the
Stanford milieu is good for the development of
"a well-rounded personality."
Has The Daily done anything about these?
No.

Everyone admits our New Theater will be
very nice and the best in the West, but it does
not have the undergraduate talent or support at
present to warrant its $500,000 construction, and
no one seems to be making any effort to estab
lish either a graduate or undergraduate school
of dramatics. And, in the light of the Hollywood
trend, does anyone know whether such a school
on the West Coast would have a purpose or an
ability to fulfill a purpose? Meanwhile, stu
dents are paying at least two dollars (discount
ing the mysterious fiction of the Union dollar)
a guarter for its erection, without any assur
ance that the money they are spending will be
of greater service there than in something that
would react more directly on student welfare.
We seem to be erecting beautiful buildings,
all of which is laudable. But is our library ade
guately stocked with books? Are the beautiful
buildings sometimes built and managed more
for their beauty or for the sake of managing than
for their utility to students?
Getting away from buildings, our faculty
members give exes, mid-terms, finals. The blue
books come in. They are marked. The results
go down to the registrar's office. Graphs are
made out showing ratios and correlations. But
does anybody know if students are getting an
education? Statistics seem to show that stu
dents are studying more, the grade points seem
to show they're learning less.
Anyone who sees the college student at work
and at play knows that grades are indicators of
forced learning. The grade system has replaced
the incentive to study, to learn, to know. Grades
have become a substitute for knowledge, be
cause there is fear in the hearts of the adminis
trators that if grades are removed, students
would realize that the stuff they have been cram
ming has no point and no meaning for them,
that they are only going through the motions,
because they can't find a job at the age of 17,
and an A.B. and the polishing effect of the
Stanford milieu is good for the development of
"a well-rounded personality."

Got a chance to sleep over the week-end.
Got a chance to relax. Got a chance to think
about things. For the last couple of days, I've
been hearing again among the students what
I hadn't heard for quite a while. It may be that
I hadn't been among the students enough to
hear it, but it also may be that the honeymoon
is over. What I've been hearing is that same old
cry: "What's the matter with The Daily?" So I
boned up on back files of The Daily, and pre
pared to take my mid-term.
I. Why doesn't my story get in the paper?
This comes under the classification of the
usual gripe. Ever since I've been on the sheet,
I've heard organization managers come scream
ing in, because their notice seemingly was
crowded out of the paper by such things as
"Deciduous trees can be transplanted after their
leaves turn color," even after they had person
ally drilled into the head of the night editor the
importance of their story.
Slips such as this come under the head of
interdepartmental stupidity. Personal drilling
into the head of the night editor may result only
in a faint buzzing sound in the heads of the
copy editor, copy reader, proof reader, lino
typer, and make-up man. Sole remedy seems
to be the development of high personal effi
ciency on the part of each cog in the machine.

11. What's the matter with campus coverage?
This quarter's paper has been so busy piping
the flight of the unusual that it hasn't settled
clown to covering the important, but routine
stuff. What's really going on in the depart
ments? What are the changes being made by
administrators to keep up with the larger stu
dent body? What attempts are being made
io keep up with the larger student body? What
attempts are being made to improve Stanford
education? How about the new buildings? Why
is Ex Committee interested in dance chaper
ones? What is the cold dope on Reg Dance
profits?
Of course, I can answer that The Daily has
never adequately covered these, that we are
so used to having people drilling in our heads,
that we can't climb out of the rut of canned
copy journalism. That is no reason, though,
why we shouldn't.
111. What has been done that is editorially con

Right now, I am having a slight hang-over
ill the matter of the theater boycott. I've been
around here long enough to know that it is
impossible to organize this student body for a
boycott. I've also been around long enough to
know that there are two sides to most ques
tions. The Pajamarino was a collection of un
fortunate circumstances. The theater managers
guessed wrong when they thought they could
intimidate the frosh with a cordon of cops. The
cops guessed wrong in thinking they could
Lully the frosh. I guessed wrong in thinking
fiat students could do any more than make a
weak gesture towards boycotting the theaters,
: i thinking that I could tie-in a perfectly logical
move to lower prices to mass consumers, with
a punitive expedition. This last week-end has
plainly shown the bankruptcy of any such at
tempt.
Even if this campaign had been successful,
even if you can credit The Daily with showing
the students the rational basis for abandoning
the Mud Fight, even if the idea for the Nitery,
thrown out, innocently enough, in The Daily
edit column reaches fruition, what have we
aone but play about the periphery of real
issues?

The important thing is not that the golf course
charges high green fees because it cannot pay
its debt. The important thing is that when the
golf course was constructed, Stanford would

When we build our Union Cellar, we build

Our Bookstore, on the other hand, made

and tariff for revenue-only official jewelry. But

The Corp yard, which used to be in a sense

Everyone admits our New Theater will be
very nice and the best in the West, but it does
not have the undergraduate talent or support at
present to warrant its $500,000 construction, and
no one seems to be making any effort to estab

of dramatics. And, in the light of the Hollywood
trend, does anyone know whether such a school
on the West Coast would have a purpose or an
ability to fulfill a purpose? Meanwhile, stu
dents are paying at least two dollars (discount
ing the mysterious fiction of the Union dollar)
a guarter for its erection, without any assur
ance that the money they are spending will be
of greater service there than in something that
would react more directly on student welfare.
We seem to be erecting beautiful buildings,
all of which is laudable. But is our library ade

buildings sometimes built and managed more
for their beauty or for the sake of managing than
for their utility to students?
Getting away from buildings, our faculty
members give exes, mid-terms, finals. The blue
books come in. They are marked. The results
go down to the registrar's office. Graphs are
made out showing ratios and correlations. But
does anybody know if students are getting an
education? Statistics seem to show that stu
dents are studying more, the grade points seem
to show they're learning less.
Anyone who sees the college student at work
and at play knows that grades are indicators of
forced learning. The grade system has replaced
the incentive to study, to learn, to know. Grades
have become a substitute for knowledge, be
cause there is fear in the hearts of the adminis
trators that if grades are removed, students
would realize that the stuff they have been cram
ming has no point and no meaning for them,
that they are only going through the motions,
because they can't find a job at the age of 17,
and an A.B. and the polishing effect of the
Stanford milieu is good for the development of
"a well-rounded personality."

Got a chance to sleep over the week-end.
Got a chance to relax. Got a chance to think

been hearing again among the students what
I hadn't heard for quite a while. It may be that
I hadn't been among the students enough to
hear it, but it also may be that the honeymoon
is over. What I've been hearing is that same old

boned up on back files of The Daily, and pre

This comes under the classification of the
usual gripe. Ever since I've been on the sheet,
I've heard organization managers come scream

crowded out of the paper by such things as
"Deciduous trees can be transplanted after their
leaves turn color," even after they had person
ally drilled into the head of the night editor the
importance of their story.
Slips such as this come under the head of
interdepartmental stupidity. Personal drilling
into the head of the night editor may result only
in a faint buzzing sound in the heads of the
copy editor, copy reader, proof reader, lino

to be the development of high personal effi

stuff. What's really going on in the depart

administrators to keep up with the larger stu

io keep up with the larger student body? What
attempts are being made to improve Stanford
education? How about the new buildings? Why

ones? What is the cold dope on Reg Dance
profits?
Of course, I can answer that The Daily has

copy journalism. That is no reason, though,

boned up on back files of The Daily, and pre
pared to take my mid-term.
I. Why doesn't my story get in the paper?
This comes under the classification of the
usual gripe. Ever since I've been on the sheet,
I've heard organization managers come scream
ing in, because their notice seemingly was
crowded out of the paper by such things as
"Deciduous trees can be transplanted after their
leaves turn color," even after they had person
ally drilled into the head of the night editor the
importance of their story.
Slips such as this come under the head of
interdepartmental stupidity. Personal drilling
into the head of the night editor may result only
in a faint buzzing sound in the heads of the
copy editor, copy reader, proof reader, lino
typer, and make-up man. Sole remedy seems
to be the development of high personal effi
ciency on the part of each cog in the machine.
Has this volume of The Daily done this? No.
11. What's the matter with campus coverage?
This quarter's paper has been so busy piping
the flight of the unusual that it hasn't settled
clown to covering the important, but routine
stuff. What's really going on in the depart
ments? What are the changes being made by
administrators to keep up with the larger stu
dent body? What attempts are being made
io keep up with the larger student body? What
attempts are being made to improve Stanford
education? How about the new buildings? Why
is Ex Committee interested in dance chaper
ones? What is the cold dope on Reg Dance
profits?
Of course, I can answer that The Daily has
never adequately covered these, that we are
so used to having people drilling in our heads,
that we can't climb out of the rut of canned
copy journalism. That is no reason, though,
why we shouldn't.
111. What has been done that is editorially con
structive?
Right now, I am having a slight hang-over
ill the matter of the theater boycott. I've been
around here long enough to know that it is
impossible to organize this student body for a
boycott. I've also been around long enough to
know that there are two sides to most ques
tions. The Pajamarino was a collection of un
fortunate circumstances. The theater managers
guessed wrong when they thought they could
intimidate the frosh with a cordon of cops. The
cops guessed wrong in thinking they could
Lully the frosh. I guessed wrong in thinking
fiat students could do any more than make a
weak gesture towards boycotting the theaters,
: i thinking that I could tie-in a perfectly logical
move to lower prices to mass consumers, with
a punitive expedition. This last week-end has
plainly shown the bankruptcy of any such at
tempt.
Even if this campaign had been successful,
even if you can credit The Daily with showing
the students the rational basis for abandoning
the Mud Fight, even if the idea for the Nitery,
thrown out, innocently enough, in The Daily
edit column reaches fruition, what have we
aone but play about the periphery of real
issues?
The important thing is not that the golf course
charges high green fees because it cannot pay
its debt. The important thing is that when the
golf course was constructed, Stanford would
i.ave nothing but the best. The result is that we
] ave one of the best golf courses on the Coast,
1 ut one which only the prosperous students can
«• fford to play on.
When we build our Union Cellar, we build
one with only the best of furnishings, but ac
cording to the last report, even with high prices,
v/e can't make money on it.
Our Bookstore, on the other hand, made
money hand over fist on its fancy book ends,
and tariff for revenue-only official jewelry. But

the last illusion that it was run as a student co
opertaive, whose function is to furnish goods
to student consumers at the lowest possible
price, vanished last year with the turning over
of its profits to the Student Aid Fund, albeit a
worthy charity.
The Corp yard, which used to be in a sense
a co-operative by furnishing gasoline and hard
ware at cut rates to faculty members, no longer
will do business on that basis, while around the
corner, a privately owned enterprise pays rent
for the privilege of selling gasoline.
Everyone admits our New Theater will be
very nice and the best in the West, but it does
not have the undergraduate talent or support at
present to warrant its $500,000 construction, and
no one seems to be making any effort to estab
lish either a graduate or undergraduate school
of dramatics. And, in the light of the Hollywood
trend, does anyone know whether such a school
on the West Coast would have a purpose or an
ability to fulfill a purpose? Meanwhile, stu
dents are paying at least two dollars (discount
ing the mysterious fiction of the Union dollar)
a guarter for its erection, without any assur
ance that the money they are spending will be
of greater service there than in something that
would react more directly on student welfare.
We seem to be erecting beautiful buildings,
all of which is laudable. But is our library ade
guately stocked with books? Are the beautiful
buildings sometimes built and managed more
for their beauty or for the sake of managing than
for their utility to students?
Getting away from buildings, our faculty
members give exes, mid-terms, finals. The blue
books come in. They are marked. The results
go down to the registrar's office. Graphs are
made out showing ratios and correlations. But
does anybody know if students are getting an
education? Statistics seem to show that stu
dents are studying more, the grade points seem
to show they're learning less.
Anyone who sees the college student at work
and at play knows that grades are indicators of
forced learning. The grade system has replaced
the incentive to study, to learn, to know. Grades
have become a substitute for knowledge, be
cause there is fear in the hearts of the adminis
trators that if grades are removed, students
would realize that the stuff they have been cram
ming has no point and no meaning for them,
that they are only going through the motions,
because they can't find a job at the age of 17,
and an A.B. and the polishing effect of the
Stanford milieu is good for the development of
"a well-rounded personality."
Has The Daily done anything about these?
No.
Score: 15
Flunked.
Got a chance to sleep over the week-end.
Got a chance to relax. Got a chance to think
about things. For the last couple of days, I've
been hearing again among the students what
I hadn't heard for quite a while. It may be that
I hadn't been among the students enough to
hear it, but it also may be that the honeymoon
is over. What I've been hearing is that same old
cry: "What's the matter with The Daily?" So I
boned up on back files of The Daily, and pre
pared to take my mid-term.
