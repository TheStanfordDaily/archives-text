OKAY, POP
With Mr. Hamilton's assurance that the election is
over, business can settle down to showing profits and
being ground under the heel of a paternalistic federal
dictatorship.
For even now, the last of the die-hards' lost causes,
"Rugged Individualism" is shaking celestial,hands in
Liberty's Valhalla.

Dear old R.1., how we shall miss him. He was the
glorious last of a line that began with Slates Rights
and saw its golden age in the fights against anti-trust,
pure food, and free trade legislation. .
And now he's gone with Kansas. The Republicans
might in all reverence publish a memorial pamphlet
dedicated to his spirit, and to righteous-obstructionism
with-a-profit-motive—his guiding star.

The compilers of such a testimonial need not go far
for source material. The very men who struggled so
patriotically against the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and public utility regulation are still alive. In
deed, their memories span the years of battle from sen
ate floor and "back room" to the cries of "bloody,
bloody" against F.D.R.
Their account would go far to show Ihat the same
arguments were used every time our fair-weather
democracy hit an economic sou'wester—and every
time the first mate cried "reef sail "

The words, only, differed from storm to storm. This
time, the cry was "Dictatorship." And in support of it,
the fighters attempted to show that what the govern
ment was doing would lead to Fascism. They might as
easily have used the same cry against America's earlier
attempts to intelligently control and unintelligent econ
omy. For there is only a fine line between mandatory
placement of railroad fares and mandatory regulation
of a cotton crop "for the public good." If "Fascism"
had been in their political vocabularies, the old-timers
who fought tho I.C.C. would certainly have used it even
as the anti-A.A.A. agitators use it now.

Let us all l>e frank, for there is no longer reason for
even the Republicans to evade the issue. With Roose
velt, we arc exchanging individual control of produc
tion for more-or-less collective control. We are ex
changing the hit-and-miss system that led to enormous
profits and enormous losses, for a working philosophy
that places sober prosperity above the elation of a
drunken brawl.
That we are also exchanging short-run and super
ficial industrial efficiency for like inefficiency is an
admission the Democrats must make. But such ineffi
ciency is not because of the Roosevelt way, but In
spite of it. To anyone who will permit himself to see
it, Roosevelt proposes expert allocation of productive
factors, and expert control of them.
And if the average business man thinks he's an
expert, let him look at his checking balance as of
November I, 1929.
