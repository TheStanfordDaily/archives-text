A well chosen cast ... a cred
itable performance.
These were some of the comments
of the large audience which wit
nessed "ROADSIDE," Dramatic
Council's first production of the year,
on Friday night.
The initial effort of Director Gor
don C. Lange showed evidence of
careful preparation and thoughtfyl
direction. An extremely difficult
piece to produce, this backwoods
drama presented not only characters
speaking in an unusual dialect, but
the very spirit of a play foreign
to most of the audience.
Director and cast overcame both of
these obstacles ably. The dialect
sounded easy and natural, and fur
thermore was intelligible. The lovely
outdoor setting of the scene by the
roadside helped materially to convey
the earthy spirit of the piece across
the footlights.
Outstanding was Gcraldine Schrei
ber as "Hannie Rader," seemingly
simple plainswoman who was sharp
tongued and wily enough when it
came to getting what she wanted.
Miss Schreiber's spirited perform
ance did much to speed up a slow
moving first act, and the only criti
cism that could be levied against her
was that at times she tended to
mouth her words.
Another good portrayal was that
of Richard McCarty as "Judge Snod
grass." Appearing but once in the
play, McCarty made his bit part so
eccentrically amusing that it elicited
a spontaneous round of applause.
Equally delightful were the "Red
Ike" and "Black Ike" of Phil Brown
and Ed Kerr. As the addle-pated
farm hands, these two got a great
deal of fun out of parts that might
have been overdone.
George Campbell, though he gave
a competent performance as the ob
noxious "Buzzy Hale," committed
the error of making his character too
obnoxious. It is difficult to believe
that an attractive woman like "Han
nie" could possibly marry such a
cringing old fool as 'Campbell made
"Buzzy" out to be. If he had been
either less cringing or less old the
plot would have seemed more plaus
ible.
Jim Corner, in the role of "Texas,"
and Julius Hooven, taking the part of
"Pap -Rader," did well as the suitor
and father of "Hannie." Corner, as
the man who tore up a courtroom
and demolished a jail, might have
shown a little more bluster, but per
haps he was wise in not allowing this
aspect of his character over-shadow
the mystical, other-worldly side of
his nature.
Jack Beatty, as the "Town Mar
shall," Howard Roberts as the snive
ling, cowardly "Neb," and Janet
Dole, in the role of "Mrs. Foster,"
also gave well rounded, creditable
portrayals.
A financial as well as an artistic
success, "Roadside" demonstrates
that a new theater is not the only
drawing card necessary to put over
a campus production. Lowered
prices and good direction of a none
too popular play did much toward
filling up the old Assembly Hall.
