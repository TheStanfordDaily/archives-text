# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOUDON FUNNIER YET 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We Republicans have been beaten
in the last two elections. We do not
admit defeat and never shall. As
far as the Republicans are con
cerned, this country will never be
come a one-party government.
Future generations may wish that
their granddaddies had used their
heads instead of being swayed by
showmanship and having sold their
vote for a temporary dole.
Someone will have to pay the pres
ent debt run up by this administra
tion, and I see no reason why the
present adult group is in favor of
placing such a great handicap on our
future and that of our children.
They say they are trying to secure
our future. Well, they will never do
it by throwing us into a bottomless
pit filled with government debts.
Howard Loudon
P.S.: Orange County went straight
Republican and that Democratic
weekly paper went to the wall for
lack of support.
