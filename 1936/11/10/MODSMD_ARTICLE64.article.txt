# DISTRIBUTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Being avid readers (when we can
get it) of the Stanford Daily, we
wish to propose a reform in the
method of said sheet.
Whereas many students approach
the campus from Palm Drive, and
also because many have classes
which do not bring them near the
bookstore, we propo.se that a stack
of the papers be placed on the Eng
lish Corner and on the so-called
Psychology Corner.
This, we believe, would facilitate
distribution greatly, not to mention
the time and steps that would be
saved by many of the students.
Trusting to your sagacity to ful
fill a pressing need, we remain,
Yours hopefully,
J. P. and J.H.
