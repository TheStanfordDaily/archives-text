# FELL BY ROADSIDE

The Editor, Sir:
Nothing could better serve to bear
out the truth of Mr. Eisenbach's
whimsical statement that "Stanford
plays should be neither seen nor

heard," than that so-called "Well
seasoned story of roadside squat
ters," which was performed Friday
last.
The writers were unable, after
careful consideration, to find any
justification for this remarkable
piece of work, unless it was a de
liberate attempt by the powers that
be to completely rid the house of
any audience whatsoever.
Let not the above be construed as
a disparaging criticism of the cast in
volved in this unmitigated fiasco; all
credit to those hardy sou's who
struggled valiantly with such inane
hodgepodge. Rather, permit us to
advance this question Where do the
dramatics authorities manage to find
such preposterous atrocities as plays
of this type?
If works of this calibre constitute
art, as Mr. Eisenbach seems to think,
we humbly beg to be excused, so
that we may resume cutting out our
paper dolls.
