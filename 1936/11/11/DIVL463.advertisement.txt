Arrow unveils its newest dress shirt.
We might call it dual control—Arrow's new
well-behaved dress shirt which promises
never to bulge out at the sides, dig into you
when you bend over, or ride up when you
sit down. Archer design—back curved in
and tails cupped to fit. It's the Lido—§3.
Observe the fwo ingenious suspender loops and frouser
tab to hold bosom In place—(adjustable tor swing music)!
Other Arrow Dress Shiris $2.50 and more.
Sanforized Shrunk. ... A new shirt it one ever shrinks.
