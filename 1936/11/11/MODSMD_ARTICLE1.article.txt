## Student Aid Contribution To Continue; Customers To Get Surplus 
### JIM FULLERTOWN 
After looking into their own
books, the directors of the Stanford
Bookstore are inclined to look kind
ly upon the outstretched palm of
Stanford students.
At least according to an announce
ment released yesterday by the
Board of Directors, the profits made
in the first two months of sales in
dicate the possibility of renewing
the rejected policy of paying rebates
to customers.
Directors to Decide
Although last year's student body
voted that the Bookstore profits be
turned over to the funds of the
Commission for- Student Aid, the
directors believe that a reasonable
rebate may be paid to the customers,
besides making a further contribu
tion to this fund.
At this time, they explain that no
definite promises can be made, but
the prospect of the students getting
a portion of their money back is so
bright that beginning November 15,
sales slips will again be collected.
In the event that this year's business
justifies, the information will then
be available on which to base a
just payment.
As in previous practice, no slips
for purchases of less than fifty cents
will be taken in.
