# Roth Grants Grading Contracts for New Farm Amphitheater
## Work Will Be Complete in Sixty Days To Permit Planting of Trees, Shrubs In Time for Early Spring Growth 
### JIM HURST 
Excavating and grading to complete the bowl-shaped earthwork of
Stanford's new amphitheater will be started at once. Comptroller Almon E.
Roth announced yesterday, and completed within f>o days, in time for the
spring planting season.
This announcement marks the first definite plan to complete the major
work of the amphitheater.
The possibility that trees and shrubs to he planted around the rim of
the earth structure might lose a year of growth if the grading were not

'completed by January, in time for
planting, made it imperative that Mr.
Roth find some way to supply the
necessary dirt for the structure.
Contracts I^et
Yesterday contracts were let to
have about 36,000 cubic yards of
earth excavated from the .stage end
of the amphitheater site (which is
the end near the Memorial Theater)
and piled into a uniform oval-.shaped
hill which will form the rim of the
bowl.
The lowest point within the am
phitheater, just in front of the stage,
will be about 18 feet below present
ground level, and the seating area
will slope gradually up toward the
rear until it Ls only slightly below
the surrounding rim.
The amphitheater will thus be
similar in general form to the foot
ball stadium, partly above and partly
below ground level. Originally Mr.
Roth had hoped to get enough free
dirt from the Embarcadero subway
in Palo Alto and the foundation ex
cavations of the proposed Cubber
ley education building to build up
the rmphit heater entirely above
ground level and save cost of exca
vation. But the education building
hasn't been started, and the other
source proved insufficient.
Will Plant Trees
Trees indigenous to this region—
oaks, laurels, madrones, maples—
will be planted around the periphery
of the bowl and part way down the
slopes, and among them will be set
native shrubs.
According to the present pian
movable opera chairs will be used
in the seating area, which will con
sist of a series of grass-covered ter
races. The stage will be a large
terrace covered with grass and
backed by rows of tall trees to ex
clude view of the Memorial Theater
behind.
