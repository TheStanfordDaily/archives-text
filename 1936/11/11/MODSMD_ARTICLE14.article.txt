At Work Sincc 1868
The Red Cross was organized in
the United States in 1881 by Clara
Barton, but the idea was conceived
on the battlefield of Solerino in 1859
by Henri Dunant, a member of the
neutral party. For several years he
struggled to get backing for his plan,
and finally, in 1863, a council met in
Geneva to discuss the plans on a
broader scale.
By 1868, 33 countries had organ
ized Red Cross societies, with an
international head at Geneva. Sincc
then, the Red Cross has been carry
ing out its great emergency work in
all corners of the world.
