# Bay Bridge Fulfills Founders Dream
## 
### 
When rich, university - founding
Leland Stanford talked in the early
60's of a bridge to span the San Fran
cisco Bay, wiseacres of the day said
â™¦ he man was visionary, impractical.
Tomorrow when President Roosevelt
presses the telegraphic key in Wash
ington to open formally the San
Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge,
idealistic Leland Stanford's visions
will have been realized.
For three years and four months,
commuters have watched the phe
nomenal growth of the bay span.
Huge pilings were front page news
when they first rose above the water;
all remember Ihe cable-spinning
episode; everyone of the 24 men who
died during the construction made
newspaper copy.
Year Early
A natural barrier was conquered a
year ahead of schedule, costing
$77,200,000 The people will pay for
it. keep jt.
In the three-day celebration Unt ie
. Sam's aircraft carriers Saratoga,

Lexington, Ranger and 100 planes
will be on hand to play lights on the
bridge. San Francisco night spots
will remain open until 4 in the
morning, and there will be speed
and sail-boat racing in a gigantic
effort to mark this period as "the
most significant in California his
tory."
Of significance to Stanford. Ihe
bridge will facilitate visits to Mills,
passage to the University of Califor- ;
ilia. Over 25,000 cars were estimated j
to have come down to the Farm for
last year's Big Game, and the same
number are expected to cross the bay
from outside San Francisco to Ber
keley November 21.
Affects Bay Region
The bay region is the only district
directly affected by the faster trans
portation, although the peninsula
will have to provide a better system
of roads to carry Ihe traffic, figures
show.
Civic leaders declare that no ferry
fares will be curtailed by the faster

traffic of the bridge, that, beyond the
65-cent toll exacted to liquidate the
$77,200,000 cost of the structure there
will be little change in revenue ei
ther way. First visible affect on real
estate is a transit company's buying
of an entire block in Emeryville to be
used as a bus terminal.
The span combines an unprece
dented engineering feat in combining
a cantilever structure and two sus
pension bridges built in tandem and
is eight and one-half miles long. It
will be open to trains next year.
Epic Parade
Along with the airplanes ard car
riers on the program - extravaganza
will be a mammoth daytime parade
up Market Street featuring a hun
dred elaborate floats which trace the
history of bridges from the first ring
tailed monkey Ret-together to Cae
sar's constructions in Gaul to modern
wonders. A plan is being carried out
to cast half-dollars with a likeness
of the bridge and have them distrib
uted through the banks.
