A proposal that Stanford rooters
sit on the sunny side of the sta
'dium in next year's football games
was submitted by McDaniel, who
pointed out that the stunt cards
showed better in the sun, and also
stated that it would be a courteous
move on Stanford's part to give their
opponents the shady side of the
stadium.
