# Ex Committee Moves Nitery To Golf Clubhouse Friday, Starts Six-Day Experiment
## Plans To Build Boathouse Night Spot, Redecorate Union Lobby Discussed; Comptroller Roth Advises Caution 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Kx Committee last night moved the Nitery, still in the experimental
stage, from the A.S.S.U. lobby up to the golf clubhouse for a six-day tryout
period—Friday night through Thursday, except Sunday—under the con
tinued direction of Cardinals.
Though nothing definite was determined about the Nitery besides the
golf clubhouse experiment, plans for a permanent campus night spot took

two decided turns—toward redecora
ting the A.S.S.U. lobby into a social
room, and toward building a combi
nation night club and boathouse on
the east bank of Lake Lagunita.
Roth Expresses Doubt
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, who
attended last night's meeting as "Ad
ministration adviser," felt that "to
date there hasn't been enough stu
dent interest in a Nitery to build
one. It isn't going to be such a
bright rainbow when you catch up
with it." He believed that the cam
pus is in a "spasm of enthusiasm"
which will soon die out.
But Ex Committee, particularly
Esther Pelt on and Chick Franich, ar
gued that for several years the cam
pus has needed a permanent Nitery,
that a movement for on-campus en
tertainment has been pretty well
proven.
The comptroller explained that the
University's new dam at Searsville
will probably keep Lagunita filled
three-fourths of the year. "A combi
nation Nitery-boathouse in such a
case would be your best bet," he ad
vised.
Lobby Renovation Asked
The Committee, finally, passed Bob
Mallett's motion that the Union
Board of Governors be asked to
move organization offices from the
A.S.S.U. lobby to the Union's third
floor, that the lobby be renovated for
use as a permanent "social room."
Cost of a Nitery-boathouse on La
gunita — the present boathouse will
need renewing soon anyway — will be
determined definitely this week
when Henry Hughes, student archi
tect, will get estimates on a build
ing to handle 50 or 100 couples at a
time.
Fontius vs. Jorgensen
At the same two-hour session,
longest and stormiest yet this quar
ter, discussion turned virtually into
a two-man debate between Student
Manager Chuck Fontius and Daily
Editor Irvin Jorgensen over Fon
tius' proposed scheme to put the
Daily's editorial budget under the
thumb of a directing committee.
After 25 minutes of cross-fire talk
in which the main points of each ar
gument were largely obscured by
argumentative detail, President Jim
Reynolds discovered that two com -
mitteemen had left the meeting, that
there weren't enough present to vote
upon the measure anyway.
PROMOTION OF GAIETIES
songs: Mallett reported that chances
were slim that Gaieties songs would
"go over with name orchestras" if
they were exploited only by sending
out printed copies over the country.
They will be played over the air
anyway by San Francisco orchestras
if Phil Bernhcim's plans are success
ful. Ex Committee withheld Ibe re
quested $30 until after the Gaieties,
until the committeemen can hear the
songs themselves.
DANCES: Two dances were ap
proved for the day before Big Game
— a jolly-up from 3 until 6 o'clock,
probably with Eddie Fitzpatrick's or
chestra, and an A.S.S.U. dance after
the Gaieties.
DATE GRANTED: Encina Club
Informal, December 4; Theta Sigma
Phi's request for winter quarter reg
! dance was deferred until next Tues
day.
