# Court Asked If Chiseling Pays
## Moot Tribunal Decides Third Case Tonight 
### 
Whether or not a tombstone carver
can sue for his wages if he leaves a
half-finished contracted job to run
off and join a carnivalâ€”this will be
decided tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the
Law Building, in the third session of
the Moot Court of the Stanford Law
School.
If last night's session be taken as a
criterion, a lively exchange of persi
flage can be expected tonight. Ap
pellants Syd DeGoff and Burt Gold
stein and Respondents Relphine
Meyer and Katherine Meagher kept
an audience of 50 to 60 people in
constant laughter.
All sessions of the moot court are
open to everyone who is interested
and are held in Room 12 of the Law
Building. Technical points involved
in the cases do not render them un
intelligible to the general campus,
since the almost frivolous questions
involved are far,|rom the staid situ
ations usually associated with the
court room.
