HURRAY I OK Ol'R SIDE ,
With Armistice Day at hand and
with a thousand impassioned orators
quoting old General Sherman to the
effect that war is hell, we should
pause for a moment of silenec and
note the passing of our late friend,
the Vetex-ans of Future Wars.
Funny ,in a way, how the organi
zation should have boomed so tre
mendously and then have slipped
into the limbo so quickly, although
every American who has watched
the rise and fall of mah jong, the
Charleston, miniature golf, yo-yos,
backgammon, eskimo pies, and
handies should realize by now that
the bigger they are the harder they
fall.

Somehow, I can't cry over the loss
of the Veterans of Future Wars. For
i while it was great stuff, and the
vay the Veterans of Foreign Wars
, :nd American Legion got huffy
. bout it all shows that the Future
War boys were really hurting those
1 wo fine organizations which are de
\ oted to the cause of grabbing the
1 onus and stuffing Americanism up
everybody's nose.
But after a while, the Veterans of
Future Wars seemed to get just like
ti.e organizations it was supposed to
n imick. All the bureaucrats, big
I) jy.s and girls on campus who pride
themselves in doing the right thing
a! the right time, joined up because
i! was the cute thing to do. The meet
i: ; became really a conclave of the
el ;iuvinists.
And from the tremendous blow the
V« '.erans of Future Wars put up. it
1 o ;ks suspiciously as though the
w .ale peace movement on the part
of modern youth is just a big wind,
i I nobody really believes in peace
iu all. After all, everybody believes
i i God, but it seems that the devil
ha an easy time offering a better
proposition than God to us young
j.! >fligates who are just suckers for
Ihe easiest way.
' 'he easiest way for all of us now is
to put on the professional attitude of
1j ■:ng all for peace, but in time of
v •, the way of the conscientious
oVector is a tough one. The band
wt complex of the American peo
]j c may be slightly operative in
tin.es of national elections, but in
lime of war it is positively over
whelming.
J seems to me that I read some
where about Wilson being elected
for a second term to keep us out of
war, and yet when it was declared,
the whole country joined as bands
p'nyed, flags waved, the housetops
pi f claimed the honor of America and
the pulpit solemnly invoked the aid
el God in this sacred cause.
When war comes, and all the good
g,!ys join up, the man who remem
b s the tales of the gore of the last
w; r will be hard put to keep from
calling himself traitor. And before
long, he too will get in the swing of
thi igs and sign up for the glorious
ari enture, for who knows, there may
iv 'er be another war. After he gets
hi uniform he can go around to see
hi girl friend, and if she is the right
so t. of girl, she will gasp with de
li.'hi and tell him how strong and
bi ive he looks. And the guy will

think, gee it's great to be a soldier,
isn't it though?

Come a war ,and the colossal ad
vertising balloon of peace is going to
deflate with a most resounding and
heart-rending pfffff.
