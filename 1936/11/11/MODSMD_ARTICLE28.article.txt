# Code Offender Gets 125 Hours
## Men's Council Punishes Library Rule Violator 
### 
A student's misuse of library priv
ileges was the cause of an Honor
Code case brought before Men's
Council today at their weekly meet
ing in the Union. The student was
given 125 hours of work at the Con
valescent Home. Numerous com
plaints had been received from li
brary officials, and the decision was
made to serve as a warning to future
violations.
"The specific case ruled on con
cerned the taking out of books on
another student's name. Even
though the person had intended to
return the book, it is a serious vio
lation of the Honor Code," com
mented Aoy Anderson, chairman of
Men's Council. "The punishment
meted out not only included the
hours, but also a considerable fine
for keeping the books out over the
two-hour limit."
Library officials also have com
plained about such things as taking
books out of the reference room, de
facing books, and signing wrong
names to slips and cards. Men's
Council stated that even though
these violations may appear to be
accidental, they are violations of the
Honor Code, and will be dealt with
as such.
