# Coffis A.W.O.L.; Found Guilty By Court Martial
## 
### 
Jimmy Coffis, of football fame,
was found guilty by a military court
last Monday evening. The charge
was desertion â€” absence without
leave. The punishment, (JO days of
hard labor.
But Coach Tiny Thornhill and
"Jumping Jeemy's" friends need not
worry. The trial was only a mock
one to show R.O.T.C. students the
procedure of a court-martial. Cof
fis, whose only defense was that he
had a date with his girl, was the
victim of the demonstration.
