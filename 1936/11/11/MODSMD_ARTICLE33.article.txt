Brown Cannon, who began the
week only two strokes behind Wal

ahead of Harry Wiet, whose rounds
of 73 and 75 give him a total of 605.
Other leaders are Alan Hyman with
607 and Art Doering with 611.
Don Kennedy narrowed the mar
gin between himself and Bobby Roos
in their battle for the top spot on
the papoose ladder by shooting a 76,
three strokes less than the card turn
ed in by Roos, which leaves him with
458 as compared with 456 for Roos.
Following them are Bob Breyer with
476, Jack Showalter 487, and Dave
McHarg 488.
