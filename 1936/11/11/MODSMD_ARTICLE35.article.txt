### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 (U.R).—
Edward F. McGrady, Assistant Sec
retary §f Labor, conferred with un
ion leaders and representatives of
Pacific shipowners today in a series
of secret moves aimed at breaking
the shipping deadlock and releasing
179 ships now strikebound in Pa
cific harbors.
Still keeping his peace plan a se
cret, McGrady said he would con
tinue the preliminary meetings "un
til I've gone through the whole
list."
Attempt Dock Peace
The purpose of these preliminary
conferences, he said, was to iron out,
if possible, some of the issues on
which the shipowners and the seven
maritime and dock unions have been
deadlocked since last August.
"If we can get some of these issues
out of the way, we can get some
where," the Roosevelt administra
tion's ace labor conciliator said.
"I could have them resume nego
tiations any time but I think this
way more successful."
Confers with Plant
He said he .spent two hours con
ferring with Thomas G. Plant, rep
resentative for both the shipowners
and the waterfront employers in the
strike crisis.
He later arranged to see Harry
Bridges, the No. 1 man of the union
front in the strike; Harry Lunde
berg, secretary of the Sailors' Un
ion of the Pacific; Marvyn Rath
borne, head of the American Radio
Engineers; and J. E. Ferguson of
Telegraphists' Association; Ran
dolph Meriwether of the Marine
.the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Water
tenders and Wipers' Association, the
members of the so-called "black
gang" of the sea.
S.F. Peace Plan
McGrady explained his movements
in a formal statement which said:
I have been holding conferences
with the gentlemen on both sides
hoping to be able to clear away
some of the obstructions before an
other conference is called for the
purpose of further negotiations."
Peace appeared on another strike
front when leaders of the San Fran
cisco Warehousemen's Union, an af
filiate of Harry Bridges' Interna
tional Longshoremen's Association,
agreed to submit to a union referen
dum a peace plan which provides for
immediate return to work while
demands for increased wages are be
ing arbitrated.
The proposal will be submitted to
the union members, numbering
about 1800, on Friday.

In the United States the most snow
falls in February, the shortest month.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 (U.R).—
Edward F. McGrady, Assistant Sec
retary §f Labor, conferred with un
ion leaders and representatives of
Pacific shipowners today in a series
of secret moves aimed at breaking
the shipping deadlock and releasing
179 ships now strikebound in Pa
cific harbors.
Still keeping his peace plan a se
cret, McGrady said he would con
tinue the preliminary meetings "un
til I've gone through the whole
list."
Attempt Dock Peace
The purpose of these preliminary
conferences, he said, was to iron out,
if possible, some of the issues on
which the shipowners and the seven
maritime and dock unions have been
deadlocked since last August.
"If we can get some of these issues
out of the way, we can get some
where," the Roosevelt administra
tion's ace labor conciliator said.
"I could have them resume nego
tiations any time but I think this
way more successful."
Confers with Plant
He said he .spent two hours con
ferring with Thomas G. Plant, rep
resentative for both the shipowners
and the waterfront employers in the
strike crisis.
He later arranged to see Harry
Bridges, the No. 1 man of the union
front in the strike; Harry Lunde
berg, secretary of the Sailors' Un
ion of the Pacific; Marvyn Rath
borne, head of the American Radio
Engineers; and J. E. Ferguson of
Telegraphists' Association; Ran
dolph Meriwether of the Marine
.the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Water
tenders and Wipers' Association, the
members of the so-called "black
gang" of the sea.
S.F. Peace Plan

in a formal statement which said:
