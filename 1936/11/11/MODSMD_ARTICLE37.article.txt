# Watch O.S.C., Phelan Tells Card Eleven
## Hamilton Will Probably Play in Beaver Game; No Oregon Injuries 
### HERB DIAMOND 
"Stanford, watch out for Oregon
State!"
With such parting words as these,
Jimmy Pheian of Washington gath
ered his Huskies and left the Farm
last Saturday. Not that he is a man
to go around throwing scares into
people, but he does believe in ade
quate preparedness, and so does Tiny
Thornhill.
Tiny is well aware that Saturday's
fray in Portland will turn out to be
anything but a breather for the Red
skins. To begin with, the fact that
the Beavers' official Conference rec
ord now reads: "Won—l; lost—4"
means little, considering that it was
none other than the mighty Cougars
whom the Beavers so soundly drub
bed last week.
Beavers Tough for Huskies
Joe Gray, dubbed the "Gray
Ghost" of Oregon State, led his
teammates in giving even the Wash
ington Huskies a terrific battle
throughout the first two quarters. At
half-time the two squads had gained
no more than one tally apiece. It was
then Pheian began to see that his
men would have to win the tough
way, if they were to win at all.
He had to keep his first string
working at top speed for the rest of
the game to pull a victory out of the
fire and set it on ice, 19-7.
Yesterday came reports indicating
that no injuries would handicap the
Lon Stiner's men.
Cards in Shape
But neither will the Redshirts be
troubled with pains and aches, if
present indications are correct. Cab
Callaway was cavorting around the
practice field with his teammates
again yesterday afternoon, and he
should be in fine fettle before Sat
urday. Also, Tiny has disclosed the
fact that Glenn Hamilton, out since
early this season, will be in shape for
10 or 15 minutes against the Beavers.
Last night, after working against
Oregon State plays performed by
Harry Shipkey's l'rosh and Gray
son, Thornhill named the following
34 men for the Portland trip: Dick
Brigham, Jake Brigham, Callaway,
Calvelli, Campbell, Clark, Coffis,
Collins, Ferko, Gamier, Grant, Ham
ilton, Holdridge, Hoos, Kirsch, Luck
ett, Don McMillan.
Frank McMillan, Madlem, Mangan,
Matthews, Munger, Olcott, Rasmus
sen, Schott, Shannon, Stone, Sutton,
Tsoutsouvas, Vigna, West, Williams,
deWitt and Zagar.
