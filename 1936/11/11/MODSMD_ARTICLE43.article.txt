# Card Soccermen Take U.C.L.A. For 1-0 Victory
## Stanford's Offense Slows Down after Chalmers Scores for Early Lead 
### 
Stanford grabbed an early lead in ;
yesterday afternoon's soccer tilt with j
U.C.L.A. when George Chalmers,!
playing at inside left, booted in a J
short kick for the lone score which
proved to be all that was needed to 1
register a 1-0 victory.
Scarcely 5 minutes of the first half
had passed when the alert Cardinal
offense had worked the ball deep into
enemy territory where Chalmers
was able to poke home the winning
goal.
The rest of the game see-sawed
back and forth, although Stanford
constantly threatened to increase its
lead.
The Red team played nice ball
throughout, but the easy first goal
seemed to decrease the scoring
punch for the rest of the contest.
Captain Shepard, star of last yeai-'s
Stanford - U.C.L.A. game, was top
man again for a Bruin offense that
has had tough sledding the last
couple of days. Monday night the
Uclans saw the bad end of a 2-01
count against California and last
night a one-point defeat by Stanford.
The third of their bay loop engage
ments is this afternoon, with Uni
versity of San Francisco.
