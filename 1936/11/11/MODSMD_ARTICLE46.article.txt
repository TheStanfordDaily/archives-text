CHOOCH, SAY l
HELLO TO THE PEOPLE
This morning's lesson, my friends,
will be on Louis Tsoutsouvas.
Chooch is in the Class of '37,
meaning he is a senior, but up to this
year few people outside of the Kappa
Sig house had heard of him.
This is because for the last two
years he was playing behind Wes
Muller. Muller, as you remember, is
a very good pivot man. And when
Chooch wasn't playing back of Mul
ler, he was behind Alf Brandin. Alf,
too, was a very good pivot man, so
good, in , fact, that he often would
start in place of Muller.
To summarize, Chooch didn't play
any his first year, and got in so few
minutes last season that he began
to wonder.
Now, however ,he is raking back
payment in full for all of those
hours spent ofi the bench. In the
past five games — Washington State,
Oregon, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Wash
ington, he has played exactly 60 min
utes apiece. Against Sant& Clara,
Calvelli relieved him for maybe 10
minutes.
Calvelli, of course, is not a center
any more, and is seeing action, so the
boys who are taking the beating are
Dick Sutton, the second stringer, up
from last year's freshman pivot posi
tion, and Wally deWitt and Tony
Mecia, also of the Class of '39.
It hasn't been selfishness that
keeps Chooch in there so much. It's
simply that all of the games so far
have been tough, and that Chooch
has turned into a whale of a de
fensive fullback.
Offensively, it takes a genius to
handle the centering assignment on
Tiny's squad, principally in remem
bering when to pass. Any time the
boys run an "A-left, A-right, 10"
(like Joe Vigna called six straight
times in the fourth quarter against
U.C.L.A.), or something similar, they
fake a center pass on each shift. To
pass the ball at the wrong time dur
ing one of these would be, to say the
least, embarrassing.
Chooch, then, does pretty well by
the noggin work. He is far and away
the. Phi Bete of the team —where the
sports scribes went crazy over Bill
Corbus being slightly under a B in
Econ, Tsoutsouvas is 150 plus 171 in
pre-Med.
ANI) THE
FULLBACKS:
The fullback situation, drat it, is
not doing so bad!
Calvelli has shown great stuff al
ready — with little experience in the
berth he has done some running,
passing ,and kicking that would
make a lot of coaches want him.
And now Brigham has arrived.
Jake didn't have much of a pedigree
at the start of the year, and looked

weak in some After U.C.L.A.
and Washington, however, he has
come out with all kinds of Keeble
Pens, Hatlo Hats, and plaudits of the
ctowd; he can kick, pass, and run in
all kinds of competition.
Tiny says that Calvelli is largely j
lesponsible for Brigham's success, [
ard vice-versa. Tony sees Jake twist
and writhe through that line and
learns something. Jake, who never
shows anything in practice, sees
Tony drop back to wait until his re
ceivers are clear, and finds that he,
too, can wait longer.
To top it off. Glenn Hamilton, who .
was {.-head of both of them at the

I start of the? year, is going to play a j
quarter or two at Oregon State: Ham |
' caught a badly wrenched knee I
i against W.S.C., and hasn't played I
since, but they have taped him up 1
I and back into shape for action.
Paulman is keeping up to the ruin- j
) ute on the Thomhill system. He has •

come up from Oxnard to see every
game.
