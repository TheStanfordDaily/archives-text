Maybe not a Nightery, but at least new social
rooms in the Old Union, probably will be the
immediate result of Nightery agitation. Ex
Committee last night moved to the Union Board
of Governors to move Stevie and Aten, and
Dick Daughtery upstairs before Professor Bar
clay gets home. The resulting vacancy will be
the new social rooms.
Reversion of the Old Union to its original
purpose is a laudable thing, whether it will ever
fill the need for a campus watering place is
another matter.
Chick Franich suggests that the Old Union
spot is a difficult one in which to achieve a night

When we build a Nightery we want to build
one that will have a definite appeal to those
who have cars, and not make it a caste affair,
otherwise it will lose all its value. A Nightery
is to be for the whole student body, and not
only for the forgotten man.
It also must be a place where women can
have an incentive to come stag, it also must be
a place where men feel that it is good enough
to take a date. Otherwise we are building not
u Nightery but a jolly-up house.
