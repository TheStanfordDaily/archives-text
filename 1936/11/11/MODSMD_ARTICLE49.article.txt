U.C.L.A. students will get into the S.C. loot
ball game for nothing.
And the price ol the Berkeley game was cut
to 55 cents.
Those are both fine steps. They restore a lot
of student confidence in the values of compul
sory A.S.U.C. membership.
Men and women at Berkeley and at S.C. and
at Stanford and other coast schools pay any
where from SI. 10 to SI .65 for seats to most of
their spectacles.
Football is no longer the students' game. It
is like a bit of outside entertainment. Like a first
n'ght at a theatre in town but certainly not like
just another student sport student-supported.
Here, tho the S.C. game is not technically a
home game to which we are supposed to be
admitted free, A.S.U.C. heads have decided to
p ay for the students from the A.S.U.C. treasury.
That will help many who could not otherwise
a'ford the garnet.
Not that the A.S.U.C. heads are being mag
nanimous.
After all the A.S.U.C. treasury is the student
treasury. And if the students didn't want to
pay for anything they could arrange it that way.
But this feeling of not paying for the football
games is a nice one. It gives you the sensation
that here football is still a University sport.â€”
