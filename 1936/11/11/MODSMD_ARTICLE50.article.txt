It may or may not have been in response to
Daily criticism last quarter, but it seems that
Phi Phi, national men's fraternity "honorary"
society, has reformed to its very foundation.
In contrast to last year when three Zetes, two
Dekes, two Phi Delts, two Sigma Nu's, one Delt,
one D.U., and one Delta Chi were elected, and
in contrast to the year before that when three
Zetes, three Dekes, two Phi Delts, two Chi Psi's,
two Phi Psi's, one Beta, and one Sigma Nu were
elected, this fall we find that three Dekes, two
Phi Delts, two Delts, one Zete, one Beta, one
Kappa Sig, one D.U., and one Phi Psi were
elected. Apparently all the Zetes forgot to turn
up for election this time.
