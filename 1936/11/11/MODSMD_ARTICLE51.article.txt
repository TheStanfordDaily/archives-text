The Y.W.C.A. is slinging an international tea.
The A.S.U. is throwing (among other things)
Erwin Shaw's "Bury the Dead." Organized,
official Stanford is making a polite bow to
Armistice Day.
The American Legion, in its highly subjective
fashion, is throwing a "forget-me-not" drive,
.is if they ever did.

The tub-thumpers are inferring that the world
is forgetting the lessons of the last war and the
last Armistice, by sighting to the fact that maybe
the world isn't remembering the tub-thumpers.
The sorry thing is not, as Mr. Pendergast says
this morning, that the conscientious objectors
forget, it doesn't make much difference whether
they do or not, it doesn't make much difference
whether the munition-makers expect to make
profits, because they are powerful but they're
not omnipotent; it's something different. The
by-play of the munition - makers is only the
entr'acte, the poor memory of the conscientious
is only an end-product of a panorama of com
peting industrial machines locked horns in a
life-and-death struggle, and I don't think The
Daily will start a campaign on that subject this
morning.
