Washington, D.C.: LOST, STRAYED, or STO
LEN.
A number of persons, known vaguely as "Lib
erals," were formerly connected with a political
institution called the New Deal. These persons
possess no common characteristics by which
the general public might identify them other
than the ordinary manifestations sprung from the
belief that "things as they exist are not fair to
the average man, and something should be
done about the situation." Some of this missing
group might be identified by their possession
of books on economics, their abiiity to point out
the lowness of our standard of living compared
to what it ought to be, their knowledge of the
extent of unemployment, and their general in
formation on similar unpleasant facts and sta
tistics relevant to our national economy. A re
ward will not be offered by the Democratic
National Committee for their capture. Many of
them, though, lingered at tho capitol, hoping
that some truly liberal measures would be en
acted. Gradually they came to recognize that
such hopes were in vain. As they saw the Con
sumers Advisory Board turning into a power
less sop, General Johnson breaking the San
Francisco general strike, the Copeland Bill—to
protect food and drug consumers — being
shelved and then given over to the proprietary
associations, the appropriations for munitions
and armaments reaching a record - breaking
high, the great power trusts recently being as
sured that they would not be harmed, as they
saw these events and many others like them
transpiring before their eyes, the liberals sighed
in anguish, wiped away a dropping tear, then
"folded their tents like the Arabs, and silently
stole away."—John Blair
