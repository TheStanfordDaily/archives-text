## SPEAKING OF NITERIES 
### 
Typically, Stanford's brass hats arc screaming for a
socially-embroidered nitery. And God knows such an
institution is needed—certainly as much as the swell
golf clubhouse was needed for golfers. For it is a
bitter paradox that a Democratic Stanford hasn't a
Democratic dance hall.
Also needed, to benefit our minds as the "nitery"
would benefit our pocket-books, is a different soi't of
nitery—a dark and restful one for study.
The fact is that Stanford hasn't such a placc. And
the fact that Stanford students still pass exams is one
of the major wonders south of Daly City.

Honest-to-goodness study on the Farm is impossible
except for three places—the library, the library, and
the library.
We've heard that you can't study in a fraternity
house. We know only titans can Study in a dormitory.
And any freshman can tell you that you can't Study
in either Encina or the Quad for two reasons, noise
and temperature, respectively.
Nowhere can we hit the books in the witching hours
after 10:00, unless we're a boiler worker or Admiral
Byrd. And nowhere, the library included, is there a
well furnished, comfortable hall for that high-speed
browsing the night, before the morning after.

Speaking of nitcries. a Study Salon for use after all
decent people have gone to bed is certainly as im
portant as a Hop Hostel when all decent people are
still up.
It is one thing that would not be directly affected by
similar amusements in town or down Miller-way. It is
one thing that doesn't need the cautious approach, nor
would it be affected by the whims of style.
The University could make it pay simply by charg
ing a sort of scholastic flop-house fee, and piling on
enough work to make its use requisite to academic
survival.
In such a place it would be possible to smoke while
studying, but impossible to hear a radio. Hot brains
could be air-cooled. And there would be divans and
divans to rest on before, after ,and during.
