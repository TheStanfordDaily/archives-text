San Francisco Opera, 111, "GOET
TERDAMMERUNG
To keep an audience of several
thousand twitching humans alert,
silent for five hours as it follows the
rumblings of a symphony orchestra
and the accompanying movements of
a group of norns, gods, dwarfs, and
sea-maidens across the stage would
seem a difficult task. But it is not
too difficult for Richard Wagner.
The audience may go home for din
ner after the second act; it may even
enjoy an intermission after the third,
hut no applause, please, during the
performance. Quiet, please, for
"Goetterdammerung." The audience
was glad to abide by its composer's
rules Saturday night.
The lady behind me elucidated on
tne first scene: "It wasn't really
Gun ther who came through the wall
of fire, you see; it was Sigfried dis
guised as Gunther wearing the Tarn
helm after he had drunk the potion
. . ." But I gave up trying to re
member the plot details. I gave up
trying to identify the motives—"Hail
to Love," "Loge," "Siegfried,"
"Guardian of the Sword," and the
hundred other orchestral themes
that reinforce, foretell the legend.
It is the unbelievable richness, the
monumentality of the music itself
that makes "Goetterdammerung" and
the rest of the "Ring" great, Wag
ner's rich instrumentation, the the
matic inversions, variations, combi
nations by which he expresses death,
love, immortality.
Kirsten Flagstad was as glorious as
ever. I like her as Brunnhilde even
better than as Isolde, perhaps be
cause I saw her as Wotan's favorite
daughter first. Meisle's voice was
beautiful, as a draamtic actress, I
think, she surpasses Flagstad. Em
manuel List, with his black, bat-like
costume, his powerful bass, was a
sinister and terrifying Hagen.
The Norns of the prologue created
the atmosphex-e appropriate to the
representation of the Twilight of the
Gods. The Rhine maiden's song in
the last act is one of the loveliest
jjartions of the opera. Which is of
course not really opera, but sym
phonic drama.
7 meant to mention "Rigoletto"
and "Carmen," "Rigoletto" finest for
Lawrence Tibbett's singing in the
title role, 'Carmen" for Bruno Cas
tagna, and not for Ezio Pinza, who
as the toreador, displayed a lack of
vitality, and worse, flatted.

It is the unbelievable richness, the
monumentality of the music itself
that makes "Goetterdammerung" and
the rest of the "Ring" great, Wag
ner's rich instrumentation, the the
matic inversions, variations, combi
nations by which he expresses death,
love, immortality.
Kirsten Flagstad was as glorious as
ever. I like her as Brunnhilde even
better than as Isolde, perhaps be
cause I saw her as Wotan's favorite
daughter first. Meisle's voice was
beautiful, as a draamtic actress, I
think, she surpasses Flagstad. Em
manuel List, with his black, bat-like
costume, his powerful bass, was a
sinister and terrifying Hagen.
The Norns of the prologue created
the atmosphex-e appropriate to the
representation of the Twilight of the
Gods. The Rhine maiden's song in
the last act is one of the loveliest
jjartions of the opera. Which is of
course not really opera, but sym
phonic drama.
7 meant to mention "Rigoletto"
and "Carmen," "Rigoletto" finest for
Lawrence Tibbett's singing in the
title role, 'Carmen" for Bruno Cas
tagna, and not for Ezio Pinza, who
as the toreador, displayed a lack of
vitality, and worse, flatted.

TERDAMMERUNG
To keep an audience of several
thousand twitching humans alert,
silent for five hours as it follows the
rumblings of a symphony orchestra
and the accompanying movements of
a group of norns, gods, dwarfs, and
sea-maidens across the stage would
seem a difficult task. But it is not
too difficult for Richard Wagner.
The audience may go home for din
ner after the second act; it may even
enjoy an intermission after the third,
hut no applause, please, during the
performance. Quiet, please, for
"Goetterdammerung." The audience
was glad to abide by its composer's
rules Saturday night.
The lady behind me elucidated on
tne first scene: "It wasn't really
Gun ther who came through the wall
of fire, you see; it was Sigfried dis
guised as Gunther wearing the Tarn
helm after he had drunk the potion
. . ." But I gave up trying to re
member the plot details. I gave up
trying to identify the motives—"Hail
to Love," "Loge," "Siegfried,"
"Guardian of the Sword," and the
hundred other orchestral themes
that reinforce, foretell the legend.
