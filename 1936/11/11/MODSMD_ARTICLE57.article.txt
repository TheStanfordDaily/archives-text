# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						RESCUE 
### 
To the "Critics":
Poor "Roadside." Hard is the lot
of a play that depends on ideas and
emotions rather than on a fast,
scintillating plot and dialogue, espe
cially when it is under the fire of the
sophisticates of a modern university.
"Roadside" bore a pink banner—and
immediately a large part of last Fri
day's audience rose up in valiant
protest, declaring it red.
The plot was weak, but the idea of
the story was not in a clever story
and sparkling lines; the characters
were a little old and overplayed—but
they were real parts in a real atmos
phere far beyond the ken of most of
us. I suppose We, with our all-in
clusive background and our fine ap
preciation, should be in a position
to criticize a play that we more than
likely didn't understand.
The cohorts of our paper - doll
cutting chem majors criticize the
play ,and to a certain extent justly,
for being an overdone production of
a vapid .threadbare, unexciting and
unreal story long since overworked—
with characters stereotyped and
played to death. But the skeptics
who so frown on the construction of
Friday evening's performance have
made the fatal mistake of trying to

reason out everything in the play
according to our ultra-sophisticated
standards of today.
The courtroom scene certainly
gives them ample illustrations of
their point, but they cannot try to
make everything seem rational and
still appreciate the real meaning of
the play. This does not lie in the
story as such—it is simple and plain
—but it is the story of human beings,
their thoughts, their feelings, and as
such has a quality of nobleness that
is missed by those who mechanically
hack at the construction of the play.
What right have we to object to a
scene which may seem, to us, a trifle
worn and does not lay claim to any
essential essence of "modernism" if
it serves as an expressive brush with
which to paint the "living" of our
characters? Therefore, although the
play both in its original script and
in the production had its faults, I
believe that those who hail last Fri
day night's production of "Roadside"
as an excellent performance of a fine
play are on the side of fairness. I, for
one, am with them.

To the "Critics":
Poor "Roadside." Hard is the lot
of a play that depends on ideas and
emotions rather than on a fast,
scintillating plot and dialogue, espe
cially when it is under the fire of the
sophisticates of a modern university.
"Roadside" bore a pink banner—and
immediately a large part of last Fri
day's audience rose up in valiant
protest, declaring it red.
The plot was weak, but the idea of
the story was not in a clever story
and sparkling lines; the characters
were a little old and overplayed—but
they were real parts in a real atmos
phere far beyond the ken of most of
us. I suppose We, with our all-in
clusive background and our fine ap
preciation, should be in a position
to criticize a play that we more than
likely didn't understand.
The cohorts of our paper - doll
cutting chem majors criticize the
play ,and to a certain extent justly,
for being an overdone production of
a vapid .threadbare, unexciting and
unreal story long since overworked—
with characters stereotyped and
played to death. But the skeptics
who so frown on the construction of
Friday evening's performance have
made the fatal mistake of trying to

reason out everything in the play
according to our ultra-sophisticated
standards of today.
The courtroom scene certainly
gives them ample illustrations of
their point, but they cannot try to
make everything seem rational and
still appreciate the real meaning of
the play. This does not lie in the
story as such—it is simple and plain
—but it is the story of human beings,
their thoughts, their feelings, and as
such has a quality of nobleness that
is missed by those who mechanically
hack at the construction of the play.
What right have we to object to a
scene which may seem, to us, a trifle
worn and does not lay claim to any
essential essence of "modernism" if
it serves as an expressive brush with
which to paint the "living" of our
characters? Therefore, although the
play both in its original script and
in the production had its faults, I
believe that those who hail last Fri
day night's production of "Roadside"
as an excellent performance of a fine
play are on the side of fairness. I, for
one, am with them.
