# Wilbur Flays Grid Drunks
## Action of Princeton Head Praised by Educators 
### 
Tippling at football games brought
comment last week from President
Fiay Lyman Wilbur, who joined with
other educators in the current Lit
erary Digest to praise the action of
President Harold W. Dodds of
Princeton in requesting that fans re
frain from drinking at Tiger athletic
contests.
The statement, one of a group
emanating from scores of colleges
throughout the nation in reply to
what was intended by Dr. Dodds as
only a gentle plea to the fans to re
spect intercollegiate athletics, was as
follows, "I agree with President
Dodds of Princeton that it is a real
problem and something must be
done."
Prexy Dodds' request came as a
result of the fact that last year two
truckloads of dead soldiers were
carted away clinking merrily from
the stadium. The little incident
wherein a raccoon-coated Princeton
fan under the influence swayed onto
the field last year in the Princeton-
Dartmouth game, lined up with the
Tigers, and then got himself prac
tically drowned in the Green Wave
that swept over him on its way

around end, was another factor re
sulting in the action by Dr. Dodds
before the Navy game two weeks
ago.
Many other colleges, Dartmouth,
Yale, Illinois, Ohio State, Notre
Dame, Wisconsin, Pittsburgh, and
Minnesota included, fell in line with
the policy of Dr. Dodds. Harvard,
however, which seems to have a par
ticularly fine time being nasty to
arch-enemy Princeton, was in com
plete opposition to the action. The
Crimson, Harvard's undergraduate
publication, came forth with the
statement, in part, that "This year's
award for torch-bearer of righteous
ness goes by unanimous vote to the
President of Princeton."

Some alumni of Califomia want
U.C.L.A. to be separated from the j
Berkeley school.
