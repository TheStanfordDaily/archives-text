# Lecturer Talks On Modern Culture
## 
### 
Dr. Albert W. Beaven, president
of the Colgate Rochester Theologi
cal Seminary, past president of the
Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America, spoke last night
in the Assembly Hall on ''Contem
porary Culture in the Christian
World." His purpose was to give
some of the convictions which, as a
representative of the National
Preaching Mission, he is touring the
country to present.
In closing Dr. Beavien said: "Our
conviction is that throughout the
clashes in the days ahead, clashes
in social reconstruction, we most
need to enter them in a mood en
tirely different from the present
one."
