tion, Cardinals last night set ma
chinery into motion to open the golf
clubhouse tomorrow night for in
formal entertainment from 9 until 1
o'clock.
In an effort to make the nitery ex
periment a more accurate gauge of
campus interest, Cardinals will oper
ate the golf clubhouse for dancers
and drop-inners every night for a
week, except Sunday, beginning to
morrow night. One hundred dollars
has been appropriated for the week's
expenses.
