# A.S.U. Revives Show Boycott
## Plans Meeting Monday With Campus Heads 
### 
Steps to resuscitate campus pro
test against Paly theater prices and
attitude were taken last night as the
American Students' Union consti
tuted itself as a committee to bring
together college organizations for
concerted action.
First move planned is a confer
ence of representatives from halls,
fraternities, and eating clubs Mon
day at 1:30 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse. A.S.U. members will
contact organization heads during
this week urging them to attend.
President Louise Ulph emphasized
that the A.S.U. was not trying to run
the affair. "There is a definite pro
test movement on the campus, but
it has not yet been organized. We
will act only as co-ordinators. In
what way pressure will be brought
to bear on theater owners will be
decided by the conference."
It was the general opinion of
A.S.U. members that as the first step,
a committee should be appointed to
request show managers for lower
prices and permission to stage an
annual Pajamarino theater rally.
Picketing and boycott weapons
would be used only if an amicable
agreement were not reached.
