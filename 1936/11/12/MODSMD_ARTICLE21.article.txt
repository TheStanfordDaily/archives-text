# Rally Today Speeds Cards Off To Oregon State Clash
## Farewell to Gridsters Scheduled for Paly-Depot This Afternoon 
### 
Tiny and his boys have really put !
on some grand gridiron shows this
season for the loyal followers of the I
Cardinal banner, and those self
same followers are going to have a |
chance to participate in a Stanford
victory.
The time is today at 5 o'clock
sharp; the place is the Paly-S.P. dc- 1
pot ;and the occasion is the send-off
rally for Stanford's gridiron greats
who are entraining for Portland and
a battle with the Oregon State Bea
vers.
Peppy Speeches
Those loyal followers have their
chance to participate in a victory for
the old Injun, because a spirited
send-off means a fired-up, deter
mined team, and a fired-up, deter
mined Stanford football team this
season means dynamite for any op
position.
And if it's peppy speeches you
want, take a look at the quartet of
pigskin authorities who will climb
aboard the baggage wagon and ex
pound on Stanford's chances in Sat
urday' sstruggle. Head man Tiny
Thornhill, Bobby Grayson, Claude
Callaway, and Jimmy Coffis are
scheduled to speak.
Pick Up Walkers
Web Jones and his two assistants,
Jim Ransohoff and Nelson Wheeler,
will be there to keep things going
with yells and songs. Song sheets
will be distributed at the station.
Students with cars are asked to
co-operate by picking up all students
who intend to walk down to the sta
tion, and it is rumored that any Row
men can amble over to Roble and
transport the fair inmates to Paly.
The train leaves at 5:17, so the
parting shot is for everybody to be
there and be there early.
