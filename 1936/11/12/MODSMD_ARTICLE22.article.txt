## Thousands Watch Blaze Do $80,000 Damage 
### 
A stubborn blaze that defied the
efforts of firemen for three hours
last, night completely destroyed the
E. C. Thoits shoe store, 174 Univer
sity Avenue, causing damage esti
mated at between 70,000 and $80,000.
A crowd of approximately 5000
witnessed the fire, that lit up the
skies for miles and for a time threat
ened an entire block in the heart of
Palo Alto's business district.
Near Disaster
First attempts to reach the heart,
of the blaze in basement storage
rooms resulted in near disaster when
a sidewalk elevator door was opened
and flames shot up to a height of
nearly 20 feet. Firemen waded in
water waist-deep as they slowly
fought the flames back that for a
time belched through front show
windows.
The alarm was turned in by Joe
Ethen, restaurant owner, at 7 p.m.,
the Palo Alto fire department re
ported. As the flames spread, bil
lowing smoke skyward, additional
apparatus was summoned from
Menlo Park, Redwood City, and
Stanford.
Don't Scare Our Boys
Attempts to reach the flames from
the rear of the store were unsuccess
ful, and ten hose lines poured water
into the building from University
Avenue. As 10-foot square show
windows were bashed in by firemen's
axes, news photographers were cau
tioned not to take any pictures.
"The light frightens the firemen,"
Officer George Burns explained,
and makes them drop the hoses."
The building, built in 1910, was of
Class B construction. Its upper floors,
damaged by smoke and water, were
occupied by the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company.
