# Peace Groups Give Reading
## 'Bury the Dead' Presented As Armistice Program 
### 
Last night in the Little Theater six
men, pronounced "dead 48 hours"
by the army doctor, stood up and
refused to he huried.
This was the situation in Irwin
Shaw's "Bury the Dead," which was
read under the auspices of five cam
pus organizations strongly in favor
of Peaceâ€”American Student Union,
History Cluh, Y.W.C.A., Pi Lambda
Theta, and Stanford Committee on
Peace Activity.
Disregarding orders from superior
officers, pleas of their women, and of
priests, the six ghostly specters re
fused to be placed under six feet
of soil.
The outstanding interpretation was
read by L. C. Mendenhall, who gave
a fine performance as both the First
Soldier and the First General. As
the tough sergeant, Robert Ireland
was convincing. Rosemary Hay read
a mother's pleas with excellent emo
tional stress.
Raising her voice to shouts at
times, Virginia Rogers read Martha
Webster, wife of one of the corpses,
exceedingly well. For a cast com
paratively new to Stanford audi
ences, the performance was ex
tremely well given.
After the reading Professor Hol
land D. Roberts led an open forum
discussion on the merits of the play
as peace propaganda.
