# Thornhill Hopes To Fatten Win Column Off O.S.C. In Portland Saturday
## 
### HERB DIAMOND 
A goodly supply of determination,
a few new offensive tricks, and spirit
aplenty wilf be heading for Portland
this afternoon when the train carry
ing 34 Redskin grid warriors and
their coaching staff departs from
Palo Alto at 5 o'clock.
Now entirely freed from injuries
that have beset them since the first
of the season, Ihe Farm men have
hopes for vanquishing Coach Lon
Stiner s Beavers, and these hopes
have indeed mounted high. Any
thing but a push-over, however, will
be the Oregon Staters.
Beavers Are Threat
All within the period of one week,
the Beavers have built, up what, con
stitutes a major threat in the Coast
league. There are at least two pretty
good reasons behind this fact: a
couple of gentlemen named Joe Gray
and Elmer Kolberg, who at one time
01* another last Saturday did plenty
in downing Washington State. "The
Gray Ghost" and ashy fullback Kol
berg can both heave the pork-hide
with deadly accuracy, and Kolberg
is particularly talented at punting.
Aerial O(Tense Fortified
Tiny Thornhill, however, has been
busy fortifying his charges against
this touted aerial offense talent. And
now that the Cardinals have some
thing of an efficient passing attack
themselves, the tussle in Multnomah
Stadium Saturday afternoon should
turn out to be a spectacular event for
the customers.
Stiner has disclosed the informa
tion that his squad will pass if the
Redshirts pass. And Tiny has indi
cated that he will send his outfit into
the fray ready to match the Beavers
on any offensive terms that may be
chosen.
Home-Field Advantage
In respect to aerial antics, Stiner is
more or less depending upon Gray,
Kolberg, and diminutive Halfback
Johnny Alexander. Thornhill has
Jake Brigham, Tony Calvelli, and
Glenn Hamilton to draw from. Only
change of line-up in last night's
short workout, was the shift of Tom
Collins, to quarterback, now that
Hamilton has filled out the fullback
ranks. ,
Unlike the green turf found on the
major battlegrounds of California,
the Multnomah field is made of a
clay-like sand mixture. And, should
rain fall this week-end, it will bo
come slimy mud in very short order.
Even under the best of conditions,
visiting gridsters have found Port
land's field not entirely to the best
of their advantage, while to the
Beavers it amounts to home terri
tory.
Hamilton Will Play
Although Tiny has not yet defi
nitely named a starting line-up, he
has declared that both G!,enn Hamil
ton, out since the Cougar contest, and
Cab Callaway ,injured last Saturday,
will be billed for some action. He
has also pointed out. that there will
be no resting of regulars for the Bic
Game, but that the squad will be out
to conquer Oregon State, if it
means the use of every one of the 34
men leaving today.
