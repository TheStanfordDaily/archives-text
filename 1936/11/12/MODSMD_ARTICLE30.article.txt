My roommate, a noted howling
advocate of personal freedom, has
just discovered that he can get out
of political science section meeting
by bringing a note from his doctor
suggesting that he was absent on ac
count of how he had acute appendi
citis and double pneumonia.
No doubt such excuses are neces
sary, for how else is the instructor to
know that the absentee was not
really in fine fettle all the time, and
had merely ducked the class to pick
up a little spare change in a penny
ante poker game at the house before
lunch?
■* * *
As necessary affidavits to assure
Ihe instructor that sheer physical
•mpossibility prevented the absentee
rom showing up for the usual 50
ninutes of wisdom, such excuses
lave a certain utility, but at the
ame time, a whole lot of us wonder
the whole business of compulsory
. tlendance is not kindergarten and
l.igh school stuff. Kindergarten, you
1 call, is the place where you raised
y >ur hand to leave the room, and at
hgh school you were requested to
continue your studies elsewhere if
you ducked off for an afternoon or
l\ o.
As far as I can see, forcing students
to come to class is not a very great

to diplomas and Stanford would have
1o establish a "pass degree" like they

student body at Oxford, where you
pa; s your money and you gets your

But is it possible that instructors
have a certain amount of vanity and,

advocate of personal freedom, has
just discovered that he can get out
of political science section meeting
by bringing a note from his doctor
suggesting that he was absent on ac
count of how he had acute appendi

No doubt such excuses are neces
sary, for how else is the instructor to
know that the absentee was not
really in fine fettle all the time, and
had merely ducked the class to pick
up a little spare change in a penny
