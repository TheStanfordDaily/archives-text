# Foreign House Idea Wins Farm Approval

### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Stanford may not be a World's
Fair ground but it does have it "bits"
of foreign countries. Remember the
"Bit of Old England" and "Bit of
Sweden" at Chicago? On the Farm
it's the German and French houses.
Last year Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan
brought back from the University of
Wisconsin the idea of a residence for
women interested in speaking Ger
man, and put it over. This year Pro
fessors Espinosa and Sellards of the
Romanic languages department have
persuaded the University to turn last
year's graduate house into a French
hall.
Two French Majors
Miss Lucie Lataillade, the director,
was born in Pasadena, but admits to
having studied in France.
The 13 girls who live in the French
house take their meals at the Union.
Most of them are sophomores and

only two of them are majoring in
French. Kay Kalenborn is their
president, Enid Kuche their vice
president, and Marcia Miller, secre
tary-treasurer.
The French house girls are socially
minded. They believe in keeping up
the "Gay Paree" tradition. So far,
according to Miss Lataillade, they've
had on an average of two "at homes"
a week.
Many Upperclassmen
Last year the German house was in
Elm Cottage. Dr. David Charles
Gardner turned his home over to the
University when he retired last
spring, and this year the German
students arc living there.
Seven of the 13 are majoring in
German, and most of them are upper
classmen. They are taken care of by
Miss Maude Hausmann with Elsa
Wiedemann as house president.
