EVEN THE GALS
GO FOR HOXINt;
I
To us old fashioned guys who are j
constantly wailing about the disap- |
pearance of the Staniord Rough, j
there are annually two soothing
balms.
They are the all-University boxing
championships, the first of which, the
novice division, is having its final
rounds fought out tonight in the Pa
vilion.
I say soothing because in spite of
the fact that this gaberdined and
swede shod campus isn't interested
in coming out for track or baseball
or anything or even watching the
boys that do compete, there is always
a swell turnout for the boxing
matches. And pugilism is a very
masculine sport indeed.
I went over to the prelims Tuesday
and the spectators were hanging into
the windows with their teeth, they
were so dense. And they were all
enjoying it, too.
Maloney, Priddle, Myndei'se, and
Zimet, the boys who are running it
off, have done a great job—they have
kindled so much interest in the tour
ney that the turnout is bigger than
ever before—44 bruisers entered, and
all novices, meaning that they have
n't won in boxing competition here
up to now.
They have eight weight classes,
HO, 129, 139, 149, 149, 169 179,
and heavyweight, and the Circle
S Society is presenting gold gloves
to victors. Sixteen will fight
in the finals tonight, and a lot of
good varsity material has been un
covered already in Lovelace, Barkan,
Milner, Greenlee's brother, Hard
acre, Zeller, Rogers, and others.
The boys fight three two-minute
rounds, and some of them really
mean business.
Have ya seen boxing matches?
Didn't ya like 'em? Boys and girls
both, come on down tonight; you
won't regret it.
THEY SHOW IT TO
TIIEIII GRANDCHILDREN
Here's an interesting angle that
creeps up when a lot of seniors
graduate off the football team: At
B.A.C. meeting last week, came up
the problem of $2000 worth of foot
ball gear that was missing after the
Rose Bowl game this year.
Tiny Thornhill says it's an ac
cepted custom the country over that
seniors get their equipment when
their last game is played.
"What they'll do with it I don't
know, unless they go into profes
sional ball, but nevertheless, they
take the equipment because custo
marily they're entitled to it."
When Tive or six seniors graduate,
the loss doesn't amount to much, but
last time 10 seniors left the Stanford
team.
