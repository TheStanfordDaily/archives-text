# Gray, Rambler Clash Slated For Saturday
## Trialhorses Get Chance To Exhibit Wares In Lone Tilt This Season 
### 
Saturday is Der Tag for those poor I
guys that get out there night after
night and have the Big Red Ma
chine take trial spins through their
territory.
The Grays, who lightly should be
steamroiled into submission at this
.stage of the season, go over to Cal
to engage the Ramblers in the pre
liminary to the Bear-Oregon tilt
day after tomorrow, and they're go
ing with the idea of taking in some
Bear meat.
The varsity gets all the publicity,
but the fellows that work their heads
off getting no place, changing their
style of play every week to simulate
that of the next opponent so that the
varsity can learn something, are the
fodder that feeds the Indian. They
play only one game a year, with the
Ramblers, and it means a lot.
The California outfit, which plays
a regular schedule and is a much
more closely knit, organized team, is
doped to win every year. The Grays
trounced them iast year, and several
times before, too, so figures don't
mean a thing to them. A lot of the
members are really good, with speed,
ability to block, ability to kick, and
swell passing arms. Tiny has to
draw a line somewhere for the var
sity, and the distinction is often
very close.
Coached by Husky Hunt, who
spends most of his season chasing
around the Coast scouting different
teams and hence can't give his team
more than a smattering of plays to
work on, the team is more of an in
formal get - together, without tea,
than a football squad. But they can
play football once in a while, if they
have to, like they do against the
Ramblers.
The fellows who will start against
the Cal team, chosen largely for the
faithfulness they have shown in
coming out every blessed night to
take it from the Beeg Boys, are
Waldron and Bowers, ends; Sin
clair and Beckley, tack s; Ellis and
Cohn, guards; Haffner, â€ženter; Blase,
quarter; McGuire and Dorr, halves;
and Jordan, fullback.
Others who are a cinch to play
sometime during the game are Da
kan and Cummings, ends; Carnahan,
tackle; Gustalson and Draee, guards;
Meeia, center; Carew and Fay,
halves; Alustiza, quarter; and Sjus
trom, fullback.
