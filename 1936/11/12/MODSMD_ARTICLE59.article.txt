# Honor Code
## 
### 
The two Councils have had no cases of class
room Honor Code violations this quarter.
This may or may not mean that last spring's
Honor Code pyrotechnics, and this fall's Pre-
Registration period have completely instilled
the Honor Code into the hearts and minds of
Stanford's grade-gatherers.
For the effect on the number of cases re
ported, we'll have to wait until after the first
finals. The number of violations of the Honor
Code that are not reported no one ever knows.
I think everyone will agree, even though
it is not known how much actual cheating is
done, the Honor Code as a general disciplinary
system is successful at Stanford. As long as
I have attended the school I've never seen any
one except myself cheat. And everyone you
talk to on the subject is pretty generally agreed
that there are few violations going on.
The fear of getting tossed out of school, the
act of putting the Honor Code on a moralistic
ground deters many a student.
The problem of enforcement, though, is an
other thing. Theoretically, the class-average
appeal as an incentive for students to turn in
violators is fine. But it doesn't work except in
cases such as the language class violations of
last year, when mass violations definitely
showed the conscientious students that they
were paying a penalty for being conscientious;
generally, though, the inclination of the student
is not to report a fellow student violating the
Code.
A large percentage of the discovered viola
tions come via the professors, who can smell
errata in the answers to the exes, or else are
told by students in the courses. But a large
percentage of the professors take these viola
tions into their own hands, and the cases never
get taken up before the student councils.
Since it is none of their affair if class averages
are raised or lowered, and since they are apt
to have a more tolerant attitude toward student
aberrations than the student administrators, the
professors have even less of an inclination to
turn in violators.
The two Councils spend a good deal of time
weeping and wailing and beating their breasts
and renew efforts every year to get the pro
fessors to co-operate, pleading that there is a
need for centralization in order that there be a
uniform administration.
No matter how much activity goes on, though,
the professors always resist the appeal of the
Councils, and though Ph.D.'s may be anti-social
irdividualists, they have a definite reason for
their resistance.
Their standpoint was pretty well expressed
or inferred at last spring's Honor Code meet
ings, particularly by the younger professors.
They could not see for one thing that the pen
alties were proportionate. They reasoned that
to flunk a student in a course for an Honor Code
v olation was not fair, since the grade system
is not a measure of a student's morals, but of
his blue-book ability. Because a student cheated
was no sign he knew nothing else in the course.
Sludents working for Phi Bete are under just as
ij-'uch pressure to cheat as students trying to
k-jep from being flunked out of school.
For another thing, professors enlightened in
20th century psychology or sociology believed
that students found cheating were frequently
nsurotic or else subject to tremendous pres
to .ires, in which instance the case was one for
a trained psychiatrist who could treat the case
c'inically, rather than for a group of amateur
.'iludent jurists sitting in bank.
Tossing out of school, with its resultant ter
rific pressures in the home, only aggravated
tiie condition. It seemed to them to be symp
tomatic of the Dark Ages, for one student's
personality and life to be wrecked so that a
qroup of very earnest and sincere students
night get practice in student administration.
But I think we can carry the thing farther.
Jt isn't only Honor Code violating that is wreck
ing personalities at Stanford. There are plenty
of maladjustments caused by an educational
; process set up to train professors. It is a process
that has broken down under the demand that
so many of tomorrow's citizens get a "liberal
education." It isn't good for anyone to learn the
art of the four-year loaf, or be forced to learn
things which have no significance and no mean
ing for him, to be forced to study for the sake
of studying,
This causes more maladjustments than the
Honor Code ever thought of, and it causes most
cf the Honor Code maladjustments.
