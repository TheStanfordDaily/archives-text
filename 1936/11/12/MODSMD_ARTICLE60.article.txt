# Mens Sana in Corpore Sano

I am not a Luddite, nor do I think wo should
turn the clock back to a feudal economy, but I
think the machine is vastly overrated. Now
Stanford's cult of the muscle and the body also
is overdone. However, there is a certain classi
- al harmony that might be attained do you
follow me?
It is a tradition tint the Stanford student is
1 orn with a silver spoon in his mouth and a

gearshift lever in one hand. The other hand
probably is fishing in the pocket for the credit
card.
When he grows up to a certain age, he
makes all kinds of efforts to get on the Farm.
After he gets here he makes all kinds of efforts
on week-ends to get off.
When he's on the campus, he drives the car
down to the gym when it's time to get his exer
cise; he drives his car down to class to save
time and spends 10 minutes parking.
If cars don't stop driving so fast past the
English Corner and the Post Offfice somebody's
going to get killed.
