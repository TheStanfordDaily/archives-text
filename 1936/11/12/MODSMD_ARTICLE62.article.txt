SIPS THAT SLIP IN THE STADIUM
That a raccoon-coated drunk played interference for
a Princeton football team last year during the Dart
mouth game, and that the final gun was a signal for
two truck loads of empties to start for the dump are
grounds for cries of puzzled disapproval from Prince
ton Prexy Dodds.
Actually, there's nothing puzzling, nor is there any
thing to cry about.
In the first place, anyone wearing a raccoon coat is
liable to get drunk enough to play football. In the
second place, the impulse that sends the public to the
games is the sanve impulse that makes .them bring a
bottle.
And President Dodds knows it.
And his stadium dramatic managers know it.
And up until now they've had sense enough to keep
quiet.
But in an unguarded moment, perhaps driven on by
the protests of some powerful poor fool who can't face
facts other than those on his monthly bank statement.
President Dodds has frowned and shaken his official
head.
Which makes of President Dodds something a little
less than a President, who is supposed to "know" about
these things, and a little more than an administrative
stooge, who isn t supposed to know even the bee-and
the-pollen version of University growth and profit.
* * * *
Appreciating Dr. Dodds' academic attainments, we
insist he protested under pressure. For no one who
runs a University today can really believe that football
fans come to the nation's oval meccas out of clean love
of a grand old game. Dr. Dodds knows they come to
get a taste of a synthetic miasma known as "collitch."
And if the intoxication of rooting section, band, bets,
and banners isn't enough, who's to say the intoxication
of the bottle is worse than these, or that it isn't needed
to complete the picture.
Certainly not Dr. Dodds, at least not the Dr. Dodds
who appears without his suppressions in a trustee
proof study.
* * * *
For he must know what goes on. And he must
know that analyzed, his protest is not against the man
in the raccoon coat who drowned his inhibitions, nor
against the thousands of dead soldiers that were found
following the game.
Rather, that the raccoon-coated cent did his drown
ing in public, and that the dead soldiers were placed in
a truck and brazenly carted in public to the dump.
That was unforgivable, we agree.

And President Dodds knows it.
And his stadium dramatic managers know it.
And up until now they've had sense enough to keep
quiet.
But in an unguarded moment, perhaps driven on by
the protests of some powerful poor fool who can't face
facts other than those on his monthly bank statement.
President Dodds has frowned and shaken his official
head.
Which makes of President Dodds something a little
less than a President, who is supposed to "know" about
these things, and a little more than an administrative
stooge, who isn t supposed to know even the bee-and
the-pollen version of University growth and profit.
* * * *
Appreciating Dr. Dodds' academic attainments, we
insist he protested under pressure. For no one who
runs a University today can really believe that football
fans come to the nation's oval meccas out of clean love
of a grand old game. Dr. Dodds knows they come to
get a taste of a synthetic miasma known as "collitch."
And if the intoxication of rooting section, band, bets,
and banners isn't enough, who's to say the intoxication
of the bottle is worse than these, or that it isn't needed
to complete the picture.
Certainly not Dr. Dodds, at least not the Dr. Dodds
who appears without his suppressions in a trustee
proof study.

For he must know what goes on. And he must
know that analyzed, his protest is not against the man
in the raccoon coat who drowned his inhibitions, nor
against the thousands of dead soldiers that were found
following the game.
Rather, that the raccoon-coated cent did his drown
ing in public, and that the dead soldiers were placed in
a truck and brazenly carted in public to the dump.
That was unforgivable, we agree.

SIPS THAT SLIP IN THE STADIUM
That a raccoon-coated drunk played interference for
a Princeton football team last year during the Dart
mouth game, and that the final gun was a signal for
two truck loads of empties to start for the dump are
grounds for cries of puzzled disapproval from Prince
ton Prexy Dodds.
Actually, there's nothing puzzling, nor is there any
thing to cry about.
In the first place, anyone wearing a raccoon coat is
liable to get drunk enough to play football. In the
second place, the impulse that sends the public to the
games is the sanve impulse that makes .them bring a
bottle.
And President Dodds knows it.
And his stadium dramatic managers know it.
