Ex Committee doesn't want to have its wisecracks
printed in the paper because it gives students the idea
that maybe Ex Committee is not like the Supreme
Court or the Oracle at Delphi. This is the same idea
that professors don't want their wisecracks printed in
the paper on the grounds that it makes them sound as
if they are not professors.
But nonetheless, there was a moment during last
Ex Committee meeting when the world ceased revolv
ing on its axis, and such epoch-making events must be
chronicled in order that the students should know
whoosis got the axis.
It was all over the matter of a Christmas play that
the "Y" was sponsoring in the Memorial Church.
This, according to the "Y" woman, would have a chance
to develop on the lines of the passion play at Santa
Clara.
"Or at the Zcte house," murmured President Little
Jim.
Now I am not one of those to gripe and grouse about
Cellar food. This may be because I don't eat Cellar
food (some maintain that this is an impossibility).
Wong's kitch is good enough for me. But I actually
know a Breaker who graduated a couple of years ago
and now lives in Palo Alto, who gets so lonesome for
the Cellar that he comes out and eats here every noon,
when he could just as well get his indigestion in Paly.
At Bertrand's and the Lodge the food is too good, the
L'Aiglon is not overcrowded, the Mandarin and the
Texas are too inexpensive, the various Wilson's are
too efficient; in short, none of them have the necessary
atmosphere that makes the Cellar unparalleled in
evoking that O. O. Mclntyre nostalgia. But they tell me
that somebody saw a cookbook on Miss Picker's desk.
It has been an editorial policy of Our Hasher for
some years now that the American Building Mainte
nance Corp. is sweeping the campus. But it isn't an
easy as it sounds. Ned. the cross-eyed janitor, claims
that the No Smoking on the Quad tradition is not being
carried out, and is looking for President Wilbur to
enforce it.
"If I were president," says Ned, "there would be no
ifs or butts about it."
Ned is looking with mixed emotions to the rainy
season. The trouble with the dry weather in the fall
is that the wind blows all the dust off the Memorial
Court and the Museum, and gets in the professors' desks
and noses. But the rainy season brings alluvial fans
in the corridors. The result is that the janitorial de
partment gets wiped.
The janitors don't mind this *.o much, they figure
that it's part of their job, but what they don't like is
that they have to come from their Class A living quar
ters to work over in the slum-like atmosphere of Quad
classrooms and ofliees and working for the Union
lowers their position from professional men to laborers.

when he could just as well get his indigestion in Paly.
At Bertrand's and the Lodge the food is too good, the
L'Aiglon is not overcrowded, the Mandarin and the
Texas are too inexpensive, the various Wilson's are
too efficient; in short, none of them have the necessary
atmosphere that makes the Cellar unparalleled in
evoking that O. O. Mclntyre nostalgia. But they tell me
that somebody saw a cookbook on Miss Picker's desk.
It has been an editorial policy of Our Hasher for
some years now that the American Building Mainte
nance Corp. is sweeping the campus. But it isn't an
easy as it sounds. Ned. the cross-eyed janitor, claims
that the No Smoking on the Quad tradition is not being
carried out, and is looking for President Wilbur to
enforce it.
"If I were president," says Ned, "there would be no
ifs or butts about it."
Ned is looking with mixed emotions to the rainy
season. The trouble with the dry weather in the fall
is that the wind blows all the dust off the Memorial
Court and the Museum, and gets in the professors' desks
and noses. But the rainy season brings alluvial fans
in the corridors. The result is that the janitorial de
partment gets wiped.
The janitors don't mind this *.o much, they figure
that it's part of their job, but what they don't like is
that they have to come from their Class A living quar
ters to work over in the slum-like atmosphere of Quad
classrooms and ofliees and working for the Union
lowers their position from professional men to laborers.
Ex Committee doesn't want to have its wisecracks
printed in the paper because it gives students the idea
that maybe Ex Committee is not like the Supreme
Court or the Oracle at Delphi. This is the same idea
that professors don't want their wisecracks printed in
the paper on the grounds that it makes them sound as
if they are not professors.
But nonetheless, there was a moment during last
Ex Committee meeting when the world ceased revolv
ing on its axis, and such epoch-making events must be
chronicled in order that the students should know
whoosis got the axis.
It was all over the matter of a Christmas play that
the "Y" was sponsoring in the Memorial Church.
This, according to the "Y" woman, would have a chance
to develop on the lines of the passion play at Santa
Clara.
"Or at the Zcte house," murmured President Little
Jim.
Now I am not one of those to gripe and grouse about
Cellar food. This may be because I don't eat Cellar
food (some maintain that this is an impossibility).
Wong's kitch is good enough for me. But I actually
know a Breaker who graduated a couple of years ago
and now lives in Palo Alto, who gets so lonesome for
the Cellar that he comes out and eats here every noon,
when he could just as well get his indigestion in Paly.
