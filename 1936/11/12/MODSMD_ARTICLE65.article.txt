ON ROADSIDE: "Roadside" was
an entertaining piece, whatever else j
may be said about it. Director Langc
obviously chose to ruin the play for
the audience, which, considering the
audience, was not an unwise thing
to do. Undoubtedly there was too
much slapstick, too much burlesque,
too much Punch and Judy stuff from
the judge, but it was good theater.
It may have been lousy drama, but
it was funny as hell.
COLE PORTER'S new tunes sound ;
slightly reminiscent of some of his
older ones. "It's De-lovely," from his
new Broadway show, "Red, Hot, and
Blue," sounds an awful lot like
"You're Too Far Away," and "I've
Got You Under My Skin," featured
in Eleanor Powell's new picture,
"Born to Dance," is just a rewrite
of "Begin the Beguine."
PICKETING IS POPULAR all
I over the country these days, and
' especially in Philadelphia. There the
| Musicians' Union, tiffing with War
ner Bros, theaters over size and scale
of bands, has ordered all members
to report for picket duty including
renowned symphony director Leo
j pold Stokowski. Stoki has indicated
his willingness to march, too.
On the other hand, theater own-
I ers are taking up picketing against
I producers. The Philly motion pic
ture owners association has decided
1o picket all theaters showing Grand
National pictures, because the own

ers association thinks G.N. rentals
are too high.
ITS A PLEASURE to see and hear
Shirley Jones sing. The gal has what
it takes to put a song over. She can
sell it with a professional manner
that no one else around here ap
proaches. Her technique is delightful
on a campus filled with hams.
HOUSTON, Tex., Nov. 11 (UP).—
Police arrested 25 striking seamen
at Port Houston today for disobey
ing orders to cease picketing the
waterfront.
