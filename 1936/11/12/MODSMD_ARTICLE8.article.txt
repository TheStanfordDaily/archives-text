# Off-Campus Dance Regulation Revised
## 
### 
Abolishment of the present regu
lation requiring the presence of a
member of Men's Council and Wom
en's Council at all off-campus dances
was undertaken at the meeting of
Ex Committee Tuesday night. As a
substitute the dance chairman and
the president of the organization giv
ing thtf dance are to be responsible
for idl cases of misconduct.
This system is to be tried out until
winter quarter and. if successful, will
be permanent. As yet it requires the
approval of Dean Mary Yost. It is
thought that the new system will
offer more control and be more
agreeable to everybody, as in past
years Council members often found
it inconvenient to attend dances
more than a few minutes.
