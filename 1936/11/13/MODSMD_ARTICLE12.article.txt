# Searsville Dam Would Cut Farm Pumping Cost

### DAVE LEFF 
What with shower baths, Encina
soup, find non-alcoholic beverages,
Stanford consumes 4,310,000 gallons
of water per week. Measured out
into half-pint tumblers, this amount
of water would .servo each of our
3,095 students and 1,080 faculty
members with 1.1.569.9 classes of
Union lemonade apiece.
Enough people take showers in
B.A.C. gymnasium to account for
.'OO.OOO gallons of the clear and
sparkling stuff every seven days. The
board pumps its own, but the re
mainder of what the Corporation
Yard calls "domestic water" comes
from two campus wells, one 040 feet
in depth drilled only two years ago
—the Other Sit foot deep
Though figures are lacking, the
pumping costs here are terrific, and

plans arc all slaked out for the
building of a dam one and one
quarter miles below Searsville. This
earthen structure. 100 feet high, 500
feet thick at. the and calling'
for -100.000 cubic feet of dirt, may be
built this sprint* quarter. If it is
completed by 1939. the Boar Gulch
Water Company has promised to
purchase some of the 1.750.000.000
gallons its reservoir will contain.
This figure, reading into the billions,
will contain five and one-half times
as much liquid as SearsviHe's present
paltry capacity of .110.000.000 gallons.
Last year this time, weekly water
consumption was within a few hun
dred thousand gallons of the present
figure, but back in *31, with prohibi
tion still in force, Stanford was using
only 2,574,000 gallons of water per
week.
