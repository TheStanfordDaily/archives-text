# Wilbur Dings Every Nitery 'Unhealthy'
## Masters Approves For B. A. C.; Dancers Not To Use Club Showers 
### 
Dinged yesterday afternoon as a
nightly affair was the Nitery, pro
jected to run every evening the
coming week at the goLf course club
house.
However, the dance will be held
tonight from 9 to 1 and Saturday
until 12, as previously planned. Pho
nograph music, fountain service, and
scenery will be provided at the end
of the turn-off from Junipero boule
vard as indicated in accompanying
illustration.
Farm No Night Club
When approached by Cardinal
Tom Killeler with the plan of a
Nitery that would be a six-night
per-week affair, President Ray Ly
man Wilbur said in effect that Stan
ford University could not be con
verted into a night club.
"Ihe Nitery is a good thing," he
stated later, "but too much hysteria
at first will blow it right out of the
water. First thing you know, the
rest homes will fill up and people
will be sick during examinations.
Tlie idea of a Nitery on week-ends
naturally meets with my approval.
But it seems to me that too much of
a good thing at the beginning is
liable to reduce it to too little at the
end. Every-nitery would rapidly
become no nitery at all."
A regulation requiring chaperones
was issued from the dean of women's
office when Killefcr approached Miss
Alice I. Bodle, dean's assistant. Ac
cepting an invitation to be patrons
this evening are Mr. and Mrs. Ernst
Giesecke of the German department.
No Showers
At a meeting of Cardinals Wed
nesday, it was decided to ban cut
ting-in at Niterics, as these are in
no way supposed to replace jolly
ups.
Manager Al Masters reiterated
approval of the Nitery on behalf of
the B.A.C. and certified the use of
the golf course country club, which
was not made available for dancing
two weeks ago. "However," he said,
"there is this reservation: Nightery
guests may not make use of the
showers."
