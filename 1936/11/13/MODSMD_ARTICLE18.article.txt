# Meagner Crowd Sends Team Off From S.P. Depot
## 
### 
A meager crowd of 150 students
formed at the Paly Espee station
yesterday afternoon for n rather un
inspiring send-off rally for Tiny
Thornhill's gridiron warrious who
entrained for their battle with Ore
yon State Beavers.
The band had marching practice
yesterday afternoon, so there wasn't
any noiye of a musical nature. Tiny
forgot his underwear; Bobby Gray
son and Jimmy Coffis wandered oil.
so the speakers' ranks were sadly
depleted.
Claude Callaway, giant blond
tackle, in speaking of the game
wouldn't predict a win, hut stated,
"The boys wilt play like a real Stan
ford team."
Jim Reynolds, filling in. climbed
aboard the? baggage wagon platform,
raying, "Every member of the stu
dent body should be mighty proud
of the team for the fine games they
have given us this season. We should
all praise Tiny Thornhill for the
marvelous work he has done."
Webb Jones and his two assistants,
Jim Ransohoft and Nelson Wheeler,
led the crowd in veils.
