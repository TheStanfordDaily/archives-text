# Aerial Show Promised By Oregon State
## Determined Cards Leave For Portland in Fine Spirits; Tiny Confident 
### 
Today is not July 3, but there's go
ing to be plenty of aerial fireworks
tomorrow.
At least, that's the way the Beav
ers and the Indians look at the situa
tion. For last night, whi'.e J4 Farm
delegates, hand - picked by Tiny
Thornhill for tomorrow's giidiron
meeting in Portland, sped northward,
there came indications of increased
passing activity in Corvallis.
O.S.C. Ready
In .1 snappy practice session yes
lerday, Coach Lon Stiner of Oregon
State continued to work his men on
ozone antics, and devoted 110 little
time to the setting ut> of various de
fensive formations to stop the Indian
air raid. On Wednesday, the Beav
ers go< their first taste of what to
expect from the Indians when year
ling reserves opened J!re on them
with Redskin offensive tacli ns in
terpreted by Jim Dixon, line mentor,
who scouted last week's game o i the
Farm.
The backfield was tossing the
pork-hide high into the Corvallis at
mosphere, but the passes stili could
n t touch Mr. Dixon, who is way up
in the air over Stanford' : ability.
f>;\i»n Fears Passes
"Talk about your wide-open foot
ball," muttc.ed Jim, "this redshut
ed ball club takes tho cake. Those
backs pass the ball from one end of
thy field to the other, and, what's
more, they pet away with H con
sistently."
J'.e "Gray Ghost'' Gray and John
ny "Jackrabb t" Alexander, ihe 'al
ter a pint-si-.ed sophomore, will w: y
probably alternate in tossing the ball
fmm the left half k;y bcrtn in ;>>e
Beaver backfield. This n-ts been in
dicated in workouts during the past
lew days, us has the that !hc
receiving en j will bo taken care of
by Tommy Swanson, ace right half,
and two sophomore ends, Don Coons
iind Joe Wendlick.
End Out of Game
Notwithstanding earlier reports
that the Beavers stand uninjured,
Dale Lillebo, veteran right end, will
definitely be on the sidelines tomor
row. Lillebo was severely injured in
the U.C.LA. fray and may be out for
the season.
The Thornhill men, however, are
still hale and hearty. Now ranking
on a par with Washington, as far as
moral victories are concerned, the
Indies were looking forward to- to
morrow's festivities with optimism
when they entrained yesterday
afternoon.
Dana Upholds Tiny
During yesterday's brief but in
tensive drill Tiny revealed the fact
that he would continue to use the
running play in which one of the
backs touches the ball to tlje ground.
It was this play that invoked a dead
ball ruling on the part of Referee
Tom Louttit last Saturday.
Since that time, however, Herb
Dana, league commissioner, has up
held Tiny's contention that there is
nothing in the rules bo<ok to justify
a penalty in this particular case.
Brigham Gets. Test
Big Jake Brigham has been doing
plenty of punting during the week
and he has been looking consistently
good. His prowess should do much
for the Stanford cause, but he will
be facing one of the Coast's best in
Elmer Kolberg, Betiver full. If the
passing begins to click for either
squad, Brigham and Kolberg may
both come in for plenty of action,
and a punting duel is not too re
mote a possibility.
The Cardinals will work out in
Portland this afternoon. Tentative
starting line-ups includb:
Coons LER Stone
Miller LTR Callaway
Ramsey LGR Matthews
Deming C Tsoutsouvas
Strack (C) RGL Ferko
Watts RTL Zagar
Wendlick REL Clark
Duncan Q Hoos

Today is not July 3, but there's go
ing to be plenty of aerial fireworks
tomorrow.
At least, that's the way the Beav
ers and the Indians look at the situa
tion. For last night, whi'.e J4 Farm
delegates, hand - picked by Tiny
Thornhill for tomorrow's giidiron
meeting in Portland, sped northward,
there came indications of increased
passing activity in Corvallis.
O.S.C. Ready
In .1 snappy practice session yes
lerday, Coach Lon Stiner of Oregon
State continued to work his men on
ozone antics, and devoted 110 little
time to the setting ut> of various de
fensive formations to stop the Indian
air raid. On Wednesday, the Beav
ers go< their first taste of what to
expect from the Indians when year
ling reserves opened J!re on them
with Redskin offensive tacli ns in
terpreted by Jim Dixon, line mentor,
who scouted last week's game o i the
Farm.
The backfield was tossing the
pork-hide high into the Corvallis at
mosphere, but the passes stili could
n t touch Mr. Dixon, who is way up
in the air over Stanford' : ability.
f>;\i»n Fears Passes
"Talk about your wide-open foot
ball," muttc.ed Jim, "this redshut
ed ball club takes tho cake. Those
backs pass the ball from one end of
thy field to the other, and, what's
more, they pet away with H con
sistently."
J'.e "Gray Ghost'' Gray and John
ny "Jackrabb t" Alexander, ihe 'al
ter a pint-si-.ed sophomore, will w: y
probably alternate in tossing the ball
fmm the left half k;y bcrtn in ;>>e
Beaver backfield. This n-ts been in
dicated in workouts during the past
lew days, us has the that !hc
receiving en j will bo taken care of
by Tommy Swanson, ace right half,
and two sophomore ends, Don Coons
iind Joe Wendlick.
End Out of Game
Notwithstanding earlier reports
that the Beavers stand uninjured,
Dale Lillebo, veteran right end, will
definitely be on the sidelines tomor
row. Lillebo was severely injured in
the U.C.LA. fray and may be out for
the season.
The Thornhill men, however, are
still hale and hearty. Now ranking
on a par with Washington, as far as
moral victories are concerned, the
Indies were looking forward to- to
morrow's festivities with optimism
when they entrained yesterday
afternoon.
Dana Upholds Tiny
During yesterday's brief but in
tensive drill Tiny revealed the fact
that he would continue to use the
running play in which one of the
backs touches the ball to tlje ground.
It was this play that invoked a dead
ball ruling on the part of Referee
Tom Louttit last Saturday.
Since that time, however, Herb
Dana, league commissioner, has up
held Tiny's contention that there is
nothing in the rules bo<ok to justify
a penalty in this particular case.
Brigham Gets. Test
Big Jake Brigham has been doing
plenty of punting during the week
and he has been looking consistently
good. His prowess should do much
for the Stanford cause, but he will
be facing one of the Coast's best in
Elmer Kolberg, Betiver full. If the
passing begins to click for either
squad, Brigham and Kolberg may
both come in for plenty of action,
and a punting duel is not too re
mote a possibility.
The Cardinals will work out in
Portland this afternoon. Tentative
starting line-ups includb:
Coons LER Stone
Miller LTR Callaway
Ramsey LGR Matthews
Deming C Tsoutsouvas
