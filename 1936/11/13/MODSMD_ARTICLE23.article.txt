# Varsity Debaters Meet C.O.P. Team
## 
### 
Ed Lindblom and Gerald Marcus
representing the Stanford varsity
debate team, met the College of the
Pacific forensic team in a heated de
bate in the Women's Clubhouse- yes
terday at 1:15. The question was,
"Resolved, th;>t Congress should be
empowered to regulate maximum
hours and minimum wages for in
dustry." The debate was non-deci
sion.
Although the debate finally re
solved itself into a discussion of eco
nomics, the negative team of the Col
lege of the Pacific established that
any increase in wages or decrease
in hours by law would tend to raise
the cost of production and concomi
tantly prices, which would be detri
mental rather than helpful to labor.
Lindblom and Marcus proved that
the establishment of increasing
wages would increase the power to
purchase, and tend to lessen the pos
sibility of depression. Also this in
crease would be absorbed by reduc
tion in profits rather than by in
creased prices.
