# A 						Well-Heeled Fire

### 

SMOKE-EATERS from Palo Alto and surrounding cities are
shown in the middle of their four-hour vigil at Thoits' Shoe Store,
174 University Avenue, Wednesday night, waiting for the fire to
sneak to sidewalk level through a vent so they could light it. The
cost, $40,000.
