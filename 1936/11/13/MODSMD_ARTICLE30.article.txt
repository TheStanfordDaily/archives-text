# Thoits Fire Rated Worst In History of Palo Alto
## Three Firemen Injured In Costly Blaze 
### 
E. C. Thoits, shoe merchant, today
viewed the wreckage of Palo Alto's j
worst fire and announced plans to i
repair the damage, which revised j
estimates set at $40,000.
Three firemen were injured only
slightly during the three hours they
fought the blaze last night. Worst
casualty was Fred Fletcher, who was
sent to Palo Alto Hospital with bums
received from a blast that caught
him as he attempted to descend to
the basement of the building. He
was able, however, to rejoin the force
later in the night.
Three Departments â€¢
Equipment and men from three
fire departments, Palo Alto, Stanford,
Redwood City, were called on to
help subclue the blaze. In addition
six members of the Menlo depart
ment were on the scene.
Fire Chief William Clemo of Palo
Alto called the fire the worst in the
history of the city, placing it above
another that destroyed the Larkin
Block four years ago. Although men
and equipment ai rived a few min
utes after 7 o'clock, the fire was not
brought under control until after
10, and it was lour in the morning
before the crew had cleaned up,
drained \9ater out of the building
basement, and gone home.
Completely Covered
Of the $40,000 damage, $10,000
was to the building and $30,000 to
stock and fixtures. Insurance cov
ered the whole amount, according to
Thoits. Offices of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company above the
store were not damaged.
Thoits' store occupied the wrecked
building since it was built in 1913,
and another on the same site for 13
years previous to that date.
