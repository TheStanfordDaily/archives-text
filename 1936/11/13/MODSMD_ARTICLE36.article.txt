The celebration will be climaxed

of the committee in charge of the
honors for Erasmus.
"Erasmus was the leading human
ist of his time on the whole conti
nent of Europe," said Dr. Hulme, in
describing him, "and humanism is
an interest in fellow human beings,
a realization of the conditions of this
world in which we have to live, and
a desire to make life better for
ourselves and our fellow men.
"Petrarch was the first great hu
manist; and Erasmus was the la:Â»t
great one of the period we call the
Renaissance. Erasmus, through his
writings, nearly all of which are well
worth reading today, influenced
thought in all the western countries
of Europe. In doing this, he won
for himself a leadership and a lasting
place in history; and surely he is a
man about whom we. of today, ought
to know something."
