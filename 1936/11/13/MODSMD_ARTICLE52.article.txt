# Polo Men Meet Presidio Today
## Squad Strengthened By Reorganized Line-up 
### 
A remodeled Stanford polo team
will ride onto the highway field at
three o'clock this afternoon to play
the Presidio of Monterey.
Lt. Ed McKeon, a varsity letter
man here last year, now on active
duty, will play back for the invaders.
Ahead of him will be Captain Ken
dall at number one, Captain Billings
ley at two, and Captain Ridge in the
three position. Mr. Dick Collins will
be the fifth member of the team.
Captain Haydon Grubbs, Stanford
polo mentor, has been trying various
changes in the lineup during the past
week, in order to find his strongest
possible combination.
Today's games will see the red
team start with Bert MacClintock, a
player who has rapidly developed
into a fine stick man, taking the
back position which team captain
Bob Fullerton has been playing for
three years. Moving Fullerton up to
number three is expected to greatly
strengthen the team's offensive drive.
Lon Derby and Rammy Rasmussen
have been interchanged. Rasmussen
will play number two, while Derby
will be at the front of the game.
In practice, this team worked very
effectively against a strong second
string, and this afternoon's game
with the army post should prove a
good one.
