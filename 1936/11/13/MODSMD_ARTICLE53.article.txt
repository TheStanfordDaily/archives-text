# English Club Asks For Puppeteers
## 
### 
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" has
been chosen by the English Club as
the play for their puppet show next
quarter. President Margaret ' Wil
liams made an announcement yes
terday that quite a few people were
needed to manipulate the puppets
and to say the lines.
Experience is not necessary as in
struction will be given. Rehearsals
will not start until next quarter but
the English Club must know how
many people are interested so they
can go ahead with the plans. Any
one who is interested or who wishes
to find out more about- the show
should ring up either Elizabeth or
Frances Ferry at Lagunita before
next Monday.
