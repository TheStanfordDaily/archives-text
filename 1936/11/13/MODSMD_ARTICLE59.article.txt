# Plans Announced For Frosh Nine
## 
### 
Frosh gridders are reminded that
now that football season is over,
Harry Wolter is sounding a call for
all interested in forming the 1937
freshman baseball team.
For the remainder of this quarter,
practice will continue in conjunction
with the varsity on the Sunken Dia
mond three days a week. Next quar
ter Coaches J-.awson and Grayson
will take over the reins on a five-day
practice program.
All frosh, however, are urged to
turn out now to get the benefit of
Coach Wolter's professional expe
rience. Pitchers and catchers are
especially needed, since the sched
ule calls for at least two games a
week during the season.
