LEST WE
FORGET—
There is no reason why we should
go merrily on our way and forget
Ihat there is a football game going
on tomorrow.
That's always bean the trouble —
people are preparing for the Big
Game and Big Game Night more
than a week ahead of time, and the
last game before the tumult is often
neglected in the rush.
Usually we have a breather in
there—Montana or the Olympic Club
or an open date, but this time, with
the new play-one-play-all schedules,
they give us Lon Sinter's Oregon
State Beavers.
Lon Stiner's Oregon State Beavers
have lost to U.S.C. 38-7, to California
7-0, to Washington 19-7, to U.C.L.A.
22-13, and have beaten Willamette
13-0, Montana 14-7, and Washington
State IG-6.
Don't begin to yell what sissies
they are, because we've lost three
ourselves, haven't won as many as
they have, and we're no sissies.
Harry Shipkey did the scouting
this time—two games ago when the
Beavers were playing U.C.L.A. down
in Los Angeles. Since then the
Beavers played their best against
Washington State. And the game this
Saturday will be played on that
earthen field in Multnomah stadium.
And it may rain, and everyone is
thinking of the Big Game and Big
Game Night.
Do you get it? Everybody, please,
just before you hit the hay tonight,
two minutes of silent reverence for
the outcome up there tomorrow.
EVER SEE A
SOCCER GAME?
Some day, when you're awfully
low, go out and watch Harry Ma
loney's soccer team play.
Soccer is one of the forgotten
sports around Stanford (except may
be up at the Beta house). Nobody
ever watches them play, and even
though their wins and losses are re
corded by the newspapers, the soc
cer boys are a forlorn crew. When
on the quad you see a Circle S man
who is unfamiliar, you say, "Aw, it
must be soccer."
Strangely, though, the boys have a
good game there. It's not the general
free-for-all kicking and scuffing
match that we used to know in
grammar school, but a very orderly
thing, with definite team plays and
plenty of opportunities for individual
luminaries. And sometimes the game
gets so exciting you can't sit down.
No, there's been a slip-up some
where, in that more people don't
watch it. If a field could be laid out
for a preliminary to a big grid game,
attendance would climb a notch, or I
miss my guess.
For those people who hibernate
from year to year between basket
ball seasons, your day has come.

the greatest potenially ever to repre

they have, and we're no sissies.
Harry Shipkey did the scouting
this time—two games ago when the
Beavers were playing U.C.L.A. down
in Los Angeles. Since then the
Beavers played their best against
Washington State. And the game this
Saturday will be played on that
earthen field in Multnomah stadium.
And it may rain, and everyone is
thinking of the Big Game and Big
Game Night.
Do you get it? Everybody, please,
just before you hit the hay tonight,
two minutes of silent reverence for
the outcome up there tomorrow.
EVER SEE A
SOCCER GAME?
Some day, when you're awfully
low, go out and watch Harry Ma
loney's soccer team play.
Soccer is one of the forgotten
sports around Stanford (except may
be up at the Beta house). Nobody
ever watches them play, and even
though their wins and losses are re
corded by the newspapers, the soc
cer boys are a forlorn crew. When
on the quad you see a Circle S man
who is unfamiliar, you say, "Aw, it
must be soccer."
Strangely, though, the boys have a
good game there. It's not the general
free-for-all kicking and scuffing
match that we used to know in
grammar school, but a very orderly
thing, with definite team plays and
plenty of opportunities for individual
luminaries. And sometimes the game
gets so exciting you can't sit down.
No, there's been a slip-up some
where, in that more people don't
watch it. If a field could be laid out
for a preliminary to a big grid game,
attendance would climb a notch, or I
miss my guess.
For those people who hibernate
from year to year between basket
ball seasons, your day has come.
John Bunn's crew, supposed to be
the greatest potenially ever to repre

long and eventful 1937 career this
LEST WE
FORGET—
There is no reason why we should
go merrily on our way and forget
Ihat there is a football game going
on tomorrow.
That's always bean the trouble —
people are preparing for the Big
Game and Big Game Night more
than a week ahead of time, and the
last game before the tumult is often
neglected in the rush.
Usually we have a breather in
there—Montana or the Olympic Club
or an open date, but this time, with
the new play-one-play-all schedules,
they give us Lon Sinter's Oregon
State Beavers.
Lon Stiner's Oregon State Beavers
have lost to U.S.C. 38-7, to California
7-0, to Washington 19-7, to U.C.L.A.
22-13, and have beaten Willamette
13-0, Montana 14-7, and Washington
State IG-6.
Don't begin to yell what sissies
they are, because we've lost three
ourselves, haven't won as many as
they have, and we're no sissies.
