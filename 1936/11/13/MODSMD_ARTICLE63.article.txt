# Grays, Cal Ramblers Clash Tomorrow
## Coach Hunt's Grid Reserves Ready For Battle with Cal Goofs Memorial Stadium Game Season's Only Reward For Varsity's Stooges 
### 
Coach Husky Hunt's Grays, the
fellows that really play football for
no other reason than that they love
the game, get their one chance dur
ing the season for some fun tomor
row when they take on the Califor
nia Ramblers in the Memorial Sta
dium as a preliminary to the Bear-
Oregon game, starting at 11:45 a.m.
Composed of ineligibles and the
fellows that couldn't quite make the
varsity under Tiny Thornhill, this
team is one that really has fire, spirit,
and enough nerve to keep coming
out to play ball when it knows that
there isn't a chance to get any pub
licity for what it does.
To Prove Rep
The "Laughing Boys" built up
quite a rep with their nonchalance
and this-is-lots-of-fun attitude, but
they were out in front of the eyes
of all the newshawks for pro papers
that thought that was swell copy.
The Grays have to stay in their own
backyard, over in front of hte var
sity field, where nobody ever sees
them. But that doesn't stop them
from giving out for Husky, even
when all they get out of it is a lot of
bruises and fun.
At that, Husky Hunt isn't around
for half the season, scouting future
opponents for the varsity. He saw
the Washington game Saturday, the
first Stanford game he has seen this
season. But the Grays are always
around, trying their best to make the
first-stringers look silly in front of
Tiny so that maybe they will be
promoted to the varsity.
Efforts Rewarded
For their efforts all this season in
acting like Santa Clara players, or
Oregon players, or U.C.L.A. players,
or Washington players, so that the
varsity could develop some sort of
defense that would fit their com
ing opponents' offense, the following
men will start against the Ramblers
tomorrow:
Ends, Walron and Bowers; tac
kles, Sinclair and Neckley; guards,
Ellis and Cohn; center, Haffner;
quarter, Blase; halfbacks, McGuire
and Doner; and fullback. Jordan.
Some of the other men that will
undoubtedly play, according to Hunt,
are Dakan and Cummings, ends;
Carnahan, tackle; Gustafson and
Drace, guards; Mecia, center; Ca
revv and Fay. halves; Alustiza, quar
ter; and Sjostrom, full.

Coach Husky Hunt's Grays, the
fellows that really play football for
no other reason than that they love
the game, get their one chance dur
ing the season for some fun tomor
row when they take on the Califor
nia Ramblers in the Memorial Sta
dium as a preliminary to the Bear-
Oregon game, starting at 11:45 a.m.
Composed of ineligibles and the
fellows that couldn't quite make the
varsity under Tiny Thornhill, this
team is one that really has fire, spirit,
and enough nerve to keep coming
out to play ball when it knows that
there isn't a chance to get any pub
licity for what it does.
To Prove Rep
The "Laughing Boys" built up
quite a rep with their nonchalance
and this-is-lots-of-fun attitude, but
they were out in front of the eyes
of all the newshawks for pro papers
that thought that was swell copy.
The Grays have to stay in their own
backyard, over in front of hte var
sity field, where nobody ever sees
them. But that doesn't stop them
from giving out for Husky, even
when all they get out of it is a lot of
bruises and fun.
At that, Husky Hunt isn't around
for half the season, scouting future
opponents for the varsity. He saw
the Washington game Saturday, the
first Stanford game he has seen this
season. But the Grays are always
around, trying their best to make the
first-stringers look silly in front of
Tiny so that maybe they will be
promoted to the varsity.
Efforts Rewarded
For their efforts all this season in
acting like Santa Clara players, or
Oregon players, or U.C.L.A. players,
or Washington players, so that the
varsity could develop some sort of
defense that would fit their com
ing opponents' offense, the following
men will start against the Ramblers
tomorrow:
Ends, Walron and Bowers; tac
kles, Sinclair and Neckley; guards,
Ellis and Cohn; center, Haffner;
quarter, Blase; halfbacks, McGuire
and Doner; and fullback. Jordan.
Some of the other men that will
undoubtedly play, according to Hunt,
are Dakan and Cummings, ends;
Carnahan, tackle; Gustafson and
Drace, guards; Mecia, center; Ca
revv and Fay. halves; Alustiza, quar
ter; and Sjostrom, full.
