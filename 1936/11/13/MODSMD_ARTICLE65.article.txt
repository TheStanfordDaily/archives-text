## Cards Five-year Victors In Traditional Battle To Be Played Here at 10 
### 
The University of California Bear
will make his first play for this year's
top hand in the long California-
Stanford athletic l'eud when the
strong Berkeley soccer eleven meets
a determined Stanford squad on the
Farm tielcl tomorrow morning.
Two games, both starting at 10
o'clock, are on the schedule. The
varsity teams will play on the main
field while the frosh units have ar
ranged to use a converted fresh
man football field to settle their dis
pute.
In spite of an erratic season record,
Harry Maloney's Cards still have a
chance at the league title, but will
have to trip Cal on two successive
Saturdays if they are really pennant
hungry. The veteran Bears are at
present the conference leaders and
are defending the 1935 co-champion
ship which they share with the Uni
versity of San Francisco.
Hal! to Start
In the inter-school competition,
Stanford is in permanent possession
of the Silva Pellas trophy awarded
in 1933 lor five years' ascendancy.
In quest of the new Weaver-White
cup, however, the invaders have a
nice lead with the two victories they
scored last ypar.
Norton at inside right, Musante at
center forward, and O'Donnell at
lullback are the key men in the Cali
fornia lineup. Musanet, who starred
at San Mateo last year, is particu
larly dangerous. The Stanford team
is headed by its brilliant all-confer
ence ace, Bob Hall at center half.
Paul Helms will start in the net, but
the up and coming Louie Faulb may
enjoy considerable action.
Remaining Lineup
Dick Hanna and Wayne Richard
son are at full, George Hatch and
Dave Sloane at halves, Carl Schaupp
and Dave Parker on the wings, and
A1 Dibble and George Chalmers on
the inside front line along with
Harry Lowe. In practice recently,
the attack has been smoothing out
nicely, with Schaupp's centering be
ing notably neat.
Wednesday night, the yearling
eleven elected Ed Gudewell, center
forward, and Bill Hamilton, right
back, as co-captains for the two
important California games. The
fresh whipped Menlo Junior College
in their last start and are in good
shape for another victory try to
morrow. Last season. California and
Stanford split two games in fresh
man soccer.

is headed by its brilliant all-confer
ence ace, Bob Hall at center half.
Paul Helms will start in the net, but
the up and coming Louie Faulb may
enjoy considerable action.
Remaining Lineup
Dick Hanna and Wayne Richard
son are at full, George Hatch and
Dave Sloane at halves, Carl Schaupp
and Dave Parker on the wings, and
A1 Dibble and George Chalmers on
the inside front line along with
Harry Lowe. In practice recently,
the attack has been smoothing out
nicely, with Schaupp's centering be
ing notably neat.
Wednesday night, the yearling
eleven elected Ed Gudewell, center
forward, and Bill Hamilton, right
back, as co-captains for the two
important California games. The
fresh whipped Menlo Junior College
in their last start and are in good
shape for another victory try to
morrow. Last season. California and
Stanford split two games in fresh
man soccer.
The University of California Bear
will make his first play for this year's
top hand in the long California-
Stanford athletic l'eud when the
strong Berkeley soccer eleven meets
a determined Stanford squad on the
Farm tielcl tomorrow morning.
Two games, both starting at 10
o'clock, are on the schedule. The
varsity teams will play on the main
field while the frosh units have ar
ranged to use a converted fresh
man football field to settle their dis
pute.
In spite of an erratic season record,
Harry Maloney's Cards still have a
chance at the league title, but will
have to trip Cal on two successive
Saturdays if they are really pennant
hungry. The veteran Bears are at
present the conference leaders and
are defending the 1935 co-champion
ship which they share with the Uni
versity of San Francisco.
Hal! to Start
In the inter-school competition,
Stanford is in permanent possession
of the Silva Pellas trophy awarded
in 1933 lor five years' ascendancy.
In quest of the new Weaver-White
cup, however, the invaders have a
nice lead with the two victories they
scored last ypar.
Norton at inside right, Musante at
center forward, and O'Donnell at
lullback are the key men in the Cali
fornia lineup. Musanet, who starred
at San Mateo last year, is particu
larly dangerous. The Stanford team
is headed by its brilliant all-confer
ence ace, Bob Hall at center half.
Paul Helms will start in the net, but
the up and coming Louie Faulb may
