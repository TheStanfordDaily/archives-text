ketball team takes on Ihe fust edi- |
tion of a Wytze Gorter-coached |

two outfits will look like during the
season.
Not figured to have even a ghost !
of a show against the team that won j
the Coast conference championship
last year and is pointing toward a
; repeat this year, the frosh will put !
J out what looks to Goiter to be a i
I pretty fair team in an attempt to j
j halt the varsity tide.

Tom Seibert, six-foot, five-inch
center who packs enough weight to j
be the biggest eager ever to come |
i out for the sport on the Farm, will
j head the delegation. Lev/ Staehle
; and Tom Lyon, a pair of teammates
| from Piedmont High last year, 4 will
j hold down the forward spots. Bob

| Washington, have been named by
j Gorter as the starting guards.

I Culderwood, who have both been
j named All-Coasters, will be Bunn's j

is no better basketball player on the !

tennis-playing Les and the tallest
man on the varsity, will start at cen

Short Subjects
This game will be the headliner, to
begin at 4 o'clock. A preliminary
between two other frosh and varsity
teams will take place between three
and four, while another supple
mentary attraction will lie played
after the main game. Lineups for

these two games are still indefinite.
All tilts will be the regular length,
two twenty-minute halves, with in
termissions resting on the time limit.
Students are urged by both coaches
to come out and tike a gander at
what will uphold Stanford's hoop
glory this season â€”there's no ad
mission charge.
