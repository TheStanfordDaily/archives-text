The idea of an "every-Nightery" didn't seem
to catch on with the Administration officials.
Why not?
For one thing, they weren't willing to bet the
Libe against the Nightery, and for another they
were afraid of what people would think.
I'm inclined to reason, though, that the officials
really have a good thing in the Library. They
tell me that it was built to last 50 years, and that
was only 15 years or so ago. The Golf Club
house may have been built for a long time too,
but it doesn't have nearly the books that the
Libe has. That may or may not be due to the
fact that Professor Hulme doesn't give his books
to the Clubhouse.
Of course, what mothers and fathers would
think is another matter. Some mothers and
lathers I know thing their sons and daughters
spend too much time on The Daily. I suppose
that mothers and fathers haven't heard of high
way hosteleries so they wouldn't know about
that. But The Daily really drav/s a good crowd
on week-nights and we don't lose a good copy
editor to either the Libe or the highway more
than once a month. Students spend a lot of
time on The Daily. I don't know why. It's a lot
of work, and every once in a while they learn
something, but they never seem to regret it.
What with the distance away from the campus,
the Golf Clubhouse wouldn't have the appeal
of a place to drop in casually and dance after
a weary time of pounding the books in the
Libe, and what with the activities of Big Game
week approaching, it would have had some
tough competition for students' time with the
Library, Bonfire, Rally, Gaieties rehearsals, and
what not. The Administration really did the
boys a service in clamping down on the every-
Nighlery idea for next week.
However, nobody is answering the fact re
vealed in last Monday's Tabby, that under the
optimum conditions of last week-end only one
fifth of Stanford's men went out on dates. Stan
ford shouldn't be a monastery, it should be a
place where Stanford women can get husbands.
Whose fault will it be, when twenty years from
now Stanford engineers and doctors won't have
somebody to bring their slippers to them in
front of the fire, and there won't be any kiddies
to flunk entrance exes to Stanford? Whose
fault will it be, citizens?
Stanford is not, as Mr. Hearst would put it, a
breeding ground for Communists. Stanford
isn't a breeding ground for anything. Race
suicide is what js going on at Staniord, Mr.
Hearst.

Why not?
For one thing, they weren't willing to bet the
Libe against the Nightery, and for another they
were afraid of what people would think.
I'm inclined to reason, though, that the officials
really have a good thing in the Library. They
tell me that it was built to last 50 years, and that
was only 15 years or so ago. The Golf Club
house may have been built for a long time too,
but it doesn't have nearly the books that the
Libe has. That may or may not be due to the
fact that Professor Hulme doesn't give his books
to the Clubhouse.
Of course, what mothers and fathers would
think is another matter. Some mothers and
lathers I know thing their sons and daughters
spend too much time on The Daily. I suppose
that mothers and fathers haven't heard of high
way hosteleries so they wouldn't know about
that. But The Daily really drav/s a good crowd
on week-nights and we don't lose a good copy
editor to either the Libe or the highway more
than once a month. Students spend a lot of
time on The Daily. I don't know why. It's a lot
of work, and every once in a while they learn
something, but they never seem to regret it.
What with the distance away from the campus,
the Golf Clubhouse wouldn't have the appeal
of a place to drop in casually and dance after
a weary time of pounding the books in the
Libe, and what with the activities of Big Game
week approaching, it would have had some
tough competition for students' time with the
Library, Bonfire, Rally, Gaieties rehearsals, and
what not. The Administration really did the
boys a service in clamping down on the every-
Nighlery idea for next week.
However, nobody is answering the fact re
vealed in last Monday's Tabby, that under the
optimum conditions of last week-end only one
fifth of Stanford's men went out on dates. Stan
ford shouldn't be a monastery, it should be a
place where Stanford women can get husbands.
Whose fault will it be, when twenty years from
now Stanford engineers and doctors won't have
somebody to bring their slippers to them in
front of the fire, and there won't be any kiddies
to flunk entrance exes to Stanford? Whose
fault will it be, citizens?
Stanford is not, as Mr. Hearst would put it, a
breeding ground for Communists. Stanford
isn't a breeding ground for anything. Race
suicide is what js going on at Staniord, Mr.
Hearst.
The idea of an "every-Nightery" didn't seem
to catch on with the Administration officials.
