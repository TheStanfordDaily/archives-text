When Tiny took over the reins here at Stan
ford, he sensed that the student body had lost
interest in the team, and as a result he opened
tip special praclice sessions for the student body
and tried to get as many students as he could
down to watch the v/arriors at work and play.
7 iny has made the effort but the students have
never come.
Alumni scream at Stanford rooting sections
because they do not yell loudly or with enough
enthusiasm. The yell leaders work themselves
into a lather trying futily to v/ind up the stu
dent body. Every once in a while a freshman
will write in a letter to campus opinion expres
sing great surprise that there isn't any "school
spirit" at Stanford.
Yesterday, there were only 150 students
down to the train to see the team off. When the
band memben were asked if they would like
to go down to play, only seven held up their
hands. The band leader then explained, cough,
cough, that two days wasn't enough notification
for the band to play at a rally.
The student bodies of the colleges no longer
have the intolerant attitudes of former years.
The Daily Cal could print "Hate Stanford" in
72 point a couple of years ago, but the fact that
they did it shows that the real hate was dead,
end the era of artificial propaganda stimulants
was ushered in.
The alumni still have that fierce partisanship,
because their loyalty is tied up with their own
personality. They feel that their college's suc
cess upon the gridiron is an indication of its
success as a college, and its success as a college
is an indication of their own success. It's

THEIR college. This is foundation for some of
the student loyalty also, but the student is not
out in the world where he argues toe to toe
with a Cal man across the aisle. After all, there's
nothing so narrow-minded as a Cal man talking
about Stanford.
Now the lack of student enthusiasm isn't the
fault of the coaches, and it isn't the fault of the
newspapers, and it isn't the fault of the Rally
Committee. They try hard. Who is to blame,
in the fact that college students look upon foot
ball as an interesting spectacle, and little more?
Where is the old fierce rivalry, the old emotion,
the do-or-die spirit?
Football has outgrown the students. It got to
be too big an undertaking to let it go along
naturally. It had to be organized. Everything
had to be done efficiently. Smoothness and
polish was required.
Students don t have the feeling anymore that
they have contributed to building up ihe squad.
It s all done for them by somebody else. It's
all organized. Everything works smoothly. The
Rally Committee is pretty efficient. The B.A.C.
is a supercolossus. We buy our tickets at the
right time. We cheer when we are told to.
Printed stickers are put on our windshields.
The coming of the big box office has deadened
the individual s part in it. The result has been
the growth of organization, and the death of
spontaneity. And along with the death of spon
taneity has gone provincialism and intercol
legiate chavinism.

will write in a letter to campus opinion expres
sing great surprise that there isn't any "school
spirit" at Stanford.
Yesterday, there were only 150 students
down to the train to see the team off. When the
band memben were asked if they would like
to go down to play, only seven held up their
hands. The band leader then explained, cough,
cough, that two days wasn't enough notification
for the band to play at a rally.
The student bodies of the colleges no longer
have the intolerant attitudes of former years.
The Daily Cal could print "Hate Stanford" in
72 point a couple of years ago, but the fact that
they did it shows that the real hate was dead,
end the era of artificial propaganda stimulants
was ushered in.
The alumni still have that fierce partisanship,
because their loyalty is tied up with their own
personality. They feel that their college's suc
cess upon the gridiron is an indication of its
success as a college, and its success as a college
is an indication of their own success. It's

THEIR college. This is foundation for some of
the student loyalty also, but the student is not
out in the world where he argues toe to toe
with a Cal man across the aisle. After all, there's
nothing so narrow-minded as a Cal man talking
about Stanford.
Now the lack of student enthusiasm isn't the
fault of the coaches, and it isn't the fault of the
newspapers, and it isn't the fault of the Rally
Committee. They try hard. Who is to blame,
in the fact that college students look upon foot
ball as an interesting spectacle, and little more?
Where is the old fierce rivalry, the old emotion,
the do-or-die spirit?
Football has outgrown the students. It got to
be too big an undertaking to let it go along
naturally. It had to be organized. Everything
had to be done efficiently. Smoothness and
polish was required.
Students don t have the feeling anymore that
they have contributed to building up ihe squad.
It s all done for them by somebody else. It's
all organized. Everything works smoothly. The
Rally Committee is pretty efficient. The B.A.C.
is a supercolossus. We buy our tickets at the
right time. We cheer when we are told to.
Printed stickers are put on our windshields.
The coming of the big box office has deadened
the individual s part in it. The result has been
the growth of organization, and the death of
spontaneity. And along with the death of spon
taneity has gone provincialism and intercol
legiate chavinism.
When Tiny took over the reins here at Stan
ford, he sensed that the student body had lost
interest in the team, and as a result he opened
tip special praclice sessions for the student body
and tried to get as many students as he could
down to watch the v/arriors at work and play.
7 iny has made the effort but the students have
never come.
Alumni scream at Stanford rooting sections
because they do not yell loudly or with enough
enthusiasm. The yell leaders work themselves
into a lather trying futily to v/ind up the stu
dent body. Every once in a while a freshman
will write in a letter to campus opinion expres
sing great surprise that there isn't any "school
spirit" at Stanford.
