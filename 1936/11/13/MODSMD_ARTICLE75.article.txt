MAKE IT A ONCE-A-WEEKERY
That roadside joints are filled with Stanford stu
dents Mondays as well as Saturdays has no bearing on
President Wilbur's disapproval of an every-nitery on
the campus.
He knows and we know there is nothing to keep us
from the social solace of a good drink and an insidious
lounge somewhere off campus. And he knows we will
go to (hem, even as the pinched-souls of Palo Alto go
to Tuesday evening lectures.
But to permit the nitery to run every night would
not only give us a university-certified excuse for not
studying, but would constitute official realization of
the "Stanford is a country club" accusation. Which
wouldn't do, for many reasons other than those imme
diately scholastic.
*> * * *
Through natural bounties, Stanford is eminently a
place not to study in, with or without niteries. Some
how, the University's attempts to create an ascetic
scholasticism with uncomfortable classrooms and seats
conducive to spinal curvature has utterly failed to
overcome a superficial and sophisticated slickness of
atmosphere (with or without mixed metaphors or
whatever we've done).
# * * *
The authorities know this. Almost every time Stan
ford puts up a new building, outsiders lower their
left lip and rasp "just a playground." And that inflicts
pain on more people than Dr. Wilbur. It lowers the
value of a diploma and it inhibits the very necessary
check-writing activities of philanthropists, too many of
whom know Stanford only by its social graces.

Moreover, making the once-a-weekery an every
nitery simply isn't good showmanship. The very val
uable quality of novelty would be lost in probably one
week. And inevitably, an always available loafing place
would tend to draw student loafers and bar-flies,
rather than a representative cross-section of the student
body.
It would make the nitery a divcry. And once it has
reached that status it is a liability rather than an asset
both for the students who help support it, and the
University that sanctions it.
* * * *
And even if superb management averted such a
disastrous slide, many students trying to make a big
splash in the social puddle would either dance their
way into the Rest Homes or out of the University.
* * Si *
At present there arc plenty of places for the bums
to bum and for the splashers to splash. The University
can do nothing about them. But no one can criticize
the attempt to keep campus air fairly clear, the Rest
Homes empty, and the parents contented.
