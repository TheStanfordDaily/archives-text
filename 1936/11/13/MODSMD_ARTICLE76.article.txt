# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Assisting the janitors and the two cleans In making
the campus come clean arc the houseboys up the Row,
who brush ihc dust under the rug every morning,
while you are trying to sleep.
The houseboys can tell by the waste baskets what
Stanford students are thinking. Stanford students can
not tell, though, what houseboys are thinking. This is
partly due to the fact that half of them arc working
for their Ph.D. T.'s. Another reason is that there is
no basis for mutual understanding. The houseboys
cannot keep the room clean; tl c students have a hard
time with their thoughts. When the students .send a
pair of the dirty mental socks to the laundry, they
come back with their mates missing.
Because there is this gulf between the houseboy in
telligentsia and the student boor, the student cannot
comprehend the houseboy and his house.
For instance, there was one student who walked
down Salvatierra to his 8 o'clock every morning, and
on 12 consecutive days he saw 12 different men sweep
ing oIT the sidewalk in front of a house. This quite
amazed him that there would be so many houseboys in
this house, when he knew that the Chi Psi house was
farther up the street.
Somebody told him'later that it was the Chinese
Club.
Every day or so, there is some guy that phones up
every sorority house on the campus, gurgles: "Boogey
boogey" into the phone and hangs up. It is said that
he has been doing it for several weeks in the hopes
that it will get in Our Hasher.
Roble gals seem to get tun out of phoning, too,
though I don't think it's because they want to get in
Our Hasher.
There has been, as some of you know, a clash of
opinion in Roble over the matter of hashers. Hashers
are to Rohlc gals what screen actors are to beauty
parlors. The recent flare-up seems to have settled
down, and a state of amnesty exists. One of the women
hashers at Roble phones up one of the Roble-Phi Delt
squad every morning to wake him up and remind him
to come over and hash. But one day this week she
missed, and one of Roble's coming young politicians
phonod him tip instead Now. the two j'irls won't
speak to each other.

hashers at Roble phones up one of the Roble-Phi Delt
squad every morning to wake him up and remind him
to come over and hash. But one day this week she
missed, and one of Roble's coming young politicians
phonod him tip instead Now. the two j'irls won't
speak to each other.
Assisting the janitors and the two cleans In making
the campus come clean arc the houseboys up the Row,
who brush ihc dust under the rug every morning,
while you are trying to sleep.
The houseboys can tell by the waste baskets what
Stanford students are thinking. Stanford students can
not tell, though, what houseboys are thinking. This is
partly due to the fact that half of them arc working
for their Ph.D. T.'s. Another reason is that there is
no basis for mutual understanding. The houseboys
cannot keep the room clean; tl c students have a hard
time with their thoughts. When the students .send a
pair of the dirty mental socks to the laundry, they
come back with their mates missing.
Because there is this gulf between the houseboy in
telligentsia and the student boor, the student cannot
comprehend the houseboy and his house.
For instance, there was one student who walked
down Salvatierra to his 8 o'clock every morning, and
on 12 consecutive days he saw 12 different men sweep
ing oIT the sidewalk in front of a house. This quite
amazed him that there would be so many houseboys in
this house, when he knew that the Chi Psi house was
farther up the street.
Somebody told him'later that it was the Chinese
Club.
Every day or so, there is some guy that phones up
every sorority house on the campus, gurgles: "Boogey
boogey" into the phone and hangs up. It is said that
he has been doing it for several weeks in the hopes
that it will get in Our Hasher.
Roble gals seem to get tun out of phoning, too,
though I don't think it's because they want to get in
Our Hasher.
There has been, as some of you know, a clash of
opinion in Roble over the matter of hashers. Hashers
are to Rohlc gals what screen actors are to beauty
parlors. The recent flare-up seems to have settled
down, and a state of amnesty exists. One of the women
hashers at Roble phones up one of the Roble-Phi Delt
squad every morning to wake him up and remind him
to come over and hash. But one day this week she
