MORE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S
| The foreign correspondence has
' reached enormous proportions as my
I second out-of-town admirer has
i seen fit to answer me.
i The gentleman in question is Jack
i Clark, who writes a sport column
entitled Skull Practice in the Ala-
I meda Times Star. I quote: "Writing
I under the head 'Sour Gripes,' Curtis
j Prendergast of the Stanford Col
legian (?) staff slaps St. Mary's col
lege around. ... In part, he writes,
I 'The truth is St. Mary's gives great
. favors in the form of free trips with
! the team to sports writers, who will
; boom the team as the shining repre
! sentative of Pacific Coast intercol
legiate football. Yeh, the representa-
I tive of western intercollegiate foot
ball even though a whole lot of peo-
I pie wince when the term 'college' is
I applied to St. Mary's.' . . . What
; Mr. Prendergast neglected to make
| clear is that St. Mary's has one of
| the best teams on the coast."

Before I do the Don Quixote act
and charge the Alameda windmill, I
ought to explain that my slander on
St. Mary's was written on election
; day, early in the afternoon when it
j was too early to do anything more
| than take a lesson from the Bull Ses
sion and step on somebody's fingers.
The fact that my little bit of libel
aroused no howls from this quarter
I shows: (1) People agree with me;
ior (2) Nobody reads this column.
! (Vote for one.)
But from the way Mr. Clark raises
i his voice from the wilderness in de
! fense of St. Mary's pigskin glory, I
! suspect that possibly he is an alum
! nus of St. Mary's. In other words,
I hfc is touchiest on the matter of the
j football team's honor, while he
| completely misses the point about
i the educational facilities at St.
j Mary's. Or maybe he, like Calvin
! Coolidge, chooses to say nothing on
I the subject of St. Mary's scholastic
I standing.

As for the Galloping Gaels, they
i may have a good team. They beat
| California after all these years of
I trying, didn't they? Shucks, they
! only got trounced twice this year. If
they beat Santa Clara, they'll pull
themselves out of the second divi
sion.
I may even change my mind about
I the team. But about St. Mary's as
j an institution of higher learning —
I tell me, Mr. Clark, do they even read
j books over there?
