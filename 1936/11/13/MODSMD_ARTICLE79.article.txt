. Its twelve scenes run off with re
markable ease and smoothness, "IT
CAN'T HAPPEN HERE," now in its
third week at the Columbia Theater
in San Francisco, is indeed a credit
to the WPA theater project and to
the powers-that-be in Washington
who permit and encourage it.
A powerful and convincing por
trayal of what can happen here un
der a dictatorship, the play, taken
from Sinclair Lewis' book, traces the
accession and reign of Senator
"Buzz" Windrip to the presidency
and dictatorship of the United States
at the head of the militaristic Corpo
rative party.
A small New England town is the
setting, with its newspaper editor
representing the remnant of Amer
icans who still regard freedom of

speech and press as the American
prerogative — a prerogative sharply
ended by the rule of the Corpos.
The means of torture and suppres
sion used by the Corpos are strongly
and graphically presented, aided by
highly offcctive sound effects.
John irover, as Shad LeDue,
former hired man who rises to a
high place in the Corpos, turns in a
fine performance. The scene in which
his arrogance is completely subdued
by his cowardice at a rebel air i* id
shows him at the height of his per
formance.
The editor, Doremus Jessup, play
ed by Will Vedder, is well portrayed.
His breakdown at the sudden mur
der of his son-in-law before his eyes
is restrained enough to make it
thoroughly effective.
Unusual and very commendable is
the performance of Master Dion
Chesse, who, despite his not more
than seven years, does not miss a
cue or muff a line. Edwin Mac Do
nald, as a high Corpo official, is a fine
villain of the Basil Rath bone type.

A well selected cast, good sets, and
swift change of scenery all added to
the exceptional smootliness of the
performance.
