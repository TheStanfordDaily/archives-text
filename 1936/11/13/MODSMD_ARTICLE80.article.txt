# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir.
In your editorial of November 10
you mentioned "grades" and "forced
learning."
Although it may be bad manners
to question the methods of a univer
sity that gives us more than we pay
for, I believe your idea deserves the
publicity you seem to have thought
of giving it.
We students who do see the ineffi
ciencies of a system that wastes our
time, money, and effort on red tape
instead of learning, may not be able
to improve the situation directly. We
are not the experts. We are the vic
tims. As such, our function, and
duty, is not one of invention, but one
of complaint and publicity. I can
think of no better stimulant for the
experts than a good united howl un
der the able leadership of our Dippy.
