MULTNOMAH STADIUM, Port
land. Nov. 14.—Gloomy are the Stan
ford chances, three minutes to play,
one point behind Oregon State, and
waiting for the kick-off.
But not for long—Coffis takes the
kick-off, fighting mad, for 34 yards
up to his 47. Calvelli drops back,
way back on his 40, flings a long,
high one.
Sling. Mr. Calvelli
Fifty-five yards it goes in the air
to the 15-yard line, where Stone
gathers it in, and runs to the 5 before
being dropped. In two downs Cal
velli has punched it over, Ed Gar
nier has converted, the scoring is
over—Stanford 20, Oregon State 14.
Thus ended this prize of football
thrillers today, leaving 20,000 mute
spectators to stagger home and con
template just what had transpired
to cause that dishrag feeling.
Kick Blocked
To start the affair, Zagar nnd
Clark gave me the U.C.L.A. play to
block and recover the first Beaver
kick on the Orange 17. But Calvelli's
receivers were covered. And the
Beaver line was tough, so the quar
ter went scoreless.
Not so with the second, though. I

Joe Gray, who was responsible for
most of the O.S.C. yardage through
out the afternoon, broke the ice from
the two-yard line after he had ad
vanced there in seven plays from
the 34, where Coons had recovered
Jake Brigham's fumble.

Stanford came back typically,
11 plays and 66 yards, but with a
punting exchange thrown in. Brig
ham made most of the distance off
tackle from double wings, but pass
ed to Vigna for 13, interference on
Stone for 18, and to Coffis for 12
were invaluable in the drive. Vigna
scored over Ferko and Matthews on
a single wing to the left, and Luck
ett's kick was blocked. 7-6, Oregon
State.
The next one was new and differ
ent, about a minute later. Bob Mat
thews, a pass defender in Tiny's
set-up, intercepted Gray's toss on

the Beaver 45, and with lots of Reds
in front of him lumbered up to the
20, where he lateralled to Tsoutsou
vas. Chooch rolled on down to the
5, and got rid of the ball there.
Coffis picked it up to score; Luckett
converted with Coffis holding, and it
was Stanford 13, O.S.C. 7.

Brigham and Glenn Hamilton ran
things in the third quarter, but got
no closer than the 9-yard line. In
the last quarter, though, Duncan got
a lucky kick to the Stanford 1-yard
line, from where Hamilton kicked
out to the 30. Joe Gray, teiTibly
