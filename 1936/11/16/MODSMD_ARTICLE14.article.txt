# ROBLE TORCH SONG
## 
### 
The water tastes like swimming
pools,
They feed us too much bread,
And when they buzz our buzzer
once
They do it tvvicc instead.
We've run right through our bank
account,
We've run light through our hose.
And where we've put on seven
pounds
The good Lord only knows.
â€”Betty Kline

the Rollins college (Winter Park.
