# BEHIND THAT KICKOFF
## 
### BOB EISENBACH 
AY/HEN Bill Shakespeare said, '"All (he world's a stage," lie was
only kidding. And when he said all the men are merely players,
he was lying.
Take the football world. The men in it aren't players, they're
stagehands. And the real football world isn't a stage, it's an office
where the stagehands work, far from the stadium and the day when
banners fly and cheers split the air.
June and July, not November, is the time when football is
really a going concern. In those sleepy months the Big Game, and
other spectacles like it, are made possible by work that makes a
75-yard run look like a morning walk. It's then that the date is
set (and that's a real job, believe it). It's then that your hot dog
and bottle of pop are arranged for, your ticket printed, and your
parking space reserved. It's then that uncounted things are thought
of, from the loss of your glasses to a fainting spell in the third
quarter, that makes your attendance not only pleasant, but rea
sonably safe.
The Game? It's a mere bagatelle.
And you can take that from Jake Irwin, the B.A.C. official
heading a crew of approximately 1500 stage hands who put up the
scenery ,take it down, get the audience into the house, feed and
water it. and rid of it. ♦

Backstage Boss
In his day and lime, Jake has done
everything from treating faint wom
en to working the score-board, just
?o you can say. "Whyinoll doesn't
Tiny kick" and I can say "Whyinoll
doesn't Tiny pass!"
Right now, he's thinking about the
next Big Game at Palo Alto. He's
been thinking about it ever since the
last car left the Farm last year. And 1
he'll continue to think about it j
through next summer, when the Pa- :
cific Coast Conference will set the
Big Game date with reference to
other aavilable football attractions,
when programs go to press, and
when Jake's young army gets ready
to dish regimentation and hot dogs. I
Set for 1 5 Years
Big Games for the next 15 years]
are as sure as death and taxes. '
guaranteed by a contract signed |
three years ago with Cal. And time's
i wast in' as far as Jake is concerned.
Every time King Football sits on
the Stanford bowl, Jake has to see
hat 40,000 programs more or less are
delivered and paid for. He has to see
that two Red Cross stations, under I
•he roofing sections at both .sides of
•he stadium, have nurses on duty.
That 20 doctors, 30 nurses, and 30
.stretcher bearers, six ambulances
md a fire truck are ready to go—just
n case that bourbon we drink gives
is sunstroke, or a cigarette goes
"oiling under the seat, or a conccs
>ionnaire cuts his hand on a broken
oop lx>tt!e.
On an average, depending on ihe

heat of the day and the excitement
of the game, about (50 people need
medical attention—and get it free.
Lose Your Ticket?
If you lose a ticket, or if you buy
one and the mails butch—well, Jake's
there, too. The B.A.C. maintains a
lost ticket service, with an outside
booth. It insures tickets mailed, and
gives you a duplicate if Uncle Sam
loses them. If YOU lose them, and
a check-up shows that the seats are
still unoccupied on game clay, you
can still get in. Unfortunately, fans
already in your seats can't be evicted
without the risk of a law suit.
And if you lose your wallet dur
ing the game, Jake will help find it.
A lost and found booth is maintained
under his direction. There your wal
let will be, if it's possible to find it.
And if you lose your false teeth,
they'll be there, 100. A toothless
gent tried on three lost sets after
the B.A.C. game, but he didn't find
one that fitted. Biggest haul: $500
worth of jewelry and an hysterical
woman.
Need a Tow?
Maybe your battery will go dead
during the game. If so, you will be
towed out. for a slight fee. Stanford
used to tow gratis, now the C.S.A.A.
has taken it over, and hauls accord
ing to its own rules.
If you're slightly glossy-eyed, Don
Liebendorfer will tell you what hap
pens on the field through a $20,000
public address system. The horns
are over the scoreboard. Don sits it)
a booth on the East rim of the sta

dium. Two men on the field tell him
what happens, and he tells you. That
helps the seatee in (he end zone, but
Don has to have two uniformed cops
to help him. For people are always
rapping on his glass gold-fish bowl
wanting to know what time it is or
whether it's hot inside.
The scoreboard is another aid to
game-comprehension. The boys who
work it are like Henry Ford's famed
efficiency expert, kicking with the
left foot to change yardage, punch
ing with their right arm to change
downs. Two men operate it through
the aid of ropes and pulleys, with a
man on the field to telephone re
sults.
Phone Call?
Phones also give the coaches two
auxiliary eyes. Observers in the
press box describe an airplane view
of the game so Tiny can adapt his
plays to a particular situation. The
press box has 40 direct lines to news
paper offices all over the bay area,
with additional lines from Western
Union, and on Big Game days, sev
eral teletypes that print the stories
in city rooms as stadium reporters
write. I
Twenty thousand hot dogs, all laid
in a row. might reach from here to
there, hut they just start to reach
from spectator hunger to spectator
well-being. Stanford now leases the
food concessions after several unfor
tunate experiences with students,
who can't plan their stock satisfac
torily and are too bashful to be
salesmen. Jake reveals.

The net is approximately $3000 per
year, with the B.A.C. getting a per
centage of the gross. Four wholesale
booths in the stadium bowels supply
250 bustlers, who tour the stands, in
addition to booths at ground level
outside the stadium selling directly
to the public. Long after the last
fan has rolled home, high school
kids from San Francisco are still
checking in their receipts.
Kids do best, says Jake, particu
larly if they're hard boiled city
youngsters who don't care about the
game, only about making money.
They clear approximately $5 each
per game. Only 20 university stu
dents have been successful salesmen,
Jake has found.
Student Cops O.K.
Four hundred fifty men, mostly
students, handle traffic. They take
care of approximately 22,000 autos
per Big Game. As part of a tempo
rarily deputized police force, they
co-operate with 40 state patrolmen.
How it will work out next year, with
the Embarcadero underpass concen
trating 80 per cent of the traffic at
one point, Jake doesn't know, and
he's worried already.
Almost invariably 15 to 20 cars are
left in the parking area by people
who can't find them, or drunks who
think they came down on the train
and decide to return by air. The cars
are turned over to lost and found,
where they are checked for owner
ship—on the following Monday.
Since Jake's regime, no uniformed
Fink', rions have supplemented the

Stanford student ticket takers' hon
esty. '"We work the honor code,"
Jake explains. Furthermore, he has
founct that students are more tactful
than ihe average cop. "We must have
people who realize a football crowd
isn't a gang of strike-breakers." As
a result, there isn't a billy in the
bunch.
Furthermore, a strange policeman
couldn't know that there are 23 dif
ferent legal methods of entering the
stadium. Jake figures that Univer
sity kids can watch the more than
two-score varieties of tickets and
make due distinction between free
gratis admissions, and tax-due comp
limentaries.
—all of which gives Jake grey
1 airs. Right now, he's finished wor
rying about the 1.000.000 pieces of
printed matter that have to be mailed
to possible and probable ticket -
wanters.
But that doesn't take care of the
soda pop for 1937. "And that has to
be arranged," says Jake, "right now."
Student attempts to counteract the
present tendency of Paly theater
managers to raise prices on students
will be co-ordinated in a meeting
this afternoon at 1:30 in the Women's
Clubhouse. Student leaders have
been invited to the gathering, which
is under the auspices of the A.S.U.
A famous millionnairc mentions
that money does not make for hap
piness. Still, it does enable a man to
be miserable in comfort.- Punch.
