Away over left is a man you never
see, but whose work is vital to female
enjoyment of football, lie oper
ates the scoreboard from informa
tion telephoned from the field. Most
of it's done with zinc slides, but an
electric clock 011 the gridiron acti
vates the score board dial, an in
novation. With his assistant, the
pale-faced lad climbs a li9-foot lad
der to reach his perch, and must
stay there, come heat or cold, until
the final gun sounds. Right is the
press box, where the hardest-boiled
guys get softest - hearted over a
touchdown. There's a telegrapher,
ready to flash something, next to him
is a writer, doing a play-by-play and
handing his stufY to the wireman in
"takes."
Below is how you get soda pop.
from two depots maintained way
down in the tunnel. Here "rustlers"
get their stock, which they must pay
for before they collect your dime.
