# KING FOOTBALL AT STANFORD
## 
### LEONARD BLAIKIE 
r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart
ment. because the Men's Council had
failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.
One Paid Organizer
The corps of alumni wlio solicit
athletes is not nearly as unified as
might be supposed. It is made up
mainly of successful business men
who live over their college days by
helping these athletes through col
lege. All the workers are volunteer.
The only one on the campus who
does this sort of work is Harlow
Rothcrt, and his job is alumni secre
tary and his salary comes from the
Alumni Association. Mr. Rothcrt is
| more or less the co-ordinating cen
ter of this amateur, haphazard
alumni activity. None of the Stan
ford coaches do promotional work.
S. C. and Cal coaches have been
known 10. The local coach comes
into the picture when the alumni
bring the athlete to him. Whereupon
I him up. Coaches also are allowed, hv
! conference rule, to write to nnv hicli

being experts themselves," are apt to
be misled by newspaper propaganda.
However, coaches are just as likely
to go wrong, for it is pretty hard to
bet on such a highly unpredictable
thing as football flesh. It is over these
boys who go sour in college ball
that most of the alumni-coach fric
tion develops, since the alumni hate
to sink money on a boy that isn't
making the first string.
Unccntralized
The unknown, unsung valiants
who sequester college athletes are
scattered all over the Coast, but are
scattered sometimes too wildly to
make for an efficient system.
Some of these contact men are
Ralph "Big Jim" Reynolds, from Los
Angeles, who has contributed Jack
Clark, Bob Matthews, Art Stoefen.
Monk Moserip, Bones Hamilton, Alf
Brandin, By West. Grant Stone, and
others; Arnie West of Tacoma,
Washington, has contributed Ed Bur
rows and Pete Zagar; George Baker,
of Santa Ana, Ray Mallot, Bill Haw
kins; Bill Zeimar of Stockton, Alus
tizas big and little, Tony Calvelli.

who got Leo Madlem, and tried
plenty hard for Kirkpatrick.
Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con
stant duns for scholarships, Jake Ir
win. Harry Borba, Bill Leiser, and
Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.
6 basketball men, and 3 baseball men.
At the opening of this quarter the
club paid out $2,875 for tuition L j e>
of 25 athletes, including a good deal
of the present personnel of the Big
Red Machine.
Ten Have Aid
In addition to this fund there are
the regular University Scholarships
and Student Aid all administered by
the local scholarship committee. Re
cipients of all these scholarships are
published either in the Bawlout or
in the Buck of the Month Club pub
lication. C
Ten of the 11 members of the first
string varsity football team are re
cipients of one of the published
scholarships. Four out of five of the
first-string basketball players re
ceive tuition scholarships as well
a majority of the track and field, and
baseball performers.
I find our marriage quite com-»
fortable and happy.—Dick Powell.

r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart
ment. because the Men's Council had
failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.
One Paid Organizer
The corps of alumni wlio solicit
athletes is not nearly as unified as
might be supposed. It is made up
mainly of successful business men
who live over their college days by
helping these athletes through col
lege. All the workers are volunteer.
The only one on the campus who
does this sort of work is Harlow
Rothcrt, and his job is alumni secre
tary and his salary comes from the
Alumni Association. Mr. Rothcrt is
| more or less the co-ordinating cen
ter of this amateur, haphazard
alumni activity. None of the Stan
ford coaches do promotional work.
S. C. and Cal coaches have been
known 10. The local coach comes
into the picture when the alumni
bring the athlete to him. Whereupon
I him up. Coaches also are allowed, hv
! conference rule, to write to nnv hicli

being experts themselves," are apt to
be misled by newspaper propaganda.
However, coaches are just as likely
to go wrong, for it is pretty hard to
bet on such a highly unpredictable
thing as football flesh. It is over these
boys who go sour in college ball
that most of the alumni-coach fric
tion develops, since the alumni hate
to sink money on a boy that isn't
making the first string.
Unccntralized
The unknown, unsung valiants
who sequester college athletes are
scattered all over the Coast, but are
scattered sometimes too wildly to
make for an efficient system.
Some of these contact men are
Ralph "Big Jim" Reynolds, from Los
Angeles, who has contributed Jack
Clark, Bob Matthews, Art Stoefen.

Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con
stant duns for scholarships, Jake Ir
win. Harry Borba, Bill Leiser, and
Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.
6 basketball men, and 3 baseball men.

Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con
stant duns for scholarships, Jake Ir
win. Harry Borba, Bill Leiser, and
Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.
6 basketball men, and 3 baseball men.
At the opening of this quarter the
club paid out $2,875 for tuition L j e>
of 25 athletes, including a good deal
of the present personnel of the Big
Red Machine.
Ten Have Aid
In addition to this fund there are
the regular University Scholarships
and Student Aid all administered by
the local scholarship committee. Re
cipients of all these scholarships are
published either in the Bawlout or
in the Buck of the Month Club pub
lication. C
Ten of the 11 members of the first
string varsity football team are re
cipients of one of the published
scholarships. Four out of five of the
first-string basketball players re
ceive tuition scholarships as well
a majority of the track and field, and
baseball performers.

r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart
ment. because the Men's Council had
failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.
One Paid Organizer
The corps of alumni wlio solicit
athletes is not nearly as unified as
might be supposed. It is made up
mainly of successful business men
who live over their college days by
helping these athletes through col
lege. All the workers are volunteer.
The only one on the campus who
does this sort of work is Harlow
Rothcrt, and his job is alumni secre
tary and his salary comes from the
Alumni Association. Mr. Rothcrt is
| more or less the co-ordinating cen
ter of this amateur, haphazard
alumni activity. None of the Stan
ford coaches do promotional work.
S. C. and Cal coaches have been
known 10. The local coach comes
into the picture when the alumni
bring the athlete to him. Whereupon
I him up. Coaches also are allowed, hv
! conference rule, to write to nnv hicli

being experts themselves," are apt to
be misled by newspaper propaganda.
However, coaches are just as likely
to go wrong, for it is pretty hard to
bet on such a highly unpredictable
thing as football flesh. It is over these
boys who go sour in college ball
that most of the alumni-coach fric
tion develops, since the alumni hate
to sink money on a boy that isn't
making the first string.
Unccntralized
The unknown, unsung valiants
who sequester college athletes are
scattered all over the Coast, but are
scattered sometimes too wildly to
make for an efficient system.
Some of these contact men are
Ralph "Big Jim" Reynolds, from Los
Angeles, who has contributed Jack
Clark, Bob Matthews, Art Stoefen.
Monk Moserip, Bones Hamilton, Alf
Brandin, By West. Grant Stone, and
others; Arnie West of Tacoma,

Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con
stant duns for scholarships, Jake Ir
win. Harry Borba, Bill Leiser, and
Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.
6 basketball men, and 3 baseball men.
At the opening of this quarter the
club paid out $2,875 for tuition L j e>
of 25 athletes, including a good deal
of the present personnel of the Big
Red Machine.
Ten Have Aid
In addition to this fund there are
the regular University Scholarships
and Student Aid all administered by
the local scholarship committee. Re
cipients of all these scholarships are
published either in the Bawlout or
in the Buck of the Month Club pub
lication. C
Ten of the 11 members of the first
string varsity football team are re
cipients of one of the published
scholarships. Four out of five of the
first-string basketball players re
ceive tuition scholarships as well
a majority of the track and field, and
baseball performers.

r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart
ment. because the Men's Council had
failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.
One Paid Organizer
The corps of alumni wlio solicit
athletes is not nearly as unified as
might be supposed. It is made up
mainly of successful business men
who live over their college days by
helping these athletes through col
lege. All the workers are volunteer.
The only one on the campus who
does this sort of work is Harlow
Rothcrt, and his job is alumni secre
tary and his salary comes from the
Alumni Association. Mr. Rothcrt is
| more or less the co-ordinating cen
ter of this amateur, haphazard
alumni activity. None of the Stan
ford coaches do promotional work.
S. C. and Cal coaches have been
known 10. The local coach comes
into the picture when the alumni
bring the athlete to him. Whereupon
I him up. Coaches also are allowed, hv
! conference rule, to write to nnv hicli

being experts themselves," are apt to
be misled by newspaper propaganda.
However, coaches are just as likely
to go wrong, for it is pretty hard to

Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con

win. Harry Borba, Bill Leiser, and
Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.
6 basketball men, and 3 baseball men.
At the opening of this quarter the
club paid out $2,875 for tuition L j e>
of 25 athletes, including a good deal
of the present personnel of the Big
Red Machine.
Ten Have Aid
In addition to this fund there are
the regular University Scholarships
and Student Aid all administered by
the local scholarship committee. Re
cipients of all these scholarships are
published either in the Bawlout or
in the Buck of the Month Club pub
lication. C
Ten of the 11 members of the first
string varsity football team are re

scholarships. Four out of five of the
first-string basketball players re

a majority of the track and field, and
baseball performers.

r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart
ment. because the Men's Council had
failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.

proof and the gossip is usually dis

Common campus scandal of quite
a few years ago concerns an Honor
Code violation. For several years,
the two Councils could get no co
operation in turning in offenders
from the Political Science Depart

failed to boot out several prominent
football players for a violation. It
seems these prominent football play
ers from a prominent house had
broken into the political science of
fice the night before an ex to get the
questions. Caught red-handed, the
players were turned in to the Coun
cil, but the Council did nothing about
it. And the Council has succeeded
only in recent years in living down
this break-up of student enforce
ment machinery of the Honor Code.
The grade-point standing of the
football team is generally lower than
almost all other tabulated groups on
the campus, though last year it was
on approximately the same level as
fraternities.
One Paid Organizer
The corps of alumni wlio solicit
athletes is not nearly as unified as
might be supposed. It is made up
mainly of successful business men
who live over their college days by
helping these athletes through col

The only one on the campus who
does this sort of work is Harlow
Rothcrt, and his job is alumni secre
tary and his salary comes from the
Alumni Association. Mr. Rothcrt is
| more or less the co-ordinating cen
ter of this amateur, haphazard
alumni activity. None of the Stan
ford coaches do promotional work.

However, coaches are just as likely
to go wrong, for it is pretty hard to

thing as football flesh. It is over these
boys who go sour in college ball

Buck a Month
As a means of protection from con

Murray Draper organized what is
known as the "Tiny Buck of the
Month Club," each member contrib
uting at least a dollar a month to
build up a fund to pay for athletic
tuitions, to be administered by lour
major sports coaches. From June 20,
1935, to June 20, 1936, the Buck
kecper, Tom Irwin, Chronicle sports
writer, disbursed $8,086.50 for tuition
to 25 football players, 6 track men.

Ten Have Aid
In addition to this fund there are
the regular University Scholarships

Ten of the 11 members of the first

r T , HE powerful box-office giant — j
football. At Stanford he brings j
in almost $400,000 in a good year. If i
his economic power were unleashed, |
he would carry all in his way, grow
ing stronger, until he takes over the
whole school. These are teams such i
as Texas Christian, which travel for
five or six weeks without ever re
turning home, teams such as St.
Mary's, where football players are j
hardly considered part of the student ]
body.
How does Stanford leash the giant, [
or does she?
Stanford has profited greatly from J
football. There has been nation-wide j
advertising, there have been many
buildings: Branner, Women's Gym,
the Pavilion (with student help), the
B. A. C. Building with its health >
service, and the complete athletic
layout, one of the finest in the world.
Outside Pressure
It is ridiculous to assume that
Stanford teams could maintain their
high quality and box-office appeal
against the others on the Coast with
boys recruited from Stanford class
rooms. With the development of
rigidly organized alumni recruiting
organizations at California and at j
S.C., other schools have had to keep j
pace.
But difficulties have been thrown
in the way of the Stanford alumni in 1
their efforts to employ the best talent
for Stanford teams. In the first place,
the Administration has frowned
strongly on alumni attempts to direct
policy in the B.A.C.
In the second place, the University
is firm in its demand that football
talent must meet scholastic require
ments of ordinary students. Kirk
patrick, fabulous sprinter, went one
year to Montezuma, one year to San
Mateo junior college in his effort to
get grades for Stanford. He couldn't
make it. But S.C. quickly snapped
him up.
Back Down
Both S.C. and Cal have "back
doors" by which students can get in.
Although on paper their require
ments may look the same, S.C. has
its junior college, and Cal has its
extension division.
S.C., through its junior college,
will admit on trial any student re-
Cardlesk of his high school record or
program. They may not go out for
any athletics or activities, but they
go to the same classes and their
grades are turned into a separate
system.
The extension division works
somewhat the same way. The attend
ant outwardly has most of the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in a fraternity house and
his classes are held on the regular
California campus. From these little
breeding grounds, entrance to the
main college is usually easy.
How We Do It
But the solicitor generals of the
Stanford alumni have a hard time.
Most of their likely prospects are not

dumb, but the thought of making
grades to get into college doesn't
come until their last year in high
school.
They have to meet the double dis
advantage of Stanford's high tuition
and high scholastic requirements. As
far as it is known, there is little
financial aid given to Stanford pros
pects, other than the tuition scholar
ships, and the campus and summer

jobs. Though there are a few in
stances of sinecures, most of the ath
letes work for what they get, and
with the time spent in football prac
tice, this is no easy task.
More and more every year, the
alumni scouts are finding fewer and
fewer athletes with enough recs to
get into Stanford their freshman
year. So the policy is now, and will
be more accentuated in the future,

of "farming-out" the athlete in the
junior college.
So the alumni scout makes this ap
peal to the athlete: the very fact
that he can't get into Stanford with
a sloppy record shows that Stanford
means something educationally.
They point out that even if he spends
only three years at Stanford, those
three years will be more profitable
from the standpoint of a good educa
tion than four years elsewhere, that
when he graduates, the ability to say
j he went to Stanford will be a potent
j job-getting factor.
The Sales Talk
Very helpful, also, is Stanford's
attraction as a residence university,
Stanford's strong hall set-up. They
show the athlete that he can live
more cheaply at Stanford, that he
doesn't need to join a fraternity for
social prestige, that if he does join,
he has an opportunity to pick and
j choose his fraternity sinecure from
a list of several by our delayed rush
! ing system. Hashing jobs are fairly
I easy to get.
But even with the jaysee doorstep,
the football player has to make a
good record after he leaves high
school. Fullerton J.C. and S.F.J.C.
are the only two junior colleges
from which any student may trans
fer with a C average. Students from
the rest of the junior colleges must
have a higher average, depending on
how good are the students who
have transferred here before.
Snags on the Farm
After the football player does get
here, he must carry the same courses
as the other students. The only way
that the football players are pam
pered is that they have a scholastic
nursemaid in the Dean of Men's of
fice, known as the assistant to the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
His job is to find out how the foot
ball player's are doing in their class
rooms, and to "jack up" the player if
he is falling behind. But it is one
of the sorrows of this department
that it is impossible to apply pres
sure on professors for raising grades,
so all of the work must be done on
the player himself.
That tutors are used for this pur
pose is campus gossip, but there is no
proof and the gossip is usually dis
credited.
