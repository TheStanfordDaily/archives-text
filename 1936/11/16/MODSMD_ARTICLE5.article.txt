# THE 						PLAYERS' ANGLE

### HERB DIAMOND 
iirkEAß Mr. Tiny Thornhill:
"I want to play football. I
want to go to school. It' you don't
want me, go to Hell.
Respectfully,
"W. G.
"P.S.: And make it snappy."
From Brooklyn to Palo Alto came
this gentle hint. Tiny tells of having
received it; he mentioned it in a
magazine article early this fall, ex
plaining it was only one of hundreds
of fan letters sent to him each year
by self-styled men of destiny.
W. G. is quite evidently one
Brooklynite who goes around being
moved to utter an explosive exple
tive all too easily. He was off-side
before the season got under way.
But whether he knew it or not, a
good 50 per cent of his prolific cor
respondence— that is, the first two
sentences — expresses the sentiment
of every man, present or past, who
has made a bid for a post on an In
dian grid aggregation.
School and Football
A fact it is that every Redskin
from the lowliest yearling reserve
on up to the Nevers, the Corbuses,
and the Graysons has wanted to play
football, or he wouldn't have lasted
in practice drills any longer than an
icicle in the Sahara. Too, he has
earnestly wanted to go to school or
he never would have been given a
chance to go to Stanford in the first
place.
There is a maximum of sweat and
a minimum of glory in a football
workout—and that holds for chilly
days as well as any other kind. And
do the boys work? Actual figures
tell the story: for every 60 minutes
played in the Stadium, there is any
where from 12 to 18 full-sized hours
of the "most intensive conditioning
put in on the practice turf.
Losing Weight
About half of the team never gets
called for any action at all off the
workout field. Yet, with all this,
Tiny has never known one man to
turn in his suit because he thought
he was being worked too hard.

There's a big chart in the locker
room upon which every man must
post his weight daily before practice
and after; the average loss of weight
during a session is two and three
quarters pounds.
Only natural is it for the powers
to cast about for dependable talent.
They offer aid, if the ace grid war
rior wants it and is worth it—but
with it goes work, and more work.
Work that starts early in the spring
continues through the summer, and
through much of the winter, not
counting the actual football season
itself. A ceaseless grind and then no
assurance of reward in the form of
public acclaim—this is demanded of
today's football team.
Smart Kids
It is no wonder that the Vowing
Soph miracle team seemed to tire,
to falter in the senior year. Every
body said the powers were smart
kids. Not that their grades showed
it. But they were an extremely in
telligent bunch. Their four years in
high school football had been fun,
but by the time they had gone
through three years in college, with
that powerful year-round concen
tration on one single thing, it had
lost the old appeal.
College football is hyper-special
ized. The competition with other
schools means your team with its 11
men must be trained to a peak of
condition and co-ordination. Each
man's muscular and nervous system
must be speeded, up for quick re
flexes, so that thinking and actions
become automatic. Sportswriters
make much of the quick-thinking of
the football players, but the fact is
that on the football field, action is so
rapid that there is little time for ac
tual reflective decisions. As a noted
golfer recently said about his own
sport: "You have to learn to be able
to think with your muscles."
Set Patterns
The quarterback as he peers out at
the other team while he faces them
in the huddle, has certain set pat
terns. His quick analysis takes in
the nature of their defense, the sue

cess of previous plays, the position on
the field, the time, and the down.
There is usually only one answer.
Even the so-called wide-open at
tack has little variation, because the
element of surprise has a definite
marginal utility.
The Vowing Sophs knew this.
They were quick. Once they had
mastered the technique of organiza
tion, the speed of their physical re
flexes, football as a game was gone
and football as a process replaced it.
Over the Beer
After training season was over,
and there was a chance to talk to
some of the boys over a glass of
beer, they would say how the old
thrill of newspaper publicity didn't
mean anything. That the headlines
that were read by millions didn't
count, because the millions didn't
mean anything to them. They realiz
ed that it would have little bearing
on getting them jobs when they
graduated. They realized that the
headlines signified highly specializ
ed, painfully won training in a termi
nal activity. They didn't want to go
on playing football. And the years
of labor to develop themselves had
little carry-over value.
What is more, the years of con

centration on one single thing de
prived them of developing their tal
ents in some sport which they could
play when they graduated. For most
of them, their football playing would
stop when they were out of school,
and they would find most of their
fx-iends playing golf, tennis, doing
some swimming, maybe taking an
occasional fling at basketball. But
they would never like to play these
leisure-time sports, because their
muscles had not been co-ordinated
for them in college. The result: the
football player settles down to a

more or less sedentary existence,
realizing all the while that he should
keep in condition, but never doing it.
The nation-wide publicity they
would gladly have traded for the
feeling of being one of the student
body.
It is true that the making of a
good house, the admiration of the
students, evoked a temporary feeling
of pride, but it became a hollow
feeling later, when they realized that
the house used them as an ornament,
a trinket, and expected them to car
ry on with the activity for the "good
of the house."
And yet, they liked the game at
times. They liked the other boys on
the squad. They thought Tiny was
keen, because Tiny knew what it
was all about. He tried as much as
he could to bring football out of the
routine, out of the specialized, but
Tiny was under greater pressure
than they, and they knew it. They
liked Stanford, and scorned the foot

ball ethics of other schools. Although
they appreciated the few exemptions
and the exceptions, they also were
glad that they were made to conform
to the things that ordinary students
had to. Because, when the old alum
nus who was sending them to Stan
ford came up to them first, he had
told them that Stanford could give
him a better education, and he was
the kind of a boy with whom that
sort of an appeal had an effect.
