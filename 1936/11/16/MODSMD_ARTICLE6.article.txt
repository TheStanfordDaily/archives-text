AS it was on the ancient pyramids
~ of Egypt, workers soon will be
swarming up a pile of poles, packing
boxes, and D.U. furniture, Stanford's
boniiie sacrifice to King Football.
Climax to the Big Game football
rally,, the Bonfire will go up in a
fiery consecration Thursday.
On the dry bed of Lagunita nine
telephone poles already rise 50 feet
high, and the first tinder is in place.
The P. G. and E. brought the poles
down, installed them for the Bonfire
Committee.
Jeeb Halaby's bonfire committee
has already scoured the country for
combustibles, with each section
zoned, but the freshman class will do
the building. ,
Frosh Backbone
Every frosh class for the last 25

'37-ers, has turned out enthusiastic
to create a bigger and better bonfire,

and the members of the Class of '37,
in an effort to retrieve themselves,
have been chairmen of the committee
ever since. Although the entire
school may join in the work, the
backbone of the job lies in the ef
forts of the freshmen.
Thursday, November 19, will see
work carried on from 8 in the morn
ing till 6 in the evening, with the
men of '40 not suffering the humilia
tion of walking to the lake bed, but
instead sitting at ease, while car
owning Robleites chauffeur them
from Encina to the scene of action.
Women To Feed
A lunch will be served by the fair
frosh at the location of the bonfire
(o save the workers from Encina
edibles.
Trucks donated by Paly merchants
will bring in material gathered dur
ing the past week by the scouring
hordes of committeemen.

It is rumored the bonfire commit- j
tee has had two certified public en- !
gineering majors (Phi Beta Kappas) j
working for it, and that they esti j
mate the finished conflagration \
should contain 709.257.494,080 cubic I
millimeters of assorted stuff, ranging '
from D.U. furniture to aerial bombs, i
