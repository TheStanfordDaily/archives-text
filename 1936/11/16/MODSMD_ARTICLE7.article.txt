The Editor, Sir:
To the Encina resident who struck
my roommate in the eye with a
water bag last Saturday, breaking his
glasses.
Congratulations!
You scored a perfect hit. Your j
waterbag split one of the lenses of
Leland Glover's spectacles in half i
and impacted the piece against his
eyeball. A blood clot has formed and
there is an excellent possibility of
permanent injury.
It was quite amusing, wasn't it, to
nail someone with a water bag. And

no doubt it would have been simply
hilarious if Glover had groped about j
blindly in excruciating agony while
splinters of glass played hide and'
seek in his eyeball.
He isn't depending on his father to
work his way through school for him. i

He knows the value of money, and he
has to think about doctors' fees and
the price of a new pair of spectacles;
Whoever you are, I strongly sug
gest you rally your manhood and
make restitution, now.
Arthur Levison
