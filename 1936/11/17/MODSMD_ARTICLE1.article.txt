# Clubhouse Lauded As New Nitery
## Poll Shows Campus Spot Would Replace Highway Week-end Parties 
### DAVE LEFF 
Despite distance and inclement
weather, Saturday's Nitery at the
golf course country club scored an
overwhelming success over previous
Niteries as 89 per cent of the 102
guests went on record as enthusias
tically favoring it over the A.S.S.U.
lobby affairs.
Results of the balloting which
went on during the evening indi
cate that the Nitery fills a definite
demand at Stanford, that the links
clubhouse satisfies this demand far
better than the Union, that an on
campus dance spot would keep peo
ple from going down the highway for
wining and dancing, but that the
golf course, scene of Saturday's
dance, attracts only those driving
automobiles or getting hitches.
Between 9 and 12 o'clock, The
Daily distributed 102 ballots to a
half hundred couples who were
dancing, talking, and lapping up
cakes and shakes at the soda foun
tain.

Detailed results of the poll show
that, to the question "Do you like
this better than the Cellar Nitery?"
89 voted yes; 6, no; 5, no response.
To the question "Would you come
again?" 68 said frequently; 30, oc
casionally; 3, never; and 1 gave no
response. Asked "Would you go
down the highway instead?" 5 said
yes, 74 said no, and 22 were unde
cided. To the question "Did you
drive here?" 101 answered yes; one
who came on a bicycle, no.
At least two people complaincd of
the dance floor while lauding the
social atmosphere prevalent. Of the
thi-ee customers averring they would
come again "never," two were among
the first dozen to show up and the
last to depart. One shy miss said
she would come again frequently "if
I'm asked."
A good many, while admitting the
golf course's superiority to the Union
Cellar, held that on account of dis
tance it should be reserved for more
formally arranged dances.
Ice Cream Loses Money
Query three, "Would you go down
the highway instead?" elicited the
most vehement reactions. "Oh my,
no!" "Hell, no!" "No, by gosh!" "NO"
were typical responses, while such
equivocations as "depends," "50-50,"
"?" "perhaps," "sometimes," and
"seldom" appeared no less than 18
times. One frank exerciser of the
franchise maintained "Yes, if Miller's
would open."
Although figures were unavail
able for Saturday, the fountain re
ported sales totaling $14.50, of which
$4.50 went for salaries to two soda
jcrkcrs. As genuine ice cream is
used in milk shakes, the fountain
loses money on these, but profits
from other items, cokes especially
being nearly all gravy.
Floor Wax Mislaid
Trade was brisk and constant, the
Nitery attracting formal-clad dan
ccrs from Roble Friday, and many
off-campus dates who commented
favorably on the alTiar. About a
dozen stags were in evidence Satur
day, but no cutting-in went on.
Mislaid floor wax prevented the
smoothing of the floor Saturday, al
though Friday's floor was mirror
smooth.

Ice Cream Loses Money
Query three, "Would you go down
the highway instead?" elicited the
most vehement reactions. "Oh my,
no!" "Hell, no!" "No, by gosh!" "NO"
were typical responses, while such
equivocations as "depends," "50-50,"
"?" "perhaps," "sometimes," and
"seldom" appeared no less than 18
times. One frank exerciser of the
franchise maintained "Yes, if Miller's
would open."
Although figures were unavail
able for Saturday, the fountain re
ported sales totaling $14.50, of which
$4.50 went for salaries to two soda
jcrkcrs. As genuine ice cream is
used in milk shakes, the fountain
loses money on these, but profits
from other items, cokes especially
being nearly all gravy.
Floor Wax Mislaid
Trade was brisk and constant, the
Nitery attracting formal-clad dan
ccrs from Roble Friday, and many
off-campus dates who commented
favorably on the alTiar. About a
dozen stags were in evidence Satur
day, but no cutting-in went on.
Mislaid floor wax prevented the
smoothing of the floor Saturday, al
though Friday's floor was mirror
smooth.
Despite distance and inclement
weather, Saturday's Nitery at the
golf course country club scored an
overwhelming success over previous
Niteries as 89 per cent of the 102
guests went on record as enthusias
tically favoring it over the A.S.S.U.
lobby affairs.
Results of the balloting which
went on during the evening indi
cate that the Nitery fills a definite
demand at Stanford, that the links
clubhouse satisfies this demand far
better than the Union, that an on
campus dance spot would keep peo
ple from going down the highway for
wining and dancing, but that the
golf course, scene of Saturday's
dance, attracts only those driving
automobiles or getting hitches.
Between 9 and 12 o'clock, The
Daily distributed 102 ballots to a
half hundred couples who were
dancing, talking, and lapping up
cakes and shakes at the soda foun
tain.

89 voted yes; 6, no; 5, no response.
To the question "Would you come

casionally; 3, never; and 1 gave no
response. Asked "Would you go
down the highway instead?" 5 said

At least two people complaincd of
the dance floor while lauding the
social atmosphere prevalent. Of the

come again "never," two were among

last to depart. One shy miss said
she would come again frequently "if
I'm asked."
