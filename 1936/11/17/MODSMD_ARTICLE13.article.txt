# Grocery Strike Affects Co-op
## Cheese, Butter, Meat Only Foodstuffs Available 
### 
Cheese and butter are the only
groceries from San Francisco that
have been available to the student
co-op here on the campus, since the
start of the grocery warehouse strike
the first of this month, according to
Elliot Ayres, manager of the co-op.
Fortunately, Ayres, anticipating a
strike, has kept stocked up with ex
tra groceries to the value of $3000
since the beginning of the quarter.
Although the strike was ended Sat
urday, there are so many orders to be
filled that distribution will remain
tied up for some time.
Meat has continued to be available
from San Francisco, but many of the
supplies have had to be ordered from
Fresno, together with certain articles
from San Jose.
Although the water front strike
has not yet obstructed the flow of
supplies here, Ayres sees a probable
difficulty in getting such things as
canned crab, okra, clams, and Loui
siana shrimp.
