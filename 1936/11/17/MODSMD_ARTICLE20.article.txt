# Dismissal Seen In Miller Case
## Night Club Owner May Enter Guilty Plea 
### 
Dismissal o£ Frank J. Miller, in
| dieted on a second charge of selling
| intoxicating liquor to minors, and
the conviction of Robert Lowe, bar
tender, was a strong possibility last
night.
Voiced by Justice of the Peace Ed
ward E. Hardy, who is scheduled to
preside at Miller's hearing tomorrow
morning, was the opinion that a dis
missal motion will be recommended
for the night club owner before the
trial begins. Judge Hardy also added
that, as he understood the situation,
Lowe would plead guilty to the
above charge before tomorrow. If
both of these events occur, there will
be no need to hold a hearing.
Miller Silent
At a late hour last night, neither
Miller nor his attorney, K. R. Mc-
Dougall, would deny or confirm any
thing related to their plans. De
clared Miller, "I shall have nothing
to say for publication until Wednes
day." •
It was only after a lengthy session
in a Palo Alto court room that Dep
uty District Attorney Clicsley Doug
las came to recommend the granting
of a defense motion for a directed
verdict of acquittal in Miller's first
hearing last October 29. At that time,
Douglas announced that, although
evidence against the defendant was
not sufficient for conviction, there
would be stronger evidence in the
trial first set for yesterday, but post
poned until tomorrow.
Guilty Plea Expected
With the announcement that Lowe
is expected to enter a guilty plea,
and that Miller may again be dis
missed, it became apparent that such
evidence applied more directly to
the bartender, and not to Miller,
t urther details of the case were
withheld.
Since the beginning of his first
trial, Miller has not been operating
his bar and restaurant located on
Highway 101. Whether the outcome
of his current case will determine
whether or not the place will st;iy
closed,'he would not say.
