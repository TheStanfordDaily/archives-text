## 
### 
No yell leader practice will he held
this week, according to Webb Jones,
yell king. Because of the numerous
activities planned for the next few
days in connection with the Big
Game, thn practice will be post-i
poned until Tuesday, November 24.
Jim HansohofT and Nelly Wheeler,
yell leaders in charge of the tryouts,
urge that more sophomores turn up
at that time, as no final choices have
beon made to date. There still is a
good chance for anyone interested.
