## THOMPSONIA NO. 2 
### 
The admirers of Dr. J. Douglas
Thompson, it seems, are legion, and
the recent mail brings to light a
young lady who is undoubtedly the
greatest living authority on the sub
ject of Dr. Thompson, the Oakland
Bernarr MacFadden.
And so, for the edification of the
great horde who positively roll on
the floor at the dulcet tones of Dr.
Tawmpson's inimitable home-made
accent, I quote excerpts from her
priceless collection of choice Thomp
son isms.
* * *
From his radio talks:
"Volume one is but one of its
brothers and sisters known as Vol
umes two, three, and four."
"... perpetuating life and elong
ating it too."
"May you long live in the shadow
of sunshine."
"... for after you have passed
; way, life is nothing but an empty
shell."
"The delicious, tangy, and self
r. itisfying meat of the duck."
(With reference to what he terms
"athletic feet") . . causes a
rather odiferous sort of odor to ema
il te from them."
'Those 32 pearly white mills bet
tc .• known as your teeth."
Old Man Disease, your bitterest
er smy."
'You are digging your way to the
[\\ ive with your knife and fork."
\nd the gem of them all (speaking
of migraine): "... torturing, agon
i. ig, and in addition to this, almost
di: trading."
* * *
rom his literary masterpieces,
be <er known as "Eating Your Way
to Health" and "Eating Your Way to
lit tith Weekly":
' Coughs and colds are a sudden
noisy expulsion of air from the lungs,
i s ally produced by an excessive
q..,. ntity of acid in the system."
"Around that time of the year bet
ter known as July, our table is
ced with that appetizing fruit
hoi Ler known as the fig."
1 he title of one of MRS. J. Doug
-I:i.s Thompson's recipes "Cauliflower
Su prise—Everybody Loves It."
And another "Blackberry Cocktail
'Jh Boy, What a Treat!"
* * *
I.ut the pay-off of all, to my mind,
is ihe letter the Thompson Authority
write to the doctor to win a copy of
"iZ iting Your Way to Health."
' "he letter goes
One month ago I was at Death's
door. I was suffering from typhoid
fever, Bright's disease, ateriosclero
sis, angina pectoris, pyorrhea, and
a: 1 iletic feet. My fingernails would
break off and one of my eyes had a
cataract. The doctors gave me no
hope of recovering and I was pre
pared to die, as I am 80 years old.
Bet one morning, praise God, I hap
p: led to tune in on one of your lec
tures, Dr. Thompson, and now my
f> i -nds hardly recognize me. I im
rm diately started Eating My Way to
Ifialth and haven't missed one of
y ir lectures since. I have gained
"0 pounds in the last months and
e> ject to live to be at least 100,
a! 1 due to your humanitarian work."

c( irse.

Her letter is no less a classic than
v, s her husband's to Dr. Thompson,
x lo the doctor, after bragging about
1 w illness never kept him away
1 im a broadcast, showed up before
; microphone with a cold big enough
n.r a regiment. The lady's husband

wrote J. Douglas that he ought to
see a doctor.
Dr. Thompson never replied.
