# Silicosis Discussed On Stanford Hour
## 
### 
Silicosis, the disease caused by
silica dust to which nearly 500,000
people in the United States are po
tentially exposed, was the subject
last evening of Dr. Philip Hale Pier
son's address on the Stanford Radio
Hour from station KGO.
"It may be thought by some that
the only individuals exposed to the
dangers of silicosis are miners. But
silica difct is present in the pottery
industry and that of the moulder,
sandblaster, and many others." Dr.
Pierson cited these facts in his talk.
An authority on lung diseases, Dr.
Pierson is clinical professor of med
icine and consultant in tuberculosis,
pediatrics, at the Stanford Medical
School.
