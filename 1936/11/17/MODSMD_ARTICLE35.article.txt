# Million Persons Cross Big Span Over Week-end
## 
### 
With an estimated million persons
crossing the bridge during the three
day festival and $150,000 in toll re
ceipts, the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay span was opened, feted, cele
brated as "beginning a new era for
the queen city" last week-end.
Although the three-day festival
was ended officially by Saturday
night's parade, more cars crossed the
structure from Sunday noon to
midnight than the first day of the
opening. In San Francisco cars were
lined three - deep for eight miles
waiting their turn to cross the
"world's longest bridge"; six thou
sand vehicles crossed every hour
during the afternoon and evening.
In spite of the unbelievable con
fusion of traffic, there were only
seven injuries from accidents on
the bridge. One man, 77, was killed
in Oakland and 18 were injured in
the East Bay regions; six were ar
rested for drunken driving, three
fined $100 each.
Three days of festivities planned
by the chambers of commerce of
Oakland and San Francisco included
parades, fireworks, and regattas.
Eighteen warships were in the har
bor for the first day of the opening,
and on Thursday night three dances
were given for enlisted men and offi
cers. After the first day the crowds
found their own amusement at the
Santa Clara - St. Mary's football
game, the auto show, and the opera.
