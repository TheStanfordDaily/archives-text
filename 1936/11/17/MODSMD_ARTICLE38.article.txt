# SIDELINE SLANTS
## A 						LOOSE PREDICTION, BUT A GOOD ONE: 
### 
Credit should go to Don Lieben
dorfer for one of the best predic
tions of the year.
Last September, Don told us, said
he with boyish enthusiasm, This is
going to be a whale of a season, not
so much from a win-lose standpoint,
but from the angle of good, exciting
football. Nobody in the conference
will get through with a perfect rec
ord, and there'll be darn few with
but one loss."
Stands up swell, doesn't it? In spite
of the fact that most of the crowd at
Portland Saturday was pretty rabid
ly 0.5.C., and that they had the win
snatched from them in the most
painful way—suddenly and unex
pectedly — everyone was in good
spirits afterward. Both teams had
done well, and the* excitement of the
play was worth far more than the
price of admission.
Art Kirkham, the radio announcer,
wanted to apologize to the Stanford
campus for going "completely ber
serk" at the end of the game, but he
wasn't much out of place up there—
the whole stadium went berserk
when Oregon State took the lead
near the end. What happened when
Stanford grabbed it back is difficult
to describe. 0
Calvelli, incidentally, has thrown
longer ones in practice than that last
50-yard one up there. It was one of
Tiny's regular A-left plays, but
Vigna drew it out on his hand in
the huddle for both Tony and Stone,
to be sure and get agreement be
tween the two.
'"I saw Stone beating it down the
sidelines, and I knew where he was
supposed to be, so I just let go for
that place. Then a couple of guys
tackled me and I never did see the
rest of the play," said Tony.
"Mountain and Gray didn't think
he could throw it that far, and were
caught short, but I had to run my
hardest all the way to get there in
time," said Grant.
Tsoutsouvas, who passed from cen
ter, Coffis, Clark, and Gamier, who
deployed to the left flat, and Vigna,
Callaway, Matthews, Ferko, and Zn
gar, who protected, did not make
statements.
