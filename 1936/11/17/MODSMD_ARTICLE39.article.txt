# QUICK THINKING BOB AND CHOOCH

"Can't help catching them when
they throw right at you," said Bobby
Matthews, referring to the second
Stanford touchdown. The right guard
has been dropping back on passes
ever since t? e U.S.C. game, and
Matthews had about five Stanford
men in front of him when he caught
this one and started for the right
hand corner.
Chooch trailed him all the way
down, discussing the lateral the
while, but was tackled after he had
run about 20 yards up to the five.
Here he got rid of the ball, and while
both teams stood around thinking
it over, Coffis picked it up and
skooted to the left and over for the
score.
Matthews, Hoos, and Tsoutsouvas
together made two-thirds of the
tackles in the first half . . . Zagar
and Clark were as good as ever,
Clark playing ready and waiting for
Pete to block the first kick . . .
Zagar' must have touched at least
three punts during the day . . .
Brigham's punting was splendid, '
long and well placed every time . . . f
That kick that Coffis thought was
out of bounds on the 20 was out , . .
Hoos pulled a fastie by saving Coffis
during the first half; we all could
see that the Orangemen were for
getting him and would get caught.
Callaway was the strongest of the
light tackles, even with his injury.
"I was using only one arm all after
noon," said he.
The weather was crisp, and the
field, luckily, was fast, but the yard
lines in midfield were completely ob
literated by the end of the first half.
