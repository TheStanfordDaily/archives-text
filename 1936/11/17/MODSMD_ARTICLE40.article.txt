# Dopesters Try Prediction For Coming Game
## Both Teams Promising; 300 Unsold Ducats On Farm; Cal Has 2700 
### 
One large question mark.
Wielders of the Stanford Axe vo
ciferously vow that it's in the bag
for the Indians. Golden Bears, on
the other hand, are just as dead sure
that it's on ice for California. But
the three or four dopesters who do
not fall into one of the above classi
fications are iaced by the inevitable
interrogation point when they get
down to actual records and attempt
to predict the outcome of the Big
Game.
Observers Puzzled
Up until mid-season the Big Game
was taking on aspects of a clam
bake, as far as the cash customers
were concerned. And even Farm
rooters were beginning to face the
wailing wall.
Then it began to happen. Tiny
Thornhill's warriors drubbed U.C.
L.A.; the following week they threw
a monkey wrench into the gears of
Jimmy Phelan's Husky machine
and garnered a tie. Last Saturday
in Portland the Redskins' chances
began to lose their rosy hue.
Stub Allison's charges had just
finished sinking the Oregon Web
feet, 28-0, at Berkeley. At Portland,
Oregon State had a fairly comfort
able lead over the Redshirts and
there were only seconds to go. The
Bears leaned back on their locker
room benches and heaved a sigh of
relief, of confidence, of delight. But
when the Indians' winning tally
came, Bear jaws dropped low enough
to bounce on the floor.
In due time, however, the man
eating beasts recovered from their
shock, and when they later began to
compare ratings for this Saturday's
tussle, they found that there was
still plenty of wind in their sails.
Unfortunate and sad as this sounds
for the Farm forces, it is only too
true.
On the debit side under their cur
rent assets is a defense of no mean
proportions. Also there Henry
Sparks, in shape for action only
since early last week, and yet ca
pable of scoring two touchdowns
against the Ducks and kicking no
less than four conversions.
Bottari Good
Next comes Vic Bottari, who now
seems to rank with the best of full
backs. He has been justly called
"spark-plug," "spearhead of the Cal
attack," and a "neat little package of
TNT. Bottari, Sparks, McAteer,
Evans, and Stoll played good enough
ball to earn possible starting spots on
the first string, and certainly good
enough to give the Bears some pretty
dependable reserve strength.
Yesterday only 13600 ducats re
mained unsold: 2700 are now at Ber
out, Tiny Thornhill has in his kids
this year as fine a "don't-give-up"
spirit as they come.
He's right. But I hope and trust
they won't wait for a "come-from
behind" this week.

keley, 400 can be had at agencies,
while only about 300 are left on the
Farm.
