Phi Psi vs. Business Schdol I.
Sunken Diamond, 4:15 o'clock.
Two games of the 1936 intramural
football championship play-offs were
run off yesterday, with Phi Dolt and
Delta Chi coming through the day
still in the running.
S.A.E. started the scoring with a
pass from Dale Dodds to Ross Will
son for a 70-yard gain—20 in the
air and 50 on the ground—for a
score. Phi Delt didn't get going un
til the second half, when Johnny
Wyeth caught Ben Dey's 10-yard
pass for a touchdown. The second
Phi Delt score was made by Jim Dil
lon when he blocked an S.A.E. kick
and fell on it over the goal. Wyeth
converted both times.
Kappa Sig lost a heart-breaker to
Delta Chi—neither team scored in
the regular game time, but Mervyn
Sullivan was able to pass into Kappa
Sig territory in the overtime. On
the last Kappa Sig play Heringer
passed to Russell, but the latter was
downed on the 49-yard line, 1 yard
short of victory.
Business School I became winner
of League 7 yesterday by an over
time victory over El Toro. The Biz
boys completed a long sleeper pass
on the last play of their overtime pe
riod for the victory.
