# Tankmen Set For Own Big Game At Cal Saturday
## Contest May Decide Title; Teams Resume Series At Farm Next Week 
### 
Big Game atmosphere hit the
vicinity of Encina Pools this week,
but Nort Thornton's varsity water
poloists aren't thinking about foot
ball. They have their own Big Game
with the California Bears to worry
about.
Saturday morning, Stanford's un
defeated Indian water poloists battle
with the once-defeated Bears in the
Berkeley pool in a game that may
determine the conference champion
ship. A win for the slightly favored
Cards will give them the title; a
victory for the Bears will throw the
conference limelight 6n the Farm
where the same two squads battle in
the second game of the annual series
Tuesday afternoon.
Both teams are rated as the best in
the respective aquatic histories of
their institutions. Thornton will be
pitting such men as Big Bill Hanna,
Sharpshooting Johny Lamb, Captain
Bob Haslacher, Fighting Don Peter
son, Tricky Bob Hoover, and de
fensive threats Chuck Giffen and Ben
Voss against A1 Dowden's "Wonder
Team of water polo."
The fiery Cal mentor relies on
Sharkey Graham, center back on
Uncle Sam's Olympic Games team
this summer, to squelch Stanford's
vow boys of water polo. Graham is
the backbone and inspiration of the
Bear team. He is the spark plug that
put the name wonder into the Cal
wonder team.
The Indians will outweigh the
Bears heavily, but the smaller Cal
amphibians have depended on their
marvelous passing attack and speed
to win their games this season.

over the death of her husband, who
plunged 14 stories from their apart
ment, put the former Adelaide Mof
fett. Standard Oil heiress, under care
of a physician today.
