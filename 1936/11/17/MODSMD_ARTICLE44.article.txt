# Matthews, Garnier Win Grid Awards
## 
### 
To "Post-Holes" Matthews, fleet
footed. swivel-hipped, phantom-fly
ing guard who blommed onto one of
Beaver Joseph Gray's passes at the
tip end of the second quarter during
the Card-Oregon State game Satur
day and maneuvered it into a touch
down, goes this week's David Keeble
fountain pen award.
Gathering all his 5 feet, 8 and a
half inches and 195 pounds into ac
tion, Matthews snatched down the
aforesaid pass, lumbered for 5 min
utes from the 30 to the 20, or there
abouts, and lateraled to Tsoutsouvas.
Ed Garnicr, who gave Earl Hoos
a rest, caught the eye of Carl Schott,
special emissary and judge of Dr.
Dakan, and as a result can go around
for months pasting up second-hand
postage stamps with the Robert El
mer Dakan award of a carton of
chewing gum, given weekly to the
outstanding substitute player.
