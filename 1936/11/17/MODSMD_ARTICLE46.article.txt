# Week-end Football Burns Up Radios
## 
### 
King Football reigned with a real
iron hand this week-end and sub
jected radio listeners to a terrific
beating as one super-thriller after
another blasted its way out of the
nation's stadia into the speakers in
millions of homes.
A blood-curdler in the first degree
had Palmer Stadium as its back
ground, Yale and Princeton as its
principals. The former won, 26-23.
after a game which left spectators
dazed and groggy. The Tigers led
most of the first half, and with but
one minute to play, the Yales scored
and converted, making the score
16-7. The next period saw the Yale

first-half pups Jckyll-Hyde into
second-half raging mad. full-grown
Bulldogs, as they twisted the Tigers'
tails to gain the lead 20-16. Prince
tun pulled into the lead again. 23-20.
but the Yales refused to be stopped,
scoring once more on a series of
sweeping end runs, winning 26-23.
In the course of the Notre Dame-
Army classic, the Irish pushed the
Army mules all over the field, threw
passes between their ears, and gen
erally made the West Pointers look
pretty bad, in winning, 20-6. Lone
Army score resulted from a beauti
ful 65-yard punt runback by Monk
Meyer.
On the coast, Washington's Hus

kies began celling their comps to the
Rose Bowl game as they made the
Trojan Horse look like a new-born
colt, 12-0. W.S.C. did a thorough
job of subduing a very slow U.C.L.A.
Bruin, 32-7. The Berkeley Bears had
duck soup for dinner after smearing
Oregon, 28-0.
St. Mary's 13-year-old jinx was
bucked to helangone as unbeaten
Santa Clara trampled the Gaels, 19-0.
Two passes in the first 10 minutes led
to the same number of scores, and a
blocked kick in the third quarter
added another touchdown.

Don Herold wonders if Mr. Ein
i stein has Mrs. Einstein figured out.
