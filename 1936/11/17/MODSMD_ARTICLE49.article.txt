# The 						Wafer Bag Stage
## 
### 
Last year a milk bottle flung from an Encina
window knocked a student unconscious. This
week-end a water bag tossed from the fourth
floor broke a student's glasses; the glass cut his
eye, endangered his eye-sight. It happens that
the student whose eye-sight is endangered is
working his way through. He doesn't have
money to spend for buying glasses or paying
doctor bills.
It may be that the one who threw the water
bag may have enough decency to admit his
guilt and pay for the damages, but that doesn't
pay for the study hours lost or the pain suffered,
and it doesn't prevent such occurrences from
happening again.
It doesn't do any good for the sponsors to
print up the rules and tack them up neatly in
every room. It doesn't do any good to threaten
punishment, when only a few are caught to be
punished. If there were policemen on 24-hour
duty in every corridor and on every stairway,
the carnage would be even worse. That is tack
ling Encina trouble at the wrong end of the hose.
Realizing that, the sponsors resign themselves
to doing nothing.
The sponsors were supposed to be tackling
the problem the other way in the Pre-reg period
this fall. But the sponsors either did not tackle
well, or else the effect of their talks didn't last.
The sponsors didn't have time, what with their
full study and activity schedules, to really get at
the educational aspect of their job. What is
more, the sponsors are not far enough removed
horn their own experiences in Encina to have
an entirely objective viewpoint.
I qustion v/hether most of the sponsors have
picked up enough of a scientific attitude in four
years of college to understand the complex
psychology of an adolescent undergoing the
violent transition from parental restriction at
home to the comparative freedom of the Uni
versity.
There is a very valid basis for the University
theory of laissez-faire individualism in letting
hie student work out his violent transition by
himself. If he hasn't ruined himself and dis
graced his family and made himself into an
intellectual stumble-bum" in the process he
comes out a finished product, but how many
co? If conditions are just right, if the individual
i 3 from a good solid family, if he has gone to
a class "A" high school, if he is sure of what
he wants to get out of college, then Encina can
not hurt him.
But supposing he has not been nurtured in the
optimum environment. High school has not
taught him how to study. He hits Stanford not
knowing why he came here. His adviser rec
ommends a course for him, too busy to find out
about what he needs.
All right, he hits the classroom. The professor
i i too busy making the University a cradle of
Jaarning to bother with the student or to put in
his course the energy and enthusiasm that will
nterest or inspire. The instructor is too busy
irying to be like a professor. Separating the
faculty and student in addition is the very real
barrier of the grade system, which makes apple
polishing a cardinal sin. Besides this, the very
aloofness of the professor and the mechanical
coldness of the Time Schedule and the size of
the faculty obviate any frosh attempts at ac
quaintanceship. It is not until after the student
jets into a major department or an activity that
lie gets to pierce the faculty halo.
Unacquainted with the college method of
study, inept at budgeting his time, probably

with some illusions that it is more important to
learn what is interesting and important to him,
rather than what is important to the professor
and his blue book, the frosh stands a remarkable
chance to get severely buffeted by his grades.
With a sense of failure, the freshman does not
understand why he is in college. He cannot do
well in his classes. There is nothing presented
that interests him. He cannot see that what he
is learning is doing him arty good. Even though
he came to college with a willing attitude, col
lege has insulted him, offended him, done its
best to make him not want o go on. Is there
anybody there at this time to tell the frosh why
he should continue?
If he should happen to find his sponsor in,
would the sponsor tell him, would he have the
time to explain, would he know? Like everyone
else, the sponsor is too busy with his own
problems. Everyone is too busy with his own
problems. Nobody is trained to know the prob
lem or to know it is his problem also.
Is it any wonder that the freshman turns to
water-bag throwing? If his time were employed
as it should be, would he have time for water
bag throwing? If he were really getting an edu
cation would he care about water-bag throwing?
The water-bag stage is the transitional period
between high school adolescence and college
maturity. That 95 per cent of the students (in
cluding sponsors) never get past this stage is a
symptom of the fact that college today is break
ing down as a means of educating, that it is,
in fact, an anti-educational institution, and Stan
ford, which has an unexampled opportunity to
do something about it, is as bad as the rest.

Today at 1:15 in the Daily Shack all members
of editorial staff will, should, and must meet to
settle problems of state. Plans for the Big Game
edition will be laid and rolled by Edit Board
and sports staff. Only a few choice weeks of
Daily publishing remain in this quarter for re
demption of delinquent reporters and copy
readers, so come around and join the festivities.
