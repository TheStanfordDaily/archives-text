THROUGH THE PEARLY GATES—63 CENTS
Until you ride on it, the Bay Bridge is just a col
lection of pictures and color-stories in the S.F. papers.
After you ride on it, you've met God.
God gives you individual attention if you ride at
night. Coming up the long incline from the Oakland
side, the road is a pathway to heaven done in celestial
yellow, and St. Peter stands at the toll gate. St. Peter
will nick you for 65 cents, but that's cheap for heaven
even if it's a hold-up to get from Oakland.

I don't want to believe the thing was ever on blue
prints. The idea that pesky cosines and coefficients of
expansion really mothered that colossus is more than
precious human emotion can stand. And I like to be
sure of this—no hard-boiled math-master really put
the bridge where it is, one foot on Rincon Hill, the
other on the Oakland flats.
There's a story about that. It seems the engineers
said you couldn't build a span from the city to Yerba
Buena Island, even if the decimal points were fly
specks. They had piddled and diddled when some fel
low who didn't know a caliper from a lobster's claw
solved the problem: "Build two bridges," said he. "And
put the center foundation in the middle of the bay."
"Gosh!" said the engineers, and then back they
went to their slide rules to figure out how big it ought
to be.
A tribute to that unknown, perhaps fictional, guy
is the big concrete monolith commuters argue over. It
sits in the middle of the bay .It made the bridge
possible.

I liked to believe that story before I ever rode
across the bridge because it appealed to a personal
math-phobia. Now, more than ever, I want to believe
it, because it explains how the bridge got there—not
by the diamond-sharp hair-splittings of the draftsman,
but by the transcendent intelligence of someone who
didn't know or care about engineering idols.
His kind of reasoning makes the bridge credible,
and justifies God's animating touch.
He was the same man who millions of years ago
rolled a stone down hill, and invented the wheel.
