One of the stories that the football muckrakers of
yesterday's Daily Tabby missed concerns a very vital
function of the Unicvrsity known as sitting on and
about the alumni.
Widely-known amongst Stanfordites is the fact that
certain alumni, particularly that species known as the
football foot-thc-billcrs, resent President Wilbur be
cause he docs not let them run his business for him.
Also widely known arc the Monday morning special
delivery airmail manuals of football technique sent in
to the coachcs by the hawk-like, all-seeing eyes of the
University of Stanford at Los Angeles.
Well, it seems that two years ago the grapevine
brought to the University of Stanford at Los Angeles
newS that a star football player was having a good
time. Now this youth in question was a very colorful
individual and quite temperamental. Periodically he
would have tussles with other colorful individuals in
his house with the result that the color red would be
spread about on the carpets and chairs. Also he liked
the contents of bottles, of Roble, Lagunita, and sorori
ties, and was not afraid to admit it.
The University of Stanford, southern branch, did
not like this. The colorful individual was not putting
in time enough on football, so they decided to quit
underwriting him. Not only that, but they sent several
bound volumes to Dr. Wilbur, demanding that the
pariah be tossed out of school.
The President took the matter under advisement.
The colorful individual then went in to sec him, talking
in his very able way.
The President then talked in his very able way.
Finally, an arrangement was made. The University of
Stanford, southern branch, withdrew its backing. Out
of a special fund, however, the President found some
tuition money for students in distress, and disbursed it.
The colorful individual stayed in school. Tie lost
some of his temperament but none of his color. He
settled down to playing football. And in his last game
for Stanford was generally conceded the hero of his
team.
