# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
President Wilbur was wrong. It
only took one night of the "Nitery"
at the golf clubhouse to kill it. At
least I hope it was better on Friday.
It certainly was dead on Saturday.
To say that I was disappointed
would be an understatement of fact.
The place had the coziness of a me
dieval castle and a dance floor that
made me think of cobblestones.
Perhaps a healthy social life is im
possible at Stanford. We certainly
do not want to make a country club
out of her.

If it weren't for the fact that Stan
ford has the ground work to give
her students so much more than the
average school, I'd stop hoping. We
have a glorious campus, a picked
group of students, and a fine faculty,
and yet it spems as though we are
all frozen into our little shells.
There is just a chance that if we
had a warm, friendly gathering place
where any student regardless of race,
sex, or financial standing could and
would drop in now and then, we
might be able to change the whole
character of our school into one infi
nitely finer.

To the Editor, Sir:
The idea of a centrally located
Nitery as originally planned WAS
one of the best and most useful of
any that have hit the campus this
year. However, the removal of the
night spot to the golf clubhouse has
completely defeated the original pur
pose, i.e., to provide a place where
the student without a car could take
a date.
A recent article in The Daily even
went so far as to refer to the car-less
student as the "forgotten man." I
would like to remind certain con
tributors to the columns that San
Francisco is also within walking dis
tance, but not on high heel shoes.
Now, Mr. Editor, I would like to
know which side of the fence you
are on. Are you for the large ma
jority of fellows and girls who don't
have dates on Saturday night be
cause they have no place to go, or
are you in favor of "just another
roadhouse"? Since the Nitery is
really a protege of The Daily it's up
to you for "as The Daily goes, so
goes the Nitery."
Very truly yours,
"The Forgotten Man"
