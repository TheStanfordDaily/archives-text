"Tin: GREAT GULLIVER," at the
Varsity last week.
Russian dramatists convert Swift's
satire on Gulliver's encounter with
the Lilliputians into a more biting
tract for the Revolution. For in this
film the land of the Lilliputians, with
its moronic ruler, its vested inter
ests, its civil wars obviously repre
sents western capitalistic govern
ments.
Says young Gulliver, a Russian
scout, as he finally awakens from his
dream: "How small they were—how
big we are; how great our future!"
More remarkable than its propa
ganda is the acting in this picture,
done almost entirely with marion
ettes who move, gesticulate, and
change expression with amazing nat
uralness. Each marionette is a cari
cature—the king twitching, leering
imbecilically, the prime minister,
long-jawed and terrible, the spy
sharp-featured, his long ears flap
ping.
There are whole corps of them, po
licemen, soldiers, workers, and poli
ticians. Elaborate contraptions rig
ged up to feed Gulliver show the
Russian fascination with machinery.
The musical score is filled with the
discord appropriate ot the revolu
tionary sentiment of the film; pho
tography and sound effects, though,
are both inferior to our own.

VALIANT IS THE WORD FOR
CARRIE, at the Stanford Theater.
A sentimental and too long talc
that is saved from complete maud
linity by the reserve of its principal
actress, Gladys George.
Carrie proves herself valiant by
(1) forsaking the paths of vice to
raise two homeless waifs; (2) mak
ing a success of the laundry busi
ness; and (3) bribing an unscrupu
lous woman to stay away from Car
rie's pious but naive "nephew." For
this breach Carrie is apprehended
and sent to prison. In the last scene
Carrie and the two waifs, grown

now, are united once more in her
prison cell while two old friends ex
claim over her fortitude.
Gladys George is charming and
seems at times to be making a little
fun of the character she is playing.
But audiences would have had a bet
ter cry over this one 20 years ago.
