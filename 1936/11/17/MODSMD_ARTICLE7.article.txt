Attributing a small audienCe to
the simultaneous holding of a "left
wing meeting in Redwood City,"
1' ather Raymond T. Feely criticized
the attitudes of some professors,
along with Communism and Fascism,
Friday night at the Palo Alto High
School.
Speaking under the auspices of the
Fremont Post of the American Le
gion and the Americanism League,
Father Feely recommended that all
college professors who spend any of
their leisure time supporting any
system of government other than the
present American form be fired.
I believe that there arc enough
24-hour Americans to staff our uni
versities," he explained, thereby
winning a paroxysm of applause.
Although he favored the criminal
syndicalism laws, which prohibit the
advocating of Communism in this
country, Father Feely condemned
the new Russian constitution as un
democratic, since it does not allow
advocated a change from the Com
munist system.
Voicing strong opposition to war,
Father Feely explained that defen
sive wars arc justified, and that h
strong offense is often the l)cst de
fense. "The fact that Japan may in
vade this country and seize Califor
nia for her own possession," declared
the Jesuit, "is sure to destroy the
spirit of pacifism in any red-blooded
American boy."
