# Gala Chaparral Out Tomorrow
## Big Game Events To Be Main Theme of Issue 
### 
The Big Game Chaparral goes on
sale tomorrow morning with color
getting its biggest play in years. Red,
yellow, blue, purple, brown, black,
and white color the cover cartoon,
which exploits the biblical phase of
the Big Game, and at least four in
side features arc dressed up in vio
lently tinted ink.
Of nearly two dozen contributors
to tomorrow's Chappie, 12, or about
54.6 per cent, are non-members of
Hammer and Coffin, the organization
publishing the magazine. This fact
illustrates the policy of Editor Gil
man Gist, who encourages new tal
ent in Stanford's humor mag.
Among those who appear for the
first time in Chappie's Big Game
number, Patricia Bosqui is spotted
throughout the pages. Her "tintypes"
—caricatures cut out by hand from
old tomato cans—illustrate several
features, including the opener page,
little Pop-OfT, and Fables of the
Farm, edited by Bob Hartmann.
"The Hair of the Bear," by Jim
Maclnnis, "Thornhilliad," .by Marco
Thorne, Gist, and Page Gilman, Jack
Scott's "Magnum Sportiva," "Scalp
ers" by Bud Arnold, and sundry bits
of whimsical art work cap the cli
max on the little difference of opin
ion between Stanford and Cal which
will be ironed out Saturday.
Jack Scott has discovered and
translated a rare manuscript of the
Renaissance by Bisquiccio entitled
"The Macaroon,"
Various and sundry reviews by
Brobury Ellis, Pres Ellington, Curt
Prcndergast, and those old standbys,
"Little Pop-Off"' and "Farm Fables,"
all appear in the Big Game Number,
on sale at Engineering Corner at 8
o'clock tomorrow.
