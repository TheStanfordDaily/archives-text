### DAVE BOTSFORD 
A dozen women, largest lobby yet
this quarter, streamed into Ex Com
ittee's weekly meeting last night,,
streamed out again after they had
seen that their cause was not neg
lected.
Their cause: that Fox-West Coast's
Stanford theater reduce "summer"
balcony prices from 40 to 30 cents
with student-body card, that the
theater allow night-gowned fresh
men free admittance'after the Paja
marino next fall.
Committee Will Probe
Answering the pleas of Jean Hal
liburton and Ada Martin, chairmen
of the feminine Something-Should-
Be-Doije Committee, President Jim
Reynolds appointed Barbara Kim
ball, Roy Anderson, and Bob Mal
lett to round up student opinion on
the theater situation, present it be
fore Ex Committee next Tuesday.
Agitator Halliburton reported that
all nine sororities had voted in house
meetings to support the "lower
prices" movement.
Meeting Tomorrow
Men's living group presidents or
their representatives will meet with
Reynolds' subcommittee at 5 o'clock
tomorrow in the A.S.S.U. lobby
where they will attempt some plan
of action, take home to their "con
stituents" ballots to determine ac
curate student opinion.
"We don't want a boycott to grow
out of these discussions," Miss Hal
liburton told Ex Committee. "We
want a sensible committee to arbi
trate with the theater and peacefully
try for some agreement."
Other business included:
iNITERY SUCCESS —"The golf
clubhouse nitery was successful,
both from the standpoint of fair
crowds and from fair fountain re
turns," said Chick Franich, "but we
could get an even better turn-out
in the A.S.S.U. lobby."
No more nitcrics are planned until
the first week-end in December, the
week after Thanksgiving.
