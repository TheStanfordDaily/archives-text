# Hulme Speaks On Erasmus in Lecture
## 
### 
Dr. Edward M. Hulme spoke last
night before an audience that filled
the Little Theater on Desiderias
Erasmus, the Dutch Humanist.
Erasmus was* a member of the so
ciety known as the "Brethren of the
Common Life." a group of Human
ists inspired by mysticism, and
founded for charitable and educa
tional purposes.
He was the "Prince of Humanists,"
and toward the end of his life, the
leading literary light of his period.
His "In Praise of Folly," a satire, was
written in criticism of Ecclesiastic
and secular groups. According to
Dr. Hulme. the Liberty League, the
American Legion, and the D.A.R.
would have no use for a Humanist.
