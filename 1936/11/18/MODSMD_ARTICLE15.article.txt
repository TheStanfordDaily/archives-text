# Photo Studios Close Thursday
## Four Hundred Seniors Without Quad Pictures 
### 
Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock the
1936 Quad will take the final individ
ual photograph for its senior section.
After that time, no senior will be
able to get his picture in the year
book. So far, more than 400 seniors
have not had their pictures taken.
The greater part of these is made up
of students who do not belong to
living groups or eating clubs.
These and anyone else who has not
had his picture taken may phone the
Quad office, Palo Alto 3308, for an
appointment. The Quad asks espe
cially that the following make ap
pointments: Roy B. Anderson, Ruth
D. Barnes, Lee Emerson Bassett,
Mary Belford, C. 11. Bush, Richard
B. Daugherty, Ben Dey, Peter Fay,
Oilman A. Gist., Ruth Goodan, Shir
ley Jones, Tom Kiliefer, Barbara W.
Kimball, Maxine Moore, Clinton C.
Scott, Fred Williams, and Margaret
Ellen Woodard.
According to Ruth Barnes, editor
of the Quad, most of the late photo
graphs can be handled between this
morning at 0:30 o'clock and tomor
row afternoon at 5. She says also
that there arc a great many proofs
that have not yet. been called for,
as well as a few that have not yet
been returned. The Quad would ap
preciate immediate co-operation in
this matter.
At 12:45 o'clock today, the Glee
Club will have its group picture
taken in the Union Court.
