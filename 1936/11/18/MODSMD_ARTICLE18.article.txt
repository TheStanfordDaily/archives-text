# Big Game Enthusiasm Mounts as False Bonfire Alarm Rouses Over 500 Roughs To Protect Pyre from Bear Invaders
## Braves Drench Cal 'C' With War Paint; Sixty Frosh Stage Attack 
### 
Three gallons of red paint, applied ]
Monday night by a mob from En-.i
cina, transformed the Bears' "C" '
from a bare to a cardinal red letter.
Finding the location of the "C" i
after a long search, the Farm forces
left their Cadillacs and crept stealth
ily down Grizzly Peak to within sight
of the Cal sentinels.
The sight of eighty howling In
dians charging down upon them
proved more than a match for the
I three burly Cal guards.
Having no use for such a civilized 1
i thing as a brush, the marauders
1 poured on the paint till it nearly
! covered the big cement "C." A large
I " '40" on the lower part completed
i the job.
Attack Planned
The carefully planned attack in
' eluded the enrolling of over 60 of
I the frosh, each of whom contributed
I 30 cents, and the sending out of
scouts early in the evening. At 11,
I after the scouts had reported by
phone that the coast was clear, the
roaring '40 class began its two-hour
drive to Cal's stronghold.
Steps Painted
| The frosh were coming back all
the way from 4 to 6 yesterday morn
ing. As yet, it has not been deter
mined who painted red stripes on
the steps of Cal's stadium.
In spite of heavy fog, one car man
aged to get pinched for doing 45 on
Berkeley's University Avenue. "The
cop was a good sport, though," said
the driver, "when he found what we
; were doing."
