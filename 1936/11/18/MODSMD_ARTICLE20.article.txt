# Water Bag Breaks Glasses of Soph
## 
### 
Leland Glover, the Toyon sopho
more who had his glasses broken by
an Encina water bomb causing a se
rious eye injury, was assured by Dr.
Wilbur that all bills resulting from
the accident would be paid, by Dr.
Wilbur himself if need be.
Bits of broken glass, which got in
the eye, caused Dr. Slater to state
that it was a wonder that Glover
didn't lose the sight of his eye. The
injured optic has been dilated several
times in order that no further dam
age might develop. Glover is wear
ing smoked glasses until the eye gets
better.
At a meeting of Encina sponsors
last Monday the sponsors assured
Glover that if they could do any
thing on the case they certainly
would.
