## 
### 
Through Encina's halls at 11
o'clock last night echoed the
cry, "Cal lit the bonfire," and
immediately a large gang of
sturdy frosh spe dto the Lagu
nita lake bed to put out a blaze
consisting mostly Â«f burning
paper.
An unidentified woman re
ported the fire, according to
Jeeb llalahy, chairman of the
bonfire committee. He re
mained at Lagunita until the
small hours to guard against
the fire being relit, and two
heroic freshmen, Ralph Pre
minger and Harry Berlinger,
stayed all night, braving the
cold and fog. to sec that every
thing was OK.
Roble women have confirmed
the fact that the bonfire was lit
by Cal men because some big
heroes yelled "to hell with
Roble" and "love Roble" outside
the hall before leaving the
Farm.
