big "C" Monday night, were made at
the Bonfire smoker, which was held

Five men will sleep near the fire

ed to stand guard at various times.
A warning signal of three blasts from

tions of the bonfire, and Jeeb Hala
by, committee chairman, gave de
tailed instruction for its construc
tion.
Hallaby plans to have this year's
bonfire the largest in history. The
work on the foundations will start
today with 25 frosh construction
team captains directing from 1 to 6
o'clock. This will leave as little ma
terial as possible for incendiary Cal
ifomians to attempt to demolish it
tonight.
Highly combustible material will
be added to the framework by as
many freshmen as do not have to at
tend classes from 8 to 12 o'clock
Thursday. From noon on every frosh
man will help with the construction.
Roble women will serve lunch and
provide transportation from Encina
to Lagunita lake bed for the workers,
and it is declared that nobody but
lazy slackers will eat lunch in En
cina Thursday. Men are encouraged
to work for a big fire and not in order
to show off for the spectators from
Roble. The finishing touches to the
big blaze will be 400 gallons of oil
and a number of rockets.
