By the papers I see that we have
another pair of proud parents, pro
genitors of a two-year-old girl who
already smokes cigars regularly.
Mamma and papa must get a lot of
fun out of daughter's cute tricks. No
doubt their greatest hour of triumph
is when company arrives, when papa
can hand her a cigar and hook his
thumbs in his suspenders with a "See
there, I told you so" attitude while
daughter goes through all the mo
tions to astonish the visitors.
But maybe I am not reporting any
thing remarkable at all, for there
seem to be quite a few children who
have mastered the art. Maybe it
would be news only if the cigar at
he age of two started smoking the
i hild.
In fact, a hasty gander at the news
i eels and the educational pages of
(he American Weekly would almost
t onvince the gullible person that a
\ 'hole lot of children are the subject
<<' strange experiments performed on
them by their parents, all the way
i'i om putting their children in the
s:;.me baby buggy with an infant
oiang-utang for the purposes of
scientific investigation to taking jun
i(j • along with mamma while she
m ikes the I'ounds of the pubs on a
turday night.
* "h *
3ut then the children who are
: • rificed on the altar of their par
is' insane desire to exhibit their
children as freaks are, after all, few
in eed, and the great number of
yo ingsters who need pity are those
v/. >se parents have wished only
mi lor cases upon them. Like keep
in; the little boy in curls forever
jr. because he was supposed to
hae been a girl, or wishing on some
little girl the monstrous name of
Roe-Petal, Honey, Pansy, Petunia,
or, for that matter, Prudence, Faith,
or '.-lope.
\7hen it comes to naming little
bo.s, the juvenile male may be beat
< n before he starts with a name like
Archibald, Oscar, Percy or Pre

son Evan Evans or Richard Richards
is nothing less than a thug who hit
the poor kid with a rabbit punch be
foi • the boy had chance to put up
hih dukes.
I guess I should stop shedding
ctt.codile tears for the fate of kids
wi.h funny names, youngsters who
do not concern me, but before I go
I cannot help but wonder if the
mothers in the recent Canadian der
by instead of naming their children

with ordinary names, should not
have named the babies, in order of
appearance, Fifty-thousand, Hun
dred-thousand, and so on until the
last, who would be called Pay-off.
With names like that the kids
should always be reminded that they
are no ordinary children, and that it
was not love nor the stork or any
thing like that which brought them
on earth, but rather their parents'
overwhelming lust for coin of the
realm.

By the papers I see that we have
another pair of proud parents, pro
genitors of a two-year-old girl who
already smokes cigars regularly.
Mamma and papa must get a lot of
fun out of daughter's cute tricks. No
doubt their greatest hour of triumph
is when company arrives, when papa
can hand her a cigar and hook his
thumbs in his suspenders with a "See
there, I told you so" attitude while
daughter goes through all the mo
tions to astonish the visitors.
But maybe I am not reporting any
thing remarkable at all, for there
seem to be quite a few children who
have mastered the art. Maybe it
would be news only if the cigar at
he age of two started smoking the
i hild.
In fact, a hasty gander at the news
