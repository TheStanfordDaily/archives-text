### 
How would Stanford students fare
in a car if an emergency arose?
This question was answered yes
terday morning wen A. D. Wilcox,
of the Johns-Manville Safety Drive,
drove his safety vehicle onto the
campus to test Farm students with
the Rcflex-O-Meter.
In comparison to other campuses,
Cardinal students would stand more
chance of wrapping themselves
around a telephone pole, according to
Willcox. He set the Stanford aver
age at stopping a car when the red
goes on at 0(5 hundredths of a
second, in comparison with .53 at
U.C.L.A., .58 at Colorado, .59 at
U.S.C., and .01 at San Diego State.
Seventy Stanfordites were tested
with the reflex contraption, only one
being a woman, and she scored the
second best reaction. Taking the nor
mal reactions, the average would
have been around .49, but a few
slow-witted or nervous individuals
took two or three seconds to apply
the brake after seeing the red light,
which brought the average up.
The normal time required for Mr.
Average Citizen in this test is .71,
and the record is held by Sir Mal
colm Campbell, world's greatest
speed ace. who turned in an average
of .25 for four tries.
