# Miller Expects Dismissal In Liquor Trial
## Robert Lowe Expected To Enter Guilty Plea In Answer To Allegation 
### 
Definite was the indication last
night that Frank J. Miller will be
dismissed today when he answers
to a charge of selling intoxicating
liquor to minors, while his bartender,
Robert Lowe, will plead guilty to the
allegation and be sentenced.
Jusice of the Peace Edward Hardy,
who is scheduled to preside at the
trial in Palo Alto, declared that a
defense motion for the directed ver
diet of acquittal would probably be
upheld in Miller's case. If this does
occur, it will be for the second time
within the last three weeks, as Miller
was freed last October 29 of the same
charge in the same manner.
Lowe, on the other hand, faces a
fine, a prison sentence, or both, if
he enters a guilty plea as expected.
Miller and Lowe were arrested last
month by officers of the State Board
of Equalization. The trial is set to
begin at 9 o'clock in the Palo Alto
Police Department building.
