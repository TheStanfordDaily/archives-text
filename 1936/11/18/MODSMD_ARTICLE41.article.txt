Tomorrow you boys will go to |
work on the Bonfire.
The Big Game Bonfire at Stanford
is more than just a pile of junk that
your burn up at night and warm
your fingers on, and it is more than
the big conflagration that you see
poorly reproduced in the papers the
next day.
To some of the more masculine
men at Stanford, the Bonfire is
without question the outstanding
event of their frosh year.
When sinking back to look at it,
first thing that comes to mind if the
actual getting close to the ground.
In spite of the fact that outsiders
call Stanford a capitalistic old dump,
most of us are pretty fair country
woodsmen, ditchdiggers, scavengers,
carpenters, laborers in general, but
we never get a chance at these forms
of activity except once a year. That
once, '40, is tomorrow.
After musing over the day of ac
tually doing a little profitable phys
ical labor—hauling in the fuel, hoist
ing it up into position, tying it
down, nailing up the sides—a full
day of sweat and grime—the veter
an remembers that sensation of see
ing the site early in the morning, a
hopeless task to fill it all in, and
watching the thing grow on and up
all day till at night it seems unbe
lievable that a bunch of kids could
do it all in one day.
Then there is the guard duty, to
keep Cal from prematurely burning
the masterpiece down, with the
boiler room whistle ready for use in
any emergency.
At night comes the Pavilion rally,
and they haul Cal's coffin on top of
the pyre, and they set fire to it. The
band plays, they lead a few yells,
and the students and hundreds of
townsfolk and old grads that have
gathered for the occasion stop to
think.
