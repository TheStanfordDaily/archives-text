# CLASS OF '03— THEY HAD A GOOD ONE
## 
### 
Yes, Frosh, you've got a job to
morrow. The bonfire is one of the
oldest and greatest of Stanford tradi
tions, one of the strongest bonds that
prevents divorce between the auto
mobiled and gabardined men of to
day, and the ruff-necked, plug
uglied men of the past.
It is the one chante for the Fresh
man Class to compete with classes of
other years—you can say your ball
team won a lot of games, but they
can refute that because the opposi
tion changes from year to year. But
Bonfire standards do not change
from year to year; there are good
bonfires and there are plenty of poor
ones, depending entirely on the in
terest and caliber of that year's En
cina residents.
I was talking to Tiny Thornhill,
and as much as anyone else, he
wants no pussy-footing about this
year's bonfire. Says he, "Everybody
knows what a job we have on hand
this year to beat California, and how
this year's team wins as much with
spirit as it does with ability. All the
Pavilion rallies in a year don't stack
up to one good bonfire in unifying
Ihe players, students, and alumni for
the Big Test Saturday."
"I made more friends the day we
built our fire than all the rest of the
year put together," says Bobby
Grayson. "Stanford has as good co
operation from townspeople and as
good a site as any school anywhere,
so with proper freshman spirit and
interest we could easily have the
biggest and best Bonfire ever built."
Halaby's made all the arrange
ments, and the gals'll be there with
food and encouragement. All that's
needed, then, is man power, in old
clothes.
How about that, Frosh? Will you
be there?
