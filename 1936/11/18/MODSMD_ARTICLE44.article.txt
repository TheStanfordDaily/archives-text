# Tiny Stresses Passwork In Grid Practice
## Coach Elated Over 10-9 Odds for Cal; Indians Best When Underdogs 
### 
Chief of Staff Tiny Thornhill has
been pretty busy scanning the ozone
over the football front these days,
after first having scanned the 1936
game schedule.
Most of his orders have to do with
polishing and grooming the wings of
his Big Red Machine, for no
chances can be taken against Stub
Allison's outfit, considering it now
amounts to nothing shox - t of a "Fly
ing Circus."
Passing Stressed
But this much, nevertheless, is
certain: victory in the Big Game will
doubtless go to the squadron whose
aerial maneuvers are fastest and
most effective. The Bears' three con
ference victories this year came
about largely as a result of aerial
raids. Of Stanford's two triumphs,
the same might well be said.
The fact that betting odds were
10-9 for the Californians, and in
some quarters 10-8. last night wor
ries Tiny not a bit. In truth, he's al
most elated. It has always been his
contention that his charges fight
harder and more relentlessly when
they play the part of the underdog.
Injuries Vanish
Now that Pop Grant's suspected
rib fracture has turned out to be
only a bruise, the threat of injuries
has vanished from the Indian strong
hold. With all the warriors feeling
chipper, the first string lined up the
same as usu&l.
The only pupbability of change be
fore game time lies in the backfield,
where Fred Williams has been taking
over Joe Vigna's spot at right half,
and Tony Calvelli and Jake Brigham
have been used interchangeably at
full.
No Scrimmage for Bears
Over in Berkeley, Allison, firmly
believing there is danger in scrim
mage work, has decreed no scrim
mage this week for his Besrs. Fur
ther indicative that a very wide open
game is in store for ticket-holders is
the fact that Stub nas been spending
a full half of each workout on pass
defense and attack.
The biggest mob in years will wit
ness the traditional clash. Late yes
terday afternoon Ticket Manager
Harry Davis ordered the installation
of exactly 942 additional bleacher
seats, and 1440 more seats will be
placed on the floor of the stadium
between the parapet and the side
lines.
Approximately 200 ducats were
still available at the BA.C. ticket
office yesterday.

same as usu&l.
The only pupbability of change be
fore game time lies in the backfield,
where Fred Williams has been taking
over Joe Vigna's spot at right half,
and Tony Calvelli and Jake Brigham
have been used interchangeably at
full.
No Scrimmage for Bears
Over in Berkeley, Allison, firmly
believing there is danger in scrim
mage work, has decreed no scrim
mage this week for his Besrs. Fur
ther indicative that a very wide open
game is in store for ticket-holders is
the fact that Stub nas been spending
a full half of each workout on pass
defense and attack.
The biggest mob in years will wit
ness the traditional clash. Late yes
terday afternoon Ticket Manager
Harry Davis ordered the installation
of exactly 942 additional bleacher
seats, and 1440 more seats will be
placed on the floor of the stadium
between the parapet and the side
lines.
Approximately 200 ducats were
still available at the BA.C. ticket
office yesterday.
Chief of Staff Tiny Thornhill has
been pretty busy scanning the ozone
over the football front these days,
after first having scanned the 1936
game schedule.
Most of his orders have to do with
polishing and grooming the wings of
his Big Red Machine, for no
chances can be taken against Stub
Allison's outfit, considering it now
amounts to nothing shox - t of a "Fly
ing Circus."
Passing Stressed
But this much, nevertheless, is
certain: victory in the Big Game will
doubtless go to the squadron whose
aerial maneuvers are fastest and
most effective. The Bears' three con
ference victories this year came
about largely as a result of aerial
raids. Of Stanford's two triumphs,
the same might well be said.
The fact that betting odds were
10-9 for the Californians, and in
some quarters 10-8. last night wor
ries Tiny not a bit. In truth, he's al
most elated. It has always been his
contention that his charges fight
harder and more relentlessly when
they play the part of the underdog.
Injuries Vanish
Now that Pop Grant's suspected
rib fracture has turned out to be
only a bruise, the threat of injuries
has vanished from the Indian strong
hold. With all the warriors feeling
chipper, the first string lined up the
same as usu&l.
