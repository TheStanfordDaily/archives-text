# Stanford Soccer Men Meet Bears
## Coach Maloney Planning Comeback Saturday 
### 
California proved last Saturday
that its current soccer team was the
strongest in the past 10 years, but
unabashed Stanford will have at it
again this week-end in an effort to
balance matters for the season.
The Bears turned on real scoring
steam in whipping the Cards 2-0, but
Coach Harry Maloney swears by the
"where there's life, there's hope"
theory. He recognizes California's
strength and is therefore drilling his
men more intensively than ever.
Last night the squad worked on
fundamentals, while Wednesday and
Thursday nights the plan is for stiff
scrimmages. Maloney was particu
larly enthusiastic over the fine play
of his defense men. It was their ag
gressiveness that kept the Cal for
wards firing from long range. He in
tends to devote special attention in
practice to the front line to try and
avoid further missing of good scor
ing chances.
There will be two games at Ber
keley Saturday morning. Besides
the varsity, the Stanford frosh will
attempt to make it two in a row over
the Bear Cubs. They turned in a neat
3-2 win in the first meeting and at 9
o'clock Saturday clash again in the
preliminary game.
