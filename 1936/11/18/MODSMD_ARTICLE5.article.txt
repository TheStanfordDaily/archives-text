## 
### 
John Hewitt, Encina sopho
more, has been chosen by Uni
versal Studios to play a role in
"The Road Back," the com
pany's sequel to "All Quiet on
the Western Front." Hewitt
won out in competition with 50
college students selected for
screen tests after hundreds had
been interviewed in the recent
talent quest.
Stanford's cinematic fame
brightened accordingly, with
the possibility that Hewitt may
equal the achievements of a
certain Pomona student, en
rolled as Spangler Arlington
Brugh, but given the flicker
name of Robert Taylor.
