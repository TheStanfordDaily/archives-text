# Card Tankmen To Meet at Berkeley In Tilt Saturday
## Close Win Expected In Indian, Bear Battle For Water Polo Crown 
### 
Two teams with almost identical
records will be dodging in and out
of the waves of the Berkeley Plunge
Saturday morning when the Indian
and Bear water poloists battle for
the Pacific Cuast Conference cham
pionship.
Nort Thornton's varsity amphib
ians will enter the fray slight fa
vorites to whip the Golden Bear and
annex the Coast crown, but if A1
Dowden's aquatic warriors pull
through victorious, the championship
will be decided when the two teams
meet on the Farm Tuesday after
noon.
Cards Lead Cal
The Card water dogs hold two
wins over U.C.L.A. and two over
U.S.C. in conference play, amassing
a total of 33 points to their opponents'

Bruins, but lost the second argument
with their younger cousins, scoring
a total of 38 points to their opposi

Jack Murrietta's frosh water dogs
will plunge into the Berkeley tank
at 10 a.m. in the preliminary Satur

here in the preliminary at 3:30 Tues
day afternoon.
Papooses Favored
