Simple historical fact: There has been friction
between the Paly theater management and the
Stanford students over the matter of the Con
valescent Home charity shows and the Pajama
rino fracas.
Simple social fact: Stanfordites like to go to
the show, but not at 40-cent prices.
Simple economic fact: The Paly theater man
agement seems to be filling the theater whether
the students like it or not.
Simple political fact: We don't know what
to do about it.
The idea of a boycott seems to be dropped,
at least temporarily. So far, we have received a
pretty good consensus of opinion that some
thing should be done, but nobody knows just
what. The committee has succeeded pretty well
in organizing the opinion of the women. And
Women's Conference exists as a handy instru
ment for further crystallizing sentiment.
However, nobody knows what the men think
about it, and it is imperative in an affair of this
kind to have unified student opinion. There
seems to be no way to get at the men, except
by Ex Committee's plan to have a meeting of
heads of men's groups, corresponding in or
ganization with the Women's Conference. We
have needed a group of this kind for some time
for plumbing the depths of student feeling.
Everyone has said that the student body feels
thus and so about different issues, but nobody
his ever known. The meeting of the men in
the Union lobby at 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
should be a definite step in democratizing stu
dent government as well as a sensible move
toward working out a practicable theater prob
lem solution.
Realizing that there have been wrongs on
both sides, Stanford students should be able
to approach the theater management with defi
nite, concrete offers toward removing the ob
jections of the theater managers to the Pajama
rino rally, toward compromise for cheaper bal
cony seats, and they should be able to approach
the management with the assurance that stu
dent opinion is behind them.
