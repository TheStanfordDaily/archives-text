The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with interest the campaign
for a nitery, and though exceedingly enthusiastic over
the idea, I have refrained until now from contributing
my two cents worth; however, I am wondering, espe
cially after the statements of President Wilbur and Mr.
Eisenbach, whether a slightly different point of view
on this whole affair might not be at least interesting.
Last year I was a freshman at a small school in the
southern part of this state, and, upon coming here
Ihis year, noticed, among other things, the comparative
lack of means whereby the men and women might get
acquainted. Quite obviously the jolly-ups arc for many
reasons inadequate for this purpose. Now, at this col
lege the tendency was to remain on campus.
* » * *
But there was another factor which entered into
this social business, and that was an institution which
was, in effect if not in structure, a Nitery. The need
was filled by the local "Sugar Bowl," ice cream parlor
do luxe. Due to the fact that it was a soda-fountain
and not a school subsidiary, the basic point of view of
the students was from the outset somewhat different;
too, there were no competitive distractions; no Millers',
and local functions on the week-ends lessened the call
< r the Big City. But I think that what we had there
we could very well have here, in time.
The Bowl was not just a substitute for some more
a 1 tractive spot to spend the evening, something which
the Nitery is in danger of becoming. It was a place to
drop into at any time for a bite to eat after an eve
ning's study. Consequently the thought of dating was
rot necessarily uppermost in the students' minds, and
a large percentage of patronage was in the form of
groups of stags and the feminine counterpart.
• * # *
It was a congenial spot to gather, and the sight of
an unaccompanied female or male did not immediately
indicate a pick-up. The feature of the Bowl, and the
imo feature which has lieen plugged so consistently
in the present campaign, was that the Bowl was com
pleted with a room and radio-phonograph for dancing.
And there you had a perfect set-up: close enough to

walk to without the slightest need of other means of
transportation, dancing, a coke, malt, or what have you,
and a completely informal and convivial atmosphere.
The results which were derived were exactly those
which the Nitery is desirous of attaining: it was a sub
stitute for other more distant, more expensive places
and it provided an opportunity to get acquainted with
that nice-looking gal across the aisle.
All the questions mutually (and privately) asked
before a first date could be answered for the price of
two cokes (10c): can she (he) dance, talk, and so on.
The difference between a similar set-up in the Cellar
here was the fact that one could dance.
The Bowl was just as much, if not more after the
first month or two of school, for carrying on a friend
ship of long or longer standing. What such an evening
lacked in glitter or glamour it made up in intimacy
and convenience. Of course this was a small school,
and perhaps Stanford inmates are too, too sophisticated
to enjoy such simple pleasures. It must be admitted
that those in attendance amused themselves rather
than were amused; I have been wondering if the apathy
to jolly-ups and to the Nitery is not from that very
thing: Indians expect to be entertained without making
any contributions themselves.
* * * *
As long as the idea is dinned into the undergrad
uates' heads that the Nitery is a place to go at any time,
and purely for his own relaxation, not merely a place
where dates end up when the exchequer is for the
time being inoperative, then you will have a Nitery
that will last.
How is this point of view to be gotten across? For
one thing, just plain ballyhoo, pure out-and-out ad
vertisement. And for a second, place the Nitery some
where on the campus so that it can be reached afoot
without setting out with pack mules and a compass.

And there you had a perfect set-up: close enough to

walk to without the slightest need of other means of
transportation, dancing, a coke, malt, or what have you,
and a completely informal and convivial atmosphere.
The results which were derived were exactly those
which the Nitery is desirous of attaining: it was a sub
stitute for other more distant, more expensive places
and it provided an opportunity to get acquainted with
that nice-looking gal across the aisle.
All the questions mutually (and privately) asked
before a first date could be answered for the price of
two cokes (10c): can she (he) dance, talk, and so on.
The difference between a similar set-up in the Cellar
here was the fact that one could dance.
The Bowl was just as much, if not more after the
first month or two of school, for carrying on a friend
ship of long or longer standing. What such an evening
lacked in glitter or glamour it made up in intimacy
and convenience. Of course this was a small school,
and perhaps Stanford inmates are too, too sophisticated
to enjoy such simple pleasures. It must be admitted
that those in attendance amused themselves rather
than were amused; I have been wondering if the apathy
to jolly-ups and to the Nitery is not from that very
thing: Indians expect to be entertained without making
any contributions themselves.
* * * *
As long as the idea is dinned into the undergrad
uates' heads that the Nitery is a place to go at any time,
and purely for his own relaxation, not merely a place
where dates end up when the exchequer is for the
time being inoperative, then you will have a Nitery
that will last.
How is this point of view to be gotten across? For
one thing, just plain ballyhoo, pure out-and-out ad
vertisement. And for a second, place the Nitery some
where on the campus so that it can be reached afoot
without setting out with pack mules and a compass.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with interest the campaign
for a nitery, and though exceedingly enthusiastic over
the idea, I have refrained until now from contributing
my two cents worth; however, I am wondering, espe
cially after the statements of President Wilbur and Mr.
Eisenbach, whether a slightly different point of view
on this whole affair might not be at least interesting.
Last year I was a freshman at a small school in the
southern part of this state, and, upon coming here
Ihis year, noticed, among other things, the comparative
lack of means whereby the men and women might get
acquainted. Quite obviously the jolly-ups arc for many
reasons inadequate for this purpose. Now, at this col
lege the tendency was to remain on campus.

But there was another factor which entered into
this social business, and that was an institution which
was, in effect if not in structure, a Nitery. The need
was filled by the local "Sugar Bowl," ice cream parlor
do luxe. Due to the fact that it was a soda-fountain
and not a school subsidiary, the basic point of view of
the students was from the outset somewhat different;
too, there were no competitive distractions; no Millers',
and local functions on the week-ends lessened the call
< r the Big City. But I think that what we had there
we could very well have here, in time.
The Bowl was not just a substitute for some more
a 1 tractive spot to spend the evening, something which
the Nitery is in danger of becoming. It was a place to
drop into at any time for a bite to eat after an eve
ning's study. Consequently the thought of dating was
rot necessarily uppermost in the students' minds, and
a large percentage of patronage was in the form of
groups of stags and the feminine counterpart.

It was a congenial spot to gather, and the sight of
an unaccompanied female or male did not immediately
indicate a pick-up. The feature of the Bowl, and the

the idea, I have refrained until now from contributing
my two cents worth; however, I am wondering, espe
cially after the statements of President Wilbur and Mr.
Eisenbach, whether a slightly different point of view
on this whole affair might not be at least interesting.
Last year I was a freshman at a small school in the
southern part of this state, and, upon coming here
Ihis year, noticed, among other things, the comparative
lack of means whereby the men and women might get
acquainted. Quite obviously the jolly-ups arc for many
reasons inadequate for this purpose. Now, at this col
lege the tendency was to remain on campus.

But there was another factor which entered into
this social business, and that was an institution which
was, in effect if not in structure, a Nitery. The need
was filled by the local "Sugar Bowl," ice cream parlor
do luxe. Due to the fact that it was a soda-fountain
and not a school subsidiary, the basic point of view of
the students was from the outset somewhat different;
too, there were no competitive distractions; no Millers',
and local functions on the week-ends lessened the call
< r the Big City. But I think that what we had there
we could very well have here, in time.
The Bowl was not just a substitute for some more
a 1 tractive spot to spend the evening, something which
the Nitery is in danger of becoming. It was a place to
drop into at any time for a bite to eat after an eve
ning's study. Consequently the thought of dating was
rot necessarily uppermost in the students' minds, and
a large percentage of patronage was in the form of
groups of stags and the feminine counterpart.

It was a congenial spot to gather, and the sight of
an unaccompanied female or male did not immediately
indicate a pick-up. The feature of the Bowl, and the
imo feature which has lieen plugged so consistently
in the present campaign, was that the Bowl was com
pleted with a room and radio-phonograph for dancing.
And there you had a perfect set-up: close enough to

walk to without the slightest need of other means of
transportation, dancing, a coke, malt, or what have you,
and a completely informal and convivial atmosphere.
The results which were derived were exactly those
which the Nitery is desirous of attaining: it was a sub
stitute for other more distant, more expensive places
and it provided an opportunity to get acquainted with
that nice-looking gal across the aisle.
All the questions mutually (and privately) asked
before a first date could be answered for the price of
two cokes (10c): can she (he) dance, talk, and so on.
The difference between a similar set-up in the Cellar
here was the fact that one could dance.
The Bowl was just as much, if not more after the
first month or two of school, for carrying on a friend
ship of long or longer standing. What such an evening
lacked in glitter or glamour it made up in intimacy
and convenience. Of course this was a small school,
and perhaps Stanford inmates are too, too sophisticated
to enjoy such simple pleasures. It must be admitted
that those in attendance amused themselves rather
than were amused; I have been wondering if the apathy
to jolly-ups and to the Nitery is not from that very
thing: Indians expect to be entertained without making
any contributions themselves.

As long as the idea is dinned into the undergrad
uates' heads that the Nitery is a place to go at any time,
and purely for his own relaxation, not merely a place
where dates end up when the exchequer is for the
time being inoperative, then you will have a Nitery
that will last.
How is this point of view to be gotten across? For
one thing, just plain ballyhoo, pure out-and-out ad
vertisement. And for a second, place the Nitery some
where on the campus so that it can be reached afoot
without setting out with pack mules and a compass.
