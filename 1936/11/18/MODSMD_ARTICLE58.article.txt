PLEASE WRITE MY MOM—FOR SOME
MORE DEMOCRACY
There are 4000-odd mouths at Stanford, but only two
languages.
One language is spoken only by people who work in
the Ad Building. And they know many nice, long
words. There's one that is subject and predicate for
all parents. It is "Democracy."
"Money means nothing here," Ad-ders tell parents.
"Three hundred is absolutely sufficient per quarter."
* * * *
The other voice is that of the cash register. It says:
"Money is everything here. Ten dollars for senior ball
bids please, $5 for the Quad please, $1.25 for a decent
seat to the Gaieties, and better make it snappy."
"Stanford is not a rich man's school," says one.
"Pay your green fee before you play," says the
other.
"A Stanford education is really inexpensive."
"Two dollars to hear Meisle."
* * * *
Frankly, we need an interpreter. We. never could
understand an adding machine. But since the day
when mom crowed over a paean to Stanford's incomp
arable cheapness, we listened to few prepared programs
in our mother tongue that were not preceded by a
flood of strange accents echoing from the counting
house and it's denizens.
♦ * * *
Of course, it's all right. We realize that nice things
cost money. And we're willing to pay, when we have
it. But we think that mom ought to get a letter that
Lists some of the expenses good Stanford students must
meet.
Not that it's necessary to go to the Gaieties or the
Senior Ball. We could well afford to sit home with
"Gone with the Wind" Friday. But the point is, our
sitting at home would be undemocratic. And the Lord
knows a good Stanford student must mix with his
fellows to realize the assurance of those Ad Building
letters to mom. .
* * * *
After all, fellows, we can't let the Administration
down by not being able to afford Democracy, can we?
And we won't let the Administration down, will
we! But personally, I need the Administration's co
operation.
I want them to send another letter to mom listing
a few of the Democratic things I ought to do this
quarter. Then, maybe she'll send me a check to cover
them.
I don't care what the letter says, other than that list.
But I strongly suggest the wording is in the right
language, so mom, who doesn't understand adding
machines either, will know that these expenses are en
tirely justified—that they are strictly to support stu
dent Democracy.
See?

The other voice is that of the cash register. It says:
"Money is everything here. Ten dollars for senior ball
bids please, $5 for the Quad please, $1.25 for a decent
seat to the Gaieties, and better make it snappy."
"Stanford is not a rich man's school," says one.
"Pay your green fee before you play," says the
other.
"A Stanford education is really inexpensive."
"Two dollars to hear Meisle."

Frankly, we need an interpreter. We. never could
understand an adding machine. But since the day
when mom crowed over a paean to Stanford's incomp
arable cheapness, we listened to few prepared programs
in our mother tongue that were not preceded by a
flood of strange accents echoing from the counting
house and it's denizens.

Of course, it's all right. We realize that nice things
cost money. And we're willing to pay, when we have
it. But we think that mom ought to get a letter that
Lists some of the expenses good Stanford students must
meet.
Not that it's necessary to go to the Gaieties or the
Senior Ball. We could well afford to sit home with
"Gone with the Wind" Friday. But the point is, our
sitting at home would be undemocratic. And the Lord
knows a good Stanford student must mix with his
fellows to realize the assurance of those Ad Building
letters to mom. .

After all, fellows, we can't let the Administration
down by not being able to afford Democracy, can we?
And we won't let the Administration down, will
we! But personally, I need the Administration's co
operation.
I want them to send another letter to mom listing
a few of the Democratic things I ought to do this
quarter. Then, maybe she'll send me a check to cover
them.
I don't care what the letter says, other than that list.
But I strongly suggest the wording is in the right
language, so mom, who doesn't understand adding
machines either, will know that these expenses are en
tirely justified—that they are strictly to support stu
dent Democracy.

There are 4000-odd mouths at Stanford, but only two
languages.
One language is spoken only by people who work in
the Ad Building. And they know many nice, long
words. There's one that is subject and predicate for
all parents. It is "Democracy."
"Money means nothing here," Ad-ders tell parents.
"Three hundred is absolutely sufficient per quarter."
