# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
The guy who calls up the sorority houses on the
telephone and says, "Boogey-boogey," is not doing it
to get in Our Hasher, he indignantly asserts. The
hoarse and boogey voice called me up last night and
told me so himself.
Boogey is just another one of these boys who got
too stiff a dose of this statistical civilization. When any
body wants to prove anything these days so that he
can get his degree and thereby prove his profundity
of knowledge, he goes out and makes a survey. Any
thing can be proven by such a survey except that the
survey is right. To prove the validity of this survey,
another survey must be taken. By this time the one
who is reading the thesis is beginning to worry about
the telephone bill, and his eye starts to wander, and
he's proved his point.
Anyway, this boogey-boogey act was for a serious,
statistical purpose. The earnest young man reports that
he wanted to find out which sorority on the campus was
the most friendly when called over the telephone.
After checking and counter-checking, making cor
relations and deriving coefficients, computing probable
error, and working out the Bell telephone curve, he
discovered these salient facts: The Kappatalists, of all
people, were the friendliest. The Chi O's checked in
second, reporting at the same time that there were 14
pledges to the Bombay chapter; the Pi Phis were a
close third, making up in resonance and tonal quality
what they lacked in Enthusiasm.
With just a touch of reproach, hoarse and boogey
announced that, the Thetas were the only house that
failed to respond.
Every house, Boogey-boogey reports, was prac
tically hysterical in rushing to answer the phone. The
Thetas were the quickest to answer, he said, and the
quickest to hang up.
Nobody knows where Boogey-boogey hangs out.
Weaver was accused at first but he was exonerated.
The Kappas are reported to have sounded pretty silly
when they called up several fraternities and said
"Boogey-boogey" in an effort to catch the culprit. When
somebody called up the Kappa Sig house, a voice said
"Boogey-boogey," immediately corrected it to "Kappa
Sig." which some would say is no correction at all.
Credence to the rumor that Boogey-boogey travels
in a gang was lent by his own statement to Our Hasher
last night, when he denied rumors to his whereabouts
by the categorical: "We may be crazy, but we're not
Betas."

told me so himself.
Boogey is just another one of these boys who got
too stiff a dose of this statistical civilization. When any
body wants to prove anything these days so that he
can get his degree and thereby prove his profundity
of knowledge, he goes out and makes a survey. Any
thing can be proven by such a survey except that the
survey is right. To prove the validity of this survey,
another survey must be taken. By this time the one
who is reading the thesis is beginning to worry about
the telephone bill, and his eye starts to wander, and
he's proved his point.
Anyway, this boogey-boogey act was for a serious,
statistical purpose. The earnest young man reports that
he wanted to find out which sorority on the campus was
the most friendly when called over the telephone.
After checking and counter-checking, making cor
relations and deriving coefficients, computing probable
error, and working out the Bell telephone curve, he
discovered these salient facts: The Kappatalists, of all
people, were the friendliest. The Chi O's checked in
second, reporting at the same time that there were 14
pledges to the Bombay chapter; the Pi Phis were a
close third, making up in resonance and tonal quality
what they lacked in Enthusiasm.
With just a touch of reproach, hoarse and boogey
announced that, the Thetas were the only house that
failed to respond.
Every house, Boogey-boogey reports, was prac
tically hysterical in rushing to answer the phone. The
Thetas were the quickest to answer, he said, and the
quickest to hang up.
Nobody knows where Boogey-boogey hangs out.
Weaver was accused at first but he was exonerated.
The Kappas are reported to have sounded pretty silly
when they called up several fraternities and said
"Boogey-boogey" in an effort to catch the culprit. When
somebody called up the Kappa Sig house, a voice said
"Boogey-boogey," immediately corrected it to "Kappa
Sig." which some would say is no correction at all.
Credence to the rumor that Boogey-boogey travels
in a gang was lent by his own statement to Our Hasher
last night, when he denied rumors to his whereabouts
by the categorical: "We may be crazy, but we're not
Betas."
The guy who calls up the sorority houses on the
telephone and says, "Boogey-boogey," is not doing it
to get in Our Hasher, he indignantly asserts. The
hoarse and boogey voice called me up last night and
told me so himself.
