HEADS AND TALES," by Mal
vina "Hoffman. Charles Scribner's
Sons, $5.
When Malvina Hoffman placed her
101 life-size bronzes showing the
races of the world in the Field Mu
seum's Hall of Man, the scientific
and artistic world acclaimed her for
her contribution to ethnology and
sculpture; the laymen wanted more
of this person. Her book, then, is not
a footnote or a complement to a
work needing neither, but simply the
story behind an achievement.
There is nothing exceptional in
style or presentation in this auto
biography, but when an enjoyable
and successful artist reminisces it
cannot help being readable.
Malvina Hoffman's life is a com
posite picture of a pianist's home in
lurid Forty - third - and - Broadway
atmosphere during the time of Lil
lian Russell and saloons, studying
under Rodin in Paris on the "left
bank," learning of Mestrovic, the
Slav, to work with her "soul as well
as her hands," working in the Bal
kans after the war in food dispen
saries under Hoover. After six years
of interpreting Pavlowa, Nijinsky,
Mordkin dances in bronze and ac
quiring a clientele for portraits, she
left New York, went in 1926 to Af
rica. It was here that she got the
material for the later African race
groups, and evolved her "Senegalese
Tom-tom Player," a 6-foot-3-inch
bronze, granted by many to be the
best thing in her collection.

In 1930 she was commissioned by
the Field Museum in Chicago to
make her studies of the races of man,
and for five years toured the remote
corners of the world for material.
As she says, the Tasmanian race is
the only one she did not represent
because "they had died out through
obeying the seventh commandment.
Thank goodness, because they were
so ugly!"
Although a good two-thirds of
her book is devoted to the adven
tures of these years, her first sections
on "Making of a Sculptor" in which
she tells of her father, Richard Hoff
man, the pianist-contemporary of
Jenny Lind, her friendships with
Paderewski, to whom the book is
dedicated, with Pavlowa, Rodin, the
Drapers, ax - e essentially memoir-like.
Toward the end she reveals her
philosophy of a perfect artist, muses
on the characteristics of man, why
he differs among his races. Perhaps
this is the more worth-while part,
certainly the less entertaining.
The photographs of her works, by
Husband Sam Grimson, violinist, are
exceptionally fine, and add more
than mere illustration to her expo
sition.
"Heads and Tales" may or may
not be entertainment for the three
hours it takes to read it: the last half
will mean a lot to some, the first
half and the pictures should not be
missed.

When Malvina Hoffman placed her
101 life-size bronzes showing the
races of the world in the Field Mu
seum's Hall of Man, the scientific
and artistic world acclaimed her for
her contribution to ethnology and
sculpture; the laymen wanted more
of this person. Her book, then, is not
a footnote or a complement to a
work needing neither, but simply the
story behind an achievement.
There is nothing exceptional in
style or presentation in this auto
biography, but when an enjoyable
and successful artist reminisces it
cannot help being readable.
Malvina Hoffman's life is a com
posite picture of a pianist's home in
lurid Forty - third - and - Broadway
atmosphere during the time of Lil
lian Russell and saloons, studying
under Rodin in Paris on the "left
bank," learning of Mestrovic, the
Slav, to work with her "soul as well
as her hands," working in the Bal
kans after the war in food dispen
saries under Hoover. After six years
of interpreting Pavlowa, Nijinsky,
Mordkin dances in bronze and ac
quiring a clientele for portraits, she
left New York, went in 1926 to Af
rica. It was here that she got the
material for the later African race
groups, and evolved her "Senegalese
Tom-tom Player," a 6-foot-3-inch
bronze, granted by many to be the
best thing in her collection.

In 1930 she was commissioned by
the Field Museum in Chicago to
make her studies of the races of man,
and for five years toured the remote
corners of the world for material.
As she says, the Tasmanian race is
the only one she did not represent
because "they had died out through
obeying the seventh commandment.
Thank goodness, because they were
so ugly!"
Although a good two-thirds of
her book is devoted to the adven
tures of these years, her first sections
on "Making of a Sculptor" in which
she tells of her father, Richard Hoff
man, the pianist-contemporary of
Jenny Lind, her friendships with
Paderewski, to whom the book is
dedicated, with Pavlowa, Rodin, the
Drapers, ax - e essentially memoir-like.
Toward the end she reveals her
philosophy of a perfect artist, muses
on the characteristics of man, why
he differs among his races. Perhaps
this is the more worth-while part,
certainly the less entertaining.
The photographs of her works, by
Husband Sam Grimson, violinist, are
exceptionally fine, and add more
than mere illustration to her expo
sition.
