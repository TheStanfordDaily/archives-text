# CAMPUS OPINION
## REBELLION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The men of the Class of '40 have
revolted against the History of
Western Civilization. The night be
fore the mid-quarter ex, the men of
Encina leaned from their windows
and in a single voice chanted "To
hell with Western Civ." The text is
the most jumbled, unenglished the
ingenuity of Henry Elmer could con
coct. The Tuesday lectures are more
like lullabyes. Everyone sleeps.
Those v/ho remain awake lapse into
the most profound moods of ennui.
After the lecture is over, everyone
yawns and quickly forgets anything
they might have heard. The discus
sion groups are funny. Nothing is ac
complished. No matter what topic is
introduced, inevitably the tide of
talk turns to airing prejudices on
that notorious personage, William
Randolph Hearst.
Word is being passed through the
halls and almost everyone agrees,
"To heck with Western Civ." The
Class of '40 is thinking about mak
ing an issue of this: It dislikes this
fuller type of orientation course; it
dislikes the lectures, the sections,
and the unintelligible prose of
"Henry Elmer." The Class of '40 is
wondering if it would not be a good
idea to have History of Western Civ
ilization stricken out as a lower divi
sion requirement. Let those who
wish to brood over "the glory that
was Greece" and "the grandeur that
was Rome" sign up for the course,
but the Class of '40 is wondering
if it wouldn't be a good idea to have
it an optional course.
â€”Encina Inmate
