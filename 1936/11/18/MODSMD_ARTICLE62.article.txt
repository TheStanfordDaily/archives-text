# DEFENDS BAND

November 13, 1936
The Editor:
I object to the Dippy's misrepre
sentation of the reason why the
Stanford Band voted not to play at
the send-off rally last Thursday.
The band has one period a week, of
an hour and a half at most, to do all
of its preparation for marching at
the games. There is no other time
during the week at which there can
be the full attendance necessary.
Therefore a vote was taken on
whether the band should or should
not give up half its three remaining
hours of practice on the field for the
big game. It is not true, as your edi
torial inferred, that only seven
bandsmen were willing to play at the
rally.
Not (he least unfair part of the
affair is that the people who con

demned the band for not playing at
the rally were the same people who
condemned the band for inadequate
preparation when marching at the
games.
You may print the name, too.
Yours very truly,
Jack Hedden
