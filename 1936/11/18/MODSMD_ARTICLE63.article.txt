The Editor, Sir:
May I use this medium of express
ing my sincere thanks both to the
contestants and spectators alike,
present at the annual University
Novice Boxing Tournament held in
the Basketball Pavilion Thursday
night last? ,
The fine sportsmanship shown by
the contestants "even in the heat of
battle," so to speak, was indeed com
mendable. The conduct of the 600
or more spectators present fully con
vinced the writer, now serving his
twenty-eighth year in the service of
physical education and athletics here
at Stanford, that the Stanford stu
dent of today measures up very well
to the Stanford student of yesterday
and that one need not have any fear
for a continuation of clear thinking,
sound sportsmanship, and the high
ideals which stamps a Stanford man
the world over.
