### (Clipped by Phil Bernheim 
HAVE WE TOLI) YOU yet about
the swell tunes in this year's Gaie
ties? Hit of the show will undoubt
edly be Mac Gordon's novelty, "His
Excellency Cannot Be Disturbed."
Next to that, the best tune is "Picnic
in the Parlor," with a set of very
clever lyrics, but the boys and girls
in the gallery will probably go for
'"Tain't Wrong."
WHAT AN OVERLAY of make-up
some women use! The girl sitting
next to me in class the other day had
a clear line running down the side
of her neck and under her chin
marking the cleavage 'twixt her
made up face and her real self. It's
things like that, and ads for certain
articles of feminine apparel (the edi
tor won't let me mention them by
name), that tend to disillusion us
poor, complacent males.
EXPENSIVE CONCERT: The one
NBC gave telephone company en
gineers last Saturday between 10 and
10:10 p.m. when Eddie Fitzpatrick's
music went out over the Red net
work, but no station carried it.
KDYL picked the program up at 10
after.
(JOOD TUNE: That merry, rollick

ing number, "'Tain't Good" (don't
you believe a word of it!) . . . The i
Shell Chateau program is slated for
a shake-up, including giving the
bounce to Smith Ballew and the in
ception of Edward Everett Horton as
permanent m.c.
TIIE CROCHETED BATHTUB
goes to NBC for having the honor
of having the first car on the Bay
Bridge to run out of gas!
