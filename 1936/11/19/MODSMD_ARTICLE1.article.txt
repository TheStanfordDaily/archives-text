# U.C. 'Avengers' Threaten Wilbur Kidnap
## Cal Bombers Prepare For Aerial Attack Berkeleyites Ready With Tear Gas, Dynamite In 'Retaliation War' 
### 
Kidnap threats against President
Wilbur and a four-plane aerial at
tack on the Stanford campus and the
Palo Alto tree, using tear gas, incen
diary bombs and dynamite were!
voiced last night by University of
California students as "fitting re
taliation" for asserted Stanford out
rages on the Berkeley campus, the
Daily Californian reported.
Giving weight to the information
was the word of Ken Priestly, A.S.
U.C. manager, that he had purchased
$15 worth of tear gas bombs from a
student so they could not be used,
the U.C. Daily said.
YVillnir Issues Warning
Meanwhile, President Wilbur inti
mated that any demonstrations here
resulting in damage to University
property might result in cancellation
of the Big Game. His admonition
came on the heels of rumors that
two to three thousand U.C. students
were mobilizing ot descend on the
Farm.
Earlier yesterday A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Jim Reynolds wired official
apologies to the Daily Californian for
the Big "C" painting Tuesday, and
for the burned "S" in the lawn of
the California Memorial Stadium
yesterday morning.
Student Injured
One of three Big "C" guards, as
sertedly slugged by members of a
100-man raiding party in a riot on
"tightwad hill" on the Berkeley cam
pus, was believed suffering from a
possible skull fracture. He was Hoyt
O. Frost, sophomore. The two oth
ers, assertedly beaten into uncon
sciousness, were named as Arthur
Goodrich, freshman, and George
Karbone, sophomore. Frost was to
have been X-rayed last night at
Cowell Memorial Hospital to deter
mine the extent of his injuries.
The fact that a Big "S" appeared
in the stadium lawn yesterday morn
ing, assertedly burned in with gaso
line, added to U.C. campus tension.
Information received by the Daily
here indicated that the arsonists were
not Stanford freshmen. They are
said to have used five gallons of
gasoline to burn in an "S" 700 feet
square. U.C. authorities said it
would be impossible to replace the
sod before the Big Game.
Mutual Regret
Meanwhile, both Reynolds and
A.S.U.C. President Leonard Charvet
expressed regret over student riots.
While Charvet indicated the belief
that asserted Stanford student action
at U.C. was not without official ap
proval, he pleaded with Cal men not
to place the Big Game in jeopardy by
attempts at "revenge."
He could not, however, blame Ber
keley students for any retaliative at
tempts against asserted Stanford
outrages, Charvet is declared to have
said.
Included among these was the
theft of two mahogany bears stolen
from the Chi Phi house on the U.C.
campus and the loss of the handle
to the Big Game axe, yesterday
night, believed to have been stolen
from the Sigma Pi house, custodians
of the emblem since 1899.
Chi Psi house raiders, as they fled
with the wooden bears, arc said to
have threatened burning them on the
Big Game bonfire. The Daily yes
terday received a note signed "War
dens of the Handle," indicating the
axe-handle is on the campus here.

theft of two mahogany bears stolen
from the Chi Phi house on the U.C.
campus and the loss of the handle
to the Big Game axe, yesterday
night, believed to have been stolen
from the Sigma Pi house, custodians
of the emblem since 1899.
Chi Psi house raiders, as they fled
with the wooden bears, arc said to
have threatened burning them on the
Big Game bonfire. The Daily yes
terday received a note signed "War
dens of the Handle," indicating the
axe-handle is on the campus here.
Kidnap threats against President
Wilbur and a four-plane aerial at
tack on the Stanford campus and the
Palo Alto tree, using tear gas, incen
diary bombs and dynamite were!
voiced last night by University of
California students as "fitting re
taliation" for asserted Stanford out
rages on the Berkeley campus, the
Daily Californian reported.
Giving weight to the information
was the word of Ken Priestly, A.S.
U.C. manager, that he had purchased
$15 worth of tear gas bombs from a
student so they could not be used,
the U.C. Daily said.
YVillnir Issues Warning
Meanwhile, President Wilbur inti
mated that any demonstrations here
resulting in damage to University
property might result in cancellation
of the Big Game. His admonition
came on the heels of rumors that
two to three thousand U.C. students
were mobilizing ot descend on the
Farm.
Earlier yesterday A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Jim Reynolds wired official
apologies to the Daily Californian for
the Big "C" painting Tuesday, and
for the burned "S" in the lawn of
the California Memorial Stadium
yesterday morning.
Student Injured
One of three Big "C" guards, as
sertedly slugged by members of a
100-man raiding party in a riot on
"tightwad hill" on the Berkeley cam
pus, was believed suffering from a
possible skull fracture. He was Hoyt
O. Frost, sophomore. The two oth
ers, assertedly beaten into uncon
sciousness, were named as Arthur
Goodrich, freshman, and George
Karbone, sophomore. Frost was to
have been X-rayed last night at
Cowell Memorial Hospital to deter
mine the extent of his injuries.
The fact that a Big "S" appeared
in the stadium lawn yesterday morn
ing, assertedly burned in with gaso
line, added to U.C. campus tension.
Information received by the Daily
here indicated that the arsonists were
not Stanford freshmen. They are
said to have used five gallons of
gasoline to burn in an "S" 700 feet
square. U.C. authorities said it
would be impossible to replace the
sod before the Big Game.
Mutual Regret
Meanwhile, both Reynolds and
A.S.U.C. President Leonard Charvet
expressed regret over student riots.
While Charvet indicated the belief
that asserted Stanford student action
at U.C. was not without official ap
proval, he pleaded with Cal men not
to place the Big Game in jeopardy by
attempts at "revenge."
He could not, however, blame Ber
keley students for any retaliative at
tempts against asserted Stanford
outrages, Charvet is declared to have
said.
Included among these was the
theft of two mahogany bears stolen

campus and the loss of the handle
