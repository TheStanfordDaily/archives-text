# Wide Open Play Expected In Bear-Card Tussle Saturday
## Both Coaches Optimistic As Big Game Nears 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Houdini had a lot to learn. A
tropical hurricane is a zephyr. And
the Bay Bridge isn't a dazzling spec
tacle.
At least, those are some of the im
pressions being given these days by
Tiny Thornhill's stampeding Stan
fordites. The festivities on the prac
tice turf this week might be feebly
described as befuddling, dazzling,
razzle-dazzle, and radical. In short,
the Indians are winding up final
preparations for Saturday's Magni
tudinous Melee at Berkeley.
Offense Sky High
Sky-high — that's where Tiny has
blown the Cardinal offense, and
there it bids fair to stay. The stand
ard equipment usually seen on a
Wamcr-designcd gridiron machine
has been replaced by some varied
things that are, indeed, strange and
wonderful to behold.
Every day this week, the coaching
staff has added a few more new an
tics to the Redshirt attack, and
what's more, the innovations have
seemed to click right off the bat.
The result of all this is the fact
that nothing but the first-string
line-up remains of the old order, and
even that is subject to change.
Tiny Optimistic
And docs Tiny expected his radical
Rcdshrits to come through and rout
the Golden Bears? "Sure thing," is
the way he puts it. Betting odds are
now quoted at 10-8 for California,
but Thornhill will tell you the only
way this affects the situation is that
it will give the Farm warriors the
underdog's psychological advantage.
To many outfits, the advantage, such
as it is, might mean but little.
Experience, however, has prompt
ed Tiny to declare that his squad has
I already shown no little come
through ability this season in climb
ing to its present ranking. And his
faith in the boys has never waned.
In past years, Stanford has tri
umphed repeatedly when Cal was
more highly touted than now. This
year's aggregation can turn the trick,
too, Tiny opines in effect.
Stub Optimistic, Too
Last night in Berkeley, Stub Alli
son was apparently surer than ever
that his boys are going to give the
most inspired and brilliant per
formance Saturday of their some
what checkered career. And he
clings 4o this belief, despite that Ken
Cotton, Dave De Varona, and Milt
Pollack seem destined to remain on
the sick list and off the field this
week-end. There is a slight possi
bility that Tackles Dc Varona and
Pollack might get into shape for the
fracas ,but even Allison himself woe
fully admits that such is not the case
with Cotton, ace fullback.
Dave Anderson will probably be
billed to start in Cotton's spot. And
while Anderson may lack the expe
rience and defensive potency of the
injured one, he still is quite some
shucks in these parts. Allison has not
been scrimmaging his charges this
week. Instead he has turned to in
tensive pass defense and offense
drills.
Both he and Thornhill will ease up
somewhat on their respective crews
this afternoon and tomorrow. Here
on the Farm, the only injury that
may prove a handicap is that of
Fullback Glenn Hamilton. Hamilton
seems to be having more than a little
trouble with his weak leg, and Tiny
has announced that either Tony Cal
velli or Jake Brigham will start at
full. Hamilton, it seems, may be
used for a few minutes if he's feMing
fit.
The very tentative Cal line-up
reads something like this: Sparks and
Schwartz, ends; Nordstrom and Mc-
Ateer, tackles; Hanford or Evans,
and Stockton, guards; Herwig, cen
ter; Meek, quarter; Archer and
Chapman, halves; and Anderson, full.
The Indians' side of the Big Game
program will include: Stone and
Clark, ends; Callaway and Zagar.
tackles: Matthews and Forko, guards:
Tsoutsouvas, center; Hoos, quarter;
Coffis and Williams, halves; and
either Calvelli or Brigham, full.

may prove a handicap is that of
Fullback Glenn Hamilton. Hamilton
seems to be having more than a little
trouble with his weak leg, and Tiny
has announced that either Tony Cal
velli or Jake Brigham will start at
full. Hamilton, it seems, may be
used for a few minutes if he's feMing
fit.
The very tentative Cal line-up
reads something like this: Sparks and
Schwartz, ends; Nordstrom and Mc-
Ateer, tackles; Hanford or Evans,
and Stockton, guards; Herwig, cen
ter; Meek, quarter; Archer and
Chapman, halves; and Anderson, full.
The Indians' side of the Big Game
program will include: Stone and
Clark, ends; Callaway and Zagar.
tackles: Matthews and Forko, guards:
Tsoutsouvas, center; Hoos, quarter;
Coffis and Williams, halves; and
either Calvelli or Brigham, full.
Orchesis announces the initiation
of Sylvia Duncan.
Houdini had a lot to learn. A
tropical hurricane is a zephyr. And
the Bay Bridge isn't a dazzling spec
tacle.
At least, those are some of the im
pressions being given these days by
Tiny Thornhill's stampeding Stan
fordites. The festivities on the prac
tice turf this week might be feebly
described as befuddling, dazzling,
razzle-dazzle, and radical. In short,
the Indians are winding up final
preparations for Saturday's Magni
tudinous Melee at Berkeley.
Offense Sky High
Sky-high — that's where Tiny has
blown the Cardinal offense, and
there it bids fair to stay. The stand
ard equipment usually seen on a
Wamcr-designcd gridiron machine
has been replaced by some varied
things that are, indeed, strange and
wonderful to behold.
Every day this week, the coaching
staff has added a few more new an
tics to the Redshirt attack, and
what's more, the innovations have
seemed to click right off the bat.
The result of all this is the fact
that nothing but the first-string
line-up remains of the old order, and
even that is subject to change.
Tiny Optimistic
And docs Tiny expected his radical
Rcdshrits to come through and rout
the Golden Bears? "Sure thing," is
the way he puts it. Betting odds are
now quoted at 10-8 for California,
but Thornhill will tell you the only
way this affects the situation is that
it will give the Farm warriors the
underdog's psychological advantage.
To many outfits, the advantage, such
as it is, might mean but little.
Experience, however, has prompt
ed Tiny to declare that his squad has
I already shown no little come
through ability this season in climb
ing to its present ranking. And his
faith in the boys has never waned.
In past years, Stanford has tri
umphed repeatedly when Cal was
more highly touted than now. This
year's aggregation can turn the trick,
too, Tiny opines in effect.
Stub Optimistic, Too
Last night in Berkeley, Stub Alli
son was apparently surer than ever
that his boys are going to give the
most inspired and brilliant per
formance Saturday of their some
what checkered career. And he
clings 4o this belief, despite that Ken
Cotton, Dave De Varona, and Milt
Pollack seem destined to remain on
the sick list and off the field this
week-end. There is a slight possi
bility that Tackles Dc Varona and
Pollack might get into shape for the
fracas ,but even Allison himself woe
fully admits that such is not the case
with Cotton, ace fullback.
Dave Anderson will probably be
billed to start in Cotton's spot. And
while Anderson may lack the expe
rience and defensive potency of the
injured one, he still is quite some
shucks in these parts. Allison has not
been scrimmaging his charges this
week. Instead he has turned to in
tensive pass defense and offense
drills.
Both he and Thornhill will ease up
somewhat on their respective crews
this afternoon and tomorrow. Here
on the Farm, the only injury that
may prove a handicap is that of
Fullback Glenn Hamilton. Hamilton
seems to be having more than a little

clings 4o this belief, despite that Ken
Cotton, Dave De Varona, and Milt
Pollack seem destined to remain on
the sick list and off the field this
week-end. There is a slight possi
bility that Tackles Dc Varona and
Pollack might get into shape for the
fracas ,but even Allison himself woe
fully admits that such is not the case
with Cotton, ace fullback.
Dave Anderson will probably be
billed to start in Cotton's spot. And
while Anderson may lack the expe
rience and defensive potency of the
injured one, he still is quite some
shucks in these parts. Allison has not
been scrimmaging his charges this
week. Instead he has turned to in
tensive pass defense and offense
drills.
Both he and Thornhill will ease up
somewhat on their respective crews
this afternoon and tomorrow. Here
on the Farm, the only injury that
may prove a handicap is that of
Fullback Glenn Hamilton. Hamilton
seems to be having more than a little
trouble with his weak leg, and Tiny
has announced that either Tony Cal
velli or Jake Brigham will start at
full. Hamilton, it seems, may be
used for a few minutes if he's feMing
fit.
The very tentative Cal line-up
reads something like this: Sparks and
Schwartz, ends; Nordstrom and Mc-
Ateer, tackles; Hanford or Evans,
and Stockton, guards; Herwig, cen
ter; Meek, quarter; Archer and
Chapman, halves; and Anderson, full.
The Indians' side of the Big Game
program will include: Stone and
Clark, ends; Callaway and Zagar.
tackles: Matthews and Forko, guards:
Tsoutsouvas, center; Hoos, quarter;
Coffis and Williams, halves; and
either Calvelli or Brigham, full.
Orchesis announces the initiation
of Sylvia Duncan.
