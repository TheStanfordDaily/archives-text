# Pyre Blazes Tonight As Spirit Hits Peak
## Frosh Asked To Work On Structure Today 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
The biggest Big Game Bonfire in
history will go up in smoke tonight
when Card students shout their final
defiance of the Golden Bear. Farm
denizens, led by torchlight bearers,
will parade from Encina Gym after
the rally to Lagunita lake bed where
the blaze will be started after a flare
of rockets has been shot into the air.
Card irosh arc expected to heed
the call for workers on the pyre
when construction begins at 9 o'clock
this morning.
Jeeb Halaby, chairman of the bon
fire committee, will direct the work
with the assistance of 25 team cap
tains who have organized the frosh
into workable units.
Phone Poles Laid
Nine telegraph poles were laid as

a foundation for the fire by the
P. G. and E. at the beginning of the
week, and the rest of the super
structure was completed yesterday
by a crew of Enema men. Today the
remaining combustibles will be add
ed by all freshmen who do not have
to attend classes between 9 and 12,
and every first year man is expected
to work on the bonfire this after
noon.
Anyone who cats lunch at Encina
will be considered a slacker, as
lunch is being served for the workers
in the Lagunita lake bed by the
Roble women. They will also con
tribute to the cause by chauffcuring
the women from Encina to the site
of the fire between 9 and 5 o'clock.
Trucks Supplied
Trucks have been supplied by
Paly merchants to bring the material
to be burned to Lagunita, and their
unloading will be under the direc
tion of Carl Naqel and Harm How
ard. Dun Dewar will be in charge
of the tools, and Brown Cannon and
George Ditz will assist Halaby in
directing the actual construction.
When the bonfire is completed it
will be topped off with some rockets
and 400 gallons of oil.
Fifty freshman volunteers are re
quested by committee chairman Jecb
Halaby to guard the lire from Cal
men between 6 o'clock when the fire
is completed until 8 o'clock when it
is lit. A system of guards has been
in for the last few nights, and
if the blaze is actually lit the fire
house will ring an alarm of thrco
blasts.
Team captains must be at Lagunita
at 9 this morning, and all freshmen
who can possibly get out of classes
are requested to be there. At noon
Encina must be empty. Sophomore,
junior, and senior men who can work
on the construction of the fire will
be welcome, but the bulk of the
I responsibility rests on the frosh.
