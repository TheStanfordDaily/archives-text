STANFORD IN THE NEWS
Out of the welter of blah that the |
San Francisco newspapers have
printed concerning the gigantic Cali
fornia raid on the Stanford bonfire, j
the only reasonably accurate account j
appears to be that of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Said the Chronicle: "Accounts of
the reported attempt at reprisal (in
return for Stanford's painting of the
Big "C") differed strangely. Berke
ley students said a plan to set off the
Stanford bonfire failed because a
stool-pigeon tapped a telephone
wire. The Stanford boys got a big
chuckle out of this, because the bon
fire has not yet been built."
♦ * ♦
Come to think of it, no account of
the raid was really sensational,
lerely a little inflated, although I
l.ave not yet seen what the San
J rancisco Call-Bulletin has concoct
( 1 on the subject. The worst may be
c cpected, for in 1931 when California
i. ided the bonfire and a minor skir
mish resulted, the Call-Bulletin re
p <rted the affair as nothing less than
n Battle of Bull Run.
Said that paper: "The battle, in
v.iich gasoline bombs were hurled
ni«d improvised clubs used on both
si es, may cause a severance of ath
1< ic relations between the two uni
v< si ties. Several co-eds, who had
In n furnishing the guards with cof-
IV. and doughnuts, fled screaming.
A lused by the siren, the police
sq :ad reached the spot and broke up
the battle." The facts were just
sir htly exaggerated, you under
st; id.
he Call-Bulletin evidently struck
pa. dirt in writing such stuff, for not
lon •; afterwards they startled the
Wf; Id with a 108-point Gothic two
lin head that screamed: "COEDS
Vlf IT TO STANFORD DORM
STARTS RIOT." The story, in col
uit i one, told of two co-eds, said to
)j«• Stanford women, who violated all
i\t':s by visiting Toyon hall.
\ 'hat really happened was that
n't r a basketball game three stu
<i(: ts, accompanied by three women,
n't Stanford co-eds, entered a Toyon
ro( n and left after 15 minutes, but
no before a mob of astonished in
rnu es had gathered at the door to
givj the sixsome a healthy razzing.
What the Call-Bulletin picked up for
reprint were paragraphs from a
Ca npus Opinion letter commenting
on dormitory rules in general.
* * *
But the classic example of all
monumental hoaxes perpetrated by
the San Francisco pink sheet was the
ahrost world famous story about the
v.o.nen splashing about at night in
the Encina pools. According to the
C'tJi 1 -Bulletin, physical educatijn di
rectors for Stanford women com
pl; :ned that Stanford women didn't
lai 1 to swimming like they used to.
. ,nd the Call-Bulletin found out
wl y. You know what? It was be
cause they were getting their swim
mi lg practice at night. The women
w< it down to the Roble basement,
tr. wled into the four-foot steam
pi e, and traveled three-quarters of
a nile underground to the Encina
pt A. Because the pipes were warm,
the y reduced their clothing to "sim
pl. garb," and in this birthday state
the y dipped in the light of the full
m >on.
"hat the Call-Bulletin really be-
I ved in the ultimate morality of
Stanford students is shown by their
c planation that men did not join the
: Is swimming in the Encina pool,
:t crawled likewise through the
>am pipes to the Roble pool before
I I (fling their clothes for a nocturnal
1 mnge.
There were pictures and every
-1 ting, showing near-beauties round
c d up for the occasion—no doubt by
: ne lynx-eyed campus correspondent
or the Call-Bulletin, who later left
he University by request as a re
ult of the job—who were clad in
ingerie and less, slinking through
;he pipes. There was even a map
.howing the path sin took as it tun
leled beneath the slumbering cam
pus. The Miami, Florida, News and
the New York Journal reprinted the
fraud.

So ihcn, if the Call-Bulletin has
already come out with an ordinary
account of Tuesday night's tremen
dous false alarm, then the millenium
is really upon us. If it comes out
with the usual line of inflated bunk,
then times have not changed a bit.
The world still has notions of col
leges being places where sin, riot,
and mayhem run rampant, and far
l>o it from the Call-Bulletin ever to
disillusion the world on this matter.
