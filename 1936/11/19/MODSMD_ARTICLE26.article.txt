# Bay Cities Will Distribute Milk In Emergency
## Councils Set Up Funds To Take Charge Of Dairy Administration 
### 
OAKLAND. Nov. 17 (UP). â€”The
cities of Oakland and Berkeley, pop
ulous communities of the San Fran
cisco East Bay area, tonight decided
to go into the milk business in order
to restore normal distribution in time
for tomorrow morning's coffee and
nursing bottles.
As the first step toward taking
over the milk distribution system of
the cities, each council declared a
state of emergency existed because
of a strike deadlock between distrib
utors and the Milk Wagon Drivers
Union.
Deliver Ultimatum
The councils then informed the
disputants that if the strike were not
settled by midnight tonight, the cities
would assume charge of the dairies,
distributing plants, and wagon routes
| and see that every householder had
his milk and cream delivered di
rectly to his home.
Sets Up Fund
The Berkeley Council set up a $500
fund to launch itself in the business;
Oakland set aside $25,000 of its spe
cial emergency funds to finance the
start of the new enterprise.
Explaining the differential in the
original investment, Berkeley sourc
es said they expect to operate on a
30-day statement basis, and expect
income from sale of milk, through its
rapid turnover, to provide .sufficient
funds at the end of each 30-day pe
riod to meet the bills.
