# Farm Leaders Comment On Freshman Raid
## 
### 
Stanford's two presidents,
Ray Lyman Wilbur and Jim
Reynolds, yesterday reacted to
Encinamen's accomplishments
in Berkeley with the following
statements:
"A lot of people ought to have
the Stanford Axe applied to
them in the spot you hear
about," said President Wilbur.
"If the Californians make a raid
on Stanford, it will be Stanford
students' own fault.' '
In a telegram to the editor of
The Daily Californian, Jim
Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president,
sent the following message:
"On behalf of the students of
Stanford, may I express our
sincere regrets for the unfor
tunate occurrences that took
place last Monday evening. We
hope that such unauthorized
action will be prevented in the
future and that the traditional
sportsmanship of our two
schools will prevail."
