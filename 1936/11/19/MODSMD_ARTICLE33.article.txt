SOMEONE IS
KIDDING HIMSELF
In all the whoop and holler pre
dicting the Big Game this week, the
majority of the fellows who get their
say before the public seem to go for
California.
Such people as Jimmy Phelan,
Howard Jones, Bill Spaulding and
the money pickers on Spring street
and Leavenworth street seem con
vinced California will win this one,
and the odds hover around 5-4 on
Cal. These of course will hit even
money by 2 o'clock Saturday after
noon.
There are a lot of comparative
scores this year, with the new round
robin skeds of the P.C.C., and from
the six of them we find Cal ahead
using Oregon U.S.C. and Oregon
State and Stanford up if Washington
and U.C.L.A. are used for compari
son. California will win by (5 points
il you add them up while Stanford
will win 18-14 if you use score per
game averages.
But nobody uses comparative
scores anyway so forget it. What else
do they see? With Cal in the loss
column four times and Stanford
there three maybe they give extra
weight to the U. of C. tough compe
tition.
And Coach Leonard B. '"Stub"
Allison has a good list of injuries
(always deduct 50 per cent from
pre-Big Game week reports) in Milt
Pollack, George Cornell, Dave de-
Varona and Ken Cotton that will
simply paralyze his power Saturday
if they are as bad as reported
Leonard B. "Stub" tolc} us Tues
day that his men were inferior to
Stanford everywhere except at the
guards and center, grant that Her
wig is an all-American now. Evi
dently nobody saw Matthews and
Chooch and Ferko in action last
week. Leonard B. "Stub" is as close
to the situation as anyone and he
isn't nearly so sure California will
win—he won't pick either.
Still the boys in the know are
picking California. Why?
I dunno. I am at a loss to figure it
out.
ANY NEW NAMES
IN THERE?
How do these squads stack up with
Ihe ones that were starting games
last September?
California in those days was
Sparks and Schwartz. Nordstrom and
McAteer, Stockton and Gilbert, Her
wig, Meek, Archer and Chapman,
Howard.
Sparks is now back in there, after
a month of injuries, McAteer went
out with a bum knee at the very
first, and was replaced by Dave de- j
Varona. a fighting 190-pounder. Too <
small to be a good tackle, deVarona's
attitude will get him an opening
berth Saturday.
Bob Gilbert, a tough guard all last
season, was beaten out by Ray Han- I
ford, who they say is even tougher, j
Jack Howard, fullback, has been
superseded by Ken Cotton, who was
the best fullback over there at the
first of the year, but was moved up
to the line to bolster the tackle fod
der.
The rest of the Cal team is still in
tact.
For Stanford, Clark, Zagar, Ferko,
Tsoutsouvas, Matthews, Callaway,
CofTis Hoos, and Vigna were in there
at the start of the year. Joe is now
alternating with Fred Williams at
right half, and Grant Stone has come
up out of the crowd to grab the wide
open job at right end, these being the
only changes outside of fullback.
The fullbacks are history—Paul
man, Hamilton, Brigham, Calvelli, in
that order. Ham's trick knee ruined
his season, and Tony and Jake stand

SOMEONE IS
KIDDING HIMSELF
In all the whoop and holler pre
dicting the Big Game this week, the
majority of the fellows who get their
say before the public seem to go for
California.
Such people as Jimmy Phelan,
Howard Jones, Bill Spaulding and
the money pickers on Spring street
and Leavenworth street seem con
vinced California will win this one,
and the odds hover around 5-4 on
Cal. These of course will hit even
money by 2 o'clock Saturday after
noon.
There are a lot of comparative
scores this year, with the new round
robin skeds of the P.C.C., and from
the six of them we find Cal ahead
using Oregon U.S.C. and Oregon
State and Stanford up if Washington
and U.C.L.A. are used for compari
son. California will win by (5 points
il you add them up while Stanford
will win 18-14 if you use score per
game averages.
But nobody uses comparative
scores anyway so forget it. What else
do they see? With Cal in the loss
column four times and Stanford
there three maybe they give extra
weight to the U. of C. tough compe
tition.
And Coach Leonard B. '"Stub"
Allison has a good list of injuries
(always deduct 50 per cent from
pre-Big Game week reports) in Milt
Pollack, George Cornell, Dave de-
Varona and Ken Cotton that will
simply paralyze his power Saturday
if they are as bad as reported
Leonard B. "Stub" tolc} us Tues
day that his men were inferior to
Stanford everywhere except at the
guards and center, grant that Her
wig is an all-American now. Evi
dently nobody saw Matthews and
Chooch and Ferko in action last
week. Leonard B. "Stub" is as close
to the situation as anyone and he
isn't nearly so sure California will
win—he won't pick either.
Still the boys in the know are
picking California. Why?
I dunno. I am at a loss to figure it
out.
ANY NEW NAMES
IN THERE?
How do these squads stack up with

last September?
California in those days was
Sparks and Schwartz. Nordstrom and
McAteer, Stockton and Gilbert, Her
