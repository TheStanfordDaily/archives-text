# Cross Country Team Meets Cal Today
## Hilly Farm Course May Prove Tough Grind For 18 Bear Runners 
### 
This afternoon at 3:30 o'clock the
Bears wll invade the Stanford cam
pusâ€”when they meet the Card cross
country team on the golf course.
California took all but two of the
first 10 places in their encounter with
U.C.L.A. last week and they are rat
ed among the strongest teams the
Bears have ever put on the field.
Stanford took San Mateo J.C. last
week and holds high hopes in view of
the fact that Cal usually folds up
when they hit our hilly course.
The Bear will also have an advan
tage when the gun goes off tomorrow
in having 18 men on the field while
the Cards will only have eight. Bob
Alexander is about the foremost
Card threat with Bert McCurdy,
Jack Beeman, and John Dern run
ning him a close second. U.C. will
bring such distance stars as Baker,
Hall, and Mehlert, who placed in that
order in the U.C.L.A. meet, as well as
Voorhees and Lions, also strong
threats.
The run will start at the first fair
way promptly at 3:30 and will be
about three and a half miles long,
the full length of the golf course.
