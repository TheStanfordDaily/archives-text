# Honorable Intentions

When the freshmen started out on their jaunt
to paint the Big "C" red, it probably seemed like
a very clever idea. It was a kid stunt rather
typical of freshmen, who naturally assume that
their supreme duty to their country is to make
fools of themselves. However, they had in
mind only the painting of the Big "C," and this
single act may be explained on the grounds that
freshmen go to too many movies and read too
much light fiction. However, the serious out
come of what was supposedly rather innocent
intercollegiate horseplay shows that intent does
not always govern actions or results.
The freshmen when they went over did not
intend to hurt the Cal sophomore guard, but
they apparently did. They did not intend to
cause repercussions which make intercollegiate
rivalry on a sportsmanlike plane very difficult.
They did not intend to threaten the existence of
this year's Big Game. But they did.
And now, I find that although The Daily did
not intend to do it, it seems that it is somewhat
to blame. Playing down the Mudfight appar
ently did not give the freshmen a sufficient
chance to give vent to their exhibitionistic desire
to make asses of themselves. The Daily's stand
that the Paly police were responsible for the
sad events around the Pajamarino, apparently
impressed the frosh that Stanford somehow
condoned making an ass of oneself. While the
fact that one of The Daily's wide-awake fresh
man reporters had been sufficiently impressed
about coverage in Tuesday afternoon's usual
staff meetings in the usual place to phone in
the story of Monday night's raiding expedition
soemed to give the impression that there'was an
official party departing, and that The Daily was
somehow in on it. The Daily did not intend to
mess things like this, but it apparently did.
At the time of writing it is too early to tell
what will happen before morning comes. But
even if the heavy artillery does not move down
from Cal, there has been a series of unfortunate
circumstances, none of them governed by dia
bolical intent, but all of which cast a bad reflec
tion on Stanford, and will needlessly embitter
cur relations with California.

this year's Big Game. But they did.
And now, I find that although The Daily did
not intend to do it, it seems that it is somewhat
to blame. Playing down the Mudfight appar
ently did not give the freshmen a sufficient
chance to give vent to their exhibitionistic desire
to make asses of themselves. The Daily's stand
that the Paly police were responsible for the
sad events around the Pajamarino, apparently
impressed the frosh that Stanford somehow
condoned making an ass of oneself. While the
fact that one of The Daily's wide-awake fresh
man reporters had been sufficiently impressed
about coverage in Tuesday afternoon's usual
staff meetings in the usual place to phone in
the story of Monday night's raiding expedition
soemed to give the impression that there'was an
official party departing, and that The Daily was
somehow in on it. The Daily did not intend to
mess things like this, but it apparently did.
At the time of writing it is too early to tell
what will happen before morning comes. But
even if the heavy artillery does not move down
from Cal, there has been a series of unfortunate
circumstances, none of them governed by dia
bolical intent, but all of which cast a bad reflec
tion on Stanford, and will needlessly embitter
cur relations with California.
