# Rushing in the Spring, Tra-la-la-la
## 
### 
The Daily is printing a series of fraternity
sketches and pictures, trying to inform the frosh
a little more on fraternities, realizing full well
that it is mostly a noble gesture. The necessary
impartiality prevents any particular character
ization of the houses other than the cold, mute
facts. Besides, the best way to become ac
quainted with the fraternities still seems to be
to go up and beard the lions in their dens.
The new rushing system, according to the
boys, seems to work fairly well for the purpose,
though there seems to be some sentiment ex
tant for following Dr. Wilbur's original sugges
tion of last year and holding rushing in the
spring.
The advantages of this plan are that it gives
the freshmen a longer time to get the low-down
on the houses, and vice-versa.
Disadvantages seem to be that during that
longer time, there would be more opportunity
for illegal rushing, because the houses would
have their usual internecine warfare at lining
up a class.
The football houses, particularly, want the
rushing maintained in the fall, when thnu Lroth

ers are in a better condition to impress, while
the non-football houses have a similar vested
interest in rushing with their spring and winter
sports powers.
Just exactly what the cold light of objective
truth could reveal on the various merits and
demerits of the plan is not known, seeing that
everybody's been looking for this cold light
for a long time.
