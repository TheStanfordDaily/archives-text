A sudden apprehension over the growth of
student political activity is gripping the world.
And no matter what the motivation for the awak
ening, the cure applied follows a stereotyped
plan.
Dr. Butler, and a thousand and one other col
lege administrators from coast to coast have
echoed the same plea—peace, quiet, manners,
gentlemanlinness and quite often an added
threat of expulsion for the student who dares
go beyound the bounds. But who sets the limits
doesn't seem to matter.
Yesterday a Columbia professor hailed the
new Nazi dictum. He lauded Bernhard Rust,
Nazi educational chief, for his ruling.
"It is disheartening for students to partake
in political activity when we are in our present
crisis, uncertain of our promised land of social
humanity and justice," said Professor David S.
Muzzey in chapel.
He deplored, in effect, the growing student
awareness that youth has a stake in the world.
He labeled "disgraceful" those demonstrations
which attempt to bring injustices to the front.
Why "disheartening," Dr. Muzzey? Is it be
cause it isn't nice, it isn't courteous, it isn't
proper? Or is it because students have begun
to think for themselves, to strike out for them
selves, to make themselves heard before it is
too late?
