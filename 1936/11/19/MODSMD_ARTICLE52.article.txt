MORE DEMOCRACY!—YOU'RE EATING ME
Dear Bobs:
Yesterday the University sent me a letter about
expenses. At least it was signed by the University, but
it sounds as if you wrote it.
To clarify things once and for all, I am not the U.S.
mint. Furthermore, I don't see how you spend the
money I send you, much less ask for more.
This Democracy business, mentioned in the letter,
confuses me, and until such confusion is straightened
out, I will hold my check book in abeyance. The only
Democracy I ever heard of that was expensive is
Rooseveltian Democracy. The fact that Stanford Dem
ocracy is expensive is the last straw, besides making
me doubt the wisdom of my Republican vote.
Here are some specific puzzlers: Why is it that, stu
dents are asked to buy tickets to the Big Game. I
understand you pay a $15 per quarter student body fee
that admits you to many games, why not the Big
Game? Huh? After all, when you entered Stanford I
had every assurance the University was operated for
the benefit of the students. And certainly a fine day in
the open air in the U.C. Stadium, watching the game, is
a student benefit.
I'm confident the whole thing is an oversight, not a
mistake, as you intimate. I'm sure that the fact that
Big Game tickets can be sold for exorbitant amounts to
outsiders has nothing to do with the student ticket
charge. Any more than the fact that because earlier
games didn't have such a public demand, you were ad
mitted free, if you got up in time.
As to the rest of the expenses mentioned—including
the Gaieties, which sounds like a turkey to me, and the
New Theater—l herewith favor snobbish aristocracy,
even if you have to sit home with "Gone with the
Wind."
I say this particularly bccause your son will also
have to pay for the New Theater, so some day you'll
know how I feel. I am through with the hot winds
of freedom.
Love always,
Mother

Love always,
Mother
