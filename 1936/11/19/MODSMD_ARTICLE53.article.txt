# OUR HASHER

As the campus jittered at its hinges last night over
the impending horde of onrushing tanks, airplanes, and
submarines from California, the Cardinal activity group
decided that it would be a good idea to take the axe
out of the jewel box in the Union Cellar. Accordingly,
they called up Stevie, A.S.S.U. custodian of the A.S.S.U.
window, the authorizations to charge, Chuck Fontius
and Jim Reynolds, who came over to the office last
night, took the key from under the doormat, and un
locked the Axe from its last resting place.
Cardinal Chairman Franich then took the Axe out
of its showcase, put it gingerly into the back of his
new car, inserted his key, turned the lock. Then he
had to go back up to the A.S.S.U. office and sign a
payment order giving the Axe a 2:30 lock-out. He
went back to his car, tried the handle, was surprised
to find it unlocked. Shocked, he looked inside, and
there was the Axe resting nicely. Shucks.
Last year a Phi Psi was arrested for exceeding the
speed limit while pedalling his bicycle down Palm
Drive. He was released, however, when the defendant
explained that he ate Wheaties for breakfast.
This did not work the other day for another Phi Psi,
however; he was arrested for speeding in his car at the
rate of 75 in a 20-mile zone. He was released on the
ground that he did not eat any breakfast at all. The
next day, however, he was arrested for speeding at the
rate of 80 in a 15-mile zone. The judge this time
charged him $250 for the privilege.
Nothing daunted, the Phi Psi took his car, dismem
bered it of its fenders, poured a little Nodoz in the
gasoline tank, and set out for the Oakland speedway.
At this quiet little spot on a cold, autumn afternoon,
the Phi Psi entered the races, won his event, cleaned
up $250, came back and handed the $250 to the judge,
rode quietly home at 120 m.p.h. (in a 5-mile zone).
The little lady identified by the Phi Sigs as Dixie
Dunbar after repeated perusal of Film Fun and Screen
Classic, and who is reputed to have tried to pledge the
local Phi Sig chapter on the week-end of the U.S.C.
game, has apparently followed the fortunes of the S.C.
football team, sending cards to the local chapter upon
the standing of the various chapters up and down the
Coast. She reports the U.C.L.A. standard on a par with
the local, but the Washington one is far and away ahead.
She pledged the Washington chapter. The Phi Sigs
think this is awfully funny.
