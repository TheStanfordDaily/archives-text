SAN FRANCISCO OPERA IV
For regular opera goers, the four
teenth annual season ends with to
morrow night's performance of
Othello, Martinelli, Rethberg, Tib
bett starred. Big Game Gaieties,
though, will probably minimize
Stanford attendance. This is said to
be the most "Wagnerian" of the
Verdi operas. Others given this year
were La For/a Del Destino, not as
familiar, but containing some beau
tiful arias, well-constructed music
ally, and the familiar Kigoletto and
II Trovatorc.
Saturday evening, better known as
Big Game night, which will certainly
not find Stanford students in the San
Francisco opera house. Das Rhein
gold, first, shortest, weakest of Wag
ner's Ring, is being sung. After
Sunday afternoon's repeat perform
ance of Die Walkure with its same
splendid caste, musicians, singers,
and directors will pack up their in
strument cases, their trunks, and de
part. Opera will be over.
A fine balance was maintained in
the repertoire this season between
German and Italian opera; Wagner's
rather declamatory massiveness was
a good complement to the frothiness
of Rossini, Puccini, Leoncavallo.
The Marriage of Figaro, a charming
opera, failed to fall into either classi
fication. Mozart's music is too deli
cate, not somber enough, to resemble
the German, but neither has it the
showy, tempestuous quality of the
Italian operas, in which aria is the
most important consideration.
Another season it would be inter
esting to hear an opera by one of
the Russian composers—Boris Godo
nov, perhaps. Debussey's Pelleas et
Mclisande, Strauss's Salome, or a
modern, unproduced work might be
staged. The performance of Gianni
Schicchi this year in English added
much to the general enjoyment of
the hilarious one-act opera.
