THE TERRIFIC JIMMY DORSEY,
whose orchestra wowed 'em at the
Junior Prom here last year, plays the
Big Game Dance at Cal's Edwards
Gym Saturday night. Dorsey prom
ises to repeat his colossal arrange
ment of "Come Join the Band,"
which called forth three encores at
the Prom. Soloists will be Martha
Tilton and Bob Eberle, Cal regula
tions not barring femme warblers.
STUFF: Music isn't the only thing
Bob Burns' bazooka is good for. He
used the mouthpiece as a jimmy to
pry open the locked door of his car
t'other day . . . Bing Crosby is in
San Francisco for a few days to
watch the ponies run, a few of his
own among 'em . . . Don Wilson is
a sucker for any kid selling papers,
all because he earned his first dollar
thataway.
WARREN WILLIAM, the movie
star, has a sun dial that strikes the
hour of the day like a clock. When
the shadow crosses the hour mark, a
photoelectric cell sets off the proper
number of "bongs." Warren says the
great advantage is that it doesn't
wake you up by striking at night.
SALT LAKE CITY must be quite
a place! A whole gang of people last
Saturday night requested KDYL to
play "Was I Drunk. Was He Hand
some, and Did My Ma Gimme Hell?"
one of those off-color records that
phonograph companies issue and
then pretend they never heard of.
And the station played it, too! Now
if they really want to go in for stuff
like that, we recommend Libby Hol
man's recording of "Love for Sale."
Oil YOU KID! Says Sally Rand:
"It pays to advertise. I attribute my
own success to the judicious use of
white space."

For the last few years the Farm
Field Artillery Unit was pronounced
as excellent by inspecting officers of
the Ninth Corps Area.
