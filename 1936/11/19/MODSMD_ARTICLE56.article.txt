## DIGEST POLL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Well, we are back just where we
started as far as a Nitery is con
cerned, aren't we? The gang with
the cars still has a place to date and
those without cars still don't.
That vote which was taken at the
clubhouse was like taking a straw
vote at a political meeting. If I had a
car I would have been there and I
would have voted: "Yes, this is a
very nhee place indeed." But I have
no car, and I didn't go, and I didn't
vote, and the 102 students who rode
out will probably do so again next
week, and I hope they have a good
time for I won't.
