# NEW CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If The Daily is looking for a use
ful campus campaign, let me sug
gest that it argue for circulation of
books from the Felton Library, at
present the world's most useless col
lection of good books. Under pres
ent arrangements, students are able
to read books kept in the Felton
Room for the magnificent total of 15
hours a week (from 2-5 Mondays
through Fridays by climbing to the
third floor and reading the book on
the spot in one of the four or so
chairs.) In other words, Felton fiction
books are practically useless as one
does not like to read a novel at speci
fied hours in a specified place. The
enjoyment of fiction is best gained by

reading at leisare hoursâ€”usually in
the evening stretched out comfort
ably at home.
The writer sees no good reason
why these books should not circulate.
It may be argued that they are too
fine (although I doubt this) but it is
immaterial how fine they are if no
one ever reads them. If they are be
ing saved for posterity they might as
well be kept in a case. At any rate,
the books loaked in the Felton Room
are worthless to Stanford students
who can never take them home nor
read them in the evening or over the
week ends, the two most enjoyable
times for reading the fiction kept in
Felton.
