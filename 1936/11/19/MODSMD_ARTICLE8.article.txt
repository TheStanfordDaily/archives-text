# Game Chappie Expects Sell-out On Quad Today
## 
### 
As the seven-color Biblical inter
pretation cover of the Big Game
Chaparral streams over the Engi
neers' corner counter today, old
timers aver that the tradition of the
November humor mag has reached
a new high not only for humor but
color and make-up. Sell-out is ex
pected.
Besides "Cutlass Cut Men" by
newcomer Tom Fleming, and Alan
Dueommun's "It Never Brains But
It Bores," Bob Hartmann comes
through with "Ode to a Cinch No -
tice" which clears up all miscellany
on this interesting feature of Stan
ford education.
"The Brain in Action" comes from
the casebook of Dr. Robert Prcsncll,
while reminiscence provides mate
rial for Winstead Weaver's "Forty
Years of Eligibility" in which Doo
dles exposes himself as the origina
tor of all of Stanford's traditions.
Harrison Stephens sums up "Mod
ern Trends in Advertising" while
Dave Leff compiles "Notes from the
Colleges" which tell.s the Farm what
other institutions are doing.
