Full house acclaim of the Gaieties
was assured last night with every
| scat in the Assembly Hall sold out,
according to Dramatics Manager
j Dick Daughcrty. No more tickets
I are available unless some are turned
; in this afternoon at the A.S.S.U. of
! fices.
Directors announce this year's
show has the best music of any
Gaieties production. The orches
tration has been arranged by Gordy
Heche and Ernie Hcckscher, and
they have combined their orchestras
to play in the pit.
The prevailing note of the show Ls
not stark comedy, but a well-bal
anced mixture of the serious and
farce. It is an attempt at artistry.
It has a continuity woven around the
; idea that it is the last Gaieties to be
presented in the old Assembly Hall.
Throughout the performance, sym
bols of this will appear.
A negro spiritual number has been
j written by Adolf Hansen, which the
S musical directors describe as re
j markable. Other contributors to the
, show are: Jack Bcatty, Amelia
: Baincs, Jim Corner, Ruth Goodan.
i Bob Presncll, assistant director
| Johnson Hill, and Hal Kahn. Some
j ideas used were contributed by
; Frank O'Neill before he left the
j campus for Hollywood.
