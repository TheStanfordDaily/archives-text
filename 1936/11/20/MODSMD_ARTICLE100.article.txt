# Big Game Files Predict Win For Card Gridders; Indians Amass 448 Points, Bears 426
## 
### 
"The Cards are going to win the
Big Game!" So says that crystal ball
—the Daily files. Statistical reasons
are twofold: first, Stanford has never
lost a Cal Game in a year ending in
(5, and second, the Cards tied Cal in
1932 (score 0-0) and the Indians
have won 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, and 3 vic
tories, respectively, following ties,
never suffering a defeat after a
deadlock.
In the traditional super football
encounters, Stanford has amassed
•448 points to show a close lead over
the Bear's 426 since they started to
play in 1892. The games were first
held in San Francisco, where 13
gomes were played on five different
fields. Of these games the Indians
won 5, tied 4, and lost 4. At Ber
keley 14 games have been played off
and the Cards have won seven, tied
4, and lost 3. Thirteen games have
been played on the Farm and seven
times the Indians were victorious,
never tied, and six times on the bot
tom of the pile.
Of our, we hope, famous year end
ing in 6 games v/e have played but
two games. Winning in 1906 by a
score of 6-3, and in 1926 by 41 to 6,
there was no game in 1916 because of
the war. The record Big Game score
was in 1930 when the Indians took
the Bears to the tune of 40-0.
The first game in the streak which
has kept the Axe in our possession
since the last tie v/as in 1933. Tho.-ie
who can recall it will remember it
as the thriller that wasn't won un
til the final quarter when Alustiza
completed a pass to Norgard that
was good for 70 yards for the only
1 touchdown. The final score was 7-3.
The following year's game was
uncertain up until the end of the
third period when Bones Hamilton
; marched down the field behind per-
I feet interference for "an only touch
-1 down. Soon after that Schott place
kicked a field goal. The Bears rallied
; in the final minutes keeping the In-
I dians on the defense and causing no
J little worry, but the final score read
I Stanford 9, California 7.
Last year the Red Machine stopped
i the Boars cold by their superior line
play to skin them 13-0. Grayson made
the first touchdown in a 79-yard
drive on a series of well-mixed
plays. Moscrip soon followed this
score with a beautiful field goal and
I then Wes Muller recovered a Bear
j fumble which resulted in Cofiis go-
I ing over for the final score after a
j 70-yard drive.

times the Indians were victorious,
never tied, and six times on the bot
tom of the pile.
Of our, we hope, famous year end
ing in 6 games v/e have played but
two games. Winning in 1906 by a
score of 6-3, and in 1926 by 41 to 6,
there was no game in 1916 because of
the war. The record Big Game score
was in 1930 when the Indians took
the Bears to the tune of 40-0.
The first game in the streak which
has kept the Axe in our possession
since the last tie v/as in 1933. Tho.-ie
who can recall it will remember it
as the thriller that wasn't won un
til the final quarter when Alustiza
completed a pass to Norgard that
was good for 70 yards for the only
1 touchdown. The final score was 7-3.
The following year's game was
uncertain up until the end of the
third period when Bones Hamilton
; marched down the field behind per-
I feet interference for "an only touch
-1 down. Soon after that Schott place
kicked a field goal. The Bears rallied
; in the final minutes keeping the In-
I dians on the defense and causing no
J little worry, but the final score read
I Stanford 9, California 7.
Last year the Red Machine stopped
i the Boars cold by their superior line
play to skin them 13-0. Grayson made
the first touchdown in a 79-yard
drive on a series of well-mixed
plays. Moscrip soon followed this
score with a beautiful field goal and
I then Wes Muller recovered a Bear
j fumble which resulted in Cofiis go-
I ing over for the final score after a
j 70-yard drive.

"The Cards are going to win the
Big Game!" So says that crystal ball
—the Daily files. Statistical reasons
are twofold: first, Stanford has never
lost a Cal Game in a year ending in
(5, and second, the Cards tied Cal in
1932 (score 0-0) and the Indians
have won 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, and 3 vic
tories, respectively, following ties,
never suffering a defeat after a
deadlock.
In the traditional super football
encounters, Stanford has amassed
•448 points to show a close lead over
the Bear's 426 since they started to
play in 1892. The games were first
held in San Francisco, where 13
gomes were played on five different
fields. Of these games the Indians
won 5, tied 4, and lost 4. At Ber
keley 14 games have been played off
and the Cards have won seven, tied

been played on the Farm and seven

never tied, and six times on the bot

; in the final minutes keeping the In-
I dians on the defense and causing no
J little worry, but the final score read
I Stanford 9, California 7.
Last year the Red Machine stopped
i the Boars cold by their superior line
play to skin them 13-0. Grayson made
the first touchdown in a 79-yard
drive on a series of well-mixed
plays. Moscrip soon followed this
score with a beautiful field goal and
I then Wes Muller recovered a Bear

"The Cards are going to win the
Big Game!" So says that crystal ball
—the Daily files. Statistical reasons
are twofold: first, Stanford has never
lost a Cal Game in a year ending in
(5, and second, the Cards tied Cal in
1932 (score 0-0) and the Indians
have won 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, and 3 vic
tories, respectively, following ties,
never suffering a defeat after a
deadlock.
In the traditional super football
encounters, Stanford has amassed
•448 points to show a close lead over
the Bear's 426 since they started to
play in 1892. The games were first
held in San Francisco, where 13
gomes were played on five different
fields. Of these games the Indians
won 5, tied 4, and lost 4. At Ber
keley 14 games have been played off
and the Cards have won seven, tied
4, and lost 3. Thirteen games have
been played on the Farm and seven
times the Indians were victorious,
never tied, and six times on the bot
tom of the pile.
Of our, we hope, famous year end
ing in 6 games v/e have played but
two games. Winning in 1906 by a
score of 6-3, and in 1926 by 41 to 6,
there was no game in 1916 because of
the war. The record Big Game score
was in 1930 when the Indians took
the Bears to the tune of 40-0.
The first game in the streak which
has kept the Axe in our possession
since the last tie v/as in 1933. Tho.-ie
who can recall it will remember it
as the thriller that wasn't won un
til the final quarter when Alustiza
completed a pass to Norgard that
was good for 70 yards for the only
1 touchdown. The final score was 7-3.
The following year's game was
uncertain up until the end of the
third period when Bones Hamilton
; marched down the field behind per-
I feet interference for "an only touch
-1 down. Soon after that Schott place
kicked a field goal. The Bears rallied
; in the final minutes keeping the In-
I dians on the defense and causing no
J little worry, but the final score read
