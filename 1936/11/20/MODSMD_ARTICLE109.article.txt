The production of this four-page picture edition would have been impossible without the
kind co-operation of The San Francisco Chronicle, which granted The Stanford Daily use of the
cuts printed in this issue. Howard Brodie. staff artist of the Chronicle, is creator of the drawings,
while Clem Albers, staff photographer, produced the magic-eye photos.
