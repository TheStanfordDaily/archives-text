# The
						B.A.C. Takes Care, and Cal Should Too

Stanford couldn't take S.C.
but Cal did, 13 -7. At the top
Sam Chapman leaps high to
snare a short pass as Gene
Hibbs of Troy tries to bat the
ball down.
No wonder that the Bear
bench has a plenty happy look
on its pan. Note Stub Allison's
self-control — he's thinking of
Wally Simpson and the King.



In the middle of the page (above) we have a picture ol Cal
velli plunging and Freddie Williams in the foreground sitting
during Saturday's Oregon State game. To the left we have
the Cal Washington State game, Ed Goddard (28) is running
back a punt with Meek (49) and Herwig of the Bears cornering
him. Number 15 is Farman of the Cougars.


Doc D. C. Hines says "open
wide" to Bob Mangan, and
he does, as wide as Cal's line
tomorrow. Right is Roger
Munger getting measured.
Doc Hines, center, listens to
air-conditioning. Lower left,
Nurse Storey takes a blood
oressure.
