# Stanford Axe Hangs Heavy Over Their Heads
## 
### 
The Chronicle cameraman shows the boys what not to do
tomorrow. Waskowitz (45) Washington, below entices the foot
ball in picture (1) of this magic eye series. Waskowitz wanted
to run (2) this ball across the goal. The ball couldn't see the
point (3), however, and wanted to run Waskowitz across the
goal. The result is a compromise (4), with Jack Clark of Stan
ford inhibiting the Waskowitz recovery (5).

Here it is November and
those big two-page spreads ap
pearing in the city papers to
morrow were taken way back
in October at the opening o:
"camera practice." That mar
to the left doesn't know it yet
but he forgot to pull the slide
for the shot of Schott place
kicking while Coffis holds the
apple.
