# Can Williams Do It Again?
## 
### 
Freddie Williams pulls out the choke on a Y-20, with Hoos, Coffis. and Holdridge sort of a
chorus line while he starts his sensational act. On their knees, with their heads in the air, are
Clark and Ferko.
In numbers three, four, five and six, Freddy does the Australian sash weight dive into
the end zone for the first Stanford touchdown, with Fricksen, of Washington, looking on.
