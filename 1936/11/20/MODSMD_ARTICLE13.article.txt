# Tiny's Tradition Faces Test; Rally, Fire Promise Victory
## Bear Funeral Tops Rally, Bonfire 
### BOB EISENBACH 
They buried Cal last, night*
And what h funeral it was! Not
50 but 6000 joyful mourners lined
the rim of the Lagunita lake-bed
while student pall-bearers toted his
coffin into the vast bowl and hoisted
it atop the biggest funeral pyre a
bear ever had.
It was a hail and farewell funeral
that Dore might have painted, with
eerie shadows, breathless distances,
and a light that only 100 tons of
yearning tinder can make.
Beginning and End
It was the beginning of another
Big Game, and the end of an evening
of Stanford spirit that swept down
from the Fiji house in a monster pa
rade, swarmed through the Pavilion,
and then streamed to the mile-long
bowl where the tattered Boar met
his fathers.
At 7 o'clock Webb Jones sounded
the tocsin from'the Pavilion plat
form, synthesizing the rustic and
roar of 5000 roughs.
"The Indians are going to blow Cal
right out of their fingerbowl in
Raspberry Canyon," cried former
yell-leader Paul Speegle.
Tiny Moans—"Defeat"
"Cal is going to play better ball
than it has so far this season to beat
us Saturday," moaned Tiny.
"It might be 12-0, it might be 27-0,
but it will be a Stanford win,"
cheered "Bones" Hamilton.
And the 5000 roughs roared and
stamped as Big Game fever caught
them and swirled their spirit into a
rafter-shaking scries of yells.
Doodles Spews
Entertaining as an end in himself
was Doodles Weaver, who spewed
the contents of a gold-fish bowl,
grimaced, broke the tension. Also
entertaining was the entrance of
Officer Burns, who broke no ten
sion, spoke of breaking Doodles on
account of goldfish-spewing.
Then Webb raised his hands. The
march was on!
And the 5000 roughs oozed like a
thick syrup from the Pavilion, ran
like blots of mercury from the Pa
vilion, past the Quad to the shores
of Lagunita where 2000 Palo Altans,
ancient and modern, were gathered.
Bear Bear's Body
Down they came through the files,
bearing on their shoulders a coffin.
"Poor Cal, Poor Cal," they chanted.
Cameras clicked and the crowd made
way. Boathouse searchlights fingered
through the night and touched the
group faintly as they walked slowly
onto the flat of the bowl, dwarfed by
the 40-foot pyre.
Above was the drone of planes,
perhaps Cal's, perhaps Stanford's
own, that .sent a tide of whisper
through the crowd, brought a fasci
nating hope that maybe the fire
works we heard about would finally
go off. They did, but they were the
harmless anti-aircraft of Fourth of
July, jeweling the night as the first
torches were applied.
It's Lit!
Round the bonfire, hardly visible,
went the brand-bearers. Finally the
left-hand corner of the pile shot into
flame, and the light crept up, hand
over hand, to the tissue-covered cof
fin. It went in a flash, and with it the
pyre lit. up like an incandescent
lamp, flames leaping and reaching.
Then came the yells. The usual
yells find the usual smiles of Palo
Altans. "I he flames climbed down.

roar of 5000 roughs.
"The Indians are going to blow Cal
right out of their fingerbowl in
Raspberry Canyon," cried former
yell-leader Paul Speegle.
Tiny Moans—"Defeat"
"Cal is going to play better ball
than it has so far this season to beat
us Saturday," moaned Tiny.
"It might be 12-0, it might be 27-0,
but it will be a Stanford win,"
cheered "Bones" Hamilton.
And the 5000 roughs roared and
stamped as Big Game fever caught
them and swirled their spirit into a
rafter-shaking scries of yells.
Doodles Spews
Entertaining as an end in himself
was Doodles Weaver, who spewed
the contents of a gold-fish bowl,
grimaced, broke the tension. Also
entertaining was the entrance of
Officer Burns, who broke no ten
sion, spoke of breaking Doodles on
account of goldfish-spewing.
Then Webb raised his hands. The
march was on!
And the 5000 roughs oozed like a
thick syrup from the Pavilion, ran
like blots of mercury from the Pa
vilion, past the Quad to the shores
of Lagunita where 2000 Palo Altans,
ancient and modern, were gathered.
Bear Bear's Body
Down they came through the files,
bearing on their shoulders a coffin.
"Poor Cal, Poor Cal," they chanted.
Cameras clicked and the crowd made
way. Boathouse searchlights fingered
through the night and touched the
group faintly as they walked slowly
onto the flat of the bowl, dwarfed by
the 40-foot pyre.
Above was the drone of planes,
perhaps Cal's, perhaps Stanford's
own, that .sent a tide of whisper
through the crowd, brought a fasci
nating hope that maybe the fire
works we heard about would finally
go off. They did, but they were the
harmless anti-aircraft of Fourth of
July, jeweling the night as the first
torches were applied.
It's Lit!
Round the bonfire, hardly visible,
went the brand-bearers. Finally the
left-hand corner of the pile shot into
flame, and the light crept up, hand
over hand, to the tissue-covered cof
fin. It went in a flash, and with it the
pyre lit. up like an incandescent
lamp, flames leaping and reaching.
Then came the yells. The usual
yells find the usual smiles of Palo
Altans. "I he flames climbed down.
They buried Cal last, night*
And what h funeral it was! Not
50 but 6000 joyful mourners lined
the rim of the Lagunita lake-bed
while student pall-bearers toted his
coffin into the vast bowl and hoisted
it atop the biggest funeral pyre a
bear ever had.
It was a hail and farewell funeral
that Dore might have painted, with
eerie shadows, breathless distances,
and a light that only 100 tons of
yearning tinder can make.
Beginning and End
It was the beginning of another
Big Game, and the end of an evening
of Stanford spirit that swept down
from the Fiji house in a monster pa
rade, swarmed through the Pavilion,
and then streamed to the mile-long
bowl where the tattered Boar met
his fathers.
At 7 o'clock Webb Jones sounded
the tocsin from'the Pavilion plat
form, synthesizing the rustic and
roar of 5000 roughs.
"The Indians are going to blow Cal
right out of their fingerbowl in
Raspberry Canyon," cried former
yell-leader Paul Speegle.
