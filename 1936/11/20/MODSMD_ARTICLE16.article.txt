# Alert Frosh Discover Time Bomb In Bonfire
## Cal Men Plant Machine As Guards Watch 
### 
Stanford had its bonfire last
night, but how near the Indian came
to being burned in his own tepee
, was revealed by the discovery of an
: incendiary bomb in the pyre yester
day by two freshmen.
They were Phil Kellerman and
Douglas Bryan, who hauled an in
fernal machine from the bonfire
after it had been twice placed
there.
And working under the very
noses of Stanford guards Wednes
day were two Cal men, who engi
neered placement of the bomb, Daily
California!) executives informed the
Stanford Daily last night.
Set for 5:15 a.m.
The bomb, set to go off at 5:15
a.m. yesterday, was housed in a
15-foot square packing box, ap
parently hauled to the lake-bed
bonfire site along with other com
bustibles.
An alarm clock, hooked to two
dry cells and a magneto, was wet to
detonate a rag twisted into a fuse
with magnesium powder. Packed
around the device was excelsior.
Kellerman and Bryan revealed
that the box had been dumped into
the bonfire, and removed when
ground workers needed a box to
haul fuel. It had been emptied of
excelsior and again filled when the
two frosh discovered the infernal
device, they said, nailed to the back
of the box. The bomb was later
detonated. Why it did not explode
at the appointed hour, bonfire guards
were at a loss to explain.
The Delta Gamma house here re
ceived a phono call at 6 a.m. yes
terday from a U.C. student asking if
the bonfire bad been ignited.

land by 1000 al students was avert

President Leonard W. Charvet and
Graduate Manager Kenneth Priest
ly turned a "revenge mass meeting"
into a "pejice protest" on the Ber

Mailctt Confers
The critical situation led to a fly
ing trip by Stanford Executive
Committeeman Bob Mallett to
Berkeley yesterday '.afternoon,
where he conferred with student
body leaders and Ralph Settle, as
serted sophomore army ring leader.
Promises were asked and obtained
that no organized rctaliative action
would br attempted.
Executive action against the pro

by the contract between Stanford
and U.C. administrations provid
ing lhat student pre-game raids re
sulting in destruction to University
property of either campus could â€¢+
According to reliable sources at
| Berkeley, students there were
\ equipped to swoop on Stanford with
j four airplanes, 2UO automobiles, and
I a supply of tear gas "fatal to in
! sect life," dynamite, and incendiary
' bombs. They planned to capture
j the bonfire and ignite it.
At 4 p.m. yesterday, Mallett
communicated with Dr. Wilbur to
determine possibilities of game can
cellation in reply to inquiries by
U. C. authorities. Wilbur declared
that "Stanford should apologize
rather than protest, since Stanford
i has thus far suffered no damage,"
Mallett reported.
The three Cal sophomores recov
ered from the injuries suffered in
the Big "C" painting Tuesday morn

taken.
