## Cal Men Plant Machine As Guards Watch 
### 
Stanford had its bonfire last
night, but how near the Indian came
to being burned in his own tepee
, was revealed by the discovery of an
: incendiary bomb in the pyre yester
day by two freshmen.
They were Phil Kellerman and
Douglas Bryan, who hauled an in
fernal machine from the bonfire
after it had been twice placed
there.
And working under the very
noses of Stanford guards Wednes
day were two Cal men, who engi
neered placement of the bomb, Daily
California!) executives informed the
Stanford Daily last night.
Set for 5:15 a.m.
The bomb, set to go off at 5:15
a.m. yesterday, was housed in a
15-foot square packing box, ap
parently hauled to the lake-bed
bonfire site along with other com
bustibles.
An alarm clock, hooked to two
dry cells and a magneto, was wet to
detonate a rag twisted into a fuse
with magnesium powder. Packed
around the device was excelsior.
Kellerman and Bryan revealed
that the box had been dumped into
the bonfire, and removed when
ground workers needed a box to
haul fuel. It had been emptied of
excelsior and again filled when the
two frosh discovered the infernal
device, they said, nailed to the back
of the box. The bomb was later
detonated. Why it did not explode
at the appointed hour, bonfire guards
were at a loss to explain.
The Delta Gamma house here re

terday from a U.C. student asking if
the bonfire bad been ignited.
