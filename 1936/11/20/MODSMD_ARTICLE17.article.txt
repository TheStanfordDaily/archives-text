Cal's incendiary attempt on the
Big Game bonfire recalls three in
stances in the last decade when the
rally pyre was threatened by Bear
arsonists.
A handful of vandals sporting blue
and gold rooters' caps assaulted the
blaze builders in 1932 but caused no
damage to the ceremonial fire. Ob
servant guards ascertained that the
invaders wore Stanford buckles, so
an actual U.C. invasion was dis
counted as a Card hoax.
Fire Lit in '28
Twice was Cal foiled in '31 in try
ing to light, the bonfire. It wa.> ru
mored, however, that Coach Pop
Warner was threatened with abduc
tion.
"BONFIRE BURNS" screamed a
200-point streamer to Daily readers
November 20, 1928. A concealed time
bomb, ostensibly set by Cal students,
had ignited the 50-foot pyre 24
hours before rally time.
Cards Redden Cal "C"
As guards battled the flames in
vain, the cry arose "Rebuild the
Bonfire" and was taken up as a
cheer. The entire student body cut
classes and pitched in to construct
on schedule time a new rally con
flagration.
That year, the Cal "C" was painted
red in retaliation, as it had been in
1926. This stunt was repeated in
1831, and now in 1936.
