# Kick-off at 2; Cal Favored To Win
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Can they do it?
Can the 1936 Stanford football
| team carry on that four-year-old
I tradition that the Axe has not
changed hands, that a Thornhill -
coached team has not yet lost to
California?
These are the questions that lie
before the 80,000 and more people
who will file into the California Me
morial Stadium tomorrow to watch
the 42nd annual Big Game. The
festivities will begin with a 2
o'clock kick-off.
Bears Slight Favorites
Unlike the last three years, the
opinion on which of the two is the
stronger team seems evenly divided,
with a slight edge to California still
prevailing last night. Four would
probably get you five if Stanford
wins, with plenty of takers either
way stalking bay area streets.
The favoritism for California
evolves from the last two Golden
Bear victories of 13-7 over U.S.C.
and 28-0 over Oregon, in which,
resulting from a change of charging
tactics and offensive strategy adopt
ed in Berkeley practice two weeks
ago, the Bears have become a pow
erful, well-rounded club, with
deadly offensive punches.
Indians Practice Today
Stanford, on the other hand, to
the unbiased spectator appears a
weaker squad, with not much but a
fighting spirit and some prayer
passes to use as score-earning
equipment.
Tiny Thornhill ran his Cardinal
eleven through its last dress re
hearsal last night, in which the
"kids'' worked against California
formations, then ran their own
plays against the sawdust bags.
This afternoon will be some more
polishing off of plays in sweat suits,
letting off early, and then the
gridders are free until the team bus
leaves for Berkeley tomorrow
morning.
Won't Stint "Flash"
Thornhill and his "kids" don't
seem excited about the game; they
have a good psychological angle in
being underdogs, and are confident:
they know they can come from be
hind and score on anybody, and do
it quickly, and all week they have
been tutored on the weaknesses of
Stub Allison's men.
Says Tiny: "This is a hard one to
call, because the teams are so high
ly inspired that they don't play on
previous performance. We can cer
tainly win with a moderate degree
of luck, and there may be a lot of
scoring. Whatever happens, there'll
be a lot of excitement, because both
teams have flashy stuff, and they
won't be saving any of it."
Cal May Start Seniors
Says Stub: "I'd certainly like to
turn the tables on Stanford this
year, and so would the team."
California has lost Jud Callaghan,
an end, and will probably be with
out Ken Cotton, fullback, and
George Cornell, left half, who are
out with leg injuries. Stanford has
last Bill Paulman, a fullback, and
otherwise is in fine physical condi
tion.
California will probably start two
seniors, Archer and Nordstrom, six
juniors, and three sophomores.
Stanford will have three seniors,
Callaway, Hoos, and Williams, six
juniors, and two sophomores.
Cards To Run Tackles, Knds
There may be no title at stake,
but from the enthusiasm rampant on
both campi, no one would know it.
The teams are tied in Coast Confer
' ence standings at .500, California
with 3 wins and 3 losses, Stanford
j with two apiece and two ties.
The coaches are wary of giving
away their plans, but if present in
dications hold, each team will de
pend largely on its fullbacks for
line defense; California will at
tempt to run the middle, where she
believes Stanford to be weak, while
Stanford will run the tackles and
ends, where it is rumored Califor
nia could stand improvement.
lloos Is Captain
Neither team has an exceptional
line plunger; Coffis and Pollock on
the breakaways, Brigham and
Chapman on the punting, Calvelli
and Bottari on the passing, all
break fairly evenly in their cate
gories when viewed from the side
lines.
Earl Hoos will be captain and signal
caller for Stanford, and will be
playing his last Big Game, together
with Callaway, Williams, Schott,
Munger, and Mangan. Joe Vigna
will be relief on the signal calling,
and Clark will be captain if Hoos
goes out.
Selectors Have Material
All-coast selectors will keep their
eyes on Zagar, Clark, and Coffis of
Stanford, while Herwig, Meek, and
they say Bottari, are the stand
outs of the Bears.
Tentative starting line-ups:
Clark LER Schwartz
Zagar L.TR Nordstrom
Ferko LGR R. Hanford
Tsoutsouvas C Herwig
Matthews RGL Stockton
Callaway RTL de Varona
Stone REL Sparks
Hoos (C) Q Meek
Coffis LHR Chapman

it quickly, and all week they have
been tutored on the weaknesses of
Stub Allison's men.
Says Tiny: "This is a hard one to
call, because the teams are so high
ly inspired that they don't play on
previous performance. We can cer
tainly win with a moderate degree
of luck, and there may be a lot of
scoring. Whatever happens, there'll
be a lot of excitement, because both
teams have flashy stuff, and they
won't be saving any of it."
Cal May Start Seniors
Says Stub: "I'd certainly like to
turn the tables on Stanford this
year, and so would the team."
California has lost Jud Callaghan,
an end, and will probably be with
out Ken Cotton, fullback, and
George Cornell, left half, who are
out with leg injuries. Stanford has
last Bill Paulman, a fullback, and
otherwise is in fine physical condi
tion.
California will probably start two
seniors, Archer and Nordstrom, six
juniors, and three sophomores.
Stanford will have three seniors,
Callaway, Hoos, and Williams, six
juniors, and two sophomores.
Cards To Run Tackles, Knds
There may be no title at stake,
but from the enthusiasm rampant on
both campi, no one would know it.
The teams are tied in Coast Confer
' ence standings at .500, California
with 3 wins and 3 losses, Stanford
j with two apiece and two ties.
The coaches are wary of giving
away their plans, but if present in
dications hold, each team will de
pend largely on its fullbacks for
line defense; California will at
tempt to run the middle, where she
believes Stanford to be weak, while
Stanford will run the tackles and
ends, where it is rumored Califor
nia could stand improvement.
lloos Is Captain
Neither team has an exceptional
line plunger; Coffis and Pollock on
the breakaways, Brigham and
Chapman on the punting, Calvelli
and Bottari on the passing, all
break fairly evenly in their cate
gories when viewed from the side
lines.
Earl Hoos will be captain and signal
caller for Stanford, and will be
playing his last Big Game, together
with Callaway, Williams, Schott,
Munger, and Mangan. Joe Vigna
will be relief on the signal calling,
and Clark will be captain if Hoos
goes out.
Selectors Have Material
All-coast selectors will keep their
eyes on Zagar, Clark, and Coffis of
Stanford, while Herwig, Meek, and
they say Bottari, are the stand
outs of the Bears.
Tentative starting line-ups:
Clark LER Schwartz
Zagar L.TR Nordstrom
Ferko LGR R. Hanford
Tsoutsouvas C Herwig
Matthews RGL Stockton
Callaway RTL de Varona
Stone REL Sparks
Hoos (C) Q Meek
Coffis LHR Chapman

Can they do it?
Can the 1936 Stanford football
| team carry on that four-year-old
I tradition that the Axe has not
changed hands, that a Thornhill -
coached team has not yet lost to
California?
These are the questions that lie
before the 80,000 and more people
who will file into the California Me
morial Stadium tomorrow to watch
the 42nd annual Big Game. The
festivities will begin with a 2
o'clock kick-off.
Bears Slight Favorites
Unlike the last three years, the
opinion on which of the two is the
stronger team seems evenly divided,
with a slight edge to California still
prevailing last night. Four would
probably get you five if Stanford
wins, with plenty of takers either
way stalking bay area streets.
The favoritism for California
evolves from the last two Golden
Bear victories of 13-7 over U.S.C.
and 28-0 over Oregon, in which,
resulting from a change of charging
tactics and offensive strategy adopt
ed in Berkeley practice two weeks
ago, the Bears have become a pow
erful, well-rounded club, with
deadly offensive punches.
Indians Practice Today
Stanford, on the other hand, to
the unbiased spectator appears a
weaker squad, with not much but a
fighting spirit and some prayer
passes to use as score-earning
equipment.
Tiny Thornhill ran his Cardinal
eleven through its last dress re
hearsal last night, in which the
"kids'' worked against California
formations, then ran their own
plays against the sawdust bags.
This afternoon will be some more
polishing off of plays in sweat suits,
letting off early, and then the
gridders are free until the team bus
leaves for Berkeley tomorrow
morning.
Won't Stint "Flash"
Thornhill and his "kids" don't
seem excited about the game; they
have a good psychological angle in
being underdogs, and are confident:
they know they can come from be

it quickly, and all week they have

Earl Hoos will be captain and signal
caller for Stanford, and will be
playing his last Big Game, together
with Callaway, Williams, Schott,
Munger, and Mangan. Joe Vigna
will be relief on the signal calling,
and Clark will be captain if Hoos
goes out.
Selectors Have Material
All-coast selectors will keep their
eyes on Zagar, Clark, and Coffis of
Stanford, while Herwig, Meek, and
they say Bottari, are the stand
outs of the Bears.
Tentative starting line-ups:
Clark LER Schwartz
Zagar L.TR Nordstrom
Ferko LGR R. Hanford
Tsoutsouvas C Herwig
Matthews RGL Stockton
Callaway RTL de Varona
Stone REL Sparks
Hoos (C) Q Meek
Coffis LHR Chapman
Williams RHL Archer (C)
Brigham or F Anderson
Calvelli
Can they do it?
Can the 1936 Stanford football
| team carry on that four-year-old
I tradition that the Axe has not
changed hands, that a Thornhill -
coached team has not yet lost to
California?
These are the questions that lie
before the 80,000 and more people
who will file into the California Me
morial Stadium tomorrow to watch
the 42nd annual Big Game. The
festivities will begin with a 2
o'clock kick-off.
Bears Slight Favorites
Unlike the last three years, the
opinion on which of the two is the
stronger team seems evenly divided,
with a slight edge to California still
prevailing last night. Four would
probably get you five if Stanford
wins, with plenty of takers either
way stalking bay area streets.
The favoritism for California
evolves from the last two Golden
Bear victories of 13-7 over U.S.C.
and 28-0 over Oregon, in which,
resulting from a change of charging
tactics and offensive strategy adopt
ed in Berkeley practice two weeks
ago, the Bears have become a pow
erful, well-rounded club, with
deadly offensive punches.
Indians Practice Today
Stanford, on the other hand, to
the unbiased spectator appears a
weaker squad, with not much but a
fighting spirit and some prayer
passes to use as score-earning
equipment.
Tiny Thornhill ran his Cardinal
eleven through its last dress re
hearsal last night, in which the
"kids'' worked against California
formations, then ran their own
plays against the sawdust bags.
This afternoon will be some more
polishing off of plays in sweat suits,
letting off early, and then the
gridders are free until the team bus
leaves for Berkeley tomorrow
morning.
Won't Stint "Flash"
Thornhill and his "kids" don't
seem excited about the game; they
have a good psychological angle in
being underdogs, and are confident:
they know they can come from be
hind and score on anybody, and do
it quickly, and all week they have
been tutored on the weaknesses of
Stub Allison's men.
Says Tiny: "This is a hard one to
call, because the teams are so high
ly inspired that they don't play on
previous performance. We can cer
tainly win with a moderate degree
of luck, and there may be a lot of
scoring. Whatever happens, there'll
be a lot of excitement, because both
teams have flashy stuff, and they
won't be saving any of it."
Cal May Start Seniors
Says Stub: "I'd certainly like to
turn the tables on Stanford this
year, and so would the team."
California has lost Jud Callaghan,
an end, and will probably be with
out Ken Cotton, fullback, and
George Cornell, left half, who are
out with leg injuries. Stanford has
last Bill Paulman, a fullback, and
otherwise is in fine physical condi
tion.
California will probably start two
seniors, Archer and Nordstrom, six
juniors, and three sophomores.
Stanford will have three seniors,
Callaway, Hoos, and Williams, six
juniors, and two sophomores.
Cards To Run Tackles, Knds
There may be no title at stake,
but from the enthusiasm rampant on
both campi, no one would know it.
The teams are tied in Coast Confer
' ence standings at .500, California
with 3 wins and 3 losses, Stanford
j with two apiece and two ties.
The coaches are wary of giving
away their plans, but if present in
dications hold, each team will de
pend largely on its fullbacks for
line defense; California will at
tempt to run the middle, where she
believes Stanford to be weak, while
Stanford will run the tackles and
ends, where it is rumored Califor
nia could stand improvement.
lloos Is Captain
Neither team has an exceptional
line plunger; Coffis and Pollock on
the breakaways, Brigham and
Chapman on the punting, Calvelli
and Bottari on the passing, all
break fairly evenly in their cate
gories when viewed from the side
lines.
