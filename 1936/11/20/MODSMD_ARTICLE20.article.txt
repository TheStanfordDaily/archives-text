I have been told on confidential
authority that the alleged conking'
of the Big "C" guards over the head
was not part of the prearranged
plan of attack, and that the raiding
party as well as all the rest of us
considered it a bloody butch. But
no matter what happened on
Tightwad Hill, even the original
plan of attack on the Big "C" was
nothing more than a grab for front
page glory.
For years there has been a lot of
twaddle about "school spirit," as
Jorgi suggests, in the college movies
and in the Rover Boy books, until
( /eryone coming to college thinks
t'lat somehow the place is pretty
i 'ad unless the students make a
1 . rum-scarum expedition onto the
ii /al campus as big-game frenzy
s *thes to the boiling point. The
1; :t that college movies invariably
in :lude one number where the co
ir; jump on top the desks and do
a Busky Berkeley routine should
tip the boys off that Hollywood
never went to college and doesn't
know anything on the subject, and
the way the boys' books are full of
stuff about the star halfback's en
emy selling signals to the enemy
should let the boys know that Vic
tor Appleton doesn't know anything
aljf.ut college either.
* * *
T\;)w, as much as some people
be I. ?ve otherwise, I can still bend
do\ n without my joints creaking
and my beard is still under control,
and I do not sneer at wild expres
sion; of college exuberance like the
other night's raid. The first time
Cali ornia swiped the Stanford
axe, the stunt was a fine original
idta. Even when Stanford got the
axe back, the bit of hijacking re
quired to get it had all the ear
marks of being an inspiration.
b.:t I doubt if painting the Big
"C" is any expression of natural
wild exuberance. To be sure, no
body sent them over there. But
evei since the Big "C" was put up
there on the hill, Stanford boys
have gone tearing over there to
pain it, and the whole idea is very,
very old stuff. And a mob of men
crawling through the bushes for
almost a mile to surprise two or
tinea lonely guards is no especial
feat of great heroism, either.
* * *
Just as college boys with beer
feel some sort of necessity to sing
and make out like they're jolly
fellcws having a fine time, the
freshman class seems to feel that
people will think they are just not
the right sort unless they do what
all the college movies have told
them they ought to do.
If it weren't for the newspapers,
I doubt if a lot of college pranks
would ever be pulled off. For after
all, when you paint the Big "C" what
have you got? Nothing. Who said
nothing? Why, just think of all the
publicity you have!

sion; of college exuberance like the
other night's raid. The first time
Cali ornia swiped the Stanford
axe, the stunt was a fine original

axe back, the bit of hijacking re

b.:t I doubt if painting the Big
"C" is any expression of natural
wild exuberance. To be sure, no
body sent them over there. But
evei since the Big "C" was put up
there on the hill, Stanford boys
have gone tearing over there to
pain it, and the whole idea is very,
very old stuff. And a mob of men
crawling through the bushes for
almost a mile to surprise two or
tinea lonely guards is no especial
feat of great heroism, either.

Just as college boys with beer
feel some sort of necessity to sing
and make out like they're jolly
fellcws having a fine time, the
freshman class seems to feel that
people will think they are just not
the right sort unless they do what
all the college movies have told
them they ought to do.
If it weren't for the newspapers,
I doubt if a lot of college pranks
would ever be pulled off. For after
all, when you paint the Big "C" what
have you got? Nothing. Who said
nothing? Why, just think of all the
publicity you have!

I have been told on confidential
authority that the alleged conking'
of the Big "C" guards over the head
was not part of the prearranged
plan of attack, and that the raiding
party as well as all the rest of us
considered it a bloody butch. But
no matter what happened on
Tightwad Hill, even the original
plan of attack on the Big "C" was
nothing more than a grab for front
page glory.
For years there has been a lot of
twaddle about "school spirit," as
Jorgi suggests, in the college movies
and in the Rover Boy books, until
( /eryone coming to college thinks
t'lat somehow the place is pretty
i 'ad unless the students make a
1 . rum-scarum expedition onto the
ii /al campus as big-game frenzy
s *thes to the boiling point. The

in :lude one number where the co

a Busky Berkeley routine should
tip the boys off that Hollywood
never went to college and doesn't
know anything on the subject, and
the way the boys' books are full of
stuff about the star halfback's en
emy selling signals to the enemy
should let the boys know that Vic
