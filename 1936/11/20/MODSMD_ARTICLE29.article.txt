Junior Editor. The California!!
California spirit and"The Cardi
nals By Damned" raged rampant
last night at the annual California
men's smoker rally as Coach Stub
Allison conceded the Bears a fight
ing chanfce to win the Big Game.
Wisps of smoke curling rafter
ward from over 3000 cigarettes veiled
from all but the masculine element
of the University one of the "hot
test" Big Game smoker rallies on
record.
Meanwhile, A.S.U.C. President
Leonard W. Charvet, '37, Graduate
Manager Kenneth Priestly, and
Dean Thomas M. Putnam made
frantic efforts to squelch retaliatory
raids against the Indians.
Peace Agitation
Although Wednesday night's mass
raid on Stanford was averted,
A.S.U.C. and University officials
continued their peace moves in an
attempt to prevent a mass exodus
to the Farm alter last night's rally.
Dean Thomas B. Putnam issued
the following statement after con
sultation with Provost Monroe E.
Deutsch and Stanford officials.
"While it is true that there has
been much provocation to our stu
dents on account of the recent in
vasion of our campus by alleged
Stanford students in the attack at
the Big "C" and also in burning an
"S" on the playing field of the sta
dium, nevertheless the most digni
fied attitude for our students to take
is not to seek reprisals by counter
invasions on the Stanford campus.
"Thinking students will realize
that this can only endanger ath
letic relations between the two
universities and will come to no
good."
No Danger, Dr.
Rumors that Californians had
planned to kidnap Stanford's Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur were scof
fed at by Charvet and Big "C"
Guard Ralph Settle, '39.
"The Indians violated our gen
tlemen's agreement when they al
legedly slugged three Big "C"
guards, but we Californians have
no intentions of causing any phys
ical injury to Stanford students,
much less to their President,"
commented Settle.
"Incidentally, football games are
won at California Memorial Sta
dium, not at the Big "C" nor in
Lake Lagunita."
