# Unhappy Returns Over the Bay
## 
### 
Dear Jorgi:
Berkeley lowerclassmen are all in a dither
over a supposed raid on the Big "C" Tuesday
night by more than 100 Stanford men armed
with blackjacks and rubber hoses. According
to the tale which found its way into the Monarch
of College Dailies, the Farm laddies, after slug
ging the guards into unconsciousness, left the
hillside emblem red with paint and blood.
The story makes fine propaganda material.
The details dovetail perfectly with the popular
conception of Stanford men formed during the
tear gas raid era in which the Axe was captured.
The more gullible element of the Berkeley
population will be very much disappointed Sat
urday if the Stanford rooting section doesn't
feature a snappy machine gun brigade.
Cooler heads are inclined to suspect the
"raid" originated at least in part in the fertile
brain of one of out better indignation rousers.
In the past, Big "C" guards, in the glow of en
thusiasm for their duty, have been known to
sustain bruises from falls on the dark hillside.
We can hardly believe that, even at Stanford,
there are 100 men with enough gumption and
gasoline to travel clear to Berkeley for the pur
pose of breaking up a 3 a.m. hillside beer bust.
It wouldn't be gentlemanly!
I'm glad to hear that the Bonfire is progress
ing according to schedule. I have no doubt that
our Palo Alto High School allies will do their
part in helping beat the schedule when it comes
to the actual lighting.
Always strong for an informal atmosphere,
Cal has no official bonfire preceding the game.
Last year, the boys and girls had a jolly time
building impromptu blazes on the Bancroft Way
street car tracks, much to the irritation of the
worthy townspeople. A magnificent towering
pyre at the junction of Bancroft Way and Tele
graph Avenue, the vital intersecting point for
nearly all the street car lines in Berkeley,
crowned the festivities.
The "Razzberry," tabooed campus scandal
sheet, is due to make its annual appearance
Friday. Banned from the campus two years ago
after an indiscreet and erroneous expose of a
faculty nudist party, the "Berry" now dispenses
its choice gossip about campus moguls on the
far side of Sather Gate.
In case anybody down that way is interested,
the Loan Fund committee is sponsoring a dance
with Jimmy Dorsey's music Saturday night in
the men's gym at two dollars a couple.
I want to ask just one favor of you and the
second generation of laughing boys. We sen
iors at Cal don't want to be the second succes
sive class to graduate without having celebrated
a Big Game victory. The gentlemanly thing for
you and the lads to do is to drop this one.
Never forget that a Stanford man is a gentleman.
Many unhappy returns over the bay.
Yours,
Charlie Post, Editor, The Califcrnian
