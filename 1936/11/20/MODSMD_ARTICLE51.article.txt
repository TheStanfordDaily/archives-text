Even if the California authorities have suc
ceeded in holding back the punitive raids of
the thousand avengers from California, that
hasn't eased the tension on the Berkeley cam
pus much.
That Stanford was not torn apart yesterday
morning is due only to the efforts of Ken Priest
ley, A.S.U.C. graduate manager, and Leonard
Charvet, Cal student body president. Organized
by a group of the sophomore Big "C" guards
under the leadership of Ralph Settle, a motor
caravan of 50 cars was drawn up in front of the
steps of Wheeler Hall at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. Clever in organization, the movements
of the large group were carefully laid out step
by-step, to burn the Bonfire, lay waste Encina
and Seguoia, and desecrate the Quad.
The one effective appeal that student leaders
used to check the Wheeler Hall movement at
that time was that a city paper had come out
with the statement that President Wilbur would
call off the Big Game if Cal invaded Stanford
and did wanton damage. Wanton damage is
what they had in mind, since it seemed that
little enough could be done to repay the wan
tonness of the attacks laid to Stanford.
However, competition papers came out at 8
o'clock that morning with the statement that Dr.
Wilbur had made no threat to call off the Big
Game.
Dr. Wilbur's stand had remained unchanged,
though it had been subject to two different hasty
interpretations. Stanford had apparently been
the provoker. However, if the actions of the
California students in a mass raid wiping out
Stanford showed that rivalry between the two
schools had reached the point where it could
not bo rescued from a barbaric plane, he in
ferred that steps would naturally be taken in
carrying out the provisions of the Stanford-Cali
fornia athletic agreement. He had, therefore,

in response to requests for information merely
pointed out the terms of the agreement. Cali
fornia had made no move. Stanford was plainly
in the wrong. He had made no threat to Cali
fornia students.
The second newspaper's angle was that no
action would be taken, however. This started
California off again, and few students went to
class yesterday as excited crowds milled about
the Berkeley grounds. A large assembly was
held and President Robert Gordon Sproul
dampened the ardor a bit. It was not until after
noon, though, that Settle and his organization
could be swung into line by the united efforts
of the conciliatory bodies. The leaders prom
ised to do what they could to clamp down, but
could not guarantee they could withhold their
excited followers. The latest advices from Ber
keley indicate, however, that the California
men, after their traditionally masculine Big
Game Rally, were venting their enthusiasm with
disturbing Berkeley's peace and quiet on the
car tracks in town and would not raid the cam
pus after the Bonre last night.
The situation as it stands at Cal right now is
fairly tense, boding ill for peaceful relations
between rooting sections tomorrow. The Cal
students fairly logically feel that they have
been thwarted in reprisals for a rather cowardly
and juvenile exhibition on Stanford's part. Cal
is by reputation easily excited over football,
and this week's events have brought the ex
citement past the saturation point.
The past few days have found Stanford on
the defensive. The foolish actions of the frosh
practically have been a gift to the Cal team of
one or two touchdowns in "revenge" psychol
ogy.
Worked up by the repetition of alarums, the
excitement of guarding the Bonfire, Stanford
also is high strung. The rally last night ex
hibited a new flux of enthusiasm unknown to
this college generation.
This combination of factors makes for trouble
tomorrow. Perhaps California will never believe
it, but Stanford should prove by the action of
its student rooting section that it is collectively
civilized, even though individuals' actions may
indicate otherwise.
There are ample opportunities for disaster
tomorrow.
Stanford should show its typical cavalier
spirit toward actions of referees and players on
the field. The Rally Committee should see to it
that there is no serpentine or goal post uproot
ing in the event of a Stanford victory. Student
rooters would be smart to ditch their rooters'
hats while entering or leaving the stadium.
California feels obligated to get even soon,
maybe not tomorrow, but they will in time, and
I cannot say that I blame them for trying.

ceeded in holding back the punitive raids of

could be swung into line by the united efforts
of the conciliatory bodies. The leaders prom
ised to do what they could to clamp down, but
could not guarantee they could withhold their
excited followers. The latest advices from Ber
keley indicate, however, that the California
men, after their traditionally masculine Big
Game Rally, were venting their enthusiasm with
disturbing Berkeley's peace and quiet on the
car tracks in town and would not raid the cam
pus after the Bonre last night.
The situation as it stands at Cal right now is
fairly tense, boding ill for peaceful relations
between rooting sections tomorrow. The Cal
students fairly logically feel that they have
been thwarted in reprisals for a rather cowardly
and juvenile exhibition on Stanford's part. Cal
is by reputation easily excited over football,
and this week's events have brought the ex
citement past the saturation point.
The past few days have found Stanford on
the defensive. The foolish actions of the frosh
practically have been a gift to the Cal team of
one or two touchdowns in "revenge" psychol
ogy.
Worked up by the repetition of alarums, the
excitement of guarding the Bonfire, Stanford
also is high strung. The rally last night ex
hibited a new flux of enthusiasm unknown to
this college generation.
This combination of factors makes for trouble
tomorrow. Perhaps California will never believe
it, but Stanford should prove by the action of
its student rooting section that it is collectively
civilized, even though individuals' actions may
indicate otherwise.
There are ample opportunities for disaster
tomorrow.
Stanford should show its typical cavalier
spirit toward actions of referees and players on
the field. The Rally Committee should see to it
that there is no serpentine or goal post uproot
ing in the event of a Stanford victory. Student
rooters would be smart to ditch their rooters'
hats while entering or leaving the stadium.
California feels obligated to get even soon,
maybe not tomorrow, but they will in time, and
I cannot say that I blame them for trying.
Even if the California authorities have suc
ceeded in holding back the punitive raids of
the thousand avengers from California, that
hasn't eased the tension on the Berkeley cam
pus much.
That Stanford was not torn apart yesterday
morning is due only to the efforts of Ken Priest
ley, A.S.U.C. graduate manager, and Leonard
Charvet, Cal student body president. Organized
by a group of the sophomore Big "C" guards
under the leadership of Ralph Settle, a motor
caravan of 50 cars was drawn up in front of the
steps of Wheeler Hall at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. Clever in organization, the movements
of the large group were carefully laid out step
by-step, to burn the Bonfire, lay waste Encina
and Seguoia, and desecrate the Quad.
The one effective appeal that student leaders
used to check the Wheeler Hall movement at
that time was that a city paper had come out
with the statement that President Wilbur would
call off the Big Game if Cal invaded Stanford
and did wanton damage. Wanton damage is
what they had in mind, since it seemed that
little enough could be done to repay the wan
tonness of the attacks laid to Stanford.
However, competition papers came out at 8
o'clock that morning with the statement that Dr.
Wilbur had made no threat to call off the Big
Game.
Dr. Wilbur's stand had remained unchanged,
though it had been subject to two different hasty
interpretations. Stanford had apparently been
the provoker. However, if the actions of the
California students in a mass raid wiping out
Stanford showed that rivalry between the two
schools had reached the point where it could
not bo rescued from a barbaric plane, he in
ferred that steps would naturally be taken in
carrying out the provisions of the Stanford-Cali
fornia athletic agreement. He had, therefore,

in response to requests for information merely
pointed out the terms of the agreement. Cali
fornia had made no move. Stanford was plainly
in the wrong. He had made no threat to Cali
fornia students.
The second newspaper's angle was that no
action would be taken, however. This started
California off again, and few students went to
class yesterday as excited crowds milled about
the Berkeley grounds. A large assembly was
held and President Robert Gordon Sproul
dampened the ardor a bit. It was not until after
noon, though, that Settle and his organization
could be swung into line by the united efforts
of the conciliatory bodies. The leaders prom

Charvet, Cal student body president. Organized
by a group of the sophomore Big "C" guards
under the leadership of Ralph Settle, a motor
caravan of 50 cars was drawn up in front of the
steps of Wheeler Hall at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. Clever in organization, the movements
of the large group were carefully laid out step
by-step, to burn the Bonfire, lay waste Encina
and Seguoia, and desecrate the Quad.
The one effective appeal that student leaders
used to check the Wheeler Hall movement at
that time was that a city paper had come out
with the statement that President Wilbur would
call off the Big Game if Cal invaded Stanford
and did wanton damage. Wanton damage is
what they had in mind, since it seemed that
little enough could be done to repay the wan
tonness of the attacks laid to Stanford.
However, competition papers came out at 8
o'clock that morning with the statement that Dr.
Wilbur had made no threat to call off the Big
Game.
Dr. Wilbur's stand had remained unchanged,
though it had been subject to two different hasty
interpretations. Stanford had apparently been
the provoker. However, if the actions of the
California students in a mass raid wiping out
Stanford showed that rivalry between the two
schools had reached the point where it could
not bo rescued from a barbaric plane, he in
ferred that steps would naturally be taken in
carrying out the provisions of the Stanford-Cali
fornia athletic agreement. He had, therefore,

in response to requests for information merely
pointed out the terms of the agreement. Cali
fornia had made no move. Stanford was plainly
in the wrong. He had made no threat to Cali
fornia students.
The second newspaper's angle was that no
action would be taken, however. This started
California off again, and few students went to
class yesterday as excited crowds milled about
the Berkeley grounds. A large assembly was
held and President Robert Gordon Sproul
dampened the ardor a bit. It was not until after
noon, though, that Settle and his organization
could be swung into line by the united efforts
of the conciliatory bodies. The leaders prom
ised to do what they could to clamp down, but
could not guarantee they could withhold their
excited followers. The latest advices from Ber
keley indicate, however, that the California
men, after their traditionally masculine Big
Game Rally, were venting their enthusiasm with
disturbing Berkeley's peace and quiet on the
car tracks in town and would not raid the cam
pus after the Bonre last night.
The situation as it stands at Cal right now is
fairly tense, boding ill for peaceful relations
between rooting sections tomorrow. The Cal
students fairly logically feel that they have
been thwarted in reprisals for a rather cowardly
and juvenile exhibition on Stanford's part. Cal
is by reputation easily excited over football,
and this week's events have brought the ex
citement past the saturation point.
The past few days have found Stanford on
the defensive. The foolish actions of the frosh
practically have been a gift to the Cal team of
one or two touchdowns in "revenge" psychol
ogy.
Worked up by the repetition of alarums, the
excitement of guarding the Bonfire, Stanford
also is high strung. The rally last night ex
hibited a new flux of enthusiasm unknown to
this college generation.
This combination of factors makes for trouble
tomorrow. Perhaps California will never believe
it, but Stanford should prove by the action of
its student rooting section that it is collectively
civilized, even though individuals' actions may
indicate otherwise.
There are ample opportunities for disaster
tomorrow.
Stanford should show its typical cavalier
spirit toward actions of referees and players on
the field. The Rally Committee should see to it
that there is no serpentine or goal post uproot
ing in the event of a Stanford victory. Student
rooters would be smart to ditch their rooters'
hats while entering or leaving the stadium.
California feels obligated to get even soon,
maybe not tomorrow, but they will in time, and
I cannot say that I blame them for trying.
