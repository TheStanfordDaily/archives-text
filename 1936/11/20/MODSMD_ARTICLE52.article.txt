BIGAMEITIS
Dear Bobs:
In our argument over Monetary Democracy, I didn't
realize that you were going to the Big Game, also to
the Gaieties, and that you have bought a Quad.
I am wondering how you did this. Previously I was
under the impression that no one but Mr. Morgcnthau
could have his Big Game ticket and his pocketbook too,
but you surely have gone him one better.

Now about the Big Game. It is Big but it is not a
local Dckcs and the bonfire committcc to set it on fire,
the Daily, but it seems to me everyone has forgotten
about the four quarters of play, fifteen minutes each,
and everyone is worrying about totally irrelevant
matters.
Among these is a bonfire. Stanford seems to want
to light it, and so does Cal.
Why all the confusion? Lighting a bonfire is a
very simple business. I do it every day with the gar
bage, and I don't get any kick out of it. So oven if
a Cal man did light it, what would be the difference?
Please advise me.

Of course the Bonfire is only the beginning, ac
cording to the Daily. There is a rally which has gone
through five movie stars and three nervous break
downs. I can't see what effect that will have on the
Big Game as it is played on a 100-yard strip of lawn
at U.C. Saturday.
Nor can I sec what good are those awful stickers all
over your car. They just add to the general litter
when you come home. Please advise the Stanford
Mothers' Club.

Why don't they forget about this garbage and go
about their business until it comes time for the
kickofT. Then everyone would get. some sleep and
the team wouldn't be in a state of prima donna tem
perament.
Please don't send me your bills. I am returning the
last batch. Wear a raincoat if it rains.
Love as always,
Mother
