Buck in the halcyon days of the early 1920s when
the Stanford Rough was rough and did not go about
pulling petty theft, malicious mischief, and beating up
guys outnumbered 25-1, they had the bonfire behind
Encina Hall.
And the chairman of the Bonfire fete lived in Eai
cina. Being a very enthusiastic person, he wanted to
stir up some school spirit for his Bonfire. So he worked
out an elaborate system.
He placed a time-bomb in the pyre, and then tpn
nclcd pipes into his room. In the room he had a battery
of chemicals mixed up. When the time-bomb went
ofl, thf Bonfire started to blaze, people rallied around
to fight the fire and the vicious Cal men, the committee
man poured the chemicals down the tube, smothered
the fire.
The next day, school spirit was aroused to a fever
pitch. Stanford built the "biggest bonfire in history,"
and the bonfire chairman went down on the pages of
Stanford history as a hero, a scholar, a chemist, and a
gentleman. He could put on (ires and he could al*o
put 'em out.
