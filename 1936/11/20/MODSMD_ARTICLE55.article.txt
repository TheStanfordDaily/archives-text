GAIETIES TONIGHT! The show's
a sell-out, so we don't have to plug
it today, but we will take time to
tell those who are going that they'll
see a swell show.
The Gaieties are always lots of
fun, and this one will be no excep
tion. Best feature of show, we pre
dict, will be its lack of dancing
chorus. Aside from that crack at an
old tradition, we'll content ourselves
with saying that Director Phil Brown
has loaded the show with comedy,
and Mac Gordon's score is his best
ever.
REMEMBER JIMMY DORSEY at
Cal tomorrow night! That guy can
squeeze more swell swing from 12
pieces than almost anybody else we
know. Two trumpets give sharpness,
three trombones lend mellowness
and depth, three saxes contribute a
certain measure of sweetness, and
the guitar, bass, drums, and piano
back it up. And then of course
there's Jimmy's clarinet of sax for
piquancy. (Boy, are we hot!)
AMUSING SIGHT: The gals who
put themselves on display at the
English corner between classes, just
too, too cute for words, the little
darlings.
