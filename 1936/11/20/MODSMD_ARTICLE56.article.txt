### 
Highly entertaining in musical
comedy, but far from true to life,
PIGSKIN PARADE presents a lively
and collegiate setting using such
Hollywood beauties as Betty Grable,
Arline Judge, and Judy as coeds,
and All-American heroes as the
gridiron bone busters. Stewart
Erwin played the role of hero as a
watermelon - heaving farmer, who
made good on the gridiron, and, as
usual, got the girl he loved, Arline
Judge. Judy Gax-land, as is said, stole
the show along with the Yacht Club
Boys. The former is a new-found
songstress with real personality in
her voice and everywhere else; the
latter are clever boys with good
voices and clever ditties.
YELLOWSTONE was just another
poor excuse for a movie, and not
even a good travel guide. You fel
lows that just want to see one show
will be smart to do so in this case.â€”-
