GKADK FALLACIES
The Editor, Sir:
The administration claims that if
everybody taking a test gets a hun
dred, the test is no good. They give
tests that measure, roughly, the
number of facts the student has
learned in a course, without show
ing whether or not he has learned
anything worth remembering. This
system of grading according to a
numerical total of facts, gives the
student who crams and memorizes,
an advantage over the student who
can discard irrelevant details and
remember essentials.
When the University gives units
for a course, it certifies that the
student has understood that course.
If examinations do not measure
comprehension, the degrees that
are based on those units mean little
or nothing.
Class averages should indicate
mass comprehension. They should
vary with the mass ability of class

es and the individual ability of in
structors.
Good grades are no doubt an in
dication of the conventional co
operative attitude, combined with
willingness and ability to do what
the University demands. I believe,
however, that the University de
mands the wrong thing. In my
opinion, the necessity for competi
tive memorizing takes time that
would be better spent on honest
study and thought.
