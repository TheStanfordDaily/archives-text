# Cal Sees Win Despite Losses Of Key Men
## 14,000 Rooters Can't Be Wrong, Says Cal Writer; Improved Kicking, Passing Predicted 
### BOB WESSON Sports Editor, Daily Californian 
California will win the Big Game!
As Old Lady Tradition reaches down into her jewel box tomorrow to
bring forth her brightest gem—the Big Game—the cry of "Beat Stanford"
rising from 14,000 throats will sweep the Golden Bears to their first win
since 1931 in the gridiron classic of the Pacific Coast.
That spirit, irresistible as the tides, rose and is rising yet in the face of
paralyzing injuries to key men in the California attack and the threat
of a rapidly improving Big Red Machine.

The forty-second renewal of the
West's Blue Ribbon sporting event
will find 82,000 violent partisans lin
ing the slopes of the Memorial Sta
dium at 2 p.m. tomorrow when the
official's whistle sounds the begin
ning of another bitterly fought
struggle.
Unlike previous years, tomorrow's
game means nothing in the Confer
ence race. year, and the year
before, visions of Hose Bowl games
filled the sleep of both teams, while
the eyes of the Coast were upon the
struggle.
Tomorrow it is just the Big Game,
victory in which will salvage a dis
mal season for either team.
This year California fans have rea
son for hope.
California will win, say 14,000 Cal
ifornia students, and point to the
threat of chunky Vic Bottari's pass
ing arm to bring them the fruits of
victory.
And on that threat rest Califor
nia's chances. After outgaining the
Trojans on the ground, the Bears fell
back upon the Vallejo sophomore,
for a score, and he brought it with
two plays.
Tomoi row the Bears will be handi
capped by the loss of two first-string
tackles, and their running attack
will be just that much weaker.
Dave deVarona and Milt Pollack
suffered twisted ankles in the Ore
gon tilt, and will not see action to
morrow. In their places will start a
pair of seniors, Gene McAtcer and
Ray Nordstrom, and behind the vet-
erans will be a pair of eager, willing,
but. inexperienced sophomores, Bill
Stoll aiu! Ray Hanford. Hanford will
see double duty, also acting as re
lief for Claude Evans at left guard.
Because of that weakness, and
Stanford's similar lack of punch, to
morrow's game will be a wide open
game, with both teams using for
wards, laterals, and breakaway
speed.
Season statistics give the Bears an
edge in the aerial game, having com
pleted 3(5 of 88 tosses thrown for a
gain of 567 yards. Opponents have
completed only 40 of 128 thro wo,
with 19 interceptions by the Bears.
For breakaway speed ihe Bears
can use little Mushy Pollock, track
captain and sprint star, who has
shown that he can handle the safety
position well enough to rival the
vaunted Coffis of Stanford.
Opening the game at left half, key
position in the California backfield,
will be "Wild Bill" Archer, who has
never yet realized his capabilities.
Should the eccentric southpaw de
cide to really play in his last game
he will change the complexion of
the game in a twinkling.
Behind him comes the little Mushy
Pollock, who may also start if the
Bears receive. In the meantime Vic
Bottari will be on the bench to take
a look and listen to the "Top Sarge's"
advice.
Although Stanford's line is con
sidered a better unit, the Bears yield
only at the ends and tackles. To
bolster the center of the line All -
American Bob Herwig will team with
quarterback John Meek to form the
finest pair of defensive fullbacks in
the country.
With the veteran Vard Stockton
returned to the lineup the Bears will
hold the upper hand at the guard
positions. Behind Stockton and
Claude Evans come two brothers,
Ray and Bill Hanford.
The converted fullback, Perry
Schwartz, will man right end, with
pass-catching, place-kicking Henry
Sparks on the left flank. At right
half Sam Chapman, blocker, kicker,
passer, and runner, will carry the
mail. The fullback position will be
handled by Dave Anderson, sopho
more, in a manner that may make
Stanford rooters regret the injured
Ken Cotton.
All in all. the Big Game adds up
to a contest between equal lines,
with the Bears holding the edge in
the backfield.
Tiny Thornhill and the Stanford
team think they are on the way to a
19o(j Big Game victory.
But Stub Allison and his 14,000
supporters have other ideas.

All in all. the Big Game adds up
to a contest between equal lines,
with the Bears holding the edge in
the backfield.
Tiny Thornhill and the Stanford
team think they are on the way to a
19o(j Big Game victory.
But Stub Allison and his 14,000
supporters have other ideas.
California will win the Big Game!
As Old Lady Tradition reaches down into her jewel box tomorrow to
bring forth her brightest gem—the Big Game—the cry of "Beat Stanford"
rising from 14,000 throats will sweep the Golden Bears to their first win
since 1931 in the gridiron classic of the Pacific Coast.
That spirit, irresistible as the tides, rose and is rising yet in the face of
paralyzing injuries to key men in the California attack and the threat
of a rapidly improving Big Red Machine.

The forty-second renewal of the
West's Blue Ribbon sporting event
will find 82,000 violent partisans lin
ing the slopes of the Memorial Sta
dium at 2 p.m. tomorrow when the
official's whistle sounds the begin
ning of another bitterly fought
struggle.
Unlike previous years, tomorrow's
game means nothing in the Confer
ence race. year, and the year
before, visions of Hose Bowl games
filled the sleep of both teams, while
the eyes of the Coast were upon the
struggle.
Tomorrow it is just the Big Game,
victory in which will salvage a dis
mal season for either team.
This year California fans have rea
son for hope.
California will win, say 14,000 Cal
ifornia students, and point to the
threat of chunky Vic Bottari's pass
ing arm to bring them the fruits of
victory.
And on that threat rest Califor
nia's chances. After outgaining the
Trojans on the ground, the Bears fell
back upon the Vallejo sophomore,
for a score, and he brought it with
two plays.
Tomoi row the Bears will be handi
capped by the loss of two first-string
tackles, and their running attack
will be just that much weaker.
Dave deVarona and Milt Pollack
suffered twisted ankles in the Ore
gon tilt, and will not see action to
morrow. In their places will start a
pair of seniors, Gene McAtcer and
Ray Nordstrom, and behind the vet-
erans will be a pair of eager, willing,
but. inexperienced sophomores, Bill
Stoll aiu! Ray Hanford. Hanford will
see double duty, also acting as re
lief for Claude Evans at left guard.
Because of that weakness, and
Stanford's similar lack of punch, to
morrow's game will be a wide open
game, with both teams using for
wards, laterals, and breakaway
speed.
Season statistics give the Bears an
edge in the aerial game, having com
pleted 3(5 of 88 tosses thrown for a
gain of 567 yards. Opponents have
completed only 40 of 128 thro wo,
with 19 interceptions by the Bears.
For breakaway speed ihe Bears
can use little Mushy Pollock, track
captain and sprint star, who has
shown that he can handle the safety
position well enough to rival the
vaunted Coffis of Stanford.
Opening the game at left half, key
position in the California backfield,
will be "Wild Bill" Archer, who has
never yet realized his capabilities.
Should the eccentric southpaw de
cide to really play in his last game
he will change the complexion of
the game in a twinkling.
Behind him comes the little Mushy
Pollock, who may also start if the
Bears receive. In the meantime Vic
Bottari will be on the bench to take
a look and listen to the "Top Sarge's"
advice.
Although Stanford's line is con
sidered a better unit, the Bears yield
only at the ends and tackles. To
bolster the center of the line All -
American Bob Herwig will team with
quarterback John Meek to form the
finest pair of defensive fullbacks in
the country.
With the veteran Vard Stockton
returned to the lineup the Bears will
hold the upper hand at the guard
positions. Behind Stockton and
Claude Evans come two brothers,
Ray and Bill Hanford.
The converted fullback, Perry
Schwartz, will man right end, with
pass-catching, place-kicking Henry
Sparks on the left flank. At right
half Sam Chapman, blocker, kicker,
passer, and runner, will carry the
mail. The fullback position will be
handled by Dave Anderson, sopho
more, in a manner that may make
Stanford rooters regret the injured
Ken Cotton.

mail. The fullback position will be
handled by Dave Anderson, sopho
more, in a manner that may make
Stanford rooters regret the injured
Ken Cotton.
All in all. the Big Game adds up
to a contest between equal lines,
with the Bears holding the edge in
the backfield.
Tiny Thornhill and the Stanford
team think they are on the way to a
19o(j Big Game victory.
But Stub Allison and his 14,000
supporters have other ideas.
California will win the Big Game!
As Old Lady Tradition reaches down into her jewel box tomorrow to
bring forth her brightest gem—the Big Game—the cry of "Beat Stanford"
rising from 14,000 throats will sweep the Golden Bears to their first win
since 1931 in the gridiron classic of the Pacific Coast.
That spirit, irresistible as the tides, rose and is rising yet in the face of
paralyzing injuries to key men in the California attack and the threat
of a rapidly improving Big Red Machine.

The forty-second renewal of the
West's Blue Ribbon sporting event
will find 82,000 violent partisans lin
ing the slopes of the Memorial Sta
dium at 2 p.m. tomorrow when the
official's whistle sounds the begin
ning of another bitterly fought
struggle.
Unlike previous years, tomorrow's
game means nothing in the Confer
ence race. year, and the year
before, visions of Hose Bowl games
filled the sleep of both teams, while
the eyes of the Coast were upon the
struggle.
Tomorrow it is just the Big Game,
victory in which will salvage a dis
mal season for either team.
This year California fans have rea
son for hope.
California will win, say 14,000 Cal
ifornia students, and point to the
threat of chunky Vic Bottari's pass
ing arm to bring them the fruits of
victory.
And on that threat rest Califor
nia's chances. After outgaining the
Trojans on the ground, the Bears fell
back upon the Vallejo sophomore,
for a score, and he brought it with
two plays.
Tomoi row the Bears will be handi
capped by the loss of two first-string
tackles, and their running attack
will be just that much weaker.
Dave deVarona and Milt Pollack
suffered twisted ankles in the Ore
gon tilt, and will not see action to
morrow. In their places will start a
pair of seniors, Gene McAtcer and
Ray Nordstrom, and behind the vet-
erans will be a pair of eager, willing,
but. inexperienced sophomores, Bill
Stoll aiu! Ray Hanford. Hanford will
see double duty, also acting as re
lief for Claude Evans at left guard.
Because of that weakness, and
Stanford's similar lack of punch, to
morrow's game will be a wide open
game, with both teams using for
wards, laterals, and breakaway
speed.
Season statistics give the Bears an
edge in the aerial game, having com
pleted 3(5 of 88 tosses thrown for a
gain of 567 yards. Opponents have
completed only 40 of 128 thro wo,
with 19 interceptions by the Bears.
For breakaway speed ihe Bears
can use little Mushy Pollock, track
captain and sprint star, who has
shown that he can handle the safety
position well enough to rival the
vaunted Coffis of Stanford.
Opening the game at left half, key
position in the California backfield,
will be "Wild Bill" Archer, who has
never yet realized his capabilities.
Should the eccentric southpaw de
cide to really play in his last game
he will change the complexion of
the game in a twinkling.
Behind him comes the little Mushy
Pollock, who may also start if the
Bears receive. In the meantime Vic
Bottari will be on the bench to take
a look and listen to the "Top Sarge's"
advice.
Although Stanford's line is con
sidered a better unit, the Bears yield
only at the ends and tackles. To
bolster the center of the line All -
American Bob Herwig will team with
quarterback John Meek to form the
finest pair of defensive fullbacks in
the country.
With the veteran Vard Stockton
returned to the lineup the Bears will
hold the upper hand at the guard
positions. Behind Stockton and
Claude Evans come two brothers,
Ray and Bill Hanford.
The converted fullback, Perry
Schwartz, will man right end, with
pass-catching, place-kicking Henry
Sparks on the left flank. At right
half Sam Chapman, blocker, kicker,
passer, and runner, will carry the
mail. The fullback position will be
handled by Dave Anderson, sopho
more, in a manner that may make
Stanford rooters regret the injured
Ken Cotton.
