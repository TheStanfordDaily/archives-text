"It's in the bag!" screamed Mr. T.
Isadore Drofnats late last night over
the telephone (collect, of course).
"Did you hear about the latest
news?" he continued. "Stub fears the
Stanford line. For that matter, he
probably fears my line, too. So how

"I'm going to pull a fasty. When
nobody is looking, I'm going to
change the directions for the card
stunts so that the Bears will be doing
our super-thrillers, and we, the
Cards, will be flipping their cards.
Some fun, huh!
"Place your bets, because Drofnats
never misses the misses. For that
matter, the misses never miss me,
either. Anyhoo, I pick the score,
which will be copyrighted in every
detail, to be Stanford 21, Cal. 14.
Yippee!"
