# 'Jeemy' Rated Tops by Farm Co-Eds

### MARGARET LOUD 
Coflis scores again! But it's not a
touchdown, nor is it a Keeble pen
award. This time it's as ladies' fa
vorite on the football squad.
The peppy little half-back, who's
done so much work on the Indian
team thjs season, was voted the
most attractive, best-liked player
on the football squad in a survey
of 600 Stanford women held this

week. Second to Coflis in sex ap
peal, according to Farm co-eds, is
"Cab" Calloway, while Grant
Stone and Louis Tsoutsouvas run
a close third and fourth respec
tively.
Coffis, say the women, is attractive
because he looks like a teddy bear,
because he's little and cute and
doesn't know it, because he waddles
like a duck, and because he's not
conceited. His curly hair, dark
brown eyes, and enthusiasm on the
football field also pulled down a
good share of votes for him.
One Stanford woman says she
votes for Coflis because "he ap
peals to my maternal instinct";
another "because he belongs to my
cousin's house"; a third "because
he cut up my first frog in biology";
and a fourth "because lie gave us
chewing gum one day."
Favorite football hero of the fresh
man women is "Cab" Calloway, sec
ond in the entire contest. He has sex
appeal, according to survey results,
because he's big and blond and one
of the few tall men on the Farm.
Also, believe his freshman admirers,
he's one of the few bright members
of the squad and"he docs things be
iides play football."
Other talking points for Cab arc
bis "adorable crooning," cute
teeth, pretty underwear, and gocd

dancing. One woman likes him
because "he's big and kind-look
ing—like a St. Bernard."
Third among th£ favorites is Grant
Stone, who lacks only one vote of
tying Calloway for second place.
Stone is popular because he has nice
eyes and smile, a big strong phy
sique, a handsome face, and "be
cause he makes such nice passes."
Tsoutsouvas rates fourth place
among the women chiefly because
his name intrigues them. "It's
hard to spell and more like a
sneeze to pronounce," and it re
minds one little frosli of when she
used to play train.
Jake Brigham got a number of
votes for looking like "the best date
on the campus." "But he's been go
ing steady for six years so what's
the use?" asks one disappointed
co-ed. Pretty Bob Mangan. also high
in the running, is another one who
"probably can't be had."
Other grid heroes rated high in
sex appeal are Fred Williams and
Jack Clark. Three women pre
fer Ernie Ncvers "because he has
graduated."
Carl Schott has sex appeal be
cause he kisses goodnight so di
vinely, the survey revealed; Bob
Matthews because "he's a pudgy
wudgy cutie-pie"; Joe Vigtia be
cause he is roly-poly and cute, and

has dimples. Leo Ferko and Pop
Grant were asked on one ballot to
call Union, Room 220.
A few co-eds profess themselves
indifferent to football players ex
cept when they're on the field. "It
just so happens that I'm not inter
ested in what the football players
look like," writes one hero-debunk
er. "Sorry to disillusion you about
one freshman woman at least."
