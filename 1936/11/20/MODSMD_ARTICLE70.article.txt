# Earl Hoos Will Lead Card Grid Team Tomorrow
## 
### 
Earl "Maw" Hoos, rugged Dutch
dynamo who calls the plays at quar
terback for this model of the Big
Red Machine, will go into the Big
Game as Stanford's acting captain
tomorrow.
The task of handling both a team's
strategy and maintaining the legal
rights is not often given to one man,
but Hoos has been doing it all sea
son.
California has not yet named its
acting captain for the game. The
system of not electing a regular cap
tain is used by the Bears the same
as at Stanford.
