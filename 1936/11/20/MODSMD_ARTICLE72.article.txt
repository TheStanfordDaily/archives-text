# Aerial Antics To Highlight Annual Clash
## Allison Promises Best Show; Bottari Ranked as Key Man; Cotton, de Varona, Cornell Out 
### HERB DIAMOND 
Big Game!
Into the air it lias already put spirit and fire aplenty. And, appro
priately enough, into the air will go much of the traditional clash.
With their respective warriors awaiting the opening whistle of the
Big Game. Tiny Thornhill and Stub Allison handy no words in announcing
that there will he passing and more passing, a goodly supply of laterals,

deception—a wide-open dis
play of some indeed spectacular foot
ball. Victory for the Golden Bears
would mean their first legal posses
sion of the time-honored Stanford
j Axe, and moral satisfaction of tre
: mendous proportions.
If for no other reason than the fact
that tomorrow's victor is expected to
be decided more or less by aerial
! attack prowess, California is depend
ing upon five gentlemen to do the
honors. Spotlighted on the battle
turf will be Vard Stockton, Gene
McAteer, Claude Evans, Bob Her
wig, and Johnny Meek.
Five to Hold Indians
Present indications bring a mag
nitudinous task to the flashy five. It
is just this: the task of holding Stan
ford. The job of rushing in and
blocking the Redskins' aerial thrusts
falls to the first three named; to
Herwig and Meek goes the respon
sibility for watching the Redshirted
receivers.
Vic Bottari is pointed out as the
logical key man in the Bear back
field. He it was who paved the wry
( to California victories in the last
two games. In the eyes of Allison,
j Bottari is the greatest passer he has
ever coached. True enough, Vic has
thrown hut five passes in gaining
those two victories, but it is plenty
significant that all of those throws
have clicked.
Flashy Runner
Also Vic has shown the ability to
run punts back in tine style. He is
as deceptive a broken-field runner
as there is in the Conference, and hr>
j retains all the assurance, poise, and
I clear-headedness needed.
As is his wont, Allison has been
doing a bit of fearing lately. Right
off the bat he fears the dynamic
I Jimmy Coffis. But, after thinking
the situation over a bit, he has con
cluded that Bottari and Mushy Pol
lock should bring Cal as much yard
age from returned punts as Coffis
will for the Indians.
Pollock May Start
Last nighl, Stub announced defi
nitely thai. Pollock will start at left
half if the Golden Bears receive the
kickoff. But if such is not the case,
Bill Archer will hold down the full
back post. Pollock has been called
the most potentially dangerous of
the Bears' backs, and he's proved
he's hard to stop once he breaks into
the clear.
Stanford seems destined to remain
the underdog in tomorrow's encoun
ter. Latest odds were quoted as 10-8
for Cal, but the Redshirts have not
been bothered by that fact at all.
Tiny has armed his charges with the
utmost confidence, and yet not a
shadow of overconfidence, particu
larly wherein their new plays are
concerned.
Promise Best Game
Although the Allison men claim
they are not openly confident of vic
tory, they have revealed this fact:
they intend to play their best ball
game of the year tomorrow.
Now billed to start at full for in
jured Ken Cotton is Dave Anderson,
who will bear all the watching that
the Indian defense can give him. The
Cal ends, Henry Sparks. Will Dol
man, and Perry Schwartz, are all
rated somewhat below the standard
maintained this season by Indians
Jack Clark and Grant Stone. And,
much to Allison's distaste, this holds
true both on defense and attack.
Chapman Looks Best
Sam Chapman, whom Stub has
been trying to drill some dependable
punting accuracy into, can still out
kick the improved Jake Brigham and
Tony Calvelli. Not one member of
the trio, however, is doped to look
overly ashy; thus, punting cannot
be considered much of an advan
tage to either squad.
Dave DeVarona, Cotton, and
George Cornell, all of whom have
been injured during the past few
weeks, were regarded last night as
virtually out of the Big Game. All
three have come out on the practice
turf and doggedly attempted to keep
up the pace but each has been forced
to retire.
Encouraged by their zest to give
their best performance of the season
tomorrow, Allison took his hand
picked Golden Bears into the fast
nesses of an Oakland hotel last night.
There they stayed until time for
classes this morning.

: mendous proportions.
If for no other reason than the fact
that tomorrow's victor is expected to
be decided more or less by aerial
! attack prowess, California is depend
ing upon five gentlemen to do the
honors. Spotlighted on the battle
turf will be Vard Stockton, Gene
McAteer, Claude Evans, Bob Her
wig, and Johnny Meek.
Five to Hold Indians
Present indications bring a mag
nitudinous task to the flashy five. It
is just this: the task of holding Stan
ford. The job of rushing in and
blocking the Redskins' aerial thrusts
falls to the first three named; to
Herwig and Meek goes the respon
sibility for watching the Redshirted
receivers.
Vic Bottari is pointed out as the
logical key man in the Bear back
field. He it was who paved the wry
( to California victories in the last
two games. In the eyes of Allison,
j Bottari is the greatest passer he has
ever coached. True enough, Vic has
thrown hut five passes in gaining
those two victories, but it is plenty
significant that all of those throws
have clicked.
Flashy Runner
Also Vic has shown the ability to
run punts back in tine style. He is
as deceptive a broken-field runner
as there is in the Conference, and hr>
j retains all the assurance, poise, and
I clear-headedness needed.
As is his wont, Allison has been
doing a bit of fearing lately. Right
off the bat he fears the dynamic
I Jimmy Coffis. But, after thinking
the situation over a bit, he has con
cluded that Bottari and Mushy Pol
lock should bring Cal as much yard
age from returned punts as Coffis
will for the Indians.
Pollock May Start
Last nighl, Stub announced defi
nitely thai. Pollock will start at left
half if the Golden Bears receive the
kickoff. But if such is not the case,
Bill Archer will hold down the full
back post. Pollock has been called
the most potentially dangerous of
the Bears' backs, and he's proved
he's hard to stop once he breaks into
the clear.
Stanford seems destined to remain
the underdog in tomorrow's encoun
ter. Latest odds were quoted as 10-8
for Cal, but the Redshirts have not
been bothered by that fact at all.
Tiny has armed his charges with the
utmost confidence, and yet not a
shadow of overconfidence, particu
larly wherein their new plays are
concerned.
Promise Best Game
Although the Allison men claim
they are not openly confident of vic
tory, they have revealed this fact:
they intend to play their best ball
game of the year tomorrow.
Now billed to start at full for in
jured Ken Cotton is Dave Anderson,
who will bear all the watching that
the Indian defense can give him. The
Cal ends, Henry Sparks. Will Dol
man, and Perry Schwartz, are all
rated somewhat below the standard
maintained this season by Indians
Jack Clark and Grant Stone. And,
much to Allison's distaste, this holds
true both on defense and attack.
Chapman Looks Best
Sam Chapman, whom Stub has
been trying to drill some dependable
punting accuracy into, can still out
kick the improved Jake Brigham and
Tony Calvelli. Not one member of
the trio, however, is doped to look
overly ashy; thus, punting cannot
be considered much of an advan
tage to either squad.
Dave DeVarona, Cotton, and
George Cornell, all of whom have
been injured during the past few
weeks, were regarded last night as
virtually out of the Big Game. All
three have come out on the practice
turf and doggedly attempted to keep
up the pace but each has been forced
to retire.
Encouraged by their zest to give
their best performance of the season
tomorrow, Allison took his hand
picked Golden Bears into the fast
nesses of an Oakland hotel last night.
There they stayed until time for
classes this morning.
Big Game!
Into the air it lias already put spirit and fire aplenty. And, appro
priately enough, into the air will go much of the traditional clash.
With their respective warriors awaiting the opening whistle of the
Big Game. Tiny Thornhill and Stub Allison handy no words in announcing
that there will he passing and more passing, a goodly supply of laterals,

deception—a wide-open dis
play of some indeed spectacular foot
ball. Victory for the Golden Bears
would mean their first legal posses

Herwig and Meek goes the respon
sibility for watching the Redshirted
receivers.
Vic Bottari is pointed out as the
logical key man in the Bear back
field. He it was who paved the wry
( to California victories in the last
two games. In the eyes of Allison,
j Bottari is the greatest passer he has
ever coached. True enough, Vic has
thrown hut five passes in gaining
those two victories, but it is plenty
significant that all of those throws
have clicked.
Flashy Runner
Also Vic has shown the ability to
run punts back in tine style. He is
as deceptive a broken-field runner
as there is in the Conference, and hr>
j retains all the assurance, poise, and
I clear-headedness needed.
As is his wont, Allison has been
doing a bit of fearing lately. Right
off the bat he fears the dynamic
I Jimmy Coffis. But, after thinking
the situation over a bit, he has con
cluded that Bottari and Mushy Pol
lock should bring Cal as much yard
age from returned punts as Coffis
will for the Indians.
Pollock May Start
Last nighl, Stub announced defi
nitely thai. Pollock will start at left
half if the Golden Bears receive the
kickoff. But if such is not the case,
Bill Archer will hold down the full
back post. Pollock has been called
the most potentially dangerous of
the Bears' backs, and he's proved
he's hard to stop once he breaks into
the clear.
Stanford seems destined to remain
the underdog in tomorrow's encoun
ter. Latest odds were quoted as 10-8
for Cal, but the Redshirts have not
been bothered by that fact at all.
Tiny has armed his charges with the
utmost confidence, and yet not a
shadow of overconfidence, particu
larly wherein their new plays are
concerned.
Promise Best Game
Although the Allison men claim
they are not openly confident of vic
tory, they have revealed this fact:
they intend to play their best ball
game of the year tomorrow.
Now billed to start at full for in
jured Ken Cotton is Dave Anderson,
who will bear all the watching that
the Indian defense can give him. The
Cal ends, Henry Sparks. Will Dol
man, and Perry Schwartz, are all
rated somewhat below the standard
maintained this season by Indians
Jack Clark and Grant Stone. And,
much to Allison's distaste, this holds
true both on defense and attack.
Chapman Looks Best
Sam Chapman, whom Stub has
been trying to drill some dependable
punting accuracy into, can still out
kick the improved Jake Brigham and
Tony Calvelli. Not one member of
the trio, however, is doped to look
overly ashy; thus, punting cannot
be considered much of an advan
tage to either squad.
Dave DeVarona, Cotton, and
George Cornell, all of whom have
been injured during the past few
weeks, were regarded last night as
virtually out of the Big Game. All
three have come out on the practice
turf and doggedly attempted to keep
up the pace but each has been forced
to retire.
Encouraged by their zest to give
their best performance of the season
tomorrow, Allison took his hand
picked Golden Bears into the fast
nesses of an Oakland hotel last night.
There they stayed until time for
classes this morning.
Big Game!
Into the air it lias already put spirit and fire aplenty. And, appro
priately enough, into the air will go much of the traditional clash.
With their respective warriors awaiting the opening whistle of the
Big Game. Tiny Thornhill and Stub Allison handy no words in announcing
that there will he passing and more passing, a goodly supply of laterals,

deception—a wide-open dis
play of some indeed spectacular foot
ball. Victory for the Golden Bears
would mean their first legal posses
sion of the time-honored Stanford
j Axe, and moral satisfaction of tre
: mendous proportions.
If for no other reason than the fact
that tomorrow's victor is expected to
be decided more or less by aerial
! attack prowess, California is depend
ing upon five gentlemen to do the
honors. Spotlighted on the battle
turf will be Vard Stockton, Gene
McAteer, Claude Evans, Bob Her
wig, and Johnny Meek.
Five to Hold Indians
Present indications bring a mag
nitudinous task to the flashy five. It
is just this: the task of holding Stan
ford. The job of rushing in and
blocking the Redskins' aerial thrusts
falls to the first three named; to
Herwig and Meek goes the respon
sibility for watching the Redshirted
receivers.
