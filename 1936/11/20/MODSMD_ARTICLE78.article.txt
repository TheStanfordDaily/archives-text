# We'll Knock 'Em Cold, Says Drum Major Okker
## Band To Spell 'Bears,' 'Cards' During Half 
### 
When the Stanford B;tnd conies on
the Held tomorrow, keep your eyes
open, for you are going to see a big
ger and better band doing something
decidedly new and different.
Before the game, Hie combined In
dian and Bear bands will fill the
field both musically and numerically
us they play the National Anthem.
Bill Okker, six six and a half Stan
ford med student, will wear his fa
mous 24-inch hat, as usual, and will
lead the band through a series of
many new and intricate maneuvers.
Okker drum-majored his' first Big
Game in 1925, and has missed only
one Cal game since—in 1931, when
Stanford lost, G-0.
Marching out on the field at a
pace similar to that used by the
Southern Methodist Mustang band,
but playing legitimately, the hand
will immediately form a marching
block "C." As it forms the "C" the
band will continue marching down
the field in that formation. At (he
other end of the gridiron, the baixjj
will go into a countermarch, and, as
it comes out facing the other way,
will be in the shape of a block "S."
Marching down the field in this for
mation, the band will, at the other
end, get back into their regular
marching positions.
Here the band will Hank to the
Cal side of the stadium, and begin
marching. As soon as marching for
marches by, the band will form let
ters, "dropping off' men until the
word "BEARS'' is spelled out in
front of the rooting section. The
front of the band will then halt,
while the men in the rear keep
marching. As son as marching for
mation is reached, the band will
flank over to the Stanford side,
where it will repeat the process, this
time forming the word "CARDS."
Okker, his red hair nearly setting
his top hat on fire, promises that
"We'll knock 'em cold!"
