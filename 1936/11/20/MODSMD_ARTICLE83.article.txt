# Basketball Squad Opens Season Monday
## Title Seeking Cards Meet Davis Aggies in First Practice Game of Year All-coasters, Calderwood, Luisetti, Moore Pace Prospective Champions 
### WALT PETERSON 
Opening the practice season com
petition with the Cal Aggies from
Davis here Monday night, Coach
John Bunn's varsity basketball team
will start the year with the brightest
prospects for a championship Stan
ford has had in Bunn's eight years
on the Farm.
The outfit this year is fortified
with , all the first stringers who
brought home the conference prize
last season, among them three All-
Coasters. Hank Luisetti, than whom
there is no better on the Coast, and
Jack Calderwood, rangy guard, are
two of them. Captain Dinty Moore
was named in his sophomore year as
an All-Coast guard, but he was out
for more than half of last season
with injuries and illness. This year
lie is back in the best shape ever,
according to Bunn, who is looking
forward to seeing him play his great
est ball this season.
Moore Recovers
During the summer Moore broke
his arm, although he did not know
it at the time, and it was discovered
a couple of weeks ago when it be
gan paining him again. However, it
is doctored up now and won't slow
him down at all, according to Bunn.
Howell Turner, fifth highest scorer
in the Conference last season, and
Art Stoefen, six foot, four inch cen
ter who was fourth in the scoring,
complete the first team.
Many Subs Back
All but two of the substitutes on
the team will be back, Kenny Bell
and Ken Nobs luiving graduated.
This leaves H. B. Lee, Bob Zonne,
Sparky Robertson, and several oth
ers who were bulwarks all during
the season. Lee has been going like
a house rfire in Moore's place lately
while Dinty has been resting the sore
arm.
Phil Zonne, frosh captain who has
moved up, will be one of the best,
according to Bunn. He fits right in
with the first string already.
Calkins, Lyons Fast
Among the sophomore players in
addition to Zonne who have been
pleasing Bunn for the past few
weeks in preliminary practice are
Jack Kessell, sandy-haired forward
with bundles of speed, Lyman Cal
kins, guard converted from a for
ward, who is rugged and fast, and
Dick Lyon, a frosh from '34 who took
time out from last season to tour the
world.
