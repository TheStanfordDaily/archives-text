## 
### 
First call for frosh baseball candi
dates has been issued by Harry Ship
key, who, along with Bobby Gray
son and Jim Lawson, will instruct
the pea-greens in the art of hitting
and fielding the apple.
To date only eleven men have sig
i nified their intention to play baseball
for the class of '40. They are Donald
McCormack, second base; Richard
Peers, outfield; Bill Willard, first
base; Dick DeLauer, catcher; Sid
Lewis, first base; Gene Coldiron,
catcher; Hugh Gallerneau, pitcher;
Norman Juney, outfieid; Lew
Staehle, pitcher; Howard Hicking
botham, outfield; and Jack Grover,
pitcher.
All other men interested in play
ing frosh ball are asked by Coach
Shipkey to sign up with him at the
BA.C. Practice will start after the
Thanksgiving holidays.
last/ year, and By Forderhase, a
transfer, have been working with the
above three as a unit against the
regulars and have been making it
plenty tough for them every session.
Cal To IJe Strong
Other conference teams will also
be strong this year, according to
Bunn's prediction earlier in the sea
son. California, having lost only
Captain Ray Olson from their first
string, still possesses rugged Bob
Herwig, Ritchie Hay, and several
other veterans who were good
enough to split the annual series
with the Indians last year. In Bunn's
eyes, the Bears will be one of the
very toughest of the season hurdles.
U.C.L.A.'s John Ball is still in cir
culation, and with an attack built
around him the Bruins will have a
potent attack. Don Ashen, whom
everybody regarded as a cinch for
All-Coast guard last year until the
books became too muMi for him in
mid-season, will be gone from the
lineup.
Hupp Gone
U.S.C. has lost Jack Hupp, who
for two years was top scorer in the
Conference and was second to Lui
setti last year; but they have flashy
Eddie Oram back at guard for their
captain.
Oram was named All-Coast with
Calderwood last year. In addition
there will be a host of players up
from what Sam Barry termed one
of the greatest frosh teams ever
gathered at Troy.

Hupp Gone
U.S.C. has lost Jack Hupp, who
for two years was top scorer in the
Conference and was second to Lui
setti last year; but they have flashy
Eddie Oram back at guard for their
captain.
Oram was named All-Coast with
Calderwood last year. In addition
there will be a host of players up
from what Sam Barry termed one
of the greatest frosh teams ever
gathered at Troy.
First call for frosh baseball candi
dates has been issued by Harry Ship
key, who, along with Bobby Gray
son and Jim Lawson, will instruct
the pea-greens in the art of hitting
and fielding the apple.
To date only eleven men have sig
i nified their intention to play baseball
for the class of '40. They are Donald
McCormack, second base; Richard
Peers, outfield; Bill Willard, first
base; Dick DeLauer, catcher; Sid
Lewis, first base; Gene Coldiron,
catcher; Hugh Gallerneau, pitcher;
Norman Juney, outfieid; Lew
Staehle, pitcher; Howard Hicking
botham, outfield; and Jack Grover,
pitcher.
All other men interested in play
ing frosh ball are asked by Coach
Shipkey to sign up with him at the
BA.C. Practice will start after the
Thanksgiving holidays.
last/ year, and By Forderhase, a
transfer, have been working with the
above three as a unit against the
regulars and have been making it
plenty tough for them every session.
Cal To IJe Strong
Other conference teams will also
be strong this year, according to
Bunn's prediction earlier in the sea
son. California, having lost only
Captain Ray Olson from their first
string, still possesses rugged Bob
Herwig, Ritchie Hay, and several
other veterans who were good
enough to split the annual series
with the Indians last year. In Bunn's
eyes, the Bears will be one of the
very toughest of the season hurdles.
U.C.L.A.'s John Ball is still in cir
culation, and with an attack built
around him the Bruins will have a
potent attack. Don Ashen, whom
everybody regarded as a cinch for
All-Coast guard last year until the
books became too muMi for him in
mid-season, will be gone from the
lineup.
