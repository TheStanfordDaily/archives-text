# The
						Axe--Heirloom and Symbol-- At Stake in Tomorrow's Game
## 
### 
Once upon a time, yars and yars
ago, some enterprising Injun grid
fan forged a woodsman's axe with a
16-inch blade, to be used as a symbol
of Stanford supremacy in athletics.
The Axe has been around a long
time, has changed hands twice, and,
if it changes hands again tomorrow,
as the down-with Stanford section
of the 82,000 crowd in Berkeley Sta
dium hope it will, it will be the first
peaceful and above-the-belt transfer
in its long and colorful history.
Stanford had the Axe until day

after the Big Game in 1899, which
Stanford lost 9-7, when a group of
Berkeley raiders attacked the con
voy in charge of bringing the Axe
back to the Farm. It was taken to
Berkeley where it stayed for thirty
years, numerous attempts by Stan
ford to regain it failing, and was kept
irl Cal's vault, being brought out
only for their yearly Axe rally.
The Axe Regained
And that's just about all Cal had—
the Axe. Big Games, Big Meets—
everything went to the Sons of the
Heel. April 15, 1930, was the day,
I however, when plans were laid to
j bring back the Axe, by a band of
- Sequoia men, who earned their
lame: "The Immortal Twenty-
One."
Disguised as cameramen and Cal
frosh, the Twenty-One gathered
about the entrance of the bank
where the Axe was to be returned
after the rally. As the Cal guardian
stepped from the armored car to the
•idewalk, an overdose of flashlight
powder was fired, a homemade tear
bomb thrown, and four Stanford
man-mountains jumped for the Axe

i bearer.
The latter didn't have the Axe
very long, and it was deftly passed
through waiting hands to a car, and
within 50 minutes four of the raiders
were tearing up Palm Drive.
Campus Goes Wild
When the news was learned,
studies were forgotten and going
nuts was the order of the day. The
Bears organized many rescue parties
which came practically every night.
Stanfordites printed extras, gave
speeches, rallies, banquets, and tore
up the town. Axe stickers were
printed, the famous Axe yell was re
learned, and the Immortal Twenty-
One were given gold Axe charms
and Block "S" awards. *.
The Axe has resided peacefully at
I the Farm ever since in a glass case,
i bolted to the Cellar wall, where the
| public can view it, but not take ii.
i Tomorrow, the Axe will be taken
j to Berkeley by a committee headed
jby Chick Franich. At halftime it
<will be exhibited before both rooting
sections. SHOULD Cal win, the Axe
will be presented to them with ap
propriate ceremonies after the game.
