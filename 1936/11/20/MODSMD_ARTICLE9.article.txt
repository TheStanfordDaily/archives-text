# Post Office Suffers Reducation in Rank
## 
### 
Since September 1, the Stanford
post office has been a branch instead
of a station as it was formerly. Out
going mail is now sent in to the Palo
Alto station and sorted there. In
coming mail is sent out to the Stan
ford branch already sorted.
This change makes scarcely any
change in speed of service. The chief
cause of delay, as in any post office,
is the incorrect addressing of i> 1 -
coming mail.
