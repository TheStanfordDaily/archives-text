# Huskies Can Cinch Rose Bowl Invitation by Win Over Cougars Next Week
## Washington Conference Record Marred Only By Tie with Stanford 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference's choice
for the New Year's Day Rose Bowl
classic candidate hinged completely
on the Washington-Southern Cal
game played in Seattle a week ago,
according to all the dopesters.
Washington drubbed the Trojans
12-0, bottling up both Rambling
Amby Schindler and Davy Davis,
rapid-action quarterbacks on How
ard Jones' outfit, and are now resting
easily as an undefeated-in-Confer
ence team just waiting for the call.
Must Beat Cougars
However, the Huskies still have to
beat Washington State and Epheme
ral Ed Goddard when they meet in
Seattle a week from Saturday, if
they want to keep their good name
out of reach of the Cougars. Oregon
State hung a bun on the Cougars'
eye two weeks ago in a mildly sur
prising win. 16-6, but outside of that
debacle and a 0-0 tie with Troy,
Babe Hollingbery's outfit has a fair
record. They cooled U.C.L.A. 32-7 in
Los Angeles last week to give a new
case of shivers to Jimmy Phelan and
the Washington Huskies.
The only blotch on the Washing
ton Conference record is a 14-14 tie
with a rejuvenated Stanford team
that went pass crazy and kick crazy
to put over an equal number of
points in .spite of the failure to match
the Huskies' yardage. Jake Brigham
and Tony Calvelli made Elmer Logg,
Washington's great punter, look
rather sick in the kicking duel two
weeks ago, averaging something like
three yards better per boot. On top
of that, Jim Coffis tacked a sweet
record of runbacks from safety to
Logg's punting, cutting down on his
yardage even more.
Seems Cinch for Bid
As it stands, then, Washington is
a virtual cinch, granting the win
over W.S.C., to get the Bowl bid. If
Goddard can turn the trick against
them it will just throw the whole
business into a mess. Minnesota took
the season opener from Washington
14-7 for the only loss handed them
this year, but the Huskies have been
holding their own in spite of the
fact that they have been plagued by
injuries. Cain was out for the U.S.C.
game, Haines has been struggling
along on a bum shoulder for weeks,
and Ed Nowogroski is just getting
into shape after an early season hurt.
All these men are key players in
Phelan's offense, and he has had to
rearrange frequently to keep going.
Broncs Out
Santa Clara, undefated and untied
and fresh from their first-ever tri
umph over the Gaels, no doubt wants
consideration for the Rose Bowl, but
I hey aren't in the Conference and
hcnce don't figure.
Although San Francisco papers re
port reams of correspondence advo
cating such a choice, few of the
sports writers feel that the Broncs
have played as tough a schedule as
have the Conference eligibles. U.S.F.
was the only team to score on the
Broncos, leaving them with what is
practically a clean slate.
