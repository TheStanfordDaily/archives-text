## Loss of Stars Offset By New Material 
### 
According to Coach. Eddie Twiggs,
golf mentor, this year's edition of
the varsity golf squad is certain to
maintain the high position in inter
collegiate circles Card golfers have
held for many years.
Although a large number of last
year's stars, including Don Ed
wards, Morse Er.sk ine, and Spec-
Stewart, have graduated, returning
veterans plus a number of promising
transfers and frosh form a basis for
another strong squad.
Leading the list of prospects on
the basis of his ladder play this year
is Jack Wallace, who has been in the
number one spot almost continually
since the beginning of practice this
fall, and who is now leading the rest
of the field by a comfortable margin.
Second on the ladder is Art Doer
ing, a transfer, who last week turned
in the best round for a Farm golfer
this year. Next to him are Harry
Wiet, another consistently good
golfer, Brown Cannon, and Alan Hy
man, all of whom are capable of
jreat golf when in top form.
Others who will be in the thick of
the battle when competition for
places on the team begins next
spring are Bill Oncal, John Crable,
and Lewis Cass, who have not en
tered ladder play this fall, and Jeeb
Halaby, George Cannon, Kim Ban
nister, Cal Manning, and Pete Hass.
