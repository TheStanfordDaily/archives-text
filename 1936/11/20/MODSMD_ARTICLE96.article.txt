# Football Season Nears Trail's End Tomorrow
## Old Man Dope Upsetter Stalks Various Grid Turfs Over Week-end 
### 
It's been a screwy season, to say
the least. The Spring Street Wisen
heimers, the "smart money" boys,
and ail the rest of the guys whose
slogan is, "Don't tell us—we know,"
took a terrific beating every week.
For that matter, so did the teams.
At the beginning of the year, the
set-up seemed to be fairly clear. Cal
and Washington were the best teams
on the Coast—especially Cal. U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. were very good—right
next to the top. Washington State
came next on the list. Oregon and
Oregon State were okay. Stanford
. . . lib . . . well . . . Stanford . . .
oyeah! that's a school located near
Palo Alto.
As the seasqji moved on, nothing
went as it should. Upsets came when
least expected; everybody beat ev
erybody who, in turn, also beat
everybody.
Games this week-end won't raise
much dust on the Conference stand
ings, but, nevertheless, some real
games arc ready to be dished up,
hot and steaming, to thousands of
grid fans on the Coast.
Oregon will be witness to battle
of neighbors when the Beavers and
the Webfeet tangle at Corvallis.
