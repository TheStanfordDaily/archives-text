# First Big Game in 1892 Nobody Brought a Football
## 
### DAVE SWANBERG 
Stanford and California first
started their football rivalry on
March 19, 1892. Fifteen thousand
people jammed the bleachers of an
old San Francisco field and let out a
mighty roar when the two teams
dashed out on the gridiron. The
referee conferred with the rival cap
tains and promptly at game time
asked for the ball to be teed up for
the kick-off.
But no ball was forthcoming. Each
side had expected the other team
provide the pigskin. So players and
spectators had to wait an hour while
someone rode downtown on a cable
car and bought a football.
Stanford Win. 14-10
Stanford started the winning
habit that day, triumphing 14-10*.
and nobody present had to be told
twice that the Big Game was to be
the blue ribbon event of the coast.
Until 1904 the Big Games were
always played in San Francisco. In
tiiat year California dedicated their
new 40.000 field and from then on
the Big Game took nlace on either
the Stanford or California campus.
In 1906 the late President Benja-

min Ide Wheeler of California de
cided that the old American-type
game was too bonecrushing. The
forward pass had not yet come into
being. Forty-five-minute halves, the
flying wedge, and no rule requiring
seven men on the line of scrimmage
were some of the elements making
the game suitable mostly for players
of the "dumb Swede" lumberjack
type. The next best thing was rugby,
and from 1906 to 1914 the Cards and
Bears played their annual game in
thai sport.
Disagreement over the freshman
rule caused a break between Cal and
Stanford in 1915.
War and Reunion
It took a World War 1 to bring
Stanford and California together
again. That was in 1918 when all
able-bodied students were in S.A.
T.C. camps subject to military orders.
For three years student and faculty
committees had tried in vain to re
new relations.
Play it they did. Although Cali
fornia won 67-0, this game is not in
cluded in the official records, but it
at least served lo break the ice.
