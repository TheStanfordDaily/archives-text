HAIL!
STANFORD ROUGH
WEAR A FLAMINC RED
PARK-JACK
TO THE BIG CAME!!
First made for skiing, it is
the toughest all - around
campus jacket we have
seen. Come early so that
you can have yours for the
game. Quantity limited.
P.S. Since we left the Farm,
we hear that The 500 are
now over 1 000! For them as
well as you, we have a full
line of ski - gear, and the
smartest of ski-togs.
