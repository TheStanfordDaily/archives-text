# Moguls' Lodge Chi Psi Nestery
## 
### 
'J'HE Chi Psi lodge is that big
cream-colored house with green
shutters on the corner of Salvatierra
and Arguello. The reasons that the
Chi Psi's call their place a lodge in
stead of a house is part of fraternity
history. The custom started in the
chapter at the University of Michi
gan where the Chi Psi's actually
lived in an old hunting lodge in the
woods because the administration
wouldn't allow fraternity houses on
the campus. '
The Chi Phi's have had a chapter
at Stanford since 1895 . Thirty mem
bers are now living in the house.
House bills are from $54 to $55 a
month ;the initiation fee is $70.
In campus activities the Chi Psi's
have the following men: junior man
ager of the football team; two junior
managers of the golf team; senior
man on Ex Committee; one in de
bating; assistant coach of boxing;
two on boxing team; one on varsity
polo team; one in track; one on The
Daily; two in soccer; one on the var
sity tennis team; one on the Chap
arral.
Robert P. Terrill, professor in the
econ department, is a Chi Psi. So

and Johnny Fisher, and Eric Pedley,
famous poloist.
