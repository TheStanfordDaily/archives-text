# CAN YOU READ THE NEWS
## 
### DR. HAROLD C. HAND 
ET ME begin by recalling to your
mind the fact that the dean of
one of our leading schools of jour
nalism recently charged that "in all
civilized countries at present news
papers exist for the purpose of con
cealing the truth," that "news and
photographs are sometimes falsified,"
that "newspapers . . . follow the
leadership of organized minorities,"
that "the press utilizes its freedom as
a license to exploit policies which
make for circulation instead of serv
ice," and that "the basic fault with
the press is its ownership; that the
press cannot be an impartial and true
advocate of public service as long as
its owners are engaged or involved
in other businesses."
Must Know Score
Am I in error when I submit that
the full significance of these facts, if
such they be, must be grasped by an
individual before it can truthfully be
said that he is able realistically to
read a newspaper Do you share my
suspicion that in this sense most
Stanford students do not know how
to read newspapers?
Now I must labor the obvious for a
moment in order to lay the remain
der of the groundwork for my pro
posal. Most of us are forced to de
pend to a considerable degree upon
the newspapers for our information
concerning the issues of the day.
It is almost a certainty, according
ly, that we are being mis-educated in
many respccts. But, we are told, the
hopes of democracy, "a way of life
in which men proceed by unending
inquiry and debate," are staked upon
the condition that public opinion
shall be enlightened—that issues af
fecting the public welfare shall be
settled at the ballot box by voters
who are in possession of the facts.
Mothers of Leaders
Stanford is proud, and justly so, of
the civic leaders which she has given
to the state and to the nation. Is it
not possible, however, that Stanford,
Mother of Civic Leaders, may be
come pi-ogressively childless in this
regard unless steps are taken effec
tively to remedy the situation with
reference to "newspaper illiteracy"
on our campus? It is not. only pos
sible but indeed highly probable that
this may come to pass if the proper
precautionary steps are not soon tak
en. All of which leads me to the
point of my proposal.
I propose in all seriousness that
you exercise your persuasive powers
upon the yarious professors in the
School of Social Sciences, and espe
cially those in the Departments of
Journalism and Political Science, to
offer on an experimental basis a
course open to all students in the
university dealing with newspapers
and their treatment of contemporary
issues and affairs, local, national, and
international.
Such a course might perhaps be
called "Newspapers and Today's
News." All of the newspapers (Re
publican, Democrat, Socialist, Com
munist, "Neutral," and what not)
currently read by California citizens
would be required reading. The po
litical, economic, religious, and other
connections, affiliations, or allegianc
es of the owners of each paper would
be ferretted out.
The resulting bias of each newspa
per would be examined as it typically
reflects itself in the selection or col-

Last week following the flare-up over California's pro
posed raid, the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle had
a two-day bout of calling each other a liar on the question
of wehther or not one paper has misuoted President Wil
bur. or whether the airplanes that hovered over the Big
Game Bonfire belonged to California and Stanford.
In these instances, the two metropolitan dailies showed
a remarkable interest in the accuracy of reports on college
pranks. But durin the time they manifested this interest,
there were colored stories appearing in the nation's press,
stories that are never questioned, never challenged, yet
they are of far more importance than the antics of football
maddened college. In the followin article. Dr. Harold C.
Hand, associate professor of education, suggests something
be done that will make people challenge the important
facts, disregard the trivial.—The Editor.

oring of the news. Examples of
falsified photographs and dispatches
would be studied, not as isolated in
teresting phenomena, but in relation
to the conncetions, affiliations, or al
legiances and consequent biases of
the publishers in question.
In these and in similar ways our
students might learn how to read
newspapers as a newspaper should,
in my opinion, be read.

In common with most life-needs
translated-into-education, this edu
cational problem does not fall within
the province of any single depart
ment of the university. It does, how
ever, fall well within the scope of

the School ol' Social Scienccs—as I
see it, at least.
In making available the course in
Current Events, this school has al
ready demonstrated an admirable
willingness to transcend department
al lines to provide an offering to
meet the needs of Stanford students.
Attendance at the sessions of the
Current Events course far outnum
bers the registration, I am told. I be
lieve that an offering designed to
stamp out newspaper illiteracy would
be at least equally beneficial to and
appreciated by the student body.
