# Hoopsters Open Tonight vs. Aggies
## 
### 
Varsity basketballers take on the
first outside competition of the year
tonight when they meet the Califor
nia Aggies in the Pavilion, starting at
8 o'clock.
The team from Davis comes to the
Farm about as dark as a phonograph
record, with nobody knowing just
who plays or how good he is, any
way. This will be the first game
ever to be played between Stanford
and the Ags.
