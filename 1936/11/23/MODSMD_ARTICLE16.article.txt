Huge sparks, 25 feet in length,
thrilled Physical Science students
at the Ryan High Voltage Laboratory
yesterday afternoon.
Professor J. S. Carroll, in charge
of the Ryan Laboratory, conducted
a tour through the laboratory, which
included the main experimental
room, the power room, and the
transmission lines and towers. In
the final demonstration, as the vast
room was darkened, the spectators
saw small purple sparks increase to
huge white lightning-like flashes as
they jumped across the 25-foot space.
Cal didn't burn our bonfire, but
they sure as hell burnt us.
