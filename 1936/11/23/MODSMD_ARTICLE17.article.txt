# Did Somebody Say There Was A Big Game Saturday?
## Tiny Says Bears Played Rest Game Of Year To Whip Cards 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Complete, thorough, and definite
was the 20-0 win scored up by Cali
fornia Saturday in the forty-second
annual Big Game, the first win by the
Bears over Stanford since 1931, and
their first Big Game victory in their
own stadium since the grim dark
days of 1923.
Outshining Tiny Thornhill's men
nearly all afternoon, the Bears show
ed a strong ground attack, and com
bining nine intercepted passes, fine
punting, and sudden, deadly aerial
offenses, put the game away with one
touchdown each in the second, third,
and fourth quarters.
Tiny Thornhill afterward laugh
ingly said, "They certainly played
their best game of the season today,
while we didn't. Their great supply
of fresh material during the after
noon was what did it, while our pass
ing and play selection was not what
it might have been. It's been a sat
isfying season, though."
Cards Shine in Defeat
Some of the boys felt badly about
losing, Coffis and Callaway being es
pecially glum. Neither seemed to
realize that they had played their
best game by far this year. Ferko,
Hoos, and Stone just smiled and
shock their heads. Calvelli seemed to
think he had thrown the game; he
didn't remember that he had saved
far more touchdowns than went
through him.
Stanford's big chance came as the
fii'st break—Stone recovered Chap
man's fumble soon after the kick-off
on the Bear 21. Two runs and a pass
failed to make it, however, and Cal
velli's field goal attempt was short.
The rest of the first quarter was
played in midfield, with a sterling 26-
yard run by Coffis serving to offset
Chapman's advantage on the punting
exchanges.
Bottari Was There
In the second quarter Vic Bottari
came in to left half for the Bears,
and they began to move. Thirteen
plays, 75 yards, a score. The touch
down came on a 35-yard pass, Bot
tari to Sparks, with 10 minutes of the
period yet to go. Sparks and Coffis
jumped for the ball on the goal line,
the latter blocking it, but deflecting it
to Sparks' knee from whei'e he
caught it for the touchdown. Sparks'
pjace-kick was good.
The rest of the period saw Herwig
intercept Brigham's pass and Bot
tari lead California to the 14-vard
line, but no more points. Earl Hoos
intercepted Bottari's pass down
there, and returned to the 26. A
Brigham-Rasmussen pass made 37
yards to the Cal 36, but the half-time
gun ended the advance at that point.
The third quarter was largely
California, with Bottari and Archer
ripping nice gains through the mid
dle of the Stanford line, and pass in
terceptions by Meek, Archer, and
Stockton playing big parts. The Cali
fornia score came on a 26-yai'd pass,
Chapman to Schwartz, near the right
sideline on the Stanford 7-yard line,
after which Archer and Anderson
pushed it over in three tries. Sparks
again converted.
Other Threats
California reached the 8 and 0-
yard lines on other drives of this
period, but passes to the end zone by
Archer and Chapman were not good.

Stanford never crossed midfield in ,
the final period; eight passes of Cal- |
velli's, Hamilton's, and Brigham's j
were incomplete, while four were in- j
tercepted. California's last touch- I
down came after Chapman inter
cepted Calvelli's toss and ran back
to the 18. From here seven plays;,,
the last one a lateral from Bottari to
Chapman, turned the trick.
Meek intercepted another toss and
was run out of bounds on the Stan- j
ford 1-yard line as the last play of
the game. «
Total yards gained went to Cali- ;
fornia. 248 to 156, of which Califor- i
nia made 78 from 4 completed passes j
out of 19, while Stanford also took
78 from 4 completed out of 26. Cali
fornia intercepted 9 passes, Stanford'
1, made 10 first downs while Stanford
made 5. California outkicked Stan- i
ford but slightly, 39.5 to 37.7.

dle of the Stanford line, and pass in
terceptions by Meek, Archer, and
Stockton playing big parts. The Cali
fornia score came on a 26-yai'd pass,
Chapman to Schwartz, near the right
sideline on the Stanford 7-yard line,
after which Archer and Anderson
pushed it over in three tries. Sparks
again converted.
Other Threats
California reached the 8 and 0-
yard lines on other drives of this
period, but passes to the end zone by
Archer and Chapman were not good.

Stanford never crossed midfield in ,
the final period; eight passes of Cal- |
velli's, Hamilton's, and Brigham's j
were incomplete, while four were in- j
tercepted. California's last touch- I
down came after Chapman inter
cepted Calvelli's toss and ran back
to the 18. From here seven plays;,,
the last one a lateral from Bottari to
Chapman, turned the trick.
Meek intercepted another toss and
was run out of bounds on the Stan- j
ford 1-yard line as the last play of
the game. «
Total yards gained went to Cali- ;
fornia. 248 to 156, of which Califor- i
nia made 78 from 4 completed passes j
out of 19, while Stanford also took
78 from 4 completed out of 26. Cali
fornia intercepted 9 passes, Stanford'
1, made 10 first downs while Stanford
made 5. California outkicked Stan- i
ford but slightly, 39.5 to 37.7.

Complete, thorough, and definite
was the 20-0 win scored up by Cali
fornia Saturday in the forty-second
annual Big Game, the first win by the
Bears over Stanford since 1931, and
their first Big Game victory in their
own stadium since the grim dark
days of 1923.
Outshining Tiny Thornhill's men
nearly all afternoon, the Bears show
ed a strong ground attack, and com
bining nine intercepted passes, fine
punting, and sudden, deadly aerial
offenses, put the game away with one
touchdown each in the second, third,
and fourth quarters.
Tiny Thornhill afterward laugh
ingly said, "They certainly played
their best game of the season today,
while we didn't. Their great supply
of fresh material during the after
noon was what did it, while our pass
ing and play selection was not what
it might have been. It's been a sat
isfying season, though."
Cards Shine in Defeat
Some of the boys felt badly about
losing, Coffis and Callaway being es
pecially glum. Neither seemed to
realize that they had played their
best game by far this year. Ferko,
Hoos, and Stone just smiled and
shock their heads. Calvelli seemed to
think he had thrown the game; he
didn't remember that he had saved
far more touchdowns than went
through him.
Stanford's big chance came as the
fii'st break—Stone recovered Chap
man's fumble soon after the kick-off
on the Bear 21. Two runs and a pass
failed to make it, however, and Cal
velli's field goal attempt was short.
The rest of the first quarter was
played in midfield, with a sterling 26-
yard run by Coffis serving to offset
Chapman's advantage on the punting
exchanges.
Bottari Was There
In the second quarter Vic Bottari
came in to left half for the Bears,
and they began to move. Thirteen
plays, 75 yards, a score. The touch
down came on a 35-yard pass, Bot
tari to Sparks, with 10 minutes of the
period yet to go. Sparks and Coffis
jumped for the ball on the goal line,
the latter blocking it, but deflecting it
to Sparks' knee from whei'e he
caught it for the touchdown. Sparks'
pjace-kick was good.
The rest of the period saw Herwig
intercept Brigham's pass and Bot
tari lead California to the 14-vard
line, but no more points. Earl Hoos
intercepted Bottari's pass down
there, and returned to the 26. A
Brigham-Rasmussen pass made 37
yards to the Cal 36, but the half-time
gun ended the advance at that point.

Cards Shine in Defeat
Some of the boys felt badly about
losing, Coffis and Callaway being es
pecially glum. Neither seemed to
realize that they had played their
best game by far this year. Ferko,
Hoos, and Stone just smiled and
shock their heads. Calvelli seemed to
think he had thrown the game; he
didn't remember that he had saved
far more touchdowns than went
through him.
Stanford's big chance came as the
fii'st break—Stone recovered Chap
man's fumble soon after the kick-off
on the Bear 21. Two runs and a pass
failed to make it, however, and Cal
velli's field goal attempt was short.
The rest of the first quarter was
played in midfield, with a sterling 26-
yard run by Coffis serving to offset
Chapman's advantage on the punting
exchanges.
Bottari Was There
In the second quarter Vic Bottari
came in to left half for the Bears,
and they began to move. Thirteen
plays, 75 yards, a score. The touch
down came on a 35-yard pass, Bot
tari to Sparks, with 10 minutes of the
period yet to go. Sparks and Coffis
jumped for the ball on the goal line,
the latter blocking it, but deflecting it
to Sparks' knee from whei'e he
caught it for the touchdown. Sparks'
pjace-kick was good.
The rest of the period saw Herwig
intercept Brigham's pass and Bot
tari lead California to the 14-vard
line, but no more points. Earl Hoos
intercepted Bottari's pass down
there, and returned to the 26. A
Brigham-Rasmussen pass made 37
yards to the Cal 36, but the half-time
gun ended the advance at that point.
The third quarter was largely
California, with Bottari and Archer
ripping nice gains through the mid
dle of the Stanford line, and pass in
terceptions by Meek, Archer, and
Stockton playing big parts. The Cali
fornia score came on a 26-yai'd pass,
Chapman to Schwartz, near the right
sideline on the Stanford 7-yard line,
after which Archer and Anderson
pushed it over in three tries. Sparks
again converted.
Other Threats
California reached the 8 and 0-
yard lines on other drives of this
period, but passes to the end zone by
Archer and Chapman were not good.

Stanford never crossed midfield in ,
the final period; eight passes of Cal- |
velli's, Hamilton's, and Brigham's j
were incomplete, while four were in- j
tercepted. California's last touch- I
down came after Chapman inter
cepted Calvelli's toss and ran back
to the 18. From here seven plays;,,
the last one a lateral from Bottari to
Chapman, turned the trick.
Meek intercepted another toss and
was run out of bounds on the Stan- j
ford 1-yard line as the last play of
the game. «
Total yards gained went to Cali- ;
fornia. 248 to 156, of which Califor- i
nia made 78 from 4 completed passes j
out of 19, while Stanford also took
78 from 4 completed out of 26. Cali
fornia intercepted 9 passes, Stanford'
1, made 10 first downs while Stanford
made 5. California outkicked Stan- i
ford but slightly, 39.5 to 37.7.

terbacks: Hoos, Gamier. Halfbacks:

Complete, thorough, and definite
was the 20-0 win scored up by Cali
fornia Saturday in the forty-second
annual Big Game, the first win by the
Bears over Stanford since 1931, and
their first Big Game victory in their
own stadium since the grim dark
days of 1923.
Outshining Tiny Thornhill's men
nearly all afternoon, the Bears show
ed a strong ground attack, and com
bining nine intercepted passes, fine
punting, and sudden, deadly aerial
offenses, put the game away with one
touchdown each in the second, third,
and fourth quarters.
Tiny Thornhill afterward laugh
ingly said, "They certainly played
their best game of the season today,
while we didn't. Their great supply
of fresh material during the after
noon was what did it, while our pass
ing and play selection was not what
it might have been. It's been a sat
isfying season, though."
