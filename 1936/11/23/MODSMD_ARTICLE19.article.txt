# Indians Win For Bears-By Accident
## 
### 
The Indians lost in football to the
Bears because the Bears were good.
But the Indians lost in soccer to U.C.
because a Stanford player kicked the
ball through the Berkeleyites' goal.
Presaging the stunning defeat to
follow in the Memorial Stadium, the

Cards went down 2-1 in a prelim
game on the East Bay campus Sat
urdayâ€”victims of their own accurate
placement.
The single Stanford goal was made
by Karl Schaupp. Standouts for
credit were Wayne Richardson and
Captain Bobby Hall.
As a substitute for the Axe, we
suggest a carton of aspirin for the
Cellar show case.
