• •ITS nothing but a 'grief job,' this
taking care of the Public Ad
dress system. When it doesn't work
perfectly, people scream at us, and
when it works perfectly, we get no
congratulations."
The speaker: Bill Sumerlin, unoffi
cially one of the caretakers for Stan- j
ford's portable P.A. system, senior,
communications major, and an ex- |
pert on radio and electrical subjects, j
The occasion: Students' complain
ing and comments to the effect that
the Associated Oil equipment used at
the Ca! game was very superior to
the A.S.S.U. owned system.
"The basic trouble which has been
the cause for all the gripes lies in
the fact that the public address sys
tem has been in demand for more
types of situations than those for
which it was originally planned.
Those Speakers
"The proper type of public address
system to meet all the present de
mands of the student body should
have several types of loudspeakers.
As it is. the A.S.S.U. feels that it
cannot afford other types of speakers.
"Non-directional speakers are ex
cellent for general gatherings such as
those held in the assembly hall, at
dances, etc., but are not suitable for
rooting section use, or for use in the
pavilion at rallies. Also, non-direc
tional speakers are much cheaper
than directional type.
"The student body should author
ize purchase of two horn type speak
ers for use at football games for the
rooting section. In addition two
folded-horn type speakers should be
acquired for use in the pavilion.
"Similarly there are different types
of microphones for different pur
poses. The present microphone that
has been used is of the ribbon va
raicty, and is quite sensitive and not
designed for outdoor use. It picks up
equally well from either front or
back, and as long as the person
speaking into it is within 5 feet it
works well.
"This type of microphone is excel
lent for assembly talks, for dance or
chestras, and other general indoor
use. For use at rooting sections, a
not-so-sensitive variety of the type
that operates only when spoken into
directly should be purchased.
'Feedback' Trouble
"The problem of accoustics is also
a very vital one. When the public
address system .is set up, the loud
speakers must be placed so that no
sound coming from them can get
back into the mike.
"If this happens, feedback' starts,
which most of us recognize as the
howl that comes out of the speakers
when ihey are not operated correct
ly. This 'feedback' is exactly the
same thing that occurs when some
one places the earpiece of a telephone
close to the mouthpiece and a howl
sets in.
The problem of 'feedback' is easily
overcome with the public address
system provided that the audience
docs not demand excessive volume,
and provided that the microphone
can be placed behind the loudspeak
ers. However, if the system is being
used in a room that has too much
?cho, it is difficult to prevent some of
the sound from bouncing off the wall
ind back into the microphone.
Football Problem
"The problem at the football games
is rather difficult. The sound from the
loudspeakers should be concentrated
-.o that it goes only into the rooting
section. If we possessed horn type
speakers this could easily be accom
plished.
The speakers might be moved out
in the bandstand in front of the sec
ion so that they could be pointed at
he middle of the rooters and not at
just the first ten rows. The micro
phone would then similarly have to
be moved out on the band stand so
that it would not be in front of the
oudspeakers.
"Another problem to cope with
concerning the rooting section is
his: For the first two games a year
igo, when the crowd was not large
md noisy, and when the p a. system
vas turned up so that all the rooters
.vould hear, the press box behind the
mooting section complained that they

could not hear the main stadium J
speakers.
Immediately someone from the j
B.A.C. came down to the front of the j
rooting section and demanded that
our system either be turned way
down, or off altogether. The press i
box relies upon the main stadium!
speakers to learn who carried the j
ball and who made the tackles, and !
the B.A.C. is very interested in being \
sure of good publicity in newspaper
stories. Therefore the B.A.C. scored
against us.
"With our present loudspeakers'
and microphone, which amount to I
about one-third of the complete sys
tem, we are unable to over-ride the |
noisy and enthusiastic crowd with
out having difficulties with 'feed
back,' and when the crowd is not i
noisy we are unable to over-ride the
B.A.C. and their press box.
The only thing to do in the future, j
according to Sumerlin is to try to
reach a happy medium at which the '
Students hear sufficiently and the J
press box does not hear enough to j
gripe. The communications lab is at- I
tempting to do this by making an at
tachment which will make the tone
of our system entirely different from
surrounding noises and which will
make it possible to hear our system
through the din of the rooters and
crowd noises
"Our system," continued Bill, "has
never l>een a 'white elephant' as
Mr. Gros terms it. It is as power
ful as the permanently installer! sys
tem in the stadium provided ' -ed j
back' can be prevented It is more j
powerful than any other system ever j
brought to this campus by Associated |
Oil or anyone else The fidelity is [
more nearly perfect than that of any [
other set I have seen down here.
"if the A.S.S.U. sees fit to invest '
[ about $250 in different kinds of i
speakers and a microphone suitable j
for football games, I feel sure that ,
everyone will feel that we have a
svstem hard to beat "

ers for use at football games for the
rooting section. In addition two
folded-horn type speakers should be
acquired for use in the pavilion.
"Similarly there are different types
of microphones for different pur
poses. The present microphone that
has been used is of the ribbon va
raicty, and is quite sensitive and not
designed for outdoor use. It picks up
equally well from either front or
back, and as long as the person
speaking into it is within 5 feet it
works well.
"This type of microphone is excel
lent for assembly talks, for dance or
chestras, and other general indoor
use. For use at rooting sections, a
not-so-sensitive variety of the type
that operates only when spoken into
directly should be purchased.
'Feedback' Trouble
"The problem of accoustics is also
a very vital one. When the public
address system .is set up, the loud
speakers must be placed so that no
sound coming from them can get
back into the mike.
"If this happens, feedback' starts,
which most of us recognize as the
howl that comes out of the speakers
when ihey are not operated correct
ly. This 'feedback' is exactly the
same thing that occurs when some
one places the earpiece of a telephone
close to the mouthpiece and a howl
sets in.
The problem of 'feedback' is easily
overcome with the public address
system provided that the audience
docs not demand excessive volume,
and provided that the microphone
can be placed behind the loudspeak
ers. However, if the system is being
used in a room that has too much
?cho, it is difficult to prevent some of
the sound from bouncing off the wall
ind back into the microphone.
Football Problem
"The problem at the football games
is rather difficult. The sound from the
loudspeakers should be concentrated
-.o that it goes only into the rooting
section. If we possessed horn type
speakers this could easily be accom
plished.
The speakers might be moved out
in the bandstand in front of the sec
ion so that they could be pointed at
he middle of the rooters and not at
just the first ten rows. The micro
phone would then similarly have to
be moved out on the band stand so
that it would not be in front of the
oudspeakers.
"Another problem to cope with
concerning the rooting section is
his: For the first two games a year
igo, when the crowd was not large
md noisy, and when the p a. system
vas turned up so that all the rooters
.vould hear, the press box behind the
mooting section complained that they

could not hear the main stadium J
speakers.
Immediately someone from the j
B.A.C. came down to the front of the j
rooting section and demanded that
our system either be turned way
down, or off altogether. The press i
box relies upon the main stadium!
speakers to learn who carried the j
ball and who made the tackles, and !
the B.A.C. is very interested in being \
sure of good publicity in newspaper
stories. Therefore the B.A.C. scored
against us.
"With our present loudspeakers'
and microphone, which amount to I
about one-third of the complete sys
tem, we are unable to over-ride the |
noisy and enthusiastic crowd with
out having difficulties with 'feed
back,' and when the crowd is not i
noisy we are unable to over-ride the
B.A.C. and their press box.
The only thing to do in the future, j
according to Sumerlin is to try to
reach a happy medium at which the '
Students hear sufficiently and the J
press box does not hear enough to j
gripe. The communications lab is at- I
tempting to do this by making an at
tachment which will make the tone
of our system entirely different from
surrounding noises and which will
make it possible to hear our system
through the din of the rooters and
crowd noises
"Our system," continued Bill, "has

the sound from bouncing off the wall

Football Problem
"The problem at the football games
is rather difficult. The sound from the
loudspeakers should be concentrated
-.o that it goes only into the rooting
section. If we possessed horn type
speakers this could easily be accom
plished.
The speakers might be moved out
in the bandstand in front of the sec
ion so that they could be pointed at
he middle of the rooters and not at
just the first ten rows. The micro
phone would then similarly have to
be moved out on the band stand so
that it would not be in front of the
oudspeakers.
"Another problem to cope with
concerning the rooting section is
his: For the first two games a year
igo, when the crowd was not large
md noisy, and when the p a. system
vas turned up so that all the rooters
.vould hear, the press box behind the
mooting section complained that they

could not hear the main stadium J
speakers.
Immediately someone from the j
B.A.C. came down to the front of the j
rooting section and demanded that
our system either be turned way
down, or off altogether. The press i
box relies upon the main stadium!
speakers to learn who carried the j
ball and who made the tackles, and !
the B.A.C. is very interested in being \
sure of good publicity in newspaper
stories. Therefore the B.A.C. scored
against us.
"With our present loudspeakers'
and microphone, which amount to I
about one-third of the complete sys
tem, we are unable to over-ride the |
noisy and enthusiastic crowd with
out having difficulties with 'feed
back,' and when the crowd is not i
noisy we are unable to over-ride the
B.A.C. and their press box.
The only thing to do in the future, j
according to Sumerlin is to try to
reach a happy medium at which the '
Students hear sufficiently and the J
press box does not hear enough to j
gripe. The communications lab is at- I
tempting to do this by making an at
tachment which will make the tone
of our system entirely different from
surrounding noises and which will
make it possible to hear our system
through the din of the rooters and
crowd noises
"Our system," continued Bill, "has
never l>een a 'white elephant' as
Mr. Gros terms it. It is as power

The occasion: Students' complain
ing and comments to the effect that
the Associated Oil equipment used at
the Ca! game was very superior to
the A.S.S.U. owned system.
"The basic trouble which has been
the cause for all the gripes lies in
the fact that the public address sys
tem has been in demand for more
types of situations than those for
which it was originally planned.
Those Speakers
"The proper type of public address
system to meet all the present de
mands of the student body should
have several types of loudspeakers.
As it is. the A.S.S.U. feels that it
cannot afford other types of speakers.
"Non-directional speakers are ex
cellent for general gatherings such as
those held in the assembly hall, at
dances, etc., but are not suitable for
rooting section use, or for use in the
pavilion at rallies. Also, non-direc
tional speakers are much cheaper
than directional type.
"The student body should author
ize purchase of two horn type speak
ers for use at football games for the
rooting section. In addition two
folded-horn type speakers should be
acquired for use in the pavilion.
"Similarly there are different types
of microphones for different pur
poses. The present microphone that
has been used is of the ribbon va
raicty, and is quite sensitive and not
designed for outdoor use. It picks up
equally well from either front or
back, and as long as the person
speaking into it is within 5 feet it
works well.
"This type of microphone is excel
lent for assembly talks, for dance or
chestras, and other general indoor
use. For use at rooting sections, a
not-so-sensitive variety of the type
that operates only when spoken into
directly should be purchased.
'Feedback' Trouble
"The problem of accoustics is also
a very vital one. When the public
address system .is set up, the loud
speakers must be placed so that no
sound coming from them can get
back into the mike.
"If this happens, feedback' starts,
which most of us recognize as the
howl that comes out of the speakers
when ihey are not operated correct
ly. This 'feedback' is exactly the
same thing that occurs when some
one places the earpiece of a telephone
close to the mouthpiece and a howl

The problem of 'feedback' is easily

sure of good publicity in newspaper
stories. Therefore the B.A.C. scored
against us.
"With our present loudspeakers'
and microphone, which amount to I
about one-third of the complete sys
tem, we are unable to over-ride the |
noisy and enthusiastic crowd with
out having difficulties with 'feed
back,' and when the crowd is not i
noisy we are unable to over-ride the
B.A.C. and their press box.
The only thing to do in the future, j
according to Sumerlin is to try to
reach a happy medium at which the '
Students hear sufficiently and the J
press box does not hear enough to j
gripe. The communications lab is at- I
tempting to do this by making an at
tachment which will make the tone
of our system entirely different from
surrounding noises and which will
make it possible to hear our system
through the din of the rooters and
crowd noises
"Our system," continued Bill, "has
never l>een a 'white elephant' as
Mr. Gros terms it. It is as power
ful as the permanently installer! sys
tem in the stadium provided ' -ed j
back' can be prevented It is more j
powerful than any other system ever j
brought to this campus by Associated |
Oil or anyone else The fidelity is [
more nearly perfect than that of any [
other set I have seen down here.
"if the A.S.S.U. sees fit to invest '
[ about $250 in different kinds of i
speakers and a microphone suitable j
for football games, I feel sure that ,
everyone will feel that we have a
svstem hard to beat "
