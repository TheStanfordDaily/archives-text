A fighting Indian with a tough lit
tle Papoose following on behind will
be out a hunting tomorrow morning.
It has befen rumored that there is
a ferocious Bear with a scrappy little
Cub wandering around Berkeley,
and there is nothing better than
Bear meat that appeals to said In
dian and Papoose.
All this hunting will be centered
around the Cal pool when Stanford's
undeafeated frosh and varsity water
polo squads do battle with the tough
California septets.
This year's Big Game series of
water polo looms as the best ever
staged. Both Indian squads will en
ter their respective battles slightly
> on the heavy ends of the odds. But
favorites mean just about as much
in water polo as they do in football.
The frosh game is scheduled for
10 a.m., with the varsity fray imme
diately following.
Title at Stake
Two star studded outfits will face
each other in the varsity series
which will decide the Pacific Coast
Conference championship either in
tomorrow's game or Tuesday's battle
in Encina Pools.
Coach Nort Thornton of the Stan
ford Thorntons boasts of such men
;is Big Bill Hanna, the outstanding
1 sprint on the Coast; John Lamb, ace
I sharpshooter and cinch for all Coast
\ forward honors; and Captain Boh
\ Haslacher, the Coast's best goal
\ guard.
\ Added to this trio will be one of
Vhe best guard combinations in the
factory of Stanford, composed of Don
Vcterson, Ben Voss, and Chuck Gif-
IThornton will be depending on lit
'i Bob Hoover at forward to draw
lit Cal guards away and feed Hanna
«<™ Lamb, just as he has been doing
all teason.
Graham Is Cal Ace
F'try A1 Dowden of the California
P'ivvdens, pins most of his hopes on
Sharkey" Graham, ace guard from
Uncle Sam's Olympic Games team.
f ,! aham has been the inspiration
•"'d t;ackboi ie of the Bear squad all
season.
The Bears will have Captain
George Lawrence at sprint. Law
rencc will probably gain all Coast
forward honors, although Hanna is
favored to beat out the Bear flash on
the sprint.
Dowden will probably start Ken
Wheeler, sophomore scoring ace, and
Jim Shields, swim star, at the wing
forward spots. Graham's mates at
guard positions will be Walt "Slug
ger" Peterson, all-Conference back,
and Paul Collins. Jack Kent will be
in the Cal net at goalie.
Statistics Favor Cards
The Card water dogs have four
wins in the Conference and no de
feat against three wins and one loss
for the Bear amphibians in Confer
ence play this season.
Since 1912, Indian water polo
forces have routed the Bears sixty
nine times, with only three Blue and
Gold victories being recorded, two
of those Bear wins being scored last
