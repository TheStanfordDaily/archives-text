# Card Diamond Men Practice Without Help of Outfielders
## 
### 
Five good pitchers, three good
catchers, and five good infielders,
but no outfielders.
That is the situation Coach Harry
Wolter is facing as he rounds his
varsity nine into shape during fall
practice. Right-hand pitchers include
veteran Ray Weicrhauser and How
ard Paine; the latter has been show
ing Wolter plenty of stufT recently.
Portsiders arc lettermen Tom Kille
fcr and Verne Johnson, and Joie
Griffin. Santa Monica J.C. transfer.
"Lanky Leo" Heagerty and Dick
Hanna are handling the pitchers be
hind the plate. Hanna caught bat
ting practice for the American Olym
pic Games team and should develop
fast. The other catcher will be Bob
Matthews. After reading of "Little
Mat's" now famous run with an in
tercepted pass in Portland, Wolter
does not believe the former outfielder
will be fast enough for the latter
position.
The infield lines up with Captain
Darrell Holman on first, Leonard
Linde from San Mateo J.C. on sec
ond, George Farrell at the short
patch, and Dick Tam, who was an
ineligible transfer from Hawaii last
season, at third. Dale Reimer is a

very capable utility infielder for any
of the last three.
Johnson, while primarily a pitcher,
will be the team handy-man, also
pinch-hitting, playing the outfield
and relieving Holman on first. Un
less further prospects for the out
field develop, Weiershauser, Killefer,
Hanna, and Matthews will see serv
ice there when they are not working
as batterymen.
Coach Wolter has been very favor
ably impressed with the manner in
which the whole team is hitting this
season. Killefer, Farrell, and John
son have especially caught his eye.
