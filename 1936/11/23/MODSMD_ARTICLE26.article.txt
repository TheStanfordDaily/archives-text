# Farm Will Take Big Game, Say Optimistic Card Coaches
## 
### 
Stanford's coaching staff is not the
most pessimistic group of grid in
structors in the world. In fact they
showed a marked optimism in their
predictions concerning the outcome
of tomorrow's battle with California.
Head Coach Tiny Thornhill was
the most conservative in his outlook.
"We are going to try to win; that's
all I can say right now," said Thorn
hill as he puffed pensively on his
cigarette.
Grayson Favors Reds
Bobby Grayson was a little surer
of the results. He said: "1 think we
can win. Our line can outcharge
theirs and they have no deception in
the backfield with which to fool us."
Freshman mentor Harry Shipkey de
clared: "As go the guards, so goes
Stanford. If we can check Califor
nia's power down the middle we will

win the bail game."
An enthusiastic note was struck
by line coach Ben Winkleman, who
halted his conversation with an in
quisitive alumnus long enough to
say: "I think our chances are very
good. It is going to be one of the
most exciting Big Games of all time.
If things break right we'll win, if
they don'tâ€”"
Lawson Sees Win
End coach Jim Lawson was also
inclined to favor the boys that he
coaches. "Our line has the edge on
theirs, and although their backfield
may have us shaded, the line is the
decisive factor. We will win."
When asked how Stanford would
go about the business of beating Cal
ifornia, Husky Hunt replied: "By
playing GO minutes of smart foot
ball."
