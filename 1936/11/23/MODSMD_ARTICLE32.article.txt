SOME PEOPLE MAKE
MILD PREDICTIONS, AND

! BUT IT MAY BE
I DIFFERENT, SO—

For the sake of variety two years
ago, Millard Browne, then custodian
of this trying column, made a lot of
straightforward predictions about
the Big Game the next day.
They were the usual run of the
line stuff, giving Stanford the game
by two touchdowns. Well, as you
remember, the game in '34 was any
thing but run of the line, and it was
a lot tougher than the 9-7 final might
indicate.
To summarize, Brownie's predic
tions were completely haywire, and
he was the victim of fate, because
they were a pretty sure thing before
Moscrip wrecked his knee, and
Grayson his rib .... But Browne,
in spite of his bum predictions, still
stands respected by his friends as an
intelligent and capable guy. He did
not lose anything.
So here goes: Final score, Stanford
13, California 10. California will win
the toss, and kickofT to Stanford.
Brigham and Chapman will get at
least one punt off before any fire
works start, and then Stanford will
take the first one on the chin—a
wobbly kick, or fumble.
Cal will capitalize, get down close,
and Sparks will get his field goal, to
end the first quarter. Calvelli will
come in, Stanford will receive. In
eight plays they'll have a first down
inside the California 30, and then
bog down. Zagar'll block a kick and
we will make a touchdown before
the half. Conversion, not good.
Stanford leading, then, 6-3. Cali
fornia will look like a new team in
the third quarter, and Bottari will
pass for a score, the gain to be
greater than 35 yards from scrim
mage. Conversion good, 10-6.
Stanford will make the final score
in the middle of the final quarter; it
will be made by a halfback. Luckett
will kick this one, 13-10. Both teams
will penetrate to the opposing 25-
yard line after the final score, not
closer than the 15.
Other generalities: Two starters
will be removed from the game in
the first quarter and not return to
the lineup. Herwig and Chooch will
both go full distance, as will Meek
and Zagar. California will use four
left halfbacks. Pollock's best run
will not exceed 30 yards. Stanford's
best play will not exceed 25 yards.
The stadium will be filled. A lot
of people will be late. The Rally
Committee will have trouble with
their seating arrangements. The
Stanford Band will be good before
the game, inferior during the game.
The weather will be perfect. Gray
son will wear his gray suit. The goal
posts will come down. There will
not be a dog on the field. There will

I be one important decision by the of
ficials that will be found afterward
to be wrong. The first downs of one
team will be within two of those of
the other. Total yardage will go to
Stanford.

For the superstitious, we have
two good ones, but they offset each
other. Look at the leap years: 1924,
20-20. 1928, 13-13. And 1932, 0-0.
Could '36 be anything but a tie at
this rate?
Has Stanford lost any away-from
home gamfis? Yes, one, but that was
Washington State.
So much for that, then. If Doctor
Wilbur doesn't call the game off,
bring an aspirin, because it's going
to be as exciting as any you've seen.
And be sure to bring a hacksaw.
