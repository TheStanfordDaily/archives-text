Hence, the following statement*
were gleaned from the hardy gemle
men who play football in an efi'A
to establish the fact. Of course, >n<'
slight discrepancy arises with th>
realization that maybe, since ih ■
players are all on Stanford's tem,
there might lie a bit of biased opm
ion. Little things like that have !i«i
dismissed as inconsequential, le»-
ing the following:
Jack Walton—As long as we hlv
fast centers and guards like Tsofii -
souvas and Matthews who can thro v.'
laterals around, we're a cinch.
Glenn Hamilton—Well, hell, it's a
cinch.
Jake Brigham—They're overeoftfi
dent, and that's why we will' peat
'em. John Meek, their quart* rbick,
is 90 per cent of their defense. H
Carl Schott—We have a sw?ll
chance, but it'll be a tight ball game.
Henry Sparks is a great pa s
catcher.

dismissed as inconsequential, le»-
ing the following:
Jack Walton—As long as we hlv
fast centers and guards like Tsofii -
souvas and Matthews who can thro v.'
laterals around, we're a cinch.
Glenn Hamilton—Well, hell, it's a
cinch.
Jake Brigham—They're overeoftfi

'em. John Meek, their quart* rbick,
is 90 per cent of their defense. H
Carl Schott—We have a sw?ll
chance, but it'll be a tight ball game.
Henry Sparks is a great pa s
catcher.
