# It Almost Happened There

J>OSSIBLY because they went ber
serk" Friday night, damaging Ber
keley street car lines and private j
property in an explosion of pre
game enthusiasm. Cal rooters acted |
like gentlemen when the axe was 1
transferred at the Big Game Satur
day.
But the kindled Californians man
aged to make a mob scene very |
nearly a reality.
Tension reached its height as U.C.
rooters tore across the field after the
final gun, yelling, "We want the
Axe!" and "We want it now!"
It was a critical moment, with Cal
apparently on the verge of charging |
up into the stands from the players' i
bench where many of them were j
standing, and the Stanford rooters!
piqued by their unmitigated loss. It
could have happened there.
Changed Tactics
Rally Committee heads had decid- I
ed, near the end of the game, to ,
I make a private presentation of the j
j axe, but the situation appeared so
grave and delicate that they changed
plans the last minute, fearing that a
delay might precipitate mob fury.
While Farm Yell Leaders Webb
Jones, Nelly Wheeler, and Jim Ran- ]
sohoff worked to prevent booing and
| other venting of antagonism, the Cal
leaders had their hands full keeping)
their rooters under control and out j
of the Stanford stands.
Two-minute Chase
Chick Franich, assisted by three
California men, had run over to the
i Stephens Union, returning about two'
| minutes before the end of the game
I with the box containing the axe.
Few classes were held at Cal on
I Thursday and Friday, and student

leaders and the administration were
scarcely able to stop a revenge raid
on Stanford of over 2000 students,
for the asserted slugging of three
Big "C" guards and the two red
washings of the Big "C."
Cal vented their emotions Friday
night by building fires in the streets
J of Berkeley and tearing down trol
ley wires. Twenty students were ar
rested with eight of them released for
the game on payment of $200 bail
apiece. Twelve had to spend the Big
Game afternoon in the, Berkeley
l hoosgow.
U.C. Faces $300 Suit
Suing the University for $300
damage to car cables, the East Bay
i Traction Company is trying to re
| cover material losses caused by the
evening's enthusiasm. An unofficial
j source said that the company would
j call off the suit if the university ex-
I polled the students accused of the
| destruction.
But the snatching of Stanford band
hats was the closest approach to
! post-game violence, in a hectic week
<>f C-painting, S-burning. aerial
i raids, kidnap threats and rumors that
i a Cal army of 4000 avengers would
i "paint the Farm red with yellow."
Lids Snatched
Howard Hoover, trumpet player,
, was the first to be a victim of
! the lid-filchers. Harry Press, clari
net player, lost his hat three separate
times. Someone jumped on a Cal
I girl to recover it the first time, and
the second time he dented his clari
net on someone's skull.
Trumpet Player Jim Lehman had
i his hat snatched two hours after the
j game. An unsubstantiated rumor
circulated that one of the band play
ers sold his hat for $2 73. An orange

thrown by a Cal rooter, hit Cynthia
Coon ley in the stomach, knocking
her unconscious.
