# WHO'S DRUNK?-PAPA

### 
â–  r T , HEY served tomato juice in En
cina Commons Sunday morning,
but it was only a noble gesture to
the old superstition about Big Game
night. The California state headache
ratio jumped dizzily Sunday morn
ing, but it didn't jump very much at
Stanford.
While mamma and papa were wav
ing their arms, sloppily accosting
husbands and wives not their own,
drooling onto table clothes, getting
into fights, and saying "Whee" with a
faint exhalation of the breath, sons of
the Stanford Red spent a rather sober
and quite dispassionate evening, a
Daily check-up revealed.
Stanford students for generations
have been weaned on the theory that
the Masque Ball and Big Game night
are hilarious bacchanals with revel
ers casting all restraint to the wind.*
in wild abandon. Indeed, some stu
dents claim that is all they come to
college for. The Masque Ball has
been notoriously and laboriously
sober for the past few years, but this
is the first time that anyone has cast
any aspersions on Big Game night.
Anti-climax
For a campus that had gone
through the excitement of building
a Bonfire and guarding it on the oc
casion of the various false alarms,
the spirited Rally, the lighting of the
Bonfire, the Big Game jolly-up, the
smash-hit Big Game Gaieties, and
the Big Game jolly-up. the football
game itself was an anti climax. And
Big Game night was just that much
too much.
A good many students didn't go
out at all Big Game night. Some of
the stout roughs dated to the cinema,
while others drove home and went to
bed. The cover charges of $11 to $12
per couple frightened most students
away from the City hotels. Many who
pounded up the Bayshore wandered
around from hotel to hotel trying to
crash or pick up pass-out checks.
Some parties went to a movie, a few
went out to the beach and tried the
roller coaster.
Dorscy Dance
The two-buck bids for the Dorsev
Dance in the California Gymnasium
appealed to quite a few Stanfordites.
The place was jammed by Cal stu
dents, many of whom were pretty
high, what with the game and things,
but our confidential observer found
rarefied atmosphere in few Stanford
ites' breaths.
The Stanford alumni kicked up
their heels at the Palace dance, but
in general, Stanford was definitely
outnumbered by Cal in the City,
even at the Palace. Though no one
was on hand Sunday morning to
make a dead-soldier check on the
j city hotels, sources close to the gov
ernor last night rated the Mark as
woozier than the Palace, while the
Frantic warped itself into first place
as groggiest.
Stealth
The* Stanfordites who moved on
down South to Brookdale or Del
Monte found the situation well in
hand. Brookdale was so quiet you
could hear a pint drop.
While Del Monte reeked with still
ness, Stanford took over the hotel
again this year as it did last. After
taking four hours to drive down,
many of the Stanfordites found they
had to wait an hour or so to get
registered in the mobbed lobby.
Weaver rocked a Del Monte audi
ence last year with "Nuts to Cal";
this time, the feature of the evening
was a piano solo of "There's a Long.
Long Trail a-Winding," played by
the composer.
As everywhere else, there was a
fair amount of drinking at Del
Monte. A lot of the boys took a swal
low or two, but, in general, the days
of the roaring college drunk seemed
past.

When the Golden Gate Bridge is
finished, the Bay Region will have
two world famous suspension bridg
es. But the only Bridges that can
keep the world famous Bay Region
in suspension is Harry.
