# MAKING THE GRADES AT STANFORD
## 
### DICK HODGSON 
Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that
admission to Stanford, nor can Stan
ford authoritatively claim that its re
quirements are above Cal's. The two
schools base their requirements on
items that are not comparable. Stan
ford requires a certain percentage of
recommending grades and only spe
cifically requires that 2 units of Eng
lish be included in the high school

curriculum. ,
California, however, requires the
same percentage of recommending
grades, granting perhaps more lee
way than does Stanford as to grades,
but in turn it definitely specifies the
particular subjects in which these
grades are to be made.
Stanford and Cal apparently have
a different "philosophy" about sub

ject requirements, but at Cal, if the"
applicant has these grades and sub
ject requirements, he is admitted,
while at Stanford, the applicant's
score on the aptitude ex must satisfy
the Admission Committee in addition
to recommending grades from high
school.
It has been found after consider
able study that high school grades

'are certainly not an adequate single
measure of a student's ability to do
measures of a student's ability to do
acceptable college work, or to make
a success of his later life. The pre
diction with the use of an aptitude
ex is more accurate and the corre
lation of the two together make a
rather satisfactory basis for college
work prediction and vocational
guidance.
For 12 long years, prospective
Stanford "Buck of the Month Club
bers' 'and their potential wives have
taken a day off during their senior
week at high school to come to Stan
ford. Lowell High School, L. A. Jun
ior College to take the Thorndyke
aptitude ex as part of the extensive
preparatory process of becoming a
Stanford freshman.
But when this June rolls along ap
plicants will face a combination of
two aptitude exes, entirely different
from former years. No longer will it
be helpful to have the good old high
school math teacher drag out prob
lems that her shining light had cop
ied off the infamous Stanford Apti
tude ex of previous years.
Replacing the Thorndyke ex will
be an examination developed by
Ohio colleges and high schools, which
is used throughout Ohio by all its
high schools. This particular ex will
last only two hours compared with
the Thorndyke's three. The Univer
sity committee on admission feels,
however, that the Ohio psychological
ex will accomplish more in its two
hours than did the old Thorndyke.
and that it also measures more di
rectly the ability of the incoming
student to do acceptable college
work.
In addition to this ex, applicants to
Stanford will be confronted with an
uncanny reading examination de
vised to measure the speed and com
prehension of reading matter. This
reading quiz is still in the stage of
development with the frosh members
of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum
injected monkeys. The results <>! this
experimental ex are being compared
with the results of the lowa reading
test which previously has been given
to all entering freshmen. It is ex
pected that the new reading ex will
be more comprehensive and will
will give a more reliable measure of
the students' ability.
Results in the past have tended to
show that the correlation with grades
made in reading exes with the stu
dent's later academic grades is bet
ter than the grade correlation with
the aptitude ex; therefore more em
phasis will be placed on the reading
ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac
tors does not always alone deter
mine whether a student will be ad
mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only
other large school in the state that
gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first
quarter 348
1929 Ist year entrants after first
year 356
1931 junior transfers after first
year 333
1930 Ist year entrants after first
year 318
1932 first year entrants after first
year 2SI

1934 graduating seniors 335
1931 Ist year entrants after first
year 317
1933 junior transfers aftei; first
year 330
1935 gi'aduating seniors 307
1932 st year entrants after first
year 203
1934 junior transfers after first
year .237
1936 graduating seniors 319
These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

All the world's a stage.â€”Shake
speare. Next time try the train. â€”

These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that
admission to Stanford, nor can Stan
ford authoritatively claim that its re
quirements are above Cal's. The two
schools base their requirements on
items that are not comparable. Stan
ford requires a certain percentage of
recommending grades and only spe
cifically requires that 2 units of Eng
lish be included in the high school

curriculum. ,
California, however, requires the
same percentage of recommending
grades, granting perhaps more lee
way than does Stanford as to grades,
but in turn it definitely specifies the
particular subjects in which these
grades are to be made.
Stanford and Cal apparently have
a different "philosophy" about sub

ject requirements, but at Cal, if the"
applicant has these grades and sub
ject requirements, he is admitted,
while at Stanford, the applicant's
score on the aptitude ex must satisfy
the Admission Committee in addition
to recommending grades from high
school.
It has been found after consider
able study that high school grades

'are certainly not an adequate single
measure of a student's ability to do
measures of a student's ability to do
acceptable college work, or to make
a success of his later life. The pre
diction with the use of an aptitude
ex is more accurate and the corre
lation of the two together make a
rather satisfactory basis for college
work prediction and vocational
guidance.
For 12 long years, prospective
Stanford "Buck of the Month Club
bers' 'and their potential wives have
taken a day off during their senior
week at high school to come to Stan
ford. Lowell High School, L. A. Jun
ior College to take the Thorndyke
aptitude ex as part of the extensive
preparatory process of becoming a
Stanford freshman.
But when this June rolls along ap
plicants will face a combination of
two aptitude exes, entirely different
from former years. No longer will it
be helpful to have the good old high
school math teacher drag out prob
lems that her shining light had cop
ied off the infamous Stanford Apti
tude ex of previous years.
Replacing the Thorndyke ex will
be an examination developed by
Ohio colleges and high schools, which
is used throughout Ohio by all its
high schools. This particular ex will
last only two hours compared with
the Thorndyke's three. The Univer
sity committee on admission feels,
however, that the Ohio psychological
ex will accomplish more in its two
hours than did the old Thorndyke.
and that it also measures more di
rectly the ability of the incoming
student to do acceptable college
work.
In addition to this ex, applicants to
Stanford will be confronted with an
uncanny reading examination de
vised to measure the speed and com
prehension of reading matter. This
reading quiz is still in the stage of
development with the frosh members
of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum
injected monkeys. The results <>! this
experimental ex are being compared
with the results of the lowa reading
test which previously has been given
to all entering freshmen. It is ex
pected that the new reading ex will
be more comprehensive and will
will give a more reliable measure of
the students' ability.
Results in the past have tended to
show that the correlation with grades
made in reading exes with the stu
dent's later academic grades is bet
ter than the grade correlation with
the aptitude ex; therefore more em
phasis will be placed on the reading
ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac
tors does not always alone deter
mine whether a student will be ad
mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only
other large school in the state that
gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first

1929 Ist year entrants after first

gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first
quarter 348
1929 Ist year entrants after first
year 356
1931 junior transfers after first
year 333
1930 Ist year entrants after first
year 318
1932 first year entrants after first
year 2SI

1934 graduating seniors 335
1931 Ist year entrants after first
year 317
1933 junior transfers aftei; first
year 330
1935 gi'aduating seniors 307
1932 st year entrants after first
year 203
1934 junior transfers after first
year .237
1936 graduating seniors 319
These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that
admission to Stanford, nor can Stan
ford authoritatively claim that its re
quirements are above Cal's. The two
schools base their requirements on
items that are not comparable. Stan
ford requires a certain percentage of
recommending grades and only spe
cifically requires that 2 units of Eng
lish be included in the high school

curriculum. ,
California, however, requires the
same percentage of recommending
grades, granting perhaps more lee
way than does Stanford as to grades,
but in turn it definitely specifies the
particular subjects in which these
grades are to be made.
Stanford and Cal apparently have
a different "philosophy" about sub

ject requirements, but at Cal, if the"
applicant has these grades and sub
ject requirements, he is admitted,
while at Stanford, the applicant's
score on the aptitude ex must satisfy
the Admission Committee in addition
to recommending grades from high
school.
It has been found after consider
able study that high school grades

'are certainly not an adequate single
measure of a student's ability to do
measures of a student's ability to do
acceptable college work, or to make
a success of his later life. The pre
diction with the use of an aptitude
ex is more accurate and the corre
lation of the two together make a
rather satisfactory basis for college
work prediction and vocational
guidance.
For 12 long years, prospective
Stanford "Buck of the Month Club
bers' 'and their potential wives have
taken a day off during their senior
week at high school to come to Stan
ford. Lowell High School, L. A. Jun
ior College to take the Thorndyke
aptitude ex as part of the extensive
preparatory process of becoming a
Stanford freshman.
But when this June rolls along ap
plicants will face a combination of
two aptitude exes, entirely different
from former years. No longer will it
be helpful to have the good old high
school math teacher drag out prob
lems that her shining light had cop
ied off the infamous Stanford Apti
tude ex of previous years.
Replacing the Thorndyke ex will
be an examination developed by
Ohio colleges and high schools, which
is used throughout Ohio by all its
high schools. This particular ex will
last only two hours compared with
the Thorndyke's three. The Univer
sity committee on admission feels,
however, that the Ohio psychological
ex will accomplish more in its two
hours than did the old Thorndyke.
and that it also measures more di
rectly the ability of the incoming
student to do acceptable college
work.
In addition to this ex, applicants to
Stanford will be confronted with an
uncanny reading examination de
vised to measure the speed and com
prehension of reading matter. This
reading quiz is still in the stage of
development with the frosh members
of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum
injected monkeys. The results <>! this
experimental ex are being compared
with the results of the lowa reading
test which previously has been given
to all entering freshmen. It is ex
pected that the new reading ex will
be more comprehensive and will
will give a more reliable measure of
the students' ability.
Results in the past have tended to
show that the correlation with grades
made in reading exes with the stu
dent's later academic grades is bet
ter than the grade correlation with
the aptitude ex; therefore more em
phasis will be placed on the reading
ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac
tors does not always alone deter
mine whether a student will be ad
mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only

high schools. This particular ex will
last only two hours compared with
the Thorndyke's three. The Univer
sity committee on admission feels,
however, that the Ohio psychological
ex will accomplish more in its two
hours than did the old Thorndyke.
and that it also measures more di
rectly the ability of the incoming
student to do acceptable college
work.
In addition to this ex, applicants to
Stanford will be confronted with an
uncanny reading examination de
vised to measure the speed and com
prehension of reading matter. This
reading quiz is still in the stage of
development with the frosh members
of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum
injected monkeys. The results <>! this
experimental ex are being compared
with the results of the lowa reading
test which previously has been given
to all entering freshmen. It is ex
pected that the new reading ex will
be more comprehensive and will
will give a more reliable measure of
the students' ability.
Results in the past have tended to
show that the correlation with grades
made in reading exes with the stu
dent's later academic grades is bet
ter than the grade correlation with
the aptitude ex; therefore more em
phasis will be placed on the reading
ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac
tors does not always alone deter
mine whether a student will be ad
mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only
other large school in the state that
gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first
quarter 348
1929 Ist year entrants after first
year 356
1931 junior transfers after first
year 333
1930 Ist year entrants after first
year 318
1932 first year entrants after first
year 2SI

1934 graduating seniors 335
1931 Ist year entrants after first
year 317
1933 junior transfers aftei; first
year 330
1935 gi'aduating seniors 307
1932 st year entrants after first
year 203
1934 junior transfers after first
year .237
1936 graduating seniors 319
These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that
admission to Stanford, nor can Stan
ford authoritatively claim that its re
quirements are above Cal's. The two
schools base their requirements on
items that are not comparable. Stan
ford requires a certain percentage of
recommending grades and only spe
cifically requires that 2 units of Eng
lish be included in the high school

curriculum. ,
California, however, requires the
same percentage of recommending
grades, granting perhaps more lee
way than does Stanford as to grades,
but in turn it definitely specifies the
particular subjects in which these
grades are to be made.
Stanford and Cal apparently have
a different "philosophy" about sub

ject requirements, but at Cal, if the"
applicant has these grades and sub
ject requirements, he is admitted,
while at Stanford, the applicant's
score on the aptitude ex must satisfy
the Admission Committee in addition
to recommending grades from high
school.
It has been found after consider
able study that high school grades

'are certainly not an adequate single
measure of a student's ability to do
measures of a student's ability to do
acceptable college work, or to make
a success of his later life. The pre
diction with the use of an aptitude
ex is more accurate and the corre
lation of the two together make a
rather satisfactory basis for college
work prediction and vocational
guidance.
For 12 long years, prospective
Stanford "Buck of the Month Club
bers' 'and their potential wives have
taken a day off during their senior
week at high school to come to Stan
ford. Lowell High School, L. A. Jun
ior College to take the Thorndyke
aptitude ex as part of the extensive
preparatory process of becoming a
Stanford freshman.
But when this June rolls along ap
plicants will face a combination of
two aptitude exes, entirely different
from former years. No longer will it
be helpful to have the good old high
school math teacher drag out prob
lems that her shining light had cop
ied off the infamous Stanford Apti
tude ex of previous years.
Replacing the Thorndyke ex will
be an examination developed by
Ohio colleges and high schools, which
is used throughout Ohio by all its

is used throughout Ohio by all its

of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum

ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac

mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only
other large school in the state that
gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first
quarter 348
1929 Ist year entrants after first
year 356
1931 junior transfers after first
year 333
1930 Ist year entrants after first
year 318
1932 first year entrants after first
year 2SI

1934 graduating seniors 335
1931 Ist year entrants after first
year 317
1933 junior transfers aftei; first
year 330
1935 gi'aduating seniors 307
1932 st year entrants after first
year 203
1934 junior transfers after first
year .237
1936 graduating seniors 319
These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that

are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
Lower Grade Averages
But even though Stanford did not
lower its admission requirements, the
trend of general University grade
averages have been on the downward
trend for the past four years, and the
average for this year is expected to
lower yet. closely approximating an
average of 2.50.
But these lower averages can not
be laid exclusively to the influx of
women in the past few years. They
of course have definitely played their
part in dragging down the average
because the competition for admis
sion has not been so great. In the
days of the 500, the Committee on
Admissions would pick out only
those few 125 women who excelled
in scholarship, in personal character,
and high school activities; and then
discard the others. When new wom
en were taken in, however, the group
that was discarded was now as small
as the group that was formerly con
sidered "500 material."
At the present time, the admission
committee is faced with the problem
of choosing women who fall in the
middle class between those who are
definitely in and those who are defi
nitely out, for again the standard of
women applicants has taken the up
ward trend from its former depths.
Perhaps an even more potent fac
tor has been the University ruling
which allows the upper division stu
dent to continue in school regardless
of his grades as long as the individual
departments will allow him to regis
ter for courses in that department.
Stiffer Grading
Because of this ruling, professors
and correctors have not had that
sympathetic attitude toward those
students on the "lunatic fringe" of
the grade system that they used to
in the good old days when it was easy
for a student to flunk out of the up
per division. Because it is hard to get
rid of this sub-marginal member of
the upper division, examinations are
graded on a stiffer basis than before,
which has also tended to lower the
general University grade average.
But it definitely cannot be said

'that admission to Cal is harder that
admission to Stanford, nor can Stan
ford authoritatively claim that its re
quirements are above Cal's. The two
schools base their requirements on
items that are not comparable. Stan
ford requires a certain percentage of
recommending grades and only spe
cifically requires that 2 units of Eng
lish be included in the high school

curriculum. ,
California, however, requires the
same percentage of recommending
grades, granting perhaps more lee
way than does Stanford as to grades,
but in turn it definitely specifies the
particular subjects in which these
grades are to be made.
Stanford and Cal apparently have
a different "philosophy" about sub

ject requirements, but at Cal, if the"
applicant has these grades and sub
ject requirements, he is admitted,
while at Stanford, the applicant's
score on the aptitude ex must satisfy
the Admission Committee in addition
to recommending grades from high
school.
It has been found after consider
able study that high school grades

'are certainly not an adequate single
measure of a student's ability to do
measures of a student's ability to do
acceptable college work, or to make
a success of his later life. The pre
diction with the use of an aptitude
ex is more accurate and the corre
lation of the two together make a
rather satisfactory basis for college
work prediction and vocational
guidance.
For 12 long years, prospective
Stanford "Buck of the Month Club
bers' 'and their potential wives have
taken a day off during their senior
week at high school to come to Stan
ford. Lowell High School, L. A. Jun
ior College to take the Thorndyke
aptitude ex as part of the extensive
preparatory process of becoming a
Stanford freshman.
But when this June rolls along ap
plicants will face a combination of
two aptitude exes, entirely different
from former years. No longer will it
be helpful to have the good old high
school math teacher drag out prob
lems that her shining light had cop
ied off the infamous Stanford Apti
tude ex of previous years.
Replacing the Thorndyke ex will
be an examination developed by
Ohio colleges and high schools, which
is used throughout Ohio by all its
high schools. This particular ex will
last only two hours compared with
the Thorndyke's three. The Univer
sity committee on admission feels,
however, that the Ohio psychological
ex will accomplish more in its two
hours than did the old Thorndyke.
and that it also measures more di
rectly the ability of the incoming
student to do acceptable college
work.
In addition to this ex, applicants to
Stanford will be confronted with an
uncanny reading examination de
vised to measure the speed and com
prehension of reading matter. This
reading quiz is still in the stage of
development with the frosh members
of the History of Western Civilization
course playing the part of the serum
injected monkeys. The results <>! this
experimental ex are being compared
with the results of the lowa reading
test which previously has been given
to all entering freshmen. It is ex
pected that the new reading ex will
be more comprehensive and will
will give a more reliable measure of
the students' ability.
Results in the past have tended to
show that the correlation with grades
made in reading exes with the stu
dent's later academic grades is bet
ter than the grade correlation with
the aptitude ex; therefore more em
phasis will be placed on the reading
ex this spring.
Despite the fact that high schools
hold up the passing of the aptitude
test as the holy of the holies, this ex
is not by any means regarded by the
University Committee on Admissions
as an arbitrary selector of future
Stanford students. Along with high
school records, and boasts of high
school extracurricular leadership is
considering the grade made on the
aptitude and reading exes. But even
the combination of these three fac
tors does not always alone deter
mine whether a student will be ad
mitted. It is not to be said that the
axe of refusal of admittance slashes
according to purely arbitrary stand
ards, for no one of three factors
alone, or even together, can always
be an accurate judge of the student's
ability.
No Aptitude Ex for Cal
With Stanford dropping the Thorn
dyke ex, U.S.C. is left as the only
other large school in the state that
gives the Thorndyke ex. Some of the
smaller institutions such as Pomona,
Mills, and the University of Red
lands have been giving the ex, but
any attempt to have a universal ac
ceptance of this ex or any ex in
California colleges and universities
has been dinged by the action of Cal
ifornia and its rival offspring,
U.C.L.A., neither of which attempt to
give any sort of aptitude ex to classi
fy their students or aid them in the
selection of their vocation.
U.S.C. uses the aptitude test only to
aid in vocational guidance of their
students, and does not use it as an
admission requirement in any way.
In fact, U.S.C., through its junior col
lege, will admit on trial any student
regardless of his high school record
or program. Here the collegiate out
casts have a chance to show whether
they have been hiding anything all
through the years that just needed a
J. C. to bring it out. They may not go
out for any athletics or any activi

ties, making the J. C. a proving
ground for these particular students
who did poorly in high school.
Somewhat in line with this J. C.
policy of U.S.C. is the extension divi
sion of the University of California,
which was originally provided to en
able California applicants to make up
high school deficiencies before get
ting into Cal. But the extension at
tendant outwardly has all the privi
leges of a regular Cal student. He
may live in fraternity houses and his
classes are held on the regular
California campus.
During the 12 years experience
that Stanford has had with the
Thorndyke aptitude test, the correla
tion existing between test results
and grades made at Stanford is not a
very high one.
To draw conclusions successfully
about the success on an individual
student this correlation should be
around .80, however, the group cor
relation has fairly consistently run
in the .30 to .40 range, as is shown
by the following table. This table
gives the correlation between test
scores and grades after the first year
for freshmen, between test scores
and grades after the first year for
junior transfers, and between test
scores and grades of graduating sen
iors:
3929 Ist year entrants after first
quarter 348
1929 Ist year entrants after first
year 356
1931 junior transfers after first
year 333
1930 Ist year entrants after first
year 318
1932 first year entrants after first
year 2SI

1934 graduating seniors 335
1931 Ist year entrants after first
year 317
1933 junior transfers aftei; first
year 330
1935 gi'aduating seniors 307
1932 st year entrants after first
year 203
1934 junior transfers after first
year .237
1936 graduating seniors 319
These figures tend to show that in
some years, the correlation between
freshman grades and test scores is
higher than the correlation of that
same freshman group's senior grades,
while in other years the reverse is
true â€”but in all cases it is seen that
the correlation of the Thorndyke ex
is too low to rely solely on the results
of the aptitude tests for an arbitrary
measure of the applicant's ability.
With the innovation of the Ohio
Slate psychological and the longer
reading examination, it is expected
that a higher correlation will be ob
tained between these test scores and
college grades. And so that when the

little card comes Idling that you are
in the group in which nine out .of ten
people flunk out of Stanford, you
have fairly good chance of flunking
outâ€”if you ever get in.

Judging by the tremendous en
thusiasm evinced by the Bear root
ers and Herwig on the field, what
Stanford needs is a good big "S" to
be painted yellow, and a couple of
sophomore guards to be slugged on
the head.

All the world's a stage.â€”Shake
speare. Next time try the train. â€”

Vt HEN Stanford, coincidentally
with the peak of the depression,
lowered the grade requirements to
11 recommending grades to be made
in the last three years of high school
rather than 15 in four years, alumni
and stifT-shirted educational investi
gators cried that Stanford was not
maintaining its former high scholas
tic requirements. Now, they claim
ed, California had the lead between
these two schools as to which had
the hardest admission requirements.
But registrar officials here at Stan
ford claim that is just as hard if not
harder to make 11 recommending
grades in three years that it is to
make 15 in four years. They back up
this claim by saying that in the ma
jority of cases, recommending gi'ades
are easier to make in the first year of
high school than in subsequent
years.
