# Providence A Short Story

### JEAN HICKS 
By JEAN HICKS

r pHE GIRL in the gray coat stood ;
on the corner, staring at the other
side of the street. It was a long way
over there and it wouid be an effort
to cross and miss the cars that were
shooting by. Why did cars go so
fast? Why did everything move so
fast, all of the time? Wasn't anyone I
else ever tired?
Well, she didn't have to cross right
now. There was time, plenty of it.
She moved back from the corner and
leaned against the wall of a drug
store. It was better here, in the dark.
Funny, she hated lights. There were
so damned many of them, just like
the cars. Lights and noise and things
going fast used to be fun—
Like that time the boy that worked
in the lunch counter with her had
taken her to Coney Island. That had
been fun—the roller coaster, and all
those things they had ridden on. It
made her shudder now to think of
the screeching sound that the wheels
of the roller coaster had made. She
wondered what had happened to the
boy who had taken her there. He
was a nice boy. He'd liked her, not
the way the others had later, but like
a nice boy would like you. That was
a long time ago, before she'd met
Mac. After that, she'd gone by the
lunch counter one time to see the
boy but he hadn't wanted to talk to
her. He must have heard ab"out her
and Mac.
* * *
She wondered if he'd be sorry for
her if he saw her now. But prob
ably he wouldn't be. Men weren't
sorry for you when you looked down
and out like she did. She didn't
blame them. No one liked being
around a girl who had gone to seed.
That was what the old lady had said
when she'd put her out.
"You can't stay here," she'd said.
"You get out and make room for
some girl's got more life than you.
Bad enough having your looks shot,
but you ain't even got any pep."
Some of the others had come in
and begged for her to stay but the
old lady had cursed them and they'd
gone out. They were scared of her.
She was glad she wouldn't have to
listen to the old lady curse any more.
She was glad, too, that she wouldn't
see Steve again. He cursed her, too.
He'd been at it since she'd started
being short on money for him. He
didn't sec why she couldn't get it
from the men who came to her; he
wouldn't believe her when she told
him there weren't many who asked
for her any more.
She'd said: "Look, Steve, they
don't want me. I'm not pretty any
more."
But he hadn't listened, and he was
too drunk to see anyhow.
* >t> *
After she left the house she'd gone
to see him. He was lying on his bed
asleep. She'd shaken him a little, to
get him up, and he had sat up curs
ing. She'd been afraid, then, to tell
him about the old lady putting her
out, so she'd gone away and told him
she'd come back later with some
money. That had been yesterday, or
maybe the day before. She didn't re
member. It was a long time. It had
been a long time to walk; the police
men didn't want you to sit on the
benches in the park.
Those cars were still going by in
the street. They made an awful noise
when they stopped. She hoped the
one that got her wouldn't make a
scrccching sound. Not that she would
I hear it, but anyhow, it would be
| nicer if it stopped without making a
noise. If she went over the bridge

she'd be sure there wouldn't be
noise. Just a splash, but the water
would be so damned cold, and it was
a long walk there. It would be easier
here. She'd just walk out in front of
the busses.
# Sjc #
There was one coming several
blocks away—and it wasn't due to
stop until the corner after this one.
She moved away from the wall and
stood, waiting, close to the curb.
"You look hungry, sister."
She started a little and then looked
at the man standing beside her. He
put something in her hand and
walked on. She looked down at it.
It was money, a 50-cent piece. She
turned to look after him but he
didn't look back, just kept on walk
ing. The bus came by and she stared
'at its lights. Then she went back
and stood against the wall, rubbing
her hands across the 50-cent piece.
He'd just come up and handed it to
her, then walked away. He'd said:
"You look hungry."
"You look hungry, sister." That
was what he had said, and then given
her the money. He hadn't wanted
anything, hadn't asked her for any
thing. She walked over to the
street-light so that she could see the
money better. It was really money,
and the man had given it to her
without asking for it, without ex
pecting anything for it.
# * *
She stared at a blue-green streak
of oil in the street, thinking. There
were men like that -men that gave
you money because they wanted to
be kind, because they were sorry for
you. There must be other people like
that. too. Decent people, who were
kind and tried to shoot square. She
started walking. If there were de
cent people in the world, then you
didn't have to die to yet away from
the rotten ones. You could go on

living, maybe you could get to be
decent yourself after a while. She
walked faster, almost running. Wilh
people like that in the world she'd
get along, somehow. Just knowing
about them made things all right.
There was a coffee-stand on the
corner. She'd go in there and get
something to cat, then she'd decide
what she was going to do. She
thought: It was funny how the man
came along just in time to keep her
from walking out into the street and
letting the bus get her. It was almost
as though it had been fate, something
watching over her. Providence, that
was it.
:{c ijc *
In the lunch-stand she ordered
coffee and doughnuts. The coffee
made her warm and the doughnuts
felt good in the emptiness of her
stomach. When she had finished she
put the 50-cent piece on the counter.
The man tossed it into the register,
and started to reach for her change.
Then—"Wait a minute," he said
lie took the coin from the drawer
and dropped it on the counter. It
made a hollow sound. The girl knew
that sound: it meant that the money
was counterfeit. She stared at the
man for a moment, not seeing him
hut seeing thtv one who'd given her
the coin, the man she'd thought was
decent, kind. He'd thought it was a
joke to give her a piece of counter
feit money, a good gag. He was the
man that had made her think there
were decent people in the world.
Running, the girl left the store;
reached the middle of the street in
front. When the driver of the green
touring car saw her. just in front of
the wheels, he tried desperately to
stop his car. There was the frantic
screeching of wheels as he put on the
brakes. But the girl in the grey coat,
lying in a still heap tin the pavement,
did not hear.

Funny, she hated lights. There were
so damned many of them, just like
the cars. Lights and noise and things
going fast used to be fun—
Like that time the boy that worked
in the lunch counter with her had
taken her to Coney Island. That had
been fun—the roller coaster, and all
those things they had ridden on. It
made her shudder now to think of
the screeching sound that the wheels
of the roller coaster had made. She
wondered what had happened to the
boy who had taken her there. He
was a nice boy. He'd liked her, not
the way the others had later, but like
a nice boy would like you. That was
a long time ago, before she'd met
Mac. After that, she'd gone by the
lunch counter one time to see the
boy but he hadn't wanted to talk to
her. He must have heard ab"out her
and Mac.
* * *
She wondered if he'd be sorry for
her if he saw her now. But prob
ably he wouldn't be. Men weren't
sorry for you when you looked down
and out like she did. She didn't
blame them. No one liked being
around a girl who had gone to seed.
That was what the old lady had said
when she'd put her out.
"You can't stay here," she'd said.
"You get out and make room for
some girl's got more life than you.
Bad enough having your looks shot,
but you ain't even got any pep."
Some of the others had come in
and begged for her to stay but the
old lady had cursed them and they'd
gone out. They were scared of her.
She was glad she wouldn't have to
listen to the old lady curse any more.
She was glad, too, that she wouldn't
see Steve again. He cursed her, too.
He'd been at it since she'd started
being short on money for him. He
didn't sec why she couldn't get it
from the men who came to her; he
wouldn't believe her when she told
him there weren't many who asked
for her any more.
She'd said: "Look, Steve, they
don't want me. I'm not pretty any
more."
But he hadn't listened, and he was
too drunk to see anyhow.
* >t> *
After she left the house she'd gone
to see him. He was lying on his bed
asleep. She'd shaken him a little, to
get him up, and he had sat up curs
ing. She'd been afraid, then, to tell
him about the old lady putting her
out, so she'd gone away and told him
she'd come back later with some
money. That had been yesterday, or
maybe the day before. She didn't re
member. It was a long time. It had
been a long time to walk; the police
men didn't want you to sit on the
benches in the park.
Those cars were still going by in
the street. They made an awful noise
when they stopped. She hoped the
one that got her wouldn't make a
scrccching sound. Not that she would
I hear it, but anyhow, it would be
| nicer if it stopped without making a
noise. If she went over the bridge

she'd be sure there wouldn't be
noise. Just a splash, but the water
would be so damned cold, and it was
a long walk there. It would be easier
here. She'd just walk out in front of
the busses.
# Sjc #
There was one coming several
blocks away—and it wasn't due to
stop until the corner after this one.
She moved away from the wall and
stood, waiting, close to the curb.
"You look hungry, sister."
She started a little and then looked
at the man standing beside her. He
put something in her hand and
walked on. She looked down at it.
It was money, a 50-cent piece. She
turned to look after him but he
didn't look back, just kept on walk
ing. The bus came by and she stared
'at its lights. Then she went back
and stood against the wall, rubbing
her hands across the 50-cent piece.
He'd just come up and handed it to
her, then walked away. He'd said:
"You look hungry."
"You look hungry, sister." That
was what he had said, and then given
her the money. He hadn't wanted
anything, hadn't asked her for any
thing. She walked over to the
street-light so that she could see the
money better. It was really money,
and the man had given it to her
without asking for it, without ex
pecting anything for it.
# * *
She stared at a blue-green streak
of oil in the street, thinking. There
were men like that -men that gave
you money because they wanted to
be kind, because they were sorry for
you. There must be other people like
that. too. Decent people, who were
kind and tried to shoot square. She
started walking. If there were de
cent people in the world, then you
didn't have to die to yet away from
the rotten ones. You could go on

living, maybe you could get to be
decent yourself after a while. She
walked faster, almost running. Wilh
people like that in the world she'd
get along, somehow. Just knowing
about them made things all right.
There was a coffee-stand on the
corner. She'd go in there and get
something to cat, then she'd decide
what she was going to do. She
thought: It was funny how the man
came along just in time to keep her
from walking out into the street and
letting the bus get her. It was almost
as though it had been fate, something
watching over her. Providence, that
was it.
:{c ijc *
In the lunch-stand she ordered
coffee and doughnuts. The coffee
made her warm and the doughnuts
felt good in the emptiness of her
stomach. When she had finished she
put the 50-cent piece on the counter.
The man tossed it into the register,
and started to reach for her change.
Then—"Wait a minute," he said
lie took the coin from the drawer
and dropped it on the counter. It
made a hollow sound. The girl knew
that sound: it meant that the money
was counterfeit. She stared at the
man for a moment, not seeing him
hut seeing thtv one who'd given her
the coin, the man she'd thought was
decent, kind. He'd thought it was a
joke to give her a piece of counter
feit money, a good gag. He was the
man that had made her think there
were decent people in the world.
Running, the girl left the store;
reached the middle of the street in
front. When the driver of the green
touring car saw her. just in front of
the wheels, he tried desperately to
stop his car. There was the frantic
screeching of wheels as he put on the
brakes. But the girl in the grey coat,
lying in a still heap tin the pavement,
did not hear.

the way the others had later, but like
a nice boy would like you. That was
a long time ago, before she'd met
Mac. After that, she'd gone by the
lunch counter one time to see the
boy but he hadn't wanted to talk to
her. He must have heard ab"out her
and Mac.
* * *
She wondered if he'd be sorry for
her if he saw her now. But prob
ably he wouldn't be. Men weren't
sorry for you when you looked down
and out like she did. She didn't
blame them. No one liked being
around a girl who had gone to seed.
That was what the old lady had said
when she'd put her out.
"You can't stay here," she'd said.
"You get out and make room for
some girl's got more life than you.
Bad enough having your looks shot,
but you ain't even got any pep."
Some of the others had come in
and begged for her to stay but the
old lady had cursed them and they'd
gone out. They were scared of her.
She was glad she wouldn't have to
listen to the old lady curse any more.
She was glad, too, that she wouldn't
see Steve again. He cursed her, too.
He'd been at it since she'd started
being short on money for him. He
didn't sec why she couldn't get it
from the men who came to her; he
wouldn't believe her when she told
him there weren't many who asked
for her any more.
She'd said: "Look, Steve, they
don't want me. I'm not pretty any
more."
But he hadn't listened, and he was
too drunk to see anyhow.
* >t> *
After she left the house she'd gone
to see him. He was lying on his bed
asleep. She'd shaken him a little, to
get him up, and he had sat up curs
ing. She'd been afraid, then, to tell
him about the old lady putting her
out, so she'd gone away and told him
she'd come back later with some
money. That had been yesterday, or
maybe the day before. She didn't re
member. It was a long time. It had
been a long time to walk; the police
men didn't want you to sit on the
benches in the park.
Those cars were still going by in
the street. They made an awful noise
when they stopped. She hoped the
one that got her wouldn't make a
scrccching sound. Not that she would
I hear it, but anyhow, it would be
| nicer if it stopped without making a
noise. If she went over the bridge

she'd be sure there wouldn't be
noise. Just a splash, but the water
would be so damned cold, and it was
a long walk there. It would be easier
here. She'd just walk out in front of
the busses.
# Sjc #
There was one coming several
blocks away—and it wasn't due to
stop until the corner after this one.
She moved away from the wall and
stood, waiting, close to the curb.
"You look hungry, sister."
She started a little and then looked
at the man standing beside her. He
put something in her hand and
walked on. She looked down at it.
It was money, a 50-cent piece. She
turned to look after him but he
didn't look back, just kept on walk
ing. The bus came by and she stared
'at its lights. Then she went back
and stood against the wall, rubbing
her hands across the 50-cent piece.
He'd just come up and handed it to
her, then walked away. He'd said:
"You look hungry."
"You look hungry, sister." That
was what he had said, and then given
her the money. He hadn't wanted
anything, hadn't asked her for any
thing. She walked over to the
street-light so that she could see the
money better. It was really money,
and the man had given it to her
without asking for it, without ex
pecting anything for it.
# * *
She stared at a blue-green streak
of oil in the street, thinking. There
were men like that -men that gave
you money because they wanted to
be kind, because they were sorry for
you. There must be other people like
that. too. Decent people, who were
kind and tried to shoot square. She
started walking. If there were de
cent people in the world, then you
didn't have to die to yet away from
the rotten ones. You could go on

living, maybe you could get to be
decent yourself after a while. She
walked faster, almost running. Wilh
people like that in the world she'd
get along, somehow. Just knowing
about them made things all right.
There was a coffee-stand on the
corner. She'd go in there and get
something to cat, then she'd decide
what she was going to do. She
thought: It was funny how the man
came along just in time to keep her
from walking out into the street and
letting the bus get her. It was almost
as though it had been fate, something
watching over her. Providence, that
was it.
:{c ijc *
In the lunch-stand she ordered
coffee and doughnuts. The coffee
made her warm and the doughnuts
felt good in the emptiness of her
stomach. When she had finished she
put the 50-cent piece on the counter.
The man tossed it into the register,
and started to reach for her change.
Then—"Wait a minute," he said
lie took the coin from the drawer
and dropped it on the counter. It
made a hollow sound. The girl knew
that sound: it meant that the money
was counterfeit. She stared at the
man for a moment, not seeing him
hut seeing thtv one who'd given her
the coin, the man she'd thought was
decent, kind. He'd thought it was a
joke to give her a piece of counter
feit money, a good gag. He was the
man that had made her think there
were decent people in the world.
Running, the girl left the store;
reached the middle of the street in
front. When the driver of the green
touring car saw her. just in front of
the wheels, he tried desperately to
stop his car. There was the frantic
screeching of wheels as he put on the
brakes. But the girl in the grey coat,
lying in a still heap tin the pavement,
did not hear.

By JEAN HICKS

r pHE GIRL in the gray coat stood ;
on the corner, staring at the other
side of the street. It was a long way
over there and it wouid be an effort
to cross and miss the cars that were
shooting by. Why did cars go so
fast? Why did everything move so
fast, all of the time? Wasn't anyone I
else ever tired?
Well, she didn't have to cross right
now. There was time, plenty of it.
She moved back from the corner and
leaned against the wall of a drug
store. It was better here, in the dark.
Funny, she hated lights. There were
so damned many of them, just like
the cars. Lights and noise and things
going fast used to be fun—
Like that time the boy that worked
in the lunch counter with her had
taken her to Coney Island. That had
been fun—the roller coaster, and all
those things they had ridden on. It
made her shudder now to think of
the screeching sound that the wheels
of the roller coaster had made. She
wondered what had happened to the

blame them. No one liked being
around a girl who had gone to seed.
That was what the old lady had said
when she'd put her out.
"You can't stay here," she'd said.
"You get out and make room for
some girl's got more life than you.
Bad enough having your looks shot,
but you ain't even got any pep."
Some of the others had come in
and begged for her to stay but the
old lady had cursed them and they'd
gone out. They were scared of her.
She was glad she wouldn't have to
listen to the old lady curse any more.
She was glad, too, that she wouldn't
see Steve again. He cursed her, too.
He'd been at it since she'd started
being short on money for him. He
didn't sec why she couldn't get it
from the men who came to her; he
wouldn't believe her when she told
him there weren't many who asked
for her any more.
She'd said: "Look, Steve, they
don't want me. I'm not pretty any
more."
But he hadn't listened, and he was
too drunk to see anyhow.
* >t> *
After she left the house she'd gone
to see him. He was lying on his bed
asleep. She'd shaken him a little, to
get him up, and he had sat up curs
ing. She'd been afraid, then, to tell
him about the old lady putting her
out, so she'd gone away and told him
she'd come back later with some
money. That had been yesterday, or
maybe the day before. She didn't re
member. It was a long time. It had
been a long time to walk; the police
men didn't want you to sit on the
benches in the park.
Those cars were still going by in
the street. They made an awful noise
when they stopped. She hoped the
one that got her wouldn't make a
scrccching sound. Not that she would
I hear it, but anyhow, it would be
| nicer if it stopped without making a
noise. If she went over the bridge

she'd be sure there wouldn't be
noise. Just a splash, but the water
would be so damned cold, and it was
a long walk there. It would be easier
here. She'd just walk out in front of
the busses.
# Sjc #
There was one coming several
blocks away—and it wasn't due to
stop until the corner after this one.
She moved away from the wall and
stood, waiting, close to the curb.
"You look hungry, sister."
She started a little and then looked
at the man standing beside her. He
put something in her hand and
walked on. She looked down at it.
It was money, a 50-cent piece. She
turned to look after him but he
didn't look back, just kept on walk
ing. The bus came by and she stared
'at its lights. Then she went back
and stood against the wall, rubbing
her hands across the 50-cent piece.
He'd just come up and handed it to
her, then walked away. He'd said:
"You look hungry."
"You look hungry, sister." That
was what he had said, and then given
her the money. He hadn't wanted
anything, hadn't asked her for any
thing. She walked over to the
street-light so that she could see the
money better. It was really money,
and the man had given it to her
without asking for it, without ex
pecting anything for it.
# * *
She stared at a blue-green streak
of oil in the street, thinking. There
were men like that -men that gave
you money because they wanted to
be kind, because they were sorry for
you. There must be other people like
that. too. Decent people, who were
kind and tried to shoot square. She
started walking. If there were de
cent people in the world, then you
didn't have to die to yet away from
the rotten ones. You could go on

living, maybe you could get to be
decent yourself after a while. She
walked faster, almost running. Wilh
people like that in the world she'd
get along, somehow. Just knowing
about them made things all right.
There was a coffee-stand on the
corner. She'd go in there and get
something to cat, then she'd decide
what she was going to do. She
thought: It was funny how the man
came along just in time to keep her
from walking out into the street and
letting the bus get her. It was almost
as though it had been fate, something
watching over her. Providence, that
was it.
:{c ijc *
In the lunch-stand she ordered
coffee and doughnuts. The coffee
made her warm and the doughnuts
felt good in the emptiness of her
stomach. When she had finished she
put the 50-cent piece on the counter.
The man tossed it into the register,
and started to reach for her change.
Then—"Wait a minute," he said
lie took the coin from the drawer
and dropped it on the counter. It
made a hollow sound. The girl knew
that sound: it meant that the money
was counterfeit. She stared at the
man for a moment, not seeing him
hut seeing thtv one who'd given her
the coin, the man she'd thought was
decent, kind. He'd thought it was a
joke to give her a piece of counter
feit money, a good gag. He was the
man that had made her think there
were decent people in the world.
Running, the girl left the store;
reached the middle of the street in
front. When the driver of the green
touring car saw her. just in front of
the wheels, he tried desperately to
stop his car. There was the frantic
screeching of wheels as he put on the
brakes. But the girl in the grey coat,
lying in a still heap tin the pavement,
did not hear.

By JEAN HICKS

r pHE GIRL in the gray coat stood ;
on the corner, staring at the other
side of the street. It was a long way
over there and it wouid be an effort
to cross and miss the cars that were
shooting by. Why did cars go so
fast? Why did everything move so
fast, all of the time? Wasn't anyone I
else ever tired?
Well, she didn't have to cross right
now. There was time, plenty of it.
She moved back from the corner and
leaned against the wall of a drug
store. It was better here, in the dark.
Funny, she hated lights. There were
so damned many of them, just like
the cars. Lights and noise and things
going fast used to be fun—
Like that time the boy that worked
in the lunch counter with her had
taken her to Coney Island. That had
been fun—the roller coaster, and all
those things they had ridden on. It
made her shudder now to think of
the screeching sound that the wheels
of the roller coaster had made. She
wondered what had happened to the
boy who had taken her there. He
was a nice boy. He'd liked her, not
the way the others had later, but like
a nice boy would like you. That was
a long time ago, before she'd met
Mac. After that, she'd gone by the
lunch counter one time to see the
boy but he hadn't wanted to talk to
her. He must have heard ab"out her
and Mac.
* * *
She wondered if he'd be sorry for
her if he saw her now. But prob
ably he wouldn't be. Men weren't

around a girl who had gone to seed.
