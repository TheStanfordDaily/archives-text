# The
						Big Game Gaieties

CTANFORD nearly smothered in
its exit from the Assembly Hall
Friday night, but it voted this year's
Big Game Gaieties tho best "since
tl y could remember." Signifying
t»e forthcoming abandonment ol' the
Assembly Hall, for the finale plaster
and props crashed, columns toppled,
spreading a thick white dust over
stagehands and audience.
The evening's best v/as Bob Mal
lett's impersonation of Franklin D.
Roosevelt. His "policy of the good
neighbor" and unctuous "my "Frien
—ds" brought cheers. Doodles Weav
er's "Nuts to Cal" was a close second
in applause. "I'm the Jolly-up Kid,"
a new song, he embellished with a
dance number executed with a fe
male dummy partner.
Magician Scores
One of the cleverest bits was "Pro
fessor" Walton Wickett's scholarly
dissertation on "The Kiss." Incred
ible was Ormond McGill. Labeled
"the guy what smokes cigarettes" on
the program, McGill proceeded to do
this, produced cigarette after cig
arette, lighted, from nowhere, drew a
cigar, finally a pipe from thin air.
What added immeasurably to this
Gaieties,was good music and the ab
sence of chorus. 'Mac Gordon's
"'Tain't Wrong" and "Picnic in the
Parlor," the Gordon and O'Neill
written "His Excellency" and "Book
of Verses," Bob Mallett's "Stanford
in Spring": all were good tunes with
clever lyrics.
Continuity Problem
The problem of achieving continu
ity in the hodge-podge of student
written material has always been a
difficult one for Gaieties producers.
This year it was met in about three
different ways. Bud Cady was a
drawling, informal master of cere
monies, and Phil Brown as Puck
darted out on the stage periodically
to recite elfish verses. Principal
theme was the delay of the New The
ater Project. With the first earth dug
by Columbus (Hal Kahn) in 1492, we

skip to 1776 when George Washing
ton continued with the spading. A
third interlude featuring Mr. Roose
velt's work on the project was skip
ped in the production. Or did I miss
something?
Institutions satirized in the Gaie
ties were professors, of course, the
Date Bureau, the Exchange Dinner,
8 o'clock classes, Stanford's steam
heating system, "The Winds of Free
dom." Even Tiny Thomhill and the
man with the Cord were not spared.

Students interested in smelling out
the longshoreman strike situation in
a San Francisco waterfront tour are
requested to sign up at the A.S.S.U.
offices today.
The trip will be tomorrow, under
A.S.U. auspices, starting from the
Women's Clubhouse at 1 p.m.. In
cluded in the itinerary are chats
with Harry Bridges and Harry Lund
berg of the I.L.A. and Lynn Fox of
the Employers' Association.
