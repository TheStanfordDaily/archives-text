# Cards Seek Revenge On Cal Poloists
## Varsity Game To Decide Coast Championship; Papooses Meet Cubs 
### GENE GEAR 
Revenge!
This word will be rippling over the
waters of Encina Pool this afternoon
at 3 o'clock when the Redskin water
polo team plunges in to avenge the
1-0 defeat suffered Saturday at the
hands of a smoothly functioning
California varsity.
Today's aquatic struggle between
the Bear and the Indian promises to
be paramount in the long history of
Stanford-California water polo se
ries.
The two teams, each with four con
ference wins and one defeat, will be
battling for the Pacific Coast confer
ence crown vacated this year by the
Bruins of U.C.LA.
Cards Favored
The Card amphibians went into
the Berkeley fray Saturday as slight
favorites but crumpled before the
amazing attack of the Cal "Wonder
Team," being eked out by a 1-0 mar
gin.
That score isn't indicative of the
difference between the two squads in
the first game, however. Nort
Thornton's Indians put up a hard and
tireless fight but were clearly out
classed by the greatest water polo
team in California history.
Captain Bobby Haslacher was sen
sational in the Indian net during the
entire game, making many breath
taking saves to keep the Card water
dogs in the running. Ben Voss,
steadiest player on the squad, was
outstanding in defensive work, stop
ping many Bear thrusts.
Frosh Play Prelim
Coach Jack Murrieta's undefeated
fiosh team, holding a 2—l victory
over the Bear Cubs, meets the first
year men from Berkeley in the pre
liminary at 3 p.m., the two varsities
tangling immediately afterwards.
The frosh game, if anything like
Saturday's Papoose-Cub battle, will
be a thriller in every sense of the
K '°V' Saturday's prelim was dead
locked at 1-1 for most of the game
until Dribbling Bob Savage, playing
a heads-up game, whistled in the
winning goal.
A1 Dowden's Bears will be favored
today, but the Indians paddling
around in their own water hole and
fired up with revenge for last year's
two defeats and the first one this
year, will be out for a win and the
conference championship. Both of the
coaches look for a score as close as
the last one.
Hanna at Sprint
Big Bill Hanna will start today at I
sprint for the Cards. The 205-pound
aquarian is the fastest sprint on the j
coast, taking all three dashes Satur
day from Captain Jim Lawrence of
the Bears. Lawrence was all-confer
ence forward last year and is headed
for top honors again.
Little Bob Hoover and John Lamb
will start at the wing forward spots.
Hoover played his usual outstanding
but Lamb, Stanford s scoring
ace, was held down so closely by the
roughing antics of Walt "Slugger"
Peterson, California guard, that he
was unable to break away for any
thing resembling a goal.
Chuck G'fien, Ben Voss, and Don
Peterson will be the starting guard j
irio assigned to depress the scoring
ideas of California forwards, Law
rence, Shields, and Wheeler.
Captain Haslacher will be in the
Redskin goal showing Cardinal fans j
a "by he has been acclaimed the I
st's outstanding goalie. Sharkey j
/raham, ace center back from Uncle |
am's Olympic Games team, will be j
ccn in action for the Bears.
