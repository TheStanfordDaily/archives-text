# Mallett Plans Central Lost, Found Bureau
## 
### JANET GOULD 
In this, his senior year at Stanford,
Bob Mallet, Ex Committee member,
lost a notebook and found an idea.
Because he had to traipse from the
lost and found bureau in the Ac
counting Office to the one in the
B.A.C. building, to the A.S.S.U. of

fices, to the library, to the Post Of
fice only to find his lost notebook in
the Women's Clubhouse, he evolved
the plan of establishing one large de
partment for all lost articles.
According to Mallet's plan, the lost
and found department would be lo
cated in the Union, in charge of a
secretary and all lost articles would
be turned in to it. This would do
away with at least four of the pres
ent bureaus and simplify finding of
lost articles. ,
"It's a good idea," Mallet says. "It
would increase the possibility of
finding the stufT we lose. Take my
case . . . never lost anything import
ant, that is, until this year. Now,
even if everyone else is as lucky as
that, it averages 1000 losses a year.
The point of it all is that it is too hard
on the departments and students to
have five or six lost and found bu
reaus.
"All we need to succeed is pub
licity, lots of it."
The Accounting Office, central bu
reau of the present system, has a
large drawer of the safe and several
small canvas bags filled with pens,
glasses, keys, notebooks, gloves, etc.,
which have been turned in. Four dif
ferent parts of the maintain a
local lost and found.
"It would be a great help to have
this bureau in one place" according
to Miss Moscovitz, University cash
ier. "Although we have had it here
for so long that it has become a part
of the office routine."
