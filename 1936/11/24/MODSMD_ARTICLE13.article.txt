# Juneau Hit By Landslide, Fire
## Trees, Mud Trap Many, Seven Known Missing 
### 
JUNEAU, Alaska, Nov. 23 (U.R).â€”
Fire started today in the ruins of
five houses, adding to the horror of
a landslide of tons of mud and trees
that roared down Mt. Roberts last
night, killing one woman, injuring
nine persons and possibly burying
unknown numbers.
Hope was abandoned for any per
sons who might have been caught by
the slide. Four persons were re
ported to have been standing in a
street as the slide pluged down the
side of the mountain, which over
looks the city. The spot was covered
with mud and trees piled 20 feet
high and 100 feet wide.
Firemen battled frantically to pre
vent fire from spreading. The flames
were deep in the debris and will
have to burn themselves out.
Rescuers who worked all night
were still unable to tell how many
persons might have been trapped by
the slide. Seven were known to be
missing.
A side of the mountain was ripped
out from several hundred feet above
the city.
The mass of earth plunged clear
to the water front, cutting the city
in two.
Mrs. Gus Erickson, wife of a la
borer, horribly crushed under a stove
in her home, was the only known
victim. Her husband, first reported
killed, was injured.
