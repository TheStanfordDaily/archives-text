# Gallery Features Bensco Portraits
## 
### 
Charles Bensco, Los Angeles artist,
whose collection of portrait oil paint
ings is being exhibited at the Stan
ford Art Gallery, will be on the
campus today inspecting his display.
Mr. Bensco is considered one of the
leading portraitists of the West.
According to Mr. Pedro de Lemos,
director of the Art Gallery, there are
few contemporary painters who can
so easily and confidently paint por
traits. As the display will continue
until December 8, there is plenty of
time for those who have not done so
to see it.
