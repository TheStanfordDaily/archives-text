# Encina Inmates Pay to Replace Ravaged Props
## 
### 
Repairs probably will start this
week, according to B. A. Gage, man
ager of men's dormitories, on the En
cina balustrades dismantled by the
frosh Tuesday night, when they were
getting clubs to repulse a reported
Cal raid on the bonfire.
Replacing the 122 missing banister
uprights will cost something over
$100, the amounts to be taken out of
the breakage fees of $10 eaoh, which
is paid by Encina inmates.
Square balustrades will be put in
instead of the old turned ones. They
are cheaper and somewhat harder to
break, says Mr. Gage, but it will still
be possible to knock them out.
Two years ago many of the balus
ters were broken out in a similar
quest for clubs, as shown by the long
stretches of square uprights to be
found among the regular turned
sticks.
