# Engineers Join Maritime Strike
## Masters, Mates, Pilots Also Enter Dispute 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 23 (UP).
â€”Leaders of two Pacific Coast mari
time unions representing the western
licensed personnel of the American
Merchant Marine tonight instructed
their members to join the strike
movement instituted on the Gulf and
the Atlantic Coast by the national or
ganizations of the Masters, Mates,
and Pilots Association and the Ma
rine Engineers Beneficial Associa
tion.
When the instructions have been
translated into definite action, ex
pected immediately, it will place the
mates and engineers strike on a na
tional basis, the first of the marine
labor disputes to become nationwide
in scope.
The move will not add to the num
ber of seaworkers already on strike
as the Pacific Coast masters, mates,
pilots, and engineers walked out in
a separate dispute October 29, but it
will add greatly ot the complications
involved in attempting to settle the
far-flung labor disputes and also
draw ferryboat workers of western
rivers and bays into the dispute.
