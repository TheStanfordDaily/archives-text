# Unemployment Insurance Upheld

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 (U.R).â€”
The Supreme Court, by virtue of an
evenly divided court, today affirmed
the decision of the New York State
Court of Appeals upholding state un- i
employment insurance legislation, j
The New York state act is generally
similar to state legislation required |
under the new Federal Social Sccu- j
rity Act.
The court was divided four to four, j
.Justice Harlan F. Stone being too ill
to participate in the decision. Be- |
cause of his liberal tendencies it was
believed almost certain that the law
will ultimately be upheld by a ma- ,
jority opinion if new cases are
brought before there is any change
in the present personnel of the court, j
