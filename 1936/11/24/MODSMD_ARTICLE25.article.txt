# Committee To Consider Theater War
## Daily Budget on Carpet Diplomacy Favored In Movie Prices Battle 
### 
Campaign to reduce the prices of
the Puly theaters and reduction of
the Daily's editorial budget will be
considered at the Ex Committee
meeting at 7:15 tonight in the Union.
Fraternities and men's halls favor
going after lower prices by petition,
diplomacy, and boycott if necessary,
according to the presidents of all liv
ing groups who met Sunday night
after ascertaining the opinions of
their groups on the subject. Possi
bilities of forming a Men's Confer
ence and what potential power such a
body would have on the campus was
also discussed at the meeting which
was headed by Bob Mallett.
Women Push Boycott
Women's Conference heartily en
dorsed the idea that the Ex Commit
tee Send representatives to confer
with the theater managers about
lower prices and free admission for
frosh on the night of the Pajamarino.
The representatives at the meeting
had taken polls of all women's living
groups before reaching their deci
sion.
Move to change the present system
of using 15 cents of the 75 cents paid
for a subscription to the Daily out
of the $15 committee fee for the
Daily editorial expenses will be
made tonight by Student Manager
Chuck Fontius. He favors a commit
tee consisting of the editor, the man
aging editor, the head of the journal
ism department, the business man
ager, and the student manager meet
ing at the beginning of every quar
ter to arrange a budget for the
Daily's editorial expense.
Price Raised
Sixty cents was originally the price
of the Daily subscription, but when
the paper was losing money during
the depression, it was raised to 75
cents. When profits started to come
in again the student manager re
quested that the 15 cents be taken
away from the Daily, but the Ex
Committee could find no other prac
tical use for the money and so it de
cided on the present special editorial
budget which allows $600 (the total
of the 15-cent fees) for editorial ex
penses including pictures and such
items.
It is said that Fontius believes the
present system encourages waste,
gives the editor unlimited spending
power ,and although the business
staff of the Daily may be losing
money the editorial staff can keep
on spending it. It is believed that
Fontius thinks that the Daily should
deduct its editorial expenses from the
60-eent fee he proposes rather than
from the present 75-cent fee. This
will not reduce student's community
fees, but the money will be diverted
into other, as yet unknown channels.
Daily Profits
The profits made by the Daily over
the $1800 they receive from the funds
go toward the reserve fund and the
building improvement fund. Under
the proposed system there would be
no money for these funds.
When approached by the repre
sentative of the Daily, Fontius would
make no statement other than that
he would support the measure before
the Ex Committee and would con
tinue to recommend it unless the
Committee dinged it.

quested that the 15 cents be taken
away from the Daily, but the Ex
Committee could find no other prac
tical use for the money and so it de
cided on the present special editorial
budget which allows $600 (the total
of the 15-cent fees) for editorial ex
penses including pictures and such
items.
It is said that Fontius believes the
present system encourages waste,
gives the editor unlimited spending
power ,and although the business
staff of the Daily may be losing
money the editorial staff can keep
on spending it. It is believed that
Fontius thinks that the Daily should
deduct its editorial expenses from the
60-eent fee he proposes rather than
from the present 75-cent fee. This
will not reduce student's community
fees, but the money will be diverted
into other, as yet unknown channels.
Daily Profits
The profits made by the Daily over
the $1800 they receive from the funds
go toward the reserve fund and the
building improvement fund. Under
the proposed system there would be
no money for these funds.
When approached by the repre
sentative of the Daily, Fontius would
make no statement other than that
he would support the measure before
the Ex Committee and would con
tinue to recommend it unless the
Committee dinged it.
Campaign to reduce the prices of
the Puly theaters and reduction of
the Daily's editorial budget will be
considered at the Ex Committee
meeting at 7:15 tonight in the Union.
Fraternities and men's halls favor
going after lower prices by petition,
diplomacy, and boycott if necessary,
according to the presidents of all liv
ing groups who met Sunday night
after ascertaining the opinions of
their groups on the subject. Possi
bilities of forming a Men's Confer
ence and what potential power such a
body would have on the campus was
also discussed at the meeting which
was headed by Bob Mallett.
Women Push Boycott
Women's Conference heartily en
dorsed the idea that the Ex Commit

with the theater managers about
lower prices and free admission for

Move to change the present system
of using 15 cents of the 75 cents paid
for a subscription to the Daily out
of the $15 committee fee for the
Daily editorial expenses will be
made tonight by Student Manager
Chuck Fontius. He favors a commit
tee consisting of the editor, the man
aging editor, the head of the journal
ism department, the business man
ager, and the student manager meet
ing at the beginning of every quar
ter to arrange a budget for the
Daily's editorial expense.
Price Raised
Sixty cents was originally the price
of the Daily subscription, but when
the paper was losing money during
the depression, it was raised to 75
cents. When profits started to come
in again the student manager re
quested that the 15 cents be taken
away from the Daily, but the Ex
Committee could find no other prac
tical use for the money and so it de
