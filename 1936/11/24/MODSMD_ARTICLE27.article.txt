# SOUR GRIPES
## THREE CHEERS FOR WHAT? 
### 
Sad Saturday was something of a
landmark in the history of football,
for on two occasions at least the
California team came out of the hud
dle and told their rooting section to
pipe down.
Our Stanford team did nothing of
the sort, which means that the head
yell leader can continue to lead yells
and pride himself on the funny idea
that whatever success the team has
is due to how well he whips the
stands into a lather of organized fury.
In short, Web Jones is still an in
tegral part of the team organization,
something like a rally committee
nan or a sophomore manager who
iiicks up dirty towels after the ath
letes in the shower room.

It would take an athlete to en-,
lighten me on this point, but after
/atching the California team's ap
reciation of the yowling mob in the
■ ands, I wonder if yelling is not
j ist an annoyance as far as the play
ers are concerned, and that sooner
or later the experienced player
h arns to endure it as a necessary
evil.
I cannot imagine any football
player digging in any harder with
iii; back to the goal posts just be
e; use a bunch of kids in comfort and
si. "ety are advising him how to hold
t! ;t line. Or a line charging any
filter because a crowd is pointing
to yard the goal line and screaming
11•.• t most half-witted of all yells,
"Go! Go!" And when the blood-
In igry stands cry, "We want a
t > chdown," there must be more
th n one player who feels like Shout
in "For God's sake shut up —what
do you think we are out here play
in • for, anyway?"
' he player who comes off the field
un er somebody else's power or the
m; n who staggers off under his own
j;o\/er conspicuously covered with
wc 1 earned glory, must rarely notice
wh it the rooting section does. And
a;-: for the ordinary player who is
jus merely yanked, the perfunctory
m; iner in which the stands cheer
for him must make him wonder if
they aren't yelling just because a yell
k: ler tells them to.

r i here is, I admit, no fun in getting
up and screaming, "Come on youse
gu; s" because you know nobody
p.i.vs the least attention to your in
effectual chirpings. For this rea
so: , yelling the same thing altogether
is .un because it gives everybody a
feeling of great vocal power, and
there is a certain joy in manipulating
the cards between the halves. But
ai'l'-r the first quarter, the first burst

of enthusiasm has worn off nearly
everybody and a whole lot of people
feel like sitting down and shutting
up while the yell leader jumps up on
any occasion every 18'2 seconds.
