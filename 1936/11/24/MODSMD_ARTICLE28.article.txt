# Theater Heads To Consider Drama School
## Bassett Heads Committee; Theater Is Scheduled For Completion in April 
### 
With date for the completion of the
new Memorial Theater set for some
time in April, definite selection of a
special drama committee headed by
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett will be
made after Thanksgiving. This com
mittee will draw up plans for the
School of the Theater.
According to Dramatic Director
Gordon C. Lange, a dramatic depart
ment should be built up of the sort j
which will prepare and send away
students with wide experience in all
aspects of play production. The ex
tensive equipment which will be
available with the completion of the
theater should make this aim pos
sible.
Since this equipment will serve for
any kind of work, thereby differing
from commercial projects, varied
training calling for ingenuity on the
part of students should be given,
Mr. Lange believes, in order to pre
vent their being spoiled by these
superior facilities.
He claims that students should also
be given opportunity for experience
and training of a practical nature in
both present-day plays and histori
cal productions important as drama
produced from an entertainment
point of view.
It will also be the responsibility of
the theater to produce experimental
plays, thereby giving students oppor
tunity for creative work, Mr. Lange
claims.
In an attempt to raise the standard
of audience criticism, an effort will
be made to put the responsibility of
the plays on the audience by giving
small productions and inviting cer
tain people to attend, with
vision that they write a criticism of
the work following the performance.
The difficulty with this scheme, ac
cording to Mr. Lange, is that the
audiences tend to criticize the au
thor rather than the performance
itself. However, he believes that
people coming under such a condi
tion tend to be more critical than
those who must pay at the box offke
before attending.
