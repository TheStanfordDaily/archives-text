# Game Night Fog Causes Crash
## Roads Fork, Rough Takes Middle Course 
### 
Enmeshed in the brush at the head
of Palm Drive lay Sergius Bryner's
carâ€”the conclusion of the only auto
mobile accident, in spite of the heavy
fog, to befall a Farm student on Big
Game night.
Anxious to gel back to the campus
to avoid a lock-out, Bryner evi
dently did not see that the drive
forks as it approaches the campus.
He kept going straight ahead,
ploughing into the shrubbery.
It appears that his date fortu
| nately had an AAA card, so he was
| able to get a towing car from Palo
i Alto to pull him out, A helpful stu
| dent drove him to the dormitory, it
| was reported, but he was not quifk
; enough to avoid the lockout.
