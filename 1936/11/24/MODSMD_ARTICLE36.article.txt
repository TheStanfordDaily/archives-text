## WHAT HAPPENED? 
### 
Now that the sound and the fury
have begun to subside, let us collect J
our thoughts and analyze the thing, j
How come Stanford lost, and why by
so much?
Much easier is it to explain away 1
the Big Game than why California
looked so sloppy against U.C.L.A., j
Washington, and St. Mary's. At the
beginning of the season, Cal was set :
up; eight regulars or semi-regulars 1
were returning, and the Bears were
touted to go places this year, along I
with Jimmy Phelan's Huskier.
In August Stanford's cause looked
hopeless, and 20-0 would have stood |
in any company as a good Big Game j
prediction. But since then California j
sluffed a few, and Tiny Thornhill
gradually molded a football team out
of his hopeless material, so the odds j
came back near even money.
And in spite of anything you read
and hear, the psychology was wrong,
from the Stanford angle. The entire
California campus was whipped into
a frenzy of desire to win this one,
by: (1) Not having won a Big Game
for a long time; (2) Efforts of en
thusiasm mongers; and (3) Painting
the "C" red and its after effects. No
people I know of can carry a state of
mind to a further extreme than can
football players.
Stanford, on the other hand, pulled
a butch over a year ago in schedul
ing Columbia one week after. Grant
ed that the kids are entitled to an
eastern trip ,and that finals are in a
bad position here, however, there was
considerably too much talk about
"what a swell trip we'll have back
there" on the practice field, at train- I
ing table, and around.
Other feelings percolating vyere |
that we owe Columbia a good belt— j
they got a lot of magazine and news- j
paper publicity and prestige from'
their Rose Bowl win over us in 1934,1
while Cal, shucks, they're good guys
over there, and they haven't won for 1
four years. . . .

four years. . . .
Now that the sound and the fury
have begun to subside, let us collect J
our thoughts and analyze the thing, j
How come Stanford lost, and why by
so much?
Much easier is it to explain away 1
the Big Game than why California
looked so sloppy against U.C.L.A., j
Washington, and St. Mary's. At the
beginning of the season, Cal was set :
up; eight regulars or semi-regulars 1
were returning, and the Bears were
touted to go places this year, along I
with Jimmy Phelan's Huskier.
In August Stanford's cause looked
hopeless, and 20-0 would have stood |
in any company as a good Big Game j
prediction. But since then California j
sluffed a few, and Tiny Thornhill
gradually molded a football team out
of his hopeless material, so the odds j
came back near even money.
And in spite of anything you read
and hear, the psychology was wrong,
from the Stanford angle. The entire
California campus was whipped into
a frenzy of desire to win this one,
by: (1) Not having won a Big Game
for a long time; (2) Efforts of en
thusiasm mongers; and (3) Painting
the "C" red and its after effects. No
people I know of can carry a state of
mind to a further extreme than can
football players.
Stanford, on the other hand, pulled
a butch over a year ago in schedul
ing Columbia one week after. Grant
ed that the kids are entitled to an
eastern trip ,and that finals are in a
bad position here, however, there was
considerably too much talk about
"what a swell trip we'll have back
there" on the practice field, at train- I
ing table, and around.
Other feelings percolating vyere |
that we owe Columbia a good belt— j
they got a lot of magazine and news- j
paper publicity and prestige from'
their Rose Bowl win over us in 1934,1
while Cal, shucks, they're good guys
over there, and they haven't won for 1
four years. . . .
