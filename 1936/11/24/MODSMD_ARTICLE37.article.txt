# AND WHY?

### 
Why Maw Hoos didn't go a little I
more radical on his calling is not a j
point for criticism; a radical team
when things are going wrong looks j
horrible, and maybe Hoos was led to
believe that his callings were what
made it that way. Then, too, Vigna t
is more radical than Hoos ,and he
likely was conservative Saturday.
Stanford might have looked that way
in any game this year, with a little
hard luck.
And why they saved those new
plays comes next. Last week they
were working on a "Zagar eligible,"
where Pete and Cab changed places.
Stone dropped back .and Coffis came
up on the line. There were several
maneuvers off of the formation to '
screen it, but the principal one was a !
pass Zagar that looked like a killer. |
Stanfov 1 sat in the formation only
once, in the second quarter when
Calvelli ran off tackle. Tiny had said j
Thursday the formation was a defi- j
nite part of the strategy for Satur- j
day.
Another new one was a "C- '
spread," with the fullback passer way
over on the right, to get a lateral J
before shooting a deep pass. I sat
next to Winkelman upstairs, and al
though he telephoned down for this
set several times, it never was used.
To summarize. Tiny has three ends,
two tackles, four guards, one center,
Iwo quarterbacks, three halfbacks,
and three fullbacks yn his team,
when abilities and "saving for next
year" are considered. Considering ;
what they had done in other games !
1 his year, it is difficult to discern I
just what some of them were think- |
ing about.
