Deserving special mention are
CofTis, who was splendid all after
noon in spite of that heart-breaker
on the first Cal touchdown . . . Cal
velli, quick thinker par excellence
when he was rushed on a third down
punt, simply dodged and passed it
down the field. Tsoutsouvas, who
played his seventh straight 60-min
ute game . . . Jake Brigham and
Leo Ferko. who are swell ball play
ers, even if they aren't much publi
cized . . . the Cal rooters, who were
very well behaved, considering . . .
the California football team, which
played the finest ball we've seen this
year . . . the Stanford football team,
which didn't fold up even after the
last gun.
And even San Dingo State, the old
alma mater, rose up and ruined Santa
Barbara State, which with Santa
Clara was the only undefeated squad
on the Coast, by the weird tune of
«)-K.
