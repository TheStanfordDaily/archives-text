# Basket Squad Defeats Aggies In Opening Tilt
## Varsity Clicks as Zonne, Luisetti, Calderwood Shine on New Roster 
### 
Just a little eager in the first start
of the season against outside compe
tition, Stanford's varsity baskotball
ers really went to work on the Cali
fornia Aggies a few times in the Pa
vilion last night and mauled the 1
Farmer Boys, 42-1(5.
Hank Luisetti and Jack Calder
wood were brilliant, in their way, but
Phil Zonne, up from last year's frosh
with a rather imposing scoring rec
ord, had quite a way with him, too,
in his first varsity start. Not only
that, another new gentleman, Joe
Ashcraft by name, enjoyed himself
for most of the evening while Coach
John Bunn looked, only he had to go
out late in the game with four per
sonal fouls.
Luisetti and Calderwood led the
scoring with eight points apiece,
Caldy scoring on four field goals and
Ambling Angelo coupling two foul
throws with three field goals. There
were others, too, of the conference
champions, Stoefen, Turner, H. B.
Lee. Robertson Bob Zonne who had
large fingers in the casaba pie but
they are the tried and true boys. It
was the new fellows like Phil Zonne,
Ashcraft, Dick Lyon, Jack Kes
sel, Lyman Calkins, Bill Rapp. and
others who are all new to the varsity
that had to do something last night,
and who all showed something.
Phil Zonne, scoring three points on
foul throws, circulated around with
enough speed, power, and ball
handling ability to make it look as 1
though he will play much basketball
in the conference this season. Much
bigger than his brother Bob, he is a
smooth as glass in his floorwork.
Depletion of the game range in
Yellowstone National Park due to
drought will bring about the reduc
tion of the northern elk herd by 4/JOO
in the near future. The greatest
number will be killed by hunters in
nearby preserves, while the rest will
be shipped to zoos, city and state
parks for display or restocking pur
poses.
