Yesterday's only playoff intramu
ral game saw Delta Chi and Phi Delt
battle to a 13-13 tie. only to be
broken in overtime when Dey passed
to Dillon for a 17-yard gain and the
victory. The result, however, hinges
on eligibility of Phi Delt players,
which has been protested and will be
decided by the Intramural Commit
tee.
Teams are warned, due to early
darkness, to appear when required

time under penalty of forfeit.
