# Tough Game Awaits Gridders at Columdia
## 
### BY BOB IRELAND 
It looks like the Stanford dele
' gation in for a <ough afternoon in
New York this Saturday.
The Indians and the Columbians
are foregathering for a lew brief
hours of mutual mayhem on the
greensward of the Yankee Stadium
this week-end to resume an argu
j ment started on a wet afternoon in
Pasadena three years ago come Jan
uary first. The Rose Bowl may be
out of the picture for both teams this
year, but only a pessimist would
j maintain that the renewal of this
l'eud would result in anything but a
| whale of a ball game.
On the record, Stanford would ap
| pear to be a 3-1 favorite. Columbia
j has been piacticing the art of losing
j gracefully this year, to a consider
able extent. True, the boys did man
age to eke out a 34-0 victory over
j that athletic powerhouse represent
ing the University of Maine. This
j must have upset the lads on Morn
-1 ingside Heights considerably, as they
| became perfect hosts to a reasonably
j strong Army team, losing by a score
I of 27-16. Another smashing victory
over V.M.I, was followed by a 13-0
defeat at the hands of an aggrega
tion from Michigan who were anni
hilated by Penn the following week
end.
At this point the Columbians
bucked up a bit, beating their old
j rivals from Cornell 20-13, and los
ing by the same margin to a power
/

ful Dartmouth team. Syracuse and I
Brown were then taken into camp, !
but as neither outfit has won an im- I
portant game all year, the prestige I
that accrued to the Blue and White
from these triumphs was far from J
overwhelming.
To begin with, with a single ex- i
ceplion, the Stanford starting line- '
up outclasses the Columbia team. On j
the other hand, their subs are more 1
experienced and of considerably bet- j
ter quality than ours. The Cardinal
line is a mile ahead of Little's, but |
they have three backs who can out- ]
punt any man on our squad. Stan- j
ford will have the best running back j
on the field in Jimmy Coffis, the best i
passer in Tony Calvelli, and the |
best blocker in Earl Hoos.
The Columbia line i.s much bigger 1
than ever before, but Stanford's is
heavier. Two big ends, Radvillas}
and Siegal, will start, with Schulze,
who can place-kick as well as Doc
Luckett, in reserve.

j gracefully this year, to a consider
able extent. True, the boys did man
age to eke out a 34-0 victory over
j that athletic powerhouse represent
ing the University of Maine. This
j must have upset the lads on Morn
-1 ingside Heights considerably, as they
| became perfect hosts to a reasonably
j strong Army team, losing by a score
I of 27-16. Another smashing victory
over V.M.I, was followed by a 13-0
defeat at the hands of an aggrega
tion from Michigan who were anni
hilated by Penn the following week
end.
At this point the Columbians
bucked up a bit, beating their old
j rivals from Cornell 20-13, and los
ing by the same margin to a power
/

ful Dartmouth team. Syracuse and I
Brown were then taken into camp, !
but as neither outfit has won an im- I
portant game all year, the prestige I
that accrued to the Blue and White
from these triumphs was far from J
overwhelming.
To begin with, with a single ex- i
ceplion, the Stanford starting line- '
up outclasses the Columbia team. On j
the other hand, their subs are more 1
experienced and of considerably bet- j
ter quality than ours. The Cardinal
line is a mile ahead of Little's, but |
they have three backs who can out- ]
punt any man on our squad. Stan- j
ford will have the best running back j
on the field in Jimmy Coffis, the best i
passer in Tony Calvelli, and the |
best blocker in Earl Hoos.
The Columbia line i.s much bigger 1
than ever before, but Stanford's is
heavier. Two big ends, Radvillas}
and Siegal, will start, with Schulze,
who can place-kick as well as Doc
Luckett, in reserve.
It looks like the Stanford dele
' gation in for a <ough afternoon in
New York this Saturday.
The Indians and the Columbians
are foregathering for a lew brief
hours of mutual mayhem on the
greensward of the Yankee Stadium
this week-end to resume an argu
j ment started on a wet afternoon in
Pasadena three years ago come Jan
uary first. The Rose Bowl may be
out of the picture for both teams this
year, but only a pessimist would
j maintain that the renewal of this
l'eud would result in anything but a
| whale of a ball game.
On the record, Stanford would ap
| pear to be a 3-1 favorite. Columbia
