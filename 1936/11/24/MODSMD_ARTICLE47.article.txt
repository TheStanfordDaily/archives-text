# Bring Back the Books
## 
### 
In the height of a studying fit, many students
shove out their call slips toward the Library
book clerks only to find that the one and only
volume the Library has, and from the student's
viewpoint the one and only volume in the Libe
worth anything, suddenly has disappeared.
The assumption is that students have walked
off with the missing volumes and forgotten to
charge them, and then have hesitated to bring
them back.
To recover some of these lost, strayed, or
stolen volumes Library Director Nathan Van
Patten has selected the A.S.S.U. offices as a
central spot for the receiving of these books.
The A.S.S.U. office in its usual efficient man
ner will turn the books over to the Library,
without so much as a flicker of the eyebrow.
Doubtless there are many of these books
hanging around living quarters. It is important
that students ferret out these forlorn tomes and
return them to their proper place.
It is to the students' own interest that this
movement be given the bandwagon treatment.
