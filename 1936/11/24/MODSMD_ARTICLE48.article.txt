# Good Mag, Gist

### 
Now that the week-end is over, and the room
can settle down to a dog-trot, it seems both fit
ting and proper to hand a palm to that Gist guy
for turning out a funny magazine in his Big
Game number out last week.
Too many schools have humor magazines
but not nearly enough have funny magazines.
And Chaparral, doddering as it is with tradi
tion, and overrun with ivy and moss, turns out
a tremendous thing pretty consistently these
days.
The Gistian drawings and the Gistian layouts
hit the eye, while the written matter, in cus
tomary Chappie style, is masculine, terse, and
even laughable at times.
We can't understand, even though we greatly
appreciate, the sudden enlightenment of Chap
pie editors exhibited by the Gist guy in admit
ting that maybe The Daily is editorially right
once in a while.
