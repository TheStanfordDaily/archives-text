Coming up before Ex Committee tonight is
the Charles G. Fontius plan for eliminating graft
on The Daily.
Genesis of the plan came when Mr. Fontius
heard Editor Brownie last spring saying that he
was having a hard time spending his cut budget.
Now that winter has come and spring is
not far behind, the student manager figures that
this is a good time to cut down on The Daily's
expenditure for pictures and cartoons in the
paper. With a new $500 Daily darkroom, how
ever, and good photographers, The Daily finds
itself guite capable of spending the money.
The student manager explains that his plan
is not solely for cutting down expenditures,
though, but to increase efficiency, and to pro
vide a means of protecting The Daily when it
goes in a hole, but although the plan is very
good and very neat, he hasn't been able to
explain to us yet how it does all this.
