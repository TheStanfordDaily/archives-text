# The 						Cardinal Is Waving But Not Damned
## 
### 
Though it might be considered bad taste for
Ihe Stanford Band and the rooters to break out
into "The Cardinal Is Waving" while a Cal
player was lying unconscious on the turf in
front of them, Stanford rooters behaved in the
Big Game with circumspection worthy of that
much maligned individual: the Stanford gen-
Ueman.
Web Jones, now en route B.A.C. freight pre
paid to Columbia, and his two vying assistants
deserve credit for keeping the section in hand
throughout the game, even up to the last de
spairing moment. Whether or not Jones was
responsible for getting Dick Bogue, Stanford
tackle of five years ago, to talk before the root
ing section during the fourth guarter, it was
a fine idea, particularly the tribute to Murray
Cuddeback, former Stanford star and assistant
coach until his death this year.
Although Jones and his yellers do not per
form back-flips or cart wheels as the Wash
ington yell-leader does, we are inclined to like
ihe fairly conservative Stanford school of yell
leading as exemplified by the local talent this
football season. Somehow it seems to me that
if Stanford students eat Wheaties, they should
keep it to themselves.
The altitude of the rooters during the presen
tation of the Axe to the raving Cal rooters was
not at all bad. The bantering back and forth
between the groups did not have the sour flavor
that followed the Big Game in the Berkeley
stadium two years ago. The words of the dis
tasteful "Cardinals Be Damned" died on Cali
fornia lips, where they had hung ever since the
rally in Edwards Gym Thursday night.

The quick action of the Cal yell leaders, co
operating with Jones and his boys, kept the
seething mass of California rooters on the turf
and out of the Stanford stands.
Whether the extra two hours' marching prac
tice that the band netted by refusing to appear
at the Oregon State station rally was in evi
ednce during the half is hard to decide. The
two bands worked together fairly well, alternat
ing as far as possible their playing during times
out and between quarters.
Of course, it is not particularly the band's
fault that the rooting section seems to have no
apparent sense of rhythm or beat when it comes
to singing and clapping in time to the musical
outbursts. But perhaps some of it is due to the
fact that only a few of the rooters can actually
hear the band once it gets under way. At least
the combination of the fact that 40-year-old
members of the rooting section did not know the
words to the hymn, and those who did know the
verse could not hear the tune, may have had
something to do with the terrific singing botch
that preceded the presentation of the Axe.

The Daily's intra-staff mudslinging will hold
forth again this afternoon at 1:15. Revelations
of no more astounding import than usual will
be revealed, and you know what that means.
But the managing editor is threatening to trot
out her style-sheet ex.
Though it might be considered bad taste for
Ihe Stanford Band and the rooters to break out
into "The Cardinal Is Waving" while a Cal
player was lying unconscious on the turf in
front of them, Stanford rooters behaved in the
Big Game with circumspection worthy of that
much maligned individual: the Stanford gen-
Ueman.
Web Jones, now en route B.A.C. freight pre
paid to Columbia, and his two vying assistants
deserve credit for keeping the section in hand
throughout the game, even up to the last de
spairing moment. Whether or not Jones was
responsible for getting Dick Bogue, Stanford
tackle of five years ago, to talk before the root
ing section during the fourth guarter, it was
a fine idea, particularly the tribute to Murray
Cuddeback, former Stanford star and assistant
coach until his death this year.
Although Jones and his yellers do not per
form back-flips or cart wheels as the Wash
ington yell-leader does, we are inclined to like
ihe fairly conservative Stanford school of yell
leading as exemplified by the local talent this
football season. Somehow it seems to me that
if Stanford students eat Wheaties, they should
keep it to themselves.
The altitude of the rooters during the presen
tation of the Axe to the raving Cal rooters was
not at all bad. The bantering back and forth
between the groups did not have the sour flavor
that followed the Big Game in the Berkeley
stadium two years ago. The words of the dis
tasteful "Cardinals Be Damned" died on Cali
fornia lips, where they had hung ever since the
rally in Edwards Gym Thursday night.

The quick action of the Cal yell leaders, co
operating with Jones and his boys, kept the
seething mass of California rooters on the turf
and out of the Stanford stands.
Whether the extra two hours' marching prac
tice that the band netted by refusing to appear
at the Oregon State station rally was in evi
ednce during the half is hard to decide. The
two bands worked together fairly well, alternat
ing as far as possible their playing during times
out and between quarters.
Of course, it is not particularly the band's
fault that the rooting section seems to have no
apparent sense of rhythm or beat when it comes
to singing and clapping in time to the musical
outbursts. But perhaps some of it is due to the
fact that only a few of the rooters can actually
hear the band once it gets under way. At least
the combination of the fact that 40-year-old
members of the rooting section did not know the
words to the hymn, and those who did know the
verse could not hear the tune, may have had
something to do with the terrific singing botch
that preceded the presentation of the Axe.
