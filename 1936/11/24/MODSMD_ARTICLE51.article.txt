# BULL SESSION
## STANFORD'S THANKSGIVING BOID 
### 
The November bird is the turkey. But at Stanford,
(he November bird is the Bronxy. It is not corporeal,
but aural; it is not a feathered entity, but an attitude.
And never did collective Stanford more enjoy its
own bird than after the Gaieties. Following three hours
of helluva time, people who paid re-adjusted their
laugh-tortured intestines to proclaim, "Yeh, the Gaie
ties were pretty good in spots."
Others, given to more exquisite detection, took
pains to point out that the show was poorly slung to
gether; that only three skits were really good; that the
Gaieties gave them so much genuine enjoyment merely
by an accidental juxtaposition of the Big Game, the
girl friend and a Stanford audience.
* * * >ii
Which, if we may say so, indicates a poisonous hy
pocrisy that not even George Jean Nathan would own
to.
Personally, we think the Gaieties were swell. And
we say so without qualification—purely because we had
a terrific time watching them. Our enjoyment cannot
be mitigated by critical post mortems. We strongly be
lieve such criticism to be cheap pyrotechnics, not worth
the powder to blow them.
* >!< * *
They indicate nothing but supreme ignorance of
what entertainment is for. Call it lowly indiscrimina
tion, we like to go to a show and simply abandon our
selves to it. If the show is lousy, we make ourselves
enjoy it. If the show is good, we are simply prostrated
with the joy of being amused . Which is perhaps why
we thought the Gaietifcs were grand, worth $1.25 plus
tax.
We're going to try to be very careful that collcge
does not remove this vestige of infantilism.
We make it a solemn promise—which automatically
bars the doors to the dramatic critic's office as it earns
the contempt of those more sophisticated in the world
of organized make-believe. It is an unfortunate quirk,
for we shall have to make public nuisances of ourselves
applauding absolutely lousy performances of the Fed
eral Theater, "Finlandia" and "Faust."
We shall continue to contract intellectual epilepsy
over Dore's rococo Infernos.
And we shall continue to like the Gaieties.

we thought the Gaietifcs were grand, worth $1.25 plus
tax.
We're going to try to be very careful that collcge
does not remove this vestige of infantilism.
We make it a solemn promise—which automatically
bars the doors to the dramatic critic's office as it earns
the contempt of those more sophisticated in the world
of organized make-believe. It is an unfortunate quirk,
for we shall have to make public nuisances of ourselves
applauding absolutely lousy performances of the Fed
eral Theater, "Finlandia" and "Faust."
We shall continue to contract intellectual epilepsy
over Dore's rococo Infernos.
And we shall continue to like the Gaieties.

The November bird is the turkey. But at Stanford,
(he November bird is the Bronxy. It is not corporeal,
but aural; it is not a feathered entity, but an attitude.
And never did collective Stanford more enjoy its
own bird than after the Gaieties. Following three hours
of helluva time, people who paid re-adjusted their
laugh-tortured intestines to proclaim, "Yeh, the Gaie
ties were pretty good in spots."
Others, given to more exquisite detection, took
pains to point out that the show was poorly slung to
gether; that only three skits were really good; that the
Gaieties gave them so much genuine enjoyment merely
by an accidental juxtaposition of the Big Game, the
girl friend and a Stanford audience.

Which, if we may say so, indicates a poisonous hy
pocrisy that not even George Jean Nathan would own
to.
Personally, we think the Gaieties were swell. And
we say so without qualification—purely because we had
a terrific time watching them. Our enjoyment cannot
be mitigated by critical post mortems. We strongly be
lieve such criticism to be cheap pyrotechnics, not worth
the powder to blow them.

They indicate nothing but supreme ignorance of
what entertainment is for. Call it lowly indiscrimina
tion, we like to go to a show and simply abandon our
selves to it. If the show is lousy, we make ourselves
enjoy it. If the show is good, we are simply prostrated
with the joy of being amused . Which is perhaps why
we thought the Gaietifcs were grand, worth $1.25 plus
tax.
