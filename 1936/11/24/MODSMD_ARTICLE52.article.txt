# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
That 20-0 mirage in the California Memorial Mauso
leum Saturday was funny. Cal didn't seem to see any
thing humorous, but Stanford students gagged every
time they thought about it .
The timorous souls who thought the rooting sections
were going to have a laugh riot without laughs at the
end of the game were disappointed. Although the Cal
stands emitted nothing but a continuous belch all after
noon, the fear of the Cal president that his rooting sec
tion would come over and tear the Stanford section up
by the rooters was unfounded. According to advices
from the Berkeley region the fact that Stanford lost so
graciously and so spectacularly cooled oil the Berkeley
ites. The team, therefore, should get entire credit for
losing the game so well.
The team regretted it had only 241 chances to lay
down its life for the university.
Cal thought Stanford was putting on disappearing
card tricks. Our Hasher sequestered himself in the Cal
rooting section and got a rapid-fire conversational re
port of what Ihe Cal boys thought of the Stanford
stunts. Since Cal politely gave Stanford the shady side,
the Stanford students were cloaked in a polite but
almost impenetrable haze. Squinting into the sun and
shuttling their own cards, Cal students had time to say
this about Stanford's tricks:
"Whazzat? It looks like a bird, no, its's a bear."
"It looks as if it's got athlete's foot, hah, hah, hah."
"Why doesn't that dummy up there turn his card
over. For gricst sakes get off my neck."
"Whazzat, Joe? It looks like a bear, no it's a bird."
"It's an Axe, you dope."
"Whazzat say ,Joe?"
"How sh'd I know. Something about scallops, I
think."
"You're not supposed to eat 'em in any month with
an V in it."
"Hey, look, they're standing up. Pretty clever. Why
don't our boys get some new ideas?"
"Whazzat say, Joe? It don't look like no bear or
bird to me."
"Poor Scallops, it says."
"Yeh. I guess that's right, this is November, ain't it?"
"Haz ANYbuddy got a match?"
An El Campo reports that as he was entering the
stadium lie bumped into a gentleman a little the worse
for tear. The gentleman, with his lee rail awash, seemed
to he taking the great circle route in leaving the Memo
rial Bowl, but always ending lip in the same place, his
back toward the stadium, his face toward the setting
sun. Said the gentleman: 'I big pardunnn, shir; but I've
bin wandurring atoound all afternoon and I can hear
ull the noizh, but 1 can't fin de daaaaahm game."

"You're not supposed to eat 'em in any month with
an V in it."
"Hey, look, they're standing up. Pretty clever. Why
don't our boys get some new ideas?"
"Whazzat say, Joe? It don't look like no bear or

An El Campo reports that as he was entering the
stadium lie bumped into a gentleman a little the worse
for tear. The gentleman, with his lee rail awash, seemed
to he taking the great circle route in leaving the Memo
rial Bowl, but always ending lip in the same place, his
back toward the stadium, his face toward the setting
sun. Said the gentleman: 'I big pardunnn, shir; but I've
bin wandurring atoound all afternoon and I can hear

That 20-0 mirage in the California Memorial Mauso
leum Saturday was funny. Cal didn't seem to see any
thing humorous, but Stanford students gagged every
time they thought about it .
The timorous souls who thought the rooting sections
were going to have a laugh riot without laughs at the
end of the game were disappointed. Although the Cal
stands emitted nothing but a continuous belch all after
noon, the fear of the Cal president that his rooting sec
tion would come over and tear the Stanford section up
by the rooters was unfounded. According to advices
from the Berkeley region the fact that Stanford lost so
graciously and so spectacularly cooled oil the Berkeley
ites. The team, therefore, should get entire credit for
losing the game so well.
The team regretted it had only 241 chances to lay
down its life for the university.
Cal thought Stanford was putting on disappearing
card tricks. Our Hasher sequestered himself in the Cal
rooting section and got a rapid-fire conversational re
port of what Ihe Cal boys thought of the Stanford
stunts. Since Cal politely gave Stanford the shady side,
the Stanford students were cloaked in a polite but
almost impenetrable haze. Squinting into the sun and
shuttling their own cards, Cal students had time to say
this about Stanford's tricks:
"Whazzat? It looks like a bird, no, its's a bear."
"It looks as if it's got athlete's foot, hah, hah, hah."
"Why doesn't that dummy up there turn his card
over. For gricst sakes get off my neck."
"Whazzat, Joe? It looks like a bear, no it's a bird."
"It's an Axe, you dope."
"Whazzat say ,Joe?"
"How sh'd I know. Something about scallops, I
think."
