The Editor, Sir:
Open Letter to Encina Inmate: So
you think History of Western Civ is
bad! Boy, just wait until next year,
when you'll have to yawn through
three more quarters of the very same
guff, this time disguised under the
appetizing name of Social Problems!
We are forced to take all these silly
courses; we learn nothing in them.
The students who read the editorials
in the daily papers get A's — those
who don't get C's, D's, and F's. Why
should you like politics? It's un
pardonable sin not to like politics in
this country, and all who don't are
righteously punished.
Greece and Rome take up the first
two weeks in any orientation course,
but rapidly such words as "log-roll
ing, gerrymandering, pork-barrel,
etc., pour out of young blue-jowled
instructors with a rash and unblush
ing fluency, and — presto! We no
longer study History of Western Civ
ilization but rather the lack of civ
ilization in U.S. politics—positively
palpitating!
Of course I know—you don't come
to college to learn anything, I've been
told. You really come to learn to
learn. You want a capacity for learn
ing, that's what. And the capacity
you acquire is so overwhelming it
stifles all ambition, and you're fully
aware of it, so that you haven't a
chance of becoming a self-respecting
tramp. Then you jump off a balcony,
or hop in a car and miss a bridge.
Away with Lower Division Re
quirements! or at least make them all
gradeless courses, with attendance
the only requisite for credit. Let's be
fair.
The old system of departmental
requirements was far, far better.
Everyone's ignorance was appalling,
of course, but everyone was happy.
Americans, if it is efficiency you
seek, let's be efficient by not being
impractical.
