The Editor, Sir:
In Thursday's issue of The Stan
ford Daily a "Junior Transfer"
writes a letter concerning the Char
lotte Ashley Felton Memorial Li
brary which reveals an almost com
plete misunderstanding of its history,
nature, and purposes.
This library was established by
Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins as a memo
rial to her mother. It was intended
only as a research collection. The
contents are largely rare and valu
able books which cannot be replaced
except at considerable expense.
Many cannot be replaced at all.
Neither the donor of this library or
the University at any time contem
plated its use for general reading. It
is not a browsing room. The modern
fiction to be found here is intended
for the use of scholars in connection
with their work upon contemporary

English and American literature.
The University is under legal and
moral obligation to restrict the use of j
books to the library building. This is
the only possible way of safeguard- !
ing a book collection of value.
