The Editor, Sir:
We have just heard the Stanford
Night over KFRC. Altogether we
enjoyed it very much. We have heard
Stanford called many things, but
never a "horse farm." As an under
graduate, I understand that I am a
horse, being raised on the Stanford
Farm. When I am graduated, I will
be broken, or broke.
An interesting fact to note is that
in the number entitled '"All Ameri
can Girl," the singer mentioned a
Harvard guard's pin. Unless it was
a tie-pin, or a safety pin, I suppose
that it was a reference to a fraternity
pin. This is a typical Western mis
take. Neither Harvard nor Princeton
has fraternities, and Yale is fast fin
ishing with them.
