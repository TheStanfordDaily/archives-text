"LIBELED LADY" (MGM), at the
Stanford Theater
It seems that there is nothing the
American public dotes on more than
an heiress, so Hollywood periodically
turns out one of these sagas of the
spoiled rich girl who is really a good
scout underneath and who marries
the star reporter. That with a little
variation is Libeled Lady, which re
mains amusing through swift direc
tion, clever dialogue ,and the impec
cable 'Mr. Powell.
The most hilarious sequence is that
in which Powell, posing as a crack
angler, goes fishing with the girl and
her father (Walter Connolly), bags
the biggest and wiliest fish in the
stream after having been dragged
several hundred feet down the river
by it, emerging soaked and un
happy.
Myrna Loy, a little more distant
this time as the elusive heiress is
charming as ever. Spencer Tracy, in
a lighter role than he usually as
sumes, is the harried editor whose
newspaper is being sued for five mil
lion dollars. But the biggest surprise
is Jean Harlow. As Tracy's fiancee,
Powell's "legal" wife, she is re
spectable at last, tones down her act
ing considerably.
HERE COMES CARTER
Ross Alexander is the fast-chatter
ing ex-publicity man who turns radio
reporter to give the public the low
down on moving picture stars and to
square a few grudges. Gangsters are
involved in this; Ross is beaten up,
the next night nearly murdered dur
ing his broadcast, with police happily
intervening.

TIIE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN.
at the Varsity Theater
Well, the best melodrama that Hoi-,
lywood or anyone else has attempted
for years. The music and Clifford
Odet's crackling, terse dialogue make
of this much more than a second
"China Seas." Gary Cooper as
O'Hara does his finest acting to date
and Madeleine Carroll is a beautiful j
spy. "I've got a <jood solid chunk of j

anguish in me already," she remarks
after having betrayed O'Hara. Akim
Tamiroff as "The honorable tootsie
roll" General Yang is a ruthless
Chinese war lord.
