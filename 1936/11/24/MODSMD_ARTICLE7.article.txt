# Cal Suspects Pseudo-Axe; Guards Relic Haphazardly
## Reynolds Denies Charge; Old Case Lies Empty 
### 
Stanford gave 'em the axe, but
whether it was the real axe or not is
the question bothering Charles T.
Post, editor of the Daily Californian,
in behalf of the Cal students.
In a communication with the Stan
ford Daily last night he asked: "Is
it true that the axe we have is a
fake one?" and added that a guard
of rally committee members was
placed around it because "somebody
might want to get hold of it." The
axe is accessible to anyone in the
trophy room in the Stevens Union on
the Berkeley campus.
Jim Smears Fears
"Cal's naturally suspicious," Jim
Reynolds, student body president,
said on being informed of the Cali
fornia doubts. "It's the idea of win
ning, I suppose, that makes them
think that way. Of course, it's not
so; the axe is symbolic, there would
be no point in substituting it. As for
what they do with it, that's their
lookout."
The axe was placcd on display in
the trophy room after the game Sat
urday. It is not in a case, will not be
fastened down, Post said, and would
have no ceremony or display in rec
ognition of its possession, because
"everybody is too tired." Twenty
five have been in to see it so far.
Filling the Case
Now, Stanford has an axe-case,
with the problem of what to put in
it scheduled to fill the minds of Ex
Committee tonight. Bi Gunther, of
the Cellar, suggested it the tro
phies from the trophy om of the
B.A.C. be placed in it, tl exhibit be
ing changed weekly. He would show
cups, silver footballs, Rose Bowl
awards, and other trophies, which
only about 5 per cent of the Stanford
men and none of the women have
seen. Included in this collection, he
added, are all of Harlow Rothcrt's
awards for "his unusually varied
personal endeavors."
Some prominent roughs, when
questioned about their preferences,
suggested a gravy bowl or some blue
and gold fish.
The case was made a year and a
half ago for the axe, at a cost of
$250. It was bolted to the floor in
such a way that one wanting a
glimpse of the relic had to stoop to
see it.
