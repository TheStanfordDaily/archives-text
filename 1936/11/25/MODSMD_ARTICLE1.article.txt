# Film Course Offered For Winter Term
## Showings of Old Moving Pictures To Be Open To All Farm Students 
### 
Winter quarter will inaugurate a
new course called "Lcctures on the
Motion Picture." It will be offered
by the graphic art department.
The course is planned essentially
as a history of the development of
the motion picture as a dramatic ve
hicle with a strong emphasis on the
aesthetics of the medium, considering
its social and educational potentiali
ties.
Three Units Given
Three units of credit are offered for
the course, and the syllabus fee is $3.
The class will be given on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays at II
o'clock, and is listed as Graphic Art
66.
As a corollary of the course there
will be the showing of the old mo
tion pictures which have been col
lected by the Film Library of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York
City. In the collection which will be
shown are films from as early as
1895, and includes a great variety of
types of pictux-es.
Development Shown
Among those to be used in the
course are: D. W. Griffith's ''Intoler
ance, ' early Harold Lloyd and Mack
Sennett Comedies, Sarah Bernhardt's
version of "Queen Elizabeth," and a
1905 version of "Faust." These help
to give a clear picture of the aston
ishing development of this medium
of entertainment.
Showing of these old films is spon- I
sored by the Education Club and j
arrangements are being made so that
interested students, not enrolled in
the class, may purchase subscription
tickets entitling them to see three
pictures for $1. Syllabus fees of
those in the class cover admission to
the movies.
In Little Theater
All films will be shown in the Little
Theater, and a specific announcement
of the programs and dates they will
be shown will be made later.
This sort of a course has not been
given in many universities, but Min
nesota and U.S.C. have recently in
stalled courses which are similar.
According to Daniel Mendelowitz,
instructor in graphic art, the course
will be repeated spring quarter if
successful during the winter.
