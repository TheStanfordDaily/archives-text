# Campus 'Big Shots' Rally To Thanksgiving Tradition
## Officials, Athletes, Farm Employees Give Thanks 
### R. B. JONES 
When the dial of a little black phone
spun around four times, little did it
know that it was to receive a mes
sage from any one of Stanford's
foremost promincnts as to what he
had to be thankful for over the ap
proaching Thanksgiving Holidays.
Hello, Dt>. Wilbur? To what do
you give thanks for the holiday? The
University President replied bland
ly, "I am just thankful that it wasn't
any worse. You can make the 'it'
mean anything you like, Big Game,
the election ..."
Dean Culver was inspired by the
question and gave three reasons why
he should give thanks: "I am cer
tainly thankful that there won't be
any boycott on Thanksgiving, that
Ihe Daily Bull Sessioner liked the
Gaieties, and that Chaparral doesn't
find it necessary to season its humor
with modern gripes."
Dinty Moore, all-coast basketball
guard, seemed to agree with Mrs.
Ruth when he said: "I don't have
anything, honest I don't."
Gordy Davis, campus cop, arrested
his little black and white jilloppy
with the radio in it and expostulated,
"Thank God, that most of the 1 hanks
giving takes place elsewhere!"
"Oh God," Dick Daughcrty, dra
matic manager, muttered. He hung
up without finishing his thankful
prayer.
"Thanks for the holidays!" Bob
Hoover, chairman of Ihe Interfrater
nity Council, quickly exclaimed, and
then added dubiously, "Thank God
this sad duty is over.'^
With that, the phone was given a
rest, and a group of Stanford ath
letes, discussing how they could get
to look like teddy bears and be like
Jimmy CofTis so they could rale
Stanford women, were interrupted
by the same thankless question.
Ben Dey, tennis star, modestly as
serted: "Thank God, Fred Perry has
turned pro! ' But before any other
of "the stalwarts could get in another
word, Gilman Gist, mental athlete or
Chappie gag editor, stuttered:
"Thinkers, thinking abouf thinkers
thanking thankers of thinkers, who
think thoy have thanked, think
thinking of thanking is thanking a
thinker without thanking. Person
ally. I think thinking thankers, who
think a thanker is a thinker, if he
thinks of thanking with thanks, not
thinking of thanks, arc real thank
ers."
Dave Rider, famed farm swimmer,
said "Whew " and then left Ihe group
saying, "Thanks!"

by the same thankless question.
Ben Dey, tennis star, modestly as
serted: "Thank God, Fred Perry has
turned pro! ' But before any other
of "the stalwarts could get in another
word, Gilman Gist, mental athlete or
Chappie gag editor, stuttered:
"Thinkers, thinking abouf thinkers
thanking thankers of thinkers, who
think thoy have thanked, think
thinking of thanking is thanking a
thinker without thanking. Person
ally. I think thinking thankers, who
think a thanker is a thinker, if he
thinks of thanking with thanks, not
thinking of thanks, arc real thank
ers."
Dave Rider, famed farm swimmer,
said "Whew " and then left Ihe group
saying, "Thanks!"
When the dial of a little black phone
spun around four times, little did it
know that it was to receive a mes
sage from any one of Stanford's
foremost promincnts as to what he
had to be thankful for over the ap
proaching Thanksgiving Holidays.
Hello, Dt>. Wilbur? To what do
you give thanks for the holiday? The
University President replied bland
ly, "I am just thankful that it wasn't
any worse. You can make the 'it'
mean anything you like, Big Game,
the election ..."
Dean Culver was inspired by the
question and gave three reasons why
he should give thanks: "I am cer
tainly thankful that there won't be
any boycott on Thanksgiving, that
Ihe Daily Bull Sessioner liked the
Gaieties, and that Chaparral doesn't
find it necessary to season its humor
with modern gripes."
Dinty Moore, all-coast basketball
guard, seemed to agree with Mrs.
Ruth when he said: "I don't have
anything, honest I don't."
Gordy Davis, campus cop, arrested
his little black and white jilloppy
with the radio in it and expostulated,
"Thank God, that most of the 1 hanks
giving takes place elsewhere!"
"Oh God," Dick Daughcrty, dra
matic manager, muttered. He hung
up without finishing his thankful
prayer.
"Thanks for the holidays!" Bob
Hoover, chairman of Ihe Interfrater
nity Council, quickly exclaimed, and
then added dubiously, "Thank God
this sad duty is over.'^
With that, the phone was given a
rest, and a group of Stanford ath
letes, discussing how they could get
to look like teddy bears and be like
Jimmy CofTis so they could rale
Stanford women, were interrupted
by the same thankless question.
