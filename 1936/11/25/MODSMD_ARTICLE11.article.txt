# Adams Pictures New Telescope
## Giant Mirror Described By Observatory Head 
### 
Dr. Walter S. Adams, director of
the Mt. Wilson Astronomical Ob
servatory, spoke to a large audience
in the Assembly Hall last night on
the new 200-inch telescope that is
being constructed for the observatory
now being built on Mt. Palomar.
After the introduction by Professor
Emeritus W. F. Durand, the speaker
gave a brief history of the telescope
from the time it was conceived in
1927 to the present. The large mirror
was cast in disc form at the Corning
Glass Works in Corning, New York;
then it was transported on the most
level railroads to Los Angeles, where
it is being ground in the laboratories
of the California Institute of Tech
nology.
The mirror, over 17 feet across, has
a round hole 40 inches in diameter in
the center. By means of this opening,
the focal length of the lens may be
increased beyond its ordinary length
of 500 feet.
The purpose of the mirror is to
show the more distant bodies and
stellar systems with greater clarity.
It would be of little use, according to
Dr. Adams, to bring the bodies of our
own solar system closer: they would
merely become more indistinct, due
to the varied currents in the atmos
phere.
