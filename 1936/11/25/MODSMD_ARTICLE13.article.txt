### GENE GEAR 
Remembers tiie axe?
This thought permeated the minds
of Stanford's "Varsity water poloists
as they battered down a fighting
California Bear yesterday in Encina
Pool to pull through with a thrilling
4-2 victory.
Stanford's frosh septet lost a heart
breaking 4-3 decision to the Califor
nia Cubs in the preliminary, thus
marring its undefeated season.
Clinch Coast Title
The varsity win gave Nort Thorn
ton's men the undisputed right to the
Pacific Coast Conference champion-

ship with five victories and one de-
The Bears have to be content
with a second place, winning four
games and losing two.
Tom Whitaker, the referee, un
wittingly spurred on the Cards when
he called a hazy decision giving
Cal the first goal of the game. The
Indians came back fighting and a
goal by Johnny Lamb knotted the
score at half time 1-1.
Hoover Scores One
After a few minutes of the second
half, little Bobby Hoover put in one
of his famous lob shots to break the
deadlock, and another sizzling shot
by Lamb put the Indian amphibians
out in front 3-1.
The Bears, fighting all the way,
came back down the pool, finally
breaking "Sharkey" Graham out
into the open for a shot, putting the
Berkeley water dogs back in the
running.
Hunna Makes Another
Big Bill Hanna whistled the ball
into the Bear net with less than a
minute to play, and was threatening
to score again as the final gun
barked.
Hanna, Lamb, and Hoover were all
exceptional at forwards for the Red
skins. Hanna, the Coast's fastest
sprint, took 6 out of 8 dashes from
Captain Jim Lawrence of the Bears.
Lamb's scoring eye returned and he
roamed more than usual to gain
high scoring honors with two goals.
Hoover was outstanding in his drib
bling work and drawing of the Bear
guards away.
Card Forwards Best
Chuck Giflin, Don Peterson, Ben
Voss, and Jack Loupe outfought the
Bear forward wall all through the
game. Captain Bobby Haslaeher
was great in the Cardinal net, stop
ping the fast Cal throws with as
tounding agility.
Saturday's battle in Berkeley was
clearly Blue and Gold with the
Bears winning 1-0, but yesterday's
aquatic struggle had a distinct red
color to it with the Indians outplay
ing the invaders in every department
of the game.
Frosh Game Close
In the frosh game, the Bear Cubs
gained a 2-1 lead at half time, but
the Indian Papooses came back
fighting in the second half to take a
3-2 advantage. Cal scored again to
tie things up at 3-3.
With 20 seconds to go and a sure
overtime game looming, a Stanford
guard's error gave Cal's star, Joe
Aronson, a clear shot at the net for
the winning goal.
The Farm water babes had won
from the Bear Cubs Saturday, 2-1.
