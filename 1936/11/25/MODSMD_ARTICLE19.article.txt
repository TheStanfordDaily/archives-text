# Daily Folds For 1936, December 3
## 
### 
With the paper of Thursday, De
cember 3, the Daily folds up for au
tumn quarter and Dippy scribes quit
pounding typewriters to begin
pounding books for finals.
Almost simultaneously, all Lower
Division students will be required to
preregister for winter quarter De
cember 1, 2, 3, and 4. Journalism ma
jors preregister December 3 and 4,
while all other majors who must do
so have been notified by mail.
For the Daily to issue its last
number of the quarter on a Thurs
day is unusual. Because it got away
to an earlier start due to freshman
orientation period in September,
volume 00 found that December 3
would mark its 45th edition. Because
previous quarters have had no more
than this, the business department
will not permit a Friday paper.
