# Ex Committee Decides To Fill Up Axe Case With B.A.C. Trophies
## Daily Budget Maintains Status Quo; Gaieties Hits May Be Published 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
What will go in the axe case?
Ex Committee decidcd last night
to rotate B.A.C. trophies, changing
the display each week, with Chick
Franich and Larry Rouble as offiial
custodians. Franich's suggestion of
"blue and gold fish" and Jim Rey
nolds' of the "football memorial for
the vowing sophs" were discarded.
Daily Unchanged
I)AIL\ BUDGET will maintain the
status quo, ruled the group, as Chuck
Fontius' proposed revision was voted
down by Joe Burris. Since only a
quorum was present, the vote had to
be unanimous.
Under the present set-up, the
business staff receives 60 cents per
student per quarter for publication
expense. An additional 15 cents goes
toward the editorial budget for cuts
and incidental expenses. Fontius
would have combined the two, with
the editor, the managing editor, the
business manager, and the journal
ism department head budgeting edi
torial expenses at the beginning of
each quarter.
Hits To Be Plugged
GAIETIES SONGS will bo publi
ciz&d if Ram's Head and song-writers
sanction copyrighting. Opinion of the
Gaieties organizers will be sounded
out by Bob Mallett and Shirley
Jones, with the possibility that Ex
Committee will back the venture.
Some of the numbers have a "bet
ter than fair" chance of becoming
hits, reported Mallett. He has re
ceived commendation of the score
from Carl Sulzbach, in charge of
California Hour tryouts, who had
written, enclosing press clippings.
"Main advantage is publicity for
Stanford," reported Phil Bernheim,
who thought that financial profit was
unlikely. Mallett and Jones will re
port next week before a final deci
sion is made.
No Theater Boycott
THEATER BOYCOTT will be sub
ject to arbitration, with Roy Ander
son, Bob Mallett ,and President Rey
nolds meeting with theater execu
tives.
They will request free admission
for freshmen during the pajama
rino, guaranteeing to pay for possible
damages, and a 30-cent rate for bal
cony seats with A.S.S.U. card.
Men's representatives from 13 liv
ing groups also suggested that double
bills be eliminated. A boycott would
be impractical and probably unsuc
cessful, decided the committee. A. S.
U., sponsors o<" the move, drop by the
wayside, as Committee will take
over the entire project.
Two Day Bonfire
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE reco.ni -
mendation that the bonfire building
be limited to two days' work or the
site be changed, was sanctioned half
heartedly. "Frosh threw rocks at
windows and women retaliated by
throwing water bags," reported Vice
president Esther Pelton for Confer
ence. "Everyone was too tired to
yell at the game after three nights
of it."
BOOK STORE board of directors
will in the fyture include the stu
dent manager, giving close contact
between A.S.S.U. and the board. One
dollar was appropriated as Fontius'
membership fee.
Orchestras Allowed
BIG TIME ORCHESTRAS will be
allowed for campus dances at the
discretion of Ex Committee. Tenta
tive suggestions for control were
that only one big-name musical
group be allowed each quarter, that
the sponsoring organization have
large enough budget to cover pos
sible losses, that bids be low enough
in price to admit financially pressed
students. "When feasible," was
adopted as the qualifying clause in
approval of the move.
DATES GRANTED were Delta
Tau Delta. December 4; Concert Se
ries, May 12, for a Russian opera,
with Stanford faculty and students in
the cast, if the venture is successful
in San Francisco. The program is
planned as the opening presentation
of the new theater.

What will go in the axe case?
Ex Committee decidcd last night
to rotate B.A.C. trophies, changing
the display each week, with Chick
Franich and Larry Rouble as offiial
custodians. Franich's suggestion of
"blue and gold fish" and Jim Rey
nolds' of the "football memorial for
the vowing sophs" were discarded.
Daily Unchanged
I)AIL\ BUDGET will maintain the
status quo, ruled the group, as Chuck
Fontius' proposed revision was voted
down by Joe Burris. Since only a
quorum was present, the vote had to
be unanimous.
Under the present set-up, the
business staff receives 60 cents per
student per quarter for publication
expense. An additional 15 cents goes
toward the editorial budget for cuts
and incidental expenses. Fontius
would have combined the two, with
the editor, the managing editor, the
business manager, and the journal
ism department head budgeting edi
torial expenses at the beginning of
each quarter.
Hits To Be Plugged
GAIETIES SONGS will bo publi
ciz&d if Ram's Head and song-writers
sanction copyrighting. Opinion of the
Gaieties organizers will be sounded
out by Bob Mallett and Shirley
Jones, with the possibility that Ex
Committee will back the venture.
Some of the numbers have a "bet
ter than fair" chance of becoming
hits, reported Mallett. He has re
ceived commendation of the score
from Carl Sulzbach, in charge of
California Hour tryouts, who had
written, enclosing press clippings.
"Main advantage is publicity for
Stanford," reported Phil Bernheim,
who thought that financial profit was
unlikely. Mallett and Jones will re
port next week before a final deci
sion is made.
No Theater Boycott
THEATER BOYCOTT will be sub
ject to arbitration, with Roy Ander
son, Bob Mallett ,and President Rey
nolds meeting with theater execu
tives.
They will request free admission
for freshmen during the pajama
rino, guaranteeing to pay for possible
damages, and a 30-cent rate for bal
cony seats with A.S.S.U. card.
Men's representatives from 13 liv
ing groups also suggested that double
bills be eliminated. A boycott would
be impractical and probably unsuc
cessful, decided the committee. A. S.
U., sponsors o<" the move, drop by the
wayside, as Committee will take
over the entire project.
Two Day Bonfire
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE reco.ni -
mendation that the bonfire building
be limited to two days' work or the
site be changed, was sanctioned half
heartedly. "Frosh threw rocks at
windows and women retaliated by
throwing water bags," reported Vice
president Esther Pelton for Confer
ence. "Everyone was too tired to
yell at the game after three nights
of it."
BOOK STORE board of directors
will in the fyture include the stu

between A.S.S.U. and the board. One
dollar was appropriated as Fontius'
membership fee.
Orchestras Allowed
BIG TIME ORCHESTRAS will be
allowed for campus dances at the
discretion of Ex Committee. Tenta
tive suggestions for control were
that only one big-name musical
group be allowed each quarter, that
the sponsoring organization have
large enough budget to cover pos

in price to admit financially pressed
students. "When feasible," was
adopted as the qualifying clause in

site be changed, was sanctioned half
heartedly. "Frosh threw rocks at
windows and women retaliated by
throwing water bags," reported Vice
president Esther Pelton for Confer
ence. "Everyone was too tired to
yell at the game after three nights
of it."
BOOK STORE board of directors
will in the fyture include the stu
dent manager, giving close contact
between A.S.S.U. and the board. One
dollar was appropriated as Fontius'
membership fee.
Orchestras Allowed
BIG TIME ORCHESTRAS will be
allowed for campus dances at the
discretion of Ex Committee. Tenta
tive suggestions for control were
that only one big-name musical
group be allowed each quarter, that
the sponsoring organization have
large enough budget to cover pos
sible losses, that bids be low enough
in price to admit financially pressed
students. "When feasible," was
adopted as the qualifying clause in
approval of the move.
DATES GRANTED were Delta
Tau Delta. December 4; Concert Se
ries, May 12, for a Russian opera,
with Stanford faculty and students in
the cast, if the venture is successful
in San Francisco. The program is
planned as the opening presentation
of the new theater.

What will go in the axe case?
Ex Committee decidcd last night
to rotate B.A.C. trophies, changing
the display each week, with Chick
Franich and Larry Rouble as offiial
custodians. Franich's suggestion of
"blue and gold fish" and Jim Rey
nolds' of the "football memorial for
the vowing sophs" were discarded.
Daily Unchanged
I)AIL\ BUDGET will maintain the
status quo, ruled the group, as Chuck
Fontius' proposed revision was voted
down by Joe Burris. Since only a
quorum was present, the vote had to
be unanimous.
Under the present set-up, the
business staff receives 60 cents per
student per quarter for publication
expense. An additional 15 cents goes
toward the editorial budget for cuts
and incidental expenses. Fontius
would have combined the two, with
the editor, the managing editor, the
business manager, and the journal
ism department head budgeting edi
torial expenses at the beginning of
each quarter.
Hits To Be Plugged
GAIETIES SONGS will bo publi
ciz&d if Ram's Head and song-writers
sanction copyrighting. Opinion of the
Gaieties organizers will be sounded
out by Bob Mallett and Shirley
Jones, with the possibility that Ex
Committee will back the venture.
Some of the numbers have a "bet
ter than fair" chance of becoming
hits, reported Mallett. He has re
ceived commendation of the score
from Carl Sulzbach, in charge of
California Hour tryouts, who had
written, enclosing press clippings.
"Main advantage is publicity for
Stanford," reported Phil Bernheim,
who thought that financial profit was
unlikely. Mallett and Jones will re
port next week before a final deci
sion is made.
No Theater Boycott
THEATER BOYCOTT will be sub
ject to arbitration, with Roy Ander
son, Bob Mallett ,and President Rey
nolds meeting with theater execu
tives.
They will request free admission
for freshmen during the pajama
rino, guaranteeing to pay for possible
damages, and a 30-cent rate for bal
cony seats with A.S.S.U. card.
Men's representatives from 13 liv
ing groups also suggested that double
bills be eliminated. A boycott would
be impractical and probably unsuc
cessful, decided the committee. A. S.
U., sponsors o<" the move, drop by the
wayside, as Committee will take
over the entire project.
