This world series duel, as one pa
per has called it, with Dr. Franz
Sargas against nine opponents, is
great stuff, only it looks suspiciously
like the thing is being put off from
day to day to let the publicity build
up. Last minute bulletins on the con
dition of all the contestants, like how
one of them spent a sleepless night
because the neighbors next door
were yowling too much, have been
issued from the locker room with
great regularity. By the time this
column is printed, either the morgue
or the hospital will have issued a
final bulletin and the whole affair
will be ovei*.

All of his duels are being fought
because a small army of interested
pectutors to his recent marriage to a
yealthy lady have accused him of
ulterior motives in marrying the
woman. No doubt he is a brave man,

but a guy with notions like Dr.
Sargas are better off safely tucked

remark to her escort for the evening
that her shiny new Packard had
something to do with his affection for
her, the boy would be more likely to
agree than to be insulted and call
for pistols at 20 paces in the morning.

I am not saying that the American
habit of making dirty remarks as to a
person's character and motives is a
fine thing. All I can say is that such
is our habit and Dr. Franz Sargas
would have a tough time of it in
America with his finely developed
sense of "honor."
Just think what would have hap
pened if Dr. Sargas had been the
Mdivani boy who married Barbara
Hutton. He would have had a duel
on his hands with every newspaper
buttinski in the country like myself
who raised his voice in righteous
calumny when the Wool worth prin
cess settled on him an annuity of
one hundred thousand dollars.
