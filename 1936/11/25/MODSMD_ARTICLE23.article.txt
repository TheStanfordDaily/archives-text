# Plan Service For Afternoon
## Dr. Atkins To Preach In Chapel Next Sunday 
### 
In place of the regular morning
service in the Memorial Church,
services will be held at 4 o'clock this
Sunday afternoon. Dr. Gaius Glenn
Atkins, who preached the sermon
last week, will be the preacher.
The change in time of service was
made in the hope that by that time
many students will have returned to
the campus, and to give townspeople
a chance to hear this eminent speak
er. Dr. Atkins is the professor of
homiletics at Auburn Theological
Seminary at Auburn, New York.
He has had a successful career as
a minister of Congregational church
es both in Providence, R.1., and De
troit, Mich. Last Sunday marked his
first appearance at Stanford. Yester
day he gave the lecture in the Re
ligious Literature class, dealing es
pecially with the works of William
Law.
