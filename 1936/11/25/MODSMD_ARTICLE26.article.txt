# Probe Reveals Stanford Alumnus Chartered Plane To Circle Bonfire
## 
### 
The airplane that flew over the
Big Game bonfire, creating a stir
among Stanford students as a pre
sumed "bomb carrier" from Cal and
a big stir among metropolitan news
papers, was chartered by a Card
alumnus to stir up a fighting spirit
and add enthusiasm to the rally, an
investigation by the Daily revealed
yesterday.
Fred Harvey, pilot of the Associat
ed Air Services, was paid to fly a
plane over the fire for an hour. When
the Palo Alto Airport was approach
ed about the scheme they refused
because they thought it was the work
of Cal invaders, but when the custo
mer proved to be a Stanford man, it
agreed to do the job.
The plane circled quite low over
the bonfire when it was first lit, but
when the rockets went of! it gained
altitude because of the danger of fire
and did not fly low again. Two other
planes that were observed by stu
dents at the rally belonged to the
United Airlines and were flying their

regular routes.
The San Francisco papers stated
that planes flown by U.C. students
had flown over the Stanford campus
and dropped bombs on the fire. The
disturbances of last week not only
rated headlines in the San Francisco
press but also in newspapers as far
east as the Chicago Daily Tribune.
