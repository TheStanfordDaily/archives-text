Uncle Sam's air mail brought us
the latest news from those battle
weary Indians headed for the Big
City and a crack at Lou Little's Co
lumbia Lions.
Sandy Lowengart, junior manager
of Tiny's gridiron warriors, sent the
good word from Ogden, Utah. He
had a difficult time trying to write as
the icy atmosphere of that neck of
the wooks practically froze him to
the pencil. Even the "All Wool A. G.
Spaulding Bros." travelling jackets
didn't keep the invaders from the
Farm in a warm condition.
The boys aren't paying much at
tention to their studies, according to
Sandy, who says most of the long
hours are occupied in playing games
of chance with more than sugar
lumps at stake.
DISGRUNTLED INDIANS
HAVE PRAISE FOR FOES
The Indians are quite naturally
disappointed with the outcome of
Saturday's debacle, but they all ad
mit that Cal outplayed and out
fought them that black day in Ber
keley.
Jim Lawson, end coach, opined
that Stanford played one of its worst
games of the season in losing to the
Bears.
The cross country grid messengers
from the Farm aren't downcast
enough, far from it. Already a "Wax
Columbia" yell echoes through the
aisles of the Stanford Special.
In fact, they are living up to their
name of the "laughing boys" and
are planning devious ways to take
apart little old New York City after a
Cardinal victory on the greensward
of the Polo Grounds.
The Indians whipped through a
workout yesterday afternoon in Chi
cago and are determined to avenge
the 7-0 defeat plastered on the
"vowing sophs" by the Columbians
in the Rose Bowl t rheeya ey :."1
in the Rose Bowl three years ago.
PLANS MADE TO SILENCE
COLUMBIA'S LOU LITTLE
That victory for the Lions launch
ed Columbia's mentor, Lou Little, on
a literary career which still burdens
a country just a little tired of hear
ing about how the New Yorkers
trimmed the Cards back in '33.
Tiny's pigskin toters are capable of
playing real football—carefree, sen
sational football—the kind that sub
dued the best efforts of U.C.L.A.,
Washington, and Oregon State. If
the Big Red Machine, despite the
patched tires and ruined gear shift,
ever gets rolling ,the Polo Grounds
caretakers will have a job on their
hands Sunday morning digging up
the scattered remains of Columbia's
Lion for a suitable burial.
With the burial of the Lion may
conic the end of Columbia Lou's
famous literary extravaganza. At
least it's something to work for. Tiny.
MASTERS PONDERS OVER
MATTERS OF FINANCE
A1 Masters is making the trip with
the team and is a bit worried, as
usual, over the financial side of this
transcontinental expedition under
taken by the Redskins.
It seems that something around
the figure of $14,000 will be needed
to finance the Cards' little jaunt, and
Stanford has to depend on the gate
receipts of Saturday's struggle to
foot the bills.
Right now, two up and down teams
with little in the way of impressive
records, playing a game of football
doesn't particularly impress the New
Yorker as a spectacle worthy of at
tention.
Bobby Grayson's out there, though,
trying hard to drum up trade.
