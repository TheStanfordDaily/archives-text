# Indians Work Out In Snow At Chicago
## Columbia Promises Tough Opposition To Revengeful Stanford Troupe Saturday Lions Boast Versatile Backs but Lack Strong Forward Wall; Luckman, Vollmer Loom as Threats 
### BOB IRELAND 
CHICAGO, Nov. 24.â€”After experiencing their first practice in snow,
members of the traveling Stanford football team entrained tonight for
New York City to make final preparations for their game with the Colum
bia Lions on the Polo Grounds Saturday.
Coach Tiny Thornhill worked out his men on snow-covered Stagg Field
at the University of Chicago in the face of icy winds. The ball soon be-

'came undistinguishable from the
came indistinguishable from the
snow and going was extremely slip
pery.
Lions Await
Meanwhile an angry Lion awaited
the arrival of the revengeful Indians
which she defeated in the Rose Bowl
on a rainy New Year's day in 1934.
Columbia's starting backfield will
probably consist of Furey, Luckman,
Hudasky and Bonom, with Furey
calling the signals and blocking, and
Luckman playing the tail-back posi
tion on most plays. This boy Sid
Luckman, if he is in shape, can give
the Stanfords an unhappy afternoon.
He is a big, fast 195-pounder, who
can run, kick, pass, and block with
the best. If he tires Joe Vollmer will
replace him. Vollmer, who was a
regular last year, averaged 50 yards
or better on his punts from scrim
make against Syracuse, and was not
far behind this in the Dartmouth and
Cornell games. It pains me to write
that in case Vollmer is eliminated
Mac Mahon, still another player who
can outkick any man on the Stanford
team, will come in. Howie Westphal,
ace passer, is another Columbia re
serve who is sure to see plenty of
action Saturday afternoon.
Columbians Tough
Don't let anybody fool you, these
backs are plenty good! If they had a
line in front of them, Lord knows
what might happen. But the Colum
bia line, as I have indicated, is pretty
much of a bust offensively. Against
Dartmouth the strongest team the
Lions have played this year, the boys
gained from scrimmage after losses
were deducted, a net total of ten,
count 'em, ten yards all afternoon.
On passes they gainted 49, and yet
with this miserable showing they
scored 13 points. Fumbles near the
goal line of Vollmer's booming 60-
yard punts, coupled with a penalty to
the one-foot line, had something to
do with this, but eevn so, Heaven
help Stanford if they fumble against
the Columbias deep in their own ter
ritory!
Columbia Keyed Up
When the opening whistle starts
the game, Tiny's charges will be fac
ing a team that is keyed up to the
highest pitch .a team that hates Stan
ford with the deep ,undying hatred
that only Columbias are capable of
feeling,
