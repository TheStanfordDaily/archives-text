# Huskies Seek Pasadena Game
## Alabama Looms Possible Rival for Washington 
### WALT PETERSON 
Washington's Huskies have hoed a
long row this season, since they lost
that heartbreaker to Minnesota in
the opener, and they reach the end of
the cabbage patch when they meet
Washington State in Seattle Satur
day.
Ed Goddard, wizard of the Pulouse,
is the principal opponent that Wash
ington will have to overcome if they
want to win. It means a lot to them,
for the Rose Bowl is straight ahead if
they triumph. Goddard, rated the
best in the Northwest all season,
was named to the United Press Ail-
American yesterday.
The Huskies have rolled along
steadily all season so far, the only
motor trouble coming when they met
a Stanford team at its peak to squeak
through with a 14-14 tie. A loss to
the Cougars would put them into a
tie with that team, Washington State
having battled to a 0-0 tie with Troy
and lost to Oregon State with mysti
fying Joe Gray. The spirit at Wash
ington U. practically has the Huskies
in the Bowl, 'tis said.
Eastern representative for the
Pasadena tilt is still questionable,
although there are rumors that Jim
my Phelan, presupposing a Husky
victory Saturday, has already nego
tiated with Frank Thomas, Alabama
coach, to keep New Year's Day open.
The Rammer-Jammers have only a
tie with Tennessee to mar their rec
ord, but they tangle with a rugged
Vanderbilt squad that might pull
enough tricks out of the bag Satur
day to win. On comparative scores,
though, they aren't in it with the
Tide.
Fordham also has a look-in, al
though they too have been tied. Last
Saturday a Georgia team traveled to
Athens, New York, and mucked up
the works with a 7-7 tie. Outside of
that the Rams have a clean slate.
They trounced St. Mary's 7-6 for the
closest contest they have had other
wise.
Marquette, figured to be a possible
candidate, took a 13-0 lacing from
Duquesne Saturday to have itself in
gloriously eliminated.
Back to the coast, Santa Clara re
mains the only untied, unbeaten
team in the nation, and already the
howls are rising to have the Broncs
in the Rose Bowl. But the conference
has a lease on the Bowl now, and be
sides that, Texas Christian still
stands betwen them and that clear
record.

steadily all season so far, the only
motor trouble coming when they met
a Stanford team at its peak to squeak
through with a 14-14 tie. A loss to
the Cougars would put them into a
tie with that team, Washington State
having battled to a 0-0 tie with Troy
and lost to Oregon State with mysti
fying Joe Gray. The spirit at Wash
ington U. practically has the Huskies
in the Bowl, 'tis said.
Eastern representative for the
Pasadena tilt is still questionable,
although there are rumors that Jim
my Phelan, presupposing a Husky
victory Saturday, has already nego
tiated with Frank Thomas, Alabama
coach, to keep New Year's Day open.
The Rammer-Jammers have only a
tie with Tennessee to mar their rec
ord, but they tangle with a rugged
Vanderbilt squad that might pull
enough tricks out of the bag Satur
day to win. On comparative scores,
though, they aren't in it with the
Tide.
Fordham also has a look-in, al
though they too have been tied. Last
Saturday a Georgia team traveled to
Athens, New York, and mucked up
the works with a 7-7 tie. Outside of
that the Rams have a clean slate.
They trounced St. Mary's 7-6 for the
closest contest they have had other
wise.
Marquette, figured to be a possible
candidate, took a 13-0 lacing from
Duquesne Saturday to have itself in
gloriously eliminated.
Back to the coast, Santa Clara re
mains the only untied, unbeaten
team in the nation, and already the
howls are rising to have the Broncs
in the Rose Bowl. But the conference
has a lease on the Bowl now, and be
sides that, Texas Christian still
stands betwen them and that clear
record.
Washington's Huskies have hoed a
long row this season, since they lost
that heartbreaker to Minnesota in
the opener, and they reach the end of
the cabbage patch when they meet
Washington State in Seattle Satur
day.
Ed Goddard, wizard of the Pulouse,
is the principal opponent that Wash
ington will have to overcome if they
want to win. It means a lot to them,
for the Rose Bowl is straight ahead if
they triumph. Goddard, rated the
best in the Northwest all season,
was named to the United Press Ail-
American yesterday.
The Huskies have rolled along
steadily all season so far, the only
