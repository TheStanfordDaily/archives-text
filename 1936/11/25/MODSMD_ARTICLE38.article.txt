# Indians Defeat J.C. Soccermen
## Conquer San Mateo In Second League Win 
### 
For quite a spell in yesterday's
soccer fray with San Mateo Junior
College, it looked as though Carl
Schaupp's "headwork" would get !
all the credit for a Stanford victory,
but in the final quarter, Captain Bob
Hall slapped home a counter to com
plete the scoring and give the Cards
a nice 2-0 win.
Carl made his bid for honors in
the final minutes of the first half
when Dave Parker got a free .side
line kick at the enemy goal. Parker
gave the ball a beautiful boot which
carried a little too far. Schaupp,
however, was on hand to bounce the
ball perfectly off his skull, the re
bound whipping into the net.
Hall Drives Through
In the second half, Stanford kept !
forcing the issue but couldn't quite !
locate the goal posts. With five min- !
utes to play, offense efforts yielded j
profit when Hall slashed out at the I
ball bobbing around deep in San !
Mateo territory and drove it past the ;
frantic goal tender.
The game was well played
throughout, although Stanford was |
the aggressive eleven. Victory makes j
up for the early season tie with the j
junior college and provides a mite j
of atonement for the California set- j
backs of the last ten days.
Schaupp Stands Out
,In the front line, Schaupp not only j
"used his head" on one scoring occa- |
sion but was the standout of the 1
entire contest. Wayne Richardson's j
long kicks from the defense kept the
opposition pretty well backed up j
most of the afternoon.
Beating San Mateo gives the Ma- >
loney men their second full-fledged '
league win of the fall, which may not j
sound particularly impressive. The 1
locals, however, have quite a few j
draws on the record and a non-con- i
ference win over U.C.L.A. The last i
chance to embellish the books comes I
on December 5 when they go up to |
the City for season finale with San I
Francisco.
Gorillas often reach a height of,
six feet and have a reach of eight i
feet.
