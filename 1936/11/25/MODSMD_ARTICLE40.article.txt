# Thanksgiving Thanks
## 
### 
I give thanks to whatever got me here,
Whether it be the good fairy, the doc with the
black bag,
Mandrake the magician, the energy in the atom
Or God.
I'm here aren't I?
And I don't think it's such a lousy place.
Of course, right today I can't think up an edit,
And I feel as if I should.
For the world is slowly unraveling at both ends
And Stanford is curling along with it,
But I don't feel today that I can do much about
it.
Because no matter what the ads say
No one has yet invented a method of stopping
runs.
And tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I should
be thankful.
And I am thankful, dmmmmmmit.
Now the world has been unraveling at both
ends
For a long time.
And I doubt that either the conservation of
energy
Or a philosophy of extreme self-interest
Will stop it much.
And I won't either.
And everybody says we should develop new
means
To harness our productive forces for social
good.
But everybody's too busy harnessing around
For their own good.
And that applies to the Communists, too.
But the fact remains that I can't think up an edit.
And I don't think this is such a lousy place.
Because the world may be unwinding,
In fact, completely sprung,
But we don't need to bother at Stanford.
Here at school we don't care
f the digestive apparati of many Spaniards
Are being sprinkled about Madrid
)r that in some gas-lit apartment
A husband gets drunk and beats his wife every
night.
We merely observe them as social phenomena
■\nd see if they are colored green or blue,
They are usually colored green.
Hor do we have to worry if we're getting edu
cated.
All we care is
About getting a job,
letting married,
Settling down
And having a dog.
And we will probably do all that
Because tuition is high.
Our biggest struggle at Stanford is
To get a requisition from the A.S.S.U.
We don't have to make decisions
Or write edits that have conclusions.
Because it is easier not to.
And that is our philosophy of self-interest.
And that is why I am thankful
At Stanford on Thanksgiving Day 1936.
I give thanks to whatever got me here,
Whether it be the good fairy, the doc with the
black bag,
Mandrake the magician, the energy in the atom

Because the world may be unwinding,
In fact, completely sprung,
But we don't need to bother at Stanford.
Here at school we don't care
f the digestive apparati of many Spaniards
Are being sprinkled about Madrid
)r that in some gas-lit apartment
A husband gets drunk and beats his wife every
night.
We merely observe them as social phenomena
■\nd see if they are colored green or blue,
They are usually colored green.
Hor do we have to worry if we're getting edu
cated.
All we care is
About getting a job,
letting married,
Settling down
And having a dog.
And we will probably do all that
Because tuition is high.
Our biggest struggle at Stanford is
To get a requisition from the A.S.S.U.
We don't have to make decisions
Or write edits that have conclusions.
Because it is easier not to.
And that is our philosophy of self-interest.
And that is why I am thankful
At Stanford on Thanksgiving Day 1936.
I give thanks to whatever got me here,
Whether it be the good fairy, the doc with the
black bag,
Mandrake the magician, the energy in the atom
Or God.
I'm here aren't I?
And I don't think it's such a lousy place.
Of course, right today I can't think up an edit,
And I feel as if I should.
For the world is slowly unraveling at both ends
And Stanford is curling along with it,
But I don't feel today that I can do much about
it.
Because no matter what the ads say
No one has yet invented a method of stopping
runs.
And tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I should
be thankful.
And I am thankful, dmmmmmmit.
Now the world has been unraveling at both
ends
For a long time.
And I doubt that either the conservation of
energy
Or a philosophy of extreme self-interest
Will stop it much.
And I won't either.
And everybody says we should develop new
means
To harness our productive forces for social
good.
But everybody's too busy harnessing around
For their own good.
And that applies to the Communists, too.
But the fact remains that I can't think up an edit.
And I don't think this is such a lousy place.
