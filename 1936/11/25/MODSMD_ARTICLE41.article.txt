# B.A.C. Baggage
## 
### 
When the New York-bound train pulled out
of the Oakland mole Saturday evening with
several Stanford special cars attached, there
were in addition to 33 members of the football
squad, the male coaching staff, the yell-leader ;
senior and junior managers—four wives of the
coaching staff and B.A.C. officials.
ihe train faro of these women cannot be said

to have been paid directly by the B.A.C.—only
their Pullman. It appears that in former years
the B.A.C. has paid a certain rate for a full Pull
man car and for additional space in part of an
other car. This year, however, through the
benevolence of the Southern and Union Pacific
transcontinental combine, the B.A.C. has been
able to secure two full cars for the same price
that it would have cost to get the one car and
part of another.
So it was voted at the B.A.C. meeting a while
ago to give the additional space over to the
coaches' wives. This seems a rather nice ges
ture to the coaches; however, there were some
members of the third or fourth string who had
to stay home (the wife of one B.A.C. official not
a coach wanted the trip so badly that she won
her way by competing in a subscription contest
conducted by a metropolitan Hearstian daily)
because there wasn't room on the train.
Six of the 33 men who are on the trip have not
yet played this season and are not supposed to
play Saturday in order to maintain their extra
year of competition. So it cannot be said that
the sole basis for selecting trip members de
pended on ability to play.
It would seem that it would be a nice gesture
to lowly members of the squad to repay them
for some of their stooging time by taking them
along. R. H.
