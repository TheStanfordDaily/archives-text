Win, lose or draw, a Big Game at Berkeley guaran
tees one benefit: it makes you appreciate Stanford.
After seeing Californians and their sprawling cam
pus, as gentlemen we should make a point of always
giving them the Big Game. It's about the only nice
thing they get.
Somehow, the whole place reminds you of an over
grown high school—which upon examination, you'll
find it is. Constricted on all sides by a particularly
noisesome part of Berkeley, the campus proper contains
mostly educational buildings. The living quarters are
either shanty-town boarding houses or fraternity
houses squatting on city streets, just a stagger from the
street car and downtown Oakland—which we'll throw
in with the game.

The university quarters show the influence of the
California legislature. Because (hey came from Amer
ican pocketbooks, they are, of course, Greek. They are
uniformly cold, uniformly out of place, uniformly un
distinguished. With half the building budget, the cam
pus would look like any midwestern university, almost
as many miles from the Aegean and an infinite dis
tance in sentiment from the Golden Age.

As for knowing the university, Cal people make a
pretense only of attending it. Stanford students may
have doubts about Hoover's home. Cal people don't
know where the D.G. house is.
And they know and care less about the students.
Jimmy Dorsey kicked modern masterpieces around the
new Edwards Gym Big Game night. But of the 15,000
enrolled, not 1500 turned up to dance. Why? Because
it was a campus dance, and the smoothies couldn't be
seen there. Well, hardly!

Stanford may draw its social lines fine, but Cal
draws them broad. So broad, indeed, that something
akin to a caste system has been instituted to protect
the social finish of the "most favored nabobs." What
Jimmy played for were what the upper classes might
call the lower classes. At Cal, never the twain shall
meet—outside the classroom.
It's no wonder the Cal student body is purely and
simply a mob. Fifteen thousand people who don't know
or care about each other, ready to fight for anything
as long as they can fight, are perfect rabble for the
rabble-rouser, whether he be principle or person.
Nuts to Cal, generally and specifically.
