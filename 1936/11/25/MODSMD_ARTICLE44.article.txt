The super snupers in t hat great news-gathering or
ganization of the Stanford campus known as the Stan
ford Daily missed a little item in their report of the
three Cal Kappas caught painting yellow "C's" on the
Stanford campus. As the plot unfolds we find that the
three Kappas had decorated the Palm Drive gates, here
and there about the campus, and after sloshing about
the Farm ended up in front of the Chi Psi house. The
Chi Psi's discovered them, ehased them, and brought
them down, and discovered that one of the Cal Kappas
was the girl friend of A.S.S.U. President Jim Reynolds.
The A.S.S.U. office force doesn't approve of Stan
ford's official disloyalty to Stanford women. Both the
president and the student manager date Cal women.
But the secretaries don't like it a little bit.
Students admitted to Med School have to troop
over to the Health Service to get a shot in the arm for
t.b. A mob descended on the service the other day,
so the nurse said: "Line up against Ihe wall, and I'll
give it to you all at the same time."
So they lined up, and she went, clickety clack,
clickety-clack, from arm to arm. When she was fin
ished, they all left but one. Ho looked at the nurse
with trustful eyes and said, "What did you do that
for?" She laboriously expalined how wonderful mod
ern science was, and how doctors had given their lives
in laborious research to develop serums and vaccines.
The student looked up at her with trustful eyes, and
said: "But I didn't come over here to t*et tested or
vaccinated. I'm not going to Med School, I'm SICK."
