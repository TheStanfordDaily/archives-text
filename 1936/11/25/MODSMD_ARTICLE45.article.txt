EX COMMITTEE IS A FLOP! It
isn't the good show it used to be in
the days of Bill Rogers, Frank Ful
lenwider, Bob Gros, and the other
old timers. Formerly, the weekly Ex
Committee meeting was better than
a Paly show. I wouldn't have
missed one. Now I never go. The
boys and girls in office today are
rank amateurs! They haven't the
quick wit, the ribald humor, the
j subtle sense of timing, that all good
comedians, and Ex Committee mem
bers, possess. What Ex Committee
needs is a good injection of show
manship!
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN, and
the tail end of a squib about SHOW
BUSINESS was accidentaly left off
yesterday's column in making up the
paper. Here's how the item should
have read in its entirety:
A man who has been a theater au
dience for five years is having a va
cation.
In order to retain the lease on the
Cart hay Theater in Hollywood, the
operator is obliged to give a daily
performance. The lease doesn't
specify what kind or length of per
formance.
Every day during the five years
that the theater has been dark, A. E.
Wetherbee has opened the box of
fice, purchased a ticket, dropped it
in the chopper, started a recording,
listened to it. Then he closed the
theater and went home. Wetherbee
holds the lease.
The theater is open now, so its one
man audience is on a vacation.
GAIETIES TUNES evidently made
a hit with the campus. Several per
sons have asked The Daily to print
the lyrics to some of the better songs.
If there's enough interest in it, this
column will run the words to "His
Excellency" and "Picnic in the Par
lor" next week. Drop us a line over
the week-end if you'd like to see 'em
run.
REX HARDY, ex-'37, is the only
salaried photographer of the new
magazine, Life, on the Pacific Coast.
Four of his shots of Robert Taylor
are in the first issue's layout on that
"boo-ful mans."

EX COMMITTEE IS A FLOP! It
isn't the good show it used to be in
the days of Bill Rogers, Frank Ful
lenwider, Bob Gros, and the other
old timers. Formerly, the weekly Ex
Committee meeting was better than
a Paly show. I wouldn't have
missed one. Now I never go. The
boys and girls in office today are
rank amateurs! They haven't the
quick wit, the ribald humor, the
j subtle sense of timing, that all good
comedians, and Ex Committee mem
bers, possess. What Ex Committee
needs is a good injection of show
manship!

In order to retain the lease on the

operator is obliged to give a daily
performance. The lease doesn't
specify what kind or length of per
formance.
Every day during the five years
that the theater has been dark, A. E.
Wetherbee has opened the box of
fice, purchased a ticket, dropped it
in the chopper, started a recording,
listened to it. Then he closed the
theater and went home. Wetherbee
holds the lease.
The theater is open now, so its one
man audience is on a vacation.
GAIETIES TUNES evidently made
a hit with the campus. Several per
sons have asked The Daily to print
the lyrics to some of the better songs.
