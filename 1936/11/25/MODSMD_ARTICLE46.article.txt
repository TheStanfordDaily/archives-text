WHAT'S TIIE SCORE?
The Editor, Sir:
"Dink" Templeton, Stanford's
peerless prognosticator, has finally
erred.
In the Sporting Green last Friday,
he ehallengingly pieked Stanford's
"Fighting Fools" to trounce "Poor"
Cal 26-7, whereupon "Poor" Cal
turned around and picked "Dink" in
stead, 20-0.
Now "Dink" has a friendly enemy
at Cal named "Brick" Morse, who
also predicts 'em. But "Brick" has
guessed wrong so often that he's
finally worried every red hair off

his head, and hence lost the right to
his nick-name.
Under these circumstances, 1
| humbly suggest switching nick
j names. Thus we have "Dink" Morse
I and "Brick" Templeton. Come to
think of it, "Brick" would be a swell
J nick-name for Stanford's Templeton
| now 'cause even though he's no ti
tian, his face ought to be red for
j some time.
What was that score, "Dink"?—l
