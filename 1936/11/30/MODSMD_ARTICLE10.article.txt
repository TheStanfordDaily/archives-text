# Cramming for the Finals
## 
### 
WOME slay up all night. Some go
to bed by ten. Some outline the
text. Some bull session far into the
morning. But whatever the method,
college students are apt to disregard
every fundamental rule of learning
when finals begin.
What's more, Phi Betes show as
many idiosyncrasies in their pre-ex
"cram" sessions as the probation
aries. If you're counting on raising
your average by a night-before study
session, here are the best and worst
ways to go about it, compiled from a
synthesized survy of how psychol
ogists say studnts ought to study and
how thy actually do:
First, be sure that you'll flunk if
you don't learn the course in eight
hours flat. That provides motivation,
and raises the whole level of learn
ing. Psychologists' experiments have
proved that the rapid learner also re
tains material better, exploding the
age-old fallacy that the plodding
method is the most efficient.
Recitation Helps
Recitation helps. But the sleepy
groups of "bull-sessioners" are prob
ably going about it the wrong way.
About 40 per cent of time should be
used in reading, the rest in some
form of recitation. The campus bears
out this theory, for the higher the
bawl-out average, the less the re
liance on bull-sessioning. "Waste of
time," agreed two Phi Betes. "The
more you know the less you get out
of it."
Their ideal method is condensing
the material they've read into brief
notes, in their own words. And it's
psychologically sound. "But don't
just copy sentences that don't mean
anything to you,' 'they warn. Eight
hours per medium-sized textbook,
plus two hours for classroom notes,
was their estimate for reading ;.nd
learning.
The low point of fatigue comes at
about three in the morning, agreed
crammers. This doesn't mean that
you have to give up and go to sleep.
A "second wind" comes to the stu
dent as well as to the track man.
All Work Makes Jack —
Rest periods should be taken —
short frequent ones are better than
long. And they should consist of
complete relaxation, not another
form of study.
Major premise of the Gestalt school
is that learning should be "whole"
rather than "part." Read the entire
thing—if necessary, re-read it. Don't
memorize one small fact after an
other. Get the idea and the relation
of one part to another. If you find
yourself cramming irrelevant and.
unrelated details, ask yourself
"Why? How is it related to the
point?"
The sandwich-eaters and the mid
night-feeders have (he wrong idea,
say psychologists. Hunger stimulates
mental effort. As for stimulants —
coffee, caflein pills, coca cola, No-
