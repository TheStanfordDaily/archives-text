# Cramming for the Finals
## 
### 
WOME slay up all night. Some go
to bed by ten. Some outline the
text. Some bull session far into the
morning. But whatever the method,
college students are apt to disregard
every fundamental rule of learning
when finals begin.
What's more, Phi Betes show as
many idiosyncrasies in their pre-ex
"cram" sessions as the probation
aries. If you're counting on raising
your average by a night-before study
session, here are the best and worst
ways to go about it, compiled from a
synthesized survy of how psychol
ogists say studnts ought to study and
how thy actually do:
First, be sure that you'll flunk if
you don't learn the course in eight
hours flat. That provides motivation,
and raises the whole level of learn
ing. Psychologists' experiments have
proved that the rapid learner also re
tains material better, exploding the
age-old fallacy that the plodding
method is the most efficient.
Recitation Helps
Recitation helps. But the sleepy
groups of "bull-sessioners" are prob
ably going about it the wrong way.
About 40 per cent of time should be
used in reading, the rest in some
form of recitation. The campus bears
out this theory, for the higher the
bawl-out average, the less the re
liance on bull-sessioning. "Waste of
time," agreed two Phi Betes. "The
more you know the less you get out
of it."
Their ideal method is condensing
the material they've read into brief
notes, in their own words. And it's
psychologically sound. "But don't
just copy sentences that don't mean
anything to you,' 'they warn. Eight
hours per medium-sized textbook,
plus two hours for classroom notes,
was their estimate for reading ;.nd
learning.
The low point of fatigue comes at
about three in the morning, agreed
crammers. This doesn't mean that
you have to give up and go to sleep.
A "second wind" comes to the stu
dent as well as to the track man.
All Work Makes Jack —
Rest periods should be taken —
short frequent ones are better than
long. And they should consist of
complete relaxation, not another
form of study.
Major premise of the Gestalt school
is that learning should be "whole"
rather than "part." Read the entire
thing—if necessary, re-read it. Don't
memorize one small fact after an
other. Get the idea and the relation
of one part to another. If you find

"Why? How is it related to the

The sandwich-eaters and the mid
night-feeders have (he wrong idea,
say psychologists. Hunger stimulates
mental effort. As for stimulants —
coffee, caflein pills, coca cola, No-
Do/.e, all have their advocates on the
cr.mpus, with coffee leading the field,
It has been proved that caffein ac
tually helps efficiency, for about two
to four hours. Large doses may re
tard motor co-ordination — which is
the main objection to No-Dozes and
caffein pills. "Makes you so jittery
you can't write," condemned one
co-ed. Strychnine and cocaine, also
listed as stimulants but not in use
on the campus, have a depressing
after-effect that coffee does not.
Smoking one cigarette after an

show that your pulse rate increases,
but so does your resistance to fatigue.
Claims of co-eds that it "keeps them

more painless, also makes it more in

learn it.
Ideal conditions vary. Some stu
dents can learn better with the radio

on. "Louis Armstrong records are
better than coffee at three in the
morning," they claim. Professors,
shows a survey, need optimum con
ditions for learning, while the young
er generation can often cram in a
crowded room, because they're used
to it. Textbooks can't help you on
that. You're the best judge as to
where you should study.

learn it.
Ideal conditions vary. Some stu

shows a survey, need optimum con

crowded room, because they're used
to it. Textbooks can't help you on
that. You're the best judge as to
where you should study.

In 1930 the people of Iceland cele

WOME slay up all night. Some go

college students are apt to disregard
every fundamental rule of learning
when finals begin.
What's more, Phi Betes show as
many idiosyncrasies in their pre-ex
"cram" sessions as the probation
aries. If you're counting on raising
your average by a night-before study
session, here are the best and worst
ways to go about it, compiled from a
synthesized survy of how psychol
ogists say studnts ought to study and
how thy actually do:
First, be sure that you'll flunk if
you don't learn the course in eight
hours flat. That provides motivation,
and raises the whole level of learn
ing. Psychologists' experiments have
proved that the rapid learner also re
tains material better, exploding the
age-old fallacy that the plodding
method is the most efficient.
Recitation Helps
Recitation helps. But the sleepy
groups of "bull-sessioners" are prob
ably going about it the wrong way.
About 40 per cent of time should be
used in reading, the rest in some
form of recitation. The campus bears
out this theory, for the higher the
bawl-out average, the less the re
liance on bull-sessioning. "Waste of
time," agreed two Phi Betes. "The
more you know the less you get out
of it."
Their ideal method is condensing
the material they've read into brief
notes, in their own words. And it's
psychologically sound. "But don't
just copy sentences that don't mean
anything to you,' 'they warn. Eight
hours per medium-sized textbook,
plus two hours for classroom notes,
was their estimate for reading ;.nd
learning.
The low point of fatigue comes at
about three in the morning, agreed
crammers. This doesn't mean that
you have to give up and go to sleep.
A "second wind" comes to the stu

All Work Makes Jack —
Rest periods should be taken —
short frequent ones are better than
long. And they should consist of
complete relaxation, not another
form of study.
Major premise of the Gestalt school
is that learning should be "whole"

The sandwich-eaters and the mid

It has been proved that caffein ac
