In general, two aims should be
sought: to support the university's
reputation as a great vocational insti
tute, and to open the field of the arts,
without which any institution of
learning leans toward barbarous
pedantry. To these ends—
1. Certain of the finest vocational
divisions, such as anatomy and bac
teriology, with the accompanying de
partments, should be decently hous
ed in modern laboratories instead of
huddling in tenements behind the
museum.
2. The great general laboratories
of learning, the library and the mu
seum, should receive immense
grants; at present they barely con
trive to keep going, and acquisition is
extremely difficult. Without a sound
ly supported library a university is
nothing, and can command the serv
ices of few men of repute. Universi
ties began around libraries; at pres
ent they surround science laborator
ies almost exclusively.
3. The division of the arts should
be developed in connection with the
school of letters; the new theater
will be the first connection. The de
partments should include the follow
ing:
(a) A division of art and archae
ology) in which the beginnings of
culture should be studied by means
of research and by means of expedi
tions to the nearby fields for such
studies in New Mexico and Mexico.
(b) The division should work with
the thentor as an active laboratory in
the history of culture. The stage has
always been the center of civilization
in all highly developed races, and it
should be a large pari of the business
of the new theater lo keep ;ilive and
active the studies in the historical
aspects of drama.
(c) The dance, which was orig
inally one with story telling and act

ing, should be developed as a crea
tive department as well as a division
in historical research.
(d) Music, especially the theory
and history of music. Eventually
production of musical works may be

possible in connection with the the
ater.
4. Fellowships, none to be for less
than $1200 a year, in any of these
fields. A graduate on the present
fellowships is a wretched starveling,
and advanced work is coming more
and more to be one of two deplorable
situations: either graduates must be
moneyed already, and hence not al
ways likely to be ambitious, or aware
of the experiences of those whom
they will teach; or they must drag on
year after year pinched for money,
unable to gratify the simplest re
quirements of the cultivated mind,
unable ot live normal married lives,
unable to be much beyond learned
monks without the discipline and
conviction of the true monastic life.
Neither type is fit to direct the culti
vated life of the next generations.
Note: I take it I have made clear
my belief that research is not every
thing in a university; that its aim
and end is cultivation, not informa
tion merely; that information is but
a handmaiden of cultivation; that
learning of a skill—no matter how

high a skill—is a training in vocation,
not necessarily a means to cultiva
tion; that information (research) and
skill (vocational development) are
the means to approach cultivation,
but that the only sure way to have
the younger generations attain it is
to have them live among and be led
by cultivated professors. Hence
10. Higher salaries all round, ease
of living, travel, ability to own a few
fine things and to see many of them.
