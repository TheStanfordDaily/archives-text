''Was College Worth While?"
Sportswriter John R. Tunis in a
book of that title surveying the ac
complishments of the Class of 1911 at
Harvard answers in the negative.
Twenty-five years after they had
graduated from Harvard, Mr. Tunis
found that one-eighth of his class
mates were supported by the govern
ment; some were unable to spell the
name of the president of their uni
versity; and their average annual
earnings were under $4500.
Among the class, Mr. Tunis dis
covered a past National Commander
of the American Legion, a tramp who
had not slept in a bed for 5 years, the
proprietor of a filling station, a
former pi-esident of the New York
Stock Exchange, the president of a
university, owners of lunch carts,
and members of the Harvard Club
of Sing Sing.
From a group of names picked at
random including four groups—Phi
Betes, Clubmen, average men, and

athletes—Mr. Tunis observed that
they lined up financially in this order
25 years after they left college de
spite the fact that the athletes were
the moneyed group during their col
lege years.
The class was practically void of
artists, musicians, or great writers,
exceptions being a poet, a historian,
a Greek scholar, and a student in
drama now at work in Hollywood.
The class contributed no leaders in

public life and lacked pioneers in any
field. Greatest success was achieved
in the fields of medicine, engineer
ing. and education.
"Was a college education necessary
to sell stocks, bonds, insurance, or
real estate, to be an investment coun
sel or an interior decorator?" Mr.
Tunis asks. "The lamp of learning
has at last produced a group of men
whose chief ambitions, if their rec
ord tells the truth, are to vote the
Republican ticket, to keep out of tlie
bread line, and to break 100 at golf.
Does one need to go to college to
have such aspirations?"

A short course, "Tractor Meth- I
ods,'' which will be given for four
weeks ,beginning January 4, by the j
department of agricultural engi- ;
neering at Washington State, is i
stated to be open to anyone who j
wishes to enroll, regardless of pre
vious education.
