# An Alumnus' Perspective

### L. M. KLAUBER 
time some investigator for
the '"National Academy for the
Determination of Why Society is a
Total Loss," or some such organiza
tion, goes into college athletics and
comes out with a 200-page x-eport
and a clothes pin on his nose, the
press has a spasm. Personally, I do
not give a whoop—no, not even
three-tenths of a whoop.
Let's look into this alumni interest
in athletics, this coiTuption of inno
cent youth through the old guards'
insistence on a winning team. What
is behind it?
Natural Interest-
Analysis will show it to be only a
rather natural and commendable in
terest in the old Quad, Campanile,
Yard, or what have you. You may
say it should have a better outlet,
but constructive criticism is not so
easy..
What are the average alumnus'
contacts with Alma Mater and her
present doings? He is too far away
and too busy to maintain contact
with the campus and its activities.
Even when there is a 25-year reunion
he only meets a lot of people whom
he might recognize if he has a 1910
Quad for ready reference. These
forced Get-Togethers hardly better
one's acquaintance with the living
college.
Most alumni have no way of keep
ing in touch with the University's
principal reason for being: the bet
terment, if any, of current youth. He
cannot even maintain contact with its
great essential sideline, research.
Academic Limitations
If Professor Carroll of the Ryan
Lab publishes a revolutionary paper
entitled "Coronaless Conductors,"
the alumnus will hear about it, and
be duly impressed, only if this hap
pens to be his line of activity. Or,
should Dr. Twitty describe two new
species of "Triturus" from Mendo
cino County, he may know of this
also, if, perchance, salamanders are
his avocation. But the flow of papers
from Psych, Pure Math, and other
departments unexplored in his un
dergraduate days, will go out via
channels of which he has never heard
and wouldn't understand if he had.
What then is more natural than a
continued interest in the one under
graduate activity which holds the
undergraduates together — the only
universal one. I concede that a vio
lent and absorbing interest in de

bates, economic conferences, or sym
posiums entitled "The Nearness of
the Far East," would be preferable,
if they could be so engineered as to
arouse an equally widespread under
graduate interest; but they don't and
won't.
Lesser of Evils
With all of the obvious faults of
college athletics, its over-emphasis
of certain kinds of success, its occa
sional taint of professionalism, I still
think it is largely a beneficial force,
both on the present day students and
the one who comes back once a year
to see a game. Incidentally, the con
tinued interest of an alumnus shows
that in his undergraduate days he
was an undergraduate, which is a lot
more than can be said for some. Oc
casionally this interest may ripen in
to a new Museum of Vertebrate Zo
ology, or aji Annex to the Law Li
brary, so let it be encouraged.
