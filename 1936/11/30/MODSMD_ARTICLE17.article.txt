# Columbia Beats Stanford On Frozen Gridiron, 7-0
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Having a touchdown thrown at
them on the opening kick-off, and
unable to push their offense into
scoring position on the frozen
ground thereafter, the Stanford grid
ders rung down the curtain on their
1936 season by dropping one to Co
lumbia 7-0 in New York City's Polo
Grounds Saturday.
The Columbia game was the first
of two scheduled for New York as
sequels to the 7-0 win scored by
Lou Little's squad over Stanford in
the Rose Bowl in 1934. And a fitting
sequel this was, too; in that game, as
in this, the Stanford offense showed
worlds of power in midfield, but was
slowed down inside the 20-yard line
by weather conditions: soggy ground
in 1934, frozen ground in 1936.
The excitement started and ended
in the first quarter, when George
Furey of Columbia took Calvelli's
kick-off on his 25 and ran through
the middle of the Stanford team for
a touchdown. Unaccustomed to the
hard, frozen ground in which their
cleats would get no traction, the
Cards had difficulty getting to the
ball carrier through the efficient
blocking of the Columbia team.
Waldo place-kicked the conversion.
Brigham and CofTis Gain
Stone recovered a fumble on the
Lion 30 right after for the first Stan
ford threat, but Calvelli's passes were
not good. Stanford reached the 29
and the 36 in the second quarter due
to Brigham's excellent line plunging
and open field work by Coffis and
Williams, but again the touchdown
passes were not good.
Ferko recovered in the third quar
ter, and Stanford worked out of the
24 and the 35, but again neither
passing nor running would budge it.
Columbia did not cross the Stanford
40-yard line in the first, second, and
third quarters except for Furey's
touchdown run.
The final period saw more passing,
but of little avail with Columbia's
interceptions damaging all gained
yardage.
The figures went to Stanford, 6
first downs to 5, and 179 yards gained
to 151. Stanford gained 59 yards from
3 passes completed out of 32. and had
6 intercepted, while Columbia made
65 yards from 3 completed out of 8,
and had 3 intercepted.
Vollmer, Corey Outstanding
Joe Vollmer and Sid Luckman, the
Columbia tailbacks, were thorns all
afternoon, while Corey, the center.
Sehultze, left end ,and Wright, left
tackle were the best Columbia line
men.
Only 14 men played for Stanford:
Tsoutsouvas in his eighth straight
60-minute game. Ferko and Mat

thews, Callaway and Zagar, who,
incidentally, blocked three punts
during the day to put himself on the
eastern map, all wore tennis shoes on
the hard ground. Clark, and Stone
went full distance, were strong on
defense but found difficulty in ma
neuvering under Brigham's and Cal
velli's passes.
Backs were Hoos and Garnier,
quarterbacks, Vigna and Williams,
right halves, Cofiis, left half, who
time and time again gave the 35,000
spectators thrills by his open field
ball carrying, and Calvelli and Brig
ham, fullbacks.
