# Stanford Builds For the Future
## 
### 
the 190G earthquake, Stan- '
ford shook its head,-and started
to dig out from under. Its Library
and Gymnasium were in ruins, but i
the original Quad, except for the Me
morial Arch and the Church, re
mained intact. And except for the
necessary repairs and replacements,
the original Quad has remained the
same, despite the fact that the en
rollment has increased from 2,000 to
4,000 students, that the curriculum^

and the faculty have expanded along with it.
Since the earthquake, there has come the
Library, the Union. Roble, Toyon and Branner,
the Press, the Stadium the B.A.C. athletic lay
out and the Pavilion the Roble Gym, and
Lagunita. In April some time the New The
ater will be completed.
But the first major classroom building to be
erected in 30 years will start in January when
ground will bo broken on the new $525,000
Education Building.
Third unit in the second quadrangle, which
already includes the Library and the Alt
Gallery, the architecture of the Education
Building will imitate the Library's modifica
tion of the original, not the Art Gallery. Fac- j
ing the Engineering Building, the new struc- i
ture will occupy the opposite corner of the |
second Quad from the Gallery, will encroach

only.slightly on the present Library<
parking place. Added room for cars
will be furnished, though, when Ser
ra Street ,in front of the Theater, is
opened for diagonal parking.
It can be seen from Architect
Charles Allerton Coolidge's drawing
on the cover that the second quad
rangle as it is now planned differs
corsiderably from the elementary
ideas formulated by the founders.
On Coolidge's sketch we see fac
ility homes located where the Art
Gallery now stands, classrooms
where the Lifce is now, and land
scaping and homes where the Educa
tion Building will rise.
However, the change in plans is
the result of no temporary desire for
convenience, but is the result of
foresight on the part of Stanford's
visionary planners.
This new Quad is a consistent unit
itself; its theme: books. To the cen
ter of the block between Encina and
the Law Steps, God and endowments
willing, there will be eventually six
buildings. The Education Building
will have stacks with a capacity of
125.000 volumes. "Cata-cornered"
from this there will be some day the
Hoover War Library, with its large

collection.
Cramped for space in its present
quarters on the Inner Quad, the Law
School has one-third of its 4(5,000
volumes in the basement of the Ad
Building, and has been lobbying for
years for its new Law Building,
which would he built with its back to
the Library stacks and facing Encina
Commons.
Provided in the plans for the new
Law Building whose architect sketch
is shown on the front cover is a
Library to hold IfiO.OOO volumes. Not
provided, as yet, is somebody to pay
lor it.
Between the Law and the Eduea
iion Building, some day there will
ic a press building to house all Stan
ford publications, and, to conform,
orobably also will have its library
oward the center of the block.
The New Theater is but the begin
ning of the plans that Comptroller
\lmon E. Both has for the block be
woon Lasuen and Galvez Streets,
vhere the $. r >83.000 theater is Hear
ing completion. In back of the The

' ater, planting soon will be under
way, so that the new Amphitheater
1 may be ready for the Class of 1938
to graduate in. Dirt from the Palo
| Alot subway, from campus roads,
from Education Building Founda
tions, from the area east of the Sunk
en Diamond, and dirt scraped up
from the area itself will form a bowl
to seat about 15.000 people.
The planting, made possible by the
gift of $35,000 from Howard Frost,

» ♦
Los Angeles, will make the Amphi
theater a natural .wooded bowl, sod
covered and terraced, ideal for out
door symphonies, other artistic pro
grams, graduations.
Flanking the New Theater on
Lasuen and Galvez will be long and
rather narrow Art and Music Build
ings, giving the New Theater a re
cessed position as the nucleus of an
Art Quadrangle.
A fourth quadrangle would be the
area to the West of the University,
now kept comparatively free of
buildings, which will be known as
the Science Quad. Also included is
a plan to extend Santa Teresa Street
right through the S.A.E. house, con
tinue it out to form another Quad
rangle. use it to follow out the theme
of a Student Activities Quadrangle,
set by the Old Union. This would do
away with the angular streets by the
Bookstore, would level many a fac
ulty home, fraternity, or dormitory.
Most controversial, pbrhaps, is the
plan to eliminate the indiivdual
frame fraternity buildings and house
all Greek orders in several modern
dormitories in the Branner-Toyon
area. The dormitories would be sim-

i lar to the present ones but would
complelo a men's living-group quad
rangle. forming a court of the open
area back of Toyon and Branner, and
would centralize men's quarters near
Ihe athletic fields.
The University pointed out the
economies to be effected in central
ized steam heating and the utilization
of the now unused Branner kitchen
for all the groups, and remarked on
the safety of the fire-proof concrete
building in contrast to preesnt fra
ternity quarters.
The Greeks pointed out that, as in
the case of Yale, it might mean the
end of fraternities.
The controversy died when it was
definitely established that the Uni
versity had temporarily abandoned
hope of getting funds for the project.
That it has been temporarily aban
doned was established when the Uni
versity relaxed on its policy of fra
ternity building on the campus.
University policy is that fraterni
ties cannot erect new houses, can
only remodel. University authori

ties, however, winked four years ago
when Phi Delta Theta remodeled by
tearing down its old house, rebuild
ing around one upright left standing
in the corner. After the Phi Delts
came the deluge.
There seems to be no move toward
sorority consolidation even contem
plated. Some time in January con
struction of two new wings for La
gunita will be begun, but these will
house only 80 women, will be used

to give women on-campus living
quarters next year, eliminating Oaks.
The wings will run parallel to |
Santa Teresa Avenue, will jut out on J
both sides of the dormitory a dis- j
tance back from the front on a -line j
with the unit social rooms.
Financing will come, as in the case j
of Lngunita, from expected room rent i
and board money and from the add- (
ed tuition paid. Since the increase in j
number of students does not propor
tionately increase University aca- j
demic expenses, the tuition is bud- j
geted to pay for these dormitory j
additions.
But where does the money come j
from to build these other buildings?
The story of the New Theater is i
well known. From a War Memorial |
fund $167,000 came, most of the rest
will come from the students' quar
terly fees.
Extremely lucky was Stanford that ;
there was a great expansion in the
field of education during the first
quarter of this century. Extremely j
lucky was Stanford that she had as
head of her education department >
one of the leaders of American edu- !
cation in the person of Dr. Elhvood i
Patterson Cubberley. Editor of the j
100 volumes of the Riverside Text
books in Education Series, author of
others, Professor Cubberley invested
his earnings from his books in a sci
entific investment in the stock mar
ket. built up a fund of $525,000. which
he and his wife have donated ot the ;
building of the new Education Build- j
ing.
But how about the other buildings [
that are now only the visionary con- I
figurations of Stanford administra
tors? Where will the money come for
them? Most of them will have to
come from gifts.
Stanford's endowment took a lar
ruping during the depression, though
not as much as might be expected.
And Stanford's endowment has de
creased heavily in proportion as oth- |
er schools have increas- ) „ .
ed.

Very young compared
to other privately en
dowed universities, our
University finds its
alumni have not been
organized or trained to
the habit of dying and
leaving their alma mater
with their fortunes.
Recognition that Stan
ford needs organized as
sistance led to forming
of the Stanford Asso
ciates, headed by Harry
B. Reynolds, whose ac
tivities during the past
few years have been to
lay the ground work for
increasing the endow
ment.
An alumni organiza
tion, the Associates have
prepared many a bro
chure of Stanford's va
rious departments, ex
plaining where Stanford

| could use the money, and have dis- I
i tributed them around to various focal
I points.
As yet they have not made a defi
j nite drive for funds, so the test of j
| their effectiveness rests with the fu- j
I ture.
The thing is: Stanford has the
! grandiose schemes of the many j
i quadrangles with' a definite idea to
i future expansion. But does our eco
| nomic and social system point to j
♦ ♦

expansion?
Another plan for future finances is |
to develop the foothills back of Stan
ford for a subdivision when the pres
' sure of population makes it a very
j desirable residential area. Senator
] Stanford very wisely made the pro- j
! vision that none of Stanford's acre-<

age could be sold, but there remains
the very tidy sum of the University
could gather in from residential
leases. The development of the Bear
Gulch dam would lead the way for
ample water supply.

These are Stanford's grandiose
plans for the future. Space is avail

able for the laying out of quadrangles
clear down to Palo Alto. Stanford
has room and the careful planning
to expand gracefully. The question
is: we have continually built on the
assumption of an expanding econ
omy, the rising land values of the
frontier and of increasing population
pressure. But science is telling us
we may look for a stationary popu
lation in the United States by 1960.
>And science is telling us we may

look for a contracting economy. Where will
that leave the privately endowed university?
Where will that leave Stanford?
But Stanford has looked forward to dark
futures before. As President Ray Lyman
Wilbur gazed out of his office and pointed
out to me where this University was laid out
with uncanny foresight to provide for
growth, he may or may not have remem
bered the shaky days after the death of Sen
ator Stanford, of the suit to tie up Stanford's
I estate as means of settling a debt of the Cen
tral Pacific Railway. I wonder if he remem
bers the days of relief in 1896, when the suit
was finally settled, and the relief of the stu
dents was so great that Dr. Wilbur, then an
undergraduate, is reputed to have led a
group of comrades in painting the old post
j office red?

• Though buildings other than the
original Quad have been added by
the endowment, most of Stanford's
additions have come from other
sources. The B.A.C. helped, the stu
dents helped, the alumni helped.
Latest has been the gift of one of
the University's own faculty mem-

bers, who has donated the Educa
| tion Building.
No one individual's effort that has
brought about the University, but
rather the struggle and sacrifices of
a collection of various men, who
have submerged their personality in
the struggle for the realization of an
ideal.
