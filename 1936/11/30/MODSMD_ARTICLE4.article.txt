If Stanford should be given $5,000,-
000 unencumbered, I should want to
set aside the income of $4,000,000 to
stabilize the salary roll of the faculty
and to increase salaries wherever
possible. The income of the other
$1,000,000 I should like to see put at
the disposal of the members of the
faculty for the development of the
library and for research.
With the stimulation that would
come with a gift of $5,000,000 we
ought to be able to get an additional
million for the adequate development
of a School of Fine Arts, including
the Drama; and then $2,000,000 to
54.000.000 more for the building of
adequate; permanent, and fireproof
residence halls for the men of the
University.
