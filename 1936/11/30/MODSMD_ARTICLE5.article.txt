Perhaps I am biased on the subject
of the engineering department, but if
the University were unexpectedly
given 55.000.000 I would like to see at
least 52,000.000 of it given to the en
gineering department for research
and new equipment.
In a report to the President about
10 years ago I suggested that it would
lake about two millions to put the
engineering department really on its
feet as far as equipment and research
facilities are concerned. In addition
to equipment I would also like to see
a great deal more money available
for research fellowships for graduate
engineers.
Not since the early part of the
1900's has the Stanford mechanical
engineering department received any
new equipment except for a few ma
chines in the machine shop about 10
years ago.
To put the engineering department
up on the first class rating that it was
when the University started, I would
like to sec two of the idealistic five
million dropped into the lap of the
engineering department.
