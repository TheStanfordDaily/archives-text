It any friend of the University sees
a prospect of five million dollars be
ing given to it in the near future the
vision is a mirage. But were that un
likely thing to happen the annual in
come, if the five millions earned 5
per cent interest, would be only
$250,000, and that would he altogeth
er too small to lift Stanford to the
level of the first class universities
where she ought to be. She has been
delayed in reaching that level by as
suming several burdens in the last 20
years that she is unable to carry. If
these burdens were dropped as it
seems they should be, the annual in
come of the remaining part of the
university would at once he in
creased by about a million dollars.
Stanford could then pay salaries
equal to those of any university in
the country, and thus she could
strengthen her faculty. She could
also lower the tuition fee, and thus
be in a position to choose her stu
dents from among the best in the
country. She might be able to put up
some new buildings, of which she has
long been in need; and make <i more
complete and thorough renovation of
old buildings than is now possible.
What she would hiive done without
the money obtained for buildings
from the sudden and unexpected in
»Tease of the income obtained from
football is a subject that invites
speculation. With her greater income
she would also be able ot make
something like «n adequate provision
.or books. And, finally, she could be
gin to establish more scholarships
nd fellowships to help those bright
nl needy students who, even with ;i
lower tuition fee, would otherwise
not be able to come here. I have
great confidence in the intelligence,
loyalty, and generosity of the alumni.
Convince them that their alma mater
is no longer to scatter her forces but
is to concentrate them upon the un
dergraduate life for which our splen
did campus is so admirably fitted,
and of which the nation is in so
much need ,and support, in addition,
a reasonable amount of strictly se
lected graduate work, too little rath
er than too much, and they will flock
to her aid spontaneously and in large
numbers.

It any friend of the University sees
a prospect of five million dollars be
ing given to it in the near future the
vision is a mirage. But were that un
likely thing to happen the annual in
come, if the five millions earned 5
per cent interest, would be only
$250,000, and that would he altogeth
er too small to lift Stanford to the
level of the first class universities
where she ought to be. She has been
delayed in reaching that level by as
suming several burdens in the last 20
years that she is unable to carry. If
these burdens were dropped as it
seems they should be, the annual in
come of the remaining part of the
university would at once he in
creased by about a million dollars.
Stanford could then pay salaries
equal to those of any university in
the country, and thus she could
strengthen her faculty. She could
also lower the tuition fee, and thus
be in a position to choose her stu
dents from among the best in the
country. She might be able to put up
some new buildings, of which she has
long been in need; and make <i more
complete and thorough renovation of
old buildings than is now possible.
What she would hiive done without
the money obtained for buildings
from the sudden and unexpected in
»Tease of the income obtained from
football is a subject that invites
speculation. With her greater income
she would also be able ot make
something like «n adequate provision
.or books. And, finally, she could be
gin to establish more scholarships
nd fellowships to help those bright
nl needy students who, even with ;i
lower tuition fee, would otherwise
not be able to come here. I have
