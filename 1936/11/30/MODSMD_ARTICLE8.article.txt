# Harvard "White Men" And Stanford
## 
### FRED GRAY 
LOT of transferring is done to
x Stanford from other schools.
Every year the junior class is in
creased by representatives of Cal,
U.C.L.A., Oregon, and Southern Cal,
as well as smaller colleges all over
the country. Yale and Harvard are
usually in evidence. Often Dart
mouth, Princeton, Amherst, Vassar,
Smith, Wellesley come through. A
lot of light on what really goes on at
Stanford University can be found in
the comparisons made by us gents
from Cambridge and New Haven and
the sophisticated ladies from Pough
keepsie.
Harvard 'White Men'
Perhaps the most striking thing
about Stanford to me is its democ
racy. There seem to be no sharp
class distinctions or antagonisms. At
Harvard and Yale this is, not so.
Either you're a "white man" or
you're not. If you are, you're sup
posed to show it by sporting a crew
cut and a bow tie. If you're not, any
white man is taking his social stand
ing in his hands if he talks to you.
The Farm's informality in the mat
ter of dress causes some dismay on
the part of effete easterners. One
gentleman from a certain college in
Connecticut remarked that when he
first arrived he thought he saw sur
prisingly little of the Stanford stu
dents. "The only people about the
place," he said, "were a lot of odd
fellows without any ties on.
Another aspect of Stanford's dem
ocracy is the fact that a man's pre
college education isn't a life-and
death matter as far as his social suc
cess is concerned. Whenever ybu
meet anyone at. an eastern school,
you always ask him where he ."prop
ped." If the answer is Groton, St.
Mark's, Milton, Lawrenceville, St.
Paul's. Hill, Choate, St. George's, or
Middlesex -all well and good. Any
thing else is met with raised eye
brows.
Horn-rimmed 'Black Men'
Although this nice system of class
distinction is a pleasant luxury, it
often works out as quite an incon
venience. For example, since most
of the "black men" are earnest, stu
dious, horn-rimmed characters who
take their extra-curricular activities
as well ps everything else in a big
way, any white man who is interest
ed in dramatics, debating, finds these
fields so contaminated that he can
not enter into them with very much
self-respect. The result is that dra
matics at Harvard is a washout and

is kept going at Yale only by virtue
of the University's official interest
and assistance.
The question of outside jobs is a
different one in the East. The east
ern equivalent of that jovial, übi
quitous character and hail fellow
well met, the Stanford Hasher, is
usually a dark, downtrodden grind,
bitterly resentful of his lot.
The Farm layout is always a pleas
ant surprise. In Cambridge and New
Haven there are trolley cars instead
of Palm trees and factories instead of
foothills.
Eastern Benders
Co-education is a new one on
Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Prince
ton, and Amherst men. The natural
result of it seems to be that Saturday
evenings at Stanford seem to be

spent on dates rather than on stag
parties at places like Mcßride's in
ton fame, known to all Exeter and
Cambridge, Andy's in New Haven,
or the "Tent"' and "Raymor" of Bos-
Harvard men and all visiting teams.
Co-education also keeps a lot of
dates on the campus. Besides stag
benders, much Harvard and Yale
stepping out is done at deb parties
in Boston and New York. Stanford,
however, seems pretty loyal to the
home talent.
Another difference is in the car sit
uation. In most eastern colleges cars
aren't necessary, and only relatively
few students have them. Here al
most everybody drives. There's a
difference in the kind of car, too. No
matter how opulent or indulgent the
family is, the car is usually a Ford.
And you can't get away with any
thing white or yellow. It isn't done.
As for actual academic work, Yale
and Harvard men don't often go to
classes, which is a great shame, be
cause many of their profs, especially
Munn and Hopper of Harvard, and
Crawford of Yale, are superb lectur
ers. The general idea at Stanford
seems to be that courses are a lot
harder in the East. I'll believe it
when I sec it.
If you really want to read all the
books assigned at Yale, you're taking
on something, no question about it,
but both the academic center of the
Charles and the academic center on
the New York, New Haven, and
Hartford are full of tutoring schools,
which put out, well in time for finals,
dandy sets of notes covering all the
material in the course. They cost
$2.50. Books for most Harvard
courses cost at least $5.
Several Purdue students arc earn
ing their way through college as pro
fessional pallbearers. A local mor
tician pays them at the rate of $2 a
funeral.
In New York City it is unlawful to
carry a squirt gun.

Inventions for the discomfort of the
freshmen have slumped badly in re
cent years, according to reports from
the United States patent office. Back
in the '90's someone was patenting a
new torture device a day.

The registrar at the University of
Oklahoma proved statistically that
students with the thinnest wallets
get the most "A's" when two state
legislators complained that the $3
flunking fee is a hardship on poor
students.

"Hairbreath Hai'ry's College," a
hobo college, is being formed in
lowa by Harry, dethroned hobo king.

Co-education is a new one on
Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Prince
ton, and Amherst men. The natural
result of it seems to be that Saturday
evenings at Stanford seem to be

spent on dates rather than on stag
parties at places like Mcßride's in
ton fame, known to all Exeter and
Cambridge, Andy's in New Haven,
or the "Tent"' and "Raymor" of Bos-
Harvard men and all visiting teams.
Co-education also keeps a lot of
dates on the campus. Besides stag
benders, much Harvard and Yale
stepping out is done at deb parties
in Boston and New York. Stanford,
however, seems pretty loyal to the
home talent.
Another difference is in the car sit
uation. In most eastern colleges cars
aren't necessary, and only relatively
few students have them. Here al
most everybody drives. There's a
difference in the kind of car, too. No
matter how opulent or indulgent the
family is, the car is usually a Ford.
And you can't get away with any
thing white or yellow. It isn't done.
As for actual academic work, Yale
and Harvard men don't often go to
classes, which is a great shame, be
cause many of their profs, especially
Munn and Hopper of Harvard, and
Crawford of Yale, are superb lectur
ers. The general idea at Stanford
seems to be that courses are a lot
harder in the East. I'll believe it
when I sec it.
If you really want to read all the
books assigned at Yale, you're taking
on something, no question about it,
but both the academic center of the
Charles and the academic center on
the New York, New Haven, and
Hartford are full of tutoring schools,
which put out, well in time for finals,
dandy sets of notes covering all the
material in the course. They cost
$2.50. Books for most Harvard
courses cost at least $5.
Several Purdue students arc earn
ing their way through college as pro
fessional pallbearers. A local mor
tician pays them at the rate of $2 a
funeral.
In New York City it is unlawful to
carry a squirt gun.

Inventions for the discomfort of the
freshmen have slumped badly in re
cent years, according to reports from
the United States patent office. Back
in the '90's someone was patenting a
new torture device a day.

The registrar at the University of
Oklahoma proved statistically that
students with the thinnest wallets
get the most "A's" when two state
legislators complained that the $3
flunking fee is a hardship on poor
students.

"Hairbreath Hai'ry's College," a
hobo college, is being formed in

LOT of transferring is done to

Every year the junior class is in
creased by representatives of Cal,
U.C.L.A., Oregon, and Southern Cal,
as well as smaller colleges all over
the country. Yale and Harvard are
usually in evidence. Often Dart
mouth, Princeton, Amherst, Vassar,
Smith, Wellesley come through. A
lot of light on what really goes on at
Stanford University can be found in
the comparisons made by us gents
from Cambridge and New Haven and
the sophisticated ladies from Pough
keepsie.
Harvard 'White Men'
Perhaps the most striking thing
about Stanford to me is its democ
racy. There seem to be no sharp
class distinctions or antagonisms. At
Harvard and Yale this is, not so.
Either you're a "white man" or
you're not. If you are, you're sup
posed to show it by sporting a crew
cut and a bow tie. If you're not, any
white man is taking his social stand
ing in his hands if he talks to you.
The Farm's informality in the mat
ter of dress causes some dismay on
the part of effete easterners. One
gentleman from a certain college in
Connecticut remarked that when he
first arrived he thought he saw sur
prisingly little of the Stanford stu
dents. "The only people about the
place," he said, "were a lot of odd
fellows without any ties on.
Another aspect of Stanford's dem
ocracy is the fact that a man's pre
college education isn't a life-and
death matter as far as his social suc
cess is concerned. Whenever ybu
meet anyone at. an eastern school,
you always ask him where he ."prop
ped." If the answer is Groton, St.
Mark's, Milton, Lawrenceville, St.
Paul's. Hill, Choate, St. George's, or
Middlesex -all well and good. Any
thing else is met with raised eye
brows.
Horn-rimmed 'Black Men'
Although this nice system of class
distinction is a pleasant luxury, it
often works out as quite an incon
venience. For example, since most
of the "black men" are earnest, stu
dious, horn-rimmed characters who
take their extra-curricular activities
as well ps everything else in a big
way, any white man who is interest
ed in dramatics, debating, finds these
fields so contaminated that he can
not enter into them with very much
self-respect. The result is that dra
matics at Harvard is a washout and

is kept going at Yale only by virtue
of the University's official interest
and assistance.

Every year the junior class is in

Smith, Wellesley come through. A
lot of light on what really goes on at
Stanford University can be found in
the comparisons made by us gents
from Cambridge and New Haven and
the sophisticated ladies from Pough
keepsie.
Harvard 'White Men'
Perhaps the most striking thing
about Stanford to me is its democ
racy. There seem to be no sharp
class distinctions or antagonisms. At
Harvard and Yale this is, not so.
Either you're a "white man" or
you're not. If you are, you're sup
posed to show it by sporting a crew
cut and a bow tie. If you're not, any
white man is taking his social stand
ing in his hands if he talks to you.
The Farm's informality in the mat
ter of dress causes some dismay on
the part of effete easterners. One
gentleman from a certain college in
Connecticut remarked that when he
first arrived he thought he saw sur
prisingly little of the Stanford stu
dents. "The only people about the
place," he said, "were a lot of odd
fellows without any ties on.
Another aspect of Stanford's dem
ocracy is the fact that a man's pre
college education isn't a life-and
death matter as far as his social suc
cess is concerned. Whenever ybu
meet anyone at. an eastern school,
you always ask him where he ."prop
ped." If the answer is Groton, St.
Mark's, Milton, Lawrenceville, St.
Paul's. Hill, Choate, St. George's, or
Middlesex -all well and good. Any
thing else is met with raised eye
brows.
Horn-rimmed 'Black Men'
Although this nice system of class
distinction is a pleasant luxury, it
often works out as quite an incon
venience. For example, since most
of the "black men" are earnest, stu
dious, horn-rimmed characters who
take their extra-curricular activities
as well ps everything else in a big
way, any white man who is interest
ed in dramatics, debating, finds these
fields so contaminated that he can
not enter into them with very much
self-respect. The result is that dra
matics at Harvard is a washout and

is kept going at Yale only by virtue
of the University's official interest
and assistance.
The question of outside jobs is a
different one in the East. The east
ern equivalent of that jovial, übi
quitous character and hail fellow
well met, the Stanford Hasher, is
usually a dark, downtrodden grind,
bitterly resentful of his lot.
The Farm layout is always a pleas
ant surprise. In Cambridge and New
Haven there are trolley cars instead
of Palm trees and factories instead of
foothills.
Eastern Benders
Co-education is a new one on
Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Prince
ton, and Amherst men. The natural
result of it seems to be that Saturday
evenings at Stanford seem to be

spent on dates rather than on stag
parties at places like Mcßride's in
ton fame, known to all Exeter and
Cambridge, Andy's in New Haven,
or the "Tent"' and "Raymor" of Bos-
Harvard men and all visiting teams.
Co-education also keeps a lot of
dates on the campus. Besides stag
benders, much Harvard and Yale
stepping out is done at deb parties
in Boston and New York. Stanford,
however, seems pretty loyal to the
home talent.
Another difference is in the car sit
uation. In most eastern colleges cars
aren't necessary, and only relatively
few students have them. Here al
most everybody drives. There's a
difference in the kind of car, too. No
matter how opulent or indulgent the
family is, the car is usually a Ford.
And you can't get away with any
thing white or yellow. It isn't done.
As for actual academic work, Yale
and Harvard men don't often go to
classes, which is a great shame, be
cause many of their profs, especially
Munn and Hopper of Harvard, and
Crawford of Yale, are superb lectur
ers. The general idea at Stanford
seems to be that courses are a lot
harder in the East. I'll believe it
when I sec it.
If you really want to read all the
books assigned at Yale, you're taking
on something, no question about it,
but both the academic center of the
Charles and the academic center on
the New York, New Haven, and
Hartford are full of tutoring schools,
which put out, well in time for finals,
dandy sets of notes covering all the
material in the course. They cost
$2.50. Books for most Harvard
courses cost at least $5.
Several Purdue students arc earn
ing their way through college as pro
fessional pallbearers. A local mor
tician pays them at the rate of $2 a
funeral.
In New York City it is unlawful to
carry a squirt gun.

Inventions for the discomfort of the
freshmen have slumped badly in re
