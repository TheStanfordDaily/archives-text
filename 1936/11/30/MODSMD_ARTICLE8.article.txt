# Harvard "White Men" And Stanford
## 
### FRED GRAY 
LOT of transferring is done to
x Stanford from other schools.
Every year the junior class is in
creased by representatives of Cal,
U.C.L.A., Oregon, and Southern Cal,
as well as smaller colleges all over
the country. Yale and Harvard are
usually in evidence. Often Dart
mouth, Princeton, Amherst, Vassar,
Smith, Wellesley come through. A
lot of light on what really goes on at
Stanford University can be found in
the comparisons made by us gents
from Cambridge and New Haven and
the sophisticated ladies from Pough
keepsie.
Harvard 'White Men'
Perhaps the most striking thing
about Stanford to me is its democ
racy. There seem to be no sharp
class distinctions or antagonisms. At
Harvard and Yale this is, not so.
Either you're a "white man" or
you're not. If you are, you're sup
posed to show it by sporting a crew
cut and a bow tie. If you're not, any
white man is taking his social stand
ing in his hands if he talks to you.
The Farm's informality in the mat
ter of dress causes some dismay on
the part of effete easterners. One
gentleman from a certain college in
Connecticut remarked that when he
first arrived he thought he saw sur
prisingly little of the Stanford stu
dents. "The only people about the
place," he said, "were a lot of odd
fellows without any ties on.
Another aspect of Stanford's dem
ocracy is the fact that a man's pre
college education isn't a life-and
death matter as far as his social suc
cess is concerned. Whenever ybu
meet anyone at. an eastern school,
you always ask him where he ."prop
ped." If the answer is Groton, St.
Mark's, Milton, Lawrenceville, St.
Paul's. Hill, Choate, St. George's, or
Middlesex -all well and good. Any
thing else is met with raised eye
brows.
Horn-rimmed 'Black Men'
Although this nice system of class
distinction is a pleasant luxury, it
often works out as quite an incon
venience. For example, since most
of the "black men" are earnest, stu
dious, horn-rimmed characters who
take their extra-curricular activities
as well ps everything else in a big
way, any white man who is interest
ed in dramatics, debating, finds these
fields so contaminated that he can
not enter into them with very much
self-respect. The result is that dra
matics at Harvard is a washout and

is kept going at Yale only by virtue
of the University's official interest
and assistance.
The question of outside jobs is a
different one in the East. The east
ern equivalent of that jovial, übi
quitous character and hail fellow
well met, the Stanford Hasher, is
usually a dark, downtrodden grind,
bitterly resentful of his lot.
The Farm layout is always a pleas
ant surprise. In Cambridge and New
Haven there are trolley cars instead
of Palm trees and factories instead of
foothills.
Eastern Benders
Co-education is a new one on
Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Prince
ton, and Amherst men. The natural
result of it seems to be that Saturday
evenings at Stanford seem to be

spent on dates rather than on stag
parties at places like Mcßride's in
ton fame, known to all Exeter and
Cambridge, Andy's in New Haven,
or the "Tent"' and "Raymor" of Bos-
Harvard men and all visiting teams.
Co-education also keeps a lot of
dates on the campus. Besides stag
benders, much Harvard and Yale
stepping out is done at deb parties
in Boston and New York. Stanford,
however, seems pretty loyal to the
home talent.
Another difference is in the car sit
uation. In most eastern colleges cars
aren't necessary, and only relatively
few students have them. Here al
most everybody drives. There's a
difference in the kind of car, too. No
matter how opulent or indulgent the
family is, the car is usually a Ford.
