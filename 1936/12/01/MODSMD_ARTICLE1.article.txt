## Inter – American Peace Conference Opened By President Roosevelt 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 30 (U.R).—
Franklin D. Roosevelt, first Presi
dent of the United States ever to set
foot on Argentine soil, landed in
flag-bedecked and festive Buenos
Aires today to open the Inter-
American Peace Conference which
he fathered.
President Augustin P. Justo and
his entire Cabinet were at the dock
and greeted him warmly when he
stepped ashore from the American
cruiser Indianapolis, which had been
escorted into port by a squadron of
15 Argentine warships.
President Receives Ovation
Thousands of spectators had been
waiting for hours under a hot sum
mer sun to see Mr. Roosevelt and
cheer him wildly in the greatest
popular reception the nation ever
has accorded a foreigner. Hundreds
of thousands more—the police said
the number might reach a million—
lined the five-mile route from the
North Basin to the American em
bassy.
Arrival of the Indianapolis and Mr.
Roosevelt was heralded by the
shrieking of ship sirens and whistles,
and by airplanes roaring overhead.
Mr. Roosevelt came down the
gangplank smiling. He shook hands
warmly with President Justo and
the members of his Cabinet.
It was an historic meeting. Wit
nessing it, in top hat and morning
dress, and full dress uniforms, were
Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who
had preceded Mr. Roosevelt to Bue
nos Aires; Sumner Welles, assistant
secretary of state; Alexander W.
Weddel, the American ambassador;
Spruille Brayden, chairman of the
American delegation to the Chaco
peace conference; Carlos Saavedra
Lamas, Argentine foreign minister;
Rear Admiral Eleazar Videla, min
ister of marine; the mayor and chief
of police, members of the diplomatic
corps, and the papal nuncio.
Crowds Break Police Guard
At the Customs House, the dense
crowd, anxious to catch a glimpse of
Mr. Roosevelt, broke through the
police lines and surged toward the
presidential automobile. The crush
of the crowd broke the windshield
of the U.S. Secret Service car. This
caused a slight delay before the
procession could start.
In the presidential machine, Presi
dent Roosevelt sat between President
Justo on his left and his son, James,
who was attired in a United States
Marine Corps uniform.
The two Presidents chatted vol
ubly, resorting to a mutual language,
French, as the crowd threw roses.

It was an historic meeting. Wit
nessing it, in top hat and morning
dress, and full dress uniforms, were
Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who
had preceded Mr. Roosevelt to Bue
nos Aires; Sumner Welles, assistant
secretary of state; Alexander W.
Weddel, the American ambassador;
Spruille Brayden, chairman of the
American delegation to the Chaco
peace conference; Carlos Saavedra
Lamas, Argentine foreign minister;
Rear Admiral Eleazar Videla, min
ister of marine; the mayor and chief
of police, members of the diplomatic
corps, and the papal nuncio.
Crowds Break Police Guard
At the Customs House, the dense
crowd, anxious to catch a glimpse of
Mr. Roosevelt, broke through the
police lines and surged toward the
presidential automobile. The crush
of the crowd broke the windshield
of the U.S. Secret Service car. This
caused a slight delay before the
procession could start.
In the presidential machine, Presi
dent Roosevelt sat between President
Justo on his left and his son, James,
who was attired in a United States
Marine Corps uniform.
The two Presidents chatted vol
ubly, resorting to a mutual language,
French, as the crowd threw roses.
BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 30 (U.R).—
Franklin D. Roosevelt, first Presi
dent of the United States ever to set
foot on Argentine soil, landed in
flag-bedecked and festive Buenos
Aires today to open the Inter-
American Peace Conference which
he fathered.
President Augustin P. Justo and
his entire Cabinet were at the dock
and greeted him warmly when he
stepped ashore from the American
cruiser Indianapolis, which had been
escorted into port by a squadron of
15 Argentine warships.
President Receives Ovation
Thousands of spectators had been
waiting for hours under a hot sum
mer sun to see Mr. Roosevelt and
cheer him wildly in the greatest
popular reception the nation ever
has accorded a foreigner. Hundreds
of thousands more—the police said
the number might reach a million—
lined the five-mile route from the
North Basin to the American em
bassy.
Arrival of the Indianapolis and Mr.
Roosevelt was heralded by the
shrieking of ship sirens and whistles,
and by airplanes roaring overhead.
Mr. Roosevelt came down the
gangplank smiling. He shook hands
warmly with President Justo and
the members of his Cabinet.
