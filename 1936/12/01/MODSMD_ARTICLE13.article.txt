# Construction Of New Bowl Progresses
## Project Half Finished; Plans Change With New Ideas, Conditions 
### JIM HURST 
Half finished in three weeks—
that's the record to date for the new
amphitheater, according to Building
and Grounds Superintendent James
W. McDonnell—and that's a speed
record for construction work on the
Stanford campus.
Half the 36,000 cubic yards to be
moved have been scooped from the
bottom of the big oval-shaped pit,
towed by the crawling "caterpillars"
to the top of the surrounding rim,
and dumped.
Grading Near Finish
By the time students have cleaned
up their finals and arc heading for
home the principal grading work on
the amphitheater will be done.
Shortly thereafter 6,000 yards of
top-soil, now heaped up on the for
mer site of Governor's Lane, will be
spread over the newly graded bowl,
and trees, shrubs, and grass will be
planted to catch full benefit of the
winter rains.
Plans Change
The plan for Comptroller Roth's
pet amphitheater is no set affair,
laid down months in advance and
beyond benefit of change or im
provement. From day to day, even
since the construction has begun,
changes have been made in the plans
to suit conditions arising and profit
by late-but-useful suggestions and
ideas.
Came the problem of what to do
with three large and flourishing live
oaks growing near the west end of
the area that was to become the
stage. Must they be destroyed?
Oaks Replanted
A few days before the merciless
tractors and scoops got to that spot
Mr. Roth hit upon the idea of leav
ing a small island of dirt around the
trees at the original level, leaving
a similar chunk at that level at the
east end of the stage, planting four
large oaks which had to be removed
from the center of the arena on the
more easterly island, and using the
screens thus made to exclude view
of the stage "wings" from the au
dience.
And at the same time another
problem was solved. These islands
would provide anchors for lighting
towers, which must be built along
side any stage, eliminating need of
large concrete foundations.
Theater "Fitted In"
"What direction docs she face?"
replied Mr. McDonnell, superintend
ent of the job, when queried as to
the orientation of the amphitheater.
"Why, the main axis runs about
north and south, with the stage-end
at the south. But she isn't square
with the compass, nor with the rest
of the campus either.
"You see, we sort of had to fit her
in here between the janitors' quar
ters, the power house, and the ad
joining streets," he explained. "But
she fits, and she'll hold 7500 people,
as planned."

Theater "Fitted In"
"What direction docs she face?"
replied Mr. McDonnell, superintend
ent of the job, when queried as to
the orientation of the amphitheater.
"Why, the main axis runs about
north and south, with the stage-end
at the south. But she isn't square
with the compass, nor with the rest
of the campus either.
"You see, we sort of had to fit her
in here between the janitors' quar
ters, the power house, and the ad
joining streets," he explained. "But
she fits, and she'll hold 7500 people,
as planned."
Half finished in three weeks—
that's the record to date for the new
amphitheater, according to Building
and Grounds Superintendent James
W. McDonnell—and that's a speed
record for construction work on the
Stanford campus.
Half the 36,000 cubic yards to be
moved have been scooped from the
bottom of the big oval-shaped pit,
towed by the crawling "caterpillars"
to the top of the surrounding rim,
and dumped.
Grading Near Finish
By the time students have cleaned
up their finals and arc heading for
home the principal grading work on
the amphitheater will be done.
Shortly thereafter 6,000 yards of
top-soil, now heaped up on the for
mer site of Governor's Lane, will be
spread over the newly graded bowl,
and trees, shrubs, and grass will be
planted to catch full benefit of the
winter rains.
Plans Change
The plan for Comptroller Roth's
pet amphitheater is no set affair,
laid down months in advance and
beyond benefit of change or im
provement. From day to day, even
since the construction has begun,
changes have been made in the plans
to suit conditions arising and profit
by late-but-useful suggestions and
ideas.
Came the problem of what to do
with three large and flourishing live
oaks growing near the west end of
the area that was to become the
stage. Must they be destroyed?
Oaks Replanted
A few days before the merciless
tractors and scoops got to that spot
Mr. Roth hit upon the idea of leav
ing a small island of dirt around the
trees at the original level, leaving
a similar chunk at that level at the
east end of the stage, planting four
large oaks which had to be removed
from the center of the arena on the
more easterly island, and using the
screens thus made to exclude view
of the stage "wings" from the au
dience.
And at the same time another
problem was solved. These islands
would provide anchors for lighting
towers, which must be built along
side any stage, eliminating need of
large concrete foundations.
