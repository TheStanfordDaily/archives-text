# Gaieties Tunes May Be Plugged
## Ex Committee To Discuss Ski Club Recognition 
### 
Plugging of songs from the Big
Game Gaieties and recognition of the
new Ski Club will be considered by
Ex Committee in its weekly meeting
tonight.
Bob Mallett and Shirley Jpnes
have been sounding out the opinion
of the participants in the production
of the Gaieties on the subject of pub
licity for such songs as "Stanford in
Spring," "Picnic in the Parlor," "His
Excellency Cannot Be Disturbed,"
"Tain't Wrong," "Phi Beta Kappa in
Love," and "Book of Verses" and
will report on their findings. The
songs were praised by Carl Sulz
bach, in charge of try outs for the
California Hour.
If Ex Committee decides to publi
cize the numbers Ram's Head and the
song-writers will probably sanction
their being copyrighted. At the last
meeting Mallett expressed the opin
ion that the songs have a fairly good
chance of going over, but some of
those who took part .in the discus
sion thought, that little financial profit
could be expected.
Ex Committee will also consider
whether or not it should recognize
the newly organized Ski Club. If the
new organization is recognized; the
committee will discuss giving it
financial aid.
