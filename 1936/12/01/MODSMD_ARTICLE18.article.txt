# Big Shots Reveal "How They Do It"
## 
### 
If 33 hours a week of study, 56 of
sleep, and the remainder for classes
and relaxation is the allotment of
time of the average Stanford student,
how do the campus activity "big
shots" participate and still keep up
their foutine life?
In following up an article appear
ing in the Sunday Chronicle refuting
Ihc old rah-rah legend of the typical
big-.shot, 10 Stanford leaders were
asked how they co-ordinate well
rounded campus records and good
scholarship.
All but one of those questioned,
Student Manager Chuck Fontius, are
20 or 21 years old. two years younger
than most of their classmates. Ahead
of their fellow students in scholar
j ship, they find time to spend an av-
I erage of 4 1 hours a day on their
I extra-curricular activities. None of

them spends less than 15 hours a
week on outside interests, and Daily
Editor Irvin Jorgnesen tops the list
! with 65.
The hours they spend studying
vary as much as do the hours they
spend on activities. The average is
from 10 to 15 hours a week outside of
classrooms, while classes themselves
take up about 13 hours. Most diligent
student is A.S.S.TJ. President Jim
Reynolds, who studies about 30 hours
a week; most cursory are Annolee
Whitmore, managing edilor of The
Daily, and Chick Franich, chairman
of Cardinals, with one to five hours.
Reynolds likes to study at regular
times every day; Vice-president
Esther Pclton goes for days at a time
without cracking a book and then
settles down to 10-12 hours of study
at a stretch before an exam or a term
paper is due.

Though all these seniors have good
grades and want to keep getting
them, few will sit at lonely tables,
burning one lamp until the small
hours of early morning. The "big
shots" demand 6 to 8 hours sleep
a night, even before the hardest
finals. Cardinal Franich says, "I
never study late because it doesn't do
any good."
Betty Grover, straight A student
and Roble president, states that she
gets 8 hours' sleep before cxery ex
am. Chuck Fontius will stay up late
to prepare for an exam, but prefers
to get "up early in the morning to
write a paper.
If they do stay up late, most seniors
refuse to use stimulants to help
them keep awake. Three or four take
coffee or smoke. Editor Jorgcnsen
has three of his own: he likes coffee,
cokes, and love.

Student Manager Chuck Fontius, are
20 or 21 years old. two years younger
than most of their classmates. Ahead
of their fellow students in scholar
j ship, they find time to spend an av-
I erage of 4 1 hours a day on their
I extra-curricular activities. None of

them spends less than 15 hours a
week on outside interests, and Daily
Editor Irvin Jorgnesen tops the list
! with 65.
The hours they spend studying
vary as much as do the hours they
spend on activities. The average is
from 10 to 15 hours a week outside of
classrooms, while classes themselves
take up about 13 hours. Most diligent
student is A.S.S.TJ. President Jim
Reynolds, who studies about 30 hours
a week; most cursory are Annolee
Whitmore, managing edilor of The
Daily, and Chick Franich, chairman
of Cardinals, with one to five hours.
Reynolds likes to study at regular
times every day; Vice-president
Esther Pclton goes for days at a time
without cracking a book and then
settles down to 10-12 hours of study
at a stretch before an exam or a term
paper is due.

Though all these seniors have good
grades and want to keep getting
them, few will sit at lonely tables,
burning one lamp until the small
hours of early morning. The "big
shots" demand 6 to 8 hours sleep
a night, even before the hardest
finals. Cardinal Franich says, "I
never study late because it doesn't do
any good."
Betty Grover, straight A student
and Roble president, states that she
gets 8 hours' sleep before cxery ex
am. Chuck Fontius will stay up late
to prepare for an exam, but prefers
to get "up early in the morning to
write a paper.
If they do stay up late, most seniors
refuse to use stimulants to help
them keep awake. Three or four take
coffee or smoke. Editor Jorgcnsen
has three of his own: he likes coffee,
cokes, and love.
If 33 hours a week of study, 56 of
sleep, and the remainder for classes
and relaxation is the allotment of
time of the average Stanford student,
how do the campus activity "big
shots" participate and still keep up
their foutine life?
In following up an article appear
ing in the Sunday Chronicle refuting
Ihc old rah-rah legend of the typical
big-.shot, 10 Stanford leaders were
asked how they co-ordinate well
rounded campus records and good
scholarship.
