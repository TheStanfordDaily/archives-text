PLAGIARISM ON THE
ROSE BOWL
There have been intruders into the
Garden of Eden, and the latest one to
cat of the forbidden apple of knowl
edge at the center of the garden is
Texas. Texas, in short, has learned,
like Pasadena, to teil good from evil
and now knows that the cure for
most of their ills is an annual Sun
Bowl game on New Year's Day.
Without any man biting any dog,
(his bit is indeed news, for whoever
heard of the Sun Bowl game. It
smells suspiciously as though some
local Chamber of Commerce cooked
up the game primarily for the en
richment of the local merchants and
only incidentally for the glorification
of young American youth. Come an
other day and there may come the
announcement that Milwaukee has
organized a Beer Bowl game, or
Chicago a Pickled Pigs' Foot Bowl
game .or Portland, Maine, an Apple
jack Bowl game.

Now far be it from me to ever ac
cuse Stanford in general of ever hav
ing any pro-union principles, but as
ar as annual super-tremendous
gridiron classics go, we feel we have
; closed shop in the Rose Bowl af
' air and that the Sun Bowl outfit is
ust a scab trying to muscle into an
; !ready organized racket.
Even though Stanford has no per
* >nal interest in the coming Hose
i owl game, we feel a sort of sacred
; attached to the honor of playing
i it. Thus the intrusion of a couple
'.ore upstarts into our midst, namely,
t'.e Sugar Bowl game in New Or
i ans and the Orange Bowl game in
iami has been tolerated just be
t use there was nothing much we
c .uld do about it.
Their intrusion, with all the ob
\ )us!y copied names, has been a sad
ii ing. in a way. for us to take, for
1 ■ inevitable effect is that the Rose
I iwl game will soon be just another
f< • »tball game. Of course, we can
v. listle in the dark and perhaps con
\ ice ourselves that no matter how
r. my of the hoi polloi cook up
".Jowl" games, ours will be pre
eminent because of seniority.
That must have been what old
V alter Camp thought when the un
ii vited hordes of self-appointed ex
j; rts began to pick out Ail-American
t( a ins. The All-American board,
wnich claims some sort of authen
