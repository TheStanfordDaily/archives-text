# Perfect' Man Of Sororities Must Be Neat
## 
### R. B. JONES 
Whether the much publicized
"rough'' or the Hollywood smoothie
type of Stanford man makes the
stronger appeal to campus sorority
women has been hotly debated in
these parts for some time. Here is
what we found out the other day
when We made a survey of campus
sorority houses:
Alpha Omicron Pi's representative,
for instance, demands of her ideal no
money or automobile, but merely
(hat he must "be neat, especially on
dates, and he must be reasonably in
telligent as well as a good dancer."
Thetas Reply
From a Kappa Alpha Theta came
the opinion: Well, I want him to look
always like he is just out of the
bathtub," and from this she slipped
into a petty-drawing reverie about
how he should be a tall, big, and
grand athletic blonde, brains, good
dancer, smooth but not Hollywood
dresser, yes, and his teeth and sense
of humor must be definitely clean.
Then she got down to reality and
talked about the fellow she "went
around with."
Good Line Interesting
One more house down the Row, !
Alpha Phi's highest officer went into i
detail:
"He must have enough of a line to
make him interesting; I don't care if
he feeds it to 50 other girls because
I don't want to marry him anyway.
If he is middle height, intelligent,
and all gussied up when he comes to
see me, that makes him perfect."
The Pi Phi representative leaned

down the bannister in her baby blue
bathrobe, and after thinking for a
moment said in a puzzled manner,
"I can't think of the ideal Stanford
man; I've given up!"
