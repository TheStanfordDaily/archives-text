# Hoopmen Meet Y Team Today In Practice Tilt
## Scrimmage To Prepare For Week-end Games With San Jose, O. C. 
### 
In preparation for the second and
third practice games of the year, Fri
day night here against the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club and Saturday
night in San Jose against the State
College Spartans, Coach John Bunn's
varsity basketballers scrimmage to
day against the San Francisco
Y.M.C.A. in the Pavilion.
The workout will primarily give
the team a chance to have its second
contact this year with outside mate
rial, following the victory over the
California Aggies last week. Not
much is known of the Y outfit .
George Dixon will bring his Post
Street team to the Farm Friday also
in the capacity of unknowns, there
being as yet no definite information
on the personnel of the squad forth
coming. Usually a tough team for
any of the conference teams to beat,
in spite of the fact that it does not
get the regular practice that the col
legians do, (he Winged O crew has
each year a list of the graduated col
lege players on its roster. Last year
the team held Stanford's Hank Lui
setti to one point but forgot about
Art Stoefen and Howell Turne to
lose 37-25.
Saturday's game, on last year's
score, isn't doped to be a very tough
one, for the Cards trounced the
Washington Square lads 53-29. How
ever, that was a small, light team
they beat last year, but this year
Coach Bill Hubbard will have five of
the finest frosh players the Spartans
ever had to boost his veterans.
Among these are the Thomas boys,
one a rangy, colored flash named
Lloyd, who was slicker 'n goose
grease all season and as good a
guard as any on the varsity, and the
other a tall, lank fellow named Ivor
with lots of eye, speed, and defensive
ability, playing at center.
Captain Dinty Moore, still resting
with a cast on his left arm, will have
the plaster cracked off tomorrow,
they say, but it is doubtful if he
will play either Friday or Saturday.
H. B. Lee, the not-too-small guard
who looks like a midget when he
plays with the other boys, who aver
age about six -two, has been playing
in Dinty's place since the Irish lad
found out a while back that he had
broken his arm during the summer.
Fordham, Marquette, and Alabama
arc considered the most logical teams
to represent the East in the next Rose
Bowl classic.
