FIRST BOOR
TO THE LEFT
Yes, the wolves are here. Every
body has been saying all along, just
let Thornhill have a punk season,
and you'll see how long his popular
ity will last.
Well, he had a punk season, and
five different people I've heard sug
gesting that maybe we didn't pick so
well when Pop Warner left, and
maybe we'd better fix it up.
That's out, so forget it. Perhaps we
did have a punk season. To be
truthful, it was the worst from a
point score standpoint since the War,
and the War was 18 years ago. Was
Tiny responsible? Will he therefore
begin to roll?
The answer is no, twice no. In the
first place, his contract has two years
to run, and when it comes time for
renewal ,things will be much differ
ent.
In the second place, at this college
of ours it takes a three-cornered
howl to complete any wolfing job
that may be started—the Board of
Athletic Control is run jointly by
students, faculty, and alumni.
The students on the B.A.C. will
never speak against him. They've
played under him and they've read
his magazine articles. They know
he's as well versed on fundamentals
and strategy as the best of them, and
they know his straightforward,
open-mouthed, and lenient methods
of teaching the game are something
found in very few. The Stanford
football players, though never asked
to, would go through hell for Tiny,
and anybody close to Stanford foot
ball knows that.
The faculty has always been on his

side because he doesn't play the team
up as apart from it all, and because
he doesn't tread on anybody's ground
with strict training requirements.
The newspapers like Thornhill be
cause he's free and talkative with
them, g<->ing out of his way to give
them new angles and generally mak
ing himself as good a news source as
you can find in his trade.
Most of the alumni like him be
cause he's a good speaker, and
turned out three straight Rose Bowl
teams, and looks to the optimistic
side of things, and doesn't mope
around either before or after the
game.
And after all, Stanford is just
about even now. The Farm had three
good years with the "Vowing Sophs"
and now a lesser one with the
"Fighting Fools," the whole equating
to four seasons cf .875 ball, the which
quality Stanford has been producing
ever since Kerr and Thornhill came
in 1923.
Getting in deeper, you can see that
the second best reason for those five
defeats (first comes the new stiff
schedules this year) is the fact that
with 14 star ball players in the Class
of '36 (you hafta use your star ball
players, unless the score mounts up),
the continuity of turnover of first
stringers was ruined.
Where there should be about three
two-year regulars and six one-year
regulars on the line-up at the start of
each year, you find a different pic
ture when the whole team graduates
in one year.
So what are you gonna do, take
your wins all in concentrated years,
or spread them out over a period?
