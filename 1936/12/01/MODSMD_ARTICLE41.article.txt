# Huskies Beat Cougars; To Play in Rose Bowl Game
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
01' King Football, rapidly ap
proaching the last stages of his short
lived supremacy in the 1936 spoiling
world, went booming last week-end
to give proof that the King was still
"there" in all his glory.
Mr. James Phelan, who was
feelin' right pert, put in a long dis
tance call from Seattle to Pasadena,
and emerged from the phone booth
victorious, having dated that very
popular Miss Rosie Bowl for the
afternoon of January 1. Tea and
cookies will not be served.
All this, my fraands, on accounta
because Mr. Phelan's boys, the Hus
kies, did dirt to a group of country
men the Cougars. The mas

sacre, which showed the Cougars to j
be nothing but wee pussy-cats, end- j
ed 40-0. The gentlemen from Seattle j
displayed more power than they had
all season in scoring twice in the first ,
period, once in the second, and three j
times in the closing stanza. Even !
with that tremendous number of j
touchdowns, the poor Huskies had
one called back. Tsk.
The same day, down in God's j
country, the Los Angeles Coliseum <
played host to 85,000 fans, to say
nothing of two football teams, name
ly, the Uclans and the Trojans, who
"dog-fought" the first edition of their
"natural" to a 7-7 tie.
Rccord Crowd ,
Biggest crowd of the year, 102,000, |
gaped and screamed as the Navy tor
pedoed the Army mule with but j
three minutes to play. Although the
cadets outplayed the middies
throughout the game, the final count!
stood 7-0, because the old navy fight
and two tars, Bill Ingram and Sneed
Schmidt, ctauldn't be downed.
In the South, L.S.U. turned back j
Tulane's Green Wave, 33-0, and, in
doing so, established themselves as a
leading contender for one-half of a j
double-date with Rosie Bowl.
Sunday's game between U.S.F. and j
Loyola turned into a real thriller as
the Dons came from behind to twist ;
the Lions' tails 17-14.

The same day, down in God's j
country, the Los Angeles Coliseum <
played host to 85,000 fans, to say
nothing of two football teams, name
ly, the Uclans and the Trojans, who
"dog-fought" the first edition of their
"natural" to a 7-7 tie.
Rccord Crowd ,
Biggest crowd of the year, 102,000, |
gaped and screamed as the Navy tor
pedoed the Army mule with but j
three minutes to play. Although the
cadets outplayed the middies
throughout the game, the final count!
stood 7-0, because the old navy fight
and two tars, Bill Ingram and Sneed
Schmidt, ctauldn't be downed.
In the South, L.S.U. turned back j
Tulane's Green Wave, 33-0, and, in
doing so, established themselves as a
leading contender for one-half of a j
double-date with Rosie Bowl.
Sunday's game between U.S.F. and j
Loyola turned into a real thriller as
the Dons came from behind to twist ;
the Lions' tails 17-14.

Memorial Park, in Provo, Utah
honors World War heroes.
01' King Football, rapidly ap
proaching the last stages of his short
lived supremacy in the 1936 spoiling
world, went booming last week-end
to give proof that the King was still
"there" in all his glory.
Mr. James Phelan, who was
feelin' right pert, put in a long dis
tance call from Seattle to Pasadena,
and emerged from the phone booth
victorious, having dated that very
popular Miss Rosie Bowl for the
afternoon of January 1. Tea and
cookies will not be served.
All this, my fraands, on accounta
because Mr. Phelan's boys, the Hus
kies, did dirt to a group of country
men the Cougars. The mas

sacre, which showed the Cougars to j
be nothing but wee pussy-cats, end- j
ed 40-0. The gentlemen from Seattle j
displayed more power than they had
all season in scoring twice in the first ,
period, once in the second, and three j
times in the closing stanza. Even !
with that tremendous number of j
touchdowns, the poor Huskies had
one called back. Tsk.
