# Indian Tankmen Aim At Eastern Contest
## Finances Stimie Cards In Proposed Trip 
### GENE GEAR 
Members of Stanford's champion
ship water polo team have a hanker
ing to go eastward.
They have won the Pacific Coast
Conference championship and they
want a crack at the National Inter
collegiate title.
There is no national intercollegiate
play-off, but the Cards want to talk
(he N.C.A.A. into sponsoring a play
off between the Pacific Coast champs,
the champs of the Big Ten, and the
eastern champions.
If this can't be accomplished they
want to go back to the A.A.U. cham
pionships, open to any amateur team.
This aquatic struggle will take place
in New York City, and the Redskins
could probably go during spring va
cation.
The whole affair is unofficial,
Coach Nort Thornton stresses, adding
that all the action being taken is on
the part of the members of the var
sity team.
The biggest obstacle in the way of
"the greatest Stanford water polo
team in history," as Thornton puts it,
is finances. At present no plan has
been forwarded to the 8.A.C., and
A1 Masters is away from the campus.
Stanford, in winning this year's
conference championship, won the
title for the twenty-second time out
of 24 years that aquatic game has
been played. U.S.C. won in 1932 and
U.C.L.A. came out on top last year.
