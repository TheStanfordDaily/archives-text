# FARM LOOKS ON....

Loyalist forces still holding the fort
in war-torn Madrid began looking
forward again to keeping the rebels
out of the capital city and to perhaps
winning the civil war, as their de
fenses strengthened. There was the
certainty that 1000 new troops were
coming to reinforce the Loyalists.
General Franco, insurgent leader,
was jeered for his hesitancy, while
rebel soldiers wearied of their labor,
it was reported.
League of Nations went thr.ough
another spasm yesterday, and came
up with the decision that Germany
was trading in arms and munitions
in direct violation of the Versailles
treaty. A long report gave proof, ac
cording to the league, that Germany
wasn't playing marbles with them,
but no remedy was suggested.

An estimated million Argentines
came to say "buenos dias" to Presi
dent Roosevelt yesterday, as he ar
rived at Buenos Aires to open the
Inter-American Peace Conference.
Milling crowds broke through guard
lines in their fervor and were
roughly treated by police. The Presi
dent greeted them on his way to ex
tend formal best wishes to Argen
tina's President Austin P. Justo.
