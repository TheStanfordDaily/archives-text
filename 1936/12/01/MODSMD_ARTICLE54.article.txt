# You Turned the Tabby on Me

### 
Despite the Roosevelt election, the Literary
Digest seems to keep coming out. The last num
ber had an interesting little bi on The Daily's
football tabloid L'Etat C'est Moi which inferred
that The Stanford Daily was the only college
newspaper in the country to agree with John R.
Tunis' article charging various colleges with
maintaining a corps of mercenaries for football
players.
This is really guite fine. Being labeled as a
fiery editor would have made me a cinch to
go on the vaudeville stage, or write books on
Revolt on the Campus, a couple of years ago
before there were so many fiery editors. But
now that college editors all over the country
have awakened to the fact that you can't ap
proach a managing editor of a city newspaper
for a job without several wound-stripes in tilt
ing at the campus windmills (major windmill
being athletic professionalism), there is a defi
nite glut on the market of fiery college editors.
This would seem to indicate that the best way
to achieve the unusual and the unexpected,
these days, therefore, is to abandon sensation
alism and calmly go about a newspaper's busi
ness of revealing little glimpses of the truth
now and then.
If my reflective powers are correct, The Daily
unfortunately was one of the soberer journals
which attempted to explain away Mr. Tunis'
blast at Sanford in an edit the day before the
S.C. game and was therefore neither unusual,
unexpected, or fiery.
The Daily's Monday effort, on the other hand,
v/as a little dialectical materialism in an explana
tion of the forces which give rise to this phe
nomenon. Contrary to The Digest, the cartoon
did not infer that Stanford football players look
like apes. Rather, we are inclined to think that
Stanford's footballers look more like teddy
bears.
The phenomenon was that Stanford, with its
small student and alumni body, could maintain
for as long as it has its successful athletic rec
ord. The Daily's findings were that football was
a big business, that it had to be organized, that
i itercollegiate high-pressure competition had
taken it out of the classification of a sport, that
rlumni were fairly well organized into a talent
scouting system, but could be co-ordinated bet
tar. So what? That's nothing new. John R.
Tunis' article wasn't anything new either. Of
course the box office has prostituted amateur
sport. But who is to say what is amateur sport?
As long as the box office mob chooses to think
that the boys on the field are playing for the
fun of it, the glamour will remain. It is there
fore up to the colleges to maintain that illusion
as much as possible. The only remarkable thing
.'bout the athletic set-up, therefore, is that Stan
ford maintains that illusion so well that the play
ers even think so, and fiery editors do at times,
too.

The Daily's Monday effort, on the other hand,
v/as a little dialectical materialism in an explana
tion of the forces which give rise to this phe
nomenon. Contrary to The Digest, the cartoon
did not infer that Stanford football players look
like apes. Rather, we are inclined to think that
Stanford's footballers look more like teddy
bears.
The phenomenon was that Stanford, with its
small student and alumni body, could maintain
for as long as it has its successful athletic rec
ord. The Daily's findings were that football was
a big business, that it had to be organized, that
i itercollegiate high-pressure competition had
taken it out of the classification of a sport, that
rlumni were fairly well organized into a talent
scouting system, but could be co-ordinated bet
tar. So what? That's nothing new. John R.
Tunis' article wasn't anything new either. Of
course the box office has prostituted amateur
sport. But who is to say what is amateur sport?
As long as the box office mob chooses to think
that the boys on the field are playing for the
fun of it, the glamour will remain. It is there
fore up to the colleges to maintain that illusion
as much as possible. The only remarkable thing
.'bout the athletic set-up, therefore, is that Stan
ford maintains that illusion so well that the play
ers even think so, and fiery editors do at times,
too.
Despite the Roosevelt election, the Literary
Digest seems to keep coming out. The last num
ber had an interesting little bi on The Daily's
football tabloid L'Etat C'est Moi which inferred
that The Stanford Daily was the only college
newspaper in the country to agree with John R.
Tunis' article charging various colleges with
maintaining a corps of mercenaries for football
players.
This is really guite fine. Being labeled as a
fiery editor would have made me a cinch to
go on the vaudeville stage, or write books on
Revolt on the Campus, a couple of years ago
before there were so many fiery editors. But
now that college editors all over the country
have awakened to the fact that you can't ap
proach a managing editor of a city newspaper
for a job without several wound-stripes in tilt
ing at the campus windmills (major windmill
being athletic professionalism), there is a defi
nite glut on the market of fiery college editors.
This would seem to indicate that the best way
to achieve the unusual and the unexpected,
these days, therefore, is to abandon sensation
alism and calmly go about a newspaper's busi
ness of revealing little glimpses of the truth
now and then.
If my reflective powers are correct, The Daily
unfortunately was one of the soberer journals
which attempted to explain away Mr. Tunis'
blast at Sanford in an edit the day before the
S.C. game and was therefore neither unusual,
unexpected, or fiery.
