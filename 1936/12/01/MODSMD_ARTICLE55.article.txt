I never took a course from Madam Ida Stauf,
emeritus Romanic Languages professor who
died Friday. I only noted as I passed her, usu
ally walking by the Bookstore, the Continental
flavor to her dress: the broadbrimmed hat, the
ugh collar, which vignetted her in my mind as
unusual. More unusual, though, was Madam
Stauf to the students who did get to take a
course from her and got to know her as an
inspirational teacher.
One of these students, Mrs. Lillian V. Lesley,
has written this memoriam:
A woman of international interests, wide
sympathies and human understanding, who
regarded teaching as the highest expres
sion ot life, has just passed from us. Ida

Staut left, as she lived, quietly, with dignity
and simplicity. She gave her students
more than a speaking knowledge ot the
languages she taught; she stimulated am
bition, giving glimpses ot peoples and cus
toms, always stressing the best in human
nature and nations. An invigorating per
sonality that we who knew her loved well.
