The powers who decide such things have
declared no more Nitery this quarter because
the Union hasn't fixed up its A.S.S.U. social
rooms, and the Golf Clubhouse while very suc
cessful is too far away for the men without cars.
Now the Union Lobby isn't going to get fixed
up unless the Union Board of Governors meets
and decides to fix it. And unless the Union
Board of Governors meets and decides to fix it
pretty soon, it will be too late to do any fixing
before next year, and those who have labored
for the ideal will have passed on, and Stanford
won't have any Nitery, Variety to the contrary.
