SEX MAGAZINES—A SYMPOSIUM DIIR 111 l
We like to look at them, and did so when time
palled over Thanksgiving vacation, but we never buy
them. Ask Thurlow's, who stock them of social neces
sity, but who sell few to Stanfordites. It's not that
they're expensive, simply that it takes an admission of
salacity to pick one up and do more than furtively peek
at it—with a superior leer.
A glance at "Writer's Market" — compilation of
places to sell what you write—shows 18 publications
under the general classification, "Sex magazines."
* ♦ * *
All of which proves that science is grand. For not
only are there 18 dirty magazines, but 18 varieties of
dirt, as cai'eful reading of the classification indicates.
Relatively unknown is "Bedtime Stories," not car
ried by Thurlow's. Like Transamerica, it operates from
Delaware ,and unlike Transamerica, "uses risque, sexy
short stories 3,000 to 4,000 words in length."
"Breezy Stories" is the type of mag found in Aunt
Hattie's lower bureau drawer "with delicately handled
sex theme." A Mrs. Fedriss selects manuscripts.
Taking all comers, however, is Gay Parisienne, La
Paree Stories, Murder Mysteries (which coyly "encour
ages sex element") Pep Stories, Snappy, Spicy Detec
tive Stories, Spicy Stories, Tattle Tales and Sex Story
Book.
* * * *
They all operate from Delaware, and not one dis
claims the source of its profits.
But to prove human ingenuity unbounded, each
year sees the invention of a "new angle" in the strange
and seamy business of wholesale pruriency.
Time was when grandpa got his thrills from the
Police Gazette, first publication to use legs as legs.
Today grandpa need not i*ead anything so direct. He
can exercise his libido under many different guises.
For science has evolved a pill that packs both the
nobler thrills of fear and mystery, and just plain ex
citement, all within the covers of a single volume.
# * * *
The approach is a new one, probably started by the
movies who cloak what's entertaining and wrong in a
pall of stuff that is entertaining and nice. Thus, we
have, in addition to such modernized primitives as Pep
Stories, such refinements as "Spicy Adventure Stories,"
"Spicy Detective Stories," and "Spicy Mystery."
You will notice that sex has a co-star attraction in
each case. Alone, she is apparently not good enough
for top-billing. Which indicates that not only is science
grand, Delaware progressive, but that the eternal old
girl isn't half so good as she usta was ... or that
we're better.
