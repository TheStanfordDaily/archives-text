# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Just about the time Our Hasher had figured out what
to be thankful for, around came Monday and the
realization that Stanford has its own little Christmas
sock. Only 15 more flopping days before dizzinass.
At that time our end-quarter exes end and so forth.
What with turkey and dressing, and mince pie, and
turkey hash, and mince pie, and turkey soup, and mince
pie, Stanford students spent a pretty full week-end.
There's no full like an 'ole full. On the other hand
there's no foul like an old fowl. That's on the other
hand that is.
Thanksgiving is here to stay, which means that one
of us has to leave.
A couple of hasher§ in Encina Commons didn't quite
know whether to he thankful or not. It seems that they
I are Iwin brothers, and Mrs. Watson, up to her old ad
ministratrix in the Commons, came up to one of the
brothers and said: "Your father is here to sec you."
Then turning around and seeing the other hasher, she
said: "And YOUR father is here, too."
The two cuys looked at each other and blinked.
They said: "Migawsh. Mother never told us."
Seeing that this is the last week thi squarter Our
Hasher has to keep his nose to the ground stone, stu
dents can relax after Thursday and return to the Hearst
funnies without fear of having their filly follies ex
posed to public gaze in the newspaper .or the prune
juice. Get your elbow out of my shredded wheat, you
dope.
Facts have been gathered to prove that Union codec
is not a fruit.
It has been impossible to prove just exactly what it
is, however.
There's one nice thing about the Cellar dinners,
| they invariably have hii oversupply of whsit you don't
j want, and always run out of what you do want by <5
I o'clock. But strangely enough they never run out of
j cash registers or meal checks.
