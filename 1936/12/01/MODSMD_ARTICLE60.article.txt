# CAMPUS OPINION
## PAGING C. HAROLD CAULFIELD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I should appreciate it very much
if any of your readers in the San
Francisco region could give us any
information regarding the where
abouts of Mr. C. Harold Caulfield,
who as recently as April 30, 1936, was
president of the San Francisco Board
of Education.
On that date Mr. Caulfield made a
speech in San Francisco in which he
referred in a seriously unfair and in
accurate way to The New Republic.
The editors of this paper at once
wrote to Mr. Caulfield protesting his
statement, but have had no reply
either to this or to several subsequent
letters.
We take it for granted that failure
on the part of an important public
official to answer communications on
a matter of this degree of importance
could only be explained as arising
from long-continued absence from
the city or serious illness. Can any
one tell us what ever became of Mr.
Caulfield? Address: The New Re
public, 40 East Forty-ninth Street,
New York City.
Faithfully,
Bruce Bliven,
Editor, New Republic
