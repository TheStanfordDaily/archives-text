"A damn good idea," says Aleck
Brownstein, who clipped the follow
ing letter from The Chronicle Safety
Valve.
The Editor, Sir:
I suggest in regard to the Berkeley
C and the Stanford Axe, that Stan
ford construct in some suitable place
a large concrete axe, and that after,
instead of before the game, the win
ners proceed with due ceremony to
paint the emblem of the losing Uni
versity red or blue and gold, as the
case might be, colors to remain a
year, as a reminder of defeat and an
incentive to greater endeavors. A
good Indian can be stoical under tor
ture and the Bear growl in its agony

without scratching.
A bearskin on the floor or a scalp
on the wall would be more satisfy
ing than the bare memory of victory.
