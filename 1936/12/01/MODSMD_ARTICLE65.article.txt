"The Charge of the Light Brigade."
at the Stanford Theater.
American film producers seem
more inspired by British history than
by their own country's past. Though '
this moving picture is hardly history,
it is based on Tennyson's poem of
the same name, in its turn based on
an engagement that occurred be
tween the British and Russian forces
during the Crimean War at Bala- j
klava, near Sabastopol. Through a :
mistake in orders 673 lancers were
ordered to advance up a narrow val
ley flanked with Russian cannons and
men.
Warner Brothers give at least 20
minutes to the charge, which took
just that long; cannons thunder,!
horses and men are slaughtered in
what is probably not the Crimea at
all, but Hollywoodland. But you i
didn't think of that.
The first three-quarters of the film
is devoted to Warners' explanation i
of the blunder. Ever since thej
treacherous massacre of their women '
and children, fellow soldiers at Chu
koti by the Surat Khan, the 27th
brigade is "out for" that tribal chief.
When the Khan joins the Russians in
Crimea, the lancers are transferred
there. At Balklava Major Vickers!
(Errol Flynn) finally reverse orders
from headquarters to retreat, orders
the brigade to advance to avenge the \
Chukoti massacre, save Sebastopol.
Fine action photography; Olivia de
Haviland is as fragile and charming
as she was in Anthony Adverse;
British uniforms handsome.
I
Our Relations: Laurel and Hardy
are funnier than usual in the old
comedy of mistaken identity, romp
through boarding houses, beer gar
dens, shipyards, and telephone
booths tirelessly. Really good is the
dock scene in which the two sway I
and topple in the cement into which
their feet have been molded.
