# Plans for Union Nitery Wait On Roth's Return
## 
### 
Although Union Board of Gov
ernors investigated several weeks
ago the feasibility of converting
A.S.S.U. lobby into a casual dance
spot, nothing can be done toward
effecting the removal of office par
titions until Comptroller Roth re
turns to the Farm after Christmas.
Meanwhile the Nitery has dug
in for end-quarter finals and will
not be held any more this quarter.
In order to restore the Union
lobby to a dance hall, besides lev
cling offices, it will be necessary
to move several old-timer resi
dents living on the floor above.
President Jim Reynolds will
confer today with Union Manager
Christine Ricker and will report
findings to Ex Committee tonight.
