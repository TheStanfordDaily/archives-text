# Student Reports Waterfront Strike
## 
### 
Stanford is peering out from be
hind the blinds of its Ivory Towei
for occasional peeks at the big and
nasty San Francisco waterfront
strike. •
Last week the American Student
Union conducted a tour to the strike
area; tomorrow afternoon in Current
Events Class students will hear the
academic point of view of the strike
as labor movement phenomenon
from Hilden Gibson, political science
instructor. Gibson's theoretical
background has been supplemented
by a laboratory field trip to the
waterfront taken yesterday afternoon
when he sought out the working
man's viewpoint in the averns and
caverns, and discussed the official
viewpoints of the union officers and
employers' representatives.
When the A.S.U. took its trip,
ALLEN DRI'RY, Daily copy editor
went along and his peek from the
Ivory Tower resulted in this impres
sion by impression account
Tnur Planned
The thing to do, we were told by
the man who looked like an anarchist
ought to look, was decide- what ques
tions we would ask the various peo
ple we were to see. We'd ask some

on both sides, a certain number of
sfrikers, a certain number of the
employers. In this way we would get
a general view of the situation, he
explained.
The first place we went to was the
office of Mr. Lynn Fox. Mr. Fox is
the chairman of the publicity com
mittee of the Waterfront Employers'
Association. He is a short and earn
est looking man who says his words
very slowly, and likes to frown a lot
while he answers questions.
'Speak No Evil'
Did Mr. Fox know how much mon
ey the employers were spending on
favorable publicity and through what
channels they were receiving that
publicity?
Mr. Fox said no.
Did Mr. Fox believe that Com
munists were responsible for the
strike?
He did.
Oh, he really thought that, elid he?
Yes. he did.
Well, how did the employers get
their information? Did they have
stool-pigeons?
No. Some days previous to the
strike Harry Bridges had been seen
stepping from a taxi with Joseph

Cochran. That was how the employ
ers knew that.
Was there any likelihood of the
strike breaking? Would the employ
ers be willing to enter negotiations
with the strikers?
The employers were ready any
time the strikers were.
We thanked Mr. Fox very much.
In the elevator going down the man
said, "Did Fox tell you all about
it?" Yes, we said. Oh, yes.
The Union Recreational Center on
Clay Street near the Embarcadero
was the next stop. We went up three
floors in a jerky old elevator run by
a jerky old man, and then stood
around in front of a candy-counter
in an aimless group. Men wandered
in and out and looked us up and
down. Each wore a little blue but
ton: "Striker." We ate some candy.
One of the men asked us what school
we were from. We told him. "Oh," he
said, his voice rising a little. "Stan
ford."
I Presently they told us we couldn't
s>e Mr. Bridges. We were to follow
the man and after we had toured the
waterfront Mr. Bridges might bo able
to see us.
So we followed the man along the
Embarcadero, going as far as Fish-
erman's Wharf and taking in a soup-
kitchen. The kitchen was run by the
stewards from the ships, one of them
told us. He was quite an old man.
We hoped they would win their
strike.
"I think we will," he said. "We're
paving the way for you —for youth."
We went back to the Center. This
time we climbed the stairs, passing
the candy-counter again, and the
gymnasium. There were a great
many men playing pool, and several
playing basketball.
Contrast Noted
We went around the gym to a
little stuffy room with two windows.
The man who should have been an
anarchist pointed out to us carefully
how this room compared with the
"large, luxurious quarters" wherein
Mr. Fox held sway. We were all im
pressed with the contrast.
Three men talked to us. One was
a little man with a narrow, worried
face; one was a tall man with an
odd mannerism of letting his eyelids
flicker over his eyes; the third was a
big, good-looking Swede.
The tall man was so full of his
subject that he kept interrupting the
little man. Once he explained about
Brother Bridges. Brother Bridges
couldn't be there because he was in
conference with a Department of
Labor official. Another time he an
swered a question as to just how
much the strikers wanted from the
President.
"Just exactly as much as we can
force hi mto give us," he said.
Hardships Told
Once the blond Swede told us how
hard longshoremen had to work. He
talked very quietly and very intelli
gently. He sat down in a moment
and the tall man began to talk again.
Going down in the elevator we
asked the little old elevator man if
they were going to win the strike.
"I hope so," he said firmly, and
gave us a bunch of handbills.
All the way along Market Street
we stopped beside well dressed peo
ple who were waiting for streetcars.
"Here, sir," we said. "Strike infor
mation."
Then we drove on. It was more
fun.
"Here, sir. Strike information."
