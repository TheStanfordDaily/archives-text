# F.D.R. Urges Co-operation Of Americas
## European War Menace Necessitates Unity Of All Western Nations 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 1 (UP). â€”
President Roosevelt called on the
"American family of nations" today
to join hands in collective agreement
for economic unity and political
peace in the Western hemisphere
against the daily growing menace of
war in older lands.
The President, opening the Inter-
American Conference for the Main
tenance of Peace with a speech in
the great Argentine congressional
hall, appealed to practical co-opera
tion among all the peoples of all the
American republics.
Aggression Threat
"We in the Americas make it . . .
clear that we stand shoulder to
shoulder in our final deliberations
that others who, driven by war mad
ness or land hunger, might seek to
commit acts of aggression against us,
will find a hemisphere wholly pre
pared to consult together for our
mutual safety and our mutual good,"
President Roosevelt said.
He told the delegates from 21
American nations "each one of us
has learned the glories of independ
ence. Let each one of us learn the
glories of interdependence."
Commerce Stressed
Mr. Roosevelt, who inspired and
suggested the present conference,
emphasized that the "welfare and
prosperity of each of our nations de
pends in large part on the benefits
derived fro mcommerce among
themselves and with other nations."
"Every nation in the world has
felt the evil effects of recent efforts
to erect trade barriers of every
known kind," Mr. Roosevelt said.
"Every individual citizen has suf
fered from them."
