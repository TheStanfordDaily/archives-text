# Council To Try Book Defacers
## Library Will Stay Open Sundays for Finals 
### 
Honor code violation charges lie
fore Student Council will be the pen
alty for mutilating any book in the
library, Nathan Van Patten, director
of libraries, announced yesterday.
Tearing pages from reference
books has been increased lately, Van
Patten said, and until the offenders
are charged the department is help
less. Once accused, the full extent of
the honor code violation penalty will
be exacted.
P"or the benefit of those studying
for exams, the library will remain
open until 10 o'clock on Sundays the
rest of this quarter. It will be avail
able throughout finals, but will close
early on the last day.
