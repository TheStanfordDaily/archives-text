There has been no special increase
in Stanford's curriculum to meet the

there has been no special attention
given to women's interests. This new
course has designed to meet the
wishes of women students and alum

it will be required for courses
which will grow out of it, if it proves
successful. *

in the home and in the occupational
field. Lectures will be given by ex
