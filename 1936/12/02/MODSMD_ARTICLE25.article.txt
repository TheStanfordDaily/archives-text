### NANCY CARMEAN 
As a forerunner to the probable es
tablishment of a department for
women at Stanford, a new course,
"Women in Society," is being offered
winter quarter.
There has been no special increase
in Stanford's curriculum to meet the
increased advance of women, ac
cording to Dean Yost. Until now
there has been no special attention
given to women's interests. This new
course has designed to meet the
wishes of women students and alum
nae. There are no prerequisites, but
it will be required for courses
which will grow out of it, if it proves
successful. *

an's orientation to modern society,
including the review of her position
historically; some study of changing

in the home and in the occupational
field. Lectures will be given by ex
