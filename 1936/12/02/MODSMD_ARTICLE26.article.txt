# SOUR GRIPES
## AH! FAME! 
### 
The Oracle of Wong's Kitch has
been inhaling the sacred fumes of
boiling broccoli again and now comes
forth with the dictum that I am too
prone to accuse everyone of being
guided by ulterior motives.
Our Oracle, accustomed to speak
ing in pointless conclusions laid
down amidst a smoke-screen of
puns, noticed that within a week I
accused the Class of '40, Dr. Sargas,
the Budapest man of honor who
booked 50 more duels since last I
spoke of him, and several Chambers
of Commerce of being publicity
hounds. Thus the Oracle concludes
that I think everyone acts with more
than a casual eye to what people
think.
* * *
Now I would hate to be called a
youthful cynic, for if there are, as
the Oracle points out, an overabund
ance of fiery college editors, they are
indeed infinitesimal in number com
pared to the chirping horde of youth
ful know-it-alls who have seen the
world .or at least have been in seven
tates not counting Mexico and R?no
Nevada, and are tired of this life.
At the same time. I must raise my
' ead over the edge of the cradle and
ay that I think what most people
alue above all else .is recognition,
y recognition I do not mean con
>icuous glory, for there are only a
'• w people, relatively speaking, who
rive with heart and soul for pub
-1 ity and save all press clippings
< .ncerning themselves. After all, the
orld is too small a place for even a
1 ousand Zionchecks.
But most people do not want glory,
t -rely the satisfaction of knowing
f it somebody wants them and ap
p. "dates their unique personality.
1 e appreciation does not necessarily

r ist be the joy of knowing that the

t; .ce issue with Dr. Margery Bailey,

h. s, but being not a thing at all is
li srally a hell of a life.

So while I sneer and cavil at those
v. lo waste most of their calories

The Oracle of Wong's Kitch has
been inhaling the sacred fumes of
boiling broccoli again and now comes
forth with the dictum that I am too
prone to accuse everyone of being
guided by ulterior motives.
Our Oracle, accustomed to speak
ing in pointless conclusions laid
down amidst a smoke-screen of
puns, noticed that within a week I
accused the Class of '40, Dr. Sargas,
the Budapest man of honor who
booked 50 more duels since last I
spoke of him, and several Chambers
of Commerce of being publicity
hounds. Thus the Oracle concludes
that I think everyone acts with more
than a casual eye to what people
think.
* * *
Now I would hate to be called a
youthful cynic, for if there are, as
the Oracle points out, an overabund
ance of fiery college editors, they are
indeed infinitesimal in number com
pared to the chirping horde of youth
ful know-it-alls who have seen the
world .or at least have been in seven
tates not counting Mexico and R?no
Nevada, and are tired of this life.
At the same time. I must raise my
' ead over the edge of the cradle and
ay that I think what most people
alue above all else .is recognition,
y recognition I do not mean con
>icuous glory, for there are only a
'• w people, relatively speaking, who
rive with heart and soul for pub
-1 ity and save all press clippings
< .ncerning themselves. After all, the
orld is too small a place for even a
1 ousand Zionchecks.
But most people do not want glory,
t -rely the satisfaction of knowing
f it somebody wants them and ap
p. "dates their unique personality.
1 e appreciation does not necessarily

r ist be the joy of knowing that the

t; .ce issue with Dr. Margery Bailey,
v lo once asserted that the prime
i( ja of life was to get along with
i: ople. Being a heel has its compen
s; 'ions as much as being a good guy
h. s, but being not a thing at all is
li srally a hell of a life.

So while I sneer and cavil at those
