# Delts Boast English Manor On Ton Of San Juan Hill
## Athletic Activities Topped By Eight Track Stars 
### 
That fancy stucco English manor
on San Juan Hill is the new home
of the Delta Tau Deltas, who tore
down their old brown shack and re
built this year. But in spite of the
new mansion, the Delts' house bills
remain the same â€”$50 a month, while
initiation fee is $60.
One of the largest houses on the
campus, the Delts have 42 members.
Ranking fourth in scholarship among
the fraternities, they still find time
to participate in a number of activi
ties.
Track Stars
More Delts are in track than in
any other sport, eight being on the
varsity team. In other athletics they
are distributed as follows: two in
rugby, two in football, three in cross
country, one in handball, one in
fencing, three in varsity tennis, two
in baseball, one in boxing, one in
gymnastics, vice-president of the
sailing club, and varsity soccer man
ager.
In other activities and in honor
societies the Delts have Scalpers,
Phi Phi, Chappie, Daily, Quad, glee
club, Tau Beta Pi; one in Hammer
and Coffin; dramatics; and two each
in Barnstormers, Ram's Head, and
Sword and Sandals.
