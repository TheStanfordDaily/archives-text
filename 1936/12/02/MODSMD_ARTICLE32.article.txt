# Farm Exchange Students in Chinese University Write Newsy Letter
## 
### 
Latest news from the six Stanford
exchange students to Lingnan Uni
versity in China is a news letter ed
ited by Betty Leigh Wright, one of
the Farm representatives.
An account of a bicycle trip
through Japan tells of the difficulties
faced by a group including Jack
Carter in buying food at a small
village. Labels on the canned food
were all in Japanese. A crowd of
over a hundred persons seemed to
take great enjoyment in watching
their manipulation of can opener and
chopsticks, and when they left they
were followed by a large aggrega
tion of boys and stray dogs.
In Nikko, a group including Stan
fordites John Carter, Helen Gilman,
John Fuller, Martha Hayes, Melville
Jacoby, and Betty Wright spent the
night at a small inn. They were
persuaded to bathe at eight instead
of ten, so that the rest of the family
could take their baths (in the same
water) after they had finished.
That these students still think of
Stanford is shown by a telegram re
ceived too late to publish in the Big
Game edition of the Daily. It said,

'Beat the Bears Saturday." The sig
nature was Fullerhaven Cartergil
man Jacobyhaven.
