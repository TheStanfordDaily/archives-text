# Foreign Physicists Meet at Stanford
## 
### JANET GOULD 
Both physicists, both coming to
Stanford from work in Holland in
October, Cornelius 80l and Dr. A. J.
F. Siegert met for the first time in
the University physics department.
It was Dr. Siegert's first taste of the
j United States, and Mr. 80l was
I returning to the Farm after a 20-
i year absence in his native Holland.
When 80l worked on sodiuin lamps
] in his laboratory in the Philips plant
Jat Eindhoven, Holland, he never
j thought of them in connection with
I the San Francisco - Oakland Bay
i Bridge. He did not imagine his cap
j illary lamp on a Hollywood movie
lot. Since his return the Bay bridge
I has been opened and the General
i Electric Company is preparing to
' manufacture his invention.
Worked with Radio
At the Philips Glow Lamp Works, j
I comparable to United States' Gen- j
| eral Electric Company, and co-work
! er with it, he worked on big and
j small radio valves, in connection
with which he holds several patents.
! Sodium lamps for road lighting and
mercury vapor lamps occupied him
next, and two years ago he invented
his capillary lamp.
Describing it, he said, ''The sun has
160,000 candle power per square
centimeter. For a short time my
lamp can burn 180,000 candle power,
| steadily at 100,000. This will make
it invaluable in motion pictures and
j extremely so in medicine.
At Stanford Mr. 80l will continue
i his straight research, try to cultivate
his three-acre plot on Roble Ridge,
| and raise his five sons.
Research Worker
While his new colleague was
working in Eindhoven, Dr. Siegert
I was doing research work at Leiden
j University on a fellowship after
working under Dr. W. Heisenberg,
■ Nobel prize winner, at Leipzig. In
j his native Germany he studied col
j lision problems, in Holland did re
search on demagnetization. Inter

ested in theory, he will spend most
of his time on the theory of the
nuclei of atoms with Dr. Felix Bloch.
Now, rushed to Stanford from the
boat on his first visit to the United
States, young, interested and "ex
cited over America," he laughingly
discussed the rudimentary problems
of a theorist in physics,
discuss relative merits of European
and American universities. As for
the equipment for his work, he said
that no elaborate apparatus was
needed, just "a pencil, paper—and
much eraser . . . decidedly a waste
basket."
All Students the Same
Students, he added, are really
much the same everywhere, and at
Stanford he could not detect the i
much touted disinterest in studies ;
that is supposed to distinguish the
American educational system.
Dr. Siegert plans to stay at Stan- |
ford indefinitely, to see the Big Red
Machine in action. Never having
watched the football team, he feels
that he "has a hole in his education." j
