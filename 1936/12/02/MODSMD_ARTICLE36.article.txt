# SIDELINE SLANTS...
## WATER POLO ON AND UP! 
### 
An idea deserving of at least con
templation by the care-worn Board
of Athletic Control is this proposed
trip of the water polo team to the
east next spring.
Coach Nort Thornton and those
who went before him have been
turning out championship teams in
the "roughest of all sports" for 22 of
the last 23 years. This year's squad
is as good as any.
They've torn through the local
competition losing only to California
1-0, and from whom they took a re
turn game 4-2 to win the Southern
Division, Pacific Coast Conference
title, long after the Northern Califor
nia Water Polo League's gonfalon
was likewise tucked away.
An eastern trip would cost in the
neighborhood of $;iOOO. The boys on
the squad realize that three G's is a
lot of money, and that any discussion
of matters fiscal, especially in this
lean year, are worthless when A1
Masters is out of town. But never
theless, they're only human; they
want the trip, they feel they're en
titled to it, so planning its possibili
ties is only reasonable and proper.
The plan is this: to first bring the
L.A.A.C. up here to prove Stanford's
ability. This southern team has beat
en the N.Y.A.C., defending A.A.U.
champs, at the last two Olympic
tryouts, and has cleaned up all the
small fry competition in Los An
geles. The L.A.A.C. would be glad
to come up with their swimming
team in January; if Stanford took
them at that time, the Cards would
easily qualify in the upper bracket of
the eastern competition.
The eastern meet is an A.A.U.
gathering, not definitely set. but
probably in New York the latter end
of March. Thornton says if Stanford
went east they'd be glad to con
venience us on the date, which
would be to put it during our spring
vacation.
Last trip east for Stanford's tank
men was in IH2B, when they defeated
several prominent Big Ten teams, but
did not win the title. Chances of this
year's team to win are much better
than were those in 1928.
What do you think? Remember all
that publicity when a few of the
players were trying out for the
Olympic Team Remember the opin
ion the east has of Stanford after that
Columbia game? How about putting
them right, and making the water
polo team national champs?
