Again it comes harvest time for the
all-Coast, all-City, all-League, ail-
American teams. And so what?
All-League teams are pretty good
things; the people who sclcct them
usually sec everyone play, and com
pete with their rivals for the various
positions. In such a situation it's
possible to irSake a selection that
might mean something.
But how about the rest of them?
They asked me to vote on a couple of
ail-Americans. Yah. put 'em down,
Tinsley. Widseth. and so on. read 'em
out of the Call-Bulletin. Foolish? Of
course it is.1 never saw Tinsley, nor
Widseth, nor Wodjocheihowicz, nor
did three-quarters of the others guys
who are doing the voting. Proof?
Look at the discrepancies:
1. The little colleges, although they
have their own ail-American, are
rarely selected by the big-time guys,
and are proven to produce as many
if not more great football players as
do prominent universities by .their
representation on pro football teams.
2. The definite agreement on a
large part of the teams selected each j
year. For instance, a number of in
dividual sports editor's selections, in
addition to the big syndicated teams,
have picked as ends Kelley of Yale
and Tinsley of L.S.U.. as tackles Wid
seth of Minnesota and Daniell of Pitt,

| one guard as Starcevich of Washing
| ton, quarterback Baugh of T.C.U.,
I and other backs Buivid of Marquette
and Francis of Nebraska. Somebody
j fudging?
! 3. In picking the backfield, what
I are you gonna do? At Stanford the
best quarterback is a blocker, a
j plunger, a signal caller. At U.S.C. he 1
J is a ball carrier, nothing else. Most I
i schools have a big plunger as full- I
| back, like Nevers. while Grayson, a |
l shifty broken Held man, was one of •
the most unanimous ail-American
fullbacks ever chosen.
4. With all credit to Larry Kelley
| as a ball player, he talked himself
into many of his selections by putting
himself in the public eye. Moscrip
was a similar case—he was a much
better end as a junior than a senior,
but was selected many more times as
a senior because of his game-winning
place kicks. I don't think so much
weight should be given to these.
1 So you see it's a problem. Tsout
souvas made John Lardner's team
because you can make more simple [
English words out of the letters of j
his name than you can with Wod- j
jochiehowicz. Do you think Chooch |
would have had a prayer if he hadn't i
played in the East?
