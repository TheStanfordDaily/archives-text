# Olympic Club Starters For Friday Undecided
## 
### 
Although the starting lineup for
1 the Olympic Club basketball team
| when it plays Stanford Friday night
j in the Pavilion is still in the dark—
■ even to George Dixon, the Post
! Street coach — Coach John Bunn
looks forward to a strenuous eve
ning for his squad.
Winged "O" players are still un
organized as far as actual playing
[ combinations are concerned, but they
have a roster that is once again, like
practically all former Club teams,
one of the finest groups of college
graduates on the coast. Most of the
: players have been playing all fall in
the industrial .league of San Fran
cisco for the Associated Oil team, and
with fifteen or sixteen games behind
them are in top condition.
The big three from Santa Clara's
varsity of last year, Jack Otten, Bob
Ethen, and Bob Goodell, are sup
posedly all set to start for Dixon
Friday night, but there remains
some question about Otten. Some
say he has been coaching the Bronc
frosh this year, and hence is ineli
gible, but teammate Ethen says he
has been practicing regularly and
definitely will play.
The Otten-fo-Goodell pass play
combination last year was dynamite,
Otten being popularly rated as one
of the best passers on the Coast. He
had quite a habit of whipping fast
ones from a half-bent position for
half the length of the court to Dr.
Goodell, cutting under the basket,
and two points for Santa Clara usu
ally ensued.

In addition to these three Coach
Dixon has Joe Murphy, U.S.F. guard
of two years ago who played for the
Y.M.I, last year and who John Bunn
thinks is a real edition of what a
good basketball player looks like.
Kay Olson, California captain last
, year, is also figured to play for the
[ Olympic Club this season, and he
may start Friday night here. His was
a major role in the Cal series with
the Cards last year, when the teams
split the four games.
Rod Bost, Stanford player of two
years ago, may also play, along with
a host of others who Coach Bunn
thinks form the best balanced team
on the Coast, colleges not excluded.
The game is scheduled to start at
7:30; there will be no preliminary.
General admission will be 50 cents,
children 25 cents, and students with
A.S.S.U. cards free.

! Street coach — Coach John Bunn
looks forward to a strenuous eve
ning for his squad.
Winged "O" players are still un
organized as far as actual playing
[ combinations are concerned, but they
have a roster that is once again, like
practically all former Club teams,
one of the finest groups of college
graduates on the coast. Most of the
: players have been playing all fall in
the industrial .league of San Fran
cisco for the Associated Oil team, and
with fifteen or sixteen games behind
them are in top condition.
The big three from Santa Clara's
varsity of last year, Jack Otten, Bob
Ethen, and Bob Goodell, are sup
posedly all set to start for Dixon
Friday night, but there remains
some question about Otten. Some
say he has been coaching the Bronc
frosh this year, and hence is ineli
gible, but teammate Ethen says he
has been practicing regularly and
definitely will play.
The Otten-fo-Goodell pass play
combination last year was dynamite,
Otten being popularly rated as one
of the best passers on the Coast. He
had quite a habit of whipping fast
ones from a half-bent position for
half the length of the court to Dr.
Goodell, cutting under the basket,
and two points for Santa Clara usu
ally ensued.

In addition to these three Coach
Dixon has Joe Murphy, U.S.F. guard
of two years ago who played for the
Y.M.I, last year and who John Bunn
thinks is a real edition of what a
good basketball player looks like.
Kay Olson, California captain last
, year, is also figured to play for the
[ Olympic Club this season, and he
may start Friday night here. His was
a major role in the Cal series with
the Cards last year, when the teams
split the four games.
Rod Bost, Stanford player of two
years ago, may also play, along with
a host of others who Coach Bunn
thinks form the best balanced team
on the Coast, colleges not excluded.
The game is scheduled to start at
7:30; there will be no preliminary.
General admission will be 50 cents,
children 25 cents, and students with
A.S.S.U. cards free.
