# Soccermen To Meet U.S.F.
## Cards Fight Saturday For Bay League Standing 
### 
Second place standing in- the Bay
League is the issue in Stanford's
soccer season finale this Saturday
with the University of San Francisco.
Tlie Cards have had an in-between
record this fall and hope to give a
little flourish in their closing ap
pearauce on the green.
U.S.F. came down to the Farm in
the first of two games and Stanford
goes to San Francisco for this second
tilt. In the first engagement both
teams left the field with two points
in their favor. California snatched
the blue ribbon some time ago. Be
cause the enemy took a pair of beat
ings in conference play as did the
locals, things are about even and
neither team shows disdain for sec
ond money.
Captain Bob Hall is scheduled to
move up to inside right to add
strength to the forward wall. At
center half his substitute will be
Dave Sloane. Irv Hawkins will work
in at Sloane's varsity post to com
plete the shuffling.
