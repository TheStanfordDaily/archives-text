# After Three Years
## 
### 
It's funny how things happen here at Stan
ford. Three years ago the first New Women
came. There was one big scream that as a result
of the New Women men were wearing ties,
men were wearing garters and suspenders, men
were not studying, men were consuming liquor,
men were getting hang nails, men were throw
ing themselves off of bridges. But nobody
whispered a word about the tremendous social
change (and lag) effected in women's own cam
pus relations. Now, three years later, without
any preliminary ballyhoo, without any Daily
editorial regurgitations, probably one of the
most significant changes caused by the in
creased feminine enrollment takes place, and
that is the founding of a new course entitled
"Women in Society."
No, it doesn't ring any bells, and it sounds
about as funny as the course in "Rhythm" that
used to be given in the Women's Hygiene De
partmentâ€”and was about music.
But it is significant as an entering wedge to
what may be a curricular revolution at Stan
ford. The backers say that if it proves success
ful a department for women may be set up.
And this is significant in that at last something
may be done about Stanford's being a man's
school, which a thousand women incidentally
attend for the convenience of the men.
After the Lower Division at Stanford, there is
little for a woman student to take that will be of
significance, unless she intends to be a teacher.
It is ridiculous for women to graduate in Politi
cal Science or Social Science unless they intend
to be professors. But they do. There are count
less others who flounder about from department
to departmerft, and are even more ridiculous.
Women's place in society will not be eased
much by the founding of an adequate curricu
lum for women at Stanford. We have our Cal
vinistic business civilization which prevents
women from developing their talents in produc
tive intellectual endeavor. We have the social
lag in mores, which causes us to raise and edu
cate women to be either kitchen drudges or
decorated ornaments, when science and tech
nology have advanced to the point where
women should be set free from such legalized
slavery. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't at
least try to be intelligent about it at Stanford.
It is probably of more interest to Stanford
men than to Stanford women that something be
done. For a lot of men have ideas about marry
ing Stanford women, and eventually will have
to suffer for the absurdity of the social set-up
and for their own Pre-Raphaelite ideas about
women.
And while it is imperative that the women
get this new opportunity to rise above their
menial level, the men also should have a
course, because the atitude of many of our men
i.z one of the things that keep them down to
that level. But it should be a course in under
standing women, and it shouldn't be mixed up
v/ith the women's curriculum.
