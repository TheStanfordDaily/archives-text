# Lost and Found
## 
### 
Lost and Found departments are properly the
y rovince of the business department, and the
business department provides the money that
makes The Daily go, and that is important.
However, it is also important to the editorial
department that my binder, now lost these three
Jong weeks, be returned, because it had all my
edit ideas for the rest of the volume which I
wrote this summer while trying to go to sleep
t nights. When last seen it was in the Libe's
Lost and Found department. Finder please re
turn.
