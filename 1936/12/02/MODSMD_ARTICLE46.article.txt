# Who Gets the New Theater?
## 
### 
Advices from the alumni front indicate that
I he Alumni Association has its eyes on dedi
cating the New Theater for the spring reunion.
Advices from the student front indicate that
iho Dramatic Council, the Concert Series, and
Barnstormers all have their hopes set on being
the ones honored with dedicating the new struc
ture.
The alumni have already made tentative
olans, while the students only hope. Sooner or
later, there is going to be a clash of interests,
though, and somebody is going to have to de
cide who gets the dedication.
Whether it is Ex Committee or the Committee
on Public Exercises who decides is a debatable
question.
If the students want it, though, they had bet
ter start lobbying right away.
The merit of the student case is this: except
for the 5167,000 donated by alumni and others
as a War Memorial, and various minor contri
butions, the 5583,000 is studen-financed.

The financing done by the students is paid
from money borrowed from the University at
5 per cent interest. The Dramatic Council is
still in debt for a former $500 a quarter assess
ment on the salary of the Dramatics Director.
Since students and student activities have paid
and are paying for their dramatics, it seems only
fair that they should get first crack at paying off
some of the dramatic debt, by such a financially
profitable thing as the Theater dedication could
be.
This does not alter the fact that Dramatics as
an extra-curricular student activity probably
will disappear at Stanford with the opening of
the New Theater. Right now, The Daily is run
ning a series of aricles on the dramatic set-up
here and at other places. So far we have found
out that the University has not planned any
changes in the present set-up. The official Uni
versity committee headed by Dr. L. E. Bassett
has not yet been active.
But the inevitable conclusion would seem to
be that any serious, constructive attempt at the
drama needs a School of the Theater, with defi
nite class-room handling of the productions.
Such shows and musicales as the Gaieties and
the Spring Show could still be student pro
duced, as Dick Daugherty suggests, under the
control of a modified Dramatic Council.
So eventually, both the University and the
students will get the benefit of the New Theater,
but we won't forget that the students are paying
for it.
