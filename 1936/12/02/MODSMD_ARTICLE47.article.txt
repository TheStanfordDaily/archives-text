## WINTERSETâ€”BREATH OF SPRING

You mustn't see "Winterset," Maxwell Anderson's
Pulitzer Prize Drama, spelled with a capital "D."
You won't like it. RKO executives didn't like it,
either. There was no way to work in Shirley Temple
leading the Charge of the Light Brigade, or Ruby Kee
ler dancing atop a flying piano. So they orphaned the
whole idea and let the director alone. Knowing he
wasn't being watched, he imported some Actors (spelled
with a capital '"A") got Nathaniel Shilkret to write a
score, and generally ruined the show's box-office
appeal.

The result is not a good picture. It is a perfect pic
ture. Because of those who won't like it, it will be
written of! as prestige, high-priced creator of priceless
public good will.

There isn't a star in it, which should guarantee a
heavy flop. A guy named Burgess Meredith is a son
hunting down the murderers of his father. He is not
Burgess Meredith. And he isn't Errol Flynn or Cap
tain Blood or a British Officer as Errol Flynn. A gal
named Margo is his sweetheart. And she is his sweet
heart, not Jean Harlow acting with Spencer Tracy while
she waits for Bill Powell.
Which isn't worth 40 cents. After all. who's heard
of Eduardo Gianelli, except the handful who saw his
breathless performance in Cornell's "Saint Joan"?
And who cares about this guy, what's his name,
Meredith and uh, Margo, and the rest of that
incomparable galaxy that makes "Winterset" less a
profitable picture than a nerve-wracking experience.

And who cares that "Winterset" is far and away the
finest 8 reels of Eastman gray developed in the last
decade, not forgetting "The Scoundrel" and "The In
former"?
Maybe you do, but as an average movie-goer you
don't. You'd rather not see it, take it from us. It isn't
pretty, as a movie should be, it's beautiful. It isn't
entertaining, its absorbing.
It wipes the powder off the ladies' noses, it makes
your collar too small for you. When the lights go up
you're in no condition to be seen, or heard. You are
simply through.

Nope, you won't like it. The thing needed only 12
sets. It probably cost less than $100,000. Heroines get
their hair mussed. When a man is shot three times, he
is fleckcd with blood. He doesn't die neatly, as a movie
actor should.
But then, of course, he's not a movie actor. He's an
actor. And the man who built the sets wasn't an in
terior decorator, he was a plasterer, a carpenter, an
electrician.
We wonder why they let it by
