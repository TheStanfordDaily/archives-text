Now is time to chronicle some of the multifarious
and amphibious activities of the Delta Gamma house,
544 Lasuen Street.
One little Deegee who had listened faithfully to very
long and tedious discussions by Daily men before Ex
Committee on losing their 15 cents, had a rather embar
rassing experience. She went down to the Cellar one
day with 10 cents to buy a coke. But after she had
consumed her coke she accidentally dropped the 10
cents down inside her dress. Then followed a long and
tedious consternation by Daily and weekly men (except
Saturdays and Sundays) about her losing 10 cents.
Until somebody volunteered to underwrite the loss,
there was some small talk about seeing if the Deegee
could stand on her head. The talk would not have
been small if she had done so,
It seems that the Deegees like animals. Though this
does not include all Phi Delts, it includes pets. They
are now harboring a stable of guinea pigs. These
bcasties are the gift of an anonymous philanthropist
from St. Louis, who took one of the Deegees out last
week-end, had a flat tire on the Bayshore, and se
cured a lockout. Overcome with remorse, the anony
mous philanthropist discovered that his friend, like all
Deegees, liked pets, so he sent a brace of pigs. Now it
gets so bad around the old homestead that you hear
such things as, "Sorry, I can't go to the show with you,
I have to stay here and take the pigs out for an airing."
Speaking of airing, the Deegees also have a pet like
in dried fish, giving the amphibious touch to their
menagerie.
Every once in a while the Deegees go on wild
herring jags, buying up the stock of the dainty con
fection in Paly shops. Then they sidle home, being
very careful not to pa.ss any marks of human habita
tion on the way, because herring, as you may or may
not know, smells. However, every once in a while, one
of the young ladies slips and walks through the Library
with a sack of the tasty morsel in her hand. The library
doesn't like this a little hit because it's awfully hard
on the book binding, but the library is a bit embar
rassed about it because they can't just send a post card
to the Delta Gammas and say, "Your herring is over
due," can they?
