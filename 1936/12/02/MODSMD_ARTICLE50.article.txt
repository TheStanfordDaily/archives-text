"The War Goes On" by Sholcnt Asch.
Putnam, $.'5. Translation by Willa
and Edwin Muir.

Propaganda has raised books from
the mediocre to the outstanding and
has cost many their library value, but !
when it is mixed as honestly in a
book of the caliber of "The War Goes
On" it is no more than an intensely ;
humanistic strain through a cross- i
section of some persons' lives.
In this work, which Asch calls "a {
novel," there is the continual hurt
analysis of why the Jew is regarded
as he is in Germany, what his posi- ;
tion is, the unconscious comparison j
of capitalism and socialism, and the
frantic horror of what communism
would bring to a chaotic social or
der. It is the story of the great 1
financial Jews in post-war Germany
before the advent of Hitler.
When Aron Judkewitch was forced
by his Bolshevist brother and'a pog
rom in Ukraine to flee Russia, he
went to Danzig, started a series of
febrile speculations in the catapult
ing currencies of Russia and Ger
many. In the process of becoming
one of the most powerful financial
figures, he met a woman with whom
he fell in love, and forced her hus
band to sell her to him. His next
step was to install himself into the
conservative old Bodenheimer bank,
and. as a result of pseudo-commun
istic and socialistic ideas and unfor
tunate speculations was deported
from Berlin.
That and the refreshing, idyllic
love-story of the half-Jew Hans
Bodenheimer and Lotte von Sticker,
of an old Junker family, are the only
plot threads of the book. It is not a
story, but the reader is allowed to
step into the life of these people.
But the book is not a heavy phi
losophy. The first chapter is as dif
ferent from the rest of the book as
grimy, rich tapestry is from cello
phane, and makes the reader believe
that when Aron says "the old order
has changed" that it has.
Credit goes to Willa and Edwin
Muir, the translators, for bringing a
vigorous, lucid style, without losing
the dignity of old-world turns of
speech.
The reader need not agree with
some of the ideas carrying the book,
but the view and lives it presents of
a definite past phase in modern so

ciety are invaluable. After finishing
it, the impression is one of warmth,
color, and unconscious greatness:
one of the books that should not be
missed.

has changed" that it has.
Credit goes to Willa and Edwin
Muir, the translators, for bringing a
vigorous, lucid style, without losing
the dignity of old-world turns of
speech.
The reader need not agree with
some of the ideas carrying the book,
but the view and lives it presents of
a definite past phase in modern so

it, the impression is one of warmth,
color, and unconscious greatness:
one of the books that should not be

"The War Goes On" by Sholcnt Asch.
Putnam, $.'5. Translation by Willa
and Edwin Muir.

Propaganda has raised books from
the mediocre to the outstanding and
has cost many their library value, but !
when it is mixed as honestly in a
book of the caliber of "The War Goes
On" it is no more than an intensely ;
humanistic strain through a cross- i
section of some persons' lives.
In this work, which Asch calls "a {
novel," there is the continual hurt
analysis of why the Jew is regarded
as he is in Germany, what his posi- ;
tion is, the unconscious comparison j
of capitalism and socialism, and the
frantic horror of what communism
would bring to a chaotic social or
der. It is the story of the great 1
financial Jews in post-war Germany
before the advent of Hitler.
When Aron Judkewitch was forced
by his Bolshevist brother and'a pog
rom in Ukraine to flee Russia, he
went to Danzig, started a series of
febrile speculations in the catapult
ing currencies of Russia and Ger
many. In the process of becoming
one of the most powerful financial
figures, he met a woman with whom
he fell in love, and forced her hus
band to sell her to him. His next
step was to install himself into the
conservative old Bodenheimer bank,
and. as a result of pseudo-commun
istic and socialistic ideas and unfor
tunate speculations was deported
from Berlin.
That and the refreshing, idyllic
love-story of the half-Jew Hans
Bodenheimer and Lotte von Sticker,
of an old Junker family, are the only
plot threads of the book. It is not a
story, but the reader is allowed to
step into the life of these people.
But the book is not a heavy phi
losophy. The first chapter is as dif
ferent from the rest of the book as
grimy, rich tapestry is from cello
phane, and makes the reader believe
that when Aron says "the old order
has changed" that it has.
