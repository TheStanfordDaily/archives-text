# Two Foreign Films Score At Varsity
## 
### 
Stanford has a chance to sec some
thing of continental motion picture
production in the two films showing
at the Varsity, "NINE DAYS A
QUEEN," with Nova Pilbeam, pro
duced by Gaumont - British, and
"EMIL UND DIE DETEKTIVE" in
German, with English sub-titles.
Stanford German Department's
newest contribution in bringing such
films to Palo Aho may sound like
a continued bathtub gargle, but the
language can be overlooked for the
excellent photography and dry hu
mor.
In two ways this picture can be
compared to the American comedy;
its resemblance to the incongruous
but appealing plots of Our Gang
comedies and the use of the "burp"
to get a laugh where the action is
slow.
The story is about a little fellow,
Emil, who leaves his home town to
take some money to his grand
mother. On the way, he is drugged
by a villain, and his money is token.
Emil follows the thief to a beer
parlor, where he meets up with a
kid who has a gangâ€”and what a
gang!
After many failures to get the
money back, what looks like the
charge of the Light Brigade follows
the crook down the street, and Emil,
now the leader, dashes into the hotel
after him. Emil proves the money is
his, and all ends happily ever after,
with the thief in jail, the hero's re
turn home in an aeroplane with 1000
marks in his pocket.
