# Psychologists to Build "Brain-Wave" Gauge
## New Laboratory Gadget To Test Brainwaves 
### 
A new gadget for Stanford psy
chologists to play with â€” that's the
electroencephalograph now being
built, at the communications labora
tory for use by psychology experi
menters under the direction of Pro
fessor Ernest R. Hilgard.
The new machine first used re
cently by Professor Donal B. Linds
ley of Western Reserve University,
measures the frequency of "brain
waves," emanations sent out by the
human brain.
These waves first appear x-egularly
in the infant when he is about 4
months of * age. and continue
throughout life. They increase in
frequency until an age of about 10,
when the frequency remains fairly
constant for the rest of one's life.
This finding of a change in rate
with development may serve in the
future as an index to growth, and the
electroencephalograph may be used
to detect those children who are not
developing at their proper rate, Pro
fessor Lindsley believes.
Professor Hilgard, disclaiming any
original research projects in mind,
will use the instrument to check
Professor Lindsley's observations,
and also those of Dr. Hallowell Davis
of the Harvard University Medical
School, who found a strong sugges
tion of heredity or family character
istics in the brainwave patterns.
Identical twins, he also found, show
a close similarity in their brain
rhythms.
