DEAR SANTY
Dear Sanly: ..
How are you. Isn't this lovely weather. 1 don't know
how to start. But here goes:
Listen, you dumb babboon, along with the Editor
of the Literary Digest, you've probably read the last
tabby. You'll find that some of the Stanford faculty
want $£,000,000. And we don't blame you for not com
ing through. We figure you're not coming through,
huh?
* * *
But. there are a couple of items that we kinda
thought you'd sign authorizations for, if Chuck's in,
o' course. They're not much, as we hope you'll realize,
but we just haven't been able to swing them. Ex Com
mittee's funny that way, or is it the other way.
One of them is—not a new car or a radio or even a
straight "C" in Econ—but a fact misrepresenter.
And we don't want it personally, Santa, because we
have to write a thing like this every day, and we can't
be held down by other than administrative machinery.
But we want just a little portable fact misrepresenter,
one we can carry around the campus to relieve some
of the misrepresenting that takes up so much admin
istrative time.
* * * *
Now this being the season of good cheer, when you
realize old things are best, after all, we should like to
take (he misrepresenter to the Union Cellar every
morning. That would permit hashers to receive re
quests for "coffee" without wincing or leering sar
castically. At lunch, we should put the misrepresenter
in our pocket, and make it run on the menus.
Such a dodge would make it unnecessary for some
stooge to write down all the toothful items on pieces of
paper, when he writes strictly from his imagination,
and not from the kitchen—which is also misrepresented
by Ihe hashers, and the hashers who are misrepresented
by the kitchen.
Naturally, Santa, there are other uses for a really
good fact misrepresenter (and I don't want a cheap
one.) We could use one on sex talks that aren't sex
talks, on red groups that need a color wheel, on Union
profits that arc student gifts, on 8./VC. statements lhat
show everything but Big Game profits. On rooting sec
tions that look free and easy, but cost $1.G5 and wore
darned hard.
How about it, Sanly? Or arc you just a misrepre
sented fact yourself.
Hopefully,
—Bob Eisenbach
