# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
You would think that anyone who belongs to El
Toro would be most interested in shooting the bull, but
this is not always the ease.
There is one member of this organization, who is
sort of a Mission Street cowboy. Every night he leans
out his window with his 8.8. gun and pops bottles in
the center of Toyon Court.
Cute doings occurred at one of those Thanksgiving
rushing parties. The Alpha Dells had a quiet little
lawn party at the home of one of those luxurious homes
compounded semi-annually. Everyone was frolicking
around the lawn playing football in their new shoes
thinking of home and mother ,when all of a sudden,
001%, a rusher dumped a rushee in the goldfish pond.

Then all of a sudden, OOPS, the rushee rushcred
and the sin was expiated.
Everybody thinks that fraternity life is swell.

Seeing that this is the last Hasher for the quarter,
I am reminded of one of the best stories of the recent
election campaign.
The Chicago Trib, being a violently anti-Roosevelt
paper would come out during the heat of the campaign
saying, "Only 20 more days to save your country."
This was repeated on each successive day until finally
it got down to election day. Then the Chicago Daily
Times, the one Democratic paper in Ihe city, figured it
was time to do something. While the Trib and the rest
of the papers gushed forth with pompous sentiments
about the millions of voters going to the polls today, Ihe
Daily Times appeared on election morn with a quiet
little three or four-inch screamer streamer headline:
"Only 41 Shopping Days till Christmas."

In response to many requests, Chef Wong, Frscist
chef of the sugar ton a kitch, has compiled the Christ
mas gift list for Our Hasher.
1. Hashboy bumboy.
2. Drink too much, allee time talkee, make me sick.
3. Christmas socks.
4. In the puss that refreshes.
5. Fraternity ties.
(>. Community property.
7. All power to the soviets.
8 Somebody should dock the dock strike.
!). Roosevelt has docked out of the dock strike.
10. I love peace.
11. Write your congressman immediately.

Then all of a sudden, OOPS, the rushee rushcred
and the sin was expiated.
Everybody thinks that fraternity life is swell.
