THEODORA GOES WILD: Irene
Dunne's picture which is now show
ing at the Orphcum Theatre in San
Francisco is the best comedy that
has come tp the City in a long time.
The whole idea of the story is differ
ent from the usual run of slap-stick,
punny farce. Irene Dunne, whose
little comedy scene in "Show Boat"
showed as, much to our surprise,
that here was a comedian who was a
comedian. Lucky for us her pro
ducers realized the same thing and
put her into the peppiest picture
since "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."
Irene Dunne plays a small-town
girl who unknown to her gossipy
town writes sex stories under a
nom-de-plume. Of course the great
moment comes when the towns
people find out that their sweet little
girl is none other than the famous
authoress. The town goes wild, but
not as wild as Theodora, who starts
.stepping out in the Big City. The
perfect climax to this perfect picture
ccmes when Theodora steps eff the
train in her home town with a baby
in her arms. This scene is really
superb.
Melvyn Douglas, as the man who
love.s Theodora but runs from her
because he is married, plays his
comedy role with finesse. It's the
funniest comedy screened this year
so don't miss it.
