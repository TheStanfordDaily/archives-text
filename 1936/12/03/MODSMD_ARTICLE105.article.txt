; The Editor, Sir:
Your wide-awake sports ed struck
I a fine note in his column yesterday
| about our water polo team's pro
i posed trip to Chicago. It is unfortu-
I nate, however, that the Daily rriu.sl
I close shop today and leave the qucs
i tion hanging in mid-air.
Those who know the superiority of
, this year's team ought to begin a
J talking campaign. Those who are
I interested in putling Stanford up for
| recognition back there should also
1 get busy. It may be a long time be
! fore we have such an opportunity
! again.
