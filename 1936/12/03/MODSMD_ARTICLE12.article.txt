j To the Editor, Sir:
| Very amusing do we find Daily Re-
J porter Drury's impressions of the
I A.S.U. sponsored waterfront tourâ€”
| very amusing and very shallow,
j If the article was supposed to be
i Mr. Drury's own personal view of the
situation, if it was supposed to be
nothing more than an adolescent at
tempt at wit, it was probably suc
cessful, although in bad taste. If it
poses as a representative picture of
I the tour and the strike we insist that
it falls pretty fiat. If Reporter Drury
; is the type of Stanfordite who lives
1 in an Ivory Tower and goes slum-
I ming on the economic front occa
-1 sionally to tease his whimsical
' moods, that is all right, too. But
we resent the implication that the
! rest of us who went on the tour were
! of the same spiril.
Most of us, we are sure, went with
1 the honest desire to find out some
thing about the strike and we fur
| ther believe we found out plenty, at
least more than Mr. Drury with his
*
keeti reportorial eye seems to have
found out. We found out that the
i waterfront involved the lives of sev
eral tho"sand men and their families,
I whether these men are to eat regu

larly and live as Americans should or
whether they arc to continue igno
minious victims of poor working
conditions. We found out from Mr.
Fox that publicity for Ihe '34 strike
had been very "unfavorable" to the
employers and that Mr. Fox had
been the big newspaper man respon
sible for that publicity and that the
publicity had been so "unfavorable"
that the waterfront employers now
see fit to pay h'm a fat salary to
handle publicity and be "unfavor
able" to them again.
We saw also the contrast between
the luxurious offices of the employ
ers' association and the rough,
wholesome barracks of the water
front workers. We were able to note
the contrast between the smooth
voiced. dapper Mr. Fox and the
straightforward, rugged, pioneer
like manner of the longshoremen.
But we scarcely see it as a flippant
jaunt to be chortled over behind tea
cups. Wp leave that to Mr. Drury
who, in all likelihood, will still be
scintillating when the blood of
American Workers flows on the Em
barcadero.
