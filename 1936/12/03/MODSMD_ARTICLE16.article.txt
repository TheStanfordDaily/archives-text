## Courses Given in Scenic Design, Stage Lighting 
### SUZANNE HAMMOND 
In contrast to the proposed Stan
ford School of the Theater, Yale
University's famous Department of!
Drama is primarily a graduate
school, separate from Ihe rest of the
college both as to staff and as to
curriculum.
The department is a division of the
School of Fine Arts, with a master of |
fine arts degree in playwriting, play J
production, scenic or costume do-1
sign, and stage lighting available to j
those students who already possess a j
B.A. degree and have completed
three years of work in the depart
ment with distinction.
Four-Year Course
A Ph.D. degree is also conferred on
those who have completed a four
year course in theater and dramatic
criticism, and is intended primarily
for those desiring to specialize in
historical or critical study of the
theater.
When the department was orig
inally founded by George Pierce
Baker about 10 years ago, it was in
tended as a school for people who
already possessed talent in some
form of dramatic work, rather than
for those who merely wanted to de
velop it.
Work in the department gives a
thorough grounding in all branches
of the field, beginning with a com- j
pulsory introductory course which I
combines all aspects of the theater
and leads to more specialized courses
in various fields. Every student j
must do a certain amount of acting j
regardless of what field he is going
into.
Seven Major Plays
During 1935, seven major produc
tions, six 47 Workshop productions, I
and seven departmental productions j
were presented in the University]
Theater. All work in the major pro- |
ductions including acting, lighting, j
designing, and stage managing, is
done by the students, under the su- ;
pervision of the teaching staff.
