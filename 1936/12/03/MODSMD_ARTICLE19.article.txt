# New Phi Bete Rule Denies Juniors Key
## Awards Given To Seven Seniors, Three Grads By Farm Honor Group 
### 
Stanford Chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa decided at a meeting last
Tuesday to exclude juniors from the
list of those eligible to receive the
key award, although it has been the
custom to elect some from that group
each year. The change was an
nounced yesterday by John Pierce
Mitchell, University Registrar.
At the same time, the Stanford
members elected three students from
the class of '36 and seven from the
class of '37. Since the new ruling
had gone into effect, no juniors wex - e
elected to the chapter. All ten new
members will be initiated Monday
at the next meeting.
The new graduate members are
Mary E. Clark, James E. McCormick,
Jr., and Alexander G. Trompas.
Harold L. Dunkleberger, Elizabeth L.
Ferry, Frances F. Ferry, Judith B.
Goodheart, Robert L. Haslacher,
James T. Hill, Jr., and Rebecca M.
Stribling were the seniors admitted
to membership.
According to John Pierce Mitchell,
J Registrar, the amendment will sim
plify the work of choosing the stu
dents who are to become members.
"It is not that the old system was
inefficient," he said, "but it was more
complicated than was necessayr or
convenient."
"A student is eligible," he con
tinued, "only when he has completed
; 160 units of work in a college, and
has lived at Stanford for five quar
ters; or after he has graduated (no
student can graduate unless he has
lived here three quarters). No stu
dent will be considered unless he has
a B average or better."
Of the newly elected majors, Eco-
J nomics, English, and Political Sci
j ence each claimed two. The other
j four were divided among Mathe
! matics, Chemistry, History, and So
cial Science. All of them were over
200 in their plus score, while Harry
Dunkleberger and Judith Goodheart
were at the top with 268 and 267
points plus, respectively.
Dunkleberger was the only senior
with over 160 credits, but none was
less than 138. Judith Goodheart and
Rebecca Stribling had 148 and 149
points to their credit. Alexander
Trompas, on last year's football team,
is the only graduate Phi e√üte who
didn't return for more work. Mary
Clark is here in the graduate Math
ematics department, and James Mc-
Cormack is doing more work in
Chemistry.
