# Cards, Nassau Debate on Air
## Longer Time Granted For Cross- country Hook-up 
### 
After two months of negotiation,
arrangements have been completed
for a transcontinental debate with
Princeton on Saturday afternoon,
December 19. The subject of this
debate will be: "Resolved, that mod
ern civilization kills personality," and
the Cardinal debaters will take the
negative side of the question.
The debate will be broadcast over
the Blue Network of the National
Broadcasting Company, and will last
for forty-five minutes. In the past
few years Stanford has been espe
cially fortunate in obtaining time on
the NBC network for debates. For
merly Stanford has never received
more than thirty minutes for the de
bate broadcasts.
National Hook-up
Speakers, as yet, have not been
chosen, says Bob Gros, acting faculty
debate manager. Tryouts will be
held at the end of this week for the
two speakers. Gros expects many
students to try out for this debate,
because there has been much inter
est shown in this field.
Stanford has been very lucky in
the past in securing time on the na
tional hook -up of the National
Broadcasting Company for debates.
The debates have averaged one per
yfcaivand this is a very good record,
considering that mbst American uni
versities have never been able to
broadcast their debates.
Transoceanic Debates
The last debate of this kind was
held two years ago, when Stanford
met Columbia over the air waves.
Once in the past Stanford met Cam
bridge in a transoceanic and trans
continental hook-up. This debate
was the most extensive of any Stan
ford debate broadcasts every held.
The securing of this broadcast time
has been a great triumph for the
Stanford debaters, and it took them
two months of careful negotiations in
order, to achieve this.
