# Varsity Hoopsters Plan Tour East During Vacation
## Cards Scheduled To Play Olympic Club, Spartans Tomorrow, Saturday 
### WALT PETERSON 
Playing the San Francisco Olympic
Club tomorrow night and San Jose
State College Saturday night as the
last two practice games before the
10-day finals deadline puts the finger
on further competition this quarter,
the varsity basketball team will
have two weeks to worry about how
they will have fun when they make
a Christmas vacation tour to the East
for seven intersectional games.
Little is known of any of the 6even
teams to be played in the out-of
state contests ,although they all,
according to Coach John Bunn, are
leaders in their respective confer
ences. None but Temple havo
achieved the great national publicity
that makes them known out on the
Coast, since none are particularly
strong in football, but their basket
ball outfits are tops.
Leave December 18
Leaving the campus directly aftef
finals close December the travel
ing squad, as yet unnamed, will meet
Warrensburg State Teachers in
Kansas City, Missouri, December 22,
Not a great football college, this
school has.a reputation of having one
of the best hoop teams In the Middle
West.
Next ju'tap will be made to Phila
delphia, December 28, where the
Cards meet Temple, which consist
ently puts out one of the toughest
teams in the East. Pop Warner
won't, be there to see the boys, be
cause he is supposed to arrive in San
Francisco today with his football
team that plays St. Mary's Sunday.
Long Island University in Madison
Square Garden, December 30, is
next, as one of the hardest battles
Coach Bunn expects to face. The
L.I.U. squad last year was good
enough to beat the New York Uni
versity Violets, national collegiate
champions, in not one game but two.
The reip;> : der of the games will
be played with Canisius College at
Buffalo, New Year's Day; Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, Jan
uary 2; Hamline University at St.
Paul, January 4; and Montana State
at Bozeman January 6.
Practice Game Tomorrow
The Olympic Club tomorrow night
will give the Cards one of the hardest
practice games of the season, figures
Bunn. They will have a line-up that
boasts some of the greatest college
stars of the past few seasons, includ
ing Otten, Ethen, and Goodell of
i Santa Clara, Murphy and Lewis of
San Francisco ,and Eifer and Olson
of California, and Bost of Stanford,
| among a host of others.
The game will s<art at 7:30 in the
Pavilion, with general admission 50
cents. Student body cards will admt.
Play Spartans
Saturday's game with the Spartans,
to be played in the Washington
Square Gym at San Jose, will not be
the pushover that it was last year, for
what was a peewee state team then
is no wgraced by several large gen
tlemen who will match Stanford s
behemoths, almost.
Among the new men Carroll,
guard, Groskopf, center, and Ivir
Thomas, center, are outstanding, all
slated to he regulars. Another
Thomas, a colored boy named Lloyd,
will not be here for this game, hav
ing left for Hawaii Wednesday to
play football, but he is one of the
strongest candidates for a first
string berth when he returns.
Two years ago the Spartans beat
Stanford by one point and got ail
awful kick out of it.
