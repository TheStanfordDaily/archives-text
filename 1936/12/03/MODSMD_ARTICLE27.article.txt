MY MUDDLED ANSWER

Dear Professor Harris:
If I had put my feet on the desk
in section meeting this morning, I
wouldn't have felt :iny more com
fortable, for all the while you were
deploring breezy, Time-style jour
lalism, 1 had more than a sneaking
suspicion that I was standing ac
cused of being another one of the
housands of smart-alec college jour
nalists. *
1 should take some consolation in
:he fact that I am tagging along with
Ihe majority, but that would not be
;. iy good for an argument, for. as
'est brook Pegler points out, the
•oplc who think Johnny Weismul
i r's body beautiful is a thing of
• eat dramatic ability are likewise in
I " majority. Nor can I say that you
echoing the old, old wail that
c lege journalists are only the most
! itant part of a younger generation
v irh is on the whole going to seed.
Aiu do not condemn the younger
112 i deration in particular, but rather
(, . whole race of journalists in gen
er; 1 who wise-crack to the point of
bumptiousness, and who can see no
v, ng in Time irreverently describ
in; a statesman as long-jawed, hook
no 'd, gum-chewing, dullish, and
•if 1 — ish. However, in saying to you
n ,1 have no intentions of absolv
itor the entire fourth estate from the
na of such an accusation. I pro
p< merely to justify the position of
ti' college journalist.

would be a little short of pre
p reus to suggest that the college
jo; laiist is a true Sophist, a person
wh' believes that all truth is relative
ince no truth is certain, why try
truthful anyway—why not be
in. ly clever? At this juncture you
v. f i s d say that college journalists are
r. ' lever at all, but only cute, and
if n would be your point. You
w(- d point out that even our cute
nc is only cute in a purely trivial
am; ocal way, and that cutcness is a
pre y tiresome thing.
" ore is, I admit, a great deal of
t: in asserting that for actual
oo< accomplished, the box score for
il;< college newspaper gang is no
r.'i: few hits, and plenty of errors.
I. '( >. feel that college journalism is
jr. ( one great series of muffed
ch ces and unrealized possibilities.
1 t v/e who hang around the of
(' of campus publications, sit on
tl: lesks, chew the fat, and put on
ti •• tirs of real newspaper men, are
c!< . < it mostly because it is fun, and
i ' because we feel the urge to cm-
It for the truth. We write, for
i < ;nition to be sure, but primarily
!or >ur amusement. And thei'e are
. v of us engaged in the manufac
i iii ■< of pap for public consumption
v.'h do not think our own stuff riot
-0 . ' funny and beastly clever.
r i then, to the accusation that I
and others of my ilk are confirmed
cho ters who would sacrifice aceu
i'.i<. for cuteness, I cannot help but
f:!f 1 guilty, but is the offense a
ciii e? Personally, I think that what
tru l we are able to perceive with
om infantile minds, that truth we
v/i put down on paper. To observe
th; liars and pigs are most prone to
eal others liars and pigs is no less
trl' just because I have made the
o!, rvation in a smart-alec manner.
1a n you yourself admitted that it is
!Vi: .'asier to understand international
af , irs by reading Time than by
rc ling page two of most daily news
p ers.
.s for us juveniles drawing out the
fi • web of pure thought in a serious
n nner — have you forgotten all
1 >se examination papers where the
) >r student struggled through an
; swer with all the gracefulness of
elephant stuck in a quagmire?
