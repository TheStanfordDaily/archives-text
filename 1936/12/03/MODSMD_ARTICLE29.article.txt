# Cards Charter Full Moon For Winter Dance
## All Stanford Rustic Affair To Feature Exchange Meals Plus Hay-ride 
### 
An all-campus barn dance pre
ceded by exchange dinners involv
ing every Stanford living group was
planned by Cardinals last night,
meeting for the last time this quar
ter.
Between now and the first avail
able full moon during winter quar
ter, arrangements will be made for
carrying out the suburban theme in
every phase—including a hayride
and horse and buggy transportation
—for this closed date affair which is
expected to attract the entire Farm.
Red Cross drive having grossed
$864.59, according to Betty Grover,
Cardinals passed a vote of thanks to
Stanford for its donations, the high
est since '22.
This year's bonfire, reported Jeeb
Halaby, will have cost $100, one
third less than last year's, unless a
certain outraged agrarian makes
good a $42 50 claim with reference
to a purloined privy which swelled
the rally blaze. The same act of
malicious mischief and petty theft
was committed last year.
Future arrangements with regard
to what Cardinals plan to make the
largest and most inclusive dance on
the campus are in the hands of the
organization operating as a commit
tee of the whole but final prepara
tions with regard to securing a closed
date, the services of R.O.T.C. horses,
appropriate vehicles, and negotiat
ing for a series of large-scale ex
change dinners will be handled next
quarter by specially appointed
members.
Meanwhile, Cardinals suggest that
dates be had early for this function
which may accommodate, what with
corollary activities of a rustic nature,
an entire week-end—when the moon
is full.
With loose ends tied and important
plans made for next year, Cardinals
adjourned until the first Wednesday
of winter quarter.
