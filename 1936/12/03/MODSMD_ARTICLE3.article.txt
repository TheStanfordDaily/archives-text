Germany an acquaintance with the'

Dr. D. Ellon Trueblood will offer i
"Human Values" (Religion 3) in the
summer quarter, the first time that a
course of this nature has been given
during the summer session. De

the development of a consistent per-j
sonal philosophy," it "seeks to dis
cover the deeper meanings of human
life and thus provide a basis for wise
living."
