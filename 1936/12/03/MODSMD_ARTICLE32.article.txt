# Shakespeare's Autograph Found in Library
## 
### JOHN RICE 
Startling to scholars was the re
cent find by Dr. Nathan Van Patten,
director of the library, of a neat
scribble which has been condition
ally accepted as the signature of
William Shakespeare, bard of Avon.
A possible solution to one of lit
erature's most discussed mysteries—
the authenticity of Shakespeare's
writings—the signature indicates
that the dramatist was a cultured
and well-educated man, well quali
fied to have written the unequaled
comedies and tragedies which have
been credited to him.
Bar (I Well Educated
Dr. Henry David Gray of the Eng
lish department, Shakespearean au
thority, speaking before the Philo
logical Association of the Pacific-
Coast in Los Angeles recently, term
ed the discovery "absolutely amazing
to those of us specializing in the
Shakespearean field."
Continuing with the charge that
previously studied "signatures" are
weak and indefinite, and that they
have led many authorities to believe
that lie was illiterate and incapable
of having written the masterpieces
which appear under his name, Dr.
Gray stated that the thin, unsteady
signatures were written in the bard's
latter years and that the style of the
newly discovered signature was
easily equal to that of any other
great penman of tlie day.
Good Penman
Reports that Dr. Van Patten had
picked up the signature in the shop
of one of the local book-sellers are
not correct. The signature was in a
San Francisco book shop.
The signature is pasted into a book
containing a collection of some 3000
autographs. Although no test of the
I paper or ink has yet been made, an
I attempt will be made in the near fu
j turn to determine the authenticity of
j the writing. However, according to
Dr. Gray, everything now known
about the signature points to its
genuineness.
"The signature of an expert pen
man," he said, "definitely disproves
the contentions of the Baconians and
anti-Stratfordites that Shakespeare
was an uneducated man incapable of
j producing the masterpieces attribut
ed to him. Although resembling the
existing "Will" signatures which are
. the shaky productions of an old man,
I this is a beautifully and surely exe
| cuted piece of handwriting."

Startling to scholars was the re
cent find by Dr. Nathan Van Patten,
director of the library, of a neat
scribble which has been condition
ally accepted as the signature of
William Shakespeare, bard of Avon.
A possible solution to one of lit
erature's most discussed mysteries—
the authenticity of Shakespeare's
writings—the signature indicates
that the dramatist was a cultured
and well-educated man, well quali
fied to have written the unequaled
comedies and tragedies which have
been credited to him.
Bar (I Well Educated
Dr. Henry David Gray of the Eng
lish department, Shakespearean au
thority, speaking before the Philo
logical Association of the Pacific-
Coast in Los Angeles recently, term
ed the discovery "absolutely amazing
to those of us specializing in the
Shakespearean field."
Continuing with the charge that
previously studied "signatures" are
weak and indefinite, and that they
have led many authorities to believe
that lie was illiterate and incapable
of having written the masterpieces
which appear under his name, Dr.
Gray stated that the thin, unsteady
signatures were written in the bard's
latter years and that the style of the
newly discovered signature was
easily equal to that of any other
great penman of tlie day.
Good Penman
Reports that Dr. Van Patten had
picked up the signature in the shop
of one of the local book-sellers are
not correct. The signature was in a
San Francisco book shop.
The signature is pasted into a book
containing a collection of some 3000
autographs. Although no test of the
I paper or ink has yet been made, an
I attempt will be made in the near fu
j turn to determine the authenticity of
j the writing. However, according to
Dr. Gray, everything now known
about the signature points to its
genuineness.
"The signature of an expert pen
man," he said, "definitely disproves
the contentions of the Baconians and
anti-Stratfordites that Shakespeare
was an uneducated man incapable of
j producing the masterpieces attribut
ed to him. Although resembling the
existing "Will" signatures which are
. the shaky productions of an old man,
I this is a beautifully and surely exe
| cuted piece of handwriting."
