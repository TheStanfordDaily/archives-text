# Stanford Instructor to Conduct European Tour Next Summer
## 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Just back from Europe? How did
you like it? Most tourists will an
swer, "If I ever go in another art
gallery as long as t live!" or, "I
missed so many things I should have
taken in."
A Stanford instructor, Stanley L.
Sharp of the German department,
has planned a tour that makes either
of the above answers unlikely. Last
year he took a group of 14 congenial
students through Europe on a trip
that was neither a Cook's tour nor a
pleasure cruise, and made it a great
success. Next summer he plans to go
again.
Nicest thing about the trip, all the
students agreed, was that an equal
number of boys and girls were along.
No girl suddenly found herself wilh
a mad desire to go dancing in Paris,
and no escort! Nobody was left out
of things because there weren't
enough women, or men, to go
around.
Want Even Number
"We hope to have an even number
next summer, also," Mr. Sharp stat
ed. "The primary object of the trip
is for everyone to enjoy himself and
see as much as he wishes to see,
while at the same time being per
fectly free to do as he likes. I find
that an evenly divided and congenial
group helps to make this possible."
Evidently the plan has been very
successful. Mr. Sharp hinted that
quite a nice crop of romances had
blossomed as a result of last year's
trip. "Not to mention how the Ger
mans liked our American girls," he
added.
Mr. Sharp has proved that you can
see Europe cheaply and comfortably
at the same time. Total cost of the
trip, from New York to New York,
including spending money and inci
dentals, was lass than $500 apiece.
"And at that," one student stated,
"the food everywhere was better
j than the Union's."

Last year the troup visited Eng
land. France, Germany. Holland, and
Austria. They took in the Olympics
and the Music Festival at Salzburg.
Next summer's itinerary will be
slightly different. They will skip
Austria—though students wanting to
go to the Music Festival will have a
chance to do so—and take in Bel
gium and Switzerland. If there is
time and everyone wants to do so.
they will visit the Scandinavian
countries.
"I've learned a lot from conducting
one tour," said Sharp. "Among other
things, we'll go over on a slow boat
next time; last year we took the
Europa and everyone enjoyed the
voyage so much we hated to dock."
Catch lip on Laundry
Another thing Mr. Scharp learned
was to take two or three days off
in the middle of the trip and stop at
some small attractive place to catch
up on laundry and correspondence,
rest, and do nothing. Last year it
was in the Black Forest. Next time
it will probably be somewhere along
the Rhine.
As all arrangements are made be
forehand, nobody has to worry about
luggage, accommodations, tickets.
Special provisions are made for stu
dents wanting to do particular things.
Last year the party split up over the
question of whether to stay in Mu
nich or climb the Zugsitze, highest
mountain in Germany. At Friedrich
shafen, the ones that wanted to say
they'd been to Switzerland hired a
motorboat and put-putted across the
border.
Hopes To Have 20
Next time Mr. Sharp hopes to get
at least 20 students together. "We
don't have any trouble getting the
girls," he said, "but I intend to con
tact eating clubs and fraternities in
an effort to get enough men and
keep the number even." Mrs. Sharp
will also go along next summer.
All interested students should turn

their names in to Mr. Sharp before
May 1. Last year the Stanford group
teamed up with a party from the
East and the tour became too un
wieldy. "For this reason, we do not
intend to take more than a maximum
of 25 students and will make the trip
alone," said Sharp.
The group will meet in New York
the last week in June and be back
there early in September. Mr. Sharp
pointed out that as arrangements are
already being made and a large
group is going the party will be giv
en special consideration everywhere
in regard to accommodations and
reservations.
