# Radio Hour Will Feature Three Student Speakers
## 
### 
Student speakers will take over
the Stanford Radio Hour next Mon
day evening at 8:30 o'clock, station
RGO, when a round-table discus
sion of "Trained Personnel in Gov
ernment Service" will be presented
under the direction of Robert R.
Gros, debate adviser.
The speakers, James Hill, Jack
Craven, and Fred Alexander, will
discuss the role of the expert in gov
ernment, stressing the fact that there
is today a great need for trained men
in government service, Mr. Gros said
today. It will also be pointed out
that the growing tendency of mod
ern universities to establish a cur
riculum of public service training
indicates that some progress has
been made toward preparing experts
to handle the affairs of government.
Remaining radio hour programs
for the rest of this quarter and dur
ing the Christmas holidays are as
follows:

December 14, "Disraeli," discussed
by Mr. William Irvine, instructor in
English; December 21, "The Chris
tian Paradox," by Dr. D. Elton True
blood; and December 28, "Biological
Research and Human Welfare," by
Dr. C. V. Taylor, professor of biol
ogy.
Of Disraeli Mr. li'vine says in pre
face to his forthcoming talk, "In a
sense his career was more remark
able than either that of Caesar or
Napoleon; one thing of which Dis

raeli knew little was the common
place."
The speaker on December 14 will
give his subject a comic treatment in
touching upon Disraeli's premiership
and in endeavoring to dispel the be
lief that the great statesman married
his wife for her money.
