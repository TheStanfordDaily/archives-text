# 'No Smoking In Finals' By-law To Be Enforced
## 
### 
Ex Committee's by-law pro
hibiting smoking during finals
will be enforced this quarter,
with sharp reprimand promised
for violators, it was announced
last night by Mary Belford and
Roy Anderson, chairmen of
Women's and Men's Councils.
"If you want to smoke, leave
the exam and go off the Quad,"
the judicial heads requested.
Last year the councils dealt
severely with several cases and
it is urged that all observe the
ruling next week.
