## Grid Title Overpower Sigma Nu In Spinal Garlic Dey, Wyeth, Dillon Shine As Curtain Falls On '36 Mural Grid Season 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
A nicely .silvered football trophy
will soon rest on the Phi Delta Theta
mantel.
It .signifies to all who may be
concerned that Phi Delta Theta us
ail-University 193(5 intramural foot
ball champion, by reason of a stun
ning 13-0 defeat administered to the
.slightly favored Sigma Nu squad
yesterday afternoon on the Grays'
Field.
The Phi Dolts were clearly the
superior team yesterday, not being
seriously threatened once during the
contest, and in addition completely
bottling up the Sigma Nu offense,
with the single exception of Eddie
Proctor's 25-yard ramble around
right end in the closing minutes.
"Abdul Ben" Dey Stars
Big Ben Dey, following up a
sizzling performance on Tuesday
against Business School I, was the
guiding 1 i£»ht and pace-setter for
the winners. "Abdul" personally ac
counted for 12 of the Phi Delts' 13
digits.
Early in the first half, the Phi
Delts capitalized on Proctor's errant
lateral pass, recovered by Jimmie
Dillon on the Sigma Nu 30, and on a
series of short passes, with De3' and
Ilagerty on the throwing end, found
themselves with a first down on
the 4.
On the first play of the new series,
Dey squeezed through to pay dirt in
the narrow gap between a frantically
clutching Larry Randall and the
sidelines. Mullen broke through to
squelch Wyeth's conversion try.
Sigma Nu Hard Pressed
For the remainder of the half, the
teams see-sawed back and forth
across the middle stripe, though,
with Dry's passes and his lofty punts,
the Phi Delts enjoyed a goodly part
of the upper hand.
In the second half, soon after the
kick-off, Proctor dropped one of
Dey's twisters, whereupon the ever
alert Dillon recovered for P.D.T. on
the 10. A couple of plays later Dey
seeped past the scrimmage line and
wcaved to a store from the 9. Wyeth
passed to Dillon for the extra point.
The Phi Delts' sturdy line play,
on top of Dey's triple threating, was
just a little too much for the faulty
blocking and hurried play of the
f.V'ored S.N.'s.
Line-ups: Phi Delta Theta—Wy
ith, Dey, M;tino, Judd, O'Brien, Dil
lon, Ilagerty, Paine and Seward.
Sigma Nu — Proctor, Richardson,
Jones, Linn, Mullen, Milligan, Ran
dall, Eakland. Referees—Allen and
Alustiza.
The Phi Delts confident after their
victory today, and embittered at not
placing a man on the all-Intramural
team, are contemplating challenging
the all-Stars for an informal plyaoff
next week.
