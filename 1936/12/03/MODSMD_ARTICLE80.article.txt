# Soccermen End Year Against U.S.F. Team
## 
### 
Captain Bob Hall will close an
outstanding college soccer career
this Saturday when he leads the
Stanford eleven in the season's final
game against the University of San
Francisco. Hall and his mates are
aiming for a handsome finish to the
tail's- competition which will net
them second place in the conference
standings.
"In all my years of coaching, I've
never had a finer captain than Bob
Hall," said Coach Harry Maloney.
"The impression he leaves on Stan
ford soccer will be long remem
bered."

Maloney praised his playing abil
ity, leadership, and sportsmanship
both on and oft the field. In his posi
tion at center half, Hall has no peer
in the league, and is rated a sure
thing for all-league choice. Hall is
one of four men to leave soccer thus
year, the others being Pete Knecht,
A 1 Dibble, and Primo Pinotti. Hall
and Kneoht will receive the block
"S" awards.
Coach Maloney will take 22 men
up to the City and plans that every
man shall see action. He has been
juggling the lineup around quite a
bit during the week but has a pretty
definite starting team ready now.
Helms or Faulb will take the net and
Hanna and Richardson will pair up
at the fullback posts.
Name Starting Lineup
Hatch, Hall, and Sloane are at
halves and Lowe will work at his
usual center forward post. Schaupp
and Chalmers are at inside right and
left respectively while the front line
is flanked by Nightingale and Parker.
Before the game is over, however,
theie may be considerable shuffling
and every man may find himself do
ing some other player's chores.
It is to be recalled that California
is king of the Bay soccer hill this
fall, the Bruins' only embarrassment
being a tie in their first San Fran
cisco game. U.S.F. and the Cards
have shaky records, but victory Sat
urday will do a lot to redeem the
winner.
