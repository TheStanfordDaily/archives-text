# Polo Subs Face Sacramento In Tilt Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
on the highway polo field members
of the Stanford second team will start
against the Sacramento Polo Club,
power unknown.
The valley club, newly organized
and strangers in these parts, is
composed of Luppe Luppen (2),
Stanford captain of a couple of years
ago, and other well known horsemen,
Louis Smith (1), and Licuts Hender
son (3), and Perryman (4), but it is
hard to dope out their strength in
advance as they haven't played much
as a team.
Coach Grubbs of the Cards is
therefore starting Hyde (1), McAus
land (2), Derby (3), and McClintock,
regular subs who will be given a
chance to see a full game of action if
the Sacramento bunch hasn't kept
too many fast practice sessions hid
den in the bag.
A week from this game the Indians
will play a return match with the
Monterey Presidio team, whom they
defeated 5-2 in their first engage
ment.
Another game scheduled for the
future that the Cards are looking
forward to is the return match with
the University of Arizona. The
southern boys defeated them
Thanksgiving Day 3-2 and the return
match scheduled for the next day
had to be called off.
