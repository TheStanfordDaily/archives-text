It is customary in this paper to write a book about the football season.!
Well, you've heard enough about it. Too bad the wins had to be away ,
from home, but I don't think anyone has anything but respect for Tiny
Thornliill's 1930 "kids." They may not have made a lot of scores, but
they sure gave vis a swell show while not doing it.
The important thing to me about the season was the change occasioned
in the "Thornhill" or modified Warner System. At the beginning they still j
were relying on the "A-right" and "A-left," or double wingbaeks, for
their fast and deceptive breakaway, while near the end less than a third
of the plays were off of these. (Stanford on any offensive play lines up: ;
Clark, Ferko, Matthews. Callaway, Stone while Chouch is in any ■

of the three middle intervals, depending on strong side;
left, right, or balanced line.)
The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |
also are on the way up. Time and again the shifts!
between these sets has crossed itp the defense enough '
to cause it to overshilt, and spring the tailback, be it
Coflis. Vigna, or Williams.
You can see that it was all a plan of Thornhill's to !
protect his weaknesses and fortify his strength, the l
weaknesses being a lack of p ofitable plunging through
any one part of the line, and the strength being the!
open field possibilities of the wingbaeks and the ends. 1
In 1937 the weaknesses and strength may be quite dif- i
ferent, and the whole thing will be changed.

How will things be next year? Well, from a Stanford viewpoint, much i
better. The conference will undoubtedly run another complete round
robin, giving us seven league games, and there will probably be a couple I
ol others, for one of which Columbia is already .signed up.
U.S.C. should take the place of the team to beat. You may be sick of |
hearing about Headman Jones' Sophomores, but the gent had an idea
there. It's any coach's dream to be able to send a complete team into a
game at one time, and it's another dream to be able to give twelve j
sophomores as much playing experience as they had. And Ambrose
Schindlcr hasn't begun to show what he has. The Trojans lose amongst !
others Captain Gil Kuhn, Davie Davis, Bill Iladovich, Max Belko, and
Bob Sanders.
California likewise takes an insignificant beating from graduation this
year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start
now. The Bears lose Floyd Blower. Gene McAteer. Eddie Vnllejo, Bill
Archer, and Ray Nordstrom.
The Huskies, though, are the ones to ponder on. For three years they've
had strong, tough players aplenty, but for two of those years the tension
was too much, and they cracked near the end of the campaign. This year
they were polished off early by Minnesota to release their nervousness, and
went through the year otherwise unmarred except for a 14-14 tie with
Stanford. That tie, although it didn't represent any better playing by the
Cards than in some others of their games, will be oi great use to many of us
in the after-dinner discussions of the coming holiday period. Washington,
thank heaven, loses amongst others By Ilaines, Jim Cain. Elmer Ix>gg, Ed
Nowogroski, John Wiatrak. Max Starccvich and Chuck Bond.
And Getting Closer to Home, Stanford—
Now. what about Stanford? Those missing when spring practice takes
up will be six in number. Cab Callaway was all-Coast when playing next
to Norgard and Topping in his first two years here, one of the iron men of
the team. Last year he missed because of being weakened by repeated at
tacks of bronchitis,' and this year, in spite of a loss of confidence to be
expected from a year's lay-off. Cab came back to make several all-Coast
second strings. No, he wasn't as spectacular as Zagar, because he defended
the weak side, playing a plugging game instead of a smashing one. But did
you notice the difference when Callaway wasn't in that hole?
Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr

The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |
also are on the way up. Time and again the shifts!
between these sets has crossed itp the defense enough '
to cause it to overshilt, and spring the tailback, be it
Coflis. Vigna, or Williams.
You can see that it was all a plan of Thornhill's to !
protect his weaknesses and fortify his strength, the l
weaknesses being a lack of p ofitable plunging through
any one part of the line, and the strength being the!
open field possibilities of the wingbaeks and the ends. 1
In 1937 the weaknesses and strength may be quite dif- i
ferent, and the whole thing will be changed.

How will things be next year? Well, from a Stanford viewpoint, much i
better. The conference will undoubtedly run another complete round
robin, giving us seven league games, and there will probably be a couple I
ol others, for one of which Columbia is already .signed up.
U.S.C. should take the place of the team to beat. You may be sick of |
hearing about Headman Jones' Sophomores, but the gent had an idea
there. It's any coach's dream to be able to send a complete team into a
game at one time, and it's another dream to be able to give twelve j
sophomores as much playing experience as they had. And Ambrose
Schindlcr hasn't begun to show what he has. The Trojans lose amongst !
others Captain Gil Kuhn, Davie Davis, Bill Iladovich, Max Belko, and
Bob Sanders.
California likewise takes an insignificant beating from graduation this
year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start
now. The Bears lose Floyd Blower. Gene McAteer. Eddie Vnllejo, Bill
Archer, and Ray Nordstrom.
The Huskies, though, are the ones to ponder on. For three years they've
had strong, tough players aplenty, but for two of those years the tension
was too much, and they cracked near the end of the campaign. This year
they were polished off early by Minnesota to release their nervousness, and
went through the year otherwise unmarred except for a 14-14 tie with
Stanford. That tie, although it didn't represent any better playing by the
Cards than in some others of their games, will be oi great use to many of us
in the after-dinner discussions of the coming holiday period. Washington,
thank heaven, loses amongst others By Ilaines, Jim Cain. Elmer Ix>gg, Ed
Nowogroski, John Wiatrak. Max Starccvich and Chuck Bond.
And Getting Closer to Home, Stanford—
Now. what about Stanford? Those missing when spring practice takes
up will be six in number. Cab Callaway was all-Coast when playing next
to Norgard and Topping in his first two years here, one of the iron men of
the team. Last year he missed because of being weakened by repeated at
tacks of bronchitis,' and this year, in spite of a loss of confidence to be
expected from a year's lay-off. Cab came back to make several all-Coast
second strings. No, he wasn't as spectacular as Zagar, because he defended
the weak side, playing a plugging game instead of a smashing one. But did
you notice the difference when Callaway wasn't in that hole?
Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr


TINY THORNHILL
Stanford
It is customary in this paper to write a book about the football season.!
Well, you've heard enough about it. Too bad the wins had to be away ,
from home, but I don't think anyone has anything but respect for Tiny
Thornliill's 1930 "kids." They may not have made a lot of scores, but
they sure gave vis a swell show while not doing it.
The important thing to me about the season was the change occasioned
in the "Thornhill" or modified Warner System. At the beginning they still j
were relying on the "A-right" and "A-left," or double wingbaeks, for
their fast and deceptive breakaway, while near the end less than a third
of the plays were off of these. (Stanford on any offensive play lines up: ;
Clark, Ferko, Matthews. Callaway, Stone while Chouch is in any ■

of the three middle intervals, depending on strong side;
left, right, or balanced line.)
The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |

How will things be next year? Well, from a Stanford viewpoint, much i
better. The conference will undoubtedly run another complete round
robin, giving us seven league games, and there will probably be a couple I
ol others, for one of which Columbia is already .signed up.
U.S.C. should take the place of the team to beat. You may be sick of |
hearing about Headman Jones' Sophomores, but the gent had an idea
there. It's any coach's dream to be able to send a complete team into a
game at one time, and it's another dream to be able to give twelve j
sophomores as much playing experience as they had. And Ambrose
Schindlcr hasn't begun to show what he has. The Trojans lose amongst !
others Captain Gil Kuhn, Davie Davis, Bill Iladovich, Max Belko, and
Bob Sanders.
California likewise takes an insignificant beating from graduation this
year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start
now. The Bears lose Floyd Blower. Gene McAteer. Eddie Vnllejo, Bill
Archer, and Ray Nordstrom.
The Huskies, though, are the ones to ponder on. For three years they've
had strong, tough players aplenty, but for two of those years the tension
was too much, and they cracked near the end of the campaign. This year
they were polished off early by Minnesota to release their nervousness, and
went through the year otherwise unmarred except for a 14-14 tie with
Stanford. That tie, although it didn't represent any better playing by the
Cards than in some others of their games, will be oi great use to many of us
in the after-dinner discussions of the coming holiday period. Washington,
thank heaven, loses amongst others By Ilaines, Jim Cain. Elmer Ix>gg, Ed
Nowogroski, John Wiatrak. Max Starccvich and Chuck Bond.
And Getting Closer to Home, Stanford—
Now. what about Stanford? Those missing when spring practice takes
up will be six in number. Cab Callaway was all-Coast when playing next
to Norgard and Topping in his first two years here, one of the iron men of
the team. Last year he missed because of being weakened by repeated at
tacks of bronchitis,' and this year, in spite of a loss of confidence to be
expected from a year's lay-off. Cab came back to make several all-Coast
second strings. No, he wasn't as spectacular as Zagar, because he defended
the weak side, playing a plugging game instead of a smashing one. But did
you notice the difference when Callaway wasn't in that hole?
Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr


TINY THORNHILL
Stanford
It is customary in this paper to write a book about the football season.!
Well, you've heard enough about it. Too bad the wins had to be away ,
from home, but I don't think anyone has anything but respect for Tiny
Thornliill's 1930 "kids." They may not have made a lot of scores, but
they sure gave vis a swell show while not doing it.
The important thing to me about the season was the change occasioned
in the "Thornhill" or modified Warner System. At the beginning they still j
were relying on the "A-right" and "A-left," or double wingbaeks, for
their fast and deceptive breakaway, while near the end less than a third
of the plays were off of these. (Stanford on any offensive play lines up: ;
Clark, Ferko, Matthews. Callaway, Stone while Chouch is in any ■

of the three middle intervals, depending on strong side;
left, right, or balanced line.)
The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |
also are on the way up. Time and again the shifts!
between these sets has crossed itp the defense enough '
to cause it to overshilt, and spring the tailback, be it
Coflis. Vigna, or Williams.
You can see that it was all a plan of Thornhill's to !
protect his weaknesses and fortify his strength, the l
weaknesses being a lack of p ofitable plunging through
any one part of the line, and the strength being the!
open field possibilities of the wingbaeks and the ends. 1
In 1937 the weaknesses and strength may be quite dif- i
ferent, and the whole thing will be changed.

year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start
now. The Bears lose Floyd Blower. Gene McAteer. Eddie Vnllejo, Bill
Archer, and Ray Nordstrom.
The Huskies, though, are the ones to ponder on. For three years they've
had strong, tough players aplenty, but for two of those years the tension
was too much, and they cracked near the end of the campaign. This year
they were polished off early by Minnesota to release their nervousness, and
went through the year otherwise unmarred except for a 14-14 tie with
Stanford. That tie, although it didn't represent any better playing by the
Cards than in some others of their games, will be oi great use to many of us
in the after-dinner discussions of the coming holiday period. Washington,
thank heaven, loses amongst others By Ilaines, Jim Cain. Elmer Ix>gg, Ed
Nowogroski, John Wiatrak. Max Starccvich and Chuck Bond.
And Getting Closer to Home, Stanford—
Now. what about Stanford? Those missing when spring practice takes
up will be six in number. Cab Callaway was all-Coast when playing next
to Norgard and Topping in his first two years here, one of the iron men of
the team. Last year he missed because of being weakened by repeated at
tacks of bronchitis,' and this year, in spite of a loss of confidence to be
expected from a year's lay-off. Cab came back to make several all-Coast
second strings. No, he wasn't as spectacular as Zagar, because he defended
the weak side, playing a plugging game instead of a smashing one. But did
you notice the difference when Callaway wasn't in that hole?
Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr


TINY THORNHILL
Stanford
It is customary in this paper to write a book about the football season.!
Well, you've heard enough about it. Too bad the wins had to be away ,
from home, but I don't think anyone has anything but respect for Tiny
Thornliill's 1930 "kids." They may not have made a lot of scores, but
they sure gave vis a swell show while not doing it.
The important thing to me about the season was the change occasioned
in the "Thornhill" or modified Warner System. At the beginning they still j
were relying on the "A-right" and "A-left," or double wingbaeks, for
their fast and deceptive breakaway, while near the end less than a third
of the plays were off of these. (Stanford on any offensive play lines up: ;
Clark, Ferko, Matthews. Callaway, Stone while Chouch is in any ■

of the three middle intervals, depending on strong side;
left, right, or balanced line.)
The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |
also are on the way up. Time and again the shifts!
between these sets has crossed itp the defense enough '
to cause it to overshilt, and spring the tailback, be it
Coflis. Vigna, or Williams.
You can see that it was all a plan of Thornhill's to !
protect his weaknesses and fortify his strength, the l
weaknesses being a lack of p ofitable plunging through
any one part of the line, and the strength being the!
open field possibilities of the wingbaeks and the ends. 1
In 1937 the weaknesses and strength may be quite dif- i
ferent, and the whole thing will be changed.

How will things be next year? Well, from a Stanford viewpoint, much i
better. The conference will undoubtedly run another complete round
robin, giving us seven league games, and there will probably be a couple I
ol others, for one of which Columbia is already .signed up.
U.S.C. should take the place of the team to beat. You may be sick of |
hearing about Headman Jones' Sophomores, but the gent had an idea
there. It's any coach's dream to be able to send a complete team into a
game at one time, and it's another dream to be able to give twelve j
sophomores as much playing experience as they had. And Ambrose
Schindlcr hasn't begun to show what he has. The Trojans lose amongst !
others Captain Gil Kuhn, Davie Davis, Bill Iladovich, Max Belko, and
Bob Sanders.
California likewise takes an insignificant beating from graduation this
year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start

thank heaven, loses amongst others By Ilaines, Jim Cain. Elmer Ix>gg, Ed
Nowogroski, John Wiatrak. Max Starccvich and Chuck Bond.
And Getting Closer to Home, Stanford—
Now. what about Stanford? Those missing when spring practice takes
up will be six in number. Cab Callaway was all-Coast when playing next
to Norgard and Topping in his first two years here, one of the iron men of
the team. Last year he missed because of being weakened by repeated at
tacks of bronchitis,' and this year, in spite of a loss of confidence to be
expected from a year's lay-off. Cab came back to make several all-Coast
second strings. No, he wasn't as spectacular as Zagar, because he defended
the weak side, playing a plugging game instead of a smashing one. But did
you notice the difference when Callaway wasn't in that hole?
Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr


TINY THORNHILL
Stanford
It is customary in this paper to write a book about the football season.!
Well, you've heard enough about it. Too bad the wins had to be away ,
from home, but I don't think anyone has anything but respect for Tiny
Thornliill's 1930 "kids." They may not have made a lot of scores, but
they sure gave vis a swell show while not doing it.
The important thing to me about the season was the change occasioned
in the "Thornhill" or modified Warner System. At the beginning they still j
were relying on the "A-right" and "A-left," or double wingbaeks, for
their fast and deceptive breakaway, while near the end less than a third
of the plays were off of these. (Stanford on any offensive play lines up: ;
Clark, Ferko, Matthews. Callaway, Stone while Chouch is in any ■

of the three middle intervals, depending on strong side;
left, right, or balanced line.)
The movement, though, has been toward "C-right" I
and "C-left," the single wings, with all the backs piled
up on the strong side, ready to go. And the "Y" or short |
punt balanced line, "C-spread" and 'Zagar eligible" |
also are on the way up. Time and again the shifts!
between these sets has crossed itp the defense enough '
to cause it to overshilt, and spring the tailback, be it
Coflis. Vigna, or Williams.
You can see that it was all a plan of Thornhill's to !
protect his weaknesses and fortify his strength, the l
weaknesses being a lack of p ofitable plunging through
any one part of the line, and the strength being the!
open field possibilities of the wingbaeks and the ends. 1
In 1937 the weaknesses and strength may be quite dif- i
ferent, and the whole thing will be changed.

How will things be next year? Well, from a Stanford viewpoint, much i
better. The conference will undoubtedly run another complete round
robin, giving us seven league games, and there will probably be a couple I
ol others, for one of which Columbia is already .signed up.
U.S.C. should take the place of the team to beat. You may be sick of |
hearing about Headman Jones' Sophomores, but the gent had an idea
there. It's any coach's dream to be able to send a complete team into a
game at one time, and it's another dream to be able to give twelve j
sophomores as much playing experience as they had. And Ambrose
Schindlcr hasn't begun to show what he has. The Trojans lose amongst !
others Captain Gil Kuhn, Davie Davis, Bill Iladovich, Max Belko, and
Bob Sanders.
California likewise takes an insignificant beating from graduation this
year. California can play good football, and the unfortunate part is that
they know it. But they haven't been kingpins for thirteen years, come
good material and come bad, and there's no reason why they should start
now. The Bears lose Floyd Blower. Gene McAteer. Eddie Vnllejo, Bill
Archer, and Ray Nordstrom.
The Huskies, though, are the ones to ponder on. For three years they've
had strong, tough players aplenty, but for two of those years the tension
was too much, and they cracked near the end of the campaign. This year
they were polished off early by Minnesota to release their nervousness, and
went through the year otherwise unmarred except for a 14-14 tie with
Stanford. That tie, although it didn't represent any better playing by the
Cards than in some others of their games, will be oi great use to many of us
in the after-dinner discussions of the coming holiday period. Washington,

Captain Earl lloos will be another one to go, a three-year man after
playing on the Grays last year waiting for Frank Alustiza to finish. "Maw"
even proved his worth by getting a letter under Frank in '34. and came
back this time to boost Stanford's already slim chances 100 per cent. The
kid can block, and he knows football. He'll be missed.
Fred Williams is also going to leave. One of the speediest men and best
punters around here the past three seasons, he had the misfortune to play
behind Grayson up until this year, when he was shoved to right half, a
place where a ball carrier isn't terribly apt to show. Rog Munger is an
other senior, defender and pass-catcher de luxe, as he showed in the
last Big Game.
Carl Schott, who won the 1934 Big Game by blocking the punt that led to
Bones Hamilton's touchdown, and later kicking the field goal that was the
margin of Stanford's 9-7 victory, has made a couple of letters at the same
time Keith Topping was here. Bob Mangan, the remaining senior, is a right
tackle, did fine work plugging the hole this year.
By Positions, Names May Make News:
Left Ends: Jack Clark is coming back, having made everybody's all-
Coast, and at least two second string all-Americans. Clark defends the
strong side, and does it well. Chet Olcott, a tough kid whose season this
year was spoiled by death in the family, Irv Cuinmings, '39, who really
catches passes. Andy Stojkovich. and Hal Saunders will be back.
Right Ends: Grant Stone has everything—he's fast, and strong, and agile.
As soon as Stone gets enough confidence to completely let himself go out
on the field, he'll be a world-beater. Neil Rasmussen, fast, and ahead of
Stone at the start of this season, will be back battling for the post. Bob
Dakan. heavy and rugged, Don Butler, fast and plenty clever with his
hands, and Walt liege, a better end on the '39 frosh than was Cummings,
are other competitors. Bill Willard and Bill Greer of '40 don't look bad,
either.
Left tackles: Pete Zagar. crashing, punt-blocking, ball-hawking all-
Coaster, will return for two more years at the "inside" tackle job. "Ren
frew" was catching tackle-eligible passes this year in practice, and his
fame is just beginning to spread. New York has seen him. By West, a
tower of defensive strength, plays this hole, as does Dick Shannon, a re
serve this year, and Sam Beckley, a big fellow who spent the year with
the Grays.
Right tackles: This is Callaway's hole, and already they arc grooming
Stan Andersen, lead man of the '40 team, for the spot. Anderseri is a sec
ond Zagar, 210 pounds, deadly on his charging. Pop Grant also plays this
spot, and will probably be back with some good work, although he may
graduate this time. Russ McKinney, '38, and Dave Carnahan, '39, were
both outstanding as regulars on their freshman teams.
Left guard: Leo Ferko will be back for his second year at the weak
side guard position. Everybody knows the work that Ferk has done there
this year, getting little credit because his job is to plug, not smash. Don
McMillan and Dick Brigham. reserves this year whom Thornhill sent in any
time, will return, while Chuck Drace and Fred Gustafson still will be at it.
Right guard: Bob Matthews, who did a lot of playing even when Rouble
was here, and who started that touchdown rush up at Oregon State, will
be back for his third year. Jay Holdridgc, his replacement, also will return,
but may be shifted to right half, which he played with great ability at
Kiski. Ed Gamier may be a guard next year . And Frank McMillan, said
by some to be even tougher than his brother, will be a candidate for this
floating position, as will Ernie Damarus, strongest of the frosh guards.
Centers: The center spot will be especially strong; Chooch is a senior,
but will play his last year while going to Med School next time. Nellie
Hcalh, who was a dandy center with the '38 frosh, and who wrenched his
knee at the beginning of this year, is in A-1 shape again and ready to go.
Dick Sutton and Tony Mccia, '40 centers, both have three more years
available, while Hugh Radke is coming up from '40, and there is rumor of
moving Calvclli back in the line.
Quarterbacks: Patilnian will undoubtedly be a quarterback next time,
leading plays and either passing off a reverse from the full or a direct pass
from center. "Wimp" should be back in school next quarter and better
than ever. Wally dcWitt. '39 frosh. Ed Garnicr, and Gene C'oldiron.
'40 frosh, are other possibilities.
Left Halfbacks: Jimmy Coflis should be pretty well entrenched hero,
but Pete Fay, '39 frosh, Jack lluehel, '39 frosh, Leo Madlcm, and Chad
Reade of the '40 frosh will also play this ball currying position. And you
can't forget Doc Luckctt. the place-kicker, who is one of the best signal
callers out there.
Right Halfbacks: Joe Vigna's coming back, and will Ik- plenty much
rushed by Holdridgc and Bill Kirseh, both of whom ore masters at hitting
that tackle. Tom Collins, a good runner and kicker, may compete for this
position. And Shipkey still likes Tom Walker and Jerry Sparling of the
'40 frosh.
Fullbacks: The key position will again be uncertain, with Jake Brigham
and Glenn Hamilton both ranking high because of their triple threat abil
ities. Calvclli is still labeled by Thornhill as one of the best passers to
hit Stanford in an age, atid if Stanford is a passing team next year, Cal»
velli will be throwing. But don't forget Chet Pulton of '40. a crasher like
the doctor prescribes. How's it look? Are we gonna ride? —Klaubcr
