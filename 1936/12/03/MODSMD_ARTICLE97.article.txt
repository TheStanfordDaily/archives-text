# Water Polo Originally 'Football in Water'
## 
### JACK MURRIETA (Freshman Water Polo Coach 
When the ordinary water polo
spectator views a struggle between
two teams in the water, he may not
realize that all the ducking, splash
ing, and fussing about is all part of
a thiilling scientific game with an
interesting history.
The game of football in the water,
now known as water polo, had its
origin in London in 1#74, being
founded by William Wilson, although
there are no records to show that he
took definite steps to develop the
game.
Because of the fact that in 1870
swimming exhibitions were on a def
inite decline, the London Swimming
Club formed a committee to draw
up a set of rules for football in the
water, with the idea of developing a
spectacular side to swimming.
First Game In 1874
In 1874 a water football game,,
played in the Crystal Palace in Lon
don, was the first of its kipd ever
teen. An article of a newspaper of
that time states, "After a severe
struggle the ball burst, but the
players, nothing daunted and prop
erly habited, displayed their aquatic
accomplishments for some time."
A few days later another game was
attempted. Eleven players were on
a team and the playing field was 40
by <i0 yards. The players sat in row
boats at the goal line. A rubber soc
cer ball bladder was placed in the
middle of the field and at the proper
signal the players jumped out of the
boats into the water. One player
stayed in the boat to act as a goal
guard. The play could not be fin
ished because the ball again burst.
Goal Posts Not Used
Up to this time goal pbsts were not
used, and the method of scoring was
to swim with the ball arid place it
on a platform or boat at the end of
the field of play. It soon became
realized by the interested fpllowers
of the game that if the game were
improved and developed under
proper conditions, it would result in
a fine game and become a popular
pastime for the swimmers. And so,
year by year, minor improvements
were made. Rules were laid down,
and goal posts wex - e used, through
\vhich the ball could be thrown.
Very little change took place in
the rules until 1888 when a com
mittee, composed of four men, was
formed and the rules were revised,
drawn up, and accepted. The rules
were very similar to those used to
day. However, due to the difficulty,
with the resulting confusion and
unpleasantness, that the referees had
in interpreting the rules, a new In
-1 ternational Water Polo Board was
formed in 1929. A few minor inter
l pretations have since been made at
; the Board's regular annual meetings.
Popularity Gains
Late in the nineteenth century, the
countries in Europe took a great
liking to the game of water polo fol

lowing its popularization in England.
The game of water polo was intro
duced into the United in 1880.
about ten years after it.s wrigin in
England. In the years the sport was
being developed, games were chiefly
interclub affairs. At it.s outset a soit
ball was used in the game.
Brains Replace Brawn
As the early game gradually
changed in character, and the hard
soccer ball was substituted for the
partly inflated rubber ball, team play
became a question of skill and tech
nique instead of brute strength, j
However, because of the small pools j
in the East, difficulty was encoun
tered in playing a fast breaking
game.
Enthusiasts of the East decided to
develop the soft ball game in addi
tion to the improved game. As a re
sult there are two games now played
in America—the International Wa
ter Polo game (seen here at Stan
ford) and the American Soft Ball
Water Polo. The latter is limited
only to the East at the present time.
In this game anything is allowed—
gouging, biting, ducking, kicking,
and many other pastimes.
It is nothing to have a player with
drawn from the tank with a frac
tured skuil as a result of being
"cracked" against the side of the
pool. In 19114 the A.A.U. recognized
the soft ball as well as the inter
national game at the annual national
championships. The international
game is by for the more popular.
Two Kinds of FouK
The spectator is often confused and
unknowing of rules of water polo. In
the international game there are two
types of fouls, an ordinary foul and
a wilful foul. If the latter type of
foul is committed by the player, he
is asked to leave the field of play
until a goal is scored. Wilful fouls
include such articles as holding,
moving after the whistle has blown,
entering an opponent's two-yard
line preceding the ball, and deliber
ate ducking. If the wilful foul oc
curs within the four-yard area of
the player committing the foul, he
is not only ordered from the water
but a penalty shot is also awarded
to the player on whom the wilful
foul was committed. For an ordinary
foul the fouled player is merely al
lowed a free throw (he is allowed io
pass to another player without any
; hindrance).
Water polo has always been one
of the most popular of sports here,
|at Stanford. An indication of this
is shown by the following list of
Pacific Coast championships Stan
ford has held:
