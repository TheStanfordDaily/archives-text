# Forced to Quit Everything Must Go
## 
### 
The reason that The Daily quits this week is
because Finais are coming. The reason that The
Daily quits on Thursday instead of Friday, is one
of those problems ol life, which sound very
logical when the business manager explains
them to you, but which fail awfully flat when you
tell somebody else.
There are two sorrowful things about The
Daily's quitting before finals. One is the awful,
deadening pain of ihe realization that the campus
gets along so well without a newspaper. The
other is that it means that the end-quarter mes
merized memorizing commences.
And nobody should mind this hysterical lunge
at the books if it weren't for the fact that the
emptiness of the process from the standpoint of
learning were not so visible.
The ratmaze and inspiration-expiration people
have made studies in memory. Their results
indicate, true enough, that reviewing from time
to time aids memory. This is a fine argument
for exes except when )ou take time out to con
sider what it is that finals make you remember.
Finals are given by professors. Most professors
have been professors for quite a long time. They
may know which way Hughes voted in the Gold
Clause decision, but they haven't heard about
what's going on in psychology or sociology
since 1300. Their class-room spell-binding and
their blue-book fact-finding is not based on sci
entific application of learning principles, and
with our class-average criterion of culture, they
don't need to care if the students are learning
anything, only that they are tested for grades.
Finals as they are now weighted give the palm
to the boy with >he greatest capacity for No-Doz,
the dew-covered youth who does not have the
intelligence to realize that memorizing the five
cardinal points (and there are always five) of
why there was democracy on the frontier, of
why cost of production equals selling price, will
never teil him the real reason. Finals penalize
learning because they make it an opportunity
for the horseplay of the grading system. They
stultify intelligence because they try to tell the
student that what is important is not important.
Finals make he academic chase a squirrel-cage
because they say to the student: "You are taking
courses to exorcise your mind. It is all a game,
wheie you sit down throe times a year to see
how much you can remember. If you do well
you get a good grade saying that you slept well
the night before; that your pulse is sound, that
your eyesight is good, that you can read well
and fast. The less you learn the better off you
are, becauso to learn that something is essential
inhibits the memory of things trivial." And if
you are a good little animal you get a good little
grade, which is all that matters.
The laws of learning say that review helps you
remember. Bat they also say that what is not
used is forgotten. The Time Schedule whips the
student around from course to course. The end
quarter examination has whispered in the stu
dent's ear: "0.K., you're finished, forget that as
soon as possible, because it will inhibit your
learning of your next quarter's course. If you
want to be a Phi Bete, you have to. mobilize your
talents efficiently. Don't be naive enough to
think you're supposed to know anything."
The result is that the student who doer, the
efficient thing does not get deep enough in one
course to see that it has anything to do with
his next ono. He can't see any reason why Psych
or Soc. should have anything to do with History
114. So by the time he has taken twelve suc
cessive quarters, he cannot understand why any
thing should havs anything to do v/ith anything.
And although he has reviewed twelve succes
sive times he has rot remembered the five
reasons why there wa3 democracy on the fron
tier, and he has not learned any consistent
philosophy.
He does not understand why he does things,
why Rooseveit does things, why America does
things,*and he does not sec why he should care

about politics. He has swallowed a host of
unassimilated facts. He is gorged with trivia.
He is the mass-production college graduate, that
supreme sacrifice on the altar of the constipated
curiosity.
But it isn't as easy as it looks. If you banish
finals you've got to have something for your
"records" (record, of course, being more impor
tant than learning). There's a little something
to think about in spare time, though, and that is
that if enough people thing strongly enough on
things, ways may be found to overcome diffi
culties.
If the records are important, it should be im
portant that they be accurate indexes of learning.
Therefore, they should not be a patchwork. If
they really want some records they could devise
a comprehensive final at the end of the four
years which would test the student, not on the
unassimilated facts, but upon the things he had
been able to learn, the little ideas he had been
able to piece together, the philosophy of life
that he had been able to evolve from his differ
ent courses. It would be a test to find out the
things you are supposed to learn in a liberal arts
college. Those who had not learned anything
(roughly, at the present writing: 75 per cent)
would get a certificate of four year's residence.
Those who had learned something would get the
A.B. and should have their tuition refunded by
the Government, because America needs people
who have learned something in college, and
could well afford to pay for the novelty. The
word "learn" and its derivatives have been used
15 times in this edit.

tant than learning). There's a little something
to think about in spare time, though, and that is
that if enough people thing strongly enough on
things, ways may be found to overcome diffi
culties.
If the records are important, it should be im
portant that they be accurate indexes of learning.
Therefore, they should not be a patchwork. If
they really want some records they could devise
a comprehensive final at the end of the four
years which would test the student, not on the
unassimilated facts, but upon the things he had
been able to learn, the little ideas he had been
able to piece together, the philosophy of life
that he had been able to evolve from his differ
ent courses. It would be a test to find out the
things you are supposed to learn in a liberal arts
college. Those who had not learned anything
(roughly, at the present writing: 75 per cent)
would get a certificate of four year's residence.
Those who had learned something would get the
A.B. and should have their tuition refunded by
the Government, because America needs people
who have learned something in college, and
could well afford to pay for the novelty. The
word "learn" and its derivatives have been used
15 times in this edit.
The reason that The Daily quits this week is
because Finais are coming. The reason that The
Daily quits on Thursday instead of Friday, is one
of those problems ol life, which sound very
logical when the business manager explains
them to you, but which fail awfully flat when you
tell somebody else.
There are two sorrowful things about The
Daily's quitting before finals. One is the awful,
deadening pain of ihe realization that the campus
gets along so well without a newspaper. The
other is that it means that the end-quarter mes
merized memorizing commences.
And nobody should mind this hysterical lunge
at the books if it weren't for the fact that the
emptiness of the process from the standpoint of
learning were not so visible.
The ratmaze and inspiration-expiration people
have made studies in memory. Their results
indicate, true enough, that reviewing from time
to time aids memory. This is a fine argument
for exes except when )ou take time out to con
sider what it is that finals make you remember.
Finals are given by professors. Most professors
have been professors for quite a long time. They
may know which way Hughes voted in the Gold
Clause decision, but they haven't heard about
what's going on in psychology or sociology
since 1300. Their class-room spell-binding and
their blue-book fact-finding is not based on sci
entific application of learning principles, and
with our class-average criterion of culture, they
don't need to care if the students are learning
anything, only that they are tested for grades.
Finals as they are now weighted give the palm
to the boy with >he greatest capacity for No-Doz,
the dew-covered youth who does not have the
intelligence to realize that memorizing the five
cardinal points (and there are always five) of
why there was democracy on the frontier, of
why cost of production equals selling price, will
never teil him the real reason. Finals penalize
learning because they make it an opportunity
for the horseplay of the grading system. They
stultify intelligence because they try to tell the
student that what is important is not important.
Finals make he academic chase a squirrel-cage
because they say to the student: "You are taking
courses to exorcise your mind. It is all a game,
wheie you sit down throe times a year to see
how much you can remember. If you do well
you get a good grade saying that you slept well
the night before; that your pulse is sound, that
your eyesight is good, that you can read well
and fast. The less you learn the better off you
are, becauso to learn that something is essential
inhibits the memory of things trivial." And if
you are a good little animal you get a good little
grade, which is all that matters.
The laws of learning say that review helps you
remember. Bat they also say that what is not
used is forgotten. The Time Schedule whips the
student around from course to course. The end
quarter examination has whispered in the stu
dent's ear: "0.K., you're finished, forget that as
soon as possible, because it will inhibit your
learning of your next quarter's course. If you
want to be a Phi Bete, you have to. mobilize your
talents efficiently. Don't be naive enough to
think you're supposed to know anything."
The result is that the student who doer, the
efficient thing does not get deep enough in one
course to see that it has anything to do with
his next ono. He can't see any reason why Psych
or Soc. should have anything to do with History
114. So by the time he has taken twelve suc
cessive quarters, he cannot understand why any
thing should havs anything to do v/ith anything.
And although he has reviewed twelve succes
sive times he has rot remembered the five
reasons why there wa3 democracy on the fron
tier, and he has not learned any consistent
philosophy.
He does not understand why he does things,
why Rooseveit does things, why America does
things,*and he does not sec why he should care

about politics. He has swallowed a host of
unassimilated facts. He is gorged with trivia.
He is the mass-production college graduate, that
supreme sacrifice on the altar of the constipated
curiosity.
But it isn't as easy as it looks. If you banish
finals you've got to have something for your
"records" (record, of course, being more impor
tant than learning). There's a little something
to think about in spare time, though, and that is

want to be a Phi Bete, you have to. mobilize your
talents efficiently. Don't be naive enough to
think you're supposed to know anything."
The result is that the student who doer, the
efficient thing does not get deep enough in one
course to see that it has anything to do with
his next ono. He can't see any reason why Psych
or Soc. should have anything to do with History
114. So by the time he has taken twelve suc
cessive quarters, he cannot understand why any
thing should havs anything to do v/ith anything.
And although he has reviewed twelve succes
sive times he has rot remembered the five
reasons why there wa3 democracy on the fron
tier, and he has not learned any consistent
philosophy.
He does not understand why he does things,
why Rooseveit does things, why America does
things,*and he does not sec why he should care

about politics. He has swallowed a host of
unassimilated facts. He is gorged with trivia.
He is the mass-production college graduate, that
supreme sacrifice on the altar of the constipated
curiosity.
But it isn't as easy as it looks. If you banish
finals you've got to have something for your
"records" (record, of course, being more impor
tant than learning). There's a little something
to think about in spare time, though, and that is
that if enough people thing strongly enough on
things, ways may be found to overcome diffi
culties.
If the records are important, it should be im
portant that they be accurate indexes of learning.
Therefore, they should not be a patchwork. If
they really want some records they could devise
a comprehensive final at the end of the four
years which would test the student, not on the
unassimilated facts, but upon the things he had
been able to learn, the little ideas he had been
able to piece together, the philosophy of life
that he had been able to evolve from his differ
ent courses. It would be a test to find out the
things you are supposed to learn in a liberal arts
college. Those who had not learned anything
(roughly, at the present writing: 75 per cent)
would get a certificate of four year's residence.
Those who had learned something would get the
A.B. and should have their tuition refunded by
the Government, because America needs people
who have learned something in college, and
could well afford to pay for the novelty. The
word "learn" and its derivatives have been used
15 times in this edit.
The reason that The Daily quits this week is
because Finais are coming. The reason that The
Daily quits on Thursday instead of Friday, is one
of those problems ol life, which sound very
logical when the business manager explains
them to you, but which fail awfully flat when you
tell somebody else.
There are two sorrowful things about The
Daily's quitting before finals. One is the awful,
deadening pain of ihe realization that the campus
gets along so well without a newspaper. The
other is that it means that the end-quarter mes
merized memorizing commences.
And nobody should mind this hysterical lunge
at the books if it weren't for the fact that the
emptiness of the process from the standpoint of
learning were not so visible.
The ratmaze and inspiration-expiration people
have made studies in memory. Their results
indicate, true enough, that reviewing from time
to time aids memory. This is a fine argument
for exes except when )ou take time out to con
sider what it is that finals make you remember.
Finals are given by professors. Most professors
have been professors for quite a long time. They
may know which way Hughes voted in the Gold
Clause decision, but they haven't heard about
what's going on in psychology or sociology
since 1300. Their class-room spell-binding and
their blue-book fact-finding is not based on sci
entific application of learning principles, and
with our class-average criterion of culture, they
don't need to care if the students are learning
anything, only that they are tested for grades.
Finals as they are now weighted give the palm
to the boy with >he greatest capacity for No-Doz,
the dew-covered youth who does not have the
intelligence to realize that memorizing the five
cardinal points (and there are always five) of
why there was democracy on the frontier, of
why cost of production equals selling price, will
never teil him the real reason. Finals penalize
learning because they make it an opportunity
for the horseplay of the grading system. They
stultify intelligence because they try to tell the
student that what is important is not important.
Finals make he academic chase a squirrel-cage
because they say to the student: "You are taking
courses to exorcise your mind. It is all a game,
wheie you sit down throe times a year to see
how much you can remember. If you do well
you get a good grade saying that you slept well
the night before; that your pulse is sound, that
your eyesight is good, that you can read well
and fast. The less you learn the better off you
are, becauso to learn that something is essential
inhibits the memory of things trivial." And if
you are a good little animal you get a good little
grade, which is all that matters.
The laws of learning say that review helps you
remember. Bat they also say that what is not
used is forgotten. The Time Schedule whips the
student around from course to course. The end
quarter examination has whispered in the stu
dent's ear: "0.K., you're finished, forget that as
soon as possible, because it will inhibit your
learning of your next quarter's course. If you
want to be a Phi Bete, you have to. mobilize your
talents efficiently. Don't be naive enough to
