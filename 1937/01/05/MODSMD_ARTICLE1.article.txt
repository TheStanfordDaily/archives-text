# New Wings For Lagunita Await Okeh
## Construction To Begin In February if Board Of Trustees Approves 
### 
Completion of plans for two new
wings to be added to Lagunita Court,
probably beginning early in Febru
ary, was announced yesterday by
Comptroller Almon E. Roth. The
project now awaits official approval
by the Board of Trustees.
The two additions, housing 44
women each, will stand respectively
east and west of the present rearmost
wings, connecting with them by en
closed arcades similar to the arcades
connecting the existing four units.
Carry Out Plan
The new wings will carry out the
plan of dividing the living hall into
small living units or "casas." Each
will have its own social roeffn, but
these rooms will be in the respective
main buildings, not separate as are
the present ones.
Access to the new units will be
through the two wings nearest the
dining room. No additional dining
room space will be needed to accom
modate the greater number of
women.
Steel Frame Type
The structures will be of the "steel
frame" type, similar to the present
units of Lagunita Court. This type
of structure is quite similar to wood
frame construction, except that steel
members are welded together in
place of the wooden joist and studs.
It is very much different than the
"skyscraper" type of construction
used in the Memorial Theater, which
employs large steel members and re
inforced concrete.
It is expected that the new units
will be completed in time for occu
pancy next fall quarter.
