# Farm Big-Wigs Make Resolutions For 1937
## 
### 
To what extent do Stanford stu
dents ljelieve in making New Year's
resolutions? That was the object of
a survey made yesterday by the
Daily.
Jim Hill, debate manager, has re
solved: "To dance like Fred A.staire,
to sing like Dick Powell, and to
make love like Robert Taylorâ€”in
short, to be as much like Bob Mal
lett as possible,"
Mallett has resolved to "remem* i
her all of the New Year's resolutions I
I have forgotten in the past ten
years."
Gordy Mallatratt, head Encina

sponsor, sounds a sharp warning to
all frosh, in coming out for "no more
water bags in Enema."
When Leo Stearns was asked, she
said that "I don't believe in them."
Barney Greenlee, Chi-O hasher,
rationalized: "I Rave up smoking
because my friends quit furnishing
the weeds."
Many do not believe in making
resolutions at all. T. M. McDanicl,
I rally committee chairman, was char
i acteristie in his declaration: "Well,
to tell you the truth, I had not con
sidered making any resolutions this
year. I generally break them the
i first week when L do make thorn."
