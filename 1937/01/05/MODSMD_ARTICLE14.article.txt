# Rains Restore Romance To Lagunita Lake
## 
### 
Lagunita, the campus's romantic
little lake, is coming into its own.
Students, returning from Christ
mas vacation, found that about a
quarter of the bed of the lake is
filled with water ,accumulating
from the recent rains.
The hoathousc is still separated
from the water by a "beach" of
some 35 feet. At the tower there is
four feet of water. The only craft
in view, floating along the water's
edge, is a mixture between a Ha
waiian outrigger and an Indian war
canoe. The other canoes arc still
stored in the hoathousc.
So now the freshmen and other
newcomers whose only impression
of Uagunita has been a dry bed
with the !sig Game bonfire in the
center, can go down and get an
idea of how they arc going to spend
the spring quarter.
