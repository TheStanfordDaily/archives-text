# Cops 'Bow Out' For Kidnaper
## Hunt Cancelled To Aid Return of Charles 
### 
Washington State law enforcement
i agencies, Tacoma police and even
the G-men had their guns back in
I their holsters today, helplessly wait
j ing for Charles Mattson, 10-year-
I old kidnapped Tacoma boy, to be
' brought home.
To Save a Life
For the first time in history, police
I retired to allow a criminal to con
. summate his crime and save a life.
I Their unprecedented action came in
j answer to a "stop search" plea by
j Dr. William W. Mattson, the lad's
I father, so the hook-nosed fiend who
Ikus held his son more than a week
[ can deliver and collect.
Murder Possible
I Else, he feared, the kidnaper might
I be goaded to desperation by the in
i tense state-wide man-hunt and take
1 the conventional "kidnaper's easiest
L | way."
' He asked for complete non-inter
ference yesterday in a formal state
• ment to newspapermen in his office.
1 Immediately, Chief William Cole
• of the Washington State highway
• patrol called off his squads, stopped
i I an intense manhunt in the vicinity
j of Shelton, 50 miles west of Olympia,
j and abolished all road blockades,
t j while G-men promised no inter
f j ference with ransom negotiations
j j and Tacoma police chief Harold P.
r Bird ordered complete inactivity,
1 "until we get the word to go."
l Added support to the belief that
i the kidnaper had threatened death
. to Charles unless he were left alone
was a new want ad inserted in the
. Seattle Times, emphasizing that
"channels are entirely clear." Like
j the first advertisement it was signed
? "Ann," and was addressed to "Ma
, bel."
