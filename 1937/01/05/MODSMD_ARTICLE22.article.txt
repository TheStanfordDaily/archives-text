### WALT PETERSON 
(Special lo The Daily)
ST. PAUL, Jan. 3 (UP).â€”Stan
ford Indians smothered Hamline
College, 58-26 in an intersectional
basketball tili here tonight before
a crowd of 3000.
Angelo Luisetti, forward, was
high-point man, ringing up 17
points on six baskets and five free
throws. Luisetti played a little over
one half. Howell Turner, also a
Stanford forward, tallied 11 points
to tic for second scoring honors
with Vic Olsen, Hamline forward.
The first half was played without
the customary center jump. At
half time Stanford lead 26-18.

Cutting a wide and vicious swath
through Eastern and Mid-Western
basketball circles that had sports
writers gaping at the antics of Hank
Luisetti and the rest of the "Crimson
Giants,' Stanford's varsity hoopmen
close their transcontinental tour to
morrow night when they meet Mon
tana State at Bozeman, Montana.
The finale will be only one of a
seven-game invasion that reached its
peak when the Cards grinned and
chortled their way through a 45-31
win over Long Island University De
cember 30, previously unbeaten in
43 consecutive contests.
Capacity Crowd
A capacity crowd of 17,623 in Mad
ison Square Garden went slightly
nutty as the unorthodox attack dis
played by Coach John Bunn's men
was a little too goofy for the L.I.U.
Blackbirds, spelling the end of the
fat years for (he outfit that last was
defeated by Duquesne in February,
1935. Hank Luisetti tanked 15 points
during the game, but his floorwork
was equally responsible for the roar
ing ovation given him by the New
Yorkers, completely won by the
magnificence of the slough-footed
wizard.
The opener of the tour was played
against Warrensburg Teachers at
Kansas City, Missouri, December 22,
Ambling Angelo leading the Cards to
a 51-31 win. Maintaining a tight de
fense that had the Pedagogues striv
ing all evening with nothing but long
shots, Stanford had little difficulty
making its offense click, Luisetti
scoring 21 points.
Temple Falls
December 28 Temple University
fell before the Indian attack, 45-38,
with Stork Stoefen wicketing 16,
Luisetti 14. The Tall Clowns played
before a capacity crowd in this game,
also, 9,000 fans bouncing out to see a
double-header.
After the L.I.U, tilt two days late r ,
Bunn took his squad to Buffalo, New
York, on New Year's Day, where
Howie Turner had his innings as the
team trounced Canisius, 39-29. Turn
er scored 12 points, twice as many as
each of three teammates, Luisetti,
Bob Zonne, and Sparky Robertson.
The next evening at Cleveland,
Ohio, the Cards steam-rollered the
Red Cats of Western Reserve into a
67-27 disgrace, even the third
stringers making the Pussies look
rather anaemic . Luisetti played only
the first half but did better than a
point a minute with 26 tallies.
Tour Nears End
The Ham line game last night, and a
contest with Montana State next
Wednesday wind up the barnstorm -
ing tour. John Bunn and his varsity
will return to the campus next Sat
urday morning.
It is not expected that the Staters
will greatly endanger the reputation
of the Cards, as they have made a
slow start this season.
Phi Delta Theta announces the
pledging of Bill Paulman, '38.
