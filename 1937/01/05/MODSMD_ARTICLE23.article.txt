## VANITY OF VANITIES

Even before I came to Stanford,
this school was practically littered
with saps, and colossal pieces of chi
canery were being committed in the
name of Stanford's undergraduate
honor and virtue.
♦ * ♦
In the winter of 1932-33 the Delta
Chi's were caught doing illegal rush
ing in a pretty harmless sort of a
way. The Interfraternity Board of
Control, representing 24 fraternities,
each one with its own special method
of dirty rushing, tossed Delta Chi to
the wolves and denied it pledging
privileges for a whole year.
In my freshman year, the Ex Com
mittee swallowed the whole hook and
bait that most American legislatures
have been nibbling at all these 100
years and tried to legislate the school
into the millennium by drafting a
new A.S.S..U. constitution. Under
that same fool proof document the
Ex Committee found legal license to
vote itself a little get-together at the
expense of the Associated Students—
an affair which less resembled a tea
party than it did a co-educational
brawl.
In my sophomre year, there was a
great, super-colossal, never-before
witnessed - by - human - eye Masque
Ball queen contest in which the
strongest contestant was an unheard
of creature who did not belong to a
sorority. Just before the ballotting
closed for good (or bad) and all, a
friend of said contestant skywrote
the would-be queen's name in the
air over the library. The sororities,
outraged by the introduction of such
stream-lined, tactics, banded together
and saw to it that a sorority woman
was, as usual, made queen.

The year of 1335-36 rolled around,
and the "Vowing Sophomores," then
juniors, tripped over U.C.L.A. and
lost by one point. The "Wax Wash
ington" drive commenced. A promi
nent chauvinist made the rounds of
the fraternities to whip the boys into
the proper frenzy. His spiel was
memorable. It ran something like
this:
"Well, fellas, we lost to U.C.LA.,
and the team feels pretty bad. They
don't think we're supporting them.
So you all gotta go out and yell Wax
Washington and put Halt the Huskies
stickers on your windshields and just
give the team your heart and soul,
because if you don't, they'll get dis
couraged, and Washington'll beat
them. ,
"And just think what it would be if
Washington beat us! Why, we'd lose
to Oregon, and if we lost to Oregon,
then we'd lose to Montana. And gee,
if Montana beat us, then so would
Cal, and then where would we be?
V/hy, we'd all feel miserable because

our football team lost, and since we
think more of our football team than
anything else, college wouldn't mean
very much to us then.
"Gosh, wouldn't that be terrible!
We'd go home and all the people
would say, 'you come from that
school Stanford that lost all the foot
ball games.' So, you see, if college is
going to mean anything to us any
more, we just GOTTA beat Wash
ington."

Well, as long as I was below the
rank of senior, I felt that it was im
proper for an underclassman to cavil
his superiors. But now that I have
practically earned my pension, let me
say that at last I feel like a sap at
home amongst many more saps. The
sucker population of this university
has not diminished. There are just as
many people rushing about in petty
foo-foos on deathless missions for
none-too-deathless notions. And
there are the same kind of smalt-alec
college journalists like myself, all
trying to be Westbrook Peglers and
Walter Winchells, raising our voices
to hear ourselves squeak.
So the realization that vanity is
vanity and all is vanity is not such a
disturbing thought after all. For if
all is vanity, then the biggest vanity
is thinking that we ourselves are
much less the fool than anybody else.
So I can say to the chump, "Move
over, brother."
