Like a giant's footprint in the soft earth, Stanford's amphitheater, most
elaborate of its type on the Pacific Coast, slowly takes form. These pictures
.show it essentially as it will he until spring quarter, when tons of trees and
shrubs will be planted.
In the background (above) is the seating space, where 15,000 parents
can sit a year from next June during graduation ceremonies. The space
will be terraced and planted iu lawn.
Movable chairs will be provided.
To the extreme left is a natural "island." left after graders had scraped
the stage (center foreground) clear.
On its crest arc trees, planted many years ago, accidentally in a perfect
location as a stage left proscenium.
Extreme right is a similar island, this one the foundation for trans
planted trees, moved from other parts of the campus as shown in the lower
panel.
Both islands will act as natural "light towers" for stage illumination
instead of the usual wood scaffolding.
Thirty-six thousand cubic yards of earth are needed, 6,000 still to come
from excavations for the Cubberley Education Building, construction of
which is to start in the spring. . —Crandall photos
