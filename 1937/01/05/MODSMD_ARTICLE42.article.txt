# New Year
## 
### 
The text for today is: Only slaves are re
warded tor their virtue.—Aristotle or some
body
With nothing better to say for itself than that
it is a calendric division of the earth's 365 Va -day
cycle, 1,937 of which we have had since the
birth of Jesus Christ, a new year comes along.
However, starting the new year, whether it
has any functional significance or not, is the
occasion of late for Rose Tournaments, football
bowls, and New Year's editorials, summing up
the number of stabbings and slayings, divorces,
and auto accidents of the previous year, and a
cheery note on industrial and scientific progress
(all due to individual initiative, the American
Way of Life, and high tariffs), and a prediction
that this year somebody will crack the atom
and such and such a film star will get married.
Not to be outdone by every editor of every
newspaper since the seventh sack of Troy, I am
delivering my New Year's cheer, but I am de
livering while the reedy soughings of the saxo
phone give proof through the night that Stan
ford students are celebrating the beginning of
the new year and the new quarter at the Theta
Sigma Phi charity ball and registration dance.
These students, therefore, set the tone for what
we may consider the Stanford student outlook
toward the new year.

***We're Off Again

These happy students clasped tightly to each
other are plodding about the waxed oak floor,
regimenting their steps to the erotic rhythms,
regimenting their appearances to conform to
the other happy students, regimenting their
ideas to conform to their partners. Are they
thinking about what a happy new year it is?
Are they having a good time? No. Then why
are they there? They are there because every
body else is there. That is reason enough.
But it isn't only the Reg dance. As we look
forward to a half year of the same sort of stuff,
we sadly realize that college dances are all alike,
whether we put up fancy drapes, whether we
wear tuxes or bizarre costumes, it always is the
committee that provides the entertainment. The
musical mercenaries have our fun for us, and
we idly watch the featured vocalist perform her
highly specialized craftsmanship.
Modern ballroom dancing with its crowded
floors has lost all the function of the Dance; it
has none of the grace, nor rhythm, nor move
ment of this valid art form. Only the stupid
plodding, the constant shoving, and the clinging
embrace remain.
When it isn't the dance, the student body
gives vicarious vent to its inhibited existence
at the movies and it lives for the moment the
lives of the hero or heroine with their suppos
edly limitless capacities for lusty and luxurious
living, never seeming to weary of Hollywood's
exotic and rococco stereotypes.
Same Old Stuff
As for sport, we must be given university
credit for playing. But it isn't exactly playing.
The idea behind it all is to beat the other guy.
We don't play for fun. Don't be funny. But
after we've beaten the other guy a while, we
get tired of that, and look around for a better
player. Finally we reach the point of marginal
yield per acre and the guy is unquestionably
better than we are. Then we are utterly miser
able. The inevitable result is that athletics is be
coming increasingly specialized. If we happen
to have a head start in golf, we keep on playing
golf, not daring to develop ourselves in another
sport because we will lose our advantage in the
original game.
Nov/ this wouldn't make much difference if
our regimented fun were only the counterpart
to a healthy attitude toward our work, but the
classic demand for harmony in work, play,
love, religion and what not remains undisturbed
in the textbooks. For our ah, gay youths not
only do not get fun out of their work or fun
out of their fun, but their lovemaking is domi
nated by the desire to secure an ornamental
husband or wife fitting to or above their eco
nomic status, and their religions, if they have
any, are based on fear of punishment, fear of
themselves, the dread of the unknown.
How He Does Ramble On
A healthy attitude toward work is the basis
for a happy life, but we do not have such an
attitude. Just as enjoying yourself is not one
of the seven deadly virtues (we are supposed
to live not to enjoy life but for some extrinsic
reason such as the Nordic Myth, because Jesus
wants me for a sunbeam, or because everybody
else is here), our studying is not carried on for
the pleasure of the work in itself, but because a
good grade or passing grade is the mark of
social success.
The drive is a negative one. It bases its ap
peal on the inferiority complex. Ostentation in

grades just as well as ostentation in fraternal
organizations, automobiles, and furniture, is to
salve the injured ego of a maladjusted indi
vidual. The inferiority complex should be es
sentially an adolescent complex; it is a tribute
to a sadistic civilization that our schools do not
liquidate it on our arrival at maturity.
Not finding an outlet for our energies in the
classroom, we turn to student "activities" where
the little pins and badges and the various im
portant offices succor our wounded egos. In
stead of enjoying the work as an opportunity
to develop our creative abilities, we do only
that which is necessary to secure the honors,
and then when the honors begin to pall, sigh
heavily, say how futile it all is, and feel resent
ful at the activity for not being a prettier one.

This year will be little different than the last
one for Stanford. There may be a war in Europe,
they may crack the atom, or the atom may crack
them, dictatorships may rise and fall, but life for
the Stanford student still will be life in the half
shell. Why? Because everyone has been in
terested in how college life affects the profes
sor, but nobody has been doing any lobbying
for the students. The professors have their cozy
departmental meetings and read their neat little
papers, and wonder vaguely sometimes why
students aren't as "enthusiastic" as they used
to be.
And Stanford remains the glorified Reg
Dance. The piper calls the tune. When the
music stops we stop. When the music starts v/e
start. We dance around and around and end up
in the same place. And the reason we are here
is because everyone else is here. That is reason
enough.
Happy New Year.

occasion of late for Rose Tournaments, football
bowls, and New Year's editorials, summing up
the number of stabbings and slayings, divorces,
and auto accidents of the previous year, and a
cheery note on industrial and scientific progress
(all due to individual initiative, the American
Way of Life, and high tariffs), and a prediction
that this year somebody will crack the atom
and such and such a film star will get married.
Not to be outdone by every editor of every
newspaper since the seventh sack of Troy, I am
delivering my New Year's cheer, but I am de
livering while the reedy soughings of the saxo
phone give proof through the night that Stan
ford students are celebrating the beginning of
the new year and the new quarter at the Theta
Sigma Phi charity ball and registration dance.
These students, therefore, set the tone for what
we may consider the Stanford student outlook
toward the new year.

***We're Off Again

These happy students clasped tightly to each
other are plodding about the waxed oak floor,
regimenting their steps to the erotic rhythms,
regimenting their appearances to conform to
the other happy students, regimenting their
ideas to conform to their partners. Are they
thinking about what a happy new year it is?
Are they having a good time? No. Then why
are they there? They are there because every
body else is there. That is reason enough.
But it isn't only the Reg dance. As we look
forward to a half year of the same sort of stuff,
we sadly realize that college dances are all alike,
whether we put up fancy drapes, whether we
wear tuxes or bizarre costumes, it always is the
committee that provides the entertainment. The
musical mercenaries have our fun for us, and
we idly watch the featured vocalist perform her
highly specialized craftsmanship.
Modern ballroom dancing with its crowded
floors has lost all the function of the Dance; it
has none of the grace, nor rhythm, nor move
ment of this valid art form. Only the stupid
plodding, the constant shoving, and the clinging
embrace remain.
When it isn't the dance, the student body
gives vicarious vent to its inhibited existence
at the movies and it lives for the moment the
lives of the hero or heroine with their suppos
edly limitless capacities for lusty and luxurious
living, never seeming to weary of Hollywood's
exotic and rococco stereotypes.
Same Old Stuff
As for sport, we must be given university
credit for playing. But it isn't exactly playing.
The idea behind it all is to beat the other guy.
We don't play for fun. Don't be funny. But
after we've beaten the other guy a while, we
get tired of that, and look around for a better
player. Finally we reach the point of marginal
yield per acre and the guy is unquestionably
better than we are. Then we are utterly miser
able. The inevitable result is that athletics is be
coming increasingly specialized. If we happen
to have a head start in golf, we keep on playing
golf, not daring to develop ourselves in another
sport because we will lose our advantage in the
original game.
Nov/ this wouldn't make much difference if
our regimented fun were only the counterpart
to a healthy attitude toward our work, but the
classic demand for harmony in work, play,
love, religion and what not remains undisturbed
in the textbooks. For our ah, gay youths not
only do not get fun out of their work or fun
out of their fun, but their lovemaking is domi
nated by the desire to secure an ornamental
husband or wife fitting to or above their eco
nomic status, and their religions, if they have
any, are based on fear of punishment, fear of
themselves, the dread of the unknown.
How He Does Ramble On
A healthy attitude toward work is the basis
for a happy life, but we do not have such an
attitude. Just as enjoying yourself is not one
of the seven deadly virtues (we are supposed
to live not to enjoy life but for some extrinsic
reason such as the Nordic Myth, because Jesus
wants me for a sunbeam, or because everybody
else is here), our studying is not carried on for
the pleasure of the work in itself, but because a
good grade or passing grade is the mark of
social success.
The drive is a negative one. It bases its ap
peal on the inferiority complex. Ostentation in

grades just as well as ostentation in fraternal
organizations, automobiles, and furniture, is to
salve the injured ego of a maladjusted indi
vidual. The inferiority complex should be es
sentially an adolescent complex; it is a tribute
to a sadistic civilization that our schools do not
liquidate it on our arrival at maturity.
Not finding an outlet for our energies in the
classroom, we turn to student "activities" where
the little pins and badges and the various im
portant offices succor our wounded egos. In
stead of enjoying the work as an opportunity
to develop our creative abilities, we do only
that which is necessary to secure the honors,
and then when the honors begin to pall, sigh
heavily, say how futile it all is, and feel resent
ful at the activity for not being a prettier one.

This year will be little different than the last
one for Stanford. There may be a war in Europe,
they may crack the atom, or the atom may crack
them, dictatorships may rise and fall, but life for
the Stanford student still will be life in the half
shell. Why? Because everyone has been in
terested in how college life affects the profes
sor, but nobody has been doing any lobbying
for the students. The professors have their cozy
departmental meetings and read their neat little
papers, and wonder vaguely sometimes why
students aren't as "enthusiastic" as they used
to be.
And Stanford remains the glorified Reg
Dance. The piper calls the tune. When the
music stops we stop. When the music starts v/e
start. We dance around and around and end up
in the same place. And the reason we are here
is because everyone else is here. That is reason
enough.
Happy New Year.
The text for today is: Only slaves are re
warded tor their virtue.—Aristotle or some

With nothing better to say for itself than that
it is a calendric division of the earth's 365 Va -day
cycle, 1,937 of which we have had since the
birth of Jesus Christ, a new year comes along.

and such and such a film star will get married.
Not to be outdone by every editor of every
newspaper since the seventh sack of Troy, I am
delivering my New Year's cheer, but I am de
livering while the reedy soughings of the saxo
phone give proof through the night that Stan
ford students are celebrating the beginning of
the new year and the new quarter at the Theta
Sigma Phi charity ball and registration dance.
These students, therefore, set the tone for what
we may consider the Stanford student outlook
toward the new year.

***We're Off Again

These happy students clasped tightly to each
other are plodding about the waxed oak floor,
regimenting their steps to the erotic rhythms,
regimenting their appearances to conform to
the other happy students, regimenting their
ideas to conform to their partners. Are they
thinking about what a happy new year it is?
Are they having a good time? No. Then why
are they there? They are there because every
body else is there. That is reason enough.
But it isn't only the Reg dance. As we look
forward to a half year of the same sort of stuff,
we sadly realize that college dances are all alike,
whether we put up fancy drapes, whether we
wear tuxes or bizarre costumes, it always is the
committee that provides the entertainment. The
musical mercenaries have our fun for us, and
we idly watch the featured vocalist perform her
highly specialized craftsmanship.
Modern ballroom dancing with its crowded
floors has lost all the function of the Dance; it
has none of the grace, nor rhythm, nor move
ment of this valid art form. Only the stupid
plodding, the constant shoving, and the clinging
embrace remain.
When it isn't the dance, the student body
gives vicarious vent to its inhibited existence
at the movies and it lives for the moment the
lives of the hero or heroine with their suppos
edly limitless capacities for lusty and luxurious
living, never seeming to weary of Hollywood's
exotic and rococco stereotypes.
Same Old Stuff
As for sport, we must be given university
credit for playing. But it isn't exactly playing.
The idea behind it all is to beat the other guy.
We don't play for fun. Don't be funny. But
after we've beaten the other guy a while, we
get tired of that, and look around for a better
player. Finally we reach the point of marginal
yield per acre and the guy is unquestionably
better than we are. Then we are utterly miser
able. The inevitable result is that athletics is be
coming increasingly specialized. If we happen
to have a head start in golf, we keep on playing
golf, not daring to develop ourselves in another
sport because we will lose our advantage in the
original game.
Nov/ this wouldn't make much difference if
our regimented fun were only the counterpart
to a healthy attitude toward our work, but the
classic demand for harmony in work, play,
love, religion and what not remains undisturbed
in the textbooks. For our ah, gay youths not
only do not get fun out of their work or fun
out of their fun, but their lovemaking is domi
nated by the desire to secure an ornamental
husband or wife fitting to or above their eco
nomic status, and their religions, if they have
any, are based on fear of punishment, fear of
themselves, the dread of the unknown.
How He Does Ramble On
A healthy attitude toward work is the basis
for a happy life, but we do not have such an
attitude. Just as enjoying yourself is not one
of the seven deadly virtues (we are supposed
to live not to enjoy life but for some extrinsic
reason such as the Nordic Myth, because Jesus
wants me for a sunbeam, or because everybody
else is here), our studying is not carried on for
the pleasure of the work in itself, but because a
good grade or passing grade is the mark of
social success.
The drive is a negative one. It bases its ap
peal on the inferiority complex. Ostentation in

grades just as well as ostentation in fraternal
organizations, automobiles, and furniture, is to
salve the injured ego of a maladjusted indi
vidual. The inferiority complex should be es
sentially an adolescent complex; it is a tribute
to a sadistic civilization that our schools do not
liquidate it on our arrival at maturity.
Not finding an outlet for our energies in the
classroom, we turn to student "activities" where
the little pins and badges and the various im
portant offices succor our wounded egos. In
stead of enjoying the work as an opportunity
to develop our creative abilities, we do only
that which is necessary to secure the honors,
and then when the honors begin to pall, sigh
heavily, say how futile it all is, and feel resent
ful at the activity for not being a prettier one.

This year will be little different than the last
one for Stanford. There may be a war in Europe,
they may crack the atom, or the atom may crack
them, dictatorships may rise and fall, but life for
the Stanford student still will be life in the half
shell. Why? Because everyone has been in
terested in how college life affects the profes
sor, but nobody has been doing any lobbying
for the students. The professors have their cozy
departmental meetings and read their neat little
papers, and wonder vaguely sometimes why
students aren't as "enthusiastic" as they used
to be.
And Stanford remains the glorified Reg
Dance. The piper calls the tune. When the
music stops we stop. When the music starts v/e
start. We dance around and around and end up
in the same place. And the reason we are here
is because everyone else is here. That is reason
enough.
Happy New Year.
The text for today is: Only slaves are re
warded tor their virtue.—Aristotle or some
body
With nothing better to say for itself than that
it is a calendric division of the earth's 365 Va -day
cycle, 1,937 of which we have had since the
birth of Jesus Christ, a new year comes along.
However, starting the new year, whether it
has any functional significance or not, is the
occasion of late for Rose Tournaments, football
bowls, and New Year's editorials, summing up
the number of stabbings and slayings, divorces,
and auto accidents of the previous year, and a
cheery note on industrial and scientific progress
(all due to individual initiative, the American
Way of Life, and high tariffs), and a prediction
that this year somebody will crack the atom
and such and such a film star will get married.
Not to be outdone by every editor of every
