## BONDED PROFESSORS 
### 
Guaranteed quality is something the American pub
lic demands and gets in hamburgers, toothbrushes, au
tomobiles, blondes and hamburgers.
Manufacturers can make such a guarantee because
industry, animal husbandry and hamburgers are stand
ardized. But educators, because they have concealed
their standardization, are able to deliver goods of any
quality—usually standardized below standard.
# * * #
So we have a plan—to protect you from mental
trichinosis as the bonding of hamburgers protects you
from the dubious milieu of the pig.
The plan is, logically, bonding professors. Before a
lecturer can expose an unsuspecting class to auditory
toxins, the professor must first listen to his own jokes
via a phonograph record. If he takes more than three
pages of notes or laughs more than a tubercular titter,
lecture is automatically cancelled. He gets a flunk,
and must revise his lecture until he can slouch through
it, according to a method of slouching students shall
recommend.
* $ * *
When presenting his lecture, the professor must
follow the approved version to the letter. If he varies
by including an unapproved joke, he is penalized by
being forced to listen to the joke repeated 500 times in
his own voice.
A lecture is not approved, it is bonded. And if the
professor can deliver three lectures consecutively with
out varying his bonded version, he becomes automatic
ally a Bonded Professor and as a reward is exempt
from attacks by the Liberty League, the D.A.R., or
John Francis Neylan.
* * * *
If he has an absolutely clean record in two courses,
he gets his picture on the cover of Time and is known
as Bonded Professor Magna Cum Loudey. If he butches
only once, he is known as Bonded Professor Magna
Cum Softey, and gets his picture in the directory of
courses on the page where his bonded lectures are
numbered and described.
Naturally, the students are bonded, too. If they
laugh at a joke they are thrown out of school, and if
they take more than six pages of notes they are black
listed as unfair to the Student Union and refused per
mission to eat dinner in the Union Cellar—or forced to
eat there. The point needs considering.
