# OUR HASHER

Just because everyone else has nominated a man of
the year, that is no reason why Stanford can't have
one of its own, and why Our Hasher can't nominate
him. After thumbing through the pages of history, and
considering Brain Riddell, Frank Fullenwider, Burrel
Leonard, Chuck Fontius and his pipe, Stevie N. Aten,
David Windsor, Ben Dey. William Gunther, and Ned,
the cross-eyed janitor. Our Hasher's long-considered
choice inevitably swings around to Chef Wong, 569
Wong's Kitch, Stanford, famed for his ability to main
tain a five-day endurance run of sliced pineapple for
dessert.
Registration Day found the usual mob violence in
the Ad Building. Caught in one of the flying wedges
of fleeing wenches, one unfortunate individual lost his
check book, which was picked up and turned into the
information desk. There the clerks in the special Reg
Day crew took the lost article, and discovered that they
knew the owner. The finder then overheard them dis
cussing the situation.
"Do ya know the guy?"
"Yeh."
"Are ya gonna give it back to him?"
'That isn't the point."
"What dya mean, it isn't the point."
"I took a look at his bank balance. I'm gonna try to
date him." '
Fences were torn up, trees were uprooted, homes
were demolished all up and down the highway to Los i
Angeles yesterday, when herds of terrified cattle stam
peded. The cattle were stampeded, it is said, by two El ;
Toros rturning to the campus to register. One of them i
was positively identified as a noted guard on the team
of the Vowing Sophs. The stampeding was caused by
the firing off of cap pistols, according to reports.
