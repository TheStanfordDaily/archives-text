THANK GOODNESS New Year's
Eve comes only once a year! (And
you can interpret that one any way
you wishâ€”you'll probably be right!)
NETWORK NOTES: If you find it
slightly confusing trying to get your
favorite radio programs these days,
it's because of that realignment of
chain stations that took place three
days before 1936 bowed out of the
picture. CBS programs are now on
KSFO (560 kc) and KFRC is San
Francisco outlet for the Mutual
Broadcasting System, hitherto heard
only in the East.
IF YOU'RE FUSSY, better tone on
Columbia broadcasts can be got from
KNX (1050 kc) or KSL (1130 kc)
during the evening hours when those
stations can be heard.
STANFORDMAN GORDY HECHE
and his orchestra get their first big
break tonight when 'they replace
Bernie Cummins in the Palace Rose
Room Bowl for a one-time shot. This
is the first time a Stanford band has
ever played a major San Francisco
night spot. Hoche, who has been
playing for Palo Alto's community
dances, promises a troupe of campus
stars and campus song hits to liven

up the evening, and his music goes [
network on the 10 p.m. spot over
KGO.
SCRIBBLED ON THE CUFF: i
Anybody who thinks Gus Arnheim
isn't right back in there with the best |
of 'em should have heard his terrific j
bit for one of the networks on New I
Year's Eve. . . . Eddie Fitzpatrick, i
Frantic maestro, is engaged to Lor- j
raine Santschi, the dancer . . . I 1
like Art Kasscl's utterly charming, j
whimsical music. (Hear him on j
KOA Fridays at 10:15 or Saturdays
at 9:30).
