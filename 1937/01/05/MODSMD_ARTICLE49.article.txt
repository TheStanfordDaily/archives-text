# Campus Roads Near Completion
## 
### 
More road work was done on the
Stanford campus during 1936 than in
any previous year, according to Mr.!
James W. McDonnell, superintend- j
ent of buildings and grounds. More
than 8000 feet of road was rebuilt j
during the vacation period alone.
The chief project completed while
the campus was depopulated was the
repairing of a great deal of broken
road surrounding the post office. Mr. i
McDonnell, believes that most of the
roads on the Farm are now in good i
condition, that the -new traffic lanes j
arc the most practical possible.
One of the outstanding new fea- j
tures of 1937 automobiles is hypoid
gear axles.
