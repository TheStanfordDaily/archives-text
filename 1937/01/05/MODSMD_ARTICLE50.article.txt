### 
Boy Meets Ciirl at the Geary The
ater. A satire on the film industry
and Hollywood that turns out to be
the best comedy that San Francisco
has enjoyed for several seasons, and
that includes "Three Men on a
Horse." Its title is from the univer
sal formula of scenario writers —
"Boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy
wins girl."
Bobby Law and J. C. Benson are
the the two mad scenario writers who
capitalize on the baby born to a
light-headed waitress in their boss's
office, skyrocket it to fame by team
ing it with Larry Toms, rugged west
ern hero.
The characters were undoubtedly
inspired by Ben Hecht and Charles
Mac Arthur, a scenario-writing team
whose antics upset Hollywood for
two years. "Write me a roundelay,
one in three verses with a symphonic
undercurrent," Benson, impersonat
ing his producer-boss, orders his song
writers. They write it, too, to the
bewilderment of "C.F.," the boss.
Although this is not the original
New York cast, it would be hard to
find anyone as satisfying as Betty
Field is in the role of Susie, uncon
scious waitress-mother of "Happy,"
who "always wanted to go to high
school" — "where all the girls are
crazy about Robert Taylor."
Funniest scene, perhaps, is in Act
IT, "At a Neighborhood Theater,"
when the stage becomes a moving
picture screen, teasers announce the
appearance of "Happy" in a new
super-super thriller, accompanied
with thunderous excerpts from the
William Tell Overture.
It is all like that, farcical, never
subtly funny. Hollywood, I suspect,
has not yet recovered.
