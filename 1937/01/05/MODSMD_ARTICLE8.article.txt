# No Slackening in Rules, Warns Men's Board
## 
### 
Men's rushing starts on the last
lap this week with pledging set for
January 15. Concerning the rushing
rules generally, Bob Hoover, presi
dent of Interfraternity Council, said:
"As rushing draws to a close it is
increasingly important to maintain
the enforcement of the rules. They
are still in effect and will remain so
until formal pledging. Freshmen
should be warned that if reported
as taking part in illegal rushing, they
will be punished by loss of pledging
with no less severity than a house
which violates the rules."
Rushing continues this Friday and
Saturday with the usual plan to be
followed. Lunch Friday from 11:30
to 2 p.m.; afternoon period from 2 to
5 o'clock; evening from 6 o'clock to
midnight. The lunch and afternoon
dates are allowed only on Saturday.
The last rushing period comes

of next week, with formal pledging
taking place Friday afternoon, Jan
uary 15. Rushing during this final
period is limited to a lunch and din
ner date each from 11:30 to 2
p.m. and 5:30 to 8 p.m. There is
no afternoon rushing on these dates.
From 8 o'clock Thursday evening
until pledging on Friday there is
an absolute silent period. No con
tact of any kind may take place be
tween fraternity men and frosh. This
includes prohibition of the informal
