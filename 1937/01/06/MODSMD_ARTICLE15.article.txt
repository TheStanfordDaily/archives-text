# It's 'Prune Bowl' Now For San Jose
## 
### 
Pasadena has its Rose Bowl, New
Orleans its Sugar Bowl, Miami its
Orange Bowl, and now San Jose is
planning a Prune Bowl.
San Jose city council took the first
steps this week toward the enlarge
ment of the Spartan stadium on the
San Jose State College athletic field.
This is done with the prospect of
having football contests between
teams of major rank; held annually
in the Prune Bowl.
Seating 9,600 now, engineers say
it could easily be enlarged to hold
20,000. Pessimists pointed out, how
ever, that the structure is seldom
filled even for the college's best
games, and that state regulations
forbid the management from renting
it to outside teams.
