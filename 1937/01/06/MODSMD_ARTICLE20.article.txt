## Action Follows Student's Admission of Guilt 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Action taken by Men's Council on
the freshman who blackjacked a Cal
guard in the mass attempt of over 60
Encina men to paint the Big "C" red
during the wave of Big Game en
thusiasm, resulted in the student's
dismissal from Stanford for winter
quarter.
Ex Committee appointed Men's
Council to look into the affair after
Hoyt O. Frost, Berkeley sophomore,
was sent to the hospital with concus
sion of the brain as a result of the
blow. When confronted with the facts
the Stanford freshman admitted hav
ing hit the Cal man in a moment of
too-great enthusiasm, and expressed
his shame and regret.
Men Not Warned
Roy Anderson, chairman of Men's
Council, stated that the too-patri
otic freshman was not more severely
disciplined because he was influenced
by the general enthusiasm. Anderson
also said that he felt that the men had
not been adequately warned against
getting too wrought up.
The blackjacking incident served
to raise Big Game enthusiasm to un
precedented heights, and nearly re
sulted in cancellation of the tradi
tional battle. Leonard Charvet, Cal
student body president, criticized
the Stanford men's action, but dis
couraged the abortive attempts of
enraged Berkeley students to kidnap
Dr. Wilbur and stage an aerial attack
on the bonfire.
Raids May Be Banned
Anderson said that the matter of
pre-Big Game activities will be dis
cussed with freshmen during pre
registration period next fall. An En
cina smoker may bo held to discour
age men from descending on Cal
prior to the Game.
"It seems inevitable that somebody
will get hurt if the men go over
there," Anderson stated, "and the
best way to protect Stanford's repu
tation is to keep them here."
