# Change Proposed In Election Date By Ex Committee
## A.S.S.U. Officers May Be Chosen in February To Give Tyros Experience 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
In an effort to solve the "green
horn" problem in Stanford politics—
students taking office fall quarter
with no experience and little knowl
edge of their duties—Ex Committee
will at tys meeting next week consid
er the proposal to change the prin
cipal A.S.S.U. elections from May to
February with the administration
shift the beginning of spring quarter.
Barbara Kimball, Women's Con
ference president, suggested the
move to Ex Committee at its last
meeting before Christmas. President
Reynolds appointed Roy Anderson,
Chick Franich, Ruth Goodan, and
Miss Kimball to consider the matter
before next Tuesday.
Greenhorns To Learn
Principal argument in the new sys
tem's favor: it gives the new officers
a chance to learn their jobs before
going into office. With induction
spring quarter instead of fall, the old
officers would still be in school in
case their help was needed.
As it is, the student body president,
new administrative officers, and Ex
Committee members take office in
September with little or no knowl
edge of the problems they will face.
Incumbents Sacrifice Terms
If the proposal is passed by Ex
Committee, and subsequently by the
student body, it will mean that the
present A.S.S.U. officers will sacri
fice one-third of their terms (except
Sophomore Woman Jackie Brown
and Junior Man Chick Franich,
whose terms end in February any
way).
When the new election system was
suggested in December, Ex Commit
tee seemed to agree that if a change
were warranted "somebody would
have to sacrifice and it might as well
be us."
Reynolds Elected
At the same end-quarter meeting,
Ex Committee elected Jim Reynolds
a member of the Bookstore board of
directors. The bookstore, a corpora
tion, had asked for another student
director.
Larry Rouble raised the issue that
the A.S.S.U. should have more con
trol of athletic affairs. Roy Thomp
son wanted to make wrestling a
minor sport. Both questions will
come up again this quarter.
Date granted: spring quarter Reg
