"BANG, BANG. YOU'RE DEAD"
According to a recent report, the
F. W. Woolworth Co. has decided to
stop selling toy pistols in their five
and-dime stores.
I think there was some sort of an
implication along with the report
that the Woolworth stores, viewing
the late "crime wave," had grown
conscience-stricken, decided possibly
that they 'were partly responsible for
toddling infants learning about guns
from handling toy pistols and grow
ing up to be baby bandits trying to
emulate John Dillinger.
Then again, the move may have
been brought about by babies saving
up their pennies, buying cap pistols,
then dropping them on the sidewalk
and demanding their money back
under the laws of infancy (see Busi
ness Law I, Rathbun), although this
last is highly improbable, I guess.

At any rate, Countess Barbara
Hutton Mdvani Haugwitz - Revent
low's commercial enterprises have
withdrawn from a highly profitable
field that has grown almost to the
proportions of a major industry. As
recent as my own babyhood the lat
est word in imitation shooting-irons
was either a repeater cap pistol
which resembled a real pistol in the
same general way that a hippopota.-
mus resembles a horse or else a ma
chine-gun affair which fired wooden
pellets fed to it on a belt. But the
repeater pistols never repeated when
I wanted to scare the girls down the
street and the machine gun belt
jammed like a real one but the gun
itself didn't roar like a real one.
But time, as somebody said,
lurches on, and the toy shops these
days display practically every lethal
instrument ever used by Dick Tracy
or Flash Gordon. The sub-machine
guns blaze away with real fire and
smoke and the magazines on the cap
pistols revolve as the trigger is
pulled. And I am told that even the
Mexican kids in the Los Angeles
slums pull their hats down over their
eyes and riddle their pals at close
range with toy sawed-off shotguns,
thus proving that the American glor
ification of lawlessness is corrupting
the children of other nations as well
as our own.
* * *
Now I can see why the Woolworth
stores might have thought their mer
chandise was possibly inciting to
crime, and they are to be commended
for their good intentions. But I think
they have been misled by the current
wave of thought, which holds that the
movies and the funny papers are ed
ucating our children to be arch
fiends and public enemies with their
exploits recorded gloriously on the
front pages.
Even granting that Dick Tracy is a
gory symbol of the treat-'em-rough
school of combating crime, and that
the movie gangsters do live very soft
and love very lovely ladies, I cannot
see how it can positively be shown
that such things are leading our

youth to crime. For one thing, the
Tom Swift books have been in circu
lation for years, and there is no sign
yet that American youth is one tre
mendous gang of boy inventors, all
constructing giant searchlights and
electric cannon. It has also been
claimed that sinful movies have
turned America into a nation of sin
ners, but I disbelieve this as well be
cause instruction in real sin is never
shown on the screen and a desultory
perusal of history shows that evil
ways were always very popular.
♦ * #
The children's craze for toy guns
is not a cause of crime, but just a
surface indication that crime looks
desirable to a lot of our juvenile
population. And what a fine day it
would be if the five-and-ten stores
kept on selling toy pistols and amass
ing profits, but instead of turning
over the money to Barbara Hutton,
etc., who has probably worked less
in her life than one of her Woolworth
clerks, distribute the money to the
sweating slaves who really earn it.
It is poverty and racial oppression
which breeds the "what-the-hell"
attitude about earning a living legi
mately and makes this country still
pretty much the place where, as Ber
nard Shaw remarked about Eng
land, a thief is one who steals from
the rich and a gentleman is one who
robs from the poor.

The children's craze for toy guns

desirable to a lot of our juvenile
population. And what a fine day it
would be if the five-and-ten stores
kept on selling toy pistols and amass

over the money to Barbara Hutton,
etc., who has probably worked less
in her life than one of her Woolworth
clerks, distribute the money to the
sweating slaves who really earn it.
It is poverty and racial oppression
which breeds the "what-the-hell"

"BANG, BANG. YOU'RE DEAD"
According to a recent report, the
F. W. Woolworth Co. has decided to
stop selling toy pistols in their five
and-dime stores.
I think there was some sort of an
implication along with the report
that the Woolworth stores, viewing
the late "crime wave," had grown
conscience-stricken, decided possibly
that they 'were partly responsible for
toddling infants learning about guns
from handling toy pistols and grow
ing up to be baby bandits trying to
emulate John Dillinger.
Then again, the move may have
been brought about by babies saving
up their pennies, buying cap pistols,
then dropping them on the sidewalk
and demanding their money back
under the laws of infancy (see Busi
ness Law I, Rathbun), although this
last is highly improbable, I guess.

At any rate, Countess Barbara
Hutton Mdvani Haugwitz - Revent
low's commercial enterprises have
withdrawn from a highly profitable
field that has grown almost to the
proportions of a major industry. As
recent as my own babyhood the lat
est word in imitation shooting-irons
was either a repeater cap pistol
which resembled a real pistol in the
same general way that a hippopota.-
mus resembles a horse or else a ma
chine-gun affair which fired wooden
pellets fed to it on a belt. But the
repeater pistols never repeated when
I wanted to scare the girls down the
street and the machine gun belt
jammed like a real one but the gun
itself didn't roar like a real one.
But time, as somebody said,
lurches on, and the toy shops these
days display practically every lethal
instrument ever used by Dick Tracy
or Flash Gordon. The sub-machine
guns blaze away with real fire and
smoke and the magazines on the cap
pistols revolve as the trigger is
pulled. And I am told that even the
Mexican kids in the Los Angeles
slums pull their hats down over their
eyes and riddle their pals at close
range with toy sawed-off shotguns,
thus proving that the American glor
ification of lawlessness is corrupting
the children of other nations as well
as our own.
* * *
Now I can see why the Woolworth
stores might have thought their mer
chandise was possibly inciting to
crime, and they are to be commended
for their good intentions. But I think
they have been misled by the current
wave of thought, which holds that the
movies and the funny papers are ed
ucating our children to be arch
fiends and public enemies with their
