# Police Await Boy's Release
## Law Ready To Launch Hunt for Kidnaper 
### 
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 5 (U.R).—
Federal and local law enforcement
agencies poised today for instant
action to capture the kidnaper of
Charles Mattson as soon as the lad
is released.
While ready to launch a giant
man hunt, officers are awaiting the
actual release of the boy before
trying to trap the man or men who
abducted the boy from his home nine
days ago.
Accomplice Feared
Even though the kidnaper is lo
cated, he will not be seized for fear
an accomplice holding the boy at
some hideout may kill him and flee,
they said.
The kidnaper is probably hiding
some distance from Tacoma and may
not answer the parents' latest ap
peal for another contact until to
morrow, Paul Sceva, mentioned as
a possible intermediary for the fam
ily in ransom negotiations, said.
Word Expected
Word from the kidnaper or the
10-ycar-old boy is hoped for hourly,
just as it has been since the child was
abducted nine days ago, Mr. Sceva
said.
Dr. Mattson had $28,000 which he
had paid or was about to pay to the
man who a week ago last Sunday
night broke into his home overlook
ing Puget Sound and stole his son,
Charles.
"The kidnaper may be quite a way
from here and may not see the ad
vertisement until today," Mr. Sceva
said. "Then he may .not be able to
answer until tomorrow. We are still
hoping, but have heard nothing."
