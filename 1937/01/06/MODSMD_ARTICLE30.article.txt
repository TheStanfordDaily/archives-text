# Claim Britain Favors Rebels
## Tacit Assent Given To Italian Aid in Spain 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 5 (U.R). — Belief
spread in diplomatic quarters today
that Great Britain, anxious to dispel
the threat of a European war,
wanted a Rebel victory lather than
a Loyalist triumph in the Spanish
civil war. Despite protests over
Rebel attacks on two British ships,
it was said Britain tacitly assented
to Italian military intervention and
helped to maintain a smoke-screen
of non-intervention efforts only to
conceal efforts of Fascist nations to
aid the Rebels.
This belief was strengthened by
information that at the moment the
Italian-British Mediterranean agree
ment wa* signed Saturday, Britain
knew Italy had sent 10,500 men to
Spain within a we«k to join the
Rebels.
Meanwhile, the admiralty got word
from the Rebels that Rebel war
ships would keep hands ofF British
vessels in the Strait of Gibraltar.
Labor and Liberal quarters openly
charged the government was en
couraging Italian intervention. They
suspected the government might
now be prepared even to assist the
Rebels indirectly.
