## THE 						EASTERN HUP —HIGH SCHOOL STUFF 
### 
Writing this Slants today may turn
out to be more or less of a finger ex
ercise (never a mental one) because
with the New Year hay come new
blood in the ad staff and it may have
to give way to three columns full
length of Chesterfield or Phelps-
Terkel.
But a few minor things should be
said, anyway. A lot of people have
been asking why Coach John Bunn
scheduled a bunch of small time col
leges for competition on the first big
eastern tour during which he stood a
good chance to clean up.
The answer is that he didn't—it is
just as hard to predict how good a
basketball team is going to be a year
hence as it is to predict American
League baseball, and Temple, Long
Island ,and Hamline were all ex
tremely hot last season.
The reason you haven't heard of
them is because the nation's colleges
are ranked on newspaper fronts as a
direct function of the importance of
their football team, and strangely
hoop and grid teams of the same in
stitution do not fluctuate together.
Long Island, for instance, is the
Minnesota of basketball. This college
of 1300 students in Brooklyn really
takes the game seriously, and last
year won two straight from Notre
Dame, which had just previously
won the most important collegiate
title in the country — the N.C.AA.
championship.
Stanford, before a capacity house
of 17,623 persons in Madison Square
Garden, probably the largest crowd
ever to watch a Cardinal hoop team,
beat Long Island University 45-31,
ending a 43-game winning streak for
the easterners that is said to be the
longest one on record in the short
history of the indoor sport.
The reason the Redshirts were
laughing about it, as the reports all
note, is that their victory there eased
much of the tension of the trip—John
Bunn had promised them that if they
beat Long Island, they could go East
again next year, and 8 out of 12 of
the boys that were taken will return
next year.
