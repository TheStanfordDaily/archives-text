# AND RIGHT IN OUR BACK YARD

Meanwhile, the rest of the confer
ence is getting fast under way—the
Trojans have completed a barn
storming tour in Texas, and U.C.L.A.
is back from a similar one in the
Rocky Mountain states.
Ohio State has come out to split
two close ones with Cal, and beat
both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. Washing
ton, with a veteran team, again looks
the power of the Northern Division,
but may be inferior to the competi
tion down here, as they beat U.C.LA.
52-51. and dropped (| U.S.C. 45-31.
But pre-season stuff doesn't mean
a thing, because Washington licked
us twice during the Christmas holi
days last year.
I suppose you're all worked up
about the victory march through the
East. Starved for victory, you all

lorded it over your conference
friends about what a great basketball
season we're going to have.
Well, it looks as if we may win a
few. But we'll lose some, too —the
psychology is against any Stanford
team with a winning streak, and they
never seem to hit a peak without a
little bit of adversity. The confer
ence race'll be close, and the winner
will lose at least two games, says
John Bunn.
The team's desire, more than the
championship, is to win four straight
from California. Stanford, you re
member, has never won in Berkeley,
and they want two this year over
there.
One of these may automatically be
taken away from them, as A1 Masters
and Ken Priestly, ever conscious of
the publicity, good will, and fiscal
angles, are seriously considering
holding two of the California series
in the Civic Auditorium, San Fran
cisco. —Klauber
