# Prospects for Coming Track Season Encourage Templeton
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Things appear to be looking up for
Track Mentor Dink Templeton and
his harriers.
Time was, way back in 1936, when
it was extremely doubtful whether
Coach Dink and his first lieutenant,
Bill Ellington, would be able to so
much as field a presentable squad,
much less go to town with it.
But, 'tis said, time heals all wounds,
and she has done a px-etty good job
since last fall for Dink.
Dates To Be Announced
The schedules, varsity and fresh
man, have not been drawn up as yet,
but. according to Coach Ellington,
will be completely filled out by the
last of this week. Only definite dates
so far arranged for are the California
varsity meet on April 24 at Berkeley,
and the Pacific Coast Conference get
together at Los Angeles during May
28-29. This engagement, as it did last
year, conicts with the eastern
1.C.4-A. meet.
However tough the schedules may
be, the Stanford squad will be a lot
more capable of handling its respec
tive opponents than they would
have been last fall.
Biggest apple of Coach Templeton's
knowing eye at present is diminutive
Tom Montgomery, who has San Ma
teo Junior College stickers on his
baggage. He's only 6 feet, 8 inches
short, and consistently breaks scales
that don't go beyond 250 pounds, and
throws shots and discuses and things.
He's mighty inexperienced, but,

nonetheless, has already shoved the
16-pound weight 47 feet into space, I
and, in addition, has heaved the dis
cus 135 feet from a standing position.
Weightmcn Look Good
If all goes well, he should make j
Stanford's weight men the strongest I
on the coast, as Jim Reynolds and j
Pete Zagar, specializing in shot and }
discus, respectively, are already re
garded as championship material.
Bill McCurdy, who has heretofore ■
confined his efforts mainly to the j
half-mile event, will very likely do j
double duty this spring, adding the |
mile run to his already hefty burden. |
McCurdy was elccted captain of the
1937 squad at the close of last quar- i
ter.
Rusty March, letterman half-miler j
from the 1935 varsity, has returned to j
school to strengthen the distance
corps.
Jack Weierhauser, who accom- j
plished big things in the 440 last !
year, will be returning, as will Bob i
Alexander, miler, and Ed Burrows, j
two-miler whose season may be
hampered by an ankle that was j
broken last fall.
Iliscrinan Sprints
Stan Hiserman, from San Mateo ;
J.C., is expected to capably take care ,
of the sprints, together with the vet- I
eran Jimmy Kneubuhl.
Big guns on the frosh squad will
probably be little Ray Brown, 23- 1
foot broad jumper from Riverside,'
and Tom O'Leary, half-miler.

have been last fall.
Biggest apple of Coach Templeton's
knowing eye at present is diminutive
Tom Montgomery, who has San Ma
teo Junior College stickers on his
baggage. He's only 6 feet, 8 inches
short, and consistently breaks scales
that don't go beyond 250 pounds, and
throws shots and discuses and things.
He's mighty inexperienced, but,

nonetheless, has already shoved the
16-pound weight 47 feet into space, I
and, in addition, has heaved the dis
cus 135 feet from a standing position.
Weightmcn Look Good
If all goes well, he should make j
Stanford's weight men the strongest I
on the coast, as Jim Reynolds and j
Pete Zagar, specializing in shot and }
discus, respectively, are already re
garded as championship material.
Bill McCurdy, who has heretofore ■
confined his efforts mainly to the j
half-mile event, will very likely do j
double duty this spring, adding the |
mile run to his already hefty burden. |
McCurdy was elccted captain of the
1937 squad at the close of last quar- i
ter.
Rusty March, letterman half-miler j
from the 1935 varsity, has returned to j
school to strengthen the distance
corps.
Jack Weierhauser, who accom- j
plished big things in the 440 last !
year, will be returning, as will Bob i
Alexander, miler, and Ed Burrows, j
two-miler whose season may be
hampered by an ankle that was j
broken last fall.
Iliscrinan Sprints
Stan Hiserman, from San Mateo ;
J.C., is expected to capably take care ,
of the sprints, together with the vet- I
eran Jimmy Kneubuhl.
Big guns on the frosh squad will
probably be little Ray Brown, 23- 1
foot broad jumper from Riverside,'
and Tom O'Leary, half-miler.
Things appear to be looking up for
Track Mentor Dink Templeton and
his harriers.
Time was, way back in 1936, when
it was extremely doubtful whether
Coach Dink and his first lieutenant,
Bill Ellington, would be able to so
much as field a presentable squad,
much less go to town with it.
But, 'tis said, time heals all wounds,
and she has done a px-etty good job
since last fall for Dink.
Dates To Be Announced
The schedules, varsity and fresh
man, have not been drawn up as yet,
but. according to Coach Ellington,
will be completely filled out by the
last of this week. Only definite dates
so far arranged for are the California
varsity meet on April 24 at Berkeley,
and the Pacific Coast Conference get
together at Los Angeles during May
28-29. This engagement, as it did last
year, conicts with the eastern
1.C.4-A. meet.
However tough the schedules may
be, the Stanford squad will be a lot
more capable of handling its respec
tive opponents than they would
have been last fall.
