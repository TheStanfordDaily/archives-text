# Card Hoopmen Meet Montana Cagers Tonight
## Stanford Slated To Whip Bobcats at Bozeman Before Return to Farm 
### 
With six of the seven intersectional
games quite successfully removed
and packed in formaldehyde for all to
look upon as Stanford victories, in
cluding the 58-2G operation on Ham
line University in St. Paul Monday
night, the Cardinal cagers wind up
their regular biennial transconti
nental trip against Montana State at
Bozeman tonight.
It is not expected that the dissec
tion of the Bozeman team will be
very painful, since the Stanford at
tack has proved to be a very potent
anesthetic against every opponent
this season, including those that have
been rated at the top of the national
basketball heap by consensus of
opinion.
Bobcats Hold Championship
Coached by John "Brick" Breeden,
the Bobcats have been Montana
champions every year but one since
1920. Last year they clawed every
team in their division of the Rocky
Mountain conference twice, with the
exception of Utah State, which out
fit they beat once.
They still like to talk of the 1928-
29 season, for it was then that the
Bobcats took an eastern trip which
netted them wins over Purdue, Ne
braska, and a few other top-notch
teams of that sector. However, ad
vance reports have it that this team
hasn't so many guns as its predeces
sor. Breeden will be able to put a
fairly big team on the floor, five of
his first nine players being between
6 feet and 6 feet, 4 inches tall, to off
set the tremendous height of the
Card cagers to a certain extent.
The Stanford hoopmen will leave
Bozeman for Portland tomorrow, ar
riving there Friday morning with
only an hour to stretch their legs be
fore they depart for San Francisco.
The team will reach Palo Alto Satur
day morning, probably about 10:30
o'clock.
