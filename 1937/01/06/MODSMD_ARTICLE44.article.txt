# Frosh Hoopsters Practice Offense
## 
### 
Spending the majority of practice
l time stressing offense, Coach Wytze
' Gorter drove his frosh hoop team
j through play after play toward the
â€¢ imaginary opponent's goal.
Using Tom Siebert and Leon La
faille as key men, Mentor Gorter had
j his squad run through out-of
bounds plays featuring a very fast
break. Starting from practically
every spot on the court, the Class of
'40 basketeers cut loose with dazzling
offensive tricks which put the de
fensive quintets to a hard test.
The freshmen open their season
| Friday night in the Pavilion against
] the Parrots of Polytechnic High.
