# The 						Death of Childhood's Illusions

While each pitter-patter of the raindrops sings
musically: "Chirrup —chirrup—tweet—tweet —
Lagunita is getting damper," the steady thump
thump-thump from the Ad building sounds out
the fact that another nail is being slowly in
serted in the coffin of the Nitery, whether on
Lagunita or not.
In the first place we have the substitute plan
of the Old Union social lounge, whose principal
fame so far has been that it is not so far away
from the Ad building as the golf clubhouse.
In the second place we have the slow un
raveling of the evolutionary process as exhib
ited at Stanford. Whereas many students were
under the impression that Nitery building
might be started by the end of last quarter, it
seems that estimates are still in the process of
construction, and the figures are still dangerous
but passable.
There is the possibility that if we think real
hard we shall be out of the retrenchments by
Christmas. And by that time nobody will have
heard of the Nitery and nobody will believe
in Santa Claus, and this will be a heck of a
cynical world without any Santa Claus, don't
you think so?
