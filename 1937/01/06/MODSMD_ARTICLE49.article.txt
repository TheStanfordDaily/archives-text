Suggested in the last Ex Committee meeting
of fall quarter was a plan to shift the office ten
ures of elected student officers.
It was proposed that students chosen for next
year would take office during spring quarter
so that they could get a chance to become ac
quainted with their jobs while the old officers
are still around school.
If this were adopted it would logically lead
to the abandonment of the idea of hold-over
offices on Ex Committee, Women's and Men's
Council, since the hold-over office was sup
posed to fill the same purpose of this spring
quarter office-taking plan, and for the added
reason that the slate of student body officers
now elected in May would have to be elected
in winter quarter, at which time the hold-over
officers are now elected.
Under the present constitution a graduate, a
junior man, and a sophomore woman have
been elected to Ex Committee, two members
each to Men's and Women's Councils, a mem
ber to the 8.A.C., and the next year's head yell
leader and his assistants are elected on the
second Tuesday in February election. The
rest of the officers are elected on the third
Tuesday in May.
The new plan, by advancing the main elec
tions into winter quarter, would shove the half
year elections into fall quarter, or more likely,
shove them out entirely. The newly elected
man would have an opportunity to contact his
predecessor. Just exactly how much of a prac
tical help this would be is doubtful. It is said
that in some of the women's administrative
offices such a guiding hand is needed.
However, practice in other positions seems
to indicate that even when the old officers are
around school, they are no more available than
President Roosevelt, that the ropes are learned
from such infallible teachers as Stevie and
Aten, the A.S.S.U. dignitaries, University ad
ministrators, and by the invaluable process of
trial and error.
In only a few of the A.S.S.U. offices are the
duties so complex that they can't be learned in
a very few minutes. And even in the com
plicated offices, such as student manager, it is
doubtful just exactly how much the retiring
manager can tell his successor, and just how
gratefully what he offers will be received.
Another point against the proposal is that
the summer vacation does make a natural break
in activity and that budgets and other advance
plans are more easily fitted to the academic
year.
Also to be considered is the practical cam
pus politics of the matter. Much of the jockey
ing around for A.S.S.U. offices comes during
the committeeing that is so rampant during the
spring quarter on various activities and par
ticularly on the Convalescent Home Drive. To
have our A.S.S.U. election in winter quarter
would make nominations more difficult, since
the Drive and the various dance committees are
the proving grounds for our various political
minded campus figures and figureheads. The
less well known the candidates are before the
various caucuses, the more the caucuses must
depend upon the machinations of the various
gentlemen who stay up late at night and smoke
black cigars.
Of course, I'll admit that there is one school
of thought that thinks that campus politics ex
ists solely for the sake of Cardinals, caucuses,
and long, black cigars; however, there are
others who think there is some purpose to it
all, and behind the rigid regimentation of the
righteous requisition, there is a divine hand
that beckons, a white light that lights, a strong
voice that leads us on we know not whither.

quarter office-taking plan, and for the added
reason that the slate of student body officers
now elected in May would have to be elected
in winter quarter, at which time the hold-over
officers are now elected.
Under the present constitution a graduate, a
junior man, and a sophomore woman have
been elected to Ex Committee, two members
each to Men's and Women's Councils, a mem
ber to the 8.A.C., and the next year's head yell
leader and his assistants are elected on the
second Tuesday in February election. The
rest of the officers are elected on the third
Tuesday in May.
The new plan, by advancing the main elec
tions into winter quarter, would shove the half
year elections into fall quarter, or more likely,
shove them out entirely. The newly elected
man would have an opportunity to contact his
predecessor. Just exactly how much of a prac
tical help this would be is doubtful. It is said
that in some of the women's administrative
offices such a guiding hand is needed.
However, practice in other positions seems
to indicate that even when the old officers are
around school, they are no more available than
President Roosevelt, that the ropes are learned
from such infallible teachers as Stevie and
Aten, the A.S.S.U. dignitaries, University ad
ministrators, and by the invaluable process of
trial and error.
In only a few of the A.S.S.U. offices are the
duties so complex that they can't be learned in
a very few minutes. And even in the com
plicated offices, such as student manager, it is
doubtful just exactly how much the retiring
manager can tell his successor, and just how
gratefully what he offers will be received.
Another point against the proposal is that
the summer vacation does make a natural break
in activity and that budgets and other advance
plans are more easily fitted to the academic
year.
Also to be considered is the practical cam
pus politics of the matter. Much of the jockey
ing around for A.S.S.U. offices comes during
the committeeing that is so rampant during the
spring quarter on various activities and par
ticularly on the Convalescent Home Drive. To
have our A.S.S.U. election in winter quarter
would make nominations more difficult, since
the Drive and the various dance committees are
the proving grounds for our various political
minded campus figures and figureheads. The
less well known the candidates are before the
various caucuses, the more the caucuses must
depend upon the machinations of the various
gentlemen who stay up late at night and smoke
black cigars.
Of course, I'll admit that there is one school
of thought that thinks that campus politics ex
ists solely for the sake of Cardinals, caucuses,
and long, black cigars; however, there are
others who think there is some purpose to it
all, and behind the rigid regimentation of the
righteous requisition, there is a divine hand
that beckons, a white light that lights, a strong
voice that leads us on we know not whither.
Suggested in the last Ex Committee meeting
of fall quarter was a plan to shift the office ten
ures of elected student officers.
It was proposed that students chosen for next
year would take office during spring quarter
so that they could get a chance to become ac
quainted with their jobs while the old officers
are still around school.
If this were adopted it would logically lead
to the abandonment of the idea of hold-over
offices on Ex Committee, Women's and Men's
Council, since the hold-over office was sup
posed to fill the same purpose of this spring
quarter office-taking plan, and for the added
reason that the slate of student body officers
now elected in May would have to be elected
