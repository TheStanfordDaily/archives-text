BACHELOR OF SNATCH
Tactlessly we mention a Gee-Man's statement that
kidnapping will be fought to extinction.
We mention it because it occurred to us. And it
occurred to us not by an inexcusably perverted quirk
of the subconscious, but because kidnaping at the
moment is neither extinct nor battling for life.
It is doirtg well to the tune of $28,000 —which is
very fine indeed. And though we join the Gee-man in
damning kidnaping as a loathsome crime, we are
forced to observe its loathsomeness has not affected its
health and that it is being given every chance to become
even more loathsome and more healthy.

For the police of the nation and state, active war
riors against the passive monster, in Tacoma have
agin as usual become passive warriors against an active
monster. They are sitting on their hands to avoid ag
gravating a man who might, if upset, kill Charles
Mattson.
They should send the kidnaper a can of bicarbonate
of soda so he won't murder Charles during a painful
gas attack.

Considered objectively, the kidnaper is a smart man.
His profession would l'ate tops even when tested with
the job-criteria of the Stanford man.
Kidnaping is easy: witness Mattson and Lindbergh.
It is safe: try to match the kidnapings in your time
with the number of sure convictions.
It is profitable: one job is worth a fortune.
It is quick: you are your own boss from the jump.
And many say, jokingly of course, that it is more
decent than stock market manipulations.

Kidnaping is the only crime, that, when committed,
automatically tends to stop attempts to catch the crim
inal. Primarily, Charles' parents want Charles. Sec
ondarily, they want his abductor. The first desire takes
complete precedence until it is certain Charles can
never be had. Then, and then only, are the dogs of
the law unleashed—almost always too late for the
scent.

Though a victim's family infrequently will crucify
itself to wreak vengeance, vengeance is almost in
variably impossible. Save for his own confession, un
equivocal identification of the kidnaper is impossible.
And always, if the victim's loved ones are foolish
enough to pursue both kidnaper and kidnapeo, the
latter, and the evidence he constitutes, can easily be
buried beyond legal recall.
No cop can fight such a combination. Statements
that kidnaping, essentially unchanged down the ages,
is at last declining, are pure drivel. For love of family,
also unchanged down the ages, makes kidnaping as
possible today as yesterday. Its decline can be due not
to judicial activity, but to stupid criminal passivity.

However, should a Stanford man be insulted by men
tion of him and kidnaping on the same typewriter—we
recall that Cal men threatened to kidnap Wilbur.
Stanford men did not threaten to kidnap Sproul.
