As an example of the good care the B.A.C. takes of
the athlete after the end of training season, I offer the
tale -of the football special which carried back our
heroes following the 7-0 snowstorm in the Yankee
Stadium.
The train was scheduled to take a two-hour time
out in Reno due to one of those mysteries of life that
only the railroad schedule-maker or a good, competent
adding machine can understand.
When the B.A.C. officials learned of this, they wont
into a consultation upon Ihe relative humidity of the
Yankee Stadium, the train, the players, and Reno.
The result was that they had the engineer slow ihe
train down so they wouldn't have to stop-over in Reno.
They were afraid of a precipitation.
As an example of the good care Stanford students
take of their professors, I relate the story of a student
in a sociology class whe* got interested in finding out
what books his professor was reading. The student had
his eye on the impending sociology final, and thought
there was no point in reading any of the books that the
prof wasn t reading. He edged his way into the library
files, looked up the cold dope and discovered that his
professor had been reading only detective stories.
I don't know if the student read the detective stories
while studying for his finals, but if he did, and supple
mented that with a little field trip info Dick Tracy,
Dan Dunn, and the Good-will Court of Human Rela
tions, he would have been a cinch for an A, or some
thing.

Alpha Epsilon for a month's board.
That's 40 for tonight, Sam.
