The selection of THIS SIDE IDOL
ATRY, based on legends of Shake
speare's life, by Director Gordon
Lange and the rest of Dramatic
Council for this quarter's student
production is one to be commended.
Talbot Jennings, the playwright,
modernizes the poet, breezes up
speech and action and the result is a j
robust piece that may satisfy casual j
students even more than serious stu- j
dents of Shakesepare. Costumes and ,
interiors probably will be of the pe- |
riod.
Roadside last quarter was an ex- !
periment that helped jar Stanford out |
of its traditional apathy toward the i
Drama; THIS SIDE IDOLATRY;
should do much toward completing
the process. Until the new theater is
completed . . .
As for the theater in San Francisco.
Running at the Curran this week is
The Great Waltz, Max Gordon's mu
sical dramatization of incidents in the
lives of the Johann Strausses. The
company includes a chorus and ballet
of eighty-two, and a thirty-piece or
chestra. Promised in mid-February
is Leslie Howard's Hamlet.
Cocktail Bar, an operetta by Lloyd
Chase, opens on January 11 at the
Geary Theater to be followed by the
world premiere of a drama by Amory
Hare, The Return of Hannibal, which
supposedly takes up with Robert
Sherwood's Road to Rome, where
that playwright left off. Billed for
early spring are Ina Claii'e in End of
Summer, Pride and Prejudice, and
George Abbott's latest. Brother Rat.
George Gershwin, pianist-compos
er, will be the guest artist of Pierre
Monteux and the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestx - a at their open
ing pair of concerts this Fi'iday af
ternoon and Saturday night. The
pianist will play his Concerto in F
