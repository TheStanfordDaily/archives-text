# Union Board To Consider Nitery Plans
## Remodelling Estimates Drawn Up for Lobby Of Stanford Union 
### 
With action depending on final
decisions of Union Board of Gov
ernors and Ex Committee, estimates
are being made of the cost of re
moving office partitions in A.S.S.U.
lobby and converting the space into
a "nitery" dance spot, according to
student manager Chuck Fontius.
Latest plans are to leave A.S.S.U.
office in its present location, which
is the most convenient for ticket
sales, and specify shifting such cu
bicles as house dramatic manager
and rally committee upstairs to ac
commodations at present occupied
by Union boarders. Miss Christine
Ricker, Union director, suggests
sliding screens to cover the A.S.S.U.
office front after business hours.
Comptroller Almon Roth, member
of Union Board of Governors, ex
plained that his office awaited the
findings of that body before pro
ceeding with any alterations.
Ex Committee understood that the
lobby was to have been renovated
over Christmas vacation so that the
nitery—demand for which was as
certained last quarter—would have
been functioning early in the winter
term.
Meanwhile, as Ex Committee did
not meet this week,' no nitery is
scheduled for the coming week
end.
In its present unimproved condi
tion, A.S.S.U. lobby, at one time a
little-used social room, played host
to two nitery dances, sponsored by
Cardinals. A dance was also given
at the golf course country club,
where fountain service, scenery, and
a full moon are more available than
at the Union.
However, authorities dinged the
golf club location, as well as a sepa
rate structure proposed to be con
structed by the shores of Lagunita.
The A.S.S.U. lobby was selected
for redecorating, and toward the
close of last quarter Union Board of
Governors signified their approval
to removing the office partitions.
