# Revised King Queen Race May Be Held
## Cardinals Seek To Remove Graft, Corruption Of Masque Ball Election 
### DAVE LEFF 
Deciding to continue the Masque
Ball king-queen contest for conval
escent home benefit if a suitable way
of voting can be found, but leav
ing its voting reform squarely up to
the student suggestion in the Daily,
Cardinals last night considered
means of taking the dirt out of this
popularity election.
Exposed last year as an institution
shot with graft and corruption, the
campaign of choosing masque mon
archs will be cleaned up by concrete
.student-suggestion programs pre
sented to The Daily, agreed Stan
ford's activities organization.
Readers To Decide
Formerly, an unlimited number of
votes were cast at one ccnt per, and
Greek living groups expended undue
amounts of money to elect their
nominees. Thus, a choice of royalty
to preside over the annual Masque
Ball degenerated into a matching of
bank books along the Row. Such a
bad taste did the last campaign leave
in the mouth of Stanford that it was
decided to abandon the election.
Cardinals, however, anxious to
have monarchs for the Masque and
desirous of contributing again to
Convalescent Home, are leaving the
entire matter squarely up to the
readers of the Daily.
How would you conduct the king
queen contest so that, lucre would not
over-ride popularity? Suggested was
the listing of candidates, together
with their pictures, and drawing up
a list of faked names—sounding like
race horse monickers—and having all
vote blind. That is, one votes for the
name, not knowing with what cam
pus figure it is matched.
Stork Derby?
Jeeb Halaby thought of scrapping
the king-queen tussle in favor of a
stork derby.
Strongly solicited by both Cardi
nals and the Daily are sane, work
able suggestions for 1 conducting this
affair. Workable plans will be pub
lished and the best adopted.
Continuing with plans for the win
ter barn dance brought up last quar
ter, the activities organization ap
pointed Jeeb Halaby and Bob Mal
let to secure a favorable closcd date !
for the rustic program.
