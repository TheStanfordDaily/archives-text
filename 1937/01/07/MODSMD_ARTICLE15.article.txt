The Veterans of Future Wars
swept into the campus and national
limelight, then swept out again al
most as fast.
But here's a student organization
which, if successful, will solve one
of the highest problems of American
life. It is called the "Two-Can-Live
as-Cheaply Association."
If you arc married and find that ,
two can live just about as cheaply ]
as two, look over the new "family j
co-operative" idea fermented by the
127 student-spouses of the Univer- I
sity of Oregon. Here's what they
have in mind:
Plan Buying
Work out plans for co-operative
buying of household necessities of
married couples.

Make a study of individual prob
lems and exchange experiences to
help produce a workable "two-can
live-as-cheaply-as-one" plan.
Promote and develop social affairs
for young married couples.
Howard Kesslar, a bridegroom, got
the original idea. Reinhardt Knud
son, whoso married life dates back
to last summer, got in early on the
, organization detail.
Ex-King Invited
The "Tel aca," as the organization
I is informally called, has been ap
! proved by the University and awaits
success on the Eugene campus be
fore a national campaign is launched.
