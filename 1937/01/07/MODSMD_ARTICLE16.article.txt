# Farm Croups To Consider Youth Bill
## Meeting Tonight Starts Campaign To Secure Act for Student Aid 
### W. A. MILLIS 
Several Stanford organizations
join forces tonight in a promotional
meeting for a proposed California
Youth Act and for the coming North
ern California Assembly, which will
meet in San Francisco on Saturday
and Sunday.
Final purpose of the campaign is to
draft a bill providing vocational
training, jobs and security for Cali
fornia youth and to secure its passage
by the state legislature.
Tonight's meeting, at 7:30 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse, will con
sider the background of the move
ment for a California youth bill, and
the purposes which such a measure
would attempt, to fulfill.
Tonight's Speakers
Speakers scheduled for tonight in
clude Claudia Williams, of the Busi
ness and Industrial department of the
San Francisco Y.W.C.A., who will
discuss "The Backgrounds and Rea
sons for a California Youth Act,"
and Dewey Anderson, ex-state as
semblyman from Palo Alto and for
merly of the Stanford faculty, who
will talk on "The Significance of the
Youth Act."
More than 500 young people, rep
resenting several hundred youth or
ganizations, are expected to attend
the sessions of the Northern Califor
nia Youth Assembly in San Francisco
January 9 and 10. A similar as
sembly for Southern California will
meet in Los Angeles at the same time.
Endorsed by Clubs
Campus groups already endorsing
the Assembly are the Y.W.C.A. and
the American Student Union. Efforts
are being made at the present time
by representatives of the "Y" to con
tact other student organizations, in
cluding the A.S.S.U., departmental,
and church clubs, urging them to
send delegates or observers to to
night's meeting, and to join in the
campaign for a California Youth Act.
However, sponsors point out that to
night's meeting is open to all inter
ested students.
No Present Act
There is now no such thing as a
youth bill before the state legislature.
The whole purpose of the coming as
sembly in San Francisco *s to draft
such a measure, and to organize a
campaign for its adoption. The pres
ent campaign is based on a draft
proposal for a youth bill adopted a
year ago by the Asilomar convention
of the Business-Industrial depart
ment of the California^Y.W.C.A.,
which will be the basis of discussion
at the Youth Assembly.
Federal Act Awaited
The youth bill in its final draft will
probably contain an extension of the
provisions of NYA, and will be man
aged democratically by a state youth
commission, which will include rep
resentatives from the government,
youth organizations, and social serv
ice workers. It. will be designed to
operate during the period before the
passage by Congress of a national
act, which will probably be consid
ered during the coming year.
The Northern California Youth
Assembly and the proposed Califor
nia Youth Aft have been endorsed
by a number of prominent educa
tional, business, religious, social
service, trade union, political, and
youth leaders in the bay area. Stan
ford faculty backing the assembly in
clude H. C. Brown, Edward Maslin
Hulme, H. D. Roberts, and Grayson
Kefauver.
