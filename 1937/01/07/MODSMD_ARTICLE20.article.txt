## Rufus Jones To Preach In Chapel Sunday 
### 
On January 19, 17, and 24, the
next three Sundays, the addresses of
Dr. Rufus M. Jones, widely known
American philosopher and author
will constitute the high point of the
present academic year in the relig
ious program of the University.
Dr. Jones, who has been on the
faculty of Haverford College for
more than 40 years, is now the Emer
itus Professor of Philosophy in that
institution, and also a member of the
Board of Preachers of Harvard Uni
versity. In constant demand by
American colleges, Dr. Jones has
been brought to Stanford by Dr.
Trueblood, Stanford chaplain, his in
timate friend and teaching colleague
in the Philosophy Department of
Haverford College until the retire
ment of Dr. Jones.
It is contended by many that the
books of Dr. Jones are more widely
read by those interested in religion
in America today than are the books
of any other single author.
Dr. Jones is a member of the Board
of Trustees of Brown University and
chairman of the American Friends
Service Committee. This organiza
tion instituted a vast program of re
lief in Europe during and following
the war which brought Dr. Jones
into close contact with ex-President
Hoover.
