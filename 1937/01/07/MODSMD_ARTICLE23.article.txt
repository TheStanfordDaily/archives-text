# No Epidemic, Farm Ready Says Medic
## 
### 
With eight, cases of flu reported
at Palo Alto hospital, Stanford auth
orities are cleaning, and setting in
order the isolation hospital in an
ticipation of an overflow of patients
at the Paly institution.
Whereas no epidemic exists, ac
cording to Temporary Health Direc
tor W. H. Brown, precautionary
measures are being taken to allow
for any unexpected developments.
The isolation building accomo
dates 30 to 35, and was last used dur
ing, (he German Measles epidemic
of last year, when cases exceeded
the combined facilities of Stanford
hospitalization beds.
Epidemics are constituted by a
wide distribution of cases affecting
a high percentage of the population,
rather than by a large number of
localized cases, explained Dr. Brown.
He warned Stanford students to re
port any respiratory discomfort to
men's or women's health services
rather than attempting home treat
ment as however ready and available
the isolation hospital is, it is desired
to go without its use this year.
