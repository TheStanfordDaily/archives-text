# Film Programs Begin Tonight
## Early Edison Productions Included on Bill 
### 
Episodes from old films collected
by the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, will be shown in the as
sembly hall at 7:30 o'clock this eve
ning. This is the first in a series of
showings planned in conjunction
with the new course on motion pic
ture appreciation.
Interested persons not registered in
the course may attend the showings.
Subscription tickets entitling the
purchaser to admission to any three
of the five programs may be pur
chased for $1 at the A.S.S.U. offices
or from the secretary of the art de
partment.
Tonight's program has been com
piled to show the development of
narrative, and will include: Edison's
"The Execution of Mary Queen of
Scots," produced in 1893; "Wash Day
Troubles," 1895; Melies' "A Trip to
the Moon," 1902; Edison's "The Great
Train Robbery," produced in 1903;
"Faust," a Pathe film of 1910; and
Sarah Bernhardt, in Paramount's
"Queen Elizabeth" of 1911.
The first two numbers are very
fragmentary episodes produced in
the ninetiesâ€”from these the devel
opment is shown through "The Great
Train Robbery," the first melodrama
written for the films, to "Queen Eliz
abeth." In the latter, for the first
time, a famous stage celebrity con
descended to perform before the
camera.
