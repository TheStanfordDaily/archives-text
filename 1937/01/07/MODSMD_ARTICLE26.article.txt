# Leaders' Views Differ On Proposed Election Change
## 
### 
Ex Committee opinion on the pro
posed A.S.S.U. election change -
moving ahead the annual installation
from fall to the beginning of spring
quarterâ€”is considerably divided,
with definite action set for next
Tuesday's meeting.
Changing the installation date will
also invoke a change in the election
date from May to February.
Terming the move a "darn good
idea," Chick Franieh said in its fa- !
vor, "It. would give the seniors a j
chance to relax. As it is now, the !
seniors relax anyway and sort of!
let things go to hell toward the i
end."
Although Esther Pelton. A.S.S.U
vice-president, thought the move i
worthy of consideration, she pointed 1
out the disadvantage that it might
keep the year's program from being
unified. "The question," she said,
"is whether or not we want to use
the spring quarter in planning for

(he next year's work. It might prove
more satisfactory to move only the
election date forward, letting new
officers spend the spring quarter
learning the ropes."
Bob Mallett: "I think the plan has
considerable merit, although some
of the advantages have been exag
gerated. It would be difficult to
change on such short notice, and I
doubt if incoming candidates would
! benefit much from association with
the other officers."
Roy Anderson, chairman of Men's
! Council, is reported definitely op
posed to the change. It would, hr
says, split the term in two without
doing any appreciable good. He feels
i that it would be unwise to shift to
' the middle of tho school year the
| officers' period of relaxation, which
always comes toward the end of
their terms. Anderson, however, it
is reported, does not disapprove of
i changing the time of the elections.
