# Cardinals 66, Bobcats 28, Weather -40
## Touring Indian Hoopmen Down Montana State Without Warming Up 
### 
BOZEMAN, Montana, Jan. 6 (UP).
—Stanford University's touring bas
ketball team tonight easily defeated
the Montana State College quintet
66-23 while the thermometer dipped
to 40 below as Montana felt the na
tion's cold snap.
High scorer for the Californians
tonight was Stoefen, who rolled up a
total of 13 points. Moore netted 10
and Luisetti scored 10 points.
For the Bobcats Ogle was high
with 8 points, Zupan accumulated 5,
and Zavich scored 4.
It was the first game on the home
fioor this year for Montana State,
who won 4 victories in 6 starts on its
holiday tour of the Pacific Coast.
Score at the half was 36 to 13.
The Stanford reserves defeated
Montana State reserves in a close and
interesting preliminary game 15 to 11.
The game was demonstration of the
no-center-jump style of play.
Two days of traveling, two more
of rest, and then four of concentrat
ed practice for the first two U.C.L.A.
games in the pavilion a week from
i? riday and Saturday face Stanford's
varsity cagers as they leave Boze
man, Montana, after last night's bat
tle with the Montana State College
Bobcats.
The Card wicketers are scheduled
to arrive in Palo Alto Saturday
at 10:30 a.m. after a trip from
Bozeman by way of Portland that
will have only a one-hour rest in
Portland and an hour-and-a-half
pause in San Francisco. They will
not work out on the Farm until
Monday afternoon, starting a short
gathering drive toward the first of
the Bruin series.
The games with the Westwood out
fit will be no pushovers, it was de
clared by Bunn earlier in the season,
for Caddy Works still has his head
line attraction of two years, Long
John Ball, as the main star in a
troupe of what consistently have
been fair country ball handlers. The
Huskies of Washington took a heart
breaker from the Bruins last week
52-51, a game that went to two extra
periods. The Washingtons figure they
have one of their strongest teams,
possibly even better than that they
had last year, which was good
enough to meet Stanford in the Coast
championship play-off.

Score at the half was 36 to 13.
The Stanford reserves defeated
Montana State reserves in a close and
interesting preliminary game 15 to 11.
The game was demonstration of the
no-center-jump style of play.
Two days of traveling, two more
of rest, and then four of concentrat

games in the pavilion a week from

varsity cagers as they leave Boze
man, Montana, after last night's bat

Bobcats.
The Card wicketers are scheduled
to arrive in Palo Alto Saturday
at 10:30 a.m. after a trip from
Bozeman by way of Portland that
will have only a one-hour rest in
Portland and an hour-and-a-half
pause in San Francisco. They will
not work out on the Farm until
Monday afternoon, starting a short
gathering drive toward the first of
the Bruin series.
The games with the Westwood out
fit will be no pushovers, it was de
clared by Bunn earlier in the season,
for Caddy Works still has his head
line attraction of two years, Long
John Ball, as the main star in a
troupe of what consistently have
been fair country ball handlers. The
Huskies of Washington took a heart
breaker from the Bruins last week
52-51, a game that went to two extra
periods. The Washingtons figure they
have one of their strongest teams,
possibly even better than that they
had last year, which was good
enough to meet Stanford in the Coast
championship play-off.
