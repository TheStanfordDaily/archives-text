# SOUR SGRIPES
## HOW PURE WE [illegible] 
### 
Yesterday I mentioned the school
of thought that claims America is be
ing goaded to the very brink of hell
by foul moving pictures.
There are a lot of serious-minded
people who think the same thing in
milder form. Such sincere people
honestly believe that movies showing
that debauchery has its advantages
ought to be censored somewhat in the
interests of social morality.
But there is another class of moral
ists who have been the laughing
stock of journalists and scribblers
since the days of the Cro-Magnon
Daily Bugle and maybe even before
that. These Pollyannas in adult's
clothing who believe that almost ev
erything in this best of all possible
worlds is ultimately sweet and lovely
and that the way to correct things
which are not is to place the hand
over the eyes and peep at what is
dirty and rotten from between their
lingers, are touchingly sincere with
their good intentions.
But there is no more annoying pest
and positive scourge than the busy
body who would reform the world
with good intentions. I refer more
specifically to the various censorship
boards which have attempted to
clean up the moving pictures. What
the current League for Decency is
doing, I do not know, but if they
are trying to cut out naughty lines
while allowing to flourish the mon
j.trous Hollywood institution of the
invariable happy ending, I would
suggest that they are missing the
forest lor (he trees.

As recent as 1928 there existed a
National Motion Picture League
which stands to my mind as the
classic example of what can happen
were a horde of small-time moralists
and Puritanical peanuts let loose to
make the movies over in the image
and likeness of sugar and spice and
all that's nice.
I reprint their comments on va
rious moving pictures with the hope
that the relative antiquity of the
shows does not muff the whole point
of this harrangue:
"Aesop's Fables — Sunday on the
Farm." Synopsis: Making the hens
lay.
Our reasons for not endorsing:
Fighting, throwing eggs, slingshots,
PUTTING BLAME ON INNOCENT
MOUSE. (Capitals mine.)
"The Bargain Hunt." Synopsis:
Man and wife succeed in buying
chair at a sale, but husband falls
downstairs with it and breaks it.
Our reasons for not endorsing:
Display of underwear, vulgarity,
"skirt-chaser," baby sitting in cuspi
dor.
Remarks: Good story.
"Lilac Time." Synopsis: Seven accs
of the British Royal Flying Corps are
stationed on Lilac Farm in France.
Jeannine, the daughter of the house
hold. prays for all of them and falls
in love with cne. Through all the
cruelties of war their love survives.
Our reasons for not endorsing: Dis
play of methods of warfare.
Remarks: Constant display of war
has a tendency to popularize war.
(So everybody would want to be a
soldier after seeing "All Quiet on the
Western Front," eh?)
"Hollywood or Bust." Synopsis:
After many family scenes, youth suc
ceeds in getting permission to leave
for Hollywood.
Our reasons for not endorsing: At
tempting to disobey parents, battle
with Indians, bow-and-arrow and
gun display, shooting, fighting, death
imminent.
Remarks: Constant display of
pseudo-show life in thrilling, exag
gerated form is unwholesome.
But the one judgment which un
questionably displays the quality of
the League's genius is not the rec
ommendation that some show be
banned because one actor stuck out
his tongue, but rather their comment
on "The Street of Illusion."
Synopsis: Discouraged actor is
forced to take small part in play with
girl he loves. He envies leading man
and plans for his death, by changing
the blank for a leaded shot. Ho re
ceives the wound.
Reasons for not endorsing: The
display of the unhappy side of life
is certainly out of place in the theater
where people gather for the purpose
of joy.
Gentlemen, fetch me my copy of
Bunny Rabbit.

Yesterday I mentioned the school
of thought that claims America is be
ing goaded to the very brink of hell
by foul moving pictures.
There are a lot of serious-minded
people who think the same thing in
milder form. Such sincere people
honestly believe that movies showing
that debauchery has its advantages
ought to be censored somewhat in the
interests of social morality.
But there is another class of moral
ists who have been the laughing
stock of journalists and scribblers
since the days of the Cro-Magnon
Daily Bugle and maybe even before
that. These Pollyannas in adult's
clothing who believe that almost ev
erything in this best of all possible
worlds is ultimately sweet and lovely
and that the way to correct things
which are not is to place the hand
over the eyes and peep at what is
dirty and rotten from between their
lingers, are touchingly sincere with
their good intentions.
But there is no more annoying pest
and positive scourge than the busy
body who would reform the world
with good intentions. I refer more
specifically to the various censorship
boards which have attempted to
clean up the moving pictures. What
the current League for Decency is
doing, I do not know, but if they
are trying to cut out naughty lines
while allowing to flourish the mon
j.trous Hollywood institution of the
invariable happy ending, I would
suggest that they are missing the
forest lor (he trees.

As recent as 1928 there existed a
National Motion Picture League
which stands to my mind as the
classic example of what can happen
were a horde of small-time moralists
and Puritanical peanuts let loose to
make the movies over in the image
and likeness of sugar and spice and
all that's nice.
I reprint their comments on va
rious moving pictures with the hope
that the relative antiquity of the
shows does not muff the whole point
of this harrangue:
"Aesop's Fables — Sunday on the
Farm." Synopsis: Making the hens
lay.
Our reasons for not endorsing:
Fighting, throwing eggs, slingshots,
PUTTING BLAME ON INNOCENT
MOUSE. (Capitals mine.)
"The Bargain Hunt." Synopsis:
Man and wife succeed in buying
chair at a sale, but husband falls
downstairs with it and breaks it.
Our reasons for not endorsing:
Display of underwear, vulgarity,
"skirt-chaser," baby sitting in cuspi
dor.
Remarks: Good story.
"Lilac Time." Synopsis: Seven accs
of the British Royal Flying Corps are
stationed on Lilac Farm in France.
Jeannine, the daughter of the house
hold. prays for all of them and falls
in love with cne. Through all the
cruelties of war their love survives.
Our reasons for not endorsing: Dis
play of methods of warfare.
Remarks: Constant display of war
has a tendency to popularize war.
(So everybody would want to be a
soldier after seeing "All Quiet on the
Western Front," eh?)
"Hollywood or Bust." Synopsis:
After many family scenes, youth suc
ceeds in getting permission to leave
for Hollywood.
Our reasons for not endorsing: At
tempting to disobey parents, battle
with Indians, bow-and-arrow and
gun display, shooting, fighting, death
imminent.
Remarks: Constant display of
pseudo-show life in thrilling, exag
gerated form is unwholesome.
But the one judgment which un
questionably displays the quality of
the League's genius is not the rec
ommendation that some show be
banned because one actor stuck out
his tongue, but rather their comment
on "The Street of Illusion."
