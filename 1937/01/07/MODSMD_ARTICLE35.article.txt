# Swimmers Rated Among U.S. Best
## Thornton Ranks Stanford, Yale, Michigan Tops 
### GENE GEAR 
Nort Thornton, the genital optimist
who guides aquatic destinies on the
Farm, took down his hair yesterday
afternoon and meekly admitted that
Stanford will have one of the three
strongest swimming teams in the na
tion this year.
The husky Card mentor rates Yale,
Stanford, and Michigan as the three
leading teams in the country, and
naturally favors his Redskin paddlers
to end the two-year reign of the
U.S.C. Trojans at the top of the con
ference heap.
Before the Trojans' rise into aqua
prominence, the Farm had produced
17 straight championship outfits, and
Nort and the men who do the pad
dling in their scanty red undies are
anxious to again dust off the confer
ence crown.
The 1937 swimming schedule has
not been released but Thornton ex
plains that the Indians will meet the
Olympic Club, San Jose State. U.S.C., j
U.C.L.A., Fullerton J.C., California,,
and possibly Occidental. The confer- |
ence championship meet will take
place in the Trojan plunge.
Nort boasts of strength in every
event, and expects his medley relay
team of Don Towne, Hal Weatherbe,
and Jack Vibert to attack the record
book on numerous occasions during
the season.
Representing the Farm in the
sprints will be such veterans as Mar
tin Scatena, Alec MacKenzie, and
Jack Vibert, conference 100-yard
champ. The newcomer stars in the
sprints are Dick Clark, Bill Tench,
and Spencer Moeller.
In the distance events, Thornton
will depend on three amphibians
whom he rates in the top list na
tionally, Dave Rider, Winfield Need
ham, and Don Peierson.
When Bob Walker, one of the best
back-strokers on the Pacific Coast,
announced his intention of transfer
ing to Louisiana State this quarter, a
serious blow was dealt the Card
swim team.
But along comes a lad from Golden
Gate J.C., a distance star, but he can
also swim on his back. The times he
has turned in already prove that Hal
lleatherbe will soon rise to Walker's
near top position on the coast. Dave
Duncan and Mason Letteau will be in
there to back Hal up in the upside
down event.
Don Towne, sensational submarine
breaststroker who has broken the 50-
yard and 50-meter sailor style events,
will team with Bill Hatch in the
longer breaststroke races. Towne,
due to his underwater style, loses
some of his effectiveness in the
standard intercollegiate 200-yard
event.
Performing on the springboard
this season will be Roy Winkleman,
