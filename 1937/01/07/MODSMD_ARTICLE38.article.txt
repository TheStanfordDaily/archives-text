yet untried troupe of players, who
will be assisted by a fast-acting band
of Parrots.

out on the Pavilion hardwood tomor
row evening, they will be warming
up for their first game of the season,
to be played against the Parrots of
Polytechnic High.
The Parrots, with the exception of
one man, have exactly the same team
which last year, as 130-pounders,
won 23 consecutive games and the
city title. Coach Gordon Carlson of
Polytechnic has a team which, al
though small, plays a lightning-fast
game.
The frosh, in their scrimmage yes
terday, threw passes with bullet-like
accuracy. The second team had a
tough time holding on to the ball
long enough to do any damage, as
dribbles and passes alike were brok
en up by the first string ball hawks.
Probable starters for the frosh
will be Tom Siebert at center, Ted
Lyon and Leon Lafaille at forwards,
and V/ill Anderson and Gil R;ihn at
