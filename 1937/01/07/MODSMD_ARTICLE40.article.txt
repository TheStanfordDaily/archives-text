## INTRODUCING: 'THE OTHER MAJOR SPORT" 
### 
The selection of Bill Seward and
Bob Underwood as tenth on the U.S.
L.T.A. doubles rankings for 193(5
brings to mind a subject that as
usual is dark and indefinite, but
which we should be praising to the
skies.
Stanford has a swell tennis record,
and Coach Sherman Lockwood de
serves a hand!
Coach Lockwood, who played some
good intercollegiate doubles when he
was at the University of Oregon,
came to Stanford in the spring of
1931, after the late Coach Frank Re
gan was killed in an automobile acci
dent over the Christmas holidays.
Since then Stanford has not lost a
tennis series to California. This in
itself is all we ought to require.
But the netmen have brought even
more renown, In 1931, Lockwood's
first year, they won the conference
championship (the conference they
enter is the Southern Division; Cal,
U.C.L.A., and U.S.C.) and near the
end of the season set a record of 27
straight won matches, or successive
clean sweeps over each of the other
three teams in the circuit.
In 1932 Keith Gledhill, who was
the last Stanford man to make the
first 10 of the U.S.L.T.A. rankings,
teamed with Joe Coughlin to win the
National Intercollegiate Doubles, and
thereby won for Stanford the coveted
Merion Cricket Club Trophy.
This trophy, which was really a
bright apple to some of the eastern
universities, was given to the first
school to score seven points, with one
point to be given to winners of In
tercollegiate Championships, and
one-half point to runners up to these

titles.
Other Stanford points on this cam
paign came from Phil Neer, singles |
champ in 1921, Neer and Davis]
doubles win in 1922, Cranston Hol
man, who was runner up in singles
in 1925 and 1926, Ralph McElvenny
and A1 Herrington, doubles champs j
in 1929, and Keith Gledhill, singles |
champ in 1931.
