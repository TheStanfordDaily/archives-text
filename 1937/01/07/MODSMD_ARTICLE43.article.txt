# NO RECITAL
## 
### 
Because additions are being made
to the organ, there will be no organ
recital this afternoon. Recitals will
be resumed with the vesper service
on Sunday afternoon.
Dey's work in the singles were good
enough to walk off with the team
championship. Seward and Under
wood afterward made a successful
tour of eastern tournaments which
won them their recent national rank
ing.
Pretty good record of Lockwood's,
eh? Six seasons, six series wins over
Cal, three conference championships,
four Intercollegiate titles, and three
mentions on U.S.L.T.A. first tens!
And with only Captain Johnny
Law graduating, how much will they
do in 1937?
