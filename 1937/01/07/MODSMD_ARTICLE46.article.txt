# Teams Sign For Intramural Hoop
## 
### 
With forty teams already on the
rolls, the 1937 intramural basketball
tournament promises to be one of
the largest in history, announces
Phil Klauber, manager. Signups
have been posted in Encina Gym
only one day, and will continue
throughout this week.
Organization managers are asked
to sign no more teams than are cer
tain to play out full schedules, as
forfeitures not only ruin the se
quence of league play bvit also cause
loss of all seasonal points. Compe
tition will begin next week.
