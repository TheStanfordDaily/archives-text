Trying to deodorize the Masque Ball King
and Queen Contest seems to be one of those
things that don't mix, such as—liquor and legis
lation.
Cardinals took the dilemma by the horns last
night by leaving it up to the campus to figure
out some means of painlessly electing a king
and queen without any of the concomitant evils
of the business cycle.
The Daily is eager to help conduct a contest,
if somebody, besides The Daily, will furnish
the prizes.
It is certain that some of those members of
our student body who miraculously learn their
economics and political science around the
Cellar fountain and the pool or ping-pong tables
ought to have the time and the imagination to
figure out how to put on an election neat but
not gaudy.
But there are a few items to consider: if we
have a contest extending over a few days, with
an attempt to limit votes in some way, we get
right back to the evils of the old contest. If we
have the contest limited to one day, with stu
dents limited to one vote at 10 cents apiece,
you lose the suspense.
But let's leave the problem up to our leisure
classes. I am busy right now engaged in a
project to make water chase itself uphill.
