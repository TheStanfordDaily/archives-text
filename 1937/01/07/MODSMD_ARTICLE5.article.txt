## 
### 
An estimate of $500 to transform
the present A.S.S.U. in the Old Un
ion offices into a hall for Cardinal's
roving nitery was termed too low
yesterday by Comptroller Almon E.
Roth.
The preliminary survey was made
by J. W. McDonnell, superintendent
of buildings and grounds at the re
quest of student President Jim Rey
nolds. No action can be taken until
Reynolds returns from the East.

To remove office partitions now oc
pupied by Dramatic Counsel, Rally
Committee, and miscellaneous
groups, patch the floor, erect an el
liptical archway in place of the doors,
renovate upstairs rooms, at present
accommodating Union boarders, for
the use of the evicted offices would
cost about $500, stated Mr. McDon
nell.
Such reconstruction, howevei',
would merely alter the bare physical
plant; the estimate provides for no
lighting fixtures, decorations, or oth
er features essential to a dance hall.
Await Reynolds Return
This $500 estimate, prepared before
Christmas, but to date unsubmitted
to any of the authorities concerned,
must be radically revised upwards,
said Comptroller Roth, when official
ly apprised of the figures. Mr. Roth
further suspected that adequate pro
vision had not been made for the re
moval of all upstairs boarders.
The problem will be taken up as
soon as Jim Reynolds, not yet re
turned from the East, Mr. Roth, Mr.
McDonnell, and the assembled board
of Union governors can come to
gether with a common understand-
