# Who Cares About All This?

### 
Free admission for college students to foot
ball games is one of the things which Dr. Louis
D. Coffman, president of the University of Min
nesota, thinks would help put the knee-pads on
commercialization of college athletics.
In his biennial report to the regents of the
University, Dr. Coffman further recommends:
the support of athletics by endov/ment funds,
the reduction of athletic expenses generally,
the elimination of long trips and the playing
only of natural rivals, higher scholastic stand
ards for athletes, and the elimination of pro
fessional gambling.
This all sounds very nice, but the tide seems
to be going in another direction. At the last
B.A.C. meeting, an alumni member recomr
mended that students be reguired to pay admis
sion not only to the usual basketball games of
U.S.C. and Cal, but also to the U.C.L.A. game.
His point was this: the local gym is small, hold
ing only 2,000.
Space is reserved for students admitted free,
but the estimated number doesn't always show
up; the result is that deserving alumni can't
buy tickets even though the gymnasium may
not be full at the start of the game.
The B.A.C. healthily turned down the idea
of charging the students and negotiations were
.started to get two of the Cal games moved to
the City, where there is a larger gym. The
U.C.L.A. admission remained unchanged.
The idea of free admission for students to
all football games was brought up by Stanford
students to administrators last quarter, and they
pointed out this argument: that other schools
have larger student bodies. If we made a free
admission arrangement with them, our B.A.C.
would lose out, since their larger student bodies
would crowd out more paying guests.
Talk of eliminating student fees and de-em
phasizing the gate thus brings up the adminis
lrative argument that such losses come out of
the B.A.C. The B.A.C. is run for the students,
so the students wouldn't gain so much in the
long run.
It is true that the B.A.C. also is run for the
alumni, and that there are many expenses
which would be eliminated if all sports were
returned to their place as educative mediums;
however, such things as Branner Hall, the
V/omen s Gym, and the athletic layout—even
if there is no intramural house—are a direct
benefit to the student body and we got those
out of the sweat of the brow of several score of
our country s f<ne young men who exercised
themselves quite vigorously on a few after

noons during the fall quarter of the past sev
eral years.
The idea of more pretty buildings nobody
3eems to want to forfeit (the B.A.C. still is pay
ing for Branner). The idea of losing to unpurged
rivals also is unattractive, and the University
really hasn't attained the proud state where it
can afford to forego the favorable publicity of
the winning teams.
And as for the alumni, you can't see them
subscribing to Buck of the Month Clubs in
large numbers in order to send the seal-bearers
of the high school scholarship societies to Stan
ford, and you can't see them sitting by peace
ably while Stanford told the Rose Bowl to go
stuff a bird, because intersectional contests are
unwholesome; if we eliminated spring practice;
gave the football, basketball, and track coaches
the equal wage of a Poly Sci instructor; and
concentrated our efforts on attempting to turn
out every Stanford student as a well-rounded
athlete in every sport.
Besides, says everybody, it really isn't as bad
here as it is in other places, football gives our
poor alumni something to think about besides
their home life and their income tax, it isn't
very hard on the football players, and even if
it is, it could be worse. And besides, who
cares?

up; the result is that deserving alumni can't
buy tickets even though the gymnasium may

The idea of free admission for students to
all football games was brought up by Stanford
students to administrators last quarter, and they
pointed out this argument: that other schools
have larger student bodies. If we made a free
admission arrangement with them, our B.A.C.
would lose out, since their larger student bodies
would crowd out more paying guests.
Talk of eliminating student fees and de-em
phasizing the gate thus brings up the adminis
lrative argument that such losses come out of
the B.A.C. The B.A.C. is run for the students,
so the students wouldn't gain so much in the
long run.
It is true that the B.A.C. also is run for the
alumni, and that there are many expenses
which would be eliminated if all sports were
returned to their place as educative mediums;
however, such things as Branner Hall, the
V/omen s Gym, and the athletic layout—even
if there is no intramural house—are a direct
benefit to the student body and we got those
out of the sweat of the brow of several score of
our country s f<ne young men who exercised
themselves quite vigorously on a few after

noons during the fall quarter of the past sev
eral years.
The idea of more pretty buildings nobody
3eems to want to forfeit (the B.A.C. still is pay
ing for Branner). The idea of losing to unpurged
rivals also is unattractive, and the University
really hasn't attained the proud state where it
can afford to forego the favorable publicity of
the winning teams.
And as for the alumni, you can't see them
subscribing to Buck of the Month Clubs in
large numbers in order to send the seal-bearers
of the high school scholarship societies to Stan
ford, and you can't see them sitting by peace
ably while Stanford told the Rose Bowl to go
stuff a bird, because intersectional contests are
unwholesome; if we eliminated spring practice;
gave the football, basketball, and track coaches
the equal wage of a Poly Sci instructor; and
concentrated our efforts on attempting to turn
out every Stanford student as a well-rounded
athlete in every sport.
Besides, says everybody, it really isn't as bad
here as it is in other places, football gives our
poor alumni something to think about besides
their home life and their income tax, it isn't
very hard on the football players, and even if
it is, it could be worse. And besides, who
cares?
Free admission for college students to foot
ball games is one of the things which Dr. Louis
D. Coffman, president of the University of Min
nesota, thinks would help put the knee-pads on
commercialization of college athletics.
In his biennial report to the regents of the
University, Dr. Coffman further recommends:
the support of athletics by endov/ment funds,
the reduction of athletic expenses generally,
the elimination of long trips and the playing
only of natural rivals, higher scholastic stand
ards for athletes, and the elimination of pro
fessional gambling.
This all sounds very nice, but the tide seems
to be going in another direction. At the last
B.A.C. meeting, an alumni member recomr
mended that students be reguired to pay admis
sion not only to the usual basketball games of
U.S.C. and Cal, but also to the U.C.L.A. game.
His point was this: the local gym is small, hold
