# BULL SESSION
## CENSORSHIP OR SENSE-ORSHIP 
### 
Today my partner in hair-tearing, aspirin-eating
and deadline-meeting grunts a terrific Gripe against
censors, those strange people who keep all filth to
themselves, and who appear to be good though know
ing all evil.
We applaud him (hi'ya, Curt), but we contend he
has the popular short-focus viewpoint on an unpopular
long-focus problem.
m * * *
He says censors are pig-heads, perversely reaching
for the unsavory because the savory has been denied
them.
* * * *
If the censors we've seen are typical, Cult's column
is a magnificent understatement.
But when he indicates the artistic agencies of the
world would be better without censors, it's time he de
fined his terms. For the movie producers, the pub
lishers, and their trained worms are "artistic agencies"
only by errors in classification.
And no one will deny it is chiefly these sources of
"art" the censor bothers. And he bothers them, not only
because they tend to indecency, but because they can
and do reach a mass public.
* * * *
To prove my point: if you have 75 cents, you can
buy free and above board such dubious phonograph
records as the "Hot Mattress Stomp" and others I
haven't the courage to recommend. Records are appar
ently uncensored. And they are uncensored not be
cause they are unable to be dirty, but because few
people have 75 cents to spend on a record.
Thus, in the censorship business, dirt is not the
only variable. More important is, how many people
will the dirt reach? And that's where the oh-so de
hydrated, oh-so objectively evil-smelling censor comes
in.
If he were suddenly i-emoved, Hollywood would not
continue to produce the same number of stinkers, and
a great number of artisticallp valid movies pre
viously withheld because of a sharp sex-angle. We
wouldn't get more sexy "Wintersets" or "Informers,"
but more and more of the bedroom banalities, just as
banal but a little more bouncey, because they pay.
* * * *
Nor is it fair to gang up on the boys because they
thumbed down "Lady Chatterley's Lover" (darned
good, by the way) before you know how many in
excusable pieces of filth they judged more sanely.
And remember, Curt, what you object to isn't cen
sorship for what the other guy reads and sees. After
all, he has to be protected from his animal nature.
You and me, we take a clinical interest in "these things,"
don't we?
Sure, and as soon as you're through with them, I'm
next.

Nor is it fair to gang up on the boys because they
thumbed down "Lady Chatterley's Lover" (darned
good, by the way) before you know how many in
excusable pieces of filth they judged more sanely.
And remember, Curt, what you object to isn't cen
sorship for what the other guy reads and sees. After
all, he has to be protected from his animal nature.
You and me, we take a clinical interest in "these things,"
don't we?
Sure, and as soon as you're through with them, I'm

Today my partner in hair-tearing, aspirin-eating
and deadline-meeting grunts a terrific Gripe against
censors, those strange people who keep all filth to
themselves, and who appear to be good though know
ing all evil.
We applaud him (hi'ya, Curt), but we contend he
has the popular short-focus viewpoint on an unpopular
long-focus problem.

He says censors are pig-heads, perversely reaching
for the unsavory because the savory has been denied
them.
* * * *
If the censors we've seen are typical, Cult's column
is a magnificent understatement.
But when he indicates the artistic agencies of the
world would be better without censors, it's time he de
fined his terms. For the movie producers, the pub
lishers, and their trained worms are "artistic agencies"
only by errors in classification.
And no one will deny it is chiefly these sources of
"art" the censor bothers. And he bothers them, not only
because they tend to indecency, but because they can
and do reach a mass public.
* * * *
To prove my point: if you have 75 cents, you can
buy free and above board such dubious phonograph
records as the "Hot Mattress Stomp" and others I
haven't the courage to recommend. Records are appar
ently uncensored. And they are uncensored not be
cause they are unable to be dirty, but because few
people have 75 cents to spend on a record.
Thus, in the censorship business, dirt is not the
only variable. More important is, how many people
will the dirt reach? And that's where the oh-so de
hydrated, oh-so objectively evil-smelling censor comes
in.
If he were suddenly i-emoved, Hollywood would not
continue to produce the same number of stinkers, and
a great number of artisticallp valid movies pre
viously withheld because of a sharp sex-angle. We
wouldn't get more sexy "Wintersets" or "Informers,"
but more and more of the bedroom banalities, just as
banal but a little more bouncey, because they pay.
