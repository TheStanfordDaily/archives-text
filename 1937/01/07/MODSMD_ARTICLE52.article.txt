# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
If I can believe my ears, and nose, today starts that
era dear to every woman's heart and pocketbook, the
era of good feeling (or feline), the era of blind man's
buffet, the era when the four-club bid is turned down
by one no-tramp. In short, today starts the first inning
of women's rushing for keeps. No runts, no hicks,
no eras.
For the freshman woman, this day is, of course, of
supreme and extremeline importance . And for them
the whole idea behind their actions should be to Put
Yourself Across. I'll admit that Li/.a, she of the ice
cubes and the bloodhounds, had first patent rights on
this idea; however, the circumstances have somewhat
changed, and it is no longer the hounds but the wolves
that are howling.
For the bayer's aspirants, therefore, I must, per
force, print a few brief words of advice. In order to
put onesself across, one must always act the part of a
lady. Which part, of course, depends on onesself. Some
prefer the neck, but that is all a matter of opinion.
It always is a very delicate matter to decide what to
wear. Some prefer blue dresses, others like red dresses.
The ensemble is never complete, without some sort of
furniture, such as a petite scarf, a cunning purse which
may or may not, contain a sock, a hot. water bottle, a
chesterfield, a Morris chair, and a chest of drawers.
When all is said and done, however, the best thing to
wear from every standpoint is a Packard, Lincoln, or
Cadillac.
One should advance toward the house gently but
firmly scuffing the heels quite sharply to let the hashers
know that they should set an extra place. When once
inside it is not good practice to exhale the breath
sharply and say "PHEW." It is far better to say some
thing light and dainty and ebullient such as "Whee."
When sitting down to the table it is best not to reach
hastily for the celery and olives, but to wait until after
the housemother has said grace, and the national an
them has been sung. During the rest of the meal there
will he no trouble from anybody except the large hasher
with the curly hair, who will try to get a date. Refuse
him the first time.
After the meal is over you will retire to the drawing
room, where the girls will try to draw you out. When
asked for the thirteenth time. "Do you smoke, huh?"
it always is proper to retort with the old Hasher gag:
"No. dearie, I only smoulder."
Following this, it might be a good idea to return
home to Roble and exhale the breath sharply, saying
"Phew," or "Whee if you really prefer it.
