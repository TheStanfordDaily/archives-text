# THE 						REVIEWER
## THE 						GREAT WALTZ at the Curran Theater, San Francisco 
### 
Lovers of the billowy music of the
Johann Strausses will find Max Gor
don's lavish production delightful.
For Strauss waltzes, danced and sung
by ballet and chorus, played by a
30-piece Orchestra eclipse any serious
plot considerations In The Great
Waltz.
Johann Strauss junior wrote the
Blue Danube and most of the waltzes
familiar to us today. When this play
opens, however, Johann junior is a
struggling young composer deprived
of recognition by his successful but
jealous father. He resolves to give up
his music, but all ends well in the
second act with young Strauss lead
ing his father's orchestra in his own
Blue Danube.
Costumes and settings for the pro
duction are beautiful: for one of the
ballet numbers there is an elaborate
display of fireworks and in the clos
ing scene the stage gradually ex
pands to form a fair sized ballroom,
equipped with massive columns and
lighted chandeliers.
The Albertina Rasch ballet was
graceful, the orchestra splendid but
somehow I found an entire evening
of Strauss waltzes a little sugary. By
the way, this ran in Radio City,
Rockefeller Center, for two years.
