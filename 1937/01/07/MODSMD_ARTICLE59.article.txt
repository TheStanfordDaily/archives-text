AN OPEN LETTER to Young and '
Rubicam, Inc., and William Esty and ■
Co., Inc., advertising agents:
Gentlemen: Something has got to !
be done!
It's a crying shame, Messrs. Young |
and Rubicam, that your Mr. Astaire j
should compete on the air-wuves
with Mr. Esty's Mr. Goodman. It j
was bad enough before, you, Mr. Esty, !
revamped your show. Then Astaire, '
in my opinion, had the edge, though 1
a slight one it was. Now it's a dead
heat between the two, and I'm going
frantic racing my dial from one sta- j
tion to another.
So, gentlemen of the two agencies, 1
get together like reasonable human I
beings, please, and remedy the situ- !
ation. Move either one show or the j
other to a different spot.
But listen, fellers, EOR GAWD'S
SAKE, DO SOMETHING!
