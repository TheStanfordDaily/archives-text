# Yale Expenses To Be Slashed
## Teaching Staff Reduced, Classes Enlarged 
### 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (UP).—Yale
University, with an endowment ex
ceeding $80,000,000, has embarked
upon a comprehensive cost cutting
campaign which promises to spare
no effort, in consolidating its re
sources and men in an attempt to re
duce operating expenses to the barest
minimum.
This extensive economy policy has
resulted in a program of retrench
ment designed to eliminate unneces
sary expenses, particularly in de
partments offering experimental
courses that have attracted few stu
dents. Many courses have been elim
inated altogether, especially in high
er arts and classics.
As a result, many of the younger
teachers have lost their positions
and the faculty turnover for the year
has been unusually large. Almost 50
instructors who last year taught in
the graduate school are not now
listed as teaching. In filling these
gaps, the undergraduate school heads
have appointed about 20 men.
Sections have been combined
wherever possible and merged into
large lecture-type courses at the ex
pense of smaller, more informal
classes. The number of courses di
rected by a teacher has also in
creased.
