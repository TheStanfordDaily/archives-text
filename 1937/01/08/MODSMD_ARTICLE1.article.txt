# Janitors To Organize For Clean Sweep
## City Union Leader Will Address Mopsters At Paly Meeting Sunday 
### 
Stanford experienced a few
twinges of pain in its sawdust yes
terday, as the janitors, those philo
sophical gentlemen with the baggy
pants who do the interdepartmental
housewifery in the halls and Quad,
announced that they were definitely
joining in the movement for unioni
zation that has been sweeping the
country lately.
Scheduled for Sunday afternoon
at 1:30 is a meeting of the janitors
in the Union Hall in Palo Alto. To
which, it was predicted, 75 per cent
of the local force of 50 janitors em
ployed by the American Building
Maintenance Corporation would go.
This estimate was confidently
made last night by the janitor lead
ers of the unionization move, who
would not reveal their names for
fear of dismissal.
Speakers Secured
Secured as speaker is Charles
Hardy from the San Francisco Local,
number 87, of the Building Mainte
nance Employees' Union, with
which a local unit would affiliate.
That this announcement would
come openly is a matter of surprise
in the midst of a campaign which
has up to this time been veiled with
secrecy. Organization started some
weeks ago, and, according to the
janitors, was on the initiative of the
local members.
Whether attempts to resist it have
been made or not is the subject only
of campus rumor. John M. Brown,
campus foreman of the A.8.M.C.,
states he has "heard some talk about
it among the boys," but that nothing
was being done to prevent unioni
zation. Reports that Stanford stu
dents would be employed to take the
place of union janitors were denied
by Brown last night.
University Neutral
The University is not involved in
the affair, according to Comptroller
Almon E. Roth, who stated to The
Daily that it was the problem of the
A.8.M.C., which is under contract
to the University to provide jani
torial services. No attempts to thwart
unionization will be made, he said,
pointing out that the University in
its other activities maintains the
Open Shop principle, and does not
discriminate against Union men.
Mr. Roth denied charges that stu
dents would be employed as strike
breakers. However, he said that he
had been investigating for several
years the idea of using some stu
dents in janitorial capacities, but up
to this time had not found many
schools in the East or. any school on
the Coast, except U.C.L.A., where
the plan had worked successfully.
He implied that there would be a
possibility of employing a few stu
dents in the future, but not as strike
breakers.
Gamblers Lose—Jobs
Mr. Roth discredited the idea that
t *io janitors had recently been fired
fc»E union activity. They were fired,
he said, for "playing poker in Toyon
Hall on the A.B.M.C.'s time."
Hie also remarked that any dras
tic increase in cost of janitorial serv
ice tx> the University would only re
sult in an increase in tuition, or a
further lowering of faculty salaries,
which are now affected by a 10 per
cent cut instituted during the de
pression. This is due to the fact
that tbe University is a non-profit
institution, and added costs must be
met within its budget, he pointed
out.
The University would not allow
the closed shop among its own em
ployees, because, he said, a Univer
sity must be allowed to retain a free
hand and cannot have its labor poli
cies the subject of outside dicta
tion.
