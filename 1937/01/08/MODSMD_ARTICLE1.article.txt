# Janitors To Organize For Clean Sweep
## City Union Leader Will Address Mopsters At Paly Meeting Sunday 
### 
Stanford experienced a few
twinges of pain in its sawdust yes
terday, as the janitors, those philo
sophical gentlemen with the baggy
pants who do the interdepartmental
housewifery in the halls and Quad,
announced that they were definitely
joining in the movement for unioni
zation that has been sweeping the
country lately.
Scheduled for Sunday afternoon
at 1:30 is a meeting of the janitors
in the Union Hall in Palo Alto. To
which, it was predicted, 75 per cent
of the local force of 50 janitors em
ployed by the American Building
Maintenance Corporation would go.
This estimate was confidently
made last night by the janitor lead
ers of the unionization move, who
would not reveal their names for
fear of dismissal.
Speakers Secured
Secured as speaker is Charles
Hardy from the San Francisco Local,
number 87, of the Building Mainte
nance Employees' Union, with
which a local unit would affiliate.
That this announcement would
come openly is a matter of surprise
in the midst of a campaign which
has up to this time been veiled with
secrecy. Organization started some
weeks ago, and, according to the
janitors, was on the initiative of the
local members.
Whether attempts to resist it have
been made or not is the subject only
of campus rumor. John M. Brown,
campus foreman of the A.8.M.C.,
states he has "heard some talk about
it among the boys," but that nothing
was being done to prevent unioni
zation. Reports that Stanford stu
dents would be employed to take the
place of union janitors were denied
by Brown last night.
University Neutral
The University is not involved in
the affair, according to Comptroller
Almon E. Roth, who stated to The
Daily that it was the problem of the
A.8.M.C., which is under contract
to the University to provide jani
torial services. No attempts to thwart
unionization will be made, he said,
