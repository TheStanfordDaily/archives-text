# Wilbur Would Brown King Queen Contest
## Big-Shots Approve Plan To End Annual Graft 
### DAVE LEFF 
Stanford luminaries yesterday ad
justed their big-wigs and declared
against the king-queen contest as it
has been known.
General opinion criticized the arti
ficial connection between a Conva
lescent Home drive arid a popularity
election.
"Never thought much of kings and
queens anyway," said President Wil
bur. "Let's drown the contest; it's
been a disgrace to the University for
the past 5000 years. Four thousand
Stanford students should be able to
think up an honorable, interesting,
and effective means of aiding the
Convalescent Home. Of course," he
added, "if the charity fund is all that
matters, why not steal the money
and be done with it?"
Purpose Good
"You can't buy popularity," aver
red Dean George Culver. "The pur
pose of the king-queen contest is a
fine one, but the method of choosing
must be improved."
While Dean of Women Mary Yost
was unavailable last night, her sec
retary said Miss Yost had stated that
she thought the king-queen affair
was a closed issue, and that she
would be unable to make a further
statement without being fully aware
of the situation.
Dirty Work
Speaking from her experience as
a committee member on last year's
election board, Quad editor Ruth
Barnes spoke directly. "If you want
to make money," said she, "there
has to be dirty work somewhere.
When the contest involves money,
the most popular person cannot be
elected. The king - queen contest
should be divorced from the Con
valescent Home drive. For that mat
ter, the Masque Ball could do with
out rulers."
"How about a 'We're-the-richest
boy-and-girl-on-t he-campus 'con
test?" drawled Gilman Gist, editor
of Chaparral and president of Ham
mer and Coffin Society. "Winners
of this," he added, "could submerge
their personalities, if any, in a
golden aura of wealth.
