# Plans for Youth Act Discussed
## Delegates Prepare For Assembly in City 
### W. A. MILLIS 
"We have a bigger job than we ex
pected," said Dewey Anderson, ex
state legislator from Palo Alto, at
last night's promotional meeting for
the California Youth Act, held in the
Women's Clubhouse.
"It will probably take five years
and three sessions of the legislature,"
Anderson predicted, "before we can
achieve the passage of a complete
and adequate California Youth Act."
Meanwhile, Anderson urged that the
coming Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco sessions of the California As
sembly of Youth formulate a reason
able and practical measure which
could be favorably considered by the
state legislature.
National Act Needed
Second speaker at the meeting,
which about 25 students attended and
which was presided over by Miss
Elizabeth Lam, local Y.W.C.A. secre
tary, was Mrs. Claudia Williams, of
the San Francisco "Y." Mrs. Wil
liams, who has lead in the movement
for a California youth bill since the
tentative act was drafted a year ago,
pointed out that the California Youth
Act would attempt, "to do something
about, the problem of security for
youth."
She emphasized that the problem
of youth security is a national prob
lem, and that it can effectively be
solved only by the federal govern
ment. The state act, she said, "will
not solve the whole problem. It will
take care of the most immediate
emergency needs of young people."
