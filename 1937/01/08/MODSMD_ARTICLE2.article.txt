# Faculty-Students' Club Organized
## 
### 
Formation of a student-faculty
luncheon club, to meet each Wednes
day in the Women's Clubhouse, was
announced today by Dr. D. Elton
Trueblood, chaplain of Stanford's
Memorial Church. At the present
time, Dr. Trueblood thinks, "there is
not. sufficient opportunity for stu
dents to meet, in a friendly manner,
distinguished visitors to the campus."
The luncheon club, he says, will at
tempt to provide an opportunity for
such contacts.
Speaker for the first session of the
club, which will meet in the lounge
room of the Women's Clubhouse at
12:15 next. Wednesday noon, will be
Dr. Rufus M. Jones, of Haverford
College. Topic of Dr. Jones' speech
will be "Finding the Life Clue."
Although undergraduate students
are invited to join the luncheon club,
Dr. Trueblood stresses that "the
club has particularly been organ
ized for mature students of the
graduate level." In the near future,
Dr. Trueblood hopes that two ses
sions of the club can be held, one for
graduate and the other for under
graduate students. Cost of the lunch
eon will be kept at a minimum, Dr.
Trueblood promises.
