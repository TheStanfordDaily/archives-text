# Old Film Stars 'Divine Sarah'
## Classic Flicks Shown In Movie History Course 
### 
Madam Sarah Bernhardt, "the di
vine Sarah," made an ass of herself
in the Assembly Hall last night.
"This is my one chance of immor
tality," she is said to have exclaimed
when Adolph Zukor first asked her
to appear, back in 1912, in a cinema
version of "Queen Elizabeth."
Well, students of Dan Mendelow
itz' new motion picture class saw
Sarah in all her immortality last
night. And she qualified for a first
class Hal Roach comedienne. Good
shot: when, after self-poisoning, she
falls face-forward on a pile of pil
lows.
Wrong Attitude
But of course that is the wrong at
titude to take. Back in 1912, "Queen
Elizabeth" was a masterpiece. It was
a great step forward in cinematic
history. Madam Bernhardt's appear
ance did much to diminish the con
temporary prejudice against motion
pictures.
The acting, naturally, seems funny
to 1937 audiences. It is play acting
of the time, definitely not in the
present dramatic tradition of the
cinema. Statuesque and pantomimic,
the cast shows quite definitely that it
had not learned the acting technique
of the films.
"Moon Trip" (iay
"A Trip to the Moon," another of
the six features screened last night,
was produced in 1902 by George
Melies, an imaginative Frenchman
who did much to further early film
art. It. tells, against quaint painted
backcloths and stylized props, the
story of an early rocket flight to the
moon and the wonders thereof. In
tentionally humorous, Melies "Trip"
i* decidedly charming and gay.
"The Execution of Mary Queen of
Scots," made in 189.'5, took about as
long to see as to pronounce. Off
bounced her head and that was all.
A youngster upset a washtub to form,
in "Wash Day Troubles," one of the
screen's first comic incidents.
Projectioner Amiss
The films themselves were sur
prisingly bright and clear, but the
projectioner didn't have his machine
adjusted at quite the right speed.
But perhaps screening difficulties ex
perienced last night were appropriate
to the occasion.
Next week we will see the first
imortant movie kiss—in 50 feet of
film.

"The Execution of Mary Queen of
Scots," made in 189.'5, took about as
long to see as to pronounce. Off
bounced her head and that was all.

Projectioner Amiss
The films themselves were sur
prisingly bright and clear, but the
projectioner didn't have his machine
adjusted at quite the right speed.
But perhaps screening difficulties ex
perienced last night were appropriate
to the occasion.
Next week we will see the first

Madam Sarah Bernhardt, "the di
vine Sarah," made an ass of herself
in the Assembly Hall last night.
"This is my one chance of immor
tality," she is said to have exclaimed
when Adolph Zukor first asked her
to appear, back in 1912, in a cinema
version of "Queen Elizabeth."
Well, students of Dan Mendelow
itz' new motion picture class saw
Sarah in all her immortality last
night. And she qualified for a first
class Hal Roach comedienne. Good
shot: when, after self-poisoning, she
falls face-forward on a pile of pil
lows.
Wrong Attitude
But of course that is the wrong at
titude to take. Back in 1912, "Queen
Elizabeth" was a masterpiece. It was
a great step forward in cinematic
history. Madam Bernhardt's appear
ance did much to diminish the con
temporary prejudice against motion
pictures.
The acting, naturally, seems funny
to 1937 audiences. It is play acting
of the time, definitely not in the
present dramatic tradition of the
cinema. Statuesque and pantomimic,
the cast shows quite definitely that it
had not learned the acting technique
of the films.
"Moon Trip" (iay
"A Trip to the Moon," another of
the six features screened last night,
was produced in 1902 by George
Melies, an imaginative Frenchman
who did much to further early film
art. It. tells, against quaint painted
backcloths and stylized props, the
story of an early rocket flight to the
moon and the wonders thereof. In
tentionally humorous, Melies "Trip"
i* decidedly charming and gay.
