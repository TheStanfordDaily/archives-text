# Rally Planned To Greet Victorious Squad Tomorrow
## Band Will Lead Parade Back to Campus After Meeting 10:30 Train 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Welcoming the sensationally suc
cessful Card basketball team back
rom its eastern campaign, a big rally
followed by a serpentine and car pa
rade from the Paly station to the
campus will be held at 10:30 o'clock
tomorrow morning.
Yell Leader Webb Jones and his
assistants will be present to conduct
the rally, and the band is expected to
lead the serpentine back to the cam
pus. Campaigning members of the
rally committee under Chairman T.
M. McDaniel will arouse interest in
the event by driving around to the
different living groups, making an
nouncements, and supplying trans
portation to the depot. Each mem
ber has been made responsible for
two or three groups, and a big crowd
is expected promptly at 10:30.
Victory Record
The high-light of the Stanford
hoopsters blazing trek across the
country was their victory over Long
Island University, conceded national
champions for this year by most
sports writers. The L.I.U. quintet
was national collegiate champion,
and won the N.C.A.A. last year, and
was undefeated in 43 straight games
until it was trounced by the Indian
team, 45-31.
Canisius, a school that receives no
recognition in football but consistent
ly turns out one of the leading east
ern hoop teams, was the next victim
of Coach John Bunn's crack cagers.
Temple, one of the leading schools in
the East, Warrensburg, Western Re
serve, Hamline, and Montana offered
little difficulty to the Cards.
Conference Opening
Probably only three days will be
used by Coach Bunn for the last
momentum-gathering drive before
the conference opening basketball
games with U.C.L.A. in the Pavilion
a week from tonight and tomorrow
night, as the team goes through the
last brushing-up spasms.
The travel-weary hoopsters most
likely will have a lay-off from work
outs over Sunday, resuming Monday
through Wednesday, and then have
Thursday afternoon off to rest for
the Friday night tilt. Since the team
has had seven games of competition
over the holidays, Coach Bunn will
primarily have to worry over tech
nique, rather than condition.
Last year's conference champs are
e::pccted to make an ace-high show
ing by many bleacher coaches this
year, so Saturday's rally will lie in
the nature of a send-olf for the start
of a successful season as well as a
killing of the fatted calf for the re
turn of Stanford's victorious sons.
