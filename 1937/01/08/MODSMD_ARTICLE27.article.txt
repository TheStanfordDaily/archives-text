It should be apparent -by now that
conversation during rushing isn't
what it used to be. In short, none
of the current Hock of rushees have
ever taken citizenship, and none of
the upper classmen have muddled
through western civilization, which,
from various reports, seems to be not
quite the farce that citizenship was.
That makes the rushees and rushers
practically incommunicado.
* ♦ »✓
The trouble with citizenship was
that it was just too perfect. The lec
tures were planted to be profound
and reeking with erudition, the read
ings covered practically the totality
of human knowledge. But there was
a slip between the cup and the lip
somewhere, for the lectures turned
out to be poisonously dull and com
pletely uncorrected, tiie instructors
were youngsters who were on the
whole more interested in the class i
telling teacher what teacher said'
than in the students getthig ideas of
their own.
Even then, though, citizenship had |
a use or two. For one thing, it turned :
the freshman class into a ' gang of |
Machiavellis who in short order
learned that honesty was not always
best policy when it came to branding
in reading notes and that it was a
lot easier to write about fiction- than
fact in examinations. But moreithan!
that, of all the courses in a
that is dominated by the status-qvuo
ism of the business school, it vas
one of the few which cast a critical ;
eye on our American system thk*t'
Hearst loves so dearly. There is n\o !
longer any real treatment of Marxi.stt
economics. .
To this the economics professor
would no doubt reply that Marx is
given his share of attention in more
than one economics course. But the ,
treatment is very piecemeal and even j
in the political science courses you |
are not taught about him but rather
find out about him for yourself.

Now all of what I have said is not j
:i cry for workers of Stanford to J
jnite, but rather so many words de- !
.igned to point out that the easiestj
A'ay to find ,out what is rotten in
America is to approach things from J
a mild, Marxast down-with-every- !
thing attitude.' A fine idea would be
to get some puofesesor who was thor- ,
oughly fired up wfch the spirit of the ,
coming revolution and let him spend j
his time at nothing but preaching j
dialectical materialism.
He would be just tho man to think
of something to say when Garver &
Hansen's ununderstancfable, stodgy
textbook remarks that .uobody has ,
been able to reconstruct the labor
theory of value since soith? Austrian
economist was supposed to have
knocked it to pieces in 1894.
* * *
At any rate, having some of the
>nemy camped right at their door
step on the second floor should fur- ,
ilsh some excitement for the present
oatch of economics instructors who
ire aroused only if somebody figures j
out what the examination questions j
are driving at. Having a red in their

class average curve.

It should be apparent -by now that
conversation during rushing isn't
what it used to be. In short, none
of the current Hock of rushees have
ever taken citizenship, and none of
the upper classmen have muddled
through western civilization, which,
from various reports, seems to be not
quite the farce that citizenship was.
That makes the rushees and rushers
practically incommunicado.

The trouble with citizenship was
that it was just too perfect. The lec
tures were planted to be profound
and reeking with erudition, the read
ings covered practically the totality
of human knowledge. But there was
a slip between the cup and the lip
somewhere, for the lectures turned
out to be poisonously dull and com
pletely uncorrected, tiie instructors
were youngsters who were on the
whole more interested in the class i
telling teacher what teacher said'
than in the students getthig ideas of
their own.
Even then, though, citizenship had |
a use or two. For one thing, it turned :
the freshman class into a ' gang of |
Machiavellis who in short order
learned that honesty was not always
best policy when it came to branding
in reading notes and that it was a
lot easier to write about fiction- than
fact in examinations. But moreithan!
that, of all the courses in a
that is dominated by the status-qvuo
ism of the business school, it vas
one of the few which cast a critical ;
eye on our American system thk*t'
Hearst loves so dearly. There is n\o !
longer any real treatment of Marxi.stt
economics. .
To this the economics professor
would no doubt reply that Marx is
given his share of attention in more
than one economics course. But the ,
treatment is very piecemeal and even j
in the political science courses you |
are not taught about him but rather
find out about him for yourself.

Now all of what I have said is not j
:i cry for workers of Stanford to J
jnite, but rather so many words de- !
.igned to point out that the easiestj
A'ay to find ,out what is rotten in
America is to approach things from J
a mild, Marxast down-with-every- !

to get some puofesesor who was thor- ,
oughly fired up wfch the spirit of the ,
