# Rushing Opens As Sleepless Nights Begin For Frosh
## Encinamen Go Row Today for Intensive Sessions of Final Period 
### 
While more than 300 frosh are
spending sleepless nights and using
innumerable brain cells pondering
over the relative merits of various
Greeks, the 24 fraternities hasten
preparations for the final week of
hunting, season of 1936-37.
Rushing, standard style, continues
today and tomorrow with the usual
three periods available today and two
Saturday. Next Tuesday, Wednes
day, and Thursday the final rushing
dates will be available with lunch
and dinner engagements possible on
each day.
Thursday dinner will be the pre
ferred meal, at which the rushers and

rushees mutually indicate their
choice.
Friday night the Interfraternity
Council Pledge Dance, an informal,
will be held in the Women's Gym
and the Dance Studio. Ralph Hunts
berger is chairman in charge of the
affair.
Meanwhile, as some houses sit
back with the smug and complacent
satisfaction of a filled class of "nug
gets," those on the Row who cheated
more fairly frantically dive into the
alumni sock to get the wherewithal
to tender initiation fees, more hash
ing jobs, and bigger and better room
rent, in order to gratify the whimsies
of businesslike and already over
bribed frosh.
Bob Hoover of the Interfraternity
Council issues warning to both
houses and rushees that although no
violation has been reported as yet,
there have been rumors that illegal
rushing has taken place, and any
violation discovered will result in
penalties to houses and freshmen
taking part. During the silent period
from 8 p.m. Thursday until pledging
Friday, no contact of any kind, in
cluding the informal meetings out
side of Encina, may take place.
