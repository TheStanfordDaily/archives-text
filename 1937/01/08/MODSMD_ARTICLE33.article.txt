CLOSE QUARTERS?
JUST WAIT!

Believe it or not, A1 Masters and
his staff have been sweating blood of
anxiety a.s the 1937 basketball season j
approaches. A queer thing, but he j
and Jake Irwin and Miss du Prau |
and the rest have their headaches as
a direct function of how good the
basketball happens to be.
The rest of us walk around happy
that we have a team in the first di
vision, but don't stop to think that
the better the hoop team succeeds,
the more people will want to see it,
and there wasn't room for the people
who wanted to come to the Pavilion
last year, nor enough knee room for
those who did come. And that was
last year, before Coach Bunn's boys
got their reputation.
This year the emergency is really
being attacked from all sides. Where
formerly there were some 300 comps
being given to the B.A.C. staff—
coaches, groundsmen, etc., exclusive
of the batch that goes to ihe varsity
itself—Masters has now cut down to
the bone.
The only comps to be distributed
this year will be to a limited press
section, and to persons actually
working the game—Liebendorfer on
the press section and KQW, Irwin as
general roustabout in charge, Pro
fessor Grant on the time clock, Mas
ters and Miss du Prau on the ticket
money, Manager Walt Vincenti and
a few boys on the towels, the refer
ees, police, coaches, and opposing
teams.
The students, as announced today,
will have to secure special tickets a
week before the game, either at cost
or not, as the case may be, in order
that the allotment of seats for student
body admission can be made in am
ple time to provide for an alumni or
public sale of what seat space might
remain.
The Pavilion holds 2700 as de
signed, but with a little less knee
room and closer packing around the
aisles and corners, the capacity can
be shoved out to just under 3000.
There are said to be 3700 students at
Stanford this quarter, and giving a
good portion over to dryballs and
Del Monte expeditions, it is doubtful
if the student body alone would take
up the whole building.
But with invited friends, and the
above mentioned outsiders, the space
left over will be mighty small, and
must be calculated to the hair.
Showing of A.S.S.U. cards will un
doubtedly be required in addition to

the new special tickets, to bring the
popularity of scalping tickets, which
is going to be quite a trade this year,
down close to where it should be.

THE EASTERN SCRIBES
WERE IMPRESSED

The reports from New York cover
ing the Long Island U. game are now
coming in full blast. Says the New
York Times:
"Keenly disappointed, but offering
no alibi for their defeat, the Long
Islanders are determined to make
their remaining 20 opponents pay for
the setback.
"The Blackbirds were unanimous
in their praise of the Stanford team
and particularly admired their nat
ural style of play and highly devel
oped one-hand shooting accuracy. In
their opinion nothing like it has been
seen in the East before and they be
lieve that Eastern teams would be
greatly influenced by that type of
play and basketball in general would
beziefit.
"While many who witnessed the
contest believed that L.I.U. had an
"ofl'night," the players themselves
considered Stanford the best team
they ever played . . . The defeat by
Stanford was the fourth sustained by
the Blackbirds since 1933, when they
first sprang into prominence. Since
that time they played 90 games and
had one undefeated season, one of
one defeat and one of two losses."
I don't think any of us realize
what an important sport basketball is
in the East, and how shocked the citi
zens were when a mere Pacific Coast
champion knocked off their acknowl
edged cream. From the number of
clippings I have seen, hundreds of
columnists must have had something
to say. Calling Stanford "big 'and
happy-go-lucky," Irving Marsh
writes in the New York Herald-
Tribune:
"It is just as well for the Black
birds that they were knocked off
their lofty perch by so skilled, spir
ited, and capable an organization as
the Pacific Coast Confei'ence cham
pions. L.I.U. suffered no disgrace,
no loss of prestige in bowing to the
superior play of the Cardinals . . .
"Stanford plays an entirely differ
ent type of game than that prevalent
in this section, but there can be no
gainsaying its effectiveness. It is
based on the soundest of fundamen
tals and stresses straightforward
speech, accurate passing and close
range shooting to the exclusion of
the tricks and guile so prominent in
the New York mode ..."
