# Frosh Cagers Make Debut Tonight at 7:30
## Poly High Basketballers To Furnish Opposition For Gorter's Squad 
### HARRY PRESS 
Tonight in the Pavilion at 7:30
Stanford basketball fans will have
their first chance to see the Class of
'40's fast-moving hoop squad, when
Coach Wytze Gorter sends his frosh
proteges out onto the hardwood for
their opening game of the season
against the Parrots of Polytechnic j
High. Saturday night the yearlings ;
meet the Palo Alto High Vikings.
The Encina boys feature a fast- I
passing game which, when utilized to |
its full extent by the speedy first |
team, has given the second and third
strings many bad cases of jitters try- j
ing to keep up with the ball.
"Hawkeye" Lafaille
Leon Lafaille, ably holding down
one of the forward spots, uses his
hawkeyes to break up dribbles as
though he were picking up a free
ball. The same eyes enable him to
plunk the casaba through the hoop
with consistent accuracy anyplace
within a 20-foot radius of the bucket.
Ted Lyon, his running mate up front,
has the ability to flip the ball around
in any direction, making it go where
he wants it to, without bothering to
look in that direction.
Center Tom Siebert is invaluable
under the basket, especially for fol
low shots. At guards are Andy An
derson and Gil Rahn. Anderson
shows up best in taking the ball off
the backboard, following an oppon
ent's shot. His ability to get off the
floor comes in very handy under the
basket. Rahn, who hasn't been out
for practice very long, hails from
Milwaukee. Starting fast breaks
with bullet passes or tricky dribbles
is his specialty.
Team Over Six Feet
The starting team will average 6
feet, 2 and a quarter inches, which
is really up in the air. Siebert pierces
the ozone 6-6 Vi; Anderson comes
next with 6-4; Lyon stands 6-2;
Lafaille hits exactly 6 feet ;and Rahn
measures 5-11.
Polytechnic High, with the excep
tion of one man, will line up with ex
actly the same team which last year,
as 130-pounders, won 23 consecutive
games and the city title. Coach Gor
don Carlson of the Parrots has a
team which, although small, plays a
very fast game.
Vikings Play Saturday
The game Satuixlay night will be
with the Vikings of Palo Alto High,
coached by Howard Ray. Dogged by
hard luck, the Norsemen have lost
four games so far this season, one by
a mere one-point margin, and the
other three by two points. Although
their shooting eyes have been a wee
bit dim, the Vikes have a practically
air-tight defense which might offer
some trouble to the frosh sharpshoot
ers.
This is Mentor Gorter's first year
as basketball coach. He played on
John Bunn's hoop teams in '33 and
'34, after entering as a junior trans
fer.
Starting line-ups for tonight's
game, which is free, follow:
Frosh Polytechnic
Lafaille f McMahon
Lyon f O'Donnell
Siebert . c Roy
Anderson g Derian
Rahn g Kirsh
Tomorrow night, the frosh will line
up the same way, while Palo Alto

Nielson at forwards; Steers at cen
ter; Stone and Norberg at guards.
