# The 						Seven Year Hitch
## 
### 
Like the famed seven-year famines of Joseph
and his eleven brothers, Stanford students un
der the present quarterly plan get .long Christ
mas vacations only every seven years.
Under a ruling made several years ago by
the Academic Council and approved by the
Board of Trustees, registration for autumn quar
ter should begin on the first Monday after Sep
tember 22. Thus in 1935, Registration day was
September 23, the earliest it will be for another
seven years.
As a quarter must contain a minimum of 10
weeks of academic study, students rejoiced the
Christmas of '35 that they were to have an
all-time high of 20 days' vacation to eat, sleep,
drink, and revel in the Rose Bowl. More people
from the East were able to go home for the
holidays. They were able to make their trip
worth while and still be able to return in time
to register on the opening day of winter quarter.
But this year, the first Monday after the 22nd
of September did not turn up until the 28th,
and hence nearly a week v/as cut off of the
Christmas vacation. Students who live far
away were not able to get home in time to make
a visit before it was time for them to return for
registration.
This past Christmas vacation was the longest
one, except for that of a year ago, since 1931.
And in this constant - speed planetarium in
which we live, move, and have our being, it
won't be until 1942 that there will be that three
week intermission between autumn and winter
quarters.
That the academic council should move the
opening date of the University to earlier in
September is the cry of the visiiing populace
from north and east of the slate line. Before
next autumn's time schedules are printed, let
the winds of freedom blow a new regulation
into the academic council's book of rules that
will give three weeks at Christmas time six
years out of seven.
