# Money Roots for Dear Old Evil
## 
### 
The Daily still waits for some philanthropist
to step forward and donate the prize money for
a King and Queen Contest desmellerator.
As soon as the prize money comes in, The
Daily will conduct a contest, whose purpose is
to find a way that will make the Masque Ball
regal ream naughty but nice.
It was established last year by officials of
the Convalescent Home that the Home, although
it can use all the money it gets, can get along
without the King and Queen Contest money,
if that contest has a deleterious effect on Stan
ford.
Of course, the old contest was carried on in
the name of charity, and that was the thing that
brought out a lot of the money, and lent a sanc
tion to some of the subtler practices. To charge
actual "graft and corruption" to the contest is
an unfortunate overstatement. Still, there is
something of the unsavory that lingers, when
it is remembered the ridiculous lengths to which
some of the overzealous patriots went in trying
to raise money.
It is true that some of the equalization of
wealth that went on was rather wholesome and
that many of those who pungled heavily could
well afford to indulge their whimsy, yet there
were such things as compulsory levies and
pressures brought to bear on people who could
not afford it. And when the whole operation is
stripped of its tinsel and glitter it betrays a
prelty thin motivation for charitable acts, and
a pretty thick appeal for the destruction of such
long-cherished, if little used, ideals as Stanford
democracy. That is v/hy we don't want the old
one back.
Why we want another one is another matter.
