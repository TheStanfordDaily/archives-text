# Things Have Come to a Pretty Passes

### 
B.A.C. gravy will be thinned out to soup
kitchen specifications during the basketball
season when Don Liebendorfer, dispenser of
passes, eliminates the B.A.C. comp list of about
300 passes.
Up to this year, B.A.C. employees and their
families have had passes to the games, but be
cause the Basketball Pavilion seats only 2700
and there are nearly 3800 students in the Uni
versity and because innumerable alumni are
willing to pay across the board for full admis
sions, B.A.C. satellites will also stand in line at
the general admission window to get their
tickets.
This season, the pass list will be composed
of only those who will be actively working on
the nights of the games. This will include Grad
uate Manager Masters, Liebendorfer, two or
three other B.A.C. luminaries, representatives
of the San Francisco and Peninsula press, and
wire service sports writers.
If Mrs. Masters, Mrs. Liebendorfer, Mr. Thorn
hill want to see the game they must also buy
tickets. Mr. Masters will be able to buy only

one ticket for his wife, and so on down the line
of former pass-holders.
B.A.C. legislation which will directly affect
the student body comes in the form of a ruling
requiring all students who wish to see all the
basketball games this year to call at the B.A.C.
office with their student body cards and secure
free rooters' tickets on the Monday and Tuesday
preceding the week-end games. No student will
be admitted on the night of the games with only
his student body card.
With all of these measures, the B.A.C. hopes
to capitalize on gate receipts to the fullest extent
from Stanford's potential championship basket
ball team. With no Rose Bowl game to garnish
the annual budget, Masters looks for more paid
admissions to keep the B.A.C. pot full—even
if the gravy will be thinner.
