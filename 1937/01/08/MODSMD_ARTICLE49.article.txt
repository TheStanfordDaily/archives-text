WEATHER UNSETTLED
There is no joy at Mollville. There has been no joy
at Mollville. There will be no joy at Mollville—until
a week from Saturday night. And that joy can be
duplicated anywhere by merely taking off tight shoes.
Mollville, dear people, is not a gangster's harem, but
Roble Hall. Sources close to the mascara cans indicate
General Sherman would have called it Roble Hell. He
would, our agents inform us, have marched through
Georgia for a rest if he had first fought the Battle of
the Bids.
* * * *
It will become increasingly hellish as freshman women
who don't know Row women, will tear hair for the
privilege of strange room-mates, house-bills, and a
quick tumble up the social ladder.
A week from Saturday night, Satan will turn in his
chips. Mrs. Diekema will call certain gals to the office,
there gently break the news that they weren't bid, and
install a rubber lapel. Others will sit in Roble's plush
lined purgatories until a sponsor hands them a little
card, which will simper in typewriter 12-point that,
my dear, we'd like to have you, darling.
* * * *
In either case, Roble gals will then have taken off
social shoes too small for their social feet, and the joy
so obtained will be expressed in tears, complacent
grins, or old-fashioned hysterics.
They were forced to wear such shoes for almost
four months to be "oriented." The idea was, you
couldn't want to pledge a house without knowing the
girls. So you have four months to become acquainted.
Except that you can't become acquainted, because
sorority gals would have their eyes gouged out if
they were seen with you in the same car, hotel, jail,
boat, prison, detention home, party, or emergency hos
pital.
You can't meet them at the official teas, because
they aren't teas but duels.
But you still have four months to suffer, for no rea
son than because there's no reason not to suffer.
* *
Some day, when we have smashed our mental radia
tors on the millenium, some one will put women's rush
ing on a sane basis.
He will look at rushing as Newton looked at the
apple. He will say. "Here are a lot of girls who Want to
make houses. Here are a lot of houses who want to have
girls. So the houses will ask the girls whether they
want to join. The girl will say either 'yes.' or 'no'."
Only one person I know could do it. His name is
God. *
