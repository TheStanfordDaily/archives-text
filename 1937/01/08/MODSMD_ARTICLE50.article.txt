# OUR HASHER

Too many people have written poems about what a
wee, cowering, timorous beastie the mouse is and not
enough people have devoted their time to cheering up
bored and bowed correctors, who have to go through
their period of golden youth, classifying humanity in
numbers of 0 to 100, and A. B, C, D, or F. It is, there
fore, a hopeful sign that in one class last quarter,
several enterprising members organized the class to
inject a little punch into their rhapsody in blue books.
The professor announced that the final would have
five questions, of which the class was to answer four.
So, on the extra question, the altruistic students, eager
to spread cheer to the downtrodden, wrote on the odd
question: "Sorry, corrector, I cant answer thisâ€”lt's
Town Hall, Tonight."
Some profs have smart kids, who after four years of
terrorizing Paly Hi, come to Stanford and on these cold
mornings ride up and down the Row in an open road
ster dressed in polo shirts. Other profs have smart
kids, who do such phenomenal things as get A's in
Business Law and read the Annals of the American
Academy of Whatnot and Whatnot in order to laugh
at the gags.
One of the latter type blazed a rather meteoric trail
through every department in school, until he came to
his father's, which was Econ. Then, in Econ 1, our hero
met a hitch . First came a C, followed immediately by
a D. which was in turn thunderously seconded by an F.
The student chanced to meet the professor and the
subject happened to come up, the way those things
manage to do.
"How does it happen," said the professor, "that
you'vp been getting these low grades."
"Well," said the smart son, "I just can't bring my
self to answer these questions the way Garver and
Hansen want me to. because I know they're wrong, so
I spend my time showing the fallacies of their elec
ticism."
"f can see your point," said the economist, "hut you
must realize that many of our instructors aren't very
apt, and probably miss your point."
"I had thought of that," said the econmics scion
dreamily, "but it didn't appear to me to be very fair to
the other students."
This closed the incident.
