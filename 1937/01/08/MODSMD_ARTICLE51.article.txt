### (Clipped by Phil Bernheim 
ONCE UPON A TIME there was a
guy around here by the name of
Winstead Weaver. (Period.) Weav
er is now in Hollywood. In fact, he
is in pictures. His biggest role, so
far, has been to stand around and
hold a horse. But bigger things are
in store for our Winstead. He has an
engagement at present with Radio
Pictures. He is supposed to be
booked with various companies for
six months. Sort of reminds us of
Fred Allen's crack, "I have a 30-
minute contract with 10-minute op
tions."
IDOLS DIE HARD: Feminine
members of the motion picture
course gave forth a great sigh the
other day when Instructor Mendel
owitz told them they would see
'Monsieu Beaucaire' with Rudolph
Valentino."
TRIVIA: Checkci-s is an intramural
sport at University of Georgia . . .
Gower and Jean, the clever young
dance team formerly at the St. Fran
cis, are playing big time at the Drake,
Chicago . . . Penn State's Froth, I
find, is much funnier than Chap
arral: it's dirtier.
FOR SUSAN: A University of
lowa frosh wanted a date for a
dance, so he put a want ad in The
Daily lowan. Twenty co-eds an
swered. (Try a Daily want-ad. —
Promotion Manager.)
HOW MARVELOUSLY SUPERB
are those Saturday night Chicago
symphony broadcasts over the new
Mutual network! The orchestra is
brilliant, the pick-up technically
awless, and the programs delightful.
Congratulations and superlatives are
decidedly in order for the staff of
WGN. Truly magnificent.
PREDICTION: That "Easy to
Love" will outlive momentary popu
larity to join "Stardust," "Getting
Sentimental," and "Night and Day"
as a classic of popular music.
