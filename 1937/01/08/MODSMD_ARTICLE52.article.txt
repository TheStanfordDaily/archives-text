The Editor, Sir:
It has been reported down this way
that Stanford students are picketing
certain theaters in protest of double
feature programs.
If this be so, I would greatly ap
preciate a few details for my column
—such heroes deserve recognition.
Exhibitors don't seem to pay any at
tention to the coast-to-coast com
ments of film critics when it comes to
this situation, but if the free-spend
ing boys from the campus take up
the touch maybe we'll get some
where.
