"THREE MEN ON A HORSE," at the
Stanford Theater
I didn't see the original stage ver
sion of "Three Men on a Horse" but
I don't imagine it could be much
funnier than the cinema which is
currently rocking the Stanford The
ater's screen.
Frank McHugh—but not the ordi
narily smart-cracking Frank Mc-
Hugh — writes Mother's Day and
Christmas card rimes for a living,
rides the bus to work every morning
doping out the horse races for his
own amusement. "Every night he
rides home again with the satisfac
tion that his guesses were right. But
he never bets. That, he thinks, would
break the spell.
But three professional speculators
(Allen Jenkins, and two of the stage
cast, Teddy Hart and Sam Levine)
get ahold of him, fill and refill him
with liquor, then proceed to use his
talents to their own ends. The re
sults are of the funniest sort. Joan
Blondell, as the ex-burlesque strip
per, handles the part remarkably
well—but little Cantor-eyed Hart,
cigared and derbied, is worth the
price of the entire show.
"THEODORA GOES WILD," at the
Mayfield Theater
Living up to its reputation for
turning film stars inside out, Colum
bia has done that very thing to Irene
Dunne in "Theodora Goes Wild." In
characteristic Columbian fashion, she
has been literally dipped in whimsy.
"Theodora Goes Wild" is a female
"Mr. Deeds." Irene Dunne, like Gary
Cooper, is a small towner who comes
innocently to the big city—and goes
wild. You wouldn't believe that
magnificent-obsessioned Miss Dunne
could be such a little madcap.
