# Engineers Refuse Palo Alto Request
## 
### 
Army engineers have refused Palo
Alto's request for harbor improve
ments, which would involve the
dredging of a 14.000-foot channel
leading to the main San Francisco
Bay channel.
Palo Alto had asked for a survey
of the project, contending that this
would benefit yachting and commer
cial interests.
