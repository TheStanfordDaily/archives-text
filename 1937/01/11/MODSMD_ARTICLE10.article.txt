# These People Once Went To Stanford
## 
### WILLIAM BRETT 
r JpIEY went to Stanford, these peo
ple. Most of them graduated, yet
their names never appeared in the !
Bawl-Out, and you won't find them
on the alumni rolls.
Take Eddie Brunner, '29. His car
toons, with their funny, short legged j
and pop-eyed men, used to be one of j
the best features of the Chaparral. |
Eddie was pretty popular. He had a j
fairly decent allowance and Packard
phaeton, so he practically had his
pick of the second-string contingent
of the IiOO.
After he graduated Eddie went to
New York. For a while he nearly
starved, but then, through the aid of j
a classmate of his, he got a job doing j
illustrations for advertisements of
college movies. He is one of the few
artists in New York or Hollywood |
who can draw a co-ed that looks like i
a co-ed. not like a chorine.
But Eddie's chief claim to fame is,
or rather was, his friendship (all the ,
more remarkable because platonic) i
with Gloria Wandrous, the glamor- ,
ous "speak-easy girl," whose myste- |
rious death in 1932 kept the tabloids' j
circulations boosting for weeks.
Of Course You Remember
Of course everyone at Stanford re
members Brenda Chalis. Along about i
the middle of last Spring quarter this 1
beautiful and immoral young heiress]
discovered that because she had cut <
too many classes and flunked so many |
exes, she was not going to graduate in !
June. So she went to the Dean with i
a list of 22 names. All of the names
were well known on the campus. |
Most of them were important men in j
the Class of '36, and the rest were j
juniors, a couple of instructors, and j
an athletic coach.
After every name was a date from I
the past college year, sometimes two. |
If. Brenda informed the authorities,
they did not immediately say she
could graduate, she would have the
list mimeographed, and a copy past
ed on every telegraph pole in town.
The resulting scandal, through link
ing their names with hers, would be
enough to blight the careers of every
one of the 22 promising young men.
'How Far To Siam?'
But Stanford, refusing to be black
mailed. told her to go ahead and do
her damnedest, and the day before
the list was to appear there was many
a troubled soul and guilty conscience
among the brethren up and down the
Bow.
But the list never got out after all,
for that night Brenda Chalis' horribly
mutilated body was found lifeless
beside the swimming pool of her
Burlingame estate.
When Stanford heard what had
happened there was a general feeling
of relief. Not that anyone wished her
bad luck, or anything, but just the
same, you couldn't help thinking
that even if .she had graduated, a girl
like Brenda wasn't quite equipped to
appreciate fully the honors and ob
ligation appurtenant to a Stanford
decree.

And when they discovered, later
on; that her murderer was a Cal
graduate whose affair with Brenda
had induced a case of schizophrenia,
Stanford thought that was 0.K., too.
Once Upon a Time—'
Fanny, Chris, Madge, and Mack
spent four idyllic years at the Farm.
Fanny and Madge belonged Alpha
Alpha Epsilon sorority. Mack played
in dance orchestras and Chris, a law
student, hashed at Roble. The four
of them used to go on picnics in the
foothills, to "Sticky's" for sundaes,
and to the "flickers."
After graduation, incredibly naive
and innocent in spite of having read

Einstein and Freud, heard Dimnet
lecture, and taken French history
and abnormal psychology, they all
went to New York.
The depression was at its worst,
then, and naturally they all had their
ups and downs getting started. Ex
cept for Fanny, each had the same
goal—a career. All Fanny wanted
was Chris, and of course she got him.
For Fanny is one of these domestic
geniuses. Give her a few yards of
calico, a scrap of oilcloth, some dime
store chinaware and a home-made
lampshade, and she'll transform the
dingiest tenement into a gracious
salon. She never spends more than

15 cents on a meal. With a penny's
worth of carrots, and old onion, a
second-hand herring, and a passe j
banana she can, with a little hocus- I
pocus over the gas jet, produce a j
repast that puts Oscar-of-thc-Wal
dorf to shame.
A gal like that just can't miss, and
before she had been married a year, j
Fanny had licked the depression. Her
husband was becoming a successful j
attorney, they were moving up to j
Scarsdale, and most important of all, I
Fanny knew that she was going to
have her baby.
We could go on and name some
more, but we suspect that you've al

ready guessed the truth, which Is that
these aren't real people at all, merely
characters out of fiction.
And you're right, of course. Eddie
Brunner is in John O'Hara's "Butter
field B."' How the mystery of Brenda
Chalis was solved is interestingly told
by George Dyer in "The Catalyst
Club"; while the trials and tribula
tions of Fanny are from "Manhattan
Love Song," by Kathleen Morris.
The only idea which these three
books have in common is the notion
that Stanford turns out a type of per
son who is interesting and colorful,
and who does exciting things in a big
way—in other words, that Stanford is
the place to go to in order to engage
in and prepare for a rich and dra
matic life.
This may seem pretty hard to be
lieve for some of us whose humdrum
existences are enlivened only by an
occasional football defeat or the im
minence of finals, but just the same, a
Stanford grad wrote one of last
year's best sellers, the name of an
other is being linked with a famous
film actress, and a Stanford man was
chief officer on the freighter "Ohian"
when she piled up on Point Lobos
last September.
And so, making due allowance for
exaggeration of the part of novelists,
there is evidence to show that Stan
ford does produce a somewhat dis
tinctive type. Fact and fiction can't
both be wrong.

r JpIEY went to Stanford, these peo
ple. Most of them graduated, yet
their names never appeared in the !
Bawl-Out, and you won't find them
on the alumni rolls.
Take Eddie Brunner, '29. His car
toons, with their funny, short legged j
and pop-eyed men, used to be one of j
the best features of the Chaparral. |
Eddie was pretty popular. He had a j
fairly decent allowance and Packard
phaeton, so he practically had his
pick of the second-string contingent
of the IiOO.
After he graduated Eddie went to
New York. For a while he nearly
starved, but then, through the aid of j
a classmate of his, he got a job doing j
illustrations for advertisements of
college movies. He is one of the few
artists in New York or Hollywood |
who can draw a co-ed that looks like i
a co-ed. not like a chorine.
But Eddie's chief claim to fame is,
or rather was, his friendship (all the ,
more remarkable because platonic) i
with Gloria Wandrous, the glamor- ,
ous "speak-easy girl," whose myste- |
rious death in 1932 kept the tabloids' j
circulations boosting for weeks.
Of Course You Remember
Of course everyone at Stanford re
members Brenda Chalis. Along about i
the middle of last Spring quarter this 1
beautiful and immoral young heiress]
discovered that because she had cut <
too many classes and flunked so many |
exes, she was not going to graduate in !
June. So she went to the Dean with i
a list of 22 names. All of the names
were well known on the campus. |
Most of them were important men in j
the Class of '36, and the rest were j
juniors, a couple of instructors, and j
an athletic coach.
After every name was a date from I
the past college year, sometimes two. |
If. Brenda informed the authorities,
they did not immediately say she
could graduate, she would have the
list mimeographed, and a copy past
ed on every telegraph pole in town.
The resulting scandal, through link
ing their names with hers, would be
enough to blight the careers of every
one of the 22 promising young men.
'How Far To Siam?'
But Stanford, refusing to be black
mailed. told her to go ahead and do
her damnedest, and the day before
the list was to appear there was many
a troubled soul and guilty conscience
among the brethren up and down the
Bow.
But the list never got out after all,
for that night Brenda Chalis' horribly
mutilated body was found lifeless
beside the swimming pool of her
Burlingame estate.
When Stanford heard what had
happened there was a general feeling
of relief. Not that anyone wished her
bad luck, or anything, but just the
same, you couldn't help thinking
that even if .she had graduated, a girl
like Brenda wasn't quite equipped to
appreciate fully the honors and ob
ligation appurtenant to a Stanford
decree.

And when they discovered, later
on; that her murderer was a Cal
graduate whose affair with Brenda
had induced a case of schizophrenia,
Stanford thought that was 0.K., too.
Once Upon a Time—'
Fanny, Chris, Madge, and Mack
spent four idyllic years at the Farm.
Fanny and Madge belonged Alpha
Alpha Epsilon sorority. Mack played
in dance orchestras and Chris, a law
student, hashed at Roble. The four
of them used to go on picnics in the
foothills, to "Sticky's" for sundaes,
and to the "flickers."
After graduation, incredibly naive
and innocent in spite of having read

Einstein and Freud, heard Dimnet
lecture, and taken French history
and abnormal psychology, they all
went to New York.
The depression was at its worst,
then, and naturally they all had their
ups and downs getting started. Ex
cept for Fanny, each had the same
goal—a career. All Fanny wanted
was Chris, and of course she got him.
For Fanny is one of these domestic
geniuses. Give her a few yards of
calico, a scrap of oilcloth, some dime
store chinaware and a home-made
lampshade, and she'll transform the
dingiest tenement into a gracious
salon. She never spends more than

15 cents on a meal. With a penny's
worth of carrots, and old onion, a
second-hand herring, and a passe j
banana she can, with a little hocus- I
pocus over the gas jet, produce a j
repast that puts Oscar-of-thc-Wal
dorf to shame.
A gal like that just can't miss, and
before she had been married a year, j
Fanny had licked the depression. Her
husband was becoming a successful j
attorney, they were moving up to j
Scarsdale, and most important of all, I
Fanny knew that she was going to
have her baby.
We could go on and name some
more, but we suspect that you've al

ready guessed the truth, which Is that
these aren't real people at all, merely
characters out of fiction.
And you're right, of course. Eddie
Brunner is in John O'Hara's "Butter
field B."' How the mystery of Brenda
Chalis was solved is interestingly told
by George Dyer in "The Catalyst
Club"; while the trials and tribula
tions of Fanny are from "Manhattan
Love Song," by Kathleen Morris.
The only idea which these three
books have in common is the notion
that Stanford turns out a type of per
son who is interesting and colorful,
and who does exciting things in a big
way—in other words, that Stanford is
the place to go to in order to engage
in and prepare for a rich and dra
matic life.
This may seem pretty hard to be
lieve for some of us whose humdrum
existences are enlivened only by an
occasional football defeat or the im

that Stanford turns out a type of per
son who is interesting and colorful,
and who does exciting things in a big
way—in other words, that Stanford is
the place to go to in order to engage
in and prepare for a rich and dra
matic life.
This may seem pretty hard to be
lieve for some of us whose humdrum
existences are enlivened only by an
occasional football defeat or the im
minence of finals, but just the same, a
Stanford grad wrote one of last
year's best sellers, the name of an
other is being linked with a famous
film actress, and a Stanford man was
chief officer on the freighter "Ohian"
when she piled up on Point Lobos
last September.
And so, making due allowance for
exaggeration of the part of novelists,
there is evidence to show that Stan
ford does produce a somewhat dis
tinctive type. Fact and fiction can't
both be wrong.
r JpIEY went to Stanford, these peo
ple. Most of them graduated, yet
their names never appeared in the !
Bawl-Out, and you won't find them
on the alumni rolls.
Take Eddie Brunner, '29. His car
toons, with their funny, short legged j
and pop-eyed men, used to be one of j
the best features of the Chaparral. |
Eddie was pretty popular. He had a j
fairly decent allowance and Packard
phaeton, so he practically had his
pick of the second-string contingent
of the IiOO.
After he graduated Eddie went to
New York. For a while he nearly
starved, but then, through the aid of j
a classmate of his, he got a job doing j
illustrations for advertisements of
college movies. He is one of the few
artists in New York or Hollywood |
who can draw a co-ed that looks like i
a co-ed. not like a chorine.
But Eddie's chief claim to fame is,
or rather was, his friendship (all the ,
more remarkable because platonic) i
with Gloria Wandrous, the glamor- ,
ous "speak-easy girl," whose myste- |
rious death in 1932 kept the tabloids' j
circulations boosting for weeks.
Of Course You Remember
Of course everyone at Stanford re
members Brenda Chalis. Along about i
the middle of last Spring quarter this 1
beautiful and immoral young heiress]
discovered that because she had cut <
too many classes and flunked so many |
exes, she was not going to graduate in !
June. So she went to the Dean with i
a list of 22 names. All of the names
were well known on the campus. |
Most of them were important men in j
the Class of '36, and the rest were j
juniors, a couple of instructors, and j
an athletic coach.
After every name was a date from I
the past college year, sometimes two. |
If. Brenda informed the authorities,
they did not immediately say she
could graduate, she would have the
list mimeographed, and a copy past
ed on every telegraph pole in town.
The resulting scandal, through link
ing their names with hers, would be
enough to blight the careers of every
one of the 22 promising young men.
'How Far To Siam?'
But Stanford, refusing to be black
mailed. told her to go ahead and do
her damnedest, and the day before
the list was to appear there was many
a troubled soul and guilty conscience
among the brethren up and down the
Bow.
But the list never got out after all,
for that night Brenda Chalis' horribly
mutilated body was found lifeless
beside the swimming pool of her
Burlingame estate.
When Stanford heard what had
happened there was a general feeling
of relief. Not that anyone wished her
bad luck, or anything, but just the
same, you couldn't help thinking
that even if .she had graduated, a girl
like Brenda wasn't quite equipped to
appreciate fully the honors and ob
ligation appurtenant to a Stanford
decree.

And when they discovered, later
on; that her murderer was a Cal
graduate whose affair with Brenda
had induced a case of schizophrenia,
Stanford thought that was 0.K., too.
Once Upon a Time—'
Fanny, Chris, Madge, and Mack
spent four idyllic years at the Farm.
Fanny and Madge belonged Alpha
Alpha Epsilon sorority. Mack played
in dance orchestras and Chris, a law
student, hashed at Roble. The four
of them used to go on picnics in the
foothills, to "Sticky's" for sundaes,
and to the "flickers."
After graduation, incredibly naive
and innocent in spite of having read

Einstein and Freud, heard Dimnet
lecture, and taken French history
and abnormal psychology, they all
went to New York.
The depression was at its worst,
then, and naturally they all had their
ups and downs getting started. Ex
cept for Fanny, each had the same
goal—a career. All Fanny wanted
was Chris, and of course she got him.
For Fanny is one of these domestic
geniuses. Give her a few yards of
calico, a scrap of oilcloth, some dime
store chinaware and a home-made
lampshade, and she'll transform the
dingiest tenement into a gracious
salon. She never spends more than

15 cents on a meal. With a penny's
worth of carrots, and old onion, a
second-hand herring, and a passe j
banana she can, with a little hocus- I
pocus over the gas jet, produce a j
repast that puts Oscar-of-thc-Wal
dorf to shame.
A gal like that just can't miss, and
before she had been married a year, j
Fanny had licked the depression. Her
husband was becoming a successful j
attorney, they were moving up to j
Scarsdale, and most important of all, I
Fanny knew that she was going to
have her baby.
We could go on and name some
more, but we suspect that you've al

ready guessed the truth, which Is that
these aren't real people at all, merely
characters out of fiction.
And you're right, of course. Eddie
Brunner is in John O'Hara's "Butter
field B."' How the mystery of Brenda
Chalis was solved is interestingly told
by George Dyer in "The Catalyst
Club"; while the trials and tribula
tions of Fanny are from "Manhattan
Love Song," by Kathleen Morris.

these aren't real people at all, merely
characters out of fiction.
And you're right, of course. Eddie
Brunner is in John O'Hara's "Butter
field B."' How the mystery of Brenda
Chalis was solved is interestingly told
by George Dyer in "The Catalyst
Club"; while the trials and tribula
tions of Fanny are from "Manhattan
Love Song," by Kathleen Morris.
The only idea which these three
books have in common is the notion
that Stanford turns out a type of per
son who is interesting and colorful,
and who does exciting things in a big
way—in other words, that Stanford is
the place to go to in order to engage
in and prepare for a rich and dra
matic life.
This may seem pretty hard to be
lieve for some of us whose humdrum
existences are enlivened only by an
occasional football defeat or the im
minence of finals, but just the same, a
Stanford grad wrote one of last
year's best sellers, the name of an
other is being linked with a famous
film actress, and a Stanford man was
chief officer on the freighter "Ohian"
when she piled up on Point Lobos
last September.
And so, making due allowance for
exaggeration of the part of novelists,
there is evidence to show that Stan
ford does produce a somewhat dis
tinctive type. Fact and fiction can't
both be wrong.
r JpIEY went to Stanford, these peo
ple. Most of them graduated, yet
their names never appeared in the !
Bawl-Out, and you won't find them
on the alumni rolls.
Take Eddie Brunner, '29. His car
toons, with their funny, short legged j
and pop-eyed men, used to be one of j
the best features of the Chaparral. |
Eddie was pretty popular. He had a j
fairly decent allowance and Packard
phaeton, so he practically had his
pick of the second-string contingent
of the IiOO.
After he graduated Eddie went to
New York. For a while he nearly
starved, but then, through the aid of j
a classmate of his, he got a job doing j
illustrations for advertisements of
college movies. He is one of the few
artists in New York or Hollywood |
who can draw a co-ed that looks like i
a co-ed. not like a chorine.
But Eddie's chief claim to fame is,
or rather was, his friendship (all the ,
more remarkable because platonic) i
with Gloria Wandrous, the glamor- ,
ous "speak-easy girl," whose myste- |
rious death in 1932 kept the tabloids' j
circulations boosting for weeks.
Of Course You Remember
Of course everyone at Stanford re
members Brenda Chalis. Along about i
the middle of last Spring quarter this 1
beautiful and immoral young heiress]
discovered that because she had cut <
too many classes and flunked so many |
exes, she was not going to graduate in !
June. So she went to the Dean with i
a list of 22 names. All of the names
were well known on the campus. |
Most of them were important men in j
the Class of '36, and the rest were j
juniors, a couple of instructors, and j
an athletic coach.
After every name was a date from I
the past college year, sometimes two. |
If. Brenda informed the authorities,
they did not immediately say she
could graduate, she would have the
list mimeographed, and a copy past
ed on every telegraph pole in town.
The resulting scandal, through link
ing their names with hers, would be
enough to blight the careers of every
one of the 22 promising young men.
'How Far To Siam?'
But Stanford, refusing to be black
mailed. told her to go ahead and do
her damnedest, and the day before
the list was to appear there was many
a troubled soul and guilty conscience
among the brethren up and down the
Bow.
But the list never got out after all,
for that night Brenda Chalis' horribly
mutilated body was found lifeless
beside the swimming pool of her
Burlingame estate.
When Stanford heard what had
happened there was a general feeling
of relief. Not that anyone wished her
bad luck, or anything, but just the
same, you couldn't help thinking
that even if .she had graduated, a girl
like Brenda wasn't quite equipped to
appreciate fully the honors and ob
ligation appurtenant to a Stanford
decree.

And when they discovered, later
on; that her murderer was a Cal
graduate whose affair with Brenda
had induced a case of schizophrenia,
Stanford thought that was 0.K., too.
Once Upon a Time—'
Fanny, Chris, Madge, and Mack
spent four idyllic years at the Farm.
Fanny and Madge belonged Alpha
Alpha Epsilon sorority. Mack played
in dance orchestras and Chris, a law
student, hashed at Roble. The four
of them used to go on picnics in the
foothills, to "Sticky's" for sundaes,
and to the "flickers."
After graduation, incredibly naive
and innocent in spite of having read

Einstein and Freud, heard Dimnet
lecture, and taken French history
and abnormal psychology, they all
went to New York.
The depression was at its worst,
then, and naturally they all had their
ups and downs getting started. Ex
cept for Fanny, each had the same
goal—a career. All Fanny wanted
was Chris, and of course she got him.
For Fanny is one of these domestic
geniuses. Give her a few yards of
calico, a scrap of oilcloth, some dime
store chinaware and a home-made
lampshade, and she'll transform the
dingiest tenement into a gracious
salon. She never spends more than

15 cents on a meal. With a penny's
worth of carrots, and old onion, a
second-hand herring, and a passe j
banana she can, with a little hocus- I
pocus over the gas jet, produce a j
repast that puts Oscar-of-thc-Wal
dorf to shame.
A gal like that just can't miss, and
before she had been married a year, j
Fanny had licked the depression. Her
husband was becoming a successful j
attorney, they were moving up to j
Scarsdale, and most important of all, I
Fanny knew that she was going to
have her baby.
