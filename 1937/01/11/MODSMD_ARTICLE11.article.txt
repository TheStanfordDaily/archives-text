! r Daily has asked me to com
ment upon President Roosevelt's
j recent address to Congress in which
I he expressly commended that body
| and impliedly condemned the ju
] dieiary for their respective attitudes
j toward the New Deal.
With all due respect I must say
| that this address seems to reveal a
I lack of insight into the true function
i of the courts in holding statutes un
j constitutional. They cannot deliber-
I ately turn their backs upon the Con-
I stitution as they understand it and ,
j follow the President and Congress at :
j will in a spirit of co-operation. As in- i
[ dividuals the judges may wish the j
Constitution other than it is, but in j
deciding cases they must recognize it j
as being just what it declares itself j
to be, "the supreme law of the land."
Being human they are doubtless con- i
ditioned by their education, training ;
and experience and must often differ
among themselves, but to every one j
of them his judicial action is a matter |
of duty and not of choice. He has no
option either legal or moral when
once he has made up his mind upon
a specific constitutional question.
One thing is very clear. The Presi- I
dent has no lack of self-confidence as
a Constitutional lawyer. Ho says that j
he has been reading the preamble
again and also some of the proceed
ings of the Constitutional Conven
tion, and that after this reading he is
convinced that Congress has power to j
do whatever needs to be done for the j
national welfare. For that reason he |
believes his New Deal program to be j
consistent with the Constitution as it
stands and that all we need is a ju- j
dieiary which understands the Con- [
stitution as well as he does. But :
doubtless the Supreme Court is fa
miliar with the preamble and is not i
unacquainted with the history of the '

great Convention, It is also familiar.
with the Constitution itself and a |
long series of great decisions based j
upon it." Nor can it escape the Tenth |
Amendment: "The powers not dele- j
gated to the United States by the j
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to i
the States are reserved to the States |
respectively or to the people." Upon
that rock much New Deal legislation
has already crashed and more is in j
serious peril. In this connection it
may be remarked that the Supreme
Court itself has no inferiority com
plex when addressing its attention to
Constituional questions. It regards it
self as the Constitutional arbiter be
tween the nation and the states. And
for more than a century the Ameri
can people have so sustained it. I

says that for the discharge of his ad
ministrative duties he is "solely re
sponsible." In this declaration he is
entirely correct but not more so than
are the courts who from the begin
ning have steadfastly maintained the
independence of the judiciary. That
independence is fortified by the ex
press language of the Constitution.
Witness the life tenure of the judges
and the prohibition against reducing
their compensation during their re
spective terms of office. It is quite
certain that the nine justices of our
highest court will not surrender that
independence upon demand or en
treaty from whatever source.
What then can be done to bring the
Supreme Court into the line? If the

President is unwilling to w;iit for tho
None whatever, as the court <s at
present constituted. The President
co-operation of Nature in creating
vacancies on the bench, to be filled
by his appointment, he may ask Con
gress to increase the number of the
justices and in that way pack, tho
court. That would be constitutional,
however unwise or distateful to the
President. Congress obviously has no
power to compel the courts to enforce
its laws regardless of the question of
constitutionality and that solution,
sometimes proposed by the laiety,
may as well be dropped. If. as many
believe, the time has really come for
greatly enlarging the scope of Fed
eral power the only sound and log

option either legal or moral when
once he has made up his mind upon
a specific constitutional question.
One thing is very clear. The Presi- I
dent has no lack of self-confidence as
a Constitutional lawyer. Ho says that j
he has been reading the preamble
again and also some of the proceed
ings of the Constitutional Conven
tion, and that after this reading he is
convinced that Congress has power to j
do whatever needs to be done for the j
national welfare. For that reason he |
believes his New Deal program to be j
consistent with the Constitution as it
stands and that all we need is a ju- j
dieiary which understands the Con- [
stitution as well as he does. But :
doubtless the Supreme Court is fa
miliar with the preamble and is not i
unacquainted with the history of the '

great Convention, It is also familiar.
with the Constitution itself and a |
long series of great decisions based j
upon it." Nor can it escape the Tenth |
Amendment: "The powers not dele- j
gated to the United States by the j
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to i
the States are reserved to the States |
respectively or to the people." Upon
that rock much New Deal legislation
has already crashed and more is in j
serious peril. In this connection it
may be remarked that the Supreme
Court itself has no inferiority com
plex when addressing its attention to
Constituional questions. It regards it
self as the Constitutional arbiter be
tween the nation and the states. And
for more than a century the Ameri
can people have so sustained it. I
What is likely to be the effect of |

the President's address upon the fu

says that for the discharge of his ad
ministrative duties he is "solely re
sponsible." In this declaration he is
entirely correct but not more so than
are the courts who from the begin
ning have steadfastly maintained the
independence of the judiciary. That
independence is fortified by the ex
press language of the Constitution.
Witness the life tenure of the judges
and the prohibition against reducing
their compensation during their re
spective terms of office. It is quite
certain that the nine justices of our
highest court will not surrender that
independence upon demand or en
treaty from whatever source.
What then can be done to bring the
Supreme Court into the line? If the

President is unwilling to w;iit for tho
None whatever, as the court <s at

co-operation of Nature in creating
vacancies on the bench, to be filled
by his appointment, he may ask Con
gress to increase the number of the
justices and in that way pack, tho
court. That would be constitutional,
however unwise or distateful to the
President. Congress obviously has no
power to compel the courts to enforce
its laws regardless of the question of
constitutionality and that solution,
sometimes proposed by the laiety,
may as well be dropped. If. as many
believe, the time has really come for
greatly enlarging the scope of Fed
eral power the only sound and log
