# Cold Snaps At Stanfordites
## 
### 
Stanford amoebae shivered last i
week in a temperature far below j
their biological optimum.
As local chambers of commerce j
"ahemmed" and oldest inhabitants
consulted their almanacks. Farm |
denizens dug in for the coldest win- i
ler in 65 years.
Automobiles and the third of Stan
ford's population who drive them re
acted to the cold snap when hosts of |
unsuspected students "stepped on 1
'cr" only to find the motor tightly I
frozen.
Vehicular casualties, according to j
Millar Clarke, manager of the cam- j
pus service station, included four
cars with cracked engine blocks and j
split radiators.
Wising to the weather-man's i
prank, resourceful drivers set about i
doctoring for all-weather driving. !
Some prescribed a mixture of water!
and alcohol (thus violating one of!
Stanford's fundamental laws). Oth

cial anti-free/.e. One Alpha Delt I
poured eu tic cologne into his auto's J
radiator.
Cold cracked a broken gas main
back of the Kappa Sig house Satur
day morning. At 1 o'clock the escap
ing fumes were ignited by an un
known source. Responding to a tele
phone alarms, the fire department
turned out. declared the situation
outside its jurisdiction, called on the
Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
As mercury and aneroid thermom
eters both hit the skids to below
freezing figures. Row porch sleepers
suffered. Battling its way into this
frigid environ, an expedition discov
ered queer methods of keeping warm
which had been adopted by the na
t i ves.
One Chi O began Friday night by
wrapping a fluffy scarf about her
flu fly head, another around her neck.
After donning a thick sweater and
bathrobe, she armored her toes in bed

I Alop the usual thickness (or thin
| ness) of the blankets on the bed it
| self, she placed a polo and a fur coat;
I between the sheels nestled a brace of
hot water bottles.
Just before she hibernated, this
cold-blooded offspring of .sunnier
climes pinned vip her tailored pyjam
as at the feet; slipped on fur-lined
gloves.
However, Pan-Hell did not freeze
over, (See page 2).
