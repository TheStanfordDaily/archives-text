# Mopsters Plan Mop-up
## By RICHARD DUDMAN 
### 
UNIONIZATION of Stanford's jan
itors has reached the 90 per cent
mark, according to A. E. Newcomb,
who was elected chairman yesterday
of the Stanford branch of Local 87,
Building Maintenance Employees'
Union, at a meeting in Palo Alto yes
terday.
Charles Hardy, San Francisco
representative of the union, was op
timistic about the mopsters' chances
of improving their monthly wage of
545 with room and board. Employers
claim that the wage is $80 to $120,
with $35 deducted for room and
board.
Charging inconsiderate manage
ment of janitorial work by Foreman
J. M. Brown, Stanford representa
tive of the American Building Main
tenance Corporation, Hardy said,
"The whole trouble is this Brown up
there; he doesn't seem to want to give
the boys a break."
'Waiting for Rights'
Counselling the youthful union not
to let minor voluntary wage increases
cool their zeal. Hardy emphasized the
fact that Roosevelt's term as Presi
dent will last for only four years.
"We want to get strong enough," he
said, "so that if they get in someone
like our old friend Hoover, we can
hold our gains."
The secretary of the three-month
old San Francisco Local 87 encour
aged the janitors with word that this
local already has 1500 members. "If
you men organize in the proper way,"
• he said, "you can make Stanford
University come to time as well as
any other place you work in! As far
as the Building Maintenance Corpo
ration is concerned, we can handle it
pretty well, if I do say so myself."
No Strike Unless . . .
John Anderson, of the San Jose
central labor council, told the broom
pushers that they had nothing to fear
in organizing. "If you are afraid to
join an organization, then you have
no license to protest about working
conditions," he warned.
According to general sentiment at
yesterday's meeting, the talk about
unionizing has been responsible for
a great improvement in food served
the janitors. "I could even eat it to
day. muttered one man.
Claiming that "this man Brown had
been arranging to lay off union sym
pathizers as fast as he could find men
ti fill their positions," one of the
speakers explained that conditions
have improved 100 per cent in the
past week, with the threat of union
ization.
Also, intimidation has practically
ceased, he remarked.
Although members were admitted
into the organization today for $2.50,
it will cost them $5.50 from now on.
This includes the initiation fee and
also the first month's dues, which are
one dollar.
When Chairman Newcomb was
asked whether or not there would be
a strike, he declared, "No, no, we

don't want a strike. We aren't look
ing for a strike unless it's a case of
have-to."
Instead of dealing further with the
local manager, Brown, the new or
ganization plans to draw up a closed
shop agreement with San Francisco
executives of A.B.M.C.
If this is unsuccessful, satisfaction
will be sought from the university
administration.

it will cost them $5.50 from now on.
This includes the initiation fee and
also the first month's dues, which are
one dollar.
When Chairman Newcomb was
asked whether or not there would be
a strike, he declared, "No, no, we

don't want a strike. We aren't look
ing for a strike unless it's a case of
have-to."
Instead of dealing further with the
local manager, Brown, the new or
ganization plans to draw up a closed
shop agreement with San Francisco
executives of A.B.M.C.
If this is unsuccessful, satisfaction
will be sought from the university
administration.
UNIONIZATION of Stanford's jan
itors has reached the 90 per cent
mark, according to A. E. Newcomb,
who was elected chairman yesterday
of the Stanford branch of Local 87,
Building Maintenance Employees'
Union, at a meeting in Palo Alto yes
terday.
Charles Hardy, San Francisco
representative of the union, was op
timistic about the mopsters' chances
of improving their monthly wage of
545 with room and board. Employers
claim that the wage is $80 to $120,
with $35 deducted for room and
board.
Charging inconsiderate manage
ment of janitorial work by Foreman
J. M. Brown, Stanford representa
tive of the American Building Main
tenance Corporation, Hardy said,
"The whole trouble is this Brown up
there; he doesn't seem to want to give
the boys a break."
'Waiting for Rights'
Counselling the youthful union not
to let minor voluntary wage increases
cool their zeal. Hardy emphasized the
fact that Roosevelt's term as Presi
dent will last for only four years.
"We want to get strong enough," he
said, "so that if they get in someone
like our old friend Hoover, we can
hold our gains."
The secretary of the three-month
old San Francisco Local 87 encour
aged the janitors with word that this
local already has 1500 members. "If
you men organize in the proper way,"
• he said, "you can make Stanford
University come to time as well as
any other place you work in! As far
as the Building Maintenance Corpo
ration is concerned, we can handle it
pretty well, if I do say so myself."
No Strike Unless . . .
John Anderson, of the San Jose
central labor council, told the broom
pushers that they had nothing to fear
in organizing. "If you are afraid to
join an organization, then you have
no license to protest about working
conditions," he warned.
According to general sentiment at
yesterday's meeting, the talk about
unionizing has been responsible for
a great improvement in food served
the janitors. "I could even eat it to
day. muttered one man.
Claiming that "this man Brown had
been arranging to lay off union sym
pathizers as fast as he could find men
ti fill their positions," one of the
speakers explained that conditions
have improved 100 per cent in the
past week, with the threat of union
ization.
Also, intimidation has practically
ceased, he remarked.
Although members were admitted
into the organization today for $2.50,
it will cost them $5.50 from now on.
This includes the initiation fee and
also the first month's dues, which are
one dollar.
