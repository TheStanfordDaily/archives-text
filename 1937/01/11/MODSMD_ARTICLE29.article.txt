The Quad still has room for 13 pic
tures of seniors. They may be taken
any time today. Call the office for
appointments. Ruth Barnes, editor of
the Quad, has extended the deadline
on proofs until Wednesday at 5:30.
All who have not yet returned theirs
are asked to come to the office at
once. Underclassmen may now make
appointments for pictures this week.
