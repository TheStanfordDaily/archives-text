# 'Better' vs. 'Worser'
## 
### 
Besides this factor, there is the in
disputable hierarchy. Some sorori
ties are "better" than others, others
are "worse." So we find that the
greatest function of the sorority,
which should be the providing of
dormitory facilities for mutually fun
loving women, is reall yto separate
people into the "goods," "bads," and
"indifferents," and this has the effect
of supporting the drooping egos of
those who are the "goods" on top.
This might be justified, if it were a
classification according to ability or
to personality. But it does not. It is
a classification, according to what
your family does with its money, ac
cording to the prep school you at
tended, your ability to look like
everyone else at the rushing dinner,
and your ability to talk charmingly
for two hours without saying any
thing. Frequently, the poor but hon
est personality gal crashes the big
time. This, however, is not the rule.
And now we come to the so-what
part of the story. What to do about
it? There is nothing we can do.
Some day, maybe, the University wlil

screw up its courage, screw down its
finances and liquidate both sorori
ties and fraternities.
Until that time, we may expect ex
cited young ladies whose residences
are on Lasuen Street to phone in to
Tiie Daily to prevent us from giving
out any useful information to the
freshman as to how to attempt to
make the system work, and cause us
to write such meandering philosophy
as the above.
Which makes nobody happy, and
particularly us.
