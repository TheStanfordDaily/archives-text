# Frosh Basketballers Win Season's Openers
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
The eyes of Stanford were upon
them. It was the acid test for the
Class of '40's basketballers. And
they came through.
Living up to all expectations, the
frosh hoopsters, in their first appear
ance before the Farm's Sporting
World, did right fine by themselves,
taking Polytechnic High down a few
notches by a 31-24 count Friday
night, and swamping Palo Alto High
32-13 Saturday night.
Frosh Start Slow
In the Polytechnic game, the frosh
started slow, a wee bit nervous, play
ing sloppily. Passes were wild, shots
were off, and plays didn't work.
Meantime, however, the Parrots were
wasting no time, and, combining
Derian's fast passes for set-ups and
beautiful long shots by Derian and
Kirsch, ran up a 5-0 lead.
The yearlings gradually inched up
on the preps, making bullet passes
count for points. Lafaille's unerring
eye and Siebert's fast work on fol
low shots started the Stanford side of
the scoreboard on its way, and the
half ended with the Encina boys out
in front, 15-12.
Although Polytechnic came close,
they never again headed the now
fast-moving frosh. Working the ball
in close time and time again, the for
ward wall of Lyon, Lafaille, and Sie
bert had no trouble Hipping the ball
through the hoop. The Parrots' scor
ing was limited to long shots, because
of accurate guarding by Anderson
and Rahn.
Siebert High Pointer
Siebert's 6 feet, 6Vu inches came in
mighty handy, making him high
point man with 17 markers, and en
abling Stanford to keep the ball after
missed shots, due to his adeptness in
taking the ball off the backboard.
High man for the Parrots was Der
ian, with G points.
In their game with Palo Alto, the
frosh showed absolutely no sign of
their "first - night" nervousness,
handling the ball like experts and
making plays work. In spite of this,
however, the game was slow, enliv
ened only by the tremendous beller
ings of little Ned Kay, the referee.
Lyon Starts Scoring
Two minutes of torpid play passed
before the ball dropped through
either hoop. Lyon started the scor
ing with a tip-in shot, followed by i
one of those greased lightning plays
under the frosh basket in which
Paly earned two points via Stone's
set-up.
After this the frosh went to work,
led by Lafaille, who passed and shot
with equal accuracy, throwing long
ones to Lyon and Siebert for scores,
and swLshing two himself from his
"dead" spot on the right side of the
court. Rahn's superb floor-work un
der his own hoop and Anderson's
deadly guarding kept the Vikings
from doing much damage while the
yearlings were running up the score j

to lead 19-7 at the half.
Long Pass Highlight
Highlight of the second hull' was
Lyon's pass for half the length of the
court to Lafaille. Lyon didn't really
pass it; he centered the ball. What's
more, Lafaille caught it. Only other
thing that enlivened the last half of
the game was Staehle's work under
Paly's basket on tip-ins.
High-point man was again Siebert,
with 9 points, and Lafaille right be
hind with 8.
Only comment Mentor Wtyze Gor
ter has to make on his team's debuts
was this: ''Yeah, they were a bit
nervous in the first game, but, gee!
did you see 'em work that ball
around tonight!"
