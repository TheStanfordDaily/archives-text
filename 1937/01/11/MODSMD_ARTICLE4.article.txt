# WE CAN'T PRINT THIS â€” SAYS WHO!

### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
"|7ARLY yesterday The Dnily re
ceived phone calls from rather
excited young ladies whose resi
dences are on Lasuen Street.
They were afraid The Daily, in its
usual smart-aleck fashion, was going
to print an "expose" of sororities.
Where excited young ladies get
these ideas, we don't know, but The
Daily, as a matter of fact, had con
templated an interesting little article
painting a picture of what will be
going on this week among the sister
hoods, never dreaming that anything
unseemly would be taking place.
For the first time in our lives, we
were swelling with civic virtue. All
we had contemplated was factual
material explaining to tempest-toss'd
Roble Hall, what this next week
means, what takes place and what of
it.
We weren't going to expose sorori
ties, knowing the terrific toll due to
exposure on sorority sleeping porches
this last week, and not knowing any
thing (o expose. Besides the business
of exposing things isn't nearly the fun
it's cracked up to be.
However, we got (he phone calls,
which immediately got us interested.
Mustn't' Print
The substance of the calls was: (hat
we shouldn't tell the freshman wom
en the inside story for fear of dis
illusioning them.
It seems that at this point, by (he
proper use 01 candlelight, Christmas
Night, Matchabelli and Richard Hud
nut, the sorority women have the
freshman thinking that sorority
women are goddesses on earth and
thrt sorority life is in at least heav
en's slums.
Now, if The Daily came out in its
sui ly manner and pain(ed the soror
ity situation from the back stairs
angle, the glamour would be gone,
and i! would create unhappiness up
on the Row and in Roble.
Wrong Pictures
This is all very nice, but it is un
fortunately a dramatization: Because
neither the candlelight picture of
sororities nor the backstairs picture
of sororities is the true picture, and
it is the true picture the freshman
woman should have. And it is the
true picture that they won't get.
They won't get it from the sorori
ties, because they are hamstrung by
the silly Pan-Hell rules and by the
enforced artificiality of the rushing
dinners. They won't get it from The
Daily, because Ihe men on the staff
don't belong to sororities and (he
women won't write it for us.
The women on the staff say: "We
bate rushing, we loathe the whole
set-up, and we won't write an article
for you."
When you look into the numerous
trumperies of the Pan-Hellenic rules,
the prohibition of normal relations
between Row women and freshman
women, you are amazed at the spe
cial caste system that is set up.
Because, like it or not, these rules
are just so many more barriers
towards a sane and healthy attitude
an sororities. By making it impos
sible for freshman women to see
sorority women under normal cir
cumstances, you give (hem false ideas
of sorority allure and you make it
impossible for them to determine
what sort of a house they would like
to join. _
The thing really works in the op
posite way. The sorority does not
know what it is pledging, that is, un
less there has been illegal rushing.
Under the ideal Pan-Hellenic set
up, sorority women would not know
jr care about Robleites except at the
.ozy little rushing dinners.
Since last year when there was the
nig blow-up in both sororities and
fraternities, and people got righteous
ind hysterical at the same time, there
ictually has been very little illegal
ushing in either fraternities or sor
orities. And in addition, the sorori
ties were euchred out of their glori
fied illegal rush get-together, known
is the Women's Conference Party.
Illegal Not Normal
Now illegal rushing parties are by
10 means normal contact, but they
ire far and away more revealing of
lie true character of house and

frosh than the formalized, artificial
rush meetings.
In fraternity rushing, houses pur
sue the policy of pledging key men in
Encina, letting them round up the
house "class." This may not exactly
give the house freshmen compatible
with its principles and the high, mor
al tone of its charter, but it at least
gives it a pledge class unified by
common interests.
In sorority rushing, on the other
hand, it is seldom the frosh know
either the women in the house they
are pledging or the class they are
pledging with.
It makes no difference whether il
legal rushing has to be curbed be
cause it leads to financial burdens on
houses: if one house does it, all
houses have to do it. The fact re
mains, our competitive rushing sys
tem has erected barriers which the
administrators say are inevitable
(and probably are, too) that make it
next to impossible for those with
j mutual interests, desires, and aspira
tions to live together.
Bound by Symbols
Instead, we have in most houses
groups of 30 to 40 women who are
bound not by any interest in each
other, but by the extrinsic badges
and symbols and the board bills. The
only reason that many of them can
stand it is that they don't have any
interests at all.

In sorority rushing, on the other
hand, it is seldom the frosh know
either the women in the house they
are pledging or the class they are

It makes no difference whether il
legal rushing has to be curbed be
cause it leads to financial burdens on
houses: if one house does it, all
houses have to do it. The fact re
mains, our competitive rushing sys
tem has erected barriers which the
administrators say are inevitable
(and probably are, too) that make it
next to impossible for those with
j mutual interests, desires, and aspira

Bound by Symbols
Instead, we have in most houses
groups of 30 to 40 women who are
bound not by any interest in each

"|7ARLY yesterday The Dnily re
ceived phone calls from rather
excited young ladies whose resi
dences are on Lasuen Street.
They were afraid The Daily, in its
usual smart-aleck fashion, was going
to print an "expose" of sororities.
Where excited young ladies get
these ideas, we don't know, but The
Daily, as a matter of fact, had con
templated an interesting little article
painting a picture of what will be
going on this week among the sister
hoods, never dreaming that anything
unseemly would be taking place.
For the first time in our lives, we
were swelling with civic virtue. All
we had contemplated was factual
material explaining to tempest-toss'd
Roble Hall, what this next week
means, what takes place and what of
it.
We weren't going to expose sorori
ties, knowing the terrific toll due to
exposure on sorority sleeping porches
this last week, and not knowing any
thing (o expose. Besides the business
of exposing things isn't nearly the fun
it's cracked up to be.
However, we got (he phone calls,
which immediately got us interested.
Mustn't' Print
The substance of the calls was: (hat
we shouldn't tell the freshman wom
en the inside story for fear of dis
illusioning them.
It seems that at this point, by (he
proper use 01 candlelight, Christmas
Night, Matchabelli and Richard Hud
nut, the sorority women have the
freshman thinking that sorority
women are goddesses on earth and
thrt sorority life is in at least heav
en's slums.
Now, if The Daily came out in its
sui ly manner and pain(ed the soror
ity situation from the back stairs
angle, the glamour would be gone,
and i! would create unhappiness up
on the Row and in Roble.
Wrong Pictures
This is all very nice, but it is un
fortunately a dramatization: Because
neither the candlelight picture of
sororities nor the backstairs picture
of sororities is the true picture, and
it is the true picture the freshman
woman should have. And it is the
true picture that they won't get.
They won't get it from the sorori
ties, because they are hamstrung by
the silly Pan-Hell rules and by the
enforced artificiality of the rushing
dinners. They won't get it from The
Daily, because Ihe men on the staff
don't belong to sororities and (he
women won't write it for us.
The women on the staff say: "We
bate rushing, we loathe the whole
set-up, and we won't write an article
for you."
When you look into the numerous
trumperies of the Pan-Hellenic rules,
the prohibition of normal relations
between Row women and freshman
women, you are amazed at the spe
cial caste system that is set up.
Because, like it or not, these rules
are just so many more barriers
towards a sane and healthy attitude
an sororities. By making it impos
sible for freshman women to see
sorority women under normal cir
cumstances, you give (hem false ideas
of sorority allure and you make it
impossible for them to determine
what sort of a house they would like
to join. _
The thing really works in the op
posite way. The sorority does not
know what it is pledging, that is, un
less there has been illegal rushing.
Under the ideal Pan-Hellenic set
up, sorority women would not know
jr care about Robleites except at the
.ozy little rushing dinners.
Since last year when there was the
nig blow-up in both sororities and
fraternities, and people got righteous
ind hysterical at the same time, there
ictually has been very little illegal
ushing in either fraternities or sor
orities. And in addition, the sorori
ties were euchred out of their glori
fied illegal rush get-together, known
is the Women's Conference Party.
Illegal Not Normal
Now illegal rushing parties are by
10 means normal contact, but they
ire far and away more revealing of
lie true character of house and

frosh than the formalized, artificial
rush meetings.
In fraternity rushing, houses pur
sue the policy of pledging key men in
Encina, letting them round up the
house "class." This may not exactly
give the house freshmen compatible
with its principles and the high, mor
al tone of its charter, but it at least
gives it a pledge class unified by
common interests.

jr care about Robleites except at the
.ozy little rushing dinners.
Since last year when there was the
nig blow-up in both sororities and
fraternities, and people got righteous
ind hysterical at the same time, there
ictually has been very little illegal
ushing in either fraternities or sor
orities. And in addition, the sorori
ties were euchred out of their glori
fied illegal rush get-together, known
is the Women's Conference Party.
Illegal Not Normal
Now illegal rushing parties are by
10 means normal contact, but they
ire far and away more revealing of
lie true character of house and

frosh than the formalized, artificial
rush meetings.
In fraternity rushing, houses pur
sue the policy of pledging key men in
Encina, letting them round up the
house "class." This may not exactly
give the house freshmen compatible
with its principles and the high, mor
al tone of its charter, but it at least
gives it a pledge class unified by
common interests.
In sorority rushing, on the other
hand, it is seldom the frosh know
either the women in the house they
are pledging or the class they are
pledging with.
It makes no difference whether il
legal rushing has to be curbed be
cause it leads to financial burdens on
houses: if one house does it, all
houses have to do it. The fact re
mains, our competitive rushing sys
tem has erected barriers which the
administrators say are inevitable
(and probably are, too) that make it
next to impossible for those with
j mutual interests, desires, and aspira
tions to live together.
Bound by Symbols
Instead, we have in most houses
groups of 30 to 40 women who are
bound not by any interest in each
other, but by the extrinsic badges
and symbols and the board bills. The
only reason that many of them can
stand it is that they don't have any
interests at all.
"|7ARLY yesterday The Dnily re
ceived phone calls from rather
excited young ladies whose resi
dences are on Lasuen Street.
They were afraid The Daily, in its
usual smart-aleck fashion, was going
to print an "expose" of sororities.
Where excited young ladies get
these ideas, we don't know, but The
Daily, as a matter of fact, had con
templated an interesting little article
painting a picture of what will be
going on this week among the sister
hoods, never dreaming that anything
unseemly would be taking place.
For the first time in our lives, we
were swelling with civic virtue. All
we had contemplated was factual
material explaining to tempest-toss'd
Roble Hall, what this next week
means, what takes place and what of
it.
We weren't going to expose sorori
ties, knowing the terrific toll due to
exposure on sorority sleeping porches
this last week, and not knowing any
thing (o expose. Besides the business
of exposing things isn't nearly the fun
it's cracked up to be.
However, we got (he phone calls,
which immediately got us interested.
Mustn't' Print
The substance of the calls was: (hat
we shouldn't tell the freshman wom
en the inside story for fear of dis
illusioning them.
It seems that at this point, by (he
proper use 01 candlelight, Christmas
Night, Matchabelli and Richard Hud
nut, the sorority women have the
freshman thinking that sorority
women are goddesses on earth and
thrt sorority life is in at least heav
en's slums.
Now, if The Daily came out in its
sui ly manner and pain(ed the soror
ity situation from the back stairs
angle, the glamour would be gone,
and i! would create unhappiness up
on the Row and in Roble.
Wrong Pictures
This is all very nice, but it is un
fortunately a dramatization: Because
neither the candlelight picture of
sororities nor the backstairs picture
of sororities is the true picture, and
it is the true picture the freshman
woman should have. And it is the
true picture that they won't get.
They won't get it from the sorori
ties, because they are hamstrung by
the silly Pan-Hell rules and by the
enforced artificiality of the rushing
dinners. They won't get it from The
Daily, because Ihe men on the staff
don't belong to sororities and (he
women won't write it for us.
The women on the staff say: "We
bate rushing, we loathe the whole
set-up, and we won't write an article
for you."
When you look into the numerous
trumperies of the Pan-Hellenic rules,
the prohibition of normal relations
between Row women and freshman
women, you are amazed at the spe
cial caste system that is set up.
Because, like it or not, these rules
are just so many more barriers
towards a sane and healthy attitude
an sororities. By making it impos
sible for freshman women to see
sorority women under normal cir
cumstances, you give (hem false ideas
of sorority allure and you make it
impossible for them to determine
what sort of a house they would like
to join. _
The thing really works in the op
posite way. The sorority does not
know what it is pledging, that is, un
less there has been illegal rushing.
