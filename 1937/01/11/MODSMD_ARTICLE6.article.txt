# To "Go" Or Not To "Go"
## 
### 
r jPO GO or not to go— that is the
question now haunting the
minds of rushed Robleites. Along
the dormitory corridors cow-ses
sions occur nightly into the wee
hours. There the girls gather in
cold cream and curlers to (ell their
sorority sob-stories, and perhaps
indulge in a satisfying fit or two of
hysterics.
Roble routine is hopelessly up
set. Chocolate-flake ice cream, or
dinarily a universal favorite, is left
untouched in the dining room
while the more fortunate fresh
women dine up the Row and the
disappointed damsels retire, wail
ing, into the privacy of their own
rooms. Harried sponsors work
overtime giving motherly advice to
the rushed and sympathetic con
solation to the non-rushed.
Still another freshman faction
exists. Members of this group
neither grin nor groan—they give
lengthy dissertations on the evils of
sorority organization to anyone
who cares or doesn't care to listen.
These cynics have comparatively
little to worry about, however,
since they are almost invariably
among those who aren't being
rushed.

That is not to say that there aren't
many functions that a sorority house
can fill. Sororities can be great edu
cative factors in smoothing out per
sonality difficulties, in teaching
women how to get along with others,
and they also are very valuable in
giving women a sense of something
to tie to. Though there is some cant
and hypocrisy, cliquishness and petty i
back-biting in a sorority, in the lone- '
lioess of the college milieu the soror- i
ity forms the function of the port in
the storm.
It is true that in one or two sorori
ties on the campus "every one plucks
her eyebrows the same way," and the
girls' can wear their clothes only in
certain ways. However, the girls who
pledge those houses are pledging the
type of house, whether they like it or
not, which fi htst morfeoshrdluet
not, which fits them for a kind of so
ciety which proceeds in that fashion.
Most of them like it.
Roble WaiTs
So much to the good. But this aca
demic account of what is not pretty
with the rushing system doesn't al
leviate the wailing wall in Roble, and
it doesn't help in makin gany deci
sions, because it is not intended to
toll a Robleite that she shouldn't go
a house, and she is the only one who
can decide what house to go. Be
cause, barring special circumstances
and special houses, there is more to
be gained from going a house than
there is to be lost, and to advise a
woman to stay away just because the
system is honey-combed with lousy
ness is to expect her to sacrifice per
sonal feelings for a cause where per
sonal sacrifices can't help.
As for the oft-reepated charge of |
snobbishness of sororities, we find at
Stanford that, personally, the women
in even the most aristocratic of
houses make great show of being
"democratic." Which means, of
course, that there is no such thing.
Because democracy does not consist
of being nice to people because the
superiority of your position allows
you to be.
However, there is much less of
what is known as the "codfish aris
tocracy" at Stanford than in other
places. To isolate one instance: the
hasher at Stanford is not looked upon
as a menial but as a fellow student.
This does not hold true at California.
S.C., U.C.L.A., or at other major col
leges 011 the Coast.
However, the simple fact that some
are among the chosen and some are
not, that there are actually tears and
terror in Roble, points a little moral
in that whereas, personally, the sor
ority women may be democratic, the
system, itself, is not.
The Others Pay
It has been pointed out, above, that
there are advantages to be derived
from sororities. But it should be un
derstood that those advantages are
realized at the expense of those who
are not bid to sororities and cannot
avail themselves of those advantages.
It is impossible to deny that there
are many who want to go who can't.
It is likewise impossible to deny that
those who nee dthe advantages of
the sorority the most are the ones
least likely to get in. That these al
ready badly-maladjusted personali
ties must be subjected further to the

cruel shock of the cool and deliber
ate processes of sorority bidding is a
fact that brings into question the eth
ics of a system which elevates the
few by penalizing the many.

However, the simple fact that some

It has been pointed out, above, that
there are advantages to be derived
from sororities. But it should be un
derstood that those advantages are
realized at the expense of those who
are not bid to sororities and cannot
avail themselves of those advantages.
It is impossible to deny that there
are many who want to go who can't.
It is likewise impossible to deny that
those who nee dthe advantages of
the sorority the most are the ones
least likely to get in. That these al
ready badly-maladjusted personali
ties must be subjected further to the

cruel shock of the cool and deliber
ate processes of sorority bidding is a
fact that brings into question the eth
ics of a system which elevates the
few by penalizing the many.
r jPO GO or not to go— that is the
question now haunting the
minds of rushed Robleites. Along
the dormitory corridors cow-ses
sions occur nightly into the wee
hours. There the girls gather in
cold cream and curlers to (ell their
sorority sob-stories, and perhaps
indulge in a satisfying fit or two of
hysterics.
Roble routine is hopelessly up
set. Chocolate-flake ice cream, or
dinarily a universal favorite, is left
untouched in the dining room
while the more fortunate fresh
women dine up the Row and the
disappointed damsels retire, wail
ing, into the privacy of their own
rooms. Harried sponsors work
overtime giving motherly advice to
the rushed and sympathetic con
solation to the non-rushed.
Still another freshman faction
exists. Members of this group
neither grin nor groan—they give
lengthy dissertations on the evils of
sorority organization to anyone
who cares or doesn't care to listen.
These cynics have comparatively
little to worry about, however,
since they are almost invariably
among those who aren't being
rushed.

That is not to say that there aren't
many functions that a sorority house
can fill. Sororities can be great edu
cative factors in smoothing out per
sonality difficulties, in teaching
women how to get along with others,
and they also are very valuable in
giving women a sense of something
to tie to. Though there is some cant
and hypocrisy, cliquishness and petty i
back-biting in a sorority, in the lone- '
lioess of the college milieu the soror- i
ity forms the function of the port in
the storm.
It is true that in one or two sorori
ties on the campus "every one plucks
her eyebrows the same way," and the
girls' can wear their clothes only in
certain ways. However, the girls who
pledge those houses are pledging the
type of house, whether they like it or
not, which fi htst morfeoshrdluet
not, which fits them for a kind of so
ciety which proceeds in that fashion.
Most of them like it.
Roble WaiTs
So much to the good. But this aca
demic account of what is not pretty
with the rushing system doesn't al
leviate the wailing wall in Roble, and
it doesn't help in makin gany deci
sions, because it is not intended to
toll a Robleite that she shouldn't go
a house, and she is the only one who
can decide what house to go. Be
cause, barring special circumstances
and special houses, there is more to
be gained from going a house than
there is to be lost, and to advise a
woman to stay away just because the
system is honey-combed with lousy
ness is to expect her to sacrifice per
sonal feelings for a cause where per
sonal sacrifices can't help.
As for the oft-reepated charge of |
snobbishness of sororities, we find at
Stanford that, personally, the women
in even the most aristocratic of
houses make great show of being
"democratic." Which means, of
course, that there is no such thing.
Because democracy does not consist
of being nice to people because the
superiority of your position allows
you to be.
However, there is much less of
what is known as the "codfish aris

toll a Robleite that she shouldn't go
a house, and she is the only one who
can decide what house to go. Be
cause, barring special circumstances
and special houses, there is more to
be gained from going a house than
there is to be lost, and to advise a
woman to stay away just because the
system is honey-combed with lousy
ness is to expect her to sacrifice per
sonal feelings for a cause where per
sonal sacrifices can't help.
As for the oft-reepated charge of |
snobbishness of sororities, we find at
Stanford that, personally, the women
in even the most aristocratic of
houses make great show of being
"democratic." Which means, of
course, that there is no such thing.
Because democracy does not consist
of being nice to people because the
superiority of your position allows
you to be.
However, there is much less of
what is known as the "codfish aris
tocracy" at Stanford than in other
places. To isolate one instance: the
hasher at Stanford is not looked upon
as a menial but as a fellow student.
This does not hold true at California.

However, the simple fact that some
are among the chosen and some are
not, that there are actually tears and
terror in Roble, points a little moral
in that whereas, personally, the sor

system, itself, is not.
The Others Pay
It has been pointed out, above, that
there are advantages to be derived
from sororities. But it should be un
derstood that those advantages are
realized at the expense of those who
are not bid to sororities and cannot
avail themselves of those advantages.
It is impossible to deny that there
are many who want to go who can't.
It is likewise impossible to deny that
those who nee dthe advantages of
the sorority the most are the ones
least likely to get in. That these al
ready badly-maladjusted personali
ties must be subjected further to the

cruel shock of the cool and deliber
ate processes of sorority bidding is a
fact that brings into question the eth
ics of a system which elevates the
few by penalizing the many.
r jPO GO or not to go— that is the
question now haunting the
minds of rushed Robleites. Along
the dormitory corridors cow-ses
sions occur nightly into the wee
hours. There the girls gather in
cold cream and curlers to (ell their
sorority sob-stories, and perhaps
indulge in a satisfying fit or two of
hysterics.
Roble routine is hopelessly up
set. Chocolate-flake ice cream, or
dinarily a universal favorite, is left
untouched in the dining room
while the more fortunate fresh
women dine up the Row and the
disappointed damsels retire, wail
ing, into the privacy of their own
rooms. Harried sponsors work
overtime giving motherly advice to
the rushed and sympathetic con
solation to the non-rushed.
Still another freshman faction
exists. Members of this group
neither grin nor groan—they give
lengthy dissertations on the evils of
sorority organization to anyone
who cares or doesn't care to listen.
These cynics have comparatively
little to worry about, however,
since they are almost invariably
among those who aren't being
rushed.

That is not to say that there aren't
many functions that a sorority house
can fill. Sororities can be great edu
cative factors in smoothing out per
sonality difficulties, in teaching
women how to get along with others,
and they also are very valuable in
giving women a sense of something
to tie to. Though there is some cant
and hypocrisy, cliquishness and petty i
back-biting in a sorority, in the lone- '
lioess of the college milieu the soror- i
ity forms the function of the port in
the storm.
It is true that in one or two sorori
ties on the campus "every one plucks
her eyebrows the same way," and the
girls' can wear their clothes only in
certain ways. However, the girls who
pledge those houses are pledging the
type of house, whether they like it or
not, which fi htst morfeoshrdluet
not, which fits them for a kind of so
ciety which proceeds in that fashion.
Most of them like it.

So much to the good. But this aca
