Breakers Club announces the
membership of Bill Paulman, '38.

¥N those few lines of type at the
bottom of Daily columns last week
was the most startling change in af
filiation to take place within the
memory of this Stanford generation.
Touchy subjects also are to be
handled with gloves. But The Daily
is breaking its time-honored rule be
cause it feels that truth in this case
is much preferable to ugly rumor,
that history-making events should be
treated as such.
One of the most powerful hall men,
member of one of the most powerful
clubs, breaks with the club and joins
one of the most powerful fraternities.
Two days later he is back with the
club. Why? Whether it has a right
to or not, Stanford is asking that
question.
May Be Her, Yet"
Paulman, quiet, unassuming, good
natured, was and is a member of
Breakers. Until he suffered a broken
ankle in scrimmage last quarter and
was forced to drop out of school, he
was boomed to be the saviour of the
Big Red Machine, may be its hero
next fall.
Paulman had been homo in Ox
nard, and Jack Rogers, Breakers
member from Ventura, had reserved
him a room in Toyon on request of a
letter received last quarter. Rogers
saw Paulman during the Christmas
holidays and collected the $."> deposit
without a murmur.
Paulman returned to school Mon-
I day.
| But he didn't show up at the club

to eat.
Simultaneous with Paulman's re
turn, there arrived at the Phi Dolt
house a letter from an old alumn liv
ing in Santa Barbara, saying that
Paulman was willing to go Phi Delt,
that he had turned in his resignation
to the Breakers 30 days before. Bob
Forward, Phi Delt president, looked
up Paulman in his Toyon room, and
pledged him, using a house vote of
two years ago, in order to save time
voting him in.
Forward called The Daily Monday
afternoon, and the first that the
Breakers heard of it was at that time,
when a reporter called club members
to verify it.
At 11 o'clock that night Paulman
dropped into the Encina room of Rog
Munger, Breakers manager and a
good friend of the ex-patriate, men
tioned his action, explained that he
wasn't leaving the club for personal
reasons, that his family was anxious
for him to join a fraternity, that his
friends in the club were going to
graduate this year.
The next day (Tuesday) the
Breakers discussed the matter in
hushed tones, hardly believing it to
be true, resenting the fact they had
not been notified, wondering as did
the rest of the campus, "What the
Phi Delts had offered him."
Vote To Accept
At a meeting that noon, they talked
it over, voting, after discussion, to
accept him, if lie could be persuaded
to return.
That night a committee of four
Breakers and one Toto entertained
Paulman in Toyon. There it devel
oped that an uncle and an aunt in
San Jose had been pro-Phi Delting
him during his hospital stay last fall;
his sister, a Uclan, acted for Phi Delt
alumn from Santa Barbara who was
