The
SCRAPBOOK
(Clipped by Phil Bernheim)
GUESS WHO â€” That's right, the
grinning mug down there belongs to
"Baby-killer" Fred Clark, and the
cut is a reproduction of his year-end
greetings. Gil Gist did the drawing.
Clever, what?
CHANGES: Paul Pendarvis re
places Bernie Cummins at the Palace
February 2 . . . Virginia Haig has
finally left Carl Ravazza-Ravel . . .
Dick Powell left Hollywood Hotel
'cause Warner Bros, want to use him
on a radio program of their own.
SWAN SONG: We took a look at
our journalism grades the other day,
and they were not encouraging.
Hence, this is the last Scrapbook.
G'bye.
