# Mattson Boy Found Slain Near Everett
## Local Youth Sees Nude Body; F.B.I. Agents Start in 'Tim' Search 
### 
EVERETT, Wash., Jan. 11 (U.R).â€”
The body of 10-year-old Charles
Mattson, kidnaped 15 days ago, was
found today in a woods near thus
I'uget Sound lumber port 60 miles
north of the boy's home city of Ta
coma.
The boy had been slain by a heavy
blow which crushed his skull and
knocked out several teeth. The con
dition of the body indicated death
occurred three or four days ago.
FBI Leads Search
Search was started immediately
for an ex-convict believed to be the
man who signed the name "Tim" to
the note which, asking $28,000 ran
som, was left in the home of Dr.
and Mrs. William W. Mattson when
Charles was stolen December 27.
The Federal Bureau of Investi
gation, with a record of having
solved every major kidnaping of the
last several years, led the search.
The denoument was parallel in
many respects to the climax of the
Lindbergh kidnaping, which became
a nation-wide tragedy when the
body of 20-month-old Charles Au
gustus Lindbergh was found in a
shallow grave 73 days after he was
stolen from the home of his parents
in Hopewell, N.J.
Morrow Discovers Body
While in the Lindbergh case, the
famous aviator-father had turned
over $50,000 to the kidnapers, Dr.
William Mattson still was attempt
ing to negotiate payment of $28,000
ransom when 19-year-old Gordon
Morrow, hunting rabbits, stumbled
across the body of little Charles
this afternoon.
The body, stripped, of the clothing
the boy had been wearing when ab
ducted, lay face up in a shallow de
pression, a foot and a half deep, in
a field 300 feet off a secondary high
way near here.
Morrow was chasing a rabbit he
had seen plunge into the brush, but
the instant he saw the nude body
of a child he eralized he had found
the boy for whom all the Northwest
had been searching since Decem
ber 27.
Footprints by Body
''I couldn't do anything for a mo
ment," Morrow said. "I looked
closer as soon as I could shake off
the . feeling of faintness that closed
in on me when I looked at the body
with its crushed head.
"Then I noticed a fresh trail of
footprints leading to the body. I
ran home and told by father: "Dad, I
think I have found the Mattson boy."
Everett police and Snohomish
County sheriff's deputies were noti
fied, and they in turn informed
police and FBI agents at Tacoma.
Hoover Starts Drive
Tacoma Chief of Police William B.
Scars and three aids tonight left on
