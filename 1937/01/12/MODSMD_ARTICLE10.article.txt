LONDON, Jan. 11 (U.R).â€”Sir Sam
uel Hoare, first lord of the admiralty,
and Sir Ernie Chatfield, first sea
lord and chief of naval staff, visited
the Foreign Office today. It was
understood they conferred with For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden re
garding the position of British ves
sels in waters off Spain and Spanish
Morocco.
As they conferred, it was learned
that the government had moved to
obtain direct reports on alleged Ger
man activities in Spanish Morocco
which have roused French anxiety
to fever pitch.
British sources received what they
believed to be authentic news that,
in addition to representations to
Spanish Nationalist authorities,
France had warned Germany direct
that she would not tolerate foreign
encroachment in Spanish Morocco.
