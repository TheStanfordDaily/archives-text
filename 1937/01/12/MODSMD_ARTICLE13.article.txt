### LYMAN WEAR 
With the return of Professor Le
land T. Chapin, faculty debate ad
viser, Stanford debating opens a va
ried program of forensic activities
tor the winter and spring quarters.
The first meeting of men, women,
and freshmen will be held this af
ternoon at 4 o'clock in room 202,
English Building. Debate Manager
Edward Lindblom asks that all in
terested attend this meeting.
Transoceanic Debate Planned
Outstanding on the debate pro
gram is the tentative transoceanic
radio debate with the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, negotiations
for which are now being opened with
the National Broadcasting Company.
During his studies at Edinburgh,
Professor Chapin successfully made
arrangements with University and
radio authorities there to celebrate
the 150 th anniversary of the found
ing of the Dialectic Society by a
debate between Edinburgh and Stan
ford.
Stanford has accepted an invita
tion to send a team of two to the
University of Hawaii, probably dur
ing spring vacation. During the lat
ter part of this quarter a debate team
will travel to Salem, Oregon, to
participate in the Pacific Forensic
League Conference. It is probable
that this tour will be extended into
Canada to include a debate with the
University of British Columbia, fol
lowing contests with Washington and
Oregon Universities.
Drake on Docket
Other scheduled debates include
one with Drake University of lowa
on February 8, to be held here, and
another February 28 at San Quen
tin on the topic, "Resolved: That
modern civilization kills personal
ity." Drake University placed sec
ond in the national Pi Kappa Delta
tournament and its clash with Stan
ford will feature the cross-question
type of debate, an unusual departure
from the traditional form of debate.
Plans also include a series of radio
debates over station KQW at San
Jose, the number of which will de
pend upon the size of the squad
which meets today. Several de
bates were held over this station last
quarter.
Tour in Sight
Other debates include a team tour
during March into the Southwest or
the Rocky Mountain district to de
bate on a variety of issues with lead
ing schools; the University of Cali
fornia Senate, the College of the
Pacific tournament, the Common
wealth, and the Joffre debates. The
forty-fourth annual debate for the
Medaille Joffre will be held during
the spring quarter and will termi
nate activities as the outstanding
debate of the year.
To round out this schedule, addi
tional debates will be arranged in
the next few weeks. "As is true of
all debates for the coming quarter,
teams have not yet been chosen and
places on them arc open to all de
baters," emphasized Debate Man
ager Edward Lindblom.

In an effort to strengthen the
women's place in Stanford debating,
Women's Debate Manager Mary
Morris Boggs announced an en
larged debate schedule for this quar
ter.
Women interested will meet this
afternoon at 4 o'clock in room 202,
English Building, with men and
frosh debaters. Debate Manager
Edward Lindblom stresses the fact
that plans are being made to include
women in a great number of debates,
including one on the debate with
Drake University of lowa, to be
held here February 8; and others on
the Commonwealth and Joffre de
bate squads and radio debates over
station KQW.
A mixed team will also present a
popular campus debate early this
quarter. To make their debate work
even more interesting for this quar
ter, Miss Boggs announces that ex
clusively women's teams will have
ample opportunity to meet other
colleges and universities. The mat
ter of the Stanford gentler sex tour
ing on debates is being discussed
with Dean Mary Yost now.

wealth, and the Joffre debates. The
forty-fourth annual debate for the
Medaille Joffre will be held during
the spring quarter and will termi
nate activities as the outstanding
debate of the year.
To round out this schedule, addi
tional debates will be arranged in
the next few weeks. "As is true of
all debates for the coming quarter,
teams have not yet been chosen and
places on them arc open to all de
baters," emphasized Debate Man
ager Edward Lindblom.

In an effort to strengthen the
women's place in Stanford debating,
Women's Debate Manager Mary
Morris Boggs announced an en
larged debate schedule for this quar
ter.
Women interested will meet this
afternoon at 4 o'clock in room 202,
English Building, with men and
frosh debaters. Debate Manager
Edward Lindblom stresses the fact
that plans are being made to include
women in a great number of debates,
including one on the debate with
Drake University of lowa, to be
held here February 8; and others on
the Commonwealth and Joffre de
bate squads and radio debates over
station KQW.
A mixed team will also present a
popular campus debate early this
quarter. To make their debate work
even more interesting for this quar
ter, Miss Boggs announces that ex
clusively women's teams will have
ample opportunity to meet other
colleges and universities. The mat
ter of the Stanford gentler sex tour
ing on debates is being discussed
with Dean Mary Yost now.
With the return of Professor Le
land T. Chapin, faculty debate ad
viser, Stanford debating opens a va
ried program of forensic activities
tor the winter and spring quarters.
The first meeting of men, women,
and freshmen will be held this af
ternoon at 4 o'clock in room 202,
English Building. Debate Manager
Edward Lindblom asks that all in
terested attend this meeting.
Transoceanic Debate Planned
Outstanding on the debate pro
gram is the tentative transoceanic
radio debate with the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, negotiations
for which are now being opened with
the National Broadcasting Company.
During his studies at Edinburgh,
Professor Chapin successfully made
arrangements with University and
radio authorities there to celebrate
the 150 th anniversary of the found
ing of the Dialectic Society by a
debate between Edinburgh and Stan
ford.
Stanford has accepted an invita
tion to send a team of two to the
University of Hawaii, probably dur
ing spring vacation. During the lat
ter part of this quarter a debate team
will travel to Salem, Oregon, to
participate in the Pacific Forensic
League Conference. It is probable
that this tour will be extended into
Canada to include a debate with the
University of British Columbia, fol
lowing contests with Washington and
Oregon Universities.
Drake on Docket
Other scheduled debates include
one with Drake University of lowa
on February 8, to be held here, and
another February 28 at San Quen
tin on the topic, "Resolved: That
modern civilization kills personal
ity." Drake University placed sec
ond in the national Pi Kappa Delta
tournament and its clash with Stan
ford will feature the cross-question
type of debate, an unusual departure
from the traditional form of debate.
Plans also include a series of radio
debates over station KQW at San
Jose, the number of which will de
pend upon the size of the squad
which meets today. Several de
bates were held over this station last
quarter.
Tour in Sight
Other debates include a team tour
during March into the Southwest or
the Rocky Mountain district to de
bate on a variety of issues with lead
ing schools; the University of Cali
fornia Senate, the College of the
Pacific tournament, the Common
wealth, and the Joffre debates. The
forty-fourth annual debate for the
