# Ex Committee On Job Tonight
## Election Shift, Nitery Will Be Considered 
### 
After a week's delay due to Presi
dent Jim Reynolds' prolonged trip
in the East, Ex Committee will roll
up its sleeves tonight to get down to
the business of the quarter.
Most important question to go
under the gavel will be the proposed
election change, suggested in De
cember by Barbara Kimball, Wom
en's Conference president.
Election Findings
Reynolds' subcommittee will re
port its findings on whether it thinks
desirable to shift the principal AS.
S.U. elections from May up to Feb
ruary and to change administrations
to spring quarter from fall quarter.
Some Ex Committeemen seem to
think that while the voting shift
would be advantageous, officers still
should be inducted in September.
Plan Union Nitery
Nitery plans—made separately by
various campus agencies—will be
co-ordinated so that some imme
diate work can be done. Most prob
able solution to the problem is a
nitery in the Union.
Other items on the night's docket:
the California Youth Act and grant
ing of Concert Series dates.
Reynolds and Miss Kimball, who
also attended the National Student
Federation of America convention in
New York, will report to the com
mittee the eastern confab's findings
in regard to student government,
discipline control, and other aspects
of campus life.
