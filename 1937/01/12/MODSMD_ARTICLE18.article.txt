Drafting of a California Youth Act,

The youth act, as formulated by
the more than .*5OO delegates repre

the setting up of a State Youth Com
mission, under the departments of
labor and education, and including
representatives of youth, school ad
ministrations, and social service
workers, which would administer
projects. Two immediate tiisks for
the commission would be "to conduct

a survey of the needs of young peo
ple" and upon the basis of this sur
vey to establish youth centers and
"such projects as will benefit the
most needy young people."
Wage provisions in the act are a
minimum per month of $10 for high
school students, $20 for college stu
dents, and $,'lO for unemployed youth.
The bill also provides for supple
mentary aid to youth on NYA proj
ects. Clauses in the act stipulate that
projects under the youth commission
be of "a non-military nature" and
prohibit discrimination for any rea
son whatsoever.
A three months' campaign for the

Drafting of a California Youth Act,
and planning for and organizing the
campaign for the passage of the bill,
were the two chief accomplishments
of the Northern California Assembly
of Youth, meeting in San Francisco
on Saturday and Sunday.
The youth act, as formulated by
the more than .*5OO delegates repre
senting approximately 150 youth or
ganizations in Northern California
who attended the Assembly, proposes
the setting up of a State Youth Com
mission, under the departments of
labor and education, and including
representatives of youth, school ad
ministrations, and social service
workers, which would administer
projects. Two immediate tiisks for
the commission would be "to conduct

a survey of the needs of young peo
ple" and upon the basis of this sur
vey to establish youth centers and
"such projects as will benefit the
most needy young people."
Wage provisions in the act are a
minimum per month of $10 for high
school students, $20 for college stu
dents, and $,'lO for unemployed youth.
The bill also provides for supple
mentary aid to youth on NYA proj
ects. Clauses in the act stipulate that
projects under the youth commission
be of "a non-military nature" and
prohibit discrimination for any rea
son whatsoever.
A three months' campaign for the
passage of the California Youth Act
is planned by the continuations com
mittee of the Assembly, which is
headed by Mrs. Claudia Williams of
the San Francisco Y.W.C.A. Stanford

members of the committee are Pat
Hamilton of the "Y" and Jackie

After conferences on January 17
with legislators who will introduce
the bill, the measure will be intro
duced into the state assembly. Spe
cific features planned for the lobby
ing campaign include petitions, mass
meetings, and delegation marches to
Sacramento at the time of hearings
on the bill. An appropriation of be
tween 10 and 15 million dollars will,
be sought for the youth act for its
first year of operation.
