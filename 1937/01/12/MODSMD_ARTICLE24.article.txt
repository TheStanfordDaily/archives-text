# Jim Reynolds Back From Convention
## 'Liberalism on Increase,' Is Prexy's Impression Of N.S.F.A. Meeting 
### JOHN RICE 
Student liberalism, long a bugaboo
of reactionary U.S. journalists, is ac
tually on the increase, A.S.S.U.
President Jim Reynolds said yester
day.
Reynolds returned Saturday from
the National Student Federation of
America's annual convention in New
York City, where he was accompa
nied by Barbara Kimball, Women's
Conference chairman.
Westerners Conservative
Of 210 students who attended the
five-day meeting from 102 different
colleges, Reynolds thought the
Southerners the most conservative,
though they were closely followed by
the Westerners. The Easterners and
Middle Westerners were avidly pro
gressive, seeking among other things
to control dismissals of faculty and
research staffs.
Though the convention started on
December 28, Reynolds did not arrive
until the evening of the thirtieth.
Sadly he explained that his plane
was grounded in Amarillo, Texas.
"Big Jim" came West on the train.
Discuss World Affairs
A much greater interest in both
national and international affairs was
shown by the representatives, espe
cially in their feeling for students in
other countries. It was decided to
continue to help German refugees, as
well as to work for the inter-relation
of the students of the various coun
tries as a peace move.
Strongly for peace at any cost, the
delegates at the convention refused
to endorse the annual "peace strike,"
although they did endorse the United
Student Peace Committee.
Named as a member of the com
mission on neutrality, Stanford's
representatives arrived too late to
(-take part in that discussion, but was
i able to join in several of the plen
i ary sessions.
1 Though originally scheduled for
I Dallas, the locale of the convention
had to be changed at the last minute
because it was impossible for the
negro delegates to find lodging in any
of the hotels in that southern city.
About 5 per cent of the students
were colored.
The American Youth Act was ap
proved unanimously in matter of
principle, but the delegates could
j agree neither in favor of or against
the methods of enforcement and ad
j ministration. Included in this dis
i cussion was a hearty sanction of any
j means of bettering student-faculty
! relations and understanding.
Defend Jerome Davis
Students, both liberal and conserv
| ative, came to the support of former
j Yale Professor of Divinity Jerome
Davis, whose alleged leftist activities
in organizing trade unions is said to
have had unhappy effects on the
properties of several members of the
Yale board of governors. Davis was
removed for these alleged actions,
but the N.S.FA. members voted dis
approval of his dismissal.
Though late in arriving, Reynolds
felt that "The N.S.F.A. convention
was a fine success, in spite of the'va
j rious handicaps that it had to cope
j with in accomplishing its purposeâ€”to
) bring together student thought and
opinion upon subjects directly or in-
I directly related to them."
