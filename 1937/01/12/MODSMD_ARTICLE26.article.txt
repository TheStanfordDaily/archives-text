PKO FRATERNITATA
This is the time of year when
pledging day is too close for comfort
for most fraternities, and this is the
time of year when most of The
Daily's day-to-day scribblers start
writing about the sociological and
odoriferous aspects of the Stanford
fraternity and sorority situation.
Whether The Daily's columns are
still in the grip of a general post-war
cynicism or whether it is just the
fashion to sneer at the whole idea of
fraternity, equality, and brotherhood,
I don't know, but practically all edi
torial comment on the subject runs in
precisely ihe same rut. That rut is
an old one which jogs along to the ef
fect that joining a fraternity is not
the most important thing in life be
cause the fraternity which doesn't
ask you to join may be # wrong about
what a good guy you are and besides
fraternity houses are worthless old
barns where class prejudice, snob
bery, petty jealousies, not to mention
mayhem and kleptomania, all waft
down the long drafty halls along with
the chilling breezes.
♦ * *
Now all these anti-fraternity, and
for that matter, anti-sorority, senti
ments, are noble in conception, for
they are designed to serve as matt
resses to cushion the fall of those
who made a tremendous leap at the
heavenly house of their heart's desire
and missed. But these sentiments,
nobly conceived as they are, are like
a mother telling junior that he isn't
hurt when he falls off his scooter.
Junior, who is hopping around hold
ing a skinned elbow, knows mamma
is all wrong, and I myself have more
than a suspicion that the anti-frater
nity advocates have been compromis
ing with the truth.
Of course, if everybody came to
college to study, fraternities and
sororities would be infinitely less
useful and in demand than monas
tery cells. A public library, though,
offers as much opportunity for pure
learning as does a university, and
iince people come to college in pref
erence to spending four years in a
public library, I presume they want
to get here the social contacts a
roomful of encyclopedias obviously
does not offer.
So then, I cannot exactly fathom I
all this talk about being able to
choose your own friends in a hall.
In a hall, you are choosing them from
a constantly shifting group which has
neither homogeneity nor perma
nence. You may be rooming with j
your best friend, and you may be J
ossed in with a person you'd swear ]
nas your idea of the worst heel. If
rtiu tend to be a loud-mouth, there is
no one in a hall to constantly tone
you down; if you want to be a posi
tive introvert and an anti-social her
.nit, at the end of four years in a hall
A'ith nobody really interested in
lragging you out of your shell, you'll
>e one for life. A fraternity may have
imong its brotherhood more than a
ew slugs, but trying to get along
vith them is undoubtedly good prac
ice in getting along with people in
jeneral. And if you really like a per
son, you can get to know him better
n a fraternity than any place else.
The same, I figure, holds true fora (
orority.
* * *
Furthermore, as romantic as the
\otion of a lone wolf may sound,
•ven the real lone wolf must get
jretty lonely, something like a hall
nan must feel when he comes back
tfter a vacation and finds rooming
around him and with him a strange
group of faces which he remembers
vaguely as people he recognizes but
does not know. On this score, I
would say that the most satisfactory
thing about a fraternity is not only
coming back after one vacation to an
old familiar scene where you are
known and, at worst, tolerated, but
coming back after years out of school
and finding some sort of an anchor
age populated by people who have at
least heard of you.
I would go on with this somewhat
inept pleading for the fraternity
cause to state that social life in a
hall lobby is not quite the same as in
a fraternity living room, and that
there really is something fine about
musty traditions which hang in the
rafters of each house upon the Row,
but I have an idea the wolves will be
upon me for this soon enough as it is.

fraternity houses are worthless old
barns where class prejudice, snob
bery, petty jealousies, not to mention
mayhem and kleptomania, all waft
down the long drafty halls along with
the chilling breezes.
♦ * *
Now all these anti-fraternity, and
for that matter, anti-sorority, senti
ments, are noble in conception, for
they are designed to serve as matt
resses to cushion the fall of those
who made a tremendous leap at the
heavenly house of their heart's desire
and missed. But these sentiments,
nobly conceived as they are, are like
a mother telling junior that he isn't
hurt when he falls off his scooter.
Junior, who is hopping around hold
ing a skinned elbow, knows mamma
is all wrong, and I myself have more
than a suspicion that the anti-frater
nity advocates have been compromis
ing with the truth.
Of course, if everybody came to
college to study, fraternities and
sororities would be infinitely less
useful and in demand than monas
tery cells. A public library, though,
offers as much opportunity for pure
learning as does a university, and
iince people come to college in pref
erence to spending four years in a
public library, I presume they want
to get here the social contacts a
roomful of encyclopedias obviously
does not offer.
So then, I cannot exactly fathom I
all this talk about being able to
choose your own friends in a hall.
In a hall, you are choosing them from
a constantly shifting group which has
neither homogeneity nor perma
nence. You may be rooming with j
your best friend, and you may be J
ossed in with a person you'd swear ]
nas your idea of the worst heel. If
rtiu tend to be a loud-mouth, there is
no one in a hall to constantly tone
you down; if you want to be a posi
tive introvert and an anti-social her
.nit, at the end of four years in a hall
A'ith nobody really interested in
lragging you out of your shell, you'll
>e one for life. A fraternity may have
imong its brotherhood more than a
ew slugs, but trying to get along
vith them is undoubtedly good prac
ice in getting along with people in
jeneral. And if you really like a per
son, you can get to know him better
n a fraternity than any place else.
The same, I figure, holds true fora (
orority.
* * *
Furthermore, as romantic as the
\otion of a lone wolf may sound,
•ven the real lone wolf must get
jretty lonely, something like a hall
nan must feel when he comes back
tfter a vacation and finds rooming
around him and with him a strange
group of faces which he remembers
vaguely as people he recognizes but
does not know. On this score, I
would say that the most satisfactory
thing about a fraternity is not only
coming back after one vacation to an
old familiar scene where you are
known and, at worst, tolerated, but
coming back after years out of school
and finding some sort of an anchor
age populated by people who have at
least heard of you.
I would go on with this somewhat
inept pleading for the fraternity
cause to state that social life in a
hall lobby is not quite the same as in
a fraternity living room, and that
there really is something fine about
musty traditions which hang in the
rafters of each house upon the Row,
but I have an idea the wolves will be
upon me for this soon enough as it is.

ing with the truth.
Of course, if everybody came to
college to study, fraternities and
sororities would be infinitely less
useful and in demand than monas
tery cells. A public library, though,
offers as much opportunity for pure
learning as does a university, and
iince people come to college in pref
erence to spending four years in a
public library, I presume they want
to get here the social contacts a
roomful of encyclopedias obviously
does not offer.
So then, I cannot exactly fathom I
all this talk about being able to
choose your own friends in a hall.
In a hall, you are choosing them from
a constantly shifting group which has
neither homogeneity nor perma
nence. You may be rooming with j
your best friend, and you may be J
ossed in with a person you'd swear ]
nas your idea of the worst heel. If
rtiu tend to be a loud-mouth, there is
no one in a hall to constantly tone
you down; if you want to be a posi
tive introvert and an anti-social her
.nit, at the end of four years in a hall
A'ith nobody really interested in
lragging you out of your shell, you'll
>e one for life. A fraternity may have
imong its brotherhood more than a
ew slugs, but trying to get along
vith them is undoubtedly good prac
ice in getting along with people in
jeneral. And if you really like a per
son, you can get to know him better
n a fraternity than any place else.
The same, I figure, holds true fora (
orority.

Furthermore, as romantic as the
\otion of a lone wolf may sound,
•ven the real lone wolf must get
jretty lonely, something like a hall
nan must feel when he comes back
tfter a vacation and finds rooming
around him and with him a strange
group of faces which he remembers
vaguely as people he recognizes but
does not know. On this score, I
would say that the most satisfactory
thing about a fraternity is not only
coming back after one vacation to an
old familiar scene where you are
known and, at worst, tolerated, but
coming back after years out of school
and finding some sort of an anchor
age populated by people who have at
least heard of you.
I would go on with this somewhat
inept pleading for the fraternity
cause to state that social life in a
hall lobby is not quite the same as in
a fraternity living room, and that
there really is something fine about
musty traditions which hang in the
rafters of each house upon the Row,
but I have an idea the wolves will be
upon me for this soon enough as it is.
