# Hoop Squad To Work On Fundamentals
## Four Practice Sessions Planned This Week For U.C.L.A. Game 
### WALT PETERSON 
With four workouts planned for
this week, up to and including,
Thursday before the conference op- j
ening pair of games with U.C.L.A. in
the Pavilion Friday and Saturday J
nights, varsity basketballers will j
forego practically all drill on offens- ;
ive and defensive methods to regain i
some of the skill in fundamentals
dropped through lack of concentrated
practice during the eastern tour.
Figuring that the trip competition!
did not give the team any well bal
anced practice on dribbling, passing,
shooting from all positions, and other
of the basic arts of basketball, Coach
John Bunn plans to have the squad j
brush up on such things this week.
The seven games of the trip, rea
sons Burin, have given the team an
abundance of offense and defense
strategy experience, and he will rely

on that practice as sufficient to main
tain Cardinal power well above the
Strength of Caddy Works' Westwood
gang.
This year the U.C.L.A. team has
broken forth with a fast break of
fense for the first time, Coach Works
having found a rapid-action com
bination of what amounts to four
forwards and a center that he can
put on the floor. The offense is again
this season built around Long John
Ball, third highest scorer in the con
ference last year, and with him play
Appleby, Keitz, Lueke, and Hays, as
first stringers. Appleby, regarded as
pretty much just another player last
year, has developed into quite a
threat, according to reports of his
play so far this season.
The Bruins last year won only two
of their 12 conference games, but one
of those they took from Stanford.
This year again they don't figure to
be conference winners, having drop
ped their conference starter to U.S.C.
last week, 41-31.
