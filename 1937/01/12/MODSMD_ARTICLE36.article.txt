# NO TICKETS AFTER TODAY
## 
### 
With one-third of available
tickets claimed yesterday for
admittance to the Friday and
Saturday night basketball
games with U.C.L.A. in the Pa
vilion, students will have their
last chance today to get their
pasteboards, procurable free
merely by presentation of stu
dent body cards at B.A.C. of
fices, before the remainder are
put on public sale.
Only 897 ducats for Friday's
contest and 904 for Saturday's
have been taken, leaving about
1890 that are still open to stu
dent option before the alumni
get their crack at them. B.A.C.
offices open at 8:30 a.m. and will
clos at 5:00 this afternoon.
