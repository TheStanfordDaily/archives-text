THE HOOP TEAM,
CHECKING IN:

It's always better for Stanford as a |
whole when athletic teams make a j
long trip during the season, rather
than after it, because the stories the
wayward ones tell in the former case
are more frequently printable. The
hoopmen are back (have you seen
those travelling jackets?), and seem
to have had quite a time!
Following is the composite box
score for the boys covering their first
10 games (seven on the trip, and
Olympic Club, San Jose State, and
Cal Aggies beforehand), with points
scored, successful free throws, free
throw average, and personal fouls
against, in that order:
IPS FT FTP PF
Luisetti, f 143 23 .71 10
Turner, f 83 11 .65 11
Stoefen, c (59 13 .87 20
Moore, g 45 4 .33 22

B. Zonne, g .... 20 10 .83 3
Heath, g 3 1 .33 3
Kessel, f 2 0 .00 4
Only players put out of games fox
four personals, Lee, Moore, Calder
wood 2, and Ashcraft (San Jose
game).

MISCELLANEOUS
TRIMMINGS

Things always seemed to be hap
pening back East. Coach John ("Hot
Cross" they call him) Bunn oblig
ingly spoke for three informal radio
programs. No proponent of smoking
or drinking himself, John alternately
was advertising cigars, beer, and ale.
Hank Luisetti was ostracized for a
full 3G hours in Cleveland. It seems
that a swarthy guy had sauntered up
and asked, "When's da last time ya
saw Crosett', DaMag', an' da poys?"
Luisetti, unacquainted with the more
illustrious alumni of North Beach's
playgrounds, was even more alarmed
when a fake telegram reached him
the last day: "All North Beach awaits
your return. You are now considered
one of us. —Crossett', DaMag', an' da
poys."
Seventeen men made the trip —
travelling over 7000 miles in 21 days
—and played before a combined au
dience of 50,000 people. Besides the
12 players listed above were Coach
Bunn and Manager Vincenti, Doc
Northway, Dale Huff, and Ed Woods,
| the kid who toured Europe with Lui
setti last summer.

ALL CLIMATES
AND NATIONALITIES

Top prices were $1.10 and $2.20 ut
! Madison Square Garden . . . The
J cagers called Temple their toughest
: opponents, score 45-38 . . . Practices
I were held but four times—Denver,
two in Philadelphia, and St. Paul . . .
Hamilne players afterward said that
Stanford could whitewash De Paul,
and De Paul is the cream in the cen
; tral U.S., way ahead of the Big Ten
. . . Warrensburg is very much re
spected in the great plains states . . .
The Cards had dinner with Dr.
Naismith, the originator of basket
ball, in Lawrence, Kansas, and re
ceived autographed pictures from
him . . . Canisius was quite a let
down after Long Island, but the next
game, Western Reserve, was termed
by Bunn as the best this team has
ever turned in, including the Wash-

I ington Series last year . . . Another
i reason for scheduling small schools
j was that the Big Ten and other large
I outfits wouldn't guarantee enough to
cover expenses . . . There was a
riot of 200 disappointed fans outside
the Temple Auditorium when 'the
game was declared a sell-out . . .
The idea of taking Stumps North
way along to prevent the epidemic of
colds occasioned in the Pacific North
west a year ago was a success, as
Kessel's cold and Vineenti's flu were
the only scores . . . Horace Byron
Lee became quite a poet before the
trip was done . . . The weather was
so cold in Montana that they had to
thaw the train's steam lines out
every hundred miles or so . . .
Transparent glass back-boards were
used in the Temple, Long Island, and
W. R. games, and liked by all the
players.

THE HOOP TEAM,
CHECKING IN:

It's always better for Stanford as a |
whole when athletic teams make a j
long trip during the season, rather
than after it, because the stories the
wayward ones tell in the former case
are more frequently printable. The
hoopmen are back (have you seen
those travelling jackets?), and seem
to have had quite a time!
Following is the composite box
score for the boys covering their first
10 games (seven on the trip, and
Olympic Club, San Jose State, and
Cal Aggies beforehand), with points
scored, successful free throws, free
throw average, and personal fouls
against, in that order:

game).

MISCELLANEOUS
TRIMMINGS

Things always seemed to be hap
pening back East. Coach John ("Hot
Cross" they call him) Bunn oblig
ingly spoke for three informal radio
programs. No proponent of smoking
or drinking himself, John alternately
was advertising cigars, beer, and ale.
Hank Luisetti was ostracized for a
full 3G hours in Cleveland. It seems
that a swarthy guy had sauntered up
and asked, "When's da last time ya
saw Crosett', DaMag', an' da poys?"
Luisetti, unacquainted with the more
illustrious alumni of North Beach's
playgrounds, was even more alarmed
when a fake telegram reached him
the last day: "All North Beach awaits
your return. You are now considered
one of us. —Crossett', DaMag', an' da
poys."
Seventeen men made the trip —
travelling over 7000 miles in 21 days
—and played before a combined au
dience of 50,000 people. Besides the
12 players listed above were Coach
Bunn and Manager Vincenti, Doc
Northway, Dale Huff, and Ed Woods,
| the kid who toured Europe with Lui
setti last summer.

ALL CLIMATES
AND NATIONALITIES

Top prices were $1.10 and $2.20 ut
! Madison Square Garden . . . The
J cagers called Temple their toughest
: opponents, score 45-38 . . . Practices
I were held but four times—Denver,
two in Philadelphia, and St. Paul . . .
Hamilne players afterward said that
Stanford could whitewash De Paul,
and De Paul is the cream in the cen
; tral U.S., way ahead of the Big Ten
. . . Warrensburg is very much re
spected in the great plains states . . .
The Cards had dinner with Dr.
Naismith, the originator of basket
ball, in Lawrence, Kansas, and re

THE HOOP TEAM,
CHECKING IN:

It's always better for Stanford as a |
whole when athletic teams make a j
long trip during the season, rather
than after it, because the stories the
wayward ones tell in the former case
are more frequently printable. The
hoopmen are back (have you seen
those travelling jackets?), and seem
to have had quite a time!
Following is the composite box
score for the boys covering their first
10 games (seven on the trip, and
Olympic Club, San Jose State, and
Cal Aggies beforehand), with points
scored, successful free throws, free
throw average, and personal fouls
against, in that order:
IPS FT FTP PF
Luisetti, f 143 23 .71 10
Turner, f 83 11 .65 11
Stoefen, c (59 13 .87 20
Moore, g 45 4 .33 22
Calderwood, g.. 41 7 .43 15
P. Zonne, c .... 45 14 .74 12
Quade, f 10 2 .25 6
Robertson, f ... 24 2 .50 5
Lee, g 8 4 .57 8
B. Zonne, g .... 20 10 .83 3
Heath, g 3 1 .33 3
Kessel, f 2 0 .00 4
Only players put out of games fox
four personals, Lee, Moore, Calder
wood 2, and Ashcraft (San Jose
game).

MISCELLANEOUS
TRIMMINGS

Things always seemed to be hap
pening back East. Coach John ("Hot
Cross" they call him) Bunn oblig
ingly spoke for three informal radio
programs. No proponent of smoking
or drinking himself, John alternately
was advertising cigars, beer, and ale.
Hank Luisetti was ostracized for a
full 3G hours in Cleveland. It seems
that a swarthy guy had sauntered up
and asked, "When's da last time ya
saw Crosett', DaMag', an' da poys?"
Luisetti, unacquainted with the more
illustrious alumni of North Beach's
playgrounds, was even more alarmed
when a fake telegram reached him
the last day: "All North Beach awaits
your return. You are now considered
one of us. —Crossett', DaMag', an' da
poys."
Seventeen men made the trip —
travelling over 7000 miles in 21 days
—and played before a combined au
dience of 50,000 people. Besides the
12 players listed above were Coach
Bunn and Manager Vincenti, Doc
Northway, Dale Huff, and Ed Woods,
| the kid who toured Europe with Lui
setti last summer.
