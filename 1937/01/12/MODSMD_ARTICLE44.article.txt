# Frosh Hoopsters Work on Offense
## 
### 
Whipping jubilantly through their
practice after winning their first two
.starts in the 1937 season, the frosh
basketballers yesterday emulated
John Bunn's "laughing boys" with
their fooling around.
Working mainly on offense, Coach
Gorter used many diffei-ent combina
tions of players against a set defense.
Emphasizing cutting through small
holes in the defense, the mentor had
his boys slicing in from all angles.
This week-end the Encinamen play
the preliminaries to the two U.C.L.A.
games, meeting Sacramento Jaysee
on Friday night, and Modesto Jaysee
the following evening.
