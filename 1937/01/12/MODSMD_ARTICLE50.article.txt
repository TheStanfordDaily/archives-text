# These Edits Are So Filling
## 
### 
After gazing out the window watching the
rain precipitate all over itself in its rather aim
less fashion, I quite suddenly realize that it is
dark. This is not so unusual for this time of year,
nor this time of day, because it is now six o'clock
in the evening, and it dawns on me that there
aren't any edits written.
That in itself is not so unusual, either, be
cause it is usually this time of day, what with
my usual inefficiency, that the edits aren't writ
ten. Hov/ever, there is a special horror today
and it breaks into my autistic state with some
thing of the diabolical persistence of the sopho
more wake-up man on the senior sleeping
porch. It is the incontrovertible fact that I don't
have anything to write edits about today. That
is not to say that there aren't lots of things that
edits could be written about, graft and ineffi
ciency here, bureaucracy and bamboozling
there, inconsistencies of educational policy
there and here, and sleazy thinking there, here,
there, but the incontrovertibility of the morpho
logical organization of matter is such that I don't
have them here to write about.
Ho-Hum
Of course, if I did less snuzzling at the rain
drops and more prowling around the bowels of
the Ad building and the A.S.S.U. bureau of
waits and pressures, I might uncover certain
pejoristic truths, but I have a phototropism that
holds me to my pretty window, which I can
raise and lower if I want to and lean out and
yell at the passing cars, and there is also a
certain warmth to my radiator which I like very
much. In other words, I am lazy.
This laziness I am wont to rationalize from
time to time by looking through the other col
lege papers, which come to the office daily along
with the four franked letters from the Depart
ment of Interior. And I look at their editorial
policies, varying from frequent urgent pleas to
do something about the parking lots, frequent
urgent pleas to abandon compulsory R.0.T.C.,
frequent urgent pleas for students to join the
American Student Union, frequent urgent pleas
for the football team to win a game, frequent
urgent pleas for people to attend the dance re
cital or the concert "for their own good," up to
and including weighty and scholarly disserta
tions upon the state of the nation (which betray
the fact that college editors are still able to mask
their colossal ignorance of politics and its mean
ing with words set in 10-point book type). And
the inevitable conclusion is that students don't
read the edit columns of other college news
papers either.
Goodness Gracious Me
We editors lead a sad and brutish life, search
ing for edits with which to entice the languid
eye of the loutish reader from his buttered snail
to the 18-em columns. The bowel-prowl edit
springs from no inner conviction that things are
rotten to the core, but only through the desire
to arouse conflict, which is supposed to bring
reader interest. The R.0.T.C., parking lot, ants
in Encina, Union coffee edit springs from an
attempt to search for some object that irritates
the students so that they will cry "Bravo" and
lend their support. However, this constant
searching, ferreting, probing for some source
of irritation leads to the development of an
antibody in the body politic. The students be
come used to having their irritations suffered
for them on news print, and adopt an immunity
to the fumings and sputtering of the columnists.
The belching forth in public serves to relieve
the pressure, and this relief of mass irritation
makes the student body into a placid, docile,
contented bovinity, which is more than kin and
less than kine. The "Everybody Let's Join the
A.S.U." edit is an outgrowth of the belief: whee
whoopee and whoopee-whee I'm a gay youth
and I'm radical. When as a matter of fact, there
is nothing more orthodox than a college radical,
and there's nothing more futile than belaboring
the students to adopt your orthodoxy in prefer
ence to their kind of protective coloration, par
ticularly when it is realized that the educational
process is predicated on the assumption of being
psychologically adjusted. Adjustment implies
contentment, and acquiescence. Its natural re
sult is the constipated curiosity. That is all very
fine in a static state (the likes of which, they
say, has never been had). However, our well
adjusted Babbits and our well-adjusted pariahs
are deadly to the inquiring mind and to a vigor
ous editorial policy (but why speak of the
dead?).
Wrackety Wrack
We find, then, that all over the nation, wher
ever there are two professors, a classroom, and

a bar, there is a college editor wracking his
brain tonight in order to fill edit columns. He
is not wracking his precious instrument because
he has something to say, or because the fate
of 3ome cause hangs in the balance. The hack
ing and wracking goes on in order to fill 18-em
columns with Linotype slugs.
Because, for one if anybody sees the managing
editor tell her to come home now, all is forgiven
thing, there is very little to say.
Actually, there are few causes in which the
student body is interested. Consequently, they
don't care what the editor says, as long as he
doesn't use salacious language. For another
thing, the editor realizes that what he says will
have no productive effect, because whatever
he has to say will be laughed at by the admin
istrative officials, who are so sure they know
more about what the student is thinking than
he does and whatever the student thinks is un
important anyhow.
The net effect is that our whole editorial set
up, like the giving of compulsory college com
position courses, is teaching the flower of our
youth to write purple prose, and sterile prose.
Words without meaning. We are learning how
to write, not to reveal thought, but to obscure
thought. We are jousting against feather mat
tresses, debating against echoes, learning that
it is quite all right to go through motions with
out knowing their significance. To occupy our
lives with the supreme importance of nothing
ness. To abandon ourselves to the infinite inter
play between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. It
is a sterile life without meaning, life without
bauty. But we like it. We are well adjusted.

and it breaks into my autistic state with some
thing of the diabolical persistence of the sopho
more wake-up man on the senior sleeping
porch. It is the incontrovertible fact that I don't
have anything to write edits about today. That
is not to say that there aren't lots of things that
edits could be written about, graft and ineffi
ciency here, bureaucracy and bamboozling
there, inconsistencies of educational policy
there and here, and sleazy thinking there, here,
there, but the incontrovertibility of the morpho

have them here to write about.
Ho-Hum
Of course, if I did less snuzzling at the rain
drops and more prowling around the bowels of
the Ad building and the A.S.S.U. bureau of
waits and pressures, I might uncover certain
pejoristic truths, but I have a phototropism that
holds me to my pretty window, which I can
raise and lower if I want to and lean out and
yell at the passing cars, and there is also a
certain warmth to my radiator which I like very
much. In other words, I am lazy.
This laziness I am wont to rationalize from
time to time by looking through the other col
lege papers, which come to the office daily along
with the four franked letters from the Depart
ment of Interior. And I look at their editorial
policies, varying from frequent urgent pleas to
do something about the parking lots, frequent
urgent pleas to abandon compulsory R.0.T.C.,
frequent urgent pleas for students to join the
American Student Union, frequent urgent pleas
for the football team to win a game, frequent
urgent pleas for people to attend the dance re
cital or the concert "for their own good," up to
and including weighty and scholarly disserta
tions upon the state of the nation (which betray
the fact that college editors are still able to mask
their colossal ignorance of politics and its mean
ing with words set in 10-point book type). And
the inevitable conclusion is that students don't
read the edit columns of other college news
papers either.
Goodness Gracious Me
We editors lead a sad and brutish life, search
ing for edits with which to entice the languid
eye of the loutish reader from his buttered snail
to the 18-em columns. The bowel-prowl edit
springs from no inner conviction that things are
rotten to the core, but only through the desire
to arouse conflict, which is supposed to bring
reader interest. The R.0.T.C., parking lot, ants
in Encina, Union coffee edit springs from an
attempt to search for some object that irritates
the students so that they will cry "Bravo" and
lend their support. However, this constant
searching, ferreting, probing for some source
of irritation leads to the development of an
antibody in the body politic. The students be
come used to having their irritations suffered
for them on news print, and adopt an immunity
to the fumings and sputtering of the columnists.
The belching forth in public serves to relieve
the pressure, and this relief of mass irritation
makes the student body into a placid, docile,
contented bovinity, which is more than kin and
less than kine. The "Everybody Let's Join the
A.S.U." edit is an outgrowth of the belief: whee
whoopee and whoopee-whee I'm a gay youth
and I'm radical. When as a matter of fact, there
is nothing more orthodox than a college radical,
and there's nothing more futile than belaboring
the students to adopt your orthodoxy in prefer
ence to their kind of protective coloration, par
ticularly when it is realized that the educational
process is predicated on the assumption of being
psychologically adjusted. Adjustment implies
contentment, and acquiescence. Its natural re
sult is the constipated curiosity. That is all very
fine in a static state (the likes of which, they
say, has never been had). However, our well
adjusted Babbits and our well-adjusted pariahs
are deadly to the inquiring mind and to a vigor
ous editorial policy (but why speak of the
dead?).
Wrackety Wrack
We find, then, that all over the nation, wher
ever there are two professors, a classroom, and

a bar, there is a college editor wracking his
brain tonight in order to fill edit columns. He
is not wracking his precious instrument because
he has something to say, or because the fate
of 3ome cause hangs in the balance. The hack
ing and wracking goes on in order to fill 18-em
columns with Linotype slugs.
Because, for one if anybody sees the managing
editor tell her to come home now, all is forgiven
thing, there is very little to say.
Actually, there are few causes in which the
student body is interested. Consequently, they
don't care what the editor says, as long as he
doesn't use salacious language. For another
thing, the editor realizes that what he says will
have no productive effect, because whatever
he has to say will be laughed at by the admin
istrative officials, who are so sure they know
more about what the student is thinking than
he does and whatever the student thinks is un
important anyhow.
The net effect is that our whole editorial set
up, like the giving of compulsory college com
position courses, is teaching the flower of our
youth to write purple prose, and sterile prose.
Words without meaning. We are learning how
to write, not to reveal thought, but to obscure
thought. We are jousting against feather mat
tresses, debating against echoes, learning that
it is quite all right to go through motions with
out knowing their significance. To occupy our
lives with the supreme importance of nothing
ness. To abandon ourselves to the infinite inter
play between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. It
is a sterile life without meaning, life without
bauty. But we like it. We are well adjusted.
After gazing out the window watching the
rain precipitate all over itself in its rather aim
less fashion, I quite suddenly realize that it is
dark. This is not so unusual for this time of year,
nor this time of day, because it is now six o'clock
in the evening, and it dawns on me that there
aren't any edits written.
That in itself is not so unusual, either, be
cause it is usually this time of day, what with
my usual inefficiency, that the edits aren't writ
ten. Hov/ever, there is a special horror today
and it breaks into my autistic state with some
thing of the diabolical persistence of the sopho
more wake-up man on the senior sleeping

logical organization of matter is such that I don't
have them here to write about.
Ho-Hum
Of course, if I did less snuzzling at the rain
drops and more prowling around the bowels of
the Ad building and the A.S.S.U. bureau of
waits and pressures, I might uncover certain
pejoristic truths, but I have a phototropism that
holds me to my pretty window, which I can
raise and lower if I want to and lean out and
yell at the passing cars, and there is also a
certain warmth to my radiator which I like very
much. In other words, I am lazy.
This laziness I am wont to rationalize from
time to time by looking through the other col
lege papers, which come to the office daily along
with the four franked letters from the Depart
ment of Interior. And I look at their editorial
policies, varying from frequent urgent pleas to
do something about the parking lots, frequent
urgent pleas to abandon compulsory R.0.T.C.,
frequent urgent pleas for students to join the
American Student Union, frequent urgent pleas
for the football team to win a game, frequent
urgent pleas for people to attend the dance re
cital or the concert "for their own good," up to
and including weighty and scholarly disserta
tions upon the state of the nation (which betray
the fact that college editors are still able to mask
their colossal ignorance of politics and its mean
ing with words set in 10-point book type). And
the inevitable conclusion is that students don't
read the edit columns of other college news
papers either.
Goodness Gracious Me
We editors lead a sad and brutish life, search
ing for edits with which to entice the languid
eye of the loutish reader from his buttered snail
to the 18-em columns. The bowel-prowl edit
springs from no inner conviction that things are
rotten to the core, but only through the desire
to arouse conflict, which is supposed to bring
reader interest. The R.0.T.C., parking lot, ants
in Encina, Union coffee edit springs from an
attempt to search for some object that irritates
the students so that they will cry "Bravo" and
lend their support. However, this constant
searching, ferreting, probing for some source
of irritation leads to the development of an
antibody in the body politic. The students be
come used to having their irritations suffered
for them on news print, and adopt an immunity
to the fumings and sputtering of the columnists.
The belching forth in public serves to relieve
the pressure, and this relief of mass irritation
makes the student body into a placid, docile,
contented bovinity, which is more than kin and
less than kine. The "Everybody Let's Join the
A.S.U." edit is an outgrowth of the belief: whee
whoopee and whoopee-whee I'm a gay youth
and I'm radical. When as a matter of fact, there
is nothing more orthodox than a college radical,
and there's nothing more futile than belaboring
the students to adopt your orthodoxy in prefer
ence to their kind of protective coloration, par
ticularly when it is realized that the educational
process is predicated on the assumption of being
psychologically adjusted. Adjustment implies
contentment, and acquiescence. Its natural re
sult is the constipated curiosity. That is all very
fine in a static state (the likes of which, they
say, has never been had). However, our well
adjusted Babbits and our well-adjusted pariahs
are deadly to the inquiring mind and to a vigor
ous editorial policy (but why speak of the
dead?).
Wrackety Wrack
We find, then, that all over the nation, wher
ever there are two professors, a classroom, and

a bar, there is a college editor wracking his
brain tonight in order to fill edit columns. He
is not wracking his precious instrument because
he has something to say, or because the fate
of 3ome cause hangs in the balance. The hack
ing and wracking goes on in order to fill 18-em
columns with Linotype slugs.
Because, for one if anybody sees the managing
editor tell her to come home now, all is forgiven
thing, there is very little to say.
Actually, there are few causes in which the
student body is interested. Consequently, they
don't care what the editor says, as long as he
doesn't use salacious language. For another
thing, the editor realizes that what he says will
have no productive effect, because whatever
he has to say will be laughed at by the admin
istrative officials, who are so sure they know
more about what the student is thinking than
he does and whatever the student thinks is un
important anyhow.
The net effect is that our whole editorial set
up, like the giving of compulsory college com
position courses, is teaching the flower of our
youth to write purple prose, and sterile prose.
Words without meaning. We are learning how
to write, not to reveal thought, but to obscure
thought. We are jousting against feather mat
tresses, debating against echoes, learning that
it is quite all right to go through motions with
out knowing their significance. To occupy our
lives with the supreme importance of nothing
ness. To abandon ourselves to the infinite inter
play between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. It
is a sterile life without meaning, life without
bauty. But we like it. We are well adjusted.
After gazing out the window watching the
rain precipitate all over itself in its rather aim
less fashion, I quite suddenly realize that it is
dark. This is not so unusual for this time of year,
nor this time of day, because it is now six o'clock
in the evening, and it dawns on me that there
aren't any edits written.
That in itself is not so unusual, either, be
cause it is usually this time of day, what with
my usual inefficiency, that the edits aren't writ
ten. Hov/ever, there is a special horror today
and it breaks into my autistic state with some
thing of the diabolical persistence of the sopho
more wake-up man on the senior sleeping
porch. It is the incontrovertible fact that I don't
have anything to write edits about today. That
is not to say that there aren't lots of things that
edits could be written about, graft and ineffi
ciency here, bureaucracy and bamboozling
there, inconsistencies of educational policy
there and here, and sleazy thinking there, here,
there, but the incontrovertibility of the morpho
logical organization of matter is such that I don't
have them here to write about.
