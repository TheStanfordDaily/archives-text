# BULL SESSION
## PUBLIC ENEMY OF THE YEAR 
### 
The fan magazines won't tell you, but Boris Karloff
is not Frankenstein. He may be Frankenstein's brother,
but the real Frankie is a guy named Big Double Bill.
And what Bill does to Hollywood would make Boris's
Number 3 eyelash green with envy.
Double Bill is a ghost. He materializes only on
Hollywood balance sheets. But since Time has nomi
nated a woman as Man of the Year, a ghost is cer
tainly eligible as Enemy of the Year.

He would win hands down if the movie maker, ex
hibitor, or customer had anything to say about it. But
they haven't. Double Bill drowns them out.
He speaks through more loudspeakers than Presi
dent Roosevelt. Omniscient Bill divides quicker than
the amoeba, and hi;> incarnationa haunt the country's
theaters night and day.
Greater in number than Santa Clauses at Christmas,
and unlike Santa, knowing no season, Double Bill will
make you miserable any time, any where, for as little
as a dime, as much as six-bits.

He is a real Frankenstein to all of Hollywood. Since
he came, during the depression as a narcotic incarnate
to revive a flagging business, he has made the average
movie lousier and lousier, and established an economic
addiction that all Hollywood's smart doctors can't break.
At first. Double Bill said: "Let me make your dough.
All you have to do is spread your operating budgets
on twice as many lousy pictures, and you'll get people
to see them on the basis that they're getting two pictures
for the price of one."
Hollywood did, and people did. Then times picked
up and the studios said: "Thanks, Double Bill, you've
been a great help. So long."
But Double Bill said: "So long, hell! What would
happen if you were the only studio that shot half your
schedule this year!"
* * * *
So he stuck the unstickable. With rising prices, with
a trend to better pictures, Hollywood has to continue to
produce enough movies to fill each house twice over.
And to make it doubly difficult to break Double
Bills' headlock, dozens of small producers have entered
the field to supply the lesser half of the two-feature
program, renting space and equipment at the big stu
dios, and building up capital. They can't be dumped
overnight.
Meanwhile, so diverse has the business become that
producers can't sign a pact promising no more compe
tition, nor can they agree that competition will be by
quality, not quantity. There is over-production. And
the only way out is for your company to produce more
pictures this year than last, so it will get a bigger share
of the profits.
Double-Bill, as Enemy of the Year, even Time
should double-bill y?>u!
