### 
It being difficult to think up new things to say during
sorority rushing, I think I am performing a real service
to suffering humanity by recording novel conversations
overheard on the Row over the week-end. It should
serve as a pattern for all novel conversations in the
future.
Paished: How many girls do you have in the house?
Rusher: About 30.
Rushed: Well, are they all here at the table?
Rusher: Er, no.
R.: Well, I don't see where they would be eating,
then, do you?
R.: Er.
At another house this pitter-patter was overheard:
R.: What's the hasher's name?
R.: Oh, that's Leviticus.
R.: What's he do? .
R.: Lives at the Firehouse.
R.: My, isn't he brave and fearless? Who is that?
R.: That's Hook. He is a boxer.
R.: My, isn't he big and strong and handsome! And
who is that?
R.: That's McGulp, he is working for his Ph.D.
R.: My, isn't he intelligent and understanding. And
who is that hasher?
R.:Oh, that is Our Hasher.

ist went into the sociological aspects of hashing.
