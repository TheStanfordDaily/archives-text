# THE
						REVIEWER
## THE
						SYMPHONY BEGINS 
### 
With a repetition of its Friday
afternoon concert, the musical range
of which speaks well for future con
certs, the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction of
Pierre Monteux, opened its series of
Saturday evening concerts last week.
The program began with the Suite
in D Major of Bach. It is seldom that
a reviewer is given opportunity to
comment on other than the conduc
tor's achievements or lack of them,
so it is with great pleasure that I
record that it was here that the trum
pet section went thoroughly amuck;
still, one can sympathize with the un
happy trio, for it would seem that
Bach must have written those parts
expressly to work out a grudge of
long standing on all trumpeters.
However, such technical matters
would not mar the beauty of the slow
movement, the '"Air," nor the unde
niable appeal of the whole work.
The final half of the concert was
devoted to that symphonic monu
ment, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5.
Due largely to matters of tempo, this
was played with a typo of vigor, al
most a vivacity at times, not usually
associated with this work: rather
than the omnipotent "Fate knocking
at the door," one might better picture
in the vitality, a part of Mr. Mon
teux's own character, this musical
Barnacle Bill as challenging Oppor
tunity. The same vitality typified the
whole symphony, even the .slow sec
ond movement. However, the fresh
ness which it imparted was by no
means unwelcome, and the soundness

I of such an interpretation is unques
j tionable.
All in all, the whole concert was
an excellent opening to the series,
and certainly suggests that the season
will be like little girls: "sugar and
spice, and all things nice."

"LA MATERNELLE," at the Varsity
Theater.
There's something about "La Ma-
I ternelle," produced in France almost
two years ago, which has so far es
caped American film-makers. Just
; this — that little children are never
i better in pictures than when they
are just a bunch of dirty little chil
dren.
Acclaimed as one of the best pic
tures filmed anywhere in 1935, "La
Maternelle" tells the vital, human
story of the waifs of the Montmartre,
cheap night-club district of Paris. Its
characters, a hundred or more
French children, live a sordid life—
crammed into a little school in the
day time and into ugly garrets at
night.
Little Paulette Flambert is unbe
lievably real as Marie, the lonely
little daughter of a street walker.
When she loses her mother to an
"admirer," she develops an intense
hatred of men. And when Rose, the
tender maid who befriends her at
school, falls in love, too, Marie at
tempts a pitiful suicide.
"La Maternelle" isn't a "nice"
movie. There's nothing of the Shir
ley Temple-Dickie Moore element in

the moppets of the 'Montmartre. Ditty
and filthy, all they want is loving
kindness. These kids aren't acting—
they're living. And you won't need
the English titles (which are there
anyway) to know it.
France may well be proud of this
film—it's a picture of a Paris you
probably know little about.
