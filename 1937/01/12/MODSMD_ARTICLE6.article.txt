# Newly Unionized Group Wants Higher Wages
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Janitorial Foreman J. M. Brown
Is troubled about the distrustful at
titude lately among campus mop
stei's.
"When I see a group of the boys,
they are always talking in low
tones," he said, worriedly. "But as
soon as I come near, I am met by a
thunderous silence."
"I can see no justification for this,"
he continued. "No complaint has
ever reached me that hasn't been
settled satisfactorily. They all think
of me as a son-of-a-gun now, but
when they ai'e through organizing
they will be my friends again, as
before."
Want Higher Wages
A subdivision of San Francisco's
Local 87, the campus janitors' or
ganization is determined to get high
er wages and better living conditions.
The present monthly wage, accord
ing to Brown, ranges from $80 to
$120. One man only is paid the
latter.
But $35 is deducted each month to
pay for the company-furnished room
and board.
Although Brown doesn't think the
union will be successful, he declared
that collective bargaining, if man
aged properly, is "swell."
Stanford Opposes Closed Shop
The University's attitude on the
subject was made known by Comp
troller Roth last night. He said, "The
University is' absolutely opposed to
any closed-shop arrangement here
on the campus; it can't be dictated to
by a union or any other organiza
tion."
The closed shop Is a fundamental
objective of the new union.
Intimidation of those opposing
unionization is suspected by Fore
man Brown, according to a state
ment lie made yesterday.
Violence Rumored
Brown had no certain information
on the subject, but he passed on the
rumor that one man had l>een fright
ened by the tales of some of the
pro-unionists. A man was pushed
down a flight of stairs, went the
rumor, the fall breaking out most of
his teeth; after that the pushce was
a loyal union man.
According to Brown, one man who
opposed formation of the union was
so terrified that he kept an iron pipe
and a large pile of rocks in his
room. Brown reassured and com
forted him.
Most of the discontent among the
men, says Brown, is due to misun
derstanding of the inequalities of
wages. Some of them don't 'realize
"that higher pay must be given to
those v/ho clean out rooms where
there are stiffs lying around."
