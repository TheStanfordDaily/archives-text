# Pan-Hellenic Ends Week With Saturday Dances
## 
### 
Open houses and jolly-ups in
honor of the pledges will be held at
the nine sorority houses Saturday
night, when the Stanford rough will
be invited to come and look over the
new women. The houses' entertain
ment for their pledges climaxes a
week of rushing.
Orchestras will be featured at
some sororities, and refreshments
will be served. Following the jolly
ups, which will begin soon after 8
o'clock and will continue until about
10, the pledges will spend the night
at their respective houses.
The freshmen women will be offi
cially notified of the sororities to
which they are to go by a public ac
countant who has previously com
pared their preference accords and
the bid lists. The accountant will be
at Roble after dinner Saturday night.
Alumni members of Cap and
Gown, women's honorary extra
curricular society, will then take
the pledges up the Row in their cars
to be received by their new sisters.
Second period of women's rush
ing will end today with luncheon
dates for approximately 180 fresh
men women at the nine houses.
Third and last period of rushing will
include preference dinners tomorrow
and Friday nights, at which both
rushees and rushers are enabled to
get a clearer idea of what the final
bidding will be.
Luncheon dates today will be from
12 to 1:30 o'clock, and dinners from
6 to 8 o'clock. All rushees must be
out of the houses by that time. So
rority women are not permitted to
take their guests home.
Quad clothes will be worn to the
luncheon today and formals to the
preference night dinners.
