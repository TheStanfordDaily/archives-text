# Manager Gives Inside Facts on Co-op
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
"Gooflow for cooking" was the
telephoned request of one of the
Chinese cooks. It took Mr. Ayres
some time to find that Swansdown
Cake Flour was the article in ques
tion. "Goose flour" was all the cook
i could remember.
This was just another incident in
the work of Mr. Elliott. Ayres, man
ager of the Student Co-operative,
which supplies food, fuel, and means
of garbage disposal to two of ihe
eating clubs and most, of the houses.
Food Orders Change
To the statistician would seem
j significant the changes in food orders
! during rushing time. Mr. Ayres i?
I troubled by requests from sororities
| for dainty, elegant items such as
i turtle steaks, when rushing is in
| progress. However, they no longer
I have to live on stew and meat loaf
for several days following such a
splurge, as they did in the depths of
the depression.
Large quantities of meat constitute
! practically the only change in orders
I from fraternities during rushing. It
! took one and one-quarter steers to
J supply enough ribs of beef to fill a
recent order from one house, and 75
pounds of hamburger were included

in the same order.
Owned by the houses who use its
service, the co-op supplied them with
$113,000 worth of food and fuel in
the last school year, although sales
during the depression dropped to
$8. r >,ooo.
By contracting for products well in
advance, Ayres is able to take advan
tage of a rising market, keeping his
prices about 10 per cent below those
elsewhere. If the market, breaks,
however, he has it arranged so that
he is not held to the contract price.
"It's quite a game," says Ayres.
Capacity Business
El Campo and Breakers, along with
all the houses except Tri Delt, Dee
Gee, Alpha O, arc members of the
co-op. This makes almost as much
business as it can take care of at
present, says Ayres, with present fa
cilities. The butcher, for example, is
cutting meat at the rate of $60,000
per year, which is about all he can
handle, being five times as much as
the average butcher is able to do.
The meat is of the highest grade,
comments Ayres. "It's nothing like
| some of this downtown stuff where
they hang one government stamped
j animal in lb*' window and sell mostly
i low grade meat inside."

Vegetables and fresh fruits are the
ehief foodstuffs that the co-op does
not handle. These were given up be
cause the houses were too hard to
please, according to Ay res. They con
sidered his price on oranges exorbi
tant, for instance, when a fruit ped
dler showed them a loosely packed
box at a much lower price.
Hounded by some 25 agents each
week, Mr. Ayres has developed an
impcrviability to their salesmanship.
Advised by a Swift and Company
man to get a supply of salad oil in a
hurry bceause the market was likely
to rise, he exclaimed, "What do you
mean, rise? It's time for it to drop!"
Five-Year Contracts
Contracts between houses and the
co-op are made for five-year periods,
the second of which will expire in
July, 1939. All accounts are paid up
at present, but during depression
years three houses were in debt for
as much as $2000
Encounters with the cooks add im
measurably to the routine work of
Mr. Ayres. One time, one of the Chi
nesc kitchen kings called the co-op,
ordering a colander. When the deliv
ery was made, the cook excitably
ci it'll, '"No, no, no! Me want 1
rnliinrloi' "
