# Committee Revives Nite Spot Issue
## Proposed Election Shift, Youth Act Ratification Postponed for Week 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Ex Committee cleaned the holiday
tinsel out of its hair last night, then
started the wheels of Stanford's leg
islative mill on their slow and fal
tering ways.
Fastened to Wheel No. 1, spinning
ever so slowly, was the Farm's long
planned nitery. Because Comptroller
Roth had been off-campus for a
month, no one could go ahead on
estmiates for an "informal gathering
place" in the Old Union.
But President Reynolds promised
Ex Committee that before next
week's session an estimate would be
ready for the body's final considera
tion. Bob Mallett impressed the
group with the fact that the Union
remodeling would not be a "nitery,"
but a social room in which students
could talk, play cards, hold meetings,
dance—in short, "gather informally."
Empty for Ten Years
Student Manager Chuck Fontius,
arguing against the Union plan, said
that for 10 years before A.S.S.U. of
fices were put in, that lobby was al
most never used.
"But that was before the new
women came," said Mallett.
"And all the nice places down the
highway," retorted Fontius.
Still holding out for a permanent
nitery as first considered, on La
gun ita's banks, was Larry Rouble.
Said he: "If I had the capital, I'd
open my own nitery. That's how sure
I am of it."
Wheel No. 2
Wheel No. 2, grinding along at
much the same speed, was the elec
tion change proposed last December.
Because Barbara Kimball, "mother"
of the whole idea, is still not back
from the N.S.F.A. convention, Rey
nolds thought it had better wait.
Meanwhile, Chick Franich and
Mallett—for and against, respective
ly, shifting elections from May to
February, administration change
from fall to spring quarter — ha
rangued across the table.
"It's like changing the cast in the
middle of a play," said Mallett. "The
play goes on all right, but it's rather
disconcerting."
There is "too much doing spring
quarter," said Franich, "for the stu
dent-body and its officers to concen
trate on elections." Other Ex Com
mittee men, like Fred Williams, felt
they needed another week to think
it over. And another week they got.
Wheel No. 3
Jackie Brown rode Wheel No. 3
into the session—would Ex Com
mittee give its official approval to
the California Youth Act, now being
readied for consideration by the state
legislature? asked Miss Brown.
"Well," answered Ex Committee,
"maybe we had better wait until we
find out more about it." Junior
Woman Brown was appointed Sun
day to the Executive Council of the |
Northern California Assembly of
Youth in San Francisco.
Wheel No. 4
Fourth and last Wheel was wrest
ling. A petition of interested men,
brought in by Roy Thompson, asked
that wrestling be made a minor sport.
Reynolds will discuss the matter
with B.A.C. Headman A1 Masters, re
port on it next week.
Closed dates were granted Dra
matic Council May 21 and the Junior
Class, for the Prom, May 14. Open
dates granted: Phi Kappa Sigma,

Wheel No. 4
Fourth and last Wheel was wrest
ling. A petition of interested men,
brought in by Roy Thompson, asked
that wrestling be made a minor sport.
Reynolds will discuss the matter
with B.A.C. Headman A1 Masters, re
port on it next week.
Closed dates were granted Dra
matic Council May 21 and the Junior
Class, for the Prom, May 14. Open
dates granted: Phi Kappa Sigma,
Feb. 5; Delta Tau Delta, Feb. 5;

Ex Committee cleaned the holiday
tinsel out of its hair last night, then
started the wheels of Stanford's leg
islative mill on their slow and fal
tering ways.
Fastened to Wheel No. 1, spinning
ever so slowly, was the Farm's long
planned nitery. Because Comptroller
Roth had been off-campus for a
month, no one could go ahead on
estmiates for an "informal gathering
place" in the Old Union.
But President Reynolds promised
Ex Committee that before next
week's session an estimate would be
ready for the body's final considera
tion. Bob Mallett impressed the
group with the fact that the Union
remodeling would not be a "nitery,"
but a social room in which students
could talk, play cards, hold meetings,
dance—in short, "gather informally."
Empty for Ten Years
Student Manager Chuck Fontius,
arguing against the Union plan, said
that for 10 years before A.S.S.U. of
fices were put in, that lobby was al
most never used.
"But that was before the new
women came," said Mallett.
"And all the nice places down the
highway," retorted Fontius.
Still holding out for a permanent
nitery as first considered, on La
gun ita's banks, was Larry Rouble.
Said he: "If I had the capital, I'd
open my own nitery. That's how sure
I am of it."
Wheel No. 2
Wheel No. 2, grinding along at
much the same speed, was the elec
tion change proposed last December.
Because Barbara Kimball, "mother"
of the whole idea, is still not back
from the N.S.F.A. convention, Rey
nolds thought it had better wait.
Meanwhile, Chick Franich and
Mallett—for and against, respective
ly, shifting elections from May to
February, administration change
from fall to spring quarter — ha
rangued across the table.
"It's like changing the cast in the
middle of a play," said Mallett. "The
play goes on all right, but it's rather
disconcerting."
There is "too much doing spring
quarter," said Franich, "for the stu
dent-body and its officers to concen
trate on elections." Other Ex Com
mittee men, like Fred Williams, felt
they needed another week to think
it over. And another week they got.
Wheel No. 3
Jackie Brown rode Wheel No. 3
into the session—would Ex Com

the California Youth Act, now being
readied for consideration by the state
legislature? asked Miss Brown.
