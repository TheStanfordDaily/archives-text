# Head Janitor Lauds Brainy Mop-Wielders
## 
### 
"Brains are better than brawn,"
and makes Stanfordites good mop
sters, according to Janitors' Foreman
John M. Brown.
Brown last night denied, however,
that he is employing the seven stu
dents now doing janitorial work in
an effort to thwart the progress of
the new union.
"There aren't enough union men to
bother with," said Brown. "The or
ganization never will have more than
30 per cent of the janitors in its
ranks."
Emphasizing his contention that
students are efficient as janitors,
Foreman Brown told of one student
janitor who turned in a complete re
port of all the places they use roller
towels on the campus. "None of my
50 regular janitors ever did anything
like this," he added. "Lots of people
don't realize that intelligence is need
ed for janitors' work."
Brown predicted that the two
weeks-old union will "die a natural
death from lack of support."
