# Campus to Elect Woman Colonel
## Honorary Officer To Rule Over Military Ball 
### 
Reginning an R O.T.C. annual
tradition, members will hold for the
first time this year an '"Honorary
Colonel" contest, in which the most
outstanding senior woman will be
chosen by the male students to pre
side at the Military Ball January 29.
Although similar contests have
been held in other universities for
several years, the "Honorary Colo
nel" election has never before been
introduced at Stanford because of
the Masque Ball King-Queen con
test. The contest will be based en
tirely upon popularity, and no finan
cial expenditure will take place in
the elections.
Each women's living group, in
cluding nine sororities and seven
halls, will choose one senior woman
as its candidate for colonel. Next
week ballots containing the sixteen
names will be distributed in the
fraternities and men's halls.
In this election all but three candi
dates will be eliminated. These
names will be placed on the stub of
every military ball ticket. Each pur
chaser will check his choice and cast
his ballot at the A.S.S.U. office. The
winner will be announced the night
before the dance.
The "Honorary Colonel" will re
ceive for her trophy a miniature
saber and scabbard with the scab
bard and blade crest mounted on the
hilt. A perpetual trophy, a regula
tion size saber and scabbard, will go
to the sorority or living group which
she represents.
Women's organizations are asked
to select their candidates as soon as
possible, and turn them in to Dick
Macgowan, chairman of the military
ball committee.
