# Roth Negotiating For Hetch-Hetchy Water Facilities
## S.F. Supervisors Approve Project; P.W.A. Grant Of $117,000 Expected 
### 
That Stanford will probably have
Hetch - Hetchy water coursing
through its mains before summer
was disclosed in a statement by
Comptroller A'mon E. Roth yester
day, following San Francisco Board
of Supervisors' approval of the proj
ect on. Monday.
If financial arrangements are suc
cessfully completed, the construction
of a 36-inch pipe-line from the main
conduit near ;;cdwood i_ity down El
Camino iieal to Mayfield, adequate
to sei ve all communities along the
way, will begin shortly, Mr. Roth
declared. Cost will be about $260,-
000.
Augment Wells
Chief value of the new water sup
ply to Stanford will be to augment
the University's fast - diminishing
supply of well-water used for do
mestic purposes. Wells belonging to
several communities near Stanford
have failed in recent years, and Palo
Alto's wells are showing signs of im
minent exhaustion.
Since Hecth-Hetchy water is com
paratively soft, it could be mixed
with the harder and less expensive
well water to produce a reasonably
soft drinking and washing water.
Severai Peninsula communities are
following this procedure at present.
AlTect Lake
What effect this water supply will
have on Stanford's decision about
building a new lake on San Fran
cisquito creek, below Searsville, is
not clearly predictable, accoi-ding to
Mr. Roth.
Hetch - Hetchy water will cost
Stanford about 13 cents per thou
sand gallorfs, while water from a
new lake could be supplied at
roughly half that cost. So it may be
deemed advisable to build such a
lake, which would be much larger
than Searsville and probably avail
able to Farm sporting enthusiasts,
even if Hetch - Hetchy water is
brought in.
WPA Project
Proposed scheme for financing the
project includes a hoped-for $117,000
PWA grant, $63,000 from San Fran
cisco, $60,000 from Palo Alto, and
$10,000 each from Atherton and
Stanford.
The main pipe-line of the Hetch-
Hetchy water system runs down
from the Sierras across San Joaquin
Valley, tunnels through the Coast
Range, runs along the floor of the
Bay, past the south edge of Red
wood City—where it will be tapped
—and through the hills to Crystal
Springs Lakes, which supply San
Francisco.

The main pipe-line of the Hetch-
Hetchy water system runs down
from the Sierras across San Joaquin
Valley, tunnels through the Coast
Range, runs along the floor of the
Bay, past the south edge of Red
wood City—where it will be tapped
—and through the hills to Crystal
Springs Lakes, which supply San
Francisco.
That Stanford will probably have
Hetch - Hetchy water coursing
through its mains before summer
was disclosed in a statement by
Comptroller A'mon E. Roth yester
day, following San Francisco Board
of Supervisors' approval of the proj
ect on. Monday.
If financial arrangements are suc
cessfully completed, the construction
of a 36-inch pipe-line from the main
conduit near ;;cdwood i_ity down El
Camino iieal to Mayfield, adequate
to sei ve all communities along the
way, will begin shortly, Mr. Roth
declared. Cost will be about $260,-
000.
Augment Wells
Chief value of the new water sup
ply to Stanford will be to augment
the University's fast - diminishing
supply of well-water used for do
mestic purposes. Wells belonging to
several communities near Stanford
have failed in recent years, and Palo
Alto's wells are showing signs of im
minent exhaustion.
Since Hecth-Hetchy water is com
paratively soft, it could be mixed
with the harder and less expensive
well water to produce a reasonably
soft drinking and washing water.
Severai Peninsula communities are
following this procedure at present.
AlTect Lake
What effect this water supply will
have on Stanford's decision about
building a new lake on San Fran
cisquito creek, below Searsville, is
not clearly predictable, accoi-ding to
Mr. Roth.
Hetch - Hetchy water will cost
Stanford about 13 cents per thou
sand gallorfs, while water from a
new lake could be supplied at
roughly half that cost. So it may be
deemed advisable to build such a
lake, which would be much larger
than Searsville and probably avail
able to Farm sporting enthusiasts,
even if Hetch - Hetchy water is
brought in.
WPA Project
Proposed scheme for financing the
project includes a hoped-for $117,000
PWA grant, $63,000 from San Fran
cisco, $60,000 from Palo Alto, and
$10,000 each from Atherton and
Stanford.
