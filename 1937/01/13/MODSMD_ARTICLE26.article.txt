Prefatory Note: The Classical Lit
Department, I am told, convened in
a hotly yesterday morning with all
but two professors congratulating
themselves that they had no hand
in teaching Latin to a dolt like
Prendergast who, after struggling
through Cicero, Terence, Vergil,
and selected Odes of Horace could
not even remember that fraterni
ties is a third declension noun and
therefore its ablative is fraternitate
and not fraternitata. Querimoniae
Amarae delendae sunt!
