# GRUNTING AND GROANING
## 
### 
There was a colossal heaving and
shoving a little north of Post Street
in San Francisco last night as Man
Mountain Dean and Brother Jona
than waddled ponderously about a
squared circle.
But this, though, was no ordinary
match, inasmuch as Brother Jona
than has a beard just like the Man
Mountain's and it was announced
that the loser was going to have his
chin tufts shorn off in the ring at the
conclusion of the match. It pains me
not to have been there to see what
happens, for as this goes to feed the
presses the match is still some eight
hours away, yet it is my guess that
both contestants ended up outside the
ring while the referee leaned over
the ropes and disqualified them both
for dirty work or else the match was
called with both contestants too
thoroughly beaten down to continue.
A quick glance at a morning news
paper will be far more enlightening
on the subject than this column, al
though I still maintain that the bar
oer hired for the occasion got a free
show without shaving any chin whis
kers. After all, Brother Jonathan
leeds his beard as a necessary stock
n trade, for he is not so billowy as
he Man Mountain and cannot de
.ight the customers as Dean does
■/hen he hoists up his pants. Man
fountain elevates his trunks by first
inding the top of them under a roll
f flesh, then he gives a tremendous
. ift and raises stomach, pants and all.
When they are high enough, he lets
r o, and stomach, pants, and all sag
. ight down to where they were be
fore, but somehow the Man Moun
ain seems satisfied.

Dean, of course, is a famous man
n the movies now, and he is careful
n his matches to do what is expected
>f him by sitting on his opponent,
he referee or both. There are others
laying the San Francisco circuit
/ho are just as high in showmanship
alue, though. Lord Lansdowne al
most tops Dean in that respect. The
-.ord packs a beautiful pinky build
>f about 160 pounds, and he always
>rings it out into the ring encased in
black velvet cape with red velvet
ining and a spangled Union Jack on
he back, but his crowning glory is
ne blonde marcelled hair and the
lonocle he affects. When his time
omes to be introduced to the crowd,
.e carefully lays aside his resplend
nt regalia and instead of shaking
lands wtih himself and grinning
rom cauliflower ear to cauliflower
•£.r like the rest of the porkers,
-ansdowne bows beautifully in the
kittle Lord Fauntleroy fashion, al
hough he is no sissy in a clinch.
There isn't much to say about Chief
' -little Wolf except that he cheats very
pectacularly and is always being!
hreatened by mob action for push
ng lighted cigarette butts in the eyes
)f upstanding American youths. This
matching of suspicious-looking for
eigners with American boys is quite
in old trick, incidentally, although it
is not done as expertly in San Fran
cisco as it is in Los Angeles, where
chey match a relatively nice looking
boy with a Terrible Turk whose
shaved head set down on his shoul
ders without any neck in between, is
greased so that American Boy cannot
grab hold and is therefore forced to
foresake his principles and kick his
opponent in the face.
There is some sailor on the Civic
Auditorium circuit who is like the

animal that is supposed to have legs
shorter on one side from always run
ning around the mountain with the
same side of him towards the top.
When the sailor gets up off the floor
he immediately slants to the portside
and starts chasing his left foot around
the ring.

I don't know why I'm telling you
all this, except it does sometimes
seem a pity that people have to pay
a terrific toll to some San Francisco
hotel on a Friday night to waltz
about in the midst of a mass wrestl
ing act when Man Mountain Dean,
Lord Lansdowne, and the others
sweating lumoxes do the job so much
more artistically and for less money
besides.
