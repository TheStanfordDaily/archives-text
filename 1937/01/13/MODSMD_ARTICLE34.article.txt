# Theater Road To Be Paved Third Time
## Chemical Defect Found In 'Black Concrete'; Street Is Torn Up 
### JIM HURST 
| Rough Riders over the newly fin
, ished street in front of the Memorial
Theater, disturbed by its premature
ly decadent condition, may take
comfort in Comptroller A1 Roth's
! statement that it will be re-resur
laced as soon as winter rains permit.
The sudden deterioration of the
I new street was no more of a surprise
j to Stanlordites than it was to the
| California State Highway Depart -
| rnent officials, who directed the con
struction of the road according to
I their own specifications.
I Students were also astonished to
| observe that the newly repaired
| stretch of Bayshore Highway be
' tween Redwood City and San Mateo
is going to pieces.
Experts Seek Cause
Since this section of highway was
I paved with the same materials as the
j above mentioned block on Serra
; Street at the same time and to the
same specifications, Highway De
: partment experts conclude there
must be some chemical defect in the
j materials used, and are at present
| seeking to discover the cause.
| The section of Serra Street will be
j replaced at the contractor's expense,
| although the company supplying the
( road materials is probably respons
ible for the defects, rather than the
| building contractor.
Roth Blaiins Bad Luck
"We tried to do an extra fancy job
on this piece of road," said Mr. Roth
yesterday. "We figured if we were
ever safe on a job, we were on this
; one, using Highway Department
specifications and a type of material
; which has been very successful in
i the past on state roads. We just had
bad luck."
The road material used is a mix
; ture of rock and asphaltum—"black
concrete" — prepared in a mixing
plant and brought to the site ready to
lay down and roli. A successful ex
ample of this type of construction is
the street in front of Lagunita Court.
