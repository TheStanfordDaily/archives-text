# Rifle Club Plans Practice Tonight
## 
### 
The thunderous booming of pis- j
toLs mingled with the more staccato j
barking of .22 rifles will sound again |
from below the Administration i
Building tonight when Stanford
sharp-shooters meet to practice for '
coming matches.
The matches, and the Club's pro- !
gram for the quarter, will be dis- 1
cussed at a business meeting in the
lobby of the Administration Building '
at 7:30 o'clock, after which practic
ing will take place, according to Bob
Kahn, secretary.
President Harry Ogilvie urges all
old members and any other students \
interested to be present.
