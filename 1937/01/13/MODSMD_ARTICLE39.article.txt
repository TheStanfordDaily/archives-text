That idea of holding two of the
California-Stanford basketball series
in San Francisco was a noble one,
well deserving of thought.
The Civic Auditorium seats about
8500 for a hoop tussle, against our
2700 arid California's 7500. So if the
plan had gone through, some 5800
more people would have been able to
see the teams scrap with one an
other.
At, say, 55 cents a head, look at the
income! And think of the publicity
the venture would get, aiming as we
are at one of the most greuling se
ries in modern times; the interest the
town would take, and the time you
could have alter the game!
But it seems to be no more than a
dream. A1 Masters conceived it and
wrote to John Bunn on the trip;
Bunn, although he doesn't like the
San Francisco floor .agreed to the
idea, said that both learns would have
to forfeit a home game, because there
is a decided advantage in playing
the indoor sport at home.
Well, Ken Priestly came home
from Georgia Tech the other day (the
Cal campus is still deserted for
Christmas holidays) and said Stan
ford could play her games anywhere
she pleased, but California's were go
ing to be held in Edwards Gym.
That seems to end that.
