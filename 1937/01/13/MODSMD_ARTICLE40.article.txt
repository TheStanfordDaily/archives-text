# GLASS BACKBOARDS— HOW ABOUT THAT?
## 
### 
There are a lot of people around
here talking about glass backboards.
Have you ever sat behind the basket
in the Pavilion, or in Berkeley, or
anywhere? Did you often dream, as
four or five guys were struggling for
a tip-in right in front of you, that
you couldn't see, of transparent
backboards so that everybody in the
house would have a chance?
They have them in the East; when
Stanford played on them first, the
boys were a little leary, but after
wards liked them a lot. Coach Bunn
says they're great—he used to use
them when in college. The Pavilion
was originally equipped wtih them,
but later they were painted white
and then replaced.
The Conference abides by National
rules, which say only that the back
boards shall be painted white. In the
East and Middle West nearly every
school simply ignores the rule by
agreement, and large pieces of glass
about an inch thick, with white sup
port boards all around them, are
used.
Think of the number of seats that
would be improved. Why doesn't
somebody do something?
