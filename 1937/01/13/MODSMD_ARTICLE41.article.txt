# RULES, OFFICIALS. CLIMATE —EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT
## 
### 
You ought to hear John Bunn and
the boys talk about Eastern basket
ball—you practically have to leam
the game all over back there.
Interpretation on the holding rule
was the best one of all. You can
stand in back of a man, and when he
gets ready to let go a chest shot, the
thing to do is to put both arms
around him and get a held- or jump
ball out of it. Touching the ball in
the process is immaterial; just hold
the opponent's hands together so he
can't get rid of it.
The cure for the thing turned out
to one of tow alternatives: Luisetti
usually held an elbow back into the
guy's stomach who was behind him
trying to grab him, and shot with the
other hand, while another sure thing
is to start running down the court
with the guy hanging onto your back.
This proves embarrassing for him.

because he gets called for holding.
Interpretation of face-guarding
and blocking limitations was another
sticker, and much of the Pacific
Coast blacking game had to be aban
doned in some cases.
But the boys were really crazy
about Wallace and Kennedy, the offi
cials who worked the Temple and
Long Island matches. Kennedy, es
pecially, would boom out his deci
sions in a tone that would put Mager
kurth to shame. And every decision
was the same; the interpretations
may have been strange, but they
were uniform, and it was a swell
feeling to know just exactly what you
could or could not do.
