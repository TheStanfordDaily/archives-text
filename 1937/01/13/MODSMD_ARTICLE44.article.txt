# Frosh Cracks Rib In Paly Cage Game
## 
### 
First casualty of Stanford's 1937
basketball season appeared on the
Pavilion hardwood yesterday when
Leon Lafaille, ace frosh forward,
showed up at practice with a bruised,
and possibly cracked, rib, sustained
last Saturday night in the game with
Palo Alto High.
According to Mentor Gorter, how
ever, the injury will not be serious
enough to prevent Lafaille from
playing this week-end against Sacra
mento and Modesto Javsees.
