# Cards Ready to Scalp Brow-Beaten Bruins
## 
### 
Coach Pierce "Caddy" Works,.
i U.C.L.A. basketball mentor, brings |
J to the Farm this week-end a team j
that will have all the underdog psy- |
chology when they attempt to wan- !
gle a win, per John Ball, Orv Ap- j
pleby, CruKsan Hays, and colleague*, !
from what potentially is John
Bunn's greatest Stanford team.
Knocked over in five practice ,
games, including tnose with Oregon, j
W.S.C., and Washington in the
northern division of the confer
ence, the Bruins dismally began
their conference .season last week
when they collapsed in the second 1
half to hand the U.S.C. Trojans an
easy win. I
Leading at the end of the first half, !
23-20, over Troy, the We.stwood team
found itself mired down in the sec
ond period and was unable to score
again until it was behind 39-20 with
only four minutes to play. By that
time the Barry-coached outfit was
coasting, being hardly in a threat
ened position.
Appleby to Star
On paper Works' team has great
possibilities, the starting lineup av
eraging better than six feet two
inches and composed of, in reality,
four lorwards and a center. Center
John Ball, who finished third in the
I scoring last year behind Luisetti and
Hupp of Troy, has been having a
little trduble getting started this
year, according to reports from the
south, but the Uclans look for fire
works if he finds himself in the Stan
ford tilts Friday and Saturday.
Captain Appleby, bothered last
year by appendicitis and a series of
dragging minor infirmities, has blos
somed forth in this, his last year, in
great style. He is regarded as the
best Bruin floorman, and is very
wicked to handle when he finds his
eye.
Berry Out
| Marty Berry, a transfer to U.C.L.A.
from Santa Clara, was doped to be
one of the top players, but he has
been kept off the first team by a
badly twisted knee, and by the im
provement ol Crossan Hays, sopho
more. He wrenched the knee when

he caught his toe in a chair rung
during the Bruin tour of the North
west in the practice season.
Last night in the pavilion Coach
Bunn led the entire outfit through
a lot of foundation work, mainly
guarding technique and rebound
work. The players will continue to
get such schooling straight through i
to the last session tomorrow, Bunn
relying on previous team play to
be sufficient for a victory.
Condition (>ood
Condition of the team is excellent,
there having been no injuries of any
kind suffered on the three-week
eastern tour. The possibility of in
curring any hurts before the league
inaugural is likewise one of Bunn's
reasons for shying away from scrim
mage this week.

badly twisted knee, and by the im
provement ol Crossan Hays, sopho
more. He wrenched the knee when

he caught his toe in a chair rung
during the Bruin tour of the North
west in the practice season.
Last night in the pavilion Coach
Bunn led the entire outfit through
a lot of foundation work, mainly
guarding technique and rebound
work. The players will continue to
get such schooling straight through i
to the last session tomorrow, Bunn
relying on previous team play to
be sufficient for a victory.
Condition (>ood
Condition of the team is excellent,
there having been no injuries of any
kind suffered on the three-week
eastern tour. The possibility of in
curring any hurts before the league
inaugural is likewise one of Bunn's
reasons for shying away from scrim
mage this week.
Coach Pierce "Caddy" Works,.
i U.C.L.A. basketball mentor, brings |
J to the Farm this week-end a team j
that will have all the underdog psy- |
chology when they attempt to wan- !
gle a win, per John Ball, Orv Ap- j
pleby, CruKsan Hays, and colleague*, !
from what potentially is John
Bunn's greatest Stanford team.
Knocked over in five practice ,
games, including tnose with Oregon, j
W.S.C., and Washington in the
northern division of the confer
ence, the Bruins dismally began
their conference .season last week
when they collapsed in the second 1
half to hand the U.S.C. Trojans an
easy win. I
Leading at the end of the first half, !
23-20, over Troy, the We.stwood team
found itself mired down in the sec
ond period and was unable to score
again until it was behind 39-20 with
only four minutes to play. By that
time the Barry-coached outfit was
coasting, being hardly in a threat
ened position.
Appleby to Star
On paper Works' team has great
possibilities, the starting lineup av
eraging better than six feet two
inches and composed of, in reality,
four lorwards and a center. Center
John Ball, who finished third in the
I scoring last year behind Luisetti and
Hupp of Troy, has been having a
little trduble getting started this
year, according to reports from the
south, but the Uclans look for fire
works if he finds himself in the Stan
ford tilts Friday and Saturday.
Captain Appleby, bothered last
year by appendicitis and a series of
dragging minor infirmities, has blos
somed forth in this, his last year, in
great style. He is regarded as the
best Bruin floorman, and is very
wicked to handle when he finds his
eye.
Berry Out
| Marty Berry, a transfer to U.C.L.A.
from Santa Clara, was doped to be
one of the top players, but he has
