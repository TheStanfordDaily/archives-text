# Upon the Essential Significance Of Nothing at All

Twenty-eight dead in 28 days.
Four major airlines v/ere forced to add more
names to their lists of casualties, as 1936 went
into its own final tailspin.
Yesterday, Western Air Express officials
v/ere huddled together for the second time in
less than a month, in an effort to seek some
reason why their ships—reputedly piloted by
crack aviators, designed with latest radio and
structural improvements, provided with the
minutest details of weather conditions—should
crash with death as chief of the ground squad.
December 15 saw the start of this fatal series
of accidents which have made streamer head
lines for metropolitan papers practically every
six days. United Air Lines in one crash ac
counted for 12 of the total 28 dead. Western
Air Express in two accidents put itself in second
place with eight or possibly more dead. Trail
ing in third place comes Braniff with six killed
in Dallas, and Northwestern Airlines reports
two dead in a crash in Idaho—all in the last four
weeks.
Following each one of these crashes, press
services report that Department of Commerce
and airline officials have launched "an exten
sive investigation" to determine the exact cause
of the accident. But there have been no follow
stories subsequently which explained specific
causes for the accidents. Have investigators
been unable to determine any reasons what
soever, or have they found that the airlines
were at fault and have smothered their find
ings?
But last night, hundreds of scare-proof people
were climbing into planes of all lines with
morning papers carrying latest bulletins on
yesterday's crash on one page—and on another
- Pullman Company-paid ads subtly display
ing the words "Not a Pullman fatality in more
than two years of Pullman travel."
