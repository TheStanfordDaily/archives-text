# The
						Serpent and the Apple And Paradise Is Lost

The student-faculty roundtable meets for the
first time at noon today. Its success depends
upon a multiplicity of factors, but its conception,
nonetheless, is a worthy attempt to put a finger
on one of the sore spots of higher education,
and that is: the barrier that has arisen between
student and faculty member.
At Stanford this is patricularly prevalent.
Apple-polishing or Yippe lAK aaaing is looked
down upon by our superior intellects, because
it is done for ulterior motives. In venting our
disgust on the apple-polisher, though, we are
tearing down one of the most valuable things
that can be gained from a college education,
which is the contact with men who live by their
wits.
Some of the most pleasant afternoons it is
possible to have can be spent with the chair
tilted back against the wall of the faculty cu
bicle, feet on the wastebasket, while the ills of
the v/orld, the perfidy of man against man, and
the philosophy of the irrationality of mind and

matter, march and countermarch across the
blotter.
For this stigma which is attached to what
should be a normal student-faculty contact, we
may thank the grade system, which makes edu
cation a game of hide and seek between the
corrector and the student.
Sitting in Quad offices today there actually
are professors who are lonesome for student
contact outside the classrsoom. They want to
bull-session with the students, but they don't
know how to go about it. On the other hand,
there are some professors who more or less
have to elbow the students away, if they want
to get their work done. That condition varies
with the individual professor. In general,
though, the professors are willing to waste a
whole afternoon with a student, if there is the
small chance that the student gets something
out of it. He will.
