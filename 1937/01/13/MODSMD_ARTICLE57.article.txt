# The 						California Youth Act
## 
### 
The proposal for a California Youth Act is
fine. Nobody knows what it is all about. The
backers don't know exactly what they're after,
so they have appointed a committee to find out
what they're after. That is the scientific ap
proach. The important thing is that youth is all
working together for a common project. Work
ing together for a common project breeds unity.
Unity is nice, though it sometimes makes things
a bit crowded. However, nobody really thinks
that organized changing of money from some
body's hand to somebody else's hand will dis
guise the fact that we are living in a sick society
and youth is sick along with it. Since nobody
really thinks that it will, the real cause of the
Youth Act, which is the unifying of Youth, will
suffer.
