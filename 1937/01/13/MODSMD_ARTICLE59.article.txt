CURT, CLEAR—AND CUMULATIVE
Correspondence school ma'am to the natioh's press in
Time Inc. The lessons they know and teach have won
them a Midas touch, have made them the Elizabeth
Ardens of a business that looked old, but is internally
young.
Papers everywhere have learned Time Inc.'s lessons
of style, news value, shrewd editorship. But few papers
have learned the real lesson of Time Inc.—cumulative
news.
* * * *
For that reason, far more than for Time's apocalyptic
cut-captions, Fortune's photographic spreads, Life's pic
ture scoops, do approximately 1,500,000 read Time Inc.'s
publications.
That reason is nowhere better demonstrated, in the
negative, than in the nation's daily press—that has
learned so much from Time and missed so completely
its most important lesson.
* * * *
Any issue of any daily is characterized by timeli
ness: "present the newest first and only. There's noth
ing deader than old news."
# * * *
Time Inc., lives on old news. It is the only publisher
in the nation to realize that new news is worthless ex
cept as emotional hor d'eouvre, if it is not explained by
old news.
Most Time stories start from the beginning, allow
ing one step to explain the other until the newest devel
opment finds its logical place in the narrative.
The new news is the same in both Time and an ordi
nary newspaper, but Time retouches the news to high
light its impliict importance, makes the new fact ex
actly as significant as it should be, in relation to the
old.
There is no trick to all this, Time-workers declare.
It is the result of common sense and the desire to throw
off the strangling formalisms of newspapcring.
* * * * #
Time's technique, it might be noted here, sprang
from the brains of a handful of college grads, out of
college, not in a job.
They, and Time, Inc., indicate that you can take
your choice of worlds; the old one that needs rewriting,
or a new one as long as it modestly hangs on the tail
of history.

opment finds its logical place in the narrative.
The new news is the same in both Time and an ordi
nary newspaper, but Time retouches the news to high
light its impliict importance, makes the new fact ex
actly as significant as it should be, in relation to the
old.
There is no trick to all this, Time-workers declare.
It is the result of common sense and the desire to throw
off the strangling formalisms of newspapcring.

Time's technique, it might be noted here, sprang
from the brains of a handful of college grads, out of
college, not in a job.
They, and Time, Inc., indicate that you can take
your choice of worlds; the old one that needs rewriting,
or a new one as long as it modestly hangs on the tail
of history.
