One more person was killed, 12
others were injured, as another
transport plane crashed in the San
Fernando Mountains near Saugus,
California, yesterday.
Not ten miles fro mthe point where
December 27 of last year another
passenger liner crashed, killing all
aboard, yesterday's crash marked
another chapter in the recent saga
of air disasters that has airline offi
cials dizzy from shock. Fate has
laid a heavy hand upon commercial
aviation, it would seem, particularly
in the west.

As Uncle Sam posted $10,000 re
ward in addition to the State of
Washington prize of $5000 for the
capture of the Mattson kidnaper,
local, sentiment rose to fever heights
in Tacoma in the search for the
"hook-nosed fiend." J. Edgar Hoo
ver, Department of Justice chief, de
parted from Washington 1o take a
personal part in the search.
Meanwhile, the finding of a blood
stained jackct of the same size as
that worn by the slain boy, in Puyal
lup, Washington, lent an added im
petus to the already furious search.
Royal Jack Barrymore, undoubt
edly heartbroken and soul - weary
since the departure of his newest
frau, Elaine Barrie, for home and
mama, underwent a nervous reac
tion yesterday that left, him in a
state of collapse at the home of his
trainer.
Apparently unable to stand the
gaff since bus youthful wife went
I home in a hull because the great
| Casanova wouldn't give his consent
I to her participation in a San Fran
| cisco stage production, Barrymore
| has retired from active life for the
I present to regain his wind. His con
dition, although not regarded as
I serious, was aggravated enough to
] keep him in bed lor a few days, at
least, it was said.
