Ruble surges on in its quest for sleeping quarters for
next year. The gals were plenty perturbed yesterday.
At the Alpha Phi house the little ladies stepped out in
formals and played "pin the tail on the donkey" Mon
day night, while at the Theta house, everyone threw on
a cape over the decolletes, and played musical chairs to
keep warm,
The Inter-hasher Intelligence Service reports that
the classes are rounding into shape, with the best rush
ing still being done by Roble employees over the
breakfast table. Latest rumor concerns a house that
once was great but is no more. It tried for several years
to raise itself by the bootstraps.
For awhile, the powerful Berkeley chapter used to
come down and do the rushing, but things got too com
plicated, when they started introducing the sisters to
each other. Besides, the Berkeley branch got a bit
hufTv one year, when they came all the way down here,
and the local hellions made them eat in the kitchen be
cause there wasn't room at the table.
Well, this time it looks like a winner. Taking a leaf
from the example of another house on the Row. which
only recently sky-rocketed itself to next to last place
at the dinner table, the low-low house, working through
a sympathetic sponsor and a powerhouse legacy is or
ganizing for itself otie of these ground floor classes with
lots of l>eauty and brains, which doesn't have to asso
ciate with the old gals in the house, but just takes over
the plant and builds up the empty shell in spite of
reputation and tradition. Sounds like a good idea.
Why doesn't somebody do that for Our Hasher?
