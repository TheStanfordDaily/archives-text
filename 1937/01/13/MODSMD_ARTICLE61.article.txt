# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Much has been said in the hall
about the unionization of janitors. As
far as I can see, The Daily has taken
no definite stand. My personal feel
ings are opposed to anything so com
plimentary as the Janitor's Union
sounds. In the first place, it assumes
that- the men are equally capable of
doing their jobs.
Encina, it happens, has some excel
lent janitors. It also happens that
there are a few who admittedly have
never made a bed before they started
here. The first time, and the second,
too, my bed was made this quarter, it i
appeared in strata of varied thick
ness. The base was the bedstead and
springs. Layer two, a mattress. Four
and five, two sheets. Six, a blanket.
Seven, an eiderdown. Eight, a coun
terpane. All this lay there without a
bit of it tucked in. I, unsuspecting,
woke up with frozen feet. The bed
awoke on the floor.
The third morning was much the
same, except that the eiderdown lay
on the floor. After that, I lay in wait
for the man, and gave a few helpful
hints on how to make beds. I had
myself gained some experience in
previous years away in school. The
main fact I tried to impress was that
the bed should be tucked in, so it
would remain a bed all night. He
replied that some liked them that
way, some did not, but anyway he
didn't mind if I wanted it that way.
Satisfied, I wended my way to the
English Comer.
He agreed that he would tuck in
the foot of the bed too; he really
might have thought about that, he
supposed. I'm looking across the
desk at the bed now. Here's how it
was made.
Janitor approaches, looks to see
which bed will require least work,
pokes at it uncertainly, lifts covers
gingerly, pulls a little, holds them in
the air as he arranges sheets vaguely
in a slightly more wrinkled manner,
pulls everything semi-straight, puts
on counterpane, tucks in everything
along both sides, including bed
spread. swishes mop toward a cig
arette butt, cigarette butt vanishes
(under a bed), he turns and starts to
leave, sees me, goes back, tucks in
foot of bed, that is, the counterpane,
there are no blankets that far down.
1 know, tell me it's more service
than many get, I wouldn't want to do
the room myself, etc., etc. But just
tell me this: Why should they get
better wages—l take it that is the
main plea—when about half of them
don't even take their mops around'
with them.
Sincerely,
Encina Inmate

The Editor, Sir:
The freshman class is very unfor
tunate in that it is compulsory for
them to attend the highly uninter
esting and boring lectures given by
the members of the History of West
ern Civilization staff. To add to this
there arc a number of these frosh
who must sit close to the lecturer,
making it almost impossible to sleep.
For these poor unfortunate souls I
would like to suggest that The Daily
run a crossword puzzle in each Tues
day morning edition. I think that this
would be one of the greatest services
a paper could render its readers. I
feel sure that this suggestion would
be welcomed by a great number of
the freshman class. How about it?
Sincerely yours,
Percival
