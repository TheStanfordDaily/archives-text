"The trouble with the world today
is a breakdown on the inside, rather
than in the contour of the country"
was one of the points made by the
speaker. That there i.s not enough
effort made by people to do some
thing heroic in life, and that per
sons are too satisfied with comfor
table existence was emphasized.
Dr. Jones said, "American educa
tion systems are lacking in that they
do not develop or organize instincts."
Meditation is also something which
people in other countries learn,
which Americans never acquire, un
less they make special efforts. The
imagination must be cultivated in
order to be great.
After Dr. Jones finished, students
were given an opportunity to meet
and talk with him.
