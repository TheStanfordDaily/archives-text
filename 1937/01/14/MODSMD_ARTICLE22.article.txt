# Farm Plans To Stage Ball On Roosevelt's Birthday
## Dance Replaces Jolly-up Of Last Year; White, Keating Are Chairmen 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Stanford will participate in the
nation-wide celebration of Presi
dent Roosevelt's birthday Saturday
night, January 30, with an A.S.S.U.
dance for the benefit of the Warm
Springs foundation. Boyd White
and Ralph Keating, co-chairmen of
the event, and Lewis Hanchett and
Don Muni, the other members of
the committee, have all been pa
tients of the foundation.
First Ball in 1933
Birthday balls have been held
throughout the country annually
since 1933, and each year large sums
have been raised to aid victims of
infantile paralysis. The first na
tional ball was given in 1934 as a
surprise birthday present to the
President, the proceeds being for
warded through him to Warm
Springs to be used for improvement
of hospital facilities. A part of the
proceeds is returned to the district
in which they are raised to be used
locally.
An hour jolly-up with a ten-cent
admission was held last year under
Keating s leadership, and was at
tended by over 400 students.
Real Party Predicted
This year the President is going
to have a real party, the committee
declared. The dance will last four
hours, with special decorations, re
freshments, door prizes, a first-class
orchestra, skits and other entertain
ment during the intermissions.
There will probably be vocal selec
tions by the glee club and other
special features.
Expenses for the dance will be cut
to the minimum, so that a large sum
will go to the foundation. Last year,
Fred Nagel's orchestra, tho Women's
Gym, door prizes, and the services of
Stanford police were all donated.
The Toyon-Branner dance which
was scheduled for January 30 will be
postponed.
Committee Works Alone
The committee is working inde
pendently but if the members wish,
the Cardinals will assist.
"All the men in the group are
vitally interested in the affair, as
they have received tremendous ben
efit from the treatment for infan
itle paralysis at Warm Springs,
Georgia. Since President Roosevelt
is himself a victim of the disease, it
is appropriate that a dance for the
benefit of a cause so vital to him is
held annually on his birthday," Co
chairman Keating commented yes
terday in announcing the event.

pendently but if the members wish,
the Cardinals will assist.
"All the men in the group are
vitally interested in the affair, as
they have received tremendous ben
efit from the treatment for infan
itle paralysis at Warm Springs,
Georgia. Since President Roosevelt
is himself a victim of the disease, it
is appropriate that a dance for the
benefit of a cause so vital to him is
held annually on his birthday," Co
chairman Keating commented yes
terday in announcing the event.
Stanford will participate in the
nation-wide celebration of Presi
dent Roosevelt's birthday Saturday
night, January 30, with an A.S.S.U.
dance for the benefit of the Warm
Springs foundation. Boyd White
and Ralph Keating, co-chairmen of
the event, and Lewis Hanchett and
Don Muni, the other members of
the committee, have all been pa
tients of the foundation.
First Ball in 1933
Birthday balls have been held
throughout the country annually
since 1933, and each year large sums
have been raised to aid victims of
infantile paralysis. The first na
tional ball was given in 1934 as a
surprise birthday present to the
President, the proceeds being for
warded through him to Warm
Springs to be used for improvement
of hospital facilities. A part of the
proceeds is returned to the district
in which they are raised to be used
locally.
An hour jolly-up with a ten-cent
admission was held last year under
Keating s leadership, and was at
tended by over 400 students.
Real Party Predicted
This year the President is going
to have a real party, the committee
declared. The dance will last four
hours, with special decorations, re
freshments, door prizes, a first-class
orchestra, skits and other entertain
ment during the intermissions.
There will probably be vocal selec
tions by the glee club and other
special features.
Expenses for the dance will be cut
to the minimum, so that a large sum
will go to the foundation. Last year,
Fred Nagel's orchestra, tho Women's
Gym, door prizes, and the services of
Stanford police were all donated.
The Toyon-Branner dance which
was scheduled for January 30 will be
postponed.
