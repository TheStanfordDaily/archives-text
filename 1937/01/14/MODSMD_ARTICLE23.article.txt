# Change Basis For Minecam Awards
## 
### 
A new arrangement of prizes has
been mads for Chaparral's Minnecam
contest in view of the caliber of the
pictures submitted. Awards will be
given for the funniest photos, and
for the best photography, rather than
for students and alumni as was origi
nally planned.
A ten-dollar order for camera
merchandise at Keeble's will go to
the owner of the most humorous
snapshot. The two runners-up each
win a $2.50 order. Similar credit
orders at the Camera Shop will be
given to the entries displaying best
photographic technique.
Many familiar features will also
appear in Chaparral's Minecam edi
tion, on sale January 22. Irvin Jor
genson has composed more of his
famous "Conclusions" for candid
shots snapped by McKenna. Jack
Scott, Dave Leff, Bud Arnold, Tom
Fleming, and Bob Hartman come
through with prose, poetry, or pic
tures relating to the humorous side
of life.
Farm Fables, Little Pop Oft, and
the reviews all make their custom
ary bows in Chappie.
