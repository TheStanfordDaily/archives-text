## ART AND THE MAN MOUNTAIN 
### 
Just to make a sucker out of me,
Man Mountain sat on Brother Jona
than night before last. Brother Jon
athan came out of it better than did
Dean's opponent of a weak before,
who broke a vertebrae while sup
porting Dean, but lie was still un
able to continue after the second fall
and the great shaving scene came off
as per schedule.
According to Ed R. Hughes of the
San Francisco Chronicle, the match
was a very unsatisfactory affair, and
he complains that the two hulks
flopped about like stranded whales,
neither of them being able to wrestle
a nickel's worth. The only thing is, it
surprises me to see an old veteran
commentator on sporting baloney
suddenly get squeamish about an af
fair which was admittedly bogus to
the very core.

I have always thought it to be an
accepted fact that organized wrest
ling was just a circus. In fact, I have
been told that legitimate, honest
wrestling, where there was no beard
pulling and eye-gouging, and a man
lost a fight because the other guy
was better, not because it was his
turn to lose the match, practically
went bankrupt for lack of enough
regular cash customers. That was be
fore the side-show school of wrest
ling brought back the money.
Certainly no one who sees the fan
tastic collection of human freaks
gathered into a squared circle can
believe that the fights are really se
rious. The best thing about them is
the way the bruisers fall over before
they are hit, purposely dive past
their opponents so as to go through
the ropes and onto the laps of the
ringside spectators, and try not to
laugh when they are supposedly
writhing in excruciating agony.
Just as I wonder about Ed R.
Hughes' comments on Dean and
Jonathan. I just wonder if any "ar
tistic" criticism ever does any good.
The number of pure artists are very
few indeed, made fewer, perhaps, by
the number of Roman Americans in
our midst who snicker at art for art's
sake. The most respected artist is a
person who sells choice representa
tion of the American scene at a high
price, and no matter what anybody
says about aesthetic standards of ar
tistic criticism, it seems to be the
sud truth that the best artist is really
just an entertainer after all, and the
gate receipts have always been the
best way of judging entertainment
value.

The case of the movies has grown
so flagrant that it is obviously no use
to complain about the lack of artistic
Hollywood productions. The moving
picture industry, I mean, is com
pletely in love with the box office
and a good picture is good if it makes
money. Bui even the more refined
"arts" are dominated, deep down in
side, by the same philosophy. In the
case of the legitimate drama, is
Shakespeare revived because the
producers feel that America needs
another injection of "culture," or
does Walter Hampden start on an
other tour of the country with a
Shakespearean repertoire because he
hopes the tour will make money?
Doesn't the Philadelphia Symphony
make a circuit around the United
States for the same reason.
Now all of what I have said is not
particularly astonishing, and my

point when I make it may not be
worth very much either, but the idea
is this: since an artist is a human be
ing who cannot subsist on dandelion
wine and wild herbs, but needs a
good beefsteak to wrap his soul
around, all the critical chirping about
a cheesy performance will not do any
good as long as the cheesy perform
ance makes money. Is the refining
element in the arts the critical com
ment or is it the customer's sheckel?

Thus Man Mountain Dean and
Brother Jonathan waddle about
without any particular athletic skill
because they don't neecl any training
to be big drawing attractions, and
thus all my elsewhere crying about
the ultimate sloppiness of Eddie
Duchin's consistently hackneyed mu
sic is to no avail while debutantes
and heiresses will pay good money to
swoon at the sound of him.
0 tempora, a mores!
