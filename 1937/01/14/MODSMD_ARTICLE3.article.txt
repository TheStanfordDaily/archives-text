their bidding lists. If the rushee is
undecided and feels that she cannot
give both dates to one house, she
should go to the sorority which she
prefers on Friday night.
The dinners will be from 6 to 8
o'clock Formals will be worn. Sor
ority women may not drive their
guests home after dinner.
Bidding Saturday
Bidding will be done on Saturday
