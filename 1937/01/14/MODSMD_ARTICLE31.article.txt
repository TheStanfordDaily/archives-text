# Stanfordites Recommend Youth Act
## 
### W. A. MILLIS 
The California Youth Act, a meas
ure providing vocational training,
jobs, and security for the most needy
young people and students, has the
approval of interviewed Stanford
students. The youth bill, drafted by
an assembly of youth in San Fran
cisco last week-end, will be intro
duced into the present session of the
state legislature.
Approval of the act and participa
tion in the campaign for its adoption
is scheduled for consideration at next
week's meetings of the Ex Commit
tee, says A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds.

"The California Youth Act," says
Mrs. Irene Coverly, head of the stu
dent employment service and campus
director of the National Youth Ad
ministration, "is all right to care for
an emergency. But you must be care
ful of doing anything of a permanent
nature."
Student aid, Mrs. Coverly believes,
should be used for students already
working who also need additional
aid. Students, she thinks, should
"depend on their own efforts pri
marily. They should not become de
pendent on the government."
Delegates from the Stanford Y.W.
C.A. to the Northern California As

seinbly of Youth were favorably im
pressed by the spirit' and decisions of
the assembly. June Berger, member
ox the "Y" cabinet and a delegate,
was "impressed by the democratic
procedure of the assembly." In her
opinion the youth act is "a very
splendid and necessary thing."
Alice Clark, chairman of the Stan
ford Committee on Peace Activity
and a delegate to the assembly, be
lieves that "the state act is only a
beginning, only a step toward a na
tional youth act."
"Concrete Experiment"
"The Youth Assembly," in the
opinion of Miss Elizabeth Lam, sec
retary of the local "Y," "was a con
crete experiment in the processes of
democracy. Its value lay in the rep
resentative character of the young
people who co-operated in the draft
ing of the California Youth Act."
The youth bill, in Miss Lam's opin
ion, "represents only one phase of
adequate social legislation and should
be seen in relation to the need for
social security. The effectiveness of
the bill will depend almost entirely
upon the fairness and thoroughness
with which the state youth commis
sion determines and meets the needs
of youth."
The eleven Stanford delegates to
the San Francisco assembly are

forming a local promotional commit
tee for the California Youth Act, ac
cording to Aliene Goldstein, tempo
rary secretary of the campus promo
tional group. They are planning a
meeting on Saturday, January 23.

"The California Youth Act," says
Mrs. Irene Coverly, head of the stu
dent employment service and campus
director of the National Youth Ad
ministration, "is all right to care for
an emergency. But you must be care
ful of doing anything of a permanent
nature."
Student aid, Mrs. Coverly believes,
should be used for students already
working who also need additional
aid. Students, she thinks, should
"depend on their own efforts pri
marily. They should not become de
pendent on the government."
Delegates from the Stanford Y.W.
C.A. to the Northern California As

seinbly of Youth were favorably im
pressed by the spirit' and decisions of
the assembly. June Berger, member
ox the "Y" cabinet and a delegate,
was "impressed by the democratic
procedure of the assembly." In her
opinion the youth act is "a very
splendid and necessary thing."
Alice Clark, chairman of the Stan
ford Committee on Peace Activity
and a delegate to the assembly, be
lieves that "the state act is only a
beginning, only a step toward a na
tional youth act."
"Concrete Experiment"
"The Youth Assembly," in the
opinion of Miss Elizabeth Lam, sec
retary of the local "Y," "was a con
crete experiment in the processes of
democracy. Its value lay in the rep
resentative character of the young
people who co-operated in the draft
ing of the California Youth Act."
The youth bill, in Miss Lam's opin
ion, "represents only one phase of
adequate social legislation and should
be seen in relation to the need for
social security. The effectiveness of
the bill will depend almost entirely
upon the fairness and thoroughness
with which the state youth commis
sion determines and meets the needs
of youth."
The eleven Stanford delegates to
the San Francisco assembly are

forming a local promotional commit
tee for the California Youth Act, ac
cording to Aliene Goldstein, tempo
rary secretary of the campus promo
tional group. They are planning a
meeting on Saturday, January 23.
The California Youth Act, a meas
ure providing vocational training,
jobs, and security for the most needy
young people and students, has the
approval of interviewed Stanford
students. The youth bill, drafted by
an assembly of youth in San Fran
cisco last week-end, will be intro
duced into the present session of the
state legislature.
Approval of the act and participa
tion in the campaign for its adoption
is scheduled for consideration at next
week's meetings of the Ex Commit
tee, says A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds.
