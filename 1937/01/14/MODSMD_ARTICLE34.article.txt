TK \< K SEASON
IS COMING I P

Remember last summer, just after
the U.S. Negroes had cleaned up the
Olympics from 100 to 800 meters, ev
eryone began to have his say on why
Negroes are superior to other races
at track and field athletics?
There were a lot of ideas, some that
the negro leg is 7 per cent longer
than other legs, some that the negro
calcaneus, or heel bone, is long, per
mitting better leverage for the work
done by the calf muscle and Achiiles
tendon. True these may be, but
here's one by Dr. R. J. Stroud in
"The Amateur Athlete," November,
1935, that I think knocks them all
into a cocked hat:
"The knee joint and ankle joints
bend in one plane each, and any de
cent runner has to have these planes
the same, and parallel to the lanes.
That's easy to understand; if you are
a guy that "toes out" when you walk,
you probably can imagine what you
look like when you run.
"But Ihe angle of both knee and
ankle articulation will depend on
how the leg, as an independent mem
ber, is hung from the body, or more
specifically, the angle which the hip
bone-thigh movement makes with
the sprinting lanes. Do you follow
me, that when this movement is par
allel to Ihe direction you're running,
the whole action is along a straight
line, the shortest distance?
"That's where the race differences
come in. Negroes, as pictures of
Owens and Peacock and the rest eas
ily show, have a thigh hung straight

outward, so that all thigh and lower
leg motion is straight up and down
the track.
"In white men the thigh motion is
along a plane that points outward
and forward, and various complicat
ed leg movements are necessary to
get one foot to advance down the
track without getting it tangled up
with the other knee, or spiking one
self."

SUMMARY OF
CHAPTER ONE

Hence we find that all good negro
runners have similar gaits, which are
hard to tell apart, but that two white
men never run alike —they all go
through different gyrations (of
course instinctively) to get their feet
down the track without spiking
themselves.
Nearly all white men cross the lag
ging foot beyond, the center line of
the body, then drop it into the right
place on the track by either a bow
legged or knock - kneed forward
thrust. Ray Dean is an example of
a bow-legger, while Jack Weiershau
ser is the opposite extreme.
Women are at a much more pro
nounced disadvantage than white
men—their legs have in addition to
the horizontal slant, a bad vertical
slant downward and inward, making
good women runners rare and even
the good ones vastly inferior to men,
especially negro men.
Notice these three types some time,
and compare head-on views of sprint
races. I think Doctor Stroud has
something there!
