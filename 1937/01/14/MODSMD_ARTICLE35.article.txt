# Frosh Prepare For Ten-Game Baseball Series
## 
### 
With a few outstanding freshmen
already earning positions on the
frosh baseball squad, Coach Bobby
Grayson and Harold Shipkey yester
day announced the need for more
candidates and outlined possibilities
for new men on next year's varsity.
"Dynamite" Dick star of
the '40 ball-wielders, will return
after a recess since last quarter to
again hold down the third base. Out
standing pitcher on this year's squad
is Hugh Gallerneau, while first base
will be amply cared for by Sid
Lewis or John Livermore.
Big Bill Willard and Norm Juney
are expected to play a fine game in
the outfield. Star catcher for the
frosh will be Dan DeLauer. Chad
Reade, who is playing in the outfield,
has shown skill as a hitter.
The freshmen will meet nine high
school teams and Menlo Junior Col
lege during the season, which will
begin February 5 with the Com
merce High contest.
