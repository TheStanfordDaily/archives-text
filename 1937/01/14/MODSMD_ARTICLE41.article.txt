# Defense Stressed by Bunn Cards Ready For Bruins
## 
### WALT PETERSON 
Scrimmage for the varsity basket
bailers this week, originally consid
ered to be unnecessary by Coach
John Dunn, was reverted to mildly
last night, as the first - stringers
worked on defense against a series
of U.C.L.A. plays in an attempt to
g i u slant on what they will face
Friday and Saturday nights in the
Pavilion.
Outfit Labors
While the first outfit, Luisetti,
Turner, Stoefen, Moore, and Cal
derwood, labored against one of
Bunn's "gas-house gangs," the first
line reserves, Heath, Robertson,
Quade, and the Zonne boys , drilled
for a while against another bunch of
workhorses in an effort to brush up
on some of Professor Dunn's offense
plays.
Nothing particularly strenuous
was resorted to, though, condition of
the squad being tops. Brainwork
and finesse are the principal con
cerns.
Team Remembers
And while preparations for the
slaughter of the Bruins goes on,
Coach Eunn and the whole team re
member what happened last year in
the Stanford-U.C.L.A. series, when
Head Bruin John Ball averaged
more than 20 points per game in
four contests, and plan to do some
thing about it.
Ball, main threat of the Westwood
offense, tanked 135 points in con
ference play last season, but he went
hog-wikl in the Card series to score
5)1 of them. And nobody had any
excuses.
"We're Going to Try"
"This year, though," says Bunn,
"we're going to try to make him
earn his points against some other
team. He won't be ignored by our
defense—not this time."
Not yet in his full stride this year.
Ball has been surpassed in more
than one tilt for scoring honors by
Captain Orv Appleby, a forward
who has come into his own this
year after lagging last season from

injuries and appendicitis. Crossan
Hays, the other forward, is a sopho
more who improved so much from
the opening of the season that he
slid into a first-string spot over other
previously favored candidates.
Fast Buys
With Reitz and Lueke, converted
forwards, holding down the guard
berths, Coach Caddy Works has a
starting lineup that in actuality is
four forwards and a center, all very
fast and all supposedly good shots.
Using such a combination, works
has reverted to a fast break offense
this year for the first time since 19112,
hoping to utilize the team's speed for
a lightning attack. So far this sea
son success of the team has been
only mediocre, but optimistic ob
servers from the south picture a
possible rise to power this week
end.

ference play last season, but he went
hog-wikl in the Card series to score
5)1 of them. And nobody had any
excuses.
"We're Going to Try"
"This year, though," says Bunn,
"we're going to try to make him
earn his points against some other
team. He won't be ignored by our
defense—not this time."
Not yet in his full stride this year.
Ball has been surpassed in more
than one tilt for scoring honors by
Captain Orv Appleby, a forward
who has come into his own this
year after lagging last season from

injuries and appendicitis. Crossan
Hays, the other forward, is a sopho
more who improved so much from
the opening of the season that he
slid into a first-string spot over other
previously favored candidates.
Fast Buys
With Reitz and Lueke, converted
forwards, holding down the guard
berths, Coach Caddy Works has a
starting lineup that in actuality is
four forwards and a center, all very
fast and all supposedly good shots.
Using such a combination, works
has reverted to a fast break offense
this year for the first time since 19112,
hoping to utilize the team's speed for
a lightning attack. So far this sea
son success of the team has been
only mediocre, but optimistic ob
servers from the south picture a
possible rise to power this week
end.
Scrimmage for the varsity basket
bailers this week, originally consid
ered to be unnecessary by Coach
John Dunn, was reverted to mildly
last night, as the first - stringers
worked on defense against a series
of U.C.L.A. plays in an attempt to
g i u slant on what they will face
Friday and Saturday nights in the
Pavilion.
Outfit Labors
While the first outfit, Luisetti,
Turner, Stoefen, Moore, and Cal
derwood, labored against one of
Bunn's "gas-house gangs," the first
line reserves, Heath, Robertson,
Quade, and the Zonne boys , drilled
for a while against another bunch of
workhorses in an effort to brush up
on some of Professor Dunn's offense
plays.
Nothing particularly strenuous
was resorted to, though, condition of
the squad being tops. Brainwork
and finesse are the principal con
cerns.
Team Remembers
And while preparations for the
slaughter of the Bruins goes on,
Coach Eunn and the whole team re
member what happened last year in
the Stanford-U.C.L.A. series, when
Head Bruin John Ball averaged
more than 20 points per game in
four contests, and plan to do some
thing about it.
Ball, main threat of the Westwood
offense, tanked 135 points in con
ference play last season, but he went
hog-wikl in the Card series to score
5)1 of them. And nobody had any
excuses.
