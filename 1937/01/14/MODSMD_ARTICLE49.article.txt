# Frosh Face Loss Of Ace Forward
## 
### 
Preparing for the first two really
tough games of the season, Coach
Wytze Gorter and his frosh hoopsters
were faced with the probable loss of
ace Forward Leon Lafaille for Ihe
Friday night game against Sacra
mento Jaysee.
After examination, it was re
vealed that Lafaille had broken, not
merely bruised, his rib last Saturday
night in the game against Paly High.
Starting in Lafaille's position will be
either Staehle or Leckie, if he is un
able to play.
Outstanding player of the Sacra
mento squad is A1 Irwin, forward,
who is considered a cinch bet for all-
Conference honors. Les Watson,
lanky center, last year was one of the
highest scorers in the conference.
