# Happy New Year Again

### 
Added to the list of charges and counter
charges in the current janitor unionization
trouble is the letter to the editor printed on the
front page of today's paper.
Only "Diogenes' lantern" could find out
which side of the present squabble tells the
complete story. And which side is right or
which sid(§ is wrong is another matter for leg
endary abilities. ♦
As it has been pointed out, though, by critics
in the field, labor troubles are becoming less and
less a matter of what is right and more and
more the question of who is where. There is a
lot of furore in the papers about labor strikes in
the Middlewest, where the C.1.0. is organizing
the automobile industry, and I hear that even
the service station windshield-wipers are organ
izing a union on the San Francisco Peninsula,
so that Stanford students will have their oil
checked by all-union labor in a very short
while.
You can talk all you want to about craft
unionism and the sincerity of A.F.L. Chief Green
in his opposition to rank and file organization,
but just the same industrial unionism is some
thing which is becoming stronger day by day.
It is whipping around the country, and it isn't
like mah jong or midget golf. Laboring men
aren't organizing just because the right people
are doing it.
And they aren't organizing because it is a
noble idea of self-sacrifice. They are organizing
because they want higher wages. And they
know that they don't get higher wages by
talking on lecture platforms, writing long books,
or turning out long editorials in the Saturday
Evening Post; they get higher wages by strik
ing.
Not only that, but the more the unions organ
ize, the more powerful thpy are and the more
conscious they become of the necessity for
solidarity of the workingman if he wants higher
wages. Even Mr. Green's respectable craft
unionists are not nearly as snooty about their
less fortunate brethren as they were several
years ago. Just ask one of the craft union boys
in the Bay District if he believes Mr. Rossi or
Mr. Bridges (dubbed by some of the Bay Region
press as "The Polynesian Werewolf") is right
in the Maritime Strike, and then inquire also,
how much the aristocratic craft unions have
contributed to the war chest of the longshore
men, and you will be plenty surprised.
The so-called March Inland is a reality, but
it isn't a march, it's a movement. And it isn't
going to be stopped by full-page ads in the city
papers. «
The thing is, when labor really begins to real
ize its power, and it isn't even on the scent, yet,
it is going to have enough to get higher wages,
whether the employers like it or not. The em
ployers have the hymn books, the bank books,
and the text books on their side, but it isn't
going to be a battle of books. For every breach
in ethics or philosophy charged against the
employees, the workers can find one against
the employers. If trade unionism is an inter
ference with the natural laws of supply and
demand, so are trusts, monopolies, tariffs, and
even the A.A.A. And just as challenges to
liberty of the employer to hire and fire whom
he pleases are looked down upon by some of
our political philosophers, so can the other side
point out that we are not living in a medieval
society, that our modern society also has chal
lenged the liberty of the employee to work
where he wants to, or to develop his abilities
so that he can rise above his station.
On our own campus, then, we may or may
not see the nation-wide drama in miniature.
And just as on the nation-wide scale, the fact of
who is right or wrong is not pertinent. The real
thing about it is: the janitors are irritated. They
are forming a union; no denials or recrimina
tions can dispute the fact. How strong the union
is or how long it will last nobody knows. If
the forces which cause the irritation are re
moved, the union may or may not die. But if a
strong union is formed, the battle v/ill not be
fought on the question of the ability of the
janitors to turn down the counterpane, or the
civil rights of various interests. But it will be
fought to determine who will win.
This is not a pretty fact. But this is not 1920,
it is 1937.

It is whipping around the country, and it isn't
like mah jong or midget golf. Laboring men
aren't organizing just because the right people
are doing it.
And they aren't organizing because it is a
noble idea of self-sacrifice. They are organizing
because they want higher wages. And they
know that they don't get higher wages by
talking on lecture platforms, writing long books,
or turning out long editorials in the Saturday
Evening Post; they get higher wages by strik
ing.
Not only that, but the more the unions organ
ize, the more powerful thpy are and the more
conscious they become of the necessity for
solidarity of the workingman if he wants higher
wages. Even Mr. Green's respectable craft
unionists are not nearly as snooty about their
less fortunate brethren as they were several
years ago. Just ask one of the craft union boys
in the Bay District if he believes Mr. Rossi or
Mr. Bridges (dubbed by some of the Bay Region
press as "The Polynesian Werewolf") is right
in the Maritime Strike, and then inquire also,
how much the aristocratic craft unions have
contributed to the war chest of the longshore
men, and you will be plenty surprised.
The so-called March Inland is a reality, but
it isn't a march, it's a movement. And it isn't
going to be stopped by full-page ads in the city
papers. «
The thing is, when labor really begins to real
ize its power, and it isn't even on the scent, yet,
it is going to have enough to get higher wages,
whether the employers like it or not. The em
ployers have the hymn books, the bank books,
and the text books on their side, but it isn't
going to be a battle of books. For every breach
in ethics or philosophy charged against the
employees, the workers can find one against
the employers. If trade unionism is an inter
ference with the natural laws of supply and
demand, so are trusts, monopolies, tariffs, and
even the A.A.A. And just as challenges to
liberty of the employer to hire and fire whom
he pleases are looked down upon by some of
our political philosophers, so can the other side
point out that we are not living in a medieval
society, that our modern society also has chal
lenged the liberty of the employee to work
where he wants to, or to develop his abilities
so that he can rise above his station.
On our own campus, then, we may or may
not see the nation-wide drama in miniature.
And just as on the nation-wide scale, the fact of
who is right or wrong is not pertinent. The real
thing about it is: the janitors are irritated. They
are forming a union; no denials or recrimina
tions can dispute the fact. How strong the union
is or how long it will last nobody knows. If
the forces which cause the irritation are re
moved, the union may or may not die. But if a
strong union is formed, the battle v/ill not be
fought on the question of the ability of the
janitors to turn down the counterpane, or the
civil rights of various interests. But it will be
fought to determine who will win.
This is not a pretty fact. But this is not 1920,
it is 1937.
Added to the list of charges and counter
charges in the current janitor unionization
trouble is the letter to the editor printed on the
front page of today's paper.
Only "Diogenes' lantern" could find out
which side of the present squabble tells the
complete story. And which side is right or
which sid(§ is wrong is another matter for leg
endary abilities. ♦
As it has been pointed out, though, by critics
in the field, labor troubles are becoming less and
less a matter of what is right and more and
more the question of who is where. There is a
lot of furore in the papers about labor strikes in
the Middlewest, where the C.1.0. is organizing
the automobile industry, and I hear that even
the service station windshield-wipers are organ
izing a union on the San Francisco Peninsula,
so that Stanford students will have their oil
checked by all-union labor in a very short
while.

unionism and the sincerity of A.F.L. Chief Green

men, and you will be plenty surprised.
The so-called March Inland is a reality, but
it isn't a march, it's a movement. And it isn't
going to be stopped by full-page ads in the city
papers. «
The thing is, when labor really begins to real
ize its power, and it isn't even on the scent, yet,
it is going to have enough to get higher wages,
whether the employers like it or not. The em
ployers have the hymn books, the bank books,
and the text books on their side, but it isn't
going to be a battle of books. For every breach
in ethics or philosophy charged against the
employees, the workers can find one against
the employers. If trade unionism is an inter
ference with the natural laws of supply and
demand, so are trusts, monopolies, tariffs, and
even the A.A.A. And just as challenges to
liberty of the employer to hire and fire whom
he pleases are looked down upon by some of
our political philosophers, so can the other side
point out that we are not living in a medieval
society, that our modern society also has chal
lenged the liberty of the employee to work
where he wants to, or to develop his abilities
so that he can rise above his station.
On our own campus, then, we may or may
not see the nation-wide drama in miniature.
And just as on the nation-wide scale, the fact of
who is right or wrong is not pertinent. The real
thing about it is: the janitors are irritated. They
are forming a union; no denials or recrimina
tions can dispute the fact. How strong the union
is or how long it will last nobody knows. If
the forces which cause the irritation are re
moved, the union may or may not die. But if a
strong union is formed, the battle v/ill not be
fought on the question of the ability of the
janitors to turn down the counterpane, or the
civil rights of various interests. But it will be
fought to determine who will win.
This is not a pretty fact. But this is not 1920,
it is 1937.
