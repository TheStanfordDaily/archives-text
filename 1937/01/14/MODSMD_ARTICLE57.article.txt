Tonight the second in the series of "type"
motion pictures will be shown in the Assembly
Hail in connection with the newly devised
course Lectures on the Motion Picture."
When this course was announced by Uni
versity officials, it was met by immediate ap
proval of those who were looking for what
they supposed to be a pipe course. After the

first lew lectures, the realization came that the
course was not planned to be a cinch—enter
taining and amusing perhaps, but not a cinch.
When this course was being developed, the
University committees had in mind making the
lectures something more than entertaining talks.
Deep in their minds was the hope that it would
be an important step toward constructively ex
panding the University curriculum to fall in
with the trend of using the motion pictrue and
later the radio as "mechanical educators."
In recent experiments conducted in Ohio
schools, it was found that classes instructed in
history by means of radio lectures delivered by
an outstanding teacher in the field made much
better grades in examinations on the subject
than did those which were given the lectures
in persoi» by the ordinary run of teachers.
The facts are evident that in not so many
years, radio, motion pictures, and possibly tele
vision will be used more and more extensively
as educational mediums. And it was with this
idea in mind that "Lectures on the Motion Pic
tures" was organized—not a course solely to
discuss the acting abilities of early matinee
idols, but to provide a chance for students to
familiarize themselves with the potentialities
offered by the motion picture relative to educa
tional fields.
