# BULL SESSION
## WHEN YOU FISH, DON'T FORGET BAIT 
### 
Open to the press is the fact that Comptroller Roth's
recent trip East was to educate the public about the
needs of Stanford.
Open to any thinking person is the fact that the trip
was made to get endowments, in spot cash or in serious
promises redeemable before or after probate proceed
ings.
Also open to the press is the knowledge that all good
alumni and rich men should give, without asking re
turn, to a deserving and great University.
But not open to a tactful press is the fact that Stan
ford cannot demand funds merely because it is Stanford.
It must sell itself as a salesman sells a product.
For Stanford can rest assured that unless it has
something to sell besides the dubious "honor of giving",
it will end by selling something vital to its own self
respect. Few people give just to give, and there is no
reason to believe Stanford givers are an exception.

When the hat was passed, many alumni might well
have taken this hard-focus viewpoint: "Stanford sold
me an education which I bought. I'm satisfied and the
deal is closed. My sentimental attachment to the Quad
was sold me along with thp classes. I've paid for
everything."
Meanwhile, many rich non-alumni and alumni of the
pre-tuition fee era might have refused Stanford's plea
simply because the University could not show them an
imagination-tickling project needing endowment.
With honesty, University spokesmen could not hold
out any such project. For what Stanford needs, and
has needed for years, is unrestricted endowment. In
other words, Stanford wants "pure giving," and "pure
giving" simply doesn't appeal to the emotional con
denser of the mind, that organ enclosing the pocket
book.
* * * *
Now more than endowment, restricted or unre
stricted, what Stanford needs is a way to get that en
dowment, a way that includes such shunned and de
spised agencies as the press, low-brow ballyhoo, and a
prodding of Stanford's professors back to the research-
What we proopse, therefore (just between us), is bait.
The bait will be the unrealized dreams of professors,
scientifically sound, stamped with academic approval,
yet vastly appealing to the addled brains of plain men.
Such projects are easy to find. We suggest the med
ical school embark on a battle against the cold, the
Ryan Lab exeriment for the wireless communication of
power. These may be ill-selected, but they suggest a
world of interest to ordinary people—people whose
pockctbooks are anything but ordinary.
* * * *
Stanford would have these projects to sell. They
might be visions, but they are certainly academic pur
suits that would do more to untie purse-strings than a
rather vague "glory" and "honor."
And best of all, with the money to finance such re
search projects would come a resurgence of Stanford's
reputation for contributing to life—and with it, the un
restricted endowment so hoped for, and so unpromised.

Open to the press is the fact that Comptroller Roth's
recent trip East was to educate the public about the
needs of Stanford.
Open to any thinking person is the fact that the trip
was made to get endowments, in spot cash or in serious
promises redeemable before or after probate proceed
ings.
Also open to the press is the knowledge that all good
alumni and rich men should give, without asking re
turn, to a deserving and great University.
But not open to a tactful press is the fact that Stan
ford cannot demand funds merely because it is Stanford.
It must sell itself as a salesman sells a product.
For Stanford can rest assured that unless it has
something to sell besides the dubious "honor of giving",
it will end by selling something vital to its own self
respect. Few people give just to give, and there is no
reason to believe Stanford givers are an exception.

When the hat was passed, many alumni might well
have taken this hard-focus viewpoint: "Stanford sold
me an education which I bought. I'm satisfied and the
deal is closed. My sentimental attachment to the Quad
was sold me along with thp classes. I've paid for
everything."
Meanwhile, many rich non-alumni and alumni of the
pre-tuition fee era might have refused Stanford's plea
simply because the University could not show them an
imagination-tickling project needing endowment.
With honesty, University spokesmen could not hold
out any such project. For what Stanford needs, and
has needed for years, is unrestricted endowment. In
other words, Stanford wants "pure giving," and "pure
giving" simply doesn't appeal to the emotional con
denser of the mind, that organ enclosing the pocket
book.
* * * *
Now more than endowment, restricted or unre
stricted, what Stanford needs is a way to get that en
dowment, a way that includes such shunned and de
spised agencies as the press, low-brow ballyhoo, and a
prodding of Stanford's professors back to the research-
What we proopse, therefore (just between us), is bait.
The bait will be the unrealized dreams of professors,
scientifically sound, stamped with academic approval,
yet vastly appealing to the addled brains of plain men.
Such projects are easy to find. We suggest the med
ical school embark on a battle against the cold, the
Ryan Lab exeriment for the wireless communication of
power. These may be ill-selected, but they suggest a
world of interest to ordinary people—people whose
pockctbooks are anything but ordinary.
* * * *
Stanford would have these projects to sell. They
might be visions, but they are certainly academic pur
suits that would do more to untie purse-strings than a
rather vague "glory" and "honor."
And best of all, with the money to finance such re
search projects would come a resurgence of Stanford's
reputation for contributing to life—and with it, the un
restricted endowment so hoped for, and so unpromised.
