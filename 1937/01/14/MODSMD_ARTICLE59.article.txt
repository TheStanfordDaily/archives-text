The NYA cannot, compete in boondoggling with the
R.0.T.C., which not only provides pay, pants, and vaca
tion for America's youth, but also gives the children
horses to ride, but the NYA does all right in its small
way.
Many are the talcs of NYA workers spending sleep
less nights trying to think up something to do, and as a
result spending their days sleeping while doing it.
However, the tables are turned this time, and history
should record it.
It seems that a geology professor sent in a call for
NYA help recently, which was answered immediately
by two prospective workers. He set them to work on a
bibliography. As the G-men sweated through the short,
winter afternoons, the professor sat in his office and
snoozed. When it was finished, he included it in his
book as his own.
This riled the NSF-NYA-G-men no end, so they
took out the library copy, and wrote in it so that the
page read "Bibliography of the Geology of California:
compiled while asleep."
While we are on the subject, it is quite fitting and
proper to record the observation of a distinguished his
torian on the faculty, who has made the rather damag
ing statement that he and his wife read this column
every morning. This places him up high on my list of
personal heroes which includes Abraham Lincoln, Mark
Twain, Bugs Baer, and Wcsthrook Pogler.
His observation concerns the sleeping habits of the
Stanford student. After talking at some length to the
Current Events Class last quarter, he remarked sagely
that at Stanford University, contrary 1o the custom in
most eastern, western, northern, and southern univer
sities, the men and women students sleep together.
"I know," he says, "I saw them with my own eyes.
The men and women were sleeping together and right
in class, too. I talked as loudly as I could, and banged
on the table but I couldn't wake them up. I would
watch them doze off, aisle by aisle and row by row.
It was horrible." It must have been. I was in the same
class, but I was unfortunately unable to sleep.
