# Wolves, Lambs Part Tonight Until Pledging
## Preference Dinner Ends Rushing; Silent Period Begins at 8 o'clock 
### GEORGE VENESS 
"The Greeks come down like wolves
from the fold,
Their cohorts bulling with hash jobs
and gold."
Thus might Byron immortalize
the mad scramble for pledges which
annually draws to a close at this
time of year on the Farm.
After three months of heartaches,
hopings, and longings, today will
mark the final trek of Encina's po
tent rushing machine up the Row
before making its momentous deci
sions. Preference dinner tonight will
be the last official act of the 1936-37
rushing season.
Tomorrow afternoon a maximum
of 336 frosh will appear before a
notary stationed in the sponsors'
room of Encina and state their
choice of fraternity. This list will
be compared with a list of those
extended bids by the fraternities,
making each pledge an official
pledge. A maximum of 14 fresh
men is allowed to each house.
Interfraternity Council President
Bob Hoover states that fraternities
must turn their complete lists of bids
to the A.S.S.U. office before 10 a.m.
Friday. The pledge cards must be
contained in sealed envelopes.
There will be a silent period (as
in "quiet hours") from 8 o'clock to
night until formal pledging tomor
row, during which time absolutely
no clandestine relationships of any
kind may take place between Greek
and Greeklet.
Detailed plans have been com
pleted for the last act in this drama,
which concludes tomorrow night
with the Pledge Prom Informal.
