HONORABLE ESTATE, by Vera
Britain. Bookstore.
The story of an epoch just past;
this is a record of the swift transi
tion in the economic, political and
social status of English women dur
ing the years 1890 to 1930. Through
the story of three marriages Vera
Britain describes the effect of these
changes upon ordinary human rela
tionships.
The first marriage, that of Janet
and Thomas Ruthersford, embodies
the beginnings of the women's revo
lution. Brief and sad is the life of
Janet, an ardent feminist who sacri
fices health and happiness in the
cause of women's suffrage only to
die without seeing the realization of
her goal.
The marriage of Jesse and Stephen
Alleyndene illustrates the typical
status of a wife of the period. Jesse,
imbued with Victorian prudLshness,
vaguely baffled by an unsatisfactory
marriage, lives to pass through the

shock of post-war loosened stand
ards and to envy the freedom and
wisdom of a new generation of
women.
The culmination of the epoch with
its struggles and suffering is reached
in the marriage of Ruth Alleyndene
and Denis Ruthersford Theirs is a
union between two mature and un
derstanding persons each willing to
respect the rights of the other. Ruth
pursues her political career to its
successful peak and brings to frui
tion the aims of the valiant Janet.
Perhaps Vera Britain is too close
to the age she writes of to evaluate
it in the proper perspective. In her
foreword she humbly states this
likelihood and prophesies a "titanic"
writer of the future who will see the
true importance of the events of this
period in relation to the past and
future. But being of the age she has
one great advantage over her future
titan. Vera Brittain writes from the
depths of her own experience. She
writes with an earnestness, a direct
ness, that gives her tale a stark
power.
The last hundred pages of the
novel are, in my opinion, superflu
ous. They reveal an overly conscious
effort to tie together all the ends, to
emphasize all the points. As a result
they detract from the artistry of the
rest of the book.
Although Vera Brittain has no
desire to draw any conclusions about
the age of which she writes, she
does insert a message; a lesson
learned by some of those who suf
fered through the time of war, who
saw the decadence of many conven
tional moral standards: namely, that
cruelty is the greatest of sins. Every
individual, Miss Brittain affirms,
woman as well as man, worker as
well as employer, is entitled to that
respect of his dignity which consti
tutes the real "Honorable Estate."

does insert a message; a lesson
learned by some of those who suf
fered through the time of war, who
saw the decadence of many conven
tional moral standards: namely, that
cruelty is the greatest of sins. Every
individual, Miss Brittain affirms,
woman as well as man, worker as
well as employer, is entitled to that
respect of his dignity which consti
tutes the real "Honorable Estate."

HONORABLE ESTATE, by Vera
Britain. Bookstore.
The story of an epoch just past;
this is a record of the swift transi
tion in the economic, political and
social status of English women dur
ing the years 1890 to 1930. Through
the story of three marriages Vera
Britain describes the effect of these
changes upon ordinary human rela
tionships.
The first marriage, that of Janet
and Thomas Ruthersford, embodies
the beginnings of the women's revo
lution. Brief and sad is the life of
Janet, an ardent feminist who sacri
fices health and happiness in the
cause of women's suffrage only to
die without seeing the realization of
her goal.
The marriage of Jesse and Stephen
Alleyndene illustrates the typical
status of a wife of the period. Jesse,
imbued with Victorian prudLshness,
vaguely baffled by an unsatisfactory
marriage, lives to pass through the

shock of post-war loosened stand
ards and to envy the freedom and
wisdom of a new generation of
women.
The culmination of the epoch with
its struggles and suffering is reached
in the marriage of Ruth Alleyndene
and Denis Ruthersford Theirs is a
union between two mature and un
derstanding persons each willing to
respect the rights of the other. Ruth
pursues her political career to its
successful peak and brings to frui
tion the aims of the valiant Janet.
Perhaps Vera Britain is too close
to the age she writes of to evaluate
it in the proper perspective. In her
foreword she humbly states this
likelihood and prophesies a "titanic"
writer of the future who will see the
true importance of the events of this
period in relation to the past and
future. But being of the age she has
one great advantage over her future
titan. Vera Brittain writes from the
depths of her own experience. She
writes with an earnestness, a direct
ness, that gives her tale a stark
power.
The last hundred pages of the
novel are, in my opinion, superflu
ous. They reveal an overly conscious
effort to tie together all the ends, to
emphasize all the points. As a result
they detract from the artistry of the
rest of the book.
Although Vera Brittain has no
desire to draw any conclusions about
the age of which she writes, she
does insert a message; a lesson
learned by some of those who suf
fered through the time of war, who
saw the decadence of many conven
tional moral standards: namely, that
cruelty is the greatest of sins. Every
