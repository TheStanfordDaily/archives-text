## DOUBLE TROUBLE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I like double bills. Bull Sessioner
Eisenbach doesn't like double bills.
From your editorials I don't think
that you like anything, to say nothing
of double bills.
You ran a letter about a week ago
from the theater editor of the San
Diego Sun wanting the low-down on
students picketing theaters showing
double bills. Well, the closest I have
seen to picketing around here are the
week-end queues waiting to see such
combinations as "The Plainsman"
and "Country Gentlemen."
I have a strong reason for liking
double bills—when I go to a show I
like to see two pictures, I don't care
what they are. It's a lot better to
see a show like "Dodsworth" topped
off with a little number such as
"Tarzan Swings Again" than to see
several shorts, including colored
sunsets in Samoa and Laurel and
Hardy in their proverbial pie-throw
ing act.
Not only do I just plain like to see
two features when I settle down in
the springless seats, but I have talked
to the boys who figure out the clever
lines to be put up in the bright lights,
and you have no idea of the iun that
they get out of setting up such titles
as "Anthony Adverse"—"The Last
of the Mohicans," "Yours for the
Asking"—"Come and Get It."
In the days of the single bill, their
highest achievemnt was 'Men in
White"—"Shorts," but now under
the new plan, the witty combinations
are limitless.
So to those who don't like double
bills, I suggest that they get up and
go when the feature they are in
terested in is over, and if you want
to stay, just sit and heckle—and you j
will probably be going pretty soon
anyway.
