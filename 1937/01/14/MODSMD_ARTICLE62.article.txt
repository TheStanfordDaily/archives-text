The Editor, Sir:
Just in case anyone listened to the
feeble 'wail, of "Encina Inmate" in
yesterday's campus opinion, I want
to say that he ought to take his .six
blankets and his eiderdown coverlet
and go home.
And that goes for his counterpane,
too.
His is not the sturdy stock that
built America. Did our arduous an
cestors ask their janitors to smooth
out eiderdown coverlets? Huh?
No! They used 100 per cent Amer
ican wool blankets. And not seven of
them, either.
And besides, why does "Encina In
male" take such a sudden interest in
bed? Usually he comes tromping in
at any time before 3 o'clock in the
morning.
Who does he think he is, anyhow?
