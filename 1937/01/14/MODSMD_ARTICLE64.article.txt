# Masquers Offer Cash Prizes For Original Plays
## Lange, Bailey, Arthur, Baines Will Act As Judges for Contest 
### 
Masquers, women's honorary dra
matic society, is offering two cash
prizes for original plays, the winning
script to be read, and probably pro
duced, in the Little Theater.
An award of $15 will be given for
the play judged of most literary
value. The author of the most easily
produced play, taking into account
the handicaps of the Little Theater
and the greater number of women
interested, will receive $10.
Judges Named
Judges of the contest will be Pro
fessor Gordon C. Lange, Dr. Margery
Bailey, Amelia Baines, and Kay Ar
thur. February 20 is the deadline for
receiving scripts, which should be
turned in to Professor Lange's office.
Three one-act plays or one three
act play will be chosen for produc
tion, Miss Arthur announced. The
contest is open to anyone interested,
but Stanford students will be given
preference.
Masquers To Act
Members of Masquers will have
the women's parts. Open tryouts will
be held after the play has been chos
en to select the male members of the
cast.
There is a possibility that one of
the one-act plays may be used for
the Northern California Drama As
sociation's contest in San Francisco
next spring.
There arc 175,000 attorneys in the
United States, 38,600 incubating in
the law schools. Too many, say au
thorities.
