PAGE THOMAS MORE —Stoop-
nagle and Budd are worming their
"Stooptopia" into Thompson's course
on Political Panaceas. They picture a
glorious civilization in which ladies
rise and give their seats to men in
crowded street cars and buses, where
there are no pins in freshly laun
dered shirts, and where days begin at
noon so everybody can sleep late
every morning. Tune in on KGO
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. and fight for the
revolution.
KNIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON—
A new variety program will start
over KFRC Sunday at 3:00 p.m.
when Raymond Knight makes his
Pacific Coast debut. You probably
don't remember him because he
WROTE for Esquire. But in between
the Petty cartoons he had some fun
ny articles.
HORSE LAUGft — Jack Benny is
sad at finding himself in luck. It's all
because Mary Livingstone went rid-

ing one clay and returned with a
horseshoe. Jack, after looking at the
good luck charm, was indignant.
"The idea Of making a horse go bare
footed just for luck!"
ROM AN CK — Pretty Dorothy Pago,
of screen and radio repute, received a
mash letter from a college man with
ambitions. He said he'd be willing to
marry her if she helped him find a
radio job that would pay some real
dough.
Said Bob Mallett: "The idea of her
publicizing personal correspondence!
And anyway, I thought I destroyed
that letter ..."
