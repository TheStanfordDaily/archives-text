# Dear Editor: -Or, The Janitors Talk Back
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the name of humanity and jus
tice, we, the officials of the Stanford
unit of the Building Service Employ
ees' Union, have to answer to the
"wise cracks" of Janitors' Foreman
John M. Brown, printed on the front
pagp of The Stanford Daily of Jan
uary 12.
Just yesterday Brown told one of
our members that "the University
can't stand publicity any more." And
at the same time he started a sort of
publicity himself. What kind of
business is this? Unless he stops
publicity himself, we must do some
publicity.
Our answer is as follows:
1. In the above-mentioned article
in your newspaper, Brown said, "No
complaint has ever reached me that
hasn't been settled satisfactorily.
"It is true for sure, but it does
n't mean we have no complaints.
We have learned well that it is of
no use to bring any complaints to
John Brown, so we choose different
ways to bring our complaints to
high officials, and one of these
channels is through our Local 87
of the union.
2. Then Brown said about us jani
tors, that "they \vill be my friends
again as before."
Who is "they," may we ask, and
how many of them'.' It needs Diog
enes' lantern for finding any friends
of Brown among all the people liv
ing on the campus. As far as janitors
here are concerned, they never were,
never will be friends of John M.
Brown. Even his lieutenants are not

his friends. How could any friend
ship exist between humiliated and
one who underrates the merit of a
person?
3. Then, Brown tells "stories,"
which are unknown to us.
A story without names is a fiction.
Unless names are revealed we should
say that these Brown's "facts" are no
facts at all. It is Brown's blackmail
ing, it is part of his frame-up of
union men.
4. Then, Brown said that "most of
the discontent among the men is due
to misunderstanding of the inequali
ties of wages. "Some of them," said
Brown, "don't realize that higher
wages must be given to those who
clean out rooms where there are
stiffs lying around."
To this we may answer that
highest paid .janitor is A. Seva
rhenko, who seldom cleans rooms,
hut who does NOT work where
there are "stiffs." The next most
highly paid man is not even a jani
tor by trade, and knows very little
about janitorial work.
5. John Brown was talking about
"intimidation of those opposing un
ionization."
It is not proved yet by Brown or
anybody else. But there is an in
timidation of union men from Brown.
He still tried to scare janitors from
joining the union by laying off one
man, to whom he said that he is laid
off this Wednesday because stu
dents will be doing janitorial work.
The name of the laid-off janitor is
Arnold Ponticelli.

1. In the above-mentioned article
in your newspaper, Brown said, "No
complaint has ever reached me that
hasn't been settled satisfactorily.
"It is true for sure, but it does
n't mean we have no complaints.
We have learned well that it is of
no use to bring any complaints to
John Brown, so we choose different
ways to bring our complaints to
high officials, and one of these
channels is through our Local 87
of the union.
2. Then Brown said about us jani
tors, that "they \vill be my friends
again as before."
Who is "they," may we ask, and
how many of them'.' It needs Diog
enes' lantern for finding any friends
of Brown among all the people liv
ing on the campus. As far as janitors
here are concerned, they never were,
never will be friends of John M.
Brown. Even his lieutenants are not

his friends. How could any friend
ship exist between humiliated and
one who underrates the merit of a
person?
3. Then, Brown tells "stories,"
which are unknown to us.
A story without names is a fiction.
Unless names are revealed we should
say that these Brown's "facts" are no
facts at all. It is Brown's blackmail
ing, it is part of his frame-up of
union men.
4. Then, Brown said that "most of
the discontent among the men is due
to misunderstanding of the inequali
ties of wages. "Some of them," said
Brown, "don't realize that higher
wages must be given to those who
clean out rooms where there are
stiffs lying around."
To this we may answer that
highest paid .janitor is A. Seva
rhenko, who seldom cleans rooms,
hut who does NOT work where
there are "stiffs." The next most
highly paid man is not even a jani
tor by trade, and knows very little
about janitorial work.
5. John Brown was talking about
"intimidation of those opposing un
ionization."
It is not proved yet by Brown or
anybody else. But there is an in
timidation of union men from Brown.
He still tried to scare janitors from
joining the union by laying off one
man, to whom he said that he is laid
off this Wednesday because stu
dents will be doing janitorial work.
The name of the laid-off janitor is
Arnold Ponticelli.

The Editor, Sir:
In the name of humanity and jus
tice, we, the officials of the Stanford
unit of the Building Service Employ
ees' Union, have to answer to the
"wise cracks" of Janitors' Foreman
John M. Brown, printed on the front
pagp of The Stanford Daily of Jan
uary 12.
Just yesterday Brown told one of
our members that "the University
can't stand publicity any more." And
at the same time he started a sort of
publicity himself. What kind of
business is this? Unless he stops
publicity himself, we must do some
publicity.
Our answer is as follows:
