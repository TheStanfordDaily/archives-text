# Varsity Hoopsters Set For Series With U. C. L. A.
## Cards in Perfect Mental, Physical Condition; Ball Leads So-So Bruin Team 
### WALT PETERSON 
In perfect condition to a man, both
mentally and physically, Stanford's
varsity cagers, undefeated in 10 prac
tice starts that saw the finest compe
tition in America, fall before the Big
Red Machine, open the J937 confer
ence season tonight in the Pavilion
against a not too highly touted
U.C.L.A. team.
The Bruins, who split their prac
tice season this year about half and
half between the win and lose col
umns, boast principally John Ball,
six-foot, four-inch basket master
who was third high in the league
scoring race last year, as their main
threat in a rejuvenated Caddy Works
offense.
Ball Leads Uclans
Not since 1932 have the Westwood
ians used a fast-break offense, slowed
down for four years by the absence
of enough all-around men that
could get from one end of the floor
to the other fast enough. This year
Works has a different program, since
his first team is in reality four for
wards and a center, with bundles of
speed and all reputedly fair-to
middlmg shots.
Ball, for two years a reliable scor
er who generally had nothing but
good nights, with a few very superior

ones sandwiched in, lias been having
a hard lime getting started this sea
son. Although so far this year he has
not shown the full flower of his abil
ity, he still is a distinct threat. More
than once this season he has shown
glimmerings of the strength that
made him great in the past two hoop
races on the Coast.
Teams in Shape
It was through Ball's performances
in the series with Stanford in 1936
that the Uclans stole one of the four
games, but this year he will be re
membered, Coach John Bunn figur
ing to have his team set for the lanky
pivot artist.
Captain Dinty Moore, in the finest
shape Bunn could over have wished
for, will lead Luisetti, Turner, Stoef
en, and Calderwood, the identical
team that won the conference title
from Troy last year in a post-season
play-off, into the game as strong fa
vorites.
Bad Luck Dogs Moore
Named an All-Coast guard as a
sophomore, Moore was plagued by
flu and injuries in his junior year un
til the season was well nigh gone.
As captain then he sat on the bench
and watched Bob Zonnc fill his place,
finally commg into his own during
the Southern Cal series in Los An
geles.
At the start of the season Bunn
predicted the rosy-cheeked Irisher
would have his finest year this time.
It was almost balked by the discov
ery that Moore had cracked his arm
during the summer, the injury
starting to pain him again after a
week of practice. With his arm in a
cast he played the first practice game
against the Cal Aggies, but since the
removal of the plaster two days later
he has been in perfect shape.
Luisetti "Basketball Grayson"
Luisetti, the ambling Italian who
rocked eastern sports circles with his
magic touch that had been reported
but was unconsidered on the Atlantic
seaboard until his performances over
the holidays, will again be the main
bother to every coach in the league.
No whit less dangerous that last year,
the easy-going Grayson of basketball
has averaged better than 14 points
per game so far this season.
Turner, "Handsome Howie" of the
good looks and tremendous speed,
couples his scoring ability with that
of Stork Stoefen, towering center, to
make the secondary threat that can't
be stopped when any team is so
foolish as to put two men on Luisetti
to stop him.
Caldervvood at Guard
Running mate to Moore at guard is
Jack "Spook" Calderwood, the pow
erhouse giant who won all-coast
honors last year. Steady as a rock
and a Colossus on defense, Caldy will
do until a good guard comes along.
The game tonight will start at 8:00,
to be preceded by a preliminary be
tween the Frosh and Sacramento
Junior College, scheduled for 6:30.
Starting line-ups for the varsity
contest will be:
