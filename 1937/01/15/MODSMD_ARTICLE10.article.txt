# Symphony To Replace Pianist
## Rachmaninoff Felled By Flu, to Appear Feb. 10 
### 
Sergei Rachmaninoff, great Rus
sian pianist-composer, has become a
victim of the nation-wide flu epi
demic and will be unable to appear
at his Stanford concert scheduled for
January 28. The San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra will replace
him with a program conducted by
Pierre Monteux on Tuesday eve
ning, January 26, at 8:30.
Rachmaninoff's physician has or
dered a complete rest for the artist,
and he will not play here until Feb
ruary 10, the date for which the
symphony was originally scheduled.
Students holding season tickets for
the series are requested to ignore
the dates on them and to use the
tickets marked S.F. Symphony on the
26th and those marked Rachmaninoff
on the 10th, according to Concert Se
ries Manager Betty Stearns.
Anyone wishing to return separate
tickets for either concert may do so
at the concert series office; individ
ual season tickets may be exchanged
but not returned for cash. The regu
lar Tuesday evening lecture will be
at 7:15 on January 26 so that it will
not conflict with the musical event.
Since Rachmaninoff is already on
the way to recovery, he will defi
nitely appear on the newly scheduled
date which allows him a long period
of convalescence. As yet the program
for the San Francisco Symphony has
not been announced. However, "it.
will be one of the finest musical af
fairs that has been held on the
Farm," stated Carol Rundall, adver
tising manager for the series.
Pierre Monteux, who became di
rector of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra last year, is one of
France's greatest musicians. His first
season on the coast won him univer
sal praise from the critics. Mon
teux's style of conducting is quite
conservative; originally he made his
reputation by leading at the first per
formances of many great ballets, in
cluding most of Stravinsky's in post
war Paris, Miss Rundall also an
nounced.
