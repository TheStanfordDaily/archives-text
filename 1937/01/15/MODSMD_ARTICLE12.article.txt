# 'M. Beaucaire' Stars Great Lover of 20's
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The greatest gigolo of all time
flashed across the Assembly Hall
screen last night—and they laughed
at him.
As the second principal feature in
the art division's new Motion Picture
course, Rudolph Valentino — most
popular hero in cinematic history—
lived again in "Monsieur Beaucaire,"
but hardly with the same effect.
In the 'twenties Valentino was an
Ultra Personality. "Monsieur Beau
caire," Booth Tarkington's story of
a French prince who loved well but
not wisely, would be no master
piece even if produced with today's
technical advances. But it gave him
every chance to smile and love,
smirk and fight. It was the perfect
vehicle to exhibit the charms of the
world's current "lover."
In 1936, however, Rudolph Valen
tino is just exhibit "A" in a source
history of the motion picture. And
along with him last night were Lil
lian Gish and Wallace Reid in two
reels from "Enoch Arden," a D. W.
Griffith film made in 1915. Both Miss
Gish and Mr. Reid later rose to great
success, Reid to die, like Valentino,
at the apex of his career. Lillian
Gish is today a New York actress,
but her greatest days were in the
cinema.
Shortest of the three pictures last
night was John C. Rice's famous
embrace with May Irwin in 1896.
In fifty feet of film /ie (a) talked her
into it; (b) curled his mustache out
of the way; (c) kissed her.
