# Hoopsters Battle Colds With Pills
## 
### 
While varsity basketball players
trained for tonight's tangle with
U.C.L.A., their life blood was in
training for a no-round decision
against the common cold.
In the past, Bunn's boys have de
veloped sniffles, running noses, and
throat irritations while on trips East.
| Cold injections, a recent medical
! hope, were of little avail. Two months
| ago. Dr. Northway, hoop team physi
ican, was approached by Coach
j Bunn, who inquired if science had
! perhaps produced something more
' efficient to control the annoying win
\ ter ailment.

Thus, for the past two months. 12
Stanford Indians, comprising the
varsity squad, have been swallowing
small brown capsules which arc cal
culated to give the blood immuniza
tion properties against colds.
To date, the dosing is only experi
mental, as the virtues of the new cold
immunizer are not known. However,
many industries, including San Fran
cisco's bureau of public health, are
prescribing this drug for their em
ployees.
The pills build up a general im
munization, it is supposed, rather
than combating each individual at

tack of : niffles. Several months arc
required to do this, but immunitj
lasts for as long a period, more oi
less. Complete results of experi
mentation on the team will not be as
sayed before the end of the basket
ball season.
The capsule is already a commer
cial product as. entirely harmless, i
holds forth some chance of beinf
beneficial. Several campus people an
taking the .stuff, some reporting fa
vorable results, but the only organ
ized Farm immunization program i:
being carried out on the hasketbal
varsity squad.
