Organization of a "Committee for
the Relief of the Spanish People" 1
was decided upon by last night's
meeting of the Stanford chapter of
the American Student Union. In :
accordance with the stand of the j,
recent national convention of the I
A.S.U., of sympathizing with the
popular forces in Spain, the local
organization is planning to imme
diately initiate a campaign to raise j
relief funds for Spain.
Funds raised on the Stanford cam- >
pus will be used for the purchase of ;
food, medical supplies, and clothing, i
it is emphasized by members of the j
local group. Rafael Stotsky is chair- J
man of the committee, which will
seek the support both of individuals [
and of organizations on the campus. ]
Exact plans for the campaign have j
yel to be determined, says Stotsky. j
However, he hopes to culminate the j
campaign around the middle of Feb- I
ruary, at a meeting at which mem- ;
bers of the Spanish Youth Delega- j
tion, now touring this country, I
