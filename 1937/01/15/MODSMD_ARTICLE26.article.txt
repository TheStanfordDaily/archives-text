# SOUR GRIPES
## NEW RAT IN OLD CAGE 
### 
About dinner time tonight The
Daily puts out the usual rushing ex
tra which will contain a highly im
portant list of names and a few ads
and a whole lot of guff designed to fill
space and make peachy clever cracks
about rushing in general.
Now nobody who knows the differ
ence between a line cut and a half
tone will be so very naive as to be
lieve that the editorial hooey is going
to be inspired by the happenings of
this particular afternoon. Even as
this column is written the trained
seals are being jumped through the
hoops to make them write the usual
story about how glad the Row is that
the whole business is over, and I
suppose there is somebody some
where in this office now who is pre
paring a standard there-there-now
-you - didn't-want-to-join-a-frater
temity-anyway soother for those
vOho did not join the house they real
ly wanted.

Maybe I have taken too much
space explaining the obvious already
for everybody knows that since rush
ing always runs along more or less
the same track, the comments are
bound to be always just about the
same. It is not rushing that I feel
inclined to preach a sermon about, it
is just that rushing is a good place
to get off from. The general haze of
verbiage I plan to throw out runs to
the general idea that rushing is not
the only thing which is always the
same around here.
I would offhand venture to state
that The Daily comment on every
thing is always pretty much the same.
This is not intended to throw mud in
the face of the present editor, for his
innovation of the Monday tabloid
supplement is as honestly fresh an
idea as has struck a generation of
daily editors concerned mostly with
the state of the Union coffee. What
I suggest is that The Daily can do
nothing but inevitably comment in
changeless fashion concerning that
which is changeless.
Every year, as a new Daily editor
is elected and takes office, the old
editor sits down to write him a fare
well letter telling him that he will
inherit a fine staff and a bunch of
stock old issues, among them the
Bookstore, the honor code, commer
cialism in football, smoking on the
Quad and free rides to Paly. What he
usually neglects to state is that no
matter how hard the editor tries to
prospect for new issues to display
in his editorial columns, about the
best he can do is find the mythical
elephant's graveyard where all the
old hulks of former issues have slunk
off to die.
