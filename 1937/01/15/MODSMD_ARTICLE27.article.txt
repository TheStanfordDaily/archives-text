# Dean Kefauver Will Address Mothers' Club
## Faculty Quartette to Give Musical Program At Meeting Next Tuesday 
### 
Dr. Grayson Kefauver, dean of the
School of Education, and Dr. Verna
Carley, director of teacher training,
will be the speakers at the first meet
ing of the Stanford Mothers' Club
this quarter, to be held in the Wom
en's Clubhouse at 2 o'clock next
Tuesday afternoon, January 19.
The meeting has been planned to
give the members an idea of the
School of Education, since this is the
month scheduled for ground break
ing the new Cubberly Building.
Professor Max Savelle of the his
tory department will be in charge of
the musical part of the program. He
will introduce a faculty quartette,
composed of himself, Professor Paul
Kirkpatrick of the physics depart
ment; Professor Everett Hall of the
department of philosophy; and Mr.
Donald Layman, classics instructor.
After the meeting, tea will be
served by the mothers of women
students belonging to Union Club,
with Mrs. Norman Dole of Burlin
game as chairman. There will be
the usual no-host luncheon in the
Union before the meeting.
This year the Daily editorials have
dug as deeply, by new treatment of
old isues, as in the beautiful, hazy,
never-never days of the famous Mel
linkoff, but the administration has
not clamped down on Fiery College
Editor with a fury for the sadly
weary reason that they have always
heard the same old complaints about
the same old imperfect Stanford. The
new college editor is just a rat in
the worn cage filled with paper that
has been chewed by the rats that
lived there before him, and no matter
what scrap he finds to chew, some
other rat has chewed it before him.
It may be too bad that what seems
to be the new story is really just the
old story after all, but in a way, it is
a comforting state of affairs. It al
lows The Daily all sorts of license in
saying almost anything not made il
legal by the laws of libel and slander.
If the Daily were suddenly to pro
claim that there was no God and
Jesus was a hoax, the chaplain, who
has not been here long, might feel
alarmed, but there would be no posse
with a set of bloodhounds setting
forth hot out of the president's office.

This year the Daily editorials have
dug as deeply, by new treatment of
old isues, as in the beautiful, hazy,
never-never days of the famous Mel
linkoff, but the administration has
not clamped down on Fiery College
Editor with a fury for the sadly
weary reason that they have always
heard the same old complaints about
the same old imperfect Stanford. The
new college editor is just a rat in
the worn cage filled with paper that
has been chewed by the rats that
lived there before him, and no matter
what scrap he finds to chew, some
other rat has chewed it before him.
It may be too bad that what seems
to be the new story is really just the
old story after all, but in a way, it is
a comforting state of affairs. It al
lows The Daily all sorts of license in
saying almost anything not made il
legal by the laws of libel and slander.
If the Daily were suddenly to pro
claim that there was no God and
Jesus was a hoax, the chaplain, who
has not been here long, might feel
alarmed, but there would be no posse
with a set of bloodhounds setting
forth hot out of the president's office.
