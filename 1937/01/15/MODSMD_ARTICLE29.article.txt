# Ellis to Direct Maeterlinck Play
## 
### 
The Stanford reading play which is
the special forte of Sword and San
dals, will be applied on the most
pretentious scale to date when the
honorary dramatics organization puts
on Maeterlinck's lovely "Pelleas and
Melisande," next Wednesday evening
in the Little Theater.
Brobury Ellis, one of the stars of
last summer's "Antony and Cleo
patra" is directing this symbolic play
that calls for six men and five wom
en actors.
Mrs. Patrick Campbell first intro
duced "Pelleas and Melisande" to the
American public, and later Jane
Cowl used it as one of her most suc
cessful vehicles.
Maeterlinck is also author of the
pictorial "Blue Bird" which, with
"Pelleas and Melisande," has been
very successfully translated from its
original French.
Cast for the reading Wednesday
will be announced early next week,
according to Director Ellis.
