## "Roosevelt No Red" Says Farm Educator 
### 
"The Republican membership in
Congress is too small to bo effective
as a check against the overwhelming
Democratic majority," said Thomas
S. Barclay, addressing the first ses
sion of the Current Events class yes
terday afternoon on the subject of
the new Congress.
"There ai'e not enough Republi
cans in the House to force a roll
call," he continued, "and the situa
tion in the Senate is little better."
Professor Barclay pointed out that,
the reduocd ranks of the minority
party may cause a dangerous situa
tion because of the difficulty of find
ing minority members for the nu
merous committees.
In foretelling what will take place
in this session of Congress, Profes
sor Barclay showed that prediction
is difficult, since "Roosevelt made
virtually no specific pledges for his
second term."
It was made clear in the lecture
that Roosevelt has no dogmatic set
of fixed principles. "It is necessary
to understand that Roosevelt is not
a Socialist, a 'single taxer,' or a fol
lower of Adam Smith; and above all,
he is no Communist."

The lecturer did predict, however,
that, the new Congress will legislate
in the following fields: wages, hours,
and child labor; agricultural plan
ning; increased federal control of
banking; lower electric rates; ex
tended conservation of land, water,
and animal resources; amendment
and improvement of the social se
curity legislation; increased military
preparedness, especially in the navy,
although war is unlikely.
