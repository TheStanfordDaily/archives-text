### 
Judges in Stanford's $100 book
collecting contest met at luncheon
yesterday to clarify certain details
of the competition, rules of which
were announced last quarter when
entry lists Were closed.
Text books will not be considered,
decided Professor Lee Emerson Bas
sett, Mr. Nathan Van Patten, and
Dr. Huyy Beal Torrey yesterday.
Probably the books collected will be
displayed in the University Library
April HO, when the contest ends. At
this time, judges will interview en
trants to determine their familiarity
with their library, and to see in
what measure their aggregation has
followed the -interests of the owner.
Whereas there is no regulation
against acquiring books by gift, Pro
fessor Bassett warned the judges
would "be suspicious of too many
items from 'papa's library'."
Contestants and judges will meet
next week, probably Wednesday, at
an informal luncheon in the Union
to clear up any uncertainties on the
part of the former. Notices will be
sent them through the bookstore.
