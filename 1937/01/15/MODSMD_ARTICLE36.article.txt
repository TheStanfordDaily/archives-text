# Frosh Hoopmen Start Leckie; Lafaille Hurt
## Indians Meet Sacramento Friday, Modesto J. C. Saturday at 6:30 p.m. 
### 
Ambling through their final prac
tice before what promises to be two
tough workouts on Friday and Sat
urday nights against Sacramento and
Modesto Jaysees, frosh hoopsters
scrimmaged with the confidence of a
veteran squad, although to date they
have played only two games.
Coach Goiter, faced with the prob
able loss of Leon Lafaille, planned to
start Bill Leckie, a converted guard,
in his place. The rest of the line-up
will be the same as in the first games,
with Siebert at center, Lyon at the
other forward, and Anderson and
Rahn at guards.
Starting team for Sacramento on
Friday night will be Irwin and
Forbes at forwards, Watson at center,
and Campbell and Lopes at guards.
Saturday night the yearlings meet
a team which Modesto Jaysee regards
as its best in three years. Mentored
by Jack Gardner, the Pirate squad
features a deliberate, set-type of
fense, and employs a man-to-man
defense.
Starting center will be Jim Rickert,
high-scoring, G ft. 4 in. flash. At for
wards will be two midgets, compara
tively speaking, both being only 5 ft.
9 iu. They are Charley Mangiaracina
and Nat Morton. Guard spots will be
filled by Frank Triano, who was last
year named all-conference choice,
and Bob Norman, former all-Indiana
prep-school guard.
The games will be played as pre
liminaries to the two U.C.L.A. games,
starting at 6:30.
