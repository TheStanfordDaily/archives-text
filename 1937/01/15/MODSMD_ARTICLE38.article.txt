OF LUISETTI

ANI) THINGS
Luisetti, Luisetti, and—lest we for
get—Luisetti.
There you have in modest black
and white the answers to a most
surprising collection of questions.
Facts being what they are, and the
state of the arts remaining un
changed, and all other things being j
equal, and be that as it may, it is safe
to say that nothing you hear about
Luisetti should ever surprise you.
In almost no time at all, you can
observe that Luisetti stands out even
among the proficient company he
travels in. The realization of this
little fact and a quick glance at
Hank's record will clinch it. From
this point on whenever you hear tales
of wonder and glory on the hardwood
court, you will most likely hear
yourself saying, "This is indeed
amazing. But only one basketballer
could have accomplished such feats
—Luisetti."
Then if by chance anyone isn't
sure who it was that scored 143
points in 10 games you can announce
it was none other than Luisetti. Or
if you find yourself wondering just
who is expected to set an all-time
high in scoring, or who is credited
with doing more to put casaba con
tests on ice for Stanford than any
other individual, or who U.C.L.A. is
sitting up nights worrying about, or
who is perhaps the quietest guy on
the Indian first-string, or who is
hardest to stop when it comes to
scoring you can answer in one fell
swoop. "None other than Mr. L."
FUROR IN
THE EAST
Such facts about Mr. L. as the
above are by no means news. But
many an Eastern coach, player, and
newspaper man would cheer wtih
glee if he could gain a little cold dope
on John Bunn's defense tactics.
Casting convention to the four
winds, one New York scribe ac
costed John, it seems, and queried to
this effect, "Mr. Bunn, kindly en
lighten me on your zone defense
system."
To which Bunn retorted, "Some
people might caii a zone defense
and a team defense one and the same.
But you can't call my team defense
a zone defense."
"I may be wrong, Mr. Bunn, but
what is the difference between
them? I saw your boys in action last
night and, in my language, they use
a zone defense," the reporter coun
tered.
"Well," declared John, "you just
watch them tonight." The newsman
did. The next day he tracked Bunn
down to announce: "Mr. Bunn, you
have deceived me and a lot of other
people. Your defense changes every
night and I am at loss to classify it.
Just how does it work?"
Bunn went on to inform him that
it was a system unique. It changes
with every attack it is used against

and so it is truly a team defense. It
is designed to meet every style of j
play and John further believes the
Pacific Coast has a pretty fair smat
tering of varied styles.
He estimates that it took as long
to teach the Redskins that defense as
it did to school them on attack. For
a moment, he guessed it even took j
longer. At any rate, the eastern boys
are upset about it. A couple of days
ago a nationally known magazine
requested a yarn and diagrams from
Stanford's mentor in return for a
goodly fee.
"No time to write it up," Bunn ex
plains. All of which makes it tough
on the eastern hoop exponents. They
need all the basketball knowledge
they can possibly glean.
LAUGHING HOYS
STILL LAUGH
Generally bandied about during
their recent tour was the opinion
that Redshirts are laughing boys on
the court. At least in one case, this
cannot be denied. It all started when
the boys were tussling with Long
Island U.
This department has it that Bunn's
charges couldn't do much scoring in
that game, that is, not until they
started the guffaws. And who started
the guffaws? Howell Turner. He was
trying to break through a tight de
fense, got into a scuffle, and was al
ready falling to the floor when he
flipped the ball into the air in a
last-second attempt to save it.
Sheer luck or not, the casaba
swished through the hoop—it was the
wildest kind of a freak shot, but it
tallied. And Howell was the last to
find it out. He jumped to his feet,
took a wild look around for the ball,
and was still bewildered when he
found out what happened. By that
time the boys were already well on
their way ribbing him and laughing.
And from then obi, many another
freak shot was sunk. In Bunn's
opinion the tilt was won by two
things: the wild tallies and the
laughing boys' laughter.
