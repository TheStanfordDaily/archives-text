# Town Hall Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight, vying with men's pledging and the
pledge prom to follow, Stanford's potential
championship basketball team will meet U.C.
L.A. in its first conference game of the year.
Fraternity-men Luisetti, Stoefen, Moore, and
Turner—four of the first-string quintet—will not
be entering into the early hilarity of the eve
ning that will be prevalent up and down the
Row and even out to the wastes surrounding
the Zete house.
A few un-dated fraternity men (not Chase
and Sanborn) will join with the men from the
halls and unattached women to see the Indians
perform for the first time this year in the Pa
vilion. By the new B.A.C. ruling, students will
not be admitted to the game tonight or tomor
row night without rooters' tickets which were
given out last Monday and Tuesday.
The Stanford Band is also scheduled to make
its first public appearance of the year in a sec
tion especially set aside by Don Liebendorfer,
while inspiring, aspiring, and perspiring yell
leaders will also be around.
Taken all in all, what could be nicer than
watching Stanford hoopsters beating down
U.C.L.A. on the first night of the series, trying
to keep time with that rippling rhythm of the
band, and then trying to get a look in at the
spaghetti orgy in the women's Gym.—R. H.
