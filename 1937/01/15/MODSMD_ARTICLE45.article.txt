# Frustration
## 
### 
When Prendergast came into the office yes
terday afternoon, he said he was tired of writ
ing about the aesthetics of wrestling and would
delve, instead, into the very foundations of
religious belief. I believed him.
However, it seems that somewhere between
the office and the typewriter, he reached down
in the sack and pulled out a few lines on the
inevitable futility of inevitability.
I am inclined to concur that college editorial
izing is essentially a rear-guard action. I have
the added emotion, though, that now both of
us, having got the matter off our chests, will
have to figure out something new to write about
Monday, or else get a new, fresh, or exciting
viewpoint on frustration.
