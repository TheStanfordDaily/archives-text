The freshman will stand before the lawyer
and state his case. The lawyer will fumble with
his cards, smile warmly: "I'm glad you made
it, and the freshman will walk out a new man.
The new man will then go up the Row, and
cut across the lawn to the door of his new
nesting place. There will be several men stand
ing around on the lawn. A giant cracker will
go off. A cheer will be set up. Somebody
probably will walk over to him and shake his
hand vigorously, mumble "Glad ta see ya."
The new man goes inside. There are several
groups talking together in the living room. He
attaches himself to one, while all the guys smile
at him before they resume their earnest con
versation on the weather.
Pretty soon, the guy that he knew in high
school will come around and be enthusiastic:
"Gee, I'm glad ta see ya," he will say. Some
body, looking very busy, will approach to see
if he's got his pledge button, which he prob
ably has. Someone, looking even busier, will
press a ticket to the pledge prom into his hand,
and say he's glad to see him.
There is a graduate student standing in the
corner, who is commenting on the draughts.
The freshman suddenly feels that he has
joined an institution that has a tradition, and
something behind it. Ho looks at the graduate
and speculates inwardly upon how swell it is
to belong to something permanent, interspersed
with outward comments on how good the bas
ketball team is this year. There is a mist in his

eye as he realizes that this is an institution that
has been there a long, long time. Eventually,
he gets around to commenting upon the rain,
and the wind, and how cold it is at nights, and
he feels that he has been there as long as the
fraternity has, and suddenly discovers he has
something important to do, and goes home.
Tonight, he will call for his date, if he has a
date, and take her to the Reg. Dance. He pre
sents his ticket to the tall man with the broad
shoulders, who stands at the door. The tall man
eyes him carefully to be sure he isn't one of
the contraband Hall men, and passes him
through.
There is dancing in both rooms of the Wom
en's Gym tonight, because this is a pledge
dance. There is one orchestra in each room,
and a loud-speaker system in the court. There
is a man in the corner serving punch.
Everybody dances around the floor, and goes
out in the court in the intermission.
"Congratulations," somebody leans over and
says. And the new man realizes with a strange
feeling that he has never seen him before.
"Oh yes, congratulations," says his date and
rests her face against his. "It must be won
derful."
"Yes, it is," says the new man.
Suddenly he spots the guy he knew in high
school, who dances over to him.
The guy that he knew in high school looks at
the date and says, "Getting along all right?"
"Yeh," says the new man, "I'm doing fine."
Later in the evening, they serve a midnight
supper. At two o'clock the dance is over, and
he takes his date home. Then he goes back to
Encina and goes to bed.
There is a gregarious instinct in us all.

out in the court in the intermission.
"Congratulations," somebody leans over and
says. And the new man realizes with a strange
feeling that he has never seen him before.
"Oh yes, congratulations," says his date and
rests her face against his. "It must be won
derful."
"Yes, it is," says the new man.
Suddenly he spots the guy he knew in high
school, who dances over to him.
The guy that he knew in high school looks at
the date and says, "Getting along all right?"
"Yeh," says the new man, "I'm doing fine."
Later in the evening, they serve a midnight
supper. At two o'clock the dance is over, and
he takes his date home. Then he goes back to
Encina and goes to bed.
There is a gregarious instinct in us all.
The freshman will stand before the lawyer
and state his case. The lawyer will fumble with
his cards, smile warmly: "I'm glad you made
it, and the freshman will walk out a new man.
The new man will then go up the Row, and
cut across the lawn to the door of his new
nesting place. There will be several men stand
ing around on the lawn. A giant cracker will
go off. A cheer will be set up. Somebody
probably will walk over to him and shake his
hand vigorously, mumble "Glad ta see ya."
The new man goes inside. There are several
groups talking together in the living room. He
attaches himself to one, while all the guys smile
at him before they resume their earnest con
versation on the weather.
Pretty soon, the guy that he knew in high
school will come around and be enthusiastic:
"Gee, I'm glad ta see ya," he will say. Some
body, looking very busy, will approach to see
if he's got his pledge button, which he prob
ably has. Someone, looking even busier, will
press a ticket to the pledge prom into his hand,
and say he's glad to see him.
There is a graduate student standing in the
corner, who is commenting on the draughts.
The freshman suddenly feels that he has
joined an institution that has a tradition, and
something behind it. Ho looks at the graduate
and speculates inwardly upon how swell it is
to belong to something permanent, interspersed
with outward comments on how good the bas
ketball team is this year. There is a mist in his

eye as he realizes that this is an institution that
has been there a long, long time. Eventually,
he gets around to commenting upon the rain,
and the wind, and how cold it is at nights, and
he feels that he has been there as long as the
fraternity has, and suddenly discovers he has
something important to do, and goes home.
Tonight, he will call for his date, if he has a
date, and take her to the Reg. Dance. He pre
sents his ticket to the tall man with the broad
shoulders, who stands at the door. The tall man
eyes him carefully to be sure he isn't one of
the contraband Hall men, and passes him
through.
There is dancing in both rooms of the Wom
en's Gym tonight, because this is a pledge
dance. There is one orchestra in each room,
and a loud-speaker system in the court. There
is a man in the corner serving punch.
Everybody dances around the floor, and goes
out in the court in the intermission.
"Congratulations," somebody leans over and
says. And the new man realizes with a strange
feeling that he has never seen him before.
"Oh yes, congratulations," says his date and
