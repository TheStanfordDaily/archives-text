# BULL SESSION
## IN A HOLE—WITHOUT BOOTSTRAPS 
### 
Between Stanford's imaginary boundary in the Santa
Cruz foothills and its fences on the El Camino Real have
been three crises.
They arc called crises by polite people, but they are
really "holes." Stanford pulled itself out of the three
"holes" by its own bootstraps.
* * * *
In the Nineties, following the death of Governor
Stanford, the bootstrap was the Jewel Fund, which the
University pulled on while lawyers haggled the Stan
ford fortune through to the Supreme Court and victory.
During the war, when Stanfordites preferred to
fight Germans rather than textbooks, came the second
hole, and the second bootstrap: tuition fees.
During the depression Stanford fell into its third
hole along with Dad. The bootstrap (for the University)
was more women.
* * * *
Today Stanford is in its fourth historic hole. And
within the sacred confines of the University saddlery
is nary a bootstrap.
Nor would a home-made bootstrap work. The hole
is too big. It is really a ditch. It reaches across America
and continues around the world over the Santa Cruz
foothills, and back into the office of Comptroller Roth.
In this hole with him is $10,000,000 worth of 3 per cent
bonds which mature within the next few years. They
must be reinvested, but there is hardly a bond today
that is safe and that pays 3 per cent.
So Stanford must either invest in stocks or take a
cut. Meanwhile, to supplement a reduced income Stan
ford needs more money than the $115 it so tactlessly
extracts from us. It may even need more than such vig
orous agencies as the Stanford Fund can secure.
In short, Stanford is embarrassed by 1937. It was the
richest private University in the world in 1914, but it's
just "a university" today.
The President, knows it, the Comptroller knows it,
Harry Reynolds knows it, but they can't tell anybody.
Proud Stanford, disdainful of the public and the press,
is "bloody but unbowed," its nose scraped, but still
curling over its head.
As a result, to Mr. and Mrs. Public Stanford is still
the "richest school in the world," the "rich boy's play
ground."
What Stanford must do is show the public that it is
only a darned good University needing funds. What it
needs is a bootstrap from off-campus—an academic
Ivy Lee or Sieve Hannigan who can make Stanford's
problems as popular as the indiscretions of her stu
dents.
In other words, ofliical Stanford has to get off the
Academic Dime and onto the Public Dollar. And it
might as well lower its nose. It's royal regalia is clean
—but it needs patching.

Between Stanford's imaginary boundary in the Santa
Cruz foothills and its fences on the El Camino Real have
been three crises.
They arc called crises by polite people, but they are
really "holes." Stanford pulled itself out of the three
"holes" by its own bootstraps.
* * * *
In the Nineties, following the death of Governor
Stanford, the bootstrap was the Jewel Fund, which the
University pulled on while lawyers haggled the Stan
ford fortune through to the Supreme Court and victory.
During the war, when Stanfordites preferred to
fight Germans rather than textbooks, came the second
hole, and the second bootstrap: tuition fees.
During the depression Stanford fell into its third
hole along with Dad. The bootstrap (for the University)
was more women.
* * * *
Today Stanford is in its fourth historic hole. And
within the sacred confines of the University saddlery
is nary a bootstrap.
Nor would a home-made bootstrap work. The hole
is too big. It is really a ditch. It reaches across America
and continues around the world over the Santa Cruz
foothills, and back into the office of Comptroller Roth.
In this hole with him is $10,000,000 worth of 3 per cent
bonds which mature within the next few years. They
must be reinvested, but there is hardly a bond today
that is safe and that pays 3 per cent.
So Stanford must either invest in stocks or take a
cut. Meanwhile, to supplement a reduced income Stan
ford needs more money than the $115 it so tactlessly
extracts from us. It may even need more than such vig
orous agencies as the Stanford Fund can secure.
In short, Stanford is embarrassed by 1937. It was the
richest private University in the world in 1914, but it's
just "a university" today.
The President, knows it, the Comptroller knows it,
Harry Reynolds knows it, but they can't tell anybody.
Proud Stanford, disdainful of the public and the press,
is "bloody but unbowed," its nose scraped, but still
curling over its head.
As a result, to Mr. and Mrs. Public Stanford is still
the "richest school in the world," the "rich boy's play
ground."
What Stanford must do is show the public that it is
only a darned good University needing funds. What it
needs is a bootstrap from off-campus—an academic
Ivy Lee or Sieve Hannigan who can make Stanford's
problems as popular as the indiscretions of her stu
dents.
In other words, ofliical Stanford has to get off the
Academic Dime and onto the Public Dollar. And it
might as well lower its nose. It's royal regalia is clean
