# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Completely exhausted after continuous rounds of
playing musical chairs while dressed in formals, Row
and Roble denizens for the past few days have settled
down to listen to their basal metabolism tick over.
Wednesday night found Roble sponsors putting on a
floor show in order to cheer up the edglings and pledg
lings. The hot-towel and aspiring sequence drew a big
hand from hasher and hashed alike, as the pony chorus
gave a vivid and graphic portrayal of the morning
beforc headache, the fate of the Roble sponsor during
rushing.
It has not been recorded whether the rather uni
versal game of musical chairs has hern supplemented
yet by spin-the-platter. but the Kappas have inaugu
rated a hybrid Virginia Reel-blind stagger dance which
has all the merits of any jig you ever have seen. The
Alpha O's are featuring a race horse game played with
napkins, doilies, and dice. In the Deegec menage, en
tertainment has descended or risen (your choice op
tional) to word and guessing games. While, latest ad
vices from the front indicate that the Pi Phis just talk
about the hashers.
First prize for entertainment value still goes to the
sponsors.
The most unusual types of gushing
Are always saved till days of rushing
With honeyed words the girls are plied
Until the honey's cut and dried.
And then the honey stays aloof
T<Â» keep the ego shatter-proof;
Rut nothing stops complacent smirks
Of charm from Marlborough or Burke's.
