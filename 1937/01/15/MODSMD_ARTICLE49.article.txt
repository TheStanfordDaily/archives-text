# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir,
As president of the American Col
legiate Society for the Prevention of
Showing Double Bills in Theaters,
Especially Near College Campuses, I
feel that I must answer the "Man
Who Lived Twice Laughing at
Trouble." The arguments he used in
defending the double bill stand upon
unsolid ground.
In the first place, I feel that I must
call to the attention of the "Man
Who Lived Twice Laughing . . ."
that two weeks ago there was or
ganized on the Stanford campus a
movement for the abolition of the
double bill. I can call over 200 en
thusiastic supporters to rally to the
cause of the single feature at a mo
ment's notice and by their first
names, too. Wc are not only steadily
gaining membership here at Stan
ford, but this week's S.F. Chronicle
carried the news that Vassar had
taken up the movement against the
double bills as begun by Stanford.
The main reason that the "Man
Who Lived Twice Laughing . . ."
likes double bills seems to be that
they provide the theater boys who
put up the bright lights a lot of fun
in thinking out "screwy" combina
tions. Far be it from our society to
take away the fun of these boys
(working nights they don't have
much fun, anyway), but I must re
mind our critic that the single bill
will not entirely take away the boys'
recreation. During the hey-dey of
the single feature one could see many
such combinations as, "Once a Lady
—Now 25 cents." The boys will have
their off moments with or without
double features.
Another reason the "Man Who
Lived Twice ..." liked double bills
is the plain fact that he likes them!
There is no better reason than that;
if a fellow likes something, he likes
it. That's all there is to it. However,
when we obtain our goal of throwing
out double features in first class the
aters our friend will still be able to
see his double bills in Mountain
View and other places which not
only show a double bill, but triple
and quadruple bills, too. He will still
be able to find theaters that will give
him his money's worth of guff. ■
Double bills have many short
comings for entertainment seeking
America, and especially f or col
lege students who use shows as a
recreational factor to provide amuse
ment and get one's mind off studies.
The Stanford man frequently takes a
date to help him in this matter; but
alas, the double bills are so long, and
he gets out of the show so late that
he must hurry his girl back to make
her 12 o'clock leaving no time at all
to go up by the golf course or ex
plore the wonders of the cactus gar
den! It is surprising that the "Man
Who Lived ..." has never run into
this handicap.
Our friend is quick to criticize
Eisenbach and the editor for preach
ing the gospel of the single feature,
but Eisenbach signs the column he
writes and we know who the editor
is, but "The Man ..." prefers to
conceal his identity. If he will but
make himself known, we will be glad
to forward our booklet which ex
plains more of the fundamental rea
sons why the C.5.F.T.P.0.T.D.8.1.T
was organized and is rapidly spread
ing. However, we are glad that he
wrote in and expressed his opposi
tion to the return of the single fea
ture, because opposition is the one
thing that makes a movement — even
opposition such as his.
Respectfully,
The President
A.C.5.F.T.P.0.5.D.8.1.T.
