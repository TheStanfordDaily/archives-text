# ANOTHER ENCINAMAN SPEAKS
## 
### 
January 14, 1937
The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the "smart" remarks of
"One Floor Up," everything that the
Encina Inmate" says is true. This also
goes regardless of what the "New
Janitors' Union of Encina" thinks,
says, or does. Since the printing of
that masterpiece, Encina Halls have
not been safe for unsuspecting frosh.
Every janitor in the hall accuses his
charges of having written that "slan
derous" statement. Nevertheless, the
beds still aren't made right and
there is still lint under the beds.

P.S.: To the editor personally, not
for the public.
Edit this any way that you want.
I'm one of the few writers of Campus
Opinions that isn't a member of the
Dippy stall, and besides, I flunked
the English A. E. I. R.
