METROPOIJTAN
Lauritz Melchior and Lotte Leh
mann share honors in the Metropoli
tan's production of "Die Walkure" on
the radio Saturday, starting at 10:40
a.m. The Wagnerian opus is on the
NBC-Blue Network, which means
KGO.
Dragons, Teutonic gods, and blonde
goddesses keep Siegmund, played by
Melchior, from doing a little routine
police work. Whether he recovers
the stolen ring or not, whether the
beautiful Brunnhilde will help him
out, and how Siggie's old man, Wo
tan, will react to his son's affairs will
all be unfolded accompanied by
thunderous music. The music appre
ciation course says you gotta like
Wagner, so tune in.
GERSHWIN
But more to my liking is the pro
gram planned by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra for Saturday
night. George Gershwin is the guest
artist so anything goes.
Gershwin has turned out sprightly
junk for "Strike Up the Band," "Of
Thee I Sing," and a score more of
musical comedies. But he also did a
grand job on "Song of the Flame"
and "Porgy and Bess"—two operettas
that make his other stuff look trivial.
On the classical side, of course, he
has "Rhapsody in Blue," "American
in Paris," and his Piano Concerto to
his credit. So my hopes for a bang
up program have some basis.
BLUE MONDAY
To brighten up the dark day of the
week, Edward G. Robinson, Walter
Hampden, and Dr. Allan Dafoe will
be available next Monday.
Dafoe, the Quints' family doctor,
goes on KSFO at 8:45 in the morning,
while Hampden, America's outstand
ing Shakespearean actor, goes on the

same station at noon. And Robinson
can also bo found on the same wave
length at 6 p.m. when he takes the
lead in the Lux Radio Theater's pre
sentation of 'The Criminal Code."
