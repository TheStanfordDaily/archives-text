# Janitor Joins Union, Swept Out of Office
## Students Praise Toyon Bed Maker; Ponticelli Discharged by Brown 
### 
Arnold Ponticelli, a janitor who
recently joined the union, is to be
fired today.
Last Monday, Ponticelli entered
the union. The next day John M.
Brown, foreman, notified him that
he would be dismissed Wednesday,
changing the date yesterday to this
evening.
The only reason that Brown gave,
according to Ponticelli, was that
some of the students are being cm
ployed as janitors. The mopster as
serted that he did not know whether
or not he was being fired actually
for union activity.
Janitor Tops Average
Since his employment January 2,
Ponticelli claims, Brown has never
told him his work was unsatisfactory
in any way. Second floor Toyon,
where the janitor works, seemed to
consider their menial no worse than
the general run of janitors.
Out of five men on the floor, con
tacted at random, there were three
who considered the man well above
average in the way he cared for
their rooms.
Said one: "He is the only janitor
I've had in a long time that could
make my bed well. He comes back
later to make the bed if I am sleep
ing in it."
Another agreed to Ponticelli's bed
making ability, complaining, how
ever, that the bed went unmade
when he overslept.
System Scored
Two of the Toyon men who were
asked considered the janitor about
average, going to some length in
condemning Stanford janitors in
general. "This policy of contracting
to an outside company for janitorial
work is responsible for the sloppi
ness on the part of the men."
It was the opinion of one, however,
that the janitors could do better
work if they were not obliged to
hurry in making the beds, in order
to get the required amount of work
done.
Brown claims that Ponticelli was
hired with the understanding that it
was for only a few days.
The Editor, Sir:
Relative to the letter in this morn
ing's Daily which I suspect was com
posed by a handful of disgruntled
men, I have this to say:
That the man laid off has been with
me but a few days, since the
part of this month, and did not in
form me that he was a member of
the union. Nor would it have mat
tered if he had, as I am still running
this organization without, dictation
from unauthorized sources.
It is my business to answer com
| plaints and if any dissatisfied men
i wish to take their complaints to a
higher authority it. is more than all
right with me as it relieves me from
just that much more grief.
Also, I have been informed that
some of the new union members are
already considering withdrawing
from their branch as they realize
that it can be of no value to them
on (his particular job.

the general run of janitors.
Out of five men on the floor, con
tacted at random, there were three
who considered the man well above
average in the way he cared for
their rooms.
Said one: "He is the only janitor
I've had in a long time that could
make my bed well. He comes back
later to make the bed if I am sleep
ing in it."
Another agreed to Ponticelli's bed
making ability, complaining, how
ever, that the bed went unmade
when he overslept.

Two of the Toyon men who were
asked considered the janitor about
average, going to some length in
condemning Stanford janitors in
general. "This policy of contracting
to an outside company for janitorial
work is responsible for the sloppi
ness on the part of the men."
It was the opinion of one, however,
that the janitors could do better
work if they were not obliged to
hurry in making the beds, in order
to get the required amount of work
done.
Brown claims that Ponticelli was
hired with the understanding that it
was for only a few days.
The Editor, Sir:
Relative to the letter in this morn
ing's Daily which I suspect was com
posed by a handful of disgruntled
men, I have this to say:
That the man laid off has been with
me but a few days, since the
part of this month, and did not in
form me that he was a member of
the union. Nor would it have mat
tered if he had, as I am still running
this organization without, dictation
from unauthorized sources.
It is my business to answer com
| plaints and if any dissatisfied men
i wish to take their complaints to a
higher authority it. is more than all
right with me as it relieves me from
just that much more grief.
Also, I have been informed that
some of the new union members are
already considering withdrawing
from their branch as they realize
that it can be of no value to them
on (his particular job.
John M. Brown
Arnold Ponticelli, a janitor who
recently joined the union, is to be
fired today.
Last Monday, Ponticelli entered
the union. The next day John M.
Brown, foreman, notified him that
he would be dismissed Wednesday,
changing the date yesterday to this
evening.
The only reason that Brown gave,
according to Ponticelli, was that
some of the students are being cm
ployed as janitors. The mopster as
serted that he did not know whether
or not he was being fired actually
for union activity.
Janitor Tops Average
Since his employment January 2,

told him his work was unsatisfactory
in any way. Second floor Toyon,
