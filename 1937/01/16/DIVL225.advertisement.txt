CONGRATULATIONS
TO THE
Pledges of 1937!
Tlit Clothes Closet is indeed capable of outfitting the College
Maid from Head to Hose . . . And in a manner which even the
sternest of new Big Sisters will approve.
Quad clothes, spectator-sports, dinner clothes, formals, and
whatever-you-wish range in price from four dollars to sixteen.
Do come in and visit our "Cozy Corners"
at the
CLOTHES CLOSET
