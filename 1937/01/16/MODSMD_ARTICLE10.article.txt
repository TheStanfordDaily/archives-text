# Lagunita Lures Rushees With Diversified Features
## 
### 
Just as house plans, elaborate
and promised for the early future,
are used as bait to lure little Greeks,
so were they used by Lagunita, to
reap one of the largest classes in
her history.
Already known as one of the
most modern dormitories in the
world, Lagunita next year offers
two new wings in addition to the
present four which house about 200
women in groups of 50 each. These
additions will take care ot approx
imately 80 women. Each unit will
have its own set of social rooms,
as have the other casas.
Lagunita can well boast of its
food, even after rushing is over,
and except for a vegetable plate
which slips by now and then, ap
petites are well satisfied.
The lake and golf-course are
just around Lagunita's various cor
ners; these inducements being

favorably regarded by both the
romanticist and the athlete, Lag
unita lias the jump on the rest of
tiie campus for proximity and con
venience.
One of the greatest arguments
for the "Stanford is just a country
club" contention is the inner court
of Lagunita in the spring, which
resembles a cross between Palm
Beach and Palm Springs, and
wherein the coed indulges in sever
al shades of suntan.
While the new additions will take
care of many of the present Roble
inmates, the remainder will find
quarters in the Union, Madrono,
and Mariposa, smaller units and
located near the Quad.
