# "Morning After" Leaves Row Dizzy
## 
### 
The Row this morning had a
huge headacheâ€”results of unofficial
celebrating of official pledging.
Lawns were strewn with bottles
and cans, and shrubbery was blown
to bits by giant firecrackers. Pub
lic address systems last night blew
music up and down the Row. And
that it was the Year's Biggest
Night, someone started turning a
siren. After two hours, at 20 min
utes of 4, he stopped. And 1936-
37 men's rushing was over.
fheta Xi leads pledging with 20
new men signed up. Theta Chi,
Beta I heta Pi, Delta Tau Delta,
and Phi Gamma Delta shared sec
ond place with 17 each. Though
Sigma Chi announced 30 pledges,
these included sophomores who
could not pledge last year because
of penalties against the house.
