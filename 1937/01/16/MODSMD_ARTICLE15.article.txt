# Prosh Cagers Win, 53 to 36
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
One of the strongest freshmen
teams to pound the Pavilion hard
wood in many a year last night
showed their ability not only as a
high-scoring machine, but also as
a tight defensive outfit, taking it
easy to snow under the Sacramento
Junior Collegians, 53-36.
Beautiful teamwork throughout
the game gave the frosh their vict
ory. Off to a fast start by virtue
of Siebert's set-up and free throw,
the yearlings kept piling up points,
although they were passed once
