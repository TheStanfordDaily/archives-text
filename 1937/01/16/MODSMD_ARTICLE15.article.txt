# Prosh Cagers Win, 53 to 36
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
One of the strongest freshmen
teams to pound the Pavilion hard
wood in many a year last night
showed their ability not only as a
high-scoring machine, but also as
a tight defensive outfit, taking it
easy to snow under the Sacramento
Junior Collegians, 53-36.
Beautiful teamwork throughout
the game gave the frosh their vict
ory. Off to a fast start by virtue
of Siebert's set-up and free throw,
the yearlings kept piling up points,
although they were passed once
soon after the start when the Jay
see went into the lead by one
bucket, 9-7. That was the only
time the Encinamen were on the
tail-end of the count.
Leading at half, 20-15, the pap
ooses roared on to mark up 33
points to their opponents' 21 dur
ing the second period, due to dead
ly passing by everyone concerned
and to fast follow shots by Lyon
and Siebert.
Acting Captain Gil Ralin and his
running mate at the guard spots,
Andy Anderson, did right well on
defense, limiting the boys from
Sacto almost entirely to long shots.
Mr. Siebert, who enjoys barrel
ing down the floor with all the
daintiness of an elephant, was again
high-point man, ringing the bell for
17 digits, while Lyon, Staehle, Andy
Anderson, Rhan, Leckie, and Bur
roughs Anderson aided materially
in the win making 36 points be
tween them. Sacramento's top man
was Irwin, with 13 to his credit.
