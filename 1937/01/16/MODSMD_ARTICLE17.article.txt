# Cards Swamp Uclans In Series Opener
## Speed, Power Leads To 63-40 Trampling 
### Walt Peterson 
With one of the two U.C.L.A.
tilts sockcd away after they gave
the Bruins a conference-opening
lesson in basketball, 63-40, in the
Pavilion last night, Stanford's
phenomenal varsity cagers close
tonight the first half of the annual
four-game series as distinct favor
ites to repeat.
Take Strong Lead
Showing just too much speed,
power, and good basketball in gen
eral for the bewildered Westwood
outfit, the Cards opened the game
with a scoring burst that netted
them a 14-2 lead in the first seven
minutes. Out of seven field gold
attempts six were bucketed in that
time. They were coupled with a
pair of foul throws by Luisetti to
crack the Bruin morale in little
pieces before the Little Brothers
had a chance to get started.
U.C.L.A. controlled the opening
tipofF, but lost the ball on an inter
ception before they had a chance to
make a shot. In about 15 seconds
Turner found Calderwood open
under the basket and with a fast
pass and a cinch set-up the fire
works started. Turner with a field
goal, Luisetti with two foul throws,
and then a field goal gave Stanford
eight points before Big John Ball
tanked one for Ucla.
Two more goals by the incom
parable Luisetti and then one by
Turner ended the first blast of
offensive explosives that left the
Caddy Works-coached team more
than slightly befuddled.
Rather a Rout
From then on, with the except
ion of a few bursts, the Crimson
Crushers made systematic the rout
of the southland gang. When
things began to get too rough in
the second half Luisetti and Tur
ner were replaced by Robertson
and Quadc and everything was just
dandy.
"Bebc" Lee, the mighty mite, re
placed Captain "Squinty" Moore
after seven minutes of the second
half, but it wasn't long before Orv
Appleby, Bruin forward, had his
feet knocked from under him in a
scramble and fell on Lee. The
little guy spent about half a minute
getting back his senses, and then
was replaced by Moore. He suf

fered a pretty bad jar on the head,
and was kept in the hospital over
night. He will be kept out of the
game tonight, but will be in shape
to play Monday again.
Half Time Lead
Nellie Heath later replaced
Moore, Bob Zonne substituted for
Jack Calderwood, and with Phil
Zonne at center for Art Stoefen
with Robertson and Qitade at for
wards the battle developed into
more of a rough and tumble match
than a basketball game before the
final gun.
Half-time score was 37-22 for
Stanford, with the entire first team
of Luisetti, Turner, Stoefen, Moore,
and Calderwood playing straight
through. There was a little dus
cussion at the end of the first
period, when one of the typical
wise guys in the stands shot off a
gun with but six and one-half sec
onds to play. After a slight object
ion from the timers' bench it was
decided to let the funny man have
his way.

An expedition to search for fossil

With one of the two U.C.L.A.
tilts sockcd away after they gave
the Bruins a conference-opening
lesson in basketball, 63-40, in the
Pavilion last night, Stanford's
phenomenal varsity cagers close
tonight the first half of the annual
four-game series as distinct favor
ites to repeat.
Take Strong Lead
Showing just too much speed,
power, and good basketball in gen
eral for the bewildered Westwood
outfit, the Cards opened the game
with a scoring burst that netted
them a 14-2 lead in the first seven
minutes. Out of seven field gold
attempts six were bucketed in that
time. They were coupled with a
pair of foul throws by Luisetti to
crack the Bruin morale in little
pieces before the Little Brothers
had a chance to get started.
U.C.L.A. controlled the opening
tipofF, but lost the ball on an inter
ception before they had a chance to
make a shot. In about 15 seconds
Turner found Calderwood open
under the basket and with a fast
pass and a cinch set-up the fire
works started. Turner with a field
goal, Luisetti with two foul throws,
and then a field goal gave Stanford
eight points before Big John Ball
tanked one for Ucla.
Two more goals by the incom
parable Luisetti and then one by
Turner ended the first blast of
offensive explosives that left the
Caddy Works-coached team more
than slightly befuddled.
Rather a Rout
From then on, with the except
ion of a few bursts, the Crimson
Crushers made systematic the rout
of the southland gang. When
things began to get too rough in
the second half Luisetti and Tur
ner were replaced by Robertson
and Quadc and everything was just
dandy.
"Bebc" Lee, the mighty mite, re
placed Captain "Squinty" Moore
after seven minutes of the second
half, but it wasn't long before Orv
Appleby, Bruin forward, had his
feet knocked from under him in a
scramble and fell on Lee. The
little guy spent about half a minute
getting back his senses, and then
was replaced by Moore. He suf

fered a pretty bad jar on the head,
and was kept in the hospital over
night. He will be kept out of the
game tonight, but will be in shape
to play Monday again.
Half Time Lead
Nellie Heath later replaced
Moore, Bob Zonne substituted for
Jack Calderwood, and with Phil
Zonne at center for Art Stoefen
with Robertson and Qitade at for
wards the battle developed into
more of a rough and tumble match
than a basketball game before the
final gun.
Half-time score was 37-22 for
Stanford, with the entire first team
of Luisetti, Turner, Stoefen, Moore,
and Calderwood playing straight
through. There was a little dus
cussion at the end of the first
period, when one of the typical
wise guys in the stands shot off a
gun with but six and one-half sec
onds to play. After a slight object
ion from the timers' bench it was
decided to let the funny man have
his way.

game tonight, but will be in shape
to play Monday again.
Half Time Lead
Nellie Heath later replaced
Moore, Bob Zonne substituted for
Jack Calderwood, and with Phil
Zonne at center for Art Stoefen
with Robertson and Qitade at for
wards the battle developed into
more of a rough and tumble match
than a basketball game before the
final gun.
Half-time score was 37-22 for
Stanford, with the entire first team
of Luisetti, Turner, Stoefen, Moore,
and Calderwood playing straight
through. There was a little dus
cussion at the end of the first
period, when one of the typical
wise guys in the stands shot off a
gun with but six and one-half sec
onds to play. After a slight object
ion from the timers' bench it was
decided to let the funny man have
his way.

With one of the two U.C.L.A.
tilts sockcd away after they gave
the Bruins a conference-opening
lesson in basketball, 63-40, in the
Pavilion last night, Stanford's
phenomenal varsity cagers close
tonight the first half of the annual
four-game series as distinct favor
ites to repeat.
Take Strong Lead
Showing just too much speed,
power, and good basketball in gen
eral for the bewildered Westwood
outfit, the Cards opened the game
with a scoring burst that netted
them a 14-2 lead in the first seven
minutes. Out of seven field gold
attempts six were bucketed in that
time. They were coupled with a
pair of foul throws by Luisetti to
crack the Bruin morale in little
pieces before the Little Brothers
had a chance to get started.
U.C.L.A. controlled the opening
tipofF, but lost the ball on an inter
ception before they had a chance to
make a shot. In about 15 seconds
Turner found Calderwood open
under the basket and with a fast
pass and a cinch set-up the fire
works started. Turner with a field
goal, Luisetti with two foul throws,
and then a field goal gave Stanford
eight points before Big John Ball
tanked one for Ucla.
Two more goals by the incom
parable Luisetti and then one by
Turner ended the first blast of
offensive explosives that left the
Caddy Works-coached team more
than slightly befuddled.
Rather a Rout
From then on, with the except
ion of a few bursts, the Crimson
Crushers made systematic the rout
of the southland gang. When
things began to get too rough in
the second half Luisetti and Tur
ner were replaced by Robertson
and Quadc and everything was just
dandy.
"Bebc" Lee, the mighty mite, re
placed Captain "Squinty" Moore
after seven minutes of the second
half, but it wasn't long before Orv
Appleby, Bruin forward, had his
feet knocked from under him in a
scramble and fell on Lee. The
little guy spent about half a minute
getting back his senses, and then
was replaced by Moore. He suf

fered a pretty bad jar on the head,
and was kept in the hospital over
night. He will be kept out of the
game tonight, but will be in shape
to play Monday again.
