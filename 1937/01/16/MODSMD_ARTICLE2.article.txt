# How They Got Them — And How They Lost Them

Post mortems being the distaste
ful things they are, and all campus
rushing coinciding, let's have a
peek in at what went on in this
hubdub of grinning faces and
flowing chiffons. Women's Rushing,
take your bow!
Kindergarten tactics, grammar
school entertainment, and a grilling
period of almost almost anti-social
stiffness were all ingredients in a
rushing stew that certainly lacked
seasoning—why wait 'til Winter
Quarter to pronounce verdict on
the many coeds who came to Stan
ford to go Row, and then •are told
in an indirect way that they aren't
good enough!
Alpha Phi specialized in fancy
records, back room huddles, and
the intimacy of the 'dansc'. When
an active sought to waltze or do a
Balboa Hop with a prospective
'nugget' it was, "I can't lead, can
you?" or "don't look now, but your
stepping on my train."
Kappa's love their blue, or so
the song goes... to the tune of
"Sweet Mom Inez". .Maybe there's
something in that! "Sedate ami
dignified, they only sit and talk."
reported one frosh woman who al
so complained that they parked her
in a draft when she had a cold,
"but they did have good fried
chicken," she added.
Theta's put their rushces to the

test, so it seems. They would start
the evening off with a lively game
of musical chairs to test their stam
ina, then a game of numbers for
their 1.Q., and then ping pong for
agility. Let's add that there was
no dancing, but do not forget that
they tactfully served fish on Friday
and played 'Mv Grandmother Went
to Paris'—and became a Theta.
"Deegee serves pie a la mode,
and they have the cutest hashers!"
—a Delta Gamma-loving frosh ex
claimed. One D. G. with the init
ials P. G. hulas for the girls in a
rather barbaric, flapping, cello
phane grass skirt, which anybody
who has seen it will agree is really
D. G. After the show is over, they
all dance—"This is just the custom
ary thing—let's dance."
Chi O finds that they can't learn
anything about the yearlings thro
ugh the rattle of silver, the gurple
of soup, and the incessant jabber
of "What's your name, do you
like Stanford, and what courses
are you taking?—it's almost as bad
as men's rushing. They pet around
this, however, by sending stooges
to friends of the girls in question
to dig up their past, their family
tree, and to be sure they arc of the
necessary caliber.
Pi Phi boasted many future Galli
Curcis, and songfest was their
pastime, They even sang goodbye

iii unison as the Roblc misses part
ed, but as soon as they left, they
were at each other's throats to get
their respective friends bids.
Gamma Phi and Tri-Delt would
just be repetition, but still Roble's
Broken Hearts Club filled up fast
today with lots of sobbing lassies,
who think they are going to be
hall lobby lizards or social outcasts
—and definitely are not
