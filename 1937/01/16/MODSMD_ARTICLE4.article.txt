# Nine Sororities Pledge 108 Women
## D G's Lead With 15; Alpha Phi's Second

Terrific!
That's the only way to describe the pledge classes, says
the Row.
With 108 women joining sororities, the Class of 1940 con
tained an amazingly large amount of excellent material, they
add.
Most classes were rounded up unusually early in the period.
Women talked about the weather; they talked about their frat
ernity neighbors; but they can not imply a bid. "Do you like
our house" is the simple way, but the illegal way. So being

sure of the majority of pledges be-<
fore preference nights implies un
usual cooperation between houses,
and unusual numbers of pledgable
women.
Delta Gamma led the race by
pledging up fifteen women, follow
ed by Alpha Phi with 14, and Chi
Omega with 13.
Only one charge of illegal rush
ing marred this year under the
leadership of Nancy Gray. That
was unsubstantiated.
Cutting the dinner hour from
8:30 to 8 o'clock resulted in less
boredom, less forced conversation,
more spontaneity.
It's All Fun
But to fill the 45 minute gap
between the end of dinner and the
going-home hour, houses resorted
to musical chairs, guessing games,
charades, everything but hide and
go seek which the pledges were
carrying on independently. The
women even danced with each
other, as usual. More than one
house saw the tragic spectacle of
a five-foot rusher struggling man
fully in a fox-trot with a five-foot
seven rushee.
Maximum number of pledges in
each house were fixed in conference
with Dean of Women Mary Yost,
graduates and the capacity of the
house. Alternate lists were sent
in by some houses, still uncertain
of their classes, to fill up their
quota in case of failure or some
potential nugget to pledge.
Celebrate To-night
Tonight all houses arc celebrat
ing the success of the period with
food, jolly-up, ceremonies after the
doors arc closed. Pajama-clad
sorority women will bundle them
selves into cars to stay overnight
with friends, so that the rushees
may sleep luxuriously until late
in the morning and eat breakfast
in bed at the house of their choice.
