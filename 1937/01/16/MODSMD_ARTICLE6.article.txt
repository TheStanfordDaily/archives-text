# Rushing Is Over! Hurrah, Hurrah
## 
### A ROW WOMAN 
Rushing is over, hurrah, hurrah!
That was concurrent opinion of the
tired Row as it started tucking
tired pledges into sagging beds to
night. What was good about rush
ing?—A limited chance to meet
freshmen—and the food. It will
be hard living on hamburger and
beans for the rest of the quarter,
but at least we will be able to relax.
What was bad about it? Plenty.
Rushing at Stanford is about as
stiff, as strained, as unpleasant as
rushing, not a pretty business any
how, can be anywhere. There
were rules, many rules. And the
rules specified not only when we
entertained, but what we wore,
whom we saw and spoke to, and
what we spoke about. At no time,
for instance, were we allowed to
mention sorority life in our own
or other's sororities. Consequently
conversation limited itself, at least
for the first two periods, to Roble,
biology, and the weather. The cold
spell was a blessing, as well as the
funny tricks of our hashers.
