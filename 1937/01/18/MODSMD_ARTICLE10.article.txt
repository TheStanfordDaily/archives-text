Instead of the Monday staff meeting (Daily (except Sat
urday and Sunday) staff members will moan over to the Shack
at 1:15 this afternoon to take the newly installed "Civil Serv
ice" exes. Staff promotions, which are next Tuesday, hang in
the balance. Contrary to previous announcement, the editor
has thought up a quiz for every member. But does anybody
know any good gags?
