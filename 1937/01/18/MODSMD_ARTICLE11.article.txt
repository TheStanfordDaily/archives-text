# Married Women Working
## 
### 
What would be the consequences
of married women working? The
question is, of course, no longer aca
demic. In 1890 only 13. pre9ctne
demic. In 1890 only 13.9 per cent of
women workers were married; in
1930, with a larger total of women,
28.9 per cent of them are married.
Over 3,000,000 wives in this country
are gainfully employed; this does not
count the nearly 2,000,000 self-sup
porting widows and divorcees. Of all
married women in this country,
nearly one out of eight works for
income. Our attitudes must be shap
ed in reference to the realities before
us.
If the work married women found
to do was of their own choice (and
surely they should always be free to
choose housework if they prefer); if
this work was remunerated fairly,
we might find large-scale readjust
ments, particularly in regard to the
help problem. Well paid women, do
ing interesting work, would pay well

for servants better satisfied than they
with the work of housekeeper. With
better pay, the work of housekeeper
would assume new dignity. The in
creased necessity for nursery schools
(already demanded as a source of
companionship for the young child
because of the small family size to
day) would lead to an increase in the
salary scale and hence in the selec
tion of trained workers in that highly
important field.
With fewer people making a fetish
of housework, more and more of the
household drudgery (like the laun
dry) would be turned over to indus
trial plants better equipped for the
tasks. Canneries could pay better
wages, if college trained wives did
not stay home putting up the fruit
and vegetables themselves in order
to save a cent here and there. Inci
dentally, they would be less likely to
poison their families.
Those who object to the married

woman working, when not forced by
dire necesstiy to do so, have one final,
and to them unanswerable, argu
ment: What about the woman as
mother? It is true that the bearing
of children causes the woman a cer
tain amount of personal inconven
ience not shared by the man. If we
are realistic about it, however, we
will not force a woman to withdraw
from creative economic life because
of several years of child-bearing.
Many men have been invalided for
periods of years without being de
niejl ever afterwards the privilege of
participating in the work of the
world.
As for caring for the children, some
of us believe that babies need fathers
as well as mothers. Providing the
companionship and affection which
only parents can give is the task of
both parents. The vegetative func
tions can be taken care of by compe
tently trained help; it would be a
waste to have mother trained for
such competence if they are to handle
only a few babies of their own. A
working mother, like a working fa
ther, under any decent conditions
will have time for life with the fam
ily. If the mother does not have to
find her whole outlet in her child, we
may be saved in- another generation
from some of the painful situations
which arise because children do,
after all, grow up.

With fewer people making a fetish
of housework, more and more of the
household drudgery (like the laun
dry) would be turned over to indus
trial plants better equipped for the
tasks. Canneries could pay better
wages, if college trained wives did
not stay home putting up the fruit

to save a cent here and there. Inci
dentally, they would be less likely to
poison their families.
Those who object to the married

woman working, when not forced by
dire necesstiy to do so, have one final,
and to them unanswerable, argu
ment: What about the woman as
mother? It is true that the bearing
of children causes the woman a cer
tain amount of personal inconven
ience not shared by the man. If we
are realistic about it, however, we
will not force a woman to withdraw
from creative economic life because
of several years of child-bearing.
Many men have been invalided for

As for caring for the children, some
of us believe that babies need fathers
as well as mothers. Providing the
companionship and affection which
only parents can give is the task of
both parents. The vegetative func
tions can be taken care of by compe
tently trained help; it would be a
waste to have mother trained for
such competence if they are to handle
only a few babies of their own. A
working mother, like a working fa
ther, under any decent conditions
will have time for life with the fam
ily. If the mother does not have to
find her whole outlet in her child, we
may be saved in- another generation
from some of the painful situations
which arise because children do,
after all, grow up.

What would be the consequences
of married women working? The
question is, of course, no longer aca
demic. In 1890 only 13. pre9ctne
demic. In 1890 only 13.9 per cent of
women workers were married; in
1930, with a larger total of women,
28.9 per cent of them are married.
Over 3,000,000 wives in this country
are gainfully employed; this does not
count the nearly 2,000,000 self-sup
porting widows and divorcees. Of all
married women in this country,
nearly one out of eight works for
income. Our attitudes must be shap
ed in reference to the realities before
us.
If the work married women found
to do was of their own choice (and
surely they should always be free to
choose housework if they prefer); if
this work was remunerated fairly,
we might find large-scale readjust
ments, particularly in regard to the
help problem. Well paid women, do
ing interesting work, would pay well

for servants better satisfied than they
with the work of housekeeper. With
better pay, the work of housekeeper
would assume new dignity. The in
creased necessity for nursery schools
(already demanded as a source of
companionship for the young child
because of the small family size to
day) would lead to an increase in the
salary scale and hence in the selec
tion of trained workers in that highly
important field.
