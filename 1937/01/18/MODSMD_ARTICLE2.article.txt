4 FTER nearly 50 years of steady growth and service, Stanford University .
" is faced with a serious problem of financing its development during the
years to come. In 1900 Stanford had the highest endowment of any Amer
ican University, but in 1932 the University had fallen to twentieth place.
During the period the Stanford endowment grew from $21,000 to $32,000,000
but Harvard, which was second in 1900. enlarged its endowment during the
-ame period from 12 millions to 108 millions and Yale from 5 to 93 millions.
Today, in order to continue its development, the University must take
one of two courses: increase tuition which is already regarded as too higk
to be in keeping with the intentions of Senator Leland Stanford and Mrs.
Stanford as laid down in the founding grant; or to increase the endowment
by means of a long-range fund-raising program similar to those under
taken by other leading endowed universities.
Course of Stanford Associates
The latter is the course chosen by Stanford Associates, a group of 250
distinguished alumni organized in 1934 under the leadership of Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, in sponsoring the Stanford Fund. According to a bulletin pub
lished by the Associates, funds will be solicited from alumni and others
interested in the University in two general channels:
1. Direct solicitation of alumni through class agents who will ask for con
tributions from class members.
2. An organized effort through Stanford attorneys and trust institutions

to encourage bequests and trusts
favor of Stanford. Through this chan- j
nel it is hoped to offer a variety of 1
attractive opportunities to persons of !
philanthropic mind. This effort will
be directed by a special committee
composed of the Comptroller of the !
University, the chairman of the Trus I
tees' Committee on Public Relations, i
the attorney for the Board of Trus
tees, the president of Stanford Asso- ;
ciates, and appointed members repre
senting the legal profession and fin- I
ancial institutions.

Stanford will soon have a new educa

" is faced with a serious problem of financing its development during the

During the period the Stanford endowment grew from $21,000 to $32,000,000

" is faced with a serious problem of financing its development during the
years to come. In 1900 Stanford had the highest endowment of any Amer
ican University, but in 1932 the University had fallen to twentieth place.
During the period the Stanford endowment grew from $21,000 to $32,000,000
but Harvard, which was second in 1900. enlarged its endowment during the
-ame period from 12 millions to 108 millions and Yale from 5 to 93 millions.
Today, in order to continue its development, the University must take
one of two courses: increase tuition which is already regarded as too higk
to be in keeping with the intentions of Senator Leland Stanford and Mrs.
Stanford as laid down in the founding grant; or to increase the endowment
by means of a long-range fund-raising program similar to those under
taken by other leading endowed universities.
Course of Stanford Associates
The latter is the course chosen by Stanford Associates, a group of 250
distinguished alumni organized in 1934 under the leadership of Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, in sponsoring the Stanford Fund. According to a bulletin pub
lished by the Associates, funds will be solicited from alumni and others
interested in the University in two general channels:
1. Direct solicitation of alumni through class agents who will ask for con
tributions from class members.
2. An organized effort through Stanford attorneys and trust institutions

to encourage bequests and trusts
favor of Stanford. Through this chan- j
nel it is hoped to offer a variety of 1
attractive opportunities to persons of !
philanthropic mind. This effort will
be directed by a special committee
composed of the Comptroller of the !
University, the chairman of the Trus I
tees' Committee on Public Relations, i
the attorney for the Board of Trus
tees, the president of Stanford Asso- ;
ciates, and appointed members repre
senting the legal profession and fin- I
