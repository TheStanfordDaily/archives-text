University of Edinburgh is
known throughout Europe as a
new institution, because it was
founded in 1583, without the neces
sity of securing a Papal Bull. St.
Andrews, on the other hand, was ini
tiated by episcopal enterprise in
1411. Edinburgh, therefore, is not
distinguished because it is the old
est Scottish University, but rather,
because it adopted the "modern"
educational methods of the 16th Cen
tury from the Universities on the
Continent, particularly those of Ley
den and Paris.
For the first 120 years, all instruc
tion was in Latin and Greek. Regent
masters were required to take each
new group of students through four
years of study, and a thesis, written
in Latin, was required before the
student was granted the degree.
In 1590, the Lords of the Session,
Faculty of Advocates, and the Society
of Writers to the Signet, endowed a
Chair of Law, which was welcomed
by parents of Scotsman who desired
to keep their sons near the Kirk. At
first, degrees in theology and arts
were the only degrees granted, and
the Scotsman, whose difference of
religion, dress, and accent caused
him to be ill-treated at Oxford, had
journeyed to the Continent for his
professional training, particularly at
Bologna, Paris, and Leyden.
Moral Discipline
These Universities, however, did
not furnish enough moral discipline
to satisfy parents who had been
swayed by the eloquence of John
Knox. Less than a century later, the
College of Physicians and Surgeons
offered to tutor students in Edin
burgh without charge.
In 1748, Adam Smith, the cele
brated author of the "Wealth of Na
tions," lectured on Rhetoric, under
the patronage of Lord Karnes. In
1762, King George 111 created a
Regius Chair of Rhetoriq, and fpr
over 20 years, Dr. Hugh Blair gave
lectures on Rhetoric and Public Ad
dress. This Chair is still filled by
royal appointment, and the present
incumbent, Professor Dover Wilson,
is known to many members of the
Stanford faculty.
Among the prominent men who at
tended Edinburgh are Robert L.
Stevenson, Thomas Carlyle, James
Boswell, and Oliver Goldsmith. Sir
James Mathew Barrie, famous as the
writer of "Peter Pan," is the present
Lord Chancellor of the University.
He is still interested in dramatic lit
erature, and his latest play, "The Boy
David," is now being shown in Lon
don.
Debating has always been promi
nent in Scotland, and the minutes of
the Dialectic Society record that in
1792, speakers who proposed that
Britain had profited by the loss of
the American colonies, won a unani
mous decision.
Prominent Alumni
Undergraduate life today in Scot
land is not unlike life in an American
university, except for slight differ
ences in accent, dress, and expres
sion. Freshmen are called "Fresh
ers," one "reads for a degree" and
"stands for an examination." About
Â©ne-third of the students wear kilts
(o classes, and about two-thirds wear
dress kilts on formal occasions. The
most popular dances are "The Dash
ing White Sergeant" and "The Mili-
