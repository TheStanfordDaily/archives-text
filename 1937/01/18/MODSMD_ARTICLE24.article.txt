$50,000 comes to Stanford by the
will of John M. Switzer, '98, who
died in New York December 30. The
bequest will be used to support a
loan and scholarship fund in the
donor's name. Stanford was also
named residuary legatee of the es
tate, by which condition the fund
may reach to between $200,000 and
$350,000.
Hetch-Hetchy water may soon j
serve Stanford students through 36-
inch mains before summer as a re
sult of Comptroller Roth's investiga
tions. Plans for a large lake in the
hills probably will not be affected.
i
Kentucky's system probably gives
the cue to Stanford's R.Q.T.C. which
will elect a woman honorary colonel
for its military ball.
Action on the four items on Ex
Committee's agenda was deferred.
There include: the Nitery, changing
of election dates from May to Feb- I
ruary, approval of California's Youth
Act, the establishing of wrestling as
a minor sport.
Bucknell University has adopted a |
plan to provide funds to enable par
ents to educate their children.
