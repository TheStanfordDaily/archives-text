# THOUGHTS OF A CRITIC-By Ellington
## 
### 
Our little feathere hopping friends
Are hopping in the grass,
So green and tall.
Together.
J'M almost positive this isn't a son
net. It hasn't fourteen lines. And,
too, the thought isn't quite deep or
worldly enough to be real sonnet
material.
I'm not quite sure what form of
verse it really is. It is something like
that French form—or is it Japanese?
* * *
However that may be, this surely
isn't a sonnet. Now ( taken in order,
the first line has four accented syl
lables, the second, three, the third,
two, and the fourth, only one. This
kind of verse must be terribly diffi
cult to write. It shows the effort in
every word, though. So condensed
is the thought in this poem, that it
evokes an extremely clear picture.
Can't you just see the little birds
hopping around and about in the
dtrep, gieeli gl'aisS?
Notice the poet did not mention
the species of the gird that was thus
hopping. This was true subtlety.
You can use your own imagination
and till in the kind of bird that is to
be found in greater numbers in your
particular section of the country.
* # *
Whereas I might fill in blackbirds,

you might use sparrows. Of course,
this gives the poem much more uni
versal appeal. Another device which
captured my attention was the use
of repetition. You will notice, if you
scan the poem very carefully, that
the word "hopping" is repeated twice
in the first two lines. This is par
ticularly effective in a poem of such
shortness.
* * *
If the poet had said "hopping" the
first time, and, shall we say, "stroll
ing" the second time, the effect
would not be nearly so impressive
as the two "hoppings." The fii'st line
has a particular swing to it. No

tice: "Our little feathered hopping
friends." Not only is the meter per
fect, but it gives the effect of birds
hopping about jerkily in the grass.
It thus becomes a sort of adaptation
of sound to sight.
The concluding line of the poem—
the word "together"—carries a much
deeper connotation than the word
by itself could possibly carry. You
feel the deep desire of animals to
instinctively gather together in
groups rather than to stay separate
and breast adversity alone.
The deep, soothing comfort of pro
etctioh in humbers seems the very
basis of this poem.

captured my attention was the use
of repetition. You will notice, if you
scan the poem very carefully, that
the word "hopping" is repeated twice
in the first two lines. This is par
ticularly effective in a poem of such
shortness.

If the poet had said "hopping" the
first time, and, shall we say, "stroll
ing" the second time, the effect
would not be nearly so impressive
as the two "hoppings." The fii'st line
has a particular swing to it. No

tice: "Our little feathered hopping
friends." Not only is the meter per
fect, but it gives the effect of birds
hopping about jerkily in the grass.
It thus becomes a sort of adaptation
of sound to sight.
The concluding line of the poem—
the word "together"—carries a much
deeper connotation than the word
by itself could possibly carry. You
feel the deep desire of animals to
instinctively gather together in
groups rather than to stay separate
and breast adversity alone.
The deep, soothing comfort of pro
etctioh in humbers seems the very
basis of this poem.
Our little feathere hopping friends
Are hopping in the grass,
So green and tall.
Together.
J'M almost positive this isn't a son
net. It hasn't fourteen lines. And,
too, the thought isn't quite deep or
worldly enough to be real sonnet
material.
I'm not quite sure what form of
verse it really is. It is something like
that French form—or is it Japanese?
* * *
However that may be, this surely
isn't a sonnet. Now ( taken in order,
the first line has four accented syl
lables, the second, three, the third,
two, and the fourth, only one. This
kind of verse must be terribly diffi
cult to write. It shows the effort in
every word, though. So condensed
is the thought in this poem, that it
evokes an extremely clear picture.
Can't you just see the little birds
hopping around and about in the
dtrep, gieeli gl'aisS?
Notice the poet did not mention
the species of the gird that was thus
hopping. This was true subtlety.
You can use your own imagination
and till in the kind of bird that is to
be found in greater numbers in your
particular section of the country.

Whereas I might fill in blackbirds,

you might use sparrows. Of course,
this gives the poem much more uni
versal appeal. Another device which
