# Prom Spaghetti, et. al, — $480 Nearly $200 to Be Refunded
## 
### GEORGE VENESS 
/ I ONTRARY to the popular opinion
among most people, giving a
dance at Stanford demands a great
deal more money than that required
in merely hiring a hall and a band,
as can be been in checking the ex
penditure of $1041.90 which was the
approximate amount invested in last
Friday's Pledge Prom.
Largest single expenditure went

for the spaghetti breakfast, served
with ice cream, coffee, and rolls for
970 couples — total $480, including
caterer's fee. Second largest ex
pense was for music—both bands
(non-union) used $175.
The Interfraternity Council paid
the Stanford Piper $30 for the use of
the dance floors, and $15 to the Corp
Yard for a truck to haul chairs, etc.
Decorations in the two rooms cost
$140, which was the most reasonable
contract in several years.
Student workers collected their
share in the investment; B.A.C. po
licemen earned $55 keeping order;
and $20.50 was paid out to workers
for labor in setting up chairs, put
ting' up decorations and other menial
tasks.
The checking service cost the fra

ternities $25; punch for the entire
evening was $58.20 and the public
address system used $6 of the total.
Incidentals included piano rent,
$15; matron fee, $3; cigars, cigarettes,
candy, etc., for the patrons cost al
most $12. The printing of tickets of
admission was $7.20.
In order to pay the amazing total
of $1041.90 thus incurred, each fra
ternity was required to buy as many
tickets at $1.25 as it had active mem
bers and pledges. Figures were ob
tained from Dean Culver for this

purpose.
From the sale of 970 tickets
31212.50 was taken in. The $170.60
difference will be refunded to such
houses as exceeded their quota, and
the rest will go into the Interfrater
nity Council treasury, according to
Ralph Huntberger, dance chairman.

An experiment in artificial evolu
tion is to be undertaken at the Lon
don Zoo, where an attempt will b£
made to breed a tiger-lion or "ti
gron."

most $12. The printing of tickets of
admission was $7.20.
In order to pay the amazing total
of $1041.90 thus incurred, each fra
ternity was required to buy as many
tickets at $1.25 as it had active mem

purpose.
From the sale of 970 tickets
31212.50 was taken in. The $170.60
difference will be refunded to such
houses as exceeded their quota, and
the rest will go into the Interfrater

Ralph Huntberger, dance chairman.

/ I ONTRARY to the popular opinion
among most people, giving a
dance at Stanford demands a great
deal more money than that required
in merely hiring a hall and a band,
as can be been in checking the ex
penditure of $1041.90 which was the
approximate amount invested in last
Friday's Pledge Prom.
Largest single expenditure went

for the spaghetti breakfast, served
with ice cream, coffee, and rolls for
970 couples — total $480, including
caterer's fee. Second largest ex
pense was for music—both bands
(non-union) used $175.
The Interfraternity Council paid
the Stanford Piper $30 for the use of
the dance floors, and $15 to the Corp
Yard for a truck to haul chairs, etc.
Decorations in the two rooms cost
$140, which was the most reasonable
contract in several years.
Student workers collected their
share in the investment; B.A.C. po
licemen earned $55 keeping order;
and $20.50 was paid out to workers
for labor in setting up chairs, put
ting' up decorations and other menial
tasks.
The checking service cost the fra

ternities $25; punch for the entire
evening was $58.20 and the public
address system used $6 of the total.
Incidentals included piano rent,
$15; matron fee, $3; cigars, cigarettes,
candy, etc., for the patrons cost al
most $12. The printing of tickets of
admission was $7.20.
