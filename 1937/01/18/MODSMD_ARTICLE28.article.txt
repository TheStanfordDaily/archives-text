# Cards Crack Southern Division Score Record
## 
### WALT PETERSON 
After tying the previous southern
division conference high-scoring rec
ord with their 63-40 murder of the
U.C.L.A. team Friday night, Stan
ford's varsity hoopmen cracked that
mark with a G9-3G pasting of the
Bruins Saturday night in the Pavil
ion.
The former record was held by
California, and was set, oddly
enough, against this same Stanford
varsity last year in Edwards Gym at
Berkeley, 63-30.
Not satisfied with just another de
cisive win Saturday night, after the

ji
. All students intending to
( travel to Edwards Gym in Ber
j kcley this coming Friday night

California basketball scries are
directed to purchase 40-cent
student tickets at the B.A.C.
! booth either today or tomorrow.
Hours are 8:30 to 5:00, and the

I
Bruins displayed too many rough
tactics in the first game, the Cards,
led by the indescribable Hank Lui
setti with a 23-point total, sti"ode
through the first half like five Paul
J?taiyans in Lilliput to wind up the
period leading 35-12.
Moore Out on Fouls
About two minutes before the in
iermission gun, Dinty Moore, fiery
leader of the Crimson Giants, went
out of the game on four personal
fouls, to be replaced by the inexpe
rienced but promising Bill Schuette.
The squinty one, ired by the rough
house play of the Westwood outfit,
got tangled up once too often with a
Uclan to please arbiters Leith and
Bailly.
Luisetti was the only one of the
first five to play at all during the
second half, Bob Zonne replacing
Jack Calderwood, Phil Zonne coming
in for Art Stoefen, and Quade taking
Turner's place for the second period.
Schuette played a major portion of
the second half, to be replaced nearly
at the close by Nellie Heath. Dick
Lyon came in for Luisetti with about
five minutes to play, and scored six
points.
With the two Bruin tilts so suc
cessfully salted down, the Cards look
to the first Cal game Friday night
with an unhealthy gleam in their
eyesâ€”unhealthy for the Bears. U.S.C.
took a pair from Nibs Price and his
team over the week-end in Los An
geles, the first 41-37 and the second
35-34. The latter game was tied up
34-34 with 30 seconds to play, when
Trojan Anderson sank a foul throw
to post the winning tally. Captain
Ray Balsley, Bear forward, had a
chance to do likewise five seconds
before the gun but couldn't find the

hoop on his toss.
When one remembers that Troy
played both games without their
captain, Eddie Oram, All-Coast
guard last year with Calderwood,
chances look bright for a Stanford
victory in Edwards Gym Friday
night. Such a case would be the
first.
