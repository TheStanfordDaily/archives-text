## Papooses Trailing 15-20 At Half Time, Seibert Still High â€“ point Man 
### 
Stanford's frosh cagers won the
hard way Saturday night, coming
from behind to whip the Modesto
Junior Collegians into submission,
39-31, after fighting their way
through what appeared to be, accord
ing to advance publicity, the toughest
game on their schedule.
The Modestos roared full speed
ahead on the tide until about 10
minutes of the second half had ticked
away, when they met a tidal wave
coming the opposite direction in the
form of Bob Oakford. fiery forward,
who, in the opinion of his team
mates, is the best front-line defen
sive man on the squad. Whipping
passes from everyplace on the court
to exactly the right place at the right
time, Oakford fired the team into the
lead.
The whole thing happened, when,
in quick succession, Lafaille took a
look pass from Oakford, barely lift
ing it from the finger tips of a Mo
desto guard, to go in for an easy set
up. tieing the score at 28 apiece.
This was immediately followed by a
short shot by Siebert, who took
Rahn's tip from a jump to put the
yearlings into a two-point lead. On
the heels of this shot came another
long pass from Oakford which La
faille hooked out of the stratosphere
a la Moscrip, and then whipped the
ball to Rahn. who, falling away
from the basket about 8 feet out. let

the pelota fly with his left hand, said
pelota quickly looping itself through
the basket. This "impossible" shot
was the one that broke the Jaysee's
morale, and the frosh had little
trouble from then on.
The Papooses went into an early
lead, but were soon passed and were
trailing at half time, 15-20. Modesto's
guards, Norman and Triano, high
lighted the game with their bullet
passes, which had the frosh defense
partially demoralized most of the
game.
Stanford's honor went to Anderson
and Rahn, for beautiful defensive
work under the basket, and to Oak
ford, Lafaille, and Siebert for tricky
passes and dead-eye shooting. High
point men were Siebert for the frosh
with 11, and Morton and Rickert of
the Jaysee with nine apiece.

and Rahn, for beautiful defensive
work under the basket, and to Oak
ford, Lafaille, and Siebert for tricky
passes and dead-eye shooting. High

the Jaysee with nine apiece.
Stanford's frosh cagers won the
hard way Saturday night, coming
from behind to whip the Modesto
Junior Collegians into submission,
39-31, after fighting their way
through what appeared to be, accord
ing to advance publicity, the toughest
game on their schedule.
The Modestos roared full speed
ahead on the tide until about 10
minutes of the second half had ticked
away, when they met a tidal wave
coming the opposite direction in the
form of Bob Oakford. fiery forward,
who, in the opinion of his team
mates, is the best front-line defen
sive man on the squad. Whipping
passes from everyplace on the court
to exactly the right place at the right
time, Oakford fired the team into the
lead.
The whole thing happened, when,
in quick succession, Lafaille took a
look pass from Oakford, barely lift
ing it from the finger tips of a Mo
desto guard, to go in for an easy set
up. tieing the score at 28 apiece.
This was immediately followed by a
short shot by Siebert, who took
Rahn's tip from a jump to put the
yearlings into a two-point lead. On
the heels of this shot came another
long pass from Oakford which La
faille hooked out of the stratosphere
a la Moscrip, and then whipped the
ball to Rahn. who, falling away
from the basket about 8 feet out. let

the pelota fly with his left hand, said
pelota quickly looping itself through
the basket. This "impossible" shot
was the one that broke the Jaysee's
morale, and the frosh had little
trouble from then on.
The Papooses went into an early
lead, but were soon passed and were
trailing at half time, 15-20. Modesto's
guards, Norman and Triano, high
lighted the game with their bullet
passes, which had the frosh defense
partially demoralized most of the
game.
Stanford's honor went to Anderson
and Rahn, for beautiful defensive
work under the basket, and to Oak
ford, Lafaille, and Siebert for tricky
passes and dead-eye shooting. High
point men were Siebert for the frosh
with 11, and Morton and Rickert of
the Jaysee with nine apiece.
