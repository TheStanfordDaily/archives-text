# What They Have To Say

### 
Stanford Associates is the first organized attempt on
the part of the Stanford alumni and friends to bring finan
cial and other support to the University.
It plans to develop the Stanford Fund, to which gifts
can be made for annual support of the University, and
to develop plans for large gifts and bequests.
Stanford Associates is national in scope, which is in
keeping with the present activities of Stanford.
—President Ray Lyman Wilbur
Two and a half years ago a group of alumni concluded
that there had been too little feeling of responsibility
between the University and the alumni, and the one for
the other. Because of this, Stanford Associates was
formed.
We of Stanford Associates are delighted to see that
there is on the part of the trustees. University authorities,
and the Associated Students such a splendid spirit of
welcome and support. It is very heartening that all of
these groups have so responded.
The past two years have been devoted to improving
this sense of responsibility to the Farm' but now we are
ready to go forward with actual financial support.

Fortunately for our University, not only are the Alum
Fortunately for our University not only are the
Alumni giving Stanford Associates every possible bit of
co-operation, but also the undergraduate students are be
ginning to lend their full support, realizing the great
value of this organization to the University.
Few of us truly realize what Stanford can and does
offer us. For example, we pay the University only one
third of the actual cost of our education.
Since the future of our University depends to a con
siderable extent upon the success of Stanford Associates,
let us all do our share to help Stanford maintain its posi
tion among the leading universities of the world.
