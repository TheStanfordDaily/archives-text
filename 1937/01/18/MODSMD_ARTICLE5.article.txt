# ON WASHING CLOTHES or SHALL WOMEN WORK?
## 
### ERNEST HILGARD 
I N OUR civilization Monday is sot
aside as wash day with the sanctity
of tradition which sets Sunday apart
for its appropriate ceremonies. Meth
ods of washing clothes in different
parts of the world today include the
most primitive and those which share
in the technological advances of our
industrial society. In this country the
stones on the banks of the stream
(with adequate rinsing water) are
reserved for camping trips, but I have
seen the iron clothes kettle over an
open fii'e behind many homes in the
Old South. In California the laun
dry-trav is as standard built-in
equipment as the breakfast room. and
j it is usually supplemented with an
electric washer. The home laundry,
even with modern equipment, repre
sents a lagging phase of industrial
evolution, but with over 1,000.000
electric washing machines sold for
home use in this country each year,
it is not an immediately passing
phase. The commercial laundry rep
resents, of course, the possibilities of
modern development, and some of its
merchandising methods, such as dia
per service, are bound to move it
ahead. But this isn't a discussion of
the technical phases of laundering.
1 Wherever you have an industry, you
have workers, and it is laundresses
about whom I wish to make a few
remarks.
' The Widowed Washer-Woman
! There was a time when housewives
went about their duties in the home,
cooking, washing, scrubbing, with
little thought of working for pay. In
fact, it wasn't respectable for a wife

to work, unless something happened
to her husband. Then the only re
spectable thing to do was that for
which she was trained: she could
take in washing. We used to feel
sorry in our home town for the
widowed washer-woman, for she
worked so hard and earned so little.
Why did she earn so little? Because
she was competing with the unpaid
wives. If laundresses got expensive,
wives did their own work. This
competition with unpaid wives makes
household service, one of the most
shameful of our occupations, with
long hours, poor pay, and few privi
leges. Wherever there is a sore of
this kind (i.e., poor labor conditions)
it festers in larger regions of our so
cial organism. Working conditions in
laundries have been notoriously bad,
because shirts must be ironed cheap
ly or wives will iron them at home.
The profession of nursing struggles
to rise above its low wage scale, but
is hampered again, because unpaid
women nurse the sick. The generous
hearted women who go ' slumming"
for charity have in the past all but
wrecked the profession of social
worker. Unpaid wives are serious
competitors of those women who
wish to see woman's economic status
raised to an equality with that of
man. The poorly paid washer-wom
an is but a single representative of a
much larger class suffering from this
competition.
Don't Blame the Wives
To accuse housewives of depress
ing the wage scale of women workers
is to state the matter very baldly, and
the accusation must not be misinter
preted as a reflection on individual
j housewives. Surely the wife who
i wears herself out in household du
ties in order to make her husband's
small salary reach is not a person to
bo blamed Few indeed are the wives
who would not prefer to send their
| clothes to a laundry rather than lean
over the washboard themselves. But
, our social fabric is closely knit, and
! the economic significance of the
i housewife must not bo overlooked
She is not out of circulatiom, as those
1 who advocate firing all married
■ women during a depression seem to
| believe.
Women and jobs
Women undertake training for
economic pursuits with Ihree atti
, tudes: (1) The job is a stop-gap and
; source of pin-money until marriage
(2)The job is a kind of insurance, in
case no husband comes along, or if
I for any reason a marriage fails
(Women will no longer consent to


Dr. Ernest Hilgard
take in washing if their husbands
die.) (3) The job is a legitimate ex
pression of an interest in the work of
the world for which the woman is
suited by capacity, temperament, and
training, and she intends to stick to
it, marriage or no. If women are to
be economically equal to men, it is
just as natural for them to expect
their work to go on after marriage
as for the man to expect his to con
tinue. We have come a long way in
the direction of economic opportuni
ties for women, so that we now ac
cept with little question the job-atti
tudes (1) and (2) above. Opening
our colleges to co-education is in
line with this acceptance of the right
of unmarried women to vocational
training. We still debate about atti
tude (3) above, and we have a long
way to go before marriage for a
woman will be the same incident in
her career that it is for a man.

long hours, poor pay, and few privi
leges. Wherever there is a sore of
this kind (i.e., poor labor conditions)
it festers in larger regions of our so
cial organism. Working conditions in
laundries have been notoriously bad,
because shirts must be ironed cheap
ly or wives will iron them at home.
The profession of nursing struggles
to rise above its low wage scale, but
is hampered again, because unpaid
women nurse the sick. The generous
hearted women who go ' slumming"
for charity have in the past all but
wrecked the profession of social
worker. Unpaid wives are serious
competitors of those women who
wish to see woman's economic status
raised to an equality with that of
man. The poorly paid washer-wom
an is but a single representative of a
much larger class suffering from this
competition.
Don't Blame the Wives
To accuse housewives of depress
ing the wage scale of women workers
is to state the matter very baldly, and
the accusation must not be misinter
preted as a reflection on individual
j housewives. Surely the wife who
i wears herself out in household du
ties in order to make her husband's
small salary reach is not a person to
bo blamed Few indeed are the wives
who would not prefer to send their
| clothes to a laundry rather than lean
over the washboard themselves. But

She is not out of circulatiom, as those

Women and jobs
Women undertake training for
economic pursuits with Ihree atti
, tudes: (1) The job is a stop-gap and
; source of pin-money until marriage
(2)The job is a kind of insurance, in
case no husband comes along, or if
I for any reason a marriage fails
(Women will no longer consent to


Dr. Ernest Hilgard
take in washing if their husbands
die.) (3) The job is a legitimate ex
pression of an interest in the work of
the world for which the woman is
suited by capacity, temperament, and
training, and she intends to stick to
it, marriage or no. If women are to
be economically equal to men, it is
just as natural for them to expect
their work to go on after marriage
as for the man to expect his to con
tinue. We have come a long way in
the direction of economic opportuni
ties for women, so that we now ac
cept with little question the job-atti
tudes (1) and (2) above. Opening
our colleges to co-education is in
line with this acceptance of the right
of unmarried women to vocational
training. We still debate about atti
tude (3) above, and we have a long
way to go before marriage for a
woman will be the same incident in
her career that it is for a man.
I N OUR civilization Monday is sot
aside as wash day with the sanctity
of tradition which sets Sunday apart
for its appropriate ceremonies. Meth
ods of washing clothes in different
parts of the world today include the
most primitive and those which share
in the technological advances of our
industrial society. In this country the
stones on the banks of the stream
(with adequate rinsing water) are
reserved for camping trips, but I have
seen the iron clothes kettle over an
open fii'e behind many homes in the
Old South. In California the laun
dry-trav is as standard built-in
equipment as the breakfast room. and
j it is usually supplemented with an
electric washer. The home laundry,
even with modern equipment, repre
sents a lagging phase of industrial
evolution, but with over 1,000.000
electric washing machines sold for
home use in this country each year,
it is not an immediately passing
phase. The commercial laundry rep
resents, of course, the possibilities of
modern development, and some of its
merchandising methods, such as dia
per service, are bound to move it
ahead. But this isn't a discussion of
the technical phases of laundering.

about whom I wish to make a few
remarks.
' The Widowed Washer-Woman
! There was a time when housewives
went about their duties in the home,
cooking, washing, scrubbing, with
little thought of working for pay. In
fact, it wasn't respectable for a wife

to work, unless something happened
to her husband. Then the only re
spectable thing to do was that for
which she was trained: she could
take in washing. We used to feel
sorry in our home town for the
widowed washer-woman, for she
worked so hard and earned so little.
Why did she earn so little? Because
she was competing with the unpaid
wives. If laundresses got expensive,
wives did their own work. This
competition with unpaid wives makes
household service, one of the most
shameful of our occupations, with
long hours, poor pay, and few privi

it, marriage or no. If women are to
be economically equal to men, it is
just as natural for them to expect
their work to go on after marriage
as for the man to expect his to con

the direction of economic opportuni

her career that it is for a man.
I N OUR civilization Monday is sot
aside as wash day with the sanctity
of tradition which sets Sunday apart
for its appropriate ceremonies. Meth
ods of washing clothes in different
parts of the world today include the
most primitive and those which share
in the technological advances of our
industrial society. In this country the
stones on the banks of the stream
(with adequate rinsing water) are
reserved for camping trips, but I have
seen the iron clothes kettle over an
open fii'e behind many homes in the
Old South. In California the laun
dry-trav is as standard built-in
equipment as the breakfast room. and
j it is usually supplemented with an
electric washer. The home laundry,
even with modern equipment, repre
sents a lagging phase of industrial
evolution, but with over 1,000.000
electric washing machines sold for
home use in this country each year,
it is not an immediately passing
phase. The commercial laundry rep
resents, of course, the possibilities of
modern development, and some of its
merchandising methods, such as dia
per service, are bound to move it
ahead. But this isn't a discussion of
the technical phases of laundering.
1 Wherever you have an industry, you
have workers, and it is laundresses
about whom I wish to make a few
remarks.
' The Widowed Washer-Woman
! There was a time when housewives
went about their duties in the home,
cooking, washing, scrubbing, with
little thought of working for pay. In
fact, it wasn't respectable for a wife

to work, unless something happened
to her husband. Then the only re
spectable thing to do was that for
which she was trained: she could
take in washing. We used to feel
sorry in our home town for the
widowed washer-woman, for she
worked so hard and earned so little.
Why did she earn so little? Because
she was competing with the unpaid
wives. If laundresses got expensive,
wives did their own work. This
competition with unpaid wives makes
household service, one of the most
shameful of our occupations, with
long hours, poor pay, and few privi
leges. Wherever there is a sore of
this kind (i.e., poor labor conditions)
it festers in larger regions of our so
cial organism. Working conditions in
laundries have been notoriously bad,
because shirts must be ironed cheap
ly or wives will iron them at home.
The profession of nursing struggles
to rise above its low wage scale, but
is hampered again, because unpaid
women nurse the sick. The generous
hearted women who go ' slumming"
for charity have in the past all but
wrecked the profession of social
worker. Unpaid wives are serious
competitors of those women who
wish to see woman's economic status
raised to an equality with that of
man. The poorly paid washer-wom
an is but a single representative of a
much larger class suffering from this
competition.
Don't Blame the Wives
To accuse housewives of depress
ing the wage scale of women workers
is to state the matter very baldly, and
the accusation must not be misinter
preted as a reflection on individual
j housewives. Surely the wife who
i wears herself out in household du
ties in order to make her husband's
small salary reach is not a person to
bo blamed Few indeed are the wives
who would not prefer to send their
| clothes to a laundry rather than lean
over the washboard themselves. But
, our social fabric is closely knit, and
! the economic significance of the
i housewife must not bo overlooked
She is not out of circulatiom, as those
1 who advocate firing all married
■ women during a depression seem to
| believe.
Women and jobs
Women undertake training for
economic pursuits with Ihree atti
, tudes: (1) The job is a stop-gap and
; source of pin-money until marriage
(2)The job is a kind of insurance, in
case no husband comes along, or if
I for any reason a marriage fails
(Women will no longer consent to


Dr. Ernest Hilgard
take in washing if their husbands
die.) (3) The job is a legitimate ex
pression of an interest in the work of
the world for which the woman is
suited by capacity, temperament, and
training, and she intends to stick to
it, marriage or no. If women are to
