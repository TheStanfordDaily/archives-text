# LANGE'S NEW ERA
## DIRECTOR 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Yt/ALK into Room 200C any morn
ing, or into the Little Theater any
afternoon, and you'll find the fellow
who since last September has been
directing the dramatic activities of
Stanford.
You probably wouldn't know to
"look at him that he holds such a po
sition. You would likely as not mis
take him for one of his own students,
he appears so young. His name is
Gordon Lange, Colgate, '32.
But once you've gotten over the
surprise of discovering so young a
man heading Stanford dramatics,
you'll realize the reason why.
Colgate Assistant Director
Gordon Lange knows his work*bet
ter than most drama instructors
twice his age. While still an under
graduate at Colgate ho was elevated
to the position of assistant director of
dramatics. Then, to strengthen his
background on the theater, he en
rolled in George Pierce Baker's
famous school of drama at Vale,
where he became an outstanding stu
dent. After that, he returned to
Colgate to graduate in 1932.
Since then, Gordon Lange has
studied the American little theater
movement with an intensive tour of
the principal cities of the land,
worked as assistant director with a
summer stock company in New Eng
land. taught dramatics for two years
at Scripps, college for women near
Los Angeles.
Succecded Dr. Uhler
It was at Scripps where Mr. Lange
caught Stanford's attention. So suc
cessful and so well liked had he been
down there, that when last year's
director, John Uhler, returned to his
native Louisiana State, Gordon
Lange was the logical choice as his
successor.
Right now, Mr. Lange has one eye
on the New Theater and the other on
the old Assembly Hall. That is,
while he is anxious that the new
structure be finished, he isn't wait
ing for it before going ahead, with
characteristic enthusiasm, with his
far-reaching plans.
At presnt, with rehearsals ten,
sometimes twelve times a week,
Gordon Lange is turning all his en
ergy—and he's running over with
that—into "This Side Idolatry,"
which was obtained for Stanford pro
duction. It was done in London by
Leslie Howard, but the presentation
here February 12 will be its Ameri
can premiere.
Planning for the Future
Like most young men of his calibre,
Gordon Lange is also planning for
the futurc--thc future of Stanford's
dramatics and, with Stanford's, his
own. He sees in the building of the
New Theater the chance for the Uni
versity's fame to shoot sky-high, for
Stanford to establish a school of
drama comparable to any in the East.
But such success cannot come
without careful planning and greatly
enlarged activity in the drama and
Director Lange knows it. He has.

even now. drawn up a scheme of his
own which he thinks would do mucin
toward putting Stanford on a par
with Yale and other eastern dramatic
schools.
Proposes Faculty Control
First of all, Mr. Lange would take
the control of Stanford dramatics
from the students (Dramatic Coun
cil) and put a faculty committee in
charge. The members of this com
mittee would function better, thinks
Mr. Lange, if they had spine interest
or background in the theater.
He would arrange to co-ordinate
formal training, class work, with ac
tual practice in acting, directing,
lighting, costuming, and other phases
of production. You can't handle any
part of theater work effectively, he
believes, unless you have an ade
quate working knowledge of all the
related fields.
The new director would foster
playwrighting in his ideal school of
drama. lowa State offers fellowships
to talented writers for study and re
search in its department, and Mr.
Lange is strongly in favor of a simi
lar fellowship system here.
Audicncc to Be Trained
Not only the players but also the
audience must be trained to get full
value from the theater, he says, and
such is an important part of his plan.
Develop a critical and intelligent ap
preciation of the drama of yesterday
and today, he advises, by giving
courses and by encouraging audience
criticism in Stanford plays.
But whatever happens, the adop
tion ol a School of Drama to the
technical advances available in the
New Theater should bo directed
toward the students. Theyvshould be
allowed, with faculty supervision, to,
produce the plays they want not i
less than two major attempts a quar
ter. Tin ?se should be planned a year
in advance, if possible.
The details of degrees, amount of
work in each ph hso of the drnmn, rind
other academic decisions are still
bothering Mr. Lanyo. Hut he is sure
that once the fundamental policies of
a pi, m are worked out, the details will
come along.
School of Drama
In any event, Stanford is in an ex
cellent position to establish a school
of drama which will give students of
the theater what they want. For those
into teaching it will give train

ing and the proper credentials. For
those going into research it will open
the door to new and still unexploited
fields. For those going into writing it
will give a thorough knowledge of
the theater, its bounds and limita
tions.
As yet the professional theater and
the motion pictures X'ecognize no uni
versity degree in acting. But Mr.
Lange believes that although Stan
ford-graduated actors will have to
start on the bottom with the rest,
they will move up through the ranks
more quickly for their Stanford
training.
But with all Gordon Lange's pro
posed plans for the future, don't for
get his canny eye to the present. This
afternoon he will begin another in
tensive week of rehearsals, foi'getting

for a time that there will ever be a
New Theater . . . remembering only
that "This Side Idolatry" must be a
success, in the Assembly Hall.
