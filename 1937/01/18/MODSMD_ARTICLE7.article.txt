# Stanford's Groundfloor Men; Their Life Of Complaints
## 
### 
r |HIE front cover of today's Tabby
is dedicated to Stanford's ground
floor men and to the life they lead.
And according to the pictures the life
they lead is not so bad: clean kitchen,
individual rooms, and recreation
room.
And. according to the janitors, liv
ing conditions of Farm janitors have
improved greatly in the last year or
two.
The food has been better since
cooks were changed. And the old
shacks that used to house the men
were replaced two years ago by a
fine modern 25,000 structure.
The American Building Mainte
nance Corporation, in fact, must have
thought quite a bit of its pecunious
contract with Stanford University.
Because its building constructed on
the campus automatically belongs to
the University. Of course, though,
the A.B.M.C. does not have to pay
rent now.
But, as a matter of fact, the jani
tors are dissatisfied, and have organ
ized a Union, wheih indicates that
they have some viewpoint, some focal
point for which to rally support in
face of A.B.M.C. and University op
posit ion.
John M. Brown is big chief of the
sweep-up crew. Yesterday he was
pityingly tolerant of the new union.
"The men are beginning to see their
mistakes, and they are now starting
to drop out," he said. Brown ex
plained that, while union labor and
collective bargaining are admirable
institutions, "the closed shop just
won't Work on the Stanford campus.''
One complaint that the janitors
have is this: From the !>NO monthly
wage that many of them get. $35 is
extracted to pay for room and board.
Some of the men declare that they
could get room and board in Palo
Alto for much less.
Also, if a man wants to eat in town
he is permitted to. But he gets no re
hale from the $!15 he has paid.
There are no rebates for those who
room elsewhere, either. This makes
it hard on the married man, who
cannot live in the regular janitors'
quarters. He has to pay for two
homes, but he can use only one.
On top of this, some of the married
men claim that Mr. Brown rents to

someone else the room in the jani
tors' quarters that they have paid for.
They say that he rents these rooms
to persons who are working in the
Union or in Encina.
The recent speeding-up of the
work is another sore point. It has
beei) claimed that Brown has ordered
the men to cut 20 minutes off the
time they spend on week days, in or
der to he ahle to do more work on
Sunday. They complain that their
assigned stations already were too
large for the time allowed.
Maybe Enema's beds are not so bad
after all, since one of the men, for
example, has 42 beds to make, 1(5
rooms to dust, a lavatory to clean,
and a long stretch of corridor to mop
â€”;>ll of this in less than four hours.
The janitors are also disgruntled
over what they term "intimidation."
They charge Brown with making a
strong speech to the assembled jani
tors, as soon as he heard about the
new union.
There is no proof of this charge,
though. There w.is a copy made of
the speech, which was turned over to
Assistant Comptroller Erwin. It is
unavailable at present, according to
Mr. Erwin, but he may release it in
the near future.
One of the old grievances seems to
have been eliminated, however.
Janitors used to complain that they
used to go down on Sundays to work
on Brown's 50-foot pleasure yacht
"Nomad," which he berthed at the
Palo Alto yacht harbor. Brown hasn't
maintained his yacht recently, so the
janitors say they don't have their olT
campus functions any more.
Just their Sunday afternoon mop
and broom jolly-ups in the campus
quarters.
