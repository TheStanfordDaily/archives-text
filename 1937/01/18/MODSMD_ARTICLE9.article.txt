# WHAT OF THE OLD DRAMA?
## 
### JOHN EARLE UHLER 
AS I saw the situation last year,
theater at Stanford was largely
i in the state of "college dramatics."
I Students put up the money, chose the
[ plays, controlled purchases, contrib
uted to the director's salary, handled
publicity and saie of tickets. It was
: almost entirely a student-generated
; enterprise. It was an enterprise out
moded in colleges as long as 20 years
ago.
There was much, however, that 1
liked in the set-up. As impressive |
as the new theater building is. it is
the least important of what I liked.
Wonders can be done and have been
done in a barn or warehouse. Far
more important to me was the inter
est. ability, and initiative of the Stan
ford students and the friendly co
operation of the faculty. Take the
dusty, shabby old little theater on
the inner Quad —to say nothing of I
the new Memorial Hall — take stu
dents as 1 found them, an able staff,
a reasonable appropriation, and a
free hand, and you will have an or
ganization that will make Stanford
l inn it,ity inio i>' tlu few great con
| ters of dramatic interest in this
country.
There's the Rub
A free hand! There's the rub. The
i freedom of the director is opposed by
J what is and should be—one of Stan
) ford s proud traditions, student ini
j tiative. Can the two be reconciled
sufficiently to elevate the theater at
Stanford from the sphere of "college
dramatics" into that of dramatic art?
The most serious obstacle is the j
Dramatic Council. Individually 1 j
| found all the members of the Coun
cil likeable and downright helpful.
Several of them developed into my
I best friends on the campus. It was

not in the personnel that 1 found the
Council objectionable; il was in func
tion. Most annoying was its 1 unction
;is the body handling the purse. Good
business training for students, some
people called it, but my answer i
that such training should not bo of
fered at the expense of the Stanford
theater. Couldn't it be more ably un
dertaken by the School of Business
Administ ration?
H.ind of Control 1
The hand on the purse is usually
the hand of control. As a tinancia'
body, the Dramatic Council naturalk
dictated choice of play, expenditure,
and all other administrative details,
Sufh a procedure was inefficient foi
several reasons: first, students are ot
less mature judgment than the mem
bers of the staff; secondly, they lack
the experience necessary for theater
management; thirdly, they afford
only an ephemeral policy. In this
last respect, the Dramatic Council i.-
specially weak. Its membership
changes from year to year, and so
its tastes and purposes change. Such
a group stands in lii • way of a firm
tenacious, long-time policy. Lei
there be a student Dramatic Council,
to be sure, in accord with the Stan
ford tradition of student initiative
but let it serve as a connection be'--
tween student and staff, not as the
seat of control. A money box—ever
a full one—cannot serve as an elec
tric battery.
So much, in this limited space, for
the relation of the drama staff with
the students. What of its relation with
other closely associated staffs of the
University- for example, in the Eng
lish department? As 1 see it. the
work in drama will be crippled if u
part ot it is reserved and independ
ently undertaken by any department
other than the drama stalf, or School
of Dramatic Arts, or whatever it is to
be called.
School of Drama
And what of its relation to the De
partment of Public Speaking? In
most institutions, the work in drama
is embraced by the Department of
Speech. So long as Professor Bassett,
a man of rare academic sanity, is at
Stanford, such an association will
help the theater there. But unfortu
nately for the speech fraternity of
this country —and more specifically
is this unfortunate for Stanford —
Professor Bassett soon retires.
Against that time, if I may express
my view, I recommend that a De
partment or School of Dramatic Arts
be established at Stanford independ
ent of the Department of Speech.
A free hand! Skilled, competent,
gently firm- but, above everything
free of ephemeral student control ane
interdepartmental friction! Without
it, even the new theater will not pro
mote "college dramatics" to the dig
nity of dramatic art.
A non-credit course on the cause
cost, and consequences of war. !ec
by prominent members of the facultv
is now offered to undergraduates o!
Dartmouth College.

A free hand! Skilled, competent,
gently firm- but, above everything
free of ephemeral student control ane
interdepartmental friction! Without
it, even the new theater will not pro

AS I saw the situation last year,
theater at Stanford was largely
i in the state of "college dramatics."
I Students put up the money, chose the
[ plays, controlled purchases, contrib
uted to the director's salary, handled
publicity and saie of tickets. It was
: almost entirely a student-generated
; enterprise. It was an enterprise out
moded in colleges as long as 20 years
ago.
There was much, however, that 1
liked in the set-up. As impressive |
as the new theater building is. it is
the least important of what I liked.
Wonders can be done and have been
done in a barn or warehouse. Far
more important to me was the inter
est. ability, and initiative of the Stan
ford students and the friendly co
operation of the faculty. Take the
dusty, shabby old little theater on
the inner Quad —to say nothing of I
the new Memorial Hall — take stu
dents as 1 found them, an able staff,
a reasonable appropriation, and a
free hand, and you will have an or
ganization that will make Stanford
l inn it,ity inio i>' tlu few great con

There's the Rub
A free hand! There's the rub. The
i freedom of the director is opposed by
J what is and should be—one of Stan
) ford s proud traditions, student ini
j tiative. Can the two be reconciled
sufficiently to elevate the theater at
Stanford from the sphere of "college
dramatics" into that of dramatic art?
The most serious obstacle is the j
Dramatic Council. Individually 1 j
| found all the members of the Coun
cil likeable and downright helpful.
Several of them developed into my
I best friends on the campus. It was

not in the personnel that 1 found the
Council objectionable; il was in func
tion. Most annoying was its 1 unction
;is the body handling the purse. Good
business training for students, some
people called it, but my answer i
that such training should not bo of
fered at the expense of the Stanford
theater. Couldn't it be more ably un
dertaken by the School of Business
Administ ration?
H.ind of Control 1
The hand on the purse is usually
the hand of control. As a tinancia'
body, the Dramatic Council naturalk
dictated choice of play, expenditure,
and all other administrative details,
Sufh a procedure was inefficient foi
several reasons: first, students are ot
less mature judgment than the mem
bers of the staff; secondly, they lack
the experience necessary for theater
management; thirdly, they afford
only an ephemeral policy. In this
last respect, the Dramatic Council i.-
specially weak. Its membership
changes from year to year, and so
its tastes and purposes change. Such
a group stands in lii • way of a firm
tenacious, long-time policy. Lei
there be a student Dramatic Council,
to be sure, in accord with the Stan
ford tradition of student initiative
but let it serve as a connection be'--
tween student and staff, not as the
seat of control. A money box—ever
a full one—cannot serve as an elec
tric battery.
So much, in this limited space, for
the relation of the drama staff with
the students. What of its relation with
other closely associated staffs of the
University- for example, in the Eng
lish department? As 1 see it. the
work in drama will be crippled if u
part ot it is reserved and independ
ently undertaken by any department
other than the drama stalf, or School
of Dramatic Arts, or whatever it is to
be called.

So much, in this limited space, for
the relation of the drama staff with
the students. What of its relation with
other closely associated staffs of the
University- for example, in the Eng
lish department? As 1 see it. the
work in drama will be crippled if u
part ot it is reserved and independ
ently undertaken by any department
other than the drama stalf, or School
of Dramatic Arts, or whatever it is to
be called.
School of Drama
And what of its relation to the De
partment of Public Speaking? In
most institutions, the work in drama
is embraced by the Department of
Speech. So long as Professor Bassett,
a man of rare academic sanity, is at
Stanford, such an association will
help the theater there. But unfortu
nately for the speech fraternity of
this country —and more specifically
is this unfortunate for Stanford —
Professor Bassett soon retires.
Against that time, if I may express
my view, I recommend that a De
partment or School of Dramatic Arts
be established at Stanford independ
ent of the Department of Speech.

AS I saw the situation last year,
theater at Stanford was largely
i in the state of "college dramatics."
I Students put up the money, chose the
[ plays, controlled purchases, contrib
uted to the director's salary, handled
publicity and saie of tickets. It was
: almost entirely a student-generated
; enterprise. It was an enterprise out
moded in colleges as long as 20 years
ago.
There was much, however, that 1
liked in the set-up. As impressive |
as the new theater building is. it is
the least important of what I liked.
Wonders can be done and have been
done in a barn or warehouse. Far
more important to me was the inter
est. ability, and initiative of the Stan
ford students and the friendly co
operation of the faculty. Take the
dusty, shabby old little theater on
the inner Quad —to say nothing of I
the new Memorial Hall — take stu
dents as 1 found them, an able staff,
a reasonable appropriation, and a
free hand, and you will have an or
ganization that will make Stanford
l inn it,ity inio i>' tlu few great con
| ters of dramatic interest in this
country.
There's the Rub
A free hand! There's the rub. The
i freedom of the director is opposed by
J what is and should be—one of Stan
) ford s proud traditions, student ini
j tiative. Can the two be reconciled
sufficiently to elevate the theater at
Stanford from the sphere of "college
dramatics" into that of dramatic art?
The most serious obstacle is the j
Dramatic Council. Individually 1 j
| found all the members of the Coun
cil likeable and downright helpful.
Several of them developed into my
I best friends on the campus. It was

not in the personnel that 1 found the
Council objectionable; il was in func
tion. Most annoying was its 1 unction
;is the body handling the purse. Good
business training for students, some
people called it, but my answer i
that such training should not bo of
fered at the expense of the Stanford
theater. Couldn't it be more ably un
dertaken by the School of Business
Administ ration?
H.ind of Control 1
The hand on the purse is usually
the hand of control. As a tinancia'
body, the Dramatic Council naturalk
dictated choice of play, expenditure,
and all other administrative details,
Sufh a procedure was inefficient foi
several reasons: first, students are ot
less mature judgment than the mem
bers of the staff; secondly, they lack
the experience necessary for theater
management; thirdly, they afford
only an ephemeral policy. In this
last respect, the Dramatic Council i.-
specially weak. Its membership
changes from year to year, and so
its tastes and purposes change. Such
a group stands in lii • way of a firm
tenacious, long-time policy. Lei
there be a student Dramatic Council,
to be sure, in accord with the Stan
ford tradition of student initiative
but let it serve as a connection be'--
tween student and staff, not as the
seat of control. A money box—ever
a full one—cannot serve as an elec
tric battery.
