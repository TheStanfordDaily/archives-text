# Military Ball Queen Race Given Ding; 'In Bad Taste'
## Scabbard, Blade Advised To Drop Plan, Women, Dean Yost Disapprove 
### 
No co-ed honorary colonel will
rule over Scabbard and Blade's mili
tary ball January 29, because com
mittee members were advised that
the university needed no new popu
larity contests after its experience
with the Masque Ball.
Chairman Dick McGowan an
nounced last night that the commit
tee had decided to call off the con
test after consultation with Dean
Mary Yost. According to McGowan,
Miss Yost told the committee that
such a contest would be inconsistent
with the policy laid down by Ex
Committee last spring in abolishing
the Masque Ball queen contest.
"The contest would be in bad
taste," Miss Yost told The Daily last
night.

On the other hand, committee
members could see no relation be
tween their contest and the ill famed
Masque Ball. Tentative rules called
for a senior candidate from each
sorority and women's hall on the
campus. From these, either by a gen
eral election or by vote of men's liv
ing groups, all but three would be
eliminated. The queen would then
be chosen by those buying tickets to
the ball. The ticket stub would be
used as a ballot.
Because no money would be need
ed to vote in the election, committee
members objected to the comparison
between their contest and the
Masque Queen contest.
Woinen's Conference added its ob
jections at its last meeting. "The con
ference generally disapproved," said
Member Frances Strong, "because we
thought it was not a good thing to
publicize the women and we didn't
want to get into any more contests.
And, it would be awfully hard for
the larger halls to decide on one
woman to represent the whole hall."
