# Minimum Wage for Janitors Raised $15 By Comptroller Roth
## Brown Denies Presence Or Influence of Union On Stanford Campus 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
While the campus janitors' union
was last night claiming credit for the
$15 wage increase Foreman John M.
Brown representative of the Ameri
can Building Maintenance Corpora
tion denied that the new union had
anything to do with the raise.
"Besides" said Brown, "there is no
union out here."
Brown would make no formal
statement last night about the rise
fn pay levels. He requested that all
information on the subject be se
cured from Comptroller Roth.
Asked how many men were pre
viously on the lowest wage level,
Brown would make no statement.
"That is my own private business,"
the tycoon explained. "If I released
figures like that, some other con
tractor might be able to underbid
me."
Although the janitors were jubi
lant about the raise, the wages were
not one of their chief complaints.
Most of the dissatisfaction involves
the hiring of students as janitors and
certain features of the way the work
is managed, explained A. E. New
comb, head of the union.
Higher wages have not been de
manded formally by the union.
Wage negotiations come instead from
the San Francisco heads of the union.
Newcomb predicted that this raise
will show the men what a union can
do, thereby strengthening it. Brown,
on the other hand, said that the move
had been planned for some time.
