# Sword, Sandals Plan Reading
## 'Pelleas and Melisande' To Be Presented 
### 
Amelia Baines and Art Spaulding
will read the title roles of Maeter
linck's tragic figures in "Peljleas and
Melisande" tomorrow evening when
Sword and Sandals offers its first
reading play, this quarter, in the Lit
tle Theater at 8 o'clock.
Miss Baines, an experienced actress
in Stanford productions, was assign
ed this role, considered one of the
most exquisite and touching charac
ters of the stage, because she so
capably conveys the mood of the
whole play, a point acutely necessary
in interpreting the poetic Maeter
linck. Spaulding, who is cast as
Pelleas as a wistful complement to
Melisande, was last seen in the 1936
Gaieties.
Nine other parts have been given
to Harold Kahn, Golaud; Edward
Mack, Arkel; Virginia Rogers, Gene
vieve; Janet Dole, Yniold; Harry
Raider, the porter; Anton Badouh, an
old servant; Gene Glasmann and
Frances Farmer ,two maid servants;
and Jack Dawson, a physician.
Brobury Ellis, director of Wednes
day's reading, says the Maeterlinck
play is an exceptionally good choice
by Sword and Sandals because the
musical speech of the characters
takes prominence over dramatic ac
tion. And like music, the words are
suggestive of many moods. But the
Belgian writer has gone even further
than this in utilizing the resources of
other arts to widen the scope of his
dramatic technique.
