# Higher Scale Effective From Jan. 15; A.B.M.C., University Split Cost
## 
### JIM HURST 
Arrangements to raise the mini
mum wage of University janitors
from the present figure of $45 a
month plus room and board to $60 a
month plus room and board were
completed yesterday, according to an
announcement by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
This change, which will be effec
tive as of January 15, will establish
as high a wage scale for the janitors
as the University has ever paid, even
in pre-depression days, Mr. Roth
stated.
Increase Long Planned
Furthermore, janitors not living in
the regular janitors' quarters will
definitely be allowed $8 a month
more for roofn rent, provided that all
rooms in these quarters can be
rented, he declared.
"For some months the University
has been making negotiations with
the American Building Maintenance
Corporation, which company pro
vides our janitor service under con
tract, to work out some increase in
the janitors' wages," Mr. Roth ex
plained. "In fact, we had made pro
vision for such a raise in our bud
get for the year."
$7000 Increase This Year
"The total cost of the new wage
will be $7000 a year, of which the
University will pay half and the
A.B.M.C. the other half," he said.
The total wage increase of $18,000
a year which the union has been ask
ing is entirely out of the question, ac
cording to Mr. Roth. The University
unlike an ordinary business insti
tution, has no profits or surplus from
which labor can demand its "share,"'
he explained.
"In fact, these times of rising prices
are hindering the University rather
than helping it.
"If we were to give any further
wage increase, the money would
have to come directly out of the sal
aries of the professors, who are still
suffering under a 10 per cent wage
cut. And I know the A.B.M.C. is
handling the contract practically at
cost, having investigated it myself.
Possible Break
"If they insist on more money,
we'll have to break with the A. B.
M. C., and then the boys will have
talked themselves out of a job, be
cause our contract provides that we
can't hire the same men for three
months after we quit the A. B. M. C.
"The University has never discrim
inated either for or against unions.
Most of our employees have found
it of no advantage to belong to a
union, since it is always a question
of what the University c&n pay not
what it will pay. We do the best we
cah.
"We will always insist on freedom
in selecting our employees and in
determining the differentials in
wages on a basis of relative responsi
bility and difficulty of the jobs.
"As far as the University is con
cerned, this closes the issue."

Arrangements to raise the mini
mum wage of University janitors
from the present figure of $45 a
month plus room and board to $60 a
month plus room and board were
completed yesterday, according to an
announcement by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
This change, which will be effec
tive as of January 15, will establish
as high a wage scale for the janitors
as the University has ever paid, even
in pre-depression days, Mr. Roth
stated.
Increase Long Planned
Furthermore, janitors not living in
the regular janitors' quarters will
definitely be allowed $8 a month
more for roofn rent, provided that all
rooms in these quarters can be
rented, he declared.
"For some months the University
has been making negotiations with
the American Building Maintenance
Corporation, which company pro
vides our janitor service under con
tract, to work out some increase in
the janitors' wages," Mr. Roth ex
plained. "In fact, we had made pro
vision for such a raise in our bud
get for the year."
$7000 Increase This Year
"The total cost of the new wage
will be $7000 a year, of which the
University will pay half and the
A.B.M.C. the other half," he said.
The total wage increase of $18,000
a year which the union has been ask
ing is entirely out of the question, ac
cording to Mr. Roth. The University
unlike an ordinary business insti
tution, has no profits or surplus from
which labor can demand its "share,"'
he explained.
"In fact, these times of rising prices
are hindering the University rather
than helping it.
"If we were to give any further
wage increase, the money would
have to come directly out of the sal
aries of the professors, who are still
suffering under a 10 per cent wage
cut. And I know the A.B.M.C. is
handling the contract practically at
cost, having investigated it myself.
Possible Break
"If they insist on more money,
we'll have to break with the A. B.
M. C., and then the boys will have
talked themselves out of a job, be
cause our contract provides that we
can't hire the same men for three
months after we quit the A. B. M. C.
"The University has never discrim
inated either for or against unions.
Most of our employees have found
it of no advantage to belong to a
union, since it is always a question
of what the University c&n pay not
what it will pay. We do the best we
cah.
"We will always insist on freedom
in selecting our employees and in
determining the differentials in
wages on a basis of relative responsi
bility and difficulty of the jobs.
"As far as the University is con
cerned, this closes the issue."
