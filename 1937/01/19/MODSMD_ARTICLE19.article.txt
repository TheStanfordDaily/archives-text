FAITH AM) MIRACLES
I seem to have laid another egg in
this column Friday when I remarked
that college journalists kill no sacred
cows because everybody else has
been carving at the animals first and
has made beefsteaks out of them al
ready.
But as for my expedition with gun
and camera to the very foundations
ol religious belief, which Jorgensen
wanted to see, let me say that it was,
as usual, nothing much. What I had
in mind was telling about the inter
esting tangles the absolute disciples
<<! cause and effect get into trying to
account for the supernatural and the
mriaculous in the Gospels. In assum
ing the uniformity of nature, they
naturally conclude that the miracles
which are not occurring in spectacu
lar fashion today could never have
happened then.

The most fantastic explanation
comes from an 18th-century ration
alist by the name of Bahrdt. He said
l hat Jesus belonged to a secret so
ciety called the Essenes, who wished
to morally reform Hebrew society.
Thus they recruited Jesus to pose as
Ihe Messiah in fulfillment of the Old
Testament perdictions. John the
Baptist's public baptism of Jesus was
the official start of the campaign, and
all along the way, the Essenes were
supposed to have acted as fake lepers
and bogus lame men, to become
miraculously healed at the touch of
Jesus. When it came to the crucifix
ion, Bahrdt said that the trial was a
frame-up and that Jesus was given a
pain-resisting drug and taken down
off the cross early to reappear later
and awe the sinful populace with a
supposed resurrection from the dead.
This sort of pure invention has cut
no ice with the 2toh-century ration
alists, and even they point out that
such reasoning is wishful thinking
and substantiates nothing.

The great hook on which the later
rationalization hangs its hat is the
historical discovery that the other
gospels were based on the book of
Mark, which is chronologically first
and supposedly the most accurate. A
scholar by the name of Bauer sug
gested that Mark was presenting a
lictilious. artistic story, that the mir
acles were invented as the needs of
the tale demanded, and even the ac
tual fact of Jesus' existence was a
doubtful quality. But then it has
been pointed out that if Mark's gos
pel was an artistic creation, there is
still the unexplained paradox of why
Jesus claimed Messiahship to his dis
ciples while at the same time requir
ing them to keep this secret among
1 hemselves.

A certain Wrede attempts to an
' wer this by saying that Mark is a
composite of two elements, the ac
tual and the supernatural. The latter,
lie says, is a result of the resurrec
tion the disciples, after seeing Jesus
i ise from the dead, read back into his
early life divine sayings and miracu
lous deeds. But this accepts the
greatest miracle of all.
To this Schweitzer says that Mark
h historically accurate as a whole—
all of it—with the one discemable
thread throughout the whole account
being Jesus' own conviction of his
Messiahship and his modeling his life
