# Film Class Sees Mae West of '14
## 
### 
They had a "Mae West" in 1914
that far outstripped any manhunting
the current version ever attempted.
Her name was Theda Bara and one
of her most successful vehicles, in
which four of her lovers went to the
devil, was "A Fool There Was."
The new Motion Picture class was
exposed to "A Fool There Was" in
its third evening of old films last
night. Theda, the audience learned,
was the first and foremost movie
"vamp." She relied upon open ag
gression rather than upon the subtle
ties employed by her fair haired_
full-figured successor.
Contrasted to Miss Bara on last
night's program was Mary Pickford
in "The New York Hat," filmed in
1912. In it, she and Lionel Barry
more play with a sincerity and natur
alness unequaled in any early film so
far reviewed.
Two other short features, one illus
trating the beginning of Western
pictures and the other the beginning
of slap-stick comedies, were a sur
prise to the class. The surprise: that
in 1917 these two types of films were
so comparable to the same thing
filmed today. The comedy, "The
Clever Dummy" with Ben Turpin,
Chester Conklin, and Wallace Beery,
was really funnier than most such
comedies shown currently.
