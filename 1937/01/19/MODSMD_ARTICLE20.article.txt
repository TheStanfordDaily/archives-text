## Absence from Classes Reason for Dismissal Of Bassi, Don De Rosa 
### 
Don de Rosa and Dick Bassi, Santa
Clara football stars were suspended
from school yesterday, according to
Father John O'Connell, vice-presi
dent of the school. Frequent cutting
of classes was given as the reason
lor their suspension.
Both Bassi and De Rosa finished
their football careers last New Year's
Day in a game against Louisiana
State in New Orleans, in which both
were outstanding stars. The two
were seniors and were to graduate
this June.
â€¢ Constant absences from classes
made them ineligible to take their
final semester examinations, Father
O'Connell reported. Neither is per
mitted to enroll in the institution for
the spring semester, and to finish
college they must return next Sep
tember to make up their deficiencies
and graduate the following June.
Bassi was one of the stand-out
guards of Pacific Coast play last sea
son and received mention on several
all-coast teams, while De Rosa was
a spark-plug of the backfield during
the past three years. Offers to each
are reported to have been made from
several professional teams.
