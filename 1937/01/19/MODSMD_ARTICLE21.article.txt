Better motion pictures is the ob
ject of a "Film Forum" to be he'ld
in Palo Alto community center
Thursday evening under the direc
tion of the Western Writers' Con
gress, locally sponsored by Palo Alto
All-Party Progressives.
The program includes the inde
pendent film treatment of the labor
and unemployment situation en
titled "Millions of Us," the reading of
a paper on "Censorship in the Mov
ies," and a discussion led by Mr.
Harry Carlisle on "The Best and
Worst Movies of 1936."
according to what the later Old
Testament writers expected the Mes
siah to be. Then it is explained that
Jesus keeps his message to the elect
only—those whom the Old Testament
said were to be saved when the
judgment day came. This, though, he
found was not enough, and so he de
cided *o spread his teachings around
and take punishment upon himself
for the sins of the multitude.
One member of the philosophy de
partment, who broaches such delicate
subjects at eight in the morning in
practical solitude, thinks Schweitzer
is on the right track, but the miracles
remain still unexplained. On this
point, though, a disinterested atheist
could point out that an initial faith
in an age of miracles or a belief that
the unexplainably supernatural
could happen anytime would make
all this quibbling and doubting not
a crime of disbelief but rather some
thing like barking at the moon.
