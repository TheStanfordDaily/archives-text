# Come for $1.63 a Day; Stay Away $2
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
It costs about $1.65-plus per day to
go to Stanford, but it costs $2 to stay
away.
Tho price for failure to attend is
$2 apiece for the first two days and
$1 thereafter until the $10 limit is
reached.
The price for failure to do all the
other things for which fines are lev
ied on the campus is from $31 up, de
pending on the violator's ambition
and influence.
In starting on a rule-breaking
binge, Josephine Stanford would be
gin by failing to return to her Almy
Mammy until the end of the week
after registration day. Page 1 of her
reg book then would bill her $100
plus $15 plus $10 for registering late.
Failing to turn in her booklet for a
day dings her $2. Blithely she breaks
an appointment for a medical exam
and pays another ns well as the
same for failure to have been vacci
nated. Another certificate bearing
Jefferson's portrait and Morgenthau's
signature goes over the counter fol
iate registration in physical educa
tion.
Josy is now well settled and begins
doling out the petty cash to her
sorority. It costs her 10 cents per

offense to be late to meals, to omit
to sign lor same, to leave her bed
unmade, her room messy. Two bits
goes for forgetting to sign for phone
calls and for talking out of windows.
A house meeting missed sets her
back a sawbuck, pin money com
pared to the! 1 for being absent from
rushing.
Over at the Union, Jo bounces a
bum check which returns ear
marked $1 fine. Had she pulled this
with "Pay to the Order of Stanford
University," it would have been
twice as much. In any event, Miss
Church keeps careful records of
such financial defections.
Cashing elastic checks with the
bookstore is no longer high crime or
misdemeanor; the ladies in the sup
plies emporium have trusted students
since last June v/hen fines were dis
continued.
About the middle of the quarter,
Josy receives her bill for syllabus
fees which, if not settled within the
time limit, entails another $2 penalty.
Meanwhile, she has, of course, been
withdrawing libe books for way over
the two-week limit, at an ante of five
cents per day overdue. Down in the
reserve book room a system is in
force which bills the party keeping a
book beyond the two-hour time two

bits per hour, and in the case of much
demanded tomes, 25 cents per ten
minutes.
Of course, all these moneys are not
budgeted for by the university, and
statistics are at present unavailable
as to the sums received from delin
quencies of all sorts. However, the
various $2 bills come in quite handy.
At the libe, they help pay for
penny postals and paste and other
props. Elsewhere, their employment
is comparable.
Before depression destroyed the
"rich man's college" myth surround,
ing Stanford, fines of all sorts were
at least double the present figures.
The fact that, halved during the
crisis, they are still at the new low
may be used either to draw an eco
nomic generalization or a conclusion
as to university business policy.
Meanwhile, the most prolific source
of revenue, going by number of vic
tims, probably is the system preva
lent at many fraternities where .sums
ranging from .10 cents up are levied
for unseembly language or behavior
at table. In at least one tong, (his
tax is applied to the purchase of
phonograph records.
