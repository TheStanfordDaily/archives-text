# Ex Committee To Mull Over Cost of Nitery
## Spring Elections, Sport Proposals, Youth Act Up for Consideration 
### 
Ex Committee will sit down to
its second meeting of the quarter
tonight with four major questions
before it.
First in importance is the nitery.
President Jim Reynolds last week
promised the Committee that he
would get an estimate of the cost of
remodeling the A.S.S.U. floor of tht-
Old Union into a combination nitery
and informal meeting place for clubs
and study groups.
Barbara Kimball, Women's Con
ference president who has reftirned
from the East since the last meeting,
will again introduce her plan to
change main student-body elections
from May to February with a corre
sponding shift in A.S.S.U. adminis
trations.
The California Youth Act, which
Jackie Brown last week asked Ex
Committee to approve, will again be
discussed. Members last Tuesday
asked for a week to learn more about
the act before passing upon it ofli
cially.
Last important measure before the
legislative body is Roy Thompson's
request to make wrestling a minor
sport. While Ex Committee only has
power to recommend the action to
the 8.A.C., Reynolds will bring ad
vice from General Manager A 1 Mas
ters as to what can logically be done.
