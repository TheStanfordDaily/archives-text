# Records Show Cal Basketball Jinx a Myth
## Bunn's Wins at Berkeley Nearly Equal Those In Stanford Pavilion 
### WALT PETERSON 
For .some unknown reason most
people around the bay region have
I ho idea that Stanlord can't win over
California in basketball on Califor
nia's home court.
It's a jinx, they say, that Nibs
I'rice has over the Bunn-coached
outfits as long as he's in his own
bailiwick.
However, a perusal of the records
will .show that John Bunn, since he
came to Stanford and took over the
first Farm hoop team in 1931, has
won almost as many 'games on the
California floor as he has in the
Stanlord Pavilion.
His very first Cal game was at
' alifornia, and that he won in what
was termed an upset. He won an
other in the Cal gym in 1934, while
be has won just, three in the Stan
lord Pavilion one in 1935 and two
la.st year.
Bunn Not Worried
As a result ol all this, the smiling
net nestor from the corn belt is not
pointing toward Friday's game with
Cal, the series-opener, any more
than he did in preparation for the
two U.C.L.A. games over the week
end.

Not considering the Bears as the
team Stanford must beat for the title,
but lather Elevator Sam Barry's
boys fiuiii Coach Bunn figures
thiit ii the Card team points for any
one game it will be during the U.S.C.
series.
The Trojans have already demon
strated their superiority over Cali
iornia with their double win in the
south Friday and Saturday nights,
and a.s such have established them
selves as the strongest contender
Stanford will have to meet in the
race for the coast flag.
While on the subject of jinxes,
which after all merely result because
some school consistently puts out a
better basketball team than some j
other, it might be mentioned that j
since Sam Barry came to U.S.C. in
J93U. California has not been able to
win a single series from the Los An
gelenos.
Ever since the 'moanin' master took
over the reins of the Wooden Horse J
he has put out a conference title or :
winner contender, losing only in
1931 to California and in 193(5 to
Stanford. At that, the loss of the
title to the Bears in 1931 was on a
playoff after the season, when Stan- >
ford set up the tie with an upset of
the Trojans.

the Man in the Moon. It's just an- !
other game on the road to the chain- !
pionship, and holds a spot of im- j
portance neither greater nor lesser
than the pair of Bruin tilts just won. I

He worked out lightly last night,

For .some unknown reason most
people around the bay region have
I ho idea that Stanlord can't win over
California in basketball on Califor
nia's home court.
It's a jinx, they say, that Nibs
I'rice has over the Bunn-coached
outfits as long as he's in his own
bailiwick.
However, a perusal of the records
will .show that John Bunn, since he
came to Stanford and took over the
first Farm hoop team in 1931, has
won almost as many 'games on the
California floor as he has in the
Stanlord Pavilion.
His very first Cal game was at
' alifornia, and that he won in what
was termed an upset. He won an
other in the Cal gym in 1934, while
be has won just, three in the Stan
lord Pavilion one in 1935 and two
la.st year.

net nestor from the corn belt is not
