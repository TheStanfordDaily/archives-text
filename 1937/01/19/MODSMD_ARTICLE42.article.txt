HOW ABOUT THESE
BASKETBALL RULES, PEOPLE?
From reading the Los Angeles pa
| pers, v/here they either know or aet
I like they know more about basket
i ball than do the Bay Area writers, I
j gather an item that seems to merit a
bit of thought: How come basketball,
of all the prominent sports out here
in the West, is so much more a tussle
with the rules than any other?
Grant that all sports have to have
rules, and long, detailed, well de
fined ones, but some of them are
much less in evidence and are not
so harshly and unpleasantly forced to
the attention of spectators and play
ers.
In track, in rugby, and in others
there are plenty of rules, about size
of discus circle and cutting in, and
about off-side and converting a try,
but the several sports seem to range
down through football and end up
in basketball.
In most cage games when the go
ing really gets good—the players do
their best floorwork and the specta
tors get the most boot out. of it—dur
ing a fast passing rush the thing has
to be brought to a stop by a whistle,
some booing, and some free shots.
Now don't go and holler that its a
goofy idea and that 1 like only a
rough and tumble affair with Herwig,
Barking Joe Kelly, and Dinty Moore
all clawing each other's eyes out.
And the danger of physical harm is
n't an argument either, as the great
est foot races, and greatest prize
fights are usually the one most in

! jurious to health.
I like a good fast hoop game, with
that old ball passing around and
1 through the net so fast you can't
follow it, just as much as anybody
does, but it seems to me that half the
j fun of watching a game, and three
quarters of the fun of playing the
! are removed when Bailly and
Leith and DeGroot and the rest be
; gin to pound those whistles. And yet
j they're Only following the rule book.
Why is it that the great possibilities
of this great game are'considerably
hampered by its own rules?
