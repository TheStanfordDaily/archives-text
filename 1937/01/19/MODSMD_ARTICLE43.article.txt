# Baseball Squad Plays Navy '9' Wednesday
## 
### 
Weather permitting, the varsity
baseball team will play the Nine
teenth Airship Squadron from Mof
fett Field . here tomorrow after
noon at 3:30 o'clock. To date one
game with Moffett Field and another
with San Jose State have been can
celled because of rain and wet
grounds.
Coach Harry Wolter has not had
much opportunity to get a line on
the players this quarter, but he plans
to start the following nine against
the navy team: catcher, Leo Heager
ty: pitcher. "Spike" Furman; first
baseman, Darrell Holman; second
baseman, Leonard Linde; shortstop,
George Farrell; third basemen, Dick
Tam; and outfielders Frank BarsOc
chini, Bob Matthews, and Richard La
Franchi. _Of these, five were regulars
last season.
Linde played with San Mateo J.C.
last year: Tam is a transfer from the
University of Hawaii; Barsocchini
wouldn't let him see the second . . .
There was a short score controversy
when Professor Grant on the official
books said 03.the scoreboard said 02.
the east side press box said 01, and
the west side press box said 64 . . .
Coach John Bunn chews two pieces
of gum during a game instead of the
customary one . . .
That trick of Luisetti's, "Here,
I Howie, let me throw it in," on the
out under the backboard was a hot
one; the boys worked it last year
and several times on the eastern trip.
Wait till someone tries it on them
. . . When Luecke got down on his
hands and knees in front of Hank in
the first game a lot of you howled,
but there isn't any rule to stop him
from falling there . . .
Warren Breed, last spring's Side
liner fresh home from the East, says
Turner and Luisetti have been picked
on an all-time Madison Square
Garden team . . . The new fancy
j green shirts of the officials didn't
work out so well, with Slaughter of
the Bruins passing to Referee Leith,
thinking he was a team-mate.
LOOK. MATES:
IT'S THIS WEEK!
And now what about California?
Think about that victory in the Ber
keley 800 Pavilion! One of our
chances this year to shove the axe
down their throats! We need you
over there. Got your ticket yet?

The California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association comprising
teams from Stanford, California,
U.S.C., U.C.L.A., Santa Clara, and
St. Mary's is scheduled to get under
way here on the thirteenth of next
month with a game between the
Bronco nine and the local team. Ev
ery school will play three games with
each of its opponents, making 15 j
game schedules.
Weather permitting, the varsity
baseball team will play the Nine
teenth Airship Squadron from Mof
fett Field . here tomorrow after
noon at 3:30 o'clock. To date one
game with Moffett Field and another
with San Jose State have been can
celled because of rain and wet
grounds.
Coach Harry Wolter has not had
much opportunity to get a line on
the players this quarter, but he plans
to start the following nine against
the navy team: catcher, Leo Heager
ty: pitcher. "Spike" Furman; first
baseman, Darrell Holman; second
baseman, Leonard Linde; shortstop,
George Farrell; third basemen, Dick
Tam; and outfielders Frank BarsOc
chini, Bob Matthews, and Richard La
Franchi. _Of these, five were regulars
last season.
Linde played with San Mateo J.C.
last year: Tam is a transfer from the
University of Hawaii; Barsocchini
wouldn't let him see the second . . .
There was a short score controversy
when Professor Grant on the official
books said 03.the scoreboard said 02.
the east side press box said 01, and
the west side press box said 64 . . .
Coach John Bunn chews two pieces
of gum during a game instead of the
customary one . . .
That trick of Luisetti's, "Here,
I Howie, let me throw it in," on the
out under the backboard was a hot
one; the boys worked it last year
and several times on the eastern trip.
Wait till someone tries it on them
. . . When Luecke got down on his
hands and knees in front of Hank in
the first game a lot of you howled,
but there isn't any rule to stop him
from falling there . . .
Warren Breed, last spring's Side
liner fresh home from the East, says
Turner and Luisetti have been picked
on an all-time Madison Square
Garden team . . . The new fancy
j green shirts of the officials didn't
work out so well, with Slaughter of
the Bruins passing to Referee Leith,
thinking he was a team-mate.
LOOK. MATES:
IT'S THIS WEEK!
And now what about California?
Think about that victory in the Ber
keley 800 Pavilion! One of our
chances this year to shove the axe
down their throats! We need you
over there. Got your ticket yet?
