## 
### 
Jack Read, aquatic flash from
Lowell High in San Francisco,
emerged in the lead at the end of the
first week of the frosh swim tryouts
\ being conducted in Encina Pools by
Headman Nort Thornton.
Read copped first place in the 50-
yard free-style with the good early
season time of 27 seconds flat. He
won the 100 in 1:01.4, and placed
third in the 220-yard free-style in
2:44, to accumulate 12 points to lead
the field.
Bob Plate from Burlingame Hi is
in second place with 9 points, having
placed second in all three events last
week. Close behind in third place is
Bill Bleecker with a win in the 220
in 2:39.3, a third in the 100. and a
fourth in the 50. Frank Dowling and
Bob Livingston have each scored two
points to complete the list of scoring
first-year paddlers.
Coach Thornton is beaming over j
those days about his "greatest in J
history" varsity swim team, but the
optimistic mentor nearly breaks into
tears as he expounds on the weakness
of this year's frosh paddling aggrega
tion—a good backstroker, good
breaststroker, and one or two good
sprinters, but that is whe»e every
thing stops.
