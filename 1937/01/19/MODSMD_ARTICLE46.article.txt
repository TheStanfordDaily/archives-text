Coming as a complete surprise is the raising
of A.B.M. Co's janitors' salaries by one-third,
and the granting of the rebate to those janitors
who do not use the rooms in the campus quar
ters.
According to Comptroller Almon E. Roth the
raise in wages had only a coincidental time
relation with the formation of the Janitors'
Union. According to officials of the Janitors'
Union, the raise in wages does not meet all
the grievances of the janitors, who apparently
had other things in mind besides money. So
the effect of this upon the future life of the
Union remains to be seen.
Administration officials scoff at the Union
and say that it has no function, no power, and
gradually will wither away. Time will tell.
