When $50,000 was willed outright to the Uni
versity by John M. Switzer, class of '98, it car
ried with it the expectancy of a legacy amount- j
ing to from $200,000 to $300,000.
But more than that, it meant that the extensive
campaign sponsored by the Stanford Associates
to raise the endowment of the University had
been given added impetus. Switzer in the past
years has contributed many anonymous gifts.
The present one, made "in gratitude for the edu
cation I received," is to be used for student
loan funds and research scholarships.
When final settlement of the estate is made
and other bequests are paid, Stanford will re
ceive her remaining share of the several hun
dred thousand dollar bluest — the second
largest and possibly the largest gift made to
the University since the original grant. The
Henry Newell fund which provides many of the
present scholarships now holds top place
among the previous gifts.
It is the far-distant goal of University officials
and alumni that through such endowments as
this, the University will be able to place itself
on the high plateau along with the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology—the plateau
where there are scholarships for all who need
them without resorting to loan funds.
