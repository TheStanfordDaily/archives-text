# Disloyal to U.S. Aims
## 
### 
The Stanford unit of the American Student
Union has announced plans to raise funds for
the relief of the loyalist government forces in
Spain, and it is to be hoped that the Stanford
unit and all other units which enlist in that en
terprise will find response lacking.
Those students and other people too have a
light to their personal, factional sympathies in
the Spanish civil war, but they should bear in
mind that their obligation to their own gov
ernment should be greater than their loyalty to
one or the other of the conflicting Spanish fac
tions. Our own government's big concern in
regard to Spain is not to get ourselves em
broiled in that war. To that end some unusual
neutrality measures have been adopted at
Washington. Embargoes have been authorized
on the shipment of arms and ammunition to
either side, inasmuch as it is recognized that
continuance of trade with either faction in
supplying the sinews of war would be a step
upon which we might be climbing into a mili
tary participation later on.
But are not relief funds to either side in the j
Spanish hostilities actually "sinews of war" !
themselves quite as much as guns and ammu- j
nition?
Whoever contributes a penny to the Spanish
loyalist relief fund or to any fund that may be
sought for the help of the insurgent forces will
be weakening to that extent the strength of our
own country's neautrality precautions. — Palo !
