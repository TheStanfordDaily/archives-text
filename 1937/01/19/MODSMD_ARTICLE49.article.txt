# False Alarms

"President Roosevelt is a false alarm, a moun
tebank, a hypocrite," editorialized "Pop" Smith,
Mountain View Weekly Ledger editor. But
President Roosevelt was not being libeled by
such statements, ruled the Justice Court of San
Jose last week.
The charge of criminal libel was filed by a
British-born Mountain View railroad employee
and president of the newly formed Mountain
View Patriotic League. But the Justice Court
could see no innuendo in the allegations which
might be regarded as libelous.
On a somewhat ethereal basis, Smith's law
yers successfully likened the grizzled and ink
stained editor to Chiist, but even such a sacri
lege as this did no more than make the court

blink a little and did not deter its opinion that
Roosevelt was not libeled by the aged seer.
The court held that in essence, Adams' edi
torial did no more than accuse Roosevelt of
being "a person who mounts a platform to sell
his wares" and "who pretended to be something
that he is not"—and more than that, it would not
tamper with the age-old American tradition —
Freedom of the Press. Adams was no financial
power nor was he a Beaverbrook, but the court
still recognized that a man has the right to
express strong opinions in his columns.
That all politicians try to sell their "wares"
and in doing so pretend to be something they
are not is not a fact that can be disputed. And
so a lowly San Jose Justice Court has ruled
that the crystallization of such opinions into a
few blunt words does not constitute grounds for
libel.
