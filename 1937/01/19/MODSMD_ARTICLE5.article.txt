### 
Speaking over the NBC Pacific
Coast Blue Network, Dr. Henry Lanz,
associate professor of Slavic lan
guages at Stanford, will pay tribute
to the memory of Alexander Push
kin, Russia's greatest poet. Dr. Lanz
will speak on Monday, January 25,
at 8:30 p.m. on "Pushkin from, an In
ternational Point of View."
Commenting on his radio talk, Dr.
Lanz said, "Pushkin, like his native
Russia, is distinguished by his tre
mendous complexity. He is a prod
uct of cultural and racial breeding.
The racial composition of his poetic
temperament, and therefore of his
poetry, is indeed unique."
