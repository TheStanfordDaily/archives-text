PIERRE, YOU'LL HAVE TO SWING IT
There was a street walker in the Opera House Sat
urday night. And she was some gal.
She arrived with a guy fronh New York named
George Gershwin, which, according to the newspapers,
gave her rhythm and plenty of those good old sharps
and flats, but not much respectability.
* * * *
And did she fool 'em. From the grey neck-bands in
the gallery to the chalked shirt-fronts in the boxes,
they mll called Tin Pan Tessie a lady
And what a lady! She swung her musical hips,
and made the audience like it. She rolled her eyes and
brought down the house. And if she was too heavily
l'ouged, we didn't notice it.
Her name was Jazz, and while she said "dese" and
"dose," we don't know but what her pronunciation
was correct.
* * * *
Under the chaparonage of that amazing young man
from Gotham, harsh-voiced Tessie became a fitting
companion for the aristocratic Mendelssohn.
Indeed, Mendelssohn would have been honored. He
might even have said, "Hiya, kid," without insulting
music, the gal, or his own reputation.
# »1* *
It was more a concert than many of the bills filled
with Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, whom most of the
audience know only from programme notes.
For it indicated that music is just as elevating when
you enjoy it, per se, as when you are getting a plush
bottom full of culture.
The occasion was precious. And it ma'y make the
standard pretensions against Goodman and the Dorseys
a little less sure, and your enjoyment of "hot music" a
little more closely identified with your "better" artistic
selves.
The music was frank. And Gershwin was frank. He
played the piano, he didn't wave his hands and per
spire over the first violins. And when ho conducted,
he conducted using a good loud "shush" for "pianissi
mo," instead of crooking the little finger just in front of
his nose, which might also mean he wanted to rub his
eyes.
Gershwin and the gal from Gotham de-garbagified
music in two short hours, and many a garbage collec
tor left the place with the sheriff's notice on his artistic
beliefs.

There was a street walker in the Opera House Sat
urday night. And she was some gal.
She arrived with a guy fronh New York named
George Gershwin, which, according to the newspapers,
gave her rhythm and plenty of those good old sharps
and flats, but not much respectability.

And did she fool 'em. From the grey neck-bands in
the gallery to the chalked shirt-fronts in the boxes,
they mll called Tin Pan Tessie a lady
And what a lady! She swung her musical hips,
and made the audience like it. She rolled her eyes and
brought down the house. And if she was too heavily
l'ouged, we didn't notice it.
Her name was Jazz, and while she said "dese" and
"dose," we don't know but what her pronunciation
was correct.

Under the chaparonage of that amazing young man
from Gotham, harsh-voiced Tessie became a fitting
companion for the aristocratic Mendelssohn.
Indeed, Mendelssohn would have been honored. He
might even have said, "Hiya, kid," without insulting
music, the gal, or his own reputation.

It was more a concert than many of the bills filled
with Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, whom most of the
audience know only from programme notes.
For it indicated that music is just as elevating when
you enjoy it, per se, as when you are getting a plush
bottom full of culture.
The occasion was precious. And it ma'y make the
standard pretensions against Goodman and the Dorseys
a little less sure, and your enjoyment of "hot music" a
little more closely identified with your "better" artistic
selves.
The music was frank. And Gershwin was frank. He
played the piano, he didn't wave his hands and per
spire over the first violins. And when ho conducted,
he conducted using a good loud "shush" for "pianissi
mo," instead of crooking the little finger just in front of
his nose, which might also mean he wanted to rub his
eyes.
Gershwin and the gal from Gotham de-garbagified
music in two short hours, and many a garbage collec
tor left the place with the sheriff's notice on his artistic
beliefs.
