A Daily photographer walked into the Chinese Club
last week, thinking it was the Theta Xi house. When
he got inside he became suddenly confused and asked
the Club members: "Is this the Theta Xi house?"
Their reply was, "No."
The housemother at the Men's Rest Home discov
ered recently to her sorrow that her Japanese houseboy
had terminated his stay at the Rest Home. So she called
up the wife of Comptroller Almon Roth and asked her
if she could get her Japanese houseboy to find a sub
stitute. This was promised.
A few days later the voice of a Japanese came over
the phone: "Yo waant Jap'nese howsbye?"
"Yes."
"Wan you waant him?"
"Right away."
'Wot day yo waant howsbye come?"
"Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday."
"No can come than."
"How about Thursday and Friday?"
"Ah right. Wot kine wuk howsbye do?"
"Gardening and dishwashing."
"No waant gardneeng, deeshwasheeng. I do other
wuk though."
All of a sudden there was a hearty, gusty laugh over
the phone. The Jap nese howsbye was Comptroller
Roth.
Though the past rushing period demonstrated quite
conclusively that every house always gets itself a good
class, there was little else demonstrated, except maybe
a new form of illegal rushing.
It seems one of our old. established houses wanted
for its pledge class a certain legacy. Since he just
registered winter quarter, they didn't get around to
working on him. It was not until the day of silence
that 4hey decided to pledge, and the day of silence be
ing a day of silence, they didn't rightly know what to do.
So they telegraphed to the father of the legacy, ask
ing him to pledge the son. The father wired the son.
The son wired the father. The house then wired (In
legacy; "Congi alulat ions."
