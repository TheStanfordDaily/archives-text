GONE WITH THE WIND—
Margaret Mitchell's 1039-pager has
gone over the million mark, which
makes it the most successful first
novel since Cervantes' "Don Quixo
te." But Cervantes didn't collect 50
cents a copy royalty on his master
piece . . . Margaret Mitchell is sure
of $500,000 excluding picture rights,
radio rights, newspaper syndicate
rights, etc. . . . Also gone with the
wind are "The Music Goes 'Round
and 'Round," "Red Sails in the Sun
set," and "Alone," songs that
ranked one, two, three for the year
1936.
ANOTHER COMEDY PROGRAM—
With its own distinctive brand of
humor, the California State Legisla
ture goes on the air today, Wednes
day, Thursday, and Saturday, from
2:45 to 3 p.m., on KSFO . . . Eddie
Cantor is guest star of A 1 Jolson's
"Cafe Trocadero" tonight at 8:30 on
KSFO. Another comedian, Sid Sil
vers, will also be on hand. And
Swinger Martha Ray is scheduled to
get off a few gags, too ... It sounds
like an all caviar dinner—the palate
won't be able to stand so much wit
even if it's good . . . KGO presents
Ben Bernie and Anna Sten at 6 p.m.
Miss Sten is the movie actress who
received nearly a million dollars
worth of publicity as Samuel Gold
wyn's greatest find. After making
several expensive pictures, she sud
denly began to believe her publicity.
But her box office wasn't as big as
her head and now she's on the out
side looking in . . . She's the "hor
j rible example" that 20th Century
i Fox is pointing to when Simone Si
mon (pronounced "nuts") gets ex
j aggerated opinions of her own value
| . . . On KPO, Fred Astaire intro-
I duces Johnny Green's latest tune,
| "The Night Is Beginning." Fortu
nately, Francis White will sing the
! lyrics, for after hearing the Astaire
vocal efforts on the radio, people will
continue to praise his dancing . . .
The title sounds too much like "The
Night Is Young," song hit of the
moment, which in turn sounds
something like "The Night Is Young,"
a melody of Sigmund Romberg's
from the two-year-old movie by the
same name.
ON THE WAY—
The new Astaire-Rogers picture,
I "Stepping Toes," is on the fire. The
j music s by George and Ira Gersh
i win . . . And Jerome Kern is writ
ing songs for Irene Dunne's new film,
j "High, Wide, and Handsome" . . .
! While Irving Berlin is batting out
melodies for Dick Powell's coming
flicker, "On the Avenue" ... So
there'll be new tunes on the airwaves
in case you doubted it.

| . . . On KPO, Fred Astaire intro-
I duces Johnny Green's latest tune,
| "The Night Is Beginning." Fortu
nately, Francis White will sing the

vocal efforts on the radio, people will
continue to praise his dancing . . .
The title sounds too much like "The
Night Is Young," song hit of the
moment, which in turn sounds
something like "The Night Is Young,"
a melody of Sigmund Romberg's
from the two-year-old movie by the
same name.
ON THE WAY—
The new Astaire-Rogers picture,
I "Stepping Toes," is on the fire. The
j music s by George and Ira Gersh
i win . . . And Jerome Kern is writ
ing songs for Irene Dunne's new film,
j "High, Wide, and Handsome" . . .
! While Irving Berlin is batting out
melodies for Dick Powell's coming
flicker, "On the Avenue" ... So
there'll be new tunes on the airwaves
in case you doubted it.

GONE WITH THE WIND—
Margaret Mitchell's 1039-pager has
gone over the million mark, which
makes it the most successful first
novel since Cervantes' "Don Quixo
te." But Cervantes didn't collect 50
cents a copy royalty on his master
piece . . . Margaret Mitchell is sure
of $500,000 excluding picture rights,
radio rights, newspaper syndicate
rights, etc. . . . Also gone with the
wind are "The Music Goes 'Round
and 'Round," "Red Sails in the Sun
set," and "Alone," songs that
ranked one, two, three for the year
1936.
ANOTHER COMEDY PROGRAM—
With its own distinctive brand of
humor, the California State Legisla
ture goes on the air today, Wednes
day, Thursday, and Saturday, from
2:45 to 3 p.m., on KSFO . . . Eddie
Cantor is guest star of A 1 Jolson's
"Cafe Trocadero" tonight at 8:30 on
KSFO. Another comedian, Sid Sil
vers, will also be on hand. And
Swinger Martha Ray is scheduled to
get off a few gags, too ... It sounds
like an all caviar dinner—the palate
won't be able to stand so much wit
even if it's good . . . KGO presents
Ben Bernie and Anna Sten at 6 p.m.
Miss Sten is the movie actress who
received nearly a million dollars
worth of publicity as Samuel Gold
wyn's greatest find. After making
several expensive pictures, she sud
denly began to believe her publicity.
But her box office wasn't as big as
her head and now she's on the out
side looking in . . . She's the "hor
