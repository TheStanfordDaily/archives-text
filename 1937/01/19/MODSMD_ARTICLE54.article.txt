SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY, 11.
To audiences too accustomed to the
music of Bach, Beethoven, and the
rest of the long dead greats, the ap
pearance of the very alive George
Gershwin with the San Francisco
| Symphony Orchestra this week-end
| was a stimulating and appreciated
| one.
If there were any doubts about the
j validity of Gershwin the composer,
I these were well disproven. Rhapsody
! in Blue, the jazz classic on which
j Gershwin's fame seems to rest for
i many, I thought inferior to the other
j compositions.
j "The Concerto for Piano and Or
i chestra" is remarkable in its startling
' injection of new elements into the
traditional classic mold of the con
certo. Included in the three move
ments are well stated themes, reiter
ations, and cadenzas, but strong
rhythms and frequent discord sug
gest an entirely different idiom. And, |
in fact, most of Gershwin's music is
based on jazz which he claims is le
gitimate American folk music. An I
unsnobbish, refreshing approach, in
deed!
The significant fact is that Gersh
win is selective. He borrows from
jazz its polyrhythms, its new harmo
! nies but discards its mockish pattern
j regularity.
The Porgy and Bess suite, which
| the composer himself conducted, in
j eluded songs we are all familiar with
—"I Got Plenty o' Nothin'," "Bess,
j You Is My Woman Now," and
I "Oh Lord, I'm on My Way." The
| furious "Hurricane Movement" was
j a splendid thing. In Porgy and Bess,
I Gershwin has drawn from the less
j mercurial, more minor music of the
| American negro.
Compared with Schonberg, Car
j penter, and the "atonalists," Stra- I

vinsky and his "neo-classicism":
third phase, Gershwin is a hide
bound conservative. But he is work
ing in the present, with present-day
materials, and we can congraulate
Conductor Monteux and his orches
tra for their sympathetic interpre
tation.
As for the remainder of the pro
gram — Mendelssohn's melodious
Symphony Number 4 in A major and
the Overture to "Die Meistersinger"
were done with a smoothness and
finesse that the opening concert all
too visibly lacked. —Warson
