# Decline of Monarchies Predicted by Hulme
## Eight Ex-rulers Living; Titles Meaningless 
### H. V. ALWARD, JR 
Eight ex-rulers of modern Euro
pean and Asiatic countries are yet
living and enjoying life in various
parts of Europe. The Czar of Rus
sia and the Emperor of Austria, both
dead, were powerful rulers. Are
these indications that hereditary rule
on the continent is at an end?
According to Dr. A. E. Hulme,
Professor of History at Stanford,
monarchy, in the case of Great
Britain, may lose what little power
it has left and slowly drop even the
prestige that it now holds. As an
evidence of that, the king restricts
his activities to the opening of court
houses, churches, &nd institutions,
and to the reading of a Speech that
the prime' minister has written at
the opening of parliament.
Why Edward Abdicated
Dr. Hulme gave two main reasons
for the abdication of Edward last
year, saying: "I think he realized
the great need of legislation to help
the mass of the working people; and
he also realized the impotence of a
king of his country to do anything
that amounts to anything in that
matter.
"Then, too, I believe that he is a
man to whom very few women ap
peal strongly in such a way as to
make him desire to live with them.
At last in Wally, he found such a
person. And when the archbishop
and the prime minister and other
titled nonentities objected to his
marriage with her and forced upon
him the alternative of the throne or
Wally, he chose the latter." /
Czar Backs Wrong Horse
The case of Czar Ferdinnad I of
Bulgaria is somewhat different, ac
cording to Dr. Hulme. "The Old
Fox" was a nickname applied to him
for his craftiness in politics and bus
iness. When the allies broke the
Saloniki front, the ruler fled to the
Austria nlines, abdicated in favor
of his youngest son, Boris, now rul
ing there. He now is spending his
time at Coburg in Thuringia, Ger
many.
Dr. Hulme describes Ferdinand as
"cultured, a man who frequented
many royal courts in Europe and
spent much time at such widely
known resorts as the Riviera and
i Biarritz. He had a wide acquaint
ance among royal, artistic, and
wealthy circles. He was esteemed as
a good companion. But in the war,
he put his money on the wrong
horse."
William's Inflated E^o
William 11, Emperor of Germany,
I is now living as an exile from his
| country in Doom, Holland. In the
i words of Dr. Hulme, "he suffered
; from an enormously inflated ego.
j Soon afte rhe succeeded to the
I throne, he dropped the ruthless but
| wise Bismarck and undertook to
| guide the German Empire himself.
] He made a mess of the job. He is
j now an exile too."
The Kaiser has left Germany.
, Rule there is now out of the hands
of any hereditary powers. The gov
ernment now in power rode in on a
wav eof popularity. This monarchy
has come to a complete end.
Alfonso Has $5,000,000
"Alfonso," says Dr. Hulme, "is ut-
I terly worthless, physically, socially,
intellectually. Few other people
would have endured him so long as
did the Spanish." The former Kiny
of Spain, who is reputed to have
about $5,000,000 in ready cash, abdi
cated informally in 1931 during the
first of the revolutions that have
been stirring Spain.

dead, were powerful rulers. Are
these indications that hereditary rule
on the continent is at an end?
According to Dr. A. E. Hulme,
Professor of History at Stanford,
monarchy, in the case of Great
Britain, may lose what little power
it has left and slowly drop even the
prestige that it now holds. As an
evidence of that, the king restricts
his activities to the opening of court
houses, churches, &nd institutions,
and to the reading of a Speech that
the prime' minister has written at
the opening of parliament.
Why Edward Abdicated
Dr. Hulme gave two main reasons
for the abdication of Edward last
year, saying: "I think he realized
the great need of legislation to help
the mass of the working people; and
he also realized the impotence of a
king of his country to do anything
that amounts to anything in that
matter.
"Then, too, I believe that he is a
man to whom very few women ap
peal strongly in such a way as to
make him desire to live with them.
At last in Wally, he found such a
person. And when the archbishop
and the prime minister and other
titled nonentities objected to his
marriage with her and forced upon
him the alternative of the throne or
Wally, he chose the latter." /
Czar Backs Wrong Horse
The case of Czar Ferdinnad I of
Bulgaria is somewhat different, ac
cording to Dr. Hulme. "The Old
Fox" was a nickname applied to him
for his craftiness in politics and bus
iness. When the allies broke the
Saloniki front, the ruler fled to the
Austria nlines, abdicated in favor
of his youngest son, Boris, now rul
ing there. He now is spending his
time at Coburg in Thuringia, Ger
many.
Dr. Hulme describes Ferdinand as
"cultured, a man who frequented
many royal courts in Europe and
spent much time at such widely
known resorts as the Riviera and
i Biarritz. He had a wide acquaint
ance among royal, artistic, and
wealthy circles. He was esteemed as
a good companion. But in the war,
he put his money on the wrong
horse."
William's Inflated E^o
William 11, Emperor of Germany,
I is now living as an exile from his
| country in Doom, Holland. In the
i words of Dr. Hulme, "he suffered
; from an enormously inflated ego.
j Soon afte rhe succeeded to the
I throne, he dropped the ruthless but
| wise Bismarck and undertook to
| guide the German Empire himself.
] He made a mess of the job. He is
j now an exile too."
The Kaiser has left Germany.
, Rule there is now out of the hands
of any hereditary powers. The gov
ernment now in power rode in on a
wav eof popularity. This monarchy
has come to a complete end.
Alfonso Has $5,000,000
"Alfonso," says Dr. Hulme, "is ut-
I terly worthless, physically, socially,
intellectually. Few other people
would have endured him so long as
did the Spanish." The former Kiny
of Spain, who is reputed to have
about $5,000,000 in ready cash, abdi
cated informally in 1931 during the
first of the revolutions that have
been stirring Spain.
Eight ex-rulers of modern Euro
pean and Asiatic countries are yet

parts of Europe. The Czar of Rus
