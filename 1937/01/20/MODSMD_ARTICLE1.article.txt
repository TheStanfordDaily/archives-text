A similar organization in South
ern California has been formed to
publicize the subject and to urge
legislation to bring the diseases un
der control. Dr. Thomas Parian, Jr.,
Surgeon General of the United
States, is leading the national cam
paign which is financed through
funds granted by social security leg
islation.
Concerning the campaigning, Dr.
Wilbur said: "Although we need not
exaggerate or frighten, we do need
to face the facts and improve exist
ing conditions. The American fam
ily needs full protection from its
malignant enemies, gonorrhea and
syphilis. Too long have we covered
these diseases up and blinked at the
dead babies, broken marriages, and
damaged young men and women."
Test Discussed
Any talk of compulsory Wasser
mann tost for syphilis for students
at Stanford, as has been discussed
at the University of California,
was termed premature by Dr.
Walter Brown, Universtiy Health
Service Director. It was his opin
ion that to be consistent, a general
test should he considered first.
"But that is only one of the items,"
he said.
According to Dr. R. V. Lee, asso
ciate professor in the Medical School !
who is interested in the campaign
and helped in the formation of the j
Southern California association, a '
bill on the subject is to be introduced j
in the state legislature tomorrow. It ;
would establish a bureau in the j
Board of Health which will have su- 1
pervision of venereal cases and pro- !
vide for "stringent treatment for such :
cases and their behavior."
