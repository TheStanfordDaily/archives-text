# Drama Group To Read 'Pelleas' Tonight at 8
## Amelia Baines, Spaulding Have Leads in Play 
### 
Maeterlinck's "Pelleas and Meli
sandc," Sword and Sandals reading
which is being given this evening
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theater,
is a play of destiny remarkable for
the beauty of its words and a rhyth
mic quality of expression.
Belgian by birth, Maeterlinck
wrote his masterpiece in French but
flawless translations have been made
in English. A writer who has af
fected more than any other the con
temporary drama of early twentieth
century, in "Pelleas and Melisande"
he has consummated his belief that
it isn't what the actors do that is
important but what they say and
how they feel.
Although this unusual play has
required more preparation by the
readers than other Sword and San
dals productions, Director Brobury
Ellis feels his cast is in good form.
As Genevieve, the mother, Vir
ginia Rogers will be seen in her
initial appearance on the Stanford
stage presaging her important role
as Anne Shakespeare in the winter
quarter production "This Side Idol
atry."
Title roles are being read this eve
ning by Amelia Baines and Art
Spaulding, both of whom were last
seen in the fall Big Game Gaieties.
Others cast importantly are Janet
Dole, Harold Kahn, and Edward
Mack. Servant roles are carried by
Anton Badouh, Gene Glasmann, and
Fiances Farmer. Jack Dawson plays
an old physician.

A black widow spider, kept in a
battle nine weeks without food, spun
a web and hatched young spiders.
