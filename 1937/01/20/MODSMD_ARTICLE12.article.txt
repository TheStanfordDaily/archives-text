# Sequoia May House Grads
## Cost of New Dormitory Prohibitive, Says Roth 
### 
Graduate men, now scattered
about the campus, may be housed
in Sequoia Hall in the future, Comp
troller Almon E. Roth announced
yesterday. Petitions which were
started at an Encina smoker early
in December led to fhe move.
Cost of a new dormitory in the
Toyon-Branner group, original re
quest of graduates, was called pro
hibitive by Mr. Roth, who said that
the University would first make a
survey of â€¢ present living quarters.
Second problem would be to move
present inmates of Sequoia to other
halls.
Grouping according to schools was
the main desire of ihe graduates in
petitioning for separate living quar
ters. Many are now living on the
fifth floor of Encina.
