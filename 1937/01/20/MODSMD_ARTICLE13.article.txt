ZOOK VERSUS ZOOK!
. . . The battle of the ages!
This was the general agreement
as Rally Committee met in the Pa
vilion last night to choose six sopho
mores from the group of tryoutees
hoping to win fame as assistant yell
leaders after the A.S.S.U. election
February 9.
The six named by the anonymous
votes of 23 Rally Committeemen
were, besides the Zook twins,
Dwight and Wayne: Meritt Cutten,
George Egan, Bill Todd, and Lomax
Turner
Each applicant let! two yells, tim -
ing which they all attempted to keep
up an original line of banter, before
retiring to await the decision of the

judges. New to Stanford cheering
was the backward-flip with which
Turner closed his final yell.
Each of these six will be given
chances fo show their stuff before
basketball audiences: first at the St.
Mary's game Saturday, and later at
the U.C. and S.F. games on February
5 and fi respectively.
With these new men, who will
work in pairs, will be Assistant Yell
Leaders Jim Ransahoff and Nelly
Wheeler, who will take their places
as acting yell leader during the half
at each of the three games.
In the elections in February, ei
ther Wheeler or Ransahoff will take
the plate of retiring Yell King Webb
Jones.



T. M. McDANIEL (singular plu
ral) chairman of Rally Commit
tee. and KAY MOHAN, women's
chairman, whose charges gathered
in the Pavilion last night to vocif
erously choose six lusty yell lead
ers from the attendant aspiring
sophomores.
