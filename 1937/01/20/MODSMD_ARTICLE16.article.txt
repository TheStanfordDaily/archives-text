# Janitors' Raise To Go for Bills
## Illnesses, Wine, Women, Whoopee Take Toll 
### 
j Who will get the janitors' money?
: Interest in the veterans' bonus is on
I the wane, but here is a new factor
to be faced by assayers of the public
! buying power.
Many members of the sweep-up
| gang are now getting $(K) instead of
| $45 a month plus room and board,
I according to Comptroller Roth's an
i nouncement yesterday.
Medical bills will take up much of
| the raise for one man. It i.s expen
| sive to have a sick wife, and he has
! other bills besides.
| One of the Encina janitors, also,
i will have to throw his raise into old
j bills. Later on he expects to learn
! photography, starting out with a
| correspondence course.
Wine, women, and whoopee will be
sufficient investment for one of the
broom men.
Up in the Press Building, the jani
; tor said that better clothes will be
i part of his program of economic ex-
I pansion. Better clothes and learning
; a trade are his aims.
