# Election Changes Win Approval Of Ex Committee
## Early Induction of Officers Is Dinged; Youth Act Supported; Contests Given Final Blow by Women 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Ex Coiuniitte last night passed unanimously a resolution calling for a
special A.S.S.U. election Thursday. January 28, at which the student bod\
will vote on three Constitutional amendments.
The Constitutional changes, if passed by a majority of A.S.S.U. mem
bers. will shift the spring general elections from May up to the third Tues
day in spring quarter, and will cause three Men's and Women's Council
members to be elected in February rather than in May.

the amendments as they wilj ap-<
! pear on the special election ballot,
! are:
i (I) That Articlc 7, Section 1, shall be
! amended to read—"There shall be
i two regular elections held during the
1 University year. One on the second
1 Tuesday in February, and the other
J on the third Tuesday in spring quar
. ter." (This will not change the Feb
ruary election date as it now stands
I on the second Tuesday in Febru
j ary.)
(2) That Article 3, Section 28, be
amended to read: "Three members of
! Men's Council shall be elected in
February each year to hold office one
| year, and two elected in April to hold
J office for the following year."
; (3) That Article 3, Section 38, be
i amended to read: "Three members of
! Women's Council shall be elected in
j February each year tlhodffieoco I
i February each year to hold office one
; year, and two elected in April to
• hold office for the following year."
Council Change
Amendments 2 and 3 simply call
j for three Council members to be
elected in February instead of three
1 in the spring, as the Constitution now
i states. This change is suggested by
Ex Committee because under the
j present set-up, with only two mem
| hers carrying over from spring to
; fall quarter, two vacancies are liable
| to occur when members do not re
| turn to school, thus leaving three
' "green" Councilmen to start out the
! year. If the amendments are passed,
| there will be more assurance that at
I least one "old member" will be back
I after the summer.
Amendment I, moving spring elec
tions up almost a month, will give
| newly elected officers a longer chance '
to become acquainted with their du
i ties.
February Induction Dinged
The question of having principal
A.S.S.U. officers take their posts in
Fbruary, as suggsted by Barbara
Kimball, was dinged for good when
Ex Committee voted to drop that
consideration entirely.
Women's Conference President
Kimball's motion that "those elected
in the spring take office within two
weeks" failed to pass the body. Thus
it became evident that regular in
duction of student body officers will
remain at the beginning of fall
quarter.
Other business included:
CALIFORNIA YOUTH ACT: With
only two dissenting votes (those of
Shirley Jones and Ruth Goodan)
Ex Committee officially approved
"the principles embodied in the Cali
fornia Youth Act."
Some dissention arose over the
question whether Ex Committee had
the moral right to approve a thing of
this nature in the name of the Stan
ford student body. Larry Rouble ar
gued that Ex Committee should only
pass on matters directly connected
wtih student affairs. Some thought
official approval of the act might
prove "embarrassing to the faculty,
the trustees, the alumni, or others
connected with Stanford."
But approval was granted, and
Jackie Brown thereby became the !
Stanford member of the Executive '
Council of the Northern California ;
Youth Congress, who among others I
are sponsoring the act.
WRESTLING: Ex Committee rec
ommended to the B.A.C. that wrest- j
ling be made a minor sport. Roy j
Thompson had last week presented a
petition to President Reynolds ask- i
ing for this recommendation.
NITKRY: Reynolds reported that
Comptroller Roth was now working:
on an estimate for remodeling the J
Old Union. He said that building a |
social room there would lose the Un- i
ion $1000 a year in room rent be- j
cause the dormitory rooms upstairs j
will be converted into A.S.S.U. of- i
fices.
•POPULARITY CONTESTS': The
women of Stanford, through the j
Women's Conference, have none on I
record against any popularity con
tests in which they are involved,'
Barbara Kimball reported.
DATES GRANTED: Toyon-Bran
ner, Feb. fi: Lagunita and Encina,
Feb. 13; Phi Kappa Psi, Feb. 26; and

Council was granted an open date
Feb. 13. allowing it two nights for

February Induction Dinged
The question of having principal
A.S.S.U. officers take their posts in
Fbruary, as suggsted by Barbara
Kimball, was dinged for good when
Ex Committee voted to drop that
consideration entirely.
Women's Conference President
Kimball's motion that "those elected
in the spring take office within two
weeks" failed to pass the body. Thus
it became evident that regular in
duction of student body officers will
remain at the beginning of fall
quarter.
Other business included:
CALIFORNIA YOUTH ACT: With
only two dissenting votes (those of
Shirley Jones and Ruth Goodan)
Ex Committee officially approved
"the principles embodied in the Cali
fornia Youth Act."
Some dissention arose over the
question whether Ex Committee had
the moral right to approve a thing of
this nature in the name of the Stan
ford student body. Larry Rouble ar
gued that Ex Committee should only
pass on matters directly connected
wtih student affairs. Some thought
official approval of the act might
prove "embarrassing to the faculty,
the trustees, the alumni, or others
connected with Stanford."
But approval was granted, and
Jackie Brown thereby became the !
Stanford member of the Executive '
Council of the Northern California ;
Youth Congress, who among others I
are sponsoring the act.
WRESTLING: Ex Committee rec
ommended to the B.A.C. that wrest- j
ling be made a minor sport. Roy j
Thompson had last week presented a
petition to President Reynolds ask- i
ing for this recommendation.
NITKRY: Reynolds reported that
Comptroller Roth was now working:
on an estimate for remodeling the J
Old Union. He said that building a |
social room there would lose the Un- i
ion $1000 a year in room rent be- j
cause the dormitory rooms upstairs j
will be converted into A.S.S.U. of- i
fices.
•POPULARITY CONTESTS': The
women of Stanford, through the j
Women's Conference, have none on I
record against any popularity con
tests in which they are involved,'

DATES GRANTED: Toyon-Bran
ner, Feb. fi: Lagunita and Encina,
Feb. 13; Phi Kappa Psi, Feb. 26; and
Delta Upsilon. March fi. Dramatic

Ex Coiuniitte last night passed unanimously a resolution calling for a
special A.S.S.U. election Thursday. January 28, at which the student bod\
will vote on three Constitutional amendments.
The Constitutional changes, if passed by a majority of A.S.S.U. mem
bers. will shift the spring general elections from May up to the third Tues
day in spring quarter, and will cause three Men's and Women's Council
members to be elected in February rather than in May.

the amendments as they wilj ap-<
! pear on the special election ballot,
! are:
i (I) That Articlc 7, Section 1, shall be
! amended to read—"There shall be
i two regular elections held during the
1 University year. One on the second
1 Tuesday in February, and the other
J on the third Tuesday in spring quar
. ter." (This will not change the Feb
ruary election date as it now stands
I on the second Tuesday in Febru
j ary.)
(2) That Article 3, Section 28, be
amended to read: "Three members of
! Men's Council shall be elected in
February each year to hold office one
| year, and two elected in April to hold
J office for the following year."
; (3) That Article 3, Section 38, be
i amended to read: "Three members of
! Women's Council shall be elected in
j February each year tlhodffieoco I
i February each year to hold office one
; year, and two elected in April to
• hold office for the following year."
Council Change
Amendments 2 and 3 simply call
j for three Council members to be
elected in February instead of three
1 in the spring, as the Constitution now
i states. This change is suggested by
Ex Committee because under the
j present set-up, with only two mem
| hers carrying over from spring to
; fall quarter, two vacancies are liable
| to occur when members do not re
| turn to school, thus leaving three
' "green" Councilmen to start out the
! year. If the amendments are passed,
| there will be more assurance that at
I least one "old member" will be back
I after the summer.
Amendment I, moving spring elec
tions up almost a month, will give
| newly elected officers a longer chance '
to become acquainted with their du
i ties.

presentation of "This Side Idolatry," j
winter nlay. Sophomore class re
ceived March ."> for its Sophomore
.Cotillion, a closed date.
Ex Coiuniitte last night passed unanimously a resolution calling for a
special A.S.S.U. election Thursday. January 28, at which the student bod\
will vote on three Constitutional amendments.
The Constitutional changes, if passed by a majority of A.S.S.U. mem
bers. will shift the spring general elections from May up to the third Tues
day in spring quarter, and will cause three Men's and Women's Council
members to be elected in February rather than in May.

the amendments as they wilj ap-<
! pear on the special election ballot,
! are:
i (I) That Articlc 7, Section 1, shall be
! amended to read—"There shall be
i two regular elections held during the
1 University year. One on the second
1 Tuesday in February, and the other
J on the third Tuesday in spring quar
. ter." (This will not change the Feb
ruary election date as it now stands
I on the second Tuesday in Febru
j ary.)
(2) That Article 3, Section 28, be
amended to read: "Three members of
! Men's Council shall be elected in
February each year to hold office one
| year, and two elected in April to hold
J office for the following year."
; (3) That Article 3, Section 38, be
i amended to read: "Three members of
! Women's Council shall be elected in
j February each year tlhodffieoco I
i February each year to hold office one
; year, and two elected in April to
• hold office for the following year."
Council Change
Amendments 2 and 3 simply call
j for three Council members to be
elected in February instead of three
1 in the spring, as the Constitution now
i states. This change is suggested by
Ex Committee because under the
j present set-up, with only two mem
| hers carrying over from spring to
; fall quarter, two vacancies are liable
| to occur when members do not re
| turn to school, thus leaving three
' "green" Councilmen to start out the
! year. If the amendments are passed,
| there will be more assurance that at
I least one "old member" will be back
I after the summer.
Amendment I, moving spring elec
tions up almost a month, will give
| newly elected officers a longer chance '
to become acquainted with their du
i ties.
February Induction Dinged
The question of having principal
A.S.S.U. officers take their posts in
Fbruary, as suggsted by Barbara
Kimball, was dinged for good when
Ex Committee voted to drop that
consideration entirely.
Women's Conference President
Kimball's motion that "those elected
in the spring take office within two
weeks" failed to pass the body. Thus
it became evident that regular in
duction of student body officers will
remain at the beginning of fall
quarter.
Other business included:
CALIFORNIA YOUTH ACT: With
only two dissenting votes (those of
Shirley Jones and Ruth Goodan)
Ex Committee officially approved
"the principles embodied in the Cali
fornia Youth Act."
Some dissention arose over the
question whether Ex Committee had
the moral right to approve a thing of
this nature in the name of the Stan
ford student body. Larry Rouble ar
gued that Ex Committee should only
pass on matters directly connected
wtih student affairs. Some thought
official approval of the act might
prove "embarrassing to the faculty,
the trustees, the alumni, or others
connected with Stanford."
But approval was granted, and
Jackie Brown thereby became the !
Stanford member of the Executive '
Council of the Northern California ;
Youth Congress, who among others I
are sponsoring the act.
WRESTLING: Ex Committee rec
ommended to the B.A.C. that wrest- j
ling be made a minor sport. Roy j
Thompson had last week presented a
petition to President Reynolds ask- i
ing for this recommendation.
NITKRY: Reynolds reported that
Comptroller Roth was now working:
on an estimate for remodeling the J
Old Union. He said that building a |
social room there would lose the Un- i
ion $1000 a year in room rent be- j
cause the dormitory rooms upstairs j
will be converted into A.S.S.U. of- i
fices.
•POPULARITY CONTESTS': The
women of Stanford, through the j
Women's Conference, have none on I
record against any popularity con
tests in which they are involved,'
Barbara Kimball reported.
