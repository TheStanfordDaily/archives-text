RIPPLING ROTTEN RHYTHMS
The saddest news since Helen
Ward left Benny Goodman's band is
the \inofficial rumor that the eastern
part of the United States is going
wild about the gurgling gleeps of
Shep Fields' Rippling Rhythm or
chestra.
In a way, this rumor is even sad
der than the story that the famous
record telling how one can "get 'em
from the peanut man" sold 160,000
copies whereas a Bing Crosby hit is
a gold-mine if it sells 20,000. The
great sale of "Get 'Em from the
Peanut Man" can almost be excused
on grounds that this piece of phono
graphic pornography is placed large
ly in the nickel phonograph machines
in the beer halls, where if the lower
elements of the population are not to
be found, at least the better elements
found there are in their lower moods.
<« * *
But mere abstinence from beer is
not a guaranty of absolute perfection
in other matters, and I am posi
tively convinced that there is some
thing fundamentally wrong with the
musical taste of the sober, respect
able American citizenry who keep
such stupendous garbage-vendors as
Shep Fields in business.
The sorry part about it all is that
Shep Fields is not the only pap dis
penser who has reaped a fortune off
purveying hooeyil'erous music. The
more palpable and pernicious musical
charlatans are those on the order of
George Gershwin, who has such
overwhelming delusions of grandeur
that the critical forces of practically
every local newspaper, including the
Stanford Daily, were completely
hoaxed by the great master's late
appearance in San Francisco. Gersh
win, whose Rhapsody in Blue was
made successful only after Ferde
Grofe gave it some semblance of co- !
herence and added the superfluous
gingerbread trimmings, is practically
the pioneer in the field of punk music
scored in the grand manner. The
clarinet peeps somewhere earlier in
the "Rhapsody" are strangely rem
iniscent of Ted Lewis, and Duke El
lington notices a raft of swipes from
more classical musicians in Gersh
win's Porgy and Bess music, thus
proving that Gershwin is a mixture
of the ridiculous and the sublime to
produce the phony.
Speaking of Ted Lewis, it is pos
sible to point out that as early as
1025 Ted Lewis was producing rauc
ous noise and singing about when his
baby smiled at him, but Ted does
not take himself seriously and does
not maliciously swindle the public.
He does "When My Baby Smiles at
Me' with a tongue-in-the-cheek
manner that makes it funny and
forgiveable, and Benny Goodman,
Fats Waller, Mugsy Spainer, and
Trombonist George Brunies have all
drawn pay-checks from Ted Lewis,
so the old atrocious barnyard clar
inet is the only thing that can be
sneered at. except Ted himself gen
erally.
•* * *
The great group against which I
rail is that select company to which
}>elong Ted Fioßito, Jan Garber, Art
Kassel, the much-reviled Guy Lom
bardo, Wayne King, Eddy Duchin,
Clyde McMoy, Harry Roy, and, of
course, the bread-and-milk imita
tion of Shep Fields, George Hamilton
and His Veloz and Yolanda Dancing
Music. It may be contended that
these feeble bands play as they do
Ix'cause they make money doing it,
but the public which supports them
is not paid to like them. 1 confess I
cannot understand why the public
likes them. Ted Fioßito's Mickey
Mouse fife-and-drurn corps was
fairly harmless, and Guy Lombardo's
syrup ladlers, who blow their saxo
phones out of the corner of their
mouths, have been hated by enough
people so that I cannot complain on
that score. Jan Garber was an ob
vious imitation of course both he

and Lombardo having plumbed the ]
depths of gruttiness so low that com
parisons as to which is worse are
impossible.
But no band, I guess, could ever
live down Carmen Lombardo. Art
Ka.ssel I have not heard for a couple
of years, but if Bernheim says his
music is utterly charming and whim
sical, it must be the same old stuff,
Jan Garber out of Wayne King. King
is not bad, he just plays bad, and that
newest noise from England, Harry
Roy, merely sounds like he is play
ing "Twelfth Street Rag" all the
time, no matter what tune he tackles.
Duchin, of course, and Clyde Mc-
Coy are both past comprehension.
Clyde McCoy portrays jazz music as
a hoochi-koochie dancer portrays
feminine charm, and as long as the
side-show hula girl flourishes, I
guess Clyde McCoy will also. But
Shep Fields is the enigma of the age.
That such a conglomeration of gargl
ing noises produced by blowing bub
bles into a glass of water through a
straw, a mess of foolish trills on an
accordion, and three or four peep
ing, pecking trumpets should all
combine to make a sound which is
worth money is a pitiful commentary
on some people's taste.
■:« * +
If they think Shep Fields is really
one of the very finest, then when
our own private American judgment
day comes, the smoke will clear away
and alongside Shep Fields as the an
gel of music, Marion Davies and
Dicky Boy Powell will be enthroned
as king and queen of drama and
Bernarr MacFadden, waving aloft
Physical Culture and Liberty maga
zines, the patron saint of American
literature.

The great group against which I
rail is that select company to which
}>elong Ted Fioßito, Jan Garber, Art
Kassel, the much-reviled Guy Lom
bardo, Wayne King, Eddy Duchin,
Clyde McMoy, Harry Roy, and, of
course, the bread-and-milk imita
tion of Shep Fields, George Hamilton
and His Veloz and Yolanda Dancing
Music. It may be contended that
these feeble bands play as they do
Ix'cause they make money doing it,
but the public which supports them
is not paid to like them. 1 confess I
cannot understand why the public
likes them. Ted Fioßito's Mickey
Mouse fife-and-drurn corps was
fairly harmless, and Guy Lombardo's
syrup ladlers, who blow their saxo
phones out of the corner of their
mouths, have been hated by enough
people so that I cannot complain on
that score. Jan Garber was an ob
vious imitation of course both he

and Lombardo having plumbed the ]
depths of gruttiness so low that com
parisons as to which is worse are
impossible.
But no band, I guess, could ever
live down Carmen Lombardo. Art
Ka.ssel I have not heard for a couple
of years, but if Bernheim says his
music is utterly charming and whim
sical, it must be the same old stuff,
Jan Garber out of Wayne King. King
is not bad, he just plays bad, and that
newest noise from England, Harry
Roy, merely sounds like he is play
ing "Twelfth Street Rag" all the
time, no matter what tune he tackles.
Duchin, of course, and Clyde Mc-
Coy are both past comprehension.
Clyde McCoy portrays jazz music as
a hoochi-koochie dancer portrays
feminine charm, and as long as the
side-show hula girl flourishes, I
guess Clyde McCoy will also. But
Shep Fields is the enigma of the age.
That such a conglomeration of gargl
ing noises produced by blowing bub
bles into a glass of water through a
straw, a mess of foolish trills on an
accordion, and three or four peep
ing, pecking trumpets should all
combine to make a sound which is
worth money is a pitiful commentary
on some people's taste.

If they think Shep Fields is really
one of the very finest, then when
our own private American judgment
day comes, the smoke will clear away
and alongside Shep Fields as the an
gel of music, Marion Davies and
Dicky Boy Powell will be enthroned
as king and queen of drama and
Bernarr MacFadden, waving aloft
Physical Culture and Liberty maga

The saddest news since Helen
Ward left Benny Goodman's band is
the \inofficial rumor that the eastern
part of the United States is going
wild about the gurgling gleeps of
Shep Fields' Rippling Rhythm or
chestra.
In a way, this rumor is even sad
der than the story that the famous
record telling how one can "get 'em
from the peanut man" sold 160,000
copies whereas a Bing Crosby hit is
a gold-mine if it sells 20,000. The
great sale of "Get 'Em from the
Peanut Man" can almost be excused
on grounds that this piece of phono
graphic pornography is placed large
ly in the nickel phonograph machines
in the beer halls, where if the lower
elements of the population are not to
be found, at least the better elements
found there are in their lower moods.
<« * *
But mere abstinence from beer is
not a guaranty of absolute perfection
in other matters, and I am posi
tively convinced that there is some
thing fundamentally wrong with the
musical taste of the sober, respect
able American citizenry who keep
such stupendous garbage-vendors as
Shep Fields in business.
The sorry part about it all is that
Shep Fields is not the only pap dis
penser who has reaped a fortune off
purveying hooeyil'erous music. The
more palpable and pernicious musical
charlatans are those on the order of
George Gershwin, who has such
overwhelming delusions of grandeur
that the critical forces of practically
every local newspaper, including the
Stanford Daily, were completely
hoaxed by the great master's late
appearance in San Francisco. Gersh
win, whose Rhapsody in Blue was
made successful only after Ferde
Grofe gave it some semblance of co- !
herence and added the superfluous
gingerbread trimmings, is practically
the pioneer in the field of punk music
scored in the grand manner. The
clarinet peeps somewhere earlier in
the "Rhapsody" are strangely rem
iniscent of Ted Lewis, and Duke El
lington notices a raft of swipes from
more classical musicians in Gersh
win's Porgy and Bess music, thus
proving that Gershwin is a mixture
of the ridiculous and the sublime to
produce the phony.
Speaking of Ted Lewis, it is pos
sible to point out that as early as
1025 Ted Lewis was producing rauc
ous noise and singing about when his
baby smiled at him, but Ted does
not take himself seriously and does
not maliciously swindle the public.
He does "When My Baby Smiles at
Me' with a tongue-in-the-cheek
manner that makes it funny and
forgiveable, and Benny Goodman,
Fats Waller, Mugsy Spainer, and

The saddest news since Helen
Ward left Benny Goodman's band is
the \inofficial rumor that the eastern
part of the United States is going
wild about the gurgling gleeps of
Shep Fields' Rippling Rhythm or
chestra.
In a way, this rumor is even sad
der than the story that the famous
record telling how one can "get 'em
from the peanut man" sold 160,000
copies whereas a Bing Crosby hit is
a gold-mine if it sells 20,000. The
great sale of "Get 'Em from the
Peanut Man" can almost be excused
on grounds that this piece of phono
graphic pornography is placed large
ly in the nickel phonograph machines
in the beer halls, where if the lower
elements of the population are not to
be found, at least the better elements
found there are in their lower moods.
<« * *
But mere abstinence from beer is
not a guaranty of absolute perfection
in other matters, and I am posi
tively convinced that there is some
thing fundamentally wrong with the
musical taste of the sober, respect
able American citizenry who keep
such stupendous garbage-vendors as
Shep Fields in business.
The sorry part about it all is that
Shep Fields is not the only pap dis
penser who has reaped a fortune off
purveying hooeyil'erous music. The
more palpable and pernicious musical
charlatans are those on the order of
George Gershwin, who has such
overwhelming delusions of grandeur
that the critical forces of practically
every local newspaper, including the
Stanford Daily, were completely
hoaxed by the great master's late
appearance in San Francisco. Gersh
win, whose Rhapsody in Blue was
made successful only after Ferde
Grofe gave it some semblance of co- !
herence and added the superfluous
gingerbread trimmings, is practically
the pioneer in the field of punk music
scored in the grand manner. The
clarinet peeps somewhere earlier in
the "Rhapsody" are strangely rem
iniscent of Ted Lewis, and Duke El
lington notices a raft of swipes from
more classical musicians in Gersh
win's Porgy and Bess music, thus
proving that Gershwin is a mixture
of the ridiculous and the sublime to
produce the phony.
Speaking of Ted Lewis, it is pos
sible to point out that as early as
1025 Ted Lewis was producing rauc
ous noise and singing about when his
baby smiled at him, but Ted does
not take himself seriously and does
not maliciously swindle the public.
He does "When My Baby Smiles at
Me' with a tongue-in-the-cheek
manner that makes it funny and
forgiveable, and Benny Goodman,
Fats Waller, Mugsy Spainer, and
Trombonist George Brunies have all
drawn pay-checks from Ted Lewis,
so the old atrocious barnyard clar
inet is the only thing that can be
sneered at. except Ted himself gen
erally.
•* * *
The great group against which I
rail is that select company to which
}>elong Ted Fioßito, Jan Garber, Art
Kassel, the much-reviled Guy Lom
bardo, Wayne King, Eddy Duchin,
Clyde McMoy, Harry Roy, and, of
course, the bread-and-milk imita
tion of Shep Fields, George Hamilton
and His Veloz and Yolanda Dancing
Music. It may be contended that
these feeble bands play as they do
Ix'cause they make money doing it,
but the public which supports them
is not paid to like them. 1 confess I
cannot understand why the public
likes them. Ted Fioßito's Mickey
Mouse fife-and-drurn corps was
fairly harmless, and Guy Lombardo's
syrup ladlers, who blow their saxo
phones out of the corner of their
mouths, have been hated by enough
people so that I cannot complain on
that score. Jan Garber was an ob
vious imitation of course both he

and Lombardo having plumbed the ]
depths of gruttiness so low that com
parisons as to which is worse are
impossible.
But no band, I guess, could ever
live down Carmen Lombardo. Art
Ka.ssel I have not heard for a couple
of years, but if Bernheim says his
music is utterly charming and whim
sical, it must be the same old stuff,
Jan Garber out of Wayne King. King
is not bad, he just plays bad, and that
newest noise from England, Harry
Roy, merely sounds like he is play
ing "Twelfth Street Rag" all the
time, no matter what tune he tackles.
Duchin, of course, and Clyde Mc-
Coy are both past comprehension.
Clyde McCoy portrays jazz music as
a hoochi-koochie dancer portrays
feminine charm, and as long as the
side-show hula girl flourishes, I
guess Clyde McCoy will also. But
Shep Fields is the enigma of the age.
That such a conglomeration of gargl
ing noises produced by blowing bub
bles into a glass of water through a
straw, a mess of foolish trills on an
accordion, and three or four peep
ing, pecking trumpets should all
combine to make a sound which is
worth money is a pitiful commentary
on some people's taste.
