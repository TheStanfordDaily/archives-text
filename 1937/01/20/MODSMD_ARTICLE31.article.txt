ONCE UPON A TIME
THERE WAS
This is a story of success . . . and
of hard luck.
There was a fellow came to school
here back in 1930. A long, gangling
youth he was, and the following
spring saw him running the hurdles
with Coach Bill Ellington's frnsh
track team.
Dink Templeton and Bill did pret
ty well with him that year, because
he wasn't worth much when he got
here, but the three of them got him
down to 15.5 and 25 flat before the
season was over, and he was second
to Dave Packard in both hurdle
races in the Little Big Meet.
The next year the fellow began to
fdl out and look more like an athlete.
He was a varsity man, and a good
one. fie won both hurdle events
against California, but those were
U.S.C.'s meaty days, and they
squeezed him out. He served notice
of things to come by taking fifth in
the 1.C.4-A. lows.
In 1933 the guy came into national
prominence when he went East with
15 other Stanford men, and in a heat
set a meet record of 14.7 in the highs.
Lyon, of U.S.C., won the finals in the
same time.
On the way home, however, this
fellow reached what turned out to be
the peak of his career —the N.C.A.A.
high hurdles championship in Chi
cago at the then world's record time
of 14.2.
SO THEN lIE
BECAME CAPTAIN
In 1934 they elected him captain of
the Stanford track team, due partly
to his fine hurdling record, due more
to another factor that always is im
portant in determining Stanford
track captains—he had one of those
magnetically likeable personalities
that combined with good sense made
him the type that his team-mates de
lighted in knowing and working for,
both on the track and off.
Well, you've heard of Stanford
track captains of that age—Smith,
Eastman, Hables—there seemed to be
a jinx on each of their senior years,
and in 1934 it struck doubly hard.
The captain was going good, that
year, second to Klopstock in the
highs at 14.5 and tied with Sammy
in 'he lows at 24 flat in the Big Meet.
A 23.6 flight of lows he won against
the Olympic Club.
Then on April 28 came the Fresno
State meet.
PEOPLE WILL
It EM EMBER THAT DAY
It was a big day—Walter Marty
broke the high jump with 6-9's. The
captain won the high hurdles in 14.8.
Late in the afternoon came the lows.
Three men were entered, Ward and
Floyd Wilson of Fresno, and the cap
tain. He had a slight lead as the
flashy field swept up to the third
hurdle on the old Angell Field.
But the jinx made his lead foot tip
the hurdle; the captain lost his bal
ance and fell to the cinderpath. Wil
son tripped over him and also
sprawled. Ward went on to win in
25.7, Wilson limping in second.
The captain, however, was writh
ing in pain. Helped to his feet, he
was found to have a compound frac
ture of the left forearm; both radius
and luna bones had protruded
the flesh and into the cinders. Be
fore doctors reached him the bones
were pushed back into place, and
the remaining cinders caused infec
tion. That ended his season.and what
a season! Remember the seven men
that without him were N.C.A.A. and
1.C.4-A. champs?
To say the least, it was a long road
to recovery, with that badly broken
arm and infection. The captain was
graduated, and started Law School,
always with that plaster cast on his
arm. He coached at Menlo, but his
activities were hampered because the
limb and repeated operations on it
weakened him.
Now his interests have changed to
medicine, with all of this acquaint
anceship with it. and he is preparing
for Med School instead of law.
People still say, after having met
him, "Is that Captain (ius Meier? I
never knew any athlete that was so
well spoken, cheerful, and gentle
manly."
In April, after three long years, the
doctors say that his arm may be
freed from the plaster cast.
