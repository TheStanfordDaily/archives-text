Preparing for their game Friday
j afternoon with Lowell High, frosh
| basketballers yesterday practiced
| with Menlo Jaysee hoopsters, going
through their maneuvers, however,
| minus the services of Bill Leckie,
I guard.
i After Monday's workout, Leckie,
while merely "fooling around" took
| a bad fall, with the result that he
| tore ligaments and had internal
hemorrhages in his right ankle. It
i has not been determined as yet how
i long he will be out.
Strong Team
In their game with Lowell, the
frosh will be meeting a team which
is this season gunning for its fourth
consecutive title in the unlimited
; class. The Lowell boys, nicknamed
! the Cardinals, are coached by Ben
j ney Nefl, who, in his eleven years at
' that school, has turned out five titleâ€”
, winning teams in the unlimited divi-
I sion.
Prep Hoop Star
j Star of the Lowell offense is Don
Burness, high-scoring center, who
j stands six two, and who is ac
! claimed as the outstanding prep
hoopster in the City. Hailed as an
! other Luisetti, Bumess is one of
! the two returning veterans who
| strengthen the Cardinal team. The
1 other is Willard Blackfield, squatty
i little forward.
Zone Defense
The remaining positions on the
j first string are filled by Pete Delos
| at the other forward spot, and Rod
Nessier and Bob Ferrick at the two
j guard posts. Outstanding subs are
} Doug Raaka, Bill Cowden, Dave
| Solomon, and Allan Gross.
The Lowell team, reputed to be
I one of the strongest prep outfits in
| San Francisco, plays a straight zone
; defense. They meet the frosh at 4:30
| Friday afternoon in the Pavilion.
The weather station at Colon. Isth
mus of Panama, records fewer tem
peratures of 90 degrees than do many
