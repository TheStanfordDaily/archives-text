# Card Hoopsters Scrimmage For Bear Tilt Friday
## Strategic Plays Expected To Crush Steamroller Offense of Nibs Price 
### WALT PETERSON 
With the "gas-house gang" under
the tutelage of Assistant Coach Ben
Winkleman running California plays
against them, the varsity hoopsters
drilled mainly on defense last night
in preparation for the first, of the
Card-Bear series set for Edwards
Gym in Berkeley Friday night.
The hard-working boys who get
lots of exercise and no glory stooged
around for an hour or more as the
Crimson Crusher worked on a plan
of defense that is calculated to be
better than a piece of fly paper in
sticking up the work of Nibs Price's
fine Italian hand.
Frequently built around such
graceful monsters as Bob Herwig, the
Price teams have never been particu
larly noted for their finesse. They
have always been strong, having
beaten John Bunn's Stanford outfits
10 times as compared to five Card
wins since 1931, but they get their
strength from brute force more than
from delicately organized and exe
cuted plays.
To consider that the Bears are
good this year is no idle presump
tion, in spite of the fact that they
have already lost their two opening
games to U.S.C. From their last
year's team they lost only Captain
Ray Olson, and his place has been
filled by one Mr. Duffy, a wicked
eager when he's hot.
So far this season he has been an
in-and-outer, being very cool dur
ing the Ohio State series but going
nutty with a 43-point total in the
Oregon and Santa Clara games. Over
the week-end, though, he suffered a
relapse, netting only 13 in the two
Troy games.
The Bears also have a new guard,
Ralph Hillsman, who has snatched
away one starting berth from Rough
house Robert Herwig, the Lad who
never can get football out of his
mind.
Remembering that virtually this

same Cal team was good enough to
take a pair of the four games last
year from the tea mhtat won the
Coast title, it must be realized that
even if they have lost to Troy they
aren't such small potatoes. The sit
uation might be a little different this
year from the team that won the
strength of the Cards.

have already lost their two opening
games to U.S.C. From their last
year's team they lost only Captain
Ray Olson, and his place has been
filled by one Mr. Duffy, a wicked
eager when he's hot.
So far this season he has been an
in-and-outer, being very cool dur
ing the Ohio State series but going
nutty with a 43-point total in the
Oregon and Santa Clara games. Over
the week-end, though, he suffered a
relapse, netting only 13 in the two
Troy games.
The Bears also have a new guard,
Ralph Hillsman, who has snatched
away one starting berth from Rough
house Robert Herwig, the Lad who
never can get football out of his
mind.
Remembering that virtually this

same Cal team was good enough to
take a pair of the four games last
year from the tea mhtat won the
Coast title, it must be realized that
even if they have lost to Troy they
aren't such small potatoes. The sit
uation might be a little different this
year from the team that won the
strength of the Cards.
