ANGERED BY ATTEMPTS to halt the passage of food to stay-in strikers in Fisher Body Plant No. 2,
Flint, Mich., strike sympathizers overturned this automobile of Sheriff Thomas W. Wolcott and battled police
for five hours. Deputies climbed out of the machine unhurt. Governor Murphy later called out the Na
tional Guard.
