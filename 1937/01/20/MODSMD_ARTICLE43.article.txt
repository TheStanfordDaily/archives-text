# Sold Out

The fourth number of Daily Californian Edi
tor Jim Doyle's new volume came out yester
day morning. And the results lead us to con
clude that editors may come and editors may
go, but The Daily Cal is The Daily Cal. The
editorial was on Stanford.
Subtopic of the editorial was John Bunn,
Stanford basketball coach, and his attitude. The
Daily Cal did not like Coach Bunn's attitude. In
lact it said that Coach Bunn's attitude hit an all
time low for the Pacific Coast Conference." If
this is true, Coach Bunn and his attitude are
very low indeed.
These editorial hysterics follow an old Cali
fornia custom of pre - game intercollegiate
gnashing of teeth done in order to fire up the
local reader audience into some sort of a frenzy
at the infamy of the opposing side and the moral
decadence of tke coaching staff. This develops
school spirit, editorials in favor of which may
be seen in many high school and college
papers.
The charges revolve around this point: An
Eastbay sportswriter, Art Cohn, whom Stan
fordites may remember as the man of the Alus
tiza "bad blood" hoax of two years ago, pub
lished in the Oakland Tribune the statement
that, following last week-end's games, Coach
Bunn, angry at the rough play of the U.C.L.A.
team, said that if other teams wanted to mix it
up his boys were capable of the s?me thing. He
was quoted further as including California and
its uncontented bovine Herwig on the same in
vitation.
So California is now deeply touched that their
team should be charged with rough playing,
before the game begins.
Coach Bunn may have said substantially that.
Having your players knocked unconscious on
the floor leads to a rather unsettled feeling in
the adrenalin glands. But he never said it for
publication.
Good newspapermen do not print things
not said for publication (only college journalists
like The Dippy men, alas!). That consideration
has never bothered Mr. Cohn, however.
But let us not be unduly harsh with Mr. Cohn.
He undoubtedly leads a repressed and inhib
ited life, relieved only by an occasional adoles
cent sense of naughtiness at being the bad boy
of the Eastbay prints.
Nor need we be unduly incensed at The Daily
Cal. They have their role in society to fill. Cali
fornia readers must be incensed. However, it
is too bad that the personal feelings of the
Stanford coach, which are quite logical, and
the personal feelings of the California coach,
who is Nibs Price, must be vented all over
every place, particularly when the game is
already sold out.

gnashing of teeth done in order to fire up the
local reader audience into some sort of a frenzy
at the infamy of the opposing side and the moral
decadence of tke coaching staff. This develops
school spirit, editorials in favor of which may
be seen in many high school and college
papers.
The charges revolve around this point: An
Eastbay sportswriter, Art Cohn, whom Stan
fordites may remember as the man of the Alus
tiza "bad blood" hoax of two years ago, pub
lished in the Oakland Tribune the statement
that, following last week-end's games, Coach
Bunn, angry at the rough play of the U.C.L.A.
team, said that if other teams wanted to mix it
up his boys were capable of the s?me thing. He
was quoted further as including California and
its uncontented bovine Herwig on the same in
vitation.
So California is now deeply touched that their
team should be charged with rough playing,
before the game begins.
Coach Bunn may have said substantially that.
Having your players knocked unconscious on
the floor leads to a rather unsettled feeling in
the adrenalin glands. But he never said it for
publication.
Good newspapermen do not print things
not said for publication (only college journalists
like The Dippy men, alas!). That consideration
has never bothered Mr. Cohn, however.
But let us not be unduly harsh with Mr. Cohn.
He undoubtedly leads a repressed and inhib
ited life, relieved only by an occasional adoles
cent sense of naughtiness at being the bad boy
of the Eastbay prints.
Nor need we be unduly incensed at The Daily
Cal. They have their role in society to fill. Cali
fornia readers must be incensed. However, it
is too bad that the personal feelings of the
Stanford coach, which are quite logical, and
the personal feelings of the California coach,
who is Nibs Price, must be vented all over
every place, particularly when the game is
already sold out.
The fourth number of Daily Californian Edi
tor Jim Doyle's new volume came out yester
day morning. And the results lead us to con
clude that editors may come and editors may
go, but The Daily Cal is The Daily Cal. The
editorial was on Stanford.
Subtopic of the editorial was John Bunn,
Stanford basketball coach, and his attitude. The
Daily Cal did not like Coach Bunn's attitude. In
lact it said that Coach Bunn's attitude hit an all
time low for the Pacific Coast Conference." If
this is true, Coach Bunn and his attitude are
very low indeed.
These editorial hysterics follow an old Cali
fornia custom of pre - game intercollegiate
gnashing of teeth done in order to fire up the
local reader audience into some sort of a frenzy
at the infamy of the opposing side and the moral
decadence of tke coaching staff. This develops
