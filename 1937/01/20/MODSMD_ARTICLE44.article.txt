# No Horde

Since no horde of American Student Union
members descended upon the office yesterday
in protest of our reprint of the Palo Alto Times'
lifted eyebrow, I suppose it is my duty to file
the brief for the defense.
The Times objected to the solicitation by the
A.S.U. of relief funds for the Loyalist forces in
Spain. Their reason: that relief funds are just
as much sinews of war as arms and ammunition,
and therefore sending them is a violation in
spirit, if not in fact, of the neutrality legislation.
The problem evokes several speculations
upon policy, personal and public. Immediately
there arises the question: is there such a thing
as neutrality? If so, can it be enforced?
The last time one of the long-haired boys got
out his slide rule, he figured that about 15 per
cent of our national production ever year goes
into exportable commodities. Carrying out the
desire of the Palo Alto Times for complete neu
trality would mean that in the event of a general
European war, predictions for which are run
ning rife on Quai d'Orsay, Downing Street, and
University Avenue, America would have to
sacrifice almost all her production of exportable
commodities. Sinews of war can be broadened
out to mean almost anything under the concept
of complete neutrality. From bullets to copper
to nitrates to cotton to wheat are not very long
or illogical steps. Not only that, but America
v/ould have to forego the ever-present possi
bility of making war profits on both goods and
loans.
Fifteen per cent of the nation's production
may not seem very much, but it would mean
the difference between prosperity and depres
sion, seeing that it is the last 15 per cent of
production on which the Liberty Leaguers
make their money. (You know: fixed cost, var
iable cost, c.o.p. marginal utility, and that stuff.)
I can't see the Palo Alto Times or any other

Republican-progressive newspaper advocating
a neutrality policy that would be a really effec
tive one, when the various interests who would
have to sacrifice their profits and prosperity
started to feel their toes being stepped on. Then
our pressure-group Congress would call off the
dogs (not the ones being stepped on), because
that's all a pressure-group Congress can do. If
you were a Republican-Progressive you might
dream of Congress resisting the Houses of
Morgan, Mellon, and Lemon, but you'd never
see them saying no to the associated and amal
gamated farmers of America, en masse, with
possibly a labor union or two thrown in.
If the United States did create an absolute
neutrality, it would mean that the war could
not last much more than a month (according
to our best crystal gazers), because you cannot
blow up billions of dollars' worth of capital
a day without external financing or supplies,
and the United States is the only one to provide
them. Hitler's recent hysterical attempt to re
strict imports and build up a self-sufficient
state is a case in point, because self-sufficient
states cannot exist without a drastic reduction
in the standard of living to a bare subsistence
level, and the impoverishment of the popula
tion. A policy of complete neutrality for the
United States in the event of a general Euro
pean conflagration would have the same effect,
except for two extenuating circumstances: the
possibility of trade with available neutrals,
whose normal trade with the belligerents would
be cut off, and America's larger relative inde
pendence of the international market.
So we have the paradox that although Amer
ica might be able to shorten the length of a war,
she probably would be the one to prolong it,
because under our pressure-group government
the good of the whole remains subservient to
the relative strength of highly organized parts.
Now The Paly Times has sniffed at our hand
ful of united fronters because they want to send
money to a constitutional government attacked
by unconstitutional foes. Considering the Rus
sian tanks and the Italian shirt-wearers already
in Spain, the effect of Stanford's dollars in in
volving the United States in a war is very doubt
ful. Granting that it is a violation of the real
spirit of neutrality, would the Palo Alto Times,
when the colors are waving and the drums are
rum-tum-tumming, back any measures that
would make neutrality real, complete, or effec
tive? No, of course not, and neither would you.

dream of Congress resisting the Houses of
Morgan, Mellon, and Lemon, but you'd never
see them saying no to the associated and amal
gamated farmers of America, en masse, with
possibly a labor union or two thrown in.
If the United States did create an absolute
neutrality, it would mean that the war could
not last much more than a month (according
to our best crystal gazers), because you cannot
blow up billions of dollars' worth of capital
a day without external financing or supplies,
and the United States is the only one to provide
them. Hitler's recent hysterical attempt to re
strict imports and build up a self-sufficient
state is a case in point, because self-sufficient
states cannot exist without a drastic reduction
in the standard of living to a bare subsistence
level, and the impoverishment of the popula
tion. A policy of complete neutrality for the
United States in the event of a general Euro
pean conflagration would have the same effect,
except for two extenuating circumstances: the
possibility of trade with available neutrals,
whose normal trade with the belligerents would
be cut off, and America's larger relative inde
pendence of the international market.
So we have the paradox that although Amer
ica might be able to shorten the length of a war,
she probably would be the one to prolong it,
because under our pressure-group government
the good of the whole remains subservient to
the relative strength of highly organized parts.
Now The Paly Times has sniffed at our hand
ful of united fronters because they want to send
money to a constitutional government attacked
by unconstitutional foes. Considering the Rus
sian tanks and the Italian shirt-wearers already
in Spain, the effect of Stanford's dollars in in
volving the United States in a war is very doubt
ful. Granting that it is a violation of the real
spirit of neutrality, would the Palo Alto Times,
when the colors are waving and the drums are
rum-tum-tumming, back any measures that
would make neutrality real, complete, or effec
tive? No, of course not, and neither would you.
Since no horde of American Student Union
members descended upon the office yesterday
in protest of our reprint of the Palo Alto Times'
lifted eyebrow, I suppose it is my duty to file
the brief for the defense.
The Times objected to the solicitation by the
A.S.U. of relief funds for the Loyalist forces in
Spain. Their reason: that relief funds are just
as much sinews of war as arms and ammunition,
and therefore sending them is a violation in
spirit, if not in fact, of the neutrality legislation.
The problem evokes several speculations
upon policy, personal and public. Immediately
there arises the question: is there such a thing
as neutrality? If so, can it be enforced?
The last time one of the long-haired boys got
out his slide rule, he figured that about 15 per
cent of our national production ever year goes
into exportable commodities. Carrying out the
desire of the Palo Alto Times for complete neu
trality would mean that in the event of a general
European war, predictions for which are run
ning rife on Quai d'Orsay, Downing Street, and
University Avenue, America would have to
sacrifice almost all her production of exportable
commodities. Sinews of war can be broadened
out to mean almost anything under the concept
of complete neutrality. From bullets to copper
to nitrates to cotton to wheat are not very long
or illogical steps. Not only that, but America
v/ould have to forego the ever-present possi
bility of making war profits on both goods and
loans.
Fifteen per cent of the nation's production
may not seem very much, but it would mean
the difference between prosperity and depres
sion, seeing that it is the last 15 per cent of
production on which the Liberty Leaguers
make their money. (You know: fixed cost, var
iable cost, c.o.p. marginal utility, and that stuff.)
I can't see the Palo Alto Times or any other

Republican-progressive newspaper advocating
a neutrality policy that would be a really effec
tive one, when the various interests who would
have to sacrifice their profits and prosperity
started to feel their toes being stepped on. Then
our pressure-group Congress would call off the
dogs (not the ones being stepped on), because
that's all a pressure-group Congress can do. If
you were a Republican-Progressive you might
dream of Congress resisting the Houses of
Morgan, Mellon, and Lemon, but you'd never
