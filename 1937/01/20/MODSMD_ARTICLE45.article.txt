THE SAD-EYE CINEMA
The name of a course is Graphic Art. (5(5. Lectures
on the Motion Picture. Lec. MWF (Lab. Th 7:30-10 p.m.)
(Mendelowitz, 100) (3) $3.
Now, now, Mr. Mendelowitz!
From what we've heard, if "the name of this tune is
Dinah" the name of your course is Movies. You might
subtitle it: "How Sarah Bernhardt made an ass of her
self in the Assembly hall last night," dhr.
Which is, was, and will henceforth be sacrilege.
The most awful thing is that people are actually en
joying themselves in your class. More awful still, they
laugh at Sarah, at Theda Bara. Imagine, they see
something funny in the old-time stars the University
expects you to turn into Sociological Studies.
But we think it isn't awful. We figure if people
laughed more, there'd be less funny sociology, and more
funny movies.

Last, week, we recollect, the Daily was delicately
stopped from publishing pictures of the "May Irwin,
John C. Rice kiss." (Courtesy United Press).
The objection was: it wouldn't be dignified to make
fun of a course. And in that objection is much of the
reason why scholars tend to be the deadest people on
earth, and the things they teach nothing but embalmed
facts.
Even in this day, when the GulTey Readers have
been turned over to Museums, th& idea persists that if
people enjoy learning anything—if they find an oppor
tunity to laugh, or crack wise—the thing isn't worth
learning or the learners aren't worth teaching.
We can't explain why; perhaps the faculty can.
All we know is—the course on the history of the
motion picture probably bears a more direct relation
to everyday life than any course at Stanford. It may
not be deep, but it is relevant.

And in its relevancy, we think, is the reason for all
this verbal horsing on the sonorously titled "Lectures
on the Motion Picture."
that's just enthusiasm.)
The movie course is the first one students have hit
that directly connects up with a part of their external
environment. The very fact that Sarah and Theda get
the bird is evident that they are making an impression
on the students. I haven't heard a professor get a re
sounding bird in three years.
And don't think for one moment that because they
laugh at the selected movies, they are not being im
pressed with "Sociological Significance."
They are simply taking "Sociological Significance"
in their stride, without becoming unhappy about it.
Which I think is a good object lesson for the sociol
ogists, who arc most unhappy, though they never get
the bird and are never never laughed at —by students.
