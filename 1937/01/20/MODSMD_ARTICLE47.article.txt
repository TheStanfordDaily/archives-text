# CAMPUS OPINION
## CAN SUCH THINGS BE? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I found Professor Hilgard's dis-1
cussion of that old hamburger of i
contention, "Should women work?" |
very interesting, but he neglected to
consider what 1 believe to be a major
aspect of the situation, namely:
The course of a man's life, physio
logically, is a fairly even one from
puberty to senility, while a woman's
is periodically disrupted, with cor
responding emotional disruptions.
I should like to know how, in Mr.
Hilgard's opinion, this periodic dis
turbance affects woman's ability "to
do a man's work."
