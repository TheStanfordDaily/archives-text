# MORBID, NERVOUS, BESTIAL

The Editor, Sir:
This boy Eisenbach and others of
his esoteric ilk give me a pain in
the neck! These sycophants of
swing, cultists of cacaphonous cul
ture, who presumptuously assume
that only jazz is music and the class
ics are, in Mr. Eisenbach's own
words, "garbage," merely make asses
out of themselves in their blind stu
pidity.
(Of course, Eisenbach showed his
individual ignorance in assuming
that Gershwin displayed true jazz
at Saturday's symphony. According
to that noted authority, Curt Pren
dergast, jazz must be improvised, and
Gershwin merely "belabored a
score.")
To deny Bach, Beethoven, and
Brahms for the morbid, nervous
bestiality of jazz is of course ridicu
lous. But I do object to the insinua
tion that symphony audiences are
populated by "plush-bottomed" cul
ture-seekers rather than sincere
lovers of beautiful music.
No doubt there are many poseurs
at symphonies, as at swing concerts
and bull sessions, for the world is
highly populated with them, but the
majority of people at symphonies arc
there because they really like the
stuff.

The Editor, Sir:
We janitors are not aiming to pick
an argument with our foreman, John
Brown, nor with any of our student
friends. However, we want to say
that there is very little truth in the
remarks that Brown has made for
publication. What John Brown has
said about the Union and the work
ing conditions of the janitors is
false.
Some of the students are com
plaining about the janitor service
that they get in their rooms. We
want them to know that it is the
result of the poor management of
foreman John Brown. He not only
gives us more work than we can do
well, which we don't mind as we
work the same number of hours
whether we clean 20 or 40 rooms, but
he employs any Tom, Dick, and
Harry as janitor.
One of the aims of the Union is
to sec that competent janitors are
employed in the future. If the Un
ion is successful, and we have no
doubt that it will be, then you fel
lows who live in the halls will have
no cause to complain. Brown is try
ing to bluff us, and says he will hire
students to take our jobs.
We have more confidence in the
good sense of Stanford students
than he has. No student will will
ingly deprive u.s janitors of our live
lihood by taking over janitorial
work here. No student will willingly
lend a hand in the oppression of or
ganized labor, and brand himself as
a "scab." As the future employers
and business men of America, we
know that you appreciate the role
that labor plays in the modern in
dustrial world better than John
Brown, who has never tried to get
along with us, except to take ad
vantage of us. Our motto is "Live
and Let Live." We feel confident
that you fellows are on our side in
our struggle to secure decent work
ing conditions.
