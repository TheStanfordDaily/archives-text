# MICE AND MENâ€”
## 
### 
Have you ever felt your mouth
water at ihe honeyed description of a
radio announcer when he discusses
the delectable qualities of some mar
velous food that will add pounds to
thin people, take them away from the
stout, add height to the short, give
health to the sick and enable you to
get a ten-dollar a week raise? (If
you could take that sentence in one
breath, have no fear of what is to
come.) Back to mouth watering . . . j
Well, it appears that even mice are
sensitive to the eloquence of NBC
Announcer Ken Carpenter. After
one of his ablest appeals, a mouse
was so carried away that he delib
erately caught himself in a cheese
less trap . . . And a Pennsylvania at
torney swears to it.
