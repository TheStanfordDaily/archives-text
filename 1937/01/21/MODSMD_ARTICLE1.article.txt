# Farm To Raffle For King-Queen
## Convalescent Home Contest Extends Prize to Voter, Eliminates Abuses 
### DAVE LEFF 
Chance will cast the deciding vote in this year's King-Queen contest, |
decided Cardinals last night.
To elect sovereigns for the annual Masque Ball and raise funds for
Stanford's Convalescent Home is the double purpose of the yearly "royal"'
election.
The following procedure, entirely novel, has lieen planned by Cardinals ;
for the coming event to eliminate corruption which has marked the popu- i

Jarity race in past years «
In a primary election, each Stan
ford student may vote for any king
and queen of his choice. This ballot
will be free and general, but voters'
names will be checked off on bawl
out proofs to insure against more
than a single suggestion from cach
student.
Child Picks Ballott
From these preliminary ballots
will be selected the highest ten men
and ten women to run as regular
candidates in the fund-raising elec
tion to follow.
For a nominal price—as for exam
ple ten cents apiece—anyone may
cast as many ballots as he pleases
for one of the ten previously named
king-queen panels. This year, how
ever, voters will sign their names to
each vote.
The day before the Masque Bull,
a child from the Convalescent Home
will, blindfolded, pick one of the
ballots at random. The candidates
named thereon will rule the Ball as
king and queen.
Moreover, the voter who selected
the winning vote will be awarded an
elaborate prize.
Thus, while votes will still be
bought in plumping for a favorite
candidate, chance will govern the
final choosing. The more votes—at
so much per vote —that a living
group or a clique casts for its choice,
the greater mathematical chance will
that male-female combination have
of being chosen blindfolded from a
hat or box by the little child, and,
the more profits will accrue to the
Convalescent Home.
Abuses Cut Out
In the end, however, chance alone ]
will pick the winners and thus fab
ulous cash payments for votes will
be discouraged as well as dubious
practices in soliciting them.
Planned last night by Cardinals as
an air-tight solution to the problem
caused by previous king-queen con
test abuses, the program will lie pre
sented Ex Committee for final ap
proval next week.

out proofs to insure against more
than a single suggestion from cach
student.
Child Picks Ballott
From these preliminary ballots
will be selected the highest ten men
and ten women to run as regular
candidates in the fund-raising elec
tion to follow.
For a nominal price—as for exam
ple ten cents apiece—anyone may
cast as many ballots as he pleases
for one of the ten previously named
king-queen panels. This year, how
ever, voters will sign their names to
each vote.
The day before the Masque Bull,
a child from the Convalescent Home
will, blindfolded, pick one of the
ballots at random. The candidates
named thereon will rule the Ball as
king and queen.
Moreover, the voter who selected
the winning vote will be awarded an
elaborate prize.
Thus, while votes will still be
bought in plumping for a favorite
candidate, chance will govern the
final choosing. The more votes—at
so much per vote —that a living
group or a clique casts for its choice,
the greater mathematical chance will
that male-female combination have
of being chosen blindfolded from a
hat or box by the little child, and,
the more profits will accrue to the
Convalescent Home.
Abuses Cut Out
In the end, however, chance alone ]
will pick the winners and thus fab
ulous cash payments for votes will
be discouraged as well as dubious
practices in soliciting them.
Planned last night by Cardinals as
an air-tight solution to the problem
caused by previous king-queen con
test abuses, the program will lie pre
sented Ex Committee for final ap
proval next week.
