# Designs, Estimates Offered For Nitery
## Committee Awaits Report On New Project 
### 
When Comptroller Almon E. Roth
last quarter disapproved the project
of a social building on the banks of
Lake Lagunita, he spoke of the pro
hibitive expense in terms of live fig
ures.
Recently received by Esther Pel
ton, Ex Committeewoman on the
Nitery subcommittee, was a rough
sketch for such an edifice, with cost
estimated at $8,000.
The plans, drawn up and sub
mitted by Henry Hughes, a student
who has designed an astronomical
observatory as well as pther build
ings, provides for a large central
dance floor as the principal feature.

Jutting off at broad angles on
either side would be a "bar," kitch
cn, dining booths, and a large card
and game room, boasting a fireplace.
Details would include a bandstand,
entrance facade, and veranda. Total
expense was estimated by Ralph C.
Knight, a Mountain View contractor,
at $8,000, which sum specifically in
cludes stucco walls, maple or oak
dance floor, soda fountain, kitchen,
cardroom, and lavatories.
In communicating with Pelton,
Hughes said, "It seems to me that
it will be awfully hard to make a
Union "Nitery' go; privacy and 'ro
mance' are completely lacking in
such a location. The lake offers two
fold day and night accommodation
with boats, parking space, open area
as an attraction."

Hughes further said that his idea
for a lakeside social spot could be
expanded to include a new boat
house. at only nominal additional
expense.
Meanwhile, Ex Committee awaits
the report of Union Board of Gov
ernors concerning renovation of
their lobby by removing partitions.
Pending these findings and a formal
report of Hughes' plan, nothing is
being done about the Nitery.
