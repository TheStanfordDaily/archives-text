# 'Pelleas' Read By Skilled Cast
## 'Melancholy Otherworld' Scene of Poetic Drama 
### HELEN WARSON 
A melancholy other-world peopled
with fleshless people who act and feel
as they do because they are impelled
by a higher force they do not under
stand—this is the setting for Maeter
linck's dreamy "Pelleas and Meli
sande," sensitively interpreted by a
Sword and Sandals cast last night.
A little too "earthly," too "vital"
in the opening scene, Amelia Baines
after that read the part of Melisande
with the dreamy preoccupation, the
child-like innocence the characteri
zation demands.
Arthur Spalding was a sympathetic
Pelleas: his voice is one of the best I
have heard in Sword and Sandals
productions. Splendid was Janet
Dole as the little Ypiold, whose child
ish querelousness contrasts to the
brooding presentiment of the rest of
the characters.
The pace of the poetic drama—un
hurried, deliberate until the climax
of the fourth act when it quickened
with Pelleas's murder, then slowing
again in the final act—was excellent
ly set by Director Brobury Ellis. Ef
fects increased with Debussy's ac
companying music.
