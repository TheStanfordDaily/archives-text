# What Do You Know About Passion?
## 
### 
Love and literature may go on for
ever, but Stanford evidently mixes
the two to their mutual detriment.
The Daily received the following se
ries, of letters with the plea that
readers settle a controversy over the
respective merits, In making your
decision on this printed passion,
judge the letters by the emotion they
arouse—if any.
The Editor, Sir:
My room-mate and I have been
having an argument as to which of
ihe enclosed letters, from our respec
tive one-and-onlies, is the most pas
sionate. We have consulted not a few
"experts" concerning the matter, but
the opinions are as varied as the
experts. We desire a more general
opinion on the subject and wish to
put it up to the men of the campus.
Sincerely,
A Man of Letters

LETTER NO. I
Dear :
I'm in the dumps' and feel like
hell. Gawd—l wish you wore com
ing home for Xmas No doubt sum
pin' drastic has happened to me.
Could it be "absence makes the heart
grow fonder" ? I'm mad at every
one and I want to see you.
I dreamed last night—that I got a
great big, wonderful, long letter

from you and I woke up this morn
ing and expected to read it again—
and I had a fit when it wasn't there.
Gawd, I can't tell you how nice it
would be to scream. Al«o if you say
this letter is slushy—my good man—
you'll be sorry—On account of it
isn't meant to be.
, my sweet, I am honestly
ashamed of myself for not going to
see your mother. Every week-end I
promise myself that I will go, and
then something comes up. I'll do my
best to go this week-end.
I'm not even going to read this
over—'cause if 1 do I know I won't
send it.
Well, here goes nothing.
Much love,
P.S.: Don't forget to write!
P.P.S.: I haven't received a letter
from you yet Best I do!!

LETTER NO. II
Darling:
You'll never know how much your
letter meant to me today. I have
simply Ijoen worried sick since way
before the holidays when you wrote j
I last. Heavens, I've never seen Para
i dise before until I read your letter.
, Why, I'm so happy that ■, ,
I and - — swear I'm in love. That's
I trivial, anyway. I'm sitting on topi

of the world tonight. I felt too good
to eat, to study, or anything. But
if your letters thrilled me always as
that last one, college life would bo
one great sweet dream. I could have
always before me a high level that I
couldn't fail to reach. I have anyway,
but I'm telling you about what your
letter meant to me. I'm not often
sentimental and really mean it, but
tonight I'm so in love with you that
it's pitiful. I've felt lots of different
ways in my lifetime . . .
I've never seen the picture I sent
you, so you see how good I feel. I
really wish you would describe it to
me. Don't exaggerate either, you
I terrible person. You're.good at that.
Tell me if it got to you on Christ-
I mas, and everything.
I'm so happy about your room, you,
everything. I'm so happy with you
that I don't know what to do.
Do you realize that I came to the
library in the ice and cold to study
education, no\ to write to you? And
I'm out of ink anyway.
Love,
| Ed. Nolo.—These letters possess
some of the <|iialities admired by
the two contestants, hut in gen
eral. they seem to fall short of
much contemporary campus abil
ity. Do I hear a second?
