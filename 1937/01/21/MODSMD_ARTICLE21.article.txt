# For Vitalized Talks—Meet Tom Barclay
## 
### 
This short biographical sketch
of Professor Barclay contains ex
cerpts from an article which ap
peared in the very unofficial cam
pus publication, "NEWS," for Oc
tober 23, 19:54. of which Bill Rog
ers, son of the late humorist, was
editor for one issue.—The Editor.

"Stanford's Tom Barclay is indeed
a rare personality, combining the
academic with the dramatic in such
an unusual manner that his classes,
of necessity, have to be limited in
numbers. His proiane expletives,
which are more in the nature of
emphasis, his nervous pacings, his
weird and wild diagrams, the vo
luminous notes which he invariably
casts aside to go off on the fascinat
ing tangent of personal political ex
periences—these are all part of the
man himself.
Teaches Pure Fact
"Professor Barclay's academic in
terest centers in the field of politics
which he teaches per se and not in
theory. One of his favorite quota
tions is, 'Don't get ethics mixed with
politics or you'll get into a hopeless
dilemma,' and his courses are
steeped full of unpublished anec
dotes on contemporary politicians.
"Although a political-science ped
agogue at a number of colleges and
for eight years at Stanford Thomas
Barclay has not limited himself to
the purely academic side. He has
served actively on Democratic party
committees and keeps thoroughly
alive his interest in politics. Political
prognostications by him are held in
high esteem.
"Big Bad Wolf"
"His local reputation? At the
Union Cellar he is generally looked
upon as the Big Bad Wolf. He enters
briskly, deposits his rotund self on
a stool, paper open to the .sports
page, and barks out his order. In
the kitchen all other activity is sus
pended during the preparation of
his order, which invariably bounces
back at least once with gentlemanly
imprecations attached. In class he
is more popular, though no more
amiable."
