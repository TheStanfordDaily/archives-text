## 
### 
I rofessor 1 lioinas S. Barclay ni the political science
department, who has just returned from a 13-inonth
• r;p, during which he studied and observed political
trends in many parts of the United Stales, made the
following comment last night upon President Roose
velt's inaugural address:
"Mr. Roosevelt's second inaugural address reflected,
in general terms, his basic political and economic phi
losophy. In domestic policies, he remains essentially a
♦ follower ol two of his most dis-

tinguished predecessors, Theodore
Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Thut is to say, he reveals a deep
suspicion and dislike of what is
frequently called Big Business and a
fixed determination further to regu
late and to control its activities and
its conduct.
"Many important laws parsed dur
ing his first administration were of
a reform or regulatory character,
and I anticipate a strengthening of
these statutes where needed, with
the enactment of such additional
ones as may by him be deemed nec
essary in the public interest.
Conservation Enthusiast
He also makes clear his intention
to provide, chiefly by national au
thority, a reasonable degree of se
curity and decency of life for large
underprivileged groups. The Presi
dent is almost passionately devoted
to a program of conservation of the
land, water, and other national re
sources.
"I sincerely trust he realizes that
the government of the United States
must be a solvent and well-admin
istered government in order that the
large tax returns derived from the
various sources be sufficient to meet
the enormous expenses of the
budget.
I'lasts Dictatorships
In foreign affairs, the President
recognizes the dangers which our
democracy, and all other democra
cies, now face in the struggles to
hold their place against the furious
and brutal power of the dictatorships
of the world. Every effort will be
made to keep the United States from
participation in any European war.
The preservation of the democratic
ideal is the cornerstone of his foreign
policy.
"Mr. Roosevelt, in his second term,
will profit by the mistakes of the
first four years of realistic' expe
rience. I believe he will endeavor to
hold fast the middle way' and to
keep the nation at peace."
