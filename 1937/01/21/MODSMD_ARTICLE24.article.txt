# German Films On Program Tonight
## 
### 
Students of the graphic art depart
ment's "History of the Motion Pic
ture" will be introduced to "The Ger
man Influence" tonight in the As
sembly Hall. The films to be used to
show this influence are "Hands" and
"Sunrise."
As German films have influenced
the trends of American cinematog
raphy, and as many Germans, such
as Ernest Lubitsch, Emil Jannings,
and Von Strohcim have made names
for themselves in directing and act
ing in American pictures, the Ger
man influence has become a part of
the history of motion pictures.
In the cast of "Sunrise" appear
such well known present day players
as George O'Brien and Janet Gay
nor. It made its first debut in 1927.
