### JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE 
The Sun Francisco police were
playing Dick Tracy a few days ago.
They went down to a garage to in
vestigate a reported disturbance and
found a young man fighting with his
stepfather about a broken window.
While they were arresting the boy,
he started pushing the representa
tives of the law around, so they tap
ped him on the head with their
night-sticks. But since the youth had
"the thinnest skull they ever saw,"
the police accidentally killed him.
This recalls another instance along
the same line. It happened several
years ago. The San Francisco police
at one of the branch stations had a
young man at the desk being booked
for a charge something less than
murder or assault with a deadly
weapon. As they started questioning
him, the oulprit broke away and ran
out and down the street. The police
chased after him, yelling for him to
stop in the name of the law, but he
didn't and they shot him dead.

Of course, any person who is hav
ing a blow-in with the police of a
small town for failing to stop and let
the pedestrians amble across the
street, will think at the time that the
law operates solely for the discomfit
ure of the taxpayers, but the Com
munists have a heavier complaint
with the recognized forces of author
ity. They point to Tom Mooney
growing famous in a San Quentin
cell, Sacco and Vanzetti supposedly
murdered by a capitalistic frame-up,
and two striking longshoremen killed
by the police in the 1934 San Fran
cisco waterfront strike.
As for Mooney, 1 am unable to
raise any sympathy. I was too young
when Sacco and Vanzetti were exe
cuted to form any definite opinion
about them, although I do vaguely
recall reading in the papers that some
radical groups claimed the world
revolution was going to start the
minute the executioner pulled the
switch, but for some strange reason
the radicals were wrong inasmuch as
the predicted revolution is somewhat
overdue at this late date. And as for
the striking longshoreman whose
bodies were carried with great fan

fare up Market Street, I daresay the
police were very, very harassed be
fore tl»ey started firing. After all, the
pickets were no lilies and they be
came most conspicuously courageous
when outnumbering some scab 50
to 1.
The Communists, it seems, are
barking up the wrong tree when they
malign the police and the army per
sonally for being traitors to the rights
of man. Policemen are only doing in
a blundering way what they are paid
to do, and the National Guard that is
called out for labor riots is composed
largely of scared young boys whose
guns are loaded with weak ammuni
tion so they will not accidentally miss
a striker on the San Francisco water
front and kill somebody across the
bay in Berkeley, as they would do
with the regular high-powered am
munition.
* * *
But the Dick Tracy shoot-'em-up
dead philosophy has grasped the
country a little too dangerously, what
with everybody thinking that the
best way to rid the country of minor
lawbreakers is to make every man a
Post-Toastie G-rnan by mail, with a
sub-machine gun and a badge and
everything, and let everybody shoot
suspicious characters on sight. The
only trouble with this is that the
amount of a city's crime is directly
proportional to such things as slums
and exploitation and inversely pro
portional to the number of public
playgrounds the city operates, and
not at all correlated with how many
outstanding Dillingers and Pretty
Boy Floyds the G-men kill.
And for another thing, the in
creasing tendency to use the police as
Cossacks for the benefit of small
privileged groups makes it look as if
the pinks and reds, for all their snif
ing at the wrong tree, are at least in
the right forest.
