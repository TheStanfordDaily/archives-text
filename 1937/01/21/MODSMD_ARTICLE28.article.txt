# Athletic Club Plan Proposed For Graduates
## Reynolds Suggests New Moderate Membership Fees to Farm Alumni 
### 
Stanford graduates who cannot af
ford the large initiation fees and
dues of athletic clubs in their home
towns were given new hope yester
day as A.S.S.U. President Jim Rey
! nolds announced the broadening of
his plan for a special reduction of
rates.
Jonathan Club Agrees
The Jonathan Club in Los Angeles
' has already agreed to a plan whereby
j young graduates who cannot afford a
; large initiation fee will be able to
' use the facilities of the club for $5
| a month or less.
A system such as this could be ar
ranged in many clubs, Reynolds said,
if the students would take advantage
of their opportunities. The Univer
sity Club in Los Angeles has been
questioned on the plan and seems in
favor of it. These memberships will
be limited to the number that the
club can accommodate conveniently.
Active Use of Clubs
Many athletic clubs have unfilled
| membership and unused athletic
[ equipment. There will be more ac-
I tive use of the clubs if the younger
1 college graduates can join on a re
| stricted basis. The following is the
i resolution adopted by the Jonathan
Club at the suggestion of Jim Rey
-1 nolds:
i "Resolved, that a new membership
I classification be formed to be known
! as an ASSOCIATE JUNIOR MEM
BERSHIP. College Graduates, with
the proper recommendation of two
members in good standing, one of
whom will vouch for his credit
(which may be limited by said mem
ber), may apply for this type of
1 membership, provided he files appli
cation within one year following the
date of his graduation. Graduates,
' during the year 1936, will be eligible
j under this arrangement up to July 1,
j 1937.
Reasonable Dues
"The dues for an Associate Junior
; Member shall be Two Dollars per
j month for the first year; Three Dol
i lars per month for the second year;
! Four Dollars a month for the third
j year; and the fourth year they will
; become regular Junior Members of
j the club at the rate of Five Dollars a
| month, provided they are still under
30."
At a meeting of the Pacific Student
President's Association later this
i year, Reynolds will lay the whole
I plan before the assembly. If all the
colleges who send representatives to
the meetings agree, each can bring
the plan to the attention of various
I clubs near his own school.

j young graduates who cannot afford a
; large initiation fee will be able to
' use the facilities of the club for $5
| a month or less.
A system such as this could be ar
ranged in many clubs, Reynolds said,
if the students would take advantage
of their opportunities. The Univer
sity Club in Los Angeles has been
questioned on the plan and seems in
favor of it. These memberships will
be limited to the number that the
club can accommodate conveniently.
Active Use of Clubs
Many athletic clubs have unfilled
| membership and unused athletic
[ equipment. There will be more ac-
I tive use of the clubs if the younger
1 college graduates can join on a re
| stricted basis. The following is the
i resolution adopted by the Jonathan
Club at the suggestion of Jim Rey
-1 nolds:
i "Resolved, that a new membership
I classification be formed to be known
! as an ASSOCIATE JUNIOR MEM
BERSHIP. College Graduates, with
the proper recommendation of two
members in good standing, one of
whom will vouch for his credit
(which may be limited by said mem
ber), may apply for this type of
1 membership, provided he files appli
cation within one year following the
date of his graduation. Graduates,
' during the year 1936, will be eligible
j under this arrangement up to July 1,
j 1937.
Reasonable Dues
"The dues for an Associate Junior
; Member shall be Two Dollars per
j month for the first year; Three Dol
i lars per month for the second year;
! Four Dollars a month for the third
j year; and the fourth year they will
; become regular Junior Members of
j the club at the rate of Five Dollars a
| month, provided they are still under
30."
At a meeting of the Pacific Student
President's Association later this
i year, Reynolds will lay the whole
I plan before the assembly. If all the
colleges who send representatives to
the meetings agree, each can bring
the plan to the attention of various
I clubs near his own school.
Stanford graduates who cannot af
ford the large initiation fees and
dues of athletic clubs in their home
towns were given new hope yester
day as A.S.S.U. President Jim Rey
! nolds announced the broadening of
his plan for a special reduction of
rates.
