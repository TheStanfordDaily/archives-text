# Here's Light Brighter Than Sol Himself
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Light more intense than that of
the sun was produced yesterday from
a lamp less than half an inch long.
The demonstration took place before
Professor P. A. Ross's class in light
and sound, Physics 37.
Invented by Cornelis 801, research
associate in physics at Stanford, the
light uses a current passed through
mercury vapor. Four to seven thou
sand candlepower can be produced
by each centimeter of mercury vapor.
Water Cooled
Since the quartz tube which houses
the mercury develops a temperature
of over 14,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
Dr. 80l uses a water jacket to cool
the system.
The fact of this cooling is one of
the light's valuable assets. Professor
80l expects that it will come into
general use in the making of motion
pictures, since the heat of the present
floodlights is one of the problems of
modern picture production.
Dr. 80l has been working on his
invention for the past three years.
Before coming to Stanford, he was
research man for Phillips' Works,

Dutch electrical company. Dr. 80l
was one of those who developed the
yellow sodium vapor lamps used on
the bay bridge.
Future development of the light
will consist largely in stepping up
(he candlepower. The chief obstruc
tion to this is the terrific pressure de
veloped by the mercury vaporâ€”4soo
pounds to the square inch in the one
demonstrated yesterday.
G.E. Patent
Dr. 80l plans to handle higher
pressures by operating the lamp
within a heavy housing that has a
quartz window. This steel housing
will keep the mercury tube under a
pressure of 15,000 pounds per square
inch.
Searchlights and floodlights for
landing fields are other possible uses
for the new light. General Electric
holds American patent rights, and
European rights are held by Phillips'
Works.
