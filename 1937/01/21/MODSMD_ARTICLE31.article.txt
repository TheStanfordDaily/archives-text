# Local A.S.U. Pushes Drive To Aid Spain
## Will Campaign for Funds To Relieve Loyalists In Spite of Criticism 
### 
Despite editorial criticisms in the
Palo Alto Times, the Stanford chap
ter of the American Student Union
has announced that it is going ahead
with plans to raise funds for "the
relief of the Spanish people."
In a recent editorial, reprinted in
the Daily, titled "Disloyal to U.S.
Aims," the Times said that the
A.S.U.'s campaign was a violation of
recent neutrality legislation and that
the sending of relief to either the
Loyalist or Fascist forces in Spain
"would be a step upon which we
might be climbing into a military
participation later on."
Would Aid Loyalists
According to Ralph Stotsky, chair
man of the A.S.U.-sponsored "Stan
ford Committee for the Relief of
the Spanish People" and director of
the fund-raising campaign, "the Stu
dent Union wants to aid the war
ravaged Spanish people.
"We will send aid to the Loyalist
government, because it was elected
democratically last February by the
vast majority of the people.''
Refutes Criticism
Stotsky denied charges of the Palo
Alto Times that funds would be
used for "sinews of war." "All funds
raised," he said, "will be used for
food, clothing, medical aid, and the
evacuation of civilians from war
areas." "Our whole aim," Stotsky
concluded, "is entirely consistent
with humanitarian ideals."
The A.S.U. is organizing its forces
and will start the fund-raising cam
paign at once, according to its an
nouncement. They are planning to
send the money to Spain through the
North American Committee to Aid
Spanish Democracy, a New York
City organization.
