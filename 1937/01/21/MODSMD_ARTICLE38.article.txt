# Indian Nine Wins Season Opener Here
## 
### ART ALLEN 
Stanford got off to a winning start
on another season yesterday as
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base
ball team defeated the Moffett Field
team from Sunnyvale Airbase, 5-4,
in a six-inning contest, abbreviated
by cold and darkness.
The local team turned four hits
and several walks into five runs
and committed only one fielding
error, showing general improvement
over last season. Of the four play
ers who pitched for Stanford, Paine
was the most impressive, fanning
four in the two innings he worked.
Holman on first base, Tam on third,
and Calvelli and McGuire in the out
field played good games.
Stanford opened the scoring in the
first by virtue of McGuire's walk,
Calvelli's torrid blow through sec
ond, a force out, an error, and a wild
pitch, netting two runs. The gov
ernment boys tied the score in their
half of the second with three hits,
but Stanford went two in front again
in their half of the inning on three
walks and Calvelli's Texas Leaguer.
In the last of the fifth Heagerty
singled and was forced home by
three more walks, giving the local
nine a 5-2 lead. With Griffin on the
mound two walks and Linde's error
on a throw to second gave Moffett

Field its third run.
Catcher Coffis permitted the next
pitch to roll to the grandstand and
run number four came in, but he
recovered the ball just in time to
nip the remaining base-runner at
the plate, ending the game.
