# Light Workout Trains Cards For Cal Game
## Varsity Practices Passing, 'Held Ball' Play; Team To Take Bears in Stride 
### WALT PETERSON 
With the main part of the offense j
plans smoothed out and ready to roll
against the Bears Friday night at
Berkeley, Coach John Bunn worked
the varsity hoop team through a se
ries of less important factors in bas
ketball offense yesterday, including
out-of-bounds plays, held ball plays,
and passing.
The team as a whole is all set to go
in this â€” just another conference
game to them that Will not be as
much to be feared as the first games
with Southern Cal a week hence.
This afternoon the players will work
again as they did last night, cleaning
up the loose ends with practice that
emphasizes finesse rather than
strategy.
Always a handy trick to have
around, the well planned out-of
bounds play is one that frequently
pays off in goals. Two years ago in
one of the Cal games the Bunn-men
pulled that fast one under the bas
ket, where Luisetti steps up to take
the ball from Turner in Alphone-
Gaston style only to put it through
the hoop, not once but thx-ee times,
while the Bears stand around like a
bunch of gawks and wonder how it
happened.
The same stunt was pulled just
once against U.C.L.A.,' when, with
Handsome Howie standing out of the
court with the ball, the magnificent
Italian said, "Here, Howie, let me
throw it in." Bruin John Ball let
Henry Angelo step in front of him
and woke up to what was going on
when Luisetti was half way upward
on his leap to score. It paid off with
two points, besides being horribly
disconcerting to Mr. Ball.
The cagers wind up this week's
practice tonight in fine psychological
fettle, too, not being at all bothered
by the ranting and roaring of their
East-Bay cousins. Still unconvinced
that he is not so unethical as the
Daily painted him Tursday is the
lanky Luisetti, who got quite a kick
out of his alleged elbow-pinning tac
tics deplored by that journal.
