"63-30." "63-3«!"
You've all noticed how often people
are saying, "They're not perfect. Re
member that 63-30 game against Cal
last year?" With the former confer
ence and Cal series scoring record
against them, Stanford must have
had a bunch of pikers for a basket
ball team last year, and they've got
the same bunch back! Right?
No.
There's no reason for crying about
the game, or saying it wasn't earned,
or any other classification of year-old
moaning, but I'd simply like to tell
those that weren't there what hap
pened, if they're interested.
Stanford was leading the Confer
ence, slightly, when we went over
there, but the boys had already split
two with Cal, showing that there
wasn't a great deal of difference be
tween the two teams. Cal, using the
"guard control" style of play as they
call it, did some good shooting early
in the first period and got themselves
a lead, about 12 points.
Stanford began to press and tight
en up, as they needed this game, and
were playing to win. As a result,
their shots didn't swish, and Califor
nia constantly kept pouring them
through.
In the second half, though, came
the real story. Stanford began fran
tically* to deploy all over the court
each time they got the ball after a
Berkeley score, and Luisetti was sel
dom on his own side of the center
line. The only way to cut down that
lead was to score a lot of points!
The result was pitiful. With a
three-or four-man Stanford defense,
California scored nearly every time
her guards got their hands on the
ball. And with the play under
Berkeley's basket about even, they
got their hands on it about 50 per
cent of the time.
CALIFORNIA'S FORECAST
Let me quote Bob Wesson, sport
ed of the Daily Cal. With reference

to the case of U. of C. vs. John Bunn,'
" 'When a man yells before he's hurt, ,
he's usually afraid'. . . . 'poppingj
off' . . . odds on Friday's clash be- '
tween Bears and Indians are hardly ;
to be justified . . . Stanford is a j
slight favorite, and will probably be 1
even money to split at game time:
Friday ..." ;
"I pick the Bears ... In every \
game ot date Stanford has met a
team which would play their type of j
game. The Indians are sent down
into the opponent's half of the court j
to hurry the guards bringing up the
ball . . . the Indians could outspeed J
their opponents and eventually in
tercept the ball ... If the oppon- !
ents attempted long shots, Jack Cal
derwood, Stanford's most underrated j
guard, would take it off the back
board . . .
"Hank Luisetti would remain close
to the . . . sideline . . . and be free J
ft,r a shot with the defense either j
trailing behind or having been 'hip- i
pod' aside by the versatile Italian.!
(Incidentally, watch Luisetti pin his!
opponent to his side with his elbow |
while dribbling around the helpless
guard . . .)"
Watch that "yelling before you're
hurt," Bob. To continue: '"But if the;
Bears refuse to play that type of
game Stanford will be forced to come :
tc the Bears. And the defense which j
hold U.S.C. to nine field goals Satur- '
day isn't going to be any pushover j
for a bunch of good shots who don't
work together.
"If the Bears absolutely refuse to!
be hurried, take their time in getting j
the ball down, and shoot only at good j
chances, they will beat Stanford." i
Well, how's it sound? See what!
kind of a game it's going to be, and •
what you're going to miss if you stay
home?
It may be fast at times, and it will I
be slow, but there never will be any j
doubt but what all ten players have ;
unswerving eyes glued on the vie- I
tory. —Klauber
