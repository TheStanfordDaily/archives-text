# A 						University

### 
"What do you think I'm running here, a night
club or a University?"
That is the question that was asked when a
student approached the Administration last
quarter concerning some Nitery problems. It
is a question that will continue to be asked as
long as the Nitery problem comes up. And the
Nitery problem will keep coming up, in one
form or another, as long as its basic causes
remain.
And the basic causes will remain.
No, Stanford is not running a night club.
Nor would it be, if it ran a Nitery. But it is run
ning a University. And a University is more
or less responsible for educating the students
entrusted to its care. I have listened to one of
the men high in authority in the Administra
tion expound the philosophy that what the stu
dents learn in books at Stanford is a negligible
part of their total education, and I think he's
right. And I've heard one man even higher
plead with students to stay on the campus and
not patronize the "starving hotel-keepers in the
City," and I think he's got a point there.
And yet, just exactly what have any of the
administrators got to offer to hold students on
the campus after 6 o'clock Friday and Saturday
nights? We have our sporadic campus dra
matic productions at top prices, our occasional
campus direct action, mass-endeavor dancing
in the women's gym, for which the price of the
bids is as unattractive as the dance chairmen's
invariable decorations, and the various dances
thrown by the living groups and catering to the
select few (viz: Sequoia Barn Dance).
in what kind of an environment are we edu
cating students, when a part of that environ
ment includes the crowded, lousy dance floors
of the City every Friday and Saturday nights,
or an equally lousy if not as crowded floor of
some highway joint, or the debilitating cinema
in Palo Alto?
Figures compiled by The Daily on an up
and-doing week-end fall quarter showed that
less than a third of Stanford men dated. Other
figures compiled by The Daily showed that one
third of the campus owned cars. There need
not be any correlation between these tv/o fig
ures, but they stand to reason, when it is con
sidered that most of the entertainment provided
is off-campus.
Instead of pleading with the students to stay
on the campus you would think that the Uni
versity would break its neck to entice them on
the campus. Maybe students did not dance in
the old days, when they had church socials and
a game of spin the platter out behind the barn
every night, maybe they could get acquainted
and have their fun without dancing, but the
fact is that now they don't speak that'language,
and the University if it wants to talk turkey will
have to talk as the turkeys talk.
You would think that the University, if it
thought things through, would consider that
one of its functions is to provide a place on the
campus that would not only provide for the two
thirds of the students not within the inner circle,
but also would lure the inner circle. This, the
Old Union social rooms can never do. The
Lagunita Nitery, on the other hand, with its
natural appeal has the possibility, if enough
people got excited about it.

is a question that will continue to be asked as
long as the Nitery problem comes up. And the
Nitery problem will keep coming up, in one
form or another, as long as its basic causes
remain.
And the basic causes will remain.
No, Stanford is not running a night club.
Nor would it be, if it ran a Nitery. But it is run
ning a University. And a University is more
or less responsible for educating the students
entrusted to its care. I have listened to one of
the men high in authority in the Administra
tion expound the philosophy that what the stu
dents learn in books at Stanford is a negligible
part of their total education, and I think he's
right. And I've heard one man even higher
plead with students to stay on the campus and
not patronize the "starving hotel-keepers in the
City," and I think he's got a point there.
And yet, just exactly what have any of the
administrators got to offer to hold students on
the campus after 6 o'clock Friday and Saturday
nights? We have our sporadic campus dra
matic productions at top prices, our occasional
campus direct action, mass-endeavor dancing
in the women's gym, for which the price of the
bids is as unattractive as the dance chairmen's
invariable decorations, and the various dances
thrown by the living groups and catering to the
select few (viz: Sequoia Barn Dance).
in what kind of an environment are we edu
cating students, when a part of that environ
ment includes the crowded, lousy dance floors
of the City every Friday and Saturday nights,
or an equally lousy if not as crowded floor of
some highway joint, or the debilitating cinema
in Palo Alto?
Figures compiled by The Daily on an up
and-doing week-end fall quarter showed that
less than a third of Stanford men dated. Other
figures compiled by The Daily showed that one
third of the campus owned cars. There need
not be any correlation between these tv/o fig
ures, but they stand to reason, when it is con
sidered that most of the entertainment provided
is off-campus.
Instead of pleading with the students to stay
on the campus you would think that the Uni
versity would break its neck to entice them on
the campus. Maybe students did not dance in
the old days, when they had church socials and
a game of spin the platter out behind the barn
every night, maybe they could get acquainted
and have their fun without dancing, but the
fact is that now they don't speak that'language,
and the University if it wants to talk turkey will
have to talk as the turkeys talk.
You would think that the University, if it
thought things through, would consider that
one of its functions is to provide a place on the
campus that would not only provide for the two
thirds of the students not within the inner circle,
but also would lure the inner circle. This, the
Old Union social rooms can never do. The
Lagunita Nitery, on the other hand, with its
natural appeal has the possibility, if enough
people got excited about it.
"What do you think I'm running here, a night
club or a University?"
That is the question that was asked when a
student approached the Administration last
quarter concerning some Nitery problems. It
is a question that will continue to be asked as
