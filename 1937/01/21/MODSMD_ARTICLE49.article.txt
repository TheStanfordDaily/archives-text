The Daily Cal thinks Stanford is "Screaming
lor Help" according to the first line of Tuesday's
edtiorial column. But that isn't all—
"In the best tradition of the highly elastic
Stanford 'gentlemen,' Bunn screams louder in
victory than in defeat. This is very effective,
since the defeated coach cannot scream back
at the risk of being accused of poor sports
manship . . editorializes The Monarch of the
Dailies.
"That U.C.L.A. team looked just like Califor
nia tonight—worse in fact, if that's possible,"
screamed Bunn. But he did not stop there . . .
"To use roughness in one game as an excuse
for a tirade against the next team on the sched
ule is a method which has been a stranger to
Coast basketball in the past. To seize the same
opportunity for offensive personalities is prob
ably unprecedented in any conference . . .
"Bunn's ultimate purpose seems to have been
to provide himself with a ready made oppor
tunity for a similar oration Friday when Stan
ford and California play the first game of the
1937 series. The oration will be forthcoming
whether Stanford wins or loses.
"At any rate, the California team will not take
the slap in the face quietly. Bunn, who believes

that he is at the top of the heap and can there
fore scream at will, may find that he has
screamed himself out of a conference title."
The Stanford Daily is under the impression
that Coach Nibs Price of California does not like
the Stanford team, does not like the U.S.C. team,
or the Southern referees. We also are under the
impression that Coach Price makes loud, rasp
ing noises when he drinks soup, laughs at
dirty jokes, and behaves himself like no gentle
man, but like a basketball coach.
