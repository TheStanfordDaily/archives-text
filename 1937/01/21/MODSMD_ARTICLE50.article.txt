—NOW THAT MUSIC
We pause today in our assault on Stanford's wind
mills to assault the wind—particularly that wind blow
ing so freely and fragrantly through the teeth of one
Mr. Prendergast and one Mr. Bernheim.
When we hear it, we are convinced that Stanford
will not peacefully turn to dust, but will be blown
down.
Yesterday both these gentlemen donned their berets
and pushed their middle valves down. The music, that
of Bach and Beethoven as well as of Dorsey and Gersh
win, went down and around and come out bellying
the Daily's sails.
♦ * <t *
Mr. Bernheim we can dismiss as a zephyr among
monsoons. His big handicap is his inability to read. In
the event that he has learned how since Monday, I will
explain that the "Three B's" (Bach, Beethoven and
Brahms, not Bernheim, Bemhard and Birnbaum), are
household words where I come from (12 Palm Ave.,
Larkspur).
While we have "garbage," too (collected semi
weekly), it is kept strictly on the back porch. Really,
the "B's" and "G's" are never mixed at our house, even
though they form a chemical union within Bernheim
and others of his four-syllable ilk at the San Francisco
Opera House.
Lest we be misunderstood, when we refer to gar
bage, we refer to Bernheim and Prendergast's esoteric
beliefs, not to Bernheim as a cultural specie, nor to
Prendergast as a phyla, nor to the music they criticize.
* * * *
Sticking with me is Bernheim's comment during an
intermission of the Gershwin concert, in which he de
clared the show was "swell."
Naturally, Bernheim was thinking on his feet, as it
were. When he thought sitting down, as it were, he de
cided the concert was shoddy, and second-hand shoddy,
at that.
Simply because I seldom think either sitting or
standing, never when lying clown, I liked the concert.
And I saw no reason to be windy about it. A slight
draft seemed sufficient.
* * s|< *
As for Prendergast, he damns Gershwin because he
stole clarinet tweets from Ted Lewis and construction
from Paganini, just as Orpheus stole music from a
bird, and I steal the bird from Orpheus to give it to
Prendergast.
Moreover, Gershwin, continues Curt, is "a mixture
of the ridiculous and the sublime to produce the
phony."
* * sjt *
The analogy is irresistible. Sour Gripes is a mixture
of much Prendergast and little Westbrook Pegler;
Bernheim a solution of much exhaust fumes and a little
knowledge; Bull Session a compound of little Eiscn
bach, much Old Overholt.
. . . all mixtures of the phony and sublime to pro
duce the ridiculous.

Larkspur).
While we have "garbage," too (collected semi
weekly), it is kept strictly on the back porch. Really,
the "B's" and "G's" are never mixed at our house, even
though they form a chemical union within Bernheim
and others of his four-syllable ilk at the San Francisco
Opera House.
Lest we be misunderstood, when we refer to gar
bage, we refer to Bernheim and Prendergast's esoteric
beliefs, not to Bernheim as a cultural specie, nor to
Prendergast as a phyla, nor to the music they criticize.

Sticking with me is Bernheim's comment during an
intermission of the Gershwin concert, in which he de
clared the show was "swell."
Naturally, Bernheim was thinking on his feet, as it
were. When he thought sitting down, as it were, he de
cided the concert was shoddy, and second-hand shoddy,
at that.
Simply because I seldom think either sitting or
standing, never when lying clown, I liked the concert.
And I saw no reason to be windy about it. A slight
draft seemed sufficient.

As for Prendergast, he damns Gershwin because he
stole clarinet tweets from Ted Lewis and construction
from Paganini, just as Orpheus stole music from a
bird, and I steal the bird from Orpheus to give it to
Prendergast.
Moreover, Gershwin, continues Curt, is "a mixture
of the ridiculous and the sublime to produce the
phony."
* * sjt *
The analogy is irresistible. Sour Gripes is a mixture
of much Prendergast and little Westbrook Pegler;
Bernheim a solution of much exhaust fumes and a little
knowledge; Bull Session a compound of little Eiscn
bach, much Old Overholt.
. . . all mixtures of the phony and sublime to pro
duce the ridiculous.

—NOW THAT MUSIC
We pause today in our assault on Stanford's wind
mills to assault the wind—particularly that wind blow
ing so freely and fragrantly through the teeth of one
Mr. Prendergast and one Mr. Bernheim.
When we hear it, we are convinced that Stanford
will not peacefully turn to dust, but will be blown
down.
Yesterday both these gentlemen donned their berets
and pushed their middle valves down. The music, that
of Bach and Beethoven as well as of Dorsey and Gersh
win, went down and around and come out bellying
the Daily's sails.

Mr. Bernheim we can dismiss as a zephyr among
monsoons. His big handicap is his inability to read. In
the event that he has learned how since Monday, I will
explain that the "Three B's" (Bach, Beethoven and
Brahms, not Bernheim, Bemhard and Birnbaum), are
household words where I come from (12 Palm Ave.,
Larkspur).
While we have "garbage," too (collected semi
weekly), it is kept strictly on the back porch. Really,
the "B's" and "G's" are never mixed at our house, even
