# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
Since Campus Opinion has burst into flame on the
hitherto neglected matter of letters from the gal back
home, Our Hasher can only follow along in the wake of
such events of great sociological significance. We who
are immersed in this busy swirl of college life do not
realize that there is much history being written, many
world-shaking marches and counter-marches taking
place in the mails. Following out Our Hasher's policy
of attempting to present the complete picture of the
well rounded and whole man, I record a conversation
that kept rattling around my subconscious and uncon
scious while trying to go to sleep the other night.
Paul, the Play-boy: Ward, the Woman-killer; and
Lou, the Lovesick, gathered on the other side of the
partition to write a letter home to Lou's latest inspira
tion.
"Let's see," said the Playboy, "start it out: 'Dearest
Darling: Every moment since I left you has been an
agony'."
"No," said Lovesick, "that don't go. I just met the
gal Saturday night. That's putting it on too thick.
You know, I don't want to come right out, I just want
to imply it."
"No, sir," said the Playboy. "None of this implying
stuff. You've got to lay your cards out on the table.
That's the way I work it. You've got to get serious
with these babes before they'll get serious with you.
I start out being serious right away on the first date.
It works like a charm.
"Start out with just 'Darling' or 'Dearest,' something
simple, not too flashy, but it catches the eye. Then say,
'Ever since Saturday night, every moment has been full
of happiness, because in every moment I've been
thinking of you."
"No, you don't understand, I LOVE the girl. This
letter's got to be smooth. It's gotta be four pages of
smoothness."
"How long?" asked the Woman-killer, "Four pages?
That ought to be easy. I write eight pages to my
gal every day."
"Eight pages!" Lovesick was startled.
"Well," hastily added the Woman-killer, "it really
isn't smooth, you know."
"How dya do it?" asked the Playboy.
"Oh. I don't know," said the Woman-killer. "I just
write what I feel. We've been going together for four
years now, and every time I hear a song over the radio,
or walk down the street it starts me thinkin', so I just
write along about that."
"Gosh!" said P and L.
"Say," snapped the Playboy. "I've got a swell way
to end your letter, Lou. It really gets 'em. Wait a min
ute, I'll read it to you from my gal's last letter. Now,
get this. Lissen to it: "Sweet dreams, darling, I love
you."
"Gee!" said L and W.
"But how'm I going to start it?" asked Lovesick.
"Well, what's her name?" probed the Playboy.
"Dora," gasped Lou.
"Well, how about, 'Dora, dear'?"
"Now. listen, this gotta be smooth. I can't butch it
I LOVE the gal."
" 'Dora, dear,' is just the same as Dear Dora?"
"Well, 1 don't know, 'Dear Mr. Brown' isn't the
same as Mr. Brown, dear.' And this has gotta be smooth.
You know that. I LOVE the gal.
At this moment, Our Hasher grasped his pillow
firmly in both hands, muttered: "Sweet dreams, darling,
I love you," and swooned into ecstatic slumber.

"But how'm I going to start it?" asked Lovesick.
"Well, what's her name?" probed the Playboy.
"Dora," gasped Lou.
"Well, how about, 'Dora, dear'?"
"Now. listen, this gotta be smooth. I can't butch it
I LOVE the gal."
" 'Dora, dear,' is just the same as Dear Dora?"
"Well, 1 don't know, 'Dear Mr. Brown' isn't the
same as Mr. Brown, dear.' And this has gotta be smooth.
You know that. I LOVE the gal.
At this moment, Our Hasher grasped his pillow
firmly in both hands, muttered: "Sweet dreams, darling,
I love you," and swooned into ecstatic slumber.
Since Campus Opinion has burst into flame on the
hitherto neglected matter of letters from the gal back
home, Our Hasher can only follow along in the wake of
such events of great sociological significance. We who
are immersed in this busy swirl of college life do not
realize that there is much history being written, many
world-shaking marches and counter-marches taking
place in the mails. Following out Our Hasher's policy
of attempting to present the complete picture of the
well rounded and whole man, I record a conversation
that kept rattling around my subconscious and uncon
scious while trying to go to sleep the other night.
Paul, the Play-boy: Ward, the Woman-killer; and
Lou, the Lovesick, gathered on the other side of the
partition to write a letter home to Lou's latest inspira
tion.
"Let's see," said the Playboy, "start it out: 'Dearest
Darling: Every moment since I left you has been an
agony'."
"No," said Lovesick, "that don't go. I just met the
gal Saturday night. That's putting it on too thick.
You know, I don't want to come right out, I just want
to imply it."
"No, sir," said the Playboy. "None of this implying
stuff. You've got to lay your cards out on the table.
That's the way I work it. You've got to get serious
with these babes before they'll get serious with you.
I start out being serious right away on the first date.
It works like a charm.
"Start out with just 'Darling' or 'Dearest,' something
simple, not too flashy, but it catches the eye. Then say,
'Ever since Saturday night, every moment has been full
of happiness, because in every moment I've been
thinking of you."
"No, you don't understand, I LOVE the girl. This
letter's got to be smooth. It's gotta be four pages of
smoothness."
"How long?" asked the Woman-killer, "Four pages?
That ought to be easy. I write eight pages to my
gal every day."
"Eight pages!" Lovesick was startled.
"Well," hastily added the Woman-killer, "it really
isn't smooth, you know."
"How dya do it?" asked the Playboy.
"Oh. I don't know," said the Woman-killer. "I just
write what I feel. We've been going together for four
years now, and every time I hear a song over the radio,
or walk down the street it starts me thinkin', so I just
write along about that."
"Gosh!" said P and L.
"Say," snapped the Playboy. "I've got a swell way
to end your letter, Lou. It really gets 'em. Wait a min
ute, I'll read it to you from my gal's last letter. Now,
get this. Lissen to it: "Sweet dreams, darling, I love
you."
"Gee!" said L and W.
"But how'm I going to start it?" asked Lovesick.
"Well, what's her name?" probed the Playboy.
"Dora," gasped Lou.
"Well, how about, 'Dora, dear'?"
