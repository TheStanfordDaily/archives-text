EQUAL RIGHTS
The Editor, Sir:
The comment of "Interested" on
my discussion of woman's work
raises two questions: (1) What are
the emotional correlates of the pe
riodic disruptions in the course of
a woman's life? and (2) What'is the
vocational significance of these facts,
particularly in reference to woman's
ability "to do a man's work"?
The answer to the first question
would involve a discussion too tech
nical for these columns. It may be
suggested, however, that oscillations
of mood vary greatly from man to
man and from woman to woman.
Physiological rhythms are but one
aspect of these oscillations. Further
more, women have shown them
selves capable of giving dependable
service in professions such as nurs
ing, which call for a great deal of
emotional balance. Therefore, undue
weight must not be attached to dif
ferences between men and women,
nn matter how obvious, unless and
until these differences are shown to
be more significant than others as
determiners of psychological char
acteristics.
The second question involves a
slight misunderstanding of my dis
cussion. I do not suggest that a
woman should do a man's work. I
prefer to state the question this way:
Have not men and women equally
the right to work for pay at useful
tasks which they find interesting and
for which they are fitted? An affir
mative answer to this question does
not require us to ignore sex differ
ences.
