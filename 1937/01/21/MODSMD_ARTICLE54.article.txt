# BEDS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Wo hereby give notice that Encina
Inmate and One Floor Up arc cor
roborating in this communication.
Convening after recent disagreement,

we submit the following as reasons
for poor bed-making in Encina:
A janitor needs 30 minutes to clean
an Encina lavatory; a janitor needs
30 minutes to mop approximately
14,400 square feet of hallway; a jani
tor needs 80 minutes to do the nec
essary cleaning in his rooms.
Since these duties take 140 of his
220 minutes, a janitor has left less
than two minutes for each bed.
Now, what we want to know is
this: Could Mr. Brown, with his
managerial efficiency, could A1 Roth
("Yes, Mr. Roth"), could even our
own Dr. Wilbur make a bed well in
two minutes? Or should we leave
out the "well" (not to embarrass the
boys)?
Up One, Down One
