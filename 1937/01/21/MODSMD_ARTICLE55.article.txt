The Editor, Sir
In yesterday's Bull Session, was
Mr. Eisenbach trying to make vip for
an inadequate musical knowledge by
a half column of clever but complete
ly unsound guff?
Do you really believe that most of
an audience knows Bach, Beethoven,
and Brahms only from program
notes? Why do people go to concert
after concert, year after year?
Is it possible to change "artistic
beliefs" within two hours? Gershwin
would be the last person to hail him
self as the "degarbagizer" of music
wilhin that span. True, Gershwin is
frank. His music is frank. He is
earnestly seeking in works like
"Porgy and Bess" to inject a new vi
tality and a folk element into music.
But a great many other composers
are doing the same thing—in a more
inspired and more craftsmanlike
fashion. Gershwin fails as a first
rate musician precisely because of
certain jazz devices which the Good
mans and Dorseys use ad nauseum in
their "hot music."
