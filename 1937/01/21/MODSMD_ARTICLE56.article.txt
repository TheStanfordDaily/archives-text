Officer Thorne of the Palo Alto
Police Department will be very
much at home in his part in "Blind
Alley," murder mystery being pro
duced by the Community Players
tonight, when he portrays Dale At
wood, a campus cop.
Scene of the drama is a university,
which comes to with a start when in
vaded by a criminal gang. Carol Al
exander, technical director for the
Community Theater, designed the
set, which shows the living room in
the home of Professor Anthony Shel
by. psychologist turned sleuth.
Besides Jim "Corner and Julius
Hooven, Stanford students who play
the gangster and murdered student.
Dot Brookman. a sophomore, will be
cast in the comedy role of Agnes,
the maid.
"Blind Alley" will also be present- j
ed tomorrow and Saturday.

Gloria Swanson, who once was
Hollywood's ace attraction, returns
briefly over the airlanes as guest
artist of Lanny Ross' Show Boat pro
gram, tonight at 8:30 on KGO . . .
KPO offers Lee Tracy and Opera
Star Rose Bampton as extra value
on the Bing Crosby Music Hall hour
from 7 (ill 8 . . . But every night
nearly every program has a "guest
artist." It's a gag—usually meaning
the program needs bolstering. How
ever, it does show (he need for va
riety . . . And Rudy Vallee was the
first to admit it publicly . . . While
his hour was still tops he introduced
"guest artists" . . . Now they all do
it—and with more cause than Rudy
had.
