# Johansen Plans Play Staging
## New Technician to Work On 'This Side Idolatry' 
### BARBARA ROSENBLATT 
Technical work for the winter j
quarter production, "This Side Idol
atry," is being directed by Waldemar
Johansen, who received his M.A. at
Stanford and is now a member of the
Farm's dramatic staff.
Mr. Johansen has had much expe
rience in stage and costume design, as
well as in the fields of commercial
advertising, industrial design, inte
rior decoration, and water colors and
oils. Born in Germany, he attended
art schools in Dresden. Munich, and
Leipzig, later doing professional work
in New York, Detroit, and at the Chi
cago Civic Opera House.
Before coming to Stanford, he j
taught at Sequoia High School in
Redwood City, Riverside J.C., and
Santa Monica J.C.
Authenticity is Mr. Johansen's
main aim for the sets and costumes in
"This Side Idolatry," which is a
chronicle of Shakespeare's life. Sev
en successive changes of scene in the
play necessitate quick changes; Mr.
Johansen is allowing three minutes, a
remarkably short time, between each
scene.
He is able to do this by means of a
revolving unit which he invented and
which is copyrighted in his name.
The unit consists of a triangular col
umn, movable and free to turn in any
direction, which adds flexibility to
the mechanical end of production.
Cqstumes for the play will be fur
nished by a major Hollywood studio,
which used them for a picture about
Shakespeare. Thus they will be exact
in detail, as well as elaborate.
Interesting scenes which will be
recreated for the play include the
stage of the old Globe Theater,
Shakespeare's manor in Stratford,
and a tavern which "might have
been an Elizabethan night club, fre
quented, however, in that ill-lighted
century, by day."
Skolsky, there is a certain scenario
writer who is noted for his plagiar
ism. An executive was asked why he
kept this writer on the payroll when
he knew the writer stole his ideas
for stories. The executive replied:
"Because he steals good idas. When
he steals a bad one I'll know he's
flopping and I'll fire him."
