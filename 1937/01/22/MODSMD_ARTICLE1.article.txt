# Roth And Fontius Object To $8,000 Lakeside Nitery
## Comptroller Doubts Need For New Structure; Favors Union Lobby 
### DAVID LEFF 
A dance spot beside Lake Lagunita
would not solve the Stanford social
problem, was Comptroller Almon
Roth's vehemently expressed opin
ion last night.
Questioned with regard to the
plans submitted to The Daily, Roth
was doubtful that a building of such
a size could accommodate the two
out of three students whose social life
needs catering to.
"However," he asserted, "if the
students want to finance this proj
ect, it's their business. In my judg
ment, though, they would be chasing
a rainbow. I don't think the Nitery
will be a success after the first nov
elty has worn off. The problem is too
big for a Nitery to solve."
Questioned as to his attitude
toward a possible adding of one dol
lar to community fees by Ex Com
mittee, assuming students desired to
build the $8,000 lakeside structure
anyway, Roth said, "If they want to
assess themselves $500. it's o.k. with
me, but I think they'd be making a
mistake."
Substantially of the same opinion
was Student Manager Chuck Fontius
who explained, "It would take all of
the A.S.S.U. reserve funds to build
such a Nitery. As I am not convinced
of the demand for it, I could not rec
ommend such a move."
With regard to renovation of the
Union lubby, Roth was enthusiastic,
though. "That would be the most
practical solution in my opinion," he
declared. "We need a club room.
Those offices would be better off up
stairs. And if popularity falls off, you
haven't sunk a lot of money into the
ground. "Try the Union first," sug
gested Roth, adding that if large and
sustained demand were indicated, a
more elaborate venture might be un
dertaken.
