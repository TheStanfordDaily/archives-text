# 'Sunrise' Shown To Film Group
## German Trend Typified By 1927 Production 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The sun finally rose in the Assem
bly Hall last night.
And when it did, as the last reel
of "Sunrise" came to an end, Mr.
Mendolowitz' Motion Picture stu
dents realized that for the first time
since the Thursday night series be
gan, they had enjoyed a film as its
producers had intended it to be en
joyed.
German Influence
"Sunrise," produced in 1927, was
shown as an example of the German
influence in American pictures. Di
rected and designed by Germans, it
was an attempt to adapt the Euro
pean technique to a Hollywood pro
duction —with a powerful if unstable
effect.
The plot was simple, furthered by
dramatic photography and masterful
direction rather than by convincing
acting. George O'Brien, usually asso
ciated with Texas rangers and stam
peding cattle, overacted — especially
in the "heavier" parts—the part of a
young farmer who almost drowns his
wife over infatuation with a flapper
from the city. Janet Gaynor, as the
young wife, turned on the smiles and
tears much as one turns on hot and
cold running water.

But F. W. Murau's directing carried
the acting and plot along with a
skilled if eratic touch. The lighting,
skilled if erratic touch. The lighting,
lent realism and emotional strength
to otherwise commonplace sequences.
Also on last night's program was
an atrocity called "Hands." Sup
posedly a study in abstract cinematic
composition, it was little more than
a series of pointless "handies." For
two reels, scores of human arms and
hands waved around against varying
modernistic backgrounds—a horrible
example of "art for art's sake."
