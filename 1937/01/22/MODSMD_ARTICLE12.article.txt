# Trustees Put Okeh on New Construction
## Work on Lagunita Wings, Education Building To Begin Very Shortly 
### 
Construct ion will begin imme
diately on two new wings of Lagunita
Court and within two months on the
new Cubberley Education Building,
according to a statement made by
Comptroller Almon E. Roth following
the Board of Trustees' meeting yes
terday.
Trustees' approval of the $236,420
total cost figure for the two Lagunita
additions, each of which will accom
modate 44 women, opened the way
for immediate action on that proj
ect, since plans have been completed
and all contracts let.
To Start Cubberley Building
The Board gave Mr. Roth authority
to proceed with construction of the
Cubberley Building, which will stand
on the present parking lot adjoining
the library and opposite engineering
corner, provided the cost falls with
in the estimated $565,000. The final
figure is not yet known, because a
few subcontracts have not been ar
ranged.
Money for the additions to La
gunita will be provided by the tui
tion fees of the women who will be
housed therein, since these fees are
added income to the University's
budget. The education building is
made possible by a gift of Emeritus
Dean of Education Ellwood P. Cub
berley.
Amphitheater Waits
Completion of the new amphithe
ater is dependent upon obtaining
about 6000 yards of dirt from the
Cubberley Building excavation. Mr.
Roth hopes to begin the latter proj
ect soon enough that the outdoor
theater may be finished in time for
spring planting of trees and shrubs.
Previously an appropriation for the
two Lagunita additions had ucen ap
proved by the Board of Trustees, at a
lower figure than the present. Rising
building costs made construction at
the former figure impossible, and ne
cessitated new estimates and a new
okeh by the Board.
