# Big Shots Scorn Missives of Passion

Passion letters published in yestcr
! day's Daily were scorned by most
Stanfordites, according to a survey
made late last night.
There was. however, quite a dis
; tinct difference of opinion as to
| which was the worst.
I Prexy Jim Reynolds was the only
j one on the campus who didn't have a
j very definite opinion at his mental
j finger tips. "Passion letters?" he ;
queried. "I didn't read either one
! of them."
Jim Ransohoff considered number
I two the better, "but they're both sort
i of asinine."
Tom Killefer also liked number
j two. "But I'll bet a lot of the fel- '
lows around here get better ones ;
than that." he continued.
Fred Williams was the lone up

said, "I liked the spirit it was written
in, you know." (He thought we'd
know!)
Esther Pelton had the reasons for
her choice carefully worked out. "I
think number two is the lesser of two
very great evils," she declared. "It
was a little more esthetic â€” perhaps
more bourgeois."
Chick Franich, skeptically: "What
the hell is this? As passion letters, '
they were pretty much of a fizzle. :
They must have been written by a |
couple of infants."
Dulce Parker said that she liked I
the salutation. "Darling." "I think if j
I were a boy it would have pleased \
me more than the other. It sounded
cultured."
Shirley Jones drawled in a calm
sort of way, "Oh. so The Daily is
conducting a survey? Well, you can

Only one letter has reached The
Daily on the subject of the passion
letters. It follows:
The Editor, Sir:
Please do not publish my name, as
we law students are not supposed to
have enough time to read the papers,
but I do anyway because I don't see
any use in studying stuff I can't
make head nor tail of anyhow.
I really want to become a lawyer
after reading this morning's paper.
I hope by that time, if ever, that
there will be some law which I can
use to mete out suitable punishment
to the Stanford Gentlemen who see
fit to publish letters from girls who
are so misguided as to like them.
Perhaps if these two Monuments to
Manhood went to Sati Francisco they
could have the letters published in
that oracle of truth, the Examiner.
