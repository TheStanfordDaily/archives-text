First signs of the fall of the
house of Oaks appeared last
month when two second story
occupants jerked down a cur
tain rod and pulled down a size
able hunk of ceiling. Over va
cation, plasterers put the house
together again, but Wednesday
afternoon two other roommates
arrived home to find over half
their ceiling reposing in frag
ments on beds and floor.
Five panic-stricken occu
pants of surrounding rooms
have moved their couches into
the hall where they are spend
ing the nights.
