# Grads Dislike Sequoia Rooms
## Oppose Administration's Projected Change 
### 
Graduate men took none too i
kindly to the administration's plan j
to move them into Sequoia Hall, j
Mulling it over among themselves to- '
day they brought forward two main j
objections: that Sequoia rooms are!
for two or three men, graduate men
need single rooms; and that it would j
mean the breaking up of the Sequoia \
eating club.
In a letter to the editor of The i
Daily. Sidney Degoff, law graduate,!
stated the case concisely. He said: j
' Sequoia is now occupied by 137 men
in 70 rooms. There is no reason to !
believe that graduates would move in I
if the undergraduates move out. Cer- j
tainly no great number of men now
living in town would move; other- i
wise the hall would be filled now.!
Sequoia might draw men from the j
fifth floor Encina, but they have, for!
ths most part, single rooms, and |
graduates have a serious purpose and |
don't want to be disturbed.
' The Sequoia eating club would
probably lose most of its under
graduate students without a corre
sponding increase in graduates." |
Agreeing with Degoff, John Han- j
son, also a law grad living in En- !
cina, said: "I think single rooms are |
essential to graduate study."
That Degoff's objections were valid i
was the opinion of John Hinkle, an- j
other Encina grad. "I'd prefer En- 1
cina, or a nice new dormitory, to j
Sequoia," he said.
Neither Dean Culver nor Bert |
Gage, manager of dormitories, could j
verify Degoff's figures. Gage, how- j
ever, agreed that most of the rooms
at Sequoia were for two or three men
and that serious difficulty would be;
met in trying to change them into;
single rooms.
