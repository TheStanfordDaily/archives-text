### 
Solicitors of the A.S.U.-sponsored
"Stanford Committee for the Relief
of the Spanish People" are now ac
tively at work collecting funds for
the popular-loyalist forces in Spain,
according to an announcement of
Ralph Stotsky, who is directing the
campaign.
Stanford sympathizers with the
Popular Front government in Spain
are planning a four weeks' long
drive for funds, Stotsky says. He
adds that they hope to culminate the
campaign with an open meeting on
the campus late in February, at
which members of the Spanish Youth
Delegation now touring this country
would speak.
Questioned about the success of
the campaign during the first few
days, Stotsky said: "In addition to the
many favorable responses from the
student body, a few adversely crit
ical persons have appeared bristling
with argumentative tendencies."
"However, owing to the emergency
situation, the committee cannot at
this time undertake to debate with
those opposed to the campaign. Our
immediate purpose is to raise funds
in order to alleviate the present in
tense suffering of the Spanish people,
especially the non-combatants."
Stotsky would give no estimate of
the amount of funds so far raised.
