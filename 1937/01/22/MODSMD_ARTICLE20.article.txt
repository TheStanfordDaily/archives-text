# Bush Discusses Foreign Press
## British Don't Get News, Professor Tells Class 
### 
"British newspapers, with few ex
ceptions, contain scarcely anything
worth reading," said Professor Chil
ton R. Bush, addressing the current
events class yesterday.
Dr. Bush was discussing the news
papers of the tenth of the world
where a free press exists. He ex
plained the poor British press by the
fact that none of their newspapers,
with the exception of the Manchester
Guardian, ever exposes anything.
Because of a combination of a
conservative patriotism and strict
libel laws, the five British press lords
usually will withhold a story at the
"request" of the government.
Laxity of libel laws, on the other
hand, is the chief trouble with the
French libel laws and require a
the French press, along with much
response to bribery. The proposed
press reform law would tighten
statement of income by newspapers.
As to U.S. newspapers, Dr. Bush
pointed out that many of our papers
have the good features of the French
and British journals, leaving out the
bad.
American papers are tending more
and more toward giving both sides
of a question and reviving personal
journalism through the columnists.
The trouble now is that certain
American publishers think they
know what is best for the country,
explained Dr. Bush. The recent elec
tion has at least temporarily halted
this, now that "Mr. Hearst is down
on his knees apologizing to the coun
try."
