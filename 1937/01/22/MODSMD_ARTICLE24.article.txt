# Cards, Cal Open Series Tonight In Berkeley Tilt
## Bunn Team Faces Fair Future in Try to End Domination by Bears 
### WALT PETERSON 
After having fired away at Calif
ornia for 15 years without winning
one basketball series, Stanford's
varsity cagers tangle with the Gold
en Bears in Berkeley tonight with
the best prospects since 1922 of
trouncing the Califomians in a
majority of the four games.
It has been a long old row to hoe
for the Cards, with the labor doubly
hard.
Last year when the Nibs Price
outfit won two of the quartet of con
tests from this same team.
Observers conceded Stanford a
great opportunity to win at least
three games last year, but somehow,
someway, the third-place Bears
snatched two from the conference
winning Indians, one a 63-30 murder.
May Be Bunn's Year
Things might be brighter for John
Bunn this year, with the identical
last year's squad augmented by sev
eral reserves that make this team
possibly the strongest ever to re
present Stanford. California lost only
one man by graduation last year,
forward Ray Olson, and to take his
place they have uncovered Bob Duffy
nobody's slouch on a basketball
floor.
Pretty much of an in-and-outer,
Duffy is saltier than a Norway cod
when he's low but on his best nights
he's dynamite. His top score this year
lor any one game is 25 points,
which is just about as good as most
anybody could want. However, Ohio
State and Tippy Dye stopped him
with five points in two games, and
Troy slowed him down to a walk
with 13 in two tilts.
He Got Away
Along with Duffy the Bears have
found a new guard, Ralph Hillsman,
a transfer from San Francisco State
who, incidentally, was down to see
John Bunn once but had to be passed
up by the Stanford coach because he
couldn't find a place for him on the
already crowded squad.
Hillsman, a 5-foot 10Vi;-inch fel
low with bundles of speed, has come
up fast enough to replace Bob Her
wig as a starter in more than one
game. The big boy had a little too
much football this ye.H-, what with a
post-season trip to Georgia, and
looked pretty ragged in his first hoop
games. He still isn't in the best of
shape, although he has been improv
ing rapidly.
Figuring that the all-American
gridder has had better conference ex
perience than Hillsman, and has
played for two years against a Bunn
coached offense, Nibs Price has nam
ed him to start tonight at his old
spot.
Team Hit by Flu
Hillsman, however, will in all
likelihood start tonight, too, for the
other leading guard, Don Jensen, has
been in the infirmary for two days
with flu. It is a rather strategic posi
tion, since the man to play that posi
tion must be good enough to stop
Luisetti. Jensen, they say, is
the top man for that task.
Duffy, also, has been touched by
the flu, but although his starting is
in a little doubt, it is quite likely that
he will open the game. Dick Dnvid.
one of the mainstays of the Cal Frosh
last year, is a possible replacement.
Chet Carlisle, a junior who has
shown great improvement this year,
will start at center, to be backed by
Bob Chalmers, an Oakland giant who
was frosh hot-shot last year. All sea
son Chalmers has been pushing Car
lisle, with the position constantly in
doubt.
At the other forward, opposite
Duffy, will be Co -captain Ray Bals*
ley, a hard-working boy who has
played reasonably steady ball for two
years. Not particularly flashy, he is
still good enough to hold a top spot j
over Ed Dougery, a junior.
Team of Vets
Starting for Stanford will be the
same team that has started almost j
every game since the opening of last
season. Indescribable Hank Luisetti, \
the gangling Grayson of hoopdom. 1
will start at left forward, with Howell
Turner, the player who with Luisetti
was named as one of the two best I
forwards ever to play in Madison
Square Garden by eastern observ
ers.
Captain Dinty Moore and Jack
"Spook" Calderwood, both named
All-Coast guards at one time or an- j
other, will start at the feeder posts. |
Moore, aggressive, fast, strong, and a
good shot, is just a balance for the |
almost placid but surprisingly bril- |
liant play of Calderwood, a giant j
anywhere but biggest on defense.
Towering Art Stoefen, cousin of
tennis-playing Lester, is the fifth of |
the Crimson Giants and will start at j
center. The sharp-elbowed one has'<

been jioing great guns this season,
and is in perfect fettle.
Scheduled to start at 8:00 in Ed
wards Gyin, the game will be ref
ereed by Lloyd Leith and Ernie
Bailey, the green-shirt kids.

Hillsman, a 5-foot 10Vi;-inch fel
low with bundles of speed, has come
up fast enough to replace Bob Her
wig as a starter in more than one
game. The big boy had a little too
much football this ye.H-, what with a
post-season trip to Georgia, and
looked pretty ragged in his first hoop
games. He still isn't in the best of
shape, although he has been improv
ing rapidly.
Figuring that the all-American
gridder has had better conference ex
perience than Hillsman, and has
played for two years against a Bunn
coached offense, Nibs Price has nam
ed him to start tonight at his old
spot.
Team Hit by Flu
Hillsman, however, will in all
likelihood start tonight, too, for the
other leading guard, Don Jensen, has
been in the infirmary for two days
with flu. It is a rather strategic posi
tion, since the man to play that posi
tion must be good enough to stop
Luisetti. Jensen, they say, is
the top man for that task.
Duffy, also, has been touched by
the flu, but although his starting is
in a little doubt, it is quite likely that
he will open the game. Dick Dnvid.
one of the mainstays of the Cal Frosh
last year, is a possible replacement.
Chet Carlisle, a junior who has
shown great improvement this year,
will start at center, to be backed by
Bob Chalmers, an Oakland giant who
was frosh hot-shot last year. All sea
son Chalmers has been pushing Car
lisle, with the position constantly in
doubt.
At the other forward, opposite
Duffy, will be Co -captain Ray Bals*
ley, a hard-working boy who has
played reasonably steady ball for two
years. Not particularly flashy, he is
still good enough to hold a top spot j
over Ed Dougery, a junior.
Team of Vets
Starting for Stanford will be the
same team that has started almost j
every game since the opening of last
season. Indescribable Hank Luisetti, \
the gangling Grayson of hoopdom. 1
will start at left forward, with Howell
Turner, the player who with Luisetti
was named as one of the two best I
forwards ever to play in Madison
Square Garden by eastern observ
ers.
Captain Dinty Moore and Jack
"Spook" Calderwood, both named
All-Coast guards at one time or an- j
other, will start at the feeder posts. |
Moore, aggressive, fast, strong, and a
good shot, is just a balance for the |
almost placid but surprisingly bril- |
liant play of Calderwood, a giant j
anywhere but biggest on defense.
Towering Art Stoefen, cousin of
tennis-playing Lester, is the fifth of |
the Crimson Giants and will start at j
center. The sharp-elbowed one has'<

been jioing great guns this season,
and is in perfect fettle.
Scheduled to start at 8:00 in Ed
wards Gyin, the game will be ref
ereed by Lloyd Leith and Ernie
Bailey, the green-shirt kids.
After having fired away at Calif
ornia for 15 years without winning
one basketball series, Stanford's
varsity cagers tangle with the Gold
en Bears in Berkeley tonight with
the best prospects since 1922 of
trouncing the Califomians in a
majority of the four games.
It has been a long old row to hoe
for the Cards, with the labor doubly
hard.
Last year when the Nibs Price
outfit won two of the quartet of con
tests from this same team.
Observers conceded Stanford a
great opportunity to win at least
three games last year, but somehow,
someway, the third-place Bears
snatched two from the conference
winning Indians, one a 63-30 murder.
May Be Bunn's Year
Things might be brighter for John
Bunn this year, with the identical
last year's squad augmented by sev
eral reserves that make this team
possibly the strongest ever to re
present Stanford. California lost only
one man by graduation last year,
forward Ray Olson, and to take his
place they have uncovered Bob Duffy
nobody's slouch on a basketball
floor.
Pretty much of an in-and-outer,
Duffy is saltier than a Norway cod
when he's low but on his best nights
he's dynamite. His top score this year
lor any one game is 25 points,
which is just about as good as most
anybody could want. However, Ohio
State and Tippy Dye stopped him
with five points in two games, and
Troy slowed him down to a walk
with 13 in two tilts.
He Got Away
Along with Duffy the Bears have
found a new guard, Ralph Hillsman,
a transfer from San Francisco State
who, incidentally, was down to see
John Bunn once but had to be passed
up by the Stanford coach because he
couldn't find a place for him on the
already crowded squad.

season. Indescribable Hank Luisetti, \
the gangling Grayson of hoopdom. 1
will start at left forward, with Howell
Turner, the player who with Luisetti
was named as one of the two best I
forwards ever to play in Madison
Square Garden by eastern observ
ers.
Captain Dinty Moore and Jack
"Spook" Calderwood, both named
All-Coast guards at one time or an- j
other, will start at the feeder posts. |
Moore, aggressive, fast, strong, and a
good shot, is just a balance for the |
almost placid but surprisingly bril- |
liant play of Calderwood, a giant j
anywhere but biggest on defense.
Towering Art Stoefen, cousin of
tennis-playing Lester, is the fifth of |
the Crimson Giants and will start at j
center. The sharp-elbowed one has'<

been jioing great guns this season,
and is in perfect fettle.
Scheduled to start at 8:00 in Ed
wards Gyin, the game will be ref
ereed by Lloyd Leith and Ernie
Bailey, the green-shirt kids.
After having fired away at Calif
ornia for 15 years without winning
one basketball series, Stanford's
varsity cagers tangle with the Gold
en Bears in Berkeley tonight with
the best prospects since 1922 of
trouncing the Califomians in a
majority of the four games.
It has been a long old row to hoe
for the Cards, with the labor doubly
hard.
Last year when the Nibs Price
outfit won two of the quartet of con
tests from this same team.
Observers conceded Stanford a
great opportunity to win at least
three games last year, but somehow,
someway, the third-place Bears
snatched two from the conference
winning Indians, one a 63-30 murder.
May Be Bunn's Year
Things might be brighter for John
Bunn this year, with the identical
last year's squad augmented by sev
eral reserves that make this team
possibly the strongest ever to re
present Stanford. California lost only
one man by graduation last year,
forward Ray Olson, and to take his
place they have uncovered Bob Duffy
nobody's slouch on a basketball
floor.
Pretty much of an in-and-outer,
Duffy is saltier than a Norway cod
when he's low but on his best nights
he's dynamite. His top score this year
lor any one game is 25 points,
which is just about as good as most
anybody could want. However, Ohio
State and Tippy Dye stopped him
with five points in two games, and
Troy slowed him down to a walk
with 13 in two tilts.
He Got Away
Along with Duffy the Bears have
found a new guard, Ralph Hillsman,
a transfer from San Francisco State
who, incidentally, was down to see
John Bunn once but had to be passed
up by the Stanford coach because he
couldn't find a place for him on the
already crowded squad.
Hillsman, a 5-foot 10Vi;-inch fel
low with bundles of speed, has come
up fast enough to replace Bob Her
wig as a starter in more than one
game. The big boy had a little too
much football this ye.H-, what with a
post-season trip to Georgia, and
looked pretty ragged in his first hoop
games. He still isn't in the best of
shape, although he has been improv
ing rapidly.
Figuring that the all-American
gridder has had better conference ex
perience than Hillsman, and has
played for two years against a Bunn
coached offense, Nibs Price has nam
ed him to start tonight at his old
spot.
Team Hit by Flu
Hillsman, however, will in all
likelihood start tonight, too, for the
other leading guard, Don Jensen, has
been in the infirmary for two days
with flu. It is a rather strategic posi
tion, since the man to play that posi
tion must be good enough to stop
Luisetti. Jensen, they say, is
the top man for that task.
Duffy, also, has been touched by
the flu, but although his starting is
in a little doubt, it is quite likely that
he will open the game. Dick Dnvid.
one of the mainstays of the Cal Frosh
last year, is a possible replacement.
Chet Carlisle, a junior who has
shown great improvement this year,
will start at center, to be backed by
Bob Chalmers, an Oakland giant who
was frosh hot-shot last year. All sea
son Chalmers has been pushing Car
lisle, with the position constantly in
doubt.
At the other forward, opposite
Duffy, will be Co -captain Ray Bals*
ley, a hard-working boy who has
played reasonably steady ball for two
years. Not particularly flashy, he is
still good enough to hold a top spot j
over Ed Dougery, a junior.
