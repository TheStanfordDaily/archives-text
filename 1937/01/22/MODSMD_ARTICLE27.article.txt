The Stanford Daily, that last
stronghold of the pussyfoot tech
nique in journalism, has finally capit
ulated and expressed a desire to
play up a sensational alienation of |
affections case involving a Stanford j
student on its front page.
The old contention, that the only |
difference between a good newspa- j
per and a yellow journal is the fact 1
that the good journal puts the yellow j
material on the insidk pages instead
of page one, does not hold true here,
for what the Stanford Daily said on
its front page was infinitely more in
taste than the Paris Nights stuff the
San Francisco metropolitan dailies!
buried inside their papers. It should !
be pointed out, though, that the Stan- :
ford Daily's lead sentence on the j
story was carelessly worded and j
somewhere on the road to slander.
* * *
Of course, Eisenbach and probably \
Jorgensen also will claim that how ,
close to slander it comes is a matter [
of degree, and they will no doubt I
make the obvious statement that the
source of the whole affair is a com- '
plaint filed in a public court and in- j
controvertably a public document
which cannot be suppressed. Thus
the Daily or any other paper safely
can print whatever charges are made
on the 'newspaper in such cases is
that undefinable quality of good
taste, and no matter how hazy the
conception of what is good taste and
what is not, it seems to me that the
Daily for once has gotten itself into
the class of individuals who leave
their chewing gum parked in drink
ing fountains.
Now I recognize that the Stanford
Daily is only sweeping up what the
San Francisco papers smeared all
over the place. My obtuseness on
musical matters even melts enough
at this time to recognize that I can
not point with envy to England's
strict laws against publication of di
vorce testimony, for there are also
strict contempt of court laws in
England which prohibit tri.d by
newspapers and impertinent com
ment like this column. This is Amer
ica, the land of unbridled scurrilous
talk. The laws of England would
stab both the Stanford Daily printing
such stories and myself writing such
blather.
But the point is that what has been
charged in the complaint presented
to the Merced court, in this case has
not yet been proven. If the girl ac
cused is legally innocent until proved
guilty, by what the Stanford Daily
has printed for the campus to read,
she is guilty until proved innocent.
It is true that it will be hard for the
