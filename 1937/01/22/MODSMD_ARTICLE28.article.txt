made by Women's Conference.
It was decided that overnight
leaves could be changed to 2:3l)'s by
coming in before that hour. This is
to be an experimental rule in effect
for the remainder of this quarter.
Starting this week, any technical
lockouts after the third, will each
count as a regular lockout. In the
past each technical lockout counted
as one-third of a regular. Confer
ence made the regulation on a rec
ommendation from the Lockout
Committee.

between the hours of 2:30 and G
o'clock in the morning. Unless girls
