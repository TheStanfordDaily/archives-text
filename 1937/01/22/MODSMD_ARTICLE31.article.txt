TONIGHT STANFORD IS
MEETING CALIFORNIA

Well, shake the mud off your shoes
and loosen your lie, because tonight
is the night and the adrenalin is
going to flow.
You of the lucky 1,136 that got
tickets really got your money's
worth. Nobody can predict what
kind of a show we'll get, but the
odds are way out that it'll be some
thing different and worth while.
Stanford you've seen play; they're
about the best team we've had here,
but before the season started Coach
Bunn said they'd lose one this sea
son, and maybe more. Stanford's
principal assets, it seems to me, are
the speed and experience of the play
ers, Luisetti, and a feeling of calm
and confidence on the floor.
In no game yet have they in any
way tightened or lost that smiling,
enjoy-the-game, follow - instructions
attitude of play. There's no reason
why they should start now.
California, on the other hand, is
not nearly the bunch of bums that
you'd be led to believe after reading
about their losing two last week .to
U.S.C.
TIIE BEARS ARE NOT
OUT IN THE COLD
Nibs Price and his gang are all
right when it comes to winning
games. They had a good year in 1936,
and only Olson has been graduated,
while Duffy and Hillsman have been
gained. They split with Ohio State
and they rang up a whale of a score
on Santa Clara. They simply had
hard luck in the south last week,
and a very virulent case of it in the
second game, which was lost to a
foul shot in the last minute.
For you that don't know or remem
ber, Cal's style of play isn't like the
complicated and tangled deploying
that you've seen around here. Let
Bob Wesson of the Daily Cal describe
it and try to sell it:
"Price uses ball control, commonly
called 'guard control.' The guards
bring the ball past the center line,

using the 'free-swing,' and then pass
the ball back and forth while the for
wards attempt to break free.
"Coupled with the interchangeable
zone defense, the system of guard
control will win 90 per cent of its
games, granting the material is equal.
"Because of the slow method of
attack (waiting for a better than av
i rage shot before shooting) the Bears
will cut down the number of recov
eries and consequent shots by the
opposing team . . .
' With the Bears in control of the
ball the majority of the time, the op
posing team has not had the scoring
opportunities usually available. Too,
the California defense is much tight
er than the zone proper or straight
man-for-man defense. Given a man
who can shoot . . . the Bears will go
to town ..."
So that's the explanation for all
that fooling around the Bears do in a
large circle around the basket, finally
shooting and then converging toward
it. It's quite a sight.
HUI AFTER ALL.
HERE'S THE THING:
The question, though, is not so
much between the capabilities of the
respective teams, nor between their
styles of play. There are other
things:
1. It is a Stanford-California ath
letic contest, one of those things that
is a natural before it's even sched
uled. 2. There will be eight thou
sand howling, yowling spectators,
three quarters of them California
rooters. You know California rooters.
3. Stanford wants to win in Berkeley,
something she couldn't do last year,
and California wants to beat Stan
ford, because Stanfoi'd has an East
ern reputation. 4. It is a Conference
game, and every conference game
counts. 5. There has been a lot of
blood and thunder about rules, offi
cials, and "popping off" in Bay Area
periodicals this week.
Get there on time, then, for a good
seat. There'll be no chance to take
a nap in Edwards Gym tonight!
