# Frosh Cagers To Meet Lowell
## Yearlings End Practice For Week-end Games 
### 
"Our Boy" Wytze, mentor of Stan- i
ford's undefeated frosh hoopsters, j
yesterday made his champions take!
practice very easy, fearing that the
übiquitous flu bug would commit a j
few holding fouls on the Encina men.!
That boogey-boogey disease, so I
dangerous to basketballers, has al- !
ready hacked down Bob Oakford, j
fiery forward who last Saturday!
night stemmed the Modesto Jaysee |
tide to pull the game out of the j
fire.
Working out yesterday afternoon,;
the yearlings ran through quick
breaks and practiced shooting, pre- j
paratory to meeting Lowell High this \
afternoon at 4:3 ft and St. Mary's frosh i
tomorrow night as a preliminary to ;
the varsity game. Both games will
be in the Pavilion.
When the gentlemen from Encina- !
syluin play Lowell today, they will j
be up against the best prep team in |
the City, which is now gunning for j
its fourth consecutive title in the un- j
limited class. The team, coached by ;
Benney Neff, who has won five un
limited titles in his 11 years at the :
high school, features a straight zone i
defense, plus a center who is being !
compared to one Angelo Luisetti.
The aforementioned center is !
Don Burness, 6 feet 2 inches of i
beautiful basketball player, who is;
one very good shot. He will be aided j
materially by Pete Delos, Rod Nes- ;
sier, Willard Blackfield, and Bob'
Ferrick.
The St. Mary's frosh, mentored by
Jimmy Underhill, average only 6 feet]
in height, but are extraordinarily I
fast. They use the slow-break, shoi't
passing offense, and a man-for-man !
defense. Their starting team will
probably be Jack Sims, Howard j
Campbell, George McSweeney, Norm
MacPhail, and Tom Feeney.
