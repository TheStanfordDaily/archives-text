# Woman Sips Soup On Chappie Cover
## 
### 
A girl was eating soup. Suddenly,
a camera clicked, and the soup-eat
er's surprised gastronomies were
transferred to film. This candid
camera shot will come to you next
week on the cover of Chaparralâ€”sans
the sound effects.
Within this 32-page rogues' gal
lery of the Farm appears a peeping
Thomas album collected by George
McKenna from behind Quad pillars
and other points of guerilla vantage.
The labeling is by Irvin Jorgensen.
Prize-winners in Chappie's big
photograph contest are named and
their work displayed. Snappers of the
three most humorous and the threo
most skillful pictures will be award
ed important prizes.
This month, Little Pop-Off goes to
the hospital a victim of the flu epi
demic. His author, Editor Gilman
Gist, writes the little redskin having
lived la Vie Boheme, for Gist was in
medical cold storage for some time
with Literary Editor Bob Hartmann
putting out a healthy fraction of the
Minecam Chaparral.
