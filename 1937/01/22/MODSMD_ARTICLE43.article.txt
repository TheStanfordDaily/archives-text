# Everything and Nothing Is Impossible at Stanford

Whenever anybody says the Nitery is im
practical financially, I am reminded of the New
Theater.
The way the New Theater is financed is quite
simple. In the first place, the students borrow
the money from the University at 5 per cent in
terest.
The University charges this 5 per cent inter
est on security that is just as strong as the Uni
versity itself, on the grounds that it is "policy."
Then the students pay off this indebtedness
to the University by a direct dollar tax per stu
dent per quarter. Added to this is an indirect
tax. For the privilege of using the Union facili
ties, students pay a one-dollar Union fee per
quarter, which immediately shows up, ding,
ding, on the Union books as profit. Then 75
per cent of the profit of the Union (until a cer
tain reserve requirement is reached) is turned
over to the New Theater fund.
And in addition, Student Manager Charles H.
Fontius, not knowing exactly what to do with
the one-dollar fee collected quarterly for the
A.S.S.U. budget (the various organizations want
ing pins, sweaters, rings, and badges having
given out), has proposed to split up half of that
to help amortize the debt on the New Theater,
and give the rest to the Student Aid Fund.
For this we get what is undoubtedly the finest
college theater in America. In lact it is so fine
that there is scarcely any theater in this country
that can touch it; for the highly specialized func
tion which it will serve: development of the eso
teric splendors of the higher forms of dramatic
art, and the training of dramatic teachers who
will go out in the world to serve in the cause of
the development of the esoteric splendors of
the higher forms of art (however, in not such
quite fine theaters). But in order to get such an
excellent theater we can't make it big enough
to hold the Concert Series, and the bigger stu
dent productions of what is now called the
Dramatic Council.
Now this is all very fine, but the students are
paying the University 5 per cent interest in
order to build buildings to train dramatics teach
ers. And, if dramatics follows out the universal
trend in every other branch of collegiate train
ing, the New Theater will be used to train fewer
and fewer actors more and more about less and
less in dramatics, while more and more stu
dents are paying less and less interest.
That is why I am not amazed by quotations in
large figures, because in our Alice in Wonder
land land many things seem possible, and when
the often provoked undemocratic charge is
made that the student body doesn't ever know
what it is getting into when it starts out on
things with high enthusiasm, I am forced to
agree.
