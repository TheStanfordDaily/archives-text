That construction work will start immediately
on the two new Lagunita wings was confirmed
by the Board of Trustees at their meeting yes
terday. The two new wings will house 44
women each and will cost $236,420.
The Board of Trustees advanced the money
for the construction, but the 88 extra women
to be housed in future years will be paying for
half of the cost. The financing plan for the extra
wings is the same that was executed for the
original construction on the dormitory. The
money advanced by the Board is amortized over
a long period and approximately half of the
tuition fees of the added v/omen is used to pay
off the cost.
But the providing of rooms for 88 more un
dergraduate women does not help out the
900 graduate students, who for the most part
must live off-campus or in private campus
homes.
The latter part of fall guarter, hall men spon
sored a petition asking for the construction of
a dormitory for graduate men. But the proposal
was dinged by the University because funds for
the project were not forthcoming.
Money was not to be found for a graduate
men's hall because the University did not see
fit to admit more men and use half of their
additional tuition fees to pay the cost as is
being done for Lagunita and its two new addi
tions.
Instead of a new graduates' dorm, Comptrol
ler Roth proposed that graduate men may pos
sibly be housed in Sequoia Hall, which now is
the residence of a heteiogeneous group known
as "the last of the Stanford Roughs."
Before this plan can be innovated, the Uni
versity must first conduct a survey of present
living quarters and make provision for rooms
in the other dorms for the present residents of

dormitory is prohibitive, the University should
concentrate its efforts on providing separate liv

according to academic schools. Sequoia is no
paradise to offer to anyone, particularly to hard
working grads, but at that it would be better
than living around from cellar to garret —and
fifth-floor Encina. R. H.
