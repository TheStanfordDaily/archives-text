# His Goose Was Cooked
## 
### 
Dr. Glenn Frank, president of the university
since 1925, victim of many attacks from his
governing board during the past year, accused
in his early years of radicalism, in late years of
conservatism, was summarily dismissed last
evening.
I say "summarily" because there was not the
slightest doubt in my mind, or in the minds of
any of the well-informed observers on the Frank
case, of the outcome of the hearing. It was evi
dent that no matter what defense would be pre
sented, no matter how many successful refuta
tions could be made to Regent Wilkie's charges,
Dr. Frank was doomed.
His goose was cooked.
I hold no banners for Dr. Frank since it is
not my duty to judge as to his merits. I do want
to thank him, however, for continuing the Uni
versity of Wisconsin liberal policy of a student
newspaper uncensored in any way. In no case,
even when we criticized his policies severely,
has he exercised any form of censorship over us.
What does Dr. Frank's dismissal mean to the
student body of the university?
I think that depends entirely upon the type of
successor ultimately chosen for the presidency
in June. Until that time, an able educator has
been selected to hold the reins of administration
—Dean G. C. Sellery. But the ultimate succes
sor to Dr. Frank must be a man possessing Dr.
Frank's qualities as a publicist and an adminis
trator, plus, evidently, a quality which Dr. Frank
did not have—the ability to reconcile his views
with those of the ruling party in state politics.
