# Success Story
## 
### 
When the student - faculty luncheon club,
whose charitable purpose is to encourage rela
tions between students and faculty and with
distinguished visitors to the campus, tried to
get a cut-rate menu from the Cellar, it failed.
So the backers set up their own establish
ment in the the Women's Club
house, catered in Sandwiches and apple-pie
from a downtown restaurant, got NYA help on
the dishes, Chaplain D. Elton Trueblood on the
coffee urn, and put out a complete and stomach
filling lunch for 25 cents.
Their first meeting a week ago was a great
success, followed by an even larger showing
Wednesday. Such enterprise, particularly when
it comes within the very shadow of the Cellar
cash register, deserves success.
