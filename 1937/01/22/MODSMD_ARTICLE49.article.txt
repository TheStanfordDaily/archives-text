# OUR HASHER
## SOCIETY NOTE 
### 
Cactus plant gardens have taken the place of the
familiar flower arrangements in the center of the
Lagunita dining tables. If Mahomet won't come to the
mountain . . .
For several days there was a library book resting
on the counter at the Loan Desk. The stamped date and
the absent card indicated that the book had been
taken out, but had not been taken way out. The book
was sitting, still was sitting, over the chamber door
until the book hashers just about went into hysterics or
to writing poetry, when all of a sudden a student with
pale blue eyes, and a sad, slow smile apologetically
claimed the book. He explained, contritely, that his
memory was very bad, and that he had walked of!
without it. This satisfied the curiosities of the book
hashers, and the student with the sad, slow smlic
walked off.
Now there really isn't any point to this story and
there is, essentially, nothing funny about it, except that
when the student with the sad. slow smile walked ofT,
tightly clutching his wayward volume, he left his
binder sitting, still is sitting, on the desk.
