Songs that Cal thinks Stanford will sing the first
time after Herwig dribbles down the court tonight:
Does .anyone remember thr Stanford five?
Hardly a man is now alive.
Speech delivered at half-time, according to advices
from the North:
If the Berkeleyites march
With hoof and knee
On the court tonight
Hang a haymaker aloft in the Herwig arch
And I on the opposite bench will be
Ready to rise and shoot the breeze
With all the crowd and the referees.
However, such is not the case. The only noise they'll
be able to hear from the Stanford bench tonight is the
faint crunching sound of somebody shelling peanuts.
