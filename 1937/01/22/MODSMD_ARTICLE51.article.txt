## BATTY AVERAGE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Eisenbach's Bull Sessions are get
ting cleverer and further away from
the point every day.
Yesterday's piece was one of his
best. That "zephyr among mon
soons" was worthy of a Kit Morley,
and the irrelevant dragging in of my
euphonious friends, Bernhard and
Birnbaum, was a masterstroke in
deed! Not quite so worthy was his
"You're another" use of esoteric,
which I first applied to him.
Now how Eisenbach inferred that I
thought the Gershwin concert "shod
dy, and second-hand shoddy at that"
I cannot see. I never said anything
to that effect or from which that
could be implied. As a matter of fact,
I enjoyed Gershwin greatly. He real
ly was "swell." I merely quoted
Prendergast to the effect that what he
presented was not true jazz. Talk
about inability to read, Mr. Eisen
bach!
No, Bob, I'm afraid you're missing
the point as usual. My thesis is this:
jazz is not the highest order of mu
sic, the classics are not garbage (de
spite what Mr. Eisenbach may have
meant, his words were, "Gershwin
. . . de-garbagified music"), and
people attend symphony concerts be
cause they like the music, not to just
get "plush-bottomed culture."
Better try again, Bob, your batting
average is still .000. (Or can it be
just a little too much of the Old
Overholt?)

The Editor, Sir:
If the writer of "Sour Gripes" be
lieves that Shep Fields, Jan Garber,
and George Gershwin are a bunch of
inexpert imitators, he is certainly no
judge of music or musicians. The

men that he mentions have helped
materially in raising "jazz" from a
fad to a permanent and respected po
sition in American music, and Mr.
Prendergast's article shows him to be
either too stupid to recognize it or
too stubborn to admit it. We sug
gest that he give up writing for a
newspaper, and devote more of his
time to the study of music . . . God
knows he needs it!

Yesterday's piece was one of his
best. That "zephyr among mon
soons" was worthy of a Kit Morley,
and the irrelevant dragging in of my
euphonious friends, Bernhard and
Birnbaum, was a masterstroke in
deed! Not quite so worthy was his
"You're another" use of esoteric,
which I first applied to him.
Now how Eisenbach inferred that I
thought the Gershwin concert "shod
dy, and second-hand shoddy at that"
I cannot see. I never said anything
to that effect or from which that
could be implied. As a matter of fact,
I enjoyed Gershwin greatly. He real
ly was "swell." I merely quoted
Prendergast to the effect that what he
presented was not true jazz. Talk
about inability to read, Mr. Eisen
bach!
No, Bob, I'm afraid you're missing
the point as usual. My thesis is this:
jazz is not the highest order of mu
sic, the classics are not garbage (de
spite what Mr. Eisenbach may have
meant, his words were, "Gershwin
. . . de-garbagified music"), and
people attend symphony concerts be
cause they like the music, not to just
get "plush-bottomed culture."
Better try again, Bob, your batting
average is still .000. (Or can it be
just a little too much of the Old
Overholt?)

The Editor, Sir:
If the writer of "Sour Gripes" be
lieves that Shep Fields, Jan Garber,
and George Gershwin are a bunch of
inexpert imitators, he is certainly no
judge of music or musicians. The

men that he mentions have helped
materially in raising "jazz" from a
fad to a permanent and respected po
sition in American music, and Mr.
Prendergast's article shows him to be
either too stupid to recognize it or
too stubborn to admit it. We sug
gest that he give up writing for a
newspaper, and devote more of his
time to the study of music . . . God
knows he needs it!
