# Luckie Byers Getz Low Downey in Bawlout
## Student Directories On Sale in Ad Building 
### ALLEN DRURY 
"Knock, Rapp, who's thei-e?" And
does anybody care? . . .
Bad as any morning- after are the
Bawlout Blues, which attack mem
bers of the Daily staff at the begin
ning of each quarter.
Faced with#the necessity of in
forming the student body that a new
Directory has appeared in the Ad
Building, Daily writers find them
selves reduced to punning to convey
the interesting fact that a student
named Robin Hood got too Brash in
his quest for Bliss and was Paist-ed
by his Parramore for his pains.

The fact that this followed a trip to
Agnew after which Hood, by his own
confession, got decidedly Bulotti,
seemed to make little impression on
the judge, who had been informed
previous to the trial that Hood had
walked on deGrassi.
"What makes me Boyle," His Hon
or stated, "is the fact that Stanford
students are always giving them
selves Ayres. They sacrifice people's
Gudewill under the mistaken im
pression that they are Jesters. I've
been Aiken to get one of them for
some time, and now you Boettcher
I will."
Stern Judge Strikes
Sentence meted out to Hood for his
action dampened his Joy somewhat.
"I'm usually Luckie," he said
modestly, "but this time I got the
Bird and nowâ€”Hirayama."
Plight of the Doering young man
has had little effect on the campus at
large. Attitude of most of the stu
dents seems to be, "It doesn't cut
any Ice with us."
Pending further decision on the
case, Daily photographers are taking
numerous candid camera shots of
President Wilbur, and Daily staff
members are turning out such
Druehl as this, to tell the Associated
students that the Directory of Offi
cers and Students is now on sale in
the Ad Building at 15 cents.
