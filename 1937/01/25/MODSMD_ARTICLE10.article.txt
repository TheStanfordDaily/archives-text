## GOODBYE TO THE TABBY? 
### 
The Stanford Daily has its semi-annual staff election tomorrow
to decide who will control its destinies for the rest of the year.
The new regime will take office a week from today. This
means that this is the last Monday tabloid section under the old
guard, and possibly the last Tabby of the year.
The new blood may not consider the Tabby worth contin
uing.
And if it does, it may be a radically changed Tabby. I think
the Tabby can stand radical changes. (The Tabby is not en
tirely alone in this.) Of course, our Monday effort hasn't en
tirely come up to our expectations. Where it should have been
hard and brittle, it frequently has been diffuse. Where it was
meant to be pointed, it ended in being vague. Oftentimes the
Tabby seemed that it was just about to go somewhere, but
couldn't quite get off. But just the same, I think it had some
good stuff in it, whether anybody read it or not.
This ivy-walled and moose-covered campus has witnessed
many a fine old periodical effort that has slipped and fallen, not
because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't good enough, or
the campus wasn't good enough. There was the old Stanford
Lit, and the Criteria, and undoubtedly the brightest light of all,
The News. In such fast company The Tabby probably does not
deserve to place; yet it has its function; if it did not fill it, it was
our fault. If it cannot justify itself in the future, it deserves to go.
A lot of us put a slug of time into working it out, and many
were the times when it looked as if it wouldn't work out. I want
to thank Harrison Standley for his competent linoleum chisel
ing, Bob Eisenbach for his picture snapping, Dick Hodgson for
his editorial snapping, Margaret Loud and Dave Botsford for
their feature sniping.
And now, while the mood is on us, may we all bow our
heads briefly while I tap out this simple requiem: Last
Daily staff meeting of Volume 90 will hold itself in The
Daily shack this afternoon at 1:15. Arrive early. Curtains
for everybody.
