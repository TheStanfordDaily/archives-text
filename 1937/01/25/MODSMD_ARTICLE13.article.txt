# Scarlet Women? Just Red Undies
## 
### 
When it's 50 degrees, or may
be even 40, Stanford women
prefer silk wikies to woolens.
But when the thermometer
drops to 32 degrees or less, com
fort takes precedence over class,
and red underwear replaces
scanties.
According to an unofficial
survey, Palo Alto stores are
cleaned out of red underwear,
sold mostly to Stanford women.
Co-ed engineering students
have been forced to them. Men
classmates only know what they
see, of course, but they declare
they have seen the two top but
tons and are satisfied.
Both men and women stu
dents surveying polygons _ncar
the Ryan Lab get so cold they
have to use both hands to ad
just their transits.
