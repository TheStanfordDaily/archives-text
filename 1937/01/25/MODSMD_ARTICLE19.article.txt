## 
### HARRY PRESS 
The Farm's Class of '40 can well he proud of (hat select few which
represent it on the hardwood floor of haskelball pavilions. To date, frosh
hoopsters have a perfect average: six games played; six games won. Latest
victories for the Encinamen were those of this week-end: Lowell was taken
down 32-23, and tlie St. Mary's freshman live was knocked down. 55-40.

' Against Lowell, the frosh weren't
quite up to their usual stellar game
of fast breaks and faster passes. Wild
heaves seemed to predominate the
first half. In the opening period, the
only player on the floor who was
really a basketball player was Leon
Lafaille, who made full use of his
ability as a dead-eye from the cor
ners of the court to ring up 10 points.
Leading at half time, 18-11, the
frosh poured on the heat during the
second period to move steadily
ahead. The only outstanding thing
in the whole game was Stanford's
tight defensive work, which held Don
Burness, hailed as San Francisco's
outstanding prep hoopster, to four
points.
The St. Mary's game was just as
fast and exciting as the Lowell game
was slow and dull. The Gaelets mov
ed out like a whirlwind into a lead
of 6-1 before the frosh could even
get a play working. Anderson and
Lafaille soon found the hoop, and the
score wavered back and forth from
one team to the other.
During the first half, the St. Mary's
team was represented by a certain

Mr. Feeney, who accounted for ex
actly 17 of his team's 23 points in
that period. That monstrous total
put the Gaelets out in front, 23-21,
when the half-time gun thundered
through the Pavilion:"
The positions of the two teams
were reversed during the second pe
riod, every one of the Encina men
coming through to ring the bell.
Staehle led the way with ten mark
ers;
Following are the summaries for
the two games:
