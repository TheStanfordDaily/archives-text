# Stanford Pitches Birthday Ball At Polio
## 
### MARGARET LOUD 
| iF THE hundreds of President's
Birthday Balls to be held in the
United States next Saturday, Stan
lord's is the only one managed and
sponsored by four former polio suf
ferers who not long ago regained
their health at the Warm Springs
Foundation in Georgia.
Because the proceeds of the Presi
dent's balls benefit that institution,
which attempts to stamp out infantile
paralysis, Boyd White, Ralph Keat
ing, Don Muni, and Lewis Hanchett
who have been patients thei'e and
have known Roosevelt personally,
are the committee for the dance.

Of tlit? four, Boyd While is the
only one confined to a wheel chair—
but that, will not keep him away
from a party that makes money for
Warm Springs, where he lived from
1920 to 1934 when he enrolled here.
He has watched many Tovon
dances from his chair—and enjoys
them almost as much as if he were
on the floor.
On the Quad and in the libe, where
he makes his wheels do as well as
legs, he is a familiar sight. A B-plus
-tudent, Boyd is also a member of the
debate team.
Ralph Keating, who with White is
co-chairman of the ball, has been I
busy the last few days trying to find j
a satisfactory way to distribute the
17 door prizes on Saturday night.
A patient at Warm Springs from
1929-31, he now makes his way eas
ily around the campus with the aid
of a cane. Last spring, he started a
-mall moving company that took i
crunks of vacation-bound students to
'he railway station.
Don Muni from San Francisco, a
Theta Chi, is the third member of
the committee. For two years ho
»vas at the polio foundation in Geor
gia, but now he is completing a
:ourse in econ.
l/cwis Hanchett is president of the
Fiji house. Hp contracted infantile
paralysis at Yale in 1932, spending
he two following winters at Warm
Spt ings. Hanchett is studying law.
Vassar Granddaughters — students
whose mothers or grandmothers are
laughters of the Alma Mater, re
cently met at the Alumnae House at
Vassar College. This meeting carried
a tradition started in 1893.
