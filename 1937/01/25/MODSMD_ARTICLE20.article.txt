# Baseball Squad Takes San Jose In 5-4 Thriller
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base
ball nine provided one of those
storybook comebacks last Saturday
afternoon in defeating San Jose
State, 5-4, on the Sunken Diamond.
Going into the last of the seventh
inning on the short end of a 4-0 score,
third baseman Leonard Linde reach
ed first on an error, Dick LaFranchi
and Leo Heagerty walked, and Linde
and LaFranchi scored on Pitchers
Ray Weiershauser's infield hit. Re
lief Pitcher Howard Paine breezed
through* the eighth and ninth inn
ings without a man reaching first.
Then in the last of the ninth Stanford
turned on the power.
LaFranchi again walked. Dick
Hanna was hit by a pitched ball, and
Paine singled to left, scoring La-
Franchi. Then Tony Calvelli, pinch-
Vitting for Bennett McGuire, came
mrough with a hit between short
and third, which scored Hanna with
the tieing run, and Dick Tarn hit a
twisting roller to shortstop. The
throw from short to first drew the
latter fielder off the bag, and Paine
scored without a play being made
on him. All of this action occurred
with two out.
Up to the hist innings the San Jose
team displayed a lightning fast in
field, whose three double plays
stifled earlier scoring chances for the
local team. LaFranchi, with two sin
gles and two walks, led the batting
attack. The Stanford infield of liol
man, Tam, Farrell, and Linde looked
good. The San Jose club was limited
to four hits by the three Stanford
hurlers, all of whom displayed ex
cellent control.
