# Saturday's Kisses -Monday's Colds
## 
### 
Monday's colds are the result
of Saturday's kisses, says Dr.
Adolph J. Roth, professor of
bacteriology and public health
at Washington State College.
Stressing the fact that there
are always more colds and flu
on Monday morning, Dr. Roth
declared that students do not
avail themselves of available
health knowledge.
In making this statement, Dr.
Roth is in agreement with Dr.
Ralph Hendricks, of Spokane,
who recently recommended that
wearing of long woolen under
wear for flu prevention during
the winter.
