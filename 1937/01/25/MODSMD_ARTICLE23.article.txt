### PHIL KLAUBER 
Wafting its way two more opponents with machine-like preci
sion, Coach John Runn's undefeated Stanford basketball varsity polished
off California 51 -35 in Berkeley Friday, and then made a home showing
Saturday night by defeating St. Mary's, 50-2:}.
The California tussle, played before a greater-than-capacity audience of
'SflOO persons, was marked with steady, conservative lloor play and accurate

shooting, somewhat of a surprise
hose who expected almost anything
to break loose as a result of last
week's justified and unjustified;
newspaper build-up.
Luisctti Sounds Warning
Hank Luisetti as usual opened the |
scoring for Stanford with a stolen j
pass, and Stoefeu too tanked one be- j
lure Balsley rang one for the Bears.
Stanford then seemed to score at will '
when they possessed the ball, but \
California's guard control system of'
calming down the game succeeded in
keeping the ball enough of the time
to keep within IS points of Stanford
tor the first 12 minutes.
Luisetti then began to move and
tanketi. three that helped put the 1
score out at 24-14 as the half ended, j
Duffy and Hilisman had replaced i
David and Herwig of California with
instructions to speed the game up, |
which change was to Stanford's ad- !
vantage.
Lee. Calderwood Shine
Bebe Lee replaced Moore during
the latter part of the game, and
paired with Calderwood to recover a !
great many rebounds. With Luisetti !
and Turner both accurate in the sec- j
ond half, the score reached 4(5-22 at j
one time, after which Hilisman and!
Balsley scored rapidly to close it to
19-31. Quade, the Zonne brothers, |
nd Robertson went in to finish the •
game for Stanford.
Luisetti led tHe scoring with 22,
f'om all angles and distances, while
Balsley was high for California with
15. six field goals swished from sur
prisingly far out.
The St. Mary's game Saturday
might have been a dud; Bill Hock
well. star Gael forward, was unable
to play because of the flu, while
Howell Turner and Phil Zonne of:
Stanford were on the sidelines with a j
.sprained arch and a boil, respectively. .
Reservfc Squad
But John Bunn started a reserve I
team of Quade, Robertson, Bob
Zonne, Lee, and Heath. These boys, I
with Quade having a good night, got •
themselves leads of 8-3 and 13-15, [
nly to have Andersen of the Gaels i
l> ;id his team, back to an 18-13 mar- j
i.. Luisetti, Stoefcn, and Calder
wood went in for Stanford and ;
pushed the score to 18-1G at half j
time.
The second half saw a Stanford i
team of Luisetti. Stoefen, Quade,
Captain 'Moore, and Calderwood
really put on a show in scoring 34
points while St. Mary's scored 5.
Stanford fans were treated to their
best game of the week-end ;it this
point, with the ball rapidly changing
hands and plenty of action under the j
buckets.

Art Stoefen led the scoring with
12, while Quade, 11, and Luisetti, 10.
both topped the Gael's best, who was
Laird, with !).
Phil Zonne will be ready to return
to practice today, but preliminary
observations of Turner's sprained
arch, incurred late in the California
game, reveal at present that Howie
has an outside, but only an outside
chance, of playing against U.S.C. in
Los Angeles next Friday and Satur
day nights. The Trojans, like Stan
lord, arc undefeated in conference
play.
