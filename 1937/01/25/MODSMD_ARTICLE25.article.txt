# Card Ruggers Swamp Medic School, 34-0
## 
### 
Showing greatly improved form
over that of a week ago, the Stan
lord rugby team Saturday swamped
the Stanford Medical School 34-0.
The Medics, playing their first game
of the season, were unable to come
near the Indian goal line.
High spot of the game came just
before the end of the first period.
Kirl Schaupp, Cardinal scrum half,
pulling a pretty dummy play, went
around the blind side of the scrum
and ran 50 yards for a try.
The first score of the game was
made by Doc Luckett after a good
run by Captain Joe Vigna. Wayne
Richardson, lock, converted. Soon
after, Marvin Taylor made a try,
bringing the score to 8-0. Then
Luckett again ran across with
Richardson converting. A little later
Schaupp made his spectacular run,
making the score at the end of the
first half 16-0.
First score of the second half was
made by Vigna on a pass from Luck
ett. He then converted to put the
Indians 21-0 over their Medical
brothers. Another try by Vigna
