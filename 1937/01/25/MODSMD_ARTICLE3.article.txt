TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

labor is coming to believe that it will

be unsafe so long as the agencies and
vast power of the state remain in the
hands of those whom it considers
(rightly or wrongly) to be its class
enemies. To this feeling in so far as
it exists in California, Mr. Cato and
his red flag boys undoubtedly con
tributed their share. 'It did happen
in Salinas" but "It shall not happen
again" says labor. To this end a San
Jose labor leader announced recently
that from now on he is going to be
what conservative labor men call a
"red agitator" and furthermore that
he is going to be "a damn good one."

who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in

TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

labor is coming to believe that it will

hands of those whom it considers

enemies. To this feeling in so far as
it exists in California, Mr. Cato and
his red flag boys undoubtedly con
tributed their share. 'It did happen
in Salinas" but "It shall not happen

Jose labor leader announced recently
that from now on he is going to be
what conservative labor men call a
"red agitator" and furthermore that
he is going to be "a damn good one."

might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.

technological unemployment. As a

vance each worker is able to produce

TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

labor is coming to believe that it will

be unsafe so long as the agencies and
vast power of the state remain in the
hands of those whom it considers
(rightly or wrongly) to be its class
enemies. To this feeling in so far as
it exists in California, Mr. Cato and
his red flag boys undoubtedly con
tributed their share. 'It did happen
in Salinas" but "It shall not happen
again" says labor. To this end a San
Jose labor leader announced recently
that from now on he is going to be
what conservative labor men call a
"red agitator" and furthermore that
he is going to be "a damn good one."

ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
Introduction to Social Problems II
learn (I hope) that the output per
man hour increased 11 per cent
from 1899 to 1919, but from 1919 to
1929, a period only half as long, pro
duction per man hour increased 53
per cent. Walter Polakov estimated
in 1935 that since 1929 enough tech
nological advance had occurred so
that seven million workers then
could produce as much as ten million
workers in 1929. Lewis Corey has es
timated that even at the height of the
coming boom there will be about
seven million unemployed. To this it
might be objected that Polakov is a
technocrat and Corey a conununist.
Both of these are highly disputable
points, but suffice it to say that even
if they were true what is needed is
not a calling of names but a refuta
tion of facts. A spectre is haunting
labor, the spectre of unemployment,
and labor is waking up.
The organizational gains of labor
during the last few months under the
aegis of C. I. O. leadership have been
tremendous, but far more important
than this is the fact that labor is be
ginning to think of itself as a class.
If proof were needed of this one has
only to cite the tretichency of labor
terminology. "Fink" and "scab."' of
course, are old terms of opprobrium
but increasing is the use of "stool
pigeon',' "stooge," "fink boss," and of
the terms "we" and "they" in their
most significant sense.
A New American Socialism?
From this growth of class feeling
we may expect two inevitable conse
quences — the emergence of a new,
more radical labor policy and the
entry of labor into politics. Tradi
tionally, the philosophy of American
labor lias been capitalistic in eon
tent. Labor has had no intention of
overthrowing the system. In so far as
it has been antagonistic to capital at
all, it is only in the sense that each
has been trying to grab as large a
share as possible of the output of the
system at any given time. The craft
unions have not differed materially
in their philosophy from United
States Steel. They have tried from
time to time by intensive organizing
campaigns to secure a monopoly of
their product, which in their case
happened to be a particular type of
labor power. With a monopoly of
their commodity it was a simple mat
ter to raise the price by restricting
the output. Which is what Mr. Veb
len called sabotage.
Recntly, however, labor has shown
a disposition to recognize that it is
not curtailment of output but expan
sion and planning of ptvduction
which is identical with labors wel
fare. Mr. Lewis is beginning to talk
about our unused productive capac
ity and its sabotage by management,
of the need for more shoes, bread,
spectacles, tricycles, and of the need
of a planned economy. In short,
American labor is making timid, hes
itant and indirect approaches to what
may turn out to be an American type
of socialism.

TOHN LLEWELLYN LEWIS may
begin the organization of 30 mil
lion unorganized workers, maritime
strikes may paralyze the West coast
shipping industry for 90 days, Fas
cism can rear its ugly head in Salinas
with Colonel Henry Sanborn self
appointed co-ordinator as the Amer
ican version of Nazidom's great, but
apparently only the organization of
the local mop squad can arouse the
interest of the Stanford body politic
in the present labor turmoil. Just
why this is so it is difficult to say.
Perhaps the populace has been lulled
to sleep by the middle class pros
perity, or on the other hand perhaps
they never were awake at all. Few
if any paid heed when Professor
Thompson suggested in these col
umns last fall that the movement
taking place at present in American
labor organization possessed far
more significance for the future of
America than the then current elec
tion jamboree. At any rate, there is
a marked absence here of the shrill
yapping about labor problms which
resounds in the halls of Eastern col
leges.
American labor is growing mili
tant. Some time la; 4 spring President
Nicholas Murray Butler announced
in the course of a commencement ad
dress that what we needed was a re
turn to morality and forget this
loose talk of an imaginary and chi
merical class struggle in America. No
one in his right senses could very
well dispute the need for a return to
morality in America. But it is some
what more difficult to agree with Dr.
Butler's description of the class
struggle in America as imaginary and
chimerical. At the turn of the cen
tury Samuel Gompers could an
nounce that there were no classes in
America with a fair certainty that he
would be heard by his followers and
believed. There were workers, of
course, Mr. Gompers admiHed, and
there were employers, but they were
all Americans first and in this vast
bed of patriotism capital and labor
might lie down together knowing
their interests were identical. That
might have been good rhetoric and
even good logic in 15)00. but any labor
leader seeking to hearten his cohorts
by such words in 1937 would be more
apt to receive 16 boos and the Bronx
cheer. His hearers might even be re
minded of a little song the soldiers
sang during those glorious days when
America was manifesting her destiny
in the Philippines. It ran something
to this effect:
He may be- a buddy of William H.
Taft
But he ain't any buddy of mine.
The doughboy was thinking of the
Filipino but the American worker
would probably have another indi
vidual in mind.
Causes Deeply Rooted
Superficially the, current furor
seems to revolve about the burly
and capable 235-pound frame of
John L. Lewis and the Committee for
Industrial Organization. And there is
no doubt too that the American labor
movement has received a certain in
spiration from the Man of the En

chanting Smile. But in reality the
causes of the present turmoil are
rooted deep in the very nature of the
American economic system. It is now
platitudinous to suggest that during
the last hundred years extensive and
profound changes have taken place
in our productive mechanism. It is
commonplace to designate such
changes by the name of technological
progress. No prof is needed of that.
What concerns us here is to point out
the particular significance of such
changes for labor.
Most important, of course, is the
fact that technological advance has
led to large scale production. A direct
corollary of this increased plant size
and corporate ownership is the tend
ency of the individual small scale en
trepreneur to disappear from our
midst. He is obviously unable to
compete with the super efficiency of
the mass production establishment.
Even in the tield of retail merchan
dising which is (aside from agricul
ture) the last stronghold of the in
dividual entrepreneur, the large
number of yellow, orange and black,
and mottled front stores testify to
the desperate struggle he is having
for existence. In 1820, 80 per cent of
the non-agricultural gainfully em
ployed might be classified as indi
vidual entrepreneurs. That is, they
derive their living from the opera
tion or management of tools of pro
duction of which Ihey were individ
ual owners. In 1935 only 12 per cent
of the gainfully employed owned

their independent means of exist
ence, and the other 88 per cent were
constrained to sell their services to
those few who did own the means
of production. In other words, they
have joined what Comrade Karl
Marx would have called the "ranks
of the proletariat."
With Potent Results
It is true that the word "prole
tariat" and all that it connotes have
little meaning in America. And it is
equally true that a vast psycholog
ical gap persists in the minds of a
great portion of the 88 per cent be
tween their conception of their role
in society and their actual condition.
This is especially true of the salaried
white collared class who grasp des
perately to the social prestige ac
corded by their position and of con
sequence have shown a great reluct
ance to fraternize with the horny
handed legions. But it would be folly
to deny that the economic basis for a
potent labor movement has been laid
in America and to turn one's eyes
from the consequences is only to be
have like the proverbial ostrich.
Mechanized production has had
another result. No longer is it the
skilled craftsman, but rather the man
who squeezes a lever 15 times a min
ute, who occupies the position of
strategic importance in American in
dustry. Hence the gigantic battle
which is being waged at present by
the titans of labor. William Green,
president of the American Federation

>f Labor, is a craft unionist and the
A. F. ol' L. is based upon craft prin
ciples. Under this philosophy there
might be within a given plant unions
of welders, painters, plumbers, up
holsterers, and bricklayers. To this
John L. Lewis, head of the United
Mine Workers, replies that in the first
place increasing mechanization of in
dustry is relegating the skilled
craftsman to the limbo of unimport
ance, and secondly that labor or
ganized upon the craft principle will
never be able to present a united
front against capital. Industrial un
ionism of the workers of each in
dustry organized into one big union
is, according to Lewis, the appropri
ate form of labor organization in a
corporate mass productive mechan
ized society.
Labor Is Waking Up
Finally, there is the element of
technological unemployment. As a
consequence of technological ad
vance each worker is able to produce
more in less time, and the corollary
of that, of course, is that industry
needs fewer workers. Students in
