# SO THE CAMPUS MAY READ
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
'pOMOdKOW morning the photos
of two Dailymen will smile out
at you from the front page of this
newspaper. They will smile because
the photographer told them to, not
because they are happy.
For tomorrow afternoon, about 3
o'clock. Bob Eisenbach and Dick
Hodgson will no longer be associate
editors of the Daily. One will have
become editor. Volume 91. The other,
a member of that noble and stoic
group — "I was once an associate
editor."
Daily elections occur on the two
most important days of the year to
those who devote themselves "so the
campus may know." And tomorrow
is*one of them.
Dave Allison, A.S.S.U. election
chairman, will come over to the
Daily shack after lunch with a pad
locked green box under his arm,
watch it from 1 until 3 o'clock while
23 staff voters drop in their choices
for the next editor. He will then
tabulate the votes, notify Editor Jor
gensen who is to succeed him.
Meanwhile, around a large oval
table in the Old Union will sit the
present Editorial Board. Checking
and rechecking, arguing and reargu
ing, they will finally decide just who
rt the present staff should be pro
moted to more advanced positions.
Then, about 4:00, the entire stall
will push its way up to the Daily
bulletin board, see for themselves
who will run the Stanford Daily,
from the editor on down, for the next
four months.
What goes on in the Daily shack
throughout the year—the selection of
a staff, the work of that staff to re
cord campus life, to entertain and
instruct its readers is carried on in
counterpart, with essential differ
ences, ;>t the Stanford Chaparral next
door, and in the rough-hewn offices
of the Stanford Quad across the
street.
Publications at Stanford affect
more students than any other activ
ity. On the Daily are over 100 edi
torial and business staff workers;
various positions on Chappie are till
ed by almost 50; and the yearbook

, occupies 40. And directly affected.
I theoretically at least, are the 4000
i campus readers of the three publica
| tions.
As a rule, school publications ben
efit or suffer, as the case may be.
' from censorship. Sometimes they
! are under the eye of a faculty "ad
j viser"—other times they are actual

products of classes in journalism. But
at Stanford, except in rare cases, Ad
ministration censorship is unknown.
As long as they maintain a certain
degree of "good taste," Daily editors
may print anything they think quali
fies as campus news, Chappie editors
may print anything they think quali
ties as humor, and Quad editors may

print anything.
The fact tluit Stanford is a private :
university, exempt from political j
prejudice and restriction, probably!
accounts for this fact. Unlike edi- J
tors at many a state university, Stan
ford editors have little fear of an I
Administration kick-in-the-pants.
The editorial side of a campus pub

lication is fairly well known. Fresh
men take up the work because the ;"
like it, because they find it the mot:
purposeful extracurricular activity.
Some work up to executive position;
to write what the campus reads.
But when it is observed that Th:-
Daily is becoming a "shopping new>
or that the Chappie is more of an ad
catalogue than a humor magazine,
readers are liable to forget that even
a college publication needs money to
make it go.
Over a counter of the Daily busi
ness department goes the most publi
cation money at Stanford. Last year
—for various reasons an. off-year—
the $24,625 income did not quite cov
er costs. A loss of- $240 was chalked
up, the first loss in many a year.
When there is a profit, the first $1000
is divided up between the improve
ment fund, the business manager,
the two editors, managing editors,
and women's editors. These three
editorial executives are paid — six
are salaried on the business staff.
The Daily's main income is dis
lay advertising ($16,000) though its
share of the community fees amounts
to almost $8000.
Next in financial imortance is the
Qvad, whose $18,600 income in 1936
was $2000 above expenses. Advertis
ing here is a minor source of income,
less than $3000. Sales amount to
$9000, while receipts from organiza
tions and living groups was $3500.
Fees charged for pictures netted
$1850. Sixteen hundred of the $2000
prot went to the Quad fund and the
six major executives, over and above
their regular monthly salaries.
Chappie — run by Hammer and
Coffin Society and not under the Stu
dent Manager's direct surveillance as
are the Daily and Quad —made the
most money last, year, though its in
come was smallest, about $10,000.
The manager got 45 per cent of a
$2,200 profit, the editor 15 per cent.

and the building fund the rest.
One reason for the Daily's high
cost is printing. Printed by the
Stanford University Press, expense
for this item alone ran up to $17,500
—$110 per four-page edition. This is
one of the highest prices on the
Coast, the U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin pay
ing but $65 per four-page paper.
Co-ordinating the three campus
i publications is the Publications
| Council. Whenever a matter of mu
: tual concern arises, the editors and
managers, with Student Manager
Fontius and Professor of Journalism
Chilton R. Bush, talk it over. The
j Council has been inactive this year,
but last year solved the problem of

| the Stanford Dividex which, they
| thought, was cutting into their ad
i vertising revenues. The Divide*
' now splits its profits with the Daily,
! Chappie, and Quad.
So Stanford publications is really a
$50,000 a year industry in itself, en
trusted to students as an extracur
ricular activity. Meanwhile, Hodg
j son and Eisenbach will tonight take
! in a movie together, try to forget that
j after tomorrow one will be Daily
editor, one won't.
