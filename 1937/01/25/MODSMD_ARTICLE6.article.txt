# WATCHING THE WAR CLOUDS GO BY

### WARREN BREED 
Warren Breed, tired of seeing the
outside world through the eyes of
Stanford professors, decided to see
for himself. Here is a part of what
he learned on a round-the-world
tour—the first of a series. The Ed
itor.

By WARREN BREED

AIUSSOLINI is very fond of plas
tering his pictures and mottoes
on blank walls of Italian towns. His
favorite one, besides hi.s own fero
cious mug, is the ominous Caesar
like slogan: credere, obbedere, com
bat tere.
We saw it many times while pok
ing through Italy last fall. It means
this: believe, obey, fight.
Believing, obeying, fighting- that is
what the Duce and the rest of the
dictators in Europe must require as
a matter of policy of their people.
Fighting at first glance strikes you as
the worst of the trio, but after a
little thought it chills you to realize
that the first two steps of believing
and obeying are equally terrifying to
us, imbued with the democratic
spirit.
For it means that while the dicta
tors continue to control army, news
papers. offices, and national glamor,
what they say goes. What the people
think doesn't go: it is so much chaff
gone with the wind. If a dictator
wanted to go to war, he'd just have
to say the word and we'd have one.
Hitler Likely W.ir-M.ikcr
And who is undoubtedly the most
likely to call on this war? Adolf Hit
ler The CiciTran who has ol'ien been
called insane, as well as a beer-hall
demagogue, tub-thumping rabble
rouser, turncoat and rog\ie, ;md
whose every day is an exercise in
mobilize 1 nationalism. If Hitler
want: a war, there will be one only
knocking about Germany for a while
yourself will make you see what
complete authority is hi.s word.

Germany is the most truculent of
the three nations that are classed as
the "have-nots," who crave more
land for their ovorpopulated coun
tries, more resources and raw mate
rials and, as fervently, power and
glory. Germany, Italy and Japan—
these three are the world powers who

! yearn to expand and be higher world
powers. They are individually prim
ing for offensives, and thus are the
! ones who might raise the lid of the
world's war chest.
The people we talked to over
I there said they wouldn't want to go
