# WATCHING THE WAR CLOUDS GO BY

### WARREN BREED 
Warren Breed, tired of seeing the
outside world through the eyes of
Stanford professors, decided to see
for himself. Here is a part of what
he learned on a round-the-world
tour—the first of a series. The Ed
itor.

By WARREN BREED

AIUSSOLINI is very fond of plas
tering his pictures and mottoes
on blank walls of Italian towns. His
favorite one, besides hi.s own fero
cious mug, is the ominous Caesar
like slogan: credere, obbedere, com
bat tere.
We saw it many times while pok
ing through Italy last fall. It means
this: believe, obey, fight.
Believing, obeying, fighting- that is
what the Duce and the rest of the
dictators in Europe must require as
a matter of policy of their people.
Fighting at first glance strikes you as
the worst of the trio, but after a
little thought it chills you to realize
that the first two steps of believing
and obeying are equally terrifying to
us, imbued with the democratic
spirit.
For it means that while the dicta
tors continue to control army, news
papers. offices, and national glamor,
what they say goes. What the people
think doesn't go: it is so much chaff
gone with the wind. If a dictator
wanted to go to war, he'd just have
to say the word and we'd have one.
Hitler Likely W.ir-M.ikcr
And who is undoubtedly the most
likely to call on this war? Adolf Hit
ler The CiciTran who has ol'ien been
called insane, as well as a beer-hall
demagogue, tub-thumping rabble
rouser, turncoat and rog\ie, ;md
whose every day is an exercise in
mobilize 1 nationalism. If Hitler
want: a war, there will be one only
knocking about Germany for a while
yourself will make you see what
complete authority is hi.s word.

Germany is the most truculent of
the three nations that are classed as
the "have-nots," who crave more
land for their ovorpopulated coun
tries, more resources and raw mate
rials and, as fervently, power and
glory. Germany, Italy and Japan—
these three are the world powers who

! yearn to expand and be higher world
powers. They are individually prim
ing for offensives, and thus are the
! ones who might raise the lid of the
world's war chest.
The people we talked to over
I there said they wouldn't want to go

nut and fight again, and didn't think
here would be another war, even
hough headlines in the newspapers
on our table screamed about some
newly invented outrage conceived by
I he enemy nation. But of course the
people don't decide or even influence
thir country's course — what The
Leader says goes. And recent sayings
of The Leaders, backed up by recent
actions, bode no good for peace on
earth, good will among men.
And over here, thousands of miles
from the European tinder box, we are
worrying about being sucked into it
again—if and when it happens, of
course. To the consideration of the
next war as a whole, what the
United States does is of minor im
portance; to us, however, it is of
oh-so-great importance.
We just don't want to fight; we
would have everything to lose and
nothing to win, and nobody would
get what we lost; nobody wins in
wars these days.
Although the fascist revolution in
Spain is an ideal chance to start the
war, it doesn't look likely that the
war will rise directly out of it. The
countries, especially Germany, are
n't ready yet; they want to mass a
few thousand more planes, tanks,
regiments, and cannon around the
borders fust before they'll chance
having another Treaty of Versailles
rammed down their esophagus.
Besides, wars are not so lightly
entered into now as in the days be
fore 1914. The consequences are too
;ieat —even the x*evenge-vowing Hit
ler x - ecognizes that. It is a good sign
that in the past year or two we have
had a Europe bristling with factions
and ill-feeling that passed up inci
dents and series of incidents that
could just as well have called for a
showdown and popped ihe gun. War
ships from England, Germany,
France, Italy, and Russia have been
prowling around Spanish coasts and
off Spanish Morocco for weeks, skir
mishes have actually occurred and
have been reported, but still we find
Germany considering a trade agree
ment with France, the arch-foe. No,
no war for a while yet. Possibly,
Germany says, her four-year plan
for economic self-sufficicncy will be
completed in 1940.
So it seems to bo a matter of how
long the "have-not" nations can wait
before they doff the sweat-suits of
peace and leave France, Russia, or
England with no choice but to knock
the chip off their shoulders. If it
weren't for the fact that the "have"
nations are every bit as heavily
armed as the "have-nots," it might
be possible for the latter to bluff and
cow the former into losing face and
conceding them colonies to slake
their imperial thirst. But this initial
lust satisfied, how long would it be
before they would call for another
round? No, as long as the offensive
trio is in the one-track groove of
nationalism-plus-imperialism we can
expect unrest on the western front.
Now in case of a war you can't
always tell who will fight on whose
side but one thing we know: Ger
many and Russia will be on different
sides. Germany and Russia don't
mix. Fascists have hollered about the
Bolshevik menace and its planned
wox-ld-wide revolution for 15 years.

It is significant that most of the
American sympathy in the Spanish
war has been with the red govern
ment side; America, like Great
Britain, judges for herself that at
present the red menace is less threat
ening than the white menace. They
see that the white menace is not only
a war against communism, it is a
thinly-veiled war against democracy.
Russia also knows that raw-mate
rial-shy Germany co\ets Russia's
rich Ukraine district.
Allied with Russia is France, now
under a socialist-popular front gov
ernment. Allied with France is Great
Britain, for all practical purposes.
On the other side there is Germany
with Bulgaria and Hungary and the
Balkans in general as friends.
On the German line-up one would
expect the German fellow in big
time dictatorship, Italy, but Musso
lini is teetering. Mussolini isn't
fanatic enough to follow Hitler into
a war just for the ideals of fascism as
against the bolshevik menace. Nei
ther does he want to see Germany
absorb Austria and find dangerous
Nazis on his Alpine frontier. Musso
lini will go into the next war because
he figures he and Italy can get some
thing out of it. And he will team up
with the side he thinks will win—a
waiting game, the same as Italy
played in the World War.
He doesn't give a fig for fascist
ideals when they might conflict with
his "Queen of the Mediterranean*'
policy. And it is this pro-Italian
passive-fascism of Big Ben's that
makes Hitler see that Italy might be
an ally, and that it might not be an
ally. Such is Italy's key position in a
little balance of power.
Now just unofficially, this little
line-up of France, Russia, and Brit
ain opposed to Germany, the Bal
kans, and Italy would seem to be
fairly even. But with Italy leaning
toward England and France for pres
tige in the Mediterranean, it would
look like long odds against the Nazis,
ai.d would make Hitler think twice
before rushing into a war.
