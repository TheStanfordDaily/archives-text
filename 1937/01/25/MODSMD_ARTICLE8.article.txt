# DAILY ELECTIONS I HAVE KNOWN
## 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
'THE CAMPUS these days is not
interested in the fact that Hodge
is now combing his hair, that Eis is j
now shaving, but 1 can remember
I lie days when they used to have to
call in the whole Ad Building, Ex
Committee, Men's Council, and the
Girl Reserves to settle a Daily elec
tion.
The first quarter I came on the
staff, The Daily was still groggy from
the sensational Poker Trust affair.
Charging that staff elections were de
termined not by ballots or bullets,
but by the devil's pasteboards and
sinister gangsterism in the after
hours. Abe Mellinkoff, talented col
umnist, took his election before Ex
Committer. Schooled in Lincoln
Steffens, Bill Corbus and the com
mittee, broke the Poker Trust, ush
ered the talented columnist into
office.
That The Daily had learned its les
son well was shown in the next elec
tion, where Dick Strouse defeated
Bob Letts in a staff vote of 2(> to 19.
Because it was not a two-thirds vote,
the matter was t.ikcn to Publications
Council. Strouse. who was a Social
Science major, didn't stand a prayer
here, but it was appealed to Ex Com
mittee broke the Poker Trust, ush
count. It was suddenly discovered
the next day that a vote of six was
required to over-rule Publications
Council. By this time, the newly
elected members ol Ex Committi e
were in ottice, and Strouse couldn't
gel his six men.
Letts became editor, while th< di -
affected Strouse wandered oft and
I founded News, which was written m
I Time style, was the first paper on
| the campus to utilize news pictures,
I and proudly called it sell a bastard
I publication. News proceeded t<'
i make The Daily look illy, which it

I was.
The next grc.it slink came inune
j diately after. A1 Guerard, now rec
ognized as one of the bright light
among young authors, Jay Grave
last of the MellinkofT tradition, an.
Stan Beaubaire, inveterate Rail
Committeeman, ran against oac\.
other for editor.
Beaubaire got the necessary vote
to legally elect, except for a new pro
vision in the rules, which says th
matter of dirty Daily politics went t
Men's Council as an Honor Cod,
violation.
Men's Council believed Gueraid
and Graves, tossed out Beaubaire.
The next day Dr. Wilbur reviewed
the case, came across the fact that
the vigorous Guerard had taken out
five women Daily members in one
evening, decided that the graft was
too universal to be located, put
Beaubaire in as editor.
The next Daily election was com
paratively quiet, except for the fact
that Julius Jacobs, who was elected
editor, was conspicuously a friend of
Beaubaire. Defeated candidates
Chappell and Hamilton gave Damon
and Pythias many a look at the tra
ditional Daily banquet, but caused
only uneasiness on part of conquer
ing pair.
Since that time Daily elections
have been notoriously dull. Petty
chiseling and a tendency for every
one to try to be very nice to every
one else predominates. And now the
tradition is that the two candidates
attend a show together the night be
fore the election, a "precautionary
measure" only.
So wary has the staff become of
any hint of a machine, that the last
time an associate editor took out a
lady staff member within a month of
the election, he not only lost all the
other lady staff members' votes, but

men who had eyes on the lady, while
the lady herself split her two votes
equally between the candidates.
