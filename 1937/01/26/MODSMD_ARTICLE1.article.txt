# Women Oppose Cardinals' Plan For Queen Race
## Conference Disapproves of Popularity Contest; Decision To Be Given Ex Committee Tonight 
### 
Slapping Cardinals in their collective lace. Women's Conference .yester
day came out emphatically against the Cardinal-proposed contest for
Masque Ball king and queen.
Twenty-one representatives of campus women voiced their olTicial dis
approval of any queen contest involving either popularity or money, by a
14-17 vote.
Formulated last Wednesday by Cardinals, the plan comes up for Ex
Committee's consideration at ——
meeting tonight.

The proposed and opposed contest
was designed to do away with the
abuses present in former Conval
escent Home Drive contests. Instead
of letting the most money win, the
new "purified" contest would sell
chances and hold a drawing to deter
mine the winner.
Something of this sort is the only
type of contest possible, since Ex
Committee abolished the straight
buying of votes in the Masque Ball
race following the abortive vote
buying spree in last spring's con
test.
The Women's Conference's vote
against the Masque Ball contest is a
continuation of its policy of opposi
tion to popularity contests. Last
week it was Scabbard and Blade's
plan for an "honorary colonel" at
its annual winter formal that was
discarded in response to the women's
objections.
Cardinals will probably make ev
ery attempt to push their projected
contest through Ex Committee in
spite of objections of the Stanford
