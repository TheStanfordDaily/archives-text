## 
### 
The Minicam number of Stanford
Chaparral goes on sale tomorrow
morning on Quad corners. The price
is 15 cents; the cover is a candid
camera study of a girl drinking soup.
The interior features the whipped
cream and strawberries of the Farm's
photographic talent. Entries of the
camera contest sponsored by Chappie
are published, together with names
of winners.
Jack Scott kicks through with
"Phantasmagoria," which is self
explanatory. The biography of a
candid cameraman is exposed to the
critical eye by Bud Arnold; Tom
Fleming rejoins with a short insight
on human nature.
Far from the photographic Held
strays Dave Leff with his soul cry, j
' The Female of the Species," while
Hartmann (he of the Farm Fables) !
counters with the poem, "Langour." [
Old Boy Oilman Gist writes Little
Pop Off for the second time, in which
the small redskin flights a siege with
influenza at the local hogan of health, j
Jorgi and McKenna together draw
up the album of a Peeping Tom, the
former indicting conclusions for the
latter's camera shots.
