# Wilbur Advocates Venereal Control
## 
### 
Compulsory treatment and con
trol of venereal diseases was advo
cated by President Ray Lyman Wil
bur in a speech before Bay Region
leaders who met in San Francisco
Saturday to organize the American
Society for the Control of Venereal
Diseases. Dr. Russell V. Lee, asso
ciate professor in the medical school,
also spoke.
In his speech, Dr. Wilbur stressed
the fact that over half a million per
sons are infected by syphilis every
year and that nothing definite has
been done about it.
"If it were leprosy we would act,
and still I would much rather have
leprosy than syphilis," he said. Ta
boos on the subject of syphilis have
been so strong we have failed to face
the situation.
"Syphilis is a long disease and it
takes time to cure. Meanwhile, ev
eryone in close contact with a syph
ilitic person is in danger.
Compulsory Cure Important
"Voluntary care is not suflicient.

It must be compulsory. The syphilis
germ has changed the course of his
tory. Now that drinking is increas-

ing. syphilis and gonorrhea are in
creasing. We could at least concen
trate on seeing that pregnant womer

are tested and given treatments so
that babies arc born alive and with
out this disease."
Dr. Lee, one of the leading organ
isers in the campaign, pointed out the
positive success of control measures
introduced in Sweden. There, the
annual number of cases was brought
from 9000 down to 100.
Public Education Needed
"Education of the public is the first
essential." he said. "Let every syph
ilitic know that he can be cured and
if necessary cured free of charge. Let
him know also that if he transmits it
he will be punished.
"It costs thr state two milli n dol
lars a year to care for the persons in
sane as a result of syphilis. This ex
penditure could he eliminated.
Local residents who were appoint
ed to the organization committee in
cluded: Dr. Lee. Mrs. Paul Eliel, Mrs.
Kathleen Norris, Kay Smith. Ren
Allen, Percy Pettigrew. of Palo Alto;
Mrs. E. K. Strong and Dr. W P.
Shepard of Stanford; and Ira Lil
