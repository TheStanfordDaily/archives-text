## Ex Committee May Ratify Reynolds' Decision 
### 
The special A.S.S.U. election call
ed next Thursday by Ex Committee
at its meeting last week was unoffi
cially cancelled by a group of student
leaders last night, according to
President Jim Reynolds.
Ex Committee will probably cancel
it officially when it meets tonight,
Reynolds said. The election was to
have put before the student body
three proposed amendments to the
A.S.S.U. Constitution.
The election was called off because
technical difficulties prevented it,
but Reynolds declared that the
amendments may be put on the reg
ular February ballot.
One proposed amendment would
have moved the regular May election
up to the second week in spring
quarter, thus giving newly elected
I officers a chance to learn their du
i lies before assuming ihem the fol-
I lowing fall.
The other two amendments called
| for changing the number of Men's
! and Women's Council members
I elected in February and spring. With
three elected in February, instead of
in May, there would be more assur
ance that experienced members
j would return after summer vaca
! tion.
