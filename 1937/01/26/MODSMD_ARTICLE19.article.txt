Appearance in 40 films with Bill
Hart, gun-totin' hero of red
blooded dramas, made when the
movies were young and Westerns the
rage.
That's the record of Stanford's Bob
Presnell, psychology major.
Twenty years ago, when the great
Thomas Ince was making movies at
Incevillc, back of Santa Monica,
Presnel's father was one of his sce
narists. Young Bob. "from what I
hear, the only baby around who
didn't squawk his head off," was fre
quently called from his cradle to
serve art. He wasn't co-starred with
the principals, by any means; but
Hollywood depended on him to send
audiences home happy.
"There were always about 20 or
.'lO feet of film at the end of the pic
ture." he says. " 'Happily Married,
with Child.' That was me."
Although there was no such end
ing to the starkly realistic "The Fugi
tive," recently shown in connection
with the Mendelowitz "Motion Pic
ture" course, the film was the same
in general type as those Presnell
"acted" in.
