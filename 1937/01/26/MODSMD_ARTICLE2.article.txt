# Janitors Claim Credit for Raise
## Union Executive Orders Men To Stop Bickering 
### 
Instigation of the regional organi
zation of the janitors' union was re
sponsible for their recent $15 raise,
said Charles Hardy, addressing the
union meeting Sunday.
Hardy is the San Francisco execu
tive of Local 87. the organization to
which Stanford janitors belong.
In order to get the men a raise,
Hardy said that he spoke to the
American Building Maintenance
Corporation, holder of the janitorial
contract with the University. Hardy
told the company that the raise must
be granted, or he would take the
matter up with University officials.
Company executives said to wait
three days. Within that time, the
raise was granted.
Hardy condemned the bickerings
of janitors versus Manager Brown,
published lately in The Daily. "This
arguing back and forth won't help
any," he said. "I want you to obey
Brown's orders cheerfully, and if
there arc any small difficulties, don't
tell anyone but Brother Newcomb,
your president. We will settle things
quietly through the union."
Then, eyeing a great many copies
of The Daily which were lying on the
desk, he asked the men to stop telling
things to the students working on
the paper.
Twenty janitors attended Sun
day's meeting, and initiation of some
new members is planned for a meet
ing on February 7.
