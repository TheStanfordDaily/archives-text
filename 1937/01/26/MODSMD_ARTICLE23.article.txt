# Officers Plan Elaborate Ball
## Heche's Orchestra Will Play at Military Dance 
### 
Flashing sabers, immaculate uni- i
forms, and red, white, and blue dec
orations that fairly ooze patriotism (
will be the' distinguishing features i
of Scabbard and Blade's annual win
ter formal Friday ni^ht.
Big flags, little flags, and much j
bunting will decorate the Women's I
Gym for the affair, along with a j
lighting system more elaborate than j
any yet attempted at a campus j
dance.
Starting off with the traditional |
grand march, the couples will dance j
from 9 to 1 to the music of Gordy j
Heche's twelve - piece orchestra, j
which has been playing at the Pal- j
ace Hotel.
Entertainers will be Velma Brown, '
formerly of the Hollywood Cotton
Club; Dudley Nix, recently with
Tom Coakley and author of "So
Lovely and So Sweet"; and Owen J
Clark and Manville Petteys, stars of
last year's Gaieties.
One special feature, announces
Dance Chairman Dick McGowan,
will be a greatly improved speaker
system.
At $3 per couple, bids will be on
sale from 9 to 5 o'clock all this week 1
at the A.S.S.U. office and post office
corner.
