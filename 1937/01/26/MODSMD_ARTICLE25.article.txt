# Disease Adds To Horror In Ohio Valley
## Lack of Medical Stores Hinders Louisville In Attack by Epidemics 
### United Press 
Disease threatened today to super
sede water and fire as a menace to
life among (500.000 refugees in the in
undated areas of 11 states of the flood
ravaged Ohio and Mississippi Val
leys. At least 49 were dead.
Louisville, Ky., with 200,000 of its
360,000 inhabitants homeless and 25
square miles under water, fought ep
idemics with inadequate supplies of
medicine and its hospital facilities
overtaxed.
General Malin Craig, chief of stall
of the U. S. Army, warned a new
Hood is piling up in the headwaters
of the Ohio which will be felt in al
ready devastated down-river sections
in two or three days.
Government Aids
The United States government, di
rected from President Roosevelt's
desk, poured men, food and boats
into the flooded Ohio and Mississippi
valleys. It sent 25,000 CCC and 40,000
YVPA workers to the aid in rescue
and relief along the 1800-mile front.
All normal activities were sus
pended in Cincinnati, 0., and Louis
ville, Ky., the two major cities hard
est hit.
A crest of 80 feet, 30 above flood
stage, was expected at Cincinnati
within the next 3(5 hours. The water
supply was being rationed but, it
was believed, would not last more
than three days.
Fire Menace Grows
The hazard of fire became increas
ingly great at Cincinnati as water
pressure grew steadily weaker. A
blaze broke out in the exclusive
River View Apartments and firemen
had to lay hose half a mile to the
river.
Louisville was almost isolated, with
water and power lacking. Food was
running low.
School Children 111
Mounting cases of chicken pox,
measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, in
fluenza and pneumonia were report
ed. Two hundred children huddled
in a school building were reported ill.
Relief workers set up inoculation
stations in theaters, hotels and school
buildings crowded with refugees.
Authorities ordered the evacuation
of thousands from marooned cities
and towns, including 33,500 from Pa
ducah, Ky.: 10.000 from Wheeling
Island, W. Va., where the Ohio rose
again after a brief recession; 13,500
from Cairo, HI., menaced by both the
Ohio and the Mississippi, and 5000
from Portsmouth, O.
Evansville Evacuated
of Evansville, Ind., a
city of 100,000 population, was or
dered by National Guard headquar
ters at Indianapolis.
The Red Cross, with regional head
quarters at Huntington, W.Va.; Cin
cinnati. O.; Evansville, Ind., and
Memphis, Tenn., doubled its drive
for funds and asked four million
dollars to add to the one million dol
lars already appropriated.
