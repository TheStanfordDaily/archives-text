GLUG. GLUG. RIPPLE, KIPPLE

but before I go, I ought to make a j
few general observations from a i
thousand brawls on the subject. The
first is that tastes in music are like \
tastes in women, completely unex- j
plainable and absolutely unreason
able. If I didn't know too many
good guys who liked Eddy Duchin, I
might say that those people who like
the were just suckers for the !
sentimental. At that, the people who
swoon at the sound of Lombardo's
saxes and Garber's one-string gui
tar seem to be possessed with some
maggot of the brain which bores j
deeper and deeper into their mind!
and makes them more and more im- ,
pervious to reason.
The second observation starts with !
the idea that the truest believers in
any religion are the converts and j
ends with the notion that why most. i
hounds of hot are so sure they are,
God's elect is because they have real- j
ly seen The Light. Every Casa Loma
admirer and Goodman worshipper
has had his infant days of thinking
somebody like Fio Rito was just the
finest thing ever, and when anybody
finally gets to appreciate a Beider- i
becke chorus, there is no turning
back for him to the bear-grease mu
sic, unless it be to duck outside for ;
air when they hear Art Kassel "ut
terly charming and whimsical" J
music.
The final observation is merely a i
remark by the wayside to the effect j
that a use has finally been found for j
Shep Fields. Some announcer on an |
all-night program played some of j
Shep Fields' Rippling Rhythm and 1
then said that it reminded him that j
, he had forgotten to gargle.

Both the Whigs and the Tories
have come down to get me with
blackjacks for my late remarks
about popular music, and I see by
Friday's Daily that 1 should see a
music teacher.
1 especially appreciate the spirit in
which the advice was given, but re
turning to the serious study of music
means going back to a scene from
which I was routed with great
slaughter. My last public appearance
as a musician was when I toddled up
to play the Minuet in G for the Em
porium Boy's Achievement Club,
Piano Division. About the middle I
got stalled and after going back to
the beginning a couple of times, 1
managed to ride it out to end, but
that was no particular feat as com
pared to the accomplishment of an
other boy I heard of who got into
similar concert difficulties. He played
Sextet from Lucia half-way through
at a recital and changed into The
Flatterer, by Chaminade, from key
o! C to five flats, and he never lost a
beat. What elan!

All this is pretty much beside the
point. What bothers me is where the
two boys who wrote me the letter
got the idea that Shep Fields, Jan
Garber and Gershwin raised jazz
from a fad to a permanent and re
spected position in American music.
It may be possible that Gershwin
has done something to put popular
music in a swallow-tail coat, al
though I have always suspected that
Gershwin is where he is not on merit
but because Paul Whiteman has bal
lyhooed him into a national celebrity.
But as for their ideas about Shep
Fields and Garber, such palpable
nonsense! Garber is a weak imita
tion of Lombardo, so that Lombardo
is really earning Garber's pay check.
Credit might be given to Lombardo
were he not universally recognized
as popular music at its sloppy worst.
Shep Fields is a very recently recog
nized scourge, he being one of the
horrible relics left behind by Veloz
and Yolanda when they toured the
country. If he has raised popular
music to a point of permanence and
respectability, then it must be as
sumed that popular music was really
just a fad after all until a year or so
ago, when Shep Fields' Rippling
Rhythm descended upon us in a
shower of sappy gurgles and incon
sequential accordion trills.
Taking dance bands solely as or
chestras playing for dancing, the
most popular band is the one that
appeals to college students and flam
ing youth in general. And the band
which "raised jazz from a fad to a
parmanent and respected place in
American music" was the Casa Loma
Orchestra, which stomped around the
country playing one-night stands at
dance halls and college proms let
ting the people know that the best
popular music is not dished up with
a spoon.

So much for the facts. As for ar
guing about jazz and popular music,
I am about to give up the crusade,
