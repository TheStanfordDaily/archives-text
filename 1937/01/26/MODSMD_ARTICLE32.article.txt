# Daily's Star Reporters Count Up Year's By-Lines
## 
### 
As Volume 90 writes "30" on its
achievements, three dozen Daily
minions count their by-lines and
compare them with those of the rest
of the staff. (A by-line is ihe hand
some little slug of type at the head of
certain stories which advertises to
the civilized world who authored the
j article in question.)
Daily by-lines are given for two
i reasons. The first is to give the writer
j due credit for his work, if this is
j marked by any extraordinary effort I
or- originality. The second, as was
once well expressed by a night edi
| tor: "Yeah, give him a by-line. Why
j should the whole paper hang when
I he can hang separately?"
In the 00 issues of Volume 90 thus j
far printed have appeared 194 by- i
lines representing the work of 45 ;
staff members,

Far and away top man is Herb
Diamond, with 23 name slugs. Fol- i

The dozen mark was split again,
this time by John Rice and Hunter
Hendee; Sullivan and Margaret Loud
reached 11. Tim Hayes, Bob Eisen

and Dave Leff each made 10.
Volume 89 was further noted for
originality in monickers of its writ

As Volume 90 writes "30" on its
achievements, three dozen Daily
minions count their by-lines and
compare them with those of the rest
of the staff. (A by-line is ihe hand
some little slug of type at the head of
certain stories which advertises to
the civilized world who authored the
j article in question.)
Daily by-lines are given for two
i reasons. The first is to give the writer
j due credit for his work, if this is
j marked by any extraordinary effort I
or- originality. The second, as was
once well expressed by a night edi
| tor: "Yeah, give him a by-line. Why
j should the whole paper hang when
I he can hang separately?"
In the 00 issues of Volume 90 thus j
far printed have appeared 194 by- i
lines representing the work of 45 ;
staff members,
