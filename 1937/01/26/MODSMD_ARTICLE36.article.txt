# Bunn Prepares For U.S.C. Hoop Game
## Offensive Plays Prepared For Two Tilts in Los Angeles This Week 
### WALT PETERSON 
Although it is not quite certain yet
whether Howell Turner, dynamiting
forward who sprained a set of foot
arch ligaments late in the Cal game,
will !)(.> able to go with the team to
Los Angeles this week-end to play
against U.S.C., John Bunn opened
practice yesterday for the game
without figuring the collar-ad kid in
his offense scheme.

Still on crutches yesterday, the
ruddy-faced flash will probably be
out of action for several days more,
possibly until after the Troy battles.
If he is still unable to get around
Thursday he will not go to Los An
geles with the team.
Turner Might Go
If he is in shape by that time, Bunn
will take him along as just that
much more strength in his scoring
threat line.
As it is, the genial Kansan will
work both Phil Zonne and Captain
Dinty Moore in the forward spot
during the week, with an eye to pro
viding a little better reserve strength
than would be available without
Turner.
Moore Experienced
Moore played in one of the U.C.
L.A. games last year at forward,
shifting over from his guard position,
and scored three fast goals to pull the
game out of the fire.
The younger Zonne did not work
out last night, since he was still in

capacitated by a boil, but he will go
tonight, according to Bunn. He is in
fine shape otherwise, and will un
doubtedly be all set to play as well
as ever Friday and Saturday nights.
Quade Will Play
While Bunn will school both Moore
and Zonne in Turner's position, the
improved Bill Quade will start down
South, according to present plans.
For two years a steady reserve,
Quade has blossomed out with sev
eral flashy games this year, and j
looms stronger and stronger in his '
role.
Considering the two impending j
games with Sam Barry's boys as the j
toughest the Indians will have to 1
face in the run for the conference i
flag, Coach Bunn will point for these
two more than any others, with the !
possible exception of the second pair !
with Troy up here.

While Bunn will school both Moore
and Zonne in Turner's position, the
improved Bill Quade will start down
South, according to present plans.
For two years a steady reserve,
Quade has blossomed out with sev
eral flashy games this year, and j
looms stronger and stronger in his '
role.
Considering the two impending j
games with Sam Barry's boys as the j
toughest the Indians will have to 1
face in the run for the conference i
flag, Coach Bunn will point for these
two more than any others, with the !
possible exception of the second pair !
with Troy up here.
