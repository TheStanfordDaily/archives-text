## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday termed as "probably a good
move" the Senator Swing bill now
before the California legislature
which provides for the bai l ing of in
toxicating liquors at all public func
tions, including football games,
wrestling and boxing, horse racing,
and non-athletic activities.
Although favoring such a bill as a
California statute, President Wilbur
deemed as unnecessary any outright
prohibition on the indulgence of in
toxicants at Stanford - sponsored
functions, relying on the power of a
simpl" request from University
heads as sufficient to prohibit any
off-color actions.
The bill is related in part to the
request sent out by President Doods
of Princeton University before the
opening of the football season last
year, when he asked all those attend
ing Princeton games to refrain from
bringing liquor into the Tiger sta
dium. At that time President Wilbur
expressed himself as in favor of Dr.
Dodds' move.
