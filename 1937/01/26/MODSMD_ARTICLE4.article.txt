# Allen Defends Sequoia For Graduate Hall
## Single Room Possible Under Present Plan, Says Branner Leader 
### 
A new voice was added to the con
troversy over tli9 possible conversion
of Sequoia into a graduate men's hall
with the letter from Art Allen, presi
dent of Branner Hall, printed in to
day's Campus Opinion.
According to Allen's version of the
project, one problem is non-existent,
the other only partially so. Sequoia
eating club need not expire, but
would be continued as a eating group
for the graduates, and, he says, sin
gle rooms "would probably" be pro
vided for in the remodelling process.
Allen has led the campaigners for
special grad living quarters since its
inception at an Encina smoker last
December, when petitions were cir
culated and sent to the comptroller's
office.
That there might be some provision
made for the single rooms, which
others have declared so necessary for
graduate work, became more prob
able with Allen's statement that the
Administration might spend $50,000
on remodeling Sequoia.
The administration asserted that
no definite information could be re
leased until further investigation
could be made.
