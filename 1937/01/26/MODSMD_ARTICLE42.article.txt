# Templeton Plans Cinder Workout for Track Squad
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
If all goes well in the kingdom of
01' Jupe Pluvius, both varsity and
freshman track squads will be able
to work out on the cinders this
afternoon for the first time since last
fall.
Coach Dink Templeton's harriers
have been working for the past week
on the grass infield of Angell Field,
and consequently have not been able
to hold workouts in earnest.
Edson Burroughs, last year's ace
two-miler, took a lap on the grass,
testing the foot which he injured last
fall. He took his time, but limped j
perceptibly all the way around. He
has high hopes, however, of round- |
ing into shape pretty rapidly.
Coach Dink benignly supervised |
the goings on yesterday, sporting a j
pair of grey knickers with a pair of j
bright red stockings thrown in. He'

expects to start working the boys
with a vengeance as soon as the
track thaws out completely.
