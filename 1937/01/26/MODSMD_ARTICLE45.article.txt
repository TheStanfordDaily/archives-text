# Frosh Drill On Spot Shooting
## 
### 
With every man back in harness
except one, Mentor Wytze Gorter
I had his charges work out in every
j position during practice yesterday,
! giving his l'rosh basketballers the
I chance to get the "feel" of each spot
| on the floor.
Practically tearing the net off the
| hoop every time he shot, Bill Leckie
I gave every evidence of being back in
j shape after a long lay-off due to a
I sprained ankle. The only yearling
I still behind the eight ball is Bob
! Oakford. who is at present recuper
ating from a foul by the boogey-man,
flu.
I The Papooses, still undefeated after
j six games, meet San Francisco Jay
| see in the Pavilion Wednesday night.
