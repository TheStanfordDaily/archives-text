SAVED FROM
OBLIVION . . .
Yep, we're half done Twenty-five
games scheduled for the 1937 bas
ketball season, and 14 are gone al
ready. Will the other 12 or more go
as well? Will Coach John Bunn and
his boys earn that rare and coveted
record of an undefeated hoop sea
son? Will they continue on getting
50 points a game, and break that
63-30 mark right over Cal's noggin?
Or will they have the off night that
everyone is beginning to worry
about, just because the law of aver
ages threatens it?
San Francisco is still wanting to
see the Stanford five perform in a
hall where there is enough room for
everyone to come and be com
fortable. With a team that seems to
be able to work up a score from any
floor, and with San Francisco known
to be a friendly audience, there
shouldn't be any argument about
talcing a chance. Why not do this:
wait until we make sure the U.S.C.
series goes favorably, and maybe as
long as the second Cal game. By that
time we ought to be way out in front
in both the U.S.C. and Cal series,
and maybe in Conference percentage,
too. These facts would boost the gate,
encourage the team members, and
produce need for practice on a
strange floor in preparation for a
possible Northern Division play-off.
Why not, in view of this, hold one
U.S.C. game and the last Cal game in
the Civic Auditorium?
Graven Dyer, golden penned L.A.
Times barker for the Scarlet and
Gold of U.S.C., says, "Wasn't that a
plaintive wail from Nibs Price rela
tive to his Bears being robbed down
here in the Trojan basketball se
ries? I saw Nibs out at Santa Anita
Saturday afternoon. Maybe that had
something to do with his sour dis
position . . . Nibs should be thank
ful his boys were not penalized 15

yards for clipping down here."
At the game Friday came indica
tions of some entrepreneur in the
Stanford Band—ably thought out and
executed was that drown-out come- j
back to Cal's waltz time "Come Join ■
. . I sat with Art Cohn of the
Oakland Tribune and we accompa- j
nied all songs in two-part. The dope
on Art Cohn seems to be this: He
was present, as were a number of
newspaper men, in the Stanford i
dressing room after the U.C.L.A.
game. John Bunn was giving his
views on Pacific Coast basketball in
general.
On leaving, Bill Leiser asked how
much of the talk was for publication,
to which Bunn answered none, and
proceeded to give his statement for
the press. The next day, though, Les
ter Grant of the Oakland Post-En
quirer ran the "clumsy cow" yarn
and Cohn came out with the "play
like California."
What a coach says in the dressing
room is not necessarily public read
ing matter. In fact, our grammar
school coach said things in the dress
ing room that weren't even lit for his
team to hear. Cohn, however, slip
ped loose that week. He came to the
Stanford locker room in Berkeley
Friday, and after a while effected an
agreement which seemed satisfact
ory to all present. The rest is all
hearsay, and everybody (I hope)

is happy.
Wytze Goiter has brought his '40
basketballers a couple of weeks into
the season undefeated, ainl from
their come-back habits they look like
they could finish that way. The last
three Frosh teams have been splen
did aggregations, but couldn't quite
hold up the undefeated record and
tension through to the end. Wytze,
old kid, if you pull it this year, you're
more than O.K. ... 1 imagine sev
eral people have called Prescott Sul
livan down for criticizing Leith and
Baillv tor wearing those posy green
refereeing shirts. Leith and Bailly,
who incidentally will work all Bay
Area Conference games this year, are
limited to those posy green shirts by
a new conference ruling.
Remember that Intramural basket
ball final last year when Kappa Sig
beat Breakers as a prelim to a varsity
game? We may hold a gala final
again this year, but what do you
think of another gala play-off that
has been suggested, Stanford Intra
mural Champs against U.C. Intra
mural Champs?
