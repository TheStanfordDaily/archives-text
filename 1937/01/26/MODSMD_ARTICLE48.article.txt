# Democracy

### 
When Bob Gros and Ex Committee decided
last year that the Masque Ball King and Queen
Contest would have to go because it was in
consistent with democratic traditions on the
Farm, many were the mutterings and murmur
ings and dire predictions that this would not
be the last of the story.
The dire predictions were right. Springing
full-armed from the head of the Olympian Car
dinals was the raffle plan proposed last week.
Women's Conference, declaring that Stanford
women do not want to be involved in popu
larity contests, batted down the encircling arms
yesterday. The next move is up to Ex Commit
tee.
It is no secret that principal opponent to the
Contest is the Administration, which fears most
of all the harmful publicity which it brings in
the City papers. Stanford gets an unfavorable
balance of trade in the newsprints because it
never has become used to playing cagey ball
on the newspaper man's terms. But that is no
reason why we should leave ourselves wide
open by encouraging trouble-brewing stuff on
the campus.
Just how conscientious the students are about
outside publicity is another matter. Students
are apt to think, as I do, that the unfavorable
publicity is not nearly as unfavorable as our
tetchy big-wigs feel it is.
Bringing it down to the students' angle, I feel
that the contest is harmful to the student body,
but not because of the publicity. Stanford
would have to sin quite considerably to over
come the favorable publicity that Don Lieben
dorfer and the B.A.C. football and basketball
players manufacture for us.
I think it is harmful because it is creating,
needlessly, artificial aristocracies. Many vir
tues are claimed for the raffle idea, but the fact
remains that it does involve a certain amount
of selection, and a certain amount of money
changing. I see little reason why Stanford has
to single out students to be kings or queens
for its dances. A dictator would be far more
up-to-date.
BUT, I don't expect anybody to agree with
me. That is due to the fact that we are con
ditioned in an environment which sees no harm
in sacrificing the whole for the part. America,
despite its vaunted democracy, still fawns at
the idea of noble lineage, of D.A.R.'s and badges
and orders of the this and that. Stanford, de
spite its vaunted democracy, still has its Phi Bete
aristocracy, Greek letter aristocracy, athletic
aristocracies, rah-rah Cardinal aristocracy, and
the various political aristocracies. I suppose it
is no more than right that we should continue
with our money and lock-out aristocracy. No
body seems to see any harm in it. Even the
guy that doesn't belong to one aristocracy or
another, doesn't seem to see anything debas
ing in his position. Everything would be all
right, if he could just get an "in" somewhere.
For one straight A scholar our educational
machine is willing to sacrifice 15 students to an
uncultured and barbaric life of futility and frus
tration. It isn t much wonder that the students
can't see anything inconsistent in the Masque
Ball King and Queen Contest.

tetchy big-wigs feel it is.
Bringing it down to the students' angle, I feel
that the contest is harmful to the student body,
but not because of the publicity. Stanford
would have to sin quite considerably to over
come the favorable publicity that Don Lieben
dorfer and the B.A.C. football and basketball
players manufacture for us.
I think it is harmful because it is creating,
needlessly, artificial aristocracies. Many vir
tues are claimed for the raffle idea, but the fact
remains that it does involve a certain amount
of selection, and a certain amount of money
changing. I see little reason why Stanford has
to single out students to be kings or queens
for its dances. A dictator would be far more
up-to-date.
BUT, I don't expect anybody to agree with
me. That is due to the fact that we are con
ditioned in an environment which sees no harm
in sacrificing the whole for the part. America,
despite its vaunted democracy, still fawns at
the idea of noble lineage, of D.A.R.'s and badges
and orders of the this and that. Stanford, de
spite its vaunted democracy, still has its Phi Bete
aristocracy, Greek letter aristocracy, athletic
aristocracies, rah-rah Cardinal aristocracy, and
the various political aristocracies. I suppose it
is no more than right that we should continue
with our money and lock-out aristocracy. No
body seems to see any harm in it. Even the
guy that doesn't belong to one aristocracy or
another, doesn't seem to see anything debas
ing in his position. Everything would be all
right, if he could just get an "in" somewhere.
For one straight A scholar our educational
machine is willing to sacrifice 15 students to an
uncultured and barbaric life of futility and frus
tration. It isn t much wonder that the students
can't see anything inconsistent in the Masque
Ball King and Queen Contest.
When Bob Gros and Ex Committee decided
last year that the Masque Ball King and Queen
Contest would have to go because it was in
consistent with democratic traditions on the
Farm, many were the mutterings and murmur
ings and dire predictions that this would not
be the last of the story.
The dire predictions were right. Springing
full-armed from the head of the Olympian Car
dinals was the raffle plan proposed last week.
Women's Conference, declaring that Stanford
women do not want to be involved in popu
larity contests, batted down the encircling arms
yesterday. The next move is up to Ex Commit
tee.
It is no secret that principal opponent to the
Contest is the Administration, which fears most
of all the harmful publicity which it brings in
the City papers. Stanford gets an unfavorable
balance of trade in the newsprints because it
never has become used to playing cagey ball
on the newspaper man's terms. But that is no
reason why we should leave ourselves wide
open by encouraging trouble-brewing stuff on
the campus.
Just how conscientious the students are about
outside publicity is another matter. Students
are apt to think, as I do, that the unfavorable
publicity is not nearly as unfavorable as our
tetchy big-wigs feel it is.
