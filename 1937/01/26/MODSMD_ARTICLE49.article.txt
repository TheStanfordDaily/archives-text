The Band was late Friday night—too much
bus and bustle trouble.
But Stanford rooters forgot that about half
time, and for once, felt that the band was worthy
of its new uniforms, its free transportation, and
its free game tickets.
It all happened very suddenly. During the
half, with Stanford leading 24-14, the California
band started playing "Come Join the Band" in
a lilting waltz-time rhythm. The arrangement
had been introduced by Jimmy Dorsey Big
Game night when it was more appropriately
played for the triumphant Cal rooters.
But 1" riday night, that tauntingly played song
did something to the boys in the Stanford band.
Leader Russell Fisher swung them into action
with a nearly double-time rendition of the song
in an attempt to drown the Golden blowers.
But the three quarter strain stiii carried on until
the Stanford bass drummer dragged his drum
to the fore and flogged it to lead the blue-faced
horn men on to a moral victory over the larger
and windy Cal band.

For the first time, the band made a successful
attempt to come through; its selections are still
stodgy, its rhythm not too good, and its tone
somewhat brazen, but perhaps a drummer boy
shall lead them.
