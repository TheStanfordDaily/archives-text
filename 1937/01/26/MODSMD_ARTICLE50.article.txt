# Two Bite the Dust
## 
### 
It's been six months now since Eis and Hodge
and I sat along the stone wall, watched the
resort owners clatter along the dusty road, and
talked over our plans for Volume 90 of The
Daily.
That vacation honeymoon was over long be
fore our first edition, and the plans didn't sound
the same when we got them down to sea level,
but the intervening six months has not changed
our summer resolve to sit along our stone walls
together, and to enjoy ourselves as we watched
the campus clatter along its various dusty paths.
It's been fun working together. It's been fun
and it's been work. Eis in his Bull Session has
tilted at the campus opinion columns, Hodge in
his "R. H." edits has tried his hand at divesting
vested interests, but all our interdepartmental
hair-pulling was done on other scalps.
This afternoon one of us wiil be chosen. Next
Monday his name will move up the masthead.
The other one and I will sink back into body
type, the source from which we sprang. Two
more names will move up. The campus will
clatter along its dusty roads, quite unconscious
that the world revolution has taken place.
