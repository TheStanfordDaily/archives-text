THE AKT OF THE DANCE
When scholars exhaust the piddling and the recon
dite as subjects for Master's theses, they may turn to
"The Campus Dance—Whither?"
If they can see beyond the library stacks, they will
conduct a good deal of research at Sequoia Hall, Stan
ford's Agnew.
-"For the Barn Dance there Saturday night topped all
campus hops this year for fun, proving that genius is
the room-mate of insanity.

It was a clinical example of what can be done with
out spending a young fortune, and what can be done
by people who simply want to give a dance.
In bright contrast to Stanford's more typical social
debacles, expensive, formal—luxurious in an infantile
way, full of pathological drunks and pathological tee
totalers—the Barn Dance was inexpensive, spirited and
plain, in its own way, adult.

It was the sort of dance Dr. Wilbur wishes for, that
Dr. Jordan approved, and that the automobile and Re
publican prosperity seemed to have made impossible.
More than just a lot of fun, it proved that kids arc
still kids, and that when we dress up aged 20, we are
as ridiculous as we were dressed in papa's clothes,
aged 8.

For once, the inhibitions built up by inflated pro
priety and inflated bankbooks went to the devil.
The floor was bad, the cider was soft, the cookies
were baker's cookies—and they had nothing to do with
the good time had by all. For once, dietary appurte
nances functioned as dietary appurtenances—not as
narcotics or stimulants.
Instead of paid entertainers, Stanford had its own.
And if there weren't chairs to sit on while watching
them. Barn Dancers sat on the floor. Nor was there
giggling about it. The floor, as always, was the logical
place to sit.

Contrasts are odious, but the Masque Ball and simi
lar examples of premeditated artifice couldn't hold a
candle to that little wage Saturday night. Their very
expensiveness, and the local laziness they typify, mili
tate against their being effective as pure fun.
And, lest we forget, fun is the only justification for
a dance, even at. the sociological sideshow popularly
known as Stanford.
