# OUR HASHER

The lines on the economist's chart are a source of
never ending wonder to me. Sometimes they are un
dulatory and move with a gentle, wave-like motion
slush, slush, slurrup, slurrup).
Other times they are harsh and sharp with jagged
edges. They stab at the heights, and gouge at the syn
clines (hack, hack, rasp, rasp), they scratch on the way
up and they bite on the way down; at night ihey steal
home and beat their wives (boom, boom, crash, crash).
But no matter which way they go, or how they go,
they always end up in the right place. That is the mys
tery about it all.
How do they do it? It's easy.
In a section in Econ 1 the other day, the instructor
was explaining to the class just exactly how the grade
system works out, throwing in a bell curve or two.
The instructor busied himself with his chalk: "Now
supposing the first week he gets 80, the next week 85,
then 75, then two 80's. Ooops! it's getting too high.
Well, let's see. (Here comes the deus ex machina.)
We'll suppose that he's a Zcte, and along in here he
starts slipping and gets a 50."
It's easy. You just have to know how (hack, hack,
oop, oops, rasp, rasp, crash, crash. I'se a muggin. Boom
da-dee-da-dee.)
It seems that there is a Deegee. And she goes with a
D.U. In fact, she has gone with a D.U. for quite a while.
This did not include last Friday night, though, when
she went with a Phi Psi. And the Phi Psi went with her.
(Gone with the wench, as it were). They went to the
basketball game, and on the way home stopped in at
an Oakland hotel for dancing, a cuppa coffee, and a
hot buttered snail (on the 50-cent lunch).
At this very selfsame spot, it seems that the D.U.
clan had gathered to do a little clan-clanning. And
among the D.U.'s there was a D.U., and he was with
another girl.
There is nothing inherently wrong in all this. We
are all young. Life is gay. Let us enjoy ourselves in
our golden youth. She was a D.G.
He was a D.U.
However.
Somebody started playing tricks. Suddenly, the or
chestra leader made queer noises, a spotlight wandered
over to the D.G. and the Phi Psi. The queer noises
rapidly became coherent. The D.U. looked up aghast
to hear that the engagement of the D.G. and the Phi Psi
was being announced. People rushed up to congratu
late the pair, Tho D.U. rushed up to congratulate the
|i.iir (hack, back, oop, oops, rasp, rasp, crash, crash).

The lines on the economist's chart are a source of
never ending wonder to me. Sometimes they are un
dulatory and move with a gentle, wave-like motion
slush, slush, slurrup, slurrup).
Other times they are harsh and sharp with jagged
edges. They stab at the heights, and gouge at the syn
clines (hack, hack, rasp, rasp), they scratch on the way
up and they bite on the way down; at night ihey steal
home and beat their wives (boom, boom, crash, crash).
But no matter which way they go, or how they go,
they always end up in the right place. That is the mys
tery about it all.
How do they do it? It's easy.
In a section in Econ 1 the other day, the instructor
was explaining to the class just exactly how the grade
system works out, throwing in a bell curve or two.
The instructor busied himself with his chalk: "Now
supposing the first week he gets 80, the next week 85,
then 75, then two 80's. Ooops! it's getting too high.
Well, let's see. (Here comes the deus ex machina.)
We'll suppose that he's a Zcte, and along in here he
starts slipping and gets a 50."
It's easy. You just have to know how (hack, hack,
oop, oops, rasp, rasp, crash, crash. I'se a muggin. Boom
da-dee-da-dee.)
It seems that there is a Deegee. And she goes with a
D.U. In fact, she has gone with a D.U. for quite a while.
This did not include last Friday night, though, when
she went with a Phi Psi. And the Phi Psi went with her.
(Gone with the wench, as it were). They went to the
basketball game, and on the way home stopped in at
an Oakland hotel for dancing, a cuppa coffee, and a
hot buttered snail (on the 50-cent lunch).
At this very selfsame spot, it seems that the D.U.
clan had gathered to do a little clan-clanning. And
among the D.U.'s there was a D.U., and he was with
another girl.
There is nothing inherently wrong in all this. We
are all young. Life is gay. Let us enjoy ourselves in
our golden youth. She was a D.G.
He was a D.U.
However.
Somebody started playing tricks. Suddenly, the or
chestra leader made queer noises, a spotlight wandered
over to the D.G. and the Phi Psi. The queer noises
rapidly became coherent. The D.U. looked up aghast
to hear that the engagement of the D.G. and the Phi Psi
was being announced. People rushed up to congratu
late the pair, Tho D.U. rushed up to congratulate the
|i.iir (hack, back, oop, oops, rasp, rasp, crash, crash).
