# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
To correct and clarify the discus
sion relative to the graduate dormi
tory situation, herewith are the facts
to date:
1. On behalf of Branner and Toyon
Hall residents, I circulated a petition
to the Comptroller's Office requesting
an investigation of the possibilities of
the erection of a new men's dormi
tory for graduate students, presum
ably divided into wings for each
graduate school. This new unit
would be erected behind Branner,
and the idle Branner Dining Hall
would be reopened for the graduate
dormitory men and also for Toyon
and Branner men who are not mem
bers of eating clubs.
2. Such a unit would cost approx
imately $400,000, which is termed
prohibitive by the comptroller's of
fice. The University interest rati?
alone would exceed the gross reve
nue of rentals in the hall. On the
other hand, Lagunita was erected
from the tuition collected from the
enlarged women's student body. At
the present time the only hope for a
new men's dormitory is an outright
gift from the "friends of the Univer
sity."
3. An alternative plan being inves
tigated would remodel and modern
ize Sequoia for graduate students to
the amount of some $50,000. Sequoia
Eating Club would become the din
ing hall for the grads. Present Se
quoia residents would take over the
fight and possibly half of the fourth
floor of Encina. Should this over
crowd Encina any quarter, senior
students expecting to go on to gradu
ate school would be transferred to
Sequoia. Branner Dining Hall would
be opened for the ex-Sequoians and
non-club men from Branner and
Toyon.
4. In the event Sequoia would op
erate to capacity under the proposed
plan, hall men would be given pref
erence over row men; otherwise,
fraternity men would be extended
the right to live with fellow graduate
students.
5. Due consideration must be given
to the objections raised to the lack of
single rooms in Sequoia. While noth
ing definite has been proposed, this
would probably be adjusted in the
remodeling of Sequoia.
Very truly yours,
Art Allen
