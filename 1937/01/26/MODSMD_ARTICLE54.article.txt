# YOU DEVIL

The Editor, Sir:
As a super-super connoisseur of
amorous epistles may I extend my
congratulations to the editor for the
stand he has taken in this extremely
important, world-shaking matter of
"passion." Those mash notes sound
as if they came from some dames that
are tired of kindergarten Romeos and
are out after bigger and better
morons. Only one of them stoops to
swearing and the other stoops to—
what does she stoop to? What tripe!
I didn't know that people still wrote

that sort of thing. And I didn't know
that there were still some idiots that
thought it was hot stuff. But then, we
were not asked to comment on the
mental ages of the writers. Just
which one is the most "passionate."
Jeez!
Number two undoubtedly takes the
cake. I thought No. 1 had it in the
bag until I got to where No. 2 called
her love a "terrible person." That
sunk me. That, sir, is true love. That
is the acme of passion. Can't you
just see with what feeling this female
Romeo bared her very soul in those
few words? I'm telling you, No. 2 is
a dilly. Simply a dilly.
Of course, No. 1 had a few things
in her favor. I like that little ab
sence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder
touch. And the way she said she
didn't dare read her little note over.
I don't blame her. If I had done
something as bad as that, I couldn't
even look the words in the face.
Do you realize, Mr. Editor, you
terrible, terrible person, that I
dreamed last night that I got a great
big, wonderful long let— no. That's
not right. I dreamed that 1 came to
the library to study education, not
to write to you. I'm out of ink any
way, so here goes nothing.
Much love,
Don Adams
P.S.: Don't forget to write to me,
you little devil.
