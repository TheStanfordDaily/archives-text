# FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD

The Editor, Sir:
As usual, the Honorable Mr. Pren
dergast is barking up the wrong tree.
Like most newspaper men, he has
either read his misinformation in a
Hearst paper or has jumped at some
apparently obvious conclusion. I re
fer to his article on the San Francisco
police force. It so happens that the
fellow that was felled by the police
man's blow was an obnoxious drunk
ard. Knowing him, I do not doubt
but that he had tangled with the po
lice before. (Incidentally, he was
syphilitic.)
There is but one thing to do. Either
take all the "instrumente de guerra"
from the police force, which would
amount to the same thing as giving
G-men water pistols for their work,
or better still, have the skulls of each
victim-to-be-X-raycd before they
are clubbed. If I was a writer I
would sarcastically ask why newspa
per writers can find out what they
spou! off about before they spout.
Long live the police.
Far from a Policeman
