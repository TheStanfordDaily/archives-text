SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY:
THIRD WEEK
Alexander Tansman was the guest
artist with the San Francisco Sym
phony this week, like George Gersh
win, another young pianist-composer
working in the present with modern
musical materials.
Unlike Gershwin, though, Tans
man is a Pole, and a European. He
is less concerned with American
jazz, more influenced by Chopin and
the folk songs of his own land. The
"Concertino for Piano and Orches
tra" was perhaps the most mechan
istic, unemotional of the two compo
sitions. The intricate piano cadenza
of the first movement, the slower in
volved Intermezzo Chopiano, and the
final rondo made a whole that was
firmly neo-classic in spirit. Like
Gershwin, Tansman conducted his
second work, the "Aria and Alia
Pollaca," the latter a swift thing that
sent the composer whirling through
the pages of his score.
Personally, I was a little unmoved
with Tansman's music. Modern in
its complicated rhythms, its contra
puntal intricacies, it seems a little
cold and meaningless. Which, I sup
pose, inspires the question — should
music convey an emotional effect?
Concluding number was Ravel's
brilliantly orchestrated "The Waltz."
I am looking forward to Richard
Strauss' "Death and Transfigura
tion" which the Mr. Monteux and
the symphony will perform this
week-end.
