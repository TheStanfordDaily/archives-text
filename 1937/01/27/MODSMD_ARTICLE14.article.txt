# Solid, Varied Fare Offered by Symphony
## Beethoven's Composition Is Concert Highlight 
### HELEN WARSON 
Pierre Monteux and the San Fran
cisco symphony orchestra presented
a program last night of Wagner,
Beethoven, Tschaikowsky, Debussy,
and Chabrier, varied but solid fare,
unlikely to provoke the ire of anti
moderns. The most outstanding per
haps was the Beethoven symphony
number 5 in C minor.
One of the great composer's great
est works (the greatest says Hector
Berlioz), last night's presentation
was a more satisfying one than that
of the opening concert when Mr.
Monteux directed it in San Francisco.
A splendid "fortissimo" was reached
in the first movement, the furious
"allegro con Brio."
The more sober, tender mood of the
second was established by the quiet
interplay of the strings. The brasses
on the whole behaved better, and a
splendid climax was reached in the
finale, triumphal after the sinister,
brooding of the "scherzo."
All the more after his Stanford
concert can we congratulate Mr.
Monteux for his giving San Francisco
a splendid symphony orchestra.
Three of the selections on last night's
programme, however, had already
been played this season in San
Francisco. A less familiar pro
gramme would have been desired.
