Stanford women don't want to wait
10 or 15 years to he "big shots" in
the business world. Neither do they
want to be among the 5 per cent of
"just" stenographers who are college
graduates . . . and remain stenos.
In the informal discussion which
followed a talk at Lagunita by MLss
Bertha Dale, personnel director of
the P G. & E. in San Francisco, .she
sot clown the following rules for
those who hope to be "career
women" in the next few years.

Stenographic training is almost a
necessity It serves us a wedge into
;t great many positions where there
are few vacancies, and is a line way

! to acquire experience.
Attitude and appearance are very
important when applications and
promotions are being considered . . .
and, said Miss Dale, "Bosses notice
things like red finger-nail polish and
clock watching, whether they seem
; to or not."
Personality and education are two
I other items on which personnel
managers check carefully. If a girl
has poise and the ability to get along
with people she is an asset to any
corporation.
Should l.ist Activities
"Most girls are very careless about
filling out application blanks," said
Miss Dale. "They forget that their
. college activities may have a real

! bearing on their business life."
Pull is not as necessary as many
j people believe, because once you get
! into a corporation it is what you do,
I not what you are, that puts you
ahead.
In the beginning wages should
take a secondary place, and oppor
\ tunity for advancement first. From
I $75 to $100 a month is considered a
good beginning wage, and (though
some Stanford co-eds doubt it) a girl
can live very nicely on $80.
Dean Yost said that she thought
business experience should be a part
of every girl's education. "It makes
her a more understanding wife, and
j helps her if she ever has to make
her own way."
