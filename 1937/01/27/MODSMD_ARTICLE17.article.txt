# Armies Plan Defense For 'Super Flood'
## Medicine, Water Needed For 750,000 Refugees; Martial Law Declared 
### UNITED PRESS 
A peace-time army was tonight
fighting illness, terror and death
among 750,000 refugees in 11 flood- 1
swept states, as the death list j
mounted to 101 for the whole area. ;
Workers weie informed that the rag- i
ing Ohio River was generating a
"super flood" in the already stricken I
Mississippi Valley.
President Roosevelt was prepared
to allot the entire emergency relief |
appropriation of $790,000,000 for i
flood relief. In addition, the Red
Cross started street corner collec- j
tions for the $4,000,000 ijeeded im- j
mediately.
Medicine, Water Needed
There was an urgent need of !
medicine, food, clothing, and boats in I
the fight against epidemics of pneu- |
monia, influenza, chicken pox, j
mumps, measles, scarlet fever 'and j
typhoid which have broken out in I
many of the flooded areas.
The fall of rain has lessened but ,
has had as yet no effect on the river i
waters, which continue to rise rap- !
idly, isolating many new towns and ]
surging higher in already flooded i
districts. Cairo, Illinois, was being
rapidly evacuated as the waters j
lapped six inches from the top of the j
sea wall.
Cities in Danger
Great danger existed in several'
cities tonight as water covered with I
oil and gasoline from broken tanks !
created a fire hazard. Fear of a j
repetition of the Cincinnati disaster j
caused firemen to watch such dis- j
tricts carefully.
The supply of drinking water in I
Portsmouth, Ohio, was sufficient fin
only three more days, according to
authorities. Other cities also suffered
shortages of water, as well as of
electricity and food.
The six flooded counties of Ar- I
kansas were under martial law as ]
well as cities in Indiana, Kentucky, |
Ohio, and Illinois. Red Cross and
U.S. Army engineers divided the
work of saving the lives of at least
200,000 people in Missouri, Tennes
see, Arkansas, and Mississippi.
