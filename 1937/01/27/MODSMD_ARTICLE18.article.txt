# Row Proposes Flood Aid Fund
## Houses to Solicit Funds Today; $48 Collected 
### 
Disaster reigns in Midwest flooded
regionsâ€”Stanford should help.
It was with that belief that a
movement for a Stanford Flood Re
lief Fund suddenly sprang forth in
Interfraternity Council meeting last
night.
In suggesting the drive, one house
announced that its members had
pledged 48 dollars at dinner last
night, that a letter had been written
to the Daily's Campus Opinion ad
vocating the drive.
Though the Council saw no need
to lake official action, President Bob
Hoover requested that house presi
dents sound out fraternity opinion,
and solicit funds if attitude is found
to be generally favorable.
If the movement gains headway
today, and meets with Hall approval,
a Fund treasurer will probably be
chosen, who will, in turn, transfer
collections to the Red Cross.
