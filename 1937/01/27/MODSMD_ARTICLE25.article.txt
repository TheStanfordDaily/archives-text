# King Queen Vote Up to Conference, Say Executives
## Ex Committee Postpones Special Election; New Office Tenures Sought 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Possibilities that a King-Queen
contest, to be decided by chance, will
be revived this year increased as Ex
Committee last night requested
Women's Conference to reconsider
their unfavorable decision with "ad
equate representation on both sides."
With President Reynolds snapping
business through in anticipation of a
concert series date, only lag of the
meeting occurred when members
gagged over the suggestion that they
were bound by committee recom
mendation that the last spring an
nual publicity stunt for convalescent
home drive benefit be abolished.
Favor Tradition
Although the Committee decided
to await Women's Conference recon
sideration and so took no vote, a
majority of the members argued in
favor of continuing the "old tradi
tion." Roy Anderson and Bob Mal
lett led those in favor with Esther
Pelton and Barbara Kimball saying,
"No," at suitable intervals.
Anderson: "With the money angle
taken out, will Women's Conference
okeh it?"
Kimball: "No. You still have a
King-Queen contest and that is what
was objectionable."
Mallett: "But the chance element is
injected. You can't buy the office."
Pelton: "No."
Franieh: "Well, everything in life
is a popularity contest."
"We could put it on the ballot for
the student body to decide," summed
up Jim Reynolds.
Special election scheduled for this
Thursday was cancelled. Because
notices for the election had not been
up a week ahead, the voting would
be unconstitutional.
To remedy a long standing diffi
culty, it was proposed to elect three
members each to Men's and Women's
conference in February. Under the
former set-up only two were elected
in spring, three in fall. Frequent re
sult was seniors running in the
spring and not coming back in the
fall to round out their terms. No
action taken.
May Have Precincts
Mallett and Anderson proposed
setting up of three precincts for stu
dent elections. Under their plan, La
gunita, Roble, and Sequoia would
vote at Geology corner; the Row and
southern women's living groups at
Engineering Corner; and men's living
groups at Law Steps.
Alternative proposal of Bill Ward
calling for separate polls at each liv
ing group was objected to bccause of
"dirty politics" that might follow.
Phi Larch: President Reynolds an
nounced the receipt of a letter ask
ing him as a campus leader to pro
mote the formation of the "Phi
Larch" society for campus activity
bigwigs. "Thanks," said Reynolds.

vote at Geology corner; the Row and
southern women's living groups at
Engineering Corner; and men's living
groups at Law Steps.
Alternative proposal of Bill Ward
calling for separate polls at each liv
ing group was objected to bccause of
"dirty politics" that might follow.
Phi Larch: President Reynolds an
nounced the receipt of a letter ask
ing him as a campus leader to pro
mote the formation of the "Phi
Larch" society for campus activity
bigwigs. "Thanks," said Reynolds.
Stanford Flying Club constitution
as revised was accepted.
Dates granted were graduate wom
en's club, informal, Feb. 26; Alpha

Possibilities that a King-Queen
contest, to be decided by chance, will
be revived this year increased as Ex
Committee last night requested
Women's Conference to reconsider
their unfavorable decision with "ad
equate representation on both sides."
With President Reynolds snapping
business through in anticipation of a
concert series date, only lag of the
meeting occurred when members
gagged over the suggestion that they
were bound by committee recom
mendation that the last spring an
nual publicity stunt for convalescent
home drive benefit be abolished.
Favor Tradition
Although the Committee decided
to await Women's Conference recon
sideration and so took no vote, a
majority of the members argued in
favor of continuing the "old tradi
tion." Roy Anderson and Bob Mal
lett led those in favor with Esther
Pelton and Barbara Kimball saying,
"No," at suitable intervals.
Anderson: "With the money angle
taken out, will Women's Conference
okeh it?"
Kimball: "No. You still have a
King-Queen contest and that is what
was objectionable."
Mallett: "But the chance element is
injected. You can't buy the office."
Pelton: "No."
Franieh: "Well, everything in life
is a popularity contest."
"We could put it on the ballot for
the student body to decide," summed
up Jim Reynolds.
Special election scheduled for this
Thursday was cancelled. Because
notices for the election had not been
up a week ahead, the voting would
be unconstitutional.
To remedy a long standing diffi
culty, it was proposed to elect three
members each to Men's and Women's
conference in February. Under the
former set-up only two were elected
in spring, three in fall. Frequent re
sult was seniors running in the
spring and not coming back in the
fall to round out their terms. No
action taken.
May Have Precincts
Mallett and Anderson proposed
setting up of three precincts for stu
dent elections. Under their plan, La
gunita, Roble, and Sequoia would
vote at Geology corner; the Row and
southern women's living groups at
Engineering Corner; and men's living
groups at Law Steps.
