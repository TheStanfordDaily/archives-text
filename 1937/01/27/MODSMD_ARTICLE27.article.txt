ON MISSING THE BOAT
There was a fine shuffling of the
cards around the Daily shack last
night and a nice friendly spirit that
does not usually appear in a table
stakes poker same, but poker games
are poker games and elections are
elections and appointments are ap
pointments, and in all of them the old
adage that there is plenty of room at
the top does not necessarily hold
true.
For a lot of people peeked at their
pasties and found something like a
six, a seven, a king, and a pair of
treys when it took jacks or better to
open. To them somebody should ad
dress the usual standard consolation
talk. Somebody should point out that
campus activities are not the most se
rious thing in the world, that under
graduate opinion does not always get
around to appraising values correct
ly, that the Daily will somehow be
published as usual for some time to
come.

The only thing is, I haven't got
quite the heart to foist upon a lot of
people who have been crying in their
beers over What is to them a serious
matter some flabby proverbs about
what a futile thing remorse is so why
worry. To point out that Daily elec
tions have never degenerated into
the dirty rotten brawls that mark
each Chaparral election does not of
fer much consolation, for it is the de
feat itself that rankles >vith the can
didate left out in the cold and not the
way in which he got beat. Nor does
it help to remark stoically that the
Daily, like the show, must go on and
will go on, for better or for worse.
The defeated candidate is bound to
foel that the Daily is going on for
worse for sure.
All I can do without being a Polly
anna is to reminisce that when I lost
a Chaparral election the bottom fell
out of things pretty heavily but after
a while I got the sweetest feeling of
relief to think that somebody else
was killing himself to put out Chap
arral's 32 pages of advertisements
held together every month by a
varying amount of generally unap
preciated humor.

I envy the person who does not
feed his delusions of grandeur on a
college activity but rather sits around
and considers the main problem in
hand,* which is how to crack a per
verse and out-of-joint world outside
the gates that is just waiting to shear
us poor lambs.
