# Editor Outlines Policies of New Daily Regime
## 
### 
The Daily, Volume 91, will attempt
to regard itself as a newspaper, Stan
ford as a part of the world, not all of
it. The Daily's job will be to x-eport
what goes on in that world from the
viewpoint of the intelligent observer,
not from the viewpoint of that har
ried stereotypeâ€”the Stanfordite.
Editorially, the Daily will attempt
to be liberal in so far as liberalism
is synonymous with intelligence, not
so far as liberalism is indicative of a
self-conscious hatred of conserva
tism.
Our coverage of the campus will be
stressed. The United Press can be
relied upon to cover the world south
of Junction Inn and north of Bel
tramo's.
We will gather the microcosms as
we winnow the macrocosms.
