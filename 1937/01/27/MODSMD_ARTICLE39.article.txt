# Indian Quintet Faces Six- Year Hoop Record Of Ace U.S.C. Team
## Pan â€“ Pacific Auditorium To Be Scene of Games Friday and Saturday 
### 
Justin M. "Sam" Barry, Southern
California basketball coach, has been
turning out for six years what have
consistently been the toughest con
tenders in Pacific Coast collegiate
hoop wars.
With his first team at Troy in 1930
he swept to the conference cham
pionship after walking off with the
southern division title. The next two
years were as lean as any he has ever
felt on this side of the Rockies, when
he found himself unable to do better
than second place in the southern di
vision. At that, in the second game
the Trojans lost the play-off for the
title against California after Stan
lord had beaten them to throw the
race into a tie.
Wins in '154 and '35
In 1933 and 1934 things were dif
ferent, for the Moanin* Master
turned out a pair of first-place win
ners. Featured on those teams were
several of the finest dive artists that
ever played basketball, Barry having
coached his outfits to the point where
it was funny if he didn't win games
on foul throws.
Things were even rosier in 1935,
when Elevator Sam and the Big
Wooden Horse scrambled their way
to the championship of the coast as
they trampled Oregon State in the
interdivisional playoff. That was the
year that Guttero and Hupp got to
gether to butcher practically every
team they met. Barking Joe Kelly
was around then, too.
Last year Stanford was invincible,
but it was Troy that pushed the In
dians all the way, forcing an ultimate
play-off for the southern division
flag.
S.C. Tough Contender
Again this year Southern Cal
looms as the toughest contender the
logically favorite Cards have to face.
The Trojans have won all four of
their conference starts this season,
two over U.C.L A. and two over the
Bears. Not only that, Barry's boys
have lost but one game all season,
that to Ohio State in an overtime
game at Los Angeles. A tour of the
southern states as far over, as Texas
netted them eight wins.
During the Barry regime Stanford
has won eight games from U.S.C.,
while losing 19. The same is true of
California, which pair of facts testify
to the constant power of the Trojans
since the South Dakotan came to the
Coast.
It has been these two games, Fri
da yand Saturday nights at the Pan-
Pacific auditorium in Los Angeles
against U.S.C., that Coach John Bunn
has been fearing more than any other
games his team will play in the con
ference round-robin.
And what better reasons can he
have to fear them, than the fact that
Troy has lost only one game this year
in 14 and that Barry has been so
good for so long?
