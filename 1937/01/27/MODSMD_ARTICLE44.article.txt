# Students Plan All-University Swim Meet
## Interclass Title at Stake As Mermen Prepare In Cold Winter Rains 
### 
There's great rivalry in the en
closure of Eneina Pools these days
as the varsity mermen splash about,
heedless of the bitter cold and rain.
This sudden civil strife in the
aquatic uanks can be attributed to
the approaching all - University
Swimming Championships to be held
February 6.
Needliam Leads
The sophs proudly display Win
field Needham, ace distance man;
Hal Weatherbe, top notch back
stroker; Roy Winkelman, unrivaled
in diving; Don Towne, number one
man in the breaststroke; Dick
Clarke, sprinter; and Bill Hatch,
! breaststroker.
The juniors only have two out-
I standing men: Dave Rider, sensa
i tional distance star, and Jack Vibert,
I speedy sprinter. The Class of '38
! also cxpects points from Mason Let
j teau, veteran backstroker.
Seniors Score
The seniors have Don Peterson, the
i fighting fool who is coming into his
! own in the 220 this season; Alec
j MacKenzie, star sprinter; Captain
i Martin Scatena, sprinter; and Dave
j Duncan in the backstroke.
The frosh, having one of the weak
i est teams in recent years, have little
; to offer in the way of point-getting
i possibilities. The Class of '40 has two
| men capable of taking points: Jack
j Read, sensational backstroker from
Lowell Hi, and Lloyd Wilson, expert
! breaststroker from Paly Hi.
