WELL. DOC.
TAKE IT OVER
You're in; they've made you Sport i
Editor of this rag. You're probably (
pretty proud and happy about it as :
you should be, but let me tell you a '
few things about the job to save you |
the time of learning them later.
It's a task, and a real one; the
more conscience j'ou have about your
work the worse it gets — the more
things appear that should be correct
ed, and the more things you'll have
to do yourself or worry about getting
done.
But it's a good job, and you'll get
as much kick out of it as any similar
position in the country. You can look
at the exchanges of other college
newspapers ;tnd laugh, laugh when
you think of the pitifully suppressed
existence they ifiust lead when large
wealthy institutions put out some of
the six column throwaways that ar
rive around here.
YOU'LL MAKE
(JOOD CONTACTS
It'll be an invaluable experience,
one you'll never forget, meeting the
sports authorities at Stanford. The
directors, every last one of them, are
not only the equals of anyone in
the country in knowledge of their
professions, but are as fine and high
a type of gentleman as you'll ever
want to meet.
Tiny Thornhill, John Bunn. Dink
Templeton, Harry Wolter, and Harry
Maloney. Remember those names
and cultivate their acquaintance.
There isn't one among them that
won't talk an arm off you the min
ute he learns who you are, trying to
teach you the inside on his sport so
that you can better understand his
competitive methods, and because he
knows that you're representing the
only newspaper that's behind him all
the way and can be biased in help
ing him to improve.
A1 Masters is another one; I've
never known him yet to lose patience
with The Daily, and Lord knows he's
had plenty of opportunity. Don Lieb
endorfer is a great guy—always glad

to see you and ready to spend all j
afternoon for you looking up the
college records of Chris Freeman \
and Tiny Sellman. if you want it.
Eisenbach, the new editor, has and i
will have a kindly eye on your work, j
He knows the important position that i
athletics occupy in the Stanford
structure, and he has confidence in
your ability to get the proper cover
age. He'll give you a free hand. Jorgi
is as patient a man to work for as
ever you'll find, but Eis isn't far
behind.
You've got a good bunch of stooges
working for you, and in a few weeks
you'll have some more. They're
faithful as lambs—if you tell 'em to
get a yarn they'll worry themselves
sick till they get it.
HI T DON'T THINK
IT'S ALL SOFT SILK
On the other hand, Doc, wake up
in the morning some time to find
they've left a baseball story out of
the paper just after the players have
been threatening you for a week be
cause of insufficient coverage. Look
and find your Sideline Slants cut and
garbled so that it looks like a Lino
type ad. Keep the spring sport
schedules in your desk for two weeks
waiting for Liebendorfer to let you
release it, and then read it in the
morning Chronicle some day.
You'll find Phi Delta Phi called
"Phi Delts" in the intramural head,
and a track meet will run in the
Daily a week before it's to come off.
Every morning in your 8 o'clock, if
you're so unfortunate as to have one,
people will moan about something
that was wrong or missing in the
sport page, and probably will advise
'"Why doesn't that Daily fold up?
It's getting worse and worse."
The crowning picnic, however, is
to come over in the afternoon to find
the page all dummied full of Chester
field and filler ads, so full that you
know you're beaten before you start
on getting those various stories in.
"Printing costs, printing costs!"
yells the business staff. "We're los
ing money hand over fist! We gotta

run a lotta ads because its a cheaper
way to fill space! Six pages? Noooo
. . . can't afford it!"
All 1 know, Doc, is what I read in
the profit and loss sheet for last fall,
and that prices and human nature
haven't changed an awful lot since a
few r years ago, when they pat out a
space you could work with.
You see, Doc, you have your wor
ries. You'll holler and shout yourself
hoarse and bleary-eyed trying to
correct them.
But you'll love it just the same.
WELL. DOC.

garbled so that it looks like a Lino
type ad. Keep the spring sport
schedules in your desk for two weeks
waiting for Liebendorfer to let you
release it, and then read it in the
morning Chronicle some day.
You'll find Phi Delta Phi called
"Phi Delts" in the intramural head,
and a track meet will run in the
Daily a week before it's to come off.
Every morning in your 8 o'clock, if
you're so unfortunate as to have one,
people will moan about something
that was wrong or missing in the
sport page, and probably will advise
'"Why doesn't that Daily fold up?
It's getting worse and worse."
The crowning picnic, however, is
to come over in the afternoon to find
the page all dummied full of Chester
field and filler ads, so full that you
know you're beaten before you start
on getting those various stories in.
"Printing costs, printing costs!"
yells the business staff. "We're los
ing money hand over fist! We gotta

run a lotta ads because its a cheaper
way to fill space! Six pages? Noooo
. . . can't afford it!"
All 1 know, Doc, is what I read in
the profit and loss sheet for last fall,
and that prices and human nature
haven't changed an awful lot since a
few r years ago, when they pat out a
space you could work with.
You see, Doc, you have your wor
ries. You'll holler and shout yourself
hoarse and bleary-eyed trying to
correct them.
But you'll love it just the same.
WELL. DOC.
TAKE IT OVER
You're in; they've made you Sport i
Editor of this rag. You're probably (
pretty proud and happy about it as :
you should be, but let me tell you a '
few things about the job to save you |
the time of learning them later.
It's a task, and a real one; the
more conscience j'ou have about your
work the worse it gets — the more
things appear that should be correct
ed, and the more things you'll have
to do yourself or worry about getting
done.
But it's a good job, and you'll get
as much kick out of it as any similar
position in the country. You can look
at the exchanges of other college
newspapers ;tnd laugh, laugh when
you think of the pitifully suppressed
existence they ifiust lead when large
wealthy institutions put out some of
the six column throwaways that ar
rive around here.
YOU'LL MAKE
(JOOD CONTACTS
It'll be an invaluable experience,
one you'll never forget, meeting the
sports authorities at Stanford. The
directors, every last one of them, are
not only the equals of anyone in
the country in knowledge of their
professions, but are as fine and high
a type of gentleman as you'll ever
want to meet.
Tiny Thornhill, John Bunn. Dink
Templeton, Harry Wolter, and Harry
Maloney. Remember those names
and cultivate their acquaintance.
There isn't one among them that
won't talk an arm off you the min
ute he learns who you are, trying to
teach you the inside on his sport so
that you can better understand his
competitive methods, and because he
knows that you're representing the
only newspaper that's behind him all
the way and can be biased in help
ing him to improve.
A1 Masters is another one; I've
never known him yet to lose patience
with The Daily, and Lord knows he's
had plenty of opportunity. Don Lieb
endorfer is a great guy—always glad

to see you and ready to spend all j
afternoon for you looking up the
college records of Chris Freeman \
and Tiny Sellman. if you want it.
Eisenbach, the new editor, has and i
will have a kindly eye on your work, j
He knows the important position that i
athletics occupy in the Stanford
structure, and he has confidence in
your ability to get the proper cover
age. He'll give you a free hand. Jorgi
is as patient a man to work for as
ever you'll find, but Eis isn't far
behind.
You've got a good bunch of stooges
working for you, and in a few weeks
you'll have some more. They're
faithful as lambs—if you tell 'em to
get a yarn they'll worry themselves
sick till they get it.

HI T DON'T THINK
IT'S ALL SOFT SILK
On the other hand, Doc, wake up
in the morning some time to find
they've left a baseball story out of
the paper just after the players have
been threatening you for a week be
cause of insufficient coverage. Look
and find your Sideline Slants cut and
garbled so that it looks like a Lino
type ad. Keep the spring sport
schedules in your desk for two weeks
waiting for Liebendorfer to let you
release it, and then read it in the
morning Chronicle some day.
You'll find Phi Delta Phi called
"Phi Delts" in the intramural head,
and a track meet will run in the
Daily a week before it's to come off.
Every morning in your 8 o'clock, if
you're so unfortunate as to have one,
people will moan about something
that was wrong or missing in the
sport page, and probably will advise
'"Why doesn't that Daily fold up?
It's getting worse and worse."
The crowning picnic, however, is
to come over in the afternoon to find
the page all dummied full of Chester
field and filler ads, so full that you
know you're beaten before you start
on getting those various stories in.
"Printing costs, printing costs!"
yells the business staff. "We're los
ing money hand over fist! We gotta

run a lotta ads because its a cheaper
way to fill space! Six pages? Noooo
. . . can't afford it!"
All 1 know, Doc, is what I read in
the profit and loss sheet for last fall,
and that prices and human nature
haven't changed an awful lot since a
few r years ago, when they pat out a
space you could work with.
You see, Doc, you have your wor
ries. You'll holler and shout yourself
hoarse and bleary-eyed trying to
correct them.
But you'll love it just the same.
WELL. DOC.
TAKE IT OVER
You're in; they've made you Sport i
Editor of this rag. You're probably (
pretty proud and happy about it as :
you should be, but let me tell you a '
few things about the job to save you |
the time of learning them later.
It's a task, and a real one; the
more conscience j'ou have about your
work the worse it gets — the more
things appear that should be correct
ed, and the more things you'll have
to do yourself or worry about getting
done.
But it's a good job, and you'll get
as much kick out of it as any similar
position in the country. You can look
at the exchanges of other college
newspapers ;tnd laugh, laugh when
you think of the pitifully suppressed
existence they ifiust lead when large
wealthy institutions put out some of
the six column throwaways that ar
rive around here.
YOU'LL MAKE
(JOOD CONTACTS
It'll be an invaluable experience,
one you'll never forget, meeting the
sports authorities at Stanford. The
directors, every last one of them, are
not only the equals of anyone in
the country in knowledge of their
professions, but are as fine and high
a type of gentleman as you'll ever
want to meet.
Tiny Thornhill, John Bunn. Dink
Templeton, Harry Wolter, and Harry
Maloney. Remember those names
and cultivate their acquaintance.
