# Daily Elections
## 
### 
Dear R. H.:
After I wind up with my "Dear Eis" edit Fri
day morning, I'll curl myself up and join you
in retirement. However, before that happens, a
word in appreciation for the services of those
initials to this volume.
The cool, definitive mind that searched out
facts, showed through the rich coating of humor
that sparkled in the R. H. edits. It was good stuff
from a good man. The tail-end stuff I didn't
want to cover, I pawned off on you, yet you
brought it back and gave it that R. H. twist that
made it worth something.
Daily elections are Daily elections, and twice
a year one of the two best men on the staff has
to consider tossed away 3 years' labor in climb
ing for the top. Every time, the waste in man
power and ability seems to attach to itself a
new significance. Yet v/e don't do anything
about it. Maybe we can't.
