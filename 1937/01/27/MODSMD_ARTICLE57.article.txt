He couldn't ever be the man on horseback.
He'd tire out the horse. But he's got a strong
staff, and will he groom it.
He's got Botsford and Frost to carry on the
foreign relations with the Ad Building and the
B.A.C. Then there's Blaikie and Lapham to
handle domestic affairs.
The Sweet dynasty inherits the women's
editor job to guard against the internecine wars,
v/hile down on desk Carmean, Diamond, Hurst,
Klauber, Loud, and Rice will hold their own
little wars once per week, aided and abetted by
the copy editors led by Hammond and Rosie.
That loguacious Swede Peterson will fight
with the business department over the tight ad
dummies on the sports page, while Corena
Crase will lead the battle against the dummies
on the U.P. desk. The Leftist movement will
take the feature department, while the right
wing of the English Club becomes the Drury
reviewing staff. Tro Harper won't have any
Monday Tabby to plan pictures for, but with the
man on horseback without a horse as editor,
he'll be worried enough about pictures all
right.
I won't go on, don't worry. But I won't need
to, the sample is enough.
Down through the whole organization will be
felt the grip of the man of destiny. The campus
knows him only as the one who admires the
President's diction, sguabbles with females
known as Susan, and worships at the feet of
Mr. Gershwin, but the staff knows him as the
steamroller with the artistic touch.
