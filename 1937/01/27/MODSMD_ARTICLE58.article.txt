I was under the impression that the army
engineers had it all figured out how they were
going to stop floods by building dams. The soil
conservation advocates were guite sure the way
to do it was by restoring the natural cover for
the ground, reforestation, and the prevention of
erosion.
Though appropriations were made here and
there, no concerted, constructive action has
been taken. After relief expenditures are
shoved through Congress, maybe enough peo
ple will be aroused at the destruction and loss
of life occasioned by the Louisville floods to
apply some preventative measures this time.
As long as economic necessity reguires cities
to be built up along river banks, political power
should follow along to make the positions ten
able. Our slow-moving, check-balanced, and
decentralized political power has not kept pace,
as evidenced in this flood. When flood control
comes, it should come under such a form of
regional planning as the TVA.
Meanwhile, this is small comfort to the fami
lies of over 125 dead, the 550,000 homeless. The
Red Cross has appealed for 510,000,000 in order
to care for the immediate suffering. Spontane
ously, on the campus last night, one fraternity
moved forward with the idea that Stanford par
ticipate in the nation-wide fund-raising cam
paign, and immediately pledged S4B. The rest
of the campus probably will and certainly
should join in enthusiastically.
