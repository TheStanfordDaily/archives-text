# Social Incompetence
## 
### 
While commenting upon the passing of the
"coonskin collegian"—who now survives only
in moving pictures—Dean Christian Gauss of
Princeton takes time out from his exultation to
lament—that education still fails to give an ade
quate tiaining "in social competence."
That the college boy of today is more serious
and more intelligent than his predecessor of
fhe jazz age, there can be no doubt. But Dean
Gauss asserts that universities are, nevertheless,
turning out "too many social incompetents . .
too many men and women who are not really
enviable human risks. They will never be
happy because they have not learned how to
live in groups."

The Princeton dean goes on to say—all with
unquestionable truth—that one reason for this
condition is that colleges leave the problem of
social education to the students themselves.
We agree with Dean Gauss in that a student
who, because of his social backwardness, is not
asked to join a fraternity, may become keenly
aware of an "inferiority."
If dwelling together in one house as a small
community does not train a group of boys in
social competence, we cannot imagine any kind
of training that would do the trick.—(From the
Daily Piincetonian)
