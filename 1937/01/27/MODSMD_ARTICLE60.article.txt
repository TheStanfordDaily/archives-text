# BULL SESSION

Today Bull Sessioncr is on a spot. He has a new
part and he doesn't know his lines. Subbing for
him is the man who never gets up in the morning,
like the former Bull Sessioncr, probably unlike the
new editor. We recommend heartily his article on
Theodore, the individualistic duck, and we thank
him for stepping in where many people fear to
tread, but all would like to.â€”Bob Eiscnbach.
