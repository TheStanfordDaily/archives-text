# JUST DUCKING

### 
Ducks are very peculiar birds. They come in va
rious stock sizes, shapes and colors, and occasionally
you can get one custom built. In the back yard right
now is a duck which, for sundry reasons, bears the
name Theodore.
Theodore appears to be more or less a monstrosity,
if the term may be applied to water fowl. Any casual
observer would note that he is not a familiar stock
model. He is very large and heavy, and before he was
chased the length and breadth of a Mayfield lot, he
had beautiful white plumage. A thorough launder
ing, however, left Theodore wet, bedraggled, and con
siderably the worse for wear.

At present, Theodore is tied to small tree by a
rope around his left leg. Now, the amazing thing about
this bird is the manner in which he demonstrates his
intellectual capacity. He tugs constantly at the rope.
He wants to get away. Well, that's all right. I don't
know very many people, ducks or otherwise, who would
like to be tied to a tree by their left legs.
But while he tugs, he maintains a facial expression
which denotes the obvious maladjustment of the entire
situation, from his personal point of view. If you are
watching him, he sulks. If he does not know you are
near, he sits and thinks. His thought processes are,
apparently, staggering.
A climax was reached a while ago when I went
out to serve Theodore's lunch of bread and water, for
which he displays great distaste. As I cpproachcd with
the pan of food, that bird—may the saints be praised
—actually turned and barked at me. That sounds very
silly, but it is true. It was not a honk or a quack; it
was very definitely a bark.
The sound, preceded by a sort of hissing noise, was
most disconcerting, especially since it was emitted
from a duck. Theodore, sensing his triumph and su
periority over the situation, assumed a belligerent air
of aloofness, ruffled hLs feathers and settled back into
those staggering thought processes. I could do nothing
but retreat to the house.
Today I intend to question competent authorities on
this harrowing experience, which has left me shaken
and ill at ease. I can/stand a lot of things; I can take
Theodore's evident disgust, his aloofness, even his air
of intellectual superiority over my college education.
But I cannot steel myself to his infernal barking, and
I do not think I ever shall.
