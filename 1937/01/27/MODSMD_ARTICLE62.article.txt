# OUR HASHER

While everyone, or at least someone, seems to be in
the harking-back and how times is changed mood, I
will hark, hark, the bark to the days when the titanic
Daily Editor Mellinkoff conducted a campaign which
stated, in indisputable language, that the BAWLOUT
MUST GO. This is a particularly fitting time to philoso
phize on the subject of the evanescence of it all, seeing
that The* Daily is just having its semi-annual purge,
bccause MellinkofT is gone, but the Bawlout is still
here.
Everybody still gets his sadistic thrill out of finding
how many professors' scms flunked out their first quar
ter, and discovering such phenomenal averages as
0-53, particularly when they belong to certain houses.
If (he little lemon yellow volume only had pictures, its
stories of the hopes and longings of Stanford's unsung
and underslung heroes and heroines, would outrival
LIFE, even at the charter subscription rate. It is a
compendium of extremely useful knowledge. For in
stance, you can find out how many football players
are getting scholarships from official sources, that the
fire whistle 74 is the Alta Mesa, R.R. crossing, that
number 51 is the B.A.C. stables, that so-and-so's arc the
president, vice-president, treasurer, and secretary of
lota Sigma Pi (Women's National Chemical Fraternity,
stupid), however, it will not tell you if that blonde
sitting next to you dances like a gazelle or a gazook,
whether she bums cigarettes on a date, bums dates on
a cigarette, or whether she is interested more in
your ability to drive home or you as a person.
How I do ramble on.
In the days of the titanic editor, the assertion was
made that professors used the Bawlout too heavily.
For instance, the number 26 plus zero meant the fire
was on the Sandhill Road with a 2:30 lockout.
This was conclusively proven, as most things are, at
the afternoon tea that is held daily in the Econ de
partment.
Several professors were going over the records of a
renegade student who had been quite dilatory about
turning in his papers. After a pretty sloppy showing
at the beginning of the quarter, the student had totally
failed to turn in one paper, had submitted another at
a very late date.
The late paper, however, betrayed a deep and pene
trating insight into the workings of our whole social
structure, and the professors were arguing over the
question of giving the student a B, which he averaged
on his total papers or turning in an incomplete because
of the missing link. As the shadows began to lengthen,
the Keynesian theory was in the lead, and the B seemed
to be in the hag. At this juncture, though, n classical
economist suggested that the phenomenal late paper
was too late and too phenomenal to be true. By unani
mous vote a Bawlout was brought in, the student was
looked into, and his average was found to be minus
16. His grade was then set down as a D incomplete.
"But how," sighed the grade-giver, "shall I explain
it to the Registrar's office."
From his corner a quiet sociologist spoke up: "Just
write on the slip: "Inconsistency with the Bawlout."
The order was countersigned, and passed into the
record.
If the history department doesn't get of! the dime,
I'll just have to keep slinging mud at the economists.
