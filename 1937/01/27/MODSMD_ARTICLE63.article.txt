# CAMPUS OPINION
## BUILDING MOODS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While the university officials are
in the building mood, I would like to
make a suggestion.
From statistics that were printed
in The Daily last quarter, it is evi
dent that a good percentage of stu
dents own cars on the campus. Some
of these students keep their cars in
garages in Paly, others rent sheds in
the corporation yards, but the ma
jority leave their autos outside of
their respective living groups at
night, on the basis that it's cheaper
to have a new paint job than pay a
Paly garage exhorbitant prices.
A Paly garage may be accommo
dating, but it's still a pain-in-the
neck to have to drive down at night,
have one of the attendants drive you
back, and to have to wait around for
the car in the morning. Besides this,
the gasoline that is wasted in driv
ing back and forth to Paly boosts the
upkeep of the car.
Furthermore, the corporation yard
sheds are practically useless. They
are so far from any living group that
one might as well not have a car.
Besides this, they afford very little
protection as some of them leak, and
others have tar and oil on their
roofs so that a car placed within
them presents a spotted appearance.
I am sure that some of the car
owners of Stanford would appreciate

nice dry sheds placed conveniently
near to their living groups. These
sheds could be built cheaply, and I
am positive that within a year or two
the rent of these sheds would fully
cover their construction price. They
would not have to be as elaborate as
those in back of Roble.
I hope that those people with ga
rage troubles will take note of this
and express a few opinions, for the
rent of such a shed would be far be
low the price of a new paint job or
other repairs that are necessary to a
car because of exposure.
