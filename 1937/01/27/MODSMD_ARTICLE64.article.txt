Light and spotty in composition is
Lloyd Chase's COCKTAIL BAR at
San Francisco's Geary Theater. Hav
ing a theme that is a distinct parallel
to George Bernard Shaw's play,
PYGMALION, but a more or less or
iginal ending, COCKTAIL BAR
struggles along in true musical com
edy fashion.
Opening scene is in a New York
cocktail lounge. Taking a $25,000 bet,
James Kettle, ship owner, boasts to
his friend, Mark Huston, that he can
pick up the fifth man he sees and
marry him off to a millionnairess in
15 days.
Structurally, COCKTAIL BAR is
the offspring of a time-honored plot,
and its dialogue only occasionally
wakens the audience with snappy
quips. "Show-stcaler" Jack Goode,
as Kettle's hare-brained press
agent, Bouldini's and Joyce's dance,
"The Rhumba," and Princess Pierot
ti's sex appeal are the best the show
can offer the Stanford Rough.
Although Philip Tully and Wynne
Davis as Lamar and Kimball made
the best of their lines, I feel that the
audience was primarily interested in
such performances as Bob Long's
of Captain Oliver, the only one
aboard that didn't know his vessel
was at sea.
