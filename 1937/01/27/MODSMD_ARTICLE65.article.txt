# CONCERNING FLOODS

The Editor, Sir:
In past spring quarters when stu
dents have kicked in for the local
charity to the tune of $5000 or more,
have they ever thought much about
giving the other fellow a break, or
have they just been having a good
time for themselves?
Right now is a good time to wonder
about it, because 3000 miles east of
us a few of the fellow citizens are
having a pretty tough go of it and
not liking it much.
I may be wrong, but it seems to me
that if San Francisco or Los Angeles
were being shaken to a jelly by
earthquakes, it would be pretty grat
ifying to know that the students of
Cornell or Columbia had thought
enough about it to lend a good sub
stantial hand.
How about it? Would Stanford be
willing to dig into its collective jeans
to help those people, or would it be
more fun just to sit back and watch
the poor devils squirm?
