Pierre, of Pierre and Temple, the
danc« team at the Persian Room of
the Drake, showed how women
should be handled during the Stan
ford Night program last Friday when
he picked up his attractive dancing
partner and swung her over his
shoulder. Then he nonchalantly put
his hands in his pockets and went
into a mad whirl. But Temple didn't
fall off—which goes to show that
some women will stick by their men.
A swell act.
And for your information, the Fed
eral Communications Commission
has decided that radio stations will
not have to identify themselves in the
middle of continuous programs —
which means that from now on the
Metropolitan Opera Company broad
casts will not be interrupted. A real
break to end breaks
