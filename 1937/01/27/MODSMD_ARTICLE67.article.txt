# COMING EVENTS
## 
### 
Paramount will make a movie of
"One Man's Family"â€”which proves
what we've suspected about Zukor's
company slipping. During the de
pression it lost its dominance
over the film industry, and here's
one reason why . . . Brighter news
comes from the East . . . Ken Mur
ray and Oswald will succeed Burns
and Allen on April 7 over the Co
lumbia network . . . They deserved
the break after the up-hill fight they
made in putting over the Rinso pro
gram . . . But the sponsors didn't
think they should continue and re

placed them with YOUR Palsy-
Walsy Alsy Koelcr Jolson . . . Jol
son's doing all right . . . But no bet
ter than Murray . . . Arid personally
I prefer Oswald's "Oh yeah" to
"Mammy,"
