# No Car, Date Needed For F.D.R. Dance
## Lagunita, Roble Promise To Accompany Stags; Bids on Sale Today 
### 
Men without dates or cars will get
special consideration at the Presi
dent's Ball in the Women's Gym next
Saturday night. Any man in need of
a date may leave his name and height
at the A.S.S.U. office when he buys
his ticket to the dance, and a date
with a Roble or Lagunita girl will be
arranged for him.
Both dormitories are within easy
walking distance of the Gym, so the
necessity of a car is thereby re
moved. This plan was developed by
the members of the committee for
the affair yesterday and was ap
proved by A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds, Carlene Brown, social
chairman of Lagunita, and Betty
Grover, president of Roble.
Funds To Aid Cure
Stanford's celebration of President
Roosevelt's birthday will provide

Ralph Keating, Boyd White, Lewis
Hanchett, and Don Muni are the

them has received beneficial treat
ment at the Foundation where some
of them were intimate with President
Roosevelt.

tra will be featured at the ball. Spe
cial entertainment will include songs
by Shirley Jones and Bud Bernhard,
skits by Hal "Christopher Columbus"
Kahn during the intermissions, and
vocal selections by the Glee Club, in

Bids on Sale
Bids are $1 per couple and are
available at the A.S.S.U. office from
1 to 5 every afternoon. Bill Ward is
in charge of the sale of the bids. Ex
penses will be cut to the minimum so
that most of the funds can go to
charity.
Palo Alto's celebration of the
President's birthday will take place
tomorrow night so that there will be
no conflict with the campus dance. It
will take place at the Varsity The
ater, and featured entertainment will

play, Barbara Curtis will dance, and
other participants in last Fall's Gaie
ties are scheduled to perform. The

feature picture, "Happy Go Lucky,"
and a revival of "The Three Little
Pigs."
