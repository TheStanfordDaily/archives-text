Don't Write! Don't Telegraph!
Send the Daily! Better than a letter,
cheaper than a telegram, much more in
formative than either —that's the "Daily,"
and that's what the folks back home will
say about it.
Let them in on what's happening at Stan
ford. They're interested! And the "Daily"
will give them the background on current
i
campus events. Then, when you write home
about that house dance, or the Roble For
mal, or the rally next week, they'll have the
complete picture. Only the "Daily" can
give it to them. Subscribe now! $3.25 for
the rest of the year, and the bill can go
home, too.
