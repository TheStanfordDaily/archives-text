Clearing of the 1500-mile danger

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 27. —
A circus train, contributed by
the Cole Bros.-Clyde Beatty
Circus, is on its way to the
Southern Indiana flood zone. It
will be used as a hospital near
Charleston, Ind. The train,
which includes live fully equip
ped Pullmans, a dining car and
four portable gasoline-power
lighting units, was taken out of
winter storage at Rochestei*,
Ind.

strip would constitute ihe greatest
mass evacuation in the nation.
Floods Raging
Already the floods, raging down
the Ohio and pouring into the Mis
sissippi, have forced more than
1,000,000 from their homes, according
to the Red Cross.
The authentic death toll is 119.
In Washington, War Department
heads ordered equipment and thou
sands of men massed along the new
est danger front. They feared the
billion dollar levee system would be
cracked when the foaming Ohio
flood crest swept past Cairo, 111., and
joined the Mississippi in a rush i
southward.
Levees Not Finished
It will be the crucial test of bul
warks built after the 1927 flood dis
aster, reaching down the Mississippi
Valley from Cairo to the Gulf.
Engineers said these not yet had
been built to full strength.
The Army in Washington planned
to remove residents from lowlands
in a 100-mile strip—so miles on each
side of the Mississippi.
Plans were rushed to dispatch
thousands of railroad cars and trucks
to lowlands on both sides of the river.
The War Department emphasized
that its program announced after
conference with President. Roosevelt
was precautionary. The emergency
probably need not be expected for
several days.
Officials said evacuation will not
begin in any area until levees either
burst or appear doomed.
A War Department bulletin yes
terday said:
"The War Department and others
concerned are making plans for as- j
sisting the people in the lower Mis- I
sissippi Valley in evacuating to high
ground, should it become necessary.
"From present knowledge it ap-1
pears likely that the flood waters will
pass down the valley without causing !
wide inundation — and people must j
not become panic stricken."
Army in Charge
"Evacuation headquarters," with |
high ranking Army officers in com
mand, were to be established at |
Jackson. Miss.
Engineers based much of their fear |
of disaster on reports that the levee
system was designed to carry safely
2,400,000 cubic feet of water per sec- |
ond in the liississippi's main stream, j
The Ohio River alone now is carry- j
ing 3,000,000 cubic feet per second.
The Ohio, rushing toward a crest
at Evansville, Ind., Paducah, Ky., i
and Cairo, was receding or stationary
in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and portions
of Indiana and Kentucky.
Property damage exceeded $300,-
000,000.
Deaths Increase
Red Cross workers described the
flood as the "greatest national emer
gency since the World War."
A "tremendous" increase in pneu
monia deaths was reported, particu
larly at Louisville, Ky., where
Health Commissioner Hugh L. Rod
man Leavell said he believed 200
succumbed to disease.
The dead by states:
Kentucky, 2G; Ohio, 15; Illinois, G;
Arkansas, 23; Missouri, 17; West Vir
ginia, 10; Indiana, 12; Tennessee, 5;
Pennsylvania, 3 Mississippi, 2.
