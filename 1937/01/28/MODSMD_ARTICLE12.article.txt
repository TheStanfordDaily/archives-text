# Janitor Debates Foreman Tonight
## 
### 
"What's the janitor question all
about?" John M. Brown, local fore
man of the American Building Main
tenance Company, and Donald Mc-
Lean, of the Janitors Union, will each
present their answer to that question
at an opening meeting tonight of the
Stanford Chapter of the American
Student Union.
The meeting is scheduled to begin
at 8:15 in the downstairs lounge
room of the Women's Clubhouse.
According to Louise Alauzet,
president of the local A.S.U. chapter,
the forum will provide an opportu
nity for a thorough and impartial
consideration of both sides of the re
cent controversy over the unioniza
tion of Stanford's janitors." The
meeting is open to all interested
students.
