# Contest Fate Up to Women, Cardinals
## President of Conference Agrees to Discussion Of King â€“ Queen Race 
### 
Proposed by Cardinals last night
was a meeting with Women's Con
ference next Monday to solve the
king-queen contest deadlock cre
ated by objections of the latter body.
Approached by Chairman Chick
Franich, Conference head Bobby
Kimball agreed that "a joint session
would be the best way to reach an
amicable settlement of the popu
larity contest issue."
Franich explained the reason for
calling the meeting was to hit on
some program to assure the success
of Masque Ball and Convalescent
Home Drive.
Kimball and Esther Pelton ob
jected before Ex Committee Tuesday
evening that the king-queen contest,
as planned by Cardinals to raffle off
the offices, ran counter to precedent
established following last year's de
cision by Ex Committee.
At that time. Bob Gros presented a
recommendation censoring popular
ity campaigns, especially those in
volving a money issue. This sug
gestion did not attain the strength of
a by-law.
Other business disposed of by Car
dinals at their meeting last night
included a vote of commendation
for the volunteer work done by Ed
Middleton for the Red Cross flood
drive.
V/ith approval of a $31.50 requisi
tion for a Cardinal page in the 1937
Quad, the session dispersed.
