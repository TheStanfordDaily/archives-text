# Hello Louisville! D.G.'s Cellar All Washed Up
## 
### 
D.G.'s awakened yesterday morn
ing to find themselves hurled into
the flood area. Swirling waters filled
the basement of the house. Trunks
floated in two feet of water. Even
the furnace was water logged.
Police and fire departments re
fused to send aid, stating that what
the D.G.'s most needed was a plumb
er. When the plumber arrived, he
discovered that a broken hot water
tank had caused the trouble.
