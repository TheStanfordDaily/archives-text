Political oratory and public opin
ion are the chief interests of Leland
T. Chapin, professor of public speak
ing. During his recent visit to Eu
rope he studied the reaction of va
rious publics to the speeches of Pre
mier Blum, Prime Minister Baldwin,
and the British Fascist leader, Os
wald Mosley.
"The Public Order Bill recently
passed by the British Parliament is
an indication that Great Britain has
at last found it necessary to take
definite action to control political
demonstrations, which have been
used effectively in European coun
tries during recent years," Mr.
Chapin said.
The bill was urged after the Fascist
disturbance in London last October 4,
when 5000 Fascists were hemmed in
by 100,000 Communists. From one
point of view, according to Professor
Chapin, the agitation for the bill is
an admission of Fascist strength in
Britain.
"One amusing feature of the bill
developed over the attempted defini
tions of a 'political uniform,' which

| the bill forbids," he smiled. "This
! was aimed at the Fascist blackshirt,
but the Scotsmen were afraid that it
would prevent them from wearing
the beloved kilt. It was claimed, how
ever, that the kilt is a 'national'
rather than a political uniform."
Professor Chapin first became in
terested in propaganda methods
when he was able to observe the
Russian communistic activities in
China in 1923-27. He has spent a
number of years abroad, making
China his headquarters.
Immediately after receiving his
college degree. Professor Chapin j
sailed for the Orient, where he 1
taught, wrote for a newspaper, and |
studied t'v Chinese classics. He
hiked over 90 miles on foot into the I
Igorote country in the Philippines,
and visited Borneo and the Sulu
| Islands.
Later he journeyed to Europe, i
spending several months in France
and England. Last year Professor
Chapin returned to Great Britain,
visiting Guatemala. El Calvador. and i
i Nicaragua before arriving in Europe [
