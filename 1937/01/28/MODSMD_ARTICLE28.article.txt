ROME I'BHR CARMEL
Carmel's mess of nookes and
shoppes seems to multiply every year
in the rubbit manner, and it is too
bad that the mobs of hoi polloi who
pay the 40-dollar-a-week rents grow
yearly more interested in all-night
carouses than in the quaint charm of
ail the commercial duckiness.

Already around the campus there
seem to be hushed moves in the di
rection of lining up desirable shacks
for the ten cataclysmic days of Easter
vacation. A desirable shack, in this
instance, appears to be one which is
equidistant from the beach and the
grocery store while at the same time
something more than whispering dis
tance from the nearest neighbor.
When the time comes for the horde
to descend upon the little village,
there will be a peck of shuddering
on the part of the townsfolk as they
watch the rabble tear up and down
the 17-rnile drive looking for some
body's house where a party is ru
mored in progress. But if the soul
can be fed on the wild rumblings of
the surf, the taxes call for payment
in hard coin of the realm, and 40
dollars a week for four rooms is not
quite a gold mine, but almost.
The shuddering townsfolk I refer
to are not those who seem to choose
Cannel because it is a nice suburb,
but those pseudo-Bohemians who
thrive on aesthetic inspiration and
picturesque cheapness. As far as I
can see, this business of being a Bo
hemian seems to require the Bo
hemee to sell himself on a lot of
tilings that look cute on the outside
but which are, after all, pretty cheesy
at the center. Like convincing him
self that being a dibble-dabbler in a
lot of the "arts" is infinitely superior
to tackling the intricacies of foreign
exchange or working a slide rule. Or
stuffing himself with a lot of poetical
trivia and then looking down from
the intellectual heavens upon the
people who read the Saturday Eve
ning Post and Mandrake the Magi
cian.
And the worst part about the su
percilious intellectuals is that when
they do come down to earth they
land more completely in the gutter
than the most chewed-up cigar butt.
There are none who can spin slimier
yarns than a couple of the long
haired bovs who have smelt one cork
too many.

So when the legions of Roman

Americans swarm down on Carmel, I i
cannot weep for some of the artiness j
that is bound to be driven out. With j
even the grocery stores and lunch
counters styled in front like an Eng
lish inn and in back with painted |
tongue-and-groove siding, the whole j
town seems to reek with a soupy air J
of prettied falsity that makes the j
ocean, which has real salt water in
it, the only thing which does not
pretend to be something else.
If the Roman Americans who ar
rive to loot the sanctuary bring with j
them the Southern California beach
complex, it is indeed regrettable, bul
at least they will honestly consider
a rain at the height of the season a
cursed nuisance and not a cascade of
liquid diamonds sparkling out of the
murky heavens.
