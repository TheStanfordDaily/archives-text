# Dates Are Taboo As Frosh Phone Connections Fail
## 
### 
"But the phone can't be out of
order. I've got to get a date for the
jolly-up," was the wail of Encina's
frosh last night.
Service to and from Encina from
early afternoon to late last night was
completely, dead. The rest of the
phones on 3121—Branner, Toyon, and
the Union—could be used only one at
a time. And even then, only incom
ing calls went through.
Only one of the 12 trunks for these
four dormitories was in operation,
and private phones were also dead.
All of this made life a spring
zephyr for 3121 Operator Harry
Webb. "This is the kind of a job you
ought to get," he said yesterday
afternoon. "Four bits an hour for
sitting around." Webb was optimistic
enough to believe that the trouble
would not be fixed for two days.
But old tel and tel found the
trouble last night. They soldered to
gether the cable that had been
burned out by a near-by steam pipe.
Unauthenticated reports laid the
trouble to the present excavation
near Encina by the P. G. & E. This
was emphatically denied by L. E.
Wolbert last night. "Why, the ex
cavation couldn't have a thing to do
with the telephone trouble," he de
clared.
Telephone company officials agreed
that P. G. & E. was not involved.
