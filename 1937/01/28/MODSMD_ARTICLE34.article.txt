# Perkins Asks Congress For Strike Power
## Labor Secretary Seeks Help in Coping With General Motors Strike 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (U.R). —
Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins
tonight called on Congress for broad
power to enable the Federal govern
ment to cope with serious industrial
disputes such as the General Motors
Corporation strike.
In a letter to Speaker William B.
Bankhead, D., Ala., and Senate Ma
jority Leader Joe T. Robinson, D.,
Ark., Miss Perkins asked that legis
lation be expedited authorizing the
Labor Department to subpoena
books, papers, records, and witnesses
of participants in an industrial dis
pute and to investigate the trouble.
"In this way only can the more
serious problems involved in impor
tant strikes be handled on a sound
basis," she wrote.
The Cabinet officer said the pro
posed legislation was not directed
solely at the General Motors Corpo
ration whose executives declined an
invitation by Miss Perkins to meet
with John L. Lewis and other union
leaders in an attempt to mediate the
automobile strike.
"It is inevitable, however, that
participants to any industrial dis
cord under investigation would meet
in the same room, even if they are
giving conflicting testimony," she
explained.
Miss Perkins made public copies
of the letter after an hour and one-*
half conference with Lewis, Sidney
Hillman, Charles P. Howard, John
Biophy, and Lee Pressman, leaders
of the Committee for Industrial Or
ganization which is financing the
General Motors strike, and Homer
Martin, president, and Windham
Mortimer and Ed Hall, vice-presi
dents, of the United Automobile
Workers.
Assistant Secretary of Labor Ed
ward F. McGrady also took part in
the conference. Miss Perkins said
no further word had been received
from Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., president
of General Motors Corporation, who
wrote her that further conferences
with the union leaders could not be
held until sit-down strikers had
been called out of two Fisher Body
plants in Flint, Mich.
