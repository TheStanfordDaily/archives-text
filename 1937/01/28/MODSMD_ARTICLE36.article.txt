# Roble Goes Row; Calls Exchange Dinner 'Good Idea"
## First Contacts of Many Girls with Row Men Are Termed Successful 
### 
The Roble - fraternity exchange j
dinner last night, marking the new j
women's first venture into one of
the razzed "Stanford tradi- :
tions," produced some comparatively ;
unbiased opinions on the activity: |
Barbara Riley, freshman and Kap
pa pledge: "A majority of the girls
seemed to be interested, and I think i
that exchange dinners are a good i
idea."
Boh Fullerton, Beta: "Most boys ,
worry about getting roped in for
these things and forget that the girls ;
feel about the same." Bab success- I
fully found a flaw in the "unbiased"
system.
Helen Iluckins, future Pi Phi, who ;
went to the Beta house: "I think it's
a grand idea. This is the first contact |
many of the girls have had with Row I
men, and it helps those who are al- â– 
ready acquainted to renew theirs." 1
Mort d'Evelyn, Sigma Chi presi
dent: "Exchange dinners have long j
been recognized as a healthy and j
democratic trend in the social life of i
Stanford, and a lot more could sue- ;
eessfully be carried out during the '
coming spring. Inter-fraternity ex
change dinners seem to me to be
particularly desirable."
Audis Davis, chairman of the din- j
ner committee, who put in 20 hours' j
work on the affair, said that more I
women who had pledged signed up j
to attend than those who have not j
affiliated, which can prove anyth ng. j
Unknown Phi Psi: "The fellows \
are all for it. We should have more. |
I am making this statement for Bill
McDonald, our house president."
Coline Upshaw, D.G. nugget: "I
think all the girls looked forward to !
it very much."
John Shallenberger, Phi Delt: "Au
dis did a ft he job. Let's have more." |
Only one freshman woman came j
out against exchange dinners; said
she thought they were "stiff" and
"silly."
(ieorge Veness, Phi Psi: "A darn
good idea."
Unsung Hero: "They had swell
mashed potatoes. I saw a very pretty
girl there, but I wish I'd paid the
$2.50 fine and stayed away."
Second U.H.: "You should have
heard the alibis I Jugged out."
Best time of the evening was re- :
ported to have been had at the Beta
house.
Lomax Turner. Phi Delt, tryoutee
for assistant yell leader: "Exchange |
idea excellent, Roble girls are nicer
than ever before."
No. 1 Tatastrophe: A piece of pic !
fell in Beta Jeeb Halaby's lap.
