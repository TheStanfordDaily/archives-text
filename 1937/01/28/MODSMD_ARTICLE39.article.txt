DEAR KLAI'R.
WORTHY PREDECESSOR:
Well, Phil, I've been hanging
around watching you grind out a
column every day since school start
ed in the fall, wondering how in the
devil you could keep doing that and
continue acting as intramural man
ager and at the same time keep up
that not-to-be-ashamcd-of bawlout
average.
I used to think that maybe you'd
get very, very sick of trying to find
something to say day in and day
out, but the doggoned old Slants
kept coming out just the same.
You have done a swell job, too,
kid. It's guys like you that make it
tough on guys like me, trying to get
across something right after some
whip has turned out a masterpiece
based on plenty of experience.
But then it's going to be easier for
me, too, because I just step in when
everything is rolling in great style.
It was different for you in the fall,
what with school just starting and
everything at a standstill. Football
was the big thing then, in addition,
and football really is big.
So I start today, old Sad-Eyes, on
the way to the end of the school
year, with lots to look forward to
and plenty to look back upon if I
come to a blank wall. Through the
rest of the basketball season, and
through baseball, and track, and
swimming, and t ugby, and the many
other spring sports at Stanford I will
be writing Slants, all the time hoping
1 am doing as good a job as Klauber
has done.
Speaking of making contacts, Phil,
I have made a few over in the B.A.C.
and around since fall, and I have yet
to find anyone that doesn't meet the
qualifications you stated yesterday—
"as fine and high a type of gentle
man as you'll ever want to meet."
Men like John Bunn, and Don
Liebendorfer, and Harry Maloney,
and the others in the athletics branch
have been always cordial, always
willing to waste a few minutes with
me. Not only that, it is pretty swell
to be able to walk into a place where
you are not known and find people
that smile and say hello whether
they recognize you or not.
If working with such an edit board
as Eisenbach, Botsford, Frost, Blaik
ie, and Sweet means anything, this
writing a daily column ought to be a
cinch. And that business staff—that
ought to be a cinch, too, arguing that
gang out of space. That guy Brown
isn't so tough, when you get to know
him.
