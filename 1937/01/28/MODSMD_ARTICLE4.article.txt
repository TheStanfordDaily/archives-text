# NYA Record Cards Due Today
## 
### 
Undergraduate students on NYA
for the first time this quarter must
turn in a complete record of hours
worked during the past period and
must sign their release cards in the
Student Employment Office, accord
ing to Mrs. Irene Coverley.
In order to clarify the rules of the
National Youth Administration, the
student employment director issued a
series of statements on the subject
yesterday. The NYA payroll month
includes the period between the 25th
of one month and the 24th of the
next, and the hours of work allotted
to the student must be completed
within this time.
Supplies of time sheets are ob
tainable in the accounting office in
the Administration Building, and a
record of each week's work signed by
both the student and his supervisor
must be turned in there each week.
The final monthly time sheet must be
turned in before 5 o'clock on the 24th
of the month. On the 25th, 26th, and
27th new release cards are available
in the Student Employment Office
and must be signed.
