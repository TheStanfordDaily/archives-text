# Frosh Cagers In 47-36 Win Over S.F.J.C.
## Yearlings Rally to Break Four-point Lead; Game Slow but Accurate 
### HARRY PRESS 
In a game made ridiculous be
cause of a slippery floor, Stanford's
frosh hoopsters last night kept up
their reputation of a powerful fin
ishing team in winning their seventh
consecutive game, this time against
San Francisco Jaysee, by a count of
47-36.
The game started slowly, with
most of the players on the floor the
majority of the time. San Francisco
went into an early four-point lead i
by virtue of two 20-looters by Kotta i
and Phelan.
It was not until five minutes had :
ticked away that the frosh rang the |
bell. Anderson intercepted a pass, |
and moving down slowly, shot a bul- j
let pass to Lafallle in the corner, !
who whipped the ball to Siebert j
thundering down the center. Tom's J
one-handed overhead shot netted
Stanford's first score.
The yearlings immediately moved
into the lead, never again to be
headed, when Siebert made good a
free throw, and Anderson, with the
help of every man on the team, made
a fast break count for two points.
Playing a slow but accurate-pass
ing game, the frosh worked steadily
ahead to lead at half-time, 26-17. The
first half was featured by Lafaille in
tercepting passes like our boy Hank,
and Lyon catching long passes over
his shoulder a la Moscrip.
The floor got so bad by the end of
the half that the game, spectators
included, was lifted bodily to the
Encina gym, where the second pe
riod was played.
Again starting slowly, the frosh
got nowhere for a few minutes, while
the Jaysees crept up to within four
points. Staehle and Siebert, how
ever, decided to get hot, with the
result that the score soon read 40-27.
Highlighting the second half was
Staehle's shooting. Lew took six
shots, all of them from at least 30
feet out, and made five of them count
for digits. Siebert was high man for
the game with a 13-point total.

bell. Anderson intercepted a pass, |
and moving down slowly, shot a bul- j
let pass to Lafallle in the corner, !
who whipped the ball to Siebert j
thundering down the center. Tom's J
one-handed overhead shot netted
Stanford's first score.
The yearlings immediately moved
into the lead, never again to be
headed, when Siebert made good a
free throw, and Anderson, with the
help of every man on the team, made
a fast break count for two points.
Playing a slow but accurate-pass
ing game, the frosh worked steadily
ahead to lead at half-time, 26-17. The
first half was featured by Lafaille in
tercepting passes like our boy Hank,
and Lyon catching long passes over
his shoulder a la Moscrip.
The floor got so bad by the end of
the half that the game, spectators
included, was lifted bodily to the
Encina gym, where the second pe
riod was played.
Again starting slowly, the frosh
got nowhere for a few minutes, while
the Jaysees crept up to within four
points. Staehle and Siebert, how
ever, decided to get hot, with the
result that the score soon read 40-27.
Highlighting the second half was
Staehle's shooting. Lew took six
shots, all of them from at least 30
feet out, and made five of them count
for digits. Siebert was high man for
the game with a 13-point total.

In a game made ridiculous be
cause of a slippery floor, Stanford's
frosh hoopsters last night kept up
their reputation of a powerful fin
ishing team in winning their seventh
consecutive game, this time against
San Francisco Jaysee, by a count of
47-36.
The game started slowly, with
most of the players on the floor the
majority of the time. San Francisco
went into an early four-point lead i
by virtue of two 20-looters by Kotta i
and Phelan.
It was not until five minutes had :

bell. Anderson intercepted a pass, |
