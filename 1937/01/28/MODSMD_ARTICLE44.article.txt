# Basketballers Balled Up as Janitor Waxes Not Wisely But Far Too Well
## 
### GORDY FROST 
The art of Sonja Henie stole the
show in the Pavilion yestdrday after
noon while Stanford's 30 basketball
ers threw aside thoughts of two im
posing meetings with U.S.C.'s once
defeateH Trojans in Los Angeles this
week-end.
Yes, even the fact that Sparky
Robertson has the llu and is defi
nitely out of competition down
South, and the good news that Howie
Turner's flattened arch is vastly im
proved, were thrown out of the lime
light by Stanford's skating basket
ball team.
It all came about through a jani
tor's breach. Bunn issnod orders to
give the Pavilion hardwood a once
over with the liquid wax yesterday,
but somebody didn't understand. The
floor was practically washed with
wax.
And so it was that Bunn and the
boys turned out to find their favo
rite playground turned into a ydung
skating rink — and they used it as
such. Any attempt to scrimmage was
out, even floor shots were difficult.
All hands took more spills than any
California game has offered.
Between glides, however, Bunn
found time to announce that Robert
son's spot on the traveling squad will
be filled by Bill Shuette, that Dick
Lyons will travel instead of Jack
Kessle, and that Howie Turner will
go if the doctors give their consent
today. Chances that Turner will ac
tually see play were, however, "very
very slight."
So tonight, when the Lark pulls
out of Paly station, Stanford's bas
ketball destinies will again take the
road, the same team, with the men
tioned exceptions, that rolled some
7000 miles last month.
With them will go two managers,
Coach Bunn, Dr. Northway, team
physician, and a fiock of blankets—
the latter because reports have fil
tered through that the Pan-Pacific
Auditorium, scene of Friday and

Saturday night's affair, is not heated.
Still, close followers of Stanford's
undefeated quintet tell us that if
the boys-are really "hot," the blan
kets are excess baggage, and if such
condition does exist, U.S.C.'s strong
Trojan outfit will agree.

such. Any attempt to scrimmage was
out, even floor shots were difficult.
All hands took more spills than any
California game has offered.
Between glides, however, Bunn
found time to announce that Robert
son's spot on the traveling squad will
be filled by Bill Shuette, that Dick
Lyons will travel instead of Jack
Kessle, and that Howie Turner will
go if the doctors give their consent
today. Chances that Turner will ac
tually see play were, however, "very
very slight."
So tonight, when the Lark pulls
out of Paly station, Stanford's bas
ketball destinies will again take the
road, the same team, with the men
tioned exceptions, that rolled some
7000 miles last month.
With them will go two managers,
Coach Bunn, Dr. Northway, team
physician, and a fiock of blankets—
the latter because reports have fil
tered through that the Pan-Pacific
Auditorium, scene of Friday and

Saturday night's affair, is not heated.
Still, close followers of Stanford's
undefeated quintet tell us that if
the boys-are really "hot," the blan
kets are excess baggage, and if such
condition does exist, U.S.C.'s strong
Trojan outfit will agree.
