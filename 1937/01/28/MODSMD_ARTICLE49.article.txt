# Lagunita Losing 1,000,000 Gallons Of Aqua Per Day
## 
### 
Heavy rain for the next three or!
four days will fill Lagunita within |
two weeks, although the lake is in
some danger at present of drying up, i
according to Henry Maier of the!
Corporation Yard.
For the last four days, the lake has :
been losing a million gallons each j
day, so there were only 36 '•» million !
gallons yesterday. But continued
rains will bring the level up to the j
official rating of "full"—113 million j
gallons.
So Farm water activities will soon
be in full swing, with a score of ca- j
noes available. Two of these will be j
rented at 50 cents per hour, and the
rest are owned by the various living
groups.
Climax of the aquatics will be the
traditional water carnival to be held
about the middle of spring quarter.
Meanwhile, Stanford's valiant little
lake strives to get the edge on the
900 gallons of water that seep away
each minute, so that boatsmen and
couples will not be disappointed.
