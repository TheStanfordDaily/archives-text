# Lame Duck
## 
### 
Since this is the lame-duck edition of The
Daily, spent principally in gnawing fingernails
and gazing out the window to see if the Mis
sissippi has broken through the levees yet, I
might as well fill the columns with lame-duck
material, until Eis takes overholt at 12 o'clock
Friday night.
Cardinal Killefer broke into my slumbers last
quarter by introducing Jean Pierre Le Mee, 19-
year-old French student, who was touring col
lege campi to report on American social life for
the French government. I showed him through
the Shack, explained that the waste paper on
the floor was there quite by accident, that I
was just getting around to straightening up my
desk when he came in. I quite proudly showed
him the practically noiseless telephone booth,
the printing press, the dark room, and Eisen
bach.
In my proprietary pride, however, 1 neglected
to interview him upon what he thought about
the campus. This allowed the New York Times
to scoop The Daily by three months. (But I
really don't mind this nearly as much as having
the Palo Alto Times scoop us every day.)
This was forcefully brought to my attention
just yesterday afternoon, when I finally got
around to cleaning up my desk, and found a
clipping from the New York Times of Novem
ber 24. The New York Times did not neglect to
interview the gentleman and this is what it
found:
"What amazed him most was that American
students had such a good time. In fact, he
thought their life 'too lovely' for French stu
dents. If it were all transplanted suddenly to
France, he said, the students there wouldn't
think of working." As it is now, life for them
is all 'work, work, work.'
"He found a vast difference between the stu
dent of the West and the student of the East.
The former, he said, was as unlike the latter as
Ihe latter was unlike a Frenchman.
" 'The students don't work very hard in the
West," he reported. "All they could talk about
was politics and sports. Everything was parties
â€”singing parties, bridge parties, dancing par
ties, radio parties, and week-end parties. The
University of California at Los Angeles is very
near Hollywood and all the girls there seemed
lo think of going into the movies instead of
working.'
"The East was different, he said. At Bryn
Mawr none of the girls shouted and students
really worked. Columbia and N.Y.U. did not
interest him; they were too similar 'to what they
have in Paris.' He said they lacked campus life
which so enthralled him everywhere else.
"Le Mee will sail for home on the French
liner Normandie. He will take with him a re
port for the French Ministry of Education. In
that report the six principal American features
that he recommends for French universities are
playing fields, fraternities, and clubs, large din
ing rooms, where students can eat together, the
hanging of good reproductions of great works
of art throughout college buildings, the estab
lishment of university theaters and the pub
lishing of college magazines and newspapers."
The hanging of reproductions of art works
ihrough French college buildings seems a bit
like carrying coals to Newcastle. The idea of
introducing to France America's extra-curricu
lar high blood-pressure as recommended by
Jean Pierre's five-point program is novel and
pretty, but like Daily editors at this time of the
volume, it won't work.
Because the extra-curricular hyperboles such*
as playing fields, fraternities, dramatics, and
publications are expanded in just those areas
where the students don't work very hard.
In France, the idea that everyone should get
an "education" has not followed on the heels
of a rapidly expanding machine economy. They
have not felt the consequent crowding of their
universities with the vast hordes of uneasy
youths sprung from a disintegrated family life
and characterized by the purposelessness of
modern students.
We have noticed it at Stanford, particularly,
as more and more of our students have been
drawn from urban centers. This came on the
heels of the traditional "rough" reaction against
attempts at culture, which was nothing more
nor less than the West's inheritance of the fron
tier tradition.
On top of this, we have the hardening of the
arteries in the educational process and its fail
ure, particularly on college levels, to keep pace
with its own discoveries in psychology and so
ciology. Whatever changes have been affected
have been towards the increasing department
alization and specialization of knowledge, mak
ing it less in tune with the needs of the stu '
dents, who have come to college to get a "gen !
eral education' and to get an education that'
can be applied (Chicago President Hutchins to'
I ho contrary). |

The result (trying to get back to the point)
has caused the students to feel that studies are
but the sideshow of the college life, that in
"activities" is where you really get your edu
cation. And if the students are getting educa
tion in our modern colleges, it certainly is in the
activities if at all, because they aren't getting it
in the books.
France, which hasn't had this spectacular
growth in school registrations, therefore should
noi takes its tip from the American types, which
are overexpanded and quite typical of a leisure
class which doesn't quite know what to do
with itself, but from the English model, where
athletics are meant for play, where debating is
an integral part of practically every cultured
man's experience, where friendships are fos
tered not according to ego-boosting extrinsic
groups, but according to intellectual and social
interests.
Stanford, then, is a typical example of a mal
adjusted system brought about by a dynamic
society. I don't think anyone should question
that these new hordes of aimless students
clamoring at the gates should be educated by
someone. A society cannot exist in which only
the few are awakened to an intelligent curiosity
in their environment. A vital culture is not
supported by only the coteries and cliques.
But right now, Stanford is not stimulating the
imagination or the intelligent interests of the
lost generation.
