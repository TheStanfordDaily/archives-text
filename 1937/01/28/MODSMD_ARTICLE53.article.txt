CULTURE—BY THE SPOONFUL
There were many peculiarities of Tuesday's sym
phony concert that deserve public note, but the best of
them all concerns neither the symphony nor the Pa
vilion, but a rich old dame.
We might talk about the fact that Pavilion accoustics
are lousy and that you could hear the wheels turning
in the performance of Die Meistersinger, but there's
little that God or Mrs. Armsby could do about them,
and there's much both God and Mrs. Armsby did to
bring the concert to us.
* * * *
So we'll stick to the rich old dame who didn't have
the manners of a waterfront slattern, but who had the
money to buy her way out of a slattern's world.
* # * *
We're glad we don't know her name. And if she's
read this far, she's glad, too. But we're glad not be
cause we'd take such exquisite pleasure in exposing her,
simply because her anonymity makes it easier to talk
about her as a type.
She was the old gal who crashed out of the Pavilion
in the most deliciously vicious part of "Le Roi Malgre
Lui."
And for that we can't glame her. Except that the old
dame obviously didn't know the difference between
Chabrier and Beethoven.
And she did know that the concert would be over
soon, almost as quickly as she could disturb two rows
of listeners and stomp down the main aisle.

And when she was in the catacombs outside the au
ditorium, she bellowed ostentatiously, shall we say fog
hornishly, for her car—which she knew wouldn't be
there until the concert let out.
* # * *
In many external characteristics, we suspect the
woman lived in Paly.
But basically, she is the type that populates sym
phony concerts—so bored with a two-hour medication
of culture that even being an exhibitionist is all right
—if it will get her out.
Like millions of her kind, she has to be seen getting
educated. It doesn't matter if she gets the education.
Which is why we suggest Mr. Montcux be equipped
with a machine gun.
