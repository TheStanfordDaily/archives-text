# OUR HASHER

### 
Since the history department didn't come through
with any gags today, I'll have to record the achievement
of the Poli Sci department and the Registrar's Office.
To look at the shelves and shelves of indices and
cross indices and criss-cross indices, all put down with
a finality and precision that seems merciless, one would
never guess that there is a human spirit that walks on
the face of the void. But there is.
Our plot unfolds with a tuition note application in
the Dean of Men's office. The petitioner, despite his
good morals, fine family life, and ability to live sub
marginally on love or money, did not have the neces
sary C average for the hail of a note.
The principal trouble was that the student had just
finished the first quarter of a continuous course that
lasted t>ver two quarters. This resulted in a plus n,
which counts neither one way or the other in the Bawl
out, until the second quarter is completed. This left
the worthy with an average of minus two.
Without the tuition note, the student could not re
turn to school. So his plight was taken before one of
the cross indices in the registrar's office who went to
the Registrar. The Poli Sci professor was brought in.
He was asked if it would hurt his conscience too much
to give the student a B minus incomplete instead of a
plus n. The prof answered it would hurt his conscience
but not too much. The cross index then asked the prof
if he would step in her office to make out the necessary
slip, because accuracy requires that a complete record
be kept of these things. And accuracy is quite an
important thing to a cross index. So the prof mused
over his little blue card, not being able to decide just
what reason to check for giving an incomplete. On the
little blue card there is included every imaginable
reason from incompetence of the professor to union
ization of the janitors, but nothing quite seemed to fit
the circumstances. Finally, the prof put his check in
the square after incompetence of the professor. But
this flustered the cross index no end, because accuracy
in such niatlers is vital, as I have explained before.
"Why don't you," she mused, "put down: 'After talk
ing to Dr. Mitchell.'"
The prof, anxious to get home to his happy fireside,
compromised his principles, put down: "After talking
to Dr. Mitchell," pleasing the cross index no end.
The matter was so recorded, the petitioner got his
grade points, his release, and his tuition note. He stayed
in school, where he became strong and healthy. He
prospered, found the ideal woman, married, and set
tled down in a vine-covered hut. The ideal woman
knitted on little, frilly things. Pretty soon, along came
the little tuition notes, falling due one after another.
But little did they realize that if it hadn' been for the
alertness and accuracy of a cross-index iti the regis
trar's office, their very existence would l>e clouded with
uncertainty and shame.
