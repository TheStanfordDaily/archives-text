EVENTS TO COME

The Monte Carlo Ballet Russe be
gins its first engagement at the Me
morial Opera House tonight with a
splendid program. "Aurora's Wed
ding," with music by Tschaikowsky,
choreography by Fokine, and settting
by Leon Bakst is a pageant of Rus
sian Court Life.
Anyone who heard the San Fran
cisco Symphony orchestra play the
opulent "Symphonie Fantastique" of
Berlioz last week would be interest
ed in hearing it again, this time the
subject of a ballet by Leonide Mas
sine. Produced first in London last
summer, the ballet depicts Berlioz's
passion for the actress, Henrietta
Smithson, reinforced with full sym
phonic accompaniment. Last on the
program is the "Boutique Fan
tasque," with setting by Andre De
rain, music by Rossini, choreogra
phy by Massine.
The Ballet Russe will present five
performances over the week-end,
with Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
the pit.
For its fourth pair of concerts, the
Symphony in San Francisco has pro
grammed this week-end an arrange
ment by Respighi, Richard Strauss's
"Death and Transfiguration" and the
"Jeux de Timbres" by Isadore Freed.
Toscha Seidel, guest artist, will play
the violin with the orchestra for the
Beethoven concerto.
The Singing Boys of Vienna, who
will appear in the Memorial Opera
House next Tuesday night, will pre
sent, besides sacred and secular
works, an operetta based on Johann
Strauss's "Blue Danube."
On Friday, February 5, Serge
Rachmaninoff presents a recital in
the Opera House of the Beethoven E
major sonata, Opus 109, a group of
Chopin, and his own "Etudes-Tab
leaux." At his second concert on
Sunday, February 7, he will play so
natas by Chopin and Scarlatti, short
er works of Mozart, Bach, Lizst, John
Field, and his own.
Latest news is that the Lunts will
appear on the Coast in June in their
"Idiot's Delight," as well as another
production by Andre which will have
its world premiere in San Francisco
and, if successful, be taken East by
the Theater Guild.
And it seems that the Reviewer has
erred in overlooking the Christmas
pageant given in the Chapel last
quarter, sponsored, I believe, by the
Y.W.C.A., directed by Amelia
Baines, participated in by many out
side students. It was a lovely pro
gram; we particularly liked George
Wood as Ilerod.

phy by Massine.
The Ballet Russe will present five
performances over the week-end,
with Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
the pit.
For its fourth pair of concerts, the
Symphony in San Francisco has pro
grammed this week-end an arrange
ment by Respighi, Richard Strauss's
"Death and Transfiguration" and the
"Jeux de Timbres" by Isadore Freed.
Toscha Seidel, guest artist, will play
the violin with the orchestra for the
Beethoven concerto.
The Singing Boys of Vienna, who
will appear in the Memorial Opera
House next Tuesday night, will pre
sent, besides sacred and secular
works, an operetta based on Johann
Strauss's "Blue Danube."
On Friday, February 5, Serge
Rachmaninoff presents a recital in
the Opera House of the Beethoven E
major sonata, Opus 109, a group of
Chopin, and his own "Etudes-Tab
leaux." At his second concert on
Sunday, February 7, he will play so
natas by Chopin and Scarlatti, short
er works of Mozart, Bach, Lizst, John
Field, and his own.
Latest news is that the Lunts will
appear on the Coast in June in their
"Idiot's Delight," as well as another
production by Andre which will have
its world premiere in San Francisco
and, if successful, be taken East by
the Theater Guild.
And it seems that the Reviewer has
erred in overlooking the Christmas
pageant given in the Chapel last
quarter, sponsored, I believe, by the
Y.W.C.A., directed by Amelia
Baines, participated in by many out
side students. It was a lovely pro
gram; we particularly liked George
Wood as Ilerod.
