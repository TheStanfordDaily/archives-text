Jackie Coogan, child star of the
Twenties, is making his first bid for
radio fame when he' takes the air
with his new Log Cabin Dude Ranch
program on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m.
over KGO. Coogan, now 22, has to

start all over again and this time
he tries it as an outlaw, Billy (he
Kid. This should be great for the kids
—plenty of shooting.
TAKING THE HIGH ROAD
Radio station KROW is determined
to become the New York Times of
the dir. It is now celebrating the sec
ond year of its "honest advertising"
policy. No sponsor of patent medi
cines, harmful cosmetics, or hard
liquor can buy time from the Oak
land station. And no pseudo-scien
tific programs can take the air . . .
which means astrologers and numer
ologists are taboo.
It's too bad more independent sta
tions can't afford to lake this stand.
But purity is an expensive luxury, it.
