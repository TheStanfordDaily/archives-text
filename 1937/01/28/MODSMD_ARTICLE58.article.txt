# CAMPUS OPINION
## SOLITUDE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This recent outburst of publicity
for Sequoia has been most volumi
nous since a certain graduate stu
dent drove a tractor up the front
steps of Sequoia, while another grad
uate student was leading a horse up
to the second floor and trying to bed
the poor beast down in stili another
graduate's room.
So it's all decided. The graduates
want to be alone. And us, our $115
a quarter and room rent are thereby
rendered inconsequential. We ap
preciate the interest of the campus
for our well being, but believe we
can still think for ourselves in spite
of the fact that we are a hetero
genous /nass. When everybody gets
through with their petitions and dis
cussions, they might consult us. Of
course, we have no interest in the
matter, but having lived in this
dreadful den of heterogeneity we
might be able to offer suggestions as
to room and janitor alterations.
So the graduates want to be alone.
Well, give them the boat house, or
maybe the Isolation Hospital. And
because of their seriousness of pur
pose you might bar all but graduates
from coming within two hundred
yards of the place. But as for*giving
them Sequoia, well, that's something
else. We like Sequoia, and we like it
as it is, and nothing short of a spe
cial dispensation from God and
President Wilbur will get us to move.
Graduates, you who can take it,
Sequoia welcomes you.
