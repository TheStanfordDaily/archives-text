# MORE ABOUT SEQUOIA

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the previous letter by Art Allen
appearing in Tuesday's Dippy and in
previous articles, the planÂ»has been
put forward to convert Sequoia, after
"remodeling and modernizing," to a
hall for graduate men only. In this
whole discussion apparently no one
has wondered whether the present
residents of Sequoia would approve
of this or not. The obvious infer
ence has been that we of Sequoia
should be glad to give up what we
have here for what a Toyon or Bran
ner man would consider a more
"suitable place" in which to live.
It is the rule of the University that
only undergraduate men can live in
Toyon and Branner. The motive,
then, for this plan appearing within
the walls of Toyon and Branner,
rather than Sequoia, is obvious. Men
from these halls, graduating next
June, wish to carry with them the
somber silences of their present
poms to replace the savage environ
ment supposed to prevail at the pres
ent Sequoia. That the present Se
quoia men prefer things as they are
apparently has not occurred to them.
I am a graduate myself, and enjoy
life here at Sequoia as I find it. In
common with most graduates I do a
large portion of my studying in de
partmental library and assistants'
rooms, yet I find it quite possible to

study in Sequoia, too. Why should
one become a recluse simply because
he is a graduate? Two room-mates
seem to me not a bad idea at all.
Other graduates are welcome to
Sequoia, and invited to join in the
social life here, but why take the
color and life out of Sequoia as it
stands? A person needn't dry up
when he graduates.
Sincerely,
Sequoia Grad
