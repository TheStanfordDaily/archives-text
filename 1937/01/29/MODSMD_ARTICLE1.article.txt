# Thousands Fight Flood Waters Along Mississippi
## Flu Epidemic Scourges Homeless; Ohio River Drops Toward Normal 
### 
MKMPIIIS, Tenn., Jan. 2!) (U.R).â€” j
A pick-and-shovel army of 100,000
men battled tlie Mississippi River I
along a 1,200-mile flood front tonight, !
working 24 hours a day to brace
levees and seawalls wherever the
Father of Waters spread its yellow |
peril.
Influenza and pneumonia today
attacked this cnnip of !),000 flood
refugees in increasing proportions.
There arc at least 500 cases of in
fluenza. An estimate of pneumonia
patients is not available from offi
cials.
Ohio Sinks
From Pittsburgh down the Ohio
and Mississippi Rivers to the delta
flie flood's death toll approached j
300; there were almost 1.000.000 j
persons homeless; and additional '
500,000 were in peril and property |
damage was estimated at $400,000- [
000.
It was announced that the Ohio ]
River had fallen to a stage of 56.5 !
feet from its crest of 57.1 reached ;
yesterday, with every indication that !
it would continue to recede. Back- I
water from sewers was rising in I
some sections, however.
The crest of the flood is expected j
at Cairo early next week and the j
issue of life and death, safety or |
property damage, will be decided j
by whether the five-foot margin on
the seawall is enough to hold back
the Mississippi.
Course Changes
The remote possibility was ad
mitted that, if the swollen river's
current was swift enough, a strip j
of land on the northwest side where j
the Ohio takes a sharp bend mijjht J
never be above water again.
Trucks, boats and planes roared j
out of the flood area, carrying away !
thousands, most of whom had no j
knowledge of where they were go- |
ing or when they would return.
