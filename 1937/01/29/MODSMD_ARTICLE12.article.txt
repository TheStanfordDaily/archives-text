# Campus Speech To Be Debated
## Farm Vernacular Flayed By Debate Manager 
### 
An open forum to determine
whether a Stanford student should
have a distinct standard of speech
or whether he should adapt himself
to each person to whom he speaks
will be held this Wednesday, Febru
ary 3, at 7:30 o'clock in the Little
Theater.
In a discussion entirely new to the
campus, all students and other in
terested persons are invited to at
tend the forum. Anyone may speak
at length on the topic or may ask
questions of the six debaters who will
talk for the first 25 minutes on the
question, "Resolved: That the speech
of a Stanford student is not in keep
ing with that of an educated person.
"Although the two Passion Letters
printed in the Daily were much crit
icized as poor examples of literary
composition, I rather think that the
average Stanford student, including
myself, uses the English language
with no better effect," declared Ed
ward Lindblom, varsity debate man
ager, in opening the fireworks for the
discussion. "Any student criticizing
these letters is a 'pot calling the ket
tle black..' "
