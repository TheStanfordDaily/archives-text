### 
To a senior class mass meeting of
150, President Mort D'Evelyn last
night outlined the purpose of the
Senior Endowment Fund, told
vaguely of vague plans for senior
week now in the process of formu
lation.
Because Stanford has slipped from
first to about fourteenth in size of
endowment since 1918. Stanford As
sociates was formed to publicize the
University among its graduates and
the general public and to induce
Stanford men to give back to the
University some part of what they
gained from it. D'Evelyn stated.
The Senior Endowment Fund,
started last year, is the graduating
class's first contribution to Stanford
Associates and its endowment fund,
from which the University may get
$30,000 to $70,000 annually.
D'Evelyn also outlined the advan
tages of Alumni Association mem
bership, and took applications for
senior committee work from class
members present.
