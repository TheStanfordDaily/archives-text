# Farm Cagers Meet Trojans Tonight For Crucial Game
## Two Victories Will Place Cardinals at Head Of Southern Conference 
### GORDY FROST 
Into the realm of the Trojan
Horse roll Stanford's undefeated
J Redshirts today.
And tonight at 8 o'clock, on the
I floors of Pan-Pacific Auditorium in
j Los Angeles, our genial John Bunn
plus his men in Red roll up against
! their biggest hump of the Conference
! season thus far—Elevator Sam Barry
j and his omnipotent Trojans.
j Then, tomorrow night, with this
| first obstacle behind, Hank and

Dinty, and Stoef, the boys will again
| wheel into El Trojan; a heavy week
; end and a crucial one.
Crucial Series
For on the results of those two
meetings rests in large measure the
i outcome of Southern Division of the
i Pacific Coast Conference.
U.S.C. is undefeated in the confer
ence to date. Stanford stands the
same. Someone will drop from the tie
i lead tonight. That's the situation in
I a paragraph.
Stanford Favored
Some authorities concede Stanford
an easy win over Troy, in fact, over
the conference. Others are waiting
for the "off night." Tonight and to
morrow night, are the tests, for if the
much-discussed "cold night" fails to
I show this week-end, Stanford may
well call itself confcrence tops.
Conscious of all this, but not wor-
I ried, 12 Cardinal hoopmen climbed
onto the Lark at 9:13 o'clock last
night to begin their roll toward Troy.
Turnover Out
Two top-notch ball players were
| conspicuously absent. Howie Turner,
I whose arch is improving as rapidly as
I can be expected, got his answer from
I Dr. Roth yesterday. It was "No."
Sparky Robertson, taken with the flu
Wednesday, was definitely off the
j traveling list.
In their places went Bill Shuette,
j and Dale Huff, and with the excep
' tion of Dick Lyons who replaces Jack
1 Kessle, the team that pounded into
Los Angeles today was the same that
traveled east to defeat L.I.U. in Dfc
-1 cember.
j Thus, barring last minute flu at
tacks, Bunn's Rolling Redmen stand
ready—and, according to Genial John
| —very ready, for the bump ahead.

i outcome of Southern Division of the
i Pacific Coast Conference.
U.S.C. is undefeated in the confer
ence to date. Stanford stands the
same. Someone will drop from the tie
i lead tonight. That's the situation in
I a paragraph.
Stanford Favored
Some authorities concede Stanford
an easy win over Troy, in fact, over
the conference. Others are waiting
for the "off night." Tonight and to
morrow night, are the tests, for if the
much-discussed "cold night" fails to
I show this week-end, Stanford may
well call itself confcrence tops.
Conscious of all this, but not wor-
I ried, 12 Cardinal hoopmen climbed
onto the Lark at 9:13 o'clock last
night to begin their roll toward Troy.
Turnover Out
Two top-notch ball players were
| conspicuously absent. Howie Turner,
I whose arch is improving as rapidly as
I can be expected, got his answer from
I Dr. Roth yesterday. It was "No."
Sparky Robertson, taken with the flu
Wednesday, was definitely off the
j traveling list.
In their places went Bill Shuette,
j and Dale Huff, and with the excep
' tion of Dick Lyons who replaces Jack
1 Kessle, the team that pounded into
Los Angeles today was the same that
traveled east to defeat L.I.U. in Dfc
-1 cember.
j Thus, barring last minute flu at
tacks, Bunn's Rolling Redmen stand
ready—and, according to Genial John
| —very ready, for the bump ahead.
