IT AIN'T RIGHT
It is some time between noon and j
11 p.m. at any fraternity or dormitory ;
which is holding a dance within the j
near future. The nearer the dance,
the more frantic the boys get from
the thought that they may have to
take a blind date as a last desperate
resort, but in this particular case, the
dance is a long time off and this pru- I
dent male is phoning the finest fe- I
male he can think of who is reason
ably well within his own league.
In fact, he may even be calculating'
to break into a faster league, but no
matter how hard he tries at the ma
jors, he is using the same old minor
league batting stance. Lights and
curtain; orchestra.

Our hero picks up the phone, gets
the finest female on the wire. He
greets her with the usual inquiries
into her health, her past habits, etc.
lie is surprised to learn that she is
not sure who he is. He explains and
bursts a few illusions on her part. He
does not drive a new Buick con
vertible: his car is a Durant which
has shown its obvious orphanry for
several years now. But, it runs.
Anyway, he explains just how they
went to a show in P..ly one night
about four weeks ago. Or how he sat
three seats away from her in history
lecture. She perhaps recalls, but she
is not sure, as she used to draw pic
tures on the edge of her notes or
write letters in lecture, since roll was
taken and she could not cut.
He nevertheless decides it is high
time to stage the cavalry charge. He
opens the attack; whatcha doin' two
weeks from Friday. Well, she isn't
doing anything particularly. He sug
gests she come to the dance with him.
It isn't going to be a big one; it
doesn't sound important; the more
she thinks about it, the more it
sounds like a skimpy proposition. She
calls to aid all the female wiles. She
bursts out that she just remembered
she had a date. Yes, she's had it for
a long time. She just couldn't break
it. Won't he call up again some time?
Our friend passes off the snub
magnanimously and drops the phone
with a few last pleasantries. Since
he is no longer talking with her, he
lets the forced smile of pseudo-confi
dence ooze off his face and sulks. He
goes back to where best pal is waiting
to hear results of skirmish. By this
time, the sting of the snub is cooling
off and he thinks again of how fine it
would be to know a swell babe like
that. Wouldn't it be swell to be go
ing steady with her? Just ring her
up and get a date easy any time.
His mind starts considering this
elysian prospect. Gosh, what a cute
girl she is! No, not pretty, hut there's
just something about her. Her smile!
How nice she is to everybody, She
smiles the same way at everybody!
Must be hard to get a date with her.
I'll bet some big shot's got her sewed
up. Heard some guy talking about
her just this morning. Next time I'll
