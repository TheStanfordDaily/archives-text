# Extinct Rough Faked for S.F. Chronicle Story
## 
### 
The Stanford Rough is extinct.
Two San Francisco Chronicle report
ers looking for the burly bearded
brutes couldn't even find a pair of
dirty cords on the campus. But the
Chronicle must go on; so the two
reporters created a Stanford Rough.
Cornering Hal Munton in the Al-
pha O house, the newsmen corked a
coarse stubble of beard on his face,
sat him in a chair surrounded by
four house girls with love-lorn ex
pressions, and ordered him to "Look
bored, please." So Hal assumed that
nonchalant, "I'm-superior-to-you"'
glare of the extinct Rough, and the
flashlight powder flashed.
After the picture, the girls stopped
looking lovelorn, Hal stopped look
ing bored, and the reporters stopped
to admire their work of art before
the coarse stubble of beard wr.a wip
ed carefully away.
This morning avid Chronicle sub-
scribers will read of the vanishing
Rough and admire the bristly bruis-
er, while Hal and his smoothy broth-
ers go on striving to get shaved in
one piece before the Sequoia mirrors.
