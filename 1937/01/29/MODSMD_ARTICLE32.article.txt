OUT (')K HIBERNATION

Tas bad news Saturday night,
when j Howie Turner and Phil Zonne
weren't j M S uit for the St. Mary's
gam«j£ because of physical woes, and
it wi> JS likewise lousy tidings when
Sparry Robertson was caught by the
flu TL, es( j a y night, because injuries
and S|j c ]tness are bad stuff to any
athletic team.
But Cjoach Bunn has been pi*etty
lucky so* f ur this year, since this will
be the first week-end that his team
will be at full strength for a
crucial! Up to Friday's game
with Cp a l the teani had been intact,
with exception of H. B. Lee's
bump <~n t he noggin and cracked rib
Suffered! i„ the first U.C.L.A. tilt.
That c(ji t i n '( slow down Boebs very
much, though f or he was out at
practiceythe next Monday and was in
good en OU gh shape to turn in a rat
tling g<>< ,d a t Berkeley. The
whole out (Jt caught Cal when condi
tions right, which kinda made
up lor that thing last year.
So Geniad John and his boys go
into theseggames( a mes tonight and tomor

on anther one tonight, the rugged |
B°b Pastor, former N.Y.U. collegian
who vC-ants to make a roll fighting
and thy n g Q j n t 0 newspaper business.
Ihe lad has a $500,000 pro

worryin/g n bout right now is that
none olf his opponents have any
thing h«,pp Cn ( 0 them until he fights

This 4<i c i Pastor has if all figured
out that because Schmeling beat j
Louis wi,h a r jght he can do the same
thing.M ;i yy e that's so, but he's going
to have" take quite a few, both
right ar lc j left, before he ever gets a •
chance to use that right. If he can
get by with it he's a better man
than 1 he is.

Schmeling hit Louis with a right in
the second round because the negro
had been floating along without try
ing to get too rough right away, and
left himself open for a moment. The
German, hardly a boob, took advan
tage of the chance and Louis never
got over it. If they ever fight again
Schmeling will have to find a dif
ferent punch, and he hasn't got one.

to have" take quite a few, both
right ar lc j left, before he ever gets a •
chance to use that right. If he can
get by with it he's a better man
than 1 he is.

Schmeling hit Louis with a right in
the second round because the negro
had been floating along without try

left himself open for a moment. The
German, hardly a boob, took advan

Schmeling will have to find a dif

Joe j Louis, the Sepia Slayer, takes
on anther one tonight, the rugged |
B°b Pastor, former N.Y.U. collegian
who vC-ants to make a roll fighting
and thy n g Q j n t 0 newspaper business.
Ihe lad has a $500,000 pro
gram of- fights lined up for the next
four and the only thing he is
worryin/g n bout right now is that
none olf his opponents have any
thing h«,pp Cn ( 0 them until he fights
them, [t would spoil the gate, he!
says, lout's a laugh, in a way, be
cause l^ e admits he doesn't give a
whoop w hat happens to them after
lie fight s them once.
This 4<i c i Pastor has if all figured
out that because Schmeling beat j
Louis wi,h a r jght he can do the same
thing.M ;i yy e that's so, but he's going
to have" take quite a few, both
right ar lc j left, before he ever gets a •
chance to use that right. If he can
get by with it he's a better man
than 1 he is.

Schmeling hit Louis with a right in
the second round because the negro
had been floating along without try
ing to get too rough right away, and
left himself open for a moment. The
German, hardly a boob, took advan
tage of the chance and Louis never
got over it. If they ever fight again
Schmeling will have to find a dif
ferent punch, and he hasn't got one.

lucky so* f ur this year, since this will
be the first week-end that his team
will be at full strength for a
crucial! Up to Friday's game
