# Send Men to Eastern Meet, Asks Templeton
## Suggests Shift of Coast Meet to Avoid Conflict 
### 
The Pacific Coast Conference-I.C.
4-A. track tangle that came to a head
two years ago when Stanford sent a
team East for the last time, resolving
to stay on the Coast and play hop
scotch with Coast schools, reared up
again at the B.A.C. meeting Wednes
day night when Coach Dink Temple
ton requested that Stanford send a
man or two East.
Suggests Date Shift
Dates of both the Coast meet and
the eastern classic,have been set for
the fifth Saturday in May, but Tem
pleton suggested that the Coast meet
be brought forward one week so that
the Farm could send to the 1.C.4-A.
those men that seemed to have at
least a reasonable chance to take first
places.
Objections to postponing the Coast
meet until a week later lie mainly
in the final examinations deadline,
which has as yet to be disregarded in
athletic arguments.
Previous Agrement
As it stands so far this season,
Stanford doesn't appear to have a
track team that could win the I.C.
4-A., although the question of having!
one or two first-place winners is a
different matter. Southern Cal,
which agreed with Stanford, Califor
nia, and the remainder of the uni
versities in the P.C.C. to forego the
eastern meet so that the Pacific-
Slope meet might be established to
match that annual affair, would be
in an embarrassing position also if
Stanford turned about and sent rep
resentatives East, since it would like
to do likewise.
Alfred Masters, graduate manager,
also finds himself in a ticklish spot,
because Stanford made the agree-'
ment with other Coast schools and
would be backing out on a bargain
by sending a team. The same ques
tion arose last year, when Templeton
wanted to send men, but the affair
finally wound up with Stanford stay
ing here to compete in the P.C.C.
