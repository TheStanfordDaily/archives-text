# University Avenue Gets Subway Plan
## 
### 
Engineers have hit upon a plan for
eliminating the crossing of Univer
sity Avenue and Southern Pacific
rails without moving the latter or
destroying adjacent property.
The scheme involves an underpass
for vehicles only with the consequent
widening of Alma Street and nar
rowing of sidewalks. The underpass
would approach on a 7 per cent
grade, allowing for a track clear
ance of 12' 2 feet, a figure engineers
believe would be acceptable to state
officials as University is not a heavy
trucking artery.
