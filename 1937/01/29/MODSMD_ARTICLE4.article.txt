WHILE THESE MONKS won't be going to the Roosevelt Birthday
Ball tomorrow night, they may be just as important as F.D.R. to the
I prevention and cure of infantile paralysis.

pathology, is conducting research on filterable viruses, germ-family of

infantile paralysis, in an attempt to determine how the disease is con- !
traded.
At right is the ice box, apparently just like mother's, except that it
contains botties, each of which holds enough germs to kill Iftft.OOft men.
