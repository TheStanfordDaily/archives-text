# Swim Medal Won by Read
## Frosh Star Places First In Swimming Trials 
### 
Jack Read, top notch backstroker
and free-style handy man from Low
ell High, won the Nort Thornton gold
medal for placing first in the all
around swimming trials for frosh
which ended last week.
Read, scoring wins in the 50, 100,
and 440-yard free-style events, and
the 100-yard back-stroke, piled up
19 points to lead Bob Plate and Bill
Bleecker who tied for second position
with 17. A fiip of the coin gave Plate
the silver medal, the bronze one go
ing to Bleecker. Frank Dowling,
with a win in the 100-yard breast
stroke, came next with 8, and Bob â– 
Livingston wound up the scoring
with 4.
Read's time of 1:10 in the 100-yard
back-stroke event was the high
light of the meet. His :27 flat win in
the 50-yard dash may mean that the
San Francisco flash will combine the |
50 free-style with his back-stroke
duties this season.
The former Lowell paddler showed
he is no slouch at distance swim
ming when he swam away with the
440-yard free-style in the fast fresh
man early season time of 5:47.
The only two events not taken by I
Read were the 10-yard breast-stroke. (
won by Dowling in the slow time of I
1:24, and the 220-yard free-style,
won by Bleecker in the fairly fast
time of 2:36.
