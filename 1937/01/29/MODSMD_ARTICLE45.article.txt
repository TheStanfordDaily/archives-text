Dear Eis:
When Daily Editor Beaubaire wrote his fare
well edit, he prefixed it with a quotation from
Proverbs. It was something about wisdom. I
take my message from a three-line filler that
appeared last fall on The Daily sports page,
which is more generic, somewhat more sym
>olic, more vital, breathing, and alive, don't
ou think?
When Daily Editor Friendlich wrote his fare
«ll he said that "The Daily editor can never be
•>re than half right and that only on rare
asions."
vVhen Daily Editor Mellinkoff wrote his, he
irned: "Resist the onslaught of cranks who
/ill pack your office with all sorts of plans,
campaigns, gripes, and general uplift schemes."
So I guess the subject of the farewell edit to
the incoming editor is either exhausted, or else
all Daily editors make a practice of rewriting
their predecessors' columns. No matter the
stylistic variations, they have all come back to
the same themes: they are sorry to go, The
Daily editor leads a life no super-human or
sub-human could endure, they are sorry to go,
Pan-Hellenic is lousy, something should be done
about the Honor Code, they are sorry to go,
there are ants in Encina, and they are sorry to
go. And, no matter how much they had lam
basted the powers, they invariably have ended
with a certain plaintive note from the French
Horn sequence, which rather contritely says
(Mellinkoff): "You will learn that Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur is a really swell person. You will wish
that you knew him well enough to call him
"Doc"; or maybe even "Ray"—but you never
will.
Beaubaire, however, reached a depth of dis
integration to which no other editor has ever
sunk when he admitted that a student manager
was human. He said: "Ben Cave is a clean,
straightforward, well-meaning fellow and hon
estly believes he is doing what is right even
when The Daily (out, out, damn spot) and others
would legitimately disagree with him."
If for no other reason than that I am tired of
seeing these written and rewritten edits, I will
not occupy myself with these last-minute pleas
for salvation. I've always admired Dr. Wilbur,
and just as I admire anything that is excellent
in its function. I've always admired Comptroller
Roth, for being an exceptionally capable and
unusually understanding man of finance. But
I've thought that all along. My rantings and
railings if any have always been against social
forces, cutlure patterns, and emotional sets, not
against personalities. Personalities are always
confusing, because there are always excellent
and sincere people on both sides (or did Beau
baire say that).
The fact that I seem to be definitely on the
wrong side from the authoritarian and traditional
point of view has caused a bit of consternation
amongst a few of the older heads around here.
This has alarmed me quite a bit, because I was
under the impression that nobody read my edi
torials. My intemperance of statement and my
former public confessionals all sprang from the
feeling that what I had to say in the columns
was rather sacred and secret, just between me
and the typewriter. Because people do not read
long edits.
However, in certain circles there have been
lifted eyebrows. One prof thinks I had some
sort of a personality maladjustment, that it v/as
a fixation which caused me to print things on
lettuce strikes and such stuff just because my
family wouldn't like it. I don't think he was
referring to the kind of chaos within that
Nietzsche recommended for the production of
"dancing stars," but I am quite sure that he is
firm in the belief that the world moves forward
by the efforts of the well-adjusted people.
Then there was another professor who
thought I was being disloyal to the University
when I printed certain interesting facts on
football. This reminded me of George Jean
Nathan's epigram: "Patriotism is often an arbi
trary veneration of real estate above principles."
To this, of course, the professor would undoubt
edly rejoin that I had no principles. That just
goes to show that people do not read long edits.
There was another faculty mind who thought
I was too flippant. My only answer to him
was that old favorite of rationalizing flippancy
flippers: "If you can tell me anything I can be
serious about without blowing out my brains,
I'll be serious." He never told me, but I noticed
quite privately ever after that, that every time
I got serious I had a tendency to blow out my
brains in the edit columns, with a resultant de
struction of unity, coherence, and emphasis, and
also a certain blowing out of the edit columns.
The last indictment subscribed and sworn to

before me was that I didn't think things through.
I don't think that is n surprising, considering
my rather youthful desire to put out an interest
ing newspaper. What has surprised me, though,
is that the paper wasn't more interesting, con
sidering all my sins, also that I wasn't the only
one who hadn't thought things through.
In my interest to put out a newspaper, maybe
I didn't "have anything constructive to offer,"
but how about these quite laudable administra
tors who have been sitting around here all these
years? My thinking-through has stopped at the
newspaperman's point of view. Their thinking
through has stopped at the point where tradi
tion says it should stop. As long as their jobs
have been adequately done (and they have
oftentimes been more than adequately done)
they are satisfied. However, there is a gap
there. Between the various gaps some thinking
has to be done. Departmentalization has found
everybody doing his job as well as any requi
sition could expect; but nobody seems to be
thinking about what is the matter with the whole
picture. All the units are functioning wonder
fully well, but nobody's getting educated (or
have f mentioned that before?).
But that's neither here nor there. What I
really wanted to write this edit about was that
deciduous shrubs may be transplanted safely
when the foliage changes color.
I had intended writing something on the
order of "Eisenbach meet the campus, campus
meet Eisenbach." But I guess, now, you'll have
to arrange your own introduction.
I'd never expected to write one of these
"profit by my experience" editorials which
seem to have been quite the rage in the old
days. Because all quarter long, I've been profit
ing by your experience. I don't think anybody
on the staff will quibble when I say you are
the best newspaperman that has ever hit The
Daily. Who am I to tell you what to do? So true
to my type, I have gasped my last gasp in
talking about myself, which is a never-ending
subject of fascination for most people afflicted
with fixations, flippancy, destructive tendencies,
disloyalty, and the inability to think things
through.
And as I see you around mobilizing your
faculties and your staff for the coming adven
ture, I realize more than ever that the past vol
ume was the aspirin interlude in Daily history.
Deadening pain, we wrote out our philosophy of
inaction, but Monday I expect to see the sunrise
of the Eisenbach reaction, that peculiar efferves
cence and ferment, those pastel shades and
purple prose. The Daily will again be a news
paper. Yers,
Jorg
