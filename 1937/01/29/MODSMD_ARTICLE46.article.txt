### 
THE RED PATCH OF COURAGE
We leave it to Roger Babson to count how many
times we've bruised our fingers on galloping Under
woods, for they've been too many for us. But by order
of the court, both the fingers and the Underwoods will
go on.
That being the case, we will bow our heads to the
memory of the legendary Steve O'Donnell, who sired
♦ his ihetorical bull, and to the MellinkofTs, who suc
ceeded in penning it within a daily Session.
$ * * *
As the least last of that line of distinguished torea
dors, I place the red patch on my pants beside their's
—memento of tilts with academic windmills — more
poignant memento of tilts with the Bull, who snorts his
way all too often through our reasoning, and whose
horns are sharp.
Before my red patch goes that of John McClelland,
who .shared bull-tending during the NRA regime of
Bob Jones, who favored spreading employment and
who personally avoided the red patch,
<1 * * 41
Monday, the harried male bovine charges a new
writer. Ho is Curtis Prendergast, Sour Griper and
one of the notably less-happy Chappies. Curtis will be
toreador for one week, then the Bull will charge others.
His full-time victim will be selected from those who
survive.

Sew on the red patch, Curtis.
