Our Hasher, Sir:
We've been having such a hard time getting this
notice into print. Could you PLEASE do it for us
quick like?
Love,
Les Petites Frangaises
' Since the room that has been attracting the atten
tion of various D U. s, including the charming gentle
man with the scrumptious blue pajamas, belongs to
none other than Manzanita's house mother, it might be
pointed out that there is a definite uselessness in their
continuing their regular nightly benefit. Why do you
think they put the girls in the front of the house?"
Take that.
People have been approaching me in a quite polite
fashion, asking if I would continue writing Our Hasher
during the rest of the year. Sorry to disappoint them,
and with half a suspicion that they wanted to write it
themselves, I must now publicly admit that Our Hasher
continues under the same management which it has
continued under since it started continuing.
I wouldn't bare my soul this way, if it weren't for
the fact that 1 want my H-men in the Econ department
to keep on sneaking out every night and meet me at
our rendezvous in the shadow of the outfall sewer.
