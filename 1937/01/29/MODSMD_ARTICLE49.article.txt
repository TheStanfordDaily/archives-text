STRONG WEEK-END
TONIGHT—
Tune in KFRC at 8:30 this evening
and you can listen to the Beverly
Hills premiere of ''The Good Earth"
. . . Another good bet is the Holly
wood Hotel program on KSFO at G
p.m. Errol Flynn and Anita Louise
are the guest stars.
TOMORROW—
On KGO at 10:40 a.m., the Metro
politan Opera Company presents
"Siegfried" with Lauritz Melchior
and Kirsten Flagstad singing the
leads . . . Who could ask for more?
Lupe Velez and Johnny Weismul
ler are scheduled to sing on Floyd
Gibbon's Speedshow over KSFO at
6 p.m. but don't expect too much . . .
For less fire, more charm, and a real
voice, try Ed Wynn's program at 9:00
p.m. on KGO. Kitty Carlyle will
make her second appearance in the
Perfect Fool's show.
SUNDAY—
Lucrezia Bori will sing opera ex
cerpts with the Ford Symphony Or

chcstra at G p.m. over KSFO while
the competing General Motors pro
gram at 7 p.m. over KPO will offer
Kirsten Flagstad and the Rochester
Symphony Orchestra under Jose
Iturbi's baton.
