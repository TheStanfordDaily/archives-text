# Italian Picture Rivals American Fine Technique
## 
### 
Curious mixture of cinema new, |
and cinema old is I-orenzino de Med
ici, Italian film at the Varsity Tues- |
day and Wednesday. Not content
with technical excellence which in
several places came close to Holly
wood's best, the producers intro
duced five or six pieces of downright
theatricality which have no placc in a
modern film.
To begin with, the plot itself might
I well have been taken from a bad
i play about the Renaissance rather
, than from the period itself. Wicked
! Duke Covets Beauty, Imprisons Her
I Father. Machiavellian Hero Rescues
; Dad, Kills Duke, Gets Girl.
The puzzling thing is, he didn't get
anything else. After wasting his and
the spectator's time while he suavely
I enmeshed the villain in his web, he
I ended up in a gondola in Venice, in
exile, with only his lady-love for
comfort.
Now maybe, love is enough. But
if so, why such a stew about the
crimes of the Duke; why the pose as
liberator of Florence? What good did
it do him? Is he going to return to
Florence a conquering hero; or is he
going to end up struggling to pay the
rent on a two-room apartment full of
ten or twelve bambini?
If the first, the producers have
missed an opportunity to make the
thing dramatically cohesive; if the
second, II Duce has missed a magnifi
j cent opportunity to put over the idea
' that, as Alexander Woolcott says,
breeding is a lot of fun. As it was,
, we left disappointed. So much smoke,
we felt, and so little fire.
