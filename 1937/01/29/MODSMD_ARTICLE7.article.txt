# Medicos Perfect Polio Preventive on Monks

Chemical treatment of the olfact
ory nerves of the upper nose dur
ing epidemics may protect future
generations from the minute virus
which causes poliomyelitis (infantile
paralysis), if results of experiments
on monkeys obtained by Stanford
Professors E. W. Schultz and L. P.
Gebhardt and their assistants can
be made applicable to man.
Virus Hits Nerves
From the President's Birthday Ball
Commission for Infantile Paralysis
Research Dr. Schultz and his assist
ants receive a fund of $18,000 an
nually to carry on experiments upon
several hundred monkeys in the
cramped quarters of the bacteriology
building located behind the Univer
sity Museum.
During eight years' study of the
disease in animals, of which monkeys
have proved the most satisfactory,
Dr. Schultz has explored in turn the
| effectiveness of serum injection and
I vaccination as preventatives of the
disease. Because the polio virus en
| ters the nervous system through the
i olfactory nerve and does its damage
| as it passes into the central nervous
i system which controls the muscles of
j the body, neither of these two meth-
I ods of combatting disease germs, both
I of which act within the blood stream,
! proved satisfactory.
Picric Acid Used
When in 1934 Dr. Schultz and Dr.
I Gebhardt with several others estab-
I lished the fact that the virus enters
J the body only through the nerve
endings in the nose, 'hey undertook
to find some treatment which would
block this portal of entry.
Simultaneously Dr. Schultz and his
! a? -ociates at Stanford and Dr.
j Charles Armstrong and W. T Har
i rison at the National Institute of
, Health in Washington. D.C., in 193(5
j reported the protection afforded by

chemical agents such as picric acid,
alum, tannic acid, and zinc sulphate.
Monkeys Respond
In tests conducted at Stanford it
was found that 95 per cent of a group
of 53 monkeys resisted the virus in
oculated intranasally as long as a
month after the treatment of their
nasal mucosa with a zinc sulphate
solution. At tlie same time 95 per
j cent of the same number of monkeys
which were not given the treatment
succumbed to the disease after in
oculation in a similar manner. In
j some instances the treatment acted as
an effective barrier for as long as six
months.
Present experiments are directed
toward the discovery of how these
chemicals act upon the olfactory
nerves to prevent the entry of the
virus, and whether there are other
chemical compounds which will have
a similar effect. Apparently the treat
ment had no detrimental effect upon
the sense of smell in tlie monkeys,
but it has not been determined
whether the human scent would be
impaired.
Dr. Schultz is reluctant to make
any claims for the chemoprophylaxis
of poliomyelitis in man. though dur
ing a recent epidemic of the disease
in the South, spraying of the nose
with alum, though improperly done
in most eases, acted as a partial pre
ventative of the disease. Of the
chemicals which have been studied
so far, a 1 per cent solution of picric
acid in physiological saline solution is
the most suitable for man. because it
is essentially harmless, and compara
tively non-irritating, according to
Dr. Schultz.

oculation in a similar manner. In
j some instances the treatment acted as
an effective barrier for as long as six
months.
Present experiments are directed
toward the discovery of how these
chemicals act upon the olfactory
nerves to prevent the entry of the
virus, and whether there are other
chemical compounds which will have
a similar effect. Apparently the treat
ment had no detrimental effect upon
the sense of smell in tlie monkeys,
but it has not been determined
whether the human scent would be
impaired.
Dr. Schultz is reluctant to make
any claims for the chemoprophylaxis
of poliomyelitis in man. though dur
ing a recent epidemic of the disease
in the South, spraying of the nose
with alum, though improperly done
in most eases, acted as a partial pre
ventative of the disease. Of the
chemicals which have been studied
so far, a 1 per cent solution of picric
acid in physiological saline solution is
the most suitable for man. because it
is essentially harmless, and compara
tively non-irritating, according to
Dr. Schultz.
Chemical treatment of the olfact
ory nerves of the upper nose dur
ing epidemics may protect future
generations from the minute virus
which causes poliomyelitis (infantile
paralysis), if results of experiments
on monkeys obtained by Stanford
Professors E. W. Schultz and L. P.
Gebhardt and their assistants can
be made applicable to man.
Virus Hits Nerves
From the President's Birthday Ball
Commission for Infantile Paralysis
Research Dr. Schultz and his assist
ants receive a fund of $18,000 an
nually to carry on experiments upon
several hundred monkeys in the
cramped quarters of the bacteriology
building located behind the Univer
sity Museum.
During eight years' study of the
disease in animals, of which monkeys
have proved the most satisfactory,
Dr. Schultz has explored in turn the
| effectiveness of serum injection and
I vaccination as preventatives of the
disease. Because the polio virus en
| ters the nervous system through the
i olfactory nerve and does its damage
| as it passes into the central nervous
i system which controls the muscles of
j the body, neither of these two meth-
I ods of combatting disease germs, both
I of which act within the blood stream,
! proved satisfactory.
Picric Acid Used
When in 1934 Dr. Schultz and Dr.
I Gebhardt with several others estab-
I lished the fact that the virus enters
J the body only through the nerve
endings in the nose, 'hey undertook
to find some treatment which would
block this portal of entry.

j reported the protection afforded by

chemical agents such as picric acid,
alum, tannic acid, and zinc sulphate.
Monkeys Respond
In tests conducted at Stanford it
was found that 95 per cent of a group
of 53 monkeys resisted the virus in
oculated intranasally as long as a
month after the treatment of their
nasal mucosa with a zinc sulphate
solution. At tlie same time 95 per
j cent of the same number of monkeys
which were not given the treatment
succumbed to the disease after in
oculation in a similar manner. In
