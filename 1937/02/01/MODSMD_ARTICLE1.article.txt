that the military stage
managers forgot to use blank
cartridges, the Spanish Civil War is a
comic opera. But as a show, it is too
good. Many of us sitting in plush or
chestra chairs have forgotten we are
merely spectators, have used a play
goer's prerogative of identifying our
selves with the characters.
And with the world being under
mined with the bombs of social con
sciousness, it seems about time some
ace publicist like Will Irwin, George
Creel, or Edward Bcrnays brought
down the final curtain. They could as
caoi y tuin bullets into words in
Spain, 1936, as they turned words
into bullets in America, 1917.
We suggest they have a rumor run
through Spain that Christ has been
i eborn in the Pyrenees.
Professing Communists and zeal
ous fascists would unite without a
single death, and Paris, Rome, Ber-
J lin, Moscow, and Washington could
sigh an official relief.
It s possible. Hard-boiled Amer
ica bought Liberty Bonds for a
phrase. What wouldn't Spain do for
the Messiah.
Which brings us down to an
othei hard lact about politics and
politicians: that the flood is a god
send to Roosevelt. Now he can open
the doors of the AAA grainarics and
let needed food and supplies circu
late to the flood country. It. is re
markable how God watches over the
smooth talker.
Any other luckless guy with the
right set of political virtues and so
cial sins would have had to approach
the AAA-surplus problem more di
rectly. He could have cut appro
priations for river levee construc
tion a year ago, to swing a disaster
into a national benefit.
Outspoken rooters for Stanford's
baskctcers have their own explana
tion for Friday's defeat. They say,
"eherchez lcs femmes."
For it was women, collectively, that
is said Lo have sapped the strength
of the hoopers. The ladies, fresh,
pink-cheeked and shining - eyed,
went South with the boys to drool
over Luisetti and Moore.
They really should regret those
artful glances and those bewildering
smiles from the bleachers. The boys
do.
Speaking of artfulness. We under
stand that Phillip Morris (plural
Mori) are down from 16 to an even
15 cents at. the Cellar, with market
steady. It seems the manufacturers
cut their price.
But the Union still has a monopoly.
And, wonder of wonders, it. admits
it.
Time was when the Union was a bit
more cagey. Now they'll up prices
and drop them, admitting they have
us where they want us.
When it comes to charity, they'll
probably subscribe to flood relief.
