# Strike Over! For Kissers
## 
### 
There is only one way to
bring striking co-eds back into
the fold, University of Utah men
discovered last week when their
dates "walked nut" nn tjÂ«eing.
The men "walked out" on dat
ing.

The feminine "anti-oscula
tion" movement began when
one scientific co-ed pressed her
lips to a glass slide in a lab
class. She took one look at the
impression under the micro
scope and revolted. Millions of
villainous little bacteria were
multiplying in the particles of
lip rouge.

Girls all over the Salt Lake
campus took action and declar
ed a "kissing strike." "Scabs"
who refused to join the drive
found their par-exchange value
soaring with campus men. But
it couldn't last. There weren't
enough "scabs" to go around.

Organizing an Osculation
League, the men's first step was
a ban on dates. This was
enough. Within 48 hours the
women were brought ot terms,
forced to "kiss and make up."
