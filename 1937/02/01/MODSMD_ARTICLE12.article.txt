# 45,000,000 Gallons Just a Sip for Lagunita; Record Level Expected
## No Swimming; Mercury Floats at 35 Degrees 
### 
Although there are now only about
45 million gallons of water in the
30.5 acres of Lake Lagunita, statistics
show that it will be an ofT year if the
lake doesn't fill to 118 million gallons.
Slow seepage, gopher holes, and
evaporation are accounting for the
loss of a million gallons a day, or
approximately 900 gallons a minute.
But more than this, heavy rains and
swollen mountain streams will
bring in enough water to fill the lake
before many more weeks.
An estimated depth of 15 to 20 feet
at the deepest point coincides with an
altitude of 35 feet above sea-level,
according to the student residents at
the boat house.
From the same source, it was
learned that the boaters would be
able to use the lake after one or more
rains such as the campus has expe
rienced in the last week. On the
other hand, the water, at 35 degrees
Fahrenheit as a result of the recent
freezing weather, will be too cold for
bathers for some time to come.
Last year, the lake was opened for
all aquatic sports on Saturday, Feb
ruary 15, at which time the living
groups brought their boats and
canoes down to store them in the
boat house.
Meanwhile, the various foliaceous
lemna and different genera of rana
temporaria are awaiting the return
of Stanford's aquatic-ally minded men
and Women to her water-washed
banks


WATERSPORTS will soon he under way as Lagunita slowly fills.
With I feet to go lo set a new high, the lake's temperature is now
degrees.
