INGLKSIDE GOLF COURSE, SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 31 (UP).â€”Law
son Little, stocky dark-haired golfer who learned the game in a Chinese
cemetery, proved himself the world's best match player anew today by win
ning the $5000 San Francisco national match play open golf championship.

Little defeated Neil Christian of"
Yakima, Wash., in the final match of
the seventh annual tournament here.
The match went 20 holes before Little
scored his triumph.

dark horse from Yakima and at the
end of nine holes the former amateur
champion was three up. By the end
of the 15th hole Little was four up
and he looked like an easy winner.
Loses Putting Touch
Then he lost his putting touch.
Four times Little had to take
putts to get in, and Christian, playing
carefully, took each hole by one
stroke, sending the match into extra
holes.
They halved the 19th hole and
when Little took the 20th, the second
longest hole on the course, the match
ended.
It was Little's first opportunity at
match play since deciding to make
money from his golf abiilty and he
cashed in on it to the tune of $5,000,
the first prire of the San Francisco

Playing sound steady golf, taking
few chances, but concentrating on
keeping at least one hole ahead of
his rival, Little eliminated such
great players as Orvillc White of Chi
cago, Jimmy Hines of Long Island
and Horton Smith of Chicago to get
into the finals. Christian, a dark
horse in the toumey, climbed into
the last round over Paul Runyan,
Leonard Dodson, and Henry Piccard

The survivors put on a match that
will not be easily forgotten.
