The flood of criticism that has been
aimed at the government's Mata
nuska Valley colony, appeared head
ed toward an official investigation
last night as the grumblings of dis
satisfied residents gathered force.

Extraordinary weather has been
prevailing at sea also, according to
United Press reports which state
that several ships are foundering be
cause of high seas in the Atlantic.

The Supreme Court last night was
expected to split over New Deal
acts, now that liberal Justice Har
lan F. Stone, center of a controversy
which may remake its historic pow
ers, has returned for duty after a
prolonged illness. No major cases
which would split the court into
closely divided factions have been
decided while Stone was away.
