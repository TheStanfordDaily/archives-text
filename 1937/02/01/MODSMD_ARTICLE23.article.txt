# Staff Tryouts For Daily Will Begin Tuesday
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 5 o'clock a
couple of dozen freshmen and a few
others are going around to the jour
nalism libe on the second floor of
publications building to see what all
this is about joining the Daily staff.
After having signed a sheet of pa
per, they will be addressed by re
cruiting agent Barbara Sweet, new
women's editor. She will repeat es
sentially what the neophytes have
heard from their friends: The Daily
is a fine activity. You get to know
lots of swell people. You get to
know what's going on. The end
quarter binges are lun.
Their enthusiasm and curiosity
piqued, tryoutees will be handed
several mimeographed pages termed
a "style sheet" and told to learn the
information on this gloried English A
syllabus.
The next day, and for two weeks
thereafter, hardy souls who have not
given up and decided to join the glee
club instead, will haunt the Daily
shack, typing heads and taking down
announcements over the phone.
Their standing during this pre
liminary fortnight is that of tryoutee.
The edit board takes it out on the
night editors; night editors lay it on
department heads; department heads
blame copy readers, who in turn
bawl out the reporters. The report
ers make up for it all on the tryout
ees.
Once dubbed reporters, the tyro
journalists are expected to spend one
hour—6o minutes —per week at the
Daily office typing heads, reading
proofs, and cutting fillers out of the
Columbia Spectator. One evening
weekly, they report to the United
Press desk to type headlines on flood
stories, strike stories, and Spanish
war dispatches.
So accustomed will they become to
the yell of the night editor whenever
the telephone rings that even class
bells will send through their heads
the phrase, "Reporter in the booth!"
