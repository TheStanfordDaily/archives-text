# Debate Scheduled For Wednesday
## 
### 
Six Stanford debaters will make
their campus debut this Wednesday
in the new Open Forum to be held
in the Little Theater at 8:30 p.m.
Frances Ford, Grant Stone, and
Howard Hays will speak against the
negative team of Gene Glassman,
Jackson King, and William Lambert.
Each will present in a brief four
minute talk a complete survey of
their extensive and original research
on the discussion, "Resolved: that
the speech of a Stanford student is
not in keeping with that of an edu
cated person."
At the conclusion of their talks, the
speakers will be subject to refutation
from anyone in the audience and will
answer questions directed to them.
According to the debate manager,
this forum is an attempt to "take the
starch out of debating, bring the au
dience into the discussions, and, in
fact, to let the audience make of the
debate what it will. We hope that it
will be a free-for-all," he said.
