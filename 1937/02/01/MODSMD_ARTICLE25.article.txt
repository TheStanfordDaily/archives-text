# Farm Poli Sci Professor Recalls College Days of Talbot Jennings
## Philip Buck Describes 'Fellow Playwright' 
### GENE GLASMANN 
Talbot Jennings to most campusites
is just another playwright. But to j
Philip G. Buck, associate professor of
political science, the author of "This
Side Idolatry," winter quarter play,
is old friend and college pal.
"Talbot Jennings?" Dr. Buck asked
when approached Friday afternoon,
surprise in his delighted smile. "Why,
I went to school with him." He took
several drags from an old pipe, lean
ed back in his chair, and began.
Together at Idaho
''We were fellow 'playwrights' at
the University of Idaho about 14
years ago. Talbot was older than I,
having seen service in France before
returning to Idaho to finish his edu
cation. I got to know him well in a I
play production class in which we
both wrote. I remember in 1922 we
were both enthusiastic because ours
were the two plays chosen in the
competition that year. But both of j
us had trouble producing our works
and decided right then that an au
thor should never try to produce his
own plays."
After the war Jennings had been
engineer for the Idaho highway de
partment. But playwrighting was for
him, not engineering, so he returned
to Idaho, where Professor Buck met
him.
Interests
Jennings' two main interests then,
as now, were Elizabethan England
and Shakespeare, and the American
pioneer frontier. "This Side Idolatry,"
a sketch of Will Shakespeare, the
unhaloed man, is of the first. "No
More Frontiers" and "American
Wing" resulted from his interest in
the early West.
"In 1923," continued the professor,
"some of Talbot's English instructors
succeeded in getting him a fellow
ship at Harvard, where G. B. Baker
had become famous through his
Workshop 47. But—call it the irony

of fate —the year Talbot got to
Harvard, Professor Baker moved his
dramatic school to Yale. So after
two semesters, Talbot returned to
Idaho as an instructor."
Went to New York
Coming to the conclusion that he
would never write plays as long as he
was teaching. Jennings soon left
Idaho, The only place for a writer,
he thought, was New York City.
"I rather lost track of him after he
left this last time," declared Dr.
Buck. "No one heard much about
him for 10 years. He had no money
so he must have suffered terrible
hardships, doing hackwriting and
collaboration to make a living. I re
member that in those years I would
see items in the theatrical magazines
about plays a certain Talbot Jen

nings was planning to produce. But j
something would always happen."
Luck Changes
Finally Jennings' "No More Fron
tiers" was staged in the Provinetown i
Theater in New York. The author's!
luck had changed. Leslie Howard I
became interested in "This Side
Idolatry" and produced it in London. |
There Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dis
covered Dr. Buck's friend and hired |
him as a screenwriter.
"I have kept in touch with Talbot
during these years. He is the type of
person whom you can meet tomor- j
row, then three years from tomor- j
row never notice the intervening (
time," concluded Professor Buck, i
"He is altogether one of the most j
charming, delightful, and witty per- J
sons I have ever known."

"In 1923," continued the professor,
"some of Talbot's English instructors
succeeded in getting him a fellow
ship at Harvard, where G. B. Baker
had become famous through his
Workshop 47. But—call it the irony

of fate —the year Talbot got to
Harvard, Professor Baker moved his
dramatic school to Yale. So after
two semesters, Talbot returned to
Idaho as an instructor."
Went to New York
Coming to the conclusion that he
would never write plays as long as he
was teaching. Jennings soon left
Idaho, The only place for a writer,
he thought, was New York City.
"I rather lost track of him after he
left this last time," declared Dr.
Buck. "No one heard much about
him for 10 years. He had no money
so he must have suffered terrible
hardships, doing hackwriting and
collaboration to make a living. I re
member that in those years I would
see items in the theatrical magazines
about plays a certain Talbot Jen

nings was planning to produce. But j
something would always happen."
Luck Changes
Finally Jennings' "No More Fron
tiers" was staged in the Provinetown i
Theater in New York. The author's!
luck had changed. Leslie Howard I
became interested in "This Side
Idolatry" and produced it in London. |
There Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dis
covered Dr. Buck's friend and hired |
him as a screenwriter.
"I have kept in touch with Talbot
during these years. He is the type of
person whom you can meet tomor- j
row, then three years from tomor- j
row never notice the intervening (
time," concluded Professor Buck, i
"He is altogether one of the most j
charming, delightful, and witty per- J
sons I have ever known."

Talbot Jennings to most campusites
is just another playwright. But to j
Philip G. Buck, associate professor of
political science, the author of "This
Side Idolatry," winter quarter play,
is old friend and college pal.
"Talbot Jennings?" Dr. Buck asked
when approached Friday afternoon,
surprise in his delighted smile. "Why,
I went to school with him." He took
several drags from an old pipe, lean
ed back in his chair, and began.
Together at Idaho
''We were fellow 'playwrights' at
the University of Idaho about 14
years ago. Talbot was older than I,
having seen service in France before
returning to Idaho to finish his edu
cation. I got to know him well in a I
play production class in which we
both wrote. I remember in 1922 we
were both enthusiastic because ours
were the two plays chosen in the
competition that year. But both of j
us had trouble producing our works
and decided right then that an au
thor should never try to produce his
own plays."
After the war Jennings had been
engineer for the Idaho highway de
partment. But playwrighting was for
him, not engineering, so he returned
to Idaho, where Professor Buck met
him.
Interests
Jennings' two main interests then,
as now, were Elizabethan England
and Shakespeare, and the American
pioneer frontier. "This Side Idolatry,"
a sketch of Will Shakespeare, the
unhaloed man, is of the first. "No
More Frontiers" and "American
Wing" resulted from his interest in
the early West.
