# Law of Revelation Subject of Sermon

### 
Speaking on "The Law of Revela
tion," Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Uni
versity chaplain, delivered his first
sermon of the quarter yesterday
morning in the Memorial Church.
Man need not necessarily toil to
live. Dr. Trueblood said. "A plain
shed, durably built, will protect a
man from storms as well as any other
building," Dr. Trueblood declared,
"but we are not satisfied with plain
sheds."
"We often search for beauty afar,"
Dr. Trueblood continued, "and never
see that which is surrounding us con
stantly. We do not need temples or
philosophy 01* art for survival," he
said, "but our deepest needs have
little to do with survival. Man is not
satisfied unless he goes beyond the
obvious and to go beyond the ob
vious means toil. It is to those who
knock and continue to knock that
the door is opened," Dr. Trueblood
concluded.
