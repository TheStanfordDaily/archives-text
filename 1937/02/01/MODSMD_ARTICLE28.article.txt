MEMPHIS, Tenn., Jan. 31 (UP).—
The miyhty Mississippi — a sullen
; prisoner inside the levees for ten
days — gave one wrathful surge
| against a sandbag wall near the Ten
nessee-Kentucky line today, smashed
I a half-mile gap and poured flood wa
j ter seven feet deep into the lowland.
I Tonight there was terror and de
struction all around the hamlet of
j Bessie, Tenn. Men, women and chil
; dren may have died, but no one was
' able to breast the onrushing flood im
[ mediately to check on possible loss of
: life and property destruction. Army
j engineers said they believed that
• most of the residents had been moved
! in time.
On other fronts a flood weary na
| tion counted 352 known dead as
waters gradually receded in the up
j per Ohio Valley. Rescue workers be
j lieved additional scores of deaths
! may be revaled as the flood subsides.
More than 1,000,000 were homeless.
One-quarter of these were in south
! ern states where the floods have not
yet reached their peaks.
Damage was estimated at close to
! half a billion dollars.
