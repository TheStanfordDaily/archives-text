# SIDELINE SLANTS

IT WAS TIED.
NOW IT STILL IS

When Stanford went south this
week-end and U.C.L.A. came north
to engage the Bears, the southern
division of the hoop conference was
generally tied up, with two unde
feated teams playing and two unvic
torious teams battling to get away
from the glue works.
The week-end is past history and
nobody's any better off than when
the fixing started. Coach Bunn's gang
had one of those unexplainable
slumps Friday night and just could
n't get the old boiler percolating, but
Saturday night things were different.
In only two other games this sea
son, against San Jose State and Can
isius, has the Crimson Crusher failed
to score more than 40 points. Inas
much as both of those games were
victories, they can hardly be termed
slumps.
Perhaps it seems a feeble excuse to
say that the first game the team has
lost is the first slump, for perhaps the
team had eked out wins over several
of those eastern schools only on luck.
Well, maybe, since I didn't see any
of those eastern games and I didn't
see either of the Southern Cal games
this week-end for purposes of com
parison, I am in no position to judge
whether the team slumped in the
South or whether the Trojans were
just too good.

THEY COASTED
FOR FIVE MINUTES

Nevertheless, the win Saturday j
night was put across with apparent
ease, for the Cards were ahead by 25
points with only ve minutes left to J
play. Such a turnabout seems more!
of an indication that the team has J
that invincible power that comes to i
only a few athletic teams, rather'
than that the Indians have been play- |
ing in luck so far.
The results of the week-end leave i
us with the same proposition that j
faced us last Monday. Stanford and |
Troy are still tied for the lead, with j
both currying one loss. Southern Cal'
has won five, Stanford has won four. j
California has lost four and won one,;
while U.C.L.A. has lost five and won!
one.
Figured on the percentage basis, of
course, Southern Cal is in the lead
with .833, while Stanford has .800.
However, this league is small enough,
and a round-robin besides, so that j
the number of losses is more indica
tive of the strength of a team than |
the percentage.

THE QUESTION IS ANALOGOUS
TO FOOTBALL

Coast basketball hasn't been |
strong, in comparison to other sec
tions of the nation, for a very long
period. Only within the last decade
or less have Pacific teams risen to the
point where they can contest the su
periority of eastern and mid-western i
schools. Even though the Universal j
Pictures team of Hollywood won the j
Olympic Tryouts last year, it hadn't
dawned on sports writers and coach
es of the East that maybe we play
pretty good basketball out here.
However, Stanford's tour during)
Christmas vacation certainly should 1
have convinced them that once in a
while a fair team comes out of the
West. And now that U.S.C. has won
one from the team that strode
through seven outfits that should
have been fairly indicative of the j
strength of that region, perhaps we
ran point to our conference as the
strongest, as a unit, in America.
The fact that Stanford could tram
ple all over the East and Middle
west without any trouble and then
come home to lose a game to one of I
its own league looks pretty good for j
our conference. Maybe that all leads
us back to the slump angle.

WHAT A SPOT
TO STUDY

It was tough on Howie Turner that i
he couldn't go to Los Angeles with j
the team, and he was rather obvious- I
ly missed, for his defensive play as
well as for his scoring ability. How
ever, he should have got some good
out of his sojourn in the hospital.
Dr. Fritz Roth stepped in to see
him Tuesday morning, and he was all
agog to get the answer that was going i
to let him go so he could play. Said !
Dr. Roth, "How' are you feeling this j
morning, Howie?"
"Fine," gushed the handsome crip- !
pie, "just fine."
"Well, now, that's nice," said the !
doctor, "you ought to get in a lot of j
reading here this week-end."
And while gloom settled over
Howie he stepped out.
