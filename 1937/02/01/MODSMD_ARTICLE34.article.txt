# Cards Scalp U.S.C. After 42-39 Loss
## Thumping 61-49 Victory Nets Stanford Tie With Troy for League Lead 
### GORDY FROST 
Stanford's basketball team suc
cessfully went on the testing block
last week-end.
First, it proved that it could swal
low a heartbreaking 42-39 loss, and
turn around mad enough to whip a
61 -49 victory from Sam Barry's
Trojans Saturday night.
Second, it proved that as a basket
ball team it is not invincible—but at
the same time, a team that, with
right attitude and powerful support,
can well move into a Southern Divi
sion Conference championship.
Coach John Bunn went on record
some weeks ago as saying Stanford
could be expected to drop one. That
happened Friday night. It was not
unexpected.
Troy Breaks Tie
Stanford had held a lead through
out the first half Friday, until just
four minutes before the final gun,
when the Trojans pulled into a 37-37
tie. A basket apiece and a field goal
made it 40-39.
Then, as the Redshirts strove des
perately to break up a U.S.C. keep
away game, three fouls were called.
U.S.C. made two of them count. So
it ended 42-39.
Next evening was a different story.
Still annoyed by super-close Trojan
guarding which one press bureau re
ported "hardly permitted them to
move," Stanford refused to be stop
ped.
The first half saw them pound into
a substantial 26-15 lead which was
lengthened throughout the second
period until with a 60-45 score a last
minute Trojan spurt closed the tally
to 61-49. U.S.C. never seriously
threatened. Stanford proved it could
lose and come back.
Bad News Department
Most anti-Stanford news of the
week-end: three Cards went out on
personal fouls during the last half
Saturday—Dinty Moore, Art Stoefen,
and H. B. Lee. A new record for
someone.
Most pro-Stanford news: Hank
Luisetti, under tight El Trojan
guardianship, scored 17 Friday night
and 26 Saturday.
While all this was happening down
in the Southlands, Cal and U.C.L.A.
were splitting a series at Berkeley.
Friday the Bears won, 33-27; Satur-!
day the Bruins triumphed 46-44. All
of which means that as far as South
ern Division victoi-y aspirations are 1
concerned Stanford and U.S.C. are
left to battle it out.
Worries Ahead
As Stanford goes back to practice
work this week, two humps lie ahead
next week-end. Friday night Uni
versity of California comes to the
Stanford Pavilion (get your seats:
early today). Saturday the Cards
meet U.S.F. in San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium for flood relief.
Doubt still remained last night
whether Howie Turner will be in
shape for action Friday. Sparky Rob
ertson, out with the flu, is expected
to be back in suit.
