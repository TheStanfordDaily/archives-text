# Stanford Ruggers Beat Alumni, 9-0
## 
### 
In a hard-fought and muddy battle
Saturday afternoon, the Stanford
rugby team defeated the Palo Alto
All-Blacks 9-0.
The All-Blacks, otherwise known
as the Stanford Alumni, several times
came very close to scoring, but
seemed to lack the punch necessary
to tally.
Two tries were made in the first
half one by Harry Goff, varsity wing,
and the other by Captain Joe Vigna,
three-quarters. In the second half,
the alumni tightened up, allowing
only one try, which came toward the j
close of the game.
Primo Pinnotti, varsity second
ranker, did a fine bit of dribbling in
taking the ball clear to the alumni
goal line, shooting it over to George '
Ditz, the other second ranker, who j
fell on it to make the last score of I
the game.
