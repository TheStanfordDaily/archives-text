# The
						Deal
## 
### 
AT midnight Friday, Jorgi saw his journalistic
passion flower turn into a typographical
pumpkin.
Gone as a weekly dose of civilization is the
tabby. Gone too is a Swiftian wit and a Spen
glerian intelligence, a bundle of action and
reaction that made Volume 90 the craziest, san
est and most interesting college paper that ever
lifted Stanford's corporate eyebrows.
In its place is a first-rate staff and a guy who
likes to rattle the world's tteeth by pulling the
world's tail, who believes back-patting is mali
ciously soporific, a kick in the pants the journal
ist's best gift and noblest reward.
So much for broad outlines of policy.
Mechanically, the tabby will be continued,
but as a supplement to the usual overfed and
undernourished eight-page Friday issues. It
will be filled far in advance with selected mate
rial. It will be thoroughly intelligent and enter
taining or it will be discontinued.
In its regular issues, The Daily will attempt
to present not only accurate news, but the accu
rate background of that news when such back
ground is significant. It will attempt to present
not only the latest unblessed event, but its papa
and mama and maybe its grandma.

ALTHOUGH it is obvious that mere access
to a Linotype doesn't make student jour
nalists arbiters to a university, there is no rea
son why student journalists cannot be inter
preters of a university.
To this end, harried staff members will not
ask harried professors and student office-hold
ers to unriddle the riddle of the universe a half
hour before press time.
Instead, special contributors will do the job.
They will be writers of proved skill and intelli
gence, and they will have big time to get the
big story — accurately and completely. Such
people live at Stanford as well as in Heaven.
They are Irvin Jorgensen, Annalee Whitmore,
Dick Hodgson, Hunter Hendee, George Veness,
and Phil Bernheim. Others, if willing, will be
drafted.
It will be The Daily's job to explain before it
criticizes. There will, therefore, be comprehen
sive articles on such debated institutions as the
Union. The approach will be made not by pro
fessional rat-smellers but by efficient exposi
tors. If the rat smells, it's not our fault.
The result, we hope, will not only be a better
understanding of Stanford by Stanfordites, but
a better understanding of Stanford by the
public.
For it is our belief that if we can present in
teresting stories of constructive work being
done here, the city papers will pick them up.
Such stories will not better Stanford's pub
licity positively, but they will negatize the bad
publicity city papers inevitably ferret out de
spite administrative shushing.
TO be explicit, we would say that to Mr. and
Mrs. Public, Stanford is the school where
Lamson did or did not murder his wife and
where Peter Jewett was found dead of skull
fracture. That a Stanford coed faced an aliena
tion-of-affections suit is merely the latest inter
secting point in a swooping curve of "deca
dence."
We feel we can help level that curve by the
publication of stories similar in news-interest
to Dr. Schultz' infantile paralysis research. In
the long run, we might even help cancel the
stereotype that Stanford is the richest school in
the world—not partly a professorial workshop,
but exclusively the playshop of socialite spawn
that makes the news almost exclusively from
the police blotter.
for today Stanford needs money. It will got

the money only if it has something to sell, but
so far as the general public is concerned Stan
ford has nothing to sell except worn-out road
sters.
Actually, its saleable good is a promise to
teach the world more than the world's jungle
gibberish of scientific and social facts.
And part of our job, as we see it, is to publish
literature descriptive of the redemption of that
promise—publicizing its value.
The rest of our job is to inform you about
something small and to amuse you about
nothing big.—The Editor
