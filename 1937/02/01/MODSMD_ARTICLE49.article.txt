# O.K. Luisetti!

HANK LUISETTI'S face fell. He had just
learned no complimentary tickets will be
issued for Saturday night's flood relief game
with U.S.F.
Hank's parents would like to see him play
that game—the first for them this season. It
would be nice if they had good seats—comps.
B.A.C. officials thought it over, decided it
would be nice too, and made arrangements.
Mr. and Mrs. Luisetti will watch son Hank
from complimentary seats Saturday night.
