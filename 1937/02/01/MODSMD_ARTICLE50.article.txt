# "Nine Old Men" Get- Publicity
## 
### 
(From the Daily Californian)
In order to bring that gay, satirical volume
"Nine Old Men," written recently by Pearson
and Allen, to public attention, a Senate investi
gation into the book has been demanded.
Of course, it may be a publicity stunt. Then,
again, it may not. Only staunch defenders of
Those Nine Old Men, the Supreme Court
judges, are positive of an undercover motive
in the apparently simple investigation.
Pearson and Allen use the most powerful of
democratic weapons, ridicule. It is not a subtle,
nor too obviously cruel ridicule.
A public attitude of open derision would
probably be a much graver menace to the sta
bility of the Old Men than any conviction of
their inefficiency or injustice.â€”M. E., '38
