VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI
Ya, yah, Prendermuzzv,
This is a letter about, potlikkcr and teeth. How'rc
yours?
All gripes are Sour South. Bitter belches befog the
light. Farmers wear out their land and their teeth at
36. Kiddies that live on potlikkcr and slop ain't well
built. People have lots to make up. And lose their
teeth.
* * * *
Malaria isn't the vogue till spring. Typhoid will
follow the flood, of course. And the flood will be here in
two weeks. I saw samples up on Muddy Bayou yester
day of your dyed-blue individualist. Cajuns on house
boats, the free life with rod and gun and plenty of brats
—and no teeth. Not till last Thursday could they belong
to the Union League Club. Thank God the walruses
saw the light. Some Democrats know the good life, too.
I'm starting a fund to get Puss-Eye Corbett from out
of Marcus Bottom. Could you do something for Wil
liam Furzey? He's got 16 kids by his eldest, daughter
and as fine a still as they is in Revenue Bog. Eight
deserving, I reckon, but I can't do it all.
The negroes are all around. They work for 15 cents
an hour. But then they only have to work 60 hours a
week. And lose their teeth with the white folks.
F.D.R. is Jesus here. And being here. I sure know
that he is. New life to the land, new x'ights to poor
trash, black and white. And eventually, so help me,
new teeth.
* * * *
And who brought the light in here?
