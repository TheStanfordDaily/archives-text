EVEN BEFORE GOVERNOR
MERRIAM a Stanford man was Ihe
first to cross the Bay Bridge. BILL
DOBLE, a frosh, decided that he and
his friend should make that privi
lege theirs, and they set out one
night across two miles of lead road
from Emeryville. Bill says it was too
dark to read the 'No Trespassing"
signs.
Not thrilled enough by dodging
guards, they decided to clamber over
the toes of the bridge instead of the
paved highway—out of the fog into
the blackness of the tunnel only to
find themselves tripping over scaf
folding which lined the tunnel walls.
About 15 yards further on, the cat
walk ceased to be, but the cable went
on and they went with it. They
picked their way through the rough
laridge work, but suddenly on the San
Francisco side the bridge ended with
no apparent way of getting off. A
watchman solved the problem. See
ing they were spotted, they were
forced to jump down 20 feet onto the
cliff, pick themselves up, and scam
per off into the night.

REAL BLUE BLOOD does not
appear on the campus every day, but
1937 finds Stanford with royalty
from France. To us here at Stanford
he is known as just 808 deMAILLY,
but among the "frogs" he is recog
nized as Count Robert deMailly.
Bob, also a frosh, is indirectly in
line for the throne because of his

title which was handed down to him
by his late Count lather. When asked
about this title, he very modestly as
serted, "It really doesn't mean a
thing because royalty over there is
just as thick as flies." There's a cam
pus song which says, "I'm going to
marry a girl from Stanford U; I'm
going to change her blood from red
to blue"—but Bob deMailly is prob
ably the only one who could do the
trick.

Of Stanford's total enrollment of
3.888, 1,5G8 are lower division stu
dents, and 2 are pre-nursing majors.
