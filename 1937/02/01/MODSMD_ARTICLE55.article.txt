# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Discussion of the coming construc
tion of,the Education and Law Build
ings oh the quadrangle already filled
in by the Library and Art Gallery
has revealed a need which you must
have felt.
Obviously we cannot forever keep
calling this group of buildings the

"second quad" or the "other quad."
It should be given a name to dis
tinguish it from the Stanford Quad,
and this alumnus hereby suggests
that it be called "Jordan Quad," in
memory of David Starr Jordan, the
name that in most parts of the world
is brought to mind when the word
"Stanford" is mentioned.
None of the present generation of
Stanford students, I imagine, ever
had the privilege of saluting the fine
"old man" as he strode about the
campus which he has enduringly
marked with the stamp of his great
character. Those of us who had the

privilege cannot forget Dr. Jordan;
but we should bo happy to have the
younger Stanford people remember
his name more often. Ii? keeping
green the greatness of this scholar,
educator, author, scientist, and first
builder of Stanford, all of us would
bo honoring ourselves. Let it be
"Jordan Quad"!
