# Epidemic Scare Called Baseless
## Storey Blames Season As Cause of Grippe 
### 
No epidemic of flu, but merely
the annual winter quarter peak load
of respiratory infections has packed
the campus rest homes and hospitals,
according to Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
medical adviser of men and chairman
of the Faculty Public Health Com
mittee.
Three weeks ago the margin of
empty beds in the Palo Alto hospital
was alarmingly small. Two weeks
ago the hospital, plus the Men's and
Women's rest homes, were filled and
the Student Guild Hospital was
opened to care for the overflow of
Stanford patients. At present there
are 14 patients in the special hospital
which is being run by the Public
Health Committee and the Student
Hospital Fund Committee.
"We have a large number of colds
and the number of influenza cases is
increasing," said Dr. Storey. "The
disease is as easily transmitted by
people who have had it and have
been cured, but still carry the germ,
as by those who are still sick."

To avoid catching the flu, Dr.
Storey recommends avoiding ex
posure to chilling temperatures,
keeping your feet dry and avoiding
excessive fatigue.
