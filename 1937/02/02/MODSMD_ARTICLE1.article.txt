## WRAPPED AS A GIFT TWO YEARS OF 'DHR' DIS IS A SUBDGECK 
### 
r PHE King of the Masque Ball is
not dead. He is tied up with the
prettiest bow-knot ever seen outside
a candy store.
And with Valentine's Day in the
offing, we suggest that Cardnials give
the King, all prettied up with red
tape, to Women's Conference. Or are
we wrong. Have they already done
just that.
They may have. Because it is ob
vious the two groups did more yes
terday than decide which was to ap
pear the silliest ass.
The King and Queen, themselves,
were tossed back and forth, from
faction, to faction, until no one knows
who crowned whom. But we sus
pect the women crowned Cardinals.
In case of a revolution, we nomi
nate Dr. Wilbur as arbiter. But it
seems unnecessary to suggest a
peaceful solution when things are
becoming so delightfully war-like,
with brass hats appointed to do
everything but fire the guns.
During 1917-18, privates merely
sighed when they received messages
on the following order: Cardinals
will meet Wednesday to decide when
a committee will meet to decide
what about the King-Queen Con
test.
Try and say that fast. It will re
lieve your nerves more than sighing.
We see by the papers another proof
Ihat colleges teach too many phys
ical facts and not enough social ones.
Into the San Francisco apartment of
Mr. John Turner, 28-year-old grad
uate of the Colorado School of Mines
and McNeil Island Penitentiary,
walked two policemen Monday. They
did not drop in for tea. They dropped
in to arrest Mr. Turner for counter
feiting, and with him, his wife,
Myrtle.
It seems Mr. Turner took too much
metallurgy and not enough social
psych at Colorado, for the coins he
learned to manufacture in four years'
easy lessons he foolishly distributed
in close proximity to his home.
Now Mr. Turner will have time for
a nice long course in the Cultivation
of Horse Sense, dhr ( ), plenty
of dhr.
Yesterday, as today, we started off
without telling you why we were
starting. But if you've read down
this far, you know why.
Today we had a grand time lis
tening to Cesar Franck's D Minor
Symphony, being playea for all it
was worth by the Paris Conservatory
Orchestra on the Union Cellar phon
ograph. It was played loud, too, so
loud that people couldn't get to first
base while talking from leather chair
to leather chair.
We felt £s if we were the front
guard of a cultural revolution, for
the man who owns the symphony
records owns no phonograph, and
uses the Cellar machine. He will
probably be told to quit—on account
of the noise.
Probably because they were sick
and tired of such subjects as the
New Deal, the Old Deal, and Whither
Europe, Stanford's debaters . now
artfully ask, "Don't Stanford guys
speak lousy English?"
They will debate the question,
more redundantly put, in the new
Open Forum to be held in the Little
Theater at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow. And
they will probably speak lousy Eng
lish while doing it. —B. E. j

Into the San Francisco apartment of
Mr. John Turner, 28-year-old grad
uate of the Colorado School of Mines
and McNeil Island Penitentiary,
walked two policemen Monday. They
did not drop in for tea. They dropped
in to arrest Mr. Turner for counter
feiting, and with him, his wife,
Myrtle.
It seems Mr. Turner took too much
metallurgy and not enough social
psych at Colorado, for the coins he
learned to manufacture in four years'
easy lessons he foolishly distributed
in close proximity to his home.
Now Mr. Turner will have time for
a nice long course in the Cultivation
of Horse Sense, dhr ( ), plenty

Yesterday, as today, we started off
without telling you why we were
starting. But if you've read down
this far, you know why.
Today we had a grand time lis
tening to Cesar Franck's D Minor
Symphony, being playea for all it
was worth by the Paris Conservatory
Orchestra on the Union Cellar phon
ograph. It was played loud, too, so
loud that people couldn't get to first
base while talking from leather chair
to leather chair.
We felt £s if we were the front
guard of a cultural revolution, for
the man who owns the symphony
records owns no phonograph, and
uses the Cellar machine. He will
probably be told to quit—on account
of the noise.
Probably because they were sick
and tired of such subjects as the
New Deal, the Old Deal, and Whither
Europe, Stanford's debaters . now
artfully ask, "Don't Stanford guys
speak lousy English?"
They will debate the question,
more redundantly put, in the new
Open Forum to be held in the Little
Theater at 8:30 p.m. tomorrow. And
they will probably speak lousy Eng
lish while doing it. —B. E. j
People want to know who the gal
was on the cover of the Minicam
Chappie. She was Edith Muir, a
former art major.
r PHE King of the Masque Ball is
not dead. He is tied up with the
prettiest bow-knot ever seen outside
a candy store.
And with Valentine's Day in the
offing, we suggest that Cardnials give
the King, all prettied up with red
tape, to Women's Conference. Or are
we wrong. Have they already done
just that.
They may have. Because it is ob
vious the two groups did more yes
terday than decide which was to ap
pear the silliest ass.
The King and Queen, themselves,
were tossed back and forth, from
faction, to faction, until no one knows
who crowned whom. But we sus
pect the women crowned Cardinals.
In case of a revolution, we nomi
nate Dr. Wilbur as arbiter. But it
seems unnecessary to suggest a
peaceful solution when things are
becoming so delightfully war-like,
with brass hats appointed to do
everything but fire the guns.
During 1917-18, privates merely
sighed when they received messages
on the following order: Cardinals
will meet Wednesday to decide when
a committee will meet to decide
what about the King-Queen Con
test.
Try and say that fast. It will re
lieve your nerves more than sighing.
