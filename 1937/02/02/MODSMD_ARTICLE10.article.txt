# Queen Contest Outlawed in '36, Becomes '37 Problem
## Charity Plan Made $4,000 Last Spring Charges of Corruption Hurled at Contest In Original Abandonment 
### 
Just one month after the 1936
king-queen contest had earned the
Convalescent Home over $4,000, Ex
Committee dinged the time - tar
nished rat-race for good and all.
Objecting to the identification of
attainment with dollars and cents,
and to corrupt practices prevailing,
Bob Gros presented arguments
which led the entire body to dis
card this event with near-unanimity.
Next year's plans for raising Con
valescent Home money, they said,
should be left to next year's groups.
The possibility of holding a popular
ity contest with only a small entry
fee was suggested.
Prolonged Deliberation
So the matter rested until a few
months ago when Cardinals, sub
sidiary committee of Ex Committee
which sponsors activities, reconsid
ered the matter.
After prolonged deliberation, a
plan was submitted which tended to
reduce to a minimum the evils
caused by the money angle and the
rat-race phase.
In a free and general election,
everyone would be allowed to vote
for any king and queen of his choice.
From these preliminary ballots
would be selected the highest ten
men and ten women to run, with
votes costing a few cents apiece and
unlimited. Voters would sign their
names to the ballots.
Plan Still in Muddle
The day before the Masque Ball,
a blindfolded child from the Con
valescent Home would pick one of
the ten couples as king and queen.
Moreover, the voter who had picked
the winners would receive a valu
able award.
This plan- incurred the disapproval
of Women's Conference, who object
to any contest for popularity, and
rejected altogether the use of such
methods for raising money.
The entire issue of the king-queen
contest was at this pass yesterday
when Conference and Cardinals sat
down around the council table to
decide the entire issue.
