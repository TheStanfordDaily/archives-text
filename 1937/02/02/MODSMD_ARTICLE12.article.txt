# No Use Moaning

Tickets are gone—but there's no
use moaning.
When rooters' tickets for Friday
night's California-Stanford basket
ball game gave out at 1:30 yester
day a waiting list was started,
amidst screams from disappointed
Stanfordites who faced being shut
out of the biggest game of the year,
right on their own campus.
But there's no place to rest the
blame for the situation, except per
haps on the fellow who built the
Pavilion. For unless someone can
build a Pavilion-stretcher there
just "ain't room."
For (he disbelievers, News Serv
ice Director Don Liebendorfer has
released these figures to show how
the seats are allocated: Two bands,
100 seats; press sections, 100; team
benches (trainers, players, man
agers, etc.), 120; workers, police

and traffic, 40; faculty athletic
tickets, 40; California, 1150; Stan
ford, 1150; and standing room on
sale the day of the game, 250.
The grand total, including stand
ing room, is just 2950. When the
Pavilion has that many people in it
it is full—in fact., it is bulging.
There is, however, a slight chance
that California may return some of
its 1150 quota tonight. If so, Stan
ford waiting list applicants will get
them. If not, the only hope for
' Stanfordites to see the game is by
i purchase of standing room at the
' gate.
Meanwhile, rooters' tickets for
the Stanford-U.S.F. flood charity
game in the Civic Auditorium in
San Francisco Saturday night con
tinued on sale until 5 o'clock this
' afternoon in the BA C. Building,
i They are 50 cents each.
