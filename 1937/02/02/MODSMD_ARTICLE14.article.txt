# Europe's Monarchies Fall--Like Stanford's
## 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
"The tradition of electing a queen
of the Masque Ball was abolished
last night by an the Rally
Committee, upon the recommenda
tion of representatives of various
women's societies on the campus.
Nominations for king will be re
opened, and the elected king will
choose the queeW
But don't get excited. That was
taken from The Daily files of April
25, 1925, the night before the Masque
Ball.
Same Old Stufl"
Last night, substantially the same
conclusion was reached by Women's
Conference, if not by Cardinals. In
twelve years the Masque Ball has
spun around its dizzy cycle, and
here we are back again.
In 1925 ihe agglomerated women
of Stanford University expressed
their disapproval of the battle royal.
In 1937, the agglomerated women
have spoken again. Time mumbles
on.
The objections of a dozen years
ago sqund suspiciously like the cur
rent ones" except that there are more
whereases: "1. Whereas the King
and Queen Contest has ceased to
retain its original significance due to
the prevailing attitude of insincerity
and the attempt to make the posi
tion one which is unendurable.
"2. Whereas, representatives of the
Women's Council, Cap and Gown,
Pan-Hellenic, and Women's "S" so
cieties have registered well-founded
complaints,
"The conditions of the King and

Queen Contest have been changed
to read as follows:
"1. A king is to be elected from
the student body at large with the
following qualifications:
"a. He shall agree to conduct him
self in a gentlemanly manner and
becoming a Stanford man at the
Masque Ball.
"b. He shall participate in cere
monies at the Masque Ball under the
direction of the floor manager.
"c. He is to secure the company of
a girl, any one he chooses, who will
act as queen of the Masque Ball.
"d. The disposition of the money
on hand, amounting to roughly §20,
will be handled as suggested by the
Executive Committee."
So for 20 bucks, the Masque Ball
Contest was dinged heavily, not to
raise its head above the antedilu
vian slime again until 1928.
Drunk, Apparently
Though the contemporary chron
icle seems to be rather deficient in
the causes for the sudden demise,
good guesses and talks with old
timers indicate the days during pro
hibition were a lot more hilarious on
the Farm than those after Repeal.
Apparently, the King got drunk.
We hope the Queen did not. Any
how the agglomerated women did
not like the ethics surrounding the
1925 election and sat quite heavily
on the whole business.

Masque Ball history. The second in
