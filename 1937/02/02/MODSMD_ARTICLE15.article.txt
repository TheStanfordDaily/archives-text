# Storey Cautions Cold Sufferers
## 
### 
The number of Farm flu patients
decreased over the week-end, ac
cording to a statement of Dr. Walter
H. Brown, director of the University
Health Service. There has been no
actual epidemic here because that
condition means that 10 per cent of
the population is ill, and less than
one per cent of Stanford has been
laid up.
Dr. Thomas Storey, medical ad
viser of men, cautioned students to
exercise particular care at this time.
Common colds are easily contracted,
and with prevailing weather condi
tions and the close associations of
a large school, ihey can easily turn
into influenza. Serious infections of
the upper respiratory tract are a
common result of this condition.
Both the Palo Alto Hospital and
the Men's and Women's Rest Homes
are full due to cases of influenza in
Palo Alto and several on the cam
pus. The Student Guild Hospital
has been opened on the campus by
the Student Hospital Fund Commit
tee to take care of the overflow of
flu cases.
