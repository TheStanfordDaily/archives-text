# Cards, Women Still Wage Royalty Battle
## Conference Determined To Block Scheme Put Forth by Cardinals 
### 
Out of an hour's consultation by
Women's Conference and Cardinals
over the body of King Masque came
the announcement of a new com
mittee, and the announcement of
another meeting to decide when the
new committee would meet.
The consultation held yesterday
found the Conference standing pat
on its refusal to sanction a King-
Queen Contest, and the Cardinals
standing equally pat on their pro
posal for a contest with the royal
honors raffled off.
Men's Ideas Scorned
Barbara Kimball, Women's Con
ference president, declared the
Farm's daughters would have none
of the Farm son's idea, and pro
duced polls taken in women's living
groups to prove feminine disap
proval of the Contest.
Chick Fran ich, Cardinals chair
man, pointed out the spirit of char
ity that prevailed in his system,
characterized by king - selection
without a profit motive and with
chance dealing the honorsâ€”draw
ing straws, to you.
Gives Unwanted Publicity
Meanwhile the women lost no
chance to point out that the contest
creates bad blood between living
groups and between Hall and Row,
that it causes "unwanted" publicity,
that Ex Committee dinged the affair,
excoriating monetary considerations
which have governed the selection
of "monarchs" in the past.
All of which did not settle any
thing. Instead Cardinals and Wom
en's Conference decided to appoint
a committee including Mary Bel
ford, Marion Hinton and Frances
Strong of the Conference and Chick
Franich, Bob Mallett and Barbara
Murphy of Cardinals.
Cardinals will meet Wednesday to
decide when the committee will
meet and how it will operate.
