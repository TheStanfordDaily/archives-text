# Break in Key Levee Feared
## Winds Peril 'Danger Spot' On 1200 Mile Front 
### 
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 1 (UP).—
The winds allied themselves tonight,
with the flooded Mississippi River
and began to kick choppy waves
against the levee at Bessie, Tenn.—
"danger spot" in the 1200-mile, line
of walls from Cairo, 111., to New Or
leans.
"The levee can't hold unless the
wind abates," was the word that
came out of Bessie, which was rav
aged by water yesterday when a
sandbag wall crumbled under the
day-and-night pounding of the
river.
An emergency call was sent to
five Civilian Conservation Corps
camps in western Tennessee, asking
that reinforcements be sent imme
diately to the Bessie sector.
The levee protects Tiptonvillc,
Tenn., where 2000 refugees are con
centrated.
Elsewhere the 500.000 persons
whose lives depend on the strength of
the levees appeared to be safe tem
porarily, although known dead to
taled 373-, homeless 1,000.000, while
property damage was set at $500,-
000.000.
