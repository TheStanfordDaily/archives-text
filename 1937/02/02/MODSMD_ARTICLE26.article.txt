# Battle Over 'Junior Man' Is Predicted
## Eating Clubs Plan Hall's Line â€“ up; Swampum Picks Row Nominees 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM 
Today is nomination day.
Small slips will be circulated in
every living group, and small slips
will probably be made by all con
cerned, but here's Swampum's pre
diction:
Junior man on Ex Committee
promises a hard battle. The halls
have turned to early organization as
the sure cure for all ailments. Last
Wednesday the Inter-Club Coun
cil secretly planned their line-up,
which we guess to be John Dern for
junior man, with Jack Calderwood
perhaps running instead. Both are
Toros, and the Toros say Dern won't
run. Ed Burnett may be third sub
stitute for this or something.
Women Left Out
Stan Zimet for Men's Council,
Roger Munger for Alustiza's old
B.A.C. post, and Joe Weiner for
graduate man, probably finish their
list, which may have been approved
last night, if a rumored caucus was
held. "The women can take care of
themselves," they conclude.
The Row's machine is still in neu
tral to date. Row bright lights as
junior man are Bob McCroskey, Phi
Delt, with one eye on the A.S.S.U.
presidency; Tom Collins, Phi Delt,
who seems to think he'll run; Bob
Adams, Theta Delt, who is sure he
will.
Row "Waiting"
Hank Luisetti, Tom Killefer,
Wayne Richardson, and George Mc-
Cioskey are all being saved for big
ger things. The old Zete-Phi Delt-
Sigma Chi alliance may turn up in
June to divide the spoils as they did
last year, walking off amicably with
the three top posts. Tim Hayes or
Ed Burrows would be the Sigma
Chi big shots.
"Taking care of themselves" shows
no organization among the women.
Only possibilities to date are Luigi
Schmidt for Council, Jean Hemphill
same (her declination of a Lagunita
postition indicates something), Betty
Hellyer from the Row, and Didi Vi
bert for soph woman on Ex Com
mittee.
Daily Men "Maneuver"
Meanwhile the Daily minions open
a new era in political maneuvers.
They plan \o omit all notice of the
election, run Gordy Frost for Ex
Committee, Phil Klauber and John
Rice for Council, and Leonard Blai-
Rie for graduate man. They'll be the
only ones who'll know when to vote.
That's organization.
