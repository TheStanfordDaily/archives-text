# German 'BMW'—-Little Car with Big Stuff--Gets 26 M.P. Gallon
## Exchange Student Brings 'Deutscher Wagen' 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
'"Do your American cars get only
20 miles to the gallon?"
Hans-Erich Schurer, German ex
change student at the Phi Delt
hou.se, was astonished when the Palo
Alto dealers from whom he intended
to buy an automobile, told him the
facts, and immediately sent the Ba
varian Motor 5000 marks for
"ei nguter deutscher wagen."
And this "good German car"
which Hans-Erich drove from New
York last week is the small low
convertible sedan you have seen
parked in the Phi Delt driveway
and weaving about in Palo Alto
traffic for the past week.

Hans-Erich is not satisfied if his
"BMW," as the car is called, does
not get 26 miles to a gallon of gaso
line. It develops 45 horsepower and
will go 90 miles an hour.
The Bavarian Motor Works is
really an airplane factory, but they
do build a few high-priced auto
mobiles. Under the Hitler regime,
exchange students from Germany
are allowed to exchange only 26
dollars' worth of marks for Ameri
can money each month.
So Hans-Erich really had no
choice between an American car
and one that could be purchased
with German money. The price of
the car, 5000 marks, is the equivalent
of 3500 earned dollars. Delivery
costs to New York were 200 dollars.

The dashboard of the BMW is
similar to those on American "auto
mobiles, except that the speedome
ter reads in kilometers, the ther
mometer in Centigrade degrees, and
the gasoline gauge in liters.
Adolf, as he is known to the Phi
Delts, was careful to include in his
order all the gadgets he could get.
Some of these are required in Eu
rope, such as the signals on either
side of the front window to indicate
a left or right turn. On the fenders
there are miniature flag poles, such
as those on sailboats, to tell where
the car is from.
Permanent License
The license number 11U13025 is
permanent. The plate is put on at

the factory, and remains there dur
ing the life of the car. The red seal
in the center is the stamp of the
German police. A large "D" on a
round disc over the license plate in
dicates that the car is fVom Deutsch
land .
Herr Schurer realized that he
would be unable to get replace
ments in America, so he brought
with him a complete set of extra
parts built at the factory, nearly
enough to build another BMW.
The auto has a permit to remain
in the United States for 90 days
without duty. Somebody once asked
what he intended to do when the
limit is up. "Himmel!" said Hans-
Erich, "I'll decide that in 90 days."


TO HANS-ERICH SCHURER, shown above, German exchange
student living with the Phi Delts, this car is a "ein guter deutscher
wagon." But it's a darned good buggy, to you. The smallest car on the
campus, Erich says it goes best.
