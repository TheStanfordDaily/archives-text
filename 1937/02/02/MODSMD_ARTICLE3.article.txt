# Seniors Plan To Eliminate Class Dues
## D'Evelyn Says Dropping Of Annual Picnic, Prom Will Be Considered 
### 
Radical departure from customary
procedure, including abandonment
of senior class dues, were given as
possibilcities last night in advance
plans for the remainder of the year,
outlined by President Mort D'Eve
lyn.
Collection of the usual $2.50 dues,
which are ordinarily used to defray
expenses of the class during senior
week in the spring, will be unneces
sary if the treasury surplus is large
enough to handle scheduled events,
D'Evelyn said.
No Official Decision
Official decision on the question
will be made as soon as estimates
have been completed.
Another strong possibility is that
such events as the senior picnic and
prom, which have received only
lukewarm support in recent years,
will be dropped from the program.
The plan, approved in unofficial
statements by class leaders, includes
substitution of more popular activi
ties if a fuller schedule is desired.
New Appointments
Whether these events will be
drqpped arbitrarily or by committee
action was not known.
Under consideration of D'Evelyn
and his associates this week are ap
pointments to senior committees and
the selection of heads of the various
class organizations. Names of the
appointees will be announced prob
ably next week, it was said.
