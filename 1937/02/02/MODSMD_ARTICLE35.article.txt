## Madariaga Critical Of Left, Right Dictators 
### 
Referring to the 1930s as the time
in which the "powers of liberty and
ideals of democracy are at their low
est ebb," Dr. Salvador de Madariaga
y Rojo, former Spanish ambassador
to the United Slates and chairman
of the League of Nation's Committee
of Five, began his attack on fascism
and communism yesterday afternoon
in the Assembly Hall.
Dr. de Madariaga pointed out that,
while there has been despotism at
many periods of world history, there
has never before been a "despotic
theory." He credits Lenin and the
extreme left with the introduction
of violence in internal politics as a
justified force.
"Fascism and communism pi'esent
themselves as two ways of doing the
wrong thing, and we must find a
good way of doing neither," Dr. de
Madariaga declared.
The speaker criticized the "absurd
limits" to which personal liberty has
been allowed tc go in some democra
cracies. Dr. de Madariaga enlarged
on this subject by saying that in
physical, economical, and material
matters the individual should serve
the state, and that in political, philo
sophical, literary, and aesthetic
planes he should be his own master.
The distinguished diplomat deplored
such excesses of individual liberty
as present strikes, which have been
allowed to tie up industry.
Dr. de Madariaga, who is a present
working with a "World Foundation"
lor peace, which is independent both
of governments and sponsors, con
cluded by stating that "the prob
lem before us is the intelligent or
ganization of the life of the human
race on this world."
