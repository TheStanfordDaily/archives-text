# Turner Out Of Week-end Play; Remodel Team
## Moore Goes to Forward; Lee Takes Over Guard Position; Rest Intact 
### GORDY FROST 
"No Turner this week-end"—that
w;is essentially what Dr. Fritz Roth s
announcement of "chances are ex
tremely doubtful" meant to Coach
John Burin yesterday. Which means
to Stanford that a full strength var
sity won't be present to welcome bas
ketball forces from California Friday
I
night.
Still. Turner's absence causes less
concern in Pavilion regions than it!
did a week ago, for the week-end's |
activities in Los Angeles served as I
the proving ground for a combina
tion which Burin expects will attend
to the California situation come this j
week-end.
New Combination
Burin's combination wasn't really j
discovered until Saturday night — j
that perhaps being one reason fori
Friday's anti-Stanford outcome. But i
the new set-up clicked well Satur- j
day, and gained confidence which |
bespoke the old Luisetti-Turner out- ,
fit - , I
Dinty Moore becomes a forward to j
work with Luisetti now, and H. B. j
Lee, who played a pair of heads-up :
ball games down south, goes to the
guard job. Jack Calderwood andj
Art Stoefen stay at their guard and j
center posts, respectively.
Boss Bunn has great confidence in j
his combination now, says that it
looked like the real thing Saturday
night.
Incidentally, with all this talk!
about new set-ups and Turner out, j
we thought perhaps Dr. Roth might j
be planning to spring a "Turner out
for season'' soon. Don Liebendorfer
has it that Roth will send Howie back
next week. He is not out for the;
season.
No Alibis for Friday
On campus yesterday, Bunn and ,
his boys went through the mill con- !
cerning the whys and wherefores of
the U.S.C. loss.
Out of it all, one point was certain
—there were no alibis. Bunn reports j
that Friday night Stanford was |
sloppy on taking rebounds, andj
lacked the usual offensive brilliance. !
Things just didn't click. No gripe
was aired on the officiating.
Stanford did come back pretty j
well bruised up, however. Luisetti j
is said to have been out cold for j
three minutes from a stiff blow he ]
took on the head—otherwise no spe- j
cific injuries are reported. j
To Play Cal. U.S.F.
To give first varsity an opportu- ,
nity to rest after the week-end of
travel and play, Bunn held no prac- |
tice yesterday. During the remainder j
of the week he will work on funda
mentals—guarding, the quick break,
and shooting. (

California, Stanford goes to San i

John Burin yesterday. Which means
to Stanford that a full strength var
sity won't be present to welcome bas
ketball forces from California Friday
I
night.
Still. Turner's absence causes less
concern in Pavilion regions than it!
did a week ago, for the week-end's |
activities in Los Angeles served as I
the proving ground for a combina
tion which Burin expects will attend
to the California situation come this j
week-end.
New Combination
Burin's combination wasn't really j
discovered until Saturday night — j
that perhaps being one reason fori
Friday's anti-Stanford outcome. But i
the new set-up clicked well Satur- j
day, and gained confidence which |
bespoke the old Luisetti-Turner out- ,
fit - , I
Dinty Moore becomes a forward to j
work with Luisetti now, and H. B. j
Lee, who played a pair of heads-up :
ball games down south, goes to the
guard job. Jack Calderwood andj
Art Stoefen stay at their guard and j
center posts, respectively.
Boss Bunn has great confidence in j
his combination now, says that it
looked like the real thing Saturday
night.
Incidentally, with all this talk!
about new set-ups and Turner out, j
we thought perhaps Dr. Roth might j
be planning to spring a "Turner out
for season'' soon. Don Liebendorfer
has it that Roth will send Howie back
next week. He is not out for the;
season.
No Alibis for Friday
On campus yesterday, Bunn and ,
his boys went through the mill con- !
cerning the whys and wherefores of
the U.S.C. loss.
Out of it all, one point was certain
—there were no alibis. Bunn reports j
that Friday night Stanford was |
sloppy on taking rebounds, andj
lacked the usual offensive brilliance. !
Things just didn't click. No gripe
was aired on the officiating.
Stanford did come back pretty j
well bruised up, however. Luisetti j
is said to have been out cold for j
three minutes from a stiff blow he ]
took on the head—otherwise no spe- j
cific injuries are reported. j
To Play Cal. U.S.F.
To give first varsity an opportu- ,
nity to rest after the week-end of
travel and play, Bunn held no prac- |
tice yesterday. During the remainder j
of the week he will work on funda
mentals—guarding, the quick break,
and shooting. (
Following Friday night's play with !
California, Stanford goes to San i
Francisco Saturday to meet U.S.F. in j
the Civic Auditorium.
"No Turner this week-end"—that
w;is essentially what Dr. Fritz Roth s
announcement of "chances are ex
tremely doubtful" meant to Coach
John Burin yesterday. Which means
to Stanford that a full strength var
sity won't be present to welcome bas
ketball forces from California Friday
