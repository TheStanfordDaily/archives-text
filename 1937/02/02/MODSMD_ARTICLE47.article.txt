j day.
John A. Flu, the boogeyman of all
i basketball athletes, after earlier
; hacking down scrappy Forward Bob
| Oakford, has now added to his long
! list of victims Ted Lyon. What's
more, he's slapped a technical foul on
j Leon Lalaille, who is taking it very
j easy with a heavy cold to look after.
Thus, minus his front line howitz
| ers, Wytze had a tough time finding
j a team which could hold down his
i germie five. Working together as a
i first team were Tom Siebert, Andy
| Anderson, Gil Hahn, Lew Staehle,
and Bill Leckie.
This quintet had a hard time get
ting co-ordinated at first, but toward
! the end of practice they became
i fairly smooth, slipping into last
! breaks with a good deal of consist
' ency, and making shots count for
j points.
The frosh have a heavy schedule
| listed for this week. Wednesday night
j in the Pavilion they meet San Mateo
Jaysee. Friday night, as a prelim to
J the varsity game, the tangle with
' the Cal Frosh, and Saturday evening,
again playing the preliminary game,
i they come up against the U.S.F.
! Frosh.
j According to Mentor Gorter, Lyon
j will not play Wednesday, and La
i faille has only a bare chance of feel
! ing the hardwood under his feet.
