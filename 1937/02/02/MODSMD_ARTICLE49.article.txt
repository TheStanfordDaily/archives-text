TREATISE ON WHY
STANFORD LOST ONE
Carelessness, a slight relaxation of
fighting spirit that was evident in the
failure to capture rebounds, and
probably a nervous reaction which
came from knowing that Turner
wouldn't be around were three large
reasons that the Indians lost their
lirst game of the season to U.S.C. Fri
day night.
Coupled with that was the fact that
the Trojans were admittedly playing
way over their heads in comparison
to previous efforts this season—Bar
ry's team had a hot night and Bunn's
men were just a little salty. That
doesn't mean that any of the glory
should be taken away from Troy, for
winning over a team that wasn't at its
best, because there's no arguing
away the fact that Barry consistently
puts out a fundamentally sound
team and that this year is no ex
ception.
Somehow, the knowledge that
Handsome Howie would be absent
from the squad for the two games
had a harmful psychology for the
lirst battle. This is the first game he
has failed to start in, or at least be
ready for, since he came to Stanford.
All through his freshman year and
two seasons of varsity competition he
was always in shape, and was in fine
fettle this year until late in the Cal
game.
When the men have worked as a
unit so steadily as have these five,
Luisetti, Calderwood, Stoefen, Moore,
and Turner, it hurts a little to have
one of the most dependable incapaci
tated.
BUNN FINDS
A NEW COMBINATION
Incidentally, the absence of Turner
forced Coach Bunn to find a new
combination for the time being, and
find it he did. The first game was in
part an experiment for just that pur
pose, but when he found it he started
it in the second game, and it worked
like a charm. With the new arrange
ment, Captain Moore goes to forward
for Turner and Beebs Lee comes in
for Dinty's guard r.pot. The move
was dynamite Saturday night, wit
ness the 25-point lead with the game
seven-eighths gone.
The Trojans were fighting like
fools in the Friday night game, and
I succeeded in taking rebounds con

stantly that in most cases would have j
been Stanford's. They played heads j
up ball all the way, were just a little |
better than Stanford in the final
drive. The Cards led most of the way
at that, and were ahead four points
with very little time left, Bunn told
Lee to play the game safely, the old
keep-away system, but apparently
the orders didn't take effect. The
team was too anxious, fouled a little
too much, and as a result lost the
game.
HANK WAS REALLY
TOO MUCH FOR ORAM
The second evening Barry had four
different men Irying to stop Hank
Luisetti, shifting from Oram to
Dornsife to Garrison to Ruh, but the
dark-haired ash was too much for
any one of them—or even any two
of them. Oram, a close friend of
Dinty Moore, had all his poise ragged
out of him by the Irish throughout
the game. Dinty kept calling him
"Pretty Boy," which had Captain Ed
die in blushes and confusion, and
then he kidded him incessantly on
the fact that Luisetti was running up
a large total. That didn't help Oram
much, either.
Speaking of point totals, that five
game, 21-point average of Luisetti's
is remarkable. In fact, it's colossal.
When a player can keep on scoring
so fast in spite of the fact that every
team he plays against him is all hop
ped up to stop him above all others,
he deserves a few orchids.
HOW DO YOU DO IT,
MR. COIIN?
The astute Mr. Cohn of the Oak
land Tribune is pretty generally dis
liked all over, even now at St. Mary's,
since he made the crack in his sports
column last week that the school
owes Madigan $22,000 in back sala
ries. The St. Mary's Collegian, school
publication, denied it, condemned
Cohn for making the remark, and so
Cohn is a little more unpopular. That
gentleman certainly has a faculty for
making himself disliked.

pose, but when he found it he started
it in the second game, and it worked
like a charm. With the new arrange
ment, Captain Moore goes to forward
for Turner and Beebs Lee comes in
for Dinty's guard r.pot. The move
was dynamite Saturday night, wit
ness the 25-point lead with the game
seven-eighths gone.
The Trojans were fighting like
fools in the Friday night game, and
I succeeded in taking rebounds con

stantly that in most cases would have j
been Stanford's. They played heads j
up ball all the way, were just a little |
better than Stanford in the final
drive. The Cards led most of the way
at that, and were ahead four points
with very little time left, Bunn told
Lee to play the game safely, the old
keep-away system, but apparently
the orders didn't take effect. The
team was too anxious, fouled a little
too much, and as a result lost the
game.
HANK WAS REALLY
TOO MUCH FOR ORAM
The second evening Barry had four
different men Irying to stop Hank
Luisetti, shifting from Oram to
Dornsife to Garrison to Ruh, but the
dark-haired ash was too much for
any one of them—or even any two
of them. Oram, a close friend of
Dinty Moore, had all his poise ragged
out of him by the Irish throughout
the game. Dinty kept calling him
"Pretty Boy," which had Captain Ed
die in blushes and confusion, and
then he kidded him incessantly on
the fact that Luisetti was running up
a large total. That didn't help Oram
much, either.
Speaking of point totals, that five
game, 21-point average of Luisetti's
is remarkable. In fact, it's colossal.
When a player can keep on scoring
so fast in spite of the fact that every
team he plays against him is all hop
ped up to stop him above all others,
he deserves a few orchids.
HOW DO YOU DO IT,
MR. COIIN?
The astute Mr. Cohn of the Oak
land Tribune is pretty generally dis
liked all over, even now at St. Mary's,
since he made the crack in his sports
column last week that the school
owes Madigan $22,000 in back sala
ries. The St. Mary's Collegian, school
publication, denied it, condemned
Cohn for making the remark, and so
Cohn is a little more unpopular. That
gentleman certainly has a faculty for
making himself disliked.

TREATISE ON WHY
STANFORD LOST ONE
Carelessness, a slight relaxation of
fighting spirit that was evident in the
failure to capture rebounds, and
probably a nervous reaction which
came from knowing that Turner
wouldn't be around were three large
reasons that the Indians lost their
lirst game of the season to U.S.C. Fri
day night.
Coupled with that was the fact that
the Trojans were admittedly playing
way over their heads in comparison
to previous efforts this season—Bar
ry's team had a hot night and Bunn's
men were just a little salty. That
doesn't mean that any of the glory
should be taken away from Troy, for
winning over a team that wasn't at its
best, because there's no arguing
away the fact that Barry consistently
puts out a fundamentally sound
team and that this year is no ex
ception.
Somehow, the knowledge that
Handsome Howie would be absent
from the squad for the two games
had a harmful psychology for the
lirst battle. This is the first game he
has failed to start in, or at least be
ready for, since he came to Stanford.
All through his freshman year and
two seasons of varsity competition he
was always in shape, and was in fine
fettle this year until late in the Cal
game.
When the men have worked as a
unit so steadily as have these five,
Luisetti, Calderwood, Stoefen, Moore,
and Turner, it hurts a little to have
one of the most dependable incapaci
tated.

When a player can keep on scoring
so fast in spite of the fact that every
team he plays against him is all hop
ped up to stop him above all others,
he deserves a few orchids.
HOW DO YOU DO IT,
MR. COIIN?
The astute Mr. Cohn of the Oak
land Tribune is pretty generally dis
liked all over, even now at St. Mary's,
since he made the crack in his sports
column last week that the school
owes Madigan $22,000 in back sala
ries. The St. Mary's Collegian, school
publication, denied it, condemned
Cohn for making the remark, and so
Cohn is a little more unpopular. That
gentleman certainly has a faculty for
making himself disliked.
