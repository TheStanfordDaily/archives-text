# No Epidemic, To Be Accurate
## 
### 
THE trouble with Dr. Storey isn't a desire to
keep public facts from the public. It's simply
that he answers calls from The Daily not wisely
but too well.
For what appeared to us to be a flu epidemic
really wasn't a flu epidemic from a doctor's
viewpoint.
In round numbers, only 40 to 50 Stanfordites
were ill v/ith flu at the height of the late hospital
open-house two weeks ago. And when The
Daily called about the "flu epidemic," they re
ceived just those figures.
But because those figures didn't jibe with the
number of people with what we inaccurately
called "flu" we all figured the doctor was at
tempting to keep public facts from the public.
The confusion is not the result of the doctor's
accuracy, but our inaccuracy.
For we tended to believe the number of spe
cific flu cases included pneumonia, coughs,
colds and sore throats, which is not so, accu
rately.
And we further tended to include in our in
dividual sick list those either sneezing their
way into a flu attack or coughing their way out
of one—inaccurately.
Which brings up not only the question of bad
reporting on our part, but of bad reporteeing on
Dr. Storey's part.
For it is manifestly impossible to ask a jour
nalism student to really explore the question of
flu and get his story right. And it is even more
impossible to ask the reader not to form certain
suspicions when the facts, as reported by the
paper, don't jibe with the facts reported by his
ears and eyes as inaccurately interpreted by
his brain.
So it's up to Dr. Storey to be sure that the
reporter understands what he means by "flu"
—that the disease is a specific one, and different
in medical characteristics from such closely as
sociated complaints as a cold and a sore throat
and pneumonia.
For Stanford did not have a flu epidemic. It
did have an epidemic of colds, sore throats, and
upper respiratory infections, to be accurate.

Nature isn't wonderful. If she gives a man
ability to be a big shot, she seldom goes to
the trouble of making him look like one.
