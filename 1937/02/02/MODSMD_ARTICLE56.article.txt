BURIED under drama books and play sce
narios in room 203c every morning, har
ried by amateur actors and inexpert student di
rectors in the Assembly Hall every afternoon is
Gordon C. Lange, the young dramatic instructor
whom the University imported from Scripps
last fall. It is he who will, if anybody will, get
the personnel of Stanford's dramatic depart
ment ready to occupy the technically perfect
Memorial Theater when it opens next spring.
A favorite term of social scientists is "cultural
lag," a state of society in which intellectual
progress falls behind technical progress. Such
is, in effect, the state of the New Theater. As
far as staging, lighting, and seating facilities
are concerned, the theater is perfect. But an
empty building, needless to say, is just an
empty building. Without a dramatic set-up to
utilize it to its limits, the New Theater is little
better than the old Assembly Hall.
Gordon Lange, a youngster compared to the
majority of the University's principal faculty
members, realizes this deficiency in present
New Theater plans. Two weeks ago he outlined
in The Daily a plan for a school of drama which
would put Stanford in the West where Yale is
in the East —the tops for dramatic training. He
advised complete reorganization of Stanford's
limited drama arrangement, now a parasite on
the English and Public Speaking departments.
Lange's unguenchable enthusiasm over the
Farm's dramatic chancos is not his only virtuo.

He is experienced far beyond most men of hi 3
age. His academic training, at the best schools
in the East, is tempered by actual experience
with professional stock companies and with
teaching problems at Colgate and Scripps.
Lange is "young blood"—the type of man for
ward-looking universities, especially in the
East, are constantly adding to their staffs.
Gordon Lange is important to Stanford Uni
versity for two reasons: He will hammer away
at the Administration until he can transfer his
troupe to the New Theater with a satisfaction
that Stanford has an adequate School of Drama.
He will prove to the oldsters that nothing will
do as much to bolster a crop of academic old
sters as the addition, now and then, of compe
tent youngsters.

Gordon Lange is important to Stanford Uni
versity for two reasons: He will hammer away
at the Administration until he can transfer his
troupe to the New Theater with a satisfaction
that Stanford has an adequate School of Drama.
He will prove to the oldsters that nothing will
do as much to bolster a crop of academic old
sters as the addition, now and then, of compe
tent youngsters.
A Tennessee woman, 80 years old, has
never seen an automobile. Which may be
the reason she is 80 years old.

BURIED under drama books and play sce
narios in room 203c every morning, har
ried by amateur actors and inexpert student di
rectors in the Assembly Hall every afternoon is
Gordon C. Lange, the young dramatic instructor
whom the University imported from Scripps
last fall. It is he who will, if anybody will, get
the personnel of Stanford's dramatic depart
ment ready to occupy the technically perfect
Memorial Theater when it opens next spring.
A favorite term of social scientists is "cultural
lag," a state of society in which intellectual
progress falls behind technical progress. Such
is, in effect, the state of the New Theater. As
far as staging, lighting, and seating facilities
are concerned, the theater is perfect. But an
empty building, needless to say, is just an
empty building. Without a dramatic set-up to
utilize it to its limits, the New Theater is little
better than the old Assembly Hall.
Gordon Lange, a youngster compared to the
majority of the University's principal faculty
members, realizes this deficiency in present
New Theater plans. Two weeks ago he outlined
in The Daily a plan for a school of drama which
would put Stanford in the West where Yale is
in the East —the tops for dramatic training. He
advised complete reorganization of Stanford's
limited drama arrangement, now a parasite on
the English and Public Speaking departments.
Lange's unguenchable enthusiasm over the
Farm's dramatic chancos is not his only virtuo.

He is experienced far beyond most men of hi 3
age. His academic training, at the best schools
in the East, is tempered by actual experience
with professional stock companies and with
teaching problems at Colgate and Scripps.
Lange is "young blood"—the type of man for
ward-looking universities, especially in the
East, are constantly adding to their staffs.
