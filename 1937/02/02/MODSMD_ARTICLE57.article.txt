# OUR HASHER

'THVO dear old ladies walked into the Pavilion last
Thursday night while the Kappa Alpha-Theta Chi
intramural basketball game was in progress. They
wanted to see RachmaninofT play. "Sorry, ladies," said
the nice man at the door, "he doesn't play on our team."
Proof of the innate animal cunning extant in all
hashers, and particularly in those gods among men, the
head hashers, was given the other day by the dominant
primordial brute at the Chi O house.
The bruiser, it seems, got a crush on one of the gals
in the house. But one night they were out booming
together, tossing down a side order of the 50-cent lunge,
and neglected to return for the 2:30 lock-out.
So on the night that the gal had to stay in, the
hashman sneaked into the house's downstairs telephone
booth, called up his late friend, and talked for an hour
or two.
