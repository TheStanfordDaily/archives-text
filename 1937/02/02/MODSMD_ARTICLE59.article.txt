'T'HERE is a drama, "Forbidden Adventure," playing
currently in San Francisco. The advertising of this
attraction leaves no doubt as to its subject matter.
And if "Smashing the Vice Trust," at another theater
is what it purports to be, then there are two shows
in San Francisco which the newspapers would call
sexational. s
The word educational has been applied to several
affairs on the order of these two shows, but I will
get into that in a minute. What I should do here is
explain to my parents that junior saw his second and
last lurid movie some time ago and is qualifying as an
expert on the subject only to warn those who might
wonder about these shows.

I remember some time ago the California Pelican,
Chaparral's distinguished contemporary, sent for some
"real hot sketches" as advertised in Police Gazette and
got for 10 cents some pictures of 1905 bathing beauties
dressed in outfits which ran from chin to ankle—very
nifty in every respect even down to the pocket for
your lunch.
The hoax I went to see with a couple of fraternity
brothers panned out in the same manner. It was edu
cational, no doubt, but the educational value of the
performance was mainly along the lines of letting you
get a good look at what kind of people make up the
sap class.
There were a few 14-year-old kids in the back row
learning how to smoke, and a few scattered sailors, but
mostly stenographers drinking it in with the utmost
absorption. And ourselves.

What there was to drink in was scorching stuff in
deed. The drama started with a beer-hall scene, show
ing young people dancing a dance Southern Califor
nians know as the Balboa. At this point the drug
peddler entered and whisked them all away to his
bcach chalet. Here ensued the much-advertised bathing
party, in which the audience saw about half a mile
down the beach on a dark night to where some indis
tinguishable figures splashed about in the surf. After
this, of course, the heroine went into the dope-peddling
business, and following some cop-and-robber stuff,
she killed herself.

By this time the three of us had fallen off our seats
from laughing too much. We hoisted ourselves up and
stuffed handkerchiefs in our mouths just in time to hear
the lady doctor who was going to complete our educa
tion. She talked like this: bwoop, gwoop, bwoo-00-oop,
bwoop, bwo. If somebody interrupted her, she'd have
lost her place and have had to go back to the beginning.
That would have been pretty tough on Ihe audience,
for her talk was a build-up for her book "giving full
details for only one dollar." We got up and went out,
evidently to the relief of the kids and stenographers
who were pretty much annoyed by the way we had
snorted at the facts of life.

Not that what I say is going to shrivel the success
of "Forbidden Adventure." I may even have vicariously
boosted the show. San Francisco has witnessed a deluge
of such businesses, in which, as Ted Cook says, there is
red sin in the title and pink romance in the text.
But San Francisco and the peninsula are only so big
and contain just so many people, and if the next thou
sand "Marihuanas" and "Forbidden Adventures" draw
off the same sucker crop, it will make a liar out of
Barnum.
The slickers don't make money as a result of the
ever-increasing supply of new suckers- it's the repeat
business the old suckers rivo them that counts.
