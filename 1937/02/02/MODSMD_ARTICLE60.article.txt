ten cents you can buy "Dip
py Detective" or some such mys
tery thriller; another jitney gets you
several pages of he-she jokes and
some recent slang. It costs 40 cents to
go to the Stanford Theater.
That makes the marginal utility of
"After the Thin Man" with
Loy and Bill Powell exactly two-bits.

What you're pay
ing for includes
antics by Asta, a
lovable wire-hair
ed terrier (the
kind of beast the
audience goes 'ah'
for), a few min-

utes of that pop-eyed fellow who was
in "Three Men on a Horse," three
murders with an adequate supply of
false suspects, about five feet seven
of Myrna Loy, eye-brow acrobatics
and sleuthing by Powell, a goodly
supply of the horrid old aunt, and a
pseudo - psychologist who tries to
make everyone out as insane.
However, if you don't have an
econ report to turn in the next day,
"Alter the Thin Man" should prove
top-notch entertainment. These days,
it isn't material, but touch that makes
a movie, and this flicker has what
made "The Thin Man," its predeces
sor, and "It Happened One Night,"
and beaucoup other definitely excel
lent films—good direction, good act
ing, and that flippant, sophisticated
touch.
Besides, there's another feature,
"King of Hockey," in which you
know the characters' lines seconds
before they utter them. With some
changes in title and in the sports se
quences, this might just as well have
been "King of Football," "King of
Baseball," "King of Cribbage,' etc.
