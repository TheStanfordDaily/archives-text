# BALLET RUSSE
## 
### 
It is a fetish of mine that art
ought to mean something; that "art
for arts sake" is a pretty poor and
outworn concept. Perhaps that's the
reason I wasn't overenthusiastic
about the Saturday afternoon per
formance of Colonel W. de Basil's
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.

Not that it didn't have its excellent
points. The first ballet, "Lac Des

Cygnes," was all
that I have always
supposed ballet to
be: a magic fusion
of sight and sound
and motion into
something super
humanly graceful.

Alexandra Danilova more than did
justice to the part of the Queen; the
four Little Swans were amusing. As
a spectacle it was all one could
wish.
"Petrouchka," however, proved
disappointing. Motions of the chief
figures, with the exception of David
Lichine, were jerky and uneven. It
is true that the story required it; and
I would not have disliked it were it
not for the fact that this mechanical
technique had a strong tendency to
creep into "Las Des Cygnes" and
"Prince Igor" as well, detracting from
the smoothly rythmic effect they
were trying to create.
'"Prince Igor," last piece of the
afternoon, mainly because it was
purely and simply a vehicle for Dav
id Lichine, was much more enter
taining. It would not surprise me
very much if young Mr. Lichine, who
brings to his characterizations a psy
chological reality that belongs more
to drama than dance, were some day
to be more than a little famous.
Each of the three ballets suffered
from lack of point. I thought "Pe
trouchka" would be different, since

the story of the tragic dancing doll
who has a soul seemed made for
pantomime; and in the title-role was
the maitre-de-ballet, world-famed
Leonide Massine.
But it all fizzled out, somehow. The
cx*owd was amusing, the costumes
were brilliant, the scene between the
Blackamoor and the Dancer were
funny, Pieri'e Monteux conducted—
but the centx-al theme disappeax - ed
somewhere along about the third
time Massine tried to knock the door
down with his head.

On the whole, I came away feeling
as though I had seen a mechanically
perfect toy: interesting to watch, but
totally devoid of meaning.
