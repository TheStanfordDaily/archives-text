The Editor, Sir:
In the present controversy regard
ing the janitors, the respective views
of the American Building Mainte
nance Company and of the Janitors'
Union have been repeatedly pre
sented. There is, however, another
and basically more important party
to the dispute whose interests, so far
have been more or less ignored. It is,
after all, the student resident in t*he
halls whose necessities and con
venience give the janitors their jobs,
and the company their presumably
profitable contract.
This being so, it becomes appx'o
priate to enquire whether the jani
tors and the company, disregarding
their internal diffex*ences, have to
gether been fui'nishing adequate
service to the doi-mitories. We think
that it would be generally agreed
that they have not.
With some exceptions, the average
janitor-made bed is not up to a fair
housewife standardâ€”let alone a hotel
or Pullman car standard. Dust col-

lects under beds until it accumulates
in long rolls. Wash basins are not
cleaned for days at a time.
Whether these conditions are due
to slackness and inefficiency of the
janitors, or whether, as the janitors
claim, they are the company's fault,
in that each janitor is given more
rooms than he can properly take
care of, we do not know.
We do, however, know that proper
investigation would allocate the
blame and determine who is respon
sible for the faulty service now ren
dered by the janitors. Further, re
sponsibility being determined, we
see no reason why student protests
could not and should not enforce an
improvement in janitorial service.
Yours very truly,
Richard Behrens Eaton
