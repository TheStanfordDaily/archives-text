# WHY TELL US?

The Editor, Sir:
So Palo Alto celebrated the be
loved President's Birthday—and so
enthusiastically! A pathetic support
for the fight against polio—a crowd
smaller than one finds in church the
morning after the night before, and
bored, for obvious reasons.
Evidently the management thought
the hoi polloi would be so jubilant
over commemorating the natal day of
F.D.R. that they wouldn't know nor
care that the News Reel and the Dog
Show, theoretically subordinate fea
tures, were the only relatively high
points of the whole evening.
If one hadn't already seen "The
Three Little Pigs" three or four
times, this feature might have been
at least ail opportunity for a
chuckle.
To begin with, the poor orchestra
(?) in contrast to the syncopated
rhythm which it followed reminded
one of the Salvation Army on Fill
more and Sacramento at Christmas
time. Although Roosevelt favors
"Home on the Range," I doubt if he
would have selected this little gem.
The young baritone they say has a
really nice voice, but I wouldn't
know. I couldn't hear him for the
orchestra, and he couldn't hear the
orchestra.
They really should get together
some time. The boy with the accor
dion, and the fellow "at the end of
the clarinet" were typically of the
Major Bowes program. The Christ
mas tree with the St. Vitus Dance ac
companied by a nauseated piano was
amusing to say the least. The ex
cruciating interlude concluded with
the audience standing on one foot
while an oversize soprano waving
her arms in the breeze hit the high
notes of "the rockets' red glare."
As one benign old citizen said in a
patronizing manner, "Oh, well." Oh,
well, is right.. One must give credit
where credit is due because the idea
was fine, if only it. had been carried
out (outside in this particular case).
We appreciate their not having their
celebration conflict with our party
party-party, but I wouldn't bother
about it next year. Why not give 50
cents to stay home for a change? It
would be worth it.
