# Typical Talkies Shown in Last Movie Session
## 
### 
Last important development in the
cinema—the talking picture—was il
lustrated to Motion Picture students
by four representative sound films in
the Assembly Hall last night.

First, in point of time, was a 1927
newsreel interview with George
Bernard Shaw, the cantankerous
British dramatist. More unusual
than the fact that he actually talked
was his compaartive civility. Not one
nasty remark did he utter. He even
went to some length to show, with his
own remarkable eyebrows ,that
"Mussolini's fierce eyebrows are an
injustice to his kindly character."

Two sound sequences from "The
Jazz Singer," first full-length feature
with speech from the characters, ex
hibited A1 Jolson singing "Blue
Skies" and "Mammy." The first had
to be run through twice because the
first time Instructor Mendelowitz
tripped over an extension cord, dis
connecting the sound track. Audience
observation: Jolson since 1927 has
mellowed in looks, not in voice.
Micky Mouse, in "Steamboat Wil
lie" (1928), was smaller, less cocky
and puritanical than he is today. His
character had not yet developed into
that of the "ideal American mouse."
Principal feature of the evening
was "All Quiet on the Western
Front" which Carl Laemmle pro
duced in 1930 as a "war against war."
Shown last night not as peace propa
ganda but as an example of the
sound film's coming-of-age, "ALI
Quiet" served both purposes. Be
sides showing the audience an ugly,
starkly realistic side of war, it illus
trated how Hollywood by 1930 was
getting over sound's first self-con
sciousness, how producers were
adapting sound to the advanced
camera technique of silent pictures.
