## A 						WAR FOR PEACE, WITH A BIG GUN, WITHOUT BULLETS

r rHE world's greatest idealist was
at the world's most contented
university yesterday. He is Senor S.
De Madariaga, ambassador without
portfolio for a nation as yet unborn.
He represents the United States of
the World, which he declares will
some day include all peoples, and
whose essential" unity today is im
paired only by diverse political and
economic aims.
His is the aquiline face of the con
noisseur of great ideas. No man
could-have walked the slack-wire of
argument more surely than did he
last night, for he stopped even Stan
ford professors with his twirling
parasol of rhetoric, and even while
they were sitting in Administrative
Grace at Dr. Wilbur's home.

jJT WAS a plenary session of a
grand jury such as no suspect had
ever faced. For Dr. De Madariaga
had to cross swords with more than
two dozen expert academic fencers,
alert despite the hangovers of pro
fessorship.
If a smile touched their lips now
and then, no one could blame them,
for Senor De Madariaga proposed no
less than World Unity, despite Mach
iavelli, Grotius, and all the epical
sourpusses of history.
He is frankly, a salesman. Already
Mussolini and Hitler have implied
"they're not in" when Senor De
Madariaga comes to peddle his
wares. Perhaps President Roosevelt
will be out. to lunch as well.
But we're glad Dr. Wilbur was in.
He gave us a chance to see the Last
of the Titans, a man who is still
willing, in 1937, to give his whole life
to an idea.
We looked at him carefully and
we're still confused. For there's
more idealism in the man, we be
lieve, than in even his United States
of the World.

perfect place for Senor De
Madariaga to go, a place that
needs Uniting like nobody's business,
is the Hood country, particularly that
part of it near Cairo, unflooded at
this writing.
There, while army engineers hag
gle hopelessly with the big-wigs of
one town for agreement as to. the
breaking of a levee to reduce pres
sure further down the line, towns
people from other places are equally
adamant in their refusal to allow
their town to be flooded.
A totalitarian sta'.e is definitely |
needed, well united- so the sections ]
are without individual power, and so j
somebody who knows something |
about floods can break the levee at
the scientifically correct point.

Wc should like to see a scientist do
it, working under orders from a
Democratic world government. But,
damn it, autocrats like Mussolini or
Hitler could do it just as scientific
ally, without uniting anybody or
anything, but just by making up
their individual dictatorial minds.
