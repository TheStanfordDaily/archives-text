# Carnival Passes to Masque Ball; From 'Pure' to 'Feelthy Lucre'

(This is (he second of a series of
articles tracing the history of the
Masque Ball.—The Editor).
The past history of the battle royal
gave no indication of anything to
disturb the outward calm of the con
test, save for occasional editorials in
the "Daily Palo Alto" the morning
after the ball, taking the men to task
for being very discourteous to the
Queen.
Genesis of the contest seems to
have occurred soon after the war,
when a King and Queen were
wanted for the spring Student Body
Carnival, held on Lagunita. Feelthy
lucre did not enter into the contest,
though, since ballots were printed in
The Daily. The Carnival was a two
day affair.
In 1921 ballots were printed again
in The Daily. "Young Ted Lewis
and his syncopators to the amount of
six," played for the Spanish Carni
val that wound up the two days of
excitement.
In 1922 the name of the ball was
changed to "Vanity Fair," nomination
blanks were printed in The Daily;
but votes became 10 cents apiece for
the first time. Imogen Aten was* one
of the contestants.
In 1923, the king and queen were
crowned by Dr. Wilbur himself. The
name was changed to The Carnival
Masque, and Pat he News ground out
the setting for the newsreels. The
contest this year was sponsored by
Women's "S" Society and Skull and
Snakes, ballots were again free, in

dicating that the University officials
already had edged into the arena.
In 1924 the one-cent a vote plan
prevailed. And the name of the fete
finally settled on "Masque Ball,"
which it has retained since.
During this period of the con

test, ending in 1925, whatever money j
was taken in seemed to disappear'
quietly into the proceeds of the
dance. It was not until the old corpse j
was revived that the the contest was
sanctimoniously clothed will) char- j
itable purposes.


lIAULE GARTH and JACK IVEY rode a borrowed Al G. Barnes
elephant up the Row last year, still failed to win. A certain Mr. London
who tried to ride an elephant to Washington lat« r in the year also
failed.
