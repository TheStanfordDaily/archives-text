# Ex Committee Delays Action On Queen Race
## Election Polling Divided Into Three Precincts; Wrestling Is Deferred 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The Cardinals-Women's Confer
ence "royalty" controversy was no
nearer solution last night when Ex
Committee adjourned than when its
weekly sesion began 50 minutes be
fore.
President Reynolds referred the
question—whether Stanford should
have a King-Queen contest in con
nection with the Masque Ball this
spring—to a subcommittee "to in
vestigate." Chick Franich will rep
resent the "for" faction, Esther Pel
ton the "against" faction, and Fred
| Williams will try to compromise the
two.
Cardinals' Plan Dinged
Ex Committee in effect dinged
j Cardinals' previous proposal when it
j refused to ratify the organization's
| minutes containing the King-Queen
j proposal.
Barbara Kimball. Women's Con
j ference president with whom Fra
i nich, Cardinals' president, has been
j arguing all week, asked him why a
j King-Queen contest was necessary.
"Because it's a fine, old tradition,"
jhe answered. "I think the pride of
| the Stanford woman is hitting a new
j low when she can't enter a popu
i larity contest for charity."
Why Not Charity Raffle?
Meanwhile, when Miss Kimball
I suggested a floor show to draw
! Masque Bailers instead of the con
j test, Joe Burris declared that as long
las a substitute seemed imperative,
i why not find something that would
! raise needed Convalescent Home
j funds—a charity raffle, for instance.
I It was all left until next week.
ELECTIONS — Three separate
j polling places for next week's voting
| were established after a technical
| by-law change. Encina, Toyon,
j Branner, and independent residents
| will vote on the Law Steps—Roble,
| Lagunita, and Sequoia at the Geol
ogy corner—Row and Union Units
at (he Engineering corner.
WRESTLING was not made a mi
nor sport, despite the B.A.C.'s an
nouncement that Ex Committee
could decide the manner itself. A
I fortnight ago the Committee had
j recommended the action to the
B.A.C. It was felt details out lining
match schedules and award re
quirements should be arranged be
fore final decision. Roy Thompson
; and Fred Williams were appointed
I to do this before next week's meet
j hig.
NITERY was postponed again be-
I cause cost estimates were not at
| hsnd. "Don't worry about this ni-
I tery," .said Reynolds. "We are try
j 'ng to get a definite estimate before
I going ahead."
