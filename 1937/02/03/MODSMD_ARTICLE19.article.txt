# Men Must Have 'C' In Bawlout To Move to Row
## New Rule Affects Nearly 10 Per Cent of Pledges Says Council President 
### 
Forty or 50 pledges will not move
into their houses next fall!
Freshman pledges and new sopho
mox-es must have a "C" average dur
ing their freshman year or a "C" av
erage the quarter previous in order
to move into the ; r fraternity houses,
according to a new ruling made ef
fective last night by the Interfrater
nity Board of Control.
The ruling was first suggested to
the Interfraternity Council by A1
Dibblee, interfraternity secretary
treasurer, who went east last year
to a meeting of all the national fra
ternities in the place of Bob Hoover,
who was ill. He found that it was
the best suggestion applicable to
Stanford to improve conditions here.
The resolution, made in accordance
with a desire expressed by the Inter
fraternity Council last week, will be
come effective'with the 1937 pledge
class. It will probably affect from 5
to 10 per cent of the Row-bound
men, or about 50 of this year's pledge
class of nearly 650.
"Fraternities have been materially
below the University average dur
ing the past few years," said Bob
Hoover, president of the Interfrater
nity Board. '"The Interfraternity
Council and the Interfraternity
Board of Control feel that this action
will go a long way toward improv
ing scholarship. The resolution was
passed to encourage freshman mov
ing into houses to maintain a high
grade average."
