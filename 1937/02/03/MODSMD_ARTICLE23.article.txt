# Eating Clubs Founded to Secure Good Food for Hungry Hall Men
## Club Brethren Gather Around Festive Board Early Conditions at Farm Give Rise to Groups 
### HUNTER HENDEE 
To hall men seven organizations
offer companionship along with food
three times a day.
Collectively these groups are called
eating clubs, but specifically they're
known as Breakers, El Campo, El
Toro—the strictly independents; and
Los Arcos, El Capitan, El Cuadro, El
Tigre —serving meals from the kitch
ens of the Commons.
No Bad Feeding
Contrary to general belief, their
origin was not the x-esult of antip
athy against the fraternity system on
the part of certain administrative
big-wigs and distinguished alumni.
Ilather the incentive was more prim
itive —it was the urge to eat. For
food was a serious problem in the
earlier days of the institution.
In the beginning men and women,
students and faculty were fed in
what is now Encina lobby. But diffi
culties were many, and when even
efforts of famous restaurateur John
Tate failed .University-operated din
ing halls were given up as a bad job.
Private Concerns
But students had to be fed as well
as educated, and so concessions were
granted private concerns for dining
halls in Roble, Sequoia, Madrono,
and "The Inn" (R.O.T.C. barracks).
One by one these fell into hands of
a Japanese outfit which served food
surprisingly bad. Three times a day,
thereafter, males migrated down a
mile of dusty road, to boarding
houses at College Terrace.
By 1909 there had emerged out of
these pilgrimages four groups, each
with its own dining hall, its own
cook. Earliest was the Coyote Club
which tamed into Breakers when it
moved to the campus.
Roth Gives Aid
Student demand for campus eat
ing houses (championed by Student
prexy Almon E. Roth) moved Alum
ni Association in 1911 to propose the
Administration's financing club
buildings for the College Terrace
Wary of directing any more dining
halls, Board of Trustees refused.
Whereupon three of its members,
Good Samaritans Newton Cleave
land, George Crothers, and Dennis
Searles stepped forth with $9000
worth of loan. Associated Students
came through with another thousand.
Provision of the loans stipulated
that after the principle had been paid
back by rents collected from the

clubs, the buildings would automat
ically become University property. 1
That is why today the clubs still pay
rent to the Administration even
though the last of the original loans
was paid in 1930.

PRESIDENTS of the Farm's traditional eating clubs are shown in
the upper picture. Left to right standing: Chick Franich. El Toro;
Burt Goodman, El Capitan; Will Winder, El Cuadro; Stan Zimet, EI
Campo. Sitting: Perry Moerdyke, El Tigre; John Sumner, Los Arcos,'
Ralph Quails, Breakers. Below some of the Los Arcos members look
over a Daily.
To hall men seven organizations
offer companionship along with food
three times a day.
Collectively these groups are called
eating clubs, but specifically they're
known as Breakers, El Campo, El
Toro—the strictly independents; and
Los Arcos, El Capitan, El Cuadro, El
Tigre —serving meals from the kitch
ens of the Commons.
No Bad Feeding
Contrary to general belief, their
origin was not the x-esult of antip
athy against the fraternity system on
the part of certain administrative
big-wigs and distinguished alumni.
Ilather the incentive was more prim
itive —it was the urge to eat. For
food was a serious problem in the
earlier days of the institution.
In the beginning men and women,
students and faculty were fed in
what is now Encina lobby. But diffi
culties were many, and when even
efforts of famous restaurateur John
Tate failed .University-operated din
ing halls were given up as a bad job.
Private Concerns
But students had to be fed as well
as educated, and so concessions were
granted private concerns for dining
halls in Roble, Sequoia, Madrono,
and "The Inn" (R.O.T.C. barracks).
One by one these fell into hands of
a Japanese outfit which served food
surprisingly bad. Three times a day,
thereafter, males migrated down a
mile of dusty road, to boarding
houses at College Terrace.
By 1909 there had emerged out of
these pilgrimages four groups, each
with its own dining hall, its own
cook. Earliest was the Coyote Club
which tamed into Breakers when it
moved to the campus.
Roth Gives Aid
Student demand for campus eat
ing houses (championed by Student
prexy Almon E. Roth) moved Alum
ni Association in 1911 to propose the
Administration's financing club
buildings for the College Terrace
Wary of directing any more dining
halls, Board of Trustees refused.
