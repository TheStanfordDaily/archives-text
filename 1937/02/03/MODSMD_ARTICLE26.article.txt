# III NYA Workers Asked To Report
## 
### 
All NYA undergraduate students
who are in the hospital or the rest
home are requested to see that the
| Student Employment Office knows of
! their illness. Miss Vivian Fay, official
j University nurse, will carry a supply
|of National Youth Administration
J time cards on her daily rounds.
Workers who have not done so
| should fill out their cards and have
i them returned to the office by Miss
Fay. At present there are over 40
I unsigned cards; the only excuse for
this situation is the inability of the
, student to report.
