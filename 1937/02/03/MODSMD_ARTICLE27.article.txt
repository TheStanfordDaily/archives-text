# Boxer Revolt Explained By Chinese Savant
## Uprising Marked End Of Conservatism In China, Professor Says 
### 
Condemning every aspect of West
ern civilization from kissing to bat
tleships, Chinese conservatives be
fore the Boxer rebellion molded
oublic opinion into extremely anti
foreign channels, declared Dr. Chen
"Shou Yi, head of the Department of
History at the National University at
Peking, China, who spoke in the Lit
tle Theater last night on "Intellectual
Conservatism in China Before the
Boxer Rebellion."
There have always been two opin
ions among leaders in China: one
was that of a small open-minded
group who advocated the study and
adoption of Western methods; the
other was that of those who antici
pated and sympathized with the
Boxers.
Until the rebellion the so-called
conservatives gradually spread the
theory that Western methods and
civilisation were inferior to those of
China. They objected to both the
material and spiritual aspects of the
West; they even went so far as to
predict the eventual spread and
adoption of Chinese civilization
throughout the world. In conclusion,
Dr. Chen said, "Today China is
clamoring for modernization. Con
servatism is destined to pass into the
realm of history."
