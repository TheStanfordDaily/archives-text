others. Volunteers should contact Sis
Coonley as soon as possible.
A featured attraction will be a
fashion show, in which leading San

booths will be set up, and an organ
grinder with a monkey will be pres

A flunking fine for failing students

been instituted as an experiment to
lift student grades, not to enrich
the school.
