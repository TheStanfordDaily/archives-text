# Sit Down Strikers Get Court Ouster
## Men Wait in Factories As Lewis Speeds Toward Michigan; Deadline 3 
### 
FLINT, Mich., Feb. 2 (UP).â€”Sit
down strikers, under court order to
evacuate two Fisher Body plants by
3 p.m. tomorrow, held their posts to
night and awaited orders from un
ion leaders.
Officials of the United Automobile
Workers of America sped to union
headquarters in Detroit for a night
session of their "board of strategy."
They were to decide whether to
obey the order of Circuit Judge Paul
V. Gadola, appeal to the Supreme
Court of Michigan, or defy Sheriff
Thomas W. Wolcott of Flint to en
force the injunction with the aid of
National Guard troops.
Men Silent
Flanked by his guards, Sheriff
Wolcott took a broad stance in front
of the doov and began reading in a
monotone the long injunction which
orders the men to leave the plant by
3 p.m. tomorrow or face contempt of
court charges. They have held the
factory since December 30.
After reading the order, the sheriff
and his aides departed for Fisher
Plant No. 4 on the other side of
town to repeat the procedure to sit
downers in that factory.
William S. Knudsen, executive
vice-president of General Motors
Corporation, said at Detroit that ne
gotiations for settlement of the strike
would begin as soon as "sit-down"
strikers leave the plants.
Lewis on Way
John L. Lewis, chairman of the
Committee for Industrial Organiza
tion and the power behind the United !
Automobiles Workers Union, bought
a railroad ticket in Washington and
said he was hurrying to the center of
hostilities.
Larry Davidow, attorney for the
U.A.W., indicated that the union
might appeal directly to the State
Supreme Court from Judge Gadola's
injunction decision. This was pos
ble, ne haitl, because the injunction!
suit involved property rights.
