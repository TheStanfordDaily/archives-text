Coach Wytze Goiter has been
handling his frosh basketball team
in great style, it would seem to one
who is not exactly a veteran in judg
ing the worth of hoop coaching, for
he has yet to lose a game this season.
Blessed with a frosh team that
seems to have a lot of what it takes
to win games, the soft-spoken blond
has worked them from a bunch of
unco-ordinated kids into a smooth
working team. This boy Siebert, who
really is a mass of basketball player
in more ways than in size, looked as
though he might have trouble getting
around fast enough to compete with
a lot of clever little men ct first, but
he has improved plenty since the
season began.
Ile has bundles of speed, and
has had since he first showed up.
but it takes more than plain speed
to be good. A player must control
his speed, be able to shift and pivot
and drive with case at all times
but at the same time avoid barging
around and committing fouls. Big
Tom has developed control greatly
since he began here, and with his
great height and weight should he
some basketball player before he
gets through.
Coach Wytze has more than Sie
bert, though, to make this team of his
good. Ted Lyon, Piedmont lad and
brother of varsity's Dick Lyon, has
lots of fire, he's fast and clever, and
has a lot better basketball brain
than a lot of Coast Conference play
ers I could name. He's always work
ing, using his head as well as his feet
and hands, and more than that, he
has a swell disposition.
Tall Will "Andy" Anderson is an
other who shows great promise. Not
as flashy as some of the others, he is
as steady as a rock and has a deceit
ful air of slowness that fools a lot of
players into forgetting about him.
But he's right there all the time.
Leon Lafaille, the French boy
from Oakland, All-City last year,
is one of the surest players in ball
handling to be found. Let him get
a finger or two on a pass and it's
his. He has that polished demeanor
that shows Ins speed, and he is a
torrid shot. The combination makes
him the most pleasant to watch of
all the frosh hoopmen, and he
should turn out to be a strong var
sity man in the next three years.
Gil Rahn, the peewee of the tower
ing frosh outfit, even though he is
about 5 feet lOV2, is largely a guiding
hand on the team, so consistent that
he can well be likened to Spooks
Calderwood of the varsity. A fine
passer, very strong on defense, and
a great planner on offense. Rahn is a
cinch to play lots of basketball be
fore he leaves Stanford.
There are others, too, that Gor
ter can iiardly gel along without—
Slaehle, Leckie, Norton, Oakford,
and a flock of others who are all
good kids, and who all show plenty
of promise for John Bunn.
But all these good players are only
half of the Frosh team. They would
have been no team at all without
coaching, and I have a sneaking
hunch they have developed to the
point they have largely because
Wytze Gorter is a god coach. A
frosh team that goes through its sea
son is practically phenomenal at
Stanford, but Wytze has a golden op
portunity-to lead his outfit all the
way in just that condition. The team
passed two of the toughest humps
when they beat Sacramento J.C. and
Modesto J.C. the nights of the U.C.
L.A. series here, coming from behind
in the latter to win handily. More
power, Wytze.
