# Price Shuffles Cal Quintet for Farm Tilt
## Turner Returns to Team In Practice Drills 
### GORDY FROST 
While all was comparatively quiet
on the Stanford basketball front last
night. Coach "Nibs" Price was shuf
fling and reshuffling his Calil'ornians
across the Bay in an attempt to find
his best starting combination for Fri
day night's contest here in the Stan#-
ford Pavilion.
Price intimated yesterday that the
only first-string man sure of his job
was Ray Balsley, the Bears' slender

Howie Turner was hack on
the practice floor yesterday
afternoon, but is still not ex
pected to be set by Friday night.

noon off, while silent prayers
rose from the Pavilion that his
slight cold would develop into
nothing serious.

co-captain. In the other spots, Price
tried half a dozen men under fire at
practice last night.
At the center spot Bob Chalmers,
rangy sophomore Bear, still holds the
edge over Chet Carlisle, veteran cen
ter from last year's squad. At the
guard positions, a trio are battling it
out—lierwig", Jensen and Hillsman—
and Price is searching for the most
effective pair to use Friday. Hills
man is said to have it on both Herwig
and Jensen when it comes to speed,
ball-handling and shooting, but
lacks the height to take shots off the
backboard.
At right forward, Price is hunting
for a god running-mate for Balsley.
Bob Duffy, who began the season at
regular right forward, was badly off
form last week-end against U.C.I A.
Price had five men competing for the
job last night.
Along with the
line-up, Coach Price is also spending
much time on foul shooting — last
week-end his lads hit an all-time low
with only four out of fourteen free
throws made.
