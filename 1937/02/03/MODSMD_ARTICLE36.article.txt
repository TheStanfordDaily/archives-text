### 
With all their marks to date firmly
imprinted on the credit side of the
ledger, frosh hoopsters tonight are
gunning for their eighth consecutive
win in as many starts, the victim this
time to be San Mateo Jaysee.
No information is available as to
the power or weakness of the San
Mateo team, but evidently they have
a bit of respect for Mentor Goiter's
quintet, for a few days ago they paid
an unofficial visit to watch the pap
ooses at work.
Bob Oakford, although returned to
school via the hospital and rest
home, will not see action for at least
a week. The rest of the team is in
tact with the exception of Ted Lyon,
fast-moving forward, who is the lat
est to be chopped down by the team's
current nemesis, the flu. He is out
indefinitely.
Starting for the frosh tonight will
be Lafaille and Staehle at forwards,
Siebert at center, and Rahn and An
derson at the guard spots.
Other games this week for the
yearlings are scheduled for Friday
night against the Cal Frosh here, and
Saturday night with U.S.F. frosh at
the Civic.
