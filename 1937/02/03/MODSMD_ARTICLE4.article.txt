# Flood Crisis Seen for Today
## Crest Set at 60 Feet, Just Two Feet Below Levees 
### 
I CAIRO, 111., Feb. 1 (UP).—Flood
! waters snarling at the gates of this
I walled city will reach their crests
J within the next three days, at least
J two and a half feet below the tops of
i emergency bulkheads, a government
; forecast said tonight.
It was cheering news to bearded
j defenders crouched behind ice-
I covered ramparts — their third such
j in four days.
Their first came last Friday when
the raging Ohio burst over its banks
, above the city and sent flood waters
I surging down the Cache Basin in a
new route to the Mississippi.
Their second came last night as
flood waters splashed over the V
shaped concrete wall and then froze
solid on the emergency bulkhead.
Engineers said the ice would seal the
bulkheads of dirt and cinders and
make them virtually impregnable.
Government Meteorologist W. E.
Barron reduced his prediction of the
maximum Ohio crest today and set it
at 60.5. Previously he had believed
it would go to GO or 61 feet. He ex
j peeled the peak Wednesday or
Thursday.
