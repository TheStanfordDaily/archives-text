# A 						Trump Without Honors
## 
### 
PARDON us, ladies and gents, but we want to
kibitz.
It's none of our business, but both Cardinals
and Women's Conference are making more out
of the King-Queen contest than a Senate In
vestigating Committee, and accomplishing less
than a peace conference.
Perhaps we should hold any suggestions
until a few dozen more brass hats have met to
decide what brass hats should meet to appoint
other brass hats. That would give all the poli
ticians a chance to do all the talking they desire.
But it isn't the way to get this rather simple
and silly business settled, which, we are forced
to observe, is why all the brass hats were
originally appointed.
So we offer our solution to the typewriter,
not to the people concerned, because the type
writer has never talked back.
This is it: have a bawl-out vote at 25 cents per,
entitling the payee to elect both a king and
queen.
The plan, dear typewriter, lias numerous
advantages. First, it will increase the amount
of the donation to the Convalescent Home (re
member the kiddies? That's what the contest
is for) without precipitating a harikari epidemic
on the Row. For buying votes will be a helluva
risky business. And it will be impossible to
draw a check for S5OO and buy your way in
directly.
Second, it will keep everybody's nose clean.
Third, it won't make a poor San Francisco
newspaper reporter come all the down to Stan
ford to give his paper a potential libel suit.
Fourth, it will give the hall girls an even
break, possibly more than an even break,
which is only fair considering the relatively
stronger solidarity of a sorority.
Fifth, it will be easy on Miss Yost's digestion.
Sixth, it will be easy on our digestion.
Seventh, it will make unnecessary such dis
plays as that engineered in 1935 when a can
didate's name soiled the sky, and in 1936, when
most of a circus walked onto the campus dis
guised as an elephant.
Eighth, the race will necessarily be close,
for memberships in sororities closely approach
the same figure.
We could go on with ninth and tenth advan
tages, but we'll leave that to some enterprising
soul with one eye on an Ex Committee post
who may wave our flag for us.
Flaws detected will be gladly received and
answered in plain envelope, express prepaid.
