# Behind Flood Relief—Out Front
## 
### 
WHILE muddy, swollen rivers poured into
a huge section of Mid-Western United
States last week, Stanford sat high and dry on
its little peneplane and watched.
And Stanford heeded what it saw, for out of
that sitting and watching two flood relief meas
ures sprang—both answers to Red Cross' ap
peal for donations. Only six times in the last
fifteen years has Red Cross made public appeal
after the yearly drive—and that organization
aids in about 100 disasters a year.
Number one of Stanford's relief fund meas
ures appeared suddenly on the Row last week.
One house arbitrarily collected, another joined,
and then others. The movement of arbitrary
giving, unblighted by the "you are asked to
give" argument of every-day fund drives, gath
ered headway into the halls.
Unsung is Row man, Edward Middleton, who
initiated the movement, voluntarily acted as
treasurer, received okay of the Red Cross, ap
pealed for and obtained the University nod of
approval.
Last night Stanford's un-pushed Flood Fund
drive was nearing the S9OO mark—as far as is
known, tops of coastal universities.
On another front last week, Stanford's num
ber two movement began when B.A.C. officials
held a guick get-together, talked for 15 minutes,
made a phone call to U.S.F. and announced that
Stanford would take her basketball team to San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium Saturday night to
play the Dons. Proceeds would go to the Red
Cross for flood relief.
The City of San Francisco donated its Audi
torium and police facilities; U.S.F. will handle
technicalities of the game; City news-sheets,
Stanford and U.S.F. will sell tickets, and no one
but players will go free.
Would-be complimentary ticket holders saw
thorns appear in their usually rose-strewn path
with the "no comp" announcement. The gravy
train doesn't run Saturday night, not even for
Mr. oiid Mrs. Luisctti.

So it is that on two fronts Stanford stands be
hind flood sufferers—one through unsolicited
contributions from living groups, the other
through participation in a fund-raising basket
ball scheme.

Stanford is fortunate that it may sit on its
little peneplane and watch.

giving, unblighted by the "you are asked to
give" argument of every-day fund drives, gath
ered headway into the halls.
Unsung is Row man, Edward Middleton, who
initiated the movement, voluntarily acted as
treasurer, received okay of the Red Cross, ap
pealed for and obtained the University nod of
approval.
Last night Stanford's un-pushed Flood Fund
drive was nearing the S9OO mark—as far as is
known, tops of coastal universities.
On another front last week, Stanford's num
ber two movement began when B.A.C. officials
held a guick get-together, talked for 15 minutes,
made a phone call to U.S.F. and announced that
Stanford would take her basketball team to San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium Saturday night to
play the Dons. Proceeds would go to the Red
Cross for flood relief.
The City of San Francisco donated its Audi
torium and police facilities; U.S.F. will handle
technicalities of the game; City news-sheets,
Stanford and U.S.F. will sell tickets, and no one
but players will go free.
Would-be complimentary ticket holders saw
thorns appear in their usually rose-strewn path
with the "no comp" announcement. The gravy
train doesn't run Saturday night, not even for
Mr. oiid Mrs. Luisctti.

So it is that on two fronts Stanford stands be
hind flood sufferers—one through unsolicited
contributions from living groups, the other
through participation in a fund-raising basket
ball scheme.

Stanford is fortunate that it may sit on its
little peneplane and watch.
