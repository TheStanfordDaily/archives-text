NO wonder American youth is rallying to
the red flag, for America's conservative
universities hold nothing for them. And if they
take the hammer and sickle and tear down the
out-moded cultural pattern that is our capitalist
civilization, more power to them.
It's all right to maintain a rotten system of
corrupt courts. It's all right to make distinctions
between class and class, creed and creed, and
bow down the backs of labor with an insuffer
able burden of privilege.
And it's all right to send us and our sons to
war so that some pot-bellied, be-haunched bar
on of industry can line his pockets.
But when they take away the right of free
speech, in the words of the common man, the
right to gripe, then we must rise and break the
Chains that bind us.
And they have taken that right.
There is no reason to gripe about basketball
tickets. There just aren't any more.
And the dirty capitalists at the B.A.C. can tell
us just exactly where they went, and to whom,
damn it!
