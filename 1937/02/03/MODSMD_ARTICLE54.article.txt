# OUR HASHER

### 
HASHER has a plan to eliminate all objections
to the Masque Ball King and Queen Contest. All
girls who want to be queen will line up in a row. All
boys who want to be king will line up in a row. All
boys and girls who do not want to be king or queen
will then line up in a row. This will eliminate imme
diately the Hall-Row split (with nuts, 5 cents extra).
Next, all those in the first row will be required to pay
a $2 syllabus fee, because they want to be queen; those
in the second row will pay a $2 syllabus fee, because
they want to be king; while those who line up in the
third row, if any, will be required to pay a $2 syllabus
fee because they do not want, to be king or queen.
Nothing could be fairer or more democratic than this.
That is what Stanford is proud of: her democracy, her
fairness, and her syllabus fees.
All checks returned from the bank for any reason
whatsoever will result in a $2 fine.
All checks drawn in payment of the fine that return
fx*om the bank for any reason whatsoever will result in
a $2 fine. Now the checks drawn in payment of this
fine that return from the bank for any reason whatso
ever will result in a $2 fine. This can go on for quite
a while. The possibilities, you see, are limitless.
This will eliminate the financial objections to the
contest, I am sure.
Final selection of the King and Queen will occur
when somebody blindfolds a little child from the
A.S.S.U. office. Stevie and Aten will then reach down
into the box and pull out several payment orders and
authorizations to charge, saying that Bencher's society
has 45 cents in the treasury, and has had 45 cents in
the treasury for 45 years. During the intermission the
Stanford Band will play a few numbers. This will be
followed immediately by a second l'eaching into the box,
when a slip will be pulled out saying that the chairman
of Women's Council or Women's Conference got a
lockout for having two fiat tires and a piston slap on
the Bayshore.
The Queen will thus be chosen, eliminating all
question of this being a popularity contest.
The objections to the Conktest on democratic, finan
cial, and popularity-contest grounds arc thus removed
by the Our Hasher plan.
At the height of my eliminating abilities, in the
bright flush of youth, as it were, there comes the sad
realization though, that, despite my perfected plan
for the Contest, all the objections to the Masque Ball
King and Queen Contest cannot be eliminated until we
eliminate Women's Conference, Women's Council, the
women, and the Administration.

HASHER has a plan to eliminate all objections
to the Masque Ball King and Queen Contest. All
girls who want to be queen will line up in a row. All
boys who want to be king will line up in a row. All
boys and girls who do not want to be king or queen
will then line up in a row. This will eliminate imme
diately the Hall-Row split (with nuts, 5 cents extra).
Next, all those in the first row will be required to pay
a $2 syllabus fee, because they want to be queen; those
in the second row will pay a $2 syllabus fee, because
they want to be king; while those who line up in the
third row, if any, will be required to pay a $2 syllabus
fee because they do not want, to be king or queen.
Nothing could be fairer or more democratic than this.
That is what Stanford is proud of: her democracy, her
fairness, and her syllabus fees.
All checks returned from the bank for any reason
whatsoever will result in a $2 fine.
All checks drawn in payment of the fine that return
fx*om the bank for any reason whatsoever will result in
a $2 fine. Now the checks drawn in payment of this
fine that return from the bank for any reason whatso
ever will result in a $2 fine. This can go on for quite
a while. The possibilities, you see, are limitless.
This will eliminate the financial objections to the
contest, I am sure.
Final selection of the King and Queen will occur
when somebody blindfolds a little child from the
A.S.S.U. office. Stevie and Aten will then reach down
into the box and pull out several payment orders and
authorizations to charge, saying that Bencher's society
has 45 cents in the treasury, and has had 45 cents in
the treasury for 45 years. During the intermission the
Stanford Band will play a few numbers. This will be
followed immediately by a second l'eaching into the box,
when a slip will be pulled out saying that the chairman
of Women's Council or Women's Conference got a
lockout for having two fiat tires and a piston slap on
the Bayshore.
The Queen will thus be chosen, eliminating all
question of this being a popularity contest.
The objections to the Conktest on democratic, finan
cial, and popularity-contest grounds arc thus removed
by the Our Hasher plan.
At the height of my eliminating abilities, in the
bright flush of youth, as it were, there comes the sad
realization though, that, despite my perfected plan
for the Contest, all the objections to the Masque Ball
King and Queen Contest cannot be eliminated until we
eliminate Women's Conference, Women's Council, the
women, and the Administration.
