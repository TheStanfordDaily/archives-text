IF HORATIO ALGER is still living and reads the
magazines, it must make him positively cry to see all
the work he went through raising his poor heroes from
bootblack to bank president. Think of those poor lads
working for two dollars a week when in these days all
a guy has to do to become general manager of his com
pany is use Lifebuoy, the modern secret of success.
One bath, one promotion, another bath, another raise.
Simple?
Christy Mathewson is dead now, so the great old
guy who used to write about Pitcher Pollock and
Catcher Craig never saw what a futile note his books
harped on. Catcher Craig and Pitcher Pollock used lo
go out in vacant lots and practice like the devil, when
now all an athlete has to do is to knock off a carton
of Camels like Pop-eye kills a bowl of spinach, and
the world is his.

Use Listerinfi and make yourself a Casanova! Chew
the five-foot shelf of books for 15 minutes a day and
talk like a college professor! Wash your undies in Lux
and your teeth in the powder your dentist uses and
your hair with Fitch's dandruff-remover shampoo. Such
a world as we do live in! My twelve-year-old brother
is a major in the Junior Birdmen of America, and babes
in the candle can be G-men and G-ladies if they wish.
Listen to this, clipped from the side of a Post-Toasties
box:
"With two box tops. I will send you free the regula
tion size Junior G-man badge (my boy's badge for boys
—my girl's badge for girls) .. . and a big exciting book
of clues, secret codes, and inside information ONLY

Can absurdity go any further? That is just it—it
can. Just the other day there was a Shinola shoe
polish ad in the Sunday funnies. It told about the man
who never could be a success. You know why? He
was using cheap shoe polish that stayed shiny on a half
day basis. In other words, even though he shined his
shoes in the morning, they looked dingy after he came
back ,from lunch at noon.
So he changed to Shinola, which kept his shoes
bright and polished all day long, and he was imme
diately made president of his company. Or maybe it
was president of the United States.
