### R.B. JONES 
REARING SLOWLY, in broken
0 English, ERNST WILLY MEYER
registered surprise last night when
he told how little recognized the
Stanford Ski Club is.
Ernst is from Zurich, Switzerland,
where he is an officer in the Swiss
Army. It is in line of army duty
that he learned to ski over rigorous
courses designed for the Alps coun
try travel. When asked about his
skiing, Ernst admitted:
"Perhaps I am one of the best ski
men at Yosemite, but at home I'm
just medium."
Besides wanting to get an educa
tion from Stanford and learn more
about Encina tactics, he is the foreign
sports correspondent for the largest
and most popular sports sheet in
Switzerland.
Ernst goes out for R.O.T.C. from
sheer interest, but in order to par
ticipate, he first had to gain permis
sion from a United States official
(Col. Peyton) to wear his Swiss uni
form in drill, as the law of Switzer
land demands that he wear it in all
army tactics. But now that he has
the grant to get a general knowledge
of R.O.T.C. tactics, he has to send all
the way back to Switzerland for the
necessary uniform.

ONE MAN'S FAMILY, popular
radio story, is being adapted for film
production. PAGE OILMAN, the
family's son, "Jack," and a Deit here
on the campus, has been contracted
for the movie cast.
Screen tests have already been
successfully made, and the story is
to be based on what Has already been
done over the air. All Paramount is
waiting for is the right directorâ€”
likely to be Henry Hathaway, direc
tor of "Lives of a Bengal Lancer"
and of the Family's screen test.
