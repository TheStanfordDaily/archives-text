## HOW IT BEGAN

The Editor, Sir:
A little germ crawled into me
And settled down in there,
I wish I knew how he had come,
From whom or what or where.
He made himself a happy home,
With wife and children, too,
His family prospered very well,
And I came down with flu!
"I have to work and must get cured,
I wish you'd go away,
There are so many other boys

In whom you all could stay."
A million germs crawled out of me
And made their homes anew,
And now that I am well again,
We all have got the flu!

Five pairs of stained glass windows
representing faith, hope, charity,
justice and wisdom will be installed
this month in the chapel at the
University of Pittsburgh.
