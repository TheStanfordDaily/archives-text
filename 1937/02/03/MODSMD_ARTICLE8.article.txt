# New Deal for Oysters Planned at Stanford
## 
### 
A New Deal for oysters is being
pushed at Humboldt Bay, where two
commercial companies have begun a
better housing plan for the bivalve
society, according to Paul Bonnot,
Stanford senior fishery biologist.
Mr. Bonnot has been experiment
ing to discover what California
waters are suitable for natives, and
which for immigrant oysters.
Bay Area Poor
Japanese varieties, for instance,
thrive in Modega, Drakes, and Mor
ros Bays, which are entirely barren
of native species. San Francisco Bay
has very little area suitable for oys
ter beds because of the underworld
faction which stirs up the bottom and
causes food shortage.
Public enemies include sting rays,
drills, slipper shells, and such crus
taceans as the ghost shrimp. Natural
foes are necessary, however, ex
plained Mr. Bonnot, for without
competition, the oysters would soon
overpopulate the bay, making crowd
ed slum conditions.
Artificial Homes
When young oysters leave home
and set out to make the world their
oyster bed, collectors made of
boards covered with sand and ce
ment, are planted in their path. The

tiny creatures, if in thcmood, settle
upside down on their new homes
which are then transferred to arti
ficial, diked-in beds, where they
grow to healthy adulthood in about
20 months.
The Olympia, a native of Wash
ington, is the blue-blood of oyster
society. It is a small succulent type
which fetches highest prices in the
market. Eastern kinds don't flourish
in the West, and soon lose their flavor
if laid down in San Francisco Bay.
The Japanese do all right, although
many think them too strong.
No Pearls
Eating oysters do not rate a play
from the pearl industry, as they yield
a very inferior pearl. True jewels
come from the marguerites, their
cousins, said Mr. Bonnot.
Pearls, he explained, are the result
of a diseased condition in the oyster.
A grain of sand or other foreign mat
ter, slipped under the shell, so an
noys the animal that it covers the
irritant with nacre —the mother-of
pearl with which an oyster lines its
shell. As time goes on, this mate
rial continues to collect, increasing
the size of the pearl.

has very little area suitable for oys
ter beds because of the underworld
faction which stirs up the bottom and
causes food shortage.
Public enemies include sting rays,
drills, slipper shells, and such crus
taceans as the ghost shrimp. Natural
foes are necessary, however, ex
plained Mr. Bonnot, for without
competition, the oysters would soon
overpopulate the bay, making crowd
ed slum conditions.
Artificial Homes
When young oysters leave home
and set out to make the world their
oyster bed, collectors made of
boards covered with sand and ce
ment, are planted in their path. The

tiny creatures, if in thcmood, settle
upside down on their new homes
which are then transferred to arti
ficial, diked-in beds, where they
grow to healthy adulthood in about
20 months.
The Olympia, a native of Wash
ington, is the blue-blood of oyster
society. It is a small succulent type
which fetches highest prices in the
market. Eastern kinds don't flourish
in the West, and soon lose their flavor
if laid down in San Francisco Bay.
The Japanese do all right, although
many think them too strong.
No Pearls
Eating oysters do not rate a play
from the pearl industry, as they yield
a very inferior pearl. True jewels
come from the marguerites, their
cousins, said Mr. Bonnot.
Pearls, he explained, are the result
of a diseased condition in the oyster.
A grain of sand or other foreign mat
ter, slipped under the shell, so an
noys the animal that it covers the
irritant with nacre —the mother-of
pearl with which an oyster lines its
shell. As time goes on, this mate
rial continues to collect, increasing
the size of the pearl.
