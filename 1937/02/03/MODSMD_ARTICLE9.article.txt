# 'Once, Enough,' Savs Del Monte Prize Refuser
## 
### 
At the President's Ball last Sat
urday night in the Women's Gym
Franklin L. Anderson won what
was considered the hest door prize
given away that evening—a free
week-end at Hotel Del' Monte. An
derson was escorting a blind date,
and disdaining the prize, promptly
gave it to the lucky lady.
The assembled multitude was
agog. Questioned by many on the
cause of his scorn, Mr. Anderson
yesterday sent the following letter
ot the Daily.
The Editor, Sir:
Much of doubt has seemingly aris
en with respect to my perspicacity in
disposing of the apparently much
coveted advantages to be gained
from a week-end stay at the far
famed, world-renowned Hotel Del
Monte, set amidst a sile of unpar
alleled beauty and splendor, sur- ■
rounded by the rolling dunes and
within hearing of the booming
breakers of Monterey Bay.
Without further discussion upon j
(he virtually unquestioned desira- i
bility of this opportunity, let us look,
gentlemen, al the considerable facts
as I interpret them, and all of which
I hold as valid:
1. I have already been to Hotel Del
Monte.
With all due respects to yourself,
I am,
Respectfully yours,
Franklin L. Anderson
