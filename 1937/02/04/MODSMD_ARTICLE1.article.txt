is a silly business.
Which, by geometric progression,
makes popular government at Stan
ford a side-splitting farce.
At a special matinee yesterday,
Cardinals, Women's Conference and
Ex Committee pooled their talents
for an Actor's Fund Fair version of
the famous opera, "The Masque Ball,
or I've Got You Out on a Limb."
As the Phantoms of the Opera were
Cax-dinals, who gave a fine perform
ance from under the red robe. The
heroines were the vestal members of
Women's Conference.
Now if there's anything funnier
than men in the play called politics,
it's women. And if there's anything
funnier than women, it's a Women's
Conference. And topping them all
are neither women nor men, but
mice, commonly known as Cardinals.
Which made the performance ter
rific. But as usual, although the cast
was not troubled by back stage nois
es, the audience was.
For the racket of the stage hands
was tremendous. It was a good deal
louder than a sit-down strike, which
indicated that people were doing a
good deal of purposeful standing,
even running about behind the
scenes.

VTER a f ew s iHy compromises had
been broached and breached, the
pay-off last act arrived, which was in
more ways than one a pay-off.
Or maybe paying had nothing to
do with it. For it sounded to us more
like saving—face-saving.
It seems that Women's Conference
has a fine face. To the campus it is,
officially, the leader of feminine
Stanford. Cardinals have a face, too.
But their's has been somewhat dam
aged, particularly the nasal member
which has been in several tight
places lately.
Cardinals did not want to damage
their face further. But Cardinals did
want the women to okeh a King-
Queen contest. And, of course,
Women's Conference, with its un
sullied countenance, didn't want to
be flecked with mud by merely giv
ing in and saying "O.K. Boys."

r wouldn't be good politics. It
also wouldn't be ladylike. In the
first p'ace, Women's Conference offi
cially represents all the women on
the campus In the second place, it
actually repi nobody except
its own membeis.
And, damn it, the women of Wom
en's Conference don't want a Masque
Ball.
But what would happen if the
business of a King-Queen contest
were put to a campus vote? Well, it
won't happen, because there's noth
ing worse than a good blush to mess
up the complexion of a Women's
Conference.
And what a blush it would be.
For the campus would know once
and for all that Democracy, even at
Stanford, is an impossible form of
government. People, at Stanford, in
evitably elect capable people to rep
resentative posts. And if they're not
capable, they're soon swung 1 into
line, capably.
Women's Conference has been so
swung. It has to play ball with the
University Administration, for worn- i
en in college are dangerous things at
best to the institution which houses
them and learns them and gets them
married respectably
The Conference simply can't afford
to give their constituents a square
deal.
It was appointed with the under
standing it would only pretend it
could. —B. E.
