# New Lagunita Wing May Soon Replace Ancient Paly Dorm
## Oaks Evacuation Planned When Lease Expires 
### 
Construction of Lagunita's new
wing, with accommodations for 80
additional women, may result in
abandonment of the Oaks as a stu
dent residence.
Although the roof leaks and con
siderable plaster fell off the walls
recently. Miss Yost would not give
her stand on the discontinuance of
the use of the Oaks. The property
belongs to Miss Catherine Harker, of
Miss Marker's School in Palo Alto,
and Miss Yost did not want to "ex
press her opinion of a building be
longing to someone else."
Further use of the Oaks will de
pend upon size of registration and
upon whether or not Miss Harker
W'.ll want to continue the lease,
which expires at the end of this
year.
Although construction of the new
wing may start this month, Miss
Yost was not at all sure this would
be the case. "With the labor situa
tion what it is," she said, "it is hard
to tell what will happen." It is con
sidered likely, however, that the new
addition will be ready for use by
next fall.


THE OAKS, women's dormitory in Palo Alto, slowly crumbles.
With tin- season's rains come rains of plaster, on unsuspecting co-eds
heads.
