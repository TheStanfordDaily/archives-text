# Raging Waters Threaten 6000
## Roosevelt Commission Tours Stricken Area 
### 
CAIRO, 111., Feb. 3 (UP). — The
crest of the super-flood pushed a
yellow, icy hand against the walls
of Cairo today, threatening the lives
of 600 weary men who were the act
ors in the first major test between a
billion-dollar levee system and two
raging rivers. Hopes rose this after
noon when the water on the walls
had been stationary at 59.58 feet sev
eral hours, moved up to 59.59, then
stood stationary again.
But the battle went on after a
night of fear—a night of bursting
"sandboils," spouting geysers in the
streets, breaking gas mains, sinking
sidewalks and collapsing houses—in
thi city at the confluence of the
Ohio and Mississippi.
Bucking the current upstream on
a steamboat, members of President
Roosevelt's Flood Commission reach
ed Cairo and started a tour of the
area with Governor Henry Horner.
Behind the crest was Paducah,
Ky., a "ghost city," where the river
was 10 miles wide and five feet deep
in the streets. Thirty-four thousand
persons have been driven out of Pa
ducah, and fire was raging through
the town. Five buildings burned.
Sixteen persons were arrested for
looting.
Tragedy walked ahead of the crest
as well as behind. At New Madrid,
Mo., 10 more bodies were recovered
from a strong - running spillway,
bringing to 15 the known dead in
the sinking of a barge carrying 100
workmen.
