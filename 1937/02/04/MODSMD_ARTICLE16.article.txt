# Papa Swampum Sore; Junior Covers Polls
## 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM, JR 
So disappointed was Solon O. :
Swampum in the calmness of this |
year's election that he refused to !
go to the polls, sent Swampum
Junior instead, and moaned about :
the good old days on page two.— j
The Editor.

"There-is something rotten in Den
mark!"
So said Shakespeare and so say \
Stanford's political big-wigs. With '
only eight A.S.S.U. positions vacant, j
a round forty aspirants signified j
their intentions for campaigning, j
Unofficially thus is a record—seldom
are more than three nominated for ]
any one position, yet no less than'
seven are headed for a job as sopho- j
more woman on Ex Committee.
Among this multitude are repre- j
sentatives from the powers of sister- !
hood, Kappas, D.G.'s, Thetas, Pi |
Phi's, Alpha Phi's, and Gamma!
Phi's, respectively Jean Reynolds, I
Didi Vibert (she was at Ex Commit- j
tee meeting last night), Margaret
Marshall, Jayne Copp, Ann Palmer,'
and Eleanor Hatch. Ranged against'
this imposing lineup is lone hall- !
woman Pat Skinner.
Time alone will tell whether this]
means a Row split, a devil-may-care !
attitude, or a clever political plot j
which will result in five declinations, j
Numerous Nominees
Another popular position is junior j
man on Ex Committee. Here we find
star basketballer Jack Calderwood !
facing six Greeks. Most potent of j
these is Phi Delt Bob Mcßoskey, who '
won the nomination over brother j
Tom Collins of football fame. Help- ]
ing to split the vote are Jack Be- j
man, Delt; Curt Eaton, Kappa Sig; j
Sandy Lowengart, Sigma Chi; and j
George Veness, Phi Pst; an imposing!
aggregation.
For graduate member we find a!
clear Hall-Row split. Joe Weineri
of Los Arcos against Phi Delt Joe i
Burris. (Notice that the Zetes are
staying in the background—"Killifer
for A.S.S.U. President.")
B.A.C. Aspirants
Athlete meets athlete in trying
for B.A.C. member. Best known is
Phi Psi Pete Zagar (but he is a soph- j
oinore and that is agin him). Close
in the offing comes D.U. Joe Vigna
and Zete Jack Clark. (Ah! At last!)
Roger Munger represents the halls
as well as the Breakers, and Darrel
Holman, Delta Chi; and Dave Rider,
Sigma Nu, are right in there.
There is little to say about Wom
en's council. Five hall women will
fight it out against four Lasuen dam- !
sels. Men's Council presents about j
the same situation with six hall men I
and only four Greeks.

"There-is something rotten in Den
mark!"
So said Shakespeare and so say \
Stanford's political big-wigs. With '
only eight A.S.S.U. positions vacant, j
a round forty aspirants signified j
their intentions for campaigning, j
Unofficially thus is a record—seldom
are more than three nominated for ]
any one position, yet no less than'
seven are headed for a job as sopho- j
more woman on Ex Committee.
Among this multitude are repre- j
sentatives from the powers of sister- !
hood, Kappas, D.G.'s, Thetas, Pi |
Phi's, Alpha Phi's, and Gamma!
Phi's, respectively Jean Reynolds, I
Didi Vibert (she was at Ex Commit- j
tee meeting last night), Margaret
Marshall, Jayne Copp, Ann Palmer,'
and Eleanor Hatch. Ranged against'
this imposing lineup is lone hall- !
woman Pat Skinner.
Time alone will tell whether this]
means a Row split, a devil-may-care !
attitude, or a clever political plot j
which will result in five declinations, j
Numerous Nominees
Another popular position is junior j
man on Ex Committee. Here we find
star basketballer Jack Calderwood !
facing six Greeks. Most potent of j
these is Phi Delt Bob Mcßoskey, who '
won the nomination over brother j
Tom Collins of football fame. Help- ]
ing to split the vote are Jack Be- j
man, Delt; Curt Eaton, Kappa Sig; j
Sandy Lowengart, Sigma Chi; and j
George Veness, Phi Pst; an imposing!
aggregation.
For graduate member we find a!
clear Hall-Row split. Joe Weineri
of Los Arcos against Phi Delt Joe i
Burris. (Notice that the Zetes are
staying in the background—"Killifer
for A.S.S.U. President.")
B.A.C. Aspirants
Athlete meets athlete in trying
for B.A.C. member. Best known is
Phi Psi Pete Zagar (but he is a soph- j
oinore and that is agin him). Close
in the offing comes D.U. Joe Vigna
and Zete Jack Clark. (Ah! At last!)
Roger Munger represents the halls
as well as the Breakers, and Darrel
Holman, Delta Chi; and Dave Rider,
Sigma Nu, are right in there.
There is little to say about Wom
en's council. Five hall women will
fight it out against four Lasuen dam- !
sels. Men's Council presents about j
the same situation with six hall men I
and only four Greeks.
So disappointed was Solon O. :
Swampum in the calmness of this |
year's election that he refused to !
go to the polls, sent Swampum
Junior instead, and moaned about :
the good old days on page two.— j
