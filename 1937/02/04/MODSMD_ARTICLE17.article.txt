# Hoover Clarifies Pledge Grade Rule
## 
### 
Only pledges who fail to get a "C" I
average the quarter immediately J
preceding the time-they plan to move!
onto the Row will be excluded, an- j
nounced Bob Hoover yesterday, clar
ifying the rule passed by Interfra- j
ternity Council Tuesday.
Those excluded may still eat and i
hold hash jobs at their houses, Hoo- :
ver continued, and may move in at
the end of any quarter during which !
they have made the required "C" av- '
erage. Not the bawlout average but
that of the Committee on Scholar- j
ship, which allows "C" grade for in- |
completes, will be used.
The move was made, Hoover said, !
not to penalize freshmen, but to en
courage the houses to try to bring up
the averages of their pledge classes, j
He termed the figure "40 or 50," who
might be excluded, too high and sub- â– 
stituted the estimate "15 or 20."
