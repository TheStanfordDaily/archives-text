# No Interest In Election, Sighs Commentator
## 'May Have Clean Vote,' Swampum Predicts As Farm Politicos Silent 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM 
History repeats itself.
Swampum represses a tendency to
say, "Oh, yeah?"
Never in the colorful history of the
Farm has history failed so vehement
ly to repeat itself as in the current
election.
Last May saw caucus after caucus
convening in every corner of the
campus. This year, what? Nary a
caucus.
Dick "Brains" Riddell whipped the
Row sophs into a machine, and car
ried the campus last spring. The Hall
sophs retaliated by out-machining
Riddell, but started too late, and
were still in low when election time
came.
Politics for Politics' Sake
Frosh showed rare political acu
men in political diddling. The Row
and the Hall, those strongholds of
politics for politics' sake, put up in
ter-hall and inter-row lists, and the
unchosen actually withdrew.
But times have changed, and
Swampum's faith in humanity with
them.
The Sigma Chi's, Phi Delts, and
Zetes met at a friendly dinner and
methodically divided the available
spoils. They got them. What's more
surprising is that this lucrative al
liance stopped dead in its tracks.
Trade at Low Ebb
Metternich's status quo had noth
ing on the campus this year. Row
solidarity has reached such a low
ebb that not a single half-hearted
trade is yet on record. Swampum
remembers the time when every
house traded with everyone else, in
discriminately and enthusiastically.
The Thetas traded with everyone,
and the tradees were so absorbed in
their own dirty work at the cross
roads that they never realized what
was going on.
Swampum would like a Hall of
Memory, with small plaques dedi
cated to the frosh caucus, the soph
machine, the soph Hall machine, the
non-partisan machnie, the impartial
women's nominations, and in two
large stucco niches stuffed shirts
symbolizing the Hall and Row. This
year could go down in history in the
form of three small monkeys, seeing,
hearing, and speaking no evil what
soever.
What's the matter with the cam
pus? Swampum predicts, gloomily,
that you guys may have a clean
election on your hands.
