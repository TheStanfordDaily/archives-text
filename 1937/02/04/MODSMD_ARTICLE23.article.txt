# Breakers at the Table-El Campo Bull Session

(How, where, and why does
Stanford have Eating Clubs?
Huiiter Hendec lias answered
these questions in a series of ar
ticles of which this is the last.â€”
The Editor.)

Ready for occupancy in September,
1912, were three buildings designed
by Stanfordman William Knowles
and situated around the "Little
Quad" near Toyon Hall.
Promptly three of the College
Terrace groups moved in, legalized
themselves to the University under
the names of Breakers, El Campo,
and El Toro.
For several years eating club tra
dition set aside the last Sunday in
June for the seniors and faculty
guests of the three groups to come
together, lunch, and lay memorial
plaques in their own Little Quad.
Los Arcos Newest
When the Commons opened in
1923, it provided dining halls for four
more clubs. Among the new groups
which then organized came Los Ar
cos, the last of the College Terrace
clubs. |
Today club members eat at the
conventional hours of 12:15 and 6:15,
confer at Monday night confabs,
glad-hand rushees, and dance in se
lect off-campus spots much in the
manner of their Greek friends up the
Row.
For eating clubs the rushing season
is always open with no restrictions.
In general $5 covers the initiation fee
(there is no initiation) and clubmen
pay a half month's board bill (about
$15) on the first of each month. At
the end of the month the club-man
ager collects or refunds, according to
the number of meals each member
has consumed.
No Legal Ties
Membership is binding by gentle
man's agreement. No contract pre
vents a man from switching clubs or
joining a fraternity. Clubmen, how
ever, seldom seek to sever ties.
For three years an unorganized
Interclub Council has sought to pro
mote social intercourse among the
eating groups with only mild suc
cess. Several exchange dinners were
about all that came of the Council's
efforts last year.
Its aim, however, is to rise into
power comparable to that of the
Interfraternity Council, to promote
all-club smokers and dances.
First really constructive step
toward centralization of the inde
pendent clubs and strengthening of
the Council may be taken next week
when two representatives from each
club meet to ratify or reject a pro
posed constitution for the Council.


SIPPING THEIR SOUP and munching their buns, the Breakers gather twice daily out by Toyon. Left
to right: Ray Malott, Rolle Vestal, Byron Forderhase. Carl Mahurin, Remo Cacitti, Jack Rogers, John Play
ter. EI Campo Dick Clark laughs while El Cainpo Chuck Clark reads aloud. But maybe it's a new AVally
joke.
