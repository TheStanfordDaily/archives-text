# Boxers Meet Davis Aggies Here Tonight
## Stanford Slight Favorite In Twelve Bouts With C.A.C. Team in Pavilion 
### MATTHEW VAN WINKLE 
Fists will fly tonight in the Stan
ford Pavilion when the Indian varsity
boxers meet the farmers from Cal
Aggies, at 8 o'clock. Student admis
sion is 25 cents; the Indian warriors
hope to take matches this evening to
make up for the tied meet last year.
Coach John Priddle promises some
good bouts and says that all matches
will be close. The Indian team is in
fine condition and are all ready to
steam. On the Stanford squad are
only three returning letter men from
last year and on the Davis team there
are only two; coupled with the fact
that the Farm's new recruits are
turning into expert fighters, might
serve to give the favor to the Indians.
In the welterweight bout, the two
contenders are old enemies. Last
year Bill Wilbur of Stanford fought
Bob Hamilton of the Aggies in a very
close exhibition match. The boy from
' Davis took the nod by a very small
margin.
