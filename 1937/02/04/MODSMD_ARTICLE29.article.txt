# Templeton's Track Team Improves Despite Storms
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Track Coach Dink Templeton's
squad of harriers is slowly taking
shape out on Angell Field, although
the slushy cinder path is retarding
seriously some of the lads who run
for their headlines.
Those who don't run, however, the
shot-putters, discus-throwers, pole
vaulters, et al, are taking regular
workouts, while the trackmen are
taking it easy in the game infield.
Dink, on paper at least, hasn't a
great deal to worry about as yet, as
the cries of some of the calamity
howlers would seem to indicate.
In the shot, Dink has Student
Prexy Jim Reynolds, who can shove
the 16-pound pellet upwards of 51
feet into space; Long Tom Montgom
ery, G ft. 8 in. midget, who has im
proved two and a half feet in seven
months, and now can do 48 ft. 5 in.;
Pete Zagar, who should get it out 48
feet anyway; Al Hershey, a veteran
who didn't compete last year, and

who is good for another 47 feet; and
Jack Lipman, who is consistent at
46 feet.
Then, in the discus, big Pete Zagar
is expected to reach 160 feet, to be
capably backed up by Reynolds, who
tried the platter event seriously for
the first time last fall and did 145 feet.
In the broad jump the Cards will
field Leo Madlem, who won in the
Big Meet last year at 23 feet, 5 inches,
and Chuck Voight, capable of 22 feet
8 inches.
The latter will also lead the sprint
trio, consisting of himself, Stan His
erman, a San Mateo lad, and Bill
Thompson, with Jack Weierhauser
running an occasional 220.
The half-mile setup is almost ideal,
with Captain Bill McCurdy turning
in a 1:56 mark last week, which is
very, very fast at this stage of the
game. Gordy Malott, who did 1:57.1
last week, will be right on McCur
dy's heels.
The pole vault will be a bit weak,
with Gill hitting no higher than 13
feet. If he can add six inches to that,
however, before the season starts,
Coach Dink will be ready to leap for
joy. Boore, with 12 feet 9 inches,
will back up Gill.
Perhaps the most stai'tling dictum
issuing from the Templeton throne is
that which assigns Jack Weierhauser
tentatively to the 220 low hurdles in
addition to his regular 440 duties. If
he runs the hurdles, however—and
he did 25 flat during fall practice—
he'll have to let the 220-yard dash go
by the board. It may be that he will
alternate each meet.
And, in the javelin. Dink has Wally
Hardin, who hits 190 with regularity,
and who heaved the spear 202 feet
plus last year at Fresno.

tried the platter event seriously for
the first time last fall and did 145 feet.
In the broad jump the Cards will
field Leo Madlem, who won in the
Big Meet last year at 23 feet, 5 inches,
and Chuck Voight, capable of 22 feet
8 inches.
The latter will also lead the sprint
trio, consisting of himself, Stan His
erman, a San Mateo lad, and Bill
Thompson, with Jack Weierhauser
running an occasional 220.
The half-mile setup is almost ideal,
with Captain Bill McCurdy turning
in a 1:56 mark last week, which is
very, very fast at this stage of the
game. Gordy Malott, who did 1:57.1
last week, will be right on McCur
dy's heels.
The pole vault will be a bit weak,
with Gill hitting no higher than 13
feet. If he can add six inches to that,
however, before the season starts,
Coach Dink will be ready to leap for
joy. Boore, with 12 feet 9 inches,
will back up Gill.
Perhaps the most stai'tling dictum
issuing from the Templeton throne is
that which assigns Jack Weierhauser
tentatively to the 220 low hurdles in
addition to his regular 440 duties. If
he runs the hurdles, however—and
he did 25 flat during fall practice—
he'll have to let the 220-yard dash go
by the board. It may be that he will
alternate each meet.
And, in the javelin. Dink has Wally
Hardin, who hits 190 with regularity,
and who heaved the spear 202 feet
plus last year at Fresno.
Track Coach Dink Templeton's
squad of harriers is slowly taking
shape out on Angell Field, although
the slushy cinder path is retarding
seriously some of the lads who run
for their headlines.
Those who don't run, however, the
shot-putters, discus-throwers, pole
vaulters, et al, are taking regular
workouts, while the trackmen are
taking it easy in the game infield.
Dink, on paper at least, hasn't a
great deal to worry about as yet, as
the cries of some of the calamity
howlers would seem to indicate.
In the shot, Dink has Student
Prexy Jim Reynolds, who can shove
the 16-pound pellet upwards of 51
feet into space; Long Tom Montgom
ery, G ft. 8 in. midget, who has im
proved two and a half feet in seven
months, and now can do 48 ft. 5 in.;
Pete Zagar, who should get it out 48
feet anyway; Al Hershey, a veteran
who didn't compete last year, and

who is good for another 47 feet; and
Jack Lipman, who is consistent at
46 feet.
Then, in the discus, big Pete Zagar
is expected to reach 160 feet, to be
capably backed up by Reynolds, who
tried the platter event seriously for
the first time last fall and did 145 feet.
