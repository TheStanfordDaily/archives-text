# F.D.R. Backs Auto Strikers In Peace Try
## Asks U.A.W. Recognition, End of Sit-Down Strike To Break Plant Tie-up 
### 
DETROIT, Feb. 3 (UP).—Governor
Frank Murphy, acting under special
authority from President Roosevelt,
made two propositions to General
Motors and the United Automobile
Workers today in an eleventh hour
effort to end the 34-day-old strike
without further bloodshed.
The proposition, as outlined to the
United Press by a prominent figure
in the negotiations:
TO GENERAL MOTORS — The
United Automobile Workers of
America must be recognized as the
only agency involved in this dis
pute.
TO THE UNION—The union shall
withdraw all sit-down strikers from
General Motors plants at Flint in re
turn for the Governor's flat guaran
tee, backed by the National Guard,
that General Motors will not resume
production in those plants.
To prevent an incident at the
plants which might upset the whole
delicate fabric of negotiations, re
constructed with assistance of Presi
dent Roosevelt in Washington, Mur
phy telephoned Sheriff Thomas W.
Wolcott at Flint and instructed him
to defer action.
Wolcott denied he had talked with
Murphy but confirmed that he would
not attempt to evict the sit-downers.
Murphy submitted the dual prop
osition at a conference here which
lasted an hour and a half. He was
able for the first time in this con
flict to bring John L. Lewis, chief
of the committee for industrial or
ganization, face-to-face with Wil
liam S. Knudsen, executive vice
president of General Motors.
