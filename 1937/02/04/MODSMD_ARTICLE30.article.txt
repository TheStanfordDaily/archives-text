# Plaques To Be Given by WAA
## Winter; Quarter Sports Calendar Announced 
### 
To stimulate the growing interest
in women's intramurals, the W.A.A.
board decided recently to continue its
new policy of giving plaques to win
ning intramural teams.
A plaque was awarded as an ex
periment for the first time last quar
ter, when it was put up for intra
mural basketball and won by
"Scraps," a combination Hall and
Row team, captained by Luigi
Schmid. No plaque was offered for
tennis, the other autumn quarter in
tramural sport.
This quarter, the W.A.A. will give
two such awards, one to the winning
singles player and one to the doubles
champions in badminton, the winter
quarter intramural sport. The bad
minton tournament, with 24 individ
ual players and 12 doubles teams en
tered, started last week. To keep up
participation in the tournament after
the initial rounds, two points will be
rjiven a single player or a team for
each match won; one point for each
match lost. Thus, a player losing at
first may eventually accumulate
points.
So far in the tournament, only
doubles matches have been played,
the Union team of Irma Greiner and
Virginia Cromwell defeating the
Kappa team of Annice Belden and
Jane Le Cutler; and the Theta team
of Sally Weston and Dulce Parker
defeating a second Kappa team of
Janet Biby and Deborah Dawson.
