808 WESSON
HE'S IN AGAIN
Gentle Mr. Wesson, sports editor of
the Daily Californian and grinder
outer of that daily column, "The
Brawn Patrol," has quite an eye for
the fundamental principles of bas
ketball.
Some time ago fye made the start
ling announcement, assertion, reve
lation, or whatever you want to call
it, that the only way to beat Stanford
in basketball this year was to slow
down the game. By slowing down the
pace, it becomes much more simple
to keep within a reasonable distance
on the scoreboard, and hence it does
n't take so many points to take the
lead. Which, I agree, is quite logical,
quite logical.
Monday last, Bob came out again
with the statement that the only way
to beat the Cards was to slow down
the game. Let me quote—"U.S.C.'s
showing against Stanford in the first
game of the series proves this col
umn's contention that the only way
to beat Stanford is to slow down the
game."
Again I am obliged to agree that
such a line of attack is very forceful
and would probably be very effective
if it only could be applied.
But, Mr. Wesson, your discovery is
not exactly a discovery. John Bunn's
team has played 16 games this year
so far, and practically every oppon
ent had the same idea as you have
conceived, either before they went
into the game or after they had been
in it for five minutes.
NATURE ABIIORS
EXTREMES
Naturally, the only way to beat a
team that wins its games on speed is
to throttle that speed, slow down the
players that are good shots so that
they can't shoot so often. That's just
plain horse-sense. It's the natural
thing to start pulling backward when
somebody's trying to pull you for
ward.
That brings up another thing —
which type of defense is most suited

to stopping Stanford, man-to-man,
straight zone, shifting zone, a team
defense, or what have you? Prob
ably the man-to-man, and a very
close man-to-man at that, is the best
type of defense against the game
Stanford plays. The reason for that
is, of course, that it slows down the
game.
As I recall, California went into
the opening Stanford game with a
defense that was essentially a shift
ing zone, but it wasn't long before the
Bears had changed over to a close
man-to-man in an attempt to stop
Luisetti, Turner, Stoefen, and the
rest of the team. However, when a
team attempts to use such a tight,
leech-like defense it must have a
bunch of players thai are very clever
and able to shift with the offensive
players. California, although she does
have quite a lew very'good basket
ball players, is not this year in a posi
tion to stop Stanford by that meth
od.
ORCHID TO
ORAM
Southern Cal, with Eddie Oram,
has one of the finest defensive men
on the Coast, and it is true that they
got by with their man-to-man tac
tics very well last Friday night. How
ever, they had the same team Satur
day night, and they played the same
Slanford team Saturday night, but
the score was slightly different. Their
defense was the same, why didn't
they stop the Indians then?
The change in complexion of the
series from Friday to Saturday,
though, probably came from the fact
that Stanford's offense underwent a
gradual process of revamping during
the first game. Bunn found his
working combination, to serve while
Turner is incapacitated, in using
Moore at forward and Lee at guard.
He didn't find that right off in the
first game.
That line-up opened the second
game, and had little trouble all the
way in thumping the Barry-coached
outfit. Elevator Sam had four differ
ent men trying to stop Luisetti, and
he found that not one of them could
slow down the superb champion.
Hank scored 43 points in the two
games, 17 in the first, you will recall,
and if that is slowing down a bas
ketball player let me see a fast man
once.
No, that slowing-down-the-game
revelation of yours, Mr. Wesson, is
practically a standard method of
stopping power-house teams. You
didn't reveal anything. If you think I
don't know whereof I speak, go have
a long chat with Nibs Price. I swear
he'll tell you the same thing.
