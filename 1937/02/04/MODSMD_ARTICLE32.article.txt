# Injuries Keep First Stringers From Workout
## Luisetti's Sinus, Turner's Ankle Mar Hoop Work For Friday's Cal Game 
### GORDY FROST 
Uncertainty shrouded two of Stan
ford's important basketball cogs yes
terday as the Rolling Redshirts made
ready for California's invasion of the
Pavilion tomorrow night.
Angelo "Hank" Luisetti was still
battling his touch of sinus and, al
though he turned out in suit for
shooting practice yesterday, specific
instructions were, "Take it easy."
Little doubt exists that he will start
tomorrow night, but the omnipresent
"cold" had basketball followers on
pins and needles, lest the lanky for
ward be the victim of a real "llu"
attack.
Turner's Limp Gone
Second uncertainty in the Pavilion
last night was Howie Turner. Using
his recently injured foot with care,
Turner was able to handle himself
without apparent limp, a great im
provement over bis Tuesday's first
workout after a week in the hospital.
While Luisetti's play is fairly cer
tain, Turner's is equally unlikely. Dr.
Fritz Roth will undoubtedly withhold
"Handsome Howell" until all chances
of ail injury recurrence are dis
pelled.
All other key cogs are "set" for
tomorrow night. In defense practice
last night, H. B. Lee and Jack Cal
derwood clicked in good style at their
guard jobs, and "Stork" Stoefen was
running true to form.
Moore Smoothing Out
Dinty Moore, at his new forward
position, was getting the "feel" of the
job running with Phil Zonne subbing
for Luisetti at the other forward.
Shoved into the background by the
Stanford-California affair Friday
night is the U.S.F.-Stanford flood
charity game scheduled for the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium Satur
day evening.
Though not particularly fearing
U.S.F., Stanford is on the spot as far
as its San Francisco followers are
concerned since in this, its first ap
pearance in the City this season, all
hands are eager to substantiate early
publicity reports of "the best team on
the Coast."
