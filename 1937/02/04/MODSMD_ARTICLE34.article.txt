# Classes to Clash In Swim Meet Saturday
## 
### GENE GEAR 
Sonu* groat battles are in store for Farm aquatic fans Saturday after
noon when Nort Thornton's great aggregation of Stanford swimmers take
their marks for the.All-University Championships.
The annual civil war is really an inferclass meet and Nort's varsity and
frosh mermen will he out (here for a dual purpose. Each man will want to
push his class up on top. and at the same time gather glory for himself by
annexing the University crown in some event.

The featured events of the day will'
probably bring together Winfield
Needhain and Dave Rider in the 220-
and 440-yard free-style events.
Needham is rated by many as the
best distance swimmer ever to wear
Stanford colors.
Holds Speed Record
The sophomore flash holds the
University record of 4:59 for the
quarter. Rider has a national repu
tation, having reached the finals in
the Senior National A.A.U. and
Olympic Games final tryouts last
year. He will represent the juniors.
Making those two distance strug
gles a three-cornered affair will be
Don Peterson, senior, whose sheer
fi.Kht, courage, and marvelous condi
tion may carry him to the top.
Diving Cinched
Roy Winkelman, soph, will have
the diving all to himself, but Tom
Boothe, Card star of the last three
years and now with the Olympic-
Club, will forget insurance sales
long enough to put on an exhibition
with Winkelman.
In the 150-yard backstroke, Hal
Weatherbe, soph, will tangle with
Jack Read, frosh star. With Lloyd
Wilson, frosh ace, out of the picture
with sinus trouble, the 200-yard
breast-stroke should go to Don
Towne, soph, with Bill Hatch press
ing the submarine paddler onward.
In the sprints Captain Martin Sca
tena and Alec Mackenzie will repre
sent the seniors; the juniors will have
Jack Vibert, who may only start in
the 50 because of injuries; and the
sophomores produce Dick Clarke,
who may steal the show.
