# Frosh Hoopmen Thwack Jaysee In Fast Game
## 
### 
I In as wild and pure-woolly a bas- I
j kelball game Stanford fans have seen j
I in the leather-beaten Pavilion since ,
that memorable play-off game with 1
U.S.C. last year, frosh hoopsters as 1
yet undefeated, last night pulled j
themselves out of a very deep mire !
o to trounce San Mateo Jaysee, 51-38.
The fireworks of the game came
e about midway through the second
period. The frosh were in the lead by 1
e a count of 32-26, when, quick like a '
- flash, they seemed to lose their grip. |
i. A dead-eyed attack led by Clark of 1
- the Jaysee made the scoreboard rattle !
s in its attempt to keep up. Before the i
frosh knew what had happened, the j
San Mateo boys were only two points ,
behind, and then came the inevitable
straw to break the collective frosh
back.
Bill Leckie, who had just replaced j
Leon Lafaille, pulled a Roy Riegels
as he took a tip from Sicbert under
his own basket. He was all by him
self and had no trouble sinking a |
set-up which went to the Jaysee on j
the scorebook, and tied up the game
at 34-34.
San Mateo immediately went into
i the lead with a swisher from the cor
| nor by Boggs, but Siebert tied it up i
I again with a follow shot. Then the
\ frosh got mad—plenty. They started
i scoring, and, while doing so, allowed ;
I the Jaysee exactly two points in the
j remaining seven minutes.
i The first few minutes of the first
j half were all Jaysee, but the rest of
| 'he game, with the exception of those
' wild two minutes, was well con
trolled by the frosh. There was no
J outstanding player on the frosh quin- |
jet, which worked as a team—not in- |
| dividually. Siebert was high-point
! man with 17 markers, while San
| Mateo was led in both points and
playing ability by Clark, who rang]
I up 11 points. j

as he took a tip from Sicbert under
his own basket. He was all by him
self and had no trouble sinking a |
set-up which went to the Jaysee on j
the scorebook, and tied up the game
at 34-34.
San Mateo immediately went into
i the lead with a swisher from the cor
| nor by Boggs, but Siebert tied it up i
I again with a follow shot. Then the
\ frosh got mad—plenty. They started
i scoring, and, while doing so, allowed ;
I the Jaysee exactly two points in the
j remaining seven minutes.
i The first few minutes of the first
j half were all Jaysee, but the rest of
| 'he game, with the exception of those
' wild two minutes, was well con
trolled by the frosh. There was no
J outstanding player on the frosh quin- |
jet, which worked as a team—not in- |
| dividually. Siebert was high-point
! man with 17 markers, while San
| Mateo was led in both points and
playing ability by Clark, who rang]
I up 11 points. j
