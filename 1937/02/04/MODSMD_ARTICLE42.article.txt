# Not "Just a Committee"— We Hope
## 
### 
PRESIDENT Reynolds and his Tuesday night
family are firmly convinced the only way to
get things done is to appoint a committee. A
committee, if his actions in Ex Committee meet
ings mean anything, is the solution to every
dilemma. Whether the committee happens to
remember to function after Ex Committee ad
journment is of slight importance.
Anyway, Mr. Reynolds presented a new
committee idea Tuesday that seems to have real
long-run significance. It is this: that a group
be set up as the Committee on Student-Faculty
Relations. Both undergraduate leaders and fac
ulty members will function as a "clearing
house" for student whines and cheers.
Too long have the Administration and indi
vidual professors planned courses and lectures
along lines to suit themselves. Too long have
student-body and faculty gone their own sepa
rate ways, ignoring each other except in luke
warm, academic contacts.
Reynolds' committee would listen to any
gripe, whether from professor or stlident, and
try to judge it fairly. If Jane Bio and her cell
mate in Roble find Instructor Blink's Western
Civ lectures poorly organized and difficult to
imbibe, they can tell the committee about it,
find out if they or the instructor are at fault. If
Encinans need a course on "Women in Society"
the committee will relay their wants on to the
Administration.
As it is, where can students turn when they
are dissatisfied with their $115-worth? The Aca
demic Council might listen, but with a cold, dis
interested ear.
Last quarter The Daily mentioned the lack of
student-faculty relationships, moaned that Stan
ford men and women are losing half the value
of a college education when they pass up natu
ral, informal friendships with "men who live by
their wits." Reynolds sees this lack and fur
ther suggests that his group could arrange more
student-faculty teas and dinners, more outside
the - classroom contacts between those who
teach and those who are taught.
If the present A.S.S.U. administration runs
along as it has with few exceptions since Sep
tember, we may hear no more about a Commit
tee on Student-Faculty Relations. But Reynolds
was smart when he initiated the Current Events
course.
Perhaps this committee —of all his "commit
tees"—will materialize.
