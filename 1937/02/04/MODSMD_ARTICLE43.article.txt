# Row Hands Slap Row Faces
## 
### 
THE collective fraternity face burned from a
slap administered by its own hands Tuesday
night.
But the face was red, long before the slap
struck.
Row "aristocracy," potentially potent in scho
lastic fields, has long lagged behind the Stan
ford mean when it comes to grades. Whether
this be credited to a Row tendency to cling to
raw! raw! college tradition, with the cinema
version of midnight bulls, pennant waving, and
the whacking of posterior parts, is one of the
mysteries of Lasuen.
Whether it be due to a fraternity tendency to
overload itself with activities—the glorified bull
sessions known as house meetings, two months
of concentrated frosh polishing called rushing,
twelve months of alumni polishing called "we
want a new house"—is another question.
Or it might be that the Row doesn't give a
damn about grades.
Be the cause any of these, or others, the cold
truth flushed the Row's face this year as per
usual—Stanford fraternities' grade average was
lower than collective Stanford's.
This was all figured out very nicely in the
University's unfathomable grade comparing
system—a set-up not complicated necessarily,
but one which is so widely misunderstood, if it
is even understood, that its terms are campi
versally disregarded as "too deep."
But Interfraternity Council understood "Row
2.3; Campus 2.5; and decided to kick these
erstwhile Crook bodios of theirs off tho dime.

Best way was to start at the root, force pledges
to up their grades to "C" average before they
can bed under the roof of the sanctified tong.
The rule in times past has been: "pledges
must have 'C' average to be initiated." This
gives it some teeth.
It ends the days of the uninitiated soph who
lives on and on in the house, pays less and less,
gets more and more, and goes lower and lower
in the bawlout, until he finally goes out.
The Stanford fraternity can be a powerful
medium for "upping" grades. Tuesday night's
action indicates that its bosses will make it so.
Next fall, when the University's long sheet of
tabulated grade standings appears, the Row
will know whether it needs another self-in
flicted slap.
