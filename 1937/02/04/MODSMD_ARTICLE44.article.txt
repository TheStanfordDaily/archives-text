# OUR HASHER

### 
STANFORD'S own Swiss freshman wanted to join the
nifty and sec the world through a knothole, so he
girded up his automobile and went across the Bay
Bridge recently.
In the midst of the maneuver, he passed with a flour
ish a highway patrol car meandering along the highway
and then slowed down immediately in front of it.
Pretty soon he overtook a car meandering along at
40 miles. With one eye cocked on the police car, he
undertook to pass at the brilliant pace of 70 with horns
blowing and colors flying.
Next event on the program found our Swiss, cock
ing both eyes on the policeman, and meandering him
self down to the speed of 20.
This was too much for the tool of the capitalistic
oppressors, so with sirens blowing and 110 horses of a
different color flying he meandered the 18-jewcl move
ment down to a standstill.
The cop said: "Whaddyathinkthisisanyhow?"
The movement replied: "I just wanted to pass that
car."
"Whadidyaslowdownsoforanyhow?"
"I am from Switzerland," he said, "and I wanted to
admire your pretty scenery. You can't see the pretty
scenery when you drive fast, can you?"
"Nobutlthinkl'llhavetopinchyouanyhow."
"Thanks."
"Whaddyameanthanksanyhow?"
"Thanks for stopping me here so that I can see the
pretty scenery.'"
'0.K.," said the cop, and walked of! anyhow.
