Before Ex Committee Tuesday night Barbara Kim
ball suggested a floor show instead of the Royal CoCTrt
Sequence for the Masque Ball. Then up spoke Roy An
derson, who is from the Econ Department, they tell me:
"Yeh, and you can name it Kimâ€”Kim and her Confer
ence Cuties."
A special courier running night and day through fen
and swamp, hill and dale, has brought in an official com
munique from the D.U. house, which is in reply to last
week's official communique from the Manzanita girls.
The ManzManzthey'reallalikeita girls asserted and
avowed that the room to which all the D.U.'s were pay
ing their nightly benefit belonged to the house mother.
The D.U. communique is terse. They want to know
why Manzanita has four hoyse mothers.
