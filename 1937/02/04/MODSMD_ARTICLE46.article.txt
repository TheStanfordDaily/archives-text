COMMUNISTS! BOO!

has been a lot of twaddle written on the San
Francisco Waterfront strike and what I have said on
the subject to date may have been pretty much guff.
But before the strike is finally settled somebody
should say something about the charge that Commun
ist agitators have thrown Moscow gold along the water
front and have goaded the longshoremen into the pres
ent strike.

The red herring has been tossed at the labor unions
for a long time with the same glib air of ignorance that
has accompanied my recent throwing of the "phoney"
charge at popular schmaltzmusicians.
Communism has always been associated with labor
unions, but Karl Marx has been a sort of fairy god
mother which appeared on the scene only after Cin
derella had grown to be a pretty big girl. The idea is
that labor unions were a going concern long before
Communism came along. Even now, the chief com
munistic aid in the strike seems to come from a group
of intellectual pinks who give mental sympathy to the
unions between mouthfuls of a capitalistic T-bone
steak.

But this bosh about the strike being a battle between
the glorious Stars and Stripes and the dirty Hammer
and Sickle is the twaddle I spoke about.
The whole mess is merely a fight between the haves
and the have-nots. There is an article in the Voice of
the Federation, the t.L.A. paper, which runs something
like this:
"The story goes that Lurline Matson, the only child
of Captain Matson, inherited his millions when he died.
Well, the Matson heiress, having the habit of acquiring
anything her heart desires, has developed a taste for
pedigreed Kentucky race horses. And who pays for
them? You knpw, mateys. There she is with 50 or
more of them. She drags them over the whole country
in private cars.
"The seamen who man the ships are not so lucky.
We travel the rods or the top of a freight. This proves,
my buckos, that we could have been born horses. Bet
ter look to that next time you fellows arc born and
not make the same mistake again.
* * * *
"But to get back to our tale, mateys, at Woodside,
near Redwood City, is a palace with cork floors so that
the tootsies of Lurline's aristocratic horses will have
something soft and springy to walk on. Lurline's sister
was heard to remark recently that. "it. takes all the
Matson Line can make to keep Lurline merely in her
race horses.'
There you have it. mateys. Come hell and high
water and the horses must not be made to suffer. They
SHALL have their cork floors. Tho sister remarked,
'Harry Bridges is a fiend in human form. The long
shoremen are driving the shipping companies to the
wall.' ft is said that half the horses fainted when they
heard of the general strike.
"And this is the tale of Matson profits, which were
$1,307,927 during the depths of the crisis in 1932."

If that is dialectical materialism, then there is a lot
of subtlety in the article that I failed to appreciate.
There may be the general odor of the labor theory ol
value hanging around it all, but somehow I never fig
ured that idea as exclusively Communistic.
It is Westbrook Pegler's idea that the girls who work
in the Woolworth five-and-ten-cent stores may be won
dering now and then why they work to keep Barbara
Hutton well supplied with cash lo attract foreign
princes with unpronounceable names.
