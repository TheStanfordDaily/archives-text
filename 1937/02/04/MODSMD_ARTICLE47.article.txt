AS YOU LIKE IT
At the Mayfield Theater
Combining Shakespeare's plot with
modern directing and improved scen
ery, As You Like It carried out the
motion picture custom of playing up
the love interest to the detriment of
character parts.
Elizabeth Bergner, playing the lead
as Rosalind, kept herself and Cousin

Celia in gales of
laughter and gig
gles over their
problems of es
cape, love and
marriage. Her
timid boldness as
Ganymede was

properly unconvincing for audience
and actors.
Orlando, Laurence Olivier, played
well up to expectations as the unap
preciated younger brother and
younger son. The wrestling scene
with Charles, the usurping duke's
wrestler, took on realistic aspects
when the camera moved in close to
watch young Orlando fall hard on
the board floor of the ring, only to
bound to his feet and take Charles on
his shoulders for an airplane spin
that ended the match.
Best scene in the production came
when Jacques, Leon Quartemain, did
Shakespeare's two masterpieces of
comedy and philosophy, "A fool, a
fool ..." and "All the world's a
stage." The former, played more
quietly and with less actions than is
common, kept the audience laughing
through most of Orlando's hold-up
scenc that followed immediately.
Jacques' second speech was as effec
tively given and even more effective- j
ly photographed. The last two-thirds
of the piece was heard as the camera
watched the expressions on all the
surrounding faces.
By rearranging the scenes some
what, the continuity was carried out
in a more efficient manner. The plot
opened in the stable-yard with Or
lando at table with his brother's
hinds. Next we find Rosalind and
Celia at play in the courtyard. There
follows a scene jn the Forest. All
settings of the play are ready. As

the story goes, the audience can
follow the story with no new scenes
to worry over.
Amusing, fast moving, no longer
than an ordinary feature, "As You
Like It" shows how well modern im
provements fit an old play. Despite
the almost complete obliteration of
the immortal Touchstone, the show
carries every bit of comedy that
Shakespeare intended.
