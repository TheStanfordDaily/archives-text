### Clipped by ALLEN DRURY 
TP WO of Hollywood's best tunesmen
play host to two of the filmetrop
olis's best character-actors tonight.
Paul Lukas, soft-voiced Continent
al last seen as Fran Dodsworth's
lover in the film-version of Lewis'
"Dodsworth" is featured in a skit on
Rudy Vallee's show, to be broadcast
from St. Louis at 5 o'clock on NBC
Red network.
Basil Rath bone, he of the suave
manner and sinister designs, will join
with two other stars to furnish en
tertainment in Bing Crosby's Kraft
Music Hall . . . Basil's most recent
success was in "Garden of Allah"
with Dietrich; he has played with
great acclaim such diverse roles as

the Marquis in "Tale of Two Cities," |
Mr. Murgatroyd in "Copperfield,"
and Karenin to Garbo's Anna Kare
nina. Definitely a good man, whose
popularity is still on the up-grade.
. . . Also present will be Marion
Claire, star of "The Great Waltz,"
and William Frawley from Para
mount . . .
Walter Hampden, one of Amer- j
ica's greatest actors, brings his char
acterization of Rostand's "Cyrano de;
Bergerac" to Lanny Ross's Show
Boat tonight at 8:30 over NBC Blue, j
... To offset Hampden, Molasses
'n' January have thoughtfully pro
vided a skit ent'itled "Shakespeare
Plays as They Should Be Did." Wil
liam can take it, if Walter can , . .
Top place on the Standard Sym
phony Hour at 8:15 goes to Bach's
Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, which !
he composed for the eccentric Mar
grave of Brandenburg. Each section |
is written for a different set of in-!
struments . . . also comes Tchaikov-i
sky's "Romeo and Juliet" overture, |
as well as Brahms' Hungarian i
Dances, "Sarabande" by Debussy,
and several other Tchaikovsky com-
I positions.
