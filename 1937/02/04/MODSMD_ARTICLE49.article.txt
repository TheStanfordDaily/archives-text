# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
ABSOLUTELY NO

The Editor, Sir:
Why in thunder does the Daily
insist upon printing a verbal back
slap for Drama Director Lange
every day?
We have learned that he is the
young messiah, that he is Stanford's
White Hope, that he is very young,
that he plans big things, that he is
very young, that he went to Yale,
that he has all soi'ts of ambitious
ideas, that he is very young, that he
carries a heavy load, and that he is
not very old.
Well, mebbe so. But why this ter
rific build-up? Let's wait and see
what he actually does. Let those who
attend campus plays (a pitiful num
ber, too) form their own opinions
and kindle their own enthusiasm.
You can't make a superlative school
of dramatics merely by using super
latives in describing it.
And when the highly touted Mr.
Lange has a long white beard, and
Stanford dramatics lead the world,
then the Daily can write all the
eulogies it wants, for all I care.
I could tell you that I am planning
to write the Great American Novel,
but chances arc, after reading this,
you'd want to see it first.
