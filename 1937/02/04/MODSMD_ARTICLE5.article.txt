"What this campus needs is a good,
five-cent Kappa" was the slogan in
1930, because 1930 was the only year
in historic times in which a Kappa
was queen of the Masque Ball. It
also was the last year that a queen
was chosen for her beauty or popu
larity. The Kappa was Jean Jami
son.
Her king would have been the
scion to the S.F. Fleishhacker mil
lions. But Herbie's royal ambitions
were spiked on the turn by Dink
Templeton, the shotputter's coach,
who was thinking about the Big
Meet scheduled for the day 'follow
ing the Ball.
King Disqualified
But the Fleischhacker tradition
did not die in vain. Two minutes
before the contest ended, and Her
bie was disqualified, he set the pace
for all contests to follow, when he
tossed into the box a personal check
for $200, which was disqualified later,
along with Fleischhacker. Before
this time, all contributions had been
limited to small amounts. Pennies
were really the basis of the market.
Bids to the Masque Ball were priced
at odd amounts such as $2.41 so that
students would turn in their pennies
on the contest.
But it didn't take long for the cam
pus to catch on to the infinite pos
sibilities of the personal check and
the money-from-home kitty.
Fleischhacker Contest Dinged
The Fleischhacker gesture was
really the final flowering of a pen
nies - from - heaven, hard money,
masculine epoch. The King and
Queen Contest lapsed again.
In the pit of the 1991 depression
(remember?) Ex Committee dinged
both the Contest and the Masque
Ball on the grounds that campus
dances were "not profitable." There
is also the possibility that the Ad
ministration was panting heavily in
the Ex Committee ear.
The Fleischhacker epoch, 1928-
1930, neally had been an interlude in
Masque Ball history. The king was
elected, and then chose his queen,
more or less post-prandially. Jami
son was chosen that way. That's why
she was the last beautiful queen.
But there were seeds laid in that last
decadent gesture, which bore fruit in
the next cycle.


REAL KINGS and QUEENS of the Masque Ball are child patients
at the Convalescent Iloinc.

Fleischhacker Contest Dinged
The Fleischhacker gesture was
really the final flowering of a pen
nies - from - heaven, hard money,
masculine epoch. The King and
Queen Contest lapsed again.
In the pit of the 1991 depression
(remember?) Ex Committee dinged
both the Contest and the Masque
Ball on the grounds that campus
dances were "not profitable." There
is also the possibility that the Ad
ministration was panting heavily in
the Ex Committee ear.
The Fleischhacker epoch, 1928-
1930, neally had been an interlude in
Masque Ball history. The king was
elected, and then chose his queen,
more or less post-prandially. Jami
son was chosen that way. That's why
she was the last beautiful queen.
But there were seeds laid in that last
decadent gesture, which bore fruit in
the next cycle.

"What this campus needs is a good,
five-cent Kappa" was the slogan in
1930, because 1930 was the only year
in historic times in which a Kappa
was queen of the Masque Ball. It
also was the last year that a queen
was chosen for her beauty or popu
larity. The Kappa was Jean Jami
son.
Her king would have been the
scion to the S.F. Fleishhacker mil
lions. But Herbie's royal ambitions
were spiked on the turn by Dink
Templeton, the shotputter's coach,
who was thinking about the Big
Meet scheduled for the day 'follow
ing the Ball.
King Disqualified
But the Fleischhacker tradition
did not die in vain. Two minutes
before the contest ended, and Her
bie was disqualified, he set the pace
for all contests to follow, when he
tossed into the box a personal check
for $200, which was disqualified later,
along with Fleischhacker. Before
this time, all contributions had been
limited to small amounts. Pennies
were really the basis of the market.
Bids to the Masque Ball were priced
at odd amounts such as $2.41 so that
students would turn in their pennies
on the contest.
But it didn't take long for the cam
pus to catch on to the infinite pos
sibilities of the personal check and
the money-from-home kitty.
