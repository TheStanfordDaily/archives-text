The Editor, Sir:
This morning's Daily gave Mr.
Gordon C. Lange a wonderful boost
as a dramatic director and he un
doubtedly deserves the praise. How
ever, there is also a new technical
director working with Mr. Lange
who should not be overlooked. Last
year at the Riverside Junior College
I had the pleasure of seeing some of
the work of Mr. Waldeman Johansen
and his ability along 1 his line is
nothing short of marvelous.
The staging of the play, "This Side
Idolatry," will be one of Ihe most
difficult problems attempted at Stan
ford— there being seven changes of
scene. In order for scenes to be
changed so often, with only a three
minute wait between, Mr. Johansen
is using a revolving unit—a movable
triangular column — which is copy
writed in his name and will be in
corporated into the New Theater.
Such capable technical directing as
this man does surely deserves some
praise along with Mr. Lange.
