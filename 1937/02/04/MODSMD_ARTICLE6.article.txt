# Elected Masque King To Choose Own Queen
## 
### 
The men can take it!
That was the opinion voiced by Cardinals last night, after a unanimous
decision to end the petty controversy over the King-Queen contest by
having a King contest.
Women's Conference wishes will he abided with. There will be no

popularity contest for the women.<
Instead a King will be picked by the
plan originally suggested by the
Cardinals. Ten roughs will be cho
sen as candidates by a popular vote
of the whole student body. Ten cents
will be charged for each ballot.
Masque Ball King will be selected
from these ten by means of a raffleâ€”
the winner to name his own queen.
Relieved at the termination of the
four-week-long squabble, Cardinal
Chairman Chick Franich said: "If
the pride of the Stanford woman is
so high that she cannot submit to
a popularity contest for the benefit
of charity, we will give it back to
the men who can take it. Acquiesced
Cardinal Jeeb Haiaby: "The queen
bee has the hives."
With this problem settled, Cardi
nals turned to appointments for the
management of the Convalescent
Home Drive. In order that these ap
pointments might be made next
week, Franich asked that all stu
dents interested in working on the
drive see him in the A.S.S.U. offices
between 1 and 2 any afternoon this
week.
Only other business was the
okaying of Rally Committee choice
of yell leading tryoutees: George
Egan. Merritt Cutten, Bill Todd, Lo
max Turner, and Dwight and Wayne
Zook.
