# Donor Approves New Bowl Project
## 
### 
Mr. Howard Frost, whose donation
has made possible Stanford's amphi
theater now under construction, upon
viewing the project for the first time
yesterday, said that he is "greatly
pleased" with the appearance of that
project as it now stands.
"Of course," he explained, "it's a
little hard to visualize the completed
job, since most of the trees and
shrubs have yet to be moved in.
But it's certainly up to m yexpecta
tions."
Mr. Frost was accompanied by Dr.
Harry Rimmer, who spoke at the
student-faculty luncheon yesterday.
