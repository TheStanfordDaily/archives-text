RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS on the Farm have declined since January 28 but they may hit a new high.
According to Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of the University Health Service, there is no way of telling if the
flu danger is over.
Cases hit their peak January 1!), as shown in this chart, peaked again on the 2Hth. How many of them
were flu is debatable. Dr. Storey declared, saying that what one doctor may diagnose as flu another will call
an "infection."
On the chart the upper lined section of each column denotes new cases. Extreme fluctuation is common,
