I \URING all the chatter and wail
about the King-Queen contest,
few have considered the basic idio
syncracies of Stanford that not only
make the contest possible, but will in
the long run tend to make similar
affairs inevitable.
For in many ways, Stanford is a
place where competitions involving
social standing and Bradstreet rat
ings will always prevail.
Perhaps the Masque Ball was par
ticularly undesirable release for the
pressure of too much society and too
much money. But it was a release.
If it is blocked, rest assured some
thing else will take its place, perhaps
something more vicious and far more
likely to titillate San Francisco's city
editors.

VjTE ARE thinking not only of an
other ostentatious circus on cam
pus, but of smaller and more exclu
sive circi in city night spots.
The alternative of an increasing
social life off campus, where students
can obey the impulse to spend papa's
dough, is a distinct possibility. And
in its zeal to keep Stanford officially
pure in heart, the University should
remember that Stanford students can
possibly harm themselves much more
off campus, unofficially, than they
can under the Administrative wing.
That is exactly what they might
do if the single campus outlet for the
wealthy and the social is dinged.
Which it has been—not by a direct
blow, but because it has been talked
to death. There isn't a bit of "bounce"
left in the Masque Ball idea.

I jNIVERSITY officials may thank
their stars that the hey-dey of
the "hey hey" era is over and point
to Cardinals as a rah-rah minority,
but if they do, it will be just another
indication of the short-sightedness
that has made Stanford's scandals a
little more juicy and subtly porno
graphic than the scandals of ordinary
schools and ordinary students.
If there is a sensible way of solv
ing this problem of too much money
in too small pockets, it might be to
keep the kids down on the Farm,
regardless of the consequences to the
University, rather than let them tear
off to the City, where their money is
too welcome and a sale too easily
made.
Stanford, as an institution, may
buffer more under the Masque Ball
set-up — which implies University
permission to give a glittering dance
with a periphery thfit swings through
classroom and student alike.
But it will be infinitely better for
the students. At least someone can
open a safety* valve and control
where the money goes and where the
sinning goes on.

this alternative to
the present Administrative at
titude seems strikingly defined. For,
while in one case (the Masque Ball)
the students will be involved and so
will the University, in the case of city
functions, while the students will be
involved, the University will be in
volved only indirectly.
The choice of whether or not to
continue the Masque Ball seems to
us a choice between student welfare
and institutional welfare.
Women's Conference has chosen.
