# Flood Crest Moves On Towns in South
## 
### 
CAIRO, 111., Feb. 4 (UP). — The
crest of the disastrous flood swung
out of the Ohio River into the Missis
sippi today and started on the long
roll down to the Gulf.
In its immediate path were Hick
man, Ky., and New Madrid, Mo., both
protected by walls that are part of
the billion-dollar levee system erect
ed by the United States Army and
scores of river communities.
Farther down Mellwood, Ark.,
braced a shaky dike that rested on
an uncertain foundation of sand.
Helena, Ark.—built below the river
level —bulwarked its flood wall.
