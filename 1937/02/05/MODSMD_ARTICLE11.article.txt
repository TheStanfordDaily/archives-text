SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4 (UP). '
—Pacific Coast maritime workers
called off the longest and most costly
strike in their history today and
notified shipowners they would be
ready to work at 8 o'clock Friday.
It was more of an armistice than a
peace, however, for the end of the
dispute left unsettled a number of
loose ends likely to cause trouble in
the future.
At the last minute an attempt was
made to delay settlement until the
shipyard question had been settled.
But Harry Bridges, district president
of the International Longshoremen's
Association and the man to whom
the public looked as the leader of the
strike, succeeded in overruling the
attempt.
