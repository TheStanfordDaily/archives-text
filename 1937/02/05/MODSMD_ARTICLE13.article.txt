# Strike Ends but Union Sailors Prefer Cellar
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
Two ex-sailors arc spending an enforced shore-leave hashing in the
Union Cellar.
Now that the seamen's strike is over, Don Freeman isn't so sure that
he'll go back to the bounding waves. "Working conditions and everything
else are lots better at Stanford," he said. "I might stay."

* Another Union hasher is Aubrey
Edgington, erstwhile British sailor.
"This strike?" he exclaimed. "Why
it never bothered me! I've been
through six strikes."
Edgington doesn't think much of
American labor organization. "The
American union heads don't care for
the workers—just for themselves,"
he averred.
This is Don Freeman's second
strike. He spent the other — last
year's—on the picket line£
Likes Navy
Don was in the U.S. Navy for four
years, before joining the merchant
marine five years ago. When ex-
President Hoover made his good will
trip to South America on the U.S.S.
Maryland, Freeman was down below
checking pumps, boilers, and air
pressure. He is a fireman.
"The navy was swell compared to
the merchant marine," said he. "It
only paid $60 per month, though. The
other pays $65."
Australian Goal
If salt water finally wins over
milkshakes, Freeman will quit the
Cellar about March 1. "It'll take at
least a month to straighten this out,
because so many men are tied up."
Aubrey, who styles himself a sol
dier of fortune, intends moving on to
Australia in the spring.
When these sailor-hashers call for
their final "'leven sundaes" and re
turn to their regular callings, the
Union will have lost what Cellar
Manager Tapp calls "the very best
hashers we ever had."
