# Lagunita Fills; Campus Needs Mood Relief

Lake Lagunita may overflow!
Late last night the lake was ac
tually full, and if Che storm continues
there is danger that water may run
over its banks.
Two inches of water stand in the
kitchen of the Encina basement store.
Whether the region occupied by
Roble and Lagunita Court will be
placed in a disastrous situation simi
lar to that in the Ohio River Valley
at the present time is doubtful.
With the water level but one inch
from the top. Lake Lagunita was of
ficially pronounced open for boating
yesterday by Ernie Brandsten, di
rector of water sports. Swimming
will be prohibited until the weather
clears and the temperature of the
water rises.
Lagunita is open for boating and
canoeing every day from 10 to 10,
and living groups may bring their
canoes to the boathouse for storage at
any time now. Absolutely no canoe
may go out on the lake without a
life preserver, to be supplied by the
owner.
Meanwhile, it remained a moot
point whether the long-hoped-for
high water would prove disastrous.
Sequoia reports water in its base
ment to a depth of three inches. This
much water is always there, the re
port continued.
