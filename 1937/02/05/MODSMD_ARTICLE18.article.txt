# Yost To Entertain Foreign Students
## 
### 
All foreign students on the campus
will be entertained at an informal
party Sunday evening from 7:30 to
9:30 o'clock at the home of Dean
Mary Yost. The party is being given
under the auspices of the Interna
tional Relation Committee, headed
by Betty McClintock.
This is one of the first organized
attempts to bring the foreign stu
dents in contact with others on the
campus. Students who have shown
an interest in the purposes of the
committee have also been invited.
