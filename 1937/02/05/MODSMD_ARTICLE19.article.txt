# Bunn Calls Team 'Mentally Right' For Today's Tilt
## Coach Says End of Undefeated Streak Has Loosened Tension 
### GORDY FROST 
"We're mentally right for California tonight—right for the first time
since we played L.1.U."
It was Coach John Bunn talking, explaining his reasoning for an ear
lier remark to the effect that Stanford's varsity basketball team is
primed to play its top-notch game of the season tonight when California's

revenge-seeking Bears invade the
Stanford Pavilion.
Opening whistle-time tonight is
set for 8 o'clock, and referees will
first blast at the same time tomorrow
night in the San Francisco Civic Au
ditorium when Stanford plays U.S.F.
for flood charity.
Bunn was not just talking when he
declared "we're mentally right," his
statement was based upon a bit of
expert reasoning coupled with ob
servation. His thesis runs like this.
Until Stanford played, and de
feated, the touted Long Island Uni
versity, Stanford was known as
"Bunn's laughing boys." There was
no tension, even on the eve of a
critical game.
No Laughs
Then came the victory that tight
ened Stanford like a drum, even
tightened their vocal cords so that
laughs were less frequent. Stanford
became the undefeated Stanford and

each game a hazard to that record—
until the Walls of Troy were too
strong last week-end.
But last night these Redshirts were
laughing again, and they'll laugh to
night before, and, barring unforeseen
difficulties, after the Bears have trod
the hardwood. For the Rolling Red
men are, according to Bunn, "men
tally set."
Poor Physical Shape
Physically, Stanford is not quite as
well off. Services of Howie Turner
ax - e out of the question tonight—in
practice yesterday his foot injury was
still causing him considerable
trouble.
Hank Luisetti is battling a "cold,"
but will start tonight. Bunn held a
few minutes of quick-break drill
yesterday to give Luisetti opportu
nity to loosen up—his first real work
out since the Saturday night U.S.C.
affair of last week.
Art Stoefen at center, Jack Calder
wood and H. B. Lee at guards, and
Dinty Moore at the other forward
position are all in A-l condition.

each game a hazard to that record—
until the Walls of Troy were too
strong last week-end.
But last night these Redshirts were
laughing again, and they'll laugh to
night before, and, barring unforeseen
difficulties, after the Bears have trod

Poor Physical Shape
Physically, Stanford is not quite as
well off. Services of Howie Turner
ax - e out of the question tonight—in
practice yesterday his foot injury was
still causing him considerable
trouble.
Hank Luisetti is battling a "cold,"
but will start tonight. Bunn held a
few minutes of quick-break drill
yesterday to give Luisetti opportu
nity to loosen up—his first real work
out since the Saturday night U.S.C.
affair of last week.
Art Stoefen at center, Jack Calder
wood and H. B. Lee at guards, and
Dinty Moore at the other forward
position are all in A-l condition.
