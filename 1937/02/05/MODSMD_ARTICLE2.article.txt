# Contest Awaits Ex Committee Nod
## 
### 
With Wednesday night's decision of
Cardinals to have a King contest—no
Queen contest —'the month-old
squabble about popularity contests,
and monetary considerations came to
an end.
Women's Conference meets Mon
day night, but according to Chairman
Barbara Kimball, there will be no
time for anything but plans for
"County Fair," which will take place
on the following day.
This leaves the road clear for an
okaying of the Cardinals' minutes on
Tuesday night and a final decision on
all Masque Ball plans. '
