After the 1931 lapse, the direct
money election of the queen re
turned, but king and queen were
paired and ran together in teams.
The Hewlett-personal check era,
1932-1933, was, therefore, a transi
tional stage to the return of the sep
arate election of the King and Queen
in the Great Beaubaire age to follow.
The Hewlett-personal check era
started out with a bang. All things
started by Marion Hewlett did. Her
name spelled energy. She was every
where fit once. Her metabolism rate
was phenomenal. She was the apoth
eosis of the campus activity woman.
There hasn't been anything to touch
it before or since. And everyone
liked her.
Hewlett was from the Pi Phi
stables. But the last minute personal
checks in this contest did not come
so much from her own family, which
was in cloaks and suits in the City,
and mighty profitably, too, but from
a certain Nichol-plated Smith, of the
Chi Psi Lodge. Just as Hewlett
reached her fullest flower on the
campus, and then disappeared into
the oblivion of married life, so did
Nichol Smith never get over being a
Chi Psi. When last heard he was
recounting his world travels over a
San Francisco radio station.
Hewlette and King Prelsnik re
putedly spent the' whole afternoon
before the Ball abandoning the alka
line side and switching white horses
in the middle of the stream, at Pete's,
vho was Stanford's humidifier dur
ing the days of Prohibition.
The overwhelming support given
the Hewlett-Prelsnik ticket during
che race had to be continued the
night of the ball. This resulted in
,he overwhelming withdrawal of
support by the Administration on the
ollowing morning. Prelsnik was ex
ounged from the record for a few
brief months, and then sneaked back
again, quiet like a mouse, to become
a campus hero and a milestone in the
moist history of the ball.
Hewlett, didn't quite have the
metabolism to run for queen the
next year, so she managed Rose Cub
bison. known as the Colonel's daugh
ter. Smith again underwrote the
party. Cubbison was the last in a
string of six Pi Phis, broken only by
Jamison's igneous intrusion.

The Hewlett-personal check era,
1932-1933, was, therefore, a transi
tional stage to the return of the sep
arate election of the King and Queen
in the Great Beaubaire age to follow.
The Hewlett-personal check era
started out with a bang. All things
started by Marion Hewlett did. Her
name spelled energy. She was every
where fit once. Her metabolism rate
was phenomenal. She was the apoth
eosis of the campus activity woman.
There hasn't been anything to touch
it before or since. And everyone
liked her.
Hewlett was from the Pi Phi
stables. But the last minute personal
checks in this contest did not come
so much from her own family, which
was in cloaks and suits in the City,
and mighty profitably, too, but from
a certain Nichol-plated Smith, of the
Chi Psi Lodge. Just as Hewlett
reached her fullest flower on the
campus, and then disappeared into
the oblivion of married life, so did
Nichol Smith never get over being a
Chi Psi. When last heard he was
recounting his world travels over a
San Francisco radio station.
Hewlette and King Prelsnik re
putedly spent the' whole afternoon
before the Ball abandoning the alka
line side and switching white horses
in the middle of the stream, at Pete's,
vho was Stanford's humidifier dur
ing the days of Prohibition.
The overwhelming support given
the Hewlett-Prelsnik ticket during
che race had to be continued the
night of the ball. This resulted in
,he overwhelming withdrawal of
support by the Administration on the
ollowing morning. Prelsnik was ex
ounged from the record for a few
brief months, and then sneaked back
again, quiet like a mouse, to become
a campus hero and a milestone in the
moist history of the ball.
Hewlett, didn't quite have the
metabolism to run for queen the
next year, so she managed Rose Cub
bison. known as the Colonel's daugh
ter. Smith again underwrote the
party. Cubbison was the last in a
string of six Pi Phis, broken only by
Jamison's igneous intrusion.

After the 1931 lapse, the direct
money election of the queen re
turned, but king and queen were
paired and ran together in teams.
