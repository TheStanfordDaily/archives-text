For the nights of February 12 and

place will be the Assembly Hall and
the time will be some time after 8:30
o'clock, when the curtain rises on the
second scene of "This Side Idolatry,"
Dramatic Council's winter quarter
presentation.
The set portrays Club Deptford, a
gay Elizabethan gathering place,
where Shakespeare and Marlowe
meet with Diana Mauteby and Mary
Fitton, the famous dark woman in
Shakespeare's life. In accordance
with the custom of the time, both
women will wear black domino
masks.
The distinctive features of this nit
ery are a huge archway opening on
beautiful gardens, a window view of
the masts and spars of old English
ships, and a group of strolling mu
sicians.
Six separate sets have been de
signed for the production by Tech
nical Director Waldemar Johansen.
In addition to the night club, these
include the stage of the Globe The
ater, an interior of Shakespeare's
home, Southampton's town house,
Shakespeare's workshop, and the
lodgings Marlowe.
