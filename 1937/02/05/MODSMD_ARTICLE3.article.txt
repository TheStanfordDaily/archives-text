# Petition Reopens Nitery Question; 15 Nominees Quit
## Special Committee Vote Needed To Put Issue Before Student Body 
### 
What may become the most con
troversial issue in next Tuesday's
election appeared out of a clear sky
yesterday when a resolution calling
for a Lagunita nitery was thrown
across Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius' desk signed by 180 persons.
The resolution, submitted by Bill
Ward, read as follows: "The Execu
tive Committee shall construct a
recreation center on the shore of
Lake Lagunita, the cost of which
shall not exceed $10,000, to be derived
from the surplus funds of the A. S.
S. U."
Petition Required
Whether the resolution will appear
on next week's ballot could not be
determined definitely last night. Ac
cording to the A.S.S.U. Constitution,
a petition for student-body vote must
first be presented to Ex Committee,
which does not meet again until after
the election Tuesday night. A poll of
the Committee's 12 members might
be taken by telephone today, but
President Reynolds, who must decide
on the telephone poll, was not on
campus yesterday.
Special Election Needed
If Ex Committee does not consider
Ward's petition until Tuesday night,
a special election must be called
within two weeks--a Constitutional
ruling. Vice-President Esther Pel
ton, who left the campus last night
for the week-end, was favorable to
taking a phone poll and putting the
nitery question on Tuesday's regu
lar ballot.
Both Fontius and former Ex Com
mittee member Don Hanson told The
Daily they thought the measure un
constitutional. "It doesn't seem to me
that our constitution gives the stu
dent body the power to bankrupt the
A.5.5.U.," said Fontius, in pointing
out that he could find no provision
in the constitution by which stu
dents could force the Executive
Committee to make expenditures.
Fontius further objected to the pe
tition on the grounds that it was too
indefinite. "We could spend $10,000
or we could put up a tent with a
billiard table in it and call that a
recreation center," he said. "I'd ad
vise at least waiting until the campus
has had more time to get both sides
of the question."
Hall People Sign \
The petition was signed almost en
tirely by Hall residents. It wps cir
culated Wednesday night by Mary
Blake in Roble, by Rovena Conn in
Lagunita, by Henry Hughes, student
architect who designed the plans, in
Sequoia, by Bill Ward in Encina, and
by Burt Goodman, Toyon president,

the election Tuesday night. A poll of
the Committee's 12 members might
be taken by telephone today, but
President Reynolds, who must decide
on the telephone poll, was not on
campus yesterday.
Special Election Needed
If Ex Committee does not consider
Ward's petition until Tuesday night,
a special election must be called
within two weeks--a Constitutional
ruling. Vice-President Esther Pel
ton, who left the campus last night
for the week-end, was favorable to
taking a phone poll and putting the
nitery question on Tuesday's regu
lar ballot.
Both Fontius and former Ex Com
mittee member Don Hanson told The
Daily they thought the measure un
constitutional. "It doesn't seem to me
that our constitution gives the stu
dent body the power to bankrupt the
A.5.5.U.," said Fontius, in pointing
out that he could find no provision
in the constitution by which stu
dents could force the Executive
Committee to make expenditures.
Fontius further objected to the pe
tition on the grounds that it was too
indefinite. "We could spend $10,000
or we could put up a tent with a
billiard table in it and call that a
recreation center," he said. "I'd ad
vise at least waiting until the campus
has had more time to get both sides
of the question."
Hall People Sign \
The petition was signed almost en
tirely by Hall residents. It wps cir
culated Wednesday night by Mary
Blake in Roble, by Rovena Conn in
Lagunita, by Henry Hughes, student
architect who designed the plans, in
Sequoia, by Bill Ward in Encina, and

Fontius further objected to the pe

of the question."

What may become the most con
troversial issue in next Tuesday's
election appeared out of a clear sky
yesterday when a resolution calling
for a Lagunita nitery was thrown
across Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius' desk signed by 180 persons.
The resolution, submitted by Bill
Ward, read as follows: "The Execu
tive Committee shall construct a
recreation center on the shore of
Lake Lagunita, the cost of which
shall not exceed $10,000, to be derived
from the surplus funds of the A. S.
S. U."
Petition Required
Whether the resolution will appear
on next week's ballot could not be
determined definitely last night. Ac
cording to the A.S.S.U. Constitution,
a petition for student-body vote must
first be presented to Ex Committee,
which does not meet again until after
the election Tuesday night. A poll of
the Committee's 12 members might
be taken by telephone today, but
President Reynolds, who must decide
on the telephone poll, was not on
campus yesterday.
Special Election Needed
If Ex Committee does not consider
Ward's petition until Tuesday night,
a special election must be called
within two weeks--a Constitutional
ruling. Vice-President Esther Pel
ton, who left the campus last night
for the week-end, was favorable to
taking a phone poll and putting the
nitery question on Tuesday's regu
lar ballot.
Both Fontius and former Ex Com
mittee member Don Hanson told The
Daily they thought the measure un
constitutional. "It doesn't seem to me
that our constitution gives the stu
dent body the power to bankrupt the
A.5.5.U.," said Fontius, in pointing
out that he could find no provision
in the constitution by which stu
dents could force the Executive
Committee to make expenditures.
Fontius further objected to the pe

indefinite. "We could spend $10,000

What may become the most con
troversial issue in next Tuesday's
election appeared out of a clear sky
yesterday when a resolution calling
for a Lagunita nitery was thrown
across Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius' desk signed by 180 persons.
The resolution, submitted by Bill
Ward, read as follows: "The Execu
tive Committee shall construct a
recreation center on the shore of
Lake Lagunita, the cost of which
shall not exceed $10,000, to be derived
from the surplus funds of the A. S.
S. U."
Petition Required
Whether the resolution will appear
on next week's ballot could not be
determined definitely last night. Ac
cording to the A.S.S.U. Constitution,
a petition for student-body vote must
first be presented to Ex Committee,
which does not meet again until after
the election Tuesday night. A poll of
the Committee's 12 members might
be taken by telephone today, but
President Reynolds, who must decide
on the telephone poll, was not on
campus yesterday.
Special Election Needed
If Ex Committee does not consider
Ward's petition until Tuesday night,
a special election must be called
within two weeks--a Constitutional
ruling. Vice-President Esther Pel
ton, who left the campus last night
for the week-end, was favorable to
taking a phone poll and putting the
nitery question on Tuesday's regu
lar ballot.
Both Fontius and former Ex Com
mittee member Don Hanson told The
Daily they thought the measure un
constitutional. "It doesn't seem to me
that our constitution gives the stu
dent body the power to bankrupt the
A.5.5.U.," said Fontius, in pointing
out that he could find no provision
in the constitution by which stu
dents could force the Executive
Committee to make expenditures.
Fontius further objected to the pe
tition on the grounds that it was too
indefinite. "We could spend $10,000
or we could put up a tent with a
billiard table in it and call that a
recreation center," he said. "I'd ad
vise at least waiting until the campus
has had more time to get both sides
of the question."
Hall People Sign \
The petition was signed almost en
tirely by Hall residents. It wps cir
culated Wednesday night by Mary
Blake in Roble, by Rovena Conn in
Lagunita, by Henry Hughes, student
architect who designed the plans, in
Sequoia, by Bill Ward in Encina, and

What may become the most con
troversial issue in next Tuesday's
election appeared out of a clear sky
yesterday when a resolution calling
for a Lagunita nitery was thrown
across Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius' desk signed by 180 persons.
The resolution, submitted by Bill
Ward, read as follows: "The Execu
tive Committee shall construct a
recreation center on the shore of
Lake Lagunita, the cost of which
shall not exceed $10,000, to be derived
from the surplus funds of the A. S.
S. U."
Petition Required
Whether the resolution will appear
on next week's ballot could not be
determined definitely last night. Ac
cording to the A.S.S.U. Constitution,
a petition for student-body vote must
first be presented to Ex Committee,
which does not meet again until after
the election Tuesday night. A poll of
the Committee's 12 members might
be taken by telephone today, but
President Reynolds, who must decide
on the telephone poll, was not on
campus yesterday.
Special Election Needed
If Ex Committee does not consider
Ward's petition until Tuesday night,
a special election must be called
within two weeks--a Constitutional
ruling. Vice-President Esther Pel
ton, who left the campus last night
for the week-end, was favorable to
taking a phone poll and putting the
nitery question on Tuesday's regu
lar ballot.
Both Fontius and former Ex Com
mittee member Don Hanson told The
Daily they thought the measure un
constitutional. "It doesn't seem to me
that our constitution gives the stu
dent body the power to bankrupt the
A.5.5.U.," said Fontius, in pointing
out that he could find no provision
in the constitution by which stu
dents could force the Executive
Committee to make expenditures.
Fontius further objected to the pe
tition on the grounds that it was too
indefinite. "We could spend $10,000
or we could put up a tent with a
billiard table in it and call that a
recreation center," he said. "I'd ad
vise at least waiting until the campus
has had more time to get both sides
of the question."
Hall People Sign \
The petition was signed almost en
tirely by Hall residents. It wps cir
culated Wednesday night by Mary
Blake in Roble, by Rovena Conn in
Lagunita, by Henry Hughes, student
architect who designed the plans, in
Sequoia, by Bill Ward in Encina, and
by Burt Goodman, Toyon president,
