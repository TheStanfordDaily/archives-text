# Sophs Picked To Win Class Swim Meet
## Contests To Be Staged In Encina Pools At 2:00 p.m. Tomorrow 
### 
From time immemorial sports]
writers have stuck their necks out
predicting everything from turtle j
races to how the horses will run.
Wanting to be in keeping with the i
rest of the suckers, this writer is go- j
ing to hang way out of the window ;
by trying to call the Interclass swim- !
ming meet to be staged in Encina
Pools tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock.
Team On and Oil*
Nort Thornton's paddlers have'
been oft' and on all during practice, i
One day an amphibian looks hot and
the next day the same swimmer looks
like a burn, which isn't going to make
this prognosticating job any easier.
The Class of '39 should win the
meet with ease. In fact, we look for!
it to score nearly twice as many j
points as its nearest rival, the seniors, i
The battle for second place should be |
interesting with the seniors fighting
off the efforts of the juniors. The!
down-trodden frosh will practically \
be extinguished tomorrow. They j
shouldn't make over a half dozen j
points.
We are going into this thing even I
deeper by saying that the sophs will '
come through with first places in i
eight of the nine events. We pick ,
Winfield Needham to take the 2201
and 440, but Mr. Dave Rider, junior,!
may have something to say about 1
both of those races. Don Peterson,j
senior, may upset them both in the I
220.
We also pick Dick Clarke to speed
to a double victory in the 50 and 100- -
yard dashes. Seniors Alec McKenzie i
and Captain Martin Scatena and |
Junior Jack Vibert will be in there
trying to prove us wrong.
The Winners
Hal Weatherbe should win the 150-
yard backstroke, although he'll have
to move to beat Frosh Jack Read.
Don Towne will win easily in the j
200-yard breast-stroke and Sopho
more Bill Hatch should take second I
honors.
Roy Winkelman has five points \
sewed up in the diving event, al
though Grad Tom Boothe will be
there to give an exhibition and make !
things interesting.
The Class of '39 300-yard medley i
relay team of Weatherbe, Towne, |
and Clarke should coast to a win.
This leaves the 400-yard free-style '
relay. In this event the senior team !
of Hoover, Peterson, Scatena, and j
MacKenzie should break up the soph |
scoring spree. They're undefeated in
three years of interclass competition.

races to how the horses will run.
Wanting to be in keeping with the i
rest of the suckers, this writer is go- j
ing to hang way out of the window ;
by trying to call the Interclass swim- !
ming meet to be staged in Encina
Pools tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock.
Team On and Oil*
Nort Thornton's paddlers have'
been oft' and on all during practice, i
One day an amphibian looks hot and
the next day the same swimmer looks
like a burn, which isn't going to make
this prognosticating job any easier.
The Class of '39 should win the
meet with ease. In fact, we look for!
it to score nearly twice as many j
points as its nearest rival, the seniors, i
The battle for second place should be |
interesting with the seniors fighting
off the efforts of the juniors. The!
down-trodden frosh will practically \
be extinguished tomorrow. They j
shouldn't make over a half dozen j
points.
We are going into this thing even I
deeper by saying that the sophs will '
come through with first places in i
eight of the nine events. We pick ,
Winfield Needham to take the 2201
and 440, but Mr. Dave Rider, junior,!
may have something to say about 1
both of those races. Don Peterson,j
senior, may upset them both in the I
220.
We also pick Dick Clarke to speed
to a double victory in the 50 and 100- -
yard dashes. Seniors Alec McKenzie i
and Captain Martin Scatena and |
Junior Jack Vibert will be in there
trying to prove us wrong.
The Winners
Hal Weatherbe should win the 150-
yard backstroke, although he'll have
to move to beat Frosh Jack Read.
Don Towne will win easily in the j
200-yard breast-stroke and Sopho
more Bill Hatch should take second I
honors.
Roy Winkelman has five points \
sewed up in the diving event, al
though Grad Tom Boothe will be
there to give an exhibition and make !
things interesting.
The Class of '39 300-yard medley i
relay team of Weatherbe, Towne, |
and Clarke should coast to a win.
This leaves the 400-yard free-style '
relay. In this event the senior team !
of Hoover, Peterson, Scatena, and j
MacKenzie should break up the soph |
scoring spree. They're undefeated in
three years of interclass competition.
From time immemorial sports]
writers have stuck their necks out
predicting everything from turtle j
races to how the horses will run.
