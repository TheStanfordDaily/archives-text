EVEN JOHN BUNN
THINKS IT'S GREAT
There are just two classes of peo
ple, outside of the law, who will get
into the San Francisco Civic Audi
torium tomorrow night without put
ting down some of the old sugar—the
players and the managers.
Even Genial John Bunn isn't go
ing to be able to see his team play
without having paid a dollar to get
by the guards. Mighty queer, some
will say, that a coach has to pay his
way in to see and to direct his own
team.
Well, maybe it is queer. The city
is donating the auditorium for the
evening, the gentlemen of the press
are paying just like everyone else,
none of the players get a single
complimentary ticket for the folks—
including Hank Luisetti, in spite of
reports to the contrary—but it seems
unusual to charge the coach of the
team donating its services a regular
admission price.
However, there is plenty of justifi
cation for the move. Those people in
the flood alfcng the Ohio and Missis
sippi Rivers need the help cofning
from the receipts, if anyone ever did.
And any guy that says, "Well, that
flood's their tough luck," ought to be

shot without waiting for sunrise.
DANGEROUS, NIBS,
SHARP TURN AHEAD
In that Cal game tonight, Nibs
Price and the Bears, whether they
think so or not, are liable to get one
of the worst lickings they will ever
have. Last night in practice the In
dians were so utterly relaxed, care
free, and at the same time confident
and raring to go that there are bat
talions of fireworks very, very im
minent.
All through the season so far the
team hasn't shown the spirit and
happy-go-lucky attitude that was
present last night. Before that loss
last Friday night things were tense
and getting tenser daily. With the
defeat came a relaxation that showed
up in the next night's vindicating
win.
Sports writers the nation over got
that "Laughing Boys" thing in their
minds when the Cards beat L.I.U. in
Madison Square Garden during
Christmas vacation, while joking
throughout the game, but they
should have seen Luisetti and Stoef
en playing Moore and Calderwood in
a game of "hunch" last night.
The four champions were just
playing for fun—they weren't even
supposed to come out for practice,
but John Bunn couldn't keep them
off the floor. They had plenty of fun,
and they figure on having some to
night.

cation for the move. Those people in
the flood alfcng the Ohio and Missis
sippi Rivers need the help cofning
from the receipts, if anyone ever did.
And any guy that says, "Well, that
flood's their tough luck," ought to be

shot without waiting for sunrise.
DANGEROUS, NIBS,
SHARP TURN AHEAD
In that Cal game tonight, Nibs
Price and the Bears, whether they
think so or not, are liable to get one
of the worst lickings they will ever
have. Last night in practice the In
dians were so utterly relaxed, care
free, and at the same time confident
and raring to go that there are bat
talions of fireworks very, very im
minent.
All through the season so far the
team hasn't shown the spirit and
happy-go-lucky attitude that was
present last night. Before that loss
last Friday night things were tense
and getting tenser daily. With the
defeat came a relaxation that showed
up in the next night's vindicating
win.
Sports writers the nation over got
that "Laughing Boys" thing in their
minds when the Cards beat L.I.U. in
Madison Square Garden during
Christmas vacation, while joking
throughout the game, but they
should have seen Luisetti and Stoef
en playing Moore and Calderwood in
a game of "hunch" last night.
The four champions were just
playing for fun—they weren't even
supposed to come out for practice,
but John Bunn couldn't keep them
off the floor. They had plenty of fun,
and they figure on having some to
night.

EVEN JOHN BUNN
THINKS IT'S GREAT
There are just two classes of peo
ple, outside of the law, who will get
into the San Francisco Civic Audi
torium tomorrow night without put
ting down some of the old sugar—the
players and the managers.
Even Genial John Bunn isn't go
ing to be able to see his team play
without having paid a dollar to get
by the guards. Mighty queer, some
will say, that a coach has to pay his
way in to see and to direct his own
team.
Well, maybe it is queer. The city
is donating the auditorium for the
evening, the gentlemen of the press
are paying just like everyone else,
none of the players get a single
complimentary ticket for the folks—
including Hank Luisetti, in spite of
reports to the contrary—but it seems
unusual to charge the coach of the
team donating its services a regular
admission price.
However, there is plenty of justifi
cation for the move. Those people in
the flood alfcng the Ohio and Missis
sippi Rivers need the help cofning
from the receipts, if anyone ever did.
