# Frosh Quintet Set for Game With Cal Cubs
## Pavilion To Be Scene Of First Little Big Game; Stars Out of Line-up 
### 
Taking a rest for the day, Wytze |
Gorter's frosh hoopsters bided their j
time until tonight at 6:150 o'clock, j
when they will roar out onto the j
Pavilion hardwood for the first little I
Big Game of the year against the !
Cal Cubs.
Mentor Wytze, while a wee bit i
hampered by the loss of Forward Ted
Lyon from his starting line-up, was
satisfied with the showing made by
the quintet of Siebert, Lafaille,
Stahle, Anderson, and Rahn against
San Mateo Jaysee Wednesday
After a furiously-fought battle, the
frosh kept their undefeated status in- j
tact, coming out on top, 51-38. That {
win made the seventh straight for the j
yearlings.
Coach Bill Higgins of the Cubs will j
not be presenting a full-strength ;
team, as the baby bears will be minus
the services of his fast forward,
George Jung, who is definitely out of
the game with a knee injury. Start- j
ing for the Cubs will be high-scoring <
Bill Biggerstaft' at center, Dudley J
Morgan and Van Horn at forwards,;
and Walt Bickerton and Earl Ford at i
guards.
Saturday night the frosh will join '
their varsity brothers at San Fran- j
cisco's Civic Auditorium, where they I
will play the U.S.F. freshman and j
varsity teams, respectively, for flood I
relief. The frosh game will start at
6:30.
