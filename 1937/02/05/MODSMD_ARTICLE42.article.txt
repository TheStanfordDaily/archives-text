# Why Not Hall-Row Split?
## 
### 
THAT "dasiardly" Hall-Row split is with us
again. '
Solon O. Swampum, the Daily's political
'jrystal-gazer, began his predications this week
n anticipation of the coming A.S.S.U. elections.
Hall and Row factions, according to the com
mentator, have groomed their candidates and
are already lining them up to fill the vacant
jtudent-body posts.
The living groups are dividing, this year as
overy year, into two camps—Hall and Row.
Which is as it should be.
Last spring when politically - minded Hall
cophomores attempted to hold an all-class cau
cus to nominate its officers, they finally had
!o deprive Row representatives of their votes
before anything could be done. The Hall-Row
Taction was there, they found, but they still
thought it should be eliminated. A commiittee
was appointed to find some system which
would rid class politics, and subsequently all
A.S.S.U. politics, of the "monster."
Almost a year has passed. Yesterday the
committee had still found nothing to stamp out
he Hall-Row evil—an all-class picnic was the
only thing they felt would bring the class of
'38 together. Forget about politics, they said,
we'll never get over Hall-Row rivalries.
What these idealistic reformers probably
don't admit, however, is that the Hall-Row "evil"
is not an evil. What nearly every embryo
Tweed refuses to admit is that the Hall-Row
split does more good than harm, is the natural
division in Stanford student politics.
Student government is useless in itself. Its
only good lies in training students in "citizen
ship"—which seems to be, in the main, parti
san politics. It is inevitable that good govern
ment demands partisanship. And at Stanford,
where no natural division over policy exists—
God knows Stanford officers have no real "pol
icies"—the student body tends to split by liv
ing groups.
How much better this split than one by wealth
or social standing. Rave if you will about get
ting "men of ability" into offce. The Hall-Row
faction system doesn't preclude that. It is up
to the separate factions to nominate these "men
of ability."
Whether they have in the past, or this time,
is another question.—D. B.

THAT "dasiardly" Hall-Row split is with us
again. '
Solon O. Swampum, the Daily's political
'jrystal-gazer, began his predications this week
n anticipation of the coming A.S.S.U. elections.
Hall and Row factions, according to the com
mentator, have groomed their candidates and
are already lining them up to fill the vacant
jtudent-body posts.
The living groups are dividing, this year as
overy year, into two camps—Hall and Row.
Which is as it should be.
Last spring when politically - minded Hall
cophomores attempted to hold an all-class cau
cus to nominate its officers, they finally had
!o deprive Row representatives of their votes
before anything could be done. The Hall-Row
Taction was there, they found, but they still
thought it should be eliminated. A commiittee
was appointed to find some system which
would rid class politics, and subsequently all
A.S.S.U. politics, of the "monster."
Almost a year has passed. Yesterday the
committee had still found nothing to stamp out
he Hall-Row evil—an all-class picnic was the
only thing they felt would bring the class of
'38 together. Forget about politics, they said,
we'll never get over Hall-Row rivalries.
What these idealistic reformers probably
don't admit, however, is that the Hall-Row "evil"
is not an evil. What nearly every embryo
Tweed refuses to admit is that the Hall-Row
split does more good than harm, is the natural
division in Stanford student politics.
Student government is useless in itself. Its
only good lies in training students in "citizen
ship"—which seems to be, in the main, parti
san politics. It is inevitable that good govern
ment demands partisanship. And at Stanford,
where no natural division over policy exists—
God knows Stanford officers have no real "pol
icies"—the student body tends to split by liv
ing groups.
How much better this split than one by wealth
or social standing. Rave if you will about get
ting "men of ability" into offce. The Hall-Row
faction system doesn't preclude that. It is up
to the separate factions to nominate these "men
of ability."
Whether they have in the past, or this time,
is another question.—D. B.
