# "Panhandler" Is a Horrid Word

LEAVING their excellent intentions out of it,
the men who are getting money for Stanford
are also getting in the public's hair.
And not because there are too many men,
but because they represent too many fund
getting organizations.
Just a glance at the literature on alumni desks
all over the country today shows five separate
outfits are approaching the public for money.
If you are interested in football, you might
throw in for the Buck-of-the-Month Club. You
might also recognize the plea of Stanford Asso
ciates.
But it wouldn't end there. The David Starr
Jordan Memorial Fund might have passed the
hat under your nose at a banquet on January
19, and later the Student Loan Fund managed
by Bob Levison, and Stanford Associates con
ducting their 50th anniversary drive under Big
Jim Reynolds might have slapped a pleading
hand on your wallet pocket.
So if the public asks "What kind of a pan
handling scheme is this?" the question is not
pure insolence. Remember that the non-inter

ested man can't be expected to keep all of the
different outfits straight.
They all have different aims, but they all
imply the name Stanford in their titles.—And
that implication makes them seem identical.
Which is nothing new to the fund-getter. For
Tuesday representatives of the different or
ganizations met with Dr. Wilbur to determine
which should pull in its horns. They all agree
someone must do it. The question is, who.
And if human nature is any criterion, it'll be
the other fellow. For all of them are jockeying
desperately to get the mostest of the bestest
coin—and all want their cake, uneaten.
We won't even hint our opinion as to who
has the strongest claim to exclusive territory or
eminent domain, for the mouths are opening
and closing rapidly, and with enough force to
break our slender neck.
All we say is, Ex Committee's Committees
are in the same spot as the alumni committees
—necessarily a terrific amount of work to do,
but unnecessarily too much work in the doing
of it.
