¥N SAN FRANCISCO a few days ago they picked up
a guy for driving with only one license. Just the
other day, I notice they picked up his brother driving
with the other one.
This situation was paralleled to some extent on the
campus at the Phi Kap house. One of the brothers re
ceived his plates by mail. Not noticing that they were
tightly stuck together, he bolted both of them on the
back. Now he's afraid to use his car because,he can't
find the other one.
The president of the El Campo Club recently arose
to his full height, proclaimed that the club was running
short of silverware. This grieved the brothers no end.
Visions of special assessments swam before their eyes
(it's raining all over the campus, these days). But the
clouds rolled back and the sun shone through (obvious
ly faked by the property man) the very next day, when
two of the members walked in with an ai'mful of
knives, forks, and spoons. There are no statistics avail
able, but I strongly suspect a Sunday night supper.
While the rest of the campus departs for the Artists'
Ball in the City tonight, Our Hasher holds his weekly
rendezvous with death at the Library's Friday night
swing session. The Libe won't have quite as many pret
ty girls, or as colorful costumes as the Artists' but the
floor won't be as crowded. Besides, the Library has
over 500,000 bound volumes, all of them catalogued,
indexed, and bound.
The Barbaric Oceania, however, will have a volume
of 500,000 bounders, none of them catalogued, indexed,
or bound. Instead of the 9:51 kitten?on-the-keys rou
tine at the local Phi Bete house, the Parilia will be one
continuous floor show—a waxed floor show with gutters
attached.
Gi' 'em dc wax, byes (but right in the neck, please).
