# BULL SESSION
## DECLINE AND FALL OF AN UTOPIAN 
### 
wanted me to write a piece on how
w quickly college radicals blow up and go soft.
Perhaps it is the truth. The only college radical I
knew who was really red and not sunset pink did skid
with a tremendous slide. And he was really set on
renouncing America and going to Russia. While he was
here at Stanford he took Russian, and then left Stan
ford and entered a deisel engineering school in San
Francisco, even living in a Russian boarding house to
learn the language better. He planned to be a skilled
proletarian.
That v/as three years ago. Last year I saw him near
Carmel wearing white flannels and standing beside a
Packard which was parked in front of a well known art
store that does not sell trinkets.
Clemenceau, the Tiger of France, went the same
way, they say. He started as a professed radical and
ended up at the Versailles conference with his foot on
Germany's neck.

It is not that the world is going left so fast that it
passes stationary leftists and leaves them finally stand
ing at the right. What seems to happen is that the op
position gets tough and the home ties get strong and the
radical loses his radicalism in a reawakened love for
the soft life.
I can't help thinking of a guy who worked in the
multicolor pressroom of the' San Francisco Examiner
with me last summer. His name was Johnny and he
was born a malcontent. He had worked there for three
years for $17 a week. When he got his job, he imme
diately started buying a grand piano on terms of $6 a
month. Paying for the thing was like bailing out a
rowboat with a teaspoon, and he had long ago become
convinced that the world was out of joint. I listened
to him. That was my mistake.
He used to peek around the corner of the Meile
press to see if the foreman was in sight, then he'd skip
over to me and curse his fortune. The only thing that
made his life endurable, he said, was that he had found
a better world, and right here in California, at that.
* i< * *
He had once read a book concerning the lost con
tinent of Atlantis. When this land sank beneath the sea,
the book said, the people on it fled. Some went to
Easter Island in the Pacific and built the strange stone
statuary which has been found there. The rest settled
on the southern slopes of Mount Shasta.
* * * *
From here on, the tale got completely fantastic.
Calling themselves the Lemurians, these people by
pure thought raised temples "rivalling the splendor of
ancient Babylon," temples which were supposed to have
been seen through the Mount Wilson telescope pointed
in that direction. At night, the book said, a bluish
luminescent haze can be seen where Lemuria is sup
posed to be located. There was also something about,
the Lemurians sending huge shipments of gold out of
the town of Weed for the sufferers during the great
Japanese earthquake.
But what aroused Johnny was the part of the book
that said no man who had ever gone into that region
had returned alive. He was going there on his vaca
tion, to become a Lemurian like my 6ther friend wanted
to be a Russian, or else die gloriously in the knowledge
that he was checking out of a rotten world anyway.
When he came back from his vacation disgustingly
alive, still a Hearst minion and an American citizen,
there was an explanation due. It went like this:
, "Well, the woods looked too wild, so I didn't go in
them . . . And besides, I couldn't go in anyway. I re
membered I still had 1N payments left on my piano."
