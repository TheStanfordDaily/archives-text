UTTOLLYWOOD'S EXTRAS for
musical comedies are just one
happy family," says PHYLLIS RUTH
NEWMAN of the Chi Omega house,
recently an extra in "Born to Dance."
She tells of how approximately
1000 girls on central call for this type
of extra work soon get to know each
other. Each one apparently is look
ing out for her own breaks to get
ahead and is very jealous of anyone
who is likely to take her particular
"break" from her.
Phyllis was a new face to the select
group this summer, and it was five
days before she was accepted in their
society. There was one old trooper
who recalled the days when his wife
was a famous English cookâ€”it took
someone who wanted to show off to
get Phyllis into the "ring." She says
she liked the cooking, making ac
quaintances, and afterward the many
pleasant bridge games she had with
this family of chorines.
The date bureau is one of the nu
merous things in Hollywood to set a
girl on the wrong path, according to
Phyllis. When pretty girls come to
the studios expecting to become
overnight stars, the men who run
these bureaus, dance directors, cast
ing directors, etc., take the girls' pic
tures, but keep them rather than
turning them in. Then, when a vis
iting director comes to town, he is
given the name and address of the
girl he likes. The unsuspecting girl
is given a call, not for a picture but
to be escort to the visitor.
Phyllis is now under contract to
20th Century Fox, for whom she did
double work this summer to the ex
tent of being filmed on all occasions
in the picture except in close-ups of
the star.
In Hollywood Phyllis goes under
the screen name of Dian Duerson.
She was given the job as double for a
star, whom you will recognize when
you see her, because the same make
up artist that discovered a double for
Dolores Del Rio noted Phyllis and
sent her name to the studio.
Phyllis intends to continue her
work at 20th Century in spite of the
fact that she thinks the people that
make Hollywood, with the exception
of a few, are of the lowest class pos
sible.
