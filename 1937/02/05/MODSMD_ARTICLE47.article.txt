OD'S Country and the Woman"
at the Stanford Theater is
what changes a smoothie (George
Brent) into a sure-'nough he-man
(also George Brent). Mixed in and
stirred not too well is the old hobby-

horse from the
"continued next
week" days about
the members of
the same family
who get to work
ing for rival log
ging firms. The

Woman is Beverly Roberts, and of
course Mr. Brent is the recalcitrant
brother who logs for the wrong camp
and the Woman. Also in the film is
a man with a trained skunk, some
dandy rough-and-tumble fights, and
a lot of good outdoor shots.
.As for Technicolor, it's still great for
the wide open spaces, but the actors
look as if they had a virulent case of
jaundice.
"Let's Make a Million" (Para
mount) has Edward Everett Horton,
and the "Pixilated Twins" (remem
ber?), but that doesn't make any
difference.
