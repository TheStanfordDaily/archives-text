# Only Six Students Attend Meeting of Candidates; Declinations Automatic
## 
### JOHN RICE 
The Associated Students of Stan
ford University numbered 23 last
night.
Thirteen were candidates.
Six were audience.
Three were reporters.
And so it was that the A.S.S.U.
meeting called by President Jim
Reynolds—and not attended by him
—turned out to be a complete farce.
No Graduate Candidate
Fifteen out of 27 candidates failed
to appear, automatically declining.
None of the candidates for graduate
member appeared, leaving that of
fice wide open. Unless a by-law is
changed no names will appear on the
ballots Tuesday.
As a result of automatic declina
tions, only two candidates are left
for Junior Man, four for sophomore
woman, and two for BA.C. member.
Row Consolidates
Row steam-rollers began rolling
just in time, so that by the time of
last night's meeting Toro's Jack Cal
derwood was opposed by a single
Grek, Phi Delt Bob Mcßoskey. It is
quite possible that this competition
will result in a race between the two
Cardinals for senior presidency this
spring.
Simple solution' was found for
weeding out BA.C. candidates. The
boys all met in the D.U. house last
night. They flipped coins and Darrel
Holman won. He will run against
Roger Munger.
Sophomore Woman
Sophomore woman is not settled so
simply. Theta, Margaret Marshall;
Kappa, Jean Reynolds; and D.G.,
Didi Vibert are still in the running.
Hall's white hope is Mariposa's Pat
Skinner.
Though not asked to make speech
es, Council candidates were intro
duced. Present were Betty Hellyer
and Betty McQuaid for the women,
John Dem, Dick Hodgson, and Ben
Voss for the men.
The meeting was called in compli
ance with Article IV, Section 1 of the
By-Laws of the Associated Students.
It reads: "President of the Associated
Students shall call a meeting of this
Association, at which time all candi
dates for Executive Committee and
BA.C. shall be introduced. Failure
to do so shall be a declination."
As Jim Reynolds was "indisposed,"
Rally Committeeman Walt Wicket
acted as master of ceremonies.
