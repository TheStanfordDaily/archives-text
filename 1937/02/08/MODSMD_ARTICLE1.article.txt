## ROOSEVELT TURNS HONEST. HOLD THE PHONE, PEOPLE! 
### 
TOOTH Democrats and Republicans
have put down Roosevelt's Su
preme Court speech as a slip of the
greased tongue.
For the first time in history, they
figure, the song of the Hyde Park
Solomon turned into cacaphony. It
lacked too much of Diplomat Roose
velt's stabbing indirectness. It had
too much of Politician Roosevelt's
unscrupulousness.
And while he said many tactful
things, they could not make up for
the one clumsy thing he said—(in ef
fect), "I want to stuff the Supreme
Court."
It wasn't bravery. F.D.R. would be
the last man on earth to champion
valor as a political accessory. Nor
was it a fastie, pulled at the psycho
logical moment. For F.D.R., acute
above all men to the rap of opportu
nity, could tell this was the un-psy
chological moment.
♦ * *
JT WAS just rashness. We can for
get the fact that something has to
be done either to the Constitution or
the Supreme Court. We can forget
that convenience and necessity have
overridden U.S. law in other times
of stress. We can forget that the
Justices' refusal to play ball is more
perversity than concern with the
public's rights. And we can ignore
the automatic salaams both an ig
norant public and a learned pudiciary
make before the Constitution, a doc
ument just as "dangerous" and
"hare-brained" in its time as the
National Recovery Act is today.
But, to be smart, F.D.R. should
have forgotten them too. For while
it's O.K. to discuss such facts sanely
from the grocery store cracker barrel
and the Cellar's leather chairs, it's
not O.K. to do it from Washington.
Roosevelt simply made the mistake
of saying what he thought should
happen, for the sake of convenience.
But while he may have been rash,
he was not honest. And while he
may have been revolutionary, he did
not hit the ball square.
# * *
jpOR what F.D.R. proposed is to
disembowel the Supreme Court,
stuff it, and keep it as a museum
piece for the old folks.
If honesty had been as safe a po
litical expedient as rashness, he
might have gotten away with the
more sweeping but honest proposal to
abolish the Supreme Court outright,
instead of making it a legal stumble
bum, weighted down with the dis
tillations of too many minds.
But, quite obviously, rashness was
all the American public could stand.
If F.D.R. had been honest as well as
rash, he would not today be a dis
honored President. He would be a
dead one. —B. E.

National Recovery Act is today.
But, to be smart, F.D.R. should
have forgotten them too. For while
it's O.K. to discuss such facts sanely
from the grocery store cracker barrel
and the Cellar's leather chairs, it's
not O.K. to do it from Washington.
Roosevelt simply made the mistake
of saying what he thought should
happen, for the sake of convenience.
But while he may have been rash,
he was not honest. And while he
may have been revolutionary, he did
not hit the ball square.

jpOR what F.D.R. proposed is to
disembowel the Supreme Court,
stuff it, and keep it as a museum
piece for the old folks.
If honesty had been as safe a po
litical expedient as rashness, he
might have gotten away with the
more sweeping but honest proposal to
abolish the Supreme Court outright,
instead of making it a legal stumble
bum, weighted down with the dis
tillations of too many minds.
But, quite obviously, rashness was
all the American public could stand.
If F.D.R. had been honest as well as
rash, he would not today be a dis
honored President. He would be a
dead one. —B. E.
TOOTH Democrats and Republicans
have put down Roosevelt's Su
preme Court speech as a slip of the
greased tongue.
For the first time in history, they
figure, the song of the Hyde Park
Solomon turned into cacaphony. It
lacked too much of Diplomat Roose
velt's stabbing indirectness. It had
too much of Politician Roosevelt's
unscrupulousness.
And while he said many tactful
things, they could not make up for
the one clumsy thing he said—(in ef
fect), "I want to stuff the Supreme
Court."
It wasn't bravery. F.D.R. would be
the last man on earth to champion
valor as a political accessory. Nor
was it a fastie, pulled at the psycho
logical moment. For F.D.R., acute
above all men to the rap of opportu
nity, could tell this was the un-psy
chological moment.

JT WAS just rashness. We can for
get the fact that something has to
be done either to the Constitution or
the Supreme Court. We can forget
that convenience and necessity have
overridden U.S. law in other times
of stress. We can forget that the
Justices' refusal to play ball is more
perversity than concern with the
public's rights. And we can ignore
the automatic salaams both an ig
norant public and a learned pudiciary
make before the Constitution, a doc
ument just as "dangerous" and
"hare-brained" in its time as the
National Recovery Act is today.
