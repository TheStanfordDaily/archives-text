# Women Will Have Extra Late Leaves
## 
### 
Women can rejoice today at the
news that 2:30 late leaves taken Fri
day, Saturday, and Sunday nights
over the week-end of Washington's
Birthday will be automatic, and will
not count on their quota.
Overnight leaves may also be tak
en without permission Monday night,
February 22, for women returning by
train. These leaves will count on the
regular quota. The above privi
leges were conceded by Women's
Council in a meeting last Wednesday
night, during which traffic violation
and lockout cases were also acted
upon.
