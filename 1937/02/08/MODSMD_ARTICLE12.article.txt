# Canoe Spills 3 As Lake Opens
## Frosh Take Chilly Plunge To Commence Season 
### 
Comprehensive experiments by
three of the Farm's frosh yesterday
disclosed the rather commonplace
fact that canoes still tip and water
is still wet.
The canoe was Encina's, the water
was Lagunita, and the frosh were
Kai Larsen, William Spencer, and
Jack Hedden.
Premeditated swimming, however,
attracted only a few yesterday, al
though the lake, now 37 feet deep,
and Lifeguard Hal Weatherbe were
declared open for business.
Swimming was limited, almost en
tirely, to the male of the species,
since tradition dictates that the first
woman to take the leap will be mar
ried before she graduates.
Boats, canoes, and Ernie Brand
sten's regulations will be in opera
tion every day from 10 to 10.
