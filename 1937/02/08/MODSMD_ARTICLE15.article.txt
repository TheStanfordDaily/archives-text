# Stanford's Townsendites
## Editorial 
### 
MORE stupid than the Townsendites are the 200-odd students
who are petitioning for an $8000 Lake Lagunita nitery.
And they are even less likely than the Doctor's army of
ignorami to get what they want.
With the innocence of rheumatic-brained oldsters, they ask
not for $200 a month from a somewhat mystic "tax," but an
amount "not in excess of $10,000" from an equally mystic A.S.
S.U. surplus.
Brief recourse to the Associated Students' books shows a
probable surplus of $8000 at the end of Spring Quarter.
But this surplus is not unencumbered, as the petitioners
assume. A few thousands of it must be held to defray possible
iosses on student activities such as the Concert Series, which
last year sustained a $1000 deficit.
Obviously, if the full $8000 were used to build a nitery (and
any contractor will assure you no nitery could be built from
the ground up for much less) the A.S.S.U. would be bankrupt
if any of its student activities ran over their budgets.
And even if no such deficits were likely, the A.S.S.U. would
be guilty of appalling business practice if it operated without a
financial backlog for emergencies. Should the new nitery
proposal go through, such a backlog would have to be pieced
together out of the budgets of such student organizations as
Dramatic Council and Debate Council.
Moreover, the large initial investment of a Lakeside Nitery
is complicated by a probable high operating expense, and is in
sharp contrast v/ith the uncertainty of the revenues to accrue
from student patronage.
For in the final analysis, the only sure thing in the nitery
proposal is the fickleness of student taste—even that of student
petition signers.
And it should also be realized that the refusal of the Admin
istration to permit week-night operation might force the nitery
into a deficit, even though student interest could be sustained at
a profitable level.
Meanwhile Ex Committee has tentatively approved the idea
of a nitery in the Union Lobby, with new furnishings and deco
rations.
It might not be the best nitery, but it would indicate whether
v more expensive nitery would get the support sufficient to jus
tify a Sig investment.
Let the student body see what Ex Committee can give them
before they ask for something Ex Committee can't give them.

And it should also be realized that the refusal of the Admin
istration to permit week-night operation might force the nitery
into a deficit, even though student interest could be sustained at
a profitable level.
Meanwhile Ex Committee has tentatively approved the idea
of a nitery in the Union Lobby, with new furnishings and deco
rations.
It might not be the best nitery, but it would indicate whether
v more expensive nitery would get the support sufficient to jus
tify a Sig investment.
Let the student body see what Ex Committee can give them
before they ask for something Ex Committee can't give them.
MORE stupid than the Townsendites are the 200-odd students
who are petitioning for an $8000 Lake Lagunita nitery.
And they are even less likely than the Doctor's army of
ignorami to get what they want.
With the innocence of rheumatic-brained oldsters, they ask
not for $200 a month from a somewhat mystic "tax," but an
amount "not in excess of $10,000" from an equally mystic A.S.
S.U. surplus.
Brief recourse to the Associated Students' books shows a
probable surplus of $8000 at the end of Spring Quarter.
But this surplus is not unencumbered, as the petitioners
assume. A few thousands of it must be held to defray possible
iosses on student activities such as the Concert Series, which
last year sustained a $1000 deficit.
Obviously, if the full $8000 were used to build a nitery (and
any contractor will assure you no nitery could be built from
the ground up for much less) the A.S.S.U. would be bankrupt
if any of its student activities ran over their budgets.
And even if no such deficits were likely, the A.S.S.U. would
be guilty of appalling business practice if it operated without a
financial backlog for emergencies. Should the new nitery
proposal go through, such a backlog would have to be pieced
together out of the budgets of such student organizations as
Dramatic Council and Debate Council.
Moreover, the large initial investment of a Lakeside Nitery
is complicated by a probable high operating expense, and is in
sharp contrast v/ith the uncertainty of the revenues to accrue
from student patronage.
For in the final analysis, the only sure thing in the nitery
proposal is the fickleness of student taste—even that of student
petition signers.
And it should also be realized that the refusal of the Admin
istration to permit week-night operation might force the nitery
into a deficit, even though student interest could be sustained at
a profitable level.
Meanwhile Ex Committee has tentatively approved the idea
