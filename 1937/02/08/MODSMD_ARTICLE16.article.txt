# Nitery Petition Raises Constitutional Doubt
## 
### 
The Lagunita nitery petition, signed by over 200 students and demand
ing a special student body vote, is "out of order" and worthless as a means
of forcing Ex Committee to build a lakeside recreation center.
This was the unofficial opinion last night of Frank Fullenwider, former
Ex Committee member and author of the preesnt A.S.S.U. Constitution.

"The Constitution gives Ex Com-'
mittee sole spending power of A. S.
S. U. funds," he told The Daily. "Un
less the petition's drafters change it
to a proposal for a constitutional
amendment, even an overwhelming
maojrity vote would mean nothing
but 'advice' to Ex Committee."
Fullenwider also declared that as
far as he knew Ex Committee could
entirely ignore the present petition.
Kirkwood Final Judge
Final advice on the question will
come today when Dean Marion Kirk
wood of the law school, the "supreme
court" of the A.S.S.U., hands down a
decision to President Jim Reynolds.
Last week's petition as presented to
Student Manager Chuck Fontius by
Bill Ward read as follows: "The Ex
ecutive Committee shall construct a
recreation center on the shore of
Lake Lagunita, the cost of which
shall not exceed $10,000, to be de
rived from the surplus funds of the
A.S.S.U."
Lake Nitery Inadvisable
The inadvisability of building a
Lagunita recreation center has been
proved during the past few months
when Ex Committee has gone over
every argument, for and against, in
its consideration of the whole nitery
situation.
Lack of funds seem to put a lake

side nitery out of the question. With
only an $8000 surplus on hand, this
sum could not be spent without en
dangering the A.S.S.U.'s solvency.
Need Surplus
"Every year deficits in various stu
dent activities, such as Concert Se
ries, debate, and dramatics, dip into
the surplus," Fontius declared yes
terday. "Without it, the A.S.S.U.
would be forced into bankruptcy."
"Supposing we did have the initial
outlay for a lakeside nitery," Fontius
continued, "the operating expenses
would be such that we would be
forced to cut down nearly every
other activity budget to the mini
mum."
