Three Amendments
Besides the elections, three amend
ments will be put before the student
body. The first would set up the dale
of the spring elections from the third
Tuesday in May to the third Tuesday
of spring quarter. Purpose of this
chance would be to give newly elect
ed officers a chance to learn some
thing about their new positions be
fore they take office.
Other amendments proposed would
require that three instead of two
council members be elected to each
council in February. This, accord
ing to Ex Committee, would avoid all
chance of a completely inexperienced
council in the fall.
