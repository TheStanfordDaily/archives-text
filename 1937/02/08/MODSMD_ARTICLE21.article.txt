# Row Muddled Over Election, Says Prophet
## Swampum Sees Political Machine Collapsing As Nominees Fail To Quit 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM 
Jim Ludlam and Dick Riddell
would have turned in their graves
yesterday if they had had a grave to
turn in. The strong Row machine
they built from Greeks, nuts, with
only a few bolts, and much political
canniness seems to have gone the
way of the one hoss shay.
All would-be politicos were to ap
pear at a mass meeting Thursday
night. All not appearing were to be
dropped. When a record throng of
30 candidates and supporters filed
lonesotnely in, the Row thought it
saw a glimmer of co-operation. Sol
idarity, they said ,was being evi
denced. Half the candidates failed to
show, and the supposed purpose was
that one might win. But it was all
a mistake.
They Didn't Know
They simply didn't know about the
meeting. And they'x-e still in the
running, with the Hall chuckling a
Machiavellian chuckle.
Bob McCroskey was supposed to
have an open field against Jack Cal
derwood, and the Phi Delts were
much pleased. But Jack Beman, Curt
Eaton, George Veness, and Art Stoef
en are still on the ballot. Sandy
Lowengai't, Jim Hurst, and John
Gallagher have turned in the only of
ficial declinations.

"The women can take care of
themselves," decided Hall men. But
the Row women evidently can't. Only
ones to appear Thursday were Mar
garet Marshall, Jean Reynolds, and
Didi Vibert. But uninformed of the
meeting, and still running, are Jayne
Copp, Eleanor Hatch, and Ann Pal
mer. Pat Skinner is the only Hall
candidate.
B.A.C. men were more canny. Jack
Clark, H. B. Lee, Dave Rider, Joe
Vigna, and Pete Zagar—a formidable
line-up in anybody's election—tossed
a coin and withdrew in favor of Dar
rel Holman.
"They can still run," agreed Elec
tion Board Chairman Dave Allison.
"If they weren't informed of the
meeting, they can hardly be dropped.
It was a farce anyway."
