# Youth Act Caravan Visits Campus
## 
### 

NO DEFIANCE of University was made when a one-unit Youth Act caravan made a half-hour stop at
the English Corner Friday, said Professor Robert E. Swain yesterday. Although the Committee on Public-
Exercises of which Professor Swain is chairman, was not consulted, it took no action on "an invitation made
in good faith."
Greeting the caravanners are Leonard Pockinan and Aline Goldstein. In the wagon, left to right: Dorothy
Edwards, C. McKinny, Malby Roberts, and George Kaufman. Behind Pockman can be seen the Memorial
Theater. The caravan is making a transcontinental trip to Washington, D.C., expecting to arrive February
1!) for the purpose of petitioning Congress for the American Youth Act. There it will join with 500 young
people from the East in interviewing President Roosevelt.
