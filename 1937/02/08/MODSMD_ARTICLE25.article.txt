By IRVIN JORGENSEN

The opening of the 1934 Queen
and King race found the Thetas
plenty griped at the Pi Phi strangle
hold on the Masque Ball Queenship;
so were all the other houses up and
down the Row. They knew that if
they were going to muscle in, it
would require different methods
than had prevailed in the past.
In many respects, 1934 was the
pivotal year: it was the year of the
famous Queen Harris kidnapping,
it was the year that portly, flush
faced King Bob McClure suddenly
became A Certain Student the day
following the Ball. But there were
several underlying pivots that no
body seemed to notice.
Receipts Multiply
The thyroid thirties saw the Con
test receipts thumb noses at depres
sions and contracting economies as
they doubled and tripled in amount
every year from 1929 to 1930.
For one thing, immortal Cardinal
Stan Beaubaire introduced the idea
of the final three minutes of secret
balloting. He also decided that King
Queen were to run separately again,
first revival of this custom since the
Masque Ball was so heartily
squelched in 1925. High pressure
was introduced to the Contest by

the enterprising immortal Cardinal,
with publicity, and with the candidly
faked preliminary campus "nomina
tions" and "free vote."
Revenge
Most important was the revenge
motive. Everybody hated the Pi
Phi's around Masque Ball time. The
Thetas knew this. The Thetas also
knew that the personal check was
not enough, even among the osten
tatious, to swing the contest. That
meant ORGANIZATION. %
Machine-like, business-like, high
pressuring was the Theta organiza
tion. This was overlaid with a hys
teria on the surface. Sororities went
without dinners, and turned the pro
ceeds into the war chest. Assess
ments on every girl in the house
were triumphantly made. These were
from 5 to 8 bucks apiece. This as
sessment extended down into the
pledge class. And the pledges, more
hysterical than the others, solicited
funds among their friends in Roble.
Underneath the hysteria, the cool
and calculating brains went to work:
their plan was to keep Harris in the
running, amass a war chest, play
upon hatred of the Pi Phis to form
a basis for united action, show their
strength at the last minute, draw
the smaller houses over to their side.

than had prevailed in the past.
In many respects, 1934 was the
pivotal year: it was the year of the
famous Queen Harris kidnapping,
it was the year that portly, flush
faced King Bob McClure suddenly
became A Certain Student the day
following the Ball. But there were
several underlying pivots that no
body seemed to notice.

The thyroid thirties saw the Con
test receipts thumb noses at depres
sions and contracting economies as
they doubled and tripled in amount
every year from 1929 to 1930.
For one thing, immortal Cardinal
Stan Beaubaire introduced the idea
of the final three minutes of secret
balloting. He also decided that King
Queen were to run separately again,
first revival of this custom since the
Masque Ball was so heartily
squelched in 1925. High pressure
was introduced to the Contest by

the enterprising immortal Cardinal,
with publicity, and with the candidly
faked preliminary campus "nomina
tions" and "free vote."
Revenge
Most important was the revenge
motive. Everybody hated the Pi
Phi's around Masque Ball time. The
Thetas knew this. The Thetas also
knew that the personal check was
not enough, even among the osten
tatious, to swing the contest. That
meant ORGANIZATION. %
Machine-like, business-like, high
pressuring was the Theta organiza
tion. This was overlaid with a hys
teria on the surface. Sororities went
without dinners, and turned the pro
ceeds into the war chest. Assess
ments on every girl in the house
were triumphantly made. These were
from 5 to 8 bucks apiece. This as
sessment extended down into the
pledge class. And the pledges, more
hysterical than the others, solicited
funds among their friends in Roble.
Underneath the hysteria, the cool
and calculating brains went to work:
their plan was to keep Harris in the
running, amass a war chest, play
upon hatred of the Pi Phis to form
a basis for united action, show their
strength at the last minute, draw
the smaller houses over to their side.
