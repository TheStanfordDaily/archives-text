# Women's County Fair To Feature Auction
## 
### 
To help tomorrow's County Fair,
the proceeds from which will go to
a scholarship for a Stanford woman,
36 Palo Alto merchants and several
San Francisco stores have contrib
uted goods for the auction sale, one
of the main features of the afternoon.
According to Sis Coonley, chair
man of the junior committee which
has planned the uuction, everything
from cake to mittens will be auc
tioned off in one of the booths, start
ing at 4 o'clock. The auctioneer will
be Leo Haggarty.
Besides the auction block, four
other wpod-topped carnival booths
will be set up in the Union Court
where ice cream, hot dogs, popcorn,
peanuts, and caramel apples will be
sold. Decorated with bright colored
balloons, crepe paper, and Hushy
pester signs, the booths will be sur
rounded in the court by a small wire
and crepe paper fence. Palmistry
tents and carnival games such as
pitching pennies and popping bal
loons will likewise be set up. In case
of rain, both booths and tents will
be moved to the lower floors of the
Women's Clubhouse.
The freshman committee, headed
by Jeanne Cutler, has been in charge
of refreshments, while Carolyn Hib
bard's sophomore committee has
planned the decorations. Ice cream
has been donated by Millbrae
Creamery; hot dogs and rolls by
Liddicott's; and cookies by the Home
Food Shop.
County fair is open to all campus

women. Last week, telegrams, sent
to the presidents of Lagunita, Roble,
and the Union, gave these living
groups special invitations to it.
