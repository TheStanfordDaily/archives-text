# Indian Quintet Proves Mettle In Bear Game
## Hoopsters Click Without Luisetti, To Disprove 'One-Man Team' Slur 
### GORDY FROST 
Somebody called Stanford a one- i
man basketball team —once.
But after Stanford as a "team," and 1
decidedly not a one-man one, had
crushed some Bears 50-37 Friday
night, and some Dons 51-34 Saturday, 1
that man knew he'd erred.
Luisetti Starts It
For what the week-end showed—
and showed decisively—was that An- i
gelo "Hank" Luisetti is the spark that j
starts the Red Machine, but not the ;
only one that can keep it going.
Stanford had a lot of reasons to 1
lose a game to California Friday j
night. Jack Calderwood was sudden- !
ly taken ill with a tinge of appendi- j
citis, which, incidentally, has given
him no more trouble apd probably j
won t interfere with his intention to ,
play in Los Angeles next week-end
when the Cards meet U.C.L.A.
Scorer's Error
In addition, a scorer's error took
Hank Luisetti out. of the game at a
critical moment, his number seven I
being mistaken for Dinty Moore's'
37.
And Howie Turner was unable to
start.
Yes, Stanford had reason to lose
—but didn't, which makes the 13- !
point win appear even rosier.
Versus the San Francisco Univer
sity Dons for flood relief in the S.F.!
Civic Auditorium, Stanford's Red- j
shirts gave some 4500 spectators a !
thrill while they ran up a 48-26!
lead, when second stringers took it :
away lor the last 10 minutes of play, j
Luisetti scored 18 points Friday,
19 Saturday.
