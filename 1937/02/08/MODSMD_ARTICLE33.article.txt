# Yearling Five Takes Cubs, U.S.F. Frosh
## 
### 
Friday night, after a two-day star
vation, Stanford's Papoose basket
bailers held a heap-big palaver in
the Pavilion, during which they
feasted on roasted Bear Cub meat,
brought down by parcel post from
Berkeley. Tho Cubs accounted for
fewer Papooses than vice versa, with
the resultant tallyâ€”43-38.
The game might have been differ
ent had the Cal Cubs connected with
their short shots. They couldn't hit
their hat inside a ten-foot radius of
the hoop, however, .and the game
was in the bag for the frosh. The
Papoose quintet went into an early
lead, and at one time were out in
front, 21-7. Half-time score was 23-
20, which was as close as the Cubs
ever came to catching up with the
roaring Papooses.
Next evening, the frosh had a very
bad scare, barely maintaining a slim
lead to nose out the U.S.F. frosh, 30-
29. The game was knotted at 19-all
at half time, and again a few minutes
before the end at 27 apiece. Then
Norton sank a free throw and an
other Papoose flipped in a basket.
That put the game on ice, despite the
Dons' last minute field goal.
The young gentleman who puts the
frosh through their paces did not
appear Saturday night with his team,
because he, Mentor Gorter, was very
sick with the mumps. His place was
ably filled by Coach Bunn and little
Dale Huff.
