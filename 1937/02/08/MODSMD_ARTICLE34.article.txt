# Budge Beats Grant For Florida Title
## 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Feb. 7 (UP).
â€”Donald Budge of California today
blasted the clay-court 1 jinx Bryan
(Bitsy) Grant held over him when
he trounced Atlanta's tennis tiny
mite in four sets to win the Curf Club
championship.
Budge, the nation's No. 1 net star,
marked up his first triumph in five
starts against Grant by 6-3, 2-6, 6-4,
6-4.
It was a blood-and-thunder con
test with both men at top form. But
Budge, varying his usual strategy,
mixed a soft game with his vigorous
stroking for a change of pace that
proved too much for Grant.
Bitsy was retrieving as well as he
ever has, but against Budge's soft
game he was forced to alter his style.
