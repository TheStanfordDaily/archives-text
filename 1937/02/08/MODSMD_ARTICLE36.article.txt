# Farm Ruggers Take U.C.L.A. In Close Game
## Richardson's Toe Gives Stanford 6-5 Victory; Bruins Outplay Cards 
### 
The trusty toe of Wayne Richard
son and a helping wind were factors
which gave the Indian ruggers their
6-5 win over U.C.L.A. Saturday
afternoon. The Westwood boys out
played Stanford throughout the
game, but were a little over-anxious,
incurring penalties for being off-side,
thereby giving the Indians a chance
to score through penalty kicks.
The U.C.L.A. team had been ham
mering away at the Stanford goal
line for about five minutes when
Jack Baieda, Bruin back, carried the
ball through the scrum. When the
referee uncovered the players, Baie
da was lying just across the goal line.
The conversion was good, putting
the southern team in the lead, 5-0.
The Stanford team went back into
the game determined to win. How
ever, it seemed that they just could
n't get into that splendid form that
they showed a week ago.
In the middle of the second half,
the ball was about 2U yards from the
Bruin goal line, when an offside pen
alty was called on U.C.L.A. and the
Indians elected to try a field goal.
With Captain Joe Vigna holding the
ball and a strong wind behind him,
Wayne Richardson took a couple of
steps, and with perfect precision
kicked the ball straight over the
uprights.
About five minutes after the first
goal, another off-side penalty was
called against the Bruins. Richard
son again kicked the ball, but failed,
within two feet, to make the kick
good. From then until about two
minutes from the end of the game,
the ball just traveled up and down
the field.
Then with a little less than two
minutes to go, another off-side pen
alty was called on the Westwood
boys, this time at about 25 yards
from the Bruin goal. Again Stanford
chose to try a field goal. Vigna held
the ball. Richardson carefully "took
