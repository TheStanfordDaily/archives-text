# SIDELINE SLANTS...
## MAYBE IT'LL CHANGE, MAYBE IT WON'T 
### 
Now thai Stanford has another win
and Cal has another loss in the
conference, everything is tied up
tighter than a Dollar liner in the
â–  San Francisco strike. Both Stanford
| and Southern Cal have lost one, won
I five apiece, while Cal and U.C.L.A.
j are knotted vice versa.
That gives the Indians and the
| Trojans a percentage of .833, while
j the Bears and Bruins make up the
difference with .167 apiece. Nibs
Price and his team feel that things
are going to change next week-end,
since they plan to take at least one
i from U.S.C. in Berkeley either Fri
day or Saturday night. Stanford
goes south again, this time to play
Caddy Works' Westwood team on the
southerners' home court. By virtue
of the two earlier manhandlings of
the Bruins, the Indians are logical fa
vorites to take both.
Probably the most important thing
about Friday night's game with the
Bears, outside of the fact that it was
| a conference game, is that it puts
Stanford two up and two to go in the
| four-game Cal series, and everything
looks right for the first Stanford vic
i tory in any California series since
1921. It's been a long old wait, and
it's not in the bag yet, but the Cards
must falter horribly or the Bears
must have a better team than they
j showed Friday night if there is to be
I any chance for a split in the series.
