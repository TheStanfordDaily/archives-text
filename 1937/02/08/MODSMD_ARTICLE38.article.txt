# EVERYTHING'S FINE WHEN THE BIG FIVE PLAY
## 
### 
John Bunn sent his team out on the
floor Friday night minus not only
Howie Turner, but big Jack "Spooks"
Calderwood, who was stricken
Thursday night with what has been
diagnosed as a slight touch of ap
pendicitis. The quiet, grinning giant,
governor on the Big Red Machine
of which Hank Luisetti is the spark,
will be finer 'n' a frog hair for the
Bruin games—the attack wasn't too
severe, but it was bad enough to
prevent any strenuous exertion. He

played Saturday night, a little.
Spooks is a great boy; the team
doesn't seem right without him. That
first five, Luisetti, Turner. Moore,
Calderwood, and Stoefen, is so much
of a unit that when they all get to
gether on the floor everything auto
matically becomes hotsy-totsy.
Those five have played together so
regularly that when one goes out the
others lag a little. It was shown in
the first U.S.C. game, when four of
them without Howie couldn't get
under way. Lee worked in nicely j
the second night, but the set-up
wasn't right for the first contest.
Things were salty for a while at !
the start of the game Friday against j
the Bears, but unfortunately for
Price he doesn't have the team this
year that the Trojans have. He
couldn't take advantage of the break
he had. And when Hank Luisetti
went out of the game on personals, j
for the first time in his college ca- j
rcer, and at that on a scorekeeper's |
error, Howie Turner came in to sup- !
ply enough spark to start the Indians i
drawing away. The combination of
Luisetti, one of the cleanest players
on the Coast, going out on what were
questionable fouls and the fiery but i

crippled Turner coming in to carry
on meant curtains for any Bear
hopes.
In any other situation the loss of
Hank would have meant a decided
loss of spirit, but the substitution of
Turner by Coach Bunn, which seem
ed to me to be very clever in a psy
chological way, was the ideal move.
