# Too Much Constitution
## 
### 
THURSDAY night is "farce night" on the
Stanford campus.
Either Sarah Bernhardt is making an ass of
herself in the Assembly Hall, or A.S.S.U. elec
tion candidates are making fools of themselves
in Room 214. Last Thursday it was the fools'
show.
That the 13 nominees who showed up to pre
sent themselves to "the student body" ap
peared in a lugubrious light was not, however,
entirely their own fault. As the "pinks" would
say, the System was to blame—Stanford's sys
tem of presenting candidates to the student
body.
In the first place, the student body isn't
enough interested in its student officers to
come around and look at candidates, especially
in a mid-year election when only a few minor
posts are being filled.
In the second place, what can a nominee for
■sophomore woman or junior man say that
would give a hint as to his fitness for a seat
on Ex Committee? Those little "speeches" by
which we are assured that the candidate has
"always been vitally interested in student gov
ernment" or will "do everything in my power
to be a success" aren't worth the electricity it
takes to light Room 214 for the length of the
meeting (15 minutes).
The candidates don't know what to say be
cause there are no "policies" existent upon
which to base a "campaign speech." So the
best they can do is stumble to their feet, smile,
utter some nonsense which may lose more
votes than it will win. Last Thursday they didn't
worry much because only six votes were at
stake—six voters were present besides candi
dates and reporters.
Theoretically, the A.S.S.U. Constitution is
perfectly right in assuming we ought to know
who the candidates are before we vote for
them. But its method of presenting them doesn't
work out in practice. So little did Ex Committee
think of Thursday's "farce" that it changed a
by-law to allow nominees absent from the
meeting to remain on tomorrow's ballot.
Why not line up all the candidates, according
to height, in front of the Chapel for an hour each
morning for three mornings before election?
Then all the student body—not just six—could
throw heavy objects from forty paces. The
candidate that stands up with the least strain is
the best man for the job. And no one would
have to say a word.—D. B.
