# "Untainted Blood"

### 
UNTAINTED blood" is what shipowners are
looking for to head their Coast Employers'
Committee and Waterfront Employers' Asso
ciation. A.nd that is what they will get if nego
tiations with Stanford's Comptroller Almon E.
Roth are completed.
Roth is a "natural" for the job. He is a finan
cial and economic expert, and behind him are
18 years' successful comptrollership.
But the qualification that shipowners are after
is—Roth is not a shipper. In that field Roth
would enter as an impartial but competent
judge, one who has proven his ability in other
lines, one whose knowledge of labor and ig
norance of shipping would render him a ca
pable arbiter in future maritime eruptions.
Not that Mr. Thomas G. Plant, who announces
his intention to retire as Coast Committee
Chairman, has been unsuccessful.
But Mr. Plant says he must devote more time
to his position as General Manager and Vice-
President of American - Hawaiian Steamship
Company.
Stanford would dislike losing its competent
Comptroller—but it is nothing new to have his
loss threatened.
Two California Governors have tried in vain
to induce him to take the State Directorship of
Finance. He refused the Chairmanship of the
Federal Relief Administration west of the Rock
ies, and despite urging, declined to even think
of accepting the state gubernatorial candidacy.
Most of these have hung before his eyes re

munerative benefits far exceeding anything the
University could offer.
Instead Mr. Roth preferred to stay University
Comptroller and carry such activities on the
side as Presidency of Roiary International and
Vice-Presidency of the State Chamber of Com
merce.
This time Mr. Roth could hardly be blamed
for accepting an opportunity which holds such
a wealth of possibilities. Perhaps better than
releasing him entirely, Stanford should offer
to "loan" him to shippers for part time, still
keeping him on to direct Stanford's financial
next Monday.—G. F.
