field trip in comparative anatomy last
Friday night wound up (and then immediately ran
down) at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, where
many of the specimens were pickled, but were unfor
tunately not in jars.
This, of course, resulted in a good deal of slopping
about the floor, particularly when it is realized that
many of the specimens were not contained at all, and
bottles didn't seem to help a bit. The cops drained off
some of the active agents into cans and jugs. Some
varieties, though, failed to function as undercover
agents. The field trip from Stanford followed directly
on the heels of the closing down of the local haut
monde spots Friday night. The boys showed a surpris
ing new interest in answering the local gal's request
to take them straight home.
As soon as this function was fulfilled the boys put
on a sash and departed for the Barbaric Oceania. The
field trip was mostly a stag affair, though one Breaker
who took a date lost her during the middle of the
evening and hasn't seen her since.
Fresh from a local house dance, one of the brothers
ended himself upon the floor, beating a nail keg as a
drum while one of the specimens did a nautch dance,
as the rest of the specimens cx-owded around in a
circle. Though the "Buy My Violets" sequence won
considerable favor, the forget-me-nautch routine was
definitely the hit of the evening.
Most of the Stanfordites on the trip, according to ad
vices from the front and back, remained in focus dur
ing the evening, performing great feats of scientific
observation, though a few did some broken field trip
running, and made specimens of themselves before the
evening was over.
My, don't we artists have fun in San Francisco!
