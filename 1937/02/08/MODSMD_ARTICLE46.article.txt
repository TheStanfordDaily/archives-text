WE DO IT THE AMERICAN WAY
A LONG toward San Francisco on the Bayshorc High
way there is a sign that reads, "World's Highest
Wages"—then a picture of a happy family and an un
derline —"There Is No Way Like THE AMERICAN
WAY."
Back in 1934 there was a waterfront strike in San
Francisco and it got so bad that a lot of people thought
they weren't going to have enough to eat because the
strikers had the town pretty well bottled up. Things
looked tough despite the fact that the president said the
country was getting along fine, pulling itself out of
the depression hand<over fist.
The American way.
Even the governor said things would be all right,
but one bright summer day all he could think of was
the militia so he called it out,
To make San Francisco safe for democracy.
The American way.
There v/as a battle on Rincon Hill and the militia
shot two of the strikers dead in the street, victims of
The American way.
Charles A. Lindbergh flew the Atlantic alone and
was a hero in the hearts of his people.
Everyone loved him and his wife and their curly
haired son, but someone broke into their house one
rainy night and stole their curly haired son and mur
dered him. For that crime they burned Hauptmann in
an electric chair to show that
the Americans
knew how to clear up the crime situation.
The Lindberghs had another son, named him Jon.
People all over the country smiled and said that it was
fine that the police had made the country safe for the
new Eaglet but they didn't know the half of it. The
newspapers found out about Jon Lindbergh,
gave him a whole front page to play on,
hounded his mother and father to get pictures,
stories, anything.
The Lindberghs and their son named Jon were ex
iled from their own country by
The American way.
TWELVE HURT IN NEW AUTO RIOT! Police Bat
tle Pickets. Twelve persons were injured this after
noon in a riot between, etc., etc.
There is no way like the American way.
We go to the movies, we build bridges, skyscrapers,
tunnels, hotwater bottles, tricky houses with photoelec
tric sliding doors, but we never capture the essence of
it all. We call it progress because we can't think of
anything else to call it. For that matter, we have for
gotten how to think.
We go to the opera and sit on our "plush-bottomed
cultures" and wish we were home listening to the Duke.
We go to college and say we are getting an education,
but not one in ten of us know what an education is or
even what it pretends to be and what's more, we don't
have to know that to graduate so we never bother to
learn.
We smoke big cigars, talk big money, eat big meals
with overstuffed people, etc., etc., etc., according to the
American way.
