### MISS GARBO 
r J n HERE may still be people in the
world who are not convinced that
Garbo is the greatest actress that the
screen, or the stage, has produced in
a long, long time. If such shriveled
souls there be, let them see "Camille"
and thenceforth and forever hold
their peace.
For "Camille" is Miss Garbo at her
best, brilliantly vital, with that pecu
liar combination of aloofness and in
timacy that is her particular fascina
tion. Better photographed than she
has ever been, surrounded by a —
with one exception—superb cast, she
makes the most of a characterization
which might well become unsympa
thetic in other and less deft hands.
'Tragic Goddess'
As unhappy Marguerite Gautier,
moving like a tragic goddess among
the glittering butterflies of the Paris
half-world of the 50's, she gives what
is perhaps her best performance to
date, certainly a pei*formance far
above any now current on the screen.
Indeed, not since "Anna Karenina"
has there been a similar perform
ance; and probably not until the
promised-and-hoped-for "Countess
Walewska" will there be another.
In short, 'Camille" is Miss Garbo's
triumph from the word Go, and this
despite the fact that the story is one
of the oldest in the theater, has been
played by every great actress for
three generations, and would seem in
this modern world to have outlived
its public long since.
'Fresh, Sincere'
Director George Cukor has treated
his material as matter-of-factly as
though it were woven around the
latest headline. Sincerity is the key
note, and evei'yone from the star
right on down plays it as though it
were quite the freshest and most im
portant thing in the world. And cu
riously enough, you gradually come
to feel that perhaps it is.
Laura Hope Crews makes of Pru
dence a remarkably real old girl with
a yen for living, and everyone is
startled but not particularly sur

prised when she smokes a cigar.
Lenore Ulric returns after long ab
sence from the screen to extract the
last ounce of unpleasant humor from
the petulantly viscious Olympe.
'Villainous'
Henry Daniell's Baron de Varville,
restrained, sufficiently villainous,
sufficiently reasonable, rises to a
peak in the dialogue at the piano and
climaxes when he slaps Marguerite.
(Listen to the audience gasp at this.)
Lionel Barrymore, curiously ill at
ease, somehow fails to click with his
usual skill.
And then, of course, there is Robert
Taylor. Robert looks noble and suf
fering as only he, thank God, can.
At times there is a fine touch of
Pomona College about his acting, but
on the whole it remains pretty dead
level, stolid and uninspired in the
love-scenes (one wonders if he is
going to. fall apart under Miss Gar
bo's kisses) and with one set expres
sion of pain and bewilderment at all
other times. Perhaps he comes near
est sincerity in the death-scene, but
unfortunately for him Marguerite's
pathetic attempts to "look beautiful"
claim all one's attention.
'Immature'
As Marguerite remarks—and this
is no reflection on Garbo, it's a slan
der on the younger generation—"You
are so young." Young and immature
he is, playing the man in a situation
he never quite seems to understand.
But after all, it's Garbo in "Ca
mille" — A "Camille" magnificently
produced, marching relentlessly to
its inevitable tragic end. It's one of
the few really top-notch films of the
year. And disagree if you dare.
You'll be shot at sunrise.

I refuse to be accessory after the
fact in the crime of double-bill, so
shan't review "Bulldog Drummond
Escapes." It's light, bright, and pho
tographed through fog. It comes
with "Camille," if you care to sit
through it.
