### R. B. JONES 
RUBE GOLDBERG'S COMIC
CHARACTER, Professor Butts, cer
tainly has nothing on Encina's two
inventive inmates, WALLY JENSEN
and LINDSAY WHEELER. Their
rooms, on first appeai'ance, resemble
physics labsâ€”wires and batteries ev
erywhere.
A button on either side of the door
is all they need to get in. When this
button is pressed, a current is set
through batteries in a copper wire
coil. In one end of the coil is a nail;
attached to the nail is a link wire
chain, which.by lever method looses
the latch, when the coil magnetizes
and the nail sucks in it to form a
magnet core. A spring from the door
to the wall does the rest, and in their
rooms they go.
They aren't worried about trouble
from the authorities; a private fuse
box takes care of that.
It if-is 10 o'clock when Jensen re
tires, he turns the dials of his radio
until he gets the required sleep tonic
and sets his alarm clock for 10:30.
When the alarm goes off, so does a
switch, so does his radio, and so to
sleep.
Wheeler doesn't have any trouble
Retting to sleep: what he hates is get
ting up in a cold room in the morn
ing. He sets his alarm for 6 o'clock,
and at that time it "relieves a latch,
and the windows weighted with
heavy iron bars give way to gravity's
pull. To the tune of the power house
whistle he rises in a nice warm room.
Then he goes to their private bat
tery telephone system, calls Jensen,
releases another latch, and a spring
behind his desk drawer pushes it
open. He grabs his books out of the
drawer, dashes out the automatic
door, and is off to the Quad with
Jensen to make an 8 o'clock.
