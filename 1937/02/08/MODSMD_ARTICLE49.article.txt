# CAMPUS OPINION
## WILL IT WORK? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reading the Daily's account con
cerning the new Interfraternity
Council rule necessitating a "C" av
erage on the part of the pledges in
order to move into the houses they
have joined, I could find no justifi
able reason for such an action. Per
haps they have many just and good
reasons for passing this rule but the
rather general ones advanced in the
Daily's report seemed to me entirely
inadequate to support the rule under
critical observation.
Just how it will improve the
scholarship in the houses is beyond
my poor intellect, for if they live in
the Hall while trying to maintain, or
obtain, their "C" average how can it
influence the study habits in the
houses?
Their failure scholastically during
their freshman year is not, to my
way of thinking, at least, due to study
conditions on the Row. As to its ef
fect toward encouraging a high aver
age on the freshman's part, I should
think he has enough pressure on him
already. He needs a "C" average to
be initiated into his fraternity. He
needs a "C" average to enter upper
division. He needs a "C" average to
graduate. If he fails under all the
existing inducements, will this new
one create the magic key to open
wide the doors of knowledge for him?
Perhaps this is just the start of a
new era on the Row. Some day it
may become a wonderful institution
if this legislative campaign is carried
forward diligently. These may be the
first steps toward the ultimate goal
when a Phi Beta Kappa key will be
a requirement before anyone may
tread that intellectualist's sanctum,
once known as the Row.
Until that day, however, some of
the illiterate rabble who exist in that
den of ignorance known as the Row
wouldst. crave of our high and mighty
student leaders an enlightenment as
to how this most excellent rule is go
ing to work. Ignoramus
