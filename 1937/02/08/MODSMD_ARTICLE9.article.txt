# Congress Considers Court Cathcart Appraises Plan
## 
### 
Speedier justice in inferior courts
as provided for in the President's
judicial reorganization proposal, is a
commendable objective, but Profes
sor Arthur M. Cathcai't could see no
way in which more justices could ex
pedite business in the Supreme
Court.
Meanwhile, Bruce A. Wright, in
structor in political science, could see
no violent attempt to liberalize the
courts in the reorganization plan.
Most important of four proposals
made by the President is the one ap
plying to the Supreme Coui - t, accord
ing to Professor Cathcart. The ap
pointing of new judges for each
member over 70 years of age would
add six new men. Speeding up of the
process could not possibly be ef
fected by this, Professor Cathcart
maintained, because every justice
considers each case and a greater
number would only add confusion,
although in the lower courts more
judges could handle more cases.
The only possible reason that could
be seen for the proposal is the Presi
dent's desire for judicial co-operation
in New Deal legislation. Six new jus
tices, "hand-picked to stand hitched,"
would be a great aid toward this ob
jective, Professor Cathcart said.
Mr. Wright saw no reason to be
lieve that younger men would take
less seriously the duty of the courts
to preserve "American institutions."
Opposition to the recommendations
designed to eliminate "the law's de
lay" would be unfounded, he added.
