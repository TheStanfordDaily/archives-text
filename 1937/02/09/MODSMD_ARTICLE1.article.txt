## MR. HEARST STILL SENDS OBSCENE MATTER BY MAIL 
### 
W/'ILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST,
the ape with the asserted monk
ey glands, proved yesterday that you
can rejuvenate any fool but an old
fool.
The proof was another Hearst
'scoop." It will be so called by his
sleazy coterie of "yes" men. To you,
it was an article in the Examiner on
Red atrocities in Spain, written by
someone who should be most willing
to talk of Red atrocities — Fascist
General Francisco Franco.
We cite Willie's alleged monkey
glands as being largely responsible
for the publication of the Franco ar
ticle—with pictures more sickening
than sensational.
For if the monkey-glands arc efli
cient, and Willie has given every rea
son to believe they are, ihey explain
why Hearst can turn the journalist
clock back 18 years and in 1936 the
same propaganda techniques as were
popular during the Hun-scares of
1917.
* * *
IT'S SIMPLY that Willie feels as
young in 193G as he did in 1918,
and that he doesn't realize the world
has grown older.
Hearst hasn't that much sense,
which should come with age if the
ageing process is not interfered with.
He still thinks the old brain is just
as sharp as it used to be, that the
American public is just as dumb as it
was during the Spanish-American
and World wars.
*! ♦ *
he's half right. The public is
just as dumb.
But even the U.S. citizen, most
gullible reaction machine in the
western hemisphere, is tending more
and more to laugh at Mr. Hearst. He
long ago failed to justify considera
tion as a menace. And the time he
really ruled public opinion in Amer
ica is a mellow legend.
Anyone else would, if he could
read the public mandate, have re
tired to San Simeon with Notches
and sodas, a pair of collies and a
stock of carpet slippers. But not
Hearst. Not so long as there is a
half-lie in the world to print as a
half-truth.
* Ifl *
YESTERDAY the stomachs of
Hearst's millions of readers
turned over a few times before the
most obsence story and page of atroc
ity pictures that, ever were sent
through the mails outside a plain en
velope.
There's hardly time to mention that
the pictures are probably fakes,
taken anywhere but in Spain. And
it seems needless to mention that if
the pictures were taken on an Iberian
battlefield the photographer who
took them didn't know whether a
Fascist had committed murder or a
Red, nor much care.
And we need hardly dwell on the
fact that the page was probably the
most unjustified bit of pandering-to
the-morbid since the famous Gray
Snyder execution picture.
But what is significant is that
Hearst published the same kind of
pictures in 1918 to show what the
Germans had done to the Belgians.
And if the monkey glands hold out,
Hearst may be able to pick up the
phone in five years and order pic
tures of "what the Russians arc do
ing to the Japanese."
