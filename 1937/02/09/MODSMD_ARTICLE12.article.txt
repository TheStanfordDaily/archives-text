# County Fair Staged In Union Today
## Women's Party Features Auction, Fashion Show; Funds for Scholarship 
### 
Auctions, food sales, and a 10-cent
admission price will help Stanford
women form a new scholarship fund
this afternoon, when Women's Con
ference presents the County Fair
from 2 to 5:30 in the Union Court.
Replacing the old Conference
Party, which was formerly held each
autumn quarter, County Fair is open
to all campus women. A feature of
the afternoon will be a fashion show
in the Women's Clubhouse. Profes
sional mannequins from five leading
San Francisco stores will model.
The auction sale, with Leo Heag
erty as auctioneer, will start at 4
o'clock, when scarves, blouses, cakes,
mittens, and various novelties which
have been donated by San Francisco
and Palo Alto merchants will be sold
to the highest bidders.
Refreshment booths will be set
up in the Union Court, as will palm
istry and game tents. Ice cream has
been donated by Millbrae Creamery,
hot dogs, and rolls by Liddicott's, and
cookies by the Home Food Shop.
Caramel apples, pop corn and pea
nuts will also be sold for five or
ten cents.
The work in preparation for the
fair was divided among the classes
into committees. The senior commit
tee, headed by Phyllis Booth, is in
charge of the Fashion Show; the jun
ior committee with Chairman Sis
Coonley, arranged the auction; deco
rations for the booths and court have
been set up by the sophomore com
mittee, headed by Carolyn Hibbard.
Jeanne Cutler's freshman committee
is in charge of the refreshments.
Balloons, crepe paper, and flashy
poster signs will add to the gaiety of
the carnival spirit. Games of carnival
fame such as pitching pennies and
popping balloons furnish further en
tertainment.
