# Treasure Under Wilbur's Home? Old-Timer Tells of Ancient Tale
## Spaniard Relates Tale Of Bandits, Buried Loot 
### 
Does buried treasure underlie Dr. |
Wilbur's home? It's a possibility, ;
and Beer-jointer A1 Mesa has an- j
cestors to prove it.
Roughs who know their way along
the highway know A1 as the big
Spaniard who slings beer and spins
yarns across the bar of his "Smoke
Shop."
Many have heard him tell of j
Grandad Mesa, who captained Span
ish forces at the Presidio, wielded a
butchering sword (now in Stanford
Museum) against the Mexicans,
gave his name to a San Francisco
street.
j But ffcw have heard him hark back
| to tales his grandmother used to tell
! of treasure buried deep in the Stan
ford hills. He tells people he "never
paid no attention to that kinda stuff
. . . that kind stuff all bull."
Tells of Highwaymen
But keep after him, and maybe
you'll hear (he yarn he "didn't pay j
no attention to—"
Tn Vigilante days many were the
highwaymen who rode and thieved
from San Francisco to San Jose.
1 Their victims were gambling houses,
saloons, travelers along the road.
Dona Mesa, who owned Alta Mesa
ranch west of Mayfield, was famous
for her herb-cures, and often des
peradoes dropped in to have shat
tered arms fixed up or bullets pulled
out of their torsos.
Usually while she doctored one
bandit, her stables were being rob
bed bv a dozen of his fellow bandits.
But they kept her horses nearby—
their camp was on the hill that rises
1 to the northwest of Page Mill Koad.
Cemetery Unearthed

Sometimes Dona Mesa's patient
died. Then her Indian servants bur
ied the body in a small cemetery.
The loot they left behind in her cus
tody, which accumulated to quite a
sum during the course of many years,
she buried in a corner of the grave
yard.
When excavations for the Presi
dent's home began, Dona Mesa's
bandit cemetery was discovered, and

the graves of about a half a dozen
persons unearthed. The buried loot,
however, has never been found.
Asked if he would claim the treas
ure should some Stanfordite find it
while puttering around Dr. Wilbur's
home, Al shrugged his shoulders,
grunted, "No!" Asked what he would
say if such a thing happened, he
chuckled, "I'd say ho was pretty
darned luckv!"


AL MESA, now owner of a bar on El Caniino Real, claims that,his
grandparents buried stolen gold on the site where President Wilbur's
home now stands.
