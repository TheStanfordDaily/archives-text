# Students Will Cast Ballots For A.S.S.U. Candidates, Amendments at Precincts
## New System Inaugurated Today with 3 Polling Places Scene of Voting 
### JOHN RICE 
Stanford's student body, four thou
sand strong, goes to the polls today
to inaugurate a precinct voting sys
tem which includes three separate
precincts open from 7:45 until 2
o'clock.
According to the new ruling, bal
loting centers will be set up at the
Law steps, the Engineering corncr,
and the Geology corner.
Students from Toyon, Branner,
Encina, and all downtown residences
will vote at Precinct I, the Law steps.
The Row, and Union Unit will vote
at Precinct 11, the Engineering cor
ner, and Roble, Lagunita, and Se
quoia will vote at Precinct 111, the
Geology corner.
Students who are not sure where
to cast their ballots should vote at
the Law steps, according to Dave
JUlison, election chairman.
Reynolds Supports Amendments
Besides election of officers three
sections of the A.S.S.U. Constitution

will be submitted for amendment.
President Jim Reynolds supports
these as "practicable and neces
sary." He says:
"Proposed by a unanimous vote of
Ex Committee, these amendments arc*
the result of the experience that we
have all had under the present sys
tem. The change in date of the spring
elections is merely suggested so as to
give newly elected officers a chance
to learn something about their new
positions from observing their prede
cessors. Mistakes will be ironed out
and the new executives will be bet
ter equipped to assume their new
duties the following fall. Under the
present system, elections come too
close to the end of the year to allow
this.
"The purpose of electing three
Council members in February is
merely to have three rather than two
old members return the following
fall. As for example, last fall neither
of the old members of Men's Council
returned to Stanford, thus leaving a
completely inexperienced council to
take office."
Forty-two candidates running for
13 A.S.S.U. positions arc:
YELL LEADER: Jim Ransohofl
and Nelson Wheeler.
ASSISTANT YELL LEADERS:
Merritt Cutten, George Egan, Bill
Todd, Lomax Turner, and Dwight
