# Storey Warns Lake Swimmers of Colds
## 
### 
Early season swimmers in Lagunita are exposed to danger of colds and
nasal infections from organisms in the water, I)r. Thomas A. Storey, men's
health warned yesterday.
The lake is still full of organisms swept from the wide watersheds back
of the campus. A few weeks of sunlight will kill these bacteria and warm

the water sufficiently to increase'
bodily resistance to colds, he de
clared.
Canoeing, however, is in full
swing, with increasing use of the
lake every day from 10 to 10 o'clock.
Safety floats have not yet been an
chored around the lake, although a
few spills have already occurred.
As yet no rule has been made to the
effect that everyone taking a canoe
out must be a swimmer, but one
may be made later.
Other safety rules include the use
of a life preserver with every canoe,
and the loss of canoeing privileges
to participants of canoe fights.
Students may use canoes if their
house or club has paid for boat
house storage. Except that Roble
ites must secure their paddles from
Roble Hall, and that Toyon and
Branner club members must present
their club cards, students may se
cure canoes by asking for them.
Pledges are usually allowed to use
their houses' canoes.
