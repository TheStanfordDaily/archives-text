# Alumni Plan To Reorganize
## Committee To Consider Drafting Constitution 
### 
Reorganization, which may involve
the drafting of a new constitution, is
being considered by the Alumni As
sociation, according to Harlow Roth
ert, secretary.
The main purpose of this is to
make it more representative of its
members. No definite action will be
taken until the annual meeting next
May 8. Members of the committee
on reorganization are Mr. Paul Davis,
chairman, Dean Marion Rice Kirk
wood of the Law School, Judge
Homer Spence, Mrs. J. Howell, and
Mr. G. Dickson Clark.
The alumni will hold conferences
for adult education in Portland, Se
attle, Spokane, Los Angeles, and at
Stanford with 20 members of the fac
ulty leading discussions on current
problems. Those in the Pacific
Northwest will be held February 20,
21, and 22. Plans are also being
made for University Day on May 8.
