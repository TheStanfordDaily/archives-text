# 'Big Money' Enlivens Masque Ball Conflicts
## 
### IRVIN JORGENSEN 
This article concludes a series of six tracing the history of the
Masque Ball, to come up for judging once again before Ex Committee
tonight.—The Editor.

"Organization'' was the cry of sororities when the Masque Ball fell un
der the Beaubaire touch. The Thetas systematically collected funds from
their members, pledges, fraternity men stooges, and alumnae, and amassed
their tremendous kitty. At the last minute, the D.G.'s scuttled their candi
date, threw in with the Thetas. The Alpha Phis saw the jig was up,
threw in their $140. ♦

The Thetas got their queen. In the
excitement that followed, with three
Sigma Chis and the S.F. Examiner
kidnaping the Queen the day of the
Ball, everyone forgot the organiza
tion for funds. But only until next
year.
Next year, the Alpha Phis used the
identical organizational technique.
This time they used the threat of a
hall woman for their fear psychoses.
Biting, catty rumors spread around
the Row, following the Ramming
sky-writing episode. The entire Row
pooled its resources to prevent "that
woman" from winning. As a matter
of fact, the sky-writing episode, un
authorized by Ramming, was no
worse than the less public devices
that the Row used to leech money.
Last year, it was the same story.
The organization was even more
frantic than in years past. The move
to ding the Masque Ball Contest
originated in the Publications Coun
cil. The Thetas, under the competi
tive pressure, had solicited funds
from Palo Alto merchants on the
basis "that it is going to the Con
valescent Home," and the merchants
reported to campus periodicals that
they had no money to advertise with
them for several months.
It was ORGANIZATION that
hoisted proceeds from $175.15 in
1933 to $4,021 in 1936. It was OR
GANIZATION brought on by inter

group rivalries, hates, and fears, that
took the King and Queen Contest out
of the innocent, collegiate - prank
class and into the field of Big Busi
ness. ORGANIZATION is the reason
why it was killed, and the reason
why, the year after it was killed,
that nobody, except the organized,
pressure - group, prestige - sodden,
star-spangled Cardinals cared very
much whether it was revived or not.

of fact, the sky-writing episode, un
authorized by Ramming, was no
worse than the less public devices
that the Row used to leech money.
Last year, it was the same story.
The organization was even more
frantic than in years past. The move
to ding the Masque Ball Contest
originated in the Publications Coun
cil. The Thetas, under the competi
tive pressure, had solicited funds
from Palo Alto merchants on the
basis "that it is going to the Con
valescent Home," and the merchants
reported to campus periodicals that
they had no money to advertise with
them for several months.
It was ORGANIZATION that
hoisted proceeds from $175.15 in
1933 to $4,021 in 1936. It was OR
GANIZATION brought on by inter

group rivalries, hates, and fears, that
took the King and Queen Contest out
of the innocent, collegiate - prank
class and into the field of Big Busi
ness. ORGANIZATION is the reason
why it was killed, and the reason
why, the year after it was killed,
that nobody, except the organized,
pressure - group, prestige - sodden,
star-spangled Cardinals cared very
much whether it was revived or not.
This article concludes a series of six tracing the history of the
Masque Ball, to come up for judging once again before Ex Committee
tonight.—The Editor.

"Organization'' was the cry of sororities when the Masque Ball fell un
der the Beaubaire touch. The Thetas systematically collected funds from
their members, pledges, fraternity men stooges, and alumnae, and amassed
their tremendous kitty. At the last minute, the D.G.'s scuttled their candi
date, threw in with the Thetas. The Alpha Phis saw the jig was up,
threw in their $140. ♦

The Thetas got their queen. In the
excitement that followed, with three
Sigma Chis and the S.F. Examiner
kidnaping the Queen the day of the
Ball, everyone forgot the organiza
tion for funds. But only until next
year.
Next year, the Alpha Phis used the
identical organizational technique.
This time they used the threat of a
hall woman for their fear psychoses.
Biting, catty rumors spread around
the Row, following the Ramming
sky-writing episode. The entire Row
pooled its resources to prevent "that
woman" from winning. As a matter
of fact, the sky-writing episode, un
authorized by Ramming, was no
worse than the less public devices
that the Row used to leech money.
