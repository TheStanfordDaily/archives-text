# Ferris Famed Expert On Blood-sucking Insect
## 
### PHIL BERNHEIM 
There's a tiny corner of Stanford
that is literally the lousiest place in
the world.
For there, in the natural history
museum, tucked away in back of the
main Museum, Gordon Ferris, asso
ciate professor of biology, keeps the
world's largest collection of lice.
Over 220 species are represented
in the collection, which took more
than 20 years to accumulate. Most of
these are blood-sucking lice, the
kinds that live in the hair of mam
mals.
Wrote on Lice
Almost from the time of his grad
uation in 1916, Professor Ferris has
kept the University Press busy pub
lishing his "Contributions Toward a
Monograph on the Sucking Lice,"
for which he is world famous.
Professor Ferris is a rotund, jovial
man with a keen sense of humor. He
doesn't like, naturally enough, to be
called "the louse man," as some pa
pers have termed him. He doesn't
like, either, the angle that his collec
tion makes Stanford the lousiest
place in the world, but admits it's
probably the most interesting one for
Daily i-eaders.
Most Specimens Dead
Nor did he care to be pictured
feeding his lice by letting them suck
on his arm, as a flea-circus keeper
feeds his insects. Most of the Ferris
collection, anyway, are dead lice on
microscopic slides; only a few are
alive.
The louse is an exclusive sort of
creature, according to Ferris, and an
incurable stay-at-home. Because
his feet are so constructed that he
can cling only to hair or feathers and
has no other means of transportation,
he has to stay in the forest of hair in
which he was hatched, and can only
go traveling onto the body of a sim
ilar host-animal when two hosts of
the same species are in close contact.
Louse Picks It Home
And different animals are inhab
ited by lice of different and special
ized species, each adapted to his par
ticular host.
Lice, by the way, are not a rarity
on human beings. In fact, lousiness
is a normal condition. Three-fourths
of the world's population are so in
habited, according to Ferris.

The louse is an exclusive sort of
creature, according to Ferris, and an
incurable stay-at-home. Because
his feet are so constructed that he
can cling only to hair or feathers and
has no other means of transportation,
he has to stay in the forest of hair in
which he was hatched, and can only
go traveling onto the body of a sim
ilar host-animal when two hosts of
the same species are in close contact.
Louse Picks It Home
And different animals are inhab
ited by lice of different and special
ized species, each adapted to his par
ticular host.
Lice, by the way, are not a rarity
on human beings. In fact, lousiness
is a normal condition. Three-fourths
of the world's population are so in
habited, according to Ferris.

There's a tiny corner of Stanford
that is literally the lousiest place in
the world.
For there, in the natural history
museum, tucked away in back of the
main Museum, Gordon Ferris, asso
ciate professor of biology, keeps the
world's largest collection of lice.
Over 220 species are represented
in the collection, which took more
than 20 years to accumulate. Most of
these are blood-sucking lice, the
kinds that live in the hair of mam
mals.
Wrote on Lice
Almost from the time of his grad
uation in 1916, Professor Ferris has
kept the University Press busy pub
lishing his "Contributions Toward a
Monograph on the Sucking Lice,"
for which he is world famous.
Professor Ferris is a rotund, jovial
man with a keen sense of humor. He
doesn't like, naturally enough, to be
called "the louse man," as some pa
pers have termed him. He doesn't
like, either, the angle that his collec
tion makes Stanford the lousiest
place in the world, but admits it's
probably the most interesting one for
Daily i-eaders.
Most Specimens Dead
Nor did he care to be pictured
feeding his lice by letting them suck
on his arm, as a flea-circus keeper
feeds his insects. Most of the Ferris
collection, anyway, are dead lice on
microscopic slides; only a few are
alive.
