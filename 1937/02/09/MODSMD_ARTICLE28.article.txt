# Stoefen Named Row's Choice For Junior Man
## Greeks Meet in Unofficial Caucus, Pick Hoopster To Oppose Calderwood 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM, JR 
It was the night before election,
and all along the Row not a creature
was stirring, not even a Sigma Chi.
But five Greeks still dreamed last
night of being Junior Man. Names of
Delt Jack Beman, Kappa Sig Curt
Eaton, Phi Delt Bob Mcßoskey, and
Phi Psi George Veness will all ap
pear on the ballots this morning,
but —
Last night representatives of all
five gathered at the Kappa Sig house.
After discussing life and Stanford
women they came to the decision
that it would be much better politics
if only one man ran against Toro's
powerhouse, Basketballer Jack Cal
derwood.
This was no caucus! Still it would
be nice to have a Row man take over
Franich's old job. Discussion waxed
hot, cooled off and was finally nar
rowed down to Mcßoskey and Stoe
fen, then only to Stoefen.
Mcßoskey, on one side, is well
known, a Phi Delt, and did a good
job on last year's Sophomore Car
nival. Art Sfoefen, on the other,

plays side by side with Calderwood
on the varsity basketball team.
Stoefen got the nomination. Mc-
Roskey is being saved for bigger and
beter things, and besides — this is
the basketball season.
