# Union Nitery Plans Up For O.K. Tonight
## Ex Committee To Settle Matter of King-Queen Contest; Group Reports 
### 
With the Lagunita recreation
center petition termed "only an ex
pression of viewpoint" yesterday by
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the law
school, the A.S.S.U.'s "supreme
court," Ex Committee will tonight
go into the final round of its bout
with the nitery—final cost estimates
on redecorating the Old Union's
A.S.S.U. lobby.
Dean Kirkwood, in his official
"decision" to President Jim Rey
nolds, declared that "the resolution
is merely the expression of view
point of those who have signed it
and should be considered by the
Executive Committee only as such."
Petition May Be Dropped
He explained that nowhere in the
A.S.S.U. Constitution is provision
made for any binding instructions to
Ex Committee. If the petitioners,
led by Bill Ward, still want to push
their resolution, they can put it on
a special student-body ballot by
framing it as a constitutional amend
ment. Ward said yesterday, how
ever, that the whole matter will
probably be dropped.
Besides going over estimates from
the Corp Yard and professional in
terior decorators for the Union re
juvenation, tonight's meeting will
settle once and for all what is to
become of the Masque Ball King-
Queen contest.
May Revamp Contest
Appointed last week, Reynolds'
subcommittee—Esther Pelton, Chick
Franich, and Fred Williams —will re
port on its findings. Details of a
revamped contest, if Ex Committee
decides to hold one, will probably
be decided definitely tonight.
Reynolds also hopes to start an in
vestigation of the nominating-as
sembly plan of presenting A.S.S.U.
candidates to the student body. Last
week's assembly proved, he thinks,
that some better method can be
found.
If Ex Committee is still doubtful
of the campus' stand on the nitery
question, an all-University forum
may be held to get co-ordinated stu
dent opinion, Reynolds said.
