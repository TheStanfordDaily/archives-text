RUGBY IS A SWELL
CiAME TO WATCII

Nobody much ever comes out to
watch the rugby games, because no- j
body much thinks that rugby is any j
shucks as an interesting sport. But |
there's a lot of room for argument on
the point, because there are a few old
faithfuls that keep right on going to
every game, getting more kick out of j
the ruggers than out of watching men i
like Grayson play American loot ball, j
The game has everything that j
American football has, science, fire,
physical contact, and such, and it's a j
great sport to watch, in spite of the
hordes of disbelievers. There isn t j
the type of organization in rugby that
there is in football, lining up in a def- j
inite system before each play and I
driving from a set formation, but the
open field play is a lot more colorful.
Laterals are an innovation in foot
ball, but they're old stuff in rugger.
Probably the lack of organization
is responsible for the lack of sup
port, because it's more fun to try
and figure out what a team is going!
to do when it gets set as it does in [
football, besides making it easier to j
understand. Nevertheless, watching |
rugby has plenty of good arguments, j
Come and see a game some time; i
maybe it will turn into a habit.

STUDENT SUPPORT
HELPS A LOT

Coach Harry Wolter has a good j
baseball team this year, it seems
from early developments, for al- I
though the outfit has been rained out j
of several games it has won its only |
two starts. For the past few years ;
Stanford ball clubs have not been j
too much to brag about, but things'
are looking up so far this season.
Coach Wolter doesn't have the j
trouble of support that Coach Ma
loney has with rugby, at least forj
the same reason, for he coaches a j
game that is established as the na- ■
tional sport. He does have trouble
getting support, though, and it. hurts
a team plenty to find that nobody is i
interested in seeing it play. The I
crowds that go to see California j
baseball teams play show that there's j
nothing wrong with collegiate base- j
ball as a sport, but it's the people that I
refuse to see Stanford play that cause
the hard times here.
If the pastimers got plenty of sup
port for their home games, it would !
help a lot in restoring the grand old 1
game to its former proportions here. |
The days when Stanford had one of j
the finest teams on the Coast could I
well be brought back, but it would I
take a little help from the students
in a spectatorish way. Give Harry j
half a chance this year, and he will!
turn out a good team. The boys play j
their first conference game Saturday, j
against Santa Clara, and they stand a |
swell chance of winning. It would be
a bigger chance if they had somebody '
to play in front of, sorta.

THE FROSH WON
IN SPITE OF J. BUNN

The frosh basketball team had a j
lough time winning Saturday night |
against the U.S.F. frosh. but maybe !
that was because Coach Wytze Gor- j
tor was slightly incapacitated with '
the mumps. He wasn't around, so j
Dale Huff ran the team with John j
Bunn's assistance. Bunn, however, I
left the bench in the exciting closing j
stages, saying, "I'm not going to take j
a chance on losing Wytze's game for |
him The handicap turned out to be i
not quite enough, as the frosh won
by a point.
Ted Lyon, out with the flu for the
past week, was back in harness last
night, taking a few shots to work
himself back into shape. There was
no practice, but the Piedmont lad
took a slight warm-up. He's a handy
guy in Gorter's outfit, and will be
welcomed back to the fold.
The cold dope on the receipts for
flood charity from the Stanfoixl-
U.S.F. basketball game in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium Satur
day, in spite of all estimates to the
contrary, is this: There were 394S
paid admissions, with a check foi
$3733.60 going to the Red Cross
Regular admissions were a dollar,
but the discrepancy came from the
sale of rooters' tickets at 50 cents
each.

HEEZ BEEG, DEES
BOY MONTGOMERY

Pretty soon the metabolism boys
will have to go to work on this kid
Tom Montgomery, new varsity shot
put transfer from S.M.J.C. The kid
didn't go out for football before be
cause in high school he was (5-5 and
weighed 155. Now he is 6-8, weigh
ing 255. having gained 25 pounds and
two inches since last season.
Last year he put 45-4, and this
year has already done 48-5, which
is still ahead of Jim Reynolds so far.
Jim, you remember, is a 51-10 man.
maybe the strongest point winner on
this year's team, and here is Mont
gomery a foot ahead of him! "Fifty
three this spring if he learns how,"
says Dink.
Tom has two seasons of eligibility,
if he doesn't first break the ex
chequer. Several houses and clubs
have been on his tail, but he says,
"They'd make me pay double board
bill. I'm going to stay here in En
cina where I can get enough to eat."
The B.A.C. is still trying to buy size
1 fi shoes for him; he's using 14's with
the toes cut out now.

THE FROSH WON
IN SPITE OF J. BUNN

The frosh basketball team had a j
lough time winning Saturday night |
against the U.S.F. frosh. but maybe !
that was because Coach Wytze Gor- j
tor was slightly incapacitated with '
the mumps. He wasn't around, so j
Dale Huff ran the team with John j
Bunn's assistance. Bunn, however, I
left the bench in the exciting closing j
stages, saying, "I'm not going to take j
a chance on losing Wytze's game for |
him The handicap turned out to be i
not quite enough, as the frosh won
by a point.
Ted Lyon, out with the flu for the
past week, was back in harness last
night, taking a few shots to work
himself back into shape. There was
no practice, but the Piedmont lad
took a slight warm-up. He's a handy
guy in Gorter's outfit, and will be
welcomed back to the fold.
The cold dope on the receipts for

paid admissions, with a check foi

RUGBY IS A SWELL
CiAME TO WATCII

Nobody much ever comes out to
watch the rugby games, because no- j
body much thinks that rugby is any j
shucks as an interesting sport. But |
there's a lot of room for argument on
the point, because there are a few old
faithfuls that keep right on going to
every game, getting more kick out of j
the ruggers than out of watching men i
like Grayson play American loot ball, j
The game has everything that j
American football has, science, fire,
physical contact, and such, and it's a j
great sport to watch, in spite of the
hordes of disbelievers. There isn t j
the type of organization in rugby that
there is in football, lining up in a def- j
inite system before each play and I
driving from a set formation, but the
open field play is a lot more colorful.
Laterals are an innovation in foot
ball, but they're old stuff in rugger.
Probably the lack of organization
is responsible for the lack of sup
port, because it's more fun to try
and figure out what a team is going!

football, besides making it easier to j
understand. Nevertheless, watching |

STUDENT SUPPORT

Coach Harry Wolter has a good j
baseball team this year, it seems

though the outfit has been rained out j
of several games it has won its only |
two starts. For the past few years ;
Stanford ball clubs have not been j
too much to brag about, but things'
are looking up so far this season.
Coach Wolter doesn't have the j
trouble of support that Coach Ma
loney has with rugby, at least forj
the same reason, for he coaches a j
game that is established as the na- ■
tional sport. He does have trouble
getting support, though, and it. hurts
a team plenty to find that nobody is i
interested in seeing it play. The I
crowds that go to see California j
baseball teams play show that there's j
nothing wrong with collegiate base- j
ball as a sport, but it's the people that I

RUGBY IS A SWELL
CiAME TO WATCII

Nobody much ever comes out to
watch the rugby games, because no- j
body much thinks that rugby is any j
shucks as an interesting sport. But |
there's a lot of room for argument on
the point, because there are a few old
faithfuls that keep right on going to
every game, getting more kick out of j
the ruggers than out of watching men i
like Grayson play American loot ball, j
The game has everything that j
American football has, science, fire,
physical contact, and such, and it's a j
great sport to watch, in spite of the
hordes of disbelievers. There isn t j
the type of organization in rugby that
there is in football, lining up in a def- j
inite system before each play and I
driving from a set formation, but the
open field play is a lot more colorful.
Laterals are an innovation in foot
ball, but they're old stuff in rugger.
Probably the lack of organization
is responsible for the lack of sup
port, because it's more fun to try
and figure out what a team is going!
to do when it gets set as it does in [
football, besides making it easier to j
understand. Nevertheless, watching |
rugby has plenty of good arguments, j
Come and see a game some time; i
maybe it will turn into a habit.

STUDENT SUPPORT
HELPS A LOT

Coach Harry Wolter has a good j
baseball team this year, it seems
from early developments, for al- I
though the outfit has been rained out j
of several games it has won its only |
two starts. For the past few years ;
Stanford ball clubs have not been j
too much to brag about, but things'
are looking up so far this season.
Coach Wolter doesn't have the j
trouble of support that Coach Ma
loney has with rugby, at least forj
the same reason, for he coaches a j
game that is established as the na- ■
tional sport. He does have trouble
getting support, though, and it. hurts
a team plenty to find that nobody is i
interested in seeing it play. The I
crowds that go to see California j
baseball teams play show that there's j
nothing wrong with collegiate base- j
ball as a sport, but it's the people that I
refuse to see Stanford play that cause
the hard times here.
If the pastimers got plenty of sup
port for their home games, it would !
help a lot in restoring the grand old 1
game to its former proportions here. |
The days when Stanford had one of j
the finest teams on the Coast could I
well be brought back, but it would I
take a little help from the students
in a spectatorish way. Give Harry j
half a chance this year, and he will!
turn out a good team. The boys play j
their first conference game Saturday, j
against Santa Clara, and they stand a |
swell chance of winning. It would be
a bigger chance if they had somebody '
to play in front of, sorta.

THE FROSH WON
IN SPITE OF J. BUNN

The frosh basketball team had a j
lough time winning Saturday night |
against the U.S.F. frosh. but maybe !
that was because Coach Wytze Gor- j
tor was slightly incapacitated with '
the mumps. He wasn't around, so j
Dale Huff ran the team with John j
Bunn's assistance. Bunn, however, I
left the bench in the exciting closing j
stages, saying, "I'm not going to take j
a chance on losing Wytze's game for |
him The handicap turned out to be i
not quite enough, as the frosh won
by a point.
Ted Lyon, out with the flu for the
past week, was back in harness last
night, taking a few shots to work
himself back into shape. There was
no practice, but the Piedmont lad
took a slight warm-up. He's a handy
guy in Gorter's outfit, and will be
welcomed back to the fold.
The cold dope on the receipts for
flood charity from the Stanfoixl-
U.S.F. basketball game in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium Satur
day, in spite of all estimates to the
contrary, is this: There were 394S
paid admissions, with a check foi
$3733.60 going to the Red Cross
Regular admissions were a dollar,
but the discrepancy came from the
sale of rooters' tickets at 50 cents
