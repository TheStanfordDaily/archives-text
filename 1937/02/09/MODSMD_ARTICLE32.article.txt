# Bunn Designs Guard Play for Bruin Game
## 
### GORDY FROST 
Engineer John Bunn—he got his M.E. at Kansas —has gone about prepa- !
ratio 's for the coming week-end's haskcthall festivals with U.C.L.A. with |
the characteristic accuracy of his profession.
Yesterday, while most of his first varsity rested, Bunn laid down two
objectives for the week's work. j
First. Stanford will work on its new guard-through defense, a set-up
designed primarily to stymie the Bruins' man-to-man defensive system ;

twhich will probably be used when
they meet Stanford's Redshirts on the
Los Angeles Pan-Pacific Auditorium
floor Friday and Saturday nights.
Has One Point
Stanford already has a "regular"
guard-through, in which the center
pulls out from his spot under the
hoop to the free throw line, then
swings out to the forward position.
The new system, used to mix the
erstwhile Bruin up a bit, involves es
sentially the same set T up except that
the center moves immediately out to
forward, and the forward goes to the
free throw line.
It's all infinitely involved without
diagramatical explanation, but let
Engineer Bunn swing into action
with his chalk and board, and you'll
have it cold.
Objective No. 2
Number two objective for the week
is the cleaning up of Stanford's de
fensive guarding. Bunn felt that
there were altogether too many de
fensive fouls called on his Redshirts
last week-end and he's out to remedy
the situation. It's not that any off
color guarding was done, nothing like
that, but simply some'foolish errors
in guarding technique that led to the
shrill of the foul whistle.
Cripples Work Out
Jack Calclerwood and Howie Turn
er worked yesterday afternoon since
both felt the necessity for smoothing
out recent ailments. Calderwood's
mild appendicitis touch left no ill
effects, and gave no indication of re
turning, in fact, doctors are not even
sure that it wasn't just a bad attack
of the well known "tummy-ache."
Turner's arch injury was completely
forgotten.
Today, Jack and Howie will be
joined by the rest of the first varsity
for concentrated work on Bunn's ob
jectives, No. 1 and No. 2.
