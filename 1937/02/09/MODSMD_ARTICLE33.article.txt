Games played, 10; games won, 10;
per cent, 1000.
Thai's the formidable record hung
up so far this season by Wytze Goi
ter's powerful Papoose basketballers,
who have met more than a few sup
posedly "tough" teams.
And this team, carrying the colors
of the Class of '40, isn't one that
merely wins games by scoring a few
more points than their opponents.
It's a team that has thwacked every
team, with one exception, that it has
come up against by a good margin.
The only close game the Papoose
quintet has had was its latest, against
the U.S.F. frosh. which they won by
only one point, 30-29.
In the ten games they have played,
the Papooses have scored a total of
413 points to their opponents 308,
for averages per game of 41.3 and
30.8, respectively.
With six more games to go, the
Papooses are pushing hard to be the
first undefeated frosh team in many
a year. The schedule for the rest of
the season follows:
Feb. 13, Auburn High; Feb. 19, Cal
Frosh at Berkeley; Feb. 20. Santa
Clara Frosh; Feb. 26, California
High; Feb. 27, Piedmont High;
March 5, Cal Frosh. Unless otherwise
noted, all games are here.
