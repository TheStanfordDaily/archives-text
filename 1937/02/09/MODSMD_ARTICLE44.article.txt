# Garage—French Word, Chinese Puzzle
## 
### 
COMPTROLLER ROTH is stymied—and he
admits it. And when Roth is stymied,
that is Stanford's "dog bites man" story. It's
news.
This time Roth is not thinking of his possible
new job, he's biting into a long-standing issue
buried deep in the old one.
Stanford needs garages. Seventeen hundred
cars roll the roads of the Farm, and only a small
number of these ever get adequate cover. The
problem roots in the very nature of Stanford's
housing set-up, where groups in excess of 50
car owners live on a lot equivalent in size to
that occupied by two or three car owners off
campus.
Roth has thought of a central garage, but his
recent questionnaire proved that scheme finan
cially impractical. He considered throwing up
several smaller auto housing units, but then de
cided that every time a Stanford man blew his
nose he'd see a garage wall nestled among the
arches and red tile roofs.
He has considered building individual ga
rages for individual living groups, but this plan
rests on the proverbial banana peel since most
groups would rather supervise their own con
struction than have the University handle it and
submit the usual bill. Halls could be provided
with shelter, but that would be only a partial
panacea.
Roth seeks a plan that v/ill cover Stanford
paint jobs thoroughly, if it is done at all, and
he's run the gamut of ideas down to thoughts of
underground storage below the new Pavilion,
if and v/hen.
Meanwhile, Stanford's Comptroller offers the
leather medal for a solution, while Farm fenders
continue to rust. —G. F.

flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in
