# A 						"Yes" Vote
## 
### 
YOU probably didn't read the columns of
6-point type-matter we published last week
—proposed amendments to the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution. We don't blame you. Besides ruining
your eyes, you wouldn't have known much
more about them when you finished than you
did when you started. A student-body ruling
reguired us to print them.
But your annoyance shouldn't let you ding
ihem when you see them on the ballot again
loday.
A majority "yes" vote on Article VII would
change spring elections from the third Tuesday
m May to the third Tuesday in spring guarter,
pushing voting on the major student-body offi
cers almost a month ahead.
Last year the present A.S.S.U. administration
was elected in a furious pre-finals rush. Caucus
activities dipped into the Convalescent Home
Drive. The election itself disturbed end-guarter
studying. And most important, perhaps, the
new officers had little time to learn the reguire
ments of their jobs from those they succeeded.
Conseguence was, when fall guarter opened
four months later, executives and Ex Commit
teemen were "greenhorns," at a loss to know
just how to start off.
With elections a month earlier, campus poli
tics will fill up that first-of-the-guarter drag,
won't interfere with later activities. And the
new A.S.S.U. president and his confreres will
have time to dope out plans and policies for
the next year.
The other two amendments, sections 2b and
2c of Article 111, will correct—if the student
body upholds them today—a less obvious con
stitutional oversight. A year ago two Men's
Councilmen, Phil Duffy and Gib Holloway,
were elected to serve from February to Febru
ary to carry over Council policies from one
school year to the next. Neither, however, ac
tually returned in September. The three mem
bers named in May we re green, and when a
special election in October replaced Duffy and
Holloway, the whole Council started from
scratch.

Ex Committee seeks to diminish the possi
bility of this situation repeating —in either
Men's or Women's Council—by electing three
of the five members in February, thus raising
the chance that at least one of ;he holdovers
will be back in September.
So for once forget the status quo and vote
for the change. It will ease a number of tech
nical difficulties in your student government.
