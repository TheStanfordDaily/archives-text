# BULL SESSION
## WHO CARES, WHO KNOWS, WHAT NOW? 
### 
r purpose of today's lesson is to take Stanford
politics apart and not put it back together again.
Today collective Stanford will peer down its col
lective nose to see just who is going to be its collected
stooges for the current year. It will look, remark, and
yawn and that's about all. Unless the millenium comes
with Spring not far behind.
Whether Stanford politics ever was anything is a
matter for some conjecture.
That Stanford politics is nothing now is an all too
evident fact.
* * * *
We hear of Ilall-Row battles and caucuses and The
Daily is full of a lot of space-filling names that two
thirds of the student body never heard of, probably
never will hear of unless they get thrown out of
school or denounce the Administration or act differ
ently from the rest of the mob, which they won't be
cause they arc politicians.
Once elected, student body heads become stooges
so they don't matter.
And why should this be true? Principally because
no one gives a good hoot in the parlor who is elected.
Stanford students have been stewing in their own
troughs, refusing to be budged from their complacent,
ignoble viewpoints concerning matters of intellectual
and scholastic importance for many more years than
anyone can remember. And there is no reason to sup
pose they will jerk themselves from their lethargies
over such a crass and commonplace thing as a campus
election.
Now those who are about to be elected or have hopes
of being elected will sit on the edges of their scat this
morning
and think
that everyone is looking at them.
But the truth of the matter is that hardly anyone
will notice them, even if they are elected.
There is one thing Stanford students are reasonably
certain of-r-that these would-be rulers of the rabble are
of importance only to themselves, that the only persons
the students have to answer to are those wielders of
administrative wands whose middle initials begin with
Roth, Wilbur, C'hureh, and Yost.
