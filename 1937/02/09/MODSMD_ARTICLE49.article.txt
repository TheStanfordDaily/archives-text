# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Volume 91 of the Stanford Daily
has, in my estimation, three faults:
1. Too much opinion and destruc
tive criticism and not enough news.
2. Too many embittered column
sists. (Walton means columnists)
3. Too much slang.
Last Wednesday night (Walton
means Thursday), according to the
by-laws, all A.S.S.U. nominees were
required to state their platforms at
an open meeting to become eligible
to hold office. Wednesday's Daily
carried an announcement to this ef
fect in the Bulletin Board section on
the second page, and a small notice
in the uppermost corner of the first
page. There was no stox-y. The can
didates who depended upon what
they read in The Daily for informa
tion regarding electoral procedure
were uninformed, and as a result of
being uniformed (we are not, Wal
ton, except at a picnic) and not ap
pearing therefore at the meeting,
would have been, were it not for the
intercession of A.S.S.U. President
Jim Reynolds, automatically dis
qualified.
The Daily, however, in spite of not
running this story, contained no less
print than usual. But the print went
for the airing of grievances by a few
writers. There was "From This Cor
ner," which in a supposedly witty
fashion carried on at great length
about Women's Conference, and end
ed inconclusively.
"From this Corner" evidently is an
attempt by the present editor to imi
tate the inimicable (Walton meant
inimitable) previous editor. And in
asmuch as the present editor is not
naturally clever, and inasmuch as he
has in general apparently only a su
perficial knowledge of his subject,
his column is neither entertaining
nor instructive. The only impression
the reader gains is that he is trying
to sound more important and supe- i
rior than he actually is.
Some of the Daily's print went to
a column by Solon O. Swampum,
which bemoaned rather than com
mended the fact that this season's,
election has showed a tendency to be
free from the Hall-Row split, that
here perhaps is a time where a man
will be clected for his true worth
rather than for his social affiliations.
Bull Session was a long, long ar
ticle, which, expressed through a
most limited vocabulary, stated no
more than that the owner of Ihe
Matson Navigation Lines spends
more money in the care of race
horses than in Ihe support of long
shoremen employees.
This week a debate-symposium
was held on the question that the
speech of the Stanford student is not
that of an educated man. Not, only
were there students in the audience,
but among them a number of alumni,
one of them father of the A.S.S.U.
president. Said he, "It is through
reading the Stanford Daily that I be
come most aware of the inability of
the Stanford student adequately to
express himself. (He probably said,
"to adequately express," didn't he,
Walton?)
The liberal heads of the Stanford
Administration permit the Daily edi
tor to write much as he choses. It is
a shame, therefore, that given this
privilege, the editor uses it as a
license to swear, to criticize sincere
effort, offering nothing as a solution,
to fill his paper with opinions at the
expense of the news, to give the
alumni false impressions—in short,
to exploit his own ignorance.

Dear Walton:
"With a long, long article, which,
expressed through a most limited
vocabulary," Walton Wickett stated
no more than this—the Daily is '
lousy.—The Editor.
The Editor, Sir:
Volume 91 of the Stanford Daily
has, in my estimation, three faults:
1. Too much opinion and destruc
tive criticism and not enough news.
2. Too many embittered column
sists. (Walton means columnists)
3. Too much slang.
Last Wednesday night (Walton
means Thursday), according to the
by-laws, all A.S.S.U. nominees were
required to state their platforms at
an open meeting to become eligible
to hold office. Wednesday's Daily
carried an announcement to this ef
fect in the Bulletin Board section on
the second page, and a small notice
in the uppermost corner of the first
page. There was no stox-y. The can
didates who depended upon what
they read in The Daily for informa
tion regarding electoral procedure
were uninformed, and as a result of
being uniformed (we are not, Wal
ton, except at a picnic) and not ap
pearing therefore at the meeting,
would have been, were it not for the
intercession of A.S.S.U. President
Jim Reynolds, automatically dis
qualified.
The Daily, however, in spite of not
running this story, contained no less
print than usual. But the print went
for the airing of grievances by a few
writers. There was "From This Cor
ner," which in a supposedly witty
fashion carried on at great length
about Women's Conference, and end
ed inconclusively.
"From this Corner" evidently is an
attempt by the present editor to imi
tate the inimicable (Walton meant
inimitable) previous editor. And in
asmuch as the present editor is not
naturally clever, and inasmuch as he
has in general apparently only a su
perficial knowledge of his subject,
his column is neither entertaining
nor instructive. The only impression
the reader gains is that he is trying
to sound more important and supe- i
rior than he actually is.
Some of the Daily's print went to
a column by Solon O. Swampum,
which bemoaned rather than com
mended the fact that this season's,
election has showed a tendency to be
free from the Hall-Row split, that
here perhaps is a time where a man
will be clected for his true worth
rather than for his social affiliations.
