# HELLO, HELLO!

The Editor, Sir:
To Hell with your kick-in-the
pants tactics!
I have not been privileged to add
my name to those of the 200 who
would like to see Stanford fulfill the

ideals of her founders. The matter
of the A.S.S.U. treasury is immate
rial and irrelevant, so is the petition
if you consider only its face value.
The student body could do anything
that it really wanted to.
What counts is that there is a
movement on foot to make Stanford
more democratic, to place the em
phasis on the fun one can have by
knowing an increasing number of
students rather than on the amount
of money one has.
The Union Lobby may help—it all
depends on "the new furnishings and
decorations" and how it is run. Right
now the place looks almost as hope
less as a gymnasium. Just how a per
son is supposed to be gay and

friendly with no inside stimulation,
and in surroundings that make one
think of a morgue is a bit difficult
to understand. If the lobby is run
with the usual "union" technique
the venture will be a flop and the
blame will be placed on the "fiickle
ness of student taste."
