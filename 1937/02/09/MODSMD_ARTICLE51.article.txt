### Clipped by ALLEN DRURY 
go on sale today for Leslie
Howard's production of "Ham
let," which begins a two weeks' en
gagement at the Curran next Mon
day. Bay Region playgoers will have

or wrong in expressing the pious
hope that Walter Hampden was
warming up in the wings.
Supporting roles will be taken by a
cast of more than 60, many of them
from the Stratford-on-Avon and
Malvern Festival groups. Mary Ser
voss, last seen on the Coast as the
mother in ''Tobacco Road," will play
the Queen, Hamlet's mother. Stew
art Chaney handles scenery, and Vir
gil Thomson, noted for his scoring of
Gertrude Stein's opera, "Four Saints
in Three Acts,'' has composed special
music.
