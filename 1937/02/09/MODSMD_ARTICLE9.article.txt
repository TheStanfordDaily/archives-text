## 
### 
Federal regulation of hours and
wages would be "a sop and slap in
the face of labor, and a vain hope
and a wishful dream," said Edward
Lindblom, Stanford debate manager,
in the debate yesterday afternoon
with representatives from Drake
University .
Upholding the negative of the Pi
Kappa Delta question, "Resolved:
that Congress be empowered to reg
ulate minimum wages and maximum
hours in industry," Lindblom criti
cized such regulation as "a hasty and
ill considered measure which would
aggravate rather than solve the
problem." In its place, he suggested
such measures as slum clearance
and social insurance.
Speaking for the affirmative,
Charles Browning, of Drake, said
that "an immediate answer is needed
to the economic and social evils
caused by long hours and low wages
in industry. Federal regulation would
alleviatw the evih resulting from low
standards of living and would place
the burden where it rightfully be
longs, upon the exploiters of labor."
Gerald Marcus criticized the effect
of federal regulation both upon in
dustry and labor. "Such class legis
lation," he said, "would make for a
vast bureaucracy which would weak
en our industrial system and would
mean higher living costs, which
would be harmful both to the work
ers directly affected and to those not
covered by the law."
The concluding speaker, John Sim
mons, of Drake, based his case upon
the valuable effects of the NRA, and
pointed out that "the cry of 'bu
reaucracy' is used against all social
legislation." He denied that federal
legislation would cause higher cost.'
