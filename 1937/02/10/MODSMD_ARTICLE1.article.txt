## SHAKING DOWN A SHAKE-UP ON THE S. F. FAIR 
### 
r JMIE Directors of the Golden Gate
International Exposition admit a
lot of things. They confess the need
of a wholesale reorganization of per
sonnel. They admit that not a single
foreign government has been signed
up for exhibits. They clearly infer
that the postponement of San Fran
cisco's fair from 1938 to 1939 was un
fortunate, in view of a little county
fair in New York City the same year.
But what they don't admit is that
San Francisco, at present, simply
hasn't an exposition at all.
That the Fair organization was
lousy with politics didn't surprise
anyone. An old-timer in the busi
ness of big-time management de
clares that every Fair has its period
of political abuse; that such a period
is a natural step in its evolution.
* * *
¥>UT the whole trick of exposition
management, it seems, is know
ing just how long the politicians
should howl, and just when to kick
them out. It's his opinion that in
San Francisco's case, the shake-up
came too late.
He bases his prediction on the
failure of the Philadelphia Sesqui
centennial, as aromatic a stinkaroo
as ever bid for the nation's attention.
San Francisco's fair looks almost as
bad. For today it takes more than
routine domestic exhibits to put over
an exposition and domestic exhibits
are all the Golden Gate people can
boast.
For while grandma swooned in
awe at the Corliss Engine at the Cen
tennial Exposition, and papa went to
Chicago in '93 just to see Little Egypt,
them days are gone with wasp waists
and moustache cups.

it on the movies and the
radio, or both, the fact is it takes
the 12 disciples in a bicycle act to
really make an exposition pay. For
the same automobile, airplane and
fast train that will take you to the
fair grounds is the complement of
those agencies of communication
and transportation that will, almost
literally, bring the fair to you.
Which makes the problem a tough
one. So tough, in fact, that we won
der why politics weren't kept out of
the organization in the first place, or
was the exposition planned to be just
and exercise for professional public
speakers and political hirelings?
In a few days, we will probably re
ceive quashing letters from a fair
executive that the facts of this article
are wrong. They probably are.
Frankly, we've had no way to check
our facts.
for a sporadic promotional
nature —standard shots of Mayor
Rossi greeting two trained kangaroos
or bathing beauties posing on the
Shoals, news of the exposition has
been shrouded almost as perfectly as
the dirty words Chief Justice Hughes
calls Roosevelt.
Not that exposition publicity was
wrong politically, simply that there
was something politically wrong with
exposition publicity. It wasn't effi
ciently handled. It appears as if it
were handled by a political ap
pointee, to carry an obvious analysis
to its obvious conclusion.
If there will be anything for people
to see in 1939, they haven't heard of
it. At best it apparently will not be
Exposition exhibits but the bridges.
And whether the Fair directors
know it or not, anyone can come
look at the bridges in 1937. They
don't have to wait until 1939, when
all the politicians have had their fun.
And they probably won't wait.
They'll have- a date in New York
that year, where the politicians MAY
be kicked out in time.

If there will be anything for people
to see in 1939, they haven't heard of
it. At best it apparently will not be
Exposition exhibits but the bridges.

know it or not, anyone can come
look at the bridges in 1937. They
don't have to wait until 1939, when
all the politicians have had their fun.

International Exposition admit a
lot of things. They confess the need
of a wholesale reorganization of per
sonnel. They admit that not a single
foreign government has been signed
up for exhibits. They clearly infer
that the postponement of San Fran
cisco's fair from 1938 to 1939 was un
fortunate, in view of a little county
fair in New York City the same year.
But what they don't admit is that
San Francisco, at present, simply
hasn't an exposition at all.
That the Fair organization was
lousy with politics didn't surprise
anyone. An old-timer in the busi

clares that every Fair has its period
of political abuse; that such a period
is a natural step in its evolution.
