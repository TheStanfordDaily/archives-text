# Students Elect Calderwood, Reynolds, Weiner, Munger
## Precinct Plan Ups Returns To New High 
### JOHN RICE 
Behind yesterday's record mid
year vote was no great steam-roller
of Row-Hall interest, but a newly in
troduced precinct system of voting
which resulted in more convenient
balloting.
Unlike other elections during
which milling crowds of students
have sought vainly to cast their votes
and then get to classes on time, there
was little crowding and no waiting.
Reynolds Approves
A.S.S.U. President Jim Reynolds
said last night that he considered the
experiment a marked success, and
that Ex Committee would probably
vote to adopt it next week. Chief
fault with the system, according to
Election Chairman Dave Allison, is
that the Geology Corner poll is not
popular and should be incorporated
with the one at Engineering Corner.
Only Row candidate to break
through the barrage of hall voting
was Jean Reynolds, sister of the
student body president, who defeat
ed Pat Skinner only after the third
preferences had been counted.
Halls, 5; Row. «
Carrying on in Franich's place is
Toro Jack Calderwood, while re
placing Phi Delt Joe Burris is Los
Arcos Joe Weiner. Thus the halls
now boast five representatives on the
Executive Committee, while the Row
has six. This is more even than it
has been for the past year when the
Greeks held a majority of seven.
Though surpassing the 1100 votes
Cast a year ago ,and the 1200 ballots
tallied in February, 1935, yesterday's
total of 1300 falls far short of the an
nual spring election results. This is
easily accounted for when it is
realized that many more offices are
vacant, and competition is naturally
more stiff.
