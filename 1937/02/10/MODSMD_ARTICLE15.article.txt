# Sophomore Woman Emerged When Ex Committee Fathomed This Fog
## 
### 
TN THE RACE for Sophomore Woman on Ex Committee yesterday, Pat
Skinner scored 278 first-choices, Jean Reynolds ran a close second with
217. Since neither had a majority of the votes cast, Election Board resorted
to the preferential system of counting second and third choices.
This resulted in Jean Reynolds' winning by 80 ballots.
Ex Committee last night found itself in a fog trying to understand the
preferential system Election Board used. Chick Franich declared that it
varied from the one used last year.
Hence Shirley Jones and Roy Anderson were appointed to investigate
preferential voting systems with Dean Marion Kirkwood of the Lavf School.
Here's the system used yesterday by Election Chairman Dave Allison:
Ballots were delegated to the seven candidates according to first-choices.
Since no majority resulted, seventh candidate (lowest) in the list was taken
out, and her ballots allotted to remaining six by second-choice indications.
Again no majority resulted, so ballots of candidate then ranking sixth
were distributed among remaining five by second-choice indications, or by
third-choice indications of those ballots indicating for second-choice one of
two candidates already dropped.
This process was continued, dropping off each time the candidate then
having least ballots and distributing her ballots among remaining candi
dates according to second choice indicated, or according to third choice if
second-choice indicated was already dropped. Ballots for which third
choice candidate had also been dropped were eliminated from considera
tion.
If at end of any such redistribution process one candidate had shown a
majority of ballots still under consideration, she would have been elected.
In this case it was necessary to eliminate candidates down to the last two
before a majority was obtained by any one.
