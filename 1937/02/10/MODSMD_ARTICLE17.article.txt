### 
Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Mark
1 Twain are favorite American authors
|in Germany, said Dr. Freidrich
Sehoenemann, director of the Ame
| rika-Abteilung of the University of
[ Berlin, who spoke here last night.
Emerson's philosophy appeals to
I the German heart, said Dr. Schoene
| tnann. Germans also like Twain's hu
j mor and his pictures of American
I life. Whitman, he said, has been
| very much misunderstood, but is bet
j ter appreciated now.
American literature, Dr. Schoene
| mann explained, is very difficult for
Europeans to understand. Words
and expressions common in America
are unintelligible even to the English.
Moreover, much of the vital humor
of the writing is lost in translation.
