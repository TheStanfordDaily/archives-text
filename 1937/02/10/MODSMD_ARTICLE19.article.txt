# Mood Recedes In State While Damage Rises
## Traffic Is Stopped, Roads Are Closed in Southern California Inundation 
### (By United Press 
Flood waters receded in California
Monday, giving householders and.
fanners an opportunity to rehabili
tate inundated areas in the southwest
and in the San Joaquin, Sacramento,
and Pajaro Valleys. Rain ceased and
temperatures dropped, lessening the
danger of further widespread flood
conditions.
Two persons were drowned and
another was killed from effects of a
snow slide in the week-end storm
which swept the state.
Traffic Disrupted
Muddy waters still swirled across
fertile lands in the southern portion
of the San Joaquin Valley, but at
Watsonville, where the Pajaro River
reached its highest point in eight
years, the flood waters began subsid
ing after spreading over 300 acres.
Traffic still was disrupted in sev
eral localities. U.S. Highway 101 was
closed from Long Beach to San Diego
because of flood conditions and
washed out bridges. Motor traffic to
San Diego was detoured via River
sire and Elsinore. Roads north and
east of Visalia were closed because of
flood conditions. Entrances to Se
quoia and General Grant National
Parks were closed. Slides blocked
the highway from San Lucas to
Coalinga. The Fresno-Hanford high
way, closed by flood waters at Laton,
was reopened today.
New Fatalities
Traffic over the Sierra to Reno was
under one-way control with State
Highway Department convoys. Au
tomobiles were detoured around
Merced where flood waters were
slowly subsiding.
Fatalities were Kurt Hubert,
whose automobile was swept off a
bridge near Corona, and Louis Kess
ler, who fell into a stream at San
Jacinto. Mrs. Anna Isbel Leavitt died
in a Red Bluff hospital from injuries
suffered in an explosion caused when
snow slid from the roof of her home
and severed a gas line.
The Parker Dam site, in the Colo
rado River between Arizona and
California, escaped undamaged when
flood waters of the river swept away
a bridge and swept on beyond the
$2,000,000 project.
