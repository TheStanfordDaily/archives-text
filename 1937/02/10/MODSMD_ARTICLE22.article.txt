# Soft Beds, Good Food Offered at Rest Home

This is the first of two articles dealing with Stanford's rest homes
â€”The Editor

Almost anything from a cold to a case of poison oak will enable you to
be tucked away in one of the 14 beds at (M 7 Alvarado Street. Once in, you
can throw yourself whole-heartedly into the round of orange juice, nose
drops, cough medicine, and daily visits from Miss Fay. B.A.C. nurse,
which make up the life of the Stanford Men's Rest Home

Two minutes after you enter, your
status is determined by the ther
mometer, that little instrument which
creates its own caste system. If you
top 98.6, your consolations are that
the beds are comfortabLe and the
food good.
The daily visits from Miss Fay usu
ally run about as follows:
"Miss Fay, when can I get up?"
"Well, wait till tomorrow and if
everything is all right, we'll see."
After two or three days of this and
meals in bed, the inmate may be as
sured of an easy life, that is, if he
can prove that he is normal, at least
in regard to temperature. Only a few
traitors study. The rest sit around
bull-sessioning, reading the copies of
Life, Esquire, and Fortune that al
ways seem to be around, and listen
ing to one of the three radios. Con
versations like the following indicate
another pastime:
"Nursie. I just won you in a game
of poker."
"Don't call ME nursie, if you want
to live."
Visitors can usually crash the gates
if they don't happen around at orange
juice time, meal hours, or afternoon
rest period. Female visitors, though
they never seem to appear, are also
allowed in the parlor.
Two institutions of the rest home
that can't be overlooked are the po
lice dog, Wolf, and the terrier, Deuce.
Deuce's climb up the oak tree in the
back yard is something that every
new inmate doesn't get a chance to
miss.
If it weren't for the fact that after
ihe first five days the price of lodg
ing materially increases, Mrs. Allen
would probably have a steady supply
of boarders. The custom of Sunday
night suppers around the fire place
goes far in making good her ex
pressed hope that every inmate
should feel at home.
If all the blood vessels in a human
body were stretched end to end they
would reach about twenty-five thou
sand miles, or once around the
world.
