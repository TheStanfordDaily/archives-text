## SIEBERT TO GET GLASSES 
### 
It has been said that if big Ton"
Siebert had a good pair of eyes ht
would be about 30 per cent beltei
;is a basketball player. Now, iiU pet
cent to Freshman Siebert's ability
would make him quite a hoop star
since he has shown himself so far this
season to be hardly a dope when it
comes to playing the cagey game.
He doesn't have any trouble off
the court, because then he can
wear his glasses and everything's
fine. The suggestion that he wear a
mask to protect his spectacles so
that he could wear them on the
floor was all right, but the use of
a mask would in a certain measure
cut oIV his vision, so that he could
see only straight ahead.
The whole trouble will be cleared
up. though, when Trundling Thomas
gets his new specs. The basketball
department is planning to get him a
pair of those new-type glasses that
arc shatter-proof, and do not have to
be protected by a mask. They're big,
thick ones, that will correct his as
tigmatism and at the same time not
be in danger of getting shattered
during a game.
