When a .lad by the name of Clark,
?i sophomore swimmer who is plenty
good, took the 100-yard splash in the
time of :55.5, and the 50-yard dash
in :24.7 at the All-University swim
ming championships last Saturday,
Coach Nort Thornton rose up might
ily enthused.
"This boy is the best we have
had since the days of the great
John IWcKclvcy." was his way of
expressing his feelings.
Harking back to the clays of Mc-
Kelvey gives us the dope that John
set the world's record for 50 yards in
Encina Pools May 14, 19!i2, as a sen
ior. He did it in :22.5 seconds, in
what is known as the short tank, or
20-yard pool.
Clark churned it Saturday in the
long course, or 25-yard tank, on a
'-low start. He's a sophomore, this is
early season yet, and so Stanford has
a great prospect. He has everything
in his favor, too—he is big, strong as
an ox, with lots of fire. Yes, he'll do.
