# Laughing Boys Reunited For Bruin Contest
## Bunn Expected To Take Twelve South For Week – end Clashes 
### GORDY FROST 
First time in two weeks, Stanford's
laughing basketball boys last night
had a chance to laugh all together—
principally because last night was the
first time since January 22 that the
regular first varsity was able to turn
out intact.
Yesterday Howie Turner and Jack
Calderwood, their ills left behind,
were running defensive and offensive
drill with Hank Luisetti, Dinty
More and Art Stoefen, who returned
to practice after Monday's rest; but
what predominated during the work
out was the Stanford basketball
laughing spirit which will accompany
Bunn and his men southward to
meet U.C.L.A. on Friday and Satur
day evenings of this week-end.
Tomorrow evening on the Lark.
Starjfoi;d leaves for Los Angeles, and
although Bunn's official traveling list
has not been released, it can be sus
pected that the usual squad of 12 will
go south to reckon with El Bruin.
