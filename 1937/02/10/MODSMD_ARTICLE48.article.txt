# Waterfront Troubles

### 
WHEN The Daily's reporter on waterfront
affairs tried to get some facts for a story
the other day, he slipped into cold, swollen
Lake Lagunita. The boathouse boys pulled him
out, and he returned to the Daily shack, still
wet and. dripping.
He sat down at a typewriter, involuntarily
chattered a bit, and wrote:
"Early season swimmers in Lagunita are ex
posed to danger of colds and nasal infections
from the organisms in the water, Dr. Thomas A.
otorey, men's health director, warned yester
day."
He sneezed.
"The lake is still full of organisms swept
Irom the wide watersheds back of the campus.
A few weeks of sunlight will kill these bacte
ria and warm the water sufficiently to increase
Jjodily resistance to colds."
After adding "canoeing, however, is in full
nwing with increasing use of the lake every
'3a~y," the reporter gave his story to the night
editor with a bluish hand, sneezed again and
.eft the office.
Point is, when the campus is still suffering
from more flu cases every day, when the Health
Service admits the water is still full of cold
rjerms, why open Lagunita at all? Despite the
return of "California weather," the Farm is not
yet over the results of the cold spell.
Moreover, adequate safety facilities are still
'acking. Emergency floats haven't been an
chored in the lake. And not yet enforced is the
usual rule that only accomplished swimmers
may use canoes.
The question narrows down to this—is La
gunita safe at present or isn't Lagunita safe?
•f it is, leave it open. But if swimmers, and
consequently canoers who accidentally fall in,
ore endangered by cold germs and lack of
.safety facilities, Lagunita is not safe. We won
der why it was permitted to open.—D. B.
The educational sysfem has become a
vicious circle. The teachers are badly edu
cated. They educate their students badly.
Some of the badly educated students become
badly educated teachers who educate their
students badly.—Robert M. Hutchins, Univer
sity of Chicago president
