# The 						Ugly Head Rears

may rear an ugly head—but only to those
O who hide theirs. Stanford might do well to
drop its guard and face the question squarely
with a well-designed course in sex education.
If you were one of those—and there were
lots of them—who recently received a neat bit
of advertising matter boosting a currently pop
ular book which purports to "face the facts
sanely, etc.," then perhaps you wondered why
this type of education shouldn't be received in
Stanford classrooms along with history and
math.
It should. Stanford people are broad enough
to disregard tittering custom and throw off the
cloud of obscurity that generally embraces this
subject. Sex education in this country has
lagged behind that of England and Denmark;
Stanford might do well to take a step in this
field.
What college men and women ask is not the
mere physiological concept, but a deeper emo
tional explanation of a subject which plays a
huge part in the life of all men. A life made
successful by four years of conscientious Uni
versity knowledge - gathering may be utterly
broken in after years by sex ignorance. Is it
sensible to neglect such a vital study?
Not that Stanford people are ignorant in these
matters, but rather, Stanford people are not sure.

Most persons of college age have pieced to
gether from back-alley sources and elementary
hygiene courses, a fair knowledge of sex. What
they now ask is confirmation of what they sus
pect.
Freshman women entering Stanford are given
a short series of three lectures by Dr. Helen
Pryor, Medical Adviser of Women, which at
tempts merely to touch the subject, and Con
structive Hygiene, 150, hits it only briefly dur
ing a two-day period. Except for these, and
courses which approach sex purely from a sci
entific standpoint, Stanford stands enshrouded
with the masses in the bogey of sex ignorance.
The solution might be a brief course to give
men and women of Stanford a straightforward
concept of the physiological and psychological
aspects of sex unhampered by the mid-Victorian
film of embarrassment which ordinarily sur
rounds the subject.
Isn't this an essential ingredient in the edu
cation of a group which ultimately will call
itself cultured? Or can't Stanford face sex
squarely?—G. F.
It was either a French philosopher or a Los
Angeles sports writer who said that writing a
column without ruffling someone's feelings
is like winking at a girl in the dark—lots of
exercise but no results.
