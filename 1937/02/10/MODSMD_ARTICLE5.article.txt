/MUCK ERANICH, retiring Jun
* ior Man, told Ex Committee
good-bye last night with the fol
lowing words:
"I know I've been a damned rad
ical at times. I know that some
times you've thought me bull
headed and stubborn, that my ar
guments have had neither rime nor
reason.
"But oftentimes a committee
such as this loses sight of the stu
dents' viewpoint. The fact that the
Administration has been here a
long time and is above you is liable
to carry too much weight.
"The student body is a living
thing. It has its desires, and it
knows them better than Mr. Roth
or anyone else in the Administra
tion.
"My advice is to lean the other
way a little more—toward the stu
dents."
