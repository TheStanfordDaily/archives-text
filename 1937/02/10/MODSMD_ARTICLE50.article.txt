When not reading Don Passos and Bull Session, Our
Hasher spend his time among his flowers, learning
from the birds and bees, who is breaking Stanford's
no-corsage tradition.
In my flower garden last week-end. H-woman who
used to be an Alpha Phi in the days when the Alpha
Delt house had blinds on its windows instead of its
dates, reported that she hopes that Stanford will never
adopt a corsage tradition, because then everybody will
want to break it.
However, to get on with my story—yes, ves, get on
—after explaining about all the details of who was going
with who that night, and how many people were wear
ing flowers to the Parilia, and how many people were
not even wearing flowers to the Parilia, and what a
corsage tradition, she told me a story. (Surprise?) (Yes,
shame it was about the Parilia and the Parilia's no
surprise.)
She has a son who lives in Encina. Her son has a
room-mate whose home also is in Palo Alto. I hope
this isn't getting too involved. Well, it seems that in
their childish way they like Encina, except for the
noise, which some people maintain is noisy. If this is
getting too involved, I hope somebody will stop me.
Now her son and his room-mate have a very simple
plan of getting to sleep in Encina. They imagine that
they are in heaven, and that all that clanking and
bangihg is just Satan on his subway.
One week-end, though, the flower garden H-wom
an's son's room-mate decided to give up the struggle
and go home for the night. The folks were all very
happy and asked him if he wasn't studying too hard,
and my wouldn't it be nice to have a quiet evening at
home, and why the hell didn't he send his laundry
home on time. To which the son's room-mate answered,
"Yes," and went straight to bed.
Pretty soon momma and poppa went to bed. They
went to sleep right away. Pretty soon momma and
poppa started to snore.
The son's room-mate couldn't sleep. It was terrify
ing. He couldn't think of heaven at all. A cold sweat
broke out.
All he could think of was trying to call Roble for a
date from an Encina telephone booth.
In the morning the folks got up, prepared for the
hour and a half struggle to wake him up and get him to
the breakfast table.
They looked in his room. He was gone. Completely.
They called the cops. They scoured the countryside.
Finally somebody found the body. It had not been
maimed or mangled at all, but it was sleeping peace
fully in Encina Hall, freshman dormitory, for men (and
how).

Pretty soon momma and poppa went to bed. They
went to sleep right away. Pretty soon momma and
poppa started to snore.
The son's room-mate couldn't sleep. It was terrify
ing. He couldn't think of heaven at all. A cold sweat
broke out.
All he could think of was trying to call Roble for a
date from an Encina telephone booth.
In the morning the folks got up, prepared for the
hour and a half struggle to wake him up and get him to
the breakfast table.
They looked in his room. He was gone. Completely.
They called the cops. They scoured the countryside.
Finally somebody found the body. It had not been
maimed or mangled at all, but it was sleeping peace
fully in Encina Hall, freshman dormitory, for men (and
how).
When not reading Don Passos and Bull Session, Our
Hasher spend his time among his flowers, learning
from the birds and bees, who is breaking Stanford's
no-corsage tradition.
In my flower garden last week-end. H-woman who
used to be an Alpha Phi in the days when the Alpha
Delt house had blinds on its windows instead of its
dates, reported that she hopes that Stanford will never
adopt a corsage tradition, because then everybody will
want to break it.
However, to get on with my story—yes, ves, get on
—after explaining about all the details of who was going
with who that night, and how many people were wear
ing flowers to the Parilia, and how many people were
not even wearing flowers to the Parilia, and what a
corsage tradition, she told me a story. (Surprise?) (Yes,
shame it was about the Parilia and the Parilia's no
surprise.)
She has a son who lives in Encina. Her son has a
room-mate whose home also is in Palo Alto. I hope
this isn't getting too involved. Well, it seems that in
their childish way they like Encina, except for the
noise, which some people maintain is noisy. If this is
getting too involved, I hope somebody will stop me.
Now her son and his room-mate have a very simple
plan of getting to sleep in Encina. They imagine that
they are in heaven, and that all that clanking and
bangihg is just Satan on his subway.
One week-end, though, the flower garden H-wom
an's son's room-mate decided to give up the struggle
and go home for the night. The folks were all very
happy and asked him if he wasn't studying too hard,
and my wouldn't it be nice to have a quiet evening at
home, and why the hell didn't he send his laundry
home on time. To which the son's room-mate answered,
"Yes," and went straight to bed.
