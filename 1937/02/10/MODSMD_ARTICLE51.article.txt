TOO MUCH SLANG

Yesterday there appeared in Campus Opinion a long,
over-written letter by Mr. Walton Wickett bemoaning
the fact that, among other things, The Daily contained
too much slang. Too bad. how sad, I'm glad.
Now the question is, should we write as the pedants
do, as you do maybe, piling up heaps of unemotional
verbiage, perhaps garbage, that means nothing to the
casual reader, or should we write as we really speak.
In other words, should we express ourselves or just fill
space.
Which is about all we do anyway.
. We live in America and were born with American
heritages so just why, Mr. Wickett, should we not
speak the American tongue. A more graphic, vital, and
emotional language doesn't exist unless it is the Chi
nese and that is too difficult to learn this late in life.
With the help of Webster's dictionary I could sit
down and fill this column with words you never heard
of and I could say such things as, "I'm promulgating
your exotic cogitations, etc., etc.," but it wouldn't mean
much because no one would understand what I was
talking about. Not that I understand myself.
And it wouldn't make me think any more clearly,
either.
But above all, it most certainly wouldn't make me a
writer.
Which I would like to be.
Fortunately for this country, there are a few inten
sive souls who seek to brighten the speech we use by
coining unusual expressions. They are people who tire
of the ordinary run of life and seek to enliven it by
making themselves more interesting to others. They
have grown weary of spending long hours over diction
aries because they are inventors, who, bored by 10-
syllable bon mots, refuse to steep themselves in the
mustiness surrounding our past. They are individual
ists, souls proud enough to walk alone.
Any fool can sit down and memorize long lists of
vocabulary.
Usually the fools arc the ones who do it, which may
or may not strike home.
So we find the American language full of these
words and phrases that have fire and life in them
words and phrases that have helped to make our
language
a vibrant mediym of expression
full of personality, full of what it takes to convey
well rounded American thoughts, cleverly, success
fully.

TOO MUCH SLANG

Yesterday there appeared in Campus Opinion a long,
over-written letter by Mr. Walton Wickett bemoaning
the fact that, among other things, The Daily contained
too much slang. Too bad. how sad, I'm glad.
Now the question is, should we write as the pedants
do, as you do maybe, piling up heaps of unemotional
verbiage, perhaps garbage, that means nothing to the
casual reader, or should we write as we really speak.
In other words, should we express ourselves or just fill
space.
Which is about all we do anyway.
. We live in America and were born with American
heritages so just why, Mr. Wickett, should we not
speak the American tongue. A more graphic, vital, and
emotional language doesn't exist unless it is the Chi
nese and that is too difficult to learn this late in life.
With the help of Webster's dictionary I could sit
down and fill this column with words you never heard
of and I could say such things as, "I'm promulgating
your exotic cogitations, etc., etc.," but it wouldn't mean
much because no one would understand what I was
talking about. Not that I understand myself.
And it wouldn't make me think any more clearly,
either.
But above all, it most certainly wouldn't make me a
writer.
Which I would like to be.
Fortunately for this country, there are a few inten
sive souls who seek to brighten the speech we use by
coining unusual expressions. They are people who tire
of the ordinary run of life and seek to enliven it by
making themselves more interesting to others. They
have grown weary of spending long hours over diction
aries because they are inventors, who, bored by 10-
syllable bon mots, refuse to steep themselves in the
mustiness surrounding our past. They are individual
ists, souls proud enough to walk alone.
Any fool can sit down and memorize long lists of
vocabulary.
Usually the fools arc the ones who do it, which may
or may not strike home.
So we find the American language full of these
words and phrases that have fire and life in them
words and phrases that have helped to make our
language
a vibrant mediym of expression
full of personality, full of what it takes to convey
well rounded American thoughts, cleverly, success
fully.
