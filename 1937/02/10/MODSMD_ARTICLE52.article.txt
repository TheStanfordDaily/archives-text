The Editor, Sir:
Thank you for your corrections of
my article criticizing the Daily. Per
haps my factual and grammatical in
competence is one reason that I for
one knew better than to run for
Daily editor. Anyway, whether or
not you plan to adopt my suggestions,
I note with satisfaction that you have
seen my point (apparently you don't
agree with it) — that the Daily
through refining would be improved.

The Editor, Sir:
So it's come to pass that one Tro
Harper passes judgment on the
American Way—
Perhaps Mr. Harper would prefer
the Italian Way, with profitless and
harmful invasions, with restricted
news, and with Mussolini's directions
and befuddlings.
Or perhaps the German Way, with
great scientists being ejected because
their politics don't agree with the
ones Der Feuhrer cherishes, or be
cause they are of the race that has

helped Deutschland much too often
to be kicked in the face as a result.
How about the Japanese Way, or
the Russian Way with the murders
the boys over there carry on with
monotonous regularity, and the mal
nourishment with which the unfortu
nate children are reared.
Tro, old boy—may I call you Tro,
old boy (I've yet to have the honor
of making your acquaintance. Why
don't you either shut up or go to one
of the places where you think you'll
find a better Way? There are enough
of us who are relatively satisfied to
get along with those who aren't ap
preciative of the things they enjoy,
and the privileges laid forth for their
use.
Seems like you have a lot to be
moaning about—going to school?
eating? Have any clothes? Having a
great deal of financial difficulty?
Why not pick something to praise,
instead of always finding fault—even
those who seek the best are happy,
sometimes.
