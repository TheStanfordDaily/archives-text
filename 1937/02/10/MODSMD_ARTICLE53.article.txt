Last year Nancy was again runner

Jack is the protege of Tommy Ar

game of golf already. He averages
the Stanford course in about 78, and
his best score here is now 72.
He has had many lessons under

of his promises to his patron is that
he will refrain from drinking and
smoking during his golf career.
