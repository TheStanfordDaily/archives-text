TF YOU liked Jalna, The Whiteoaks
of Jalna and the other three books
filled with the vivid personalities of
the Whiteoak clan, you will like this
latest story of their doings. Whiteoak
Harvest.
Mazo de La Roche continues the
serial of this proud Canadian family
still bound together by the magnetic
grip of the family homestead, Jalna,
under the generous tyraivt Renny.
The scattered members of the fam
ily, the two uncles and Finch, return
to the shelter of Jalna. Wake mak
ing his most dramatic gesture tries
a monastery for a while, but the ties
of kinship win him back to the fold.
Alayne attempts to escape the domi
nating spirit of Jalna and her love
for her husband, Renny.
But it isn't what the Whiteoaks do,
but what they feel that makes Miss
De La Roche's books such absorb
ing reading. An encounter with the
Whiteoak clan, a delving into their
simple, emotionally turbulent lives
leaves one exhausted. Personally, I
find so much undiluted emotion a bit
wearying.
Probably my trouble is that I met
the Forsyte Saga first and since have
held it up as the saga standard for all
sagas. Miss De La Roche can depict
characters better than most, but from
there on I think her writing is lack
ing. None of the finer nuances of

good writing are to be found in her
work. Too often you can see the i
wheels turn.
While the Forsytes were the ex- ;
pression of their age and country, j
the Whiteoaks exist in a sort of age- '
less vacuum. Nothing of the changes 1
of the outside civilization ever seem I
to perturb them. Being a pretty ego- !
tistical lot, Jalna and the Whiteoaks |
are the whole world for them.
But, as I said, I'm prejudiced and
Whiteoak fans, who are,many, will
read and enjoy this last tale.
