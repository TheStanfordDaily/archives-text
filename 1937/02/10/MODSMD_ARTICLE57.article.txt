# Desk Carvings Tell Tales Of Stanford Men

### ALLAN DRURY 
Fools' names . . . or- at any rate,
the things they think about while i
the funny man teaches Applied Blah
. . . decorate the desks in Poli Sci 23.
Carved, inked, and penciled, these
symptoms of the mind of the Rough
at work form an interesting record
of what students really do get out of
college.
Take for instance the Poli Sci
major who evidently is destined to
rise in his country's service:
"I began criticising our govern
ment," he writes thoughtfully across
the arm of his chair. "When I was
sent for, the President said, 'Here's
an intelligent man.' So I said to
Roosevelt—"
Unfortunately for posterity, the
record ends abruptly at this point.
The sad tale of a wandering Don
Juan who came into conflict with the
authorities is related in the follow
ing cryptic message:
"St. Louis—Kansas City—Denver—
Salt Lake—Reno—Palo Alto—Stan
ford — the Dean's office — Miss
Church."
One can only surmise the drama
that lies behind those simple words,
but here too the writer fails to en
large sufficiently upon his tale, and
the reader is left up in the air.
Poets, however, are apt to be more j
brief and to the point. One of them |
has summed up his knowledge of |
womanhood in a single brief and bit- |
ter jibe which he entitles "Ode to a I
Stanford Co-ed."
First couplet runs as follows:
"Four out of five have it. (What?)
"The fifth goes to Stanford."
As if not content with this blast,'
he continues:
"Four out of five have it. (What?) !
"The fifth goes to Stanford."
Here the effort ends, with Stan- j
ford women definitely in their place, j
Tragedy in the Bronx furnishes a
budding Dreiser with grist for his'
mill.
"Joe Plotz," reads the first entry, j

Half an inch lower comes "Herman
Plotz Flotz"—evidently a cousin.
"Sophie Zilch" completes the tri
angle, and the observer has only to
imagine for himself what dark deeds
it signifies.
There are cynics among desk
carvers, however, as is proved by the
student who remarks sneeringly:
"College 'rah rah' stuff."
• He has a friend who sums up the
whole affair thus: "What the hell!
Stanford!"
