# TRACKMEN BEGIN WORK
## 
### 
Breaking the 1935 record by eight
days, Dink Templeton's varsity track
team took its first official workout
yesterday, 29 days behind schedule.
Angell Field track has been raked
and will be ready for use tomorrow;
in the meantime, trackmen ran to
Mayfield and back, while field men
worked on form.
