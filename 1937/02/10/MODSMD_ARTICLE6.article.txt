Reynolds told Ex Committee that
the royal race had caused antago

jects to any kind of contest and the
Convalescent Home doesn't 'need
that kind of money'."

king," Reynolds told Rouble. "Prob
ably some weasel worse than you
or I."
Unheeded went Frnnich's argu
ment that "the Convalescent Home
drive will be difficult to put over this
